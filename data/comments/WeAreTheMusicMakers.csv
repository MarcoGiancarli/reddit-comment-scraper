WeAreTheMusicMakers,3e3abh,long_balls_larry,5,Tue Jul 21 17:02:02 2015 UTC,"Move on, my best tracks are the ones I punch out in 20 mins. (20 Mins of composition, theres still an hour of arranging and final touches, 2-3 hours of mixing, and an hour of mastering).  I've been doing this long enough that I trust my subconscious's judgement when it tells me the track is crap, move on. Every couple of months I go through the ""crap"" tracks and they all are still crap except for the rare golden goose egg."
WeAreTheMusicMakers,3e3abh,Slyth3rin,3,Tue Jul 21 17:12:06 2015 UTC,Can you explain your process of composition? I'm really interested to know what all goes into that initial process for you.
WeAreTheMusicMakers,3e3abh,rowlandrose,3,Tue Jul 21 17:43:21 2015 UTC,"I'd say keep working on it. If it doesn't sound great to you then there's obviously something wrong. Take a break from working on it for a few hours and then listen to it through again and point out exactly what you notice is wrong with it. You can never be fully finished with a song though. Once you're confident (enough) that it's where you want it to be, then move on to something else."
WeAreTheMusicMakers,3e3abh,romeinsilver,3,Tue Jul 21 17:13:05 2015 UTC,"If I feel like an idea is not worth the work then I move on. Even if I am completely wrong there is no point wasting time on art that you can't connect to. Obviously it might be a good idea to revisit the idea later on (when you've learned some new tricks) to see if it is a salvageable idea, but if you think it is a turd why would you polish it when you could be chasing a better idea."
WeAreTheMusicMakers,3e3abh,D-Mass,2,Tue Jul 21 17:13:37 2015 UTC,"It completely depends on the situation. If it's just for personal use to improve your technique, then move on quickly. If it's for the public/paid work then absolutely tweak it until you're happy to release it. Personally, I've found loads of satisfaction and the feeling of liberation of moving on quickly recently, and it's improved my overall production. But that's for the r/songaweek challenge, so I'm still posting it online anyway. After uploading it, I listen back to it and every single time without fail, I shout ""SHIT!"" As I realise a mistake that I left in or a part of the mix that isn't great. But then I just shrug it off and move on to the next song. It's very therapeutic to learn how to do that."
WeAreTheMusicMakers,3e3abh,oscarcapaldi,2,Tue Jul 21 17:52:55 2015 UTC,Move on. Productivity diminishes the further along you go in one sitting IMO. Finish tracks during the morning with coffee or something.  Your ears need a rest. Sometimes you listen to something for 30 minutes and you don't even digest what you're hearing.
WeAreTheMusicMakers,3e3abh,panda_bro,2,Tue Jul 21 19:23:25 2015 UTC,If it's a performance error I'm not going to leave it. Right now I am about to go back and fix a vocal track that I recorded last week when I wasn't warmed up and also sang a couple lines out of time. Always worth it.
WeAreTheMusicMakers,3e3abh,etcomro,2,Tue Jul 21 19:37:35 2015 UTC,"I would definitely say move on, but personally speaking, I know how hard it is to NOT move on sometimes. For me, it is too easy to obsess about something I know won't be that much better right now. And just like someone else mentioned, I find that some of my best work was done quickly. You can always go back to it at another time so it's probably best to just move on to the next one. This is something that I am personally trying to do a better job of myself as well."
WeAreTheMusicMakers,3e3abh,dj0ldguy,2,Tue Jul 21 20:11:23 2015 UTC,"NEXT!!! It is the norm to make five ideas, and only finish one!

WeAreTheMusicMakers,3e3abh,jmm0495,2,Tue Jul 21 20:26:19 2015 UTC,My favourite tracks tend to come together in an afternoon and just keep growing legs by themselves.  The ones where I get stuck with an awesome verse then spend 2 weeks trying to write the chorus are the worst. Best thing is to return that killer verse to the compost pile and maybe it'll return from the dead in the future.
WeAreTheMusicMakers,3e2xh3,merkadoe,9,Tue Jul 21 15:31:43 2015 UTC,Almost sounds like the vox is run through a guitar amp or something with a bunch of spring verb added.

WeAreTheMusicMakers,3e2xh3,PrSqorfdr,2,Tue Jul 21 16:52:19 2015 UTC,I thought it might be something run through an amp.
WeAreTheMusicMakers,3e2xh3,tcookc,8,Tue Jul 21 18:43:17 2015 UTC,"the lead vocal sounds like it has a combination of these effects:  EQ - a severe low cut so that only the higher, tinnier frequencies are getting through  Saturation - either an overdrive, tube, or tape saturation effect. not enough to distort, but enough to artificially boost the mids that are cut out from the severe EQ  Reverb - it's pretty drenched in what sounds like a large hall reverb  playing with those three effects should get you a similar sound, but notice that there's a second, less effected, more sing-songy vocal that's doubling the lead part. the back up vocal definitely has a big impact on the overall sound."

The one thing I'll throw in is scoop the mids out of the reverb as much as you can without ruining it. Then it won't compete with the vocals for frequency range and you can add more of it."
WeAreTheMusicMakers,3e2xh3,TheBandIsRedHeaven,2,Tue Jul 21 17:45:27 2015 UTC,"Awesome, thank you!"
WeAreTheMusicMakers,3e2xh3,marinebiologist10,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:43:29 2015 UTC,"Definitely.  In addition to the scoop, I would low pass around 10k or so.  This way it's not interfering with the air in the vocal.  And sometimes a pre-delay (20ms-100ms) can help separate things."
WeAreTheMusicMakers,3e2xh3,Jimmyhangover,2,Tue Jul 21 21:06:39 2015 UTC,"All good points, though if you sculpt that reverb too much you start to lose the lo-fi sound (which might be a good thing, depending). :)"

There are a ton of great ones out there though. Aalto by Madrona Labs is modeled after a Buchla. It is super fun and sounds incredible. The Rob Papen synths are great too, Albino has an enormous mod matrix.   Sonic Charge makes some nifty lil ones like Symplant, which is pretty odd as far as how you program it. However, because the workflow is so unique, coming up with strange and new sounds is relatively easy.   You could also just get Reaktor. There's a fuckton of patches for it, including a virus emulation, nord emulations, and lots of weird and different effect modules.   Edit: Reaktor also has Monark, which is additional $ but it sounds sooooo gooooood."

I say this as someone who has used Windows machines exclusively in my own studio for years, but the larger facilities I've been to are usually all-mac. It took a third party (Steinberg) to create a decent standard for Windows. I would never use WDM for any critically application. And ASIO still kicks the pants off WASAPI in my experience.

WeAreTheMusicMakers,3e47l6,OutSanity,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:48:23 2015 UTC,"I went through almost the exact same thing you're describing here.    I'm a keyboardist / synth player, and my entrance into making music was by way of electronica and synth pop.  When I started looking into DAWs it seemed like everyone that I was talking to recommended Ableton.  Looking at it, it seemed exactly like what I wanted.  The clip view functions just like a looper, so it should be easy to just make a bunch of loops and assemble them into a song, right?  After a couple years of messing around with Ableton, and making HUNDREDS of tiny bullshit loops  that didn't fit each other thematically I realized that Ableton just isn't right for the kind of music that I want to make.  I don't want to make EDM loops, I want to write songs, and forcing myself to stick to the loop-based production method was killing my flow.  I hated the process of trying to take the loops and merge them into a song.  It almost always ended up feeling disjointed and weird.    I switch to Reaper, and have been much happier working in a multitrack environment without the loops of the Ableton clip view.  The looping structure of Ableton just didn't gel with me in a productive way.  To answer your question, I just work with whatever is driving me at the moment.  Sometimes I'm thinking about how I want the whole arrangement to sound, and that means I'll string a few chords together in piano, and then add a synth-lead track on top of that, and then jump down to the bass track and add something there and work towards layering up tracks over those few measures.  Other times I'll just start playing an instrument, and I'll record 3 or 4 minutes of messing around with one track, and then go back and figure out how I want to add to it with additional tracks.    That was a wall of text.  The TL;DR is that I thought looping would work for me, but it turns out it really didn't, so I ditched it in favor of a standard multitrack editor, and now I can just let stream-of-consciousness dictate my work.  I can still set an In and Out point and loop over it if I want to focus on one spot, but I'm not stuck working that way.    If you do want to stick with looping, have you tried Ableton?  I can't think of any DAW with a better interface for looping (mix it with an APC 40 and you have an awesome setup)."
WeAreTheMusicMakers,3e47l6,Explodicide,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:27:40 2015 UTC,"Okay, let's see if this helps you... I am a composer myself, and I record and produce my own songs. I use a music recorder (a TASCAM one) in order to record myself playing the tracks for the guitars and singing, and for now I use the bass and the drums of the DAW I use (Studio One 2). I write my songs on paper, but I use the DAW to build the song as if it were a LEGO :P I find this way of working very rewarding, because it allows for endless creativity while providing with very interesting effects and edits to the music.   However, I think the key point is to 'dream up' the song on paper, or on other music programmes like Guitar Pro, before going on to the DAW. It is a powerful programme, but it will not write the song for you :)"
WeAreTheMusicMakers,3e47l6,constantseeker,0,Tue Jul 21 22:48:06 2015 UTC,"Well...loops on your looper aren't songs, they are ideas and motifs. Do you want to write songs or do you enjoy making loops?   back in the day Louis Armstrong and his entire band all stood around in a room pointed at a big cone-like contraption and recorded a song in one take...no editing, madness!   So approach your DAW as a fancier cone-contraption or tape recorder.   Write the song first, old school with guitar pencil and paper, and then record it, as it seems you are trying to write with your DAW which isn't working for you.   If you can't write a song the old fashioned way, there are thousands of google searches that will point you in the right direction."
WeAreTheMusicMakers,3e44y7,ColonelSquirrel,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:30:11 2015 UTC,Can't go wrong with anything by Roland. Search Craigslist for Roland drums and you'll probably find some good deals. You'll definitely want a mesh snare pad for doing ghost notes and such.  You'll probably wanna get some drum sampling software like Toontrack EZ Drummer or Superior Drummer to use for the actual sounds because you wouldn't want to use the Roland brain's sounds for anything serious. There are tons of videos on Toontrack's website of Dirk playing their products with a Roland kit. He's very involved with that company.

Not to mention every recording engineer you will ever meet knows how to use it. If you are a travelling musician and you have a song your working on, on a drive, you can head to the nearest studio and start working...whereas, if you use another DAW you will have to prep, stems or output your individual tracks in order to have the same freedom...Sometimes being first has its advantages..."
WeAreTheMusicMakers,3e3cwr,D-Mass,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:53:16 2015 UTC,"ahh gotcha so from what I gather, it's just out of convenience and how readily available Pro Tools is in professional settings like Photoshop in the art world.

WeAreTheMusicMakers,3e3cwr,MladicAscent,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:08:11 2015 UTC,that's exactly what I was thinking too but I feel like there must be a reason why Pro Tools is the industry standard and I guess I'm tryin to see why that is. is it just happenstance in that it's been that way for years now or is there some quality that only Pro Tools has that other DAWs dont offer?
WeAreTheMusicMakers,3e3cwr,MladicAscent,0,Tue Jul 21 18:28:13 2015 UTC,"as far as the history of Pro Tools, it's the industry standard.  studios have built up a collection of plug-ins, their sessions are all created and ready for clients.  even if you write a song in Ableton,  you can bounce down every single track to a stereo/mono file all the same length so they line up, creating stem tracks.  Then they can take those and load them into Pro Tools (or basically any DAW) and the studio can do the mixing.    If you are comfortable using other programs, continue to use them and only explore Pro Tools in a way that you won't impact your current workflow.  ie if you only have one computer and you do all your music making on it, make sure you have good backups in case Pro Tools causes some issue."
WeAreTheMusicMakers,3e3cwr,baltimorebodies,2,Tue Jul 21 19:50:36 2015 UTC,"Pro-tool is way more efficient with handling audio. Making edits, mixing and mastering are all better done with pro tools. It also has a great video integration so it's super easy to cue sound to audio with it. The main avantage Ableton has over pt, it's is MIDI capacity(pt is sorta clumsy with handling midi). But then again you can rewire ableton into protool and just use it as your midi sequencer\synth rack."

WeAreTheMusicMakers,3e1e0c,spikewolf,5,Tue Jul 21 05:20:45 2015 UTC,"Generally, it goes rhythm instruments first. For me, it's usually drums>bass>synth pad/rhythm guitar, lead instrument, vocals last.   It's just easier to follow along. It's easier to play chords with drums/bass helping with the rhythm, and it's more fun to play to drums than a click."
WeAreTheMusicMakers,3e1e0c,randomthought9,2,Tue Jul 21 07:13:24 2015 UTC,"I find this order very ""native"" and truly right way to do music."
WeAreTheMusicMakers,3e1e0c,__69,2,Tue Jul 21 13:53:06 2015 UTC,"I primarily produce in the box but this is also my approach. Other times, I like to come up with a catchy melody with a lead guitar or synth, loop that, build drums on top of the loop and take it from there for the bells and whistles."
WeAreTheMusicMakers,3e1e0c,GeneralButtNekid,2,Tue Jul 21 17:33:15 2015 UTC,"Well, I don't record ""the old way"" atm, but I am a solo musician. When recording,  I am typically starting off with either a guitar riff to click, or programmed drum beat. Then I am basically working off of those two in tandem until the arrangment is finished. From there, I'll work on bass, strings/synths via MIDI controller, and add to taste. Stem out and mix from there.  If I get stumped somewhere early on with either guitar or drums, I'll work on alternate melodies or flushing out the arrangement on MIDI, bass, or sing a little something.  Typically, vocals almost always come last, however."
WeAreTheMusicMakers,3e1e0c,Graematter,2,Tue Jul 21 06:38:59 2015 UTC,"Whether it's with my full band (where I'm just a guitarist) or with my solo stuff, I usually start with scratch guitar recorded to a click. I usually add scratch vocals and sometimes bass before I track drums. Then I usually re-record bass, guitars and vocals in that order. It sounds like a lot of wasted effort, but I find that the scratch tracks help keep the drummer focused in the moment, because they don't have to constantly think about changes when they have cues from the scratch tracks. Plus, I usually build my scratch tracks using cut and paste: record a riff once, then fill out the song with cut and paste."
WeAreTheMusicMakers,3e1e0c,jrob1977,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:40:01 2015 UTC,"Depends on the song. If i want something tight to a tempo, I will generally map out the layout of a song and write those drum parts into midi abd then play guitar and bass to that. Then I'll add keys and eventually try to play live midi drums back in with the bass/guit to add a bit more realness back in. Then yeah vox, keys and the rest.  But the other 95% of the time I don't have anything mapped out and just play one instrument for an extended amount of time and forget what direction I was going with it"
WeAreTheMusicMakers,3e1e0c,doshie,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:06:17 2015 UTC,"Usually I'll lay down the guitar and vocals with a click as a scratch track first. Then I'll start with the rhythm instruments (drums, bass, acoustic) and then the lead instruments. Deleting the scratch tracks at some point in there. Since I write from an acoustic guitar I think that's the best way for me."
WeAreTheMusicMakers,3e1e0c,etcomro,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:46:42 2015 UTC,"Depends on what I'm feeling like playing / what has been bouncing around my head. I don't get hung up on small things like not wanting to play to a click or change what I played later. I start light though, if I can't get the groove I'm pushing for with just keys, vocals, drums Or keys, bass, drums, or other variations, I put it down for a little while and work on one of the other ideas flooding my brain. Then I listen to everything I've done that day and create more the next day."
WeAreTheMusicMakers,3e1e0c,baltimorebodies,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:35:11 2015 UTC,"Usually for me, I'll start with a guitar riff. Put it to a click track to find the tempo. Record, then replace the click with drums. Then I add bass to the drums and guitar. Then I add whatever else fits, second guitar parts, drum fills, synths, piano, shakers..whatever fills the song. Then I write vocals and bam, song. Some songs always have an exception but thats usually how I work."

You have to be really picky about the volume of the backing track.  And you need to create contrast.  Heavy compression can help it sit better, and some EQ (like removing lows, some upper mids and a treble) can make it sit better and sound more like one ""textured"" track.  Rather than two takes, with similar processing, both competing for the front."

Less is more - don't flood your mixes with effects and VSTs and dial back everything. Use references - mainly for mixing but try and match levels with big-name tracks you know sound good. Try and leave as much headroom as possible while you're tracking. Tweak presets, fiddle about with knobs so you get an idea of what they do."

Either way, I don't think that makes you a ""real"" musician. I have friends that don't count and don't know even a little bit of theory, but they've been playing for about 10 years, so they're pretty good at their instruments.

WeAreTheMusicMakers,3dzqmr,THE_HERO_OF_REDDIT,6,Tue Jul 21 16:22:12 2015 UTC,"I do, and I hate it. I walk rhythmically. I type rhythmically. I have a tick-tick-tick that never stops. It changes tempo to accommodate what I'm doing, of course - taking a stroll or playing my horn uses different kinds of tempi than the rather quick typing I'm doing right now.   Now, I don't think what I have is what you're asking about. I think what you mean is like a sense of rhythm? You don't have to have a sense of rhythm to be a musician, but you will have to work very hard to learn rhythm if you want to play at a high level. There's no shame in using a metronome when you practice or anything - everybody does that. You should know how to keep track of time. If your keeping track of time relies more on anticipation and context clues than a tick-tick-tick in your head, then that's fine. If you play in a band that has a dummer and a bassist, then they will set a basic tempo that you can rely on.   If you're a percussionist or play a bass instrument (like tuba, say) then tempo is essential, since you are giving the backbone for the rest of the ensemble."

WeAreTheMusicMakers,3e184k,Pouper,6,Tue Jul 21 04:21:23 2015 UTC,"There are a few things to keep in mind.   Pay attention to orchestration - in other words, carefully consider which notes should be played by which instrument or section, and in what voicing/octave. Let's say you have a 4 note chord. By writing those 4 notes close together in strings, it might sound OK. But double the low note with tuba and contrabassoon, the high note with flute, some harmonies with french horn and trumpet... you get the idea. You can make something sound way better simply by spreading notes across multiple instruments in the right ranges, and by using doubling. Vary your dynamics. For percussive instruments this means making your velocities realistic instead of fixed at a certain level. You can do this by playing them in live or just thinking about where you want accents to be in the rhythm. For sustained instruments, the modwheel usually controls dynamics, but if it doesn't, you can use simple volume automation to create swells (crescendos) and decrescendos. Even in epic and loud hybrid film scores, there are dynamics. It's that difference between the exciting highs and the subtle lows in volume that make a piece exciting. Use lots of dynamics + automation! Use reverb. Not to say there is one ""right"" setting or plugin for this, but a good reverb with a nice ""hall"" setting goes a long way. Dry orchestral samples usually sound really bad, as orchestras are always heard at something of a distance. Layer your libraries. Sometimes, even with the right reverb, orchestration, and automation, it's still not sounding great. So add more libraries! You can do this even with great freebie samples out there (for soundfont, SFZ, or Kontakt). For example, I love LA Scoring Strings... it's a very expensive, very powerful library that can be used by itself to great results. But I almost always end up layering in some strings from Omnisphere or even the old EWQL Gold orchestra to give it a little extra lushness and richness. It goes a long way. Play stuff in live wherever possible. It doesn't have to be great and you can always edit / quantize a bit later. There is just a big difference between a piece that has been mechanically sequenced to the grid and one where you play the parts in with your keyboard. Not to say that you can't get great results without a keyboard... it's all just MIDI in the end, so if you're willing to put the effort in to manually tweaking note timings and velocity, go for it. However, recording each part in live where possible will often provide a better result + faster."

WeAreTheMusicMakers,3e0wem,lazrbeam,5,Tue Jul 21 02:37:09 2015 UTC,"Think of working for free as an investment. You're investing your time and talent into a project. With that mindset, consider the risk vs. return on that investment. I don't just mean monetary return either - it could be any benefit you might enjoy.  Let's say someone wants you to write some music for their indie game. They have no budget. Should you work for free? That depends on how promising the game is, and if you think the developers seem like good people. You might invest 10-15 hours of your time writing a few minutes of music for free, in return for a % royalty on the game, and the ability to sell the soundtrack. You're also building a relationship with (maybe) promising developers that could go on to make more popular stuff - and come back to you for more music.  On the other hand, maybe someone asks you to do music for their indie film. They're pushy, demanding, and want you to write lots of music for free on a tight schedule. Your risk here is high - lots of potential time spent - but the return is low, since the director is likely not on a path to success if he can't treat his collaborators well.   If you decide to work for free or for a very low rate, make it CLEAR to the person you're working with that you are not working for nothing. Tell them your expectations. If it's a commercial project, you deserve some kind of backend, no questions asked. If other people stand to profit from the project, you do too. If it's a non-profit thing, you might say that you normally charge $xx/hour, but that you're willing to make an exception this time. It's important that you demonstrate how you value your work, and explain WHY you're working for free/cheap THIS time, but why you might not OTHER times."
WeAreTheMusicMakers,3e0wem,zirconst,3,Tue Jul 21 06:01:24 2015 UTC,"I am fortunate to have well paying clients (in the film/tv world). When they do personal projects, I am more than happy to help them out.  I think it has bolstered my relationships. We are doing the side indie thing together, so there is a sense of community, which in turn creates strong advocates for my business on high paying gigs. Seeing that people move around a lot, I am brought along to new places, which is nice.   It also creates a shorthand in our commercial ""real"" gigs that would be hard to achieve on the bigger, impersonal projects.  You start to know someone's perspective by seeing what they are passionate about putting their free-time into.   At this moment I am uploading a large video edit that I did, for my band, to have one of these friends do some free color timing and aftereffects for me.  I am essentially calling in a reciprocal favor, yet no one is keeping track. I have offered to pay, though I am 99.9% sure he will say I owe you.  I never do free work for the promise of work down the road from strangers or people who are not part of the machine that already pays me - I think that is BS.  Most of these people will hire someone else when they have a budget, not the guy who would do it for free.  A good way to scare these people away is ask them to sign an agreement that they will pay me my full rate on the free gig, if they book something and don't hire me for it."
WeAreTheMusicMakers,3e0wem,tzujan,2,Tue Jul 21 04:03:37 2015 UTC,"Money isn't the only reward or compensation you can get from making music. Just make sure that what you're getting is worth something, and you can't get it elsewhere for some greater reward. For instance, you want to score films? No one is gonna pay you to score their film if you have zero experience. There are exceptions to this but in my experience, everyone who does film score starts out by scoring a few projects for free.   So you get experience, you get something for your reel, and a client who can recommend you. Sometimes it makes more sense to work on project that is amazing, that will raise your profile and your game, but doesn't pay, vs. making something on a project that doesn't challenge you, that you don't want on your reel.   Once you're established, you may find it necessary to demo for a project to reassure the director you can do exactly what she wants. I do this all the time despite being established, but it generally pays off.  The point is don't be dogmatic about money vs. no money, think about the totality of what you're getting out of the work. This is all about film scoring (the only thing that's ever made me money as a musician) but it can apply to gigging, session work, etc."

WeAreTheMusicMakers,3dzbfu,Decesus,7,Tue Jul 21 00:42:59 2015 UTC,"To kind of echo the sentiments here - it's really tough to make a living at music - consider how many complete orchestras graduate from the major conservatories every year. Then there's all the secondary schools that have a handful of performance majors that go into the market as well.  On the other hand, programmers are in demand, and the money is still good.  A bunch of years ago I was deciding between a music major or a CS major. Pondering a music habit on a computer salary vs a computer habit on a music salary.  That became a no-brainer, especially seeing how hard my teachers were working to get enough gigs to earn a living (as well as doing a lot of teaching, and side-jobs).  Now I make a good living, and I have a pretty active community music life - four regular groups, and I get calls frequently to sub for concerts. I've got a good enough reputation that sometimes they say ""hey, you can sight-read the gig"", so I certainly don't lack for playing these days :-)  Both music and CS are time-consuming majors. You might want to investigate the school to see if you can participate in music stuff without having to have a major or minor.  I went to a fairly small liberal-arts school, and got to do a lot of playing (musicals, recitals, college band, basketball games...)"

Music performance is kind of like studying a sport, I find it quite uncreative, your intentley focused on this one instrument trying to be the best piano player in town, it's hard to make money unless you really are the shit like.  I study production and it's great very creative and open minded, you get to learn a whole variety of things rather than just being limited to one instrument, and you learn your way round a computer which is essential these days. If your in anyway creative then production is the best one to go for.  Some carrers to think about teaching, composing (for games, tv etc), production, live sound, recording engineer etc, but tbh you gotta know the people to get anywhere really so thats the most important thing to do get out there and make contacts, and good luck :D"

Go meet as many people as you can who are doing music/what you want.  Go to open mics, become friendly with sound guys, the people who run the venues, meet and jam with musicians around your area.  Even though you might not come back or see them, maybe they know someone who can help you out down the line - and maybe that person gets you your first paying gig or opens the final door you need to make it."
WeAreTheMusicMakers,3dzbfu,Smokey_Jah,3,Mon Jul 20 20:31:19 2015 UTC,Any advice we give is to be taken with a grain of salt.  I think there's many jaded people here who wish they had done more with the music side of themselves.  I know I feel that way.  I would advise you to take all the business courses you can stand.  Guys who do well in the music business seem to know how to put business first.  Just don't forget to practice along the way.
WeAreTheMusicMakers,3dzbfu,Sinborn,3,Mon Jul 20 21:52:43 2015 UTC,"I started off studying music and then switched to computer science and now am back in music again. Here's my thoughts on it.  First of all, realize you're young and have a hell of a long time to study different things and experience life. High Schools tend to pressure you into thinking you need to have your life plan set by the time you graduate when you really don't. There's nothing wrong with switching majors, taking time off, working etc.   The lifestyle of making a living from music is incredibly rewarding and fun but is also very stressful and will probably not be very lucrative. For me I know that I would be miserable sitting in a cubicle for 40+ hours a week typing code. So much so that I'm willing to except the fact that I'll probably never be able to afford a sports car, swimming pool or take a Hawaiian vacation every year. Understanding what type of lifestyle you want to live and having a partner that supports you in that is incredibly important. This of course is something that will come with time and is going to change as the years go by. Realize that the dreams you have at 18 are going to be different when you're 21, 25, 30 etc. and don't feel bad that they change.   Studying music can be incredibly rewarding and a lot of fun. It can also be incredibly stressful and time consuming. I recommend taking just some basic theory and ear training classes. Theory and ear training will probably help you the most as a musician and producer and can be a lot of fun. Best of all you can usually take these classes at a community college. The most fun I've had with my education was the two years I spent studying theory and playing in jazz band at a community college.  Being a performance major is intense and I would only recommend it if you want to dedicate your life to your instrument. It's incredibly competitive and you'll spend most of your free time practicing and the rest of it in performances or competitions (depending on your instrument and focus). If you want to be a professional orchestral player(which is one of the most difficult things to do as a musician) or teach your instrument at a professional level this is the route to go.  Music production is not really worth it to study in a college setting. There's almost nothing you can't learn for free online, just pick the program you want and you'll find tons of great tutorials online. Having a degree offers little advantage to getting a job at a studio (which is also next to impossible). It's all based on who you know and how good you are, but who you know is the most important part.  Computer science is of course the ""smarter"" route, but realize that's not a walk in the park either. It's becoming one of the most crowded majors and unless you've been learning how to code since you were a kid, you'll probably be way behind; even in beginning classes. If you have little to no knowledge of programming definitely learn the basics of a language (usually Java or C++) on your own ahead of time. You should be able to write your own basic scripts confidently before entering a course. Those courses tend to move really quickly and it's easy to get left behind or buried in the work.  With all of that being said it is definitely possible to make a living with music. Especially with the amount of instruments you play. Here's some of the most common ways to make a living. Especially when you're young and don't have a family to support. Also note, all of these don't require any formal education, though it could help.   A steady gig like playing in a church is usually a small but reliable source of income. Realize that you can and should get paid for doing it.  Cover and show bands make a lot more than you may realize. If you're good enough and can get on with the right band you can pull $300+ dollars a night.  Giving lessons is of course the cornerstone of making money as a musician. It's something that will be semi reliable and will give you extra income in the fall and winter which is nice because shows tend to dry up outside of spring and summer. With a decent home studio (which can be built for relatively cheap) and a good ear you can do recordings for local bands on the cheap. Eventually if you're good enough and have some success you can grow this into something more.   Hope this helped you at all. You're entering in an exciting era of your life and don't let it intimidate you. Maybe try to make a living as a musician for a while and if it's not for you go to school for something more reliable, or get a degree that'll get you a job and then take some time off to try it.  Either way don't let your passion fall to the wayside because you're worried that you have to make this decision right now."

Is the smartest course of action majoring in something safe, but still participating/maybe minoring in music while in college?     Precisely. Major in whatever, hang out with the music geeks. You can take music classes as a non-major, probably lessons and a few ensembles. Go to recitals, concerts, talk to them after. Totally what I would do now, instead of getting a Master's from NEC."

Going to take things one at time -    Should I try to do music performance?   The first thing to ask yourself is how passionate you are about your instrument, because you're going to beat it to death.   Beyond that, this is tough to answer because there's a lot of ways this can go - some that end in a comfortable career and many that don't. Do you want to play in a major metropolitan ensemble? A studio musician? Touring musician? Private teacher? Any interest in bleeding-edge modern composition? Pit orchestras? Anyway you go, the competition will be fierce.   The majority of performance majors I know ended up in music education, but I also know plenty of stage performers, composers, session musicians, etc. who came from this background too.   It's important to note that amongst the people I know who work in music (at least the ones that didn't go into traditional education) it's rare to do just one thing - they'll do session work, work on arrangements, song-writing, teach some lessons, dabble in some production stuff, synth programming, do some music supervision, etc.   Music production?   Absolutely not.   Major in something else entirely like computer science and attempt to do music on the side?   This is hands down the safest and most responsible (financially and otherwise) way for you to go. Thumbs up from me.    Double major or Major/minor in something music related and something that might have more available jobs?   Also a great idea (but double majoring can be no joke, depending on the pairing). I'm very encouraging of any route that provides you with some kind of fall back should a music career become unsustainable.    What sort of careers might be available that I should think about that I may or may not know about?   This kind of depends. Would you have interest in audio related  jobs that might be a little far away from music? Like editing or mixing at a post-production house? Working for a radio show? TV production facility? Music editor?  Any interest in stuff like advertising? Publicity? Booking? Working for a label?"

The odds that you'll end up in a professional production environment with a music production degree are just about the same as the odds that you'll end up there without one.

Many of the most successful and best musicians I know have taken this route. Other tips: 1. Stay single 2. Don't have kids Most of my successful music friends gig a lot because they can stay out, hang out with other players, go to everyone's gigs, buy them drinks, etc. That's as important as being able to play well. Also: 3. Have a day job. Can't overstress this. You won't be able to make a living off music for a long time, if ever. You probably won't even make enought to buy gear or a new horn.

WeAreTheMusicMakers,3dzbfu,superkoop,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:17:40 2015 UTC,The short answer? Start making as much music as you can while you're still in school. The long answer? Refer to other comments they all seem pretty knowledgeable.

With maybe a couple exceptions, no. If you want to stay in academia/teaching, then a college-level music education might be worth it, for example if you get a scholarship.  The best connections are people who are performing and creating music, not teaching it. And they're unlikely to be in college.  Like others have commented, music is a terrible career choice, but a wonderfully rewarding hobby.  The best piece of music advice I ever got was ""don't be a musician because you want to be one, be a musician because you have to, because there is nothing else in the world that you're remotely good at."""

But ultimately realized it wasn't worth all the hassle of keeping up with core classes..I'm not great in academic settings.  Also, I sincerely doubt many, if any, of my musical heroes had a music degree.    As I'm sure everyone's saying...  it boils down primarily to work ethic.  How much do you want this goal?  What will you sacrifice for it?   You need to be working on it, progressing towards your goal, every single day.  You'll need to start declining invites from family and friends, because that time isn't getting you closer to your goal.  And your goal is nearly impossible to attain.    At some point, you'll get caught up in 'perfection' and a lot of time will go by with no results.  Step back, take a deep breath, then start practicing proliferation.  Practice finishing ideas.  Practice deadlines.  Hone your craft.  Construct a workflow and tweak it as needed.  It's ok if it's not perfect because you'll get better and better the more you do it."

My advice is to SERIOUSLY think hard about it. Six months ago I thought I had it all figured out. My calculus and physics grades were struggling to keep my gpa while my music life was progressing and flourishing. I told everyone I was ditching the idea of a degree in Mechanical Engineering to pursue Music Education. Now I've been up all night this past week trying to figure out how I'm gonna compete with all the other qualified individuals in the market and pay for a $60,000 degree when I'll only make maybe $25,000 coming out. And that's if I land a job that would use the music ed degree. I thought about being a professional musician as well but that's even more schooling that I don't and won't have money for. I've been doing a lot of thinking I wish I had done a year ago but I guess that's what I get for being irresponsible. Props to you for already starting to plan rather than wait.   If you do go the cs route (actually what I'm planning as a back up plan!) you'll still be able to participate in plenty of musical scenes in college, whether it be school bands or projects of your own. Talk to professors in AND students in both fields to find out their thinking and reasons with choosing their degrees."

WeAreTheMusicMakers,3dzbfu,Slyth3rin,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:38:54 2015 UTC,"I think it's really important for you to try to figure out exactly what kind of career you want from music. Personally, I want to be a touring musicians, playing my songs solo or in a band. For that reason, majoring in music wouldn't help me much, but picking a good 'fall back' major, in my case actuarial sciences, seems like a smart idea. I'm actually in two minors (computer science and finance) along with my major, and I still have plenty of time to pursue music (writing, recording and performing). I really have very little interest in anything I'm studying, but it's good to know I won't have to worry too much about finding work in the future, and I am learning skills directly translatable to my music on the business side. At the very least, once I make it or will be a good story to tell.   If you really want to be a producer, you're most likely going to need to go to school specifically for that. I have no idea how likely it is to turn that major into a career, but the odds of you making it there without majoring in it are extremely low.   Long story short, like everyone else, I'd say to pick a non-music major, but to pursue your music just as strongly as you would if it was your major, on your own. You should honestly think of it as your second major."

In that sense its helped me tremendously while mixing and in life in general, though even as a kid, I've always thought like that.  In terms of specific one to one knowledge, I've learned about how sound waves travel (or rather propagate) in the physics course ""mechanics of waves and light"", which I took some of this knowledge to treat my studios.  In terms of math, the Fourier transform is the basics of how Digital Signal Processing works as well as A/D and D/A. I had a course on electric circuits where in the labs we played with oscilloscopes, and there I learned how the waveforms in analog synths were generated and how CV works. I've been dabbling in some Industrial Engineering courses since I think I might change my discipline this year, and there I learned about listening levels, Fletcher's curve (I actually told the prof about that one), effects of lighting. I took and IE course in plant design - I used the guidelines of that course to design my new studio (in terms of anthropometrics). I even have a paper I wrote for an ergonomics course somewhere discussing how un-ergonomic everything about the mixing engineer's job and work area is. (got 95% on that).  The profs never told me how what they were teaching was related to music, I connected the dots myself.  EDIT: I had a course on control signals where we actually dealt with Mu, FET, and Opto compressors, the rest of the class was confused, I was laughing. Good old Fairchild 670!"
