Yosemite,3e5p4p,deadhappypotamous,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:52:14 2015 UTC,The Merced above Nevada falls doesn't dry up and is a reliable water source.  There also likely is still water at Sunrise Creek just past the Half Dome/JMT junction. (And possibly a trickle from the spring on the Half Dome spur)
Yosemite,3e5p4p,jakdak,1 point,Wed Jul 22 04:38:45 2015 UTC,Much appreciated!
Yosemite,3e5p4p,forestplay,1 point,Wed Jul 22 04:48:24 2015 UTC,I was in Little Yosemite Valley last week. There was plenty of water all the way to Merced Lake.
Yosemite,3e5nsn,titty-sprnkles,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:39:50 2015 UTC,"How secluded? North dome might be nice, less crowded than cloud's rest but you wouldn't have guaranteed solitude. Stellar views for sure. If you left quite early in the morning you'd see less people and also have nice morning light."
Yosemite,3e5nsn,korravai,1 point,Wed Jul 22 05:05:38 2015 UTC,"So many choices, but here are 2 suggestions:  Snow Creek Trail, on the point just west of Snow Creek Falls. There will be few, if any people there. Half Dome is in your face, Tenaya Canyon, Clouds Rest, Basket Dome, just awesome views in every direction.  Mt. Hoffman. There will be other people up there, but the summit plateau is huge and you can easily be alone. Views are amazing."
Yosemite,3e36oh,cbg,2,Tue Jul 21 16:37:18 2015 UTC,Skeeters should be mostly gone this August.  Seasonal streams will be dry.  Hopefully the place won't be on fire.

Yosemite,3dpphs,transponster99,3,Sat Jul 18 17:25:05 2015 UTC,"Take the JMT from Tuolumne to the Valley. 6 days is a perfect amount of time, especially if you're trying to include Cloud's Rest and Half Dome.

Yosemite,3dpphs,transponster99,2,Sat Jul 18 18:51:28 2015 UTC,Will map it out today and take a look! Thanks so much!
Yosemite,3dpphs,RealRocketScientist,3,Sat Jul 18 19:27:21 2015 UTC,"It sounds like you are going to be backpacking, so keep in mind that you need a wilderness permit, and permits out of Tuolumne meadows are some of the most popular. Some trailheads fill up every day in August. Here's the full trailheads report, which is updated every couple days: http://www.nps.gov/yose/planyourvisit/upload/fulltrailheads.pdf  You can try for a walk-up permit, but you might not get the trailhead you want. Also, when you reserve your wilderness permit, you need to make sure you reserve a permit to hike Half Dome. They set aside some of the daily quota for backpackers."
Yosemite,3dp5iq,LordShittington,5,Sat Jul 18 02:49:51 2015 UTC,"I do not see why they would hassle you unless you set up camp. They sure can not give you a ticket for what they think you might do. All you have to do is tell them what you told us. I am training with a full pack for real trips.  Of course someone else suggested trading some equipment out for beers- I though that was a good idea.  I have no idea why anyone would try to persuade you not to follow your plan, unless that are a bit paranoid.   I say have a good hike !"
Yosemite,3dp5iq,maxillo,2,Sat Jul 18 06:05:26 2015 UTC,"If the rangers are doing permit checks, they will usually do so by checking folks who are obviously equipped for overnights while still on the trail.  They generally aren't going to hunt folks down at their campsites during night hours.  I'd second the recommendation of filling the pack with water weight and leaving out the sleeping gear so as to have plausible deniability in case you get stopped.  The wilderness permit regulations would basically be unenforceable if all anyone needed to do was claim they weren't going to be out overnight."
Yosemite,3dp5iq,jakdak,3,Sat Jul 18 16:57:02 2015 UTC,"I have never had encounters like that with rangers, but that is not to say it can't happen. But it is kind of like Minority Report and pre-crime.  I guess you could call the park and talk to a ranger to be sure."
Yosemite,3dp5iq,maxillo,3,Sat Jul 18 17:22:26 2015 UTC,"I did this when training for my Shasta climb.  I had zero issue.  I was also on the regular popular routes near/around the valley.  I bet if you hiked 15+ miles in to the back country and tried to explain you were just doing a training day hike, it may raise a few eye brows :P.  I've met others on popular day hike routes with large packs doing the same thing as well.   EDIT: To clarify: there is a lot of good points about camping gear and convincing a ranger you are not staying over night.  And rangers are also only likely to stop you on the more popular trails leaving the valley, I suppose."
Yosemite,3dp5iq,Itendtolurk,-2,Sat Jul 18 15:28:05 2015 UTC,"I don't think they'll believe you. You could pack it with other stuff, and then show them?  If you don't have a tent/food/sleeping bag, they'd probably believe that you're not spending the night.  Next year is so far away, how much worth is any training now?  Maybe just enjoy your day hikes regular style, and hit up a bunch of day hikes/overnights with your real pack setup later this year and into the winter."
Yosemite,3dp5iq,GoNorthYoungMan,4,Sat Jul 18 02:52:45 2015 UTC,"I was just reading an article on rescues and a quote from the article states: ""None were prepared to spend a night out and most did not have headlamps or whistles to help rescuers locate them.""  It seems strange that they would chide lost hikers for not being prepared while also preventing them from dayhiking with a full pack.  Thoughts?   Also getting time off from work is nearly impossible and I'll only really be able to start training when I quit my job, which won't be till sometime in December or beyond."
Yosemite,3dp5iq,GoNorthYoungMan,2,Sat Jul 18 02:57:55 2015 UTC,"You can be prepared for a night out without having all your gear.  Consider a mountain day hike kit of puffy coat, headlamp, beanie, whistle, first aid kit, rain jacket and maybe pants, long underwear, bit of extra food and so on, and unless its very cold, you would not be that uncomfortable if you had to sleep out.   I think the cutoff is adding sleeping bag and pad, tent, bear canister, a stove, food for days etc.  But those people also probably went off trail and didn't know what they were doing in terms of distance/water/fitness/direction on top of not being ready.  If I were going to Yosemite for dayhikes, I'd bring a decent day hike kit like that, and try to safely challenge myself in terms of elevation gain, and maybe distance in a day, more than carrying weight.  But why not just go on an overnight trip?  Walk-ups can still find things last minute, you are just choosing from the less popular selection."
Yosemite,3dp5iq,GoNorthYoungMan,4,Sat Jul 18 03:06:51 2015 UTC,I'll be there with visiting family so I won't be able to go off overnight.  I do want to have my pack weigh close to what I expect to have on the PCT and I'm used to the distances and climbs with the pack.  I suppose I'm just gonna have to ditch any overnight looking gear and probably carry extra water for weight.

Yosemite,3dp5iq,jakdak,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:19:53 2015 UTC,"I was going to suggest adding weight from filled water bottles. If it gets too heavy, you can fix the weight easily by pouring it out...and you'll never go thirsty!!  Rangers WILL be out looking for permits. Wilderness impact is a very large concern of theirs this year, but they can't realistically measure anything unless they know who's out there."
Yosemite,3dp5iq,beefofages,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:22:47 2015 UTC,"This.  You don't need full camping gear to be prepared for an inadvertent bivy.  A headlamp is, IMHO, mandatory for any hike.

Yosemite,3dou0t,Waspbee,4,Sat Jul 18 01:03:04 2015 UTC,"With all the trail options in the park, why do a route that is a) duplication of part of your planned Half Dome route and b) going to be ungodly crowded?  2) Mist trail is shorter, JMT is more easily graded.  Both will be zoos.  3) These are wilderness freeways.    4) Mosquitoes will likely be completely gone by mid August- especially this season"
Yosemite,3dou0t,jakdak,2,Sat Jul 18 01:44:33 2015 UTC,"Wow,  thanks for your quick response! I see your points, but I have a few reasons  This trip will be somewhat of a big deal for me.  I am doing it alone to ponder things that have happened in my life recently.  I am actually more comfortable knowing there will be other people because frankly,  I am kind of afraid of the woods, backcountry and wilderness. I am doing this trip to push my limits.  2 years ago I was almost dead.  I promised myself I would push my limits more and this is part of my bucket list.  Maybe some day I will do larger,  more remote backpacking trips,  but for now this is exactly what I am looking for.    And the no mosquito part really is the cherry on top  :)   Thanks again for your time and also good to know I will be able to make good time on the freeways heh!   Cheers!"
Yosemite,3dou0t,jakdak,4,Sat Jul 18 01:58:18 2015 UTC,You might also want to consider doing the 4 mile part first- the steep switchbacks are easier footing uphill and you'll want to do that when you are fresh and its not yet too hot.
Yosemite,3dou0t,jakdak,2,Sat Jul 18 02:04:52 2015 UTC,"Ok,  thanks for the input. I might have to review my plans for this though because I will not have a car and I don't want to wait for the el capitan shuttle to start... Maybe I will walk the 3 miles before.

Yosemite,3dou0t,transponster99,2,Sat Jul 18 02:14:27 2015 UTC,"Hmm, thats a judgement call.  Not sure what I'd do.  (Other than consider hiking up Snow Creek instead which is an easy walk from th campgrounds.  Not a loop tho- unless you want to do Snow Creek to Yosemite Falls)"

Yosemite,3dou0t,jakdak,2,Sat Jul 18 13:41:45 2015 UTC,"Snow Creek to Yosemite Falls is a great loop, and about 20 miles. Going up (or down) the Snow Creek trail, you will be mostly alone. Going up (or down) the Yosemite Falls trail, there will be a million people. In between you will encounter some hikers, especially near North Dome. The view from the point near Snow Creek Falls is amazing (staring straight at Half Dome) and North Dome is amazing as well. I've done this loop as both a 1 and 2 night backpacking trip, and the thought of doing it as a day hike makes my knees hurt, but it is an awesome hike."

Yosemite,3dh6tr,IPaintMyNailsBlue,1 point,Thu Jul 16 06:20:51 2015 UTC,"Yosemite is one of the most popular tourist spots in the Western U.S. during the summer. Camp sites are normally reserved months in advance and the first come first served are regularly occupied unless you get very very lucky. The park is one of the country's largest, and while it might seem fun, going off the beaten path is not a good idea. Especially if you are unfamiliar with where you are going or plan to hike.  As for overnight hiking, I would not recommend doing it unless you have experience in the past, are familiar with the park trails, or have a guide. Primarily because there is much to be considered when going, such as how many liters of water, food, and clothing you will need to carry, as well as sleeping bags or a tent. Also, you'll have to account for the weather since the park can go from cold (5c) to hot (33c) within 24 hours and it does rain. Less than a month ago, the valley was 34c and humid, while only a few days ago, it snowed in another part of the park. There is also an elevation factor to be careful of if you plan on hiking from the valley up to the crest or higher trails. Not having the proper gear can be very dangerous and people do get hurt regularly when they are not careful. Be sure to have good hiking shoes, sunscreen, and water no matter where you go. As for the other questions, I would suggest checking out the Yosemite National Park Youtube Page, and call the phone number they post, or contact the rangers service here.   If you want my personal recommendation, it is best to stay outside of the park in one of the other regional camping areas such as Inyo or El Portal, but that all depends on which direction you are coming from. Visit this page for assistance. These places are just as nice as Yosemite, have their own trails, are quieter, and are often cheaper than the park. Most also have a host on site as well to help with getting settled or if you are struggling. You can drive into the park on a daily basis and decide what hikes or landmarks you want to visit from there. Places like Yosemite Falls and the visitors center are great places to start in the morning and go from there. And while going off path does seem like a cool idea, be honest about what your abilities are and what you really want to see. Start and the Rangers station if you are not sure about a hike, or what sites to see, and take your time. Rushing to do something often causes accidents and makes for bad experiences.   All together, you should have a great time, just again, have a plan for yourself before you get there. If you are looking for what to take with you or how to prepare, check out Youtube again for some fundamentals on equipment and recommendations. Lots of people visit the California wilderness year round, enjoy it while you can, and most of all, be safe while out there.   Keep us posted and good luck."
Yosemite,3dh6tr,LDexter,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:57:22 2015 UTC,"Wow, that's precious advice thank you so much! I wasn't aware of the youtube chanel and its great!  Sleeping rough seemed like a fun and exciting thing to do, but maybe I'm underestimating yosemite completely. Back in France its easy-ish to spend a night out in the wild with just a bivy bag, water and a couple of canned food, is this unrealistic for yosemite?  We were planning on checking Inyo park as well as we have ten days to do the Yosemite, Kings and Sequoia area, but it might be a good idea to go there to spend the night, thanks!  Lastly, if, as you advice, we only stick to day-long hikes, do we need a wilderness permit?  Thanks in advance :)"
Yosemite,3dh6tr,jakdak,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:05:19 2015 UTC,"Lastly, if, as you advice, we only stick to day-long hikes, do we need a wilderness permit?   Nope.  (With the exception of the Half Dome summit)"
Yosemite,3dh6tr,cbg,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:21:33 2015 UTC,"Any chance somebody can share his favourite two days hike that will allow us to a bit of solitude?   There are many great, short backcountry routes.  I did a two-nighter from Tenaya Lake to Clouds Rest to Happy Isles.  You'd need a permit to enter at Tenaya Lake and you should note that ascending Half Dome now requires a special permit (as does camping in Little Yosemite Valley).  Clouds Rest is amazing, though and has a better view (with fewer people) than Half Dome, even if the climb isn't so dramatic and unique.  You could also skip the crowds with a hike from the Ten Lakes Trailhead into Grant Lakes.  This is a less-populated part of the park and you should note that it has more bear activity than some area.  Cathedral Lakes, May Lake, Grand Canyon of the Tuolumne, and other spots also offer accessible backcountry camping.  You'll be more successful getting permits for permits for weekdays (not Friday).  Note that once you have a backcountry permit you're relatively unrestricted in where you hike and camp (there are some basic regulations re: camping near established trails, campgrounds, and roads).   any tips for finding the right place to camp? what's the minimal camping gear we can get away with?   Regarding sites: If you're near roads, trailheads, or campgrounds, there are rules about camping in established sites.  In the backcountry, you pick your own site and try to minimize your impact.  Beyond that, selecting a safe and comfortable site is a large topic.  Regarding gear: I think this is highly dependent on preference and experience.  I think the only regulation is that you have to use acceptable containers to prevent bears from getting your food (""bear cans"" can be rented at the wilderness permit-issuing centers).  Other than that, what to pack for a backpacking trip is too large a topic for a comment.  Note that some outdoors stores will rent out gear, which might be useful for you given that you're coming from abroad.  You should check out /r/Campingandhiking for loads of info.   wilderness permits :how/when do you ask for one, how do you chose the right trailhead to put on the form, and what's a trailhead exaclty?   You can request a permit in advance (you can call or submit a form via fax or mail) or you can do a walk-up permit.  Each trailhead has a daily quota for how many backpackers can enter the wilderness from that trailhead.  Something like 60% of the quota is reservable spots and 40% is walk-up spots (not reservable).  A trailhead is where a trail into the backcountry meets a road, campground, etc.  You have to draw a permit for the trailhead where you'll enter the backcountry (exit is unrestricted, and you can camp anywhere that complies with regulations).  Good luck!"
Yosemite,3dgzqk,Yungtwist,2,Thu Jul 16 04:59:43 2015 UTC,"Camp 4 is the recommended because it's the only walk-up in the valley. The valley is awesome but honestly, I'd suggest trying for Tuolumne Meadows. You can drive down to the valley for a day (which you should) but you have awesome access to some other hikes:  (1) Day hike to Cathedral Lakes pictures.  (2) Cloud's Rest from Sunrise Creek  (3) Along the Grand Canyon of the Tuolumne  And then do one day in the valley; Yosemite Falls or Happy Isles for the traditional Yosemite Hikes. For the traditional views, you can't be the valley. But for the real Yosemite experience, the above ones are just as nice or better."
Yosemite,3dgzqk,UCLACommie,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:02:15 2015 UTC,Hey if I go to T Meadows next Tuesday do you think I get camp spot. I just wanna stay one night. Thanks
Yosemite,3dgzqk,nutellaeater,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:46:35 2015 UTC,"Are you looking for a car camping spot, or are you looking to backpack (you mention overnight hikes)?  For car camping, half of the sites at Tuolumne Meadows are available first-come-first-served, as well as all of Camp 4, and Yosemite Creek. You also might have luck if you try to make a reservation for one of the less popular campgrounds like Hodgdon Meadow.  For backpacking, half of the permits are reservable and half are walk-up. Some trailheads are very popular and fill up every day during the summer. Here's the full trailheads report, which is updated every couple days or so: http://www.nps.gov/yose/planyourvisit/upload/fulltrailheads.pdf  IF you are planning on backpacking and IF you are able to reserve a permit in advance, you can spend the night before your trip ($5/person) at the walk-in backpackers' campground at either Tuolumne Meadows or in the Valley next to the North Pines campground. No reservations are required for these campgrounds, but you have to have a wilderness permit or at least a reservation confirmation. You can also stay there the day after your backpacking trip (the exit date on your permit)."
Yosemite,3dg9ll,Jozy164,2,Thu Jul 16 01:06:18 2015 UTC,"I usually start waterless and plan on filling up at the faucet near the Vernal falls bridge.  And I'll bring repelling gloves for the cables.  Other than that its my standard daypack and the same thing I'd carry for any other ~20 mile High Sierra on-trail route.

Yosemite,3dg9ll,ben_gardner,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:29:29 2015 UTC,"I'll add the bring a water filter.  1lb of extra weight is a small price to pay for an extra gallon or so above Nevada Fall on my way up to the top.  Got a little more at the spring closer to the summit too, but I wouldn't count on it being wet.  Filling up at the Vernal Falls footbridge as Jakdak suggested is a great idea.  No need to haul water up any farther than you have to.  (Personally, I consumed 2.5 gallons of water the time I did the half dome hike and was still dehydrated - it was a pretty hot day though too.  I carried a 1 gallon camelbak sort of thing, along with a 750ml bottle.  Went through at least about two of each.)"

Be sure to dump out the training water for the descent to be nice on your knees- doing down fast has very little to do with how fit you are and only increases the risk to ankle rolls.   If you are comfy with 25% of your body weight, you will be rocking it with your lighter pack the day of.   I have extensive packing and gear lists too if you are interested PM me.   Glad to help!"
Yosemite,3deh5w,zauzau,3,Wed Jul 15 17:14:27 2015 UTC,Just watch for the cairnes and pick the correct chute up to the ridge. Not a terribly difficult outing if you stay on route. The correct route heads left (away from the summit) at the head of the canyon.  Bail at the first sign of thunderstorm activity- you don't want to be on the Conness ridge during a storm.

It has river access, showers, and a laundry place, but if you're only staying three days you may not need all that. Curry Village is pretty similar, but it's harder to get to the river and you can't make fires there. I feel like these two are easiest if you don't want to full on camp. You pretty much just need some ice chests, some bedding and other essentials and you're good to go. You can find a multitude of day hikes and activities to do in the valley"

Not having to drive for an hour out of the Valley at the end of the day when I'm tired for a little extra $$ is worth it for me. Also, consider Yosemite Lodge. It's not cabins but if you're looking for hotel like accommodations in the Valley, this is it. Lastly, I'm not sure if you were looking at the hard sided cabins at Curry Village, yes those are very expense. The ""tent"" cabins are cheaper and barely considered camping. There is linens with pillows on the beds, bathrooms with showers nearby, and fresh towels each day. It's really close to all the major sights and walking distance to the pizza deck and small grocery store for food."

Yosemite,3da3n4,SmallVillage,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:43:10 2015 UTC,"There are several campgrounds that don't require reservations, but you will have to get there early in the morning. Camp 4 in the valley (probably the hardest to get), Yosemite Creek, and Tuolumne Meadows all have first-come-first-served sites, or you might have luck getting a reservation at one of the less popular campgrounds like Hodgdon Meadow.  If you are willing to hike your stuff in a mile, you might be able to get a wilderness permit for the backpacker's campground at May Lake. But keep in mind that you need a wilderness permit to camp there or anywhere else in the backcountry, and there are a lot of rules regarding where you can camp, protecting your food from bears, etc."
Yosemite,3d8kqk,Schnutzel,1 point,Tue Jul 14 10:12:16 2015 UTC,"Hmm. I suppose one day in the valley is sufficient if you're not really hiking anywhere. You're going to have issues with a hotel room, though. Unless you're very well off and can afford the Ahwanee, you're looking at about an hour drive each way in and out to stay in one of the neighboring towns.   Driving to Sequoia is going to be pretty far out of your way. I'd recommend just hiking out to Tuolumne Grove.   And yes, if you're that limited on time, I'd spend more time in the valley, and less in the high country."
Yosemite,3d8kqk,AmishAvenger,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:40:42 2015 UTC,"I'd recommend just hiking out to Tuolumne Grove.   You could also hit Muir Woods, Big Basin, or Calaveras out of SFO.  The latter would best be done as a side trip on your way to Yosemite."

Yosemite,3d8kqk,SmallVillage,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:30:03 2015 UTC,"Stay in the tent cabins at Curry Village, you're right in the middle of everything. I would spend 2 days in the Valley and 1 in Tuolumne. Day 1, drive the Valley floor loop and see all the sights, then drive up to Glacier Point. Get dinner at the Pizza Deck at Curry Village. Day 2, get up early, get a fast breakfast and do a hike before it gets hot. If you start around 7-8 you will beat the heat and more importantly beat the crowds, plan to be done by 12 noon. In the afternoon, go swimming a relax. Day 3, do Tuolumne Meadows. Construction traffic starts around 7am, so if you get up early you will save yourself an hour of traffic."

It's also quite likely that the campgrounds outside the valley will be closed by then as well.  (I did a trip back in October, and was surprised that all the campgrounds were closed outside the valley.  That said, about a week out there were campsites available in the valley - they may have been booked up months ahead of time, but cancelled by then.)  Compared to summer, Yosemite will be a ghost town in November.  Assuming the higher roads are closed, you'll be largely limited to hikes in the valley.  You'll probably want to inquire when the time grows closer, but it's possible you'll be able to hike parts of Mist Trail or 4-mile Trail, both of which are a decent workout with great views.    If it's really snowy by then, you could snow shoe out to Dewey Point from Badger Pass - it's pretty spectacular when it's winter. -photo-  Honestly, sort out a place to stay first and, as the time draws nearer I'd check back in again and get a feel for current conditions."

Yosemite,3cqtot,GoSh4rks,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:48:43 2015 UTC,"Is that actually true, considering that you don't need a wilderness permit at all?

If you're driving in on the 41 from the Wawona area, you'll see a pull out spot after passing through a tunnel. It's super obvious where to pull over.   Google Maps link  As for a view of half dome, you can get a decent view from one of the fields (I cant remember what it's called). It's pretty much right in front of the Royal Arches area though, and it's the field that's closest to curry village. It's basically the furthest point you can drive to when you're going into the Valley."

Yosemite,3chjhd,davmre,3,Tue Jul 7 23:24:35 2015 UTC,You are likely better off picking a less popular trailhead elsewhere in the park or in the neighboring wilderness areas and getting a reservation vs trying to play the walk up game on a tight schedule.
Yosemite,3chjhd,jakdak,2,Tue Jul 7 23:59:08 2015 UTC,"You could theoretically call one of the permitting stations on Friday evening to confirm which trailheads still have permits available. I have shown up day of and gotten the permits I wanted for Sunrise Lakes and Cathedral. That involved arriving late the evening before and being at the permitting station just before 6am on the day of. That being said this was the last weekend in SEP/first weekend of OCT so a significantly less popular time of year (while still being awesome weather).  I don't actually recall the permits becoming available day before when I did it but I could have missed that and shown up with naivete in full swing with the hiking gods smiling on me, or they could have changed that policy since I went last year. Someone else may be able to chime in on that."
Yosemite,3chjhd,IWantThatSign,2,Wed Jul 8 04:58:33 2015 UTC,Thanks! Calling the permit station seems like a good idea - obviously there are lots of nice hikes in Yosemite but we'd probably do something closer to home if we knew we weren't going to get any of the really iconic ones.

I've never been able to find a use trail for this route, though I always somewhat expect to find one.  Here's a shot looking down at the Young Lakes from the hanging meadow midway up to the saddle: http://i.imgur.com/Oh3dfol.jpg  Basically you want to head for the lowpoint of the saddle between Conness and White, then pick up the well established use trail from the saddle to the Conness Summit.   Check out Waterwheel Falls on the way. Go get In-N-Out.   I've never found Waterwheel to be worth the extra mile or two and 500ft of hot switchbacking elevation gain vs. just stopping at Le Conte.  Many many people mistake at LeConte for Waterwheel anyway.  (Google image search ""Waterwheel Falls"" and you'll get a whole bunch of pictures of LeConte)"

Upper Chilnualna Falls from the Chilnualna Falls trailhead.   I don't plan on doing half dome if it requires permit, other hike suggestions?   It definitely requires a permit :(  (One of the very few routes with a day use permit in the whole Sierra Nevada.  Mt Whitney is the other main one).  250+ miles of options here.  If you can give milage/terrain constraints we can give better suggestions.   The signature hike in the park is going to be the Nevada Falls loop (Mist trail up, JMT down) which is also the bottom half of the Half Dome.  This is insanely crowded but requires no permits.   I am guessing a lot these questions are typical now that I have listed them out so if there is a resource that answers them I apologize, I'll check the sidebar now.   See this link for the official park service trip planning site:  http://www.nps.gov/yose/planyourvisit/index.htm"

Also, since we might be getting a somewhat late start after the drive, 8mi roundtrip seems pretty do-able. (is that accurate 8mi?)   http://www.yelp.com/biz/chilnualna-falls-trail-yosemite-national-park   If you can give milage/terrain constraints we can give better suggestions.    We are pretty aerobically fit, but will not be training specifically for hiking, so I don't know where that puts us. I hiked about 9mi with pretty steep terrain at Big Basin park recently and I was pretty sore feet-wise by the end.

Yosemite,3ccxhe,Glane1818,1 point,Tue Jul 7 19:23:02 2015 UTC,Depends on when you go.  The portion before Glen Aulin tends to be more crowded than past that point and the HSC camp itself can be a zoo when its open.  I prefer this route before the camp opens in the spring when the river/waterfalls are at their peak flow.
Yosemite,3ccxhe,jakdak,5,Tue Jul 7 19:28:04 2015 UTC,"Definitely Mt. Hoffman. Maybe the best summit view in the park, and the whole hike is just packed with gorgeous views of May Lake, Tenaya Lake, Tuolumne Meadows, what feels like the entire eastern Sierra, and the valley features. It's also maybe a 5/10 until the last few hundred feet, and then it's a Class 2 scramble, so lots of variety in the hike, too."

Yosemite,3ccxhe,jakdak,1 point,Tue Jul 7 04:58:26 2015 UTC,"Conness is longer and substantially higher elevation- but the route isn't much more difficult than Hoffman.  Its basically a cairned class 1-2 use trail the same as Hoffman.  Last time I did it there was a father with grade school age kids just behind me on the route.  (The only tricky part is picking the correct chute at the head of the canyon to gain the ridgetop- picking the wrong one makes it a class 3 route)  Though to be fair, the views from Hoffman are also excellent :)"

Yosemite,3ccxhe,yosemitetrailblazer,3,Tue Jul 7 13:18:25 2015 UTC,"One that I like is you start at the trailhead for Chilnualna Falls. However, instead of turning around there continue heading southeast and do the loop that takes you by Grouse Lake, Crescent Lake, Johnson Lake, Buena Vista Lake, and Chilnualna Lakes. You are looking at about 33 miles for the full loop but it's worth it. There's much less people there than in comparison to the rest of the park."

Yosemite,3caim8,WidowmakerXLS,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:41:56 2015 UTC,"No permits. I've never done half dome but my gf has a few years back and she liked this hike better.   Our start point was the sunrise high Sierra camp trailhead near Tenay lake. We went up to clouds rest and then on to the valley floor, hooking up with the mist trail for the last 4 miles, passing Nevada and vernal falls. Absolutely awesome but rather intense. Took us exactly 10 hours with a 30 minute stop atop clouds rest.   Our route was around 16 miles, you can do it as a up and back as well which is 14.2  The first 2.5 miles are the most instense, seemingly never ending uphill switchbacks on rock steps. Gets easier after that until clouds resr, where you have to climb on rocks no more than 6 feet wide with cliffs on each side. So worth it though for the views. You look down on half dome, north dome, El cap, and everything else in the valley for that matter.   Coming down vernal and Nevada falls is tough too, very steep steps that can be slick in the wet. Make sure you leave yourself enough time because you don't want to he doing these at night.   We parked at curry village and took a hikers bus to Tenaya lake. Started our hike at 10am, walked into camp at 8pm. Would have prefered starting earlier but we were at the mercy of the bus schedule.   Take lots of water, we had two camelbacks, 2 Nalgenes, 2 Water bottles, and iodine tabs for purification. Filled up whenever and where ever we could.   TL:DR hard but o so worth it. I don't know if I'll ever see a more beautiful place"
Yosemite,3caim8,WidowmakerXLS,1 point,Wed Jul 15 12:30:33 2015 UTC,Sounds awesome. This is the one I think we're deciding on. The shuttle don't go back up to that trail head do they?

Yosemite,3caim8,Rickster5555,4,Fri Jul 17 03:05:10 2015 UTC,"I really like the Upper Yosemite Falls hike. It has a lot of the features of hiking to the top of Half Dome: it is very strenuous and there is a beautiful view at the top, and it is popular and well-known.  The whole hike up is dangerous and you are always close to a cliff's edge, so that is thrilling. And the river at the top of the Upper Yosemite Falls hike is beautiful and mesmerizing. Personally I think it is a good opportunity to teach your friend how deceptively dangerous running water is in Yosemite. But then again, you can also show them Vernal Falls on the Half Dome hike, assuming you would take the Mist Trail. Just keep in mind that the trail to Half Dome is way longer and much more strenuous, and if you get to the subdome and don't have a permit, and have to turn back, that might be anti-climactic for you and your friend."
Yosemite,3caim8,jakdak,2,Mon Jul 6 13:52:14 2015 UTC,Awesome hike! I did Upper Yosemite Falls a couple days before doing Half Dome. It's a perfect warm-up.
Yosemite,3caim8,robbbbb,2,Mon Jul 6 16:47:43 2015 UTC,"Of all the hikes I've done in Yosemite, Upper Yosemite Falls was actually my least favorite.  After a while the views disappear and it becomes an unpleasant death march uphill to somehow disappointing views.  The view at the very end is nice, but the payout didn't live up to the workload for me.  My favorite all day hikes are Clouds Rest (the hike itself isn't the greatest, but the payoff is amazing), Four Mile Trail (ever-improving views as you climb), and probably Panorama (though I've only hiked to Illilouette, and not the rest of the way down the JMT to Happy Isles - I've done that stretch separately though).  Glen Aulin is another spectacular day hike, along the Tuolumne - I think most people don't really get into Yosemite's northern watershed as much, and it's a little different and also very beautiful.  While not requiring a full day, I'd highly highly recommend Mt Hoffman as well.  I highly recommend getting up there for the sunset and coming down in the dark (carefully).  Mount Hoffman views are stellar."
Yosemite,3caim8,inkyj28,1 point,Mon Jul 6 19:20:18 2015 UTC,Are you saying the hike up half Dome is longer and more intense than Upper Yosemite Falls or The Mist Trail? Good point on the possibility of it being anti-climactic. We are looking for a good spot to watch the sun rise so that is key. Thanks.
Yosemite,3caim8,jakdak,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:19:07 2015 UTC,"yes! the hike up Half Dome via Mist Trail is 10-14 hours (round trip)- you should start very early, like 6AM, and should take a flashlight in case you get back late. The Upper Yosemite Falls trail is 6-8 hours (round trip). Yosemite rates the hike to Half Dome as ""extremely strenuous"" on the handout at the kiosk outside the gift shop. They rate the Upper Yosemite Falls trail as just ""very strenuous""."
Yosemite,3caim8,fakejoebiden,0,Mon Jul 6 20:24:40 2015 UTC,"To counter this, I think Upper Yosemite Falls is the most overrated trail in the National Park System- especially in late summer once the falls have dried up  :)  Its an astronomically crowded, hot, exposed, steep, relentless switchback slog.  There are many many many routes in the park more appealing than this one."

Yosemite,3c5t4g,Feedmebrainfood,1 point,Sun Jul 5 23:12:55 2015 UTC,"It was 100+ in the Valley during the day, but uptop it was low 50s.  Perfect conditions.  Lucked out.   Been up there when it was well below freezing with wind chill in June as well.   Gotta be prepared for it!"
Yosemite,3c5t4g,Glane1818,1 point,Mon Jul 6 06:08:02 2015 UTC,That's awesome!  What type of device do you have that allows your camera to rotate like that?
Yosemite,3c0aq5,gherbst007,1 point,Fri Jul 3 16:34:18 2015 UTC,"Gorgeous! I climbed half dome that morning, a few hours after sunrise; were you one of the people sleeping on top?"
Yosemite,3c0aq5,RealRocketScientist,2,Fri Jul 3 23:27:33 2015 UTC,"We topped out around 3am, first ones up.  Next was John C finishing his JMT(!)... we didn't descend till 6:30ish.  What time did you top out?  No sleeping for us--a few of us were running around doing film and GoPro shots, the rest hunkered down to stay warm.  Everyone was up and moblie right after Twilight to catch the rest.  PM me with a description of you or a timestamp in the vids and I'll see if we grabbed footage of you.   Beautiful day, glad to share a sunrise and a summit with you!"

Yosemite,3bxsf5,ElenaDragon,3,Fri Jul 3 01:09:08 2015 UTC,Trying to descend from Basket Dome to Snow Creek is probably not a good idea.    Looking down at Snow Creek from the Basket Dome summit: http://i.imgur.com/09BaU2D.jpg  The traverse over from the North Dome trail to Basket Dome is a solid wall of chapparal as well.

Yosemite,3bw8zt,gherbst007,2,Thu Jul 2 17:46:30 2015 UTC,"We were lucky, and won permits for our group both on Saturday (when we started the hike) and Sunday (when we descended the cables).  Spoke with a Ranger on Sunday morning during our descent around the start of the Switchbacks-- he confirmed you need both.  Also you are not allowed to camp up there (he defined camping as sleeping) but we did not;  the Photography kept us plenty busy for the hour before twilight thru sunrise  TLDR:  You better have permits for both days, and no sleeping up top!"
Yosemite,3bw8zt,Dmaggi727,1 point,Fri Jul 3 00:27:23 2015 UTC,Never done it at night before. How is it?  Awesome video btw.
Yosemite,3bw8zt,-KhmerBear-,2,Thu Jul 2 20:43:19 2015 UTC,"Nothing too tricky;  Just do the math between the forecast between Glacier Point or LYV or the Valley Floor to determine the likely summit temps-- subtract 3.3deg F for every thousand foot difference to the ~8900ft summit.   Do bring your warmies and shells.  We got rained on in '13 and had to descend quickly.  You will 100% get your permits checked by the Rangers, likely on their way up-- probably around the switchbacks, or base of the steps."
Yosemite,3bw8zt,GreatBallsOfFIRE,1 point,Fri Jul 3 00:29:19 2015 UTC,Cool video.  Is there a special permit for that?
Yosemite,3byaf1,Kowabunga_Dude,1 point,Fri Jul 3 03:52:51 2015 UTC,"I've been to Camp 4 during August which isn't too hard to getting a spot. The only suggestion which is what everyone will say is that you should get there early, around 7am to fall in line. I believe that there will be a park ranger there at the kiosk who you will meet since you'll be going during the summer season."

Yosemite,3bwkdn,jkforty7,2,Thu Jul 2 19:10:28 2015 UTC,"Evergreen Lodge is lovely - I'm a local, and that's our super-secret date spot. It puts you very close to Hetch Hetchy, which is beautiful! The Tuolumne grove of big trees is close to this, located just beyond the Crane Flat store.   Pro-Tip, one of my favorite coffee shops on the west coast is located inside the garden/nursery in Groveland. It's located on a sort of patio space on the edge of the nursery, and makes for a really nice stop when you need to get out of the car."
Yosemite,3bwkdn,redopinion209,1 point,Sat Jul 4 04:48:20 2015 UTC,That's really great to hear about the coffee shop in Groveland. Is the nursery called Mountain Sage? Do you have any other recommendations for Groveland? Like bars or restaurants? We plan to try to pizza place.
Yosemite,3bwkdn,robbbbb,1 point,Mon Jul 6 15:10:36 2015 UTC,"Note that, from Groveland, none of those places are less than an hour drive. Tenaya Lake is about an hour and a half, and Glacier Point/Sentinel Dome is closer to two hours, according to Google Maps. And they're in two different directions.  If you specifically want to see Sequoias, Tuolumne Grove and Merced Grove are between Groveland and anything else you'd want to see in Yosemite. I've never been to either, so I don't know how worthwhile they are."
Yosemite,3bwkdn,SmallVillage,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:01:40 2015 UTC,"First off, everything you mentioned is nowhere near each other. Sentinel Dome hike is up Glacier Point road, about an 45-hour from the Valley. Tenaya Lake is at least 1.5-2hrs from the Valley plus delays for construction currently going on. I suggest that you do 1 day in the Valley, driving around the loop and stopping at various places along the way. Then 1 day driving out to Tuolumne Meadows for the afternoon. Careful with overdoing it on the hikes, I might just pick 1 for the entire trip if your GF isn't a strong hiker; the Mist Trail to Vernal Falls is probably the most popular hike in the Valley, start early to avoid the heat. As for Tuolumne, just strolling through the meadow is pretty relaxing. Park at the grill/store in Tuolumne Meadows, then take the trail on the opposite side of the road across the meadow, you will eventually reach a footbridge across the river, a visitors center in an old stone and timber lodge cabin, and a soda spring where you can drink the naturally carbonated water. You can have a picnic anywhere along the river. One of the most serene places in park because there are a lot less people than the Valley."
Yosemite,3bwkdn,jakdak,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:16:55 2015 UTC,"I really wanted to hike a dome. Are there any other, more accessible dome hikes? Tuolumne Meadows does look pretty chill, is it close enough to Tenaya Lake to see them both in the same day? It looks like they are close on  Google Maps."
Yosemite,3bwkdn,jakdak,2,Fri Jul 3 00:54:56 2015 UTC,"Are there any other, more accessible dome hikes?   Lembert Dome. Sentinel Dome. North Dome"
Yosemite,3bwkdn,jakdak,1 point,Fri Jul 3 01:04:17 2015 UTC,"Drive might be too far to Sentinel and North is too long of a hike at 8.8 miles. Lembert is near Tuolumne Meadows so could be done in the same day, we may plan to do that.   Do you support the Mist Trail to Vernal Falls recommendation? We are trying to avoid shoulder-to-shoulder crowds so hearing that it is the most popular hike in the valley is a turn off. I had been looking at Yosemite Falls to Columbia Rock, but that may be just as crowded? Can you recommend Merced vs Tuolumne Grove?"
Yosemite,3bwkdn,SmallVillage,2,Fri Jul 3 01:27:24 2015 UTC,Do you support the Mist Trail to Vernal Falls recommendation?    This is incredibly scenic but probably the most crowded trail in the national park system (with the possible exception of the Bright Angel trail in the Grand Canyon).  Its absolutely worth doing but plan on a zoo.   I had been looking at Yosemite Falls to Columbia Rock   Also a zoo with a really nice view.   Can you recommend Merced vs Tuolumne Grove?   Its been a couple decades since I've been to either.  Mariposa was (er- is but it has a restoration project this summer) the premier grove in the park and I'll usually route folks to Big Basin or Calaveras if they aren't heading to Yosemite.
Yosemite,3bwkdn,redopinion209,2,Fri Jul 3 02:34:44 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the advice. We will be near Santa Cruz with no plans for Sunday afternoon and might check out Big Basin.   I've done the Bright Angel to Plateau Point and the crowds really detracted from the scenery for me. Should probably just get over it though, and do Mist Trail to Vernal Falls."

Yosemite,3bvwlj,rimandro,1 point,Thu Jul 2 16:16:30 2015 UTC,It's stop number 2 on the free shuttle in the valley. The backpackers campground is stop number 18 at the north pines campground.
Yosemite,3bvrlo,sp0ngew0rthy,2,Thu Jul 2 15:33:00 2015 UTC,"I'd skip half dome and clouds rest too. Too much work. Never been to Mariposa Grove, but everything else is doable. I'd also recommend Taft point and sentinel dome. Trailhead is on the road to glacier point, and the hikes are only 2-3 miles, but you get amazing views of half dome. Sentinel Dome is my favorite spot so far."
Yosemite,3bvrlo,bloobeard,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:14:56 2015 UTC,Sweet! I'll have to check those out thanks so much for your response
Yosemite,3bvrlo,robbbbb,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:51:14 2015 UTC,"You realize that most campsites are usually booked 6 months in advance, right? There are some first-come, first-served campsites but they can be pretty hard to get.  If by ""visiting"" Half Dome and Clouds Rest, you mean hiking to the top of them, then no, you won't have enough time. Half Dome alone is an all-day hike, plus you need a permit to go to the top. Clouds Rest is another all-day hike. If you just want to look at Half Dome though, any place in Yosemite Valley will work."
Yosemite,3bvrlo,zh3nya,1 point,Thu Jul 2 16:00:18 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your response. Yeah, I was planning on doing the first come first serve (camp 4) as this was a last minute trip."
Yosemite,3bvrlo,keks-dose,2,Thu Jul 2 16:27:14 2015 UTC,"I think you absolutely can fit either Clouds Rest or Half Dome into your trip.   Day 1: El Cap (it's just a short walk up to it, if that's what you mean), Vernal Falls (don't stop at Vernal, go to Nevada Falls and back on the JMT, it gets way better than just Vernal), Mirror Lake (the least interesting thing on the list, btw--I'd skip it, there are way better lakes off Tioga Pass Road), and a sunset from Glacier Point.  Day 2: Half Dome from the Valley or Clouds Rest from Tioga Road. Or Yosemite Falls, or Mount Hoffmann, or North Dome, or ramble around the Gaylor Lakes area, or something else up on Tioga Road. Yeah, Half Dome will drain you, especially in the heat, and you might not get a permit anyway. If you aren't totally set on bagging it, I would use the time to explore the Tioga/Tuolumne area, especially since you'd be covering a lot of the same trail you already hiked the previous day.  Day 3 (on your way home?): Mariposa."

Yosemite,3buh1n,jakdak,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:11:16 2015 UTC,That spur down to Chilnualna Falls on the bottom left can be bypassed  if you want to shorten the route a bit. Crescent Lake has blueberries if the bears haven't picked the bushes dry by September.  And this can also be done out of Wawona which is shorter but involves lugging a pack up the Chilnualna Falls trail.

It's not topo or have any other fancy info on it. Just quick and too the point which is what I love about it.  I keep meaning to snap a pic of it every year I go but I keep forgetting. And I for some reason can't find it online.

Yosemite,3bstr6,iheartmetal13,1 point,Wed Jul 1 23:40:24 2015 UTC,Camp 4 gets full fast. If I were you I'd ask some people around the Housekeeping Camp (or Camp 4) to share with. I went solo and ended up paying $110 for my own spot at Housekeeping. I had a bunk bed that went unused that I would have gladly shared with some peeps.
Yosemite,3bpjzp,Bigsur10,4,Wed Jul 1 03:02:42 2015 UTC,"Bears will tear open cars for far less than a cooler. They could be brand new with no food smells and it is still against the park rules because bears know what coolers look like.  Either find a designated bear box to store them in or leave them at home. Anything that might smell like food should also be removed.  The rule of thumb is anything that goes in your mouth or on your skin will attract bears. This means your toothpaste and any other toiletries must go in your bear canister. This is part of the park rules, and you can get fined for breaking them. It's okay to leave clothes in your backpacks, but we leave our backpacks outside of the tent with all the backpack zippers and compartments open. This way any curious bears or other animals can check them out without tearing anything open. Again, this is without any food or toiletries inside. Trash should also go in your bear canister if it is food trash."
Yosemite,3bpjzp,ElenaDragon,2,Wed Jul 1 04:08:32 2015 UTC,Well we need to bring the coolers in because we have a long road trip after this hike... I guess clean them out and put them in the bear locker?  Then maybe make sure we clean out the car of all wrappers and anything that smells?
Yosemite,3bpjzp,ElenaDragon,2,Wed Jul 1 07:48:00 2015 UTC,The stuff you put in bear lockers doesn't need to be clean. Put anything that smells or could hold food in the lockers and your car should be fine.
Yosemite,3bpjzp,jakdak,1 point,Wed Jul 1 14:13:40 2015 UTC,The lockers big enough for 2 decent sized ice chests?
Yosemite,3bpjzp,Glane1818,2,Wed Jul 1 15:19:14 2015 UTC,"Most likely, but you'd likely be consuming an entire locker with those."
Yosemite,3bpjzp,GoNorthYoungMan,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:37:59 2015 UTC,Near the May Lake trail head there are a bunch of bear lockers.  You can use multiple if you have to.
Yosemite,3bpjzp,GoSh4rks,3,Fri Jul 3 23:49:11 2015 UTC,"Take bears seriously.  You should be paranoid about them getting into your car, that is exactly what they do. You must plan on putting toothpaste and trash and food and anything that smells in the canister.  I can put 6 days of food in a large canister, so for 4 guys I'd say 2 large canisters.  But if you're not familiar with packing this stuff, that probably won't be enough room so plan on either not bringing as much food as you want, or bringing a 3rd canister."
Yosemite,3bpjzp,cbg,4,Wed Jul 1 04:29:43 2015 UTC,Anything else? My questins would be: would it be a good idea to cook on the trail and then hike in the woods to set up camp to not put sleep and cook close?   Completely unnecessary in Yosemite and the Sierra. Even eating at camp isn't something to really worry about. Been doing that for nearly 15 years and not one problem.
Yosemite,3boyrg,antiqua_lumina,1 point,Tue Jun 30 23:38:56 2015 UTC,"Pretty sure it's all pretty nice. I was worried about the same thing when I stayed at Moraine camp ground at RMNP and they were all very nice.

Yosemite,3boyrg,rebo2,1 point,Wed Jul 1 20:25:19 2015 UTC,Most the sites there are decent.  I did this a few years ago and just asked the camp host person at the check in gate which site was the BEST site still available.  The person was very nice and told me which number and how to get there.

We got out of the car left everything inside and slept till 8a. Right before the park ranger gets there 😉. Were 12th-17th in line. No problems and 3rd year doing it."
Yosemite,3boaki,JC84909,0,Wed Jul 1 00:33:07 2015 UTC,"Common sense here prevails.  There is no requirement for food inside a vehicle to be bear proofed.  Think about all the tourists who motor into Yosemite everyday.  This being said, you want your ""smellables"" all out of your car when you park it overnight.    South of Yosemite, at (Mt.) Whitney Portal, they have a wall of fame with pictures of cars that bears have torn apart looking for food.  Have fun on your trip!"

About twenty minutes or so from Glacier Point, about ten or so minutes to the Sentinel Dome Hike, bridal veil falls, etc. It's about 45 minutes or so give or take to the valley.

It's about 14 miles (22 km) total, plus another three miles to reach your car once you're back to the valley, though you'll probably elect to catch the free shuttle buses instead of walking that stretch (see stops E5 and 16 on the valley shuttle map). It combines two 5-star hikes (three if you venture the extra quarter mile to cover the Glacier Point trail) into a single day. Half Dome gets the publicity, but this is probably the ultimate Yosemite day hike. You'll see an unmatched range of scenery, including everything that Yosemite Valley is famous for (except Bridalveil Fall, which is hidden by Cathedral Rocks), plus Glacier Point and Illilouette Falls. It's efficient, too; you'd have to drive more than 50 miles (80 km) to go from Yosemite Village to Glacier Point and back again by car."

In July/August it will likely be pushing 100 degrees in the valley, it is insanely crowded along much of that route, and it is hard to recommend lugging a pack up any of the valley switchback slogs in the best of conditions- nevermind in the peak of the summer heat.  Head up to the high country in the July/August months."
Yosemite,3bjrgd,jakdak,1 point,Tue Jun 30 00:33:04 2015 UTC,"Gotta disagree a bit. I just did this hike and it was mostly empty. Second, isn't the whole point of a hike to slog stuff up a mountain? If you don't want that, just drive to the top with the rest of the lazy, disabled or just not interested tourists. Third, the hike doesn't go along the valley floor except for a small portion, for which you can take the free shuttle bus. The vast majority of the hike is on top of the valley rim."
Yosemite,3bjrgd,whine_and_cheese,2,Tue Jun 30 08:25:43 2015 UTC,"Generally not a fan of any of the Valley switchback slogs- especially in the midsummer.  There's ~250 miles of trail in the park that are not the Yosemite Falls, Snow Creek, and 4 mile trails.     Second, isn't the whole point of a hike to slog stuff up a mountain?   No, generally my main goal in a backpack trip is not to maximize the amount of vertical gain I do with my pack.  :)  I far prefer dayhiking the valley exit routes rather than lugging a pack up them.  (And there are alternative trailheads on all of them that allow you to start at elevation rather than in the valley if you are headed deeper into the wilderness).    Third, the hike doesn't go along the valley floor except for a small portion   The traffic, parking, and crowds getting into and out of the valley are only a portion of the problem.  You'll also encounter the folks up at Glacier Point and then the hordes from Nevada Falls down to Happy Isles.    I much prefer the Valley switchback slogs in the late spring/early summer shoulder season- immediately after the south rim has melted out.   Better weather,  Less crowds, and the waterfalls are in full flow.   Once you hit midsummer and the high country opens up there are, IMHO, far better options."
Yosemite,3bjrgd,jakdak,1 point,Tue Jun 30 13:18:40 2015 UTC,"I started this route at 10AM with no problem parking or getting  into the valley. The crowds at Glacier Point were literally about a half kilometer of a few people. I reached the falls at sunset and there was almost no one there.   I guess it just depends on your timing and desires. I do enjoy vertical climbs as I consider that to be the challenging, and after rewarding, part.  Thanks for the thorough answers though. I guess it shows that Yosemite has room for everyone :) ."

Yosemite,3bj17v,DrPepper-,2,Mon Jun 29 17:01:25 2015 UTC,"I was there on 6/16 to 6/18. There's good water on the way hiking in from Tenaya Lake. On the back side of the first big uphill, after the Sunrise junction, there is a small stream crossing. There is also a nice pond on that stretch of trail before the next junction, with an excellent backcountry camping spot just beyond it. There are other running streams after the pond as well, which is the one marked on most maps. However, once you start up the hill again towards Clouds Rest, there's no more water."
Yosemite,3bj17v,palebluebob,3,Mon Jun 29 17:56:44 2015 UTC,"I was there last week (6/21 - 6/24) and these places are still running nicely.  IMHO the stream crossing after the pond (the one marked on most maps) is the best place to obtain water on the way to Clouds Rest.  The first stream you come to after coming down the hill from Sunrise junction has a bit of an earthy taste to it.    If you are continuing on past Clouds Rest towards the JMT, there is a tiny spring that comes out from under a tree a little before the switchbacks to get to the JMT junction, if you are needing some that way."

The Parks website makes it seem like finding a first-come, first-serve site there is difficult in the summer, and it suggests arriving by 8:30 a.m. on weekends. What's your experience? Do you think we'll have trouble finding a spot if we show up Friday night?"
Yosemite,3biifg,SmallVillage,1 point,Mon Jun 29 19:24:20 2015 UTC,"Tuolumne Meadows campsite takes online reservations during the summer. The NPS makes it seem hard to get a spot to prevent a bunch of people thinking they can drive 2 hrs into the middle of nowhere with no backup plan to sleep, rightfully so. The fact is though, if you arrive at the shack in the morning without a reservation, the rangers will try their best to find you a spot as cancellations open up. Check the reservations website before you go and try picking up cancellations online as they pop up, search for only one day at a time, the system is weird and will show unavailable if you try to search a date range."

This handsome fellow (rocking some serious bell bottoms) is my Dad at age 24, in August of 1980. This was during a cross country road trip from Florida to California and taken somewhere in Yosemite National Park. Behind him is the beautiful Half Dome. It's one of my favorite pictures I have of him. I'm looking to re-create this picture in July and looking for some help finding out exactly where this was taken! I'm hoping that by posting this picture, perhaps someone will recognize the view/landmark and point me in the right direction. Thanks in advance, Reddit!"

Yosemite,3b7zjw,jakdak,1 point,Fri Jun 26 22:56:09 2015 UTC,"I would just start by exploring the valley and checking out the various spots there. There's some very short paved hikes to the waterfalls and Mirror Lake. Obviously the Mist Trail is a popular one as well. I'd also recommend getting up to Glacier Point, whether driving or hiking up.   Some will tell you to steer clear of the valley...yes, it can be very crowded, but it's crowded for a reason.   If you have the time, Tuolumne Meadows is a great place to check out as well.   Can't give you any specific info on RV parking, but your odds of finding a place within the park will be slim. If you end up having to drive in and out every day, try not to let it bother you, and just enjoy the drive!"

If need be, talk to some of the campground employees about RV parking along the road... there are a number of spots just off the road that are perfectly legal to park and sleep at.

Yosemite,3b7zjw,redopinion209,1 point,Sat Jun 27 04:32:32 2015 UTC,Go up 4 mile and down the panorama. You could go to the top of the falls then cut across and come down snow creek... or go balls-deep and do Tenaya Lake or Olmstead Point to the valley.

Its very very unlikely that the Yosemite backcountry will be completely booked up- you are probably better off looking for alternatives inside the park before heading to points East.

Yosemite,3azw49,jakdak,2,Wed Jun 24 23:47:07 2015 UTC,The trailheads for May Lake/Mt Hoffman and Yosemite Falls/North dome from the north are both close to Yosemite Creek.  Clouds Rest out of Sunrise is also convenient and all of the Tuolumne Meadows/Mono Pass/Tioga Pass trailheads are about a half hour east of you.
Yosemite,3azw49,korravai,1 point,Wed Jun 24 23:52:50 2015 UTC,"If you're going to the Valley in the winter I'd skip it now. The waterfalls will be dry in August anyway, and it will be hot. You might even luck out on some rain or snow before your winter trip putting some light juice back into the falls, and either way the valley looks great in winter IMO.   If your buddies aren't coming with you in the fall, or you still want a peak at the valley, you could do the North Dome hike from near where you're camping. You'll get a great view of Half Dome and the valley floor from there."
Yosemite,3azw49,knauerj,1 point,Thu Jun 25 21:18:59 2015 UTC,"I can add some good input in here....my buddies and I went out to Yosemite from SC in late August of 2013 and could not get a Valley campground. If I could do it all over, I would try harder to get a Valley site because it changes your entire trip.  We attempted to get a campsite at White Wolf, but we showed up around 4:00 in the afternoon and they were booked solid, so we went to Yosemite Creek. The road to get into the campground is long and has huge holes....it takes a good 15 minutes just to get from the main road to your site, and it was difficult to navigate in our Kia Optima rental.   The campground itself was awesome, we stayed in site 53 (or something like that), and we could walk behind and explore granite rocks and stargaze at night. The only thing that we didn't like was the fact that it took over an hour to get to the Valley....and that was where we wanted to be most of the time."
Yosemite,3azw49,Pamela-Handerson,1 point,Thu Jun 25 14:42:42 2015 UTC,"I haven't camped at Yosemite Creek but I did drive down to check it out a couple weeks ago. The road is rough on the way down. You can make it in a regular sedan if you need to, you just have to be careful of the potholes and rocks. Don't bring your low slung sports car.  You could also try to get a site at Porcupine Flat, as being right off the Tioga Road will put you a lot closer to the valley. I was able to get sites there in early afternoon on Saturdays in June, so I don't think you will have any trouble on a Thursday."

Yosemite,3aqf61,jrm0317,2,Tue Jun 23 03:45:53 2015 UTC,"So i just got back on Sunday from hiking Cathedral Lakes trailhead -> Yosemite Valley via Sunrise Lakes/Clouds Rest/Half Dome and will share my experience.  We camped at Yosemite Creek Campground the night before we were supposed to get the permits. The sign off Tioga Road said it was full, but it was not even close to full, and we were able to get a site (btw the drive down to the camp is long, windy, and poorly paved).   We got up at 3 am Wednesday morning and drove about an hour to tuolumne meadows Wilderness Permit station (you want to be at the closest one for priority). We were 2nd in line behind 2 PCT thru-hikers who wanted to do the hike as a side hike. They were sleeping in line, which isnt allowed, but whatever. As soon as we got in line a guy who had been sleeping in his car jumped out and got in line behind up. This is at 4am on a wednesday, not even quite peak season.  We all wanted Cathedral Lakes permits for thursday, the people in front of us got 2, we got 4, leaving 4 (there's 25 total, but only 10 of which are for walk-ups). The guy behind us needed 7, so he was sorta screwed (tho he ended up figuring it out, he got 3 permits additional for wednesday that someone had reserved and never picked up). We also got Half Dome permits, which they had 9 of total.  I would strongly recommend this hike. Cathedral Lakes and Clouds Rest were the highlights. Half dome was almost anticlimactic after Clouds Rest.  Mosquitoes were an MAJOR issue in some sections, especially at Cathedral lake, but they totally disappeared at nightfall, tho they came back early. Bring 100% DEET and a bug net.    Sorry for the long post, PM me if you want to know more, i could talk about this hike for days."

Yosemite,3aqf61,OrwellQuinn,1 point,Mon Jun 29 04:30:47 2015 UTC,"You were able to get a spot at Yosemite Creek though? The road down to the campsites is longer than I expected and kinda crazy. We did it in a passat, but something with better suspension would have been ideal. There wasn't much firewood to be had at all, so you might want to bring your own. Mosquitos were present, I dont know if they would be more or less in August. I would bring bug spray.  100% Deet, and baby wipes to wipe it off at night. Also be careful as that stuff will eat through rain jackets etc. If you keep going past the initial few campsites you'll find what I considered the better sites right on the river. You almost surely won't get cell service on any carrier at the campsite, although AT&T seemed best in the park overall."

Yosemite,3am8v5,Itendtolurk,1 point,Sun Jun 21 16:40:05 2015 UTC,I have been wanting to do Mount Dana for a while. Can you tell me more about your hike?
Yosemite,3am8v5,maxillo,2,Sun Jun 21 17:09:42 2015 UTC,"Sure!   It's tough! :P  3,000' of elevation gain in 2.46 miles is hard.  The trail is extremely easy to follow leaving the parking lot just off Tioga Road, until about 400' above the Plateau at 11,500'.  From there, it's Class 1 off-trail scrambling to the top.  The use trail is fairly easy to follow - and there's massive cairns about every 200ish feet to keep you mostly on track.  When I went up yesterday, there was only 1 really deep - about hip deep - snow field left that was blocking the path.  I went over it and had no issues, post holed once.    The last 600' are really rough.  It's super steep, and you're going across mostly metamorphic rock fall.  Take it slow, and pay attention, and you should be fine.  I highly recommend trekking poles as well.  For balance and to test rocks before you take a step.    The earlier you start, the better.  I started off at 9:00a, and summited at 12:30p, with a 20-ish min rest at the Plateau for an early lunch.  I wouldn't attempt it without spending at least one night at Tuolomne Meadows - and the more time you spend at elevation ahead of the hike, the better.  It's an accessible peak to attain, but 13k feet is still 13k feet.    Here's a map of my route, it's exactly the same as the one on Summit Post.   Hope this helps... My advice: spend a few days ahead of time really getting comfortable with the route in your head.  I think I read the summit post for this hike at least 5 times and studied the topo map a enough that I could easily tell where I was on the mountain just by looking at the features in front of me."
Yosemite,3am8v5,maxillo,1 point,Sun Jun 21 17:33:07 2015 UTC,"Wow. Thanks for the great response. Sounds challenging.  I have never spent the night in Tuolomne Meadows- always want to get away from the mosquitoes, and going up a hill always seems to thin them out a ton. How are they this time of year?"
Yosemite,3am8v5,jakdak,2,Sun Jun 21 21:40:51 2015 UTC,"Skeeters were terrible.  Terrible!! I have never spent much time in the park during summer because of the crowds and skeeters.  If you want a real adventure, there's a PERFECT spot to bivy up at the summit of Mt. Dana.  Not sure about the necessary wilderness permits for it, and I bet it'll be cold and windy - but probably epic views at night sundown / sunup."

We've done the float as a group many times-- each raft would be within arms reach of each other if you steered them that way.   There are only a couple mildly tricky parts -- going under the bridges-- but you have minutes of prep to make sure you aim for the best (well marked) passage.

Yosemite,3am9m1,ryansbeard,5,Sun Jun 21 16:46:29 2015 UTC,"There are three ways to get a Half Dome permit:   -Preseason Lottery  -Daily Lottery  -As part of your wilderness permit  As you know the preseason lottery ended. The daily lottery is the only way to now get a permit for a day hike. You apply 2 days before the planned hike day at recreation.gov. So if you're trying to hike Friday, you'd apply Wednesday.  Chances are about 50/50, with you having a better chance during the week than the weekend.   If you are planning a longer backpacking trip and not just a day hike to half dome, you might be able to get a half dome permit along with the wilderness permit required for the backpacking trip. So for example if you plan on starting out in Tuolumne and getting to Half Dome area on your 3rd day, you can apply for a half dome permit along with the wilderness permit. These are available on a first come first serve basis at the Wilderness Center. You'd apply in person two days before your trip."

I know people who just showed up in the park and got hired on the spot, so timing is key. September can be a good time to get hired because the temporary Summer hires are leaving and they start looking for Winter crew. The waiting jobs are very lucrative and are prized jobs. Usually seniority is key to getting one. Most of the time you have to start at an entry level job and transition to a different job after your first 120 days. Good luck getting a job starting out at the Ahwahnee! I used to work there and no one ever quit. People work there for 30 years or more! You're a single woman? Prepare to have as many boyfriends as you want! There's a limit to how many guests you can have, but that's if you officially register them with employee housing. I loved it there and frequently dream of going back someday..."

Yosemite,3aiwhf,Llnksin,1 point,Sun Jun 21 04:16:17 2015 UTC,Server jobs at the Lodge and or Ahwanhee are positions usually given to those with more seniority. Not to say you won't get them but its not as likely as you might hope. By this time of season you will be left with jobs that are less desirable and yet still worth it to live in such a beautiful place.

Yosemite,3aiwhf,mr3film,1 point,Thu Jul 2 14:58:16 2015 UTC,"I worked several jobs in the park. I started out working one Summer as a salesclerk at Curry Village Gift and Grocery. I did that same job another Summer, then came back another year and worked at the Ahwahnee Gift Shop as a salesclerk. After that, I stayed in the park year-round for over 3 years and worked as a ski lift operator at Badger Pass, a ticket seller for tours, and finally a busperson and waiter in the Ahwahnee dining room. I worked those 2 jobs the longest and it was great! You can make mucho $ and your cost of living is nearly nothing for rent. (A shared dorm room was $60/month, 20 years ago. I don't know what it costs now, though.)   I was lucky getting the salesclerk job when I first arrived, as it's not considered an entry level job. (Those are mostly housekeeping and other service jobs.) The only way to get a non-entry level job, like a waiter, is to apply when it is officially open on the job board or be directly hired by a manager at the location. (Which is what I did after my first Summer) Since it is a union job, seniority rules, so when a job is officially posted, it usually goes to senior personnel. (I had nearly 2 years seniority when I applied for the Ahwahnee busser job)  Living in Yosemite was one of the best things I've ever done. It's beautiful beyond words and you can see more of the park than most visitors ever do. I highly recommend it!"

Those assholes love busting employees and will get you for anything they can! (Especially loud parties and drinking!)

Yosemite,3aex21,Tmcnasty,3,Fri Jun 19 15:55:22 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I would try to get a shuttle to take you out of the valley. The valley isn't very large and you'll probably end up cycling the entire valley in about an hour; you can only bike on the paved roads so you're just not going very far.  Instead, I would suggest you get dropped off along Tioga Road. Getting dropped off near Crane Flat or White Wolf would allow you to bike up Tioga Road with some incredible views around Olmstead Point and other spots for some meadows. Then you can cruise down most of the rest of the way. Alternatively, take the shuttle all the way to Tuolumne Meadows and cruise down all the way to the valley.  I've never done it so I don't know how far you can get in 6 hours but it seems like the valley is definitely not 6 hours worth of biking."

(There's a pond on your right and I believe there's one more reliable stream after that before starting up the ridge).   If heading up from the Half Dome side you'll want to grab water at the JMT junction.  Permits for holiday weekends are hard to get, good luck with your walk-up plans and have a backup itinerary."

No matter what happens, you're going to have a great time. 2) If you're even remotely local to the Sierra Nevada, there are about 1,000 other trailheads/destinations I might try as a first backpacking experience where you don't have to worry so much about permits and waking up early and lines. All of the wilderness areas surrounding Yosemite (like Emigrant, Carson-Iceberg, etc) are absolutely gorgeous, and all you need is a fire permit.  To specifically answer your questions: 1) No idea. 2) You should check out this list of commonly-used backpacking gear from REI. Bring two liter-sized bottles per person. I like my Katadyn filter a lot, but other options for purification include UV pens, and iodine (drops or tablets). 3) A fire permit is probably required, but the ranger should be able to help you out with that. 4) Relax, have fun.

Yosemite,3a339u,professorincognitox,4,Tue Jun 16 21:09:21 2015 UTC,"If you are looking to catch sunrise, you'll want to be able to face east. The best places that come to mind are Glacier Point or along Tioga Pass Road (such as Olmstead Point). Both of those locations would be easy to park along with parking lots.  As for hiking trails, we'll need more information. Where have you been and what is your fitness level?  But a general question. You're driving that morning to Yosemite? So you're leaving at like 3 am to catch the sunrise?"
Yosemite,3a339u,UCLACommie,2,Tue Jun 16 21:41:08 2015 UTC,"Glacier Point is definitely the best place to catch a sunrise. If I had only 3hrs in the park that's where I would go. As for hikes, Taft Point and Sentinel Dome are easy hikes on the same road as Glacier Point."
Yosemite,3a339u,SmallVillage,1 point,Tue Jun 16 23:08:15 2015 UTC,"My fitness level is above average. I go on weekly hikes (Castle Rock, Big Basin, Mission Peak, etc.) and work out daily. I'll be leaving at 4am to watch the sunrise and then spend the rest of the day hiking. Is there an entrance fee for one day? Is it a parking fee?"
Yosemite,3a339u,UCLACommie,1 point,Wed Jun 17 04:36:35 2015 UTC,"There is a $30 entrance fee; it's not specifically for parking but just driving your car in. If you are going to go back to Yosemite in the next 12 months (or since it sounds like you are in the Bay Area, visit Lassen, Pinnacles or Sequoia / King's Canyon), look at the NPS Pass. It's $80 for the year.  As for hikes, if you head up to Glacier Point, I'd do some hikes around there as was mentioned just to avoid driving too much. You'll beat most of the crowd and don't have to do some silly hike out of the valley."
Yosemite,3a339u,UCLACommie,1 point,Wed Jun 17 04:52:50 2015 UTC,"Is it $80 for every car a year so if I bring different people in my car, it would still be valid?"
Yosemite,3a339u,korravai,1 point,Wed Jun 17 05:20:21 2015 UTC,"Yes, basically. Doesn't even have to be your car; you just need to be there (they claim to check IDs but YMMV). The only real limits that I know of are that you can't use it for commercial purposes, so you can't drive a bus load in."
Yosemite,3a034x,Burusu,4,Tue Jun 16 04:24:46 2015 UTC,"You can safely hike to within 150ft of the summit with no exposure and no climbing experience. From the Cathedral Lakes Trailhead, follow the JMT for about 10 minutes. After a series of 20 or so steps, there is an obvious climbers trail that veers off left of the main trail and is blocked by a log. It's obvious, if you're asking yourself if it's a trail then you're going the wrong way. In about 3 minutes the trail meets up with Budd Creek, follow it for about 2 hrs. If the trail ever seems to disappear, look for rock stacks to show you the way. Once at the base of Cathedral Peak, take an obvious trail up around the right side of the peak marked by carabiner posts. You can safely reach the notch on the north side of the peak with spectacular views of Tuolumne Meadows, Cathedral Lakes, and the Echo Peaks range. If you want to make a complete loop around Cathedral Peak, hike back down to the base and then head cross country towards upper cathedral Lake, following the low angle weakness in the cliff, very safe but sometimes steep 3rd class. You'll eventually meet up with the JMT at Upper Cathedral Lake which you can take back down to the trailhead."
Yosemite,3a034x,SmallVillage,3,Tue Jun 16 14:38:06 2015 UTC,The summit block is class 4 and not a hike. http://www.summitpost.org/cathedral-peak/150524  Offer him Clouds Rest as an alternative
Yosemite,3a034x,jakdak,3,Tue Jun 16 04:40:51 2015 UTC,"We've already hiked Cloud's Rest, El Cap and Half Dome in previous years. Thanks for the confirmation! We will probably hike the Cathedral Lakes and hike to the block and turn around."

Yosemite,39x5ga,UCLACommie,1 point,Mon Jun 15 15:00:25 2015 UTC,How was the bug and mosquito situation? Heading out there soon.
Yosemite,39x5ga,Xanatos24,2,Wed Jun 17 03:03:53 2015 UTC,"Bad but not the worst I've seen. You didn't want to stop near water but places not near water were pretty dry. There was actually still a good amount of snow on the backside of the hike so there was a lot of small puddles everywhere. If you are going to camp anywhere near water, I'd suggest a bug net; otherwise, I never really wanted one other than when I stopped in a few spots.  Where are you hiking? Ten Lakes or somewhere nearby?"
Yosemite,39x5ga,Xanatos24,1 point,Wed Jun 17 03:41:14 2015 UTC,"Thanks! I don;t have a bug net, so I'm hoping it won't be too bad. I should really get one.   Probably from Yosemite Creek to Ten Lakes and then over the Grand Canyon to Glen Aulin, ending at Tuolumne Meadows. What route did you hike?"
Yosemite,39x5ga,Xanatos24,2,Wed Jun 17 04:08:22 2015 UTC,"We went Yosemite Creek to Ten Lakes and down to Tenaya Lake. We were originally going to head to May Lake but realized that we had committed to a bit much (we ended up doing the 25 mile loop in about 27 hours) so cut it short to Tenaya.  Bug net isn't strictly necessary; the bugs didn't really bother me that much while hiking, just while stopped. My buddy was bothered quite a bit though, so it just depends on your tolerance level I think."
Yosemite,39y9u4,Porksoda32,2,Mon Jun 15 19:49:04 2015 UTC,"Lots of water. Nothing to really worry about funk wise. I'd say get a sawyer mini though. They are cheap and easy to use. They weigh more than drops or tablets-- but barely. And  the water tastes delicious in the Sierras, a sawyer mini won't change that, chemicals will."
Yosemite,39y9u4,actuallyarobot,1 point,Mon Jun 15 20:25:23 2015 UTC,"Reviews of the Squeeze & Mini seem really polarized; People either love them or hate them.  How well do they work for, say, 2 people on a week-long trip?  Is the flow rate still fairly good after a week of regular use?  EDIT: I've been leaning toward getting an MSR Hyperflow if I decide to go with a filter, but I think really I just need to establish some sort of warm-n-fuzzy about the Sawyer filters before deciding to go that route."
Yosemite,39y9u4,UCLACommie,1 point,Mon Jun 15 21:49:23 2015 UTC,"I just went backpacking this weekend with someone with the Squeeze. I had the Camelbak gravity filter. He took the twice the time to filter 1L as I did taking 4L. He estimated if he wanted to filter 6L (enough for us to drink 1L there and 2 for hiking / cooking later) it would take him 60 minutes.  He still loves it for when he goes by himself (he did the entire JMT with it) but for 2 people, it's fairly slow to purify water."
Yosemite,39y9u4,actuallyarobot,1 point,Mon Jun 15 22:21:43 2015 UTC,"You have to remember to backflow it every once in a while-- which either en-tales bringing the syringe that comes with it or making an adapter for it out a water bottle cap and some tubing (YouTube sawyer mini modifications). I am bringing one a JMT hike this summer-- I can let you know at the end of July how it holds up to long use in the field.   Rereading where you are hiking though-- u/UCLAcommie is right, there is not much available water on that particular part of the trail other than the Sunrise and Cathedral lakes. Both of those are beautiful places to take a side trip for water and lunch though.   Cathedral Lakes are about 4ish miles from Tuolumne and Sunrise Lakes are a Mile... Mile and a Half from Sunrise Camp on your way to Clouds Rest. After that, it is gonna be dry.  Start early and try to get to the Cathedral range for Sunrise."
Yosemite,39y9u4,UCLACommie,1 point,Mon Jun 15 22:30:13 2015 UTC,"Tuolumne to Yosemite Valley is pretty dry; it's one of the longest stretches of the JMT without water. You'll be able to get water out of Cathedral Lakes and potentially a spring on the uphill towards Cathedral Lake (which I'd put money on being dry).  If you are going to Cloud's Rest, I'd actually suggest a slight detour to Sunrise Lakes. They are beautiful and the first one isn't that far away (and isn't too much elevation change). It'll give you another water source between Cathedral Lake and the Half Dome area."
Yosemite,39y9u4,daemionx,1 point,Mon Jun 15 21:45:36 2015 UTC,"I'm not planning to follow the JMT.  The route I'm planning to take is Tuolumne > Cathedral Lakes > Sunrise Campground > Sunrise Lakes > Cloud's Rest > Happy Isles.  Depending on what time I get to start the first day, I was planning to camp the first night either at Cathedral Lakes or in the area near the designated Sunrise camps, figuring either is likely to have a good water source.  Second night was going to be either a couple of miles before or a couple of miles after Cloud's rest, depending on how far we get that day and where we can find water.  My topo has a few streams in that area, so I'm hoping at least one of them isn't dry."
Yosemite,39y9u4,laughter95,1 point,Tue Jun 16 00:30:07 2015 UTC,"The junction at the bottom of Cloud's Rest back on the JMT has a stream that is usually flowing - you probably won't hit much water after that stream until you start getting near Little Yosemite Valley (well after the Half Dome junction). Be sure to bring enough water from Sunrise to get up Cloud's Rest and back down to the JMT comfortably.  Also, I really recommend the Sunrise High Sierra camp (in the free backpacker's camp). They have running water, a pit toilet, and nice semi-private campsites up on the hill overlooking the gorgeous valley with firepits. The rangers actually cut and gave me a bunch of firewood when I was up there. They had a really interesting talk at sundown on the rock overlooking the valley and then a big campfire where everybody just got to ask the ranger questions. Everybody was welcome - not just the people paying for the tent-cabins there. It was a really different experience than most of my nights on the JMT so was super cool!"
Yosemite,39qbmk,trigenderpyrofox,24,Sat Jun 13 18:44:20 2015 UTC,"I have some bad news for you, friend. The week you are talking about is literally the busiest week in the park. Getting one campsite for the whole week would be impressive enough; getting three will probably take a miracle. Here are your options in the park:   Show up to Camp 4 suuuuuper early in the morning on your first day there. Everyone who is camping needs to be there, as it is per-person rather than per-site. Cross your fingers that everyone gets in (extremely unlikely). Show up to the Valley campground office over by Curry Village early and put your name on the cancellation list. If someone doesn't show to their site the night before or cancels day-of, those sites will be assigned to people on the cancellation list in order. So, you don't need to send more than 3 people to put their names on the list. They assign the sites beginning at 3pm so you need to go early (well before 8am) to put your name on the list, then return at 3 when they know how many sites they'll have. You will have to repeat this process every day you are there, as cancelled sites are usually only good for one night. One or more of the FCFS campgrounds miiiiight have space, since you're arriving on a Wednesday. This is probably the order of likelihood: Yosemite Creek, Tamarack Flat, Bridalveil Creek, White Wolf, Camp 4, Tuolumne Meadows. It is likely that you will have to split your group up over multiple campgrounds, if you are able to find space at all. edited to add: I checked the group sites at Wawona, Hodgdon, and Bridalveil and they are all full as well. There are a couple of group sites at other campgrounds too but I didn't have time to check them. Since you have more than 13 people you could get one of those sites if it opens up -- check a couple of times a day to see if another group cancels.   At any point on your day of arrival you can call 209/372-0266 to hear a recording of which campgrounds still have space and which are full. There are also signs at each entrance but these have to be updated by people and may be slightly out of date. The recording has the most up-to-date information.  There are campgrounds in the surrounding national forests and communities but they are likely to be full as well. You could try calling some of the commercial campgrounds to see if they have any reservable spaces left. Try Indian Flat, Yosemite Lakes, or Camp Mather.  (How did your campsite plans ""fall through?"" Did you not have a reservation?)"

Well about the sites long story short some friends had a large trip planned that they decided not to go on and they offered us the sites so we planned a trip! But then they ended up taking them back (oh well!) and we are trying to go anyway! Thanks for all the helpful info!
Yosemite,39qbmk,efficientmarkets,5,Sun Jun 14 00:29:39 2015 UTC,"That just seems like way too many people for one person to organize a trip in a national park, especially if you don't actually have reservations yet, and are not a professional guide. You + 17 others waitlisting all over the park for a week? Sounds like a logistical nightmare, and strong likelihood of going into the park, realizing it's impossible to keep the group together as people randomly fill last-minute cancellations, and if you all have to be together, then you all will leave the park together and camp in a vacant motel in Merced instead. Maybe you are a professional adventure guide? I think they plan trips 6 mo in advance, however.  You could consider breaking up the group into 2-3 person teams that go figure out how to find lodging themselves.   Your friends who rickrolled you and 17 others into a Yosemite trip and then rescinded their offer for their campsite reservations are piece of shit friends."
Yosemite,39qbmk,jakdak,4,Sun Jun 14 01:49:32 2015 UTC,"Your odds of getting a campsite for that large of a group and that long of a stay anywhere in the Sierra on what will likely be the busiest holiday week of the summer are basically nil.  Your best bet might be to check AirBnb to see if anyone in Foresta, Wawona, or the gateway communities has a house to rent- but that's likely a longshot and will be pricy."
Yosemite,39qbmk,bfg_foo,2,Sun Jun 14 01:20:33 2015 UTC,"If the sites your friends offered you were in the park, you wouldn't have been able to use them anyway - the person who made the reservation has to be there with a photo ID to check in. So at least you were spared going to the park and not being able to use the sites.  Might be time to plan a trip for somewhere else. Lassen Volcanic is absolutely gorgeous - it's like a combination of Yellowstone (thermal features), Glacier, and Yosemite in miniature, and it sees a fraction of the visitation of those parks. Highly recommended."

Yosemite,39qdli,TheMarkTomHollisShow,1 point,Sat Jun 13 19:02:05 2015 UTC,Clouds Rest and Half Dome are definitely places to see. I don't think you have time on a 3 day hike though unless you're experienced and in good shape. I just did a 5 day trip from Tuolumne to Happy Isles including Clouds Rest and Half dome and that was pretty tough. Sunrise Lakes are nice so definitely stop to check those out.  With the drought there are a few places where water has dried up so get water where you see it. Here's a marked up map of our first 3 nights with a bit of info http://m.imgur.com/wMgR655  Enjoy the hike!

Yosemite,39qdli,GoSh4rks,1 point,Sun Jun 14 05:47:06 2015 UTC,Straight distance isn't the problem. There's a lot of elevation gain and loss along the way that makes it tiring.
Yosemite,39qdli,dubs425,2,Sun Jun 14 13:57:04 2015 UTC,"The only ""serious"" climb with packs is up to Sunrise, which is fairly short, and the one up to Clouds Rest, which isn't that steep. The rest is downhill except Half Dome, where you wouldn't take you packs up with you.  I've done it the other way, starting from the Valley in 2 nights and it was a really relaxed trip. Granted, we didn't do Half Dome, but we started at Happy Isles near sunset, camped at the HD junction, and didn't start up to Clouds Rest until afternoon, where we camped that 2nd night."

It isn't that far.   I've day hiked this.  It is more than doable as a 3 day pack and wouldn't even be terribly difficult to do as an overnight with the night atop clouds rest or at the Sunrise Creek crossing at the JMT/Clouds rest spur junction.
Yosemite,39qdli,jakdak,1 point,Sun Jun 14 16:02:44 2015 UTC,"With that amount of time, I would suggest starting day 1 from May Lake (take the hikers shuttle) and ending the night at Sunrise Lakes. Day 2 hike to Cloud's rest/Half-Dome and end in Little Yosemite Valley. Day 3 take the Panorama Trail/4 mile Trail to Yosemite Valley. It may be arduous but it will be worth it."
Yosemite,39qdli,yosemitetrailblazer,1 point,Sun Jun 14 05:45:47 2015 UTC,"I camped at the western Sunrise Lake recently on my hike from Cathedral Lakes trailhead to Clouds Rest and then to the Valley. It was a pretty nice, secluded place to camp, no one around at all, but there were a few fire rings already there. The mosquitos were pretty brutal, though, but otherwise it was great.  The hike from Cloud's Rest to where it begins to get crowded in the Valley was a little less scenic to me, so I think there isn't so much to do there until you get closer to the Valley."

Yosemite,39o4b7,maxillo,2,Sun Jun 14 21:15:27 2015 UTC,Guessing its off of 120- anything out of the Valley would start with a climb out of the valley and not have a starting flat section.  The lower Young lake doesn't have islands tho.

Yosemite,39iv2y,jakdak,1 point,Fri Jun 12 02:42:08 2015 UTC,foo is absolutely right- pretty much every campsite in the Sierra fills up on Thu/Fri on summer weekend.  Odds of a walk-in anywhere on a Sat are pretty minimal.  (And anecdotally from looking at the vacancy signs on 395 over the years- odds of getting a motel room are pretty slim as well)

You'll be able to see the entire route from the trailhead so you can make a judgement call before you go.

We're both pretty fit and hiked it pretty fast, and even though we had acclimated by coming up the day before and bumming around the park, I still seriously felt it 2/3rds of the way up; 1,000 feet of elevation gain per mile is pretty intense, apparently.  For what it's worth, my primary mode of exercise at the time were biking and bouldering, so take this with a grain of salt.  Other notes: The hike is a lot shorter than you think it will be, you'll be done before lunch time (although you should definitely snack along the way, it helps). There's not much to do in the Tuols except hike and climb. The snack shack is cool, there's a gear shop up there too if I recall. The snack shack has pretty good food, considering."
Yosemite,39ht13,kennethsime,1 point,Fri Jun 12 04:41:42 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the tips!  I've been working on doing a lot of elevation change in my climbs.  I've camped at 6,500' and climbed to 10k feet and felt nothing.  Then two weeks ago I went from sea level to 10,800' and felt like shit at 9k feet. This past saturday, I went from ~200' to 10,400' feet and felt nothing.  So I'm hoping a summit of Hoffman on Friday and staying in Tuolomne over night will be decent acclimatization enough for a summit bid on Dana Saturday.  I am prepped for the shit ~20% average grade up to the summit...i hope!"

Yosemite,39euyp,grizzlycuts,2,Fri Jun 12 00:35:10 2015 UTC,We left at 5am and got to the top around 11:15am with some resting breaks in between hiking. Got back to our campsite at 5pm. It was a very long and tough hike with a lot of elevation gain. Especially near the end.  We starting from our campsite in Upper Pines which is near the trailhead.  It was a very nice day. It rained the day before so we were worried it would on the day we hiked but it turned out to be a nice day.
Yosemite,39euyp,grizzlycuts,1 point,Fri Jun 12 01:06:21 2015 UTC,"that's awesome. Did you have to reserver a year in advance? I've been wanting to do this, but will probably have to try my luck with the weekend of, hoping someone cancels."

Yosemite,39cm65,xelanil,1 point,Thu Jun 11 02:36:53 2015 UTC,"You could check out Lembert Dome which is short and popular. The downside of Lembert Dome is it's popular. If you want something quite long, mostly flat, photogenic, and chill you could check out Mount Lyell. If you feel hardcore you can try Mt. Hoffmann which is shorter than Lyell but has more elevation gain."
Yosemite,39cm65,jakdak,1 point,Thu Jun 11 03:28:45 2015 UTC,"something quite long, mostly flat, photogenic, and chill you could check out Mount Lyell   Um, a Lyell dayhike is 26 miles round trip (more if you include McLure), 5k+ of gain, tops out at over 13k and requires a glacier traverse by the common route.  Not exactly ""Chill"" :) (And the standard route to Hoffman has less than half of that gain)  Edit: I think you might have meant Lyell Canyon- that is indeed ""Chill"" (or at least it is once skeeter season is over)"
Yosemite,39cm65,xelanil,1 point,Thu Jun 11 16:33:40 2015 UTC,"Oh right yes I meant Lyell Canyon (sorry OP), I thought those were the same trail. I did Lyell in a ""day"" hike and it was about 8 miles flat and 5 miles of insane gains. Even so it was quite nice right after the flat area."
Yosemite,39cm65,jakdak,1 point,Thu Jun 11 16:54:53 2015 UTC,Yes its the same trail (or at least it is until you leave the trail to head towards the peak)  Its actually the JMT's Lyell Canyon trailhead and its one of the flattest sections of trail in the park until you hit the head of the canyon and start the climb up toward Donoghue Pass.
Yosemite,39cm65,Me_for_President,0,Thu Jun 11 17:34:15 2015 UTC,Either of the two routes to Nevada Falls is pretty great. I recommend going up the John Muir trail to the top of Nevada Falls and then coming down the Mist Trail. Going up the Mist Trail is fairly strenuous compared to the Muir Trail.   The hike to the top of Yosemite Falls is really strenuous but amazing.

Yosemite,39ct9z,ilikebison,1 point,Wed Jun 10 22:13:21 2015 UTC,"There's no free shuttle to glacier, but you can pay for a one way or round trip ride to the top. It's a long drive up (1hr each way), so you may be better off taking your own car rather than the shuttle. It is pretty pricey if you do decide to take the bus.  Early AM parking isn't so bad, but it did seem to get crowded around 9h30-10h00am, early on weekends.  Have a great trip !"
Yosemite,39ct9z,babyjhesus1,1 point,Thu Jun 11 00:17:17 2015 UTC,"I assume you're staying in the valley? All of my advice applies to there as I've never stayed more than a few hours in other parts.  I've only been twice during March the last few years, and even then parking around the valley at all of the stop-offs were pretty full around 11am, but spots will open up if you drive slowly and don't mind parking on the north side and hiking over to the south side to see El Cap and other spots. It was spring break, but I believe late June will still be busier. Parking at Glacier Point and the Taft Point (a must!) trailhead was not bad, but it was also the first weekend it was open, earliest weekend ever, so I may have been lucky there.   Taft Point and Sentinel dome are very easy hikes from the trailhead and HIGHLY recommended. Easy for little kids too, although Sentinel Dome does require mild rock scrambling that you can just help with. I saw a 100 year old looking man with a cane do it.  Glacier shuttle is something like $20 per person? It's insane for a family IMO, just drive up and park. Other shuttles around the valley are free and there are tons of maps at key shuttle stops. Feel free to google beforehand. They run late too, I think Mirror Lake goes until 10pm or so? We always stayed at Upper Pines and were surprised when shuttles were still running.  What age is the family and where are you staying? Other options too like biking around the valley are great for little kids. I don't have them (bikes or kids), but have always seen lots of them biking around the valley.  Yosemite Hikes (http://www.yosemitehikes.com/) is an excellent site for good descriptions on hikes around the park. It'll give you a good description so you can decide what your family is up for."
Yosemite,39ct9z,bloobeard,1 point,Thu Jun 11 00:41:08 2015 UTC,"I'm stuck in the same conundrum as OP, but I was wondering: if I drive and park my car at Glacier Point, then hike the Panorama Trail down to the valley floor.... how do I get my car afterwards? I see the three Glacier Point shuttles that leave the floor at 8:30, 10, and another time, then leave Glacier Point at 10:30 am, etc, but nothing later that evening..... any advice?"

Yosemite,398krx,bfg_foo,1 point,Fri Jun 19 00:35:53 2015 UTC,"This is a tricky one. There is a bus from Visalia to Sequoia, including one that leaves at 6am which would get you to Lodgepole around the time you want. You'd have to figure out how to get from Fresno to Visalia, though, or drive there instead of to Fresno. https://www.sequoiashuttle.com/  There is a bus from Fresno to Kings Canyon, but not to Sequoia. Are you absolutely set on departing from Lodgepole? If you are ok with departing from Grant Grove instead, you can take the new Big Trees Transit directly there from Fresno airport: https://www.bigtreestransit.com/information/ Or, take it there and then hitch from Grant Grove to Lodgepole. Otherwise, you're probably looking at hitching the whole way from Fresno, which I would not recommend."

Yosemite,398krx,Noblebastard,1 point,Wed Jun 10 04:38:32 2015 UTC,From Visalia the one you want is Sequoia Shuttle. Your next task will be finding a car rental place that will let you drop it off that early; you might need to take a later shuttle to Lodgepole if the car places aren't open yet.
Yosemite,397yk9,milesahead89,7,Tue Jun 9 22:21:52 2015 UTC,"I just did Cloud's Rest for the first time. Started at Tenaya Lake. It gives you a lot of what Half Dome does but w/o the permits and crowds. It also puts you in Tuolumne Meadows which is the best part of the park, imo."
Yosemite,397yk9,pharohman,3,Tue Jun 9 22:30:09 2015 UTC,"I'm doing that same hike next week. How bad are the mosquitos? How deep was the Tenaya Creek crossing near the trailhead?  UPDATE: Tenaya Creek crossings were no problem, especially with hiking poles. Just step across on the rocks - barely even got the soles of my boots wet. Mosquitos were annoying, but not too terrible. We camped by the pond between the Sunrise junction and Clouds Rest, and the bugs were enough to drive us into the tent in the early afternoon, but quickly were gone once things cooled off. They came back again in the morning, usually right after breakfast, as the air started to warm up. DEET just slows them down a bit, the bastards."
Yosemite,397yk9,palebluebob,1 point,Tue Jun 9 22:49:27 2015 UTC,I always bring plenty of DEET bug spray when I visit Tuolumne.

Hike the Panorama trail back to the Valley. You get changing views of the valley as you progress and close ups of the Nevada/Vernal falls as you go down the Mist trail at the end.   Edit: Just saw that this is in September, so no Yosemite falls and the Mist trail will not be misty. Still amazing views though, really demonstrates the vastness of the valley."
Yosemite,397yk9,korravai,6,Tue Jun 9 23:06:31 2015 UTC,"I highly recommend Sentinel Dome at sunset which you can plan according to this. The nice thing is the hike is only 2.2 miles (round trip).   Make sure to bring plenty of warm clothes, a thermos for tea or something, and a box of tissues for when you cry over how beautiful it is.  If you're looking for something more challenging then I recommend Mt. Hoffmann, note that it's pretty high up so the air is thinner. Bring plenty of DEET bug spray when you go. It gives you a pretty good view of Tuolumne Meadows."
Yosemite,397yk9,xelanil,1 point,Tue Jun 9 23:57:41 2015 UTC,"If you have DEET handy, go ahead and bring it - but in late September, it'll be rare that there will be any use for it."

The swimming at the top felt, quite literally, like swimming in heaven. The view along the way and from the top is quite stunning as well. I know it's not as strenuous and intense as the other suggestions, but it might be a good sendoff."
Yosemite,397yk9,Perceptivestudent,1 point,Wed Jun 10 04:48:25 2015 UTC,"4 mile trail to glacier point, then panorama trail back down to the floor via Nevada falls.

Yosemite,396y96,ridthebeast,4,Tue Jun 9 18:23:12 2015 UTC,"Next time you're hiking in the Sierra, look for black burned out tree stumps. There are tons of them. These are all caused by lightning strikes."
Yosemite,396y96,SmallVillage,1 point,Tue Jun 9 19:56:02 2015 UTC,Been caught inside a high elevation cloudburst a few times.  It is terrifying.
Yosemite,396y96,jakdak,3,Tue Jun 9 21:44:35 2015 UTC,For now you're not risking your life so much as potential discomfort. Read up a bit on lighting position and what to do if caught in the middle of the storm.  I definitely wouldn't cut your trip short yet though.   The trend in the valley lately has been sunny days with storms for a couple hours in the afternoon.  If it does that in the high country it means you'll have time for your stuff to dry out.  If it were me I would bring my best rain gear and see what happens once I'm out there.  Don't be afraid to hike out of you feel you can't take it anymore.
Yosemite,396y96,GreatBallsOfFIRE,2,Tue Jun 9 19:01:14 2015 UTC,"constant rain sucks, but brief showers and t-storms can be fun. Just don't hide under trees from the lightning :)   bring extra socks in ziploc bags.  The park service says   Sudden changes in weather catch many unaware. Drenching thunderstorms can form in a matter of hours, and snow can fall at any time of the year. Be prepared for all weather conditions. Thunderstorms are a frequent and spectacular occurrence in the Yosemite Wilderness. These summer storms often bring intense rain, hail, and lightning strikes, particularly in mid to late afternoon (but can occur at any time). Plan to be over passes and away from high open areas by noon. During a storm, stay away from peaks (particularly Half Dome), ridges, caves, water, and open areas. Seek shelter in low forested areas, but avoid tall, solitary trees. By setting up camp in a safe location before lightning begins, you can enjoy the power and spectacle of a mountain thunderstorm without apprehension.   I'd suggest reading up on lightning storm safety before you go too, just to ease your mind."
Yosemite,396y96,bigdaddybodiddly,2,Tue Jun 9 18:58:13 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the advice, everyone! I feel a lot more confident hiking out into these conditions after your input, we'll stick to the plan for now and wait until Mother Nature tells us something different :)  I CAN'T FREAKING WAIT!"
Yosemite,397ng3,loru_90,2,Tue Jun 9 21:06:35 2015 UTC,"Well, I think it completely depends on how high a ""small cliff"" is. And what it means by looked down upon. In general, Yosemite's rules basically prohibit going somewhere specifically that you'll die and prohibit messing with wildlife or plantlife.  Swimming is allowed every where but certain places. The former rule above prohibits one swimming area in the places you'll be around (the top of Vernal Falls). Please don't swim here. People basically die in Yosemite falling off cliffs or going down waterfalls. It's stupid. On your last day, you'll likely be close to Sunrise Lakes. These are great lakes - 'fairly' remote and easy to get into. Great spot to swim and some nice rocks to chill around. If you relax, don't make too much noise and don't do anything dangerous, you'll be fine.  Make a lot of noise? Rough house in the water? Be a pest? Ranger could definitely remove you.  Edit: One other note. The trail you've chosen is literally the most popular overnight trail in Yosemite (as it's the start of the John Muir Trail). You won't see hoards of people past Half Dome but you'll likely see people at least every hour or so."

Yosemite,39258j,aboutachair,2,Mon Jun 8 18:29:08 2015 UTC,"I was just up there this last October. First there is absolutely no swimming in Bass Lake. I know, lame :( When I was just up there the water level was low, but still plenty of water for boating. If you look at an airel view of the lake, just imagine that all the smaller coves off to the sides are dry and the overall water level is probably about 20ish feet below what their website will show with all their nice photos. For example the entire dock that is in front of the restaurant is on land now, not floating like it should. Keep in mind that this isnt all drought related. A waitress there told me they had put in a dam on one end and had to divert water from the lake, but they were expecting more rain fall to help fill it, and then the drought happened. Not sure when it will look as nice as the website again.  Its still very pretty there, and I did enjoy fishing off the side of the bay and hI king around the lake. If you plan on renting a boat, they have a $500 deposit hold that they have to put onto a credit card, and if you don't have one they will do it with a  debit card, but it will take you like 3 days to get the money off the hold and back onto your card.     Also, if you plan on going to Yosemite, the park entrance is maybe a 30-40 min ride away from Bass Lake. I definitely found Bass Lake to be more quiet and secluded than Yosemite."

Yosemite,38t85z,HGFantomas,3,Sat Jun 6 16:56:01 2015 UTC,"Panorama Trail is a very scenic and moderately strenuous day hike. It gets a little tough on the knees when you first hit the Mist Trail going down from Nevada Fall, but the trail itself is full of stunning views and photo ops. We took the tour bus to Glacier Point and hiked down at around 10:30 AM. Took us around 6 hours."
Yosemite,38t85z,dafoosball13,3,Sat Jun 6 18:14:55 2015 UTC,The guy who writes http://www.yosemitehikes.com/ is a great resource for doing hike research - I'd recommend checking it out!

Yosemite,38t85z,turn0,2,Sun Jun 7 22:49:16 2015 UTC,"Go to Tuolumne for a day. There are a lot less tourists and the area is much more secluded. Upper Cathedral Lake, May Lake, and Clouds Rest are great hikes."
Yosemite,38t85z,SmallVillage,1 point,Sat Jun 6 17:59:39 2015 UTC,"Moderate ones are mentioned in other comment: UYF and NF via Mist Trail.   Intense: clouds rest, eagle peak via UYF"

Yosemite,38tvoc,itty53,1 point,Tue Jun 9 18:13:32 2015 UTC,"Some tips I've discovered over the years...I first check the webcams. Actual live video doesn't lie.  http://www.yosemiteconservancy.org/webcams I also use El Portal, CA as the city to check weather, it's the nearest town to the Valley and I find is usually more accurate especially in regards to rain. I suspect that some weather outlets include the High Sierra areas of the park when you search ""Yosemite"", or ""Yosemite National Park"", which has much more inconsistent weather patterns. Lastly, I check the Yosemite Valley water district readings. This gives you accurate temps and precipitation from the day before, but no forecasting. http://cdec.water.ca.gov/cgi-progs/queryF?s=YYV"
Yosemite,38tvoc,SmallVillage,1 point,Sat Jun 6 21:11:58 2015 UTC,"El Portal is 2000 get lower elevation than the valley, so don't generalize their weather reports too much.  Just make sure that the report you look at says ""Yosemite Valley"" and not ""Yosemite National Park."""
Yosemite,38tvoc,GreatBallsOfFIRE,1 point,Sun Jun 7 03:09:52 2015 UTC,"The trend has been sunny warm mornings and heavy thunderstorms starting in the afternoon that go for a few hours.  If you have good rain gear I wouldn't worry too much. As long as you stay dry, it's still relatively warm, and the rain makes the smells come out, settles the haze in the atmosphere, and makes for really pretty clouds and low mists.    If you're up early after a wet night, you get to watch steam rising off of every surface, it's quite pretty!"
Yosemite,38tvoc,GreatBallsOfFIRE,1 point,Sun Jun 7 03:13:55 2015 UTC,"I was just there this weekend (2 days ago), it's been a bit cloudy/stormy off and on, but never a constant storm, just rains here and there with some impressively loud thunder but cleared up later in the day. Yosemite is beautiful in all kinds of weather though!"
Yosemite,38qtwn,jakdak,2,Sat Jun 6 01:06:48 2015 UTC,"Well they didn't mention the Yosemite Mountain Sugar Pine Railroad, which is just outside the South entrance to the park in Fish Camp. You can ride a bigass steam train, look at old shit in their museum, do some gold panning, buy overpriced stuff from the gift shop, check out the locomotive and Yosemite-related bookstore and art gallery, and sometimes they have a night train with dinner and entertainment.  Yes it's outside the park but so are some of the other places they mention so I thought I'd throw it out there. It's a fun place."
Yosemite,38kmm1,DontTrustThatVendor,3,Thu Jun 4 20:51:56 2015 UTC,Can confirm. Stayed at camp 4 from last Thursday-Sunday we arrived at 4:45am and grabbed some Zs in line.

Yosemite,38kmm1,UCLACommie,2,Sun Jun 7 20:48:41 2015 UTC,The only one in the Valley is Camp 4. I've always heard that you need to be there between 4-6 am for summer weekends and earlier for holiday weekends.
Yosemite,38kmm1,jrm0317,1 point,Thu Jun 4 22:49:30 2015 UTC,"Do you or /u/JC84909 know anything about first come first serve back country permits? In terms of what time to get in line. I'll be starting from the Cathedral Lakes trailhead on June the 18th, permits permitting."
Yosemite,38kmm1,UCLACommie,1 point,Fri Jun 5 20:24:09 2015 UTC,"Usually about the same time, though a Thursday you're probably a little better off. I think the important piece is to make sure you are at the right wilderness center (not sure if that's Tuolumne or Valley). I've gotten there at bit before 6 am and still gotten a permit. If you have any flexibility, you'll be fine. I'd just look for alternate trailheads - you'll definitely get a permit."
Yosemite,38kmm1,OverlyPersonal,1 point,Fri Jun 5 23:01:55 2015 UTC,"I've done it a lot in the high country.  It's usually not too bad if you show up early on a weekday, like 8-9 or so.  Probably no one is leaving on a Saturday so your chances are lower.  If you're not set on one campground you can just roll down Tioga and check them all: White Wolf (never had much luck here) to Yosemite creek to porcupine flats to tuoloumne (never had much luck here either).  If it's a busy weekend and you don't have any luck in the park there's a couple more campgrounds on the way down mono pass."

Yosemite,38egf1,jackowacko7,2,Wed Jun 3 22:00:59 2015 UTC,Did you do that in 1 day? Up and down?
Yosemite,38egf1,harpervalleypta,1 point,Wed Jun 3 22:23:58 2015 UTC,Yup.  Not really much longer than Half Dome. Took about 9 hours.  Better than lugging a pack up El Capitan :)
Yosemite,38egf1,harpervalleypta,2,Wed Jun 3 22:31:37 2015 UTC,did this this two weeks ago was the best trip i ever have been on.
Yosemite,38egf1,harpervalleypta,1 point,Thu Jun 4 04:48:14 2015 UTC,How difficult was it to follow the old road?  I noticed in your album you lost the trail for a little bit.
Yosemite,388uit,mrneverland9000,1 point,Tue Jun 2 17:37:42 2015 UTC,"You should look into getting some quality rain gear.  This of course will not make exposed hiking during lightning storms safe, but will certainly make any hike with rain much more enjoyable.  Some of the modern Gore-Tex products are very light weight and breathable.  I know this doesn't answer your question about trails for bad weather, but rain gear really is one of those pieces of gear that really pays off when the weather gets nasty (as it typically does) in the mountains.  edit: added words"

Yosemite,388uit,korravai,1 point,Wed Jun 3 13:42:31 2015 UTC,"I'm with you.  I used to skip the rain gear but after getting caught in it a few times and having a miserable slog back to the car or a shivering night at camp one too many times, I decided that rain gear was as important as shoes or a pack."
Yosemite,388uit,korravai,1 point,Wed Jun 3 16:59:51 2015 UTC,Just did the loop this weekend. My advice is to start earlier than you think you'll need to. We burned a solid 2 hours of downtime throughout the whole hike as we stopped so often to take pictures and spent a lot of time at Glacier point.
Yosemite,388uit,BattleMonkey123,1 point,Thu Jun 4 05:04:13 2015 UTC,Did it rain when you did the hike? Any precautions we should take? We plan to leave from San Jose at 3:30am and get there by 7:30am to start.
Yosemite,388uit,rockb8,1 point,Thu Jun 4 06:47:12 2015 UTC,"No rain at all for us luckily. 7:30 am should be fine.   You might want to park at the Yosemite Lodge day-use lot and walk to the 4 mile trailhead so you don't have to try and do a multi-shuttle shuffle or long walk back to your car at the end (also the El Capitan shuttle ends much earlier than the Valley Shuttle). You'll only need the valley shuttle from Happy Isles back to the lodge parking.   For the hike itself, I used hiking poles and was grateful for them, but I have weak knees. I'm not entirely convinced that hiking down the Mist Trail (vs. going down the JMT) was worth it. I would definitely go over to the top of Nevada Falls and stand on the bridge and go to the little viewing area on the opposite side. But going downhill on the rocky wet steps was definitely trying after a day of hiking and weak legs.  You might be heartier than we were though so up to you!  Also re your rain question, the Mist Trail will definitely be like a drizzling rain so you should either expect to get wet (which felt fine to us as it was warm) or have rain gear planned anyway."
Yosemite,388uit,jakdak,1 point,Thu Jun 4 23:41:51 2015 UTC,How far is the Yosemite Lodge day-use from the 4 Mile trailhead? Thanks for updating btw!
Yosemite,388uit,HelmuthvonMoltke,1 point,Fri Jun 5 05:00:10 2015 UTC,Hike the Mist Trail....you're going to be wet no matter what!
Yosemite,388hzz,RoverSon8,6,Tue Jun 2 16:31:53 2015 UTC,"The mist trail portion is only about 300 yards of wet area if the falls are raging, and it's almost all trail stairs. You will want shoes with a nice grip on smooth rock for going up and down the cables though. Any newer pair of shoes will do. I hike in trail running shoes, some people prefer boots with ankle support, there is really no right answer, only preference."
Yosemite,388hzz,SmallVillage,2,Tue Jun 2 17:31:23 2015 UTC,Sticky soles is key.  I've done it a few times now and you'll occasionally see someone freaking out on the cables because their skate or running shoes have turned to ice skates.  In my experience anything vibram is money on granite.
Yosemite,388hzz,OverlyPersonal,2,Wed Jun 3 15:52:57 2015 UTC,"Personally, More than the smooth rock on HalfDome, where you at least had cables to hold on to, the bare rocks on Quarter Dome with loose gravel on them was scarier!"
Yosemite,388hzz,im-the-stig,1 point,Wed Jun 3 20:48:51 2015 UTC,So your vote is for sticky soles as well?
Yosemite,388hzz,Groutfloat,5,Wed Jun 3 21:31:05 2015 UTC,"Considering our drought condition there is an excellent chance that the mist trail isn't going to be misty in August. My recommendation is to start early, like 5 am early. It will help avoid the heat and crowd."
Yosemite,388hzz,calrdt12,3,Tue Jun 2 19:19:56 2015 UTC,"The wet portion of the Mist Trail is actually tackier than the dry sections. There's a fine layer of what we call ""moon dust"" on polished granite steps (which are being phased out for a rougher cut). My personal suggestion is an approach shoe made by 5.10. The new version of the Camp 4 now comes with a higher top if you want. The sticky rubber is great on granite.  Fair warning, regardless of how good your shoes are, the cable route is fairly slippery. If you're planning on using gloves, a good pair of ""Mechanix"" gloves or a rubber palmed garden glove is best. Please take your gloves with you when you finish the cable section. Leaving them at the base of the cables is littering and the gloves often blow off the side of Half Dome.   When you come back down the trail, strongly consider taking the John Muir trail down. It's a mile and a half longer, but an easier way down and less risky when you're dragging from the hike."
Yosemite,388hzz,Godhelpthisoldman,1 point,Thu Jun 4 01:37:56 2015 UTC,"This. Look at the people who live and work in the park. They wear approaches on granite. Also agree on JMT for the way down, better on the knees"
Yosemite,388hzz,calrdt12,1 point,Thu Jun 4 03:23:35 2015 UTC,"Based on the feedback, I am definitely favoring an approach shoe.    Thanks for clarifying the glove issue - I've seen elsewhere the suggestion to leave the gloves."
Yosemite,388hzz,gherbst007,1 point,Thu Jun 4 18:03:05 2015 UTC,"Happy to provide it. The 5.10 Camp 4 is definitely my choice. The gloves get thrown away as often as possible because the pile tends to get out of hand, moldy, and raided by the squirrels/marmots."
Yosemite,388hzz,harpervalleypta,2,Thu Jun 4 18:59:31 2015 UTC,"Keen Targhee II Mids.   Been up a dozen times with em.  Light weight, wide foot bed is Keen-tastic for the switchbacks.  Agreed, unless you get caught out in a Fall afternoon rainshower, you don't have to plan around water hazards."
Yosemite,388hzz,Waspbee,2,Tue Jun 2 17:50:14 2015 UTC,I have the low top version of this shoe and have been thoroughly impressed with their performance.  They'll be taking me up the cables on Half Dome this upcoming Fall.
Yosemite,388hzz,bowball,2,Tue Jun 2 19:51:35 2015 UTC,"I am also going up half dome in mid august. As others have said, the mist trail will not be a problem. I personally prefer approach shoes, which are a mix of trail runners and rock climbing shoes. The grip is incredible. I have heard stories of people climbing the cables without actually using the cables themselves with approach shoes. But the tradeoff is less ankle support. It depends on your preferences, but the granite on half dome trail is perfect for approach shoes. Have a good hike!"
Yosemite,384srp,thedailynathan,2,Mon Jun 1 21:20:53 2015 UTC,That picture is gorgeous.

Yosemite,385jna,GoSh4rks,1 point,Tue Jun 2 15:56:04 2015 UTC,"Just call them. It may take a few tries, but it shouldn't be that bad getting a hold of somebody at this time of the year.  But whatever way you contact them, you don't actually get anything of value in the mail. They used to send out letter and email confirmations, but this year I only got emails for my two reservations. The permit isn't actually issued until you show up at the permit station, and no ""ticket"" is required, all you really need is just your name."
Yosemite,385jna,harpervalleypta,1 point,Tue Jun 2 07:26:56 2015 UTC,I've faxed my permit requests twice.  The first one was confirmed via email within a few hours.  The second was confirmed about 24 hours after I sent it.
Yosemite,385jna,UCLACommie,1 point,Tue Jun 2 14:57:47 2015 UTC,"I've faxed in (using HelloFax since who has fax machines?) 6 times. I found out each time in a few hours. But when you fax it in matters. Because of their reservation system, employees start working on the permits first thing in the morning. Every time I've been accepted, I've sent my permit in before 7:30 am and I've then heard by about 3 or 4 pm the same day (less than 12 hours later). If you send it in later in the day it'll take a little longer."
Yosemite,383raa,ridthebeast,3,Mon Jun 1 17:18:59 2015 UTC,"I was in Tuolumne Meadows last week. The mosquitos were swarming pretty bad for about an hour at sunset then disappeared when the temps dropped and the wind picked up. I didn't get bit though and no one I was with got bit either and only one of us had used bug spray. The next day I didn't see any mosquitos on my hike up to Cathedral Peak which tops out at 10,900ft."
Yosemite,383raa,SmallVillage,2,Tue Jun 2 17:46:07 2015 UTC,Wohoo!
Yosemite,383raa,YosemiteFan,3,Tue Jun 2 18:00:21 2015 UTC,"I did a two night trip to Upper Young lake in 2010, late July.  It was the worst mosquito experience of my life.  The upper lake, in particular, has quite a boggy shore, which is ideal for mosquitoes.  It is also the quietest and, imho, most scenic lake.  We used the 98% DEET stuff which would keep them at bay for 10-15 minutes or so until they started coming after us again.  If it wasn't so utterly spectacular up there it would have spoiled it for us.  We took refuge in our tent at times, but it was too damn hot in the tent at mid-day, so it was a tough call.  So, plan for mosquitoes, but I hope that you don't encounter much.  I really wished we had some kind of netting so that we could get some respite - I'd have gladly carried the extra weight.  /side note - my favorite photo from my Young Lakes trip.

Yosemite,383raa,jakdak,2,Sun Jun 7 04:04:22 2015 UTC,From this weekend the skeeters were swarming but not biting up to about 7k elevation.    I believe that it is still dipping below freezing in the high country- which should be keeping the skeeters at bay for the moment- but I'm guessing that will be ending in the next week or so and after that they'll be out in force.  Your trip is likely going to be right on the cusp of that.
Yosemite,383raa,jakdak,1 point,Mon Jun 1 17:24:46 2015 UTC,Thanks for the heads up! Of course my first trip to Yosemite I started planning 6 months ago would be during the annual mosquito rave festival.
Yosemite,383raa,jakdak,2,Mon Jun 1 18:44:51 2015 UTC,The good news (and possibly the only good news from the drought) is that its far drier than usual out there so the skeeter season should be muted.

That is roughly 5 miles from the floor of the valley up about 2,000 feet in elev and puts you right near the south face of Half Dome. From there you can hit trails to Cloud's Rest, Merced Lake, Half Dome Cables, etc.  I'm trying to get a friend or two to go with me June 19-20, weather should be killer. Have a great time!!!"

Note that Yosemite Valley, where you'll probably spend all your time, is like an hour inside the park. Idk about Oakhurt, but confirm whether it's an hour from the park, or an hour from Yosemite Valley.  Just a couple weeks ago we stayed at this airbnb, and it was incredible for the price. I felt the pics on airbnb didnt do it justice: Clean room, kitchenette, grill on the patio. And inside the park, only 20 minutes from Yosemite Valley! Stop at a store along the way, do breakfast and dinners in the studio.  So we drove in, did a half day in the valley, and just walked around the valley floor, did very short hikes. TBH i was bored day 1, so maybe recommend lining up something bigger.  But day 2, HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend Nevada Falls. We followed the advice in this article  to go clockwise; up Mist trail, down John Muir. It was awesome, took us about 6 hours with lots of stopping for pics."

Potter always maintained that the ascent was both lawful and respectful. “I was just climbing a beautiful rock that hadn’t been free climbed before,” he told me in February.   It seems that he did some things that weren't viewed as 'ok' before."
Yosemite,36bcpv,nokstar,6,Mon May 18 22:09:28 2015 UTC,"The Delicate Arch thing seems different to me.  BASE jumping is really only a danger to himself.  Climbing a landmark that is, well, delicate, really seems like a case of ""the rules apply to others but not to me"".   He said this about the arch:   the Delicate Arch really is fragile and repeated climbing would inevitably cause damage   So maybe don't do that?"
Yosemite,36bcpv,-KhmerBear-,2,Mon May 18 22:25:32 2015 UTC,Agreed.
Yosemite,36bcpv,nokstar,2,Mon May 18 22:37:41 2015 UTC,Skydivers and BASE jumpers get that from everyone.  They jump fully aware of the risks.  It's pretty disrespectful to assume they don't...

Nevada and Vernal Falls are great hikes, so is Yosemite Falls, and if you drive up to glacier point there is a fire road off to the right. If you park there and hike up that fire road you will come to Sentinel Dome! Very easy hike and a great view from the top. My parents got married on top of Sentinel Dome so if a whole wedding party can climb it you can.   Turtleback dome is also a great hike.  And if you park at the tunnel view and backtrack through the tunnel you can make a right into this cave that comes out at this sweet little viewpoint! Not many people know about that one.  Let me know if you have any other questions."

There are a few ""budget"" places to eat around Curry and the grocery store (cheaper to buy food beforehand). I wouldn't bring food into the tent, and make sure nothing is left in your car. Mosquitoes shouldn't be an issue yet but having a can of spray wouldn't hurt just in case. As far as hikes go everything is pretty easy to get to the base of (free shuttle) but anything beyond the valley floor you are pretty much going up some vertical. If it's sunny and warm do Vernal/Nevada falls if it's a bit cooler do Yosemite falls. Glacier point is also cool and is only a short drive from the valley. Have a good trip!"

Yosemite,3513re,r2davis2,2,Wed May 6 05:52:52 2015 UTC,YARTS would be your option but I believe they don't start running until June.  Hitchhiking is likely going to be your best bet.

Yosemite,34zep3,korravai,2,Wed May 6 00:45:15 2015 UTC,"Might make more sense to leave your car at the end point and try and hitch back to the valley for the start, that way you're not waiting around and getting desperate at the end of your long hike."
Yosemite,34zep3,IWantThatSign,1 point,Wed May 6 00:47:44 2015 UTC,Good point. At the end we are going to just want to hit the road.
Yosemite,34zep3,treysome,1 point,Wed May 6 00:51:01 2015 UTC,Do this. My strong suggestion is to have the ladies do the hitch hiking if there are any in your group.  My friends and I used this strategy to start and end in the exact areas you will be starting and ending.
Yosemite,34zep3,air4borne,2,Wed May 6 01:03:13 2015 UTC,I'm in the same boat. I have to leave my car at Little Yosemite Valley trailhead and find a ride to Sunrise Lakes. Looking like our best bet is is hitchhiking. I feel like it won't be an issue since most hikers are friendly people who like to help out. But I'll probably have my girlfriend hold the sign to increase the odds.
Yosemite,34zep3,yosemitesquint,1 point,Thu May 7 02:34:52 2015 UTC,"I am in the same boat... I'll need a ride back to the valley from Tuolumne Meadows on the 26th.

I'm still looking for other options but no shuttles are running this early in Yosemite."

Yosemite,34wl1r,chickenyoyo6,2,Tue May 5 03:49:15 2015 UTC,"I just climbed Cathedral on Saturday.  The last 15 foot crack that it mentions that is class 4 is pretty serious.  It feels like technical climbing and a fall without ropes would likely mean death (you would fall a lot farther than 15 feet).  We did the trad route up the south east buttress, but the last 15 feet to the summit the mountaineers route and the technical route meet up.  The climb up is easy, but without much experience and no climbing shoes on, I would hate to down climb from the summit block.  With that said, John Muir did it in 1869.  If that sounds out of your comfort zone, you could also just hike to the bottom of the summit block which would still give you awesome views.  Hope that helps."
Yosemite,34wl1r,reauxman,1 point,Tue May 5 19:52:22 2015 UTC,"I hiked up there last year. You can get within 100 ft of the summit with zero exposure and to about 25 ft of the summit with some exposed 4th class scrambling. Still a very cool view of Eichorn Pinnacle, Cathedral Lakes, and all the way back down to the Meadows behind you, even if you don't top out. Excellent hike in its own right along Budd Creek. The climber's trail up to the summit area is obvious once at the base of the climb. Another great hike I've done is take the climber's trail along Budd Creek to the base of the climb, circle cross country around the backside of Cathedral Peak down towards Upper Cathedral Lake, then meet up with the JMT and take it back down to the Meadows. It's about 6 miles round trip if I remember right."

Yosemite,34vnt7,jakdak,1 point,Wed May 6 20:26:51 2015 UTC,You can try checking for cancellations but you likely are going to have to drive in from a motel an hour or two away.  How many nights are you looking to stay and what are you looking to do? It is unlikely that 100% of the wilderness permits will be booked.
Yosemite,34vnt7,jakdak,1 point,Tue May 5 17:00:30 2015 UTC,"The problem is that most of the wilderness permits in YV are booked, and the ones that aren't would take a long time to get to YV from when you include hiking back to the car and then driving.   I think I found our solution though. We are probably just going to sleep in the car outside of the park the night before and get to camp 4 about 7 AM"
Yosemite,34vnt7,jakdak,1 point,Wed May 6 01:19:29 2015 UTC,IMHO you are better off getting a solid night sleep at home and just driving up in the morning- I used to day trip up to the mountains more or less every weekend when I lived in Silicon Valley and I ended up not resting well when stealth camping.  (The exception to this was when I wanted to be above 10k overnight to acclimate for whatever route I was doing the next day- but this doesn't appear to be a concern for you)
Yosemite,34txvw,drdrugdealer,4,Mon May 4 15:15:11 2015 UTC,"When you say you have ""sent messages"" to the park L&F, what do you mean? Did you call and speak to a person?   I would recommend calling the Park PIO office at (209)372-0200 (then dial 3 then 5) to see whether anyone in the L&F office can check the Lost Items reports. I would also call DNC (park concessioner) Lost and Found at (209)372-1390. These are much more likely to get you closer to returning the ring than filling out a form on the website.  For anyone in the future finding this post through a search: if you lose something precious in the park, stop by a Visitor Center before you leave and fill out a Lost and Found report! Also stop by the DNC office or call the number above to fill out a report with them. If you don't realize it's missing until you get home, call the park and fill out a form over the phone (don't send an email - talk to a person! they can ask questions to get the most useful identifying information from you right away. Emailing ""I lost a camera"" doesn't give them much to go on.).  Those forms hang out in the VC for a few days in case someone brings the item in, then they go to central L&F for indexing. The only way for us to know you've lost something and get it back to you is to fill out that form! I LOVED making that phone call when I was a VC volunteer, especially in one case where I had helped the (crying) visitor fill out the form for her lost engagement ring, then got to call her and tell her it came in about a week later."
Yosemite,34txvw,bfg_foo,3,Mon May 4 15:48:05 2015 UTC,"The visitor center receives most items, but something of that nature would be handled by the protection division.

Yosemite,34s6n6,racismisgay,3,Mon May 4 02:39:17 2015 UTC,Take a look at the links in the stickied post- most of your questions should be answered there.  Late July/Early August is the middle of peak season- your options likely may already be limited by what reservations are still available.  Hard to give hike recommendations without more details as to what your experience/fitness level is.  The links in the sticky post have descriptions of the more popular routes.
Yosemite,34s6n6,jakdak,3,Mon May 4 03:10:32 2015 UTC,"1) There are a variety of options in and around the park, but it depends on your definition of ""economical."" Housekeeping Camp and Curry Village are the cheapest options in the park, but will run you $135+ not including tax.  2) That is the busiest/craziest time to visit the park. Expect crowds, long delays at the gates, and lots of traffic in the Village and parking areas. Seasonal waterfalls will be dry. The weather at lower elevations will be hot (the Valley, and even more so in El Portal which will be 100F+ during the day). Higher elevations will be cooler, but still get warm during the day. Mosquitoes are usually pretty brutal at the higher elevations at that time, but one of the few good side effects (from the human perspective, at least) of the drought is that the mosquitoes probably will be clearing out by then.  If the option is that time or not at all, definitely go - any Yosemite is better than no Yosemite :) However, if you could delay your trip until Sept or Oct, you would probably find the park a much more enjoyable place (and cheaper).  3) It's hard to recommend hikes without knowing your interests and skill levels."
Yosemite,34s6n6,bfg_foo,1 point,Mon May 4 03:28:01 2015 UTC,"I believe there are plenty of rental companies that will rent you tents, backpacks, etc. if you're interested in doing those activities."
Yosemite,34s6n6,RealRocketScientist,1 point,Wed May 6 12:16:04 2015 UTC,1) Yosemite View Lodge outside of the park (like a mile or two). Trust me I learned the hardway. I stayed 30 miles out and it took 45-hour every day to get in and out. I would have paid the extra $100 to stay there.

Yosemite,34oble,curly1022,2,Sun May 3 00:37:29 2015 UTC,"Death Valley? It'll be hella hot at lower elevations, but some of the higher elevation campgrounds should be OK.   Other options would be to find a cheap hotel room in Vegas, or to go through DV and camp somewhere along the East Side of the Sierra (along 395). There are several campgrounds in the Inyo that might do."
Yosemite,34oble,bfg_foo,3,Sun May 3 03:46:05 2015 UTC,"I've found it to be uncomfortable to try and sleep at sea level DV in the summer- its still often pushing 100 overnight.  Montgomery Flat in DV is at 8k and usually a better bet in the summer.  (There's also a campground on the road leading up to Montgomery- forget its name)  The various Inyo campgrounds on 395 are also an option, as are the ones in the White Mountain access road.  Or hotels in the middle of nowhere NV desert towns (Tonopah, Beatty, etc) are usually pretty cheap."
Yosemite,34oble,jakdak,1 point,Sun May 3 04:25:31 2015 UTC,"I'll look into those, thank you! We've got a hotel in Vegas for a few nights after Zion, but that is another option too."
Yosemite,34oble,nattfodd,2,Sun May 3 03:49:23 2015 UTC,"You can camp at the Red Rock BLM campsite, with the added advantage of great climbing/sightseeing next door, and the Strip 20 minutes away."
Yosemite,34oble,dpeterso,2,Sun May 3 09:34:25 2015 UTC,"I suggest camping near white mountain peak. It's a good day's drive from Zion, but it puts you close to Yosemite or vice versa depending on how you do your trip. You could also camp near Mono Lake or Bishop.   The reason I suggest this area is because you can easily snag a 14K peak (its a half-day hike), and you are close to the Oldest trees in the world- the Bristlecone pines. It's also super remote which means that you will have no problems with reservations. When you cross through Nevada, you also parallel an edge of Area 51.  The issue with all the other sites (Red Rock, Valley of Fire, and Death Valley) is that during the summer these places will be unbearably hot. Near White Mountain you will be downright chilly/cold- depending on where you are its 7-10K feet.   Also, bring water. Many of these places I think are primitive campgrounds."
Yosemite,34oble,autowikibot,1 point,Sun May 3 19:10:15 2015 UTC,"Bristlecone pine:       A bristlecone pine can refer to one of three species of pine trees (family Pinaceae, genus Pinus, subsection Balfourianae).

Yes, it's crowded, but it's crowded for a reason. There's a number of short hikes you can take to the various waterfalls, and you'll have time to drive or take the shuttle up to Glacier Point as well.

This is no surprise, because of the drought, but it's not as low as I had feared.  Four years ago, I did this hike in late June, and there were several spots on the trail where I had to scramble along rocks to get around the submerged trail. At the top, above Glen Aulin, we had to walk through 2 feet of water and marsh for about a mile before we exited into Tuolomne Meadows.

Yosemite,34cp7p,jakdak,2,Thu Apr 30 02:34:08 2015 UTC,"Cool! Thanks. As far as a rating, what would you give it? Hard, medium or easy. Also, what would you say is the distance?"
Yosemite,34cp7p,jakdak,1 point,Thu Apr 30 02:58:11 2015 UTC,"Sierra Point on the shoulder of Grizzly Peak is the one point in the Valley where you can see 4 of the main waterfalls from a single spot. The trail to it was closed in the 70s due to safety concerns but portions of it are still in surprisingly good shape.  It can be reached via a talus scramble from the ""Rock Piles"" sign a short distance up the JMT from happy isles (you can pick up the trail after about 100 yards of scrambling)  Its less than 2 miles round trip, quite steep, and has one semi-exposed section.  Here's some pics from my last trip there: http://www.fedak.net/albums/SierraPoint3.html   Edit: Here's a trail map from the early 40's that has it shown (along with the Ledge Trail and OBOFR and other routes that no longer exist in their original form) http://www.yosemite.ca.us/library/maps/yosemite_valley_map_1941.png"

Yosemite,348kg4,skrill,2,Wed Apr 29 03:43:11 2015 UTC,Interesting app- I've been looking (and never really found) a decent backcountry routing app.  I tried entering a couple off trail landmarks and didn't have a ton of success (and got it to crash fairly easily)  Would be most interested in this if it could plot the optimal/minimal distance/gain route (or at least show the options) for approach hikes for an arbitrary point on the Topo map.
Yosemite,348kg4,jakdak,2,Wed Apr 29 05:07:08 2015 UTC,I also use Caltopo but can't wait to try this one out.

Yosemite,348ci5,skrill,1 point,Wed Apr 29 03:49:50 2015 UTC,Sounds like a good plan. Make sure tioga road is open when you are there. Last I saw it was still closed. If it is closed the upper Yosemite falls trail could be a good replacement and eagles peak is one of my favorite little known views. Just spectacular.   Also for half done hiking you can still apply for a pass one or two days ahead of time if you are interested. Just google half done permits (sorry on mobile now or I would link) and it should take you to a page that explains the daily lottery that happens. That is how I hiked it with a friend last time I was there.   Have a blast it really is an incredible place and it sounds like you have great plans.
Yosemite,348ci5,chetbodet87,1 point,Wed Apr 29 04:38:33 2015 UTC,Make sure tioga road is open when you are there.   It will almost definitely be open by May 21st this year.  If it wasn't for last weekend's storm it probably would have opened in the next week.

Yosemite,346zo1,jakdak,5,Tue Apr 28 20:16:09 2015 UTC,"Well, crap. I'll be camping in Lower Pines on May 8-10, and now that Half Dome is an option (and since they're all daily permits, probably a decent chance of getting one) I'm going to be spending the next week and a half deciding if I want to attempt it.  I was hoping for an easier decision for my Saturday hike."
Yosemite,346zo1,robbbbb,3,Tue Apr 28 23:05:57 2015 UTC,If you've never done it before its definitely worth the attempt- especially since it will be far less crowded before Memorial Day.
Yosemite,346zo1,robbbbb,3,Tue Apr 28 23:08:15 2015 UTC,"I'm mostly worried about being able to. My most recent ""tough"" hike was to the top of Mt. Baldy in SoCal, but the cables seem like they're a whole different beast.   That said, I'm sure there will be plenty of people doing it that are less in-shape than me. I think I just worry too much."
Yosemite,346zo1,robbbbb,3,Tue Apr 28 23:19:04 2015 UTC,If you did Baldy you should be able to handle Half Dome.  Baldy is 1000ft higher than Half Dome and the elevation gains are similar (depending on what Baldy route you took)  The cable portion isn't that long and isn't as difficult as it appears from below.

Edit: thinking about it, the only other way to possibly get some extra help is to have your friend talk to the dept. manager of the job you applied for (or the one you desire most). Then, have your friend give the dept. manager your personal info, resume, etc. It's nepotism in its purest form but that's how it works."

(And what do you consider a ""difficult hike"")?  My favorite route at that time of year would be the Grand Canyon of the Tuolumne to Waterwheel Falls.   Though Clouds Rest is also a good option."
Yosemite,343go2,jakdak,2,Tue Apr 28 01:44:21 2015 UTC,"I did Clouds Rest solo (and I don't do a lot of solo hiking) and loved it. Its just busy enough that you won't feel scarily isolated, but its pleasantly quiet. I highly recommend it.  I also really loved My Hoffman, which was also solo. They're probably equally challenging, but for my lastes, I preferred My Hoffman. (You get May Lake as a bonus along the way)  Edit: Personally, Yosemite Falls is probably the only hike I haven't enjoyed. Its a bit of a death march up switch backs and the views somehow disappoint. Its not one I'd recommend as a first/only hike.  Glacier Point is always always worth a visit. If you've had a long day of hiking and want an easy place to catch an amazing subset, look no further. It's not a hike, its just a short walk from the parking lot to amazing views."
Yosemite,343go2,YosemiteFan,1 point,Tue Apr 28 01:54:13 2015 UTC,"Hoffman (especially early season) at least has the routefinding issues above May Lake and isn't really a sanctioned trail.  Clouds Rest is a signed and fully maintained official park trail.  Should be no issues other than having to take your shoes off for the creek crossing and getting eaten alive by skeeters.   Edit: Personally, Yosemite Falls is probably the only hike I haven't enjoyed.   And my disdain for this highly overrated slog is well known :)"
Yosemite,343go2,jakdak,2,Tue Apr 28 01:57:35 2015 UTC,"You are correct (though the NPS now keeps the Mt Hoffman trail in their GIS trail data set, which they didn't before). I did find the cairns easy to miss. That said, I found the way easily enough. I figured this year Hoffman might be clear pretty early too, given the sad lack of snow.  I'm glad to know others think Upper Yosemite Falls is overrated too."
Yosemite,343go2,YosemiteFan,1 point,Tue Apr 28 02:46:25 2015 UTC,"The Yosemite Falls trail is the worst - I'm only willing to go down it, which still sucks, because it's so slippery with loose gravel and steep.

Yosemite,343go2,staminatea,2,Tue Apr 28 14:54:42 2015 UTC,"My favorite personal anecdote about Upper Yosemite Falls is that my wife and I took the shuttle to the trailhead, and the drivers announce the stops and give a brief description of what's there.  So, the driver mentions it's the trailhead for the Upper Yosemite Falls trail which is ""a 6 to 8 hours strenuous hike"", to which we hear some grumpy kid say something like ""who the hell does a 6 to 8 hour strenuous hike??"" as we step off the bus.  6 to 8 hours later we had to admit he had a point.  His cynicism was well-founded."

Buddy of mine was heading up to Tuolumne so I hitched a ride with him and he dropped me off at Porcupine Flat and I headed down past Yosemite Falls to get down to the valley.  It was October of a dry year so the Falls had been completely dry for 3-4 months at that point.   I passed person after person on the way down- almost all of whom kept asked me where the waterfall was :)   Kept having to say ""It's right there"" but it hasn't had water in months."

If you purchase the 7 day park pass it begins at the time of the purchase and is valid for the next 7 days.  You can leave and re-enter as much as you want in the time period.

Yosemite,33zfcd,tronn4,4,Mon Apr 27 04:37:51 2015 UTC,"The best beginner cross country ski route in Yosemite is glacier point road from Badger Pass.  You can rent equipment right at the trailhead, the road is groomed, and there are no navigation issues.  (And if you want to pay up, you can even stay at the ski hut and not bring packs)  Beyond that you'll probably want to stick to tree tagged routes (The Ostrander Ski hut and the Lake Vernon snow course are two that come to mind offhand)  Keep in mind that winter travel is a whole different ballgame than hiking. But it has its rewards: http://i.imgur.com/1zG3YJw.jpg  Rather than Yosemite, you might also want to look into the Tahoe area sno-parks as a launch point.   Those will allow you to hit the snow right from the trailhead.  Winnemucca Lake from Carson Pass is a good starter."
Yosemite,33zfcd,jakdak,1 point,Mon Apr 27 06:03:53 2015 UTC,"I agree with you, it sounds like it would be extra magical covered in snow. Here's a start: http://www.nps.gov/yose/planyourvisit/wildwinter.htm"
Yosemite,33sci1,TurbinadoBaby,10,Sat Apr 25 03:47:18 2015 UTC,"The route you are looking at doing is entirely backcountry so there are no spots to head off trail to grab a quick bite to eat or resupply yourselves. You will need a bear canister to store your food safely away from bears and will most likely need all the food for the entire trip packed in your backpack from the start. Only Glacier Point has a store but it's mostly just snacks.  As far as the route goes that is almost entirely above 6,000ft and there will be a lot of elevation change along the way. You can hike down from Tenaya Lake to the valley, which will be easier physically but makes transportation between start and finish difficult, or you can do it as a loop. It just depends on the permits you obtain. If you are looking to do Half Dome that also needs a permit which you can usually get with your wilderness permit as long as you are hiking in that area.  You will need a wilderness permit for any overnight camping you will be doing in the backcountry. The idea is that each trailhaed has a quota for the day and some are more popular than others. The map you linked shows you want to start at the Sunrise Lakes trailhead...that is quite popular. This report shows all the trailheads that have a full quota for dates this year and Sunrise Lakes is full all of June, July, August and a lot of September. No worries as this is just for ADVANCED reservations. If you still want to start there you can arrive at a ranger station day of and try your luck with day of permits which they reserve a few. Get there 30 minutes before opening (usually 8-8:30am) or 11am for next day permits. You will be required once again to have a bear canister as bears are active in the area.  Just my advice on backpacking. I know you said you've never backpacked before...this isn't just walk into the forest and setup camp. You will need to be prepared to have everything with you on your back. Bear canister, food, water filter (Yest you need to filter the water and while there are a few spots to get clean water on trail you can't rely on those), tent, sleeping bag, sleeping pad, stove, toiletries, first aid, flashlight / head lamp, map and compass for starters. There is a lot of info out there on how to backpack but it honestly is all up to you what works best. It took my first 2 trips to realize I was doing everything wrong and carrying way too much.  And lastly I would actually recommend a different route entirely. On that map you linked I would start either at (22) Glen Aulin or (20) Murphy Creek. Preferably Glen Aulin passthrough but Murphy Creek is really nice and had lots of reservations still available. You could hike in and setup camp for the entire trip in one spot (I suggest just after California falls, to the right of the trail by Wildcat Point is an amazing camp...perfect calm pool to swim in at the base of the falls). This allows to you day hike the area...make sure to hike down to Waterwheel falls! You'll be by the Glen Aulin high sierra camp (a seasonal canvas tent camp) where they will have bathrooms, clean water, and they cook there though I think that's for paying guests of the camp...you may want to research that. Though I would not rely on their resources. Still plan on filtering your own water...get a $20 sawyer mini filter it's all you need. Anyways, this whole area is full of amazing waterfalls and you will not be disappointed with you daily hikes.  I know, lots of info! Let me know if you need to pick my brain. Oh and there most definitely won't be cell phone service in most of Yosemite. I only get service in the valley. Here's a link to a few pics from Glen Aulin last year."
Yosemite,33sci1,idontknowtom,3,Sat Apr 25 07:44:42 2015 UTC,"Holy shit. Thank you SO much for your time and opinion! Those pictures are absolutely beautiful. You make great points about what trail to take. Thanks for the link to that page about the reservations- super helpful. I was pretty dead set on Sunset because I thought it had all the points worth seeing.   I now understand the magnitude of the path I had planned and the fact that it's mostly backcountry and that there's no convenience store along the way. Haha. Although, we were planning on staying in the valleys and not doing any climbs up to Cloud Rest or Half Dome just to keep things more simple...  I was mainly concerned about altitude sickness, but I guess there's no way of getting around it?"
Yosemite,33sci1,idontknowtom,3,Sat Apr 25 08:08:22 2015 UTC,"If that was your plan just to stay simple and swim and do small day hikes then I wouldn't really recommend Little Yosemite valley and the Clouds Rest / Half Dome area. Half Dome is great but its a big hike and often is crowded. Maybe take a day to explore Yosemite valley...hike Vernal Falls, see all the sights, drive up to Glacier Point and you'll get a similar feeling/view as standing on top of Half Dome with less work.  Then you can get away from the crowds and enjoy nature like it seems you want to do up in Tuolumne meadows and in the backcountry at Glen Aulin. Lot's of waterfalls and swimming to be had.  I don't think you will have issues with altitude sickness but you never know. Tuolumne, while not as popular as the valley, is still very touristy and sits just below 9,000ft. Glen Aulin is downhill from there, with the lowest point being Waterwheel falls at 7,000ft. At that point you'll have been at elevation long enough to be use to it. Best way to deal with it is to stay hydrated and not exert yourself if you feel any issues.  Also I didn't note but if you do get permits in advance online, which is smart to reserve your spot and guarantee you'll have a place to stay, you're permit comes with the option to stay at a backpacking campground before and after you start your trip. Actually all permits come with this option. What that means is you can relax at a tent-only backpackers camp near civilization the day before you start your trip. It's $6 a night and is only for people with permits. I think you have to use the one in Tuolumne but it at least gives you the option to explore the valley the first day and then drive up and relax at camp before starting your trip."
Yosemite,33sci1,IndigoFerrari,3,Sat Apr 25 08:33:51 2015 UTC,"Probably not going to be able to answer all of your questions but I'll do what I can.  You would need a permit to legally do what you plan to do.  These are of limited supply and are usually reserved in advance.  What you're proposing seems kind of intense for a first time deal.  There aren't any places to buy food between Tenaya Lake and Glacier Point.  Glacier Point has a gift shop.  I can't remember what they have in the way of food.  They have some.  But that would be your proposed halfway point.  You'd have to filter water as you go.  Are you opposed to camping in one place and doing day hikes?  That would be a lot easier logistically.    For example, if you can get a site at Yosemite Creek or basically anywhere on Tioga Road.  http://www.nps.gov/yose/planyourvisit/upload/tioga.pdf  There are a lot of good hikes to do of various distance.  The Yosemite Creek Campground to the top of Yosemite Falls is 6 miles each way, if that's doable the scenery on the way is decent, but the big payoff is once you get to the valley edge.  Just remembered your elevation limit.  Most of Tioga Road is well above 6000.  You could try and get a walk in site in the valley itself and there is plenty to do there, if you don't mind the crowds.  Might even be better for a first timer.    I can't help you much regarding cell service."
Yosemite,33sci1,IndigoFerrari,1 point,Sat Apr 25 06:56:20 2015 UTC,"Well, we kind of wanted to go all out without hurting ourselves. I guess I should have mentioned that we don't plan to go up Half Dome or Cloud Rest, we want to stay low for the most part. That's why I didn't think it would be too difficult a trek. But thank you for the suggestions. I'll think about day hikes as an alternative.   As far as food goes, I guess we would have to pack enough for the 5 days then. And as for water, filtering it? Like, just get some from any (obviously not stagnant) body of water there and filter it with a water bottle that has a built-in filter? What do you suggest for that?  I was actually just looking at google maps with terrain view and saw that Tenaya Lake itself is at 8,200' and the valley is 5,500' at its lowest point. I'm just worried about acclimating to the altitude change... I've lived at 500' my entire life and I think it'll be rough esp while hiking. I plan to drive there and stay a night in the area before starting, maybe that'll be enough time to adjust?"
Yosemite,33sci1,idontknowtom,3,Sat Apr 25 07:28:15 2015 UTC,"Yosemite Valley itself is about 4000 feet.  The elevation affects aren't as bad as you might think. You're planning to keep it leisurely anyway.   Yeah, a filter.  Do you have REI in your area? 99% of the time the river water is safe to drink, but that 1% of the time isn't worth the risk."
Yosemite,33sci1,idontknowtom,1 point,Sat Apr 25 07:53:21 2015 UTC,"Yes! Thanks, I'll look into the filter situation. What's been your favorite trail/route?"
Yosemite,33sci1,jakdak,3,Sat Apr 25 08:13:11 2015 UTC,Just to piggy back on this. The Tenaya Lake to Little Yosemite valley trail options are still not a walk in the park even without Clouds Rest and Half Dome. You climb up above Tenaya Lake to drop down into LYV. Not much to see along the way and honestly not much to see once you get there. And climbing back out is quite a climb. On top of it the entire area was in a huge fire last year.  Just things to consider.
Yosemite,33sci1,ivegotopinions,1 point,Sat Apr 25 08:41:40 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the info. I thought it was the most popular trail because of how scenic it is. Or maybe it's just because everyone wants to tackle Half Dome.   I didn't think it was going to be a walk in the park at all. Considering we would have 6 days, about 30 miles round trip didn't sound too bad."
Yosemite,33sci1,harpervalleypta,3,Sat Apr 25 15:55:19 2015 UTC,If you want to do that area still and have it be more scenic I'd start in Tuolumne and hike to Vogelsang high Sierra camp and down the Merced river. If you can figure out transportation back I'd just hike down to the valley. There are shuttle services between the valley and Tuolumne but they end in September.
Yosemite,33sci1,harpervalleypta,3,Sat Apr 25 17:57:59 2015 UTC,"The lower portion (the trailhead to Nevada Falls) is the scenic part.  Its popular because it is en route to Half Dome, it is part of the JMT, and it is the primary access point from Yosemite Valley to the high country.  Once you leave the banks of of the Merced, that corridor is mostly nondescript forest with no particular views."
Yosemite,33sci1,ivegotopinions,1 point,Sun Apr 26 00:46:58 2015 UTC,Gotcha.
Yosemite,33sci1,GoNorthYoungMan,2,Sun Apr 26 19:43:30 2015 UTC,"We did day hikes to Glacier Point from the valley and back, walked around the valley, hiked to lower yosemite falls, bridalveil falls, mirror lake, vernal and nevada falls and back in 3 days, and our GPS tracked us about 40 miles so it all can add up. From what you're looking for I do think it would be good to get out of the valley some as it can become pretty crowded, still there are lots of incredible things to see there too."
Yosemite,33sci1,GoNorthYoungMan,3,Mon Apr 27 17:41:19 2015 UTC,"Everybody reacts differently, but for what it's worth...I live in Dallas and hike above 13,000' in Colorado a few times a year.  I definitely notice the altitude above 10,000 but have never had a real issue. If you are reasonably fit, the altitude probably won't cause you too many problems.  You will get winded easily and may have a minor headache for the first day or two, but the altitudes are not high enough to have serious issues in my experience.  That being said, it's still going to be a strenuous hike!  Sounds awesome."
Yosemite,33pwyt,harpervalleypta,3,Fri Apr 24 15:17:35 2015 UTC,"Yes. The OBOFRT is one of my favorites. You can go up the rockslides, over el cap, and down the Yosemite Falls trail. I think it was about fifteen miles, I've only done it as a dayhike. I've only seen two or three people until the Falls trail.   The rockslides can be tricky to navigate, so do your research beforehand and expect that part to be slow going. Above that, though, the trail is in great condition."
Yosemite,33pwyt,staminatea,2,Fri Apr 24 16:06:00 2015 UTC,"I'm going up rockslides and then down the snow creek trail back to the valley.  It's going to be 32 miles or so over 4 nights, so it should be quite enjoyable.  It's going to be the first week of October, so hopefully it won't be too chilly.  The rockslides is the only part I'm slightly concerned about, so I'm trying to do as much research as possible.  Thanks for your notes!"
Yosemite,33pwyt,staminatea,1 point,Fri Apr 24 16:47:52 2015 UTC,"Have fun! The rockslides are one of my favorite areas - look closely towards the top (get to Rainbow View point, a viewing rail and USGS marker are still there) and you'll realize you're right across from the Tunnel View parking lot. TONS of people there, and you're all by yourself on the opposite side. It's amazing."
Yosemite,33pwyt,BattleMonkey123,2,Sun Apr 26 15:54:06 2015 UTC,"I have.  Inspired by that same Backpacker article.  Started as advertised, and exited (as planned) via Olmsted point.  This hike was one of my favorites.  Breakfast on El Cap was memorable.  Make sure you detour to the top of Eagle Peak...amazing views, looking down to Half Dome.  Rockslides are difficult to navigate.  If you have a GPS, use it.  We navigated (with some difficulty) without one, but had to backtrack quite a bit.  We thought there would be cairns, but they were non existent after a short bit.   I'm jealous.  Have fun!  Edit: Use the GPS in conjunction with waypoints from a prior hiker.  It might seem odd now sitting behind a computer, but once you're on the rockslides, you can see where you need to go (generally ""up"" and ""West"") but it is harder than it sounds.   Here is a website with the waypoints (along with more trail reviews): http://www.trimbleoutdoors.com/ViewTrip/368705  Here is the comment I left:  August 2010 Trip A friend and I did this route in August 2010, modified with an exit at Olmsted Point rather than a return to the valley floor. The start of the trail (at marker V9) was being cleared out by heavy construction equipment when we started. You literally step off the Yosemite Valley road onto a dirt/duff forest road, follow it, and you hit the OBOFRT asphalt less than five minutes later. No more deadfall! We lost the trail once at the rockslides, had to do some scrambling, but nothing five minutes of backtracking would not have cured (we did it the hard way and went up, up, up!). Highly recommended route. Added by TrailMonkey  And this: http://www.norcalhiker.com/yosemites-north-rim/  Please let us know how you enjoyed it!"
Yosemite,33pwyt,BattleMonkey123,1 point,Fri Apr 24 18:47:23 2015 UTC,"Awesome!  Thanks for the beta.  Yeah, the way finding on the rockslides is my only real concern right now, besides an early winter storm.  I'll plug the route into a gps to make sure we stay on track.  Speaking of gps...I'm reading that the Gaia maps app works pretty brilliantly.  What gps did you use?"
Yosemite,33pwyt,BattleMonkey123,3,Fri Apr 24 19:28:17 2015 UTC,"We did not use a GPS.  I own one (an old Garmin eTrex), and use it when my hikes are off trail.  I stick with a map and compass (mainly for resecting to determine my position) when I am on an established trail.  Saves weight and concerns about batteries.  Once you are past the rockslides, the trail is awesome."
Yosemite,33pwyt,staminatea,1 point,Fri Apr 24 19:56:54 2015 UTC,Sounds cool.  I'm a little discouraged after reading some of the more recent trip reports.  There are a couple of reports that indicate that the rockslides have gotten worse and that there are 1-2 miles traversing on loose talus rather than the intermittent crossings mentioned in the article.  I'm not that worried about it myself...but I know my girlfriend won't be thrilled about unsteady footing for that long of a stretch.  Do you think starting at the OBOFRT trailhead instead of rockslides would totally sabotage this loop?
Yosemite,33kw06,frisbeeguru,7,Thu Apr 23 10:20:31 2015 UTC,"Drive in on the 41. Take a right after the south entrance and go see the Mariposa Grove of giant trees, they are mindblowing! Take Wawona Road to Glacier Point Road. Drive to the end of the road and check out Glacier Point. Go back to Wawona Road and take a right. Go through the tunnel, stop and check out Tunnel View. From there go down to the valley. Park anywhere you'd like and take pictures. I'd recommend taking the half mile walk to lower Yosemite Falls."

The former might not be worth the hassle of renting gear if you have no prior experience, and I'm not sure campground/cabin camping for a night will significantly add to your experience.  As for hikes, the seasonal waterfalls (esp Yosemite Falls) will  be dry by September.   The Nevada Falls/Mist loop mentioned in the otter comment will still be worth doing but beyond that you'll likely want to get out of the valley and head up to the high country."

Yosemite,3377dz,honesauce,2,Mon Apr 20 04:24:19 2015 UTC,"I've never camped there, but campsites do get booked early—it's like trying to get a reservation at the French Laundry; you have to know you're going months in advance. There are probably going to be cancellations, but you'd have to cross your fingers.  Don't let me discourage you, though. There are also hotels. You're most likely going to want to stay in Yosemite Valley (that's the part with Half Dome and Yosemite Falls and El Capitan), and there are three kinds of non-camp options: the Ahwahnee Lodge ($$$$, plush), the Yosemite Lodge ($$, mid-70s style), and Camp Curry ($, tent cabins).  I've stayed in Camp Curry and in the Yosemite Lodge. Both are enough if you just want a foothold in Yosemite Valley and are not especially concerned about noise or elegance. If you happen to be like me (somewhat older, with a nine-year-old son) you probably won't like either of those that much, because the noise on a holiday weekend will be annoying at the least and probably downright obnoxious.  Camp Curry (and its cousin Housekeeping Camp) are not expensive, are similar to camping (except you're in a canvas tent on a platform, heating available in some units, and there are communal showers available), and sometimes there are openings even at the last minute. It's worth a try if you can't get a campsite.  Trails: it's hard to find a bad trail in Yosemite. The place is magical. There's a lot to pick from, starting with easy but scenic hikes (like to Mirror Lake—this is popular and crowded but still nice). A hike I've done that I really liked is the one up to Vernal Falls.   Do not attempt the really strenuous hikes like the one up to Half Dome without research and preparation. You'll hear reports every year of unprepared people getting stuck up on the trail at nightfall. It gets cold at night.  One more warning: this is a popular national park. A lot of the visitors are from other countries, but on a holiday weekend, you're going to get a lot of RVs and buses, and the park will fill up with American tourists. There's nothing wrong with that as long as it doesn't bother you, but be aware of what you're getting into. (OTOH there is rarely a time when Yosemite Valley isn't at least somewhat crowded, and yet the valley's peaceful scenery can seem to make it all vanish. Also, you can always find a nice, off-the-beaten-path trail to escape on.)  Edit: one other hotel option is to try to book a room outside the park. It's about a ~20-minute drive from the gate to the valley floor, but it's nice and scenic, and I never mind doing it. Those hotels outside the park probably also book up early, but they're worth a look. Also, on a holiday weekend, there's going to be traffic heading into the park, so you'd want to wake up early and get there as soon as the gate opens so that you don't end up in some crazy hour-long-line just to get in."

Yosemite,3377dz,nscherneck,1 point,Mon Apr 20 18:17:05 2015 UTC,Camp 4 would be your best option for walk in.  Get in line well before the kiosk opens at 8am.  Ideally bring a sleeping pad and your bag and get there at 5am and go back to sleep while you wait.  There will be a line.

The mattresses are thin vinyl-covered spring mattresses and the beds do not come with any bedding unless you request and rent a bed roll for $2.50/night (sheets, pillow, wool blanket).  With the bed roll + duvet, you will probably be in good shape, but it never hurts to bring an extra blanket or two."

If you're in the valley or Wawona, you'll have a mostly warm to hot summer with afternoon thunderstorms in July and August. You'll be issued uniforms for work. If you forget anything, you can get Amazon deliveries or head out to town to get what you need. Also, prepare for cell coverage to suck and internet access to be unreliable.  Be friendly, have fun, but watch out for having too much fun because the rangers crack down on pot smoking and public intoxication. In any case, you'll have a memorable summer!"
Yosemite,334q5k,staminatea,2,Sun Apr 19 15:26:28 2015 UTC,"Coming from Mississippi I would say he probably would not consider the summer to be hot,and actually may be cool at night in the valley."
Yosemite,334q5k,intlwaters,2,Sun Apr 19 19:56:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm excited to get out of this humidity. I've heard it's a different heat but I've never experienced it."
Yosemite,334q5k,staminatea,1 point,Sun Apr 19 20:00:03 2015 UTC,Goooood point. The air will be very dry compared to Mississippi...
Yosemite,334q5k,yosemitetrailblazer,3,Mon Apr 20 00:08:32 2015 UTC,"Most employees start for the summer and stay for the winter, so here's advice for the year for clothes. The weather in Yosemite is great;it has 4 seasons and none of them involve humidity. Well, some days in the summer after a rain are humid by California's standards but you will laugh at it. Bring clothes that are comfortable for the hottest days (99-103) and for the coldest nights/days (25-50). Those are the extremes but we mostly enjoy a happy medium ranging around 67-90. If you want to get good hiking clothes invest in clothes that are not cotton based. It doesn't rain much but just bring a rain coat and some all-weather shoes to be prepared."
Yosemite,334q5k,bfg_foo,3,Sun Apr 19 16:04:35 2015 UTC,"Yo, I'm from Alabama and have spent a couple of seasons in Yosemite, including a summer season. Others have covered the basics, so I'll mainly focus on the weather differences.  There is no way to prepare for how dry it is in the high Sierra compared to the Deep South. I did a pretty good job staying hydrated and my feet still dried out and cracked to the point of bleeding painfully. Look up the sorts of lotions/salves that Norwegian sailors or whatever use and bring a tub of it.  There will be pollens and leaf molds that your body has never encountered before. Bring a variety of different kinds of allergy medicine, sinus medicine, painkillers, etc. Sams Club sells generic Benadryl for like $6 for two bottles of 300 pills. They will also help you sleep at night since you'll be sharing housing and, if (likely) you're in a tent cabin, will also help you sleep through surrounding noise. (It's the same ingredient that Tylenol/Advil/Aleve PM have for sleeping.)  Altitude sickness is a thing. You're unlikely to have any problems in the Valley since it's only 4000 ft, but when you go up to Tuolumne, Glacier Point, etc. it may hit you. Sometimes I got it and sometimes I didn't, which was obnoxious because I would think I finally had it beaten, then the next time I went up to the high country I'd feel woozy on a hike again. Chugging Vitamin Water was my cure; others will have different recommendations. Just be prepared to listen to your body.  It can still be quite chilly at night. My summer season (2012) it snowed on Memorial Day weekend. If you're going to be spending any time in the high country, it will be cold at night. Don't let the native Californians get you down -- your body isn't used to their weather, so bundle up and think about how much they'll be bitching when it gets into the 80s and 90s in the Valley.  Not weather-related, but: buy a little raft (I like the Intex Explorer 200) on Amazon or something and have it shipped there. There is absolutely nothing like floating down the Merced on a nice afternoon. I think DNC employees get half off raft rentals, but the Intex costs like $20 and will last you all season."
Yosemite,334q5k,nhomewarrior,2,Sun Apr 19 19:19:33 2015 UTC,"REI! They have a great selection of recreational gear (kinda similar to Bass Pro Shops except for general outdoors equipment). You'll want your own backpack and sleeping bag/mat for sure, and a few articles of synthetic clothing. Other than that I don't think you'll need a whole lot. REI sells all of that online, so just look through their catalog to get an idea of what you'll want to have with you."

Yosemite,336kiw,L2D2,1 point,Mon Apr 20 20:41:33 2015 UTC,"I just checked; it seems like you'll get some rain but I really doubt you'll get snow. You may get a little snow in on the way out (the valley / Housekeeping Camp) is at about 4,000 feet and if you are driving out 120, the highest point is a bit above 6,000 but I doubt anything will even close.  Bring rain gear and extra layers for nights (they could get cold). Also, ask the front desk if there are any road closures just in case before you leave."

Yosemite,32qysz,YouGoGlenCocoaBean,5,Thu Apr 16 00:26:50 2015 UTC,"The Nevada Fall loop (Up the Mist Trail, Down the JMT) would be my recommendation.  Don't expect a lot of solitude.  Your other main alternatives would be Yosemite Falls from the Valley, Illouette from Glacier Point, or Wapama/Rancheria from Hetch Hetchy.  If you want solitude (and don't mind the switchback slog at the start) I might recommend the lesser known falls on Porcupine Creek near the Porcupine/Snow Creek junction."
Yosemite,32qysz,jakdak,3,Thu Apr 16 00:38:13 2015 UTC,"Agreed on the mist trail / jmt loop recommendation. Busy, but outstanding.   Will have to check out porcupine creek falls some time.

Both are less than an hour to visit.    For the hike, I'd go with the Mist Trail up to Nevada Falls and back.  I think it was about a 6 or 7 mile hike, but I can't be sure.  It was about twice what the trail guides say and not easy.  Take the shuttle to the start to save a little walking from the nearest parking lot."

Yosemite,32r7mv,gudecheese,2,Thu Apr 16 01:40:46 2015 UTC,"I agree with jakdak about taking the east side approach into yosemite. Take 190 through Death Valley*, maybe even side trip up to Telescope Peak (beautiful hike at elevation from which you can see the highest and lowest points in the CONUS). Then follow 395 up the east side of the Sierra. Take the time you would have spend heading around the west side and in Sequoia exploring the 395 corridor. Head up to any of the trailheads for a gorgeous hike (Horseshoe Meadows to Cottonwood Lakes, Onion Valley to Kearsarge Pass, South Lake to Bishop Lakes, North Lake to Piute Pass, Rock Creek to Little Lakes Valley, etc etc etc - can't go wrong). This gets you some of the high country scenery common in Sequoia and Kings Canyon that is hard to get to from the west side. If you want to see sequoias, use one of your days in yosemite to visit a grove there.   Then turn west into Yosemite where highway 120 meets 395 in Lee Vining.   *all warnings apply about driving through DV in June - refer to DV website to see travel recommendations"
Yosemite,32r7mv,GlorbAndAGloob,1 point,Thu Apr 16 14:04:00 2015 UTC,"Thoughts from looking at your itinerary:  1) You will be best off getting outfitted for the Narrows hike if you are through hiking it.  Along with the walking sticks you really will want the specialized thermal wetsuits and the shuttle provided by the outfitters.   (And take the early shuttle rather than the latter as the first day can be very long depending on what campsite you are allocated)  Do you have Narrows permits yet?  Those are reasonably hard to get.     2) I'd honestly skip Sequoia if you are swinging around the southern Sierra just to visit there for a 24-48 hours   Instead consider either stopping in Death Valley (Telescope Peak will be up out of the heat) and/or Devils Postpile and Mono Lake and then entering Yosemite from the east.   You are burning a bunch of time looping around the western Sierra that you could be spending exploring the eastern sierra.  3) A bunch of the stuff you have listed in Zion/Vegas is going to be in 100-120 degree weather.  This may (or should anyway) temper your expectations a bit. Of the Vegas stuff, the Charleston loop is at elevation and will get you out of the heat.   Red Rock/Valley of Fire/etc will be sweltering in June  Day hikes into the Grand Canyon in the heat of the summer are generally not advisable.  4) Yosemite Falls might be dry or nearly dry by late June this year.  Thats a long hot switchback slog for not a lot of payoff if that is the case.  5) Young Lakes from Glen Aulin is a nice overnight (you can either take the trail or head directly over Ragged Peak Pass to get there) Cathedral to the Valley is also nice.   Bunch of other options depending on what trailheads are available.  (I'd also consider Lyell Canyon, Mono/Parker Pass, or doing Clouds Rest as an overnight if you are looking for something in the vicinity of Tuolumne)"
Yosemite,32r7mv,jakdak,2,Thu Apr 16 02:23:47 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your reply! Exactly the kind of info I was hoping to get  1: We will not be doing the through hike (even though I would like to) due to our lack of equipment.   2: We will take this into consideration. To be honest it hadn't crossed my mind  3: I suspect that our time in Vegas will be spent mostly relaxing, I just listed those there as potential things to do (goes for all cells in yellow). Seems like the heat might be a bigger issue than previously anticipated  4: In that case, could you recommend any other day hikes from in the valley? If not I guess we can head to another area of the park  5: Will look into these as well. I focused on Tuolumne since we will be driving out to Salt Lake City that way, but I am open to explore pretty much anywhere  Any chance you can explain how the trailhead quota system works? If its impossible to get a walk up permit to one of those areas it would make planning much easier."
Yosemite,32r7mv,jakdak,1 point,Thu Apr 16 03:18:30 2015 UTC,"1: We will not be doing the through hike (even though I would like to) due to our lack of equipment.   The equipment for that hike is readily available from the local outfitters that specialized in that route. If you have basic backpacking gear they will be able to get you everything else you need.   4: In that case, could you recommend any other day hikes from in the valley?   I'd generally recommend getting out of the Valley in late June :)  It will be a zoo and all of the Valley routes require climbing out of the valley. The Nevada/Vernal Falls loop is a must do, but beyond that the other main routes (4 mile, Snow Creek, and Yose Falls) all involve 2500+ vertical feet of switchbacks.  Better dayhiking options in the high country (either out of Tuolumne or Glacier Point)   Any chance you can explain how the trailhead quota system works?   See here:  http://www.nps.gov/yose/planyourvisit/wildpermits.htm  ""Of each daily quota for a trailhead, 60 percent can be reserved ahead of time while the remaining 40 percent is available on a first-come, first-served basis no earlier than 11 am the day before your hike begins as long as permits are available.""  Note that you can waste a lot of time waiting at the permit office, so advance reservations are highly preferable for a packed itinerary like you are planning"
Yosemite,32r7mv,jakdak,1 point,Thu Apr 16 03:32:06 2015 UTC,"Man I wish I had thought about outfitters for the narrows, that is a real bummer. Too late for a reservation now   At least the possibility of a walk up still exists. Thanks for clarifying and for the help"

You can do stuff like boil water for oatmeal, etc, in Curry on top of your bear box, and do bigger meals at picnic spots either with bbqs or by setting up your camp stove on a picnic table.    I know that's not AS convenient as having your own fire pit and picnic table, but it's a way to cook at least SOME home made meals while you're staying in Curry."

If you want a hotel room rather than a hostel bed in a shared room, you can also try calling Cedar Lodge and Yosemite View Lodge directly -- they hold back a few rooms from their online stock, so even if they look sold out online, they might have something for you.  As others have mentioned, the park will be slammed, so plan on long lines at the gate (Sunday AM shouldn't be too bad if you get there early) and a long wait to leave the park after your hike. If you're not too wrecked, stop off and have some beer and pizza at Curry and wait until well after dark to drive back out -- most people leave when it starts getting dark."

Unfortunately, I did not win the lottery this year.  I was wondering if my party can be part of the 6 in your permit and you can stay with us at the site?  Thought I throw it out there...let me know!  Thanks!"
Yosemite,32hdmt,jakdak,1 point,Thu May 14 08:09:00 2015 UTC,If you stay outside the park be sure to plan on hitting the park early.  It is not uncommon to have hour long lines at the entrance gates on holiday weekends.
Yosemite,32g6qv,Danielrh9,10,Mon Apr 13 15:15:44 2015 UTC,There is always clouds rest.  Then you can look down on half dome and laugh!
Yosemite,32g6qv,iheartmetal13,8,Mon Apr 13 16:58:41 2015 UTC,"There are a ton of other amazing hikes in Yosemite. Half Dome is pretty neat, but it's not the only place worth going. When you get to Yosemite, go to the visitor center and talk to a ranger and ask for some hike recommendations. Some good alternatives to Half Dome are Clouds Rest or El Capitan."
Yosemite,32g6qv,beefofages,3,Mon Apr 13 15:40:15 2015 UTC,"Hiking Clouds rest from the Valley is a harder hike with a better view. Try that instead. Half dome is cool, but it's not the coolest thing in Yosemite."
Yosemite,32g6qv,imthewalrus06,3,Mon Apr 13 19:36:51 2015 UTC,is a harder hike with a better view   The big issue with Half Dome is that you can't see Half Dome from Half Dome :)
Yosemite,32g6qv,jakdak,2,Tue Apr 14 00:13:31 2015 UTC,"Hi - This happened to me 3 years ago, and I'd been training with my 11 year-old. We ended up being able to go by finding a guide who had permits for one of the days we'd be there. Hiring him was really expensive, but my kiddo got to sit on top as an 11 year-old. Really worth it. You might look into it.  I got permits last year, and also this year. Am taking BOTH kids this time!"
Yosemite,32g6qv,deadhappypotamous,2,Mon Apr 13 17:37:16 2015 UTC,"I've been training with Half Dome as the goal, anything else would be heartbreaking at this point."
Yosemite,32g6qv,jakdak,8,Mon Apr 13 15:57:14 2015 UTC,"This is the logic that gets folks struck by lightening.  There's 750 miles of trails in Yosemite, many better than Half Dome."
Yosemite,32g6qv,beefofages,10,Mon Apr 13 19:48:15 2015 UTC,"Part of hiking is dealing with reality. Even if you had gotten a permit, there could have been a thunderstorm right as you got to the base of the cables. There are only so many permits per day, and there are probably a lot of people who have been training for it and don't get to go. If you're able to get a permit through the daily lottery, that's great, but you should also be realistic and think about other options in case that doesn't work out."
Yosemite,32g6qv,beefofages,-8,Mon Apr 13 16:00:31 2015 UTC,"Half Dome is the goal and the only option.  Not getting to the top means that one way or another, I'd have failed.  It's going to happen, I just have to find out how."
Yosemite,32g6qv,beefofages,6,Mon Apr 13 16:25:28 2015 UTC,Would you go up there illegally without a permit?
Yosemite,32g6qv,DouglassFunny,-1,Mon Apr 13 16:28:08 2015 UTC,"No, but I'd do everything just short of it to get there."
Yosemite,32g6qv,CakeMost1,9,Mon Apr 13 16:48:13 2015 UTC,"Well there you go, either you get a permit or you don't. If you don't get one, you might as well plan an alternative hike."
Yosemite,32g6qv,irwer,7,Mon Apr 13 17:12:21 2015 UTC,"Half Dome is the goal and the only option.   Sorry, but you sound completely unreasonable. Don't get so caught up in BS like this, and just go out an enjoy yourself in Yosemite."
Yosemite,32g6qv,UCLACommie,-5,Mon Apr 13 22:31:03 2015 UTC,What's the point of goals if you can't achieve them?
Yosemite,32g6qv,terrificmeow,8,Mon Apr 13 23:00:38 2015 UTC,"I've done Half Dome 3 times, once before the lottery and twice after. The 2 times after I didn't have tickets. We hiked up to the bottom of the cables where the Rangers setup their table and sit. Within minutes we had people asking if we need ticket because they had spares. People buy so many tickets at  time and then have people bail out. Even on the way down people were asking if we needed tickets. This was a few years ago, but it could be a possibility for you."
Yosemite,32g6qv,JennyFuckedCarly,2,Mon Apr 13 19:20:03 2015 UTC,"Awesome, that might be what I end up doing.  Can anyone else confirm this or comment on it?"
Yosemite,32g6qv,prelyt,1 point,Mon Apr 13 19:25:39 2015 UTC,I've done it before. We did a night hike and grabbed a few extra tickets from people coming down.
Yosemite,32g6qv,SmallVillage,3,Tue Apr 14 02:57:33 2015 UTC,Option #1: Daily lottery. You attempt a few days before your actual date (2 days I think).  Option #2: Get a backcountry permit. This isn't guaranteed but may give you an option.
Yosemite,32g6qv,jakdak,2,Mon Apr 13 19:15:59 2015 UTC,"Daily lotteries, but nothing is a guarantee."
Yosemite,32g6qv,UCLACommie,1 point,Mon Apr 13 15:38:51 2015 UTC,"You can climb it in the offseason when the cables are down (just laying on the granite, not really gone).  Less crowds, you might see like 2 or 3 people.  Going tomorrow 😊"
Yosemite,32g6qv,UCLACommie,1 point,Fri Apr 24 13:21:08 2015 UTC,"My advice is strictly telling you what I do in a similar situation. It is by no means viable advice and anything you do is at your own risk/discretion. That being said, I hit the trail for Half Dome at about 10 pm. Usually start to summit the cables by 3 or 4 am depending on the group I am with, watch the sunrise and then hike down before they have rangers up there checking permits. Now, when I did this I did in fact have permits, but no one checked them so I gave them to a couple of hikers who were coming up without permits. So if you really want to do this hike you can either try to do it when the rangers aren't there or try to find someone who is coming down and can give you theirs. Good luck!"

Yosemite,32ek5x,norcalhikerblog,1 point,Mon Apr 13 03:37:41 2015 UTC,"I did the North Rim Trail which started out on 120, summitted El Cap, Yosemite Falls, Eagle Peak, Yosemite Point, North Dome (I think), and came down Snow Creek to Mirror Lake. I wouldn't recommend it just because I felt like it was either insane uphill or insane downhill. But reaching the summit of El Cap and spending the night up there was one of the best experiences of my life. As was taking a shit that evening on a throne made of granite slabs overlooking yosemite valley including the ahwahnee."
Yosemite,32ek5x,ck_mooman,2,Mon Apr 13 18:10:27 2015 UTC,"Wow! How was the Snow Creek trail? How many days did you take? I might take a future trip up for Indian Rock, North Dome, and Snow Creek."
Yosemite,32ek5x,ck_mooman,1 point,Mon Apr 13 19:54:36 2015 UTC,"I am embarrassed to say we did not make it that far. It was myself and two friends. We just graduated high school and although I had quite a bit of outdoors experience I didn't have enough backpacking experience. We took shit like canned food and a GLASS JAR OF PEANUT BUTTER. I had a change of clean clothes for each day. My pack weighed 55 POUNDS. I did not train ahead of time and felt like I nearly died a few times. After we spent the night on el cap it rained the next day for 17 hours straight. We didn't have rain gear. We ended up stopping at yosemite falls, taking the trail down, and hitch hiking to our car back at the trailhead (we didn't plan that either). If we were in real wilderness we could have died we were so fucking dumb. But we still got El Cid on the way home. So silver linings I guess."
Yosemite,32ek5x,ck_mooman,2,Mon Apr 13 20:01:22 2015 UTC,At least you made the good decision to hike out. I think the Snow creek trail would be quite dangerous after a rain. The mountains will be there waiting for you. No urgency in bad conditions.
Yosemite,32ek5x,amberrgerr,1 point,Mon Apr 13 20:33:50 2015 UTC,Excuse me while I toot my own horn but I think that's where my experience shined through.

If I could afford the gas to drive to the eastern sierras for a proper photo, I would."

Yosemite,3263lo,GibraltarNetwork,1 point,Fri Apr 10 22:52:32 2015 UTC,Definitely the best winter hike available in Yosemite.
Yosemite,326o0p,Noswaldo,3,Sat Apr 11 01:07:06 2015 UTC,"Your options are going to be limited; campgrounds sell out within moments of becoming available online, several months in advance. Depending on when you're going in May more campgrounds outside the Valley may be open. Any campground is going to have lots of families around, but the three Pines CGs in the Valley are the most family-oriented (and are sold out anyway). In the Valley, Camp 4 is first-come, first-served; your chances of getting a spot improve on weekdays. If Bridalveil Creek on Glacier Point Rd is open by then, that might be a good option; if Tamarack Flat or Yosemite Creek on Tioga Rd are open (unlikely, but possible), those would also be good as they are quite out of the way.  Swimming is not recommended in May -- the water will be icy cold."
Yosemite,326o0p,bfg_foo,4,Sat Apr 11 01:43:29 2015 UTC,"In addition to the other comment, Camp 4 seems a little rowdier to me. As noted, campgrounds sell out quickly so Camp 4 (which is all walk-ups I think) is for people playing faster and looser, which people with kids seem to avoid. That said there are a ton of people. It'll be hard to avoid pissing someone off if you're up late and loud."
Yosemite,326o0p,UCLACommie,0,Sat Apr 11 01:46:21 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the replies people, counting my blessings that I asked Reddit first since we were just planning on turning up. Seems I seriously underestimated how easy it was to camp in Yosemite! With that in mind are there any alternatives you would recommend? We are spending six days travelling from San Francisco to Vegas and need places to camp along the way. Yosemite looks spectacular but pretty much anywhere with beautiful scenery and a place to pitch a tent will do for us"
Yosemite,326o0p,bfg_foo,2,Sat Apr 11 02:24:59 2015 UTC,"There are USFS forests surrounding Yosemite, so if you can't find a place to camp in the park, you might be able to find a spot in the surrounding forests. You would need to check the website for each forest, e.g. http://www.fs.usda.gov/recmain/stanislaus/recreation for Stanislaus.   Assuming you're planning on going over the Sierra instead of south through Bakersfield, your route will be impacted by which roads/passes are open at the time. Hwys 4, 108, and 120 are all closed for the winter; US 50 is now open, and of course the interstate stays open year-round.   If 120 (Tioga Rd) through Yosemite isn't open when you want to travel (it has opened in early May the last three years and this year will probably be the same, though a late storm could keep it closed a bit longer), I'd check 108 next. The Sonora Pass is beautiful, and you travel primarily through USFS land along that route. It is possible that some of those campgrounds might be open when you are looking to travel. You can check current road conditions at http://www.dot.ca.gov/cgi-bin/roads.cgi or by calling 1-800-427-7623."
Yosemite,325tdr,SuckerFreeCity,2,Fri Apr 10 20:45:00 2015 UTC,"Traffic is great. Just check ahead for construction and weather, in case it affects your route into the park (209 372 0200 for updates). Carry chains if you're going up the 41."
Yosemite,325tdr,staminatea,2,Fri Apr 10 23:56:00 2015 UTC,"Horsetail Fall isn't terribly exciting this time of year, if indeed there is any water in it at all."

Yosemite,325tdr,bfg_foo,2,Sat Apr 11 02:01:46 2015 UTC,"Have you done the short walk (~1mi round trip) to the base of Yosemite Falls yet? If not, definitely hit that. Near the Ahwahnee you can walk out into the meadow and, if the weather has been warm enough to melt some of that snow, see the Royal Arches Cascade, which is an ephemeral cascade waterfall down the rock face above the Ahwahnee.   Are you headed back into the park after the railroad, or is that on your way out? You'll want to stop off at Tunnel View, but if you're coming back into the Valley that'll be the best time for it (time it near sunset if you can)."
Yosemite,322oy0,jakdak,3,Fri Apr 10 02:23:02 2015 UTC,"Thank goodness , it's something!"
Yosemite,322oy0,andyjeff76,2,Fri Apr 10 10:23:34 2015 UTC,Don't get too excited. It's so dry out there that when that snow melts the water is going to strip alot of top soil away. If there is enough erosion a landslide/ mudslide could occur.
Yosemite,323oa1,Tinshake,3,Fri Apr 10 09:05:54 2015 UTC,"Yosemite is a huge park and no one place will get you to it all without a drive. That said, most people's first visit is to the valley where you have many of the iconic views of Half Dome, Yosemite Falls, Bridal Veil and the likes. There you have the Yosemite Lodge (hotel like), Curry Village (tent cabins), Housekeeping Camp (individual buildings), Ahwahnee (high end hotel) and several campsites (Upper Pines, Lower Pines, North Pines and Camp 4*).   The valley also offers the benefit of shuttles to get around to those same sights (if you don't stay there, when you drive in, use the shuttles from the main parking lot). It also means lots and lots and lots of people in peak season (may is early but not that early).  That said, Yosemite is also a very popular place and even in May, much of it will be full so don't be surprised if you have trouble finding space (exception: camp 4 does not take reservations and is always worth trying, with a fall back plan... which is not sleeping in your car).  The great news is that there's a ton of other places worth staying in Yosemite too! Not all of them will be open in early may but with such a poor winter, I'd check everything just in case: http://www.nps.gov/yose/planyourvisit/campgrounds.htm.  On the south side of the park, you have Wawona which has a hotel and campground. This puts you near Glacier Point road, sentinel dome and some great hikes plus a shuttle into the valley a few times a day (don't recall when it starts running). Along the west entrance you have Crane Flat and White Wolf though those usually don't open till summer.  Just outside the park on the west is a hotel that many last minute groups seem to end up at. It's an hour to the valley but again, you don't have to get to the valley to experience Yosemite... plenty to see right as you enter the park. To the south you have the town of oakhurst and cabins following it up, 90 minutes to the valley. Both those entrances also have national forest and private camping options around as well.  Given your budget and desire to experience the park, I'd suggest ditching the pricey hotels and putting that money into a tent and some bags. You'll have way more options finding a camping site and IMO, more fun."
Yosemite,323oa1,TedTravels,2,Fri Apr 10 16:52:32 2015 UTC,One more thing: note that there is truly no gas in the valley and the winding / hilly roads can drain a low tank before you make it back. Fill up before or just when you enter the park (wawona or crane flat)!
Yosemite,323oa1,TedTravels,1 point,Fri Apr 10 16:54:14 2015 UTC,"Wow! I cant begin do describe how thank full i am for this. Thank you so much!  I know my SO will appreciate this so much, its one of her childhood dreams to see redwood and explore the park. Thank you for making it just that much easier. I will take it all into consideration :)"
Yosemite,323oa1,TedTravels,1 point,Sat Apr 11 10:58:02 2015 UTC,"Sure thing! Like so many here, I've spent a LOT of time in the park so let us know if you have any questions as that trip gets closer... You're going to have a blast."
Yosemite,32245a,korravai,3,Thu Apr 9 23:29:54 2015 UTC,"I have done this hike.  Would suggest WW to Glen Aulin/Tuolumne.  There are some nice sites along the river maybe 1/2 mile east of Pate Valley.  Watch for rattle snakes in Pate.  One thing that messed us up a bit - there are two bridges... One was not on the map.  There is a bridge around ""register creek"", and another nearer the hill climb to Waterwheel.  The map shows only the one nearer waterwheel.  It's a great hike."
Yosemite,32245a,climber514d,1 point,Fri Apr 10 00:31:42 2015 UTC,"Good info, thanks! It sounds like WW to Glen Aulin is the winner for sure."
Yosemite,32245a,mdumont,2,Fri Apr 10 23:09:15 2015 UTC,"My girlfriend and I did this hike last summer, our first real trip to Yosemite, and it was fantastic.  We did WW -> Tuolumne Meadows, and it was definitely a long day #1 getting down into Pate Valley.  I also suffer from altitude sickness pretty easily, so we didn't make it that far on day 2.  The climbing back up is definitely a doozy on day 2 and most of day 3, but we really appreciated that we were climbing up while looking at the waterfalls along the way, instead of climbing down the falls and looking back.  We stayed one night at Pate Vally, one night on a rocky ledge that was right before a large set of exposed switchbacks, and one night at Glen Aulin.  One thing we did that made the trip a lot easier was the night before the switchbacks, getting to sleep early, and waking up around 5AM to tackle that climb before the sun rose.  We plan to do this trip again, probably from the other direction for variation, and to take a rest day in Pate Valley because it was beautiful and relaxing.  We saw a handful of folks down there, but it wasn't really busy at all.  As always in Yosemite, make sure you have a bear can and know how to secure/hide it at night.  We ran into two families of bears (a mother and 2 cubs each time) in Pate Valley, but once we made noise from a good distance they cleared the trail and went there own way.  I would definitely recommend trekking poles, probably either direction, but I found them particularly useful for the descent from WW into Pate Valley.  Hope you enjoy the trip!  All this recounting has made me want to get back out there sooner than I currently have planned."
Yosemite,32245a,mdumont,2,Fri Apr 10 03:03:23 2015 UTC,"Thanks for all the info! It sounds like WW to Glen Aulin is the winner, and we'll probably take our zero day in Pate Valley as well.   We do have a bear can but I'm not sure I know about hiding it? I thought you just had to keep your kitchen 100 feet from your campsite. Are you supposed to bury it as well or something?"
Yosemite,32245a,drmissmodular,3,Fri Apr 10 23:14:11 2015 UTC,"We had been taught to secure it somewhere, so if the bear does find it and recognize it as a potential source of food, it's not easy for them to knock it loose/down a hill/into the river/etc in their attempt to gain access to it.  The only time we really worried about this was the night we were camped on a rocky outcropping where it wouldn't have been surprising for it to roll down and off the ledge if it got knocked in the right direction.  We hid it low in some crevices between boulders that night so you really would have needed to get beneath it.  I'm not really sure how necessary it was, but given that we were 2 days into a 4 day hike, losing our food would have been a very bad situation."

Yosemite,31yteq,SmallVillage,1 point,Thu Apr 9 14:15:23 2015 UTC,"They save a certain percentage of permits for in-person reservations hiking out the next day.

Yosemite,31xucs,HerrGunther,2,Thu Apr 9 00:21:41 2015 UTC,"Routes that long are problematic this early in the season as you'll have to contend with lingering snow, seasonal stream crossings, and general sogginess.   (Plus on most years the high country will not be open, but this year may be one of the rare exceptions)  Maybe check out Lake Vernon and/or Jack Main canyon out of Hetch Hetchy. That likely will be a soggy mess but it should at least be snow free and the Vernon outlet creek crossing is bridged. (Check the conditions on the Wapama Falls bridge if you do this and do not attempt to cross it if it is flooded)"

I heard there was relatively no snow this year as well as the continued drought.   The key word there is ""relatively"".   On a normal year you wouldn't be able to string together a 4-5 day early May outing that didn't hit snow at all.  There is still some amount of snow in the high country- and that snow will be melting over the next month or two and the water flowing downhill into the various watersheds.   Areas that are bone dry in September can have waist deep snowmelt streams in May.  To see what an early spring outing in the high country would normally look like- see this album from a day trip out of White Wolf in June of '09:  http://www.fedak.net/albums/WhiteWolf.html  Conditions in early May will be entirely dependent on what storms we get between now and then.  The recent storms dumped up to 1-2 feet on various parts of the Sierra Nevada.  We got about 6 inches here at 7300' in Tahoe on Tuesday, and that has mostly already melted.   If there are no additional storms between now and May things will have dried out substantially (and most likely Tioga Road will have opened) and you'll have additional options.  The Hetch Hetchy route I recommended is among the lowest elevations in the park, has bridges over the 2 major stream crossings, and is the loop you requested.  But, for example, see here where I tried it in late May of 2004 and had to skip the northern section as I was wading through water up to my waist:  http://www.fedak.net/albums/HetchHetchyHigh.html"
Yosemite,31xucs,jakdak,1 point,Thu Apr 9 14:05:10 2015 UTC,"If we were to do this loop, which is now likely, where would we put the car?   Also, since we have 8 days in the park, I was thinking about doing some day hiking in the valley before heading out to do the overnight stuff. I hope that is doable. Feel free to PM me if you have any further advice or if there are questions you would like to pose to me."
Yosemite,31xucs,jakdak,1 point,Thu Apr 9 15:47:45 2015 UTC,"If we were to do this loop, which is now likely, where would we put the car?   Hetch Hetchy is a separate park entrance which can be reached from Evergreen road just outside of the park's western 120 entrance.   There is a backpacker parking lot (and campground) with bear boxes there a bit above the main day use lot.  http://www.nps.gov/yose/planyourvisit/loader.cfm?csModule=security/getfile&PageID=193337   I was thinking about doing some day hiking in the valley before heading out to do the overnight stuff. I hope that is doable.   Yup, more than doable.  And if the road is open you'd also want to visit Tuolumne Meadows.  Edit:  Oh and be aware the first couple of miles of that loop will be in the Rim Fire burn area from 2 years ago.  And if you want another option to look at, the route this guy did out of the Valley will probably be snow free as well: http://i.imgur.com/Oe4dPUd.png https://www.reddit.com/r/CampingandHiking/comments/30s0vv/went_backpacking_through_yosemite_this_past_week/"
Yosemite,31xucs,jakdak,1 point,Thu Apr 9 16:13:42 2015 UTC,What trailhead would we have to make a reservation for in order to do this?
Yosemite,31wb8f,iheartmetal13,4,Wed Apr 8 17:42:05 2015 UTC,glad I could help!
Yosemite,31u8lx,tronn4,1 point,Wed Apr 8 04:50:09 2015 UTC,From my 3/31 travel. Across the eastern meadow away from Swinging Bridge there was a sandbar. Jumped onto it (still got wet) and found the eastern most edge from where this shot is from.
Yosemite,31vl1p,harpervalleypta,1 point,Wed Apr 8 14:32:31 2015 UTC,"Depends on how far into ""Fall"" you are going.  Generally you'll want to start keeping a close eye on the weather after September or so.     Storm systems in the Sierra Nevada are very rarely surprises- they take days/weeks to come in from the Pacific and then cross California.  Gear will depend on where exactly you are going, how long you will be out (i.e. how much you need to prepare for the unexpected), and what the forecast looks like.     but wondered if anyone could report on actual temperatures they experienced rather than the averages.   I've been snowed on every month of the year :)"
Yosemite,31vl1p,jakdak,1 point,Wed Apr 8 15:25:18 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the information!  I'll be there the first 10 days of October. We plan to do two, four night trips into the backcountry.  The first will most likely be starting from Tuolumne Meadows and hiking around Cathedral Lakes, Clouds Rest, possibly Half Dome, and back, since shuttling options don't seem like an option that time of year.  Still planning the second outing.  edit: grammar hard"
Yosemite,31vl1p,jakdak,1 point,Wed Apr 8 17:07:09 2015 UTC,You are getting in just under the wire for being able to park overnight in the high country- that ends on October 15.  Mid October is a crapshoot- you won't know what the weather will actually be until right before your trip.  But at that elevation I'd generally expect cool afternoons and overnights down near freezing.
Yosemite,31vl1p,SmallVillage,1 point,Wed Apr 8 17:11:07 2015 UTC,"Cool, thank you for your insight.  Glad to know I've been preparing for the correct conditions."
Yosemite,31vl1p,jakdak,1 point,Wed Apr 8 17:40:11 2015 UTC,Expect down to freezing at night and highs in the 50-60's during the day. Be prepared for unexpected rain and/or snow storms as this time of year is very unpredictable.
Yosemite,31vl1p,SmallVillage,1 point,Wed Apr 8 17:37:12 2015 UTC,I'll keep my eyes on the weather during the weeks before the trip.  Any tips on how do best watch the weather over there?
Yosemite,31vl1p,jakdak,1 point,Wed Apr 8 17:41:45 2015 UTC,The 10 day forecast for the park will generally be accurate- you'll need to drop 10-20 degrees for the difference between the valley and the high country.  And you can watch the radar for storm systems coming in from the Pacific.
Yosemite,31rf1t,tronn4,1 point,Tue Apr 7 16:07:20 2015 UTC,sigh. the drought makes it so shallow
Yosemite,31tqj2,savidgeanimal,1 point,Wed Apr 8 02:13:41 2015 UTC,Reservations are not transferrable and they do check ID :(
Yosemite,31tqj2,jakdak,1 point,Wed Apr 8 03:31:23 2015 UTC,That sucks. So they'll willingly let a campsite go empty instead of allowing someone who's able to make it
Yosemite,31tqj2,tronn4,2,Wed Apr 8 03:37:20 2015 UTC,No you can cancel your reservation and they'll give it to someone else.  There was a big problem with folks running a black secondary market for reservations- which is why they now strictly enforce the transfer policy.
Yosemite,31tqj2,jakdak,1 point,Wed Apr 8 03:42:10 2015 UTC,"You can probably get away with the first night. For the past few years I reserve a Friday night during the peak months in Tuolumne, roll in at midnight+, check the site assignment list at the kiosk, and out by noon the next day. Never have I had anybody even ask what site I'm in, much less check ID. Most of the time I never even talk to anybody."
Yosemite,31tqj2,GoSh4rks,1 point,Wed Apr 8 06:27:20 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Last time I was there, we didn't get in until after the operating hours of the campgrounds. We just found our name on the list and went to our campsite. Unfortunately though, I think you're right about them checking ID the next day. Either way, thanks for putting this information out there."
Yosemite,31tqj2,iheartmetal13,1 point,Wed Apr 8 22:54:34 2015 UTC,"I feel your pain.  My wife double booked us this weekend too.  I have two sites in upper pines, and an RV I need to cancel."
Yosemite,31tqj2,iheartmetal13,1 point,Wed Apr 8 17:06:47 2015 UTC,Such a bummer. Hopefully you can get back there soon!
Yosemite,31tqj2,shrooki,1 point,Wed Apr 8 22:52:28 2015 UTC,We have sites for memorial day weekend and I think we are still going up on Saturday but just as a day trip.
Yosemite,31tmf3,air4borne,2,Wed Apr 8 01:41:18 2015 UTC,"It is extremely unlikely that the Hwy 120 YARTS will be running at that time; even if the road is open, they will have hired employees to start at a certain time, and there is maintenance to be done on the buses before the season begins.   It is also very unlikely, but slightly more possible, that the Tuolumne Meadows Shuttle Bus will be running by then; again, the issue isn't whether the road is open but whether the equipment and staff are ready. This wouldn't get you all the way to the Valley,  but as far as Crane Flat,  from where it would be easier to hitch.   Probably your best bet -- but again, it is EXTREMELY unlikely -- would be the Tuolumne Meadows Hiker Bus, which is basically a one-way ticket on the tour.  If you want to be safe, rent 2 cars, leave one at your exit trailhead and the other at your entry. Otherwise, you'll probably be hitchhiking.  (Also, it is possible -- though this year, unlikely -- that Tioga will still be closed that weekend. Have a backup plan just in case.)"
Yosemite,31tmf3,bfg_foo,2,Wed Apr 8 02:16:32 2015 UTC,If you are willing to cough up some $$$ there are private taxi services that will shuttle you.  Most are listed here: http://climber.org/data/shuttles.html  Or you could try your luck at hitchhiking
Yosemite,31tmf3,jakdak,2,Wed Apr 8 03:33:07 2015 UTC,This is super useful!  Thanks !
Yosemite,31tmf3,climber514d,1 point,Sun Apr 12 03:01:34 2015 UTC,"This might have to be my only option, thanks for the info."
Yosemite,31rjii,nhomewarrior,2,Tue Apr 7 16:39:10 2015 UTC,"First - they literally get thousands of applications a year. It takes time and effort to go though the mountain of paper and find the couple hundred people to refer to interview.  Second - (209) 372-1234  Also - Read up on DNC's ""Live Work Play"" brochure.  Being familiar with what and how DNC does things might make you stand out more than 'I want to live in Yosemite and you give out paychecks, right bro?'  Edit: Lastly - Good luck and keep at it. It is one hell of an experience."
Yosemite,31rjii,kosjubrmod,1 point,Wed Apr 8 03:32:27 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the response and advice. Is it late in the year to be hired for this season? If they just haven't got around to me yet that's fine, but if they've just ignored me and the jobs have been taken, then I'm going to be very disappointed. I'd really just like to know that all hope isn't lost yet."
Yosemite,31rjii,kosjubrmod,1 point,Wed Apr 8 03:48:43 2015 UTC,"Is it late in the year? I would think not.  There are plenty of seasonal positions that are still posted on the site as recently as the first of April (no pun intended). Do keep in mind that there are seasonal positions in the High Sierra Camps that wont open until late May or early June. Some long time employees like these positions, vacating their positions in the valley for the summer."
Yosemite,31rjii,kosjubrmod,1 point,Wed Apr 8 03:53:42 2015 UTC,"Awesome! That's very reassuring. I'll read the brochure, put in some new applications, and continue crossing my fingers I guess. I really want to go out there this summer and was just getting discouraged by the lack of communication with anyone. Now that I know there's still a chance I'll definitely keep trying. Also, who does that phone number connect to?"
