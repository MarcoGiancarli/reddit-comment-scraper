If this is what La Partition sounds like then I cannot wait. Still wish Mattieu would sing in french 'cause I can't understand him anyways, but I understand why they go with the english lyrics.   Also, anyone know what this track is from? Is it a track from LP or just scraps ala' 8'? Or even just a random tune they released?"

I think the rhythm guitars may be mixed a little too loudly, but then again maybe they aren't going for as much of the ambient wash that they had on Februus so I'll wait for the full record to judge.   Edit - I misspelled Meshuggah, I don't think I'm allowed to like this music anymore"

Not in the sense of orchestral/string sound or choral sound; but the guitar work on this track, the arpeggios and notably the rhythm in the bridge, it's downright orchestral writing.  Puts me in the head space of a rehearsal"

progmetal,3dz92f,PrinceVassago,7,Mon Jul 20 23:47:58 2015 UTC,This is composed in what is called sonata form.

progmetal,3du9r5,shadetheartist,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:00:59 2015 UTC,"Well your reply is agreeing with buriedinthenude where he says Fortress is ""easily their best"" (which I agree with) and you compared that to Blackwater Park with Opeth."
progmetal,3du9r5,Stinkfished,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:14:05 2015 UTC,That doesn't indicate anything about me saying Ghost Reveries is bad :<

progmetal,3du9r5,Hammerfist_Pucconi,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:44:45 2015 UTC,"huh, I think Kezia is much more original and has a lot more feeling. I love fortress but I think it's a little overproduced and riffy"
progmetal,3du9r5,TheDangerLevel,3,Mon Jul 20 14:59:54 2015 UTC,"I've only ever met one other person who liked Scurrilous more than Fortress. I think the idea of Fortress is a lot better than Scurrilous, but the latter just sounds way more mature and listenable.   Either way it's like comparing a 400 lb person with a 410 lb person. They're both huge."
progmetal,3dvk6j,Leginomite,8,Sun Jul 19 21:57:32 2015 UTC,"This track got me into them.  A long time ago I wasn't into harsh vocals at all (boy has that changed).  So a buddy of mine really was pushing for me to listen to Opeth and I didn't like anything because it was too intense for me.  Left it alone and forgot about it.    I used to play video games with my itunes on shuffle and one day this song came on and I was like, damn what the fuck is this?  From then on I listened to their material little by little and began to love all of their stuff.  Started with song, then damnation, then the heavier ones came to me little by little."
progmetal,3dvk6j,Kjata_,4,Mon Jul 20 02:20:09 2015 UTC,I am pretty sure that Opeth is the gateway drug to harsh vocals for a lot of us. I know that is the case for me.

progmetal,3duny6,nullfather,2,Sun Jul 19 18:38:19 2015 UTC,"Cynic is an odd experience for me. I got into them through the Atheist connection ('90s prog/death scene), but over time I found myself enjoying them more for their later lighter and smoother work. In particular, Kindly Bent was amazingly intriguing - not only for the style that I would describe as ""early Beatles making metal"", but for the incredible lyricism.   I have a complicated relationship with religion and theism in particular. I do not enjoy the majority of what would be described as ""religious"" music - gospel, Christian rock, etc. because to me it almost always comes off as hamfisted and preachy (literally). However, when I listened to Kindly Bent, I found something amazing. A whole album centered around a benevolent monotheistic deity, but written in such a sublime way that I was captivated by it instead of driven away.  This album is great in so many ways and it's up there on my list of favorites of all time. Ironic that I got into them through Atheist's Unquestionable Presence - which is another of my favorite albums."

I have one friend that only likes Focus and didn't really like Traced in Air or Kindly Bent, while some friends I have liked Traced in Air, Re-Traced and Carbon Based Anatomy but hated Kindly Bent.   My personal preference is Traced in Air, but I love everything they've done and the fact that they never try to repeat themselves is very admirable."

A press release explains that the upcoming collection is yet another concept LP, this time focusing on ""the wanderings of an unidentified man, stuck in a coma, as he journeys through his past lives."" The album is described as a Twilight Zone-style journey, and finds the protagonist making his way through the landscapes of his mind, being offered along the way to ""stay, or move on to the next in search of something better, something more 'perfect.'""  It cuts off there, unfortunately. The last song deals with the man waking up from his coma and realizing that his entire journey wasn't real. He walks outside, relishing the fresh air, and falls over dead."

It's a pretty intense and crazy song as it is, and they do an excellent job of nailing it, with all the band members chipping in on the vocals.      But the extended outro is what makes this live version unbelievable. What a badass way to end this track!"
progmetal,3dtiiw,stakoverflo,2,Sun Jul 19 08:36:48 2015 UTC,"Couldn't agree more. Any time I listen to the studio version now I'm always disappointed without that outro. Just so hardcore.

progmetal,3dt6rf,japgolly,4,Sun Jul 19 05:30:12 2015 UTC,"When I don't have time to listen to the entire album, I listen to this song. The guitar and drums lay down a bit of a feverish/crazy theme, which, combined with the synth bass later on makes a song unlike I ever heard before."

progmetal,3dt6rf,jklingftm,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:56:04 2015 UTC,"I think it's because this song takes a different turn from the other songs, in which the instuments are played in a more 'dragging' way, kinda laid back. Within my Fence jumps around a lot more. I think that's why they placed it in the middle of the album, as kind of a 'break' from the other themes. So maybe the different feel is why some people might not like it."

progmetal,3dq914,Cygnus421,4,Sat Jul 18 15:42:34 2015 UTC,They played their first show at Tech Fest UK. Before that they were sorta an online band - with members from the UK/Sweden/Austraia. In order for their live thing to work they got:  Connor Jobes (Nexilva) - Guitar   Ollie Rooney - (Ex-HAARP Machine) - Bass  Toby Mills (Aeolist) - Drums  people from other bands to help out.  I'd imagine they went with the programmed drums simply since they didn't know a drummer at the time.

It was stupid, but it worked. Also, there are plenty of progressive ""bands"" that are just one guy writing guitar parts, and programming drums for it. If they decide to tour, they bring people on tour with them. Plini is a good example of that. Same with the first Animals As Leaders' album."

Same drummer (Patrice Hamelin), also on hiatus for too long. Guitarist Daniel Mongrain also joined Voivod recently while Hamelin is with Gorguts now. This makes a reunion rather unlikely.  Warp Zone itself doesn't need much of an introduction. It's another classic prog death album. If you like other Canadian death metal like Gorguts or, well, Quo Vadis you will most likely love this but chances are that you are already aware of it.  I wouldn't exactly call Martyr underrated but it seems the Canadian death metal scene is often overlooked in comparison to the Floridian and Swedish counterparts."

Next thing he says is he has to go, walks to the stage door, jumps on stage and grabs the mic and just starts their set, absolutely belting. It was incredible. I'm really gutted he left but I look forward to new music from these guys and hold my hopes high for new voice work."

progmetal,3dmagj,Waldheri,19,Fri Jul 17 12:41:20 2015 UTC,"For Me their best album is Remedy Lane. One of the few albums I consider a masterpiece. Ending Themes is off Remedy lane. Shortly behind that one is BE though that one I can recognize as being more divisive, some think it too pretentious. The Perfect Element pt.1 is probably more widely considered their best and it's fantastic."
progmetal,3dmagj,The_Horny_Gentleman,3,Fri Jul 17 13:17:10 2015 UTC,I would also recommend starting with Remedy Lane!
progmetal,3dmagj,tonybaroneee,4,Fri Jul 17 13:34:12 2015 UTC,"I never understood why people thought BE was pretentious. How is it any different than any other prog concept album with an orchestra that explores religious and astrological themes? I can name a few others like that just off the top of my head, but for some reason, BE is the one that gets flak. It's weird."

progmetal,3dmagj,Crumple_Foreskin,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:19:47 2015 UTC,"The Perfect Element I is probably a better starting point if you have more of a taste for vocal melodies and harmonies than riffage, which I do."
progmetal,3dmagj,Bujjick,9,Fri Jul 17 14:22:54 2015 UTC,"Here's the order I'd recommend:   Remedy Lane The Perfect Element Pt 1 Entropia One Hour By The Concrete Lake BE Scarsick Road Salt 1&2   Remedy Lane is really accessible, TPE being a bit higher-concept but still accessible.  Entropia is rough around the edges, but full of great material.  OHBTCL is paced somewhat oddly, but has some of my favorite songs.  Somewhat less diverse than other albums.  BE is super-high-concept, and I think you'll appreciate it better if you don't start with it.  Don't listen to the hate on Scarsick, it's not as bad as people say.  It's simplified, aggressive, and direct, which is a change of pace.  Road Salts are retro-prog with a huge blues influence.  If you're into that kind of stuff it's great.  If you're just looking for metal, it's not for you."

progmetal,3dmagj,herhigh-ness,2,Fri Jul 17 13:28:49 2015 UTC,This is how I listen to any new band. Then I form an opinion once I've gone through everything they've done.
progmetal,3dmagj,Xeronin420,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:56:27 2015 UTC,"It's a good way to go about it in my opinion, especially with more progressive stuff."
progmetal,3dmagj,ViewtifulX,3,Fri Jul 17 23:42:25 2015 UTC,"To echo what others have said, Remedy Lane is a really good place to start - that's the album that Ending Themes comes from, after all. The Perfect Element is a similar style of music, compared to their latest albums, so that would also be a good place. For specific song recommendations, here are a few of my favourites:   In The Flesh Iter Impius King of Loss Beyond the Pale Linoleum To The Shoreline   Hope that helps! Enjoy getting acquainted with Pain of Salvation - they're one of my all time favourite bands, so I'm always happy to see some new interest in them!"
progmetal,3dmagj,stakoverflo,2,Fri Jul 17 14:02:06 2015 UTC,"RL and TPE are definitely the ones I'd say most representative if their sound, even though every album is so different. After that I'd say BE and Entropia or One Hour. I enjoy all their stuff, but the latest two / three aren't quite what I, or most fans, wanted necessarily.  Honestly DG just has a great voice, tons of range, and can be a really good lyricist if you actually read them. Technically speaking I wouldn't say they're the best musicians or anything, but they have a unique style and if you like it they're great."
progmetal,3dmagj,Cygnus421,2,Fri Jul 17 17:27:35 2015 UTC,Listen to BE in its entirety at some point.  Thats the only advice I can give you.
progmetal,3dmagj,demonofthefall,2,Fri Jul 17 17:49:45 2015 UTC,"This might be an unpopular opinion but the thing that made them click for me was 12:5. Live, rearranged versions of their songs. It's fantastic IMO."
progmetal,3dmagj,Ulti,2,Fri Jul 17 20:45:14 2015 UTC,That's an awesome album.

For me at least, his music got super preachy and I kind of tuned out.  There's so much great music without the political whining...."
progmetal,3dmagj,RimShimp,4,Fri Jul 17 13:42:59 2015 UTC,"If you're referring to Scarsick, I'd say the album has a pretty important message behind it. Unless your actual issue is just with the song ""America""."
progmetal,3dmagj,TheTortoiseWasRight,3,Fri Jul 17 14:41:46 2015 UTC,Could you expand a bit about the political thing? I'm pretty familiar with their latest records and didn't notice anything particular.
progmetal,3dmagj,Crumple_Foreskin,2,Fri Jul 17 13:50:58 2015 UTC,What are his political views?
progmetal,3dmagj,Polisskolan2,3,Fri Jul 17 14:23:26 2015 UTC,"He has a very typical ""Swedish"" naive leftist attitude that kind of makes me cringe, as a Swede. That said, I absolutely love PoS. The Perfect Element is probably the best starting point in my opinion."
progmetal,3dmagj,rekryck,2,Fri Jul 17 17:00:11 2015 UTC,Could you expand on that? I'm really curious.
progmetal,3dmagj,Polisskolan2,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:22:06 2015 UTC,"I wish I had time to elaborate, I'm about to get on a plane and I don't know if I'll have time to write anything the coming week. Lyrics-wise, the album Scarsick is by far the most cringe-worthy. The other ones are less political, and often have great lyrics. The song Kingdom of Loss is probably the worst offender. And I realize that the lyrics don't necessarily reflect the views of the Daniel Gildenlöw, and must be considered in the context of the story he is telling. Still, from various interviews and statements he has made, that I can't dig out right now, I get the impression that he does in fact have this sort of narrow-minded mindset that is very common in Sweden. Where you don't really know a whole lot about politics, economics, or anything really. Yet, you are completely convinced that America is the devil, that they're all greedy bastards that only care about money. That we should all be happy and love our government because we live in the greatest country on earth, where no one is poor and everything is free... Not at all like America, where they have stupid things like... money... and corporations. And guns of course.  Even if he happens to be more nuanced than I give him credit for, the lyrics on that album still make me cringe really bad.  I do remember reading about how, when looking for new band members, applicants would fill out a form where they were asked to explain their political views. I guess having a non-leftist in the band would be a disaster.   Found this interview where he makes the case that the song America is definitely a political song that should be interpreted as criticism of the American government. That does hint that we shouldn't view the songs as simply vehicles for the story he's telling, that they to some extent reflect his views and not just the views of the characters in his works. And the lyrics on that album have a little too much of that naive self-righteous leftist smugness - that I am so allergic to - to be just made up for the story."

progmetal,3ditaj,gotbeefpudding,8,Thu Jul 16 22:50:45 2015 UTC,They announced a new album this year in the same status of Lori's departure. I just wonder if everything has been scrapped.
progmetal,3ditaj,SandvoldTheMan,2,Thu Jul 16 18:19:25 2015 UTC,i feel like they didnt even start recording anything so i would expect it to be scrapped
progmetal,3ditaj,SandvoldTheMan,6,Fri Jul 17 00:37:44 2015 UTC,"I was camping with my family and was completely alone in a forest when i first heard it, so it was amazing. I was incredibly happy as I was dating a girl whom I was in love with at the time, and the music was so groundbreaking that all of the music seemed unreal, and pure energy. I think one of the strangest things about the album is that each song has a different value for me. Since that girl dumped me, each one of the songs has a different vibe that emotion has brought out, and songs that i previously disliked (time, the destroyer) have evolved to be a sonic representation of pure anguish, sadness and forgiveness, all in one. I experienced this album and learned to appreciate it in different states of emotion, and it felt beautiful every time.  EDIT: just realized that I responded to the wrong comment, so this seems completely out of the fucking blue. Hahaha"

progmetal,3ditaj,jaketheripper66,10,Thu Jul 16 17:15:20 2015 UTC,"man I find this really hard to believe.  Every time I've seen them they have been the tightest band of the night.  First time I ever saw them was with PTH and Jeff Loomis.  I'd never heard of the Safety Fire and just happened to catch their set and they were so damn good, one of the tightest bands I'd ever seen.  I bought Grind the Ocean on the spot and have loved them ever since.  Most impressive thing is that their live sound was so good that when i listened to the album I remembered most of the melodies and hooks from their set which is pretty rare for a really heavy, technical band."
progmetal,3ditaj,ElderlySouls,3,Thu Jul 16 17:39:44 2015 UTC,"They complained about the altitude every time they played(Denver), so that could be the issue. They even apologized a couple times when I talked to them after shows.   Like I said, I love the band. I have a bunch of merch from the band, and I even shelled out a decent amount of money for a drumhead with a drawing on it(a shark with tits, amazing), but they've been pretty bad every time I've seen them. Even people I talked to at shows noticed it. I go with the same group of friends to every show and they were bummed about it too."
progmetal,3ditaj,bbristowe,6,Thu Jul 16 18:48:33 2015 UTC,haha go figure since Denver is where I've seen them every time too.  We've probably been at the same shows and had totally different impressions of them.

I'm sure both artists have common influences.  Nobuo Uematsu is a well-known lover of progressive metal and rock, and has paid homage to his favourite artists. The FF7 soundtrack has some references to Led Zeppelin motifs, for example:  FF7 LZ  FF7 LZ  And in general, he is a big ELP fan and has made use of similar sounds a lot throughout his sountracks."

There's a define progressive metal sound in those songs and others from them. I still haven't checked out his new group Earthbound Papas yet though.

progmetal,3dis23,metagloria,2,Fri Jul 17 02:23:46 2015 UTC,I was entirely unaware that they were releasing a new album. From what I just listened to ([High Country])(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI-HrHi1YvY) it seems a little too chill for my tastes.   Seems like a lot of bands are doing something like this as they progress. Red Fang's latest album has some of the same issues.
progmetal,3dis23,DestroTheSiege,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:31:55 2015 UTC,"I think Warp Riders was their peak. It had a nice album structure and some seriously good songs. It balanced a little pop rock with good ole fashioned metal.   Apocryphon was a lot more pop rock and a lot less shred. It still had a few moments but all in all it is a transition album more than anything. So far High Country seems like they have gone full blown away from where they started, which isn't a bad thing for a band but in this case I think it is a decline in actual songwriting."

progmetal,3deqmh,blckravn01,3,Wed Jul 15 21:00:54 2015 UTC,Have you posted  this to r/destinythegame?
progmetal,3deqmh,Crosshash,2,Wed Jul 15 21:21:27 2015 UTC,I love your covers! Prelude Bombfare is still one of my highest played metal covers.
progmetal,3deqmh,jtansley,2,Thu Jul 16 12:43:13 2015 UTC,"Destiny is a bad game but I like this cover D:  It's such a strange video - you have all this awesome music set to these fantastical images and concept art... and yet the game is such a contrived, cynical cash generator where every single design choice was made purely to make money. It's quite a dissonant juxtaposition to say the least."
progmetal,3deqmh,cmiller999,3,Thu Jul 16 14:18:05 2015 UTC,"I couldn't disagree more, it may not be a perfect game, but it is incredibly fun and addictive at it's best, and in the last year Bungie have really done a terrific job listening to the community when it comes to improving and patching faults with the game.  My gf and I still play it almost every day, and we can't wait for The Taken King!"

progmetal,3deqmh,iop90-,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:45:47 2015 UTC,"Haha, I was telling my friend about this cover who has never heard of your band before and as I was telling him about it, another one of my friends sent me the link to the video.    Honestly, though.  I'm going to be playing this while I beat Sepiks to bits and pieces."
progmetal,3dh851,Spookylives,3,Thu Jul 16 06:37:50 2015 UTC,"Can't believe this is their debut album - it's excellent and even the production is high. BTW, it's both on Apple Music and on YouTube in its entirety and it's stunningly good."
progmetal,3dh851,philipmat,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:27:39 2015 UTC,This album sounds to me like heavier Explosions in the Sky.

progmetal,3dfdbq,ThePantsFairy,5,Wed Jul 15 20:56:37 2015 UTC,"Star One is awesome. If you like this, try Ayreon if you haven't already."
progmetal,3dfdbq,xnuo,3,Wed Jul 15 23:23:45 2015 UTC,Will do! At first Star One reminded me of Richard Andersson's Space Odyssey.

progmetal,3dg49m,Hillzzzy,5,Thu Jul 16 00:22:08 2015 UTC,"I enjoyed it overall. Not that I mean this band in particular, but the screamo vocal style in general puts me off a little. Still great music, though."
progmetal,3dg49m,chasmammoth,2,Thu Jul 16 03:21:39 2015 UTC,It's a slippery slope sometimes with vocals and this style isn't for everyone. Thanks for giving it a listen regardless!
progmetal,3dg49m,amongstravens,2,Thu Jul 16 04:19:28 2015 UTC,"Definitely hear that BtBaM influence in the instruments. Personally, I don't care for the harsh vocals (I prefer something . . . more emotional, if that makes sense. I don't feel any emotion from the harsh vox here) but everything else sounded great."
progmetal,3dg49m,P13666,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:14:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's another band I enjoy! Some of the other tracks from the EP sound a bit different to this one. Yeah I know what ya mean, vox aren't everyones things. Thanks for the listen and feedback!"
progmetal,3dg49m,Myosos,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:28:57 2015 UTC,"This reminded me of a supercross between The Safety Fire, August Burns Red, and some other post hardcore band that I can't quite think of. The first half was really tight and nice but the second didn't quite hold me for some reason.   Regardless, it sounds like you guys have a great idea of what you're doing and I'd definitely check more material out once it's released. Certainly post more when you get it!"
progmetal,3dg49m,OZONE_TempuS,1 point,Thu Jul 16 05:42:12 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the kind words!

progmetal,3detvm,MABGuitar,3,Wed Jul 15 20:28:47 2015 UTC,"I kind of expected it to suck, but this was actually pretty decent! (Way better than anything I could do, if I attempted this!)"
progmetal,3detvm,RagnarRipper,2,Thu Jul 16 00:58:18 2015 UTC,"It's sloppy and I don't love the mix, but hey, it was fun.  Pretty blatantly nabbed some drum parts and ideas from The Leper Affinity and some other places."
progmetal,3detvm,Noonlyzuul,2,Wed Jul 15 18:42:19 2015 UTC,very cool.
progmetal,3detvm,njtwkr,2,Wed Jul 15 18:48:34 2015 UTC,sweet man
progmetal,3detvm,PhilAITS,2,Wed Jul 15 21:10:25 2015 UTC,I like it! I think you could toss in a legato lead type thing over a lot of this to bring it to the next level. The part at 0:38 sounds like a straight ripoff but the rest of it hides it pretty well.
progmetal,3dfjow,lol-da-mar-s-cool,2,Wed Jul 15 21:41:19 2015 UTC,"OK, this one is really, really good"

progmetal,3dej1m,MatticusXII,13,Wed Jul 15 17:27:52 2015 UTC,With Contortionist and AAL? Best show I've ever been to.
progmetal,3dej1m,Killtrox,7,Wed Jul 15 18:34:45 2015 UTC,"Saw them after The Great Misdirect came out with AAL and TesseracT. They had Elliot in for Dan at that point, but they were still good. BTBAM were unreal live though."
progmetal,3dej1m,goodbye9hello10,10,Wed Jul 15 19:32:04 2015 UTC,"It was unbelievable. It was my first time seein BTBAM so I wasn't sure what to expect, but they are literally perfect live. The crowd energy was great as well. Amazing show. I got the White Walls set, luckily."
progmetal,3dej1m,robby622,4,Wed Jul 15 17:46:41 2015 UTC,"God I'm stoked to see them at Euroblast... here's hoping we'll get some of the ""older"" classics together with a lot of Coma Ecliptic.  The sound system at Euroblast is amazing... but sadly most bands drive it far too loud, so that it really hurts without plugs... and then when you use plugs, it muddles the sound... I kinda hate that.  Perhaps some people here might know how BTBAM are with the volume level... Do they drive it so that it hurts without plugs (for someone without previous significant hearing damage) or do I get to listen to the entire frequency spectrum?"
progmetal,3dej1m,BlueHatScience,5,Wed Jul 15 18:38:49 2015 UTC,"It doesn't hurt without plugs for me anymore lol... have you tried the ""hi-fi"" silicon plugs instead of the foam ones? they're not perfect but a big step up from cheap earplugs you would use for shooting or something like that"
progmetal,3dej1m,J_ROC_baby,2,Wed Jul 15 18:50:34 2015 UTC,Thanks! - I'll certainly try to find a more suitable replacement... too bad the Doppler Labs Plugs won't be avaliable by then :/  I've already lost hearing above ~18.2kHz ... don't want to lose more than I have to.
progmetal,3dej1m,BlueHatScience,3,Wed Jul 15 19:27:04 2015 UTC,"I thought their sound was perfect. Good volume but not too loud, really good clarity as well. Though to be fair, I'm sure the venue I was at played an important role in that. But still"
progmetal,3dej1m,robby622,9,Wed Jul 15 19:39:57 2015 UTC,"They were great. Saw them in Athens with the VIP pass. I would have liked it better if it had been at the masquerade in atlanta because the atmosphere is better IMO for a metal concert. AAL had the kick pedal a little too loud and BTBAM had the vocals a tad too low, but that's all my opinion. Great show with a great crowd."
progmetal,3dej1m,sh1dLOng,2,Wed Jul 15 19:19:38 2015 UTC,"how was the VIP pass experience? i didn't get but was debating, how was the q & a?"
progmetal,3dej1m,sh1dLOng,3,Wed Jul 15 19:50:05 2015 UTC,"The Q&A was great. Really down to earth guys. I did it mostly for that reason alone, just to get to see these guys away from the music. I didn't ask any questions, because I honestly don't care about the inspiration behind the music rather than to see the personalities of the people who are the creators of some of my favorite music over the past 10 years. Totally worth it in my opinion. Those guys deserved the $60 from me. I've definitely gotten at least 10 times that much enjoyment out of their music over the last decade."
progmetal,3dej1m,ElapseEvolveExpand,0,Wed Jul 15 20:42:21 2015 UTC,It was AAL and BTBAM right? No Contortionist?
progmetal,3dej1m,sh1dLOng,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:03:34 2015 UTC,Contortionist was there but I was too busy in the bars downtown to see them. Hate that I missed them
progmetal,3dej1m,iamvillainmo,3,Wed Jul 15 23:16:57 2015 UTC,"At the Venue 578 in Orlando, the VIP pass also granted you access to reserved parts of the club. Most of these were in prime stage viewing area. The floor was open for GA, but some of the best seats audio and visual wise was right behind the floor in the VIP area.  Show was amazing. Worth every penny. Loved The Contortionist set, played everything I could have hoped for. Animals as Leaders had an interesting show, that contained lots of their older material.  BTBAM was BTBAM, amaizng."
progmetal,3dej1m,kevinnn32,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:01:53 2015 UTC,"Duuuude that place was packed, great show though, everyone was hyped and the band's were damn near flawless."
progmetal,3dej1m,J_ROC_baby,3,Thu Jul 16 05:44:45 2015 UTC,"I'm also wondering, they're not coming very close by to me and I've already seen them 4 times so I have the sense it might not be worth it... but please let me know if you remember to!"
progmetal,3dej1m,metagloria,4,Wed Jul 15 18:45:24 2015 UTC,"Seen them four times before, but not on the current tour. They've been spectacular every time though."
progmetal,3dej1m,jglobal,3,Wed Jul 15 19:53:03 2015 UTC,I saw them a week ago for the third time. They've been great every time I've seen them and they closed with White Walls.
progmetal,3dej1m,KennyKatsu,3,Wed Jul 15 22:16:31 2015 UTC,I'm seeing them the 22nd in SD. I've seen them live 2 years ago and it was honestly one of the best sets I've ever seen in my life. They honestly always put a good show. Also AAL is playing with them as well and they always put a great show.
progmetal,3dej1m,izakk1220,3,Thu Jul 16 07:31:29 2015 UTC,I saw them play parallax II in its entirety for the first time ever live. Shit was unreal. Starting with everyone singing the beginning of goodbye to everything to them ending with white walls. One of the greatest times of my life.
progmetal,3dej1m,pagar049,3,Thu Jul 16 14:12:51 2015 UTC,"Went for animals as leaders, but all three bands were amazing but BTBAM ended true show with the most amazing encore. They performed bohemian Rhapsody by queen and the whole crowd exploded, definitely worth going man."
progmetal,3dej1m,MethodicDiscord,3,Thu Jul 16 15:04:47 2015 UTC,"I have seen BTBAM live about 6 times now.  I had the VIP ticket and the whole experience was fantastic.  The Q&A was fun and great, and VIP got in the door before everyone else so i was on the rail almost center.    We were so close to the stage i could have easily untied Paul's shoes when he came over to the edge to jam out. The Contortionist put on their best performance i've seen yet (this was time number 4 i think?)  They opened with Holomovement and followed it up with FLOURISH.  Crowd had SO much energy.  I was thrilled that they played stuff from all their albums and not just their new stuff.    BTBAM played a varied set which was awesome - and included something off most every album (nothing off of selftitled, silent circus, or parallax 1).   Even after seeing them all these times i saw them perform 3 songs i've never heard them play before - including older stuff off Colors!  (Hooray prequel!)  By far the best BTBAM show i've been to.  They closed our show with Bohemian Rhapsody.  The only thing i would have changed about the whole experience is i wish they had closed with White Walls instead like they have at other shows on this tour.    10/10  Bonus - here are the pics i snapped from my phone.  This was my view of the concert.  So good. http://m.imgur.com/a/fROJn  EDIT - added photo album"
progmetal,3dej1m,KennyKatsu,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:24:36 2015 UTC,Did they play something from TGM? I'm looking at the setlists online and they don't have any songs from them. There was one show where they played Disease Injury Madness but that was one of the earlier shows.
progmetal,3dej1m,MethodicDiscord,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:04:18 2015 UTC,"I went to the first show of the tour in Athens Ga.  They performed Disease, Injury, and Madness."
progmetal,3dej1m,KennyKatsu,2,Mon Jul 20 18:05:32 2015 UTC,Yeah I'm guessing they dropped it later during the tour because it's not on the other dates after that. Bummer because I love that song!
progmetal,3dej1m,MethodicDiscord,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:18:00 2015 UTC,On the flip side they have played white walls on the later ones and didn't play it for us.  Oh well.  :-)
progmetal,3dej1m,KennyKatsu,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:34:23 2015 UTC,"Awww haha. Luckily I'm seeing the White Walls set this Wed. I love Bohemian Rhapsody but White Walls is just another level of epicness. Anyways, cheers!"

Glad I saw The Contortionist finally. Also BTBAM played White Walls as their encore :/ I was really hoping for Bohemian Rhapsody."

progmetal,3dfovh,DogOfSevenless,2,Wed Jul 15 22:20:31 2015 UTC,there might be some new stuff coming from them later this year but I haven't heard much.

progmetal,3dez6y,oneofthefewproliving,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:03:59 2015 UTC,Where have you heard that? In what little research I did in preparation of posting this it seems the band is still on hiatus but it's not exactly clear. Their last facebook entry dates back to 2012. Poor Patrice Hamelin doesn't seem to have much luck with bands although he does seem to be with Gorguts now.
progmetal,3dbi9e,Leginomite,9,Wed Jul 15 00:01:19 2015 UTC,"Yep.  Great song.  Also ""Circumstances.""  Always thought the cover art for this one was significantly below their ability."

progmetal,3dbi9e,OZONE_TempuS,-1,Wed Jul 15 18:04:31 2015 UTC,"I didn't say I learned it over night :).  It took several months learning by ear, and it was way before I knew anything about scales.  It helped me learn how to hammer on and pull-off quickly, which I was grateful for since a large portion of the bands I listen to use those techniques, so I was able to grasp it early on because of this song.  The only thing I wasn't able to do correctly for the longest time was the volume swells during the solo part.  I was a teenager and didn't have the money for pedals, and using the volume pot didn't sound right."
progmetal,3dbi9e,FourThunders,2,Wed Jul 15 19:15:05 2015 UTC,Yeah that is not true.
progmetal,3dbi9e,DoodleKaboodle,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:23:44 2015 UTC,By far my favorite guitar solo ever. The build up is so intense and the bass and drums suit the solo perfectly
progmetal,3dbi9e,octacok,2,Wed Jul 15 14:25:31 2015 UTC,"This is good, and technically amazing, but my songwriting sensibilities tend toward the more simple, catchier stuff. Because of this I find my favorite Rush material starts at Permanent Waves and moves forward from there."
progmetal,3dbi9e,McWaddle,3,Wed Jul 15 06:03:15 2015 UTC,"I like complex stuff too, but find this structurally very unsatisfying. It's mostly just bits glued together, many of which aren't actually that good in their own right. The ""A Lerxt In Wonderland"" section (3:16+) is really, really beautiful though. I wish they'd written a whole song based on that."

progmetal,3dbkns,BoopysRevenge,2,Wed Jul 15 00:19:41 2015 UTC,Opeth has made a lot of really good songs but I am convinced that this is the best song of theirs. This has been one of my top 5 favourite songs of all time since I heard it five years ago and I still have trouble believing that it was created when I was only a year old.
progmetal,3dbkns,webuildmountains,3,Wed Jul 15 02:34:04 2015 UTC,"This is my favorite Opeth song ever created too. I am also inclined to agree that this is literally their magnum opus. Everything about this song is beautiful, captivating and outright amazing. For a 20 minute song that I've probably listened to hundreds of times by now I have never once felt it has over stayed its welcome or been bored by it. All of the transitions flow perfectly while the riffs and tempo changes keep the song interesting.   I was 8 years old when it was created. I had no idea it existed back then. Truly some magical shit was going on and we were both oblivious. What is most amazing about things like this is how it can bring strangers like you and I together to express our excitement and love of what is truly a musical masterpiece."
progmetal,3dbkns,OZONE_TempuS,2,Wed Jul 15 03:47:54 2015 UTC,Still waiting for the live performance
progmetal,3dbkns,Polisskolan2,3,Wed Jul 15 02:34:38 2015 UTC,I don't think you'll see it since Mikael Åkerfeldt doesn't seem to like it. I think he stated that the song is nothing special and that the only reason people like it is that it's over 20 minutes.
progmetal,3dbkns,balzear,2,Wed Jul 15 10:12:42 2015 UTC,Honestly as a bassist the whole of Morningrise is amazing to play. But man that bass runs at 2:23 and the riff starting at 13:38 make me smile like an idiot every time.
progmetal,3dbkns,balzear,3,Wed Jul 15 06:31:35 2015 UTC,I play bass too and I feel like it's probably one of the reasons I love the album so much.   That riff gives me goosebumps every time it starts.
progmetal,3dbkns,MatticusXII,2,Wed Jul 15 06:36:16 2015 UTC,"Also Orchid. I mean every album has great, fun and interesting to play bass line but Orchid and Morningrise just oomph step it up a notch."
progmetal,3danzm,OZONE_TempuS,13,Tue Jul 14 20:20:30 2015 UTC,I decided to look up whatever happened to these guys and stumbled across their Wikipedia page. It's incredibly shocking how rocky the history of this band has been and sad how ugly the last few months were for these guys. Really hoping they settle differences or whatever needs to happen to make new music together.
progmetal,3danzm,P13666,13,Tue Jul 14 21:16:22 2015 UTC,"The singer on Nocturne and Midheaven dropped so low into obscurity that maybe a year after he was booted from the band, I added him on Facebook, and had casual conversations with him, and even got him to listen to my music, and he agreed to even do vocals on one of my crap songs if I wanted (I never went through with it). It's sad that he went from main staging a Warped Tour to agreeing to work on music with random fans.   One time I suggested that he should try to talk to the band again once the newer singer, Travis, momentarily left. He actually tried at my suggestion and says he was flat out ignored.  I adore this band's music, but I really get the vibe that there were some shitty people in it."
progmetal,3danzm,DaltoniusRex,4,Wed Jul 15 00:47:16 2015 UTC,I thought he had such a unique voice. I was a huge fan.
progmetal,3danzm,The_Pert_Whisperer,2,Wed Jul 15 03:09:26 2015 UTC,One of my favorite vocalists just due to how unique his sound was in prog metal.
progmetal,3danzm,JustSomeGoon,2,Wed Jul 15 22:42:02 2015 UTC,"It's really hard to tell who's the asshole in that sort of situation, though. His departure from the band was pretty ugly, and he said a lot of negative things about them in its wake. Whether or not those things were justified, I understand them not wanting to talk to him."
progmetal,3danzm,FullCombo,2,Wed Jul 15 12:45:40 2015 UTC,"Did he? Because I honestly don't recall him saying a thing about them. I just recall the band frequently attacking him. Two examples that always stuck in my mind were 1) Dean responding to a question on Ask.FM by saying that they never really liked him and his girly voice, and 2) The band's Facebook page posting a sarcastic million dollar Digital Veil pre order that included 'Nathan's dress.'"
progmetal,3danzm,DaltoniusRex,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:00:23 2015 UTC,"I definitely remember him saying stuff about them on his Facebook, but it was really only when asked about it by fans. What I found strange was that he was speaking negatively about Travis Richter, who didn't join the band until long after Nathan was gone and therefore had nothing to do with his departure. It seemed kind of petty, but I guess it's not any worse than anything the rest of the band said (especially the dress thing, that was just plain dumb)."

progmetal,3danzm,mohonay,6,Wed Jul 15 12:52:42 2015 UTC,One the bands I most dearly miss.
progmetal,3danzm,sirmeowmix,6,Wed Jul 15 02:00:44 2015 UTC,"I remember listening to this album religiously when it first came out.  Primarily the concept of the album is the reason why I stay away from any social media.  Even with reddit, I lurk and post every now and then.    The world was not ready for A.J."

progmetal,3danzm,JarHead413,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:33:13 2015 UTC,I feel the same. Just came about at the perfect time for me musically and lyrically. I'd kill to hop into the timeline where they stayed together and made some amazing things.
progmetal,3danzm,Bromanov,2,Wed Jul 15 05:22:59 2015 UTC,It makes me really really really sad that they ended the band after this masterpiece album
progmetal,3danzm,ntdars,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:36:49 2015 UTC,They killed it live. Definitely a favorite album.
progmetal,3danzm,ToneZone15,1 point,Mon Jul 20 07:21:33 2015 UTC,"I know there are very few people like me, but I find that Midheaven is their best album.  The other two ones are still wonderful though."
progmetal,3danzm,webuildmountains,4,Wed Jul 15 00:34:27 2015 UTC,Midheaven was a great album but in a completely different way as their other two (it almost sounds like it was made by a completely different band). Nocturne will always be my favourite album by them just because had it not been created I may have never gotten into prog metal.
progmetal,3danzm,JarHead413,4,Wed Jul 15 02:36:37 2015 UTC,"Lost their core songwriter, new guitarist and his vocal style was rather varied and different. Literally could have been another band. I still think it's their worst album of their major 3 but at the same time I still go on kicks where that sound they ended up with is just what I wanna hear. Breathing Life Into Devices is such a fun song to listen to."
progmetal,3danzm,BigDon8,1 point,Wed Jul 15 05:11:57 2015 UTC,They had more than 3 albums?
progmetal,3danzm,DaltoniusRex,3,Fri Jul 17 15:49:31 2015 UTC,"I almost agree except that it was recorded awfully. My favorite writing, but awful recording."
progmetal,3danzm,ToneZone15,2,Wed Jul 15 00:44:19 2015 UTC,Touché.
progmetal,3danzm,JarHead413,2,Wed Jul 15 00:48:05 2015 UTC,All I remember is they fired their producer (Colin Richardson IIRC) halfway for creative reasons and that probably fucked them on their recording budget so we got less than stellar recordings. Shame really.
progmetal,3d9t0g,OZONE_TempuS,9,Tue Jul 14 16:50:27 2015 UTC,The transition of this song really defines what Opeth is about (imo). The heaviness of Mikael's voice and the first half of the song feels like you're being dragged to hell. Then a complete 180 with his vocals and music makes it feel like you're being uplifted straight into heaven. This is why I love Opeth so much. They give you the full spectrum of music and emotions throughout their discography.
progmetal,3d9t0g,opethordie,3,Tue Jul 14 18:26:10 2015 UTC,Mendez is also amazing in this song
progmetal,3d9t0g,Smerphy,3,Tue Jul 14 18:36:17 2015 UTC,7:40  omg
progmetal,3d9t0g,MatticusXII,2,Tue Jul 14 18:42:56 2015 UTC,"head banging masterpiece  EDIT: haven't listened to it in awhile, and when Mikael comes in with the cleans at 3:55 i totally cracked a smile"
progmetal,3d9t0g,metagloria,-10,Tue Jul 14 20:54:52 2015 UTC,"Never a big fan of this song. Not as poor as ""A Fair Judgment"", but not great."
progmetal,3d9t0g,exscape,17,Tue Jul 14 16:52:18 2015 UTC,As poor as? A Fair Judgement is one of their absolute best songs IMO. One of the best solos I've heard.
progmetal,3d9t0g,kronikwankr,6,Tue Jul 14 17:59:29 2015 UTC,"6:14, god I fucking love that solo. That's something I always play when I pick up a guitar"

progmetal,3d9t0g,TheFaceo,2,Tue Jul 14 18:25:49 2015 UTC,no kidding. That acoustic break in the middle is just so wonderful.
progmetal,3d9t0g,Metalocachick,5,Tue Jul 14 19:44:47 2015 UTC,A Fair Judgment is in my top 10 Opeth songs...
progmetal,3d9t0g,intraspeculator,2,Tue Jul 14 20:13:14 2015 UTC,"Not a huge fan of this either (relative statement, of course) but damn that main riff is fun to play on guitar!"
progmetal,3dbh2g,Emotional_Ewok,6,Tue Jul 14 23:52:24 2015 UTC,this one is so much fun to play. I can just go insane. The GOB breakdown is cool too.
progmetal,3dbh2g,TheFaceo,5,Wed Jul 15 01:20:48 2015 UTC,I fondly remember sucking at this song in Guitar Hero World Tour
progmetal,3dbh2g,Alligator_Fuck_Haus,4,Wed Jul 15 03:47:38 2015 UTC,God I love this album. Also I highly recommend their most recent album. They went full Queen and it's amazing.
progmetal,3dbh2g,jwoerd69,5,Wed Jul 15 07:35:11 2015 UTC,Great song but I prefer this version I found a while ago. It was mixed by Muse themselves and adds a cool new section in the middle.
progmetal,3dbh2g,noticeperiod,2,Wed Jul 15 13:22:18 2015 UTC,"Love Map of the Problematique off this album.  This band has weird ass moments where they get heavy as fuck outta nowhere, then get all soft and heavenly like in Soldier's Poem."
progmetal,3dambw,Greedo_Never_Shot,6,Tue Jul 14 20:09:14 2015 UTC,"First time I've seen Portnoy with anything other than a set of sticks in his hands - looked so weird to see him play bass!  Great video though, looks like a lot of fun, wish I had been there"

Gave it a spin, I've listened to it at least once a a week since. It got me into to all your other music too. Just wanted to say sorry for being an ass, I'm glad I changed my views.

progmetal,3d9msg,danjam11565,2,Wed Jul 15 02:01:33 2015 UTC,"Their last two albums Pale Communion and Heritage, and their 2003 album Damnation are anything but death metal and have no growling vocals at all. I think Pale Communion is a great place to start.  For their stuff that is death metal, Blackwater Park and Still Life are fantastic. A lot of these songs incorporate beautiful acoustic sections with clean vocals. Also, their metal instrumentals have no blast beats so I find them much more listenable."

progmetal,3d6syj,WarmerBeer,11,Thu Jul 16 01:26:49 2015 UTC,A list like any other but the focus seems too wide and yet too narrow. Consequently there's some very odd omissions:  -Motorpsycho & Stale Storlokken - Death Defying Unicorn  Probably the best reviewed prog rock album of this decade that's not from Steven Wilson. Really should have made the cut.  -Death and Atheist  How can you put Cynic on there and then leave those two out? Just doesn't make any sense.  -Progressive black metal does not exist  Maybe somebody should tell them?  -Complete absence of Swedish retro prog and British neo prog  How?  -Psychotic Waltz and Pain of Salvation are completely absent as well  Hard to take this seriously at this point. It certainly is nowhere near objective.

progmetal,3d6syj,Journeyman351,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:04:43 2015 UTC,"That album pushes no boundaries at all.  The instrumentation breaks up its foundation of unimaginative djent (very nearly a redundant phrase itself) with some doses of guitar technicality and your garden variety pop chorus straightforwardness.  The vocals bear striking resemblance in style and sound to those of Mutiny Within, with a whinier sound that makes it fail to match Chris Clancy's charisma (one of the few things that separates MW from the prog-metalcore pack).  Periphery doesn't offer anything new to any of these elements, nor does their synthesis of them offer anything new.  The album is basically a marriage of metalcore to djent that adds nothing significant to either half."
progmetal,3d6syj,moterola4,2,Tue Jul 14 03:16:03 2015 UTC,"Okay, I love both Periphery and AAL, but come on dude. BTBAM is so much more influential. They've been around longer, and are just as talented. Shit, I'm mad because Protest the fucking Hero didn't make it on the list at all."
progmetal,3d6syj,Journeyman351,8,Tue Jul 14 03:15:59 2015 UTC,"I mean, from what I know, most of those albums probably deserve to be there, not sure about the order.  The problem I think is the breadth of the genre, though.  There's bands in there where there's not a whole lot of use in comparing them.  The only thing that really stuck out to me was Riverside.  As much as I like SoNGS, I think they have 3 other albums that are all better choices."
progmetal,3d6syj,Bujjick,5,Tue Jul 14 03:34:36 2015 UTC,"Not a great list... not because anything on it isn't deserving of consideration, but because there's some really glaring omissions.   Shadow Gallery - Room V and/or Tyranny Kamelot - Haven Circus Maximus - Nine   I mean, end of the day, not having AT LEAST ONE album from Shadow Gallery on a top 50 prog album list is enough to invalidate the entire list for me (and I'd be saying that even if this was an all-time list).  You can argue position and what album(s), but they NEED to be on the list SOMEWHERE or it's simply not a valid list IMO.  They're too great to not be there.  About the best thing I can say for this list is their #1 pick is arguably perfect... certainly it was the prog album that really got me into the genre big-time so it'll always have a special place in my heart, but just objectively, it's easily top 5 and to say it's #1 isn't crazy at all.  And, they could have saved a lot of time by just saying ""all of Dream Theater's catalog and then a few other random albums"" and been done with it... that's basically what it seems to be anyway.  And yeah, I know, these lists are opinion, they can't be wrong per se... but come on, some are just not very good."
progmetal,3d6syj,fzammetti,3,Tue Jul 14 14:01:03 2015 UTC,"Interesting you included Haven, by Kamelot. I would not even put that in my top five Kamelot albums. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy it, but it just seems like they have become so formulaic at this point. Plus I wish they would let Tommy sing in his own style instead of making him imitate Khan."
progmetal,3d6syj,zzax,2,Wed Jul 15 01:43:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's certainly a matter of opinion... I feel like Kamelot has always been a little hit-or-miss for me... on any given album it's about 50/50 whether I like a given song or not... Haven is the first where I love every song and there's three that pretty much have forced their way into my top 10 list.  I can understand why you said what you said though... I guess maybe I prefer a little ""formula"" in my old age :)"
progmetal,3d6syj,fzammetti,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:00:34 2015 UTC,That was my complaint with Haven as well. I was willing to forgive it a bit with Silverthorn as I assumed the music was already written when Karevik joined. Let the man sing!

I could recommend many missing albums from Andromeda to Zero Hour, but the fact is most people don't have that much breadth to check out a comprehnsive list of prog metal bands. The creator mostly seemed to be in to mostly well-known bands with a special affinity for Portnoy and Morse."

No offence to Neal and Mike, they are giants in the genre and I enjoy most of their material, but they should not account for like 20 of the 50 albums.  That being said, there are solid arguments for inclusion for every album on this list, though I feel it's a bit lacking in the heavier side of prog.  Bands like Mercenary, The Contortionist, or TesseracT certainly warrant inclusion.  To me, however, the only glaring omissions are TesseracT's Altered State and the entirety of Arjen Anthony Lucassen's catalog.  edit: Also, how is Symphony X not on the list anywhere?"

progmetal,3d7q23,AsGoodAsDeader,1 point,Tue Jul 14 06:04:47 2015 UTC,I agree.  Rareform is a pretty killer album.  I like In Dreams a lot too.  Bread Crumbs and White Stones is my jam on that one
progmetal,3d7q23,TheDangerLevel,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:28:46 2015 UTC,"Rareform is one of my favorite albums ever, and I don't think In Dreams is (very) good, or particularly progressive.  It's where they started dropping some of the elements that made Rareform so good and different, and started sounding much more...like other bands I guess? I hate saying 'generic' but that's the easiest way for me to describe it.   Not trying to hate on your favorite album btw, I'm just venting my thoughts. Normally I'm all for bands developing on their sound, but all I've wanted from AtB is Rareform 2 for years now, and I don't think I'm ever going to get it :("
progmetal,3d7q23,TheDangerLevel,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:03:57 2015 UTC,"I understand where you're coming from. I discovered them through In Dreams and my god dude...do you know what that sounds like after only hearing post hardcore and metalcore? I listened to it every day all day for three weeks. For the time it came out, i dont think it was generic at all. I've yet to find another band that writes songs like that album, except MAYBE Reflections. But I still totally feel where youre coming from. It was, in a way, less technical. It focused more on rhythm than lead guitar...I like to see that album as an experiment in honing their Meshuggah worship. Your Troubles Will Cease was definitely something i never expected to hear. I didnt even know music could sound that crazy. Honestly, I dont think we'll get another rareform, but we might get some crazy combination of previous albums styles like WW had. I would enjoy more shredding very much."
progmetal,3d7q23,TheDangerLevel,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:23:41 2015 UTC,"Okay, I understand where you're coming from given the context. In that case, I'm sure In Dreams was awesome. I came at it from the other end, getting into AtB later after already exploring trad prog and dipping my feet into progressive metalcore. That's cool the album did that for you though."

Instead I was listening to Dream Theater, Symphony X, Liquid Tension, Opeth etc so I turned out this way."
progmetal,3d7q23,StonedEconomist16,2,Tue Jul 21 02:22:06 2015 UTC,To me they still haven't hit the same marks as that album had. Wolves within did a good job getting close though. The amount of shred in top of those complex rhythms just set the bar so high.
progmetal,3d7q23,StonedEconomist16,3,Tue Jul 14 09:04:41 2015 UTC,Yeah the intensity of Rareform is different than their other records to me.  That record always has and still does blow me away.  In Dreams was more experimental for them.  I have definitely jammed Wolves plenty but it doesn't stick with me like the others but I still dig it
progmetal,3d7q23,StonedEconomist16,8,Tue Jul 14 14:32:22 2015 UTC,"I don't mind the breakdowns. But their are songs like A Wolf Amongst Ravens where it's really just 0-0-0-0-0-0-00000-000.   But I still listen to it. As long as the rest of the cd is fueled with heavy riffs and intense song structure/writing.   So it can be hit or miss with progressive breakdowns, but I tend to like them."
progmetal,3d7q23,Kjata_,4,Tue Jul 14 06:19:07 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I dont get the hate that song got. It was a rhythm based song with some decently complex & effective groove and breakdowns. The solo was crazy, the vocal patterns were crazy. Some kid did the djent stick thing, and the metal community got ahold of it & everyone who's never heard prior material started shitting all over them. Maybe im just a fanboy."
progmetal,3d7q23,Masoo2,2,Tue Jul 14 06:22:37 2015 UTC,"No, see I can understand that. I love TRYING to follow the patterns in that song and the solo is good too. I haven't even thought about the vocal patterns you mentioned. It's a great way to end the cd. I don't hate the song but I just don't like when bands have an album based on '000-00-0000-00' for example the latest cd BOO came out with. I tried to like it but it was just too much open string for me."
progmetal,3d7q23,thefuckingswampking,3,Tue Jul 14 06:27:00 2015 UTC,"yeah dude, TWDA was BoO's worst album. It had a few really good songs, but most of it was pretty basic & repetitive. Im not even going to jump on the JASON IS GONE train, because BoO could write excellent music before The Discovery(Best album, prog metalcore masterpiece imo) and when he went to Chelsea Grin, they didnt even use him to HALF of his potential. You hear theyre going back to their older sound? Im excited for this next album"
progmetal,3d7q23,TheDangerLevel,2,Tue Jul 14 06:32:33 2015 UTC,Yeah I won't say anything about Jason cause I liked the albums they had before. I read or saw another comment about that return to their original sound. That's enough to get me to listen to them again.
progmetal,3d7q23,Lagerbottoms,2,Tue Jul 14 06:58:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah that fucking jerk off had to make that video with the djent stick and ruined it all.  In Dreams blew me away man.  They really put together some good material, but whenever ATB comes up with my friends it's always ""Wasn't that the band with the one string song...?""  But for the record, A Wolf Amongst Ravens IS a good song.  It might have a straight forward sound to it that this kid oversimplified, but it's really a song that gets me pumped.  Love how it picks up."

progmetal,3d7q23,Lagerbottoms,1 point,Tue Jul 14 07:57:30 2015 UTC,"I don't think the song is bad, it's just kind of boring. It's a (relatively speaking) simple song to pump people up live, similar to Tooth and Claw on TJoM. It's also their 'big song' off of WW and it got pushed pretty hard on the album release, and they play it at all their shows. Add in that stupid djent stick video and I can understand the lukewarm reception the song received. I'd much rather of had a track with a stronger personality take its place as the single, like Parise or Pennyweight, since I know it will be played at EVERY AtB performance."
progmetal,3d7q23,metagloria,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:17:38 2015 UTC,Parise is probably one of THE best songs they ever wrote. Its my favorite of the album.
progmetal,3d7q23,Lagerbottoms,5,Fri Jul 17 17:12:45 2015 UTC,"I used to listen to mostly Metalcore and Deathcore too. In 2012 I ventured away from those genres mostly and turned towards classical Death Metal, Tech Death, Prog, Mathcore, basically more sophisticated versions of the music I used to hear.  BTBAM's Telos has one of the greatest breakdowns in my opinion. It's around the 7:20 minute mark, but I put the song to 7:00 minutes for some build up :D  Dillinger's Room Full Of Eyes has a brilliant breakdown too.  Suffocation aren't really that proggy but are def one of my favorite Death Metal bands AND have some of the heaviest breakdowns. Just check out Bind Torture Kill. It's among their most popular tracks for a reason and it has plenty of dirty riffs, sick lyrics(sick as in insane), a nasty solo and some heavy breakdowns..."
progmetal,3d7q23,slickstriker45,3,Tue Jul 14 06:44:41 2015 UTC,"but I put the song to 7:00 minutes for some build up :D   /u/Lagerbottoms knows what it's all about.

I also havent really given Suffocation a good listen yet, but i shall.

progmetal,3d7q23,Ausderdose,2,Tue Jul 14 07:11:13 2015 UTC,"BTBAM was the first real prog band I tried and I instantly fell in love, but now I'm not such a big fan anymore. I do love Parallax and Colors and I will give coma ecliptic a few good listens and I will definitely try to see them live at some point, but there are more important bands for me... Like Dillinger :D  Option Paralysis is among my 5 favorite albums of all time. Each of their albums offers something unique and is masterpiece in itself.  I like Disfiguring The Goddess, especially the new stuff. But slam isn't much my thing in general. I'm more into groovy, proggy or techy death like spawn of possession, beyond creation, rivers of nihil, decapitated, augury, slice the cake, cattle decapitation, soreption, gojira, gorod, hybrid  My absolute favorite band by far is MESHUGGAH though.

Sooooooo many amazing bands in this great sub genre, the safety fire, the contortionist, skyharbor, tesserect, fallujah the list literally goes on.

Classics that are still absolutely unsurpassed in my opinion are awaken the dreamers of all shall perish, the red chords Fused together in revolving doors and ion dissonances minus the herd  Very creative and heavy Albums with phenomenal songwriting. Some new stuff like fit for an autopsy, infant annihilator and Carthage are good too, but I mostly enjoy the weirder stuff like safety fire, protest the hero, Meshuggah, rivers of nihil, secrets of the sky"

progmetal,3d7q23,I_Smell_Panties,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:15:41 2015 UTC,When I first heard their two singles rain eater and mechanical trees I didn't like any of them but when I heard soil and seed for the first time I was hooked. That massive groove and the black metal part surprised me.  When I checked out the other songs again I loved them too. I listened to it so often but yet so sparingly that it's become one of my favorite albums that I also enjoy a lot most of the times I listen to it
progmetal,3d7q23,nullfather,3,Thu Jul 16 16:12:16 2015 UTC,"IMO, progressive metal (or at least the bands you named) rarely really do a breakdown, but rather have a groove-riff (?). I don't know, a metalcore breakdown feels very different from a Tesseract or Periphery riff. For example, a metalcore song with a breakdown that was slightly more complicated wouldn't feel ""progressive"", and a really simple Tesseract riff in 4/4 wouldn't feel like a breakdown to me."
progmetal,3d6r30,Bujjick,2,Mon Jul 13 23:28:12 2015 UTC,"This album is an underrated gem, and one of my top five personal favorites. Can't decide whether this track, ""Golden Ratio,"" or ""Trading Dark Matter on the Stock Exchange"" is my favorite."
progmetal,3d6r30,jklingftm,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:10:18 2015 UTC,"This band has sorta been skirting on the edge of my view for a while.  I finally decided to give them a good listen and I'm really enjoying it.  This album's great, and some of their other material is really great too.  I think I've listened to the song ""UFOs"" off their self-titled album probably 20 times since I first heard it yesterday."
progmetal,3d6r30,jklingftm,2,Tue Jul 14 21:25:55 2015 UTC,"Funny you mention ""UFOs;"" it's probably my favorite on their debut along with ""Old Movies."" It just flows so well, and that lyrical part at the end after the distorted guitar bridge is nothing short of heavenly.   I sort of had the same experience with them as you did. Heard them a couple times on my last.fm Fair to Midland station, thought some of their stuff was okay, finally checked them out and was blown away by what I heard. Definitely one of my favorite finds."

It's like everyone else in the band grew up, but he didn't.  Either way though, I actually like how much their sound has changed.  Nobody in the band likes metal exclusively, and I think their wide range of influences really shows in their music.  Remission and Leviathan are still my favorites, though."

progmetal,3d5pmo,AsGoodAsDeader,13,Mon Jul 13 19:12:30 2015 UTC,I love going to shows alone. For me it's easier to let go of myself and enjoy the music if I don't know anyone there.
progmetal,3d5pmo,cjswitz,7,Mon Jul 13 19:53:15 2015 UTC,I did and still do. No regrets. Met a bunch of cool people like this but I can be a pretty big social butterfly when I'm alone.

progmetal,3d5pmo,metaldood,3,Mon Jul 13 20:34:37 2015 UTC,"I'll be honest, I went to a show by myself for the first time last week (AAL, Contortionist, BTBAM). Really didn't like it, although my personal anecdotal experience shouldn't dissuade you from doing it! Music was amazing, but I was frequently distracted with people brushing up against me, would constantly pat my pockets to make sure wallet/keys/phone were still there. I hate being in close proximity with a lot of strangers, more than a dozen or so overwhelms me a bit, so that's always my internal struggle battling my desire to see the music I love live. Luckily I can usually drag my wife along for support ;)"
progmetal,3d5pmo,Michael_Caine,3,Mon Jul 13 23:46:34 2015 UTC,"I've been to a few shows alone. It's a lot of fun actually. It's easy to make new friends as generally, we're a very open community. Plus whenever the band comes on, you would usually get split up from your friends in the crowd anyway"

progmetal,3d5pmo,Kw1q51lv3r,2,Tue Jul 14 00:51:35 2015 UTC,"I almost exclusively go alone.  Never had an issue, and usually end up meeting some cool people I wouldn't have otherwise."
progmetal,3d5pmo,Stabme,2,Tue Jul 14 01:17:28 2015 UTC,"Definitely go on your own if you must. I've been going to shows alone since I was in high school and if I had to guess I'd say about 60-70% of the shows I've ever been to I ended up going on my own.  I have a good handful of friends (and bandmates) that have the same/similar music tastes as me, but it often seems like I'm one of the only ones that can be bothered to spend money to actually go out and see a live show. Everyone is always on-board until the day of the show starts approaching and then slowly people start having other things they'd rather do come up and the group ends up being two people, or just me.   It will be mega-fun regardless of who is with you. The experience that these kind of events bring is not one to miss out on just because no one is attending with you."
progmetal,3d5pmo,TiimeKeeper,2,Tue Jul 14 01:31:15 2015 UTC,"Same boat as you OP, and when they can't make it and it's a can't-miss show, I'm still fucking going. For example, if my friends couldn't make it to the upcoming BTBAM tour, I would go anyway. The lineup is retarded and I wouldn't miss it just because people can't go with me.  Honestly, I'm the type of person who won't miss experiences just because I can't share them with others. No one could make it out to Cali with me this spring break. Still went anyway. Had a fantastic time. Enjoy yourself :)"
progmetal,3d5pmo,Journeyman351,2,Tue Jul 14 14:05:50 2015 UTC,I do. I usually lean against the bar and end up talking to a few people and make some friends. Very frequently talk to bands too. I enjoy the atmosphere and energy.

But lacking friends having the same taste (and certainly not my wife!), that's about all the opportunity I have.  Somewhat of a tangent, but... it also annoys me that so many music apps put an emphasis on social aspects. But when your tastes range into uncommon territory, these apps become more annoying than useful."

progmetal,3d1btw,christophalese,26,Sun Jul 12 18:31:15 2015 UTC,Yeah this song got that riff.    You know what riff I'm talking about.  That really heavy part that sounds kinda egyptian and Tommy is just belting it out in the background then it ends the riff by being really fucking proggy.    I heard that part and had a fucking seizure.
progmetal,3d1btw,Kjata_,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:29:33 2015 UTC,"I honestly think Deafheaven inspired that riff...which is awesome, of course!"
progmetal,3d1btw,Harmonomicon,15,Mon Jul 13 14:44:00 2015 UTC,Dim Ignition got me hooked.  TOO BAD ITS THE SHORTEST FUCKING SONG.
progmetal,3d1btw,douchequadbike,5,Mon Jul 13 05:19:24 2015 UTC,The transition from dim ignition into famine wolf gave me chills. I literally cant stop listening to this album
progmetal,3d1btw,mighty_the_freak,3,Tue Jul 14 08:26:07 2015 UTC,I know right? It's so catchy though. The synth sound is incredible.
progmetal,3d1btw,JediDachshund,3,Mon Jul 13 10:51:32 2015 UTC,Same here.  It's like BtBaM meets Daft Punk.  BtBaM should do the next Tron soundtrack.
progmetal,3d1btw,offworld92,13,Tue Jul 14 01:00:18 2015 UTC,My favorite is Ectopic Stroll. That groove and the vocals are bitchin'.
progmetal,3d1btw,shit_whistle,7,Sun Jul 12 22:32:31 2015 UTC,The ectopic stroll is the bloom of this album. I fucking love it.
progmetal,3d1btw,j4cc3b,2,Mon Jul 13 03:39:34 2015 UTC,Fuck yeah
progmetal,3d1btw,inadim,4,Mon Jul 13 00:53:11 2015 UTC,"I love that Tommy is branching out on this album to really facilitate a ""concept."" His synth work is outside the box of BTBAM as well. I'm more excited for the next album."
progmetal,3d1btw,shit_whistle,2,Mon Jul 13 02:53:35 2015 UTC,I want to see the cast of Always Sunny perform this
progmetal,3d1btw,ubernoodle,8,Wed Jul 15 02:13:25 2015 UTC,Love the opening to this so much.
progmetal,3d1btw,offworld92,3,Sun Jul 12 20:08:48 2015 UTC,Same here.  That intense sound from the 1:50-2:00 minute mark sold me so hard.  It goes from down tempo to epic to hard in 20 seconds.
progmetal,3d1btw,The-Spaceman,8,Sun Jul 12 23:57:01 2015 UTC,This song to the end of the album is perfection in my opinion. Life in Velvet is literally my favorite song of all time right now.
progmetal,3d1btw,Nagajimmyrussle,8,Sun Jul 12 18:37:02 2015 UTC,"I'm really struggling to find a favorite, I just love how diverse Tommy's vocals are on this album, so fucking strange.  Anything really wonky and weird is really cool sounding to me and this album is that all over it.   I'm curious what the velvet imagery represents in the overall concept cause I've noticed it mentioned a few times throughout the record, any ideas?"
progmetal,3d1btw,MOSh_EISLEY,4,Sun Jul 12 18:41:43 2015 UTC,"Gold/velvet is life/death, confirmed on twitter"
progmetal,3d1btw,bigavz,3,Sun Jul 12 18:55:49 2015 UTC,Sounds like Blake got new cymbals.
progmetal,3d1btw,Frontline901,2,Sun Jul 12 22:51:20 2015 UTC,"""Symphony through my ears Clarity is not known""   When i heard that part during The Making Of promo, not knowing it was this song at the time, i knew id like this song. Now its my favorite from the album."
progmetal,3d1btw,ValkyrSaber,2,Sun Jul 12 20:54:21 2015 UTC,"I dunno, I've been struggling to get into this album. I find the vocals seem a bit forced to the rest of the composition...at times, the cleans almost feel robotic. Kinda like each instrument was written separately, then they stuck what worked together with no natural flow.  When parallax 2 came out it took me a long time to get into that too, so I'm not writing this one off just yet. Hopefully it's a grower, and I change my mind on the thought that they peaked with great misdirect!"
progmetal,3d1btw,Capn_Barboza,1 point,Mon Jul 13 08:53:44 2015 UTC,I'm definitely catching a heavy Sleepytime Gorilla Museum influence in this album and I love it!

progmetal,3d5eb7,Abarisol,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:39:24 2015 UTC,"Progressive music from Norway usually means quality, and Defect Designer are no exception (although the band is originally from Russia). Their new album just came out and it's pretty good despite the short length of only 37 minutes.  It starts out not unlike your usual progressive death metal but then it gets progressively weirder and then you have this song and... is this a Nights In White Satin quote at the end?!"
progmetal,3d1prb,OZONE_TempuS,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:24:44 2015 UTC,"That bass intro, holy smokes!!!"
progmetal,3d1prb,HelloMyNameIsRuben,3,Mon Jul 13 06:52:51 2015 UTC,"The Sea of Lies bass intro is just as awesome, but the tone on Domination is just perfect!"
progmetal,3d1prb,zxjams,1 point,Mon Jul 13 10:36:51 2015 UTC,"I can't send any links for now, but a couple off the top of my head are:   Out of the Ashes, with a couple of cool syncopated parts in the 2nd half. The Divine Wings of Tragedy has some awesome dueling sections if I remember correctly. Seven has a cool tapping section in the 2nd half.   Also, you might be right about the tone getting drowned out, but at least on Paradise Lost it sounds like Lepond is often doubling Romeo's background parts, so the sound gets lost under the guitar tone. I have a legitimately hard time hearing the bass on the Divine Wings of Tragedy album though - the tone sounds a lot weaker to me. It's much easier to hear on The Odyssey (check the intro to the title track! No solos but a few cool bass runs), my favorite album of theirs, but I don't like the mix quite as much - especially the drums."

Liked the ambience =) I agree with /u/H3terotr0n that the low end is missing a little oomph. You should x-post this over to /r/audioengineering for feedback.
