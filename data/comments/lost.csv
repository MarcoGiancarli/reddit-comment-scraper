The MIB just can't go past that barrier. Alternatively, that was a projection of the island rather than the MIB.  2) Watch the epilogue that /u/charizard77 posted.  3) Yeah, DHARMA built the Barracks on top of that location, so it's pretty safe to assume that DHARMA found the secret room before they built the Barracks.  4) It was mostly selfish reasons. Ben wanted to return to the island and become the Others' leader again, but he knew he couldn't do that if he brought Locke back to the island with him because the Others would just have Locke be their leader. However, it is also true that Ajira 316 had to mimic Flight 815 as much as possible, so if Ben knew about that, he may have realized that having a corpse on the plane would give them a better chance of returning to the island without suffering side effects, and he decided to make Locke be that corpse.  5) Jack was never on Jacob's list. Jacob's list is a list he gave to Richard of all the survivors from Flight 815 that he thought would be good Others. Walt was on the list. Zach, Emma, and Cindy from the tail section were on the list. But none of the candidates were on the list."

There is a scene where MiB says he prefers to walk as he likes the feeling if his feet on the ground and it reminds me of when he was human.   I'm personally of the belief that freighter Christian was a manifestation of the island since it was made clear to us earlier that the island wasn't letting Michael kill himself.

I don't believe that was MiB but just an apparition that Michael could see.  For other losties, just before death they glimpsed into the FS, Michael seeing Christian was his entrance in being stuck on the island as a lost soul. Watch the new man in charge that charizad77 has posted. I don't like the fact the Ben could summon the monster (or it summoning him as he later stated). Only Ben knew this as the leader of the others, but the reason I don't like it is because it turned out Ben knew very little. How can he know this but know very little of the temple for example. He killed John for his own selfish reasons.  John was special and Ben had got ill on the island.  He saw John as a threat and was jealous of him.  He got the information he needed regarding the whereabouts of Elouise and killed him so he could return to the island and resume his leadership roles. The first list was not a list of candidates, but those who would make good others.  I don't think it was Jacob's list, rather Ben's list.  Ben was a liar and probably told everyone it was Jacob's list so it would carry more weight.  Ben never met Jacob and even Richard didn't know about the candidates. Your English is just fine."

And he was willing to do that. They could all die, or he could sacrifice himself to save the rest. (albeit not ultimately Jin and Sun). When Jack said 'There is no Sayid!', he only meant that he knew Sayid was gone, and there was no chance of saving him, 'cos a bomb just blew up in his face.

Everything from Jack's eye opening to Jack's eye closing on the island was real, with the exception of the sideways world in season 6. That was purgatory.  So if you think of the timeline as linear, everyone died at some point along the line. Some people (those who got off the island, those who stayed like Hurley and Ben) didn't die on the show, but we can assume they died later, because everyone, regardless of when they died, shows up in purgatory (aka sideways world). They then have to reconnect and remember what happened when they were alive so that they can all move on to the afterlife together.  Hope that clears it up a little bit! Part of the confusion for me personally came from the characters themselves theorizing about where they were despite not knowing. Richard, for example, in season 6 says they are all in hell, but we have to realize he doesn't know any better than we do."

The flash sideways was a purgatory, a place they all subconsciously built together so that they could find one another after they all died, and move on together. As Christian put it, the most important part of all of their lives was the time they spent together on the island.  ""This is a place that you... that you all made together so that you could find one another. The most important part of your life was the time that you spent with these people on that island. That's why all of you are here. Nobody does it alone, Jack. You needed all of them, and they needed you.""

You would probably like Carinval, which is a fantasy type show about a dust bowl traveling carnival.  Very Eerie and supernatural.  only 2 seasons as it got cut due to budget.  Season 2 is phenominal. Great characters and story combined.  season 1 of heroes is another show with a cool story and good characters.  I would maybe watch season 2, and then stop, it gets terrible.

This should not have come as a surprise to viewers not highly already invested in a Charlie/Claire ship.  The show foreshadows the ultimate outcome by Claire not getting Charlie's ring: we even have a camera shot focusing in on the ring left abandoned in Aaron's crib.  In further follow-up, look at the conversation between Claire, Rose and Sun at the radio tower, when Rose jokes about ""treating your man real good:"" if you carefully watch the scene, Sun laughs, but Claire isn't amused, and doesn't.   It's further followed up with Claire not acting disturbed or missing Charlie during her time at the Barracks with Locke's group.  As a matter of fact, Claire never mentions Charlie again in the main timeline, ever, after her conversation with Locke in the Barracks in Season 4, where Locke mentions Charlie as a way to manipulate Claire into not bugging Locke about the treatment of Miles.  The final blow is delivered when Sun actually takes Charlie's ring, but is never shown giving it to Claire.  The ring supposedly goes to the bottom with Sun."
lost,3doe6c,theverybest27,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:05:57 2015 UTC,Claire was distraught that Charlie died! You can tell it affected her deeply. She also clearly loved him but was scared being left again by an apparently unreliable man. I can see why she was weary despite her feelings for him.  Though there is the slight issue of Emilie De Ravin not being the most believable of actresses so maybe that's what's causing your disconnection to their relationship.    Edit: also of note is how great Jorge Garcia is at portraying emotions.
lost,3doe6c,theverybest27,3,Fri Jul 17 23:11:09 2015 UTC,"I don't mean disrespect, but Claire did not seem very upset to me.  I don't even recall her mentioning him in the final season when she was on the island.  When she went with Locke and Sawyer, she seemed fine hanging laundry to dry.  She didn't seem like she was grieving over a man that she loved.  I think Charlie was obsessed with her, but it didn't seem reciprocated to me."

Claire had to survive, nobody had any time to grieve for any death. They weren't afforded that luxury. They had pressing matters to concern themselves with that meant life or death for the remaining Losties.  You see the pain in her face when Hurley breaks the news of Charlie's death and she also calls out for him when she is nearly blown to pieces, why would she do that if she didn't hope he was the one there saving her? And why would she hope that if she didnt love him? Claire and Charlie's love is subtle but also very apparent if you take the time to look.  Edit: also Claire went a bit insane towards the end and rightfully only cared about getting her child back. I'm sure her love for Aaron outweighed her love for Charlie (again rightfully so) causing her to think only of finding her child. I see no reason for her to mention Charlie in season six or how that correlates to how much she loved him"

She really isn't the best at portraying emotions, while Michael Fox and Jorge Garcia are phenomenal at it. Claire (and Belle too) looks blank at most times she should be full of life or emotion. She isn't terrible at acting but in no way holds a candle to the other great actors and actresses on the show. She also has the unfortunate knack of having the majority of her important scenes shared with actors/actresses whose characters (and acting) outshine Claire in the moment (Aaron's birth being a prime example) which certainly doesn't help matters."

If Claire looks emotionally blank about Charlie at various times, Occam's Razor suggests that it's because the directors have told her to do so.

Soulmates simply means two people are meant to be together forever, in Sun and Jin's case this happened in both life (though with it's hardships) and death, while Claire and Charlie's time together was cut unfairly short. Their relationship was never given a chance to flourish while alive but because they were soulmates they found eachother in death.

The tail section crash was just an hour run from the barracks, probably even shorter considering how fast Goodwin managed to get there, but the fuselage was a long way from the barracks. Distances have varied quite a bit on the show, but the barracks have been at least a day and a half walk from the camp (as said by Kate in ""Ji Yeon"". They spent longer time going there in season 3, but that was their first time there). Goodwin was so fast that he managed to give a list to The Others that very same day, so they attacked the tailies the first night taking the strong people. Ethan was probably still on his way to the fuselage campsite. His first appearance is on day 4 with Jack in the mobisode where they discuss Claire's pregnancy. At some point he must've returned with a list of people, probably also learning that they lost two men at the tail section attack, so kidnapping the strong ones seemed like a bad idea if more deaths would happen. And Ethan's list must've included Claire, which gained a lot of interest by Ben and Juliet, and also Walt. So they had different priorities with the fuselage survivors.

They just lost all the high points they thought they had and now Jack, Kate, and Sawyer are behaving in ways that they normally wouldn't because they're at the end of their ropes.

It didn't make me hate the Others, more humanized them since Ben's only doing this because he's dying of cancer and wants to save himself, and Juliet doesn't want to be there/wants Jack to let Ben die. Pickett's kind of obnoxious but he gets rekt pretty quickly, and he's also sympathetic since he lost his wife.  My complaints would be the outcome of the Hatch implosion since Locke's mutenesss and Eko being dragged off are kind of bizarre. Nikki and Paulo obviously are annoying in the first 6 eps though I do love Expose.

I don't mind that we don't get an answer for every question/mystery, because I thought it related to how we never get all the answers in life.  I’m even one of those people who got drawn into the show because of the mysteries in the first place, and still ended up caring more about the characters and their relationships with each other by the end.  Wait, what is that!?!  To care more about the people you love/share experiences with than the experiences themselves.  Wow that sounds a lot like life doesn’t it.  That’s just my way of looking at Lost and it’s why I’m so fond of it.  Anyways, I've watched several other shows that are often praised for being among the best and in not a single one of them (so far) did I care about the characters or story nearly as much as Lost.  I’ll humor you a bit with some opinions (WARNING I'm going to dis some shows that a lot of people love).  Breaking Bad...cool plot with some badass moments.  Walt was amazing of course, and the story was tight but ultimately this show just rubbed me the wrong way.  I hated most of the characters (even Walt at many times) and watched mostly to see the story unfold, but with a detached sort of interest.  I also have no desire to revisit any of this show again.  Sopranos...excellent writing, some of the snappiest dialogue on a TV show, and intense acting.  Yet, somehow despite the superb performances and writing I still didn't give a shit about the characters or their predicaments.  I actually found seasons 1-4 rather predictable and sometimes boring.  Definitely picked up towards the end.  Again, I watched this with a sort of bemused detachment the way I watched BB.  Dexter...gripping, suspenseful first few seasons then got ridiculous to the point that I stopped watching.  Twin Peaks...everyone (ok well mostly hipsters who watched the show 20 years after it was on) worships Lynch like anything he remotely touches is pure genius.  3-4 great episodes and some nice eye candy do not a great show make.  X-Files…I really liked this actually, in that it handled the sci-fi/mystery/conspiracy thing so well, but the main story-arc is so spread out that its hard to get as invested in as some of the more tightly-constructed modern shows.  Compared to Lost….  Totally immersed, edge of my seat during most of the show, even on a re-watch.  Oh and I found something to respect and care about in practically every character.  Also, I found that parts of the story and its themes resonated with me in a way that no other show has yet to do.  These are just my (probably unpopular) opinions and I know I have many more shows to watch (next up for me is The Wire), but I’m beginning to doubt I will encounter something as engrossing and rewarding as Lost."

Walt is a likeable character with no money whose family loves him in the beginning. In the end everyone hates him but he has money. I like how it reflected the important things in life. Just my two cents

Breaking Bad had spectacular characters and an original story but not much of a world for it to take place in. Lost had all three: a story, characters, and this massive mysterious world for them to interact in, expanding every season into something more amazing. That's why LOST will always be my favorite show."

Just comparing how some shows are good at some more than others. Personally I enjoy Arrow's adaptation of comic book characters. But I agree, Laurel Lance is pretty bad.

lost,3djclo,Alvonzo,3,Fri Jul 17 01:22:16 2015 UTC,i liked the flash sideways parts - just thought it was ridiculous that they were introducing so many new characters when they still weren't answering old mysteries... only to then just kill off those characters a few episodes later.
lost,3djclo,dj_soo,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:25:47 2015 UTC,"Wow, this is so interesting to me because I'm the complete opposite. Season 6 was one of the first times since Season 1 that I thought the island stuff was waaay more interesting than the flash sideways.  In fairness, I liked some of the flash sideways (particularly Jack, Sawyer, and Desmond), but finding out that they were more or less irrelevant was what deterred my interest... and because Kate helping Claire give birth again seemed like a waste of my time.  EDIT: In fairness, most of Kate's flash-anything never did anything for me.

That's some strong hyperbole. I honestly don't think ""the greatest show of all time"" is really a thing. Every quality show that comes down the line builds from the quality of previous shows. But, if you want to make the GOAT argument, I still have to go with what I said in another post that made the same claim you did. If it wasn't for The Wire we wouldn't have shows like Lost, The Sopranos, and Breaking Bad. The Wire was one of, if not the first, drama that didn't treat the viewer like a mouth-breathing moron. David Simon and HBO took a risk that the ""average TV viewer"" was able to follow deep, complex, and long-running story lines and follow, and even like, characters that had deep flaws. When a critical shootout in Season 4, episode 13 made a deep reference to what some considered to be a ""throwaway"" scene from Season 1, episode 2, my mind was blown. For those that have never seen it, try to watch The Wire and I think you'll see how it created the decade of incredibly good TV we have been seeing."

I've traveled to Hawaii twice just for this show and have watched it through 8 times in full and have seen some episodes more than 50 times.  That said, you are coming off very childish.  First of all, it's sequence of events. Not sequel of events.  Second of all, these mysteries that opened up in season 1 and we're answered in seasons 5 and 6, they weren't planned from the start. The creators will be the first to tell you they didn't have it all mapped from the start and they filled in blanks best they could.  Finally, I respect your opinion and like I said it's my personal favorite show, but simply put there are many, many better made shows than Lost.  Countless cable and paid subscription shows just have an infinitely higher productuction value.

Jack and Juliet needed to fix someone and Kate and Sawyer needed to be fixed.

They were two Yins and their relationship was based on passion and shared experiences of being bad and outsiders.  Sawyer and Juliet goes with his character development arc.  He matured where he could have a proper relationship.  He was accepted for who he was and Juliet was the one for the new Sawyer."
lost,3dfg16,pascalspants,5,Wed Jul 15 21:31:30 2015 UTC,"From my experience, the relationships with longevity tend to be those that are tempered and balanced.  Usually, hot and passionate sizzles out because it is not sustainable.  And new always gets old.  So once the basis of a relationship like Sawyer and Kate's fizzles, they are left with their incompatibility.    Juliet and Sawyer were passion and partnership.  Sawyer respected Juliet in a way, he never did with Kate.  I think it was because he knew the sides of Kate that he did not respect, because he hated it in himself.  In Juliet's reflection, he got to redefine himself.    Jack and Kate had a similar dynamic.  And when Jack thought Kate loved Sawyer and he let her go to be with Sawyer, that was a significant behavior change for him.  Jack defended Sawyer because he loved Kate.  Unlike his marriage where he kept trying to force, fix it and make it work, Jack made the conscious choice to not try to force Kate to feel for him.  And it turns out that it worked, by setting Kate free (and forgoing his instincts), he actually wins her love.    Which is really the right approach to use with a girl like Kate that has an instinct to run and not be tied down.    And, superficially, it's damn cute that the conning criminals fall in love with the nerd doctors.  The more I think about it, the writers were actually genius."

Sawyer ended up with Juliet because the writers wanted to see if it would work because otherwise he would be alone.  And it turned out that Sawyer and Juliet had mad chemistry too and the audience loved them together.    It's evident from the storytelling that Kate is more in love with Jack than she is with Sawyer."

When Jack was in the cave in Charlie told Sawyer to tell Kate about it and he got her to come along with him in the jungle to keep them apart, everyone knew Jack and Kate had feeling for each other. Sawyer is just a jackass and wants to piss off everyone he can. Juliet had called him out on his shit, he couldn't piss her off like he did with everyone else. The first insistent of there budding fondness for each other can be seen when Sawyer asked, ""So, you screwing Jack yet?"" and she responds ""No, are you?"" They both smile.

Plus it would be a real shit thing to do to Juliet's honor.    And it would be inconsistent with Kate's poignant ""I missed you so much"" to Jack.  Sawyer and Kate were just not that kind of couple.

lost,3dfg16,pascalspants,1 point,Thu Jul 16 05:35:57 2015 UTC,"When Sawyer and Kate left the Island, they presumably had many years to live.  They were both alive.  A lot could happen.  Both their partners were dead.  And they weren't the same people as (say) in Seasons 1 and 2.    Sawyer had been maturing and mellowing ever since Hugo ""conned him into being nice.""  In the 1970s, he took on huge responsibilities and finally became part of a community, as well as living with Juliet.  Kate had been tempered by responsibility, too, in caring for Aaron.  One can argue that she shouldn't have done that, but on a day to day basis, she seemed to be a good mother to Aaron (evidenced by him being sweet, kind, gentle etc as she tells Claire in Season 6.)    Finally, both of them have been tried by fire in their approximately three weeks on-Island after they return.  Both of them have someone to mourn, and responsibilities in their post-Ajira lives.  I don't see any reason why they couldn't live some of it as a couple.  Not at first, of course: they're both in mourning.  But eventually, maybe.  As far as the FSW goes, I don't interpret it to mean that no one ever had any other relationships after the events of ""The End.""  No matter who got paired up with who in the church, it makes no sense to me that Kate, Sawyer, Claire, Hugo, and others never, ever had another relationship in their lives."

lost,3dd4at,Ceceboy,30,Wed Jul 15 09:36:05 2015 UTC,"Christian, by himself, isn't any more important than any of the other ""bad dads"" on LOST really. He served the plot to create the issues that Jack would then have to confront and resolve on the Island.  His presence, if you will, on the Island is very significant. I subscribe to the theory that Christian-in-suit is the Island, and Christian-in-shirt is the Man in Black. Both were used to manipulate characters, particularly Jack, to their own ends.  Christian's greatest importance in the story may be the Flash-Sideways, where his death is the catalyst for everything that happens. Jack's entire narrative in the FS is based on his search for his father's body. That the series finale opens with Christian's casket being delivered to the church, and ends with Christian's conversation with Jack about the true nature of the FS, shows the writers' intent to make Christian the focal point of Jack's journey."
lost,3dd4at,PepsiPerfect,8,Wed Jul 15 12:49:01 2015 UTC,"This answer is great. I will also add this fact to the OP.  Damon Lindelof revealed in an interview in the NY Times last year about how Christian and Jack were written in the show.  Damon's father  (who was named David, like Hurley's ""Dave"", Libby's husband and Hurley's dad) was a strict atheist banker contrary to his Jewish outgoing schoolteacher-wife. He was distant, often residing in the attic for work. His father’s philosophy, Damon recalled, was: “I can love my son. I can hang out with my son. I can share things with my son. But I’m not going to tell my son that I’m proud of him or that he can do anything that he wants because those things are not necessarily true. He never said to me, ‘You don’t have what it takes.’ That was just my deduction based on not being told that I had what it takes.”  Not long before Damon started on Lost, his father died. Part of what affected Lindelof so deeply about “Lost” is that he created the show in his own image. Jack, the show’s hero, became an avatar for Lindelof, at least in Lindelof’s mind: a man who had just lost his father, who had been given the burden of leadership that he didn’t feel ready or willing to handle. Christian is more than just Jack's father. He might be the most important piece when it came to Damon's writing on the show. One of the most important characters on the show.  http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/01/magazine/damon-lindelof-leftovers-lost.html"

I imagine the situation in the writers room was basically     ""Hey guys, what should Sun contribute to this episode? I was going to make her jump in with a 'Have you seen my husband?' but then I realized I already used that one like 7 times last year without even realizing, whoops!"" ""I can't think of anything either. Fuck it, just have her bump her head and forget how to speak English for the next few episodes until she meets Jin again.

This is how I think would better the situation:  In the season 4 finale we see her take control over her father's business, Paik Heavy Industries. It's a cool and confident Sun we see, something the writers also found interesting in the audio commentary for that finale. But then they go two steps back with her character. She winds up in The Lamp Post station and goes back to the island.   She should've stayed back in the real world. It would give us more reasons to still show some stories there (Desmond and Penny, and of course Mrs. Hawking and Widmore). Then use the island stories to further develop the new characters, like Ilana. Instead of Frank, Ben and Sun going to the barracks, it would be much interesting with Frank, Ben and Ilana. Imagine the dialogues between them, the exchanges of information, the development of these characters.   But what about Sun? She comes back to The Island on Widmore's team in the sub in season 6. It wouldn't harm the story at all. She gets cold feet because of the experiments on Desmond, learns that Jin is alive and they are reunited."

At the time I thought it was her flash-sideways-counterpart blending into the real world Sun (since it happened when she was unconcscious, which I also thought was a reveal), but anyway, it wasn't that. I wasn't a big fan of that storyline for Sun.  The Island has a way of taking things from our characters, until they accomplish something. John had the same thing (he also needed a notepad to communicate) in ""Further Instructions"", and wasn't able to say something after he talked to the island in that sweat lodge."

Revelations in this book includes the location of Penny's tracking station from season 2's finale, where Jin learned tae kwon do, who killed Felix in ""Some Like it Hoth"", why did the smoke monster kill the pilot, where Geronimo Jackson recorded ""Dharma lady"", who wrote Quarantine on the door to The Arrow, what happened to Annie from Ben's flashback, where was Dr. Arzt teacher, who built the lighthouse, why didn't Mrs. Hawking name Daniel for Widmore or Hawking, what was the last DHARMA-field they studied that was cut of in the orientation tape ""utopian socia--"" and stuff like that.  The biggest ""reveals"" were just additional information, most of them could be glued together from the show (like the additional info on the cabin).   What I found the most interesting was that the book gave you a rundown of Ethan's life after his birth and before we met him. Some new info there.

The most controversial ""new revelation"" that was written in the book and talked about by the fans was the identity to who killed the Ajira passengers.

There's tons of picture of the props that you didn't see that close up in the show, that I was glad to see. (like the note from the ankh in the season 6 premiere).

The complete collection, the season 6 dvd, Michael Giacchino's season 6 soundtrack (even his ""The Last Episodes""-soundtrack was due before the encyclopedia). This caused the book not to have a complete spellcheck, so there are some issues with grammar every now and then, and some inconsistencies in dates/info from the show. You can find more (and thorough) info on Lostpedia     I like the book. It's nice to skim through. Good to have something physical, and if it's on sale I'd buy it."
lost,3d875n,PepsiPerfect,2,Tue Jul 14 18:57:11 2015 UTC,"I had MAJOR issues with the LOST Encyclopedia. For one thing, there were basic grammatical and even spelling errors in the book, presumably because it was rushed out. I don't know if there were later editions or if the errors were fixed in said editions.  The whole thing came across like a coffee table book more than a true encyclopedia to the show. My personal basis for comparison was the Star Trek Encyclopedia, which was actually written like an encyclopedia and was much more comprehensive. That was my expectation and the book failed to deliver.  If you are looking for a pretty book to browse that has some nice color photos and pictures of set props up close, you will probably like the LOST Encyclopedia. If you are looking for a comprehensive database of information that is well-organized and written to provoke insights into the show, you'll be disappointed.   Simply put, there is nothing in the LOST Encyclopedia that isn't done better on LOSTpedia."

I can see where it would have been great to be watching weekly as it first aired, so you could talk with friends about what's going to happen next week or whatever, but that's not going to happen now.  The thing about binge watching that's good - if there's a weak episode or two you are not as likely to get irritated or put off the show, because you just instantly watch the next one and keep going to the good ones.

It seems more like something your soul or whatever subconsciously creates to wait for the right people to move on with, it's not a deliberate group effort. Really though that's just how I imagine it, the writers very purposely left it up to interpretation so people can believe what makes them happy, they pretty much say as much in the finale script; maybe at some post-death-pre-purgatory they really were sitting around planning what they wanted that place to be like (though they didn't all have the best lives, it seems like some of them wouldn't purposely choose that).  Besides that, however, when you say ""This line makes me think that this place was created by their actions, instead of being a place they would have gone to anyway when they died"", I don't think the two are exactly mutually exclusive. Elsewhere in that conversation, Christian says ""No one does it alone,"" which implies it's not something that's happening just to the Losties; it's probably something just about everyone does and is just how the afterlife works in that universe. Every group of people who were important to each other ends up in their own version of the flash-sideways, it's not something unique to our characters because of their actions/experiences."
lost,3d5m5x,339970,3,Mon Jul 13 21:27:17 2015 UTC,"My interpretation is that Christian is referring to this particular part of the flash-sideways world. It exists for everyone (which is why Yemi, Eko, and Charlotte Malkin experience their own version of the flash-sideways that is unconnected to the Flight 815's flash-sideways), but when a group of people want to find each other so that they can move on together, they create their own pocket space within the flash-sideways that manipulates the flash-sideways world as a whole to accommodate their pocket space and thus allow them to move on together (because they would be unable to move on alone)."

lost,3d2vfp,-KingSlayer-,9,Mon Jul 13 02:16:36 2015 UTC,"he only became smokie when he was thrown into the light cave (also unexplained).   That wasn't really unexplained. We were told in a couple of episodes during Season 6 that the light is a giant pocket of electromagnetism and exotic matter. Season 2 already told us that 1) being exposed to electromagnetic radiation could normally kill a person, and 2) electromagnetism is able to ""download"", for lack of a better word, the memories of those nearby pockets of electromagnetism. The episode where the Man in Black was transformed into the smoke monster also told us that the light wouldn't kill someone who went into it. So the conclusion we're supposed to draw is that the electromagnetic radiation from the source killed the MiB's body but preserved his memory/consciousness. The MIB's mind was essentially torn from his body and fused with the source, giving him control over the island's electromagnetism, and with those new abilities he was able to build a new body for himself which looked like black smoke.   With Jacobs set of powers he could have changed or prevented this.   This is unlikely. Jacob didn't realize what would happen to the MIB being thrown into the light until after it had already happened. And once that happened and the MIB was fused to the light, Jacob couldn't let the MIB leave the island because if he did the MIB and the light would both have to leave the island since the two are connected, and we were told in Season 6 that if anyone ever tried to remove the light from the island, the light would extinguish on the island and everywhere else around the world, leading to great ecological disaster at the very least.  The most Jacob could have possibly done was remove the MIB's mind from the light, but since the MIB had no living body to go to, that would have just killed him if Jacob was even able to do it. (This solution might have been beyond Jacob's power.)   For someone who is the representation of goodness he doesn't seem to take issue with allowing/commanding Ben and Richard to murder the Dharma Initiative.   It's implied that Jacob didn't actually command Widmore to murder the DI. Widmore later says that he spoke to Jacob for the first time when Locke appears to him off-island, so it seems Widmore was either lying about having received the command from Jacob (like Ben would later do) or Widmore was actually unknowingly taking directions from the MIB pretending to be Jacob (as Locke would later do).   Walt appears to have some kind of power but was sort of forgotten.   Watch the epilogue for more on Walt. But Walt's powers were no different than Hurley's, Miles's, or the MIB's natural powers at least as far as origin goes. They're all special people who are able to tap into the electromagnetism that exists inside of them. Walt was just meant to introduce this concept.   The cork in the light cave. Yeah.   Note that it was covered in Egyptian hieroglyphics (just like the frozen donkey wheel chamber and the drawing inside the Temple wall depicting the monster and Anubis facing one another). Also note that when we see the light in Across the Sea, it is much brighter than when we see it in The End. Clearly the MIB managed to get under the Egyptians' skin and start influencing them, leading to the event that caused the light to begin to fade until the Egyptians managed to create the ""cork"" which would then stop the light from fading out altogether.   The time travel event with Juliet. It just didn't work? And the Dharma Initiative just rebuilt around the explosion?   Yeah, more or less. Sayid even mentioned in Season 2 that DHARMA had poured concrete over the whole area as if there had been some nuclear explosion there. It was an event in the past that they had always participated in, so they had to fulfill those events and make sure they actually happened."

I hated it coz I'd watched since the begining, I'd listened to people say the show was about the afterlife or people suggest the hatch was a space ship or people talk about dinosaurs and everytime someone would make a ridiculous suggestion we got told by Abrhams or Cuse or Lindeloff that this was NOT a science fiction show, it was a drama about real people and everything had scientific theory behind it.  Ok, I thought, I buy that, lets go!  And I loved the amazing journey, I loved the flashbacks, the shocks when we realised that one was a fast forward, the scottish bloke living in the hatch for 3 years and blowing up the hatch and ending up flashing through time, the ""moving the island"" thing and the jumping to the 70s...I was even ok with creating an alternate time line that didn't quite make sense and I wasn't really sure how Locke came back to life but I was happy to go with it and see how this amazing journey was going to tie all this together in a scientific bow.  but....  then three episodes before the end of the show out of absolutely no where there is an entire episode devoted to two minor characters and not a single main characters is featured and the only reason for this entire episode is to set up a mystical cave of light about an hours walk from the beach they spent half the series living at yet no one ever discovered and the whole show turns into good vs evil, faith, religious, Christianity.  Now I have no problem with any of those things, there were hints at all of them throughout, but we were specifically told that's not what the show was about and spent 6 years watching the journey only to find out it...oh yeah sorry...it was...

The show never became any more religious or Christian-centric than it had been since Season 1.

Some thoughts, from my point of view:   With Jacobs set of powers he could have changed or prevented this.   I think Jacob did know at least in part what would happen if you threw a person down into the Source.   If Jacob had wanted MiB dead, he could have simply killed him.  Mother was dead; her rules (""You can't hurt one another"") were over.  Instead, Jacob's rage and grief led him to a choice: to give his brother a ""fate worse than death.""  Jacob is highly distant and doesn't involve himself.  He brings people to the Island; MiB kills them; he brings new ones.  Rinse, lather, repeat.  There's a good reason why Ben says to Hugo at the very end, ""Maybe there's a better way.""   The time travel event with Juliet. It just didn't work?   The bomb didn't go off.  ""It worked"" referred to Juliet's vision or transition into the flash-sideways as she was dying.     The infection idea is never really expanded upon.   I think it's implied in the show that the ""infection"" is actually an infection of the spirit, not a germ or virus.  Unconditional love (not implying ""romantic"" here) seems to counter-act it.  That's the point of Hugo's discussion with Sawyer about ""bringing Anakin back from the dark side.""  Hugo is willing to trust Sayid (this is reinforced in their FSW conversation about how Sayid ""isn't a bad guy."")  Similarly, Kate is willing to trust and forgive Claire, even though Claire tried to kill her: so much so, that Claire is willing to get on board the Ajira plane with Kate.  And yeah, everybody loves Hugo ;-)"

People on the island were affected differently by this virus, because the island is magical. Everyone is infected, but when you give into the black smoke's influence you become a crazy psycho follower. So when the Oceanic 6 went back to America (before they knew about the infection at all) they spread the infection to people in America. Outside the island the virus works differently and when you die, you turn into a zombie. This is all canon. JJ Abrams confirmed.  /s"

lost,3d0paq,AstroZombie138,1 point,Mon Jul 13 00:39:19 2015 UTC,Yeah it's really quite amazing. I imagine the guys who did it know Lost quite well
lost,3d0paq,jayz93j,2,Mon Jul 13 01:19:36 2015 UTC,"I have to be honest, re-watching this show again with someone else who hasn't seen it yet was even more fun for me than watching the show the first time.  I found you could actually enjoy the story more without the constant nag of wondering what was going on or what would happen next, plus you could get just as excited about all the shocks because you get to experience them again through the new person :)"

lost,3d0paq,Booty-Popperz,1 point,Sun Jul 12 18:40:17 2015 UTC,"Yup.  I like to argue that LOST is one of the best shows to rewatch.  Watching the series again after you know how it ends will give you new perspective on the characters and insight into The Island.    I think it is best to wait a little while between viewings so you can forget some of the details.  I've seen the series about 4 times, but I'm going to wait another year or two before rewatching to allow me to forget some things.  I wish there was an ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" machine that would allow me to watch LOST for the first time over and over again."

lost,3cza1g,Ashephard12,9,Sun Jul 12 03:28:09 2015 UTC,"the constant, greatest hits."
lost,3cza1g,Invokationz,7,Sun Jul 12 07:46:55 2015 UTC,"- Season 1 -   Pilot - This is still the best pilot I've ever seen in television. It introduces everyone in a great way. It keeps the mystery going on, Giacchino's music is simple, but effective, and it never jump the shark. I totally get immersed even though a polar bear appears. The dialogue between them all is very good too.  Deus Ex Machina - An emotional, religious and spiritual journey for John Locke. Terry O'Quinn is terrific and so it Kevin Thighe as Anthony Cooper. What a devastating journey and his on-Island trek with Boone is filled with so much symbolism.   Walkabout - Often said the episode that really hooked you, that told you that this was much more than a simple survival drama. Not is only a great twist, but a good human drama on the island too. I also love Jack's scenes in this one, hinting at his daddy issues (like him not wanting to hold the eulogy, but sitting in the distance, with the burning fuselage in the background).  - Season 2 -  The 23rd Psalm - One of the first instances where costumes, music and cinematography captures the feeling of a village in Nigeria perfectly. The on-Island story is great and has ties with the story of Jacob and MIB  Man of Science, Man of Faith - One of the best premieres. Just the cinematography is great. The stark contrast in colors between flashback and island action, how they structured the intro or the mystery of the hatch  One of Them - So many revelations, such a big buildup. Even though I have seen the countdown timer scene dozens of times, my heart still beats fast during that buildup when the hieroglyphs show up.  - Season 3 -  The Man Behind the Curtain -  An incredible mythological episode that gave us so many answers, a great human story of Ben (that I identified a lot with, especially the lost childhood love) and possibly the scariest scene of Lost ever. They managed to give us supernatural elements, that never felt out-of-place. The theories that this episode ensued gives me warm memories of summer 2007.  Flashes before your Eyes -  What a ride! They had the balls to have so little story happen on the island (something we already strived for after the mini-season) and still made it work. Time travel had been vaguely hinted at earlier, but here they introduced it in a fresh and interesting way. Mrs. Hawking was a nice and cool addition to the show.  Exposé - Hah! Betcha you didn't see this coming. This episode is so multi-layered, like a Matryoshka-doll, like an intelligent Twilight Zone-episode. It's a satire of Lost, but mostly of television. It breaks all rules.  First and only time on this show where a character played himself (Billy Dee Williams). It gives us a behind-the-scenes approach to Lost with references to how we the audience pick apart every single clue (""Why is his shoe in that tree"". We would've connected it to Christian's shoe) and Hurley's line about The Cobra's identity being shrouded in mystery.  It's the funniest episode (outside of ""Numbers""). It breaks the Lost formula and gives us a film-noir episode, full of interesting lines like ""Promise we'll never end up like them"" that not only is witty, but they are also candidates (Fernandez is written in the lighthouse). Jacob brought them to The Island because they were flawed and MIB succeeded in his plan in this episode, in very much the same way he succeeded in ""The Candidate"".  - Season 4 -  Confirmed Dead - They perfectly introduced all these new freighter-people. Giacchino's new theme is brilliant, the visual effects are amazing (everything from Tunisia to the toy plane in the aquarium), the pacing is fast and the revelations and new mysteries are very cool.  The Shape of Things to Come - What a thrilling rollercoaster! We jump right from the writer's strike to an intense look at Ben with flashforwards that have the most complex and best use of costumes and set to give us Iraq. The action was at its best. You feel like you can't breathe at the end of the episode. So many emotions and the last scene with great written dialogue between Ben and Widmore set us up for the things to come.  Cabin Fever - You thought there wasn't anything more to tell from John's flashbacks, but here they are and they are among the best in the show. We learn that the box maker was practically born in a box (and in the end of this season, ended up in another box). Richard trying to recruit him, John showing that he was special before The Island with that drawing of the smoke monster. The on-island action is very revealing and has a new meaning after you know what MIB was really cooking up right here.  - Season 5 -  The Life and Death of Jeremy Bentham - Although it has some flaws in continuity, I understand that the writers must've had much problems trying to cram out everything in that time between John's departure to his death in only one episode. Anyway, they gave us a nice structured episode, with tons of excitement and above all, superb acting. That last scene was extremely long, but that dark lighting, tension and dialogue captures me every the time.  LaFleur - Finally a good Sawyer flashback. We haven't seen that for a long time and boy did it deliver. They managed to give us a Juliet + Sawyer-romance in so short time, without making it feel forced, but actually very believable. Sawyer shows how much he's changed through the show and his interactions with Horace and Richard are great.  Some Like it Hoth - An episode that feels like a classic season 1-episode. A simple setup, no crazy timetravel plans, but a nice story about a father and a son. It has humor, great interactions, Star Wars-references, a couple of cool reveals but most and foremost it has heart. The emotions of this episode are amazing and who would've thought that the creepy guy from the orientation films would be a central part of Lost in the future. I sure didn't.  - Season 6 -  Ab Aeterno - The best episode of Lost. At this point I had grown a bit tired of season 6 with its flash-sideways, crazy Claire, temple stories and lifeless jungle, so when this one arrived it turned everything upside down. Giacchino was perfect. The cinematography was perfect. The acting was perfect. The story was perfect. This was as cinematic as Lost could've ever been. The most movie-like since The Pilot. What a brilliantly emotional experience this episode was.  Across the Sea - It's hard to swallow and has many things I would've changed with it. But ultimately I like it. There's a lot here that overshadows the bad things. Mark Pellegrino and Titus Welliver has so much chemistry, so much history, and I love the biblical part of the revelations of The Light. They gave us so much, but still kept the ambiguity there. An episode that truly grows on you.  Everybody Loves Hugo - This episode was PACKED! So much going on without losing direction. It was one of those situations where I didn't know when the episode ended. It felt like it would end with the picnic, but it didn't. Then it felt like it would end with Jack and Flocke meeting, but it didn't. It ended with a FS with Desmond and Locke. So much going on that the episode kept just going, the action always present, explosion after explosion, but also with so much heart and passion. Cynthia Watros' return was a surprise for me and fantastic to see. They managed to sum up Hurley's character in one episode, both on island and in the afterlife."

lost,3cx5p5,ProfessorSnatch21,8,Sat Jul 11 15:44:27 2015 UTC,"Time on the island is actually the same as time on the outside world, but the bearing can send you back or forward in time if you hit the wrong one.  That said, people on lostpedia have counted the number of days in-show that the people were on the island, and found that the number of days the survivors spent on-island matches the number of days that had passed off-island when Desmond and Sayid discover that it's Christmas Eve when they get to the freighter. So Flight 815 did crash on the island on September 22, 2004.  Therefore, that must mean that 1) Flight 815 did miraculously approach the island on the correct bearing, 2) they hit a bearing that only displaced them in time a few minutes/hours, or 3) because of the angle and/or elevation at which they hit the barrier around the island, they were unaffected by any time displacement. For option number 3, remember that the satellite phones weren't subject to the time displacement barriers but the walkie-talkies were. When the radio signal traveled from one walkie-talkie to the other on the freighter, it passed through the barrier just like the helicopter, the doctor's body, etc. so it was displaced in time. But the signal from the satellite phones came from above and wasn't displaced in time. The pallet drop back in Season 2 also didn't seem to be displaced in time (it came right around the same time as the lockdown). Things dropping directly out of the sky seem to be able to avoid any time displacement. So if Flight 815 was above the barrier when the plane started falling apart and everyone started falling down to the island, they may not have experienced any time displacement.  As for the Ajira flight in the last episode, they probably didn't leave on the correct bearing since no one knew what the correct bearing was at that time, but that may have just displaced them a few minutes, hours, or days in time, which wouldn't be that big of a deal. On the other hand, since they took off from the island while the source was still inactive, it's very possible that the time barrier around the island would have been non-functional as well at that time. They may have gotten outside the range of the barrier before the source was re-activated, allowing them to experience no time dilation after all."

BB is an awesome show that's well written, great characters and with phenomenal acting from Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul. The spin off, more comedic, but definitely hold its own. Game of Thrones. I don't think I need to explain this too much. People love this show and for good reason. I don't like it as much as LOST, but it's definitely full of great characters and a great plot.

The last 6 candidates are :   Locke (4) Reyes (8) Ford (15) Jarrah (16)  Shephard (23) Kwon (42)    Enzo Valenzetti is a mathematician who found an equation with these numbers that could predict the time of human extinction.  they have failed to change the values through manipulating the environment, as the equation continues to arrive at the same six numbers : 4 8 15 16 23 42.  As we know from the tv show, these characters were very important for the fate of the Island, that's why Jacob has chosen them.  Without one of them (it's like changing the equation) the Man in Black would have ""won"", escaped the Island and destroyed the world."

lost,3cu97f,Wsimpson124,6,Fri Jul 10 20:44:59 2015 UTC,"This has almost always been my interpretation of Miles's powers (and Hurley's too). Electromagnetism has been shown in the show to be able to ""download"" or assimilate the memories, thoughts, and personalities of those nearby it. Miles is able to use his powers to access the brain and memories of the deceased directly, just like the electromagnetism does. Hurley's abilities, on the other hand, allow him to see and speak to the manifestation of the memories and personality that the pockets of electromagnetism around the world have downloaded/assimilated.  So Miles gets more accurate information, but it's more limited, where as Hurley is able to get more information, but it's not necessarily accurate or limited to what that ""ghost"" would have known in life.  There is one potential flaw in these ideas though for both Hurley and Miles.  For Hurley the flaw exists in Charlie. In the Season 4 premiere, Hurley wasn't the only person at the mental facility who could see Charlie. However, this doesn't necessarily have to be a flaw. If the other mental patient who saw Charlie was a ""ghost"" himself or was also had the same power Hurley has, then this wouldn't be a flaw. (Someone might also argue that Charlie slapping Hurley makes this a flaw, but if Hurley is having stored memories uploaded directly to his head without realizing the process that's going on, he could also be led to think that he has been slapped by that memory.)  The potential flaw with Miles is in the very first Miles flashback that we see. When Miles goes into the dead boy's bedroom, he asks the room where the boy hid the money, and this led to a noise or something falling that pointed towards the air vent. Miles then tells the room ""you can go now"". This seems to indicate that Miles was talking to an actual ghost, or at least something along the lines of the ""ghosts"" that Hurley talks to. But then Season 5 came along and said Miles couldn't actually talk to the dead, which seems to retcon this flashback scene. I'm not really sure what the explanation here is unless we just say it was meant to be a retcon or the (grand?)mother had the boy's body in the house somewhere (which is possible; some people do viewings at home instead of at a funeral parlor before burial, and it seems like the death was particularly recent)."

The only time I can think of right now, where he dosent need to use a body, is for Alex in the Dharma village. The only explanation I can come up with for this instance is that he used the memories stored by the MIB, who was very nearby, when he took Alex's image earlier."

Or why numerous characters eventually 'remember' their past life, and all inherently come to understanding that this is a kind of purgatory like place and that they're going to go to the Church and move on without needing to be told. And then they 'move on' (whatever that entails). Those things don't just happen in a otherwise normal universe where Jughead went off.

Kind of interesting to see some of the things he perceived watching this way, like in response to the question ""Where are they?"" in the pilot, he concludes from the finale:   Where are they? Hydra Island. Good enough for me. I'm bad with geography (re: American public school), so I don’t really care where in the world.   A sort of similar thing I'd be really interested in is if anyone has ever watched Chronologically Lost before having watched the show. There are so many reasons not to, but it would be an interesting perspective."
lost,3cp38v,339970,5,Thu Jul 9 17:44:23 2015 UTC,yeah I love Chronologically LOST but I would never recommend it to someone for their first viewing - mainly due to the time travel stuff.
lost,3cp38v,339970,3,Thu Jul 9 20:35:52 2015 UTC,"What made the Hydra Island part, in particular, interesting?"
lost,3cp38v,BecauseEricHasOne,5,Fri Jul 10 00:40:01 2015 UTC,"Well, for two main reasons I guess:  1) First it's a little interesting because it's factually wrong, they're not on some place called Hydra Island. There are a few small islands off the coast of the main one where they crash in the pilot, one of which some people nickname ""Hydra Island"" because there's a research station on it called The Hydra. Someone must have mentioned it in the finale, which is how the author (you?) got it in his head, and assumed that was what the Island was called. But the main Island itself doesn't have a name, much less an official one that would appear on a map or something. So it's just kind of cool that's what one would perceive watching that way.  2) The fact that the author considered that name to be the answer to the question; many fans of the show are reluctant to consider anything an answer. A lot of Lost fans have this thing where they get so worked up about everything that they're never satisfied with any explanation and would just keep asking ""Why? Why? Why?"" to each new bit of information. Say, hypothetically, the Island really was a place called ""Hydra Island,"" many fans' responses once they found out would be ""That's not an answer, that just makes everything more confusing! Who named it that? How are they related to the Island? How are they both related to Hydra from Greek mythology? etc, etc."" Not all fans are like that, but enough that eventually even the show itself poked fun at it with lines like ""Every question I answer will simply lead to another question."" Something about the way the story unfolds makes many people expect these things in on a level they wouldn't for other similar sci-fi/fantasy stories. It's just interesting that the author doesn't feel that way from watching just the pilot, and for those who do feel that way I wonder how far into the show it starts."

But I believe it's where the Ajira plane—the one the took off at the end—had landed, so it would make sense that you'd think that after seeing just those two episodes.  Glad you seemed to enjoy it though, if you do end up watching the first season I'm sure you'll love it. And as long as you're enjoying it, I wouldn't be worried to continue because you know the end; I'm sure the finale seemed super muddled, and to be honest some parts of it are, but really overall from beginning to end this whole show has some of the best plots, moments and certainly character stories I know of, I'd certainly recommend it =)"

I absolutely love this because they actually were going to kill off Jack in the pilot but the network didn't let them. Luckily they seemed to get a lot more freedom later on, but killing him then would have been interesting.

Edit: Also:   Charlie, seemingly meant to be the heel of the show, is a jackass who thinks he’s a bad ass.

One of the most fascinating parts of the show early on to me was Walt.  How they made it seem like he conjured the polar bear from his own will right after the plane crash, the others stealing him because he was so ""important,"" the visions people had of him when he wasn't really there, etc.  He definitely had supernatural abilities.  A lot of evidence points to one specific ability being astral projection; being able to ""project"" essentially a ghost of his body to another location simultaneously.  One of the others asks Michael something like ""did you ever see Walt in a place he shouldn't have been?""  Unfortunately, as I've read, the actor who plays Walt grew much faster than they anticipated on the show, and they had to severely cut his storyline, turning him mostly into another unexplained mystery.  Although it's pretty much impossible, I really wish we could get a spin off show somehow explaining more!"
lost,3cpe9i,sailboatsare,2,Thu Jul 9 18:45:26 2015 UTC,"Important tidbit relevant to Walt is this Mobisode, Room 23. It gives some insight into the Others' perspective on the situation -- how they originally wanted Walt for his connection to the Island  but then gave him back up to Michael without much resistance. It explained what Ben meant when they ""got more than they bargained for"" with Walt, which had a connotation they never really explained (but show geeks like myself usually inferred it was something like they eventually showed in the mobisode).   Clearly Walt was connected to the Island's power in a special way--this is what was never really explained. One theory is that it's just random. My personal theory is that Walt eventually becomes very attuned to the Island and its unique energy later in his life (somewhat supported by The New Man In Charge where he is recruited to return). The Island's connection transcends time, hence why he has this power even in his youth. Kind of a cop out explanation, but I'm really not reaching that hard.   I agree that it's a storyline they didn't really get to flesh out due to the actor aging so quickly. And working with child/teen actors in general is kind of a gamble -- not all of them end up having acting chops (or at least don't have them developed yet), so that could have played into it as well."
lost,3cpe9i,aleatoric,2,Thu Jul 9 22:06:39 2015 UTC,"Ben and Widmore said bad stuff about each other, so it's not that easy to pinpoint what was entirely correct or not, but Widmore is pretty brutal. He had no trouble killing his colleague in the 50's as a 17 year old, or ordering the death of baby Alex, or killing the DHARMA Initiative. It seems to me that the only person he was interested in was John Locke of the 815 survivors. I don't think he was actually ordering Keamy to kill them all, but to do whatever is necessary to extract Ben, and that could be killing many innocent survivors.  The Widmore you see at the end of the series is not the same. In the penultimate episode Widmore reveals that Jacob visited him for the first time after the freighter blew up, convinced him of the error of his ways and told him what he should do. Although I wasn't a big fan of the explanation, it's still on the show."

That's because the energy from the bomb or the incident shot them forward in time back to the present, so the site doesn't look like how it did in the '70s.  Are you maybe saying that the site itself—the crater Desmond made after not pushing the button—looked different than it did before? That's entirely possible, but if that's the case it would just be an error, there was a whole bonus feature on the DVD about them trying to re-create it as best as possible, it's definitely meant to be the same as it was before.  Besides, whether or not the hydrogen bomb itself was the incident wouldn't really change the Island from what it had been before because that would have always been the incident, it's just that the audience didn't know that detail yet. Personally I think it makes sense from a realistic human point of view that Dharma would just refer to all the things that went that time at the site as ""The Incident,"" often more than one thing happens in a catastrophe like that which later are only known as one name. Things were going very wrong with all that magnetic craziness, and then the bomb could only have made it worse.

The island has generally had a Protector for as long as it's existed, someone to protect the Source. When our timeline starts, it's the Mother. She had Jacob powers and Smoke Monster powers, which seems to be how it's supposed to be. She adopted Jake and MIB and planned to make MIB the next Protector. But he was not willing to stay on the island and take the job from her by drinking the water, so she had to give the job to Jacob instead. But she still wanted MIB to stay alive and on the island, so she manipulated things so that they would split the powers and MIB would be the Smoke Monster, trapped on the island but immortal, and Jacob would keep him from leaving in her absence while guarding the Source.  For 2000 years, the two of them fought over the nature of humanity. MIB said humans were inherently evil and greedy, beyond help. Jacob said they were ultimately good, and that he would prove it. So he kept bringing people to the island for thousands of years, and they formed various cults following Jacob, from Egyptians who built him statues and things, to the Others of the modern day led by Ben. He brought the Black Rock to the Island, and Henry Gale's balloon, and Yemi's plane, and Oceanic 815, all because you cannot find the island unless Jacob wants you to, or you have the right compass bearing.   For 2000 years, these groups failed. MIB would kill them off after they showed their true nature was bad, and Jacob would say ""aw shucks, next time I guess"" and bring more people to the island.   Oceanic crashed, and MIB launched a plan to finally get off of the island and kill Jacob. Jacob had a bunch of people on Oceanic who were Candidates to take his job over, and Smoke Monster tried to get them to kill themselves off indirectly, since he can't actively kill a Candidate. This includes appearing as Christian Shepherd in episode 5 to try to get Jack to run off a cliff, and appearing as Dave to Hurley to make him question his sanity. Most of these attempts failed.  MIB's original plan involved guilt. He had Christian and Yemi as his disposal, and tested out Jack and Eko's guilt about the deaths by appearing as those folks. Jack was immediately too headstrong and stubborn to be MIB's pawn, but Eko felt very guilty for Yemi and always questioned if he was a good person. MIB planned to appear as Yemi a ton and use Eko's guilt to manipulate him ultimately into killing Jacob, I imagine.  But then Eko found redemption, he realized that the life he led and the people he killed were all the result of a truly selfless choice he made in childhood where he saved Yemi from living this life by killing a man for him. That lets Eko decide that he is a good person, that he saved his brother, and he lets go of his guilt, and simultaneously has no baggage. The Island has no use for him because the Protector has to be damaged in some way, they have to have baggage (Jacob: ""None of you were happy in life, you needed this place as much as it needed you"".), and MIB has no use for him since he's not guilty over Yemi and is a big, strong leader type. So he kills him.  MIB then does the plan with Ben instead after Alex dies. He appears as Christian to get Locke to bring the Candidates back, and to die. Then he appears as Alex to tell Ben to listen to everything John Locke (really MIB himself) says. MIB as Locke then gets Ben to kill Jacob before revealing himself to be the Smoke Monster.  From there, the Smoke Monster is trying to kill Jack, Sawyer, Sayid, Hurley, Jin and Sun but can't do so directly and needs them to kill themselves or be killed by someone else. If he does so, he can leave the island. They're trying to stop him, obvs.  At the end, he kills 3 of them and then Jack takes on the Jacob powers. They use Desmond to unpull the Cork, the thing keeping the island in place, causing it to sink into the ocean which will put out the Source and end the world. While this is going on, the island's rules are all gone, and Jack and MIB are just humans. They fight, and MIB gets killed by Jack and Kate.   Jack then makes this epic heroic sacrifice as he's dying by going down to the Cork and braving the electromagnetism to put it back in, saving the Island and Existence. And then everyone else leaves on a plane and Jack dies. And Hurley takes over as the new Jacob with Ben as his number 2. IN the Epilogue, they go get Walt from Santa Rosa, and imply that he'll take over as the new Jacob/Jack/Hurley so that he can help Michael stop being a Whisper.    FLASH SIDEWAYS PART- IMPORTANT  After everyone died (Shannon when Ana shot her, Jack when the MIB stabbed him, Kate and Sawyer probably 40 years later off the island, Hurley a hundred years after that or more, etc.) they created a Purgatory type of thing, the Flash-Sideways. It was a place where they could cycle through some of their old baggage and anything they wished had gone differently in their lives before letting go and moving on together. Jack gets to meet his son and work through some of his own issues with his dad, Locke gets to be married to Helen, Sawyer and Miles are cops instead of con men, Hurley is really lucky, etc. They use the place to reunite with the people they loved and lost (Hurley and Libby, Sawyer and Juliet, Jack and Kate, etc.), then as Christian says, they all come together to move on to whatever the afterlife will be.   TL;DR Everything before the plane crash and on the island up to Jack dying really happened. The Flash-Sideways takes place long after that, when everyone is dead, and is the Purgatory thing where they reunite, remember and move on. Island was super real, and Jack, Kate and Desmond saved all of existence by defeating the Black Smoke, a monster created indirectly by Mother because she loved him so much that she never wanted him to leave, and directly by Jacob who was just a pawn in Mother's scheme."

lost,3ckq1t,BecauseEricHasOne,2,Wed Jul 8 21:35:14 2015 UTC,"Not fully. Dave might have been the Island or something, or it could have just been Hurley's craziness. Also though, Dave didn't seem to be a real person in Hurley's life, but just a figment of his imagination so it's hard to say. I think Darlton have also said Kate's Horse was the MIB though (?) which if true raises whole other questions.   Mostly I'm drawn to Dave being MIB because Hurley's main theme is guilt, like Eko and Ben, and because he almost jumped off a cliff over Dave which would have been excellent for MIB. It's definitely possible though that Dave was just an Island hallucination meant to bring Hurley and Libby together so that she could get through her baggage quicker in time for her death, and he could add more guilt onto his plate for later."
lost,3ckq1t,Shutupredneckman2,3,Wed Jul 8 22:21:55 2015 UTC,"To me, the simplest explanation is that Dave was a ghost haunting Santa Rosa.  (As I mentioned above, Jacob later tells Hugo that he isn't crazy; that he's blessed rather than cursed for being able to see the dead.)    As you say, MiB has every reason to egg Hugo on to kill himself.  Since we have Jacob's word on it about Hugo; since we've seen Hugo interact with dead Charlie, Eko, Michael, Ana Lucia, and dead Jacob himself, I don't think it's a stretch to assume that ""Dave"" in Santa Rosa is also a ghost."

Jacob had touched most of the Candidates before Desmond got to the island, so he planned to bring them eventually. Bringing Desmond to the island was essentially his way of doing so. He needed Desmond not only to crash Oceanic but also because Desmond was the Failsafe for dealing with the electromagnetism of the Source.

lost,3cj5uh,ARCTIC-PIPELINE,3,Wed Jul 8 09:25:55 2015 UTC,"The classic reviews will contain spoilers in the comments however, after the season 3 finale, there are the original reviews containing comments from people's first time watching it."
lost,3cj5uh,339970,2,Wed Jul 8 10:50:27 2015 UTC,Just went there and there were indeed spoilers. I think I'll just watch on my own and figure it out.
lost,3cj5uh,cgbrannigan,3,Wed Jul 8 11:36:50 2015 UTC,"I too watched Lost after it was already out and wanted to hear analysis or even just recaps/explanations without getting spoiled, and I found what really helped me was podcasts. There were a whole bunch of them, while the show was airing (though most didn't start until at least the beginning of season 2), and they're great because they're already recorded so there's almost no chance of getting accidentally spoiled. If they're the sort of thing you like, I'm sure people could recommend a few.  Other than that, I'd highly recommend you avoid any other website. Even the safest seeming Lostpedia article or something will have massive spoilers where you least expect it. And I'm not usually one to get upset about spoilers, but Lost has some truly awesome unexpected moments, it would be a shame if you didn't get to experience the surprise. If there's something you're particularly confused about, you could probably ask about it here.  And either way, I wouldn't worry too much. Lost is pretty complex—there are over 20 main characters, plus several dozen secondary ones involved in all types of intersecting plotlines, plus elements of sci-fi and fantasy that throw some people—but it's not as hilariously complex as some people like to joke about, not really any more so than any other show with an ensemble cast and/or its own mythology. It was probably hard to keep track of while it was airing if you were a casual fan needing to keep up with what was happening while waiting a week between episodes and a year between seasons, but in my experience people who have watched the show after it was over without the waiting don't have much trouble getting what's going on, and even enjoy it more. Glad you're giving the show a shot, it's really quite awesome =)"

lost,3cgzto,ImANiceGirlAma,7,Tue Jul 7 20:59:35 2015 UTC,"Well, they were originally planning on them having been married a long time. If you rewatch Walkabout early in the first season, Rose and Jack have a conversation about how she always wore Bernard's wedding ring while they were flying because his fingers swelled up, as if they had flown as a married couple many times. Luckily there are kind of ways to explain around that if you're the kind of person who likes to explain away continuity errors (e.g. ""They hadn't been married a long time, but maybe they just few a lot; it makes sense that they'd fly around more than usual to see relatives if she was dying,"" or ""Sure they were in Australia for their 'honeymoon', but sometimes couples take their real honeymoon a little while after they're married and they had already flown a few times before that while wearing rings,"" etc).  The original script for that episode has actually been leaked online, and it reveals some more of their conversation that didn't make it into the episode about Rose and Bernard having three grown children. So clearly that's what the writers originally had in mind early on, luckily they didn't solidify it too much and could get away with changing their story sometime later on.  That doesn't really answer your question—the two off them are acting like a couple who had been married at least 35 years even after that episode—but it's interesting to think about the writing process and how/when decisions like that are made and changed. (Speaking of which, if you haven't and are interested in something to read I'd highly recommend reading some of those original scripts. They not only include parts that didn't make it into the episode, but also reveal exactly what writers were trying to get across in certain scenes which the actors may not have been able to; plus it's just a cool insight into how TV like that is put together.)"
lost,3cgzto,339970,2,Tue Jul 7 23:50:23 2015 UTC,"That's exactly why it doesn't sit well with me or look natural for me to have Rose and Bernard be newlyweds.

lost,3cgzto,cgbrannigan,4,Tue Jul 7 22:32:46 2015 UTC,"I think the same reason they made Bernard Caucasian - to surprise us all.  In The Other 48 days when we've spent a bunch of Season 1 with this older African American lady talking about her husband and how she knows he's still alive, we see Bernard stuck in a tree, getting rescued etc.  When Bernard asks Sawyer and Michael if his wife is still alive, they seem shocked that HE is Rose's husband, I think we were mostly also shocked.    I think when we had Rose and Bernard's back story the writers layed it out to us like they were an old married couple.  Rose's car is stuck, Bernard is pushing to try and unstick it, he falls, they laugh, they head on their way only for her to stop him and ask if he would like to get coffee....suddenly we realise they dont know each other at all and this if their first meeting, love at first sight, engaged in weeks, married in months, oh crap, Rose's dying of cancer and now we're in a plane crash!!    I love their story, I think it's awesome and I think it's great how they didn't make them younger, played by other actors.  Say they met in their 20's - what else would their story be but some kind of racial intergration struggle?  Would we really need to see that story on LOST?

lost,3ceza3,Ceceboy,3,Tue Jul 7 11:47:53 2015 UTC,It's just a side effect of the islands whole time weirdness. If you don't enter/exit the place at the proper angle you can come out at a slightly different time.
lost,3ceza3,SageOfTheWise,5,Tue Jul 7 14:00:05 2015 UTC,"There is essentially an invisible dome around the island due to its electromagnetism/exotic matter. This dome distorts time as you travel through it. The bearing on which you cross the dome decides how much time is distorted when you cross through it.  So when the freighter sent the payload to the island, it hit the dome on a bearing that sent the payload about half an hour forward in time, so it didn't reach the island until half an hour after it should have.  When Frank, Sayid, and Desmond hit the dome on the wrong bearing when leaving the island, they were sent forward in time about a day.  When Doc Ray's body hit the dome on the wrong bearing, it was sent backwards in time so that his corpse washed up on the island before he actually died.  The signals from the walkie-talkies are also subject to this time dilation. Only the satellite phones seem to be able to get around the barrier (and that might just be because messages sent from the phones get relayed through a satellite first, i.e., they go through the top of the dome rather than the sides of the dome like everything else, so time must not distort at all (or very much) when traveling through the dome in that way)."

lost,3ceza3,Nitsut1658,1 point,Wed Jul 8 03:32:42 2015 UTC,"Probably not. They probably all experience some time dilation, but it's just a small amount of time. We don't know how much variation there is in the time dilation, but all of the time dilations we see in the show only dilate by a few hours or days at the most, so they probably all experience minimal time dilations.  Alternatively, Frank may remember the safe bearing from 2004 and take that to get off the island at the end of the show, but even that's not necessarily safe since Faraday implied in Season 5 that he had to know what year it was to figure out what a dilation-free bearing off the island would be."

lost,3cde9c,theflamingfart,6,Tue Jul 7 01:14:03 2015 UTC,"There's a couple of reasons for this:  1) Charlie knew that he was going to die eventually. If he didn't drown in the station, he was going to die in some other way in the very near future because the universe was still trying to course-correct away his life. So he could either accept the death he had before him that he knew about in advance, or he would have to face dying in some unknown way that might be more frightening or painful in the near future. Charlie wanted the known death that would let him die as a hero rather than some unknown death that might be more horrible than what he was about to face.  2) Charlie knew that if Desmond's vision was accurate, then his death would guarantee that Claire and Aaron would get off the island. He was probably afraid that if he survived that would jeopardize Desmond's vision. If Charlie dies, Claire and Aaron get rescued, but that's only a guarantee as long as Charlie dies. If Charlie survives, Claire and Aaron might still get rescued, but it's no longer a guarantee. (Now the topic of why Desmond's vision didn't play out exactly as he told Charlie is a separate topic that is up for debate. Maybe Desmond lied to Charlie about seeing Charlie die in the station (unlikely since he offered to take Charlie's place), or maybe Desmond misinterpreted his vision once again (since he could have definitely seen Aaron in the arms of a woman in a helicopter and interpreted that as being Claire), or maybe something Desmond did in the Looking Glass station interfered with his vision somehow. But regardless of that, Charlie believed Desmond's vision to be accurate and chose to act in accordance with that belief.)"

Eko not appearing doesn't bother me because I hold to the theory that Eko's flash-sideways was shown to us in The Cost of Living. Walt and Michael not appearing doesn't bother me since Michael would obviously want to move on with Walt, and Walt would probably want to move on with a separate group of people he'll meet in the future. Richard not appearing doesn't bother me because I feel like he would have preferred to move on with Isabella in a flash-sideways world that she would be more comfortable in. Frank not being there doesn't bother me since he spent so little time with the other survivors, comparatively speaking. I'm also okay with the thought that Ana Lucia, Daniel, and Charlotte weren't ready to move on yet.

Jeopardy has existed in the same format for years. No one is saying LOST influenced the entire show.

They are formally known as the 'Valenzetti Equation', a prediction of the exact date that humanity would self destruct, probably from nuclear weapons. It was developed by the UN. The DHARMA initiative's base purpose was to, through experimentation, try and change these numbers, to buy humanity more time.  These experiments proved futile, as they repeatedly produced the same core values of the equation: 4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42.   There is an abundance of canon content from the ARG on YouTube - you should check it out!

Honestly, the lack of explanation or talking about the numbers was one of my biggest disappointments in the show."
lost,3c4s69,Dynamite_Fools,2,Sat Jul 4 20:34:03 2015 UTC,"I don't understand how much more they coukd have possibly explained the numbers on the show.  Even ignoring the valenzetti equation connection, we know from the show that dharma was doing experiments and one went bad (the incident) so in order to stabilize the electromagnetic pulse the code needed to be entered.  They put the code on the hatch, and broadcast it over radio.  Sam toomey and Leonard simms heard it on repeat while stationed in the army, and the repetition drove one of them crazy.  Hurley heard the numbers from Sam and played them in the lotto.  Danielle heard the same transmission as Sam and Leonard and followed it, getting stranded.  They aren't cursed, there's just coincidence involved as with everything in life.  Sam's wife didn't believe they were cursed and the curse of the lottery is a very real myth with some bizarre true stories to back them up.  The Island is a place that houses the light off all life on earth, and the valenzetti equation predicts the end of the world. So it makes logical sense to me that these numbers would show up again and again and that they would represent some of the people who will be candidates to run the island.  I think a lot of people just see then pop up as easter eggs and expect some grand unifying answer to some magical power they hold, but really that was never it.  For every time one of the numbers pops up in the background , there are 10 other numbers floating around on screen that aren't 4 8 15 16 23 or 42, we just don't notice or care because they have nothing to do with the show."
lost,3c4s69,Scapone22,2,Sun Jul 5 01:48:01 2015 UTC,"The Numbers were being broadcast off the island by the radio tower so that those off-island who knew about the DHARMA Initiative could know as soon as DHARMA succeeded in changing one of the Numbers through their experiments, thus changing the outcome of the Valenzetti Equation."
lost,3c4s69,Petrichor02,1 point,Sat Jul 4 23:24:24 2015 UTC,"Could that imply that after 1988 or thereabouts, there was no more Dharma Initiative to care that Danielle had changed the radio broadcast?"
lost,3c4s69,stef_bee,1 point,Sun Jul 5 23:21:34 2015 UTC,"That's definitely a possibility. There's two ways this could play out (not counting the possibilities that arise if we include reasons why DHARMA might have left Danielle's message up for their own purposes if they were still on the island after she changed it):  1) The Purge could have happened before 1988. Even though Locke's dream says that the Purge happened in 1992, the Lost Encyclopedia claims that the Purge happened in 1987. There's no in-show evidence supporting the 1987 date (except for Rousseau's failure to run into any DHARMA members), but it's a possibility.  2) If the Purge didn't happen until after 1988, perhaps it's not that there was no more DI to care that Danielle had changed the radio broadcast, but rather there was no off-island faction that cared about the radio broadcast any more. In fact, the blast door map says two things that might imply that Hanso and everyone on the outside world that was invested in DHARMA gave up on the Initiative in 1985:  ""Believed to have divested from project in 1985 following AH/MDG incident""  ""Caduceus station believe to have been abandoned due to AH/MDG incident of 1985""  The official jigsaw puzzles revealed that ""AH"" was an abbreviation for ""Alvar Hanso"", and even though the meaning behind ""MDG"" was never confirmed, these two notations indicate that something happened on a business level with DHARMA and Hanso in 1985, three years before Rousseau showed up (and two years before the earlier speculative date of the Purge). And whatever this incident was, it caused DHARMA to abandon their medical station and some other project (which would make sense if funds were running low).  So if the Hanso Foundation, Ann Arbor, and all the people who were paying DHARMA to figure out how to change the Valenzetti Equation were no longer footing DHARMA's bill beginning in 1985, DHARMA wouldn't have much reason to change Rousseau's message back to the Numbers. They could keep their research to themselves from then on. (They might want to cut Rousseau's message if it saves them money on power, but that doesn't seem to be an issue in 2004, so electricity on the island is apparently free.)  The counter-argument to this is that an interview released during the Lost Experience ARG says that Hanso actually cut DHARMA's funding in 1987 (which some might take as evidence that the Purge also occurred this year), but the canonicity of this interview is obviously up for debate."
lost,3c4s69,Petrichor02,1 point,Mon Jul 6 00:22:32 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your detailed answer; I do have a few remarks in response.  I don't want to start (another) debate about the Purge date; my reason for supporting an earlier Purge is simply that it makes far more sense for Ben to have kidnapped Alex, and to raise her post-Purge.    For instance, the house Ben is shown living in with Roger shows no evidence of a child, unlike Horace's and Pierre Chang's houses.  The whole ambiance of the scene with young Roger and Ben, including Ben's longing looks at the ""Annie"" doll, say to me that Ben is still living with Roger and is lonely and angry.  Finally, Ben would have found it very hard to raise an infant anywhere other than the Barracks (which we know has infant formula, at least in 1977), as women post-1977 can't survive pregnancy; thus can't lactate, and can't serve as wet-nurses.  I understand that this is circumstantial, but that's my reasoning, anyway.  Back to Dharma in 1988, though.  I have no trouble believing that cutting off the money would drastically weaken the DI, and agree that the blast-door map supports that, even if the year was 1987 versus 1985.  Wasn't Radzinsky (the maker of the blast door map) kind of losing his marbles at the end there, maybe not paying close attention to dates?"
lost,3c4s69,stef_bee,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:49:35 2015 UTC,"It's really difficult to tell what was going on with Radzinsky. He may have been perfectly lucid but just depressed and with memory problems. Or he may have been completely off his rocker.  It'd be another huge curve ball if Kelvin's Radzinsky isn't the same guy as the Flame's Radzinsky, though it would explain the knowledge discrepancies (but I'm pretty sure the writers have confirmed that they're intended to be the same guy).   The whole ambiance of the scene with young Roger and Ben, including Ben's longing looks at the ""Annie"" doll, say to me that Ben is still living with Roger and is lonely and angry.   I think that would be true regardless of the Purge date since if he had already kidnapped Alex at this point in time, he wouldn't be able to see her very often. (It might also explain Amelia's presence in the Others, if she was a wet-nurse brought to the island for Alex... but then you've got the Amelia = Amy theories to contend with and figuring out when the Others' off-island network was built (though it does seem to precede the Purge regardless of the date since Richard was able to come and go from the island under the Mittelos name even when Locke was really young).)"

I haven't played the video game so maybe this has no truth to it but it's an interesting idea.

I guess you could think of it as a mega-flash-forward.  The Island is underwater in the FSW.  We can see that the Dharma Barracks were there, so obviously Dharma was there at one point.  The show doesn't say, but at some point in the FSW, the Island sank after Ben and Roger left.

lost,3by0ct,Wxlson,6,Fri Jul 3 16:15:52 2015 UTC,"Not so much ""Few days"".  Probably just the last 24-36 hours. I'll give you the brief rundown including the rumors and both sides of the story.  36-24 hours ago: Victoria (The AMA Lady and popular admin) left/fired/quit/mutually terminated her contract, depending on what sources and rumors you believe. The 2 main rumors were/are, that she goofed on the AMA for Rev. Jesse and this caused her termination (Kn0thing has said that her leaving was already in progress at this stage so this rumor isnt true)  The other rumor is that she was against the commercialization of AMAs (Including doing Video AMAs) and refused to be a part of it. She was then either fired or agreed to leave.   At this stage, no one knows though and neither Reddit or Victoria are saying anything.  24 hours ago: The mods go into meltdown. They make many default subs private (Including AMA, Movies, gaming and Ask) and in response to why, say that due to Victoria leaving/firing and the lack of communication from Reddit Admins, they are shutting up shop. The admins then reply (Buried under 3-4k downvotes) that they told the mods on the Mod Subreddits this was happening and how to go about doing the AMAs for the near future. Kn0thing then made an ill-fated mistake of cracking jokes and being rude before realising they goofed and deleting/apologising for certain comments.  24-6 hours ago: Many other subreddits followed suit and went private ""in solidarity"" with what they are saying is admin abuse. This includes R/funny. Many subreddits instead make the smart choice of asking their subs whether they should join with many saying no.  12-6 hours ago: Another popular admin has left/fired whatever. The dude that does the Reddit Gifts side of thigns (dont know the username). Whether its related or not, who knows.  6 hours ago: TIL Comes back online and starts heavily posting passive aggressive TILs such as ""AOL Was sued by unpaid Mods for forcing them to work"" and ""Digg was worth 160$Million at one stage before selling for 500k.""  So. To summarise.  Victoria is no longer part of the reddit Admin staff. Mods decided they couldnt do AMAs because of this as they hadnt heard anything about it and privated the defaults. The Admins then said that they HAD been informed but had chosen to ignore the procedures in place.  Now theres a big vocal crowd (Minority or majority, no one can really decide) that are calling for people to veto the site and make every sub private.  Personally, i have no idea whats going on and neither do i care. It seems like inner politics of a big company and i personally feel the mods are having a bit of a powertrip and the only thing they are affecting are regular users.  Hope that helped!"

lost,3btwwf,naknode,11,Thu Jul 2 03:00:52 2015 UTC,"Hugo is the only regular character on the show who can genuinely be described as a good guy beginning to end. Money doesn't change his character for the worse. Bad luck scares him into thinking he's crazy, but he learns to cope with it and eventually deal it away.  He's always looking out for the group and his friends.  He's always forgiving.  He goes with the flow.      Compare this to the rest of the cast. Jack alienates everyone to escape his inner demons. Kate is a murderer. Sawyer was a con man. Locke seemed like a good guy with terrible luck off the island, but worshiped the island so much he tried his best to keep everyone else from leaving it. Charlie was a drug addict. Claire abandoned her baby. Desmond ran away from true love.  Sun was an adulterer, Jin an enforcer, Sayid a torturer, Ben goes without saying, etc. Those demons haunted them for most of the first four or so seasons.   Hugo is everyman. He's the character that we most relate to and identify with because almost all of his actions are actions we'd imagine we'd end up doing in the show. Steal food? Wander around on random hikes? Set up a golf course? Not really get too involved in the proceedings?

lost,3btwwf,stef_bee,1 point,Sun Jul 5 00:54:38 2015 UTC,"Of course anybody can dislike any characters they want.  The actions you mention, though, are mostly understandable in the context of the story.  The high-speed car chase was a consequence of him seeing Charlie at the convenience store.  Whether  you think it was actually Charlie's ghost, or an ""island manifestation,"" or a hallucination, the simple truth is that Hugo had a mental breakdown at that point.  Both Walt and Hugo warned Locke against blowing open the Hatch.  Rose never liked the Hatch either; she and Hugo talk about how she doesn't like doing laundry down there.  She criticizes Jack for spending so much time there, and tells him he needs more fresh air (or something like that.)    While it was good that Desmond got out of the Hatch (he was about to kill himself, after all), the Hatch served as a huge source of problems: the guns; it was a place to secretly keep Ben as a prisoner; and it's where Libby and Ana Lucia eventually got murdered.  I can't think of a single good thing (other than freeing Desmond) which came of it.  Hugo's food hoarding and extreme anxiety were also both consequences of Hugo's mental problems.  I think there were a lot of inconsistencies in how these were handled.  I also think that the show was making kind of a false equivalence between Charlie's heroin addiction, and Hugo's behavior with a few jars of ranch and candy bars. (Not equivalent!)    I guess they had to find something to have Hugo screw up about, because otherwise he would be a bit too perfect.  The walkie makes perfect sense.  Hugo took Charlie's warning about the freighter NOT being Penny's boat very seriously.  He did not want anyone to contact the freighter, but instead wanted to warn Jack.  Using the walkie to communicate with Jack would have made it so that others could have listened in.  This is why Hugo wanted to go warn Jack personally."

They even shot on famous Lost locations, like the site where young Ben sees his dead mother on the other side of the sonic fence, served as a poignant location in this film. Near the end it seems like they are at the hangar where they shot the Oceanic 6 press conference. The waterfall from Lost Mo'oli gardens, that served as Jin's father's fishing home and the submarine dock, is the place where Howard's character and Chris Pratt's character meet.

With that being said, I think the rape scene in the first episode was so completely gratuitous, it really feels out of place with the rest of the show, and very ""un-Lost.""  They could have just cut away, or implied the tragedy, and the story wouldn't have missed a beat.  I hate that any time I've recommended the show, I have to give the disclaimer that it has a brutal rape scene because I don't want people to be offended by what is otherwise an amazing show.  ALSO, Happy Town is a great show that was cancelled way too early.  It has a pretty strong Lost vibe, and really veers into the straight up supernatural territory without losing its subtlety.  It came out during Lost's final season, so it got greatly overlooked.  The River is an excellent found-footage styled show that only got a few very solid episodes. It's the only TV show that has genuinely scared and startled me, and it's about a crew that goes to find a missing nature TV show host in the Amazon. Heavy supernatural stuff.

Yes, there are some very cool fight scenes, and when they all connect (ex. Singing together) is very cool, but as a straight male I did not quite enjoy some of the scenes. Now I respect the gays and I have nothing against them. But, I was quiet uncomfortable with the multiple sex scenes between men.  It gets to the point where, yes, there is a gay couple and their story revolves around being intimate and coming out with one another. But when they pop to the straight hero kissing and grinding on them, it really ruins the momentum for me.   I'm not saying that gays are only entitled to being in a romantic storyline, but it looses me when the tough straight male, someone I feel I can relate to, is doing basically porn with other men. It made me extremely uncomfortable.   I just want to clarify I have nothing against gays in any way, shape, or form. I hope you understand what I am saying. This did kind of effect me and I may be over-reacting, but I feel very strongly about this. I watch a show to enjoy the storyline, but when you show me gay porn or gay/bi orgies that's when it makes me uncomfortable. It's just not my thing and it's not really something I want to see.   I'm sorry if this is out of the question and something you don't mind. I also apologize if this comment offended anyone in anyway, I did not mean to do so."

I just finished the show 20 minutes ago and I really liked the ending but I have so many questions. I assume Jack died when he laid back down in the bamboo fields but didn't Sawyer and Kate and the others get on the plane and leave the Island?
lost,3bnbb0,greatnessflicker,3,Wed Jul 1 02:24:51 2015 UTC,"They all died at different points in time, but the flash sideways was a kind of purgatory where they could meet again before all crossing into the afterlife together (in the church). I assume they all actually ""moved on"" as soon as everyone in the church finished their experiences in the flash sideways world.  (disclaimer: I haven't re-watched the series for a good two years)"
lost,3bnbb0,Derpatologist_7,2,Wed Jul 1 03:01:52 2015 UTC,"You're spot on, and time had zero meaning in the flash sideways. Think about how Miles dad looks the same as he did in the 70's in 2004 and when Sun and Locke both wind up at the hospital at the same time even though the events that brought them there happened at different times. And also Sun saw Locke being stretchered in when he was run over by Desmond and yet Locke returned later for Jack to operate on him and Sun was still at the hospital even though she was just there for observation.   Time was completely meaningless there."
lost,3bnbb0,greatnessflicker,1 point,Wed Jul 1 12:27:54 2015 UTC,"See, even if I did feel a little ""tricked"" with the flash sideways (I assumed it was a parallel universe), that's one of the reasons why I loved the device in the end. Time is such an interesting motif throughout the series. Also it seems as different characters spent different amounts of ""time"" in the flash sideways world, independent of when they died. Characters that had relatively few loose ends to tie up did not need to do as many things as say Jack had to, namely burying his father and parenting a teenage son."
lost,3bnbb0,horusreb0rn,0,Wed Jul 1 23:43:27 2015 UTC,"I still think the island was symbolic for the subconscious like the 108 minutes in the hatch, kinda how we just repeatedly go about our life not really knowing  exactly why we keep living day to day, 108 has deep meaning to mathematicians about life, and then their was the polar bear in the back of Walt comic book and the fact that Walt and the dog have a special consciousness unlike developed humans, which is why the polar bear sort of spawned their (which also fits into the mention of polar bears in dharma vill because time travel is linear and if it happens it will basically always be their) just a few of many ideas that make sense, 7 stations, 7 is a magic number, I think their parts of the brain and somewhere else in the body... just a few ideas lol"

lost,3bohv1,NathanDickson,-1,Tue Jun 30 21:27:53 2015 UTC,"When I watched the show all the way through for the first time last year, I was extremely disappointed with its ending. I was moved to tears until the moment Jack's father showed up, at which point my sadness became frustration. I felt as if I had been deceived. I was expecting the flash sideways to be a parallel universe like what I had seen in Fringe, the follow-up project from J.J. Abrams.  This edit removes the post-death ""weigh station"" ending. Jack was never married to Juliet, Jack never had a child and Jack's father is really dead so there is no father-son reunion at the church. I have also tried to remove all possible moments of foreshadowing which hinted at the original ending. In my version, the flash sideways is a real alternate universe which was borne from the nuclear explosion at the end of season 5. The characters are all still alive and may continue to live as family, friends and lovers.  This edit also adds a coda, taken from the additional features released after the show officially ended. I think this new ending, combined with everyone still being alive and together, just in a different place, is more satisfying, at least for me.  I have also edited a few key episodes earlier in the season which removes all references to Jack having been married or having a son, specifically the episodes titled ""Lighthouse,"" ""The Last Recruit,"" and ""What They Died For,"" although that last title could be considered problematic. I am at my Vimeo upload limit for the week, otherwise, I would have uploaded them as well. If this video is allowed to stay here, maybe I will upload the others over the next few weeks.  EDIT: I do have an extremely high-quality version, complete with 5.1 audio, but it's like 2.1 gigs, so I'd need a place to stick it on the web outside of Vimeo. Youtube could handle it, but they tend to get flaky with this type of thing."
lost,3bohv1,quinnly,5,Tue Jun 30 21:28:30 2015 UTC,"The reason I don't like the idea of having it be an alternate universe is that it kind of diminishes what they actually ended up doing on the Island - saving the world. If they can just go and create other universes then why bother stopping the MIB at all? I think this ending would make the entire plot of the 5.9 seasons that came before it almost pointless. Which is funny, because a lot of people thought the actual ending made the entire plot of the show pointless as well."

lost,3bohv1,the_tit_nibbler,2,Wed Jul 1 00:52:17 2015 UTC,"If you watch Kate's reaction in the original version of The End, she has a ""Well... fuck."" reaction when Desmond shows up after she realizes where they are and asks ""What now?"" It's as if even she has resigned herself to the fact that it's all over and there will not be a life with Jack after all. I snipped that bit out, of course.  Later on, when she tells Jack, ""We'll be waiting inside."" she does not look happy. It just ruins the tone of those moments for me to see her being so bummed out. It all made sense at the end of the original edit, of course, when Jack also finds out that he is actually dead in this weird nether-place where great pains are taken to locate and deliver an empty coffin.  Ugh. I remember that feeling of seeing Jack's father walk in even now. I was like, ""What? Huh? He's supposed to be in the coffin. Why is the coffin there? They're ALL dead? WHAT THE HELL! This blows. They robbed me of the enjoyment of this alternate universe where they were all able to reconnect after remembering what happened in the first universe because it's the afterlife. So awful.""  And things like, ""So there are shitty bad men who want to kill you in this afterlife then? You can get shot and almost die as Sun did? How the hell can you die in this place? How are they able to feel physical pain if this is not life?"" Just too stupid for me."
lost,3bohv1,whacafan,3,Wed Jul 1 01:11:35 2015 UTC,"But why cant it still be an alternate universe of sorts? They all lived full lives in that intermediary plane and found each other through means of Desmond. They all then decided to disembark from the church to presumably an afterlife in which they are all together. This is in my opinion a better ending than just having a do-over life, albeit the more cliché one.   As far as the Kate/Jack reactions, I don't think Kate was bummed as much as she was anxious about the situation. Jack was the last one they needed to accept it so they could go on. On a side note, I'm pretty sure Jack would've been more pissed off to learn the 2nd time his dad died was an actual death and not part of the grand reunite scheme. The reason it's so emotional for him is it's in his character. Faith was never his strong suit and logic dictates that what he's seeing and being told isn't possible, hence his reaction. Once he sees what's actually going on the joy is pretty visible.  All in all while you're entitled to your opinions, keeping an open mind and removing the constraints of your expectations might let you enjoy the ending eventually. It completely ties together the major themes of the show and I think the show in it's entirety would lose a lot of its meaning with a different ending."

Nobody wants to watch their wife or daughter die a horrible death because of pregnancy.  Perhaps the Others just put two and two together; blamed Dharma, and took revenge."

I prefer to make up my own scenarios of what happened once Ajira Flight 316 left the Island. But all that really matters is that they found eachother again. The story is over, it doesn't need to be milked out for money.   But would I watch if they did make one anyway? Most likely, but I'd be very very skeptical"
lost,3bm92w,theverybest27,4,Tue Jun 30 10:48:50 2015 UTC,I'd agree unless they could get Hurley and Ben to come back and some of the original writers. I'd still watch regardless because I think some hardcore fans (which I'm one)  feel there could be a continuation that would work. Not a reboot however. Just as popular series like Star Trek can continue because there's ways to make it work and some fans enjoy the type of situation an storyline. Regardless I'd watch just to give it a chance because I feel there's nothing like it on tv. Lost reminded me when I first heard of it of the series The Fantastic Journey (1977) which unfortunately back then often when a series was cancelled they'd just stop and leave it unfinished. Thankfully a lot of shows that don't get high ratings get an ending because they know there's a market with netflix an DVD sales. I think there's potential there. Yes Hollywood is about the money but if it's done right it's the fans who benefit.
lost,3bm92w,theverybest27,5,Tue Jun 30 11:00:18 2015 UTC,"Even a continuation wouldn't be so hot, what storylines are left really? Sure Desmond has to get home and The Whispers need to be helped but would two storylines be enough for a continuation of a series? We could get maybe one more season out of it and to me that wouldn't be worth it.   I also consider myself a hardcore LOST fan I've watched it 12 times in the last 3 years alone but still my fear of it being ruined outweighs how much I miss new content. In my honest opinion I think a continuation would take alot of what made LOST so great away from it.  But again like I said, if it happened I'd probably watch just because but I'd be skeptical."
lost,3bm92w,Numbers4815162342,2,Tue Jun 30 11:13:11 2015 UTC,I see where you're coming from. I was more thinking of how at the end Hurley and Ben were the two who were supposed to be going back to the island. My thinking is why is this island unique? Could it be possible there are other islands? Maybe one more at a different location in the world? Perhaps like the Dharma stations there is a main location and one or two other islands that distribute the balance of energy that makes the island(s) so unique. They could use this concept and the idea dharma had other projects around the world or on other islands. Or leave Dharma out of it. (Although I find the idea of the Dharma group fascinating). Maybe something goes wrong with the other island because of the events on the original main island. Or perhaps everything is fine now and Hurley and Ben try to prevent too much being known by those who seek to unlock it's mysteries. Either way I agree the original works on it's own. I wouldn't want something bad just for the sake of having something.
lost,3bm92w,Derpatologist_7,0,Tue Jun 30 11:27:01 2015 UTC,"Although those are two storylines, the writers could easily create more (Walt coming back opens a lot) also just thinking of Aaron, Ji Yeon, Charlie Hume, and others could come back.

lost,3bm92w,CannedShoes,1 point,Thu Jul 2 23:56:38 2015 UTC,That's how I'm leaning too. The whole Dharma thing really interested me and kept me watching. The idea of a secret group and what they were up to many years ago I found fascinating. And it just seems natural that they'd still be active today in some way. I don't see why it'd be hard to assume there was even another island and dharma was set up there too. Or another island was discovered. Maybe there is special places on the planet where these mysterious energy forces can be found. I think the possibilities are limitless. It just can't seem like a reboot. And can't seem like it's just thrown together to make a quick buck. If it's done right though I'd watch and give it time to develop.

That spending your life trying to find out the answers to the big questions is a disappointing and ultimately fruitless use of your time on this Earth: every answer will be disappointing, or will just lead to more questions, and that's assuming there actually is an answer. The value of a human life is in the connections we make, with family and friends and other human beings. Within the show, this is illustrated through the characters and their eventual fates. Compare Daniel (trying to unlock secrets of the universe) and Locke (determined to unwravel the mysteries of the Island) to Kate (adopting Aaron), Sawyer (devoting himself to keeping the time-travelling Losties safe and getting everyone off the Island) and Jack (sacrificing himself to save everyone else). But the REAL brilliance is that this statement was even more perfectly illustrated by fan reactions to the Grand Finale. The fans who were only concerned with getting answers to the mysteries were disappointed and wound up regretting their time spent watching the show. The fans who were more concerned with the characters and their journey thought the finale was fantastic and moving."""

lost,3bghvk,Zeddar,1 point,Mon Jun 29 00:57:13 2015 UTC,So that's where the people who crashed go when they die?
lost,3bghvk,Scapone22,15,Mon Jun 29 01:00:13 2015 UTC,"Essentially, in the world of Lost, when you die, you move on with the people who meant the most in your life. Considering the significance of what the island was, and the ordeal they all went through, the crash survivors were the most important people in each other's lives.  The idea is that everyone dies, some before jack and some long after (that's something Christian said to him in that final scene).  So like Boone was there, he died in season 1.  Jack was there, he died in the final episode of the series.  Kate and Claire etc.. we're there because eventually, at some point, they too died.  Maybe it was the day they returned home or maybe it was 40 years later, but they all met up in this purgatory to move on together.  Seasons 1-5 were all 100% real life.  Season 6 was 50/50.  The flash scenes in the alternate world were the afterlife, but the island scenes were normal life.  I personally felt like they made it all pretty clear in the final scene."
lost,3bghvk,8675309Jenny,2,Mon Jun 29 01:11:37 2015 UTC,"It's not just the people who crashed, it seems to be the general afterlife for everyone in that universe. For example, Penny is there in the church with everyone at the end, but she didn't crash and was never even on the Island at any point.  They purposely keep it a little mysterious, but it seems like anyone who dies and is able to, goes there and just wait until they are ready to ""move on"". You ""move on"" with the people who you spent the most important part of your life with, seemingly to some nice place.  The flash-sideways we see in a way is a sort of epilogue to the rest of the series, but being Lost, they showed it out of order instead of just tacking it on the end. It takes place after the events of the rest of the show, probably a very long time after, when all the characters we see there have died. (And before someone corrects me, I'm using ""after"" loosely; I know the flash-sideways doesn't directly take place ""after"" the events of the series, it's seemingly on some sort of a different metaphysical plane where time doesn't work the same way, but that word conveys the general idea.)"
lost,3bghvk,Petrichor02,1 point,Mon Jun 29 02:17:09 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind that this ""alternate universe"" is just a way station. It's the place your consciousness goes in your dying moments. The light filling the church indicated everyone finally dying/moving on into ""whatever comes next"", be that death, an afterlife, reincarnation, or something entirely different. The show lets you decide."
lost,3bghvk,Zeddar,1 point,Mon Jun 29 02:49:34 2015 UTC,"Yup. Think of it as purgatory, or something similar.  Doesnt matter who died when, eventually they all reach this ""dimension"" where they cant pass on until they find each other.  Someone explained it in a better way than I in another thread though.  It might sound a bit off but imo the ending was superb"
lost,3bghvk,paloian,0,Mon Jun 29 03:04:29 2015 UTC,"Ok....no, people are are giving you the wrong impression on one important thing, the flash sideways was not the afterlife. The rest of which they have been saying is true for the most part but that world was a facsimile created by Hugo. That universe is contained within the islands memory and was made in order for the people there to meet up before moving on to the next life. It's not purgatory, they aren't necessarily atoning for anything, it's a waystation. There is a lot of evidence to supporting this but I don't really want to go point for point in this. Sufice to say that when you go to the island you memory is copied and stored, or at least part of it, this part of you is what was put in this world by Hugo. That's why some people there don't have any memory of their lives after they left the island, their memories were copied before they left. There is much more here but I can't remember it all, sorry if I sound angry but when I see ""it was purgantory the whole time"" I get very frustrated."

I also don't see any episode being ""worst"", but weakest. There's always something interesting to find in the weakest episodes of Lost.  My least favorite is What Kate Does.  It does the exact opposite of what I think the direction of season 6 should be. It stalls. Heavily. Take the first 6 episodes of season 5 and 6 first episodes of season 6. Season 6's beginning doesn't have the same tension, excitement and drive, and What Kate Does is where it falls back on those factors. LA X is such a stellar premiere and with the arming of The Temple, the dramatic buildup of those scenes should culminate in the attack of MIB in this episode, instead of Sundown. We instead go back to the ""cages""-storyline, with Sawyer's line about ""thinking about running"" to Kate. The same story where the main characters driving the story are just put back into place, just waiting for something to happen. I know they do it for nostalgic purposes, with season 6 mirroring events from earlier seasons. But this isn't the best way.   Naveen's acting is at its weakest, with that odd accent. I liked the green pill, but that too dragged on.  It's such a bore with the ""authority not telling them""-stuff we've already seen the show do.  LENNON: Once we've spoken to Mr. Jarrah, we'll be more than happy to tell you everything you want to know.  JACK: Something tells me that you're not going to be happy telling us anything.  That's right Jack. But what does the episode do? It goes back into the same structure as we saw years ago. The story doesn't move forward until the last 5 minutes of the episode.  The Temple had such an awe in the season 6 premiere. With Giacchino's new score, the combination of CGI and set, the extras walking around, the rocket launch with the ash circles. Really, really cool. In this episode, the temple looks like a set. So bright and soulless. It lost all magic.   Flash-sideways: Not that interesting to watch. The best FS-stories are those that manage to summarize the entirity of a character into one new story. Just look at how much layers there are in Dr. Linus. Not that much in this one.  And I don't like how they teased us with the Claire-reveal. Also something they've done before in a better way.   The dialogue is also pretty low for Lost's standard. ""I can be very convincing when I wanna be"". And Aldo's lines with Kate and Justin.  Speaking of Aldo. They've already done the ""annoying minor character"" with Frogurt and Montand. It's not as fun anymore, and just lazy writing.  Evangeline's acting was far superior in Whatever Happened, Happened."

All the characters in the FSW (including Claire and Charlie at the concert) are already dead.    You are correct about Sayid.  He becomes a killer for Ben after he leaves the Island for the first time, and before he goes back on Ajira flight 316.  After Jack leaves the Island for the first time (along with the rest of the Oceanic Six), he tries to make a normal life for himself.  Eventually he begins taking pills with booze, grows a beard, flies around waiting for the planes to crash.  These scenes are woven into Season Four in what are called the ""flash-forwards.""  What might help is to look at the Lostpedia timelines.  The one you probably want is the Off-Island 2005-2007 timeline.  The one after the Ajira return is the Post-Return Timeline, which also includes Jack, Kate, Sayid, and Hurley's time travel to the Barracks in 1977."

At least not from what I remember. She walked into the Temple and they raised their guns at her, but I don't think they were really afraid of her. Then they tossed her in a hole.

To me, I saw it as  Kate's reaffirmation to Jack (and for the benefit of the audience) that she still loved him.  Jack had said that he had her, but he lost her.  And Kate's love declaration shows that he was wrong.  He STILL had her."
lost,3avuvb,abudzl,2,Thu Jun 25 00:44:28 2015 UTC,"But to the audience (at least me), Kate seems to be very confused about who she truly loves (Jack or Sawyer) for the main part of the series. Even in the alternate universe, Kate and Sawyer have a sort of instant chemistry that Jack and Kate lacked. Also, their love for each other was never declared on-screen prior to that scene, and closes the curtains on Jack's and Kate's struggle to find real, true love, imo."
lost,3avuvb,lostfan2015,2,Thu Jun 25 00:50:29 2015 UTC,"I didn't think it was that confusing, tbh.  Sawyer and Kate were pretty much over when she slapped him in Eggtown.  And then Sawyer is very much in love with Juliet, so I didn't see the ambiguity.  Also, once Kate settled down with Jack and they were raising Aaron together, it became clearer that they would not have Kate running back to Sawyer.  Her character would never be able to recover from that.    As for the sideways, I disagree.  Jack and Kate definitely had instant chemistry when they bumped into each other on the plane.  And they later have a flash of recognition at the airport.  They are then kept separate, which we now see that the writers intended to keep them apart so as to have them reunite in  the end.  Sawyer and Kate were in proximity, but nothing seemed to build up to them getting together.  It always seemed to me, that Kate and Jack would bump into each other again.  And they did.  :-)  As I said before, I think Kate's love declaration, while an on-screen first, is still Kate telling Jack that she still loves him and only him.    And fyi, I thought Jack and Kate had spark and chemistry and many fans thought so as well."

Alan Dale and Naveen Andrews both thought it was dumb as hell, and regularly showed no interest in the show, its mythology, or it's devoted community. I can only imagine others on the show felt the same.  It's like the GoT actors who play their roles well but don't care for the source material or the fantasy elements of the show. Or like Edward James Olmos telling Ron D Moore that he would only do Battlestar Galactica on the condition that it had no aliens or stupid sci-fi shit.  Some people just hate sci-fi / fantasy, whether they get paid to appear in it or otherwise. It shouldn't affect us as show watchers :)"

For me it was because I didn't have time for tv really but knew of the show because friends talked about it. Now with full series of shows being available online in one form or another, I decided to give it a try a fee months ago. So to me it's a series I recently finished watching.

The ending did a better job on one side than the other, so some people were disappointed.   No TV show that I have loved has ever ended perfectly. The closest that I can think of is Psyche.

People forever complain to me that Lost became ""just so unrealistic"". No one says, wow Harry Potter was awful, all that magic was so unrealistic, or ""The Walking Dead makes no sense...there's such thing as zombies""  The first two seasons of the show made it seem like the rules of the real world were the rules of the show world, and it took until later seasons to get across to the audience, that this wasn't a show based on real science, there's a magical fantasy element, Walt's powers, Hurley's powers, Richard's aging, the Light.   But by then most of the audience was too locked into these real world rules that they couldn't accept these new elements"

An to make him easier to write for and not slow down his time on the show he eventually quickly learned and understood basic English. Not the a or or characters fault though.  Ben: as a character he seemed evil and creepy on some level. By the third season I came to realize (at least IMHO) 99% of what he did was robotic and very much in what he believed was the benefit of his cause. He almost always had a plan and a backup plan and his reasoning behind virtual everything was there just not always fully understood by most people at the time. But it was always in what he saw as his duty to further the cause and less about a person who was mad with power and feared losing it. When not obligated to behave so cut throat he handed the reins of power to Hurley by the end and became more of an advisor and second fiddle without any regrets that were noticeable. He'd kill you during his tenure but not out of malice or anger, if was because he felt it was what the island demanded or was the only path to remove an obstacle. On some lev I gained a new found respect for him and he became my favorite character. As a result I even tune in if I hear he's on any tv show because I felt the actor himself played the part so well. (Person of interest as an example) I wish him success and hope he keeps showing up on tv shows and movies. He's more of an unlikely lead just as Dustin Hoffman was. If he's cast properly he can carry a show well as an actor."

lost,3am3ew,Fats33,1 point,Mon Jun 22 11:31:48 2015 UTC,"Don't think we are going to agree on this one.  From my recollection the whole scene related to Jack's flashback of not giving up on someone (I think the flashback was Christian telling him to call it when a patient died and Jack refusing to).  The scene for me was about Jack's character arc and not really on Charlie.  I doubt that the writers had planned for Charlie to die at this point, likewise I doubt they had planned for him to fulfil his destiny at this point and there is arguements for both, but I sit on my side of the fence because Charlie had other close brushes with death (the bridge collapsing for one) before Desmond had his flashes, and I don't really know what Charlie's destiny was meant to be.  It can't really be turning off the switch because Desmond had seen Charlie die (and saved him) before that destiny could be filled.  If that was his true destiny then the island would have stopped him drowning, or the arrow going in his throat and not Desmond."

lost,3am3ew,kaze754,2,Mon Jun 22 20:09:51 2015 UTC,"Private insurance doesn't preclude public cover, though. If you have private insurance, it will allow you to e.g. stay in a private room instead of a crowded public ward. So if your private insurance doesn't cover palliative care, the government will still provide you with palliative care for free, but you'll have to be in a public ward without any of the perks of being a private patient. I suppose you could opt to pay the private fees out of pocket (and so when Claire or her aunt said they couldn't afford the particular care, maybe they were saying that they couldn't afford the private care and Claire's mother would have to move to a public hospital bed). To be honest I'm not sure if any private hopsital cover exists which doesn't cover palliative care."

He also played two characters with extremely different views and personalities but nailed them both.  But Emerson did have some paramount scenes, specifically the scene where he stabs Jacob. The one scene with Ilana may be the second most believable scene in the entire series (the first is easily Sun's reaction to Jin ""dying"" in the freighter explosion).  I agree the guy was fantastic and definitely one of the top 2 actors on Lost depending on your POV with O'quinn being the other. But IMO the order goes 1) O'Quinn. 2) Emerson.

After all, Hurley loved and respected Jack over everyone else, who else to tempt Hurley like Jacob's brother tempted Jacob?  The whole ethos of the show is the constant struggle between good and bad and how characters are affected by this struggle.

lost,3akmry,WhyDidISignOut,3,Tue Jun 23 22:39:27 2015 UTC,"The smoke and Jacob's brother are NOT the same. The smoke represents the darkness in everyone, it was set free when jacob threw his brother into the light. At this point, his brother died. If you can recall at the end of ""Across the Sea"" Jacob finds his brother's body which has washed inn one of the water outlets from the light (much like where Jack ended up in ""The End""). We then see him lay his family to rest in the caves and know they stay there until the survivors crash as we see them discover the skeletons in season 1. NOTE: this proves that the thing walking around is NOT the same brother.  The thing you are seeing constantly talking to Jacob through the later seasons is, therefore, just the smoke using the image of his brother in an attempt to manipulate him and let him leave the island. The smoke wants to leave the island, and has stated many times, pretty much just so he can kill everyone ever. What a dick.   My theory is that once it takes the form of a dead person the smoke is also able to access the memories and feelings of that person. This is foreshadowed by how Miles can get a 'feeling' of the emotions of a person right before they died. The smoke does this on a much greater scale however and after a while, it begins to blur the lines between its reanimated host and it's own desires. This is why it constantly talks about ""going home"" which is what Jacob's Brother wanted to do, or is seen seen shouting Locke's catch-phrase ""don't tell me what i can't do"" after he is unable to change hosts once Jacob is dead.  In short, the smoke is trying to convince other people that it has innocent intentions like wanting to leave the island and go home but really it is, by definition of the show, simply an evil and powerful entity.  In regards to your second and third question, they were both quite young at the time, acting out of despair and wanting revenge: The brother wanted revenge for the death of his people, Jacob for the death of his mother. Over the years however, Jacob attempts to rectify this by showing the smoke monster that not everyone is evil on the inside: he is trying to fix his mistake of bringing the smoke into the world.   Neither of them are truly better than each other and that's the message of the show. Jacob is symbolising Light and the monster is Dark. They will both always be there and at times each one may take over but the point is about balance between the two.  Also, if you think about it, Jacob has pretty much the same fate except he doesn't be a complete dick about it. So there's that."
lost,3akmry,Stellcraft,1 point,Wed Jun 24 00:59:32 2015 UTC,"I knew about that theory but I don't know how I feel about it.  In the lost universe, the ""soul"" does indeed exist. It is something that everyone has that goes beyond their phisical bodies. You can see this on the flashsideways, the whispers of the island, and different apparitions (ex: Hurley and Charlie)  Whose to say that the black monster isn't the soul of the MiB? The island has the power to ""imprison"" the souls of the people who died on the island and can't move on. This is the origin of the whispers (Michael)  Maybe, what happened to the MiB is that his soul was separated from his body. He is not dead, but he isn't alive. Thus, a fate worse than dead   I do believe that the black monster is Jacob's brother. In a way, he has become the ""soul of the island"" and that's why he can't leave, just like a soul can't leave it's own body. He is linked to it, unlike Jacob who can leave when he wants.  The soul from the MiB is now trapped on the island. The island is his body. And that is why he needs to kill the island (turn off the heart of the island) and then his soul will be linked to the body of the person that he is inhabiting. (If had been succesful, the MiB's soul would have ended on Locke's body)  When the heart of the island is turned off, Flocke lost his power and became mortal again. How could he destroy the world and kill everyone if he is just a simple man now?  This is my problem with Jacob. He says that if he is free, he will destroy everything, that he is pure evil. But the only way for the MiB to leave is by becoming mortal  Jacob is following the teachings of his ""mother"". A woman who killed Claudia (their real mother) and then killed a whole village. (yes, they were getting close to the light, but come on...)  What has the MiB done to gain his fame of being the absolute embodiment of evil?  He has manipulated people for his own interest. (leaving the island)  What has Jacob done to gain his fame of being the good one?  He has manipulated people for his own interest (protecting the island... by the way, why is it so important to protect the island?)  The difference between the two, is that one was betrayed by the woman who raised him, and murdered by his brother  And the other one just blindly follows the orders of the woman who raised him."
lost,3akmry,WhyDidISignOut,2,Wed Jun 24 02:55:59 2015 UTC,"You bring up a lot of excellent points and I agree with your first theory: perhaps the monster is Jacob's brother. We don't really have any evidence of anything like him before on the island other than that one scene where his entire camp has been completely sacked and it's a little far fetched to believe that one elderly woman could pull that off.  I also think what you're trying to say about the black smoke being the soul of MiB is similar to what I said about the two discrete personalities being blended together within the one body. The only thing I'm not so sure about is it feels too much like a super villain origin story. The bad guy is thrown into a nuclear reactor of sorts and comes out the same person but with evil powers. I believe it fits better to believe that the darkness from the heart of the island is finally allowed to possess a body and is granted the ability to escape from the light but Jacob is the only thing keeping it on the island. As for its intentions to destroy the world i think it's not the fact of him turning into smoke and flying around the planet but more so that he is only allowed to leave if the island is 'turned off' and if this is the case then the source for all the goodness has been cut off from the world allowing the monster to do as he pleases once he leaves. I don't think he will single-handedly destroy everything but  it will be a shape of things to come.  Jacob wants to protect everyone but goes about it in a very destructive way probably due to the fact that he has no idea how the world and its people really work. Mother was also this way; fighting for what she believed in which saw the destruction of many innocuous people around her. His Brother also over reacts in a moment of anger and murders mother. All three of them are not good people, although in there minds they were doing the right thing.  What makes the monster evil (apart from the show needing an interesting antagonist which is actually the main reason as to why he is considered 'bad') is that he does bad things for the betterment of himself and, in the end, has no regard for the life of other people. Jacob's brother did not disregard life in this way. You can see this how even though the people on the island were working against everything he was taught he still gave them a chance and grew to listen to their ideas instead of burning them down on first sight.   Following blindly does not really sum up what jacob is doing. you cannot blindly follow something for hundred of years. at the beginning he may have been naive but as he grew and learnt about the island he understands why he thinks it needs to be protected. Even though he sees this he still brings people who can tap into the light to the island in an attempt to prove to the monster that not everyone is filled with evil and only after he realises that the monster will probably one day take the island for himself does he start looking for his candidates."

lost,3akmry,stef_bee,2,Wed Jun 24 03:01:38 2015 UTC,"Not everyone who went down into the Source turned into a smoke monster.  (There were skeletons down in the Source.)  While it's not clearly stated in-show, presumably something else had to happen to make someone a smoke monster besides going down into the Source.  I suggest that ""something else"" was Jacob's intention, when he threw MiB down into the Source.  Jacob already knew what could happen.  Jacob, as protector, had the power to make that happen to his brother.  In his rage, he did.  Now, back to Jack.  Hurley was actually the protector at the time that Jack descended into the Source.  We already know from what we see in-show that Jacob's touch had special properties (like being able to save Locke from his fall out of the window.)    If you look carefully in the scene where Jack says to Hurley, ""Now you're like me"" (the conclusion of the ritual which transfers the protectorship), Hurley is still holding Jack's shoulder.    I'd argue that the first thing Hurley does as protector (probably unconsciously) is make it so that Jack can survive going down into the Source long enough to send Desmond out, then stagger into the bamboo field before he dies.  Hurley would probably have saved Jack 100% if he could, but in the few seconds after becoming protector, Hurley probably doesn't have any idea what he's capable of.

Mother set it up so that Jacob and his brother couldn't harm/kill each other. She tells them that going into the source is a fate worse than death. But, we know she was a good liar, so who knows. Maybe she'd been down there herself.   So my idea is that since the boys couldn't kill or harm one another, what should have ended in death for dark brother couldn't happen due to the rule she created so the source spat out the brothers essence even though his body was dead."

Kelvin clearly played up the ruse for Desmond, since Desmond eventually discovered him walking around outside without the gas mask. Whether Kelvin believed the air was deadly or not before Desmond arrived is unknown.   Also remember that the Others used the gas from the Tempest to kill DHARMA. The only confirmed survivor of that attack was Radzinsky, since we know he manned the Swan for a number of years afterward. So it's possible that Radzinsky found out about the Purge, and mistakenly believed all of the island was contaminated, or at least had the possibility of being contaminated, so he buckled down in the Swan and wrote the Quarantine. The injections might have possibly been developed at the Tempest and he either had them in the Swan already or went out to get them.  This is all speculation of course, but there WAS a chemical attack on the island at some point, and the blast door map proves Radzinsky liked to make notes and warnings."

In my head canon, they were a compliance drug, but a far lesser dose than what Ethan gave Claire when she was locked up in the medical station.  Second question: There were a group of Others who lived at the Temple.  Their leader Dogen had been hand-picked by Jacob in a bargain, where Dogen went to live on the Island, and Jacob would heal Dogen's son of a near-fatal traffic accident (thus Dogen traded his son's life for never being able to see his son again.)  The Temple was also kind of a sanctuary.  Ben sent the Barracks Others there when the freighter was on its way to the Island in Season Four."

lost,3ajlwm,ohhimark108,1 point,Sun Jun 21 02:29:32 2015 UTC,"1) There are three possibilities. A) We were told that the injections were for the Sickness. Perhaps DHARMA figured out how to create a drug that would allow their workers to resist influence from the smoke monster if they were to run across it. B) Since the Swan workers were being constantly bombarded by electromagnetic radiation, perhaps the injections had something in them to build up some sort of immunity in the Swan occupants. (This may even be how Desmond eventually became immune to the effects of electromagnetic radiation.) C) They did nothing and were merely in the Swan station, like the ""Quarantine"" sign, to scare the Swan occupants away from exploring the island.  2) The people with Dogen were just more Others. Not all of the Others had moved into the Barracks. Some stayed behind in the Temple. When Ben decided to meet up with the Flight 815 survivors to try and talk them out of calling out to the freighter in the Season 3 finale, he told the Others who had followed him to the Barracks to go to the Temple and wait for him there."

Even though this was dangerous on a global scale, Dharma didn't want to just destroy it because it was such a unique, fascinating, seemingly limitless source of energy that could be studied and maybe one day harnessed. So instead of destroying it, they devised the button system, which caused the energy to be safely dispersed every 108 minutes, so it could be contained.   They did keep a back up plan though, with the failsafe key. That would blow it up and hopefully destroy the energy pocket with minimum damage.

Pushing the button didn't ""save the world,"" but it did prevent electromagnetic energy from building up to critical mass in the pocket underneath the Swan.

Locke thought he was right when the island stared destroying itself, but didn't know he was mortal until he bled when Jack punched him.   Flocke: looks like you were wrong. Jack: (punches flocke) looks like we were both wrong.   I think if the light had stayed out the.

The plan that was later shot to hell by all of Widmore's people dying?   Desmond makes the MiB mortal, but he also destroys the island, which isn't even a Pyrrhic victory. If the priority of the island was just to keep MiB in, then him drowning would be totally fine, just like the hatch blowing up.  As things stand destroying the island to kill him is cutting off your nose to spite your face. And you can't even guarantee his death because he can now leave at will.   So, was Widmore lying? Was Jacob? What's the point of lying if the lie is going to lead to the MiB finding Desmond and possibly getting away with destroying the island and leaving, killing everything?    Jacob had two jobs, he also had to stop MiB from trying to destroy the island/world   I just Netflixed the scene where Widmore talks to the MiB and later when MiB explains the situation to Ben. According to him Desmond is a fail-safe in case every candidate is killed to make sure MiB never leaves, presumably by unplugging the Source. So it seems that MiB can totally leave if there are no more candidates,he doesn't need to destroy the island. Jacob is the one actively moving the sink the island to prevent him from leaving, presumably because an immortal smoke monster that infects people with some strange disease just shouldn't be out there.  And that's where the seeming contradiction comes from. It seems that MiB leaving and the Island being destroyed are two separate but functionally equivalent doomday scenarios, so Desmond being a fail-safe in this way doesn't seem to make sense.   Now, we know what happened. Desmond unplugged the island, MiB died and someone plugged it back up. But is this the sort of plan anyone can count on? What if MiB was near the planes when it was unplugged? What if Jack never caught him? What if he killed Jack and Kate? The fact that it happened that way doesn't mean that it was the plan."

I'm assuming you've seen every episode now.   pushing the button. did ben know what the button did? why did he tell john it didn't do anything   Well, it's debatable what exactly Ben knew about the button, but it's clear he did indeed press it since everything didn't go to shit. What I would guess was that since The Others did have control of The Pearl station, they knew that station's objective was to moniter the Swan as a psych experiment. Ben probably thought the button was fake incorrectly because of this (like John later does), but pressed it anyway, in case not pressing it caused the experiment to end or something else unexpected. What is clear is that the reason he told John it doesn't do anything was because he was trying to get inside John's head.   the hydrogen bomb didn't work right? i mean all the sideway flashes aren't real?   If you are defining 'work' as Jack's plan to stop the incident and make Flight 815 never crash, then no it didn't work.   why does charles widmore remember that he saw john when he was 17 (when john was time travelling) the same way that desmond knew he met farday while others don't remember   What others don't remember?   how did mathew abbadon know that the plane was going to crash   Michael Abbadon worked for Widmore, who knew about John Locke because of John Locke's time travel adventures and how Locke was supposedly going to be this prophecized leader of The Others. I'm not sure what you mean by saying he knew the plan was going to crash?   where do the hsutles come from and how do they choose their leader   They come from all over the world. Whenever more people end up on the island, The Others will take the ones they like to add them to the group, and they will also recruit from the outside world (ex: Juliet).   what did farady do to himself and his gf? why can't he remember things and how does the island heal him   Two different things. Faraday just gives himself brain damage from steady radiation exposure over the years from conducting his experiments. This caused his memory issues. The island heals him because that's what the island tends to do. What happend to his girlfriend was Daniel tried his time travel experiment on her, which caused her to travel mentally back in forth through time like we see other characters (ex: Desmond). Widmore (as Daniel's backer) was able to spend lots of money to stabalize her in this state, so she wouldn't die like others did, but not cure her.   how come faraday's mom see the future?   Daniel wrote a journal of all his research into time travel, and into the Dharma initiative, and the island, and the general important events that he was experiencing throughout the years. Eventually he went back in time, and was killed by his mother. His mother found the journal, and was able to use it to know a lot of the future from her perspective (up to a point).   why did fake john sent richard to take the bullet of john who was sent to the future   Because John needed the medical treatment, and to be tricked into thinking he had to leave the island, convince people to come back, and to die.   what happened to all the ppl who survived the plane crash after ben moved the isalnd?   I'm not sure the best way to answer this? It's pretty much the entire plot of season 5. Unless you're asking what happened to all the background extras. If that's the case, in a very early episode, the group gets attacked by the others (the flaming arrow attack) and pretty much everyone is killed that isn't a main character.   i didn't understand the episode variables i thought what happended happened and nothign can be done to change it? so   Honestly, I got nothing on this one. Daniel frankly just didn't make sense, like you point out. But then it turns out hes wrong anyway (when the bomb doesn't work) so that makes sense. Just can't explain why he was thinking what he thought.   why do jack and every one else has differnet story jack didnt have a kid, why is saywer a cop? why is son pregnant?. i undersrand the desmond could be on the plane because he wasnt ont he isladn when they hydrogen bobm went off but what about the other why are their lifes differnet?   Now that you've seen the final episode this probably makes more sense, but the point is basically that their lives are different in ways that let them deal with the issues they didn't in life. Like Jack and his father issues, now he can be a better father than his dad.   when ben kidnapped alex he appeared younger than when he joined the others when he killed his dad in the car. why?   If he looked younger to you that would just be a coincidence, he kidnapped Alex a year after he killed his dad. Maybe his hair was just a bit longer from living with the Others or something? I'd have to compare pictures.   if sawyer didnt try to stop the bomb form goin off woult it have gone off?   Well, I guess technically we'll never know, but the implication is that no it wouldn't have. Or maybe it would have gone off, but everyone miraculously lives. (Compare to when Michael fails to kill himself, and Tom asks if the gun just didn't go off, or if the bullet just bounced off his head).    why did the others kill the darma initative ppl? i thought the werent murderers as ben reminded   The motto of this series can basically be ""Ben Lies"". The others killed them because they were trying to take too much of the island, they broke truces, and they became convinced there could be no peace with them.   Minkowski death, how did it happen?   He killed himself.   what happended to desmond and what was his mission that charles talked about   You'll have to be more specific.   what are the ways that kepp the monster out   Ring of ash, sonic fence. That's about it I think.   why didn't the man in black kill Mr.Eko the first time yet he killed him the 2nd time (I'm thinking that he doesnt kill ppl randomly, if so why does he kill?)   The man in black wanted to manipulate Eko, basically make him a willing servant (basically what he ends up doing with Locke), by abusing his love for and guilt towards his brother Yemi. When that doesn't work, the man in black has no further use for him and kills him.    why didnt widmore get banished from the island   He did get banished.   why didn't ben,sun and others experience time travel   Eloise said there would be side effects if they didn't mimic the original flight closely enough. These were the side effects.    why did richard take john locke (man in balck) to see jacob when he wasn't invited   To put it simply, the political climate wasn't one that gave Richard the option to say no. The others had been making a big deal for awhile about this guy Locke and how the island had healed him more than anything it had before, and how he was already basically prophecized to be their leader... and then he appears back to them out of no where and starts telling everyone he's here to lead and he's going to take them to Jacob and all that. The others are all aboard the Locke hype train, Richard couldn't really say no. And he's curious himself anyway.   did jacob choose to bring all the ppl on the plane? and how does he do that? isn't the reason the plane crashed not pushing the button? it has nothing to do with jacob.   I don't know if he chose every single person. But the people he brings he just does by manipulating events to cause them to come. He's basically this greatly powerful immortal demigod after all. The plane crashed because the button wasn't pushed. But Jacob could be the one who managed to influence events to lead to the button not being pushed.   how come hugo talks to dead ppl   There's magic in this world. Some people just have powers. This is Hugo's power.   why couldn't sayid kill the man in black wehn he stabbed him   Because he's and immortal smoke creature. Dagger's don't really do shit. He lost his actual body centuries ago.   how come jacob and his brother neve age   Because they are immortal. Jacob because of his role as the island's protector. His brother because he's a magical smoke creature."
lost,3ah7op,SageOfTheWise,6,Sat Jun 20 07:51:28 2015 UTC,"continued:   how was the man in black body near his mother when he appeared talking with jacob about the ship that was comin to the island   The dead body is his real human body, now he's an incorporeal smoke creature that can take the shape of people, so he can take the shape of his old self.   why did the woman kill the twin's mother and why did she want them to stay on the islnd   Because she needed the babies and not her. She wanted the babies so one could eventually be the protector of the island instead of her.   why can they remember thigs in the sideway flashes and why can desmond know about them   They remember things when they have a kind of strong emotional connection to some important part of their real lives, usually relating to getting over some problem of theirs they never did in real life. Desmond in the real timeline managed to cross over briefly in a crazy electromagnetic near death experience.   why does richard and jacob agree to the all bad things that the others do   The point of the others is basically to show that a humanity, without any outside rules governing them, will still be innately good. Telling them to not do a bad thing defeats the purpose.   why cant the man in black kill the canidates   It's just something he can't do.   why did the man in black turn to a black smoke when jacob sent him to thr light   It's just what happens.   what did both jack and the man in black think about what was gonna happen when desmond went to the heart of the island and why didn't john turn to black smoke when he was fighting jack and why did he get effected by the bullet   Jack thought it would expose a weakness that would let them kill the man in black, man in black thought it would destroy the island letting him leave. Turns out they were both right. It basically shut down the islands magical power, causing the island to fall apart, and also making the man in black mortal. Meaning he couldn't just be a smoke monster any more, and he could be killed just like anyone else.   why did ben want to get back to the island and why did he take john lock body with him (did he know?) and why do they have all to come back so it happens?   Ben wants to go back to the island to atone for getting is daughter killed, and because its the place he's known almost all of his life. He took Locke with him because they had to to get the plane trip to work right.   why didn't jacob want anybody to lave the island   Because he brought them there for a reason. For most of the main characters specifically it was so one could replace him.   the sideway flashes (the last scene between jack and his father) i don't understand how did lost end now? the   His father revealed that the flash sideways was some kind of afterlife. When you die, you go to this place outside of time, with all the people in your life that were most important, and you work out the issues you  never did in life and remember your pas life, before moving onto whatever the next phase in the afterlife is.   sideway flashes are not real? and everyone had died?   They aren't real in the sense they are the afterlife. But the afterlife is still technically real, in the context of the show. Everything else on the show was real though. The island, the flash backs, the off island stuff, all real. Everyone dies because everyone is mortal. Some people died on the show (ex: Jack), some people presumably went on to live long lives and only died decades later from old age (ex: Kate).   does desmond get off the island? and why did he turn off the light of the island heart isnt that what the monster wanted it?   Yeah almost certainly. No reason he wouldn't get off. He turned off the light because he thought it would take him back to the flash sideways world.   how does ben summon the monster?   He doesn't really. It's a trick. The monster just comes when Ben tries to summon to make Ben and the others think the monster is something that can be controlled, when it really isn't.   are sawyer, kate, miles, frank, and richard the only survivors?   Hurely, Ben, Claire, Desmond, Bernard, Rose, Aaron, and of course, Vincent. (Am I missing anyone?)   last question am i stupid for asking all these questions?   Not really"
lost,3ah7op,SageOfTheWise,3,Sat Jun 20 07:51:38 2015 UTC,"Hurely, Ben, Claire, Desmond, Bernard, Rose, Aaron, and of course, Vincent. (Am I missing anyone?)   Lostpedia on its Survivors page also lists Cindy Chandler, Emma, and Zach."
lost,3ah7op,stef_bee,3,Sat Jun 20 14:47:30 2015 UTC,"Well done. I just have a few things I'd like to add to your answers or alternate takes to give the OP.   Hurely, Ben, Claire, Desmond, Bernard, Rose, Aaron, and of course, Vincent. (Am I missing anyone?)   If you're counting Aaron, then be sure to count Walt and Ji Yeon. And there were a bunch of other Others that seemed to survive the last attack that fled into the jungle. As stef_bee mentioned, it looked like Cindy, Zach, and Emma all survived at the very least.  Now:  Re: Minkowski's death - He didn't commit suicide. He was a scientist who was exposed to some amount of electromagnetism before he came to the island, so when he and his friend Brandon tried to see the island up close in the Zodiac raft, they accidentally approached the island on the wrong bearing. This caused his mind to start shifting like Desmond's did in ""The Constant"". And he just never managed to find a suitable constant for himself, so his brain hemorrhaged because it couldn't figure out what era he was in.  Re: Hawking's knowledge of the future - While it's possible that Daniel's journal could have given Hawking certain knowledge, it can't have given her all of the foresight that she displays throughout the show. Daniel's journal wouldn't have contained any mention of the man in red shoes dying, or how he would have died if Hawking had warned him, or that Desmond decides not to buy an engagement ring for Penny on that day, or that Desmond would decide against buying a ring for Penny specifically because of his doubts. She clearly demonstrates knowledge beyond what Daniel's journal could have told her.  Some have theorized that Jacob visited her and spoke with her, and this is how she knew the things that the journal couldn't have told her. Some have theorized that after she woke up in the Season 5 finale, she was close enough to the Incident site to get blasted by a failsafe-level of electromagnetism, causing her to see the future just like how it caused Desmond to start seeing the future. It could go either way.  Re: Faraday's variable theory - I like to imagine that Faraday realized that the bomb had to be detonated at the Swan site, and that this was going to be an essential part of the Incident. But the only way he could convince people in such short time to take the bomb to the Swan site was to claim the variable theory would work to change time and everything. No one would have gone through with it if they thought they were just fulfilling the past, and Daniel did need the help. Of course, Daniel does seem very convincing; it looks like he really believes the variable theory (and his flash-sideways self definitely seems to believe something akin to it), but since it doesn't absolutely have to be true, I'm head-canon-ing this one.  Re: Ben lying about the Others not being murderers because of the Purge - Keep in mind that Ben wasn't the leader of the Others at the time of the Purge. That was Widmore. And Widmore claimed that Jacob himself ordered the Purge. So either this was a rare exception where Jacob wanted DHARMA gone, Widmore himself just wanted DHARMA gone and used Jacob as an excuse, or the MIB posed as Jacob to Widmore (just as the MIB would later do to Locke via Christian) and told Widmore that Jacob wanted DHARMA dead.  Re: the special people's powers - The show tells us that every person has some amount of the light within their bodies. The show also tells us that the light is an amalgamation of electromagnetism and exotic matter. And the show also shows us that everything the special people do relates back to one of the abilities of electromagnetism or exotic matter. So a strong conclusion would be that the special people have more of the light that exists inside of everybody than normal people do, or they are just naturally better at tapping into it in order to utilize those abilities.  Re: how the MIB was transformed into a smoke monster - The electromagnetic radiation from the Source killed his body, but preserved or copied his consciousness. So the MIB's consciousness now existed free of any body, but was fused with/connected to the Source. He had all the powers of electromagnetism, so the first thing he did was try to quickly build a new body for himself. This new body looked like black smoke. (More than likely it's a bunch of iron filings or something of that nature, which, when suspended by magnetic forces does really give the appearance of a cloud of black smoke.)  Re: why the MIB can't kill the candidates - Jacob has the ability to manipulate the island's electromagnetism. Since the MIB is now fused with the island's electromagnetism, Jacob can manipulate the MIB to some extent. So Jacob is able to change the electromagnetism in such a way that it prevents the MIB from killing the candidates. These are the Rules. Jacob didn't want to take away any of the MIB's humanity, but he also didn't want the MIB endangering the Earth by being let off the island, which would cause the Source to be extinguished. So he made a Rule that the MIB couldn't leave the island. This naturally made the MIB want to kill Jacob, because if Jacob was dead the rule would no longer be active, so Jacob had to make some new rules too: 1) the MIB can't kill Jacob, 2) Jacob is going to pick some new people to become the protector after he leaves the job, and the MIB can't leave the island while any of these people are alive, and 3) the MIB can't kill any of these new people either. This would allow the candidates to decide what to do with the MIB once Jacob finally gave up his position.  Re: the flash-sideways as an afterlife - It could be argued to be semantics, but I just wanted to also assert the interpretation that the flash-sideways is not actually an afterlife but rather a separate realm that a person experiences during their dying moments. Your consciousness enters the flash-sideways as you start dying, and then your consciousness leaves the flash-sideways once you die. So any afterlife you go to would be post-flash-sideways."

lost,3afwbr,Fats33,2,Fri Jun 19 21:54:11 2015 UTC,"Pretty much this.  Locke was a man of faith, and faith is all about believing. Is there even a point to try to convince a non-believer? It sounds like I'm going on some religious debate here, but I'm not. Locke throughout the show never tries to force others to believe what he does. He suggests that the island is special, something he truly believes, and leaves it at that. Everyone has to find their own way.  In regards to what OP said about Kate, what does it matter? It was this part in the show that I truly hated Kate, because she shows absolutely no compassion or care for the hardships Locke goes through. And while Jack was certainly an unbeliever, I could almost argue Kate is worse. Jack goes full Locke by the end of the show, and Kate's just... there. I don't think she ever had any love for the island or believed it was something special."

I feel like people are way too drunk on loving Locke to think about this rationally whatsoever. If you were in Kate's position there's literally 0 chance that you would humor Locke. You landed on an island after a plane crash, and this crazy guy just ruins every attempt to survive/escape with his dumb bullshit (breaking the radio, blowing up the Hatch, blowing up the Submarine, and...) and then he tried to murder another human being, Naomi, when she was trying to rescue them. And fun fun, Naomi reacts by almost killing Kate before dying.   So I think if you were Kate, you'd prooooobably think Locke's a fucking lunatic, let alone a murderer and I don't believe you'd humor his idea for you to leave your child and return with him to the island he repeatedly trapped you on."

I agree, Kate would probably be a realistic approach on how someone would speak to Locke irl.  However, this is a show, not real life. We as the viewers get the benefit of seeing the whole picture, whereas the survivors don't. Because of this, we know that Locke was right in what he did and Kate wasn't. For me it's just aggravating that Kate is so wrong but doesn't see that. That's all I'm saying.  By the way, I would totally still be team-Locke if I was a survivor!"

lost,3af5zo,MindToss,6,Fri Jun 19 19:26:28 2015 UTC,"It's a fine theory, I still think it's (almost) all MIB. Here is my own reasons on that. First, the bodies. It's just as feasible that MIB got rid of it. Anywhere. We can compare why this would happen in this situation, but not in some other major ones. With Christian, Jack is too rational a man to accept any of this if he can find even the slightest hint it's not true. Him finding a body would be just that. It's got to be gotten rid of. Also I imagine more to the point, getting rid of the body when possible would just be standard to him. With Yemi, there is no reason to. Eko doesn't need to be tricked into thinking his brother is alive. He's all into this spiritual stuff. Then later with Locke's body, there's just no opportunity. Its with the plane and all these survivors, in a casket and all. He has no way to get to it and get it somewhere else without being really obvious. Best thing is to not draw attention to it. He's only going to be with those survivors for like a day and then it doesn't matter what they find.  For his appearances throughout the show, I think I can say it's easily feasible that all his on island appearances are MiB without having to explain each one. The important ones that people always bring up are Christian's appearance on the freighter, Christian's appearance at Jack's work, and the time travel one. So first, with the freighter. People say this can't be MIB because it's technically off island, and MIB can't leave the island. My point is that he can't leave the islands realm of influence. This extends into the water a ways as we see in the show. If he legitimately couldn't leave the island, he wouldn't be able to go to Hydra island for one. We also see how people like Daniel and Jin, despite being out in the Ocean, right by the freighter, are still in the island's realm of influence as they time travel with the rest of the island. So I think it makes sense MIB can extend just as far.  For Jack's work, I believe the answer is simply, that's not MIB. It's really Christian. And here's my evidence for this. Hurley tells us that ghost Charlie told him a ghost would be coming to visit Jack. Given what we know about Hurley by the end of the show, we all know that Charlie is like legitimately Charlie and all that. So when he tells us another ghost character is coming, and then someone dead shows up, pretty much means he has to be a ghost. If it was anything else, how would Charlie know about it, and why would he describe it like that? This is also why Jack is only able to see Christian for a split second, he's not gifted with this sight like Hurley is, barely see's it at all. This is the only time he appears off island after his death. I don't think you're right about there being several.  Ok lastly, the Time Travel one. This one takes a bit more hypothesizing than the rest, but certainly no more than alternative theories like yours do. This wheel chamber, during the time the wheel is off it's hinge, its the nexus of really unstable time related energy. There's already weird time travel discrepancies happening with it that have nothing to do with MIB's appearance there. Simply put, when goes down there, it's right during a flash that sends the rest of the group to the far past (complete statue and all). But Locke can't have gone to this time, simply because if he did, the wheel wouldn't be all crazy unhinged in that time. He must have gone to a time post- Ben messing it up. For narrative convenience, probably sometime during that 3 year gap. It's a direct part of MIB's plan that Locke will eventually make it to that room, all he has to do is wait for him to eventually show up. And we see what happens when he does.  You bring up a point that MIB said he turned into Christian to help them. And since it's obviously bullshit since he wasn't helping him (I'd agree so far), then he must not be Christian. I think that's too big a leap. It's the same thing MIB has always done, part lie part truth. He was Christian, but he was only doing it to help himself, just as he always has. Just how he's always lied to the survivors about his motivations and why he's doing the things he's doing and making it sound like everyone can just leave the island with him, when really he's just planning for himself.  You also bring up that in the purgatory section, Christian acted all knowing and special and not stunned. I'd say we merely don't see that part. Could have happened any time ago. Similar to Eloise, who has long figured out the nature of the place by the time we see her. Christian exhibits no more elevated knowledge of the world then any of the other characters do, once they are post awakening. We just don't get long talks with the other characters about the nature of the world like we do with Christian. Everyone seems to know exactly what's going on and why they're going to the church. Jack is the only exception here, since he is so stubborn.   But hey, this is just what I think."

I agree that its plausible the MiB just got rid of the body; my problem is that I can't understand why he would. As someone else stated upthread, it would have served the MiB's purpose far better for them to all die of thirst. I can't imagine what end of the MiB this whole encounter would have served.    For his appearances throughout the show, I think I can say it's easily feasible that all his on island appearances are MiB without having to explain each one.    I think each one needs to be explained, though. If it's the MiB, he's obviously got a plan. He's not going to make random/needless appearances. Why does he want Vincent to wake up Jack?    The important ones that people always bring up are Christian's appearance on the freighter, Christian's appearance at Jack's work, and the time travel one. So first, with the freighter. People say this can't be MIB because it's technically off island, and MIB can't leave the island.    I don't doubt the MiB could physically appear there if he wanted to. I just don't think it was the MiB and I don't think his appearing to Michael makes any sense. Why is he telling Michael he can go now?    For Jack's work, I believe the answer is simply, that's not MIB. It's really Christian.   He gets a glimpse of Christian in a hallway. It could be Christian or it could be someone else. As for why would Charlie talk like that? Maybe it's a metaphor, maybe it's a him not understanding exactly what Christian is.    Ok lastly, the Time Travel one.    I agree that that's a fine theory for why the MiB could appear there at that time and this, I think, is one of the few times where it actually being the MiB would make some sense, because it sends Locke off to his death, so he can come back, etc. etc.  For me, then, this is more a question of interpretation.  I believe Christian is the representative of the Island and, while this part of his actions move MiB's plan forward, it's still for the purpose of forcing a conflict.    You bring up a point that MIB said he turned into Christian to help them. And since it's obviously bullshit since he wasn't helping him (I'd agree so far), then he must not be Christian. I think that's too big a leap.    That's not really what I said. Obviously the MiB lies. It's not that he said he was helping them and he wasn't, it's that Christian was actually being helpful the majority of the time, something that the MiB has no motive to do.    You also bring up that in the purgatory section, Christian acted all knowing and special and not stunned.    Again, this is obviously a part that can be interpeted multiple ways.   I appreciate your response! I think you raise some good points.  My main sticking point with your view, however, is the same as the one that motivated my above theory:  most of the time, Christian actually is being helpful. The MiB has no discernible reason, that I can see, for wanting Jack to wake up and save the other survivors, or for showing Jack to water, or for a lot of the other things Christian does. Again, it's not that he says he's helping and really isn't, it's that if this were the MiB, he'd actually be helping them, which doesn't make any sense to me. Same with him appearing to Michael - the MiB has no reason to do that."
lost,3af5zo,SageOfTheWise,2,Fri Jun 19 20:06:17 2015 UTC,"I don't have time to make a full response to this yet, but I would point out that while you could interpret the Christian/Jack stuff as him helping the survivors find water and shelter (as MIB would love you to think), you could also interpret it as MIB driving a candidate loopy enough to run off a cliff to his death (as Jack actually does, and only gets narrowly saved by Locke)."
lost,3af5zo,Derpatologist_7,2,Fri Jun 19 20:13:07 2015 UTC,"I would love a full response when you have time, because I love these conversations.   That's a fair point regarding making a candidate loopy enough to run off a cliff.  My problem, again, is that each appearance of Christian has to be accounted for and while you can make an argument for individual appearances of Christian being the MiB, it still doesn't make sense as a whole.   Why, for example, did Christian tell Vincent to wake up Jack? If he simply wanted Jack to die, and didn't have greater plans for him, why would the MiB help him regain consciousness?   My other feeling is that a ruse like that would be against the ""rules"" Jacob and the MiB have. The MiB can't kill candidates without proving they aren't worthy to be candidates, like he did with Mr. Eko. It's part of their little social experiment. If he could just lead a candidate off a cliff, I feel like that would have shown up a bit more throughout the show. It's not like there weren't plenty of times where candidates were chasing apparitions through the jungle."

My interpretation of these interactions such as Kate/horse and Eko/Yemi is that they are tests by the MiB to try and ""disqualify"" candidates. A huge theme of the show was the ""blank slate"". Whether these people could take this chance to start over. Tabula Rasa, the baptism references throughout, etc. People who couldn't let go of their baggage weren't qualified candidates.   The MiB tested Kate with the horse and she accepted her mistakes but showed she was willing to put them behind her, she remained a candidate, and remained protected by Jacob and the MiB's rules.   With Eko, alternatively, he steadfastly refused to put his past behind him. He embraced it. ""I did my best"" and all that. He didn't accept the blank slate and wasn't qualified to be the Protector and was therefore, no longer a candidate.

lost,3af5zo,Derpatologist_7,1 point,Sat Jun 20 04:30:17 2015 UTC,"The most compelling argument I can think for Dave being MiB is that at Santa Rosa, Dave is pretty benign.  Sure, he's a smart-ass; encourages Hurley to eat (which Hurley wants to do anyway), and tries to get him to ""escape"" (which as I see it, Hurley is most likely a voluntary patient and could leave anytime he wanted.)  He never says anything mean about Hurley being fat.  On-Island Dave, on the other hand, is really malign.  He does everything he can to undermine Hurley's sense of reality; mocks him about Libby, and has to trick him into stepping off a cliff.  (Hurley clearly says that he doesn't want to commit suicide, and MiB can't directly kill the candidates.)  Like we said earlier about MiB's purposes being served if the castaways died of thirst, similarly, MiB's purpose is served if Hurley kills himself.  Just my take on it, though."

Two questions: one pertains to a Christian Shepherd interaction, the other something completely different.    What about when Lapidus and Sun meet Christian? Do you think that's the island or MiB? I ask this question for a reason since during that scene you see the door swing open and black smoke waft through. Thoughts? Harper appearing to Juliet telling her to kill Faraday and Charlotte. MiB, Island or Harper? Thoughts?"
lost,3af5zo,stef_bee,1 point,Sat Jun 20 02:08:37 2015 UTC,"Haha well I appreciate that.   As for those two interactions:  Regarding the one with Lapidus and Sun, I still think it's Island Christian. There is the dark mist, which could be a red herring, or it could be the MiB observing the conversation. Christian shows Sun that Jin is alive but stuck in the past and then tells them to wait for Locke. It's been a while since I've watched the last couple seasons, but I believe my theory at this point is that traveling with Locke allowed Sun to see his corpse and tell the others when she rejoined them in season 6. Again, I can't imagine why the MiB would have needed her with him other than good conversation, but like I said, my memory is a bit hazy on this segment of the show.   As for Harper, I believe that was the MiB. IIRC, she claimed to be sent by Ben which was likely impossible due to his imprisonment and, if they had listened to her, everyone on the Island would have died, including candidates.   Like I said, my memory is hazy so feel free to poke holes into any of this."

This also supports your idea.  When Michael is in NYC, he tries to kill himself multiple times.  Tom actually provides a pretty big ""reveal"" for Season Four: Michael can't kill himself, at least not until the Island is done with him.    Whatever Tom is (Ben's stooge; willing kidnapper of women, etc), I don't think Tom is working for, or in any communion with MiB at all.  Everything the show has been telling us up to this point is that the Others do have some odd connection with the Island, and indirectly with Jacob, through Richard.  Yet Tom and freighter-Christian don't only tell Michael pretty much the same thing; they actually appear to be tag-teaming or working together."
lost,3af5zo,_Mr_Fahrenheit_,2,Sat Jun 20 02:29:02 2015 UTC,That's a great point regarding Tom. I had forgotten about his conversations with Michael off island and I agree that there is no reason to think he's working with the MiB
lost,3af5zo,_Mr_Fahrenheit_,1 point,Sat Jun 20 04:21:43 2015 UTC,"I agree. I think though he simply was the pre-Locke. Jack brought his dad to the island and the MiB took on the appearance of jacks dad. When Jack brought dead loche back. MiB took on loches appearance. But Jacob engineered jack to come to the island, he then engineered him to bring dead loche back. Basically not only did he engineer his own death, he engineered his brothers appearance and ultimate. Death and his successor.  Lost is amazing."
lost,3af5zo,stef_bee,1 point,Fri Jun 19 19:33:28 2015 UTC,"The MiB claims that he used Christian’s form to “help” the survivors. I’m just flat-out calling bullshit on this.   I agree.  I was rolling my eyes all the way through that conversation in Season Six between Jack and fake-Locke.  ""You needed water.""  MiB's purposes would have been far better served if the survivors had all died of thirst within a week.   He used Claire, and left her susceptible to the MiB.    If that's so, then the Island is monstrously cruel. Whoever took Claire separated her from Aaron; left Aaron to die; and subjected her to three years of loneliness, privation, and suffering (none of which she deserved.)   (still re: Claire) The survivors could not travel to the Source on their own, as we know. Having Claire as bait allowed the MiB to lead the other survivors to the Source, which was necessary for their final showdown.   I'm a bit confused by this.  In ""The End,"" when fake-Locke went to the Source, he was only able to go there because Jack did (Jack was Protector by this time, which meant that Jack could access the Source and could take people there with him.)  Going on about Claire, though:  If you meant that Claire was needed to get everybody back to the Island, I can see your point. Jack was hell-bent on getting off the Island after he parted ways with Locke at the broken fuselage (in the beginning of Season Four.)  That's why Jack went back to the beach.  Then Jack got appendicitis, which Rose pretty clearly suggested was because Jack was doing something the Island didn't want him to do.  Also, in Season Four, when Jack, Hurley, Sun, Aaron, etc are all on board the chopper, headed for the freighter, Hurley makes a point to say to Jack, something like ""We're gonna drop these people off and go back for Claire, right?""  Jack agrees.  They can't, though, because the Island disappears.  Are you possibly saying that had Jack stayed on the Island as he ws supposed to (which I personally do believe is the case), there would have been no need to take Claire?  Poor Claire, in that case.  I can't really see too many holes in this, right now."

Are you possibly saying that had Jack stayed on the Island as he ws supposed to (which I personally do believe is the case), there would have been no need to take Claire?   I think she was there as a sort of insurance, or bait. Jack, at the time he left the Island, was not ready to become its Protector. Without leaving and realizing he needed to come back, who's to say that he would have been ready to stop the MiB?"

When it came to the scene where he is doing pull-ups I thought it was possibly a Sawyer flash back, yet I kept thinking it was in the 1970s by the decor so maybe it wasn't sawyer. Then I noticed the modern looking washing machine and dryer and thought to myself, wtf... Then... Them the BOOM and the suspenseful music starts and our unknown character goes into emergency mode.

lost,3a94w0,sean7755,11,Thu Jun 18 05:22:20 2015 UTC,"'Heavens to Murgatroyd' is American in origin and dates from the mid 20th century. The expression was popularized by the cartoon character Snagglepuss - a regular on the Yogi Bear Show in the 1960s, and is a variant of the earlier 'heavens to Betsy'.  The first use of the phrase wasn't by Snagglepuss but comes from the 1944 film Meet the People. It was spoken by Bert Lahr, best remembered for his role as the Cowardly Lion in The Wizard of Oz. Snagglepuss's voice was patterned on Lahr's, along with the 'heavens to Murgatroyd' line. Daws Butler's vocal portrayal of the character was so accurate that when the cartoon was used to promote Kellogg Cereals, Lahr sued and made the company distance him from the campaign by giving a prominent credit to Butler.  As with Betsy, we have no idea who Murgatroyd was. The various spellings of the name - as Murgatroid, Mergatroyd or Mergatroid tend to suggest that it wasn't an actual surname. While it is doubtful that the writers of Meet The People (Sig Herzig and Fred Saidy) were referring to an actual person, they must have got the name from somewhere.  No fewer than ten of the characters in Gilbert and Sullivan's comic opera Ruddigore, 1887, are baronets surnamed ""Murgatroyd"", eight of whom (or is that which?) are ghosts. Herzig and Saidy were well versed in the works of the musical theatre and that plethora of Murgatroyds would have been known to them.  Where then did the librettist Sir William Gilbert get the name? It seems that Murgatroyd has a long history as a family name in the English aristocracy. In his genealogy The Murgatroyds of Murgatroyd, Bill Murgatroyd states that, in 1371, a constable was appointed for the district of Warley in Yorkshire. He adopted the name of Johanus de Morgateroyde - literally John of Moor Gate Royde or 'the district leading to the moor'.  Whether the Murgatroyd name took that route from Yorkshire to Jellystone Park we can't be certain. Unless there's a Betsy Murgatroyd hiding in the archives, that's as close as we are likely to get to a derivation.  http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/heavens-to-murgatroyd.html"

Possibly some other years too.   is the same thing that happened to desmond gonna start happening to all pepole?   Desmond was a special case. The thing that happened to Desmond only happens when people who are exposed to extremely large amounts of electromagnetism try to cross the barrier around the island on the wrong bearing. So as long as no one on-island tries to leave the island on the wrong bearing, they'll be fine. And if they do try to leave the island on the wrong bearing, only those who have been exposed to extremely high levels of electromagnetism will experience what happened to Desmond.   how did jin appear in season 4 in the flashforward?   He didn't. That was a mislead. Jin's portion of that episode was a flashback. Sun's portion of that episode was a flashforward. At the end of the episode it showed Sun and Hurley visiting Jin's grave (which had written on it that Jin died 9/22/2004, the date of the Oceanic crash, so Sun has been telling everyone that he died in the plane crash)."

lost,3a4q8u,Jobcv314,8,Wed Jun 17 05:25:26 2015 UTC,"There's a few things we have to keep in mind when discussing this problem:  1) Dr. Candle mentions in the unedited video that using the computer in any way other than entering the code could lead to an incident. The implication here is that some time in DHARMA's past, someone did use the computer in some inappropriate way, and this led to an incident (note that the blast door map mentions that another incident occurred in 1985, so Chang may not be talking about the 1977 incident in the video; DHARMA uses the word ""incident"" for all sorts of catastrophes). So if having a person input the code is the best way to avoid an incident, it could be a huge mistake to automate it.  2) If the button-inputting mechanism was automated, it would make it far less likely for DHARMA to keep an eye on the station, which would mean DHARMA would allocate most of their security elsewhere, which would allow the Others, the MIB, or whoever to get into the station and destroy the mechanism, leading to a system failure before DHARMA realizes what has happened and has time to run fix it.  3) As already mentioned, if the Swan was automated, that would have defeated the purpose of the Pearl. The Pearl station only worked because they believed that the Swan station occupants were part of a psychology experiment to see if people would continue to press a button that does nothing if they were told it was of the utmost importance. Take away the button pressing, and the Pearl has no other stations it can look to to observe someone else doing something in a detabably experimental environment (unless you count the polar bears and the fish biscuits)."
lost,3a4q8u,Petrichor02,2,Wed Jun 17 14:10:09 2015 UTC,"Thank you!  Number 2 is the ONLY good reason I've ever heard for not automating the process.  I didn't really follow your number 1, and number 3 could be just as easily accomplished with a dummy terminal.  But number 2 could actually be a reason for keeping people there.  I'd argue that it's a huge stretch, since again a dummy terminal would be almost as effective, but at least it makes some sort of sense."

lost,3a4q8u,Delphiantares,2,Wed Jun 17 06:26:29 2015 UTC,"True. But it still doesn't make sense to me that they didn't automate the process. Why the need for someone to physically walk over an push a button when it's a few mins to zero makes little sense.   Keep in mind also since they for SOME reason chose NOT to automate the process, this ultimately lead to the destruction of the swan station. Because my thinking now is that the other stations were set up really to monitor The Swan and make sure they were alive and well, since we know that if they weren't he button wouldn't be pushed and the island might be destroyed. But since years later to people like John Locke and others this whole thing looked like some exercise or experiment in psychology to monitor two lab rats John ultimately didn't believe the danger was real. So again you'd think they would have at least a backup automated system that would kick in if it dropped below a certain number and reset the system. I'm starting to believe this is a plot-hole that the show didn't cover or missed explaining.  EDIT: spelling (grr autocorrection)"

I mean, considering it's a tv show and I'm assuming the writers had SOME reasoning behind why some things are how they were. (It's a very well written show, so I'm hoping most of the things left unanswered were because they didn't think it that important to cover in the show, and not because they made it up last minute as they went along kind of thing etc).  What I found online is this;  ""*...In Access: Granted, a special feature on the Lost: The Complete Third Season (DVD) Blu-ray edition, the reason for the numbers needing to be entered by humans and not by an automated process is explained:  Damon Lindelof: I think the idea of sort of trusting the machine, what if the power goes out, or what if the station gets taken over by the hostiles? You know, it absolutely had to be manned by human beings. The producers later clarified that the turning of the key by Desmond prevented a potential ""global catastrophe.""*""  In fairness to the writers though, this is a bad reason if it's true. You staff a underground bunker with only two people who rotate turns to monitor a button and push it every 108 minutes? Automate it and have an alarm go off if it isn't pushed automatically. Also if the power goes out they'll know because the bunker will be staffed around the clock regardless. Seems that IRL this would be automated and staff would still be there just in case. And what if the hostiles took over the place? So? If this could potentially cause a worldwide problem does this mean if the hostiles take over it's better that nobody push the button and the bunker is destroyed?"

LOST is without a doubt one of the most unique shows of all time and will stay with me for the rest of my life.  1) First off, the music. Michael Giacchino does a phenomenal job with the music in LOST. The show wouldn't be nearly as emotional or intense without the music.  Just listen to ""Life and Death"", ""Locke'd Out Again"", or ""Moving On"". It's just incredible.  2) As mentioned by OP, the development of characters is unparalleled by any other show that's been on TV. You really get to feel for the characters and relate to most of them. Though some shows have flashbacks of characters, not many could be successful doing it in almost EVERY episode. Each flashback relates to what is happening on the island at that time, which goes to show just how incredible the writing of LOST really was.  3) It has ""something"" for everyone, if you will. Who wouldn't love LOST. There's suspense and love, some would argue it's a little scary at times, revenge, plenty of comedy, not to mention elements of unpredictable mystery, mythology and sci-fi. Each episode is very different and each character shows signs of each of these aspects throughout the entirety of the show.  4) Most importantly, it's very unpredictable. I've seen the series 3 times now (on my 4th watch now) and I can't tell you how many times I've gotten to a reveal or an answer to a mystery and thought to myself ""how the hell did they think of this"", it's pretty incredible. You never know what to expect and most times it's nothing that you could've expected or guessed. But it works with the story. The more and more I watch, the more and more I believe every single scene is as important as the previous. Oftentimes you may think that the dialogue you're witnessing doesn't make any sense but later understand that it was the most important part of the episode. That is really just the genius of J.J. Abrams, Damon Lindelof, Carlton Cuse and Jeffrey Lieber.                                       ""Kate, she said we were leaving"" ""No, not leaving. Moving on."""

With the flashbacks, you learn about what drives their decisions, and then when you see them make those decisions, you understand why they act that way even if you don't agree with them. In other shows you've got the bad guys/good guys, but on Lost you know people don't have just one side to them (except Keamy that fucking jerk).

What no other show has been able to match for me was the characters."

In regards to why they don't kill Ben, it's probably an island-voodoo thing, but this might help illuminate why he wasn't the worst guy ever.  From that link, here's the counterargument to Ben just being a murderous douche:  ""Everything Ben does is in the best interest of the Island and is to serve a greater good. While he has murdered people in cold blood, and is a pathological liar, it is all to protect the Island. Much like the wizard (the man behind the curtain) in ""The Wizard of Oz,"" Ben is a liar but has good intentions for doing so. Any of his wrong deeds can be blamed on either the Island's will, or the greater good."""

Thereby, the last three Seasons may be differential in terms of storytelling and mythological portraying than the first three Seasons. Also, Seasons 4, 5 and 6 might feel to cause, for some viewers, the overall story fluency  to suffer and harder to follow due to the series complexity.   But, the fact that the writers could finally work towards something, the ""filler episodes"", such as ""Stranger in a Strange Land"", was happily never to be found again in LOST in the series last three Seaons.  Seasons 4 and 5 were mind-bending Seasons, with brilliantly written episodes and especially entertaining to watch.

That doesn't make my interpretation wrong, however.  The show revolves around science and faith.  Faith requires no evidence.  Science is based on observation and the fact that there is an explanation for everything, we just don't always have all the data to know what that explanation is.

To do so would probably make Jack decide that everything Hugo says, even about the numbers, is something that he has worked into his delusions since being on the Island.   In other words, Jack knows that Hurley took Rousseau's papers.  Jack has no reason to believe Hugo out of hand that he even saw the numbers before he saw them on the papers.  Also, Jack has no reason to believe Hugo about the lottery win (we've already seen Charlie mock Hugo about that; Charlie doesn't believe it either.)  Later, in ""Something Nice Back Home,"" 4x10, Jack clearly treats Hugo as if he's completely delusional, and does the ""normal,""  medically-responsible, scientific thing: just says, ""Hurley, take your meds.""  However, what you say about Ethan and the ""There are no Others"" nonsense is perfectly true.   I would have expected better from Sayid and Jack, especially as Ethan wasn't on the manifest and he clearly was the one who kidnapped Claire.  On a related point, what irked me is how non-communicative people on the beach were. I understand that the creative team did that to slow down the story ""reveals,"" but it still irked me.

lost,39uszz,Orhunuss,1 point,Mon Jun 15 15:24:24 2015 UTC,"I agree.   [Angry Spoilers From All Over The Place(Literally All 6 Seasons)]   Whenever a character said ""I don't have time to explain"", that character almost always had the time to explain. Whenever a character said ""You wouldn't understand"" you knew that the other character could understand. Whenever there was an explanation, it simply created a need for other multiple explanations until the whole series went ""resolution mode"" in the 5th season after losing the ability to maintain the now-uncontrollably large fractals of mysteries. An example of the first couple of things I complained about is Locke. Locke keeps his unpleasantly arrogant guru attitude for ever, and his condescending way of speech combined with the ambiguity of his words simply drives the viewer insane. His flashbacks are equally unbearable: Unlike Christian, who becomes an interesting ""flashback hub"", Locke is simply a character with too dense of a history which I've found uninteresting. He is a unique combination of mediocre acting and bad writing and it's a shame that he kinda takes over the role of Ben who is a unique combination of incredible acting and great writing. As for other characters, Michael's obsession with Walt and his annoying disregard for the value of everyone else's lives is simply unrealistic given the lack of attachment between him and his son as well as the low tendency of such a ""survivor"" to actually value one life over dozens as intensely as he did. He basically screamed ""Waoooaaoaaooolddddt!"" for 2 seasons and did a little favor before he finally died.  People's overall skepticism towards the existence of others, as you mentioned, is almost as unrealistic and stupid as Jack's resistance to the idea that the Island is truly, uniquely special.  And it's not just Jack: People see the Island sink into the water, they see the smoke monster, they see polar bears, they shoot polar bears, they see dead people, they hear whispers, they see the future, they see people getting killed by the smoke monster, and they're just like ""Oh, I'm f**kin' dehydrated!"" and they return to their camp where they can disregard the Island once again. The lack of interest in the Island was simply the most annoying thing I had to deal with during the first 2-3 seasons.  It gets even more annoying as the Island's mysteries intensify while the more knowledgeable characters' willingness to explain any given mystery remains still. Sometimes character A completely ignores the question of character B and when you find out that A had the capacity to answer B's question in the given situation, it just feels like you can see the writers stretch the show like pizza dough, or even curly hair. This was most likely due to their unwillingness to ""explore"" the Island which I already complained about.   Tl;dr: It took the writers 4 seasons to figure out what was going on, which translated into a good 6 seasons for the viewers, which was just unpleasant. Characters got more interesting as the writers' interest in characters declined, the show should've been more about the island in my opinion.  Nevertheless, ""it was a great show""."

He's fantastic in them both. But one performance that is underrated is his in Capote. Bennett Miller, the director, is very known for bringing extraordinary performances in his drama films. Something we've seen with this film, Moneyball and Foxcatcher. There aren't many scenes of Pellegrino, who plays a convicted murderer, but even though his performance is short, it's still very good. Also a great movie to watch to see some of the best of Phillip Seymour-Hoffman (a performance he won the Best Actor award for).  Jeremy Davies - Saving Private Ryan is a good example, and his best, but the extreme length of being skinny in Rescue Dawn is impressive. And he's also good in Dogville too.

And the way Jack wakes up is a reference to the same way he woke up in the pilot. And in ""316"" The Island selected certain characters to be beamed down to the island in 1977, while the rest of the plane just carried on and landed on the island in the present. I interpret that as a way of saying that the same thing happened with Jack in the pilot and it placed him there for the importance of that location. (After all, Jack is the one who takes over after Jacob and turns the Light back on, just around the corner at the bamboo forest he woke up in in the first episode)."

After they leave the Island on the chopper, Hurley asks Jack for confirmation that they're just going to drop people off, then go back for Claire, and Jack agrees in a confident way.  (It's neither of their faults that the Island disappears.)  Season Four is where I think Jack and Hugo's friendship really plays an important role in the story.  Hugo apologizes to Jack for splitting up at the fuselage wreckage.  He delivers a critically important series of messages to Jack when he's at his worst in the mental hospital.  These are just a few of the many examples.  It's no wonder Jack says, ""It has to be you"" to Hurley."

Struggling to build shelter, how light a fire, struggles of living castaway style on an island. The show is so much deeper than that I had to convince them without spoiling anything. I brought up the whole man of science vs man of faith aspect of the show. Seeing how my parents are somewhat religious, they bit on that. After four or five episodes they were so hooked. My mom would call me after certain episodes to talk about it. Sometimes crying. I remember after they finish the last episode my dad called me when he was in a state of somewhat shock and a little depressed, I could hear my mom just bawling her head off in the background sort of laughing how sad she was at the same time. We still talk about the show a lot.  Like I said, when the show first came out I assumed it would just be some people struggling to live cast away style. My friend would keep telling me to watch it and I never really cared until he told me about the hatch. He just explained there is this mysterious hatch in the ground in there trying to figure out how to open it. That was so intriguing to me, that's why I started to watch the show. So I think just telling people how great a show is sometimes not enough. You need to find something that will peak their interest specifically. There are a lots of things in lost that people can latch onto. I don't think it would be hard to find something to get them to be into the show."

lost,39fb2i,JRSly,5,Thu Jun 11 09:54:27 2015 UTC,"I'll take a stab at some of it...   Yes. It was an intentionally vague presentation, but in some form of understanding the Island was there to keep ""something bad"" at bay. Probably not intended to be anything specific as we are familiar with..a literal Christian hell or Set from Egyptian mythology...but just an open ""badness"" that works well enough for storytelling. I'm not sure I understand the second part of this one though, what exactly is devaluing everything in your mind? It was both. My conjecture would be that it started genuinely as a game between demi-gods and after several hundred years of just playing the game, Jacob turned his focus also towards finding a successor. Either because he was worried he would lose and be killed sooner than later or simply boredom from being the Protector for a couple thousand years. But, again my interpretation, I'd say it was ostensibly a game to the Man in Black until only fairly recently in their lifetimes, to when he might've clued into Jacob's true intentions and been more proactive in eliminating potential threats or being more heavy handed in manipulating groups. With pregnancy a major issue, the long-term viability of the Others was a big concern. How else to keep the group alive if they can't ""breed: it from within? And taking possible members very early on would be the best way to go, to start brainwashing or indoctrinating as soon as possible before things got messy and violent to where it would be very challenging as they would be trusted even less. I think this is largely an account of grand ""fate"". And not one entity's intended plan. Rather than saying cancer doesn't exist, I think it's more accurate that the Island can heal. The Island can heal miraculously, maybe even just by default, and punish severely at it's whim. Ben was punished because he'd not...""pleased"" the Island in his place of authority and he deserved to be dethroned. Richard told Locke that he'd become too focused on the pregnancy issues and had forgotten ""they have a greater purpose"". Ben wasn't a Protector, but Richard and Ben and the Others were an ""extension"" of Jacob's role and Ben had become too modern and cozy and too sidetracked on his own agendas and not concerned with the greater goal that the Island serves. And I mentioned ""fate"" because, my understanding is this judgment came down from the Island. Jacob was very hands off at this late point in his tenure, mostly focused on finding a successor. And the Man in Black had never been shown to have powers of this sort. So it was just that LOST coincidence/fate that the Island tried to eliminate Ben at the same time that Jacob independently had brought a new group of Candidates to the Island, and one happened to be a spinal surgeon.  The blast door map is kind of a funny thing. In the end, I don't think it's something to be too concerned with sorting out. At it's introduction, it was a crazy-cool intriguing element to fill us with awe and questions. And later we learn it was made by Randzinsky, who at the point of creating it had gone a wee bit insane. So he and it are unreliable narrators. We know for a fact that he was very knowledgeable in Dharma's goings on from the beginning and shouldn't need a map and knows the virus thing is hooey. So was it born from insanity? Or him forming his own agenda? Seeing some purpose in perpetuating the virus myth and keeping his partners in check for some reason? It's hard to say how much of it, if in fact any, should be confidently embraced as canon and how much are just the ramblings of a mad man. It's great for the writers as they could appear to have dumped a lot of juicy, exciting info on us, but then they injected it with as much doubt and misinformation as they potentially needed...and later on anything that didn't vibe with the map wouldn't necessarily have to be retconned or explained...it was just crazy ol' Randzinsky. At introduction...like the map..it was a crazy-cool thing to get forums and water coolers all a twitter the next day. Eventually at some point, Damon and Carlton said it was Dharma honoring the Egyptian pioneers on the Island.  Like RegularGuy said, Locke was stuck after Jacob was killed and until then could do everything as before as far as morphing and impersonating other people. It was just in his best interest at this point to present himself fully as Locke for the most part, rather than manipulating through fear or wonder by appearing as the dead.  I really don't remember...so I think it could probably be seen as just Jacob being Jacob. Something intriguing and mysterious early on, before we saw Jacob and his brother as boys and recognized who the apparition was."
lost,39fb2i,RegularGuy815,2,Thu Jun 11 13:31:54 2015 UTC,"Wow, thanks. I think these are all very reasonable answers on the most part, and like my suspicious some things simply are just the way they are. Just some elaboration on two of the questions now.   Jacob also told Richard that the island was Hell. Explicitly, this was mid-to late game for the show, it was building all the supernatural elements of the island and the abilities Jacob possessed as protector and the horrors committed by the Smoke Monster. There was more context in terms of judgment, repent, corruption etc. But really late game they had the Church scene, allocating most of those concepts of the afterlife to the flash-sideways. That's what I mean by devalued. The Man in Black was no longer some kind of true evil, Him and Jacob were BOTH protectors just like Jack and Hurley became Smoke Monster / Protector, respectively. And while we never saw Jack go Smokey during his short time as protector on screen (and Hurley) we never got to see the same level of omnipresence Jacob seemed to have (you know being invisible too). Jack said he didn't feel any different, in some regards he was still just a regular guy - besides being immortal Jacob was just a guy too, it was his foster mother that made him special. So Jacob and future protectors lost some of the spiritual values of being a legitimate deity. Although their fate as protectors of the island remain sacred.  Pregnancy was an issue. That's why they brought Julia. But they don't need natural island born babies to live long-term. They can leave the island whenever they want (well really just Ben and Richard) so they could recruit form the mainland, they obviously don't have a problem with ""outsiders"" being welcomed to their fold from the mainland because if they truely were stealing oceanic survivors to convert them - they are no different than your traditional ""mainland outsider"" Ben just didn't have to pay for the fuel to drive a boat to and back. I would need some actual evidence their rather than just speculation. Otherwise It's ben thinking on a whim when he sees the plane crash ""People! We need people. Quick, run to their crash-site, make lists, kidnap them instead of approaching them out of convenience."""

But the manifestation of Alex under the temple where Ben faced judgement from the smoke monster was also the Man in Black's doing. Therefore he took Alex's form, she died on the island, in the Dharma camp. Also the original Man in Black and Jack died in the heart of island and then took their own bodies which were spat out on that log. The final scene of Jack running through the reeds I believe happened much later, Hurley and Jack replaced Jacob and MiB respectively. Which Walt would later follow."

They can be different than what's possible in real life, but if a mechanic is set up and then broken or if a new mechanic arises from nothing to only be used once it's viewed as not being as expertly crafted (exceptions not included).   It's always possible that you don't have to explain all the mechanics, but a show like lost the scrutiny is high, and so far has held it's own to any rational scrutiny to anyone of these ""mysterious questions"".  Some answers are still just because of magic. And that's the end of it. And the reality is that the MiB and Jacob probably had other abilities that didn't show up at all, but that means they also aren't relevant. This one did. A vast majority of everything that happens in the show is backed by other experiences.  Which my example at the end of my last comment that someone else brought up earlier shows the validity behind why or how come he can do this. And is a much better answer than ""Maybe because he can do whatever he want"". And that will always be true.  I really see nonsensical questions as follow: If you're standing at the very center of the North Pole, what direction is North?

I think the way it ended was great, but since the waiting room was the afterlife, everything that happened on the island was real in the most literal sense, the smoke monster, immortal deities, fast healing, which I felt made those supernatural elements more devalued because it stripped them off any additional contexts.   I'm not really sure what you're asking here. I guess you're assuming that just because something bad is locked away, it must be hell? The show doesn't really imply the existence or a hell. Or a heaven for that matter. Just the existence of some unspecified type of afterlife. Also not sure why the island being real devalues it. Most people who wrongly interpreted the show as the island not being real were mad because they thought that devalued it.   Didn't Jacob admit that over the years he brought people to the island as a sort of game to prove to the Man in Black the people can live without being corrupted? Because later is appears to be explicit that the reason was he feared he would die and would have to groom his successor, or doom the world or alternatively bring someone new to the island to prevent the Man in Black from leaving? i.e. kill him.)   He did both.   Why did the others take so many people early on. I know why they might have been interested in Walt, and anyone who was pregnant on the island but what about everyone else. It was a list from Jacob until we figured out that Ben told Ethan and the other guy himself. Was it just them being ""hostile"" to scare them and keep them under control on their island?   If they can't have children, how else do you keep a society going in the real long term?   So cancer doesn't exist on the island, like a lot of other illnesses an the fact that people heal quickly. I thought it was a very important moment when Jack said to Ben he must have done something terrible to get cancer, and Ben said, then there must be a similar reason to why the sky dropped a spinal surgeon on my doorstep. So Ben must of fell out of grace with either Jacob or the island itself somehow, which at the time might have also included displeasing the smoke monster. What did he do?   I wouldn't say ""cancer doesn't exist on the island"", merely ""the island can heal people"". The whys are meant to be up to interpretation via the whole science vs faith debate. Some characters have attributed it to the island healing people it finds worthy (ex: Locke, Rose), and withholding it from those working against it (ex: Ben, Jack). We also get interpretations from people like in Rose's flashback about how different areas of the world are attuned to different energy, and some will just work for some people and not others. You don't really have to ask what specific thing Ben did wrong. He's a pretty horrible person, it's not exactly like he's ever done only one thing wrong.    If they were the only people why fake a shutdown and work in secret?   The original creator of the map was Radzinsky, we meet him in season 5 in the past. He obviously knew everything that was going on. So if he wanted to work on a map in secret, he could only do it when almost all the power was off during those shutdowns, and he had to make it in invisible ink so the cameras wouldn't pick it up when they were back on. And this method of doing it just got passed down.   According to the diagram, its contributors knew A LOT about the island and are also incredibly intuitive about the question of what the heart of the island is. via the large question mark in the center and other content. It's obviously a giant mechanic for the writers to create mystery, which I'm honestly fine with, but damn is that a stretch.   I don't think the question mark was meant to be the heart. It was meant to be the Pearl station, which was the station monitoring the swan. The heart of the island wasn't at the center of the island.   Why where there Egyptian characters after the countdown in the hatch? So they might be translated as death but why would the Dharma initiate even use that language?   It's basically a easter egg be the designer of the Swan. Not unlike a programmer adding a piece of code to something they made that is never really meant to run as like a personal signature. Radzinsky built the swan, and he knew a lot of the history of the island, and basically did it as a reference to the previous inhabitants of the island.   really remember the Man in Black posing as Locke saying that his body grab was permanent, but it didn't matter because he hasn't been human for a long time anyways. So could he just swap bodies on a whim or did he accrue another power of apparitions used no where else in the show to convince Ben?   He could switch bodies around until Jacob died. Also it was Ilanna that told us this, not MIB, for what its worth. This is how MIB also shows up as Christian Shepard during the same time to guide Sun and Lapidus.   Was there any reason to why kid-Jacob was appearing to Hurly, Sayed, MiB and not seen by Richard? Or was that Jacob just being Jacob?   Hurly, Sayed (also Sawyer) are Candidates. And the MIB is the MIB. Richard was none of these things."

The show through explaining elements throughout the final season made the island more ""real"" and gave the flash-sideways the explicit afterlife. And it's that trade-off that I really mean.  EDIT: And you are also adding that Radzinsky because of the exploration found the Pearl and knew there were cameras and therefore worked in secret? Because the Pearl is also one of the few stations that aren't on the map I believe. My real question was why the hell did he go to such measures.  EDIT 2: I missed this:   I don't think the question mark was meant to be the heart. It was meant to be the Pearl station, which was the station monitoring the swan. The heart of the island wasn't at the center of the island.   Well not necessarily THE heart but the lifeblood, the energy of the island, it's all over in pockets, and it is CENTRAL to the islands existence. The map is hardly indicative of any kind scale or distance. If you mean the ""?"" was the literal center geographically it would also mean that the shape of the island was a hexagon and all the stations were in an array around the pearl. I think the center is the energy something every station has a role in monitoring."

After five years, I decided it was time. Watching while knowing the full story helped make it ""about the people"" this time. I wasn't expecting things to be answered, and the ending was far more satisfying this time around.   I'm happy I can now say I ""understand"" the writers intent, and am no longer angry at the show ending the way it did. Though, I still want answers to things left unsaid."
lost,39emav,Yrrebbor,5,Thu Jun 18 05:14:57 2015 UTC,"Ending was amazing, everything that mattered was explored, Flash Sideways was definitely not nonsense.   Do you have lingering ""unanswered"" questions about things that we might be able to answer?"
lost,39emav,Shutupredneckman2,4,Thu Jun 11 16:34:45 2015 UTC,"The problem with the final season is not that questions were unanswered. Rather, smart questions were answered with stupid questions and the season was fraught with poor storytelling. Here are some examples of the former issue.  What is Jacob’s job? To protect the magical light cave. How did MIB become the smoke monster? He fell into the magical light cave. What is the smoke monster? Someone who falls into the magical light cave. How is Jacob immortal? He drank the magical juice. Where did the donkey wheel come from? MIB decided that installing a large wheel near the magical light cave would allow him to leave the island, based on ancient Roman understanding of science.  The answers to these questions were so poor that they would have been better left unanswered. Compare these to other questions that Lost answered rather beautifully in earlier seasons. What is the DHARMA Initiative? Who are the Others? What is the deal with Desmond?  And here are some examples of poor storytelling.  The Temple subplot could have been cut out of the season entirely and story-wise the plot would have been the same. We were introduced to new characters that had almost no meaningful impact on the story this late in the game. This includes the minor arc of Sayid being resurrected. Many characters feel like their arcs have been fulfilled and they are just “sticking around” for season 6, most notably Sawyer. Other stories were butchered, like Claire’s. If Lost truly is “primarily about the characters,” then why were so few Losties (arguably only Jack and Hurley) integral to the plot of the final season, and why did it focus so much on Jacob and MIB on-island?"
lost,39emav,mconlin7,2,Tue Jun 16 15:01:16 2015 UTC,"I just don't really know what a smart answer would be to ""Where did the smoke monster come from?"", then. There's just not going to be any science to explain that, so by definition the answer will be supernatural.   I don't think the Temple could be written out because they had referenced the Temple starting in S3, and visited there to heal Ben in S5. We knew it existed and that a bunch of Others were there, so I think it would have been difficult not to include it. I'd definitely agree that S6 is weaker in terms of storytelling (I'm actually grateful for the Temple keeping people more or less in one place or on little missions, since the 2nd half of the season is seriously just the characters playing Red Rover running back and forth, getting captured by various people, etc.)  I can understand the argument that Sawyer's arc was closed, but I don't think that's true, and I think he actually got some of his best development in S6. Up to that point, Sawyer's story was ruffian conman Sawyer turned respected leader Lafleur. He matured, found love, gained respect as the head of security for Dharma, was learning to be the person he needed to be so that he could eventually return to the US and be a father to Clementine the way his father wasn't. But Sawyer's leadership as Lafleur never hit snags until the Oceanic 6 screwed things up, he never had to make tough decisions like Jack did in his leadership. So when Jack gets Juliet killed, Sawyer's angry and wants to kill him. It's this whole story of collateral, and sort of a recycling of Sawyer's original flashback wherein he drops a con because he sees a kid and realizes he's going to destroy a family the way Cooper destroyed his. During S6, he doubts/hates Jack for his decision, but then in the Sub, Sawyer makes a hard leadership decision of his own, and it gets Sun, Jin and Sayid killed. At that point he's able to come to terms with Jack, and with Juliet's death, and become a more multi-faceted person who understands that decisions made with the best intentions can have awful collateral."
lost,39emav,Shutupredneckman2,2,Tue Jun 16 15:17:55 2015 UTC,"I agree with some of your points. You've convinced me that Sawyer really did have some more development in S6. And they did have to have a physical temple.   But the writers didn't have to dwell on it for as long as they did, given how boring and largely irrelevant it was to the overall ebb and flow of the story. For example, they could have combined the lighthouse, temple, and cave into one place and been done with it all in the first episode or 2. To illustrate my problem with the Temple and other S6 locations, compare how you felt when watching these episodes to how you felt when you first saw the inside of the hatch in the S2 premiere, or the DHARMA Barracks in the S3 premiere. They either needed to make the temple more interesting and important, or relegate it to an episode or two.   Regarding the Jacob/MIB plot, as I said I think some questions should have been left unanswered instead of the poor resolutions they were given. Lost took bizarre plot elements that seemed irreconcilable and explained them exceptionally: the others, DHARMA, the button, Desmond, and even in S6 with Richard Alpert and the Black Rock.   I feel that the writers made two finales: ""Across the Sea"" for those who cared more about the mysteries, and the finale for those who cared more about the characters. And ""Across the Sea"" really just sucked, for the reasons I already stated.  I feel that they DID have enough time in S6 to wrap up all of these questions AND have a character-focused finale. They just needed to spend less time introducing new places (Temple, Lighthouse, Cave), people (Dogen, Lennon, expanding Ilana), and concepts (MIB as Flocke, etc). Because regardless of what people on this subreddit say, a lot of it seemed rushed and didn't really fit based on simple screenwriting logic."
lost,39emav,mconlin7,1 point,Wed Jun 17 04:35:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah I can't really disagree. They took way too long at the temple, and a lot of the revelations in S6 felt cheap and unfulfilling, though I think that's more because we built up so many possibilities or expected an answer that couldn't exist.   I'm kinda split on Across the Sea. It definitely could have been a lot better, and really that story needed more than one episode to make us care much about the characters involved as humans.   I do think the season simultaneously feels rushed, yet like the characters are running back and forth to kill time. But I also think all of the characters got to where they needed to be narratively."
lost,39emav,Shutupredneckman2,-4,Wed Jun 17 05:44:20 2015 UTC,"The reason why I did not like the final two seasons was it was not a falling action after a climax. They full on came to a sudden stop. The entire last season, other than the Jacob/MiB episode felt like it was wandering in the desert. It was not leading to the end. It did not answer lots of questions. Here are some from my notes.  Why does throwing the MiB into the heart of the island turn him into smokey? The monster can't pass over ash. Why? Where is christian's body if the man is black took his form? Why can Jacob leave but his brother can't? Whats with child Jacob running around? How did Jacob get his army? How did he choose them? Why is is cold in the cave with the wheel? When Alex is killed Ben says they ""changed the rules""? What is he talking about? Eko was killed by the smoke monster for what reason? Why was Libby in the mental hospital with Hurley? Why was she down under? Why does the island heal people selectively? Why can't women give birth on the island? Where did that huge pallet of food come from? Who was shooting at sawyer and Juliet when they were time traveling on the boat? So Ben steals Rousseau's child and then she catches him in a net 16 years later and she can't remember who he is? Why? Why were there Egyptian writing when the numbers counted down in the hatch? Desmond is impervious to electromagnetism, why exactly? How did Naomi get a photo of Penny and Desmond? Charlie dies so Claire and Aaron can leave in a helicopter. But that never happens. Why? What exactly did Charlie's death do? How did the journal of the first mate of the Black Rock get off the Island? It was being sold at an auction many years later.    I know thats a lot of questions but you asked."
lost,39emav,Shutupredneckman2,9,Thu Jun 11 18:15:04 2015 UTC,"A lot of those aren't really questions, though. They're just like ""Where does the Force come from?"", or ""Why are hobbits short?"", or ""Why does getting bit by a radioactive spider give one superpowers?"". They're givens of the universe.   Entering the heart gives one a punishment worse than death because the Heart needs to be kept safe from people who would use it incorrectly. By trying to take more of the energy than exists in each person, one dooms themselves to an eternity of protecting it.  Christian's body was likely tossed into the ocean, or eaten by boars or something.  Jacob can leave because he didn't touch the Source, and because Protector powers involve being able to appear wherever one wants. MIB's tied to the island as punishment.  Child Jacob was Jacob taunting MIB. Not sure why he chose to appear in his younger form, or why Walt appears in his older taller form when Locke's in the mass grave. Character choice.  Jacob chose his army with the lighthouse. He found a bunch of useful looking people and went to touch them, either to make them Candidates or Others. Ilana for example was paralyzed in a hospital when Jacob came and cured her; Dogen's son was dying from a car accident, etc. He looked for people who needed him.  I'm not a scientist so I can't really speak to the cold wheel aside from ""because it's cold in that room"". Probably something with time/space and the speed of molecules in the air.   Ben and Widmore at some point agreed that during their feud, they wouldn't kill the other one's innocent family members. Widmore hired mercenaries who did exactly that, and thus broke the gentlemens agreement.  MIB was planning to appear as Yemi a bunch and manipulate Eko's guilt for his own designs, like he did with Ben and Alex in S5. In Eko's death ep, he comes to terms with his guilt and accepts that despite the bad things he's done, he's ultimately a good man, since it all came from a sacrifice he made so that Yemi wouldn't have to live that life. With that, he dropped his baggage and stopped being a Candidate, so MIB killed him since he had no use for Eko whatsoever and was suddenly allowed to.  Libby had a mental breakdown over her husband's death (the one who left her the boat). Not sure why she was in Australia.   The Island has a will of its own. I don't know that it necessarily heals selectively so much as it heals most everyone but withheld help from Ben because he's a little shit.   The Incident stops women from giving birth, the electromagnetism. Ethan's born on the island right before the Incident, and then no one can have babies after that.  Pallet of food came from a warehouse run by Dharma. Eloise kept the 2 worker dudes thinking DI still existed so that she could get food to Kelvin/Desmond regularly.  Outrigger Chase is a legit mystery, no denying that. They had a plan for it but didn't end up shooting the scene.  Rousseau's literally a crazy person and I'm sure faces and memories start to blend. It was also really dark when Ben took Alex, and he's aged in 16 years, and Rousseau is also crazy.  There was some history of Egyptians on the island/Whoever designed the countdown clock thought it looked cool.  Desmond's special because he is a living Failsafe Key for the Island/Jacob to always be able to keep MIB from escaping.   Widmore gave Naomi the photo when he hired her to go find the Island and Desmond.  The Island pretty much makes people see whatever it wants. It needed Charlie to do what he did and gave Des the appropriate visions. / Des and Charlie inadvertently changed the circumstances of Charlie drowning with the Not Penny's Boat, and it not being flooded and so on, and changed the outcome as a result.    How did the journal of the first mate of the Black Rock get off the Island? It was being sold at an auction many years later.   Probably someone found it on the island, then left the island with it."

lost,39amjf,JRSly,3,Wed Jun 10 13:24:54 2015 UTC,"I didn't mind the flash sideways as a concept, I think the idea works well enough with the general philosophy of the show. But I agree it took up way too much time, because they felt so chained to their ""flash-something"" format. I get it, it makes sense to keep that consistency and be able to further twist the concept of flashbacks and have a thread of mystery on what exactly they were. But they don't hold up significantly in retrospect and so Damon and Carlton maybe should've reconsidered adhering so strongly to their format. Worse of all for me was the phony baloney sense of urgency in the flash-sideways story where they tried to make it run parallel to the island story and present it as if they didn't all meet up at the perfect time their ""moving on"" might be in jeopardy..which of course wasn't the case in the slightest.   It's kinda like with the Jin flashback/Sun flashforward episode where the audience is flat out tricked...they acknowledged that they could really only pull that once and not have the audience be untrusting and not as invested in the narrative. But it was just one episode, and the flash-sideways kinda end up feeling like a season-long trick"

Remember how she took Desmond to the park and vaguely predicted the death of the man with the red shoes?  Whidmore never demonstrated this type of knowledge. He only seemed to have knowledge of general events. I actually think that after she killed Faraday she was obsessed with changing the future/past err whatever... I think she took advantage of some of the DI facilities and conducted some of her own experiments which had some adverse side effects on her own conscienceless. Her getting involved in the DI would also explain how she knew about the DI station in LA where they found the island in the first place.

She pushed Faraday into science and kept him from forming any real emotional bonds with others, knowing he was basically going to end up as a human sacrifice to the timeline.  This also explains why she was so desperate to continue to spend time with Faraday in the flash-sideways.

lost,392mwe,footwith4toes,16,Mon Jun 8 20:26:17 2015 UTC,"Heres the article about Lost if you don't want to go to Buzzfeed;   SPOILER ALERT FOR AN EPISODE THAT HAS EXISTED FOR EIGHT YEARS!!!  One of the most agonizing questions writers get asked is “Where do you get your ideas from?” It’s frustrating because most of the time we don’t know… or we probably stole it from somewhere and we don’t want to be identified as plagiarist hacks. But I know exactly where this idea came from…  The final scene of “Through the Looking Glass” — the third season finale of Lost — was stolen from the movie Saw 2.  If you have not seen Saw 2, all you need to know is that Donnie Wahlberg is in it and that the twist at the end involves tricking the audience into thinking they’re watching something unfold in present time, when in fact, it is unfolding in the PAST. Also, Donnie Wahlberg is in it. Did I say that already?  ANYWAY.  Carlton (my co-writer) and I had just finally won the battle to have ABC announce an end date to the show (albeit three years out), which finally allowed us to break from the monotony of character flashbacks (we had one that explained where Sayid had his hair styled all lined up) and launch into flash-FORWARDS. But the divine inspiration of Saw 2 led us to the inevitable conclusion that the best way to do this would be to make our first flash-forward LOOK like yet another flashback. And then, in the final scene, we drop the hammer. Boom. You’re in the FUTURE, BITCHES!!! TAKE THAT, DONNIE WAHLBERG!  Writing that scene — the one where Jack waits on the outskirts of LAX as a car pulls up… the door opens… and out steps KATE — was awesome. My process is riddled with doubt and self-loathing, but this was one of the rare instances where I felt like I was doing something undeniably great. I felt like I had been crouched down in the darkness of someone’s apartment with all my best friends (the writers) waiting to shout out SURPRISE to our unexpected birthday boy/girl (the audience) — and I KNEW they’d be thrilled when we did.  And by time Jack was shouting, “WE HAVE TO GO BAAAAAAAACK!” (yes, I added all those extra A’s in the script) and I typed SMASH TO BLACK, my eyes were wet. I was inside the thing… feeling what these characters were feeling… knowing we were, at long last, working toward an actual ENDING now. And finally…for one fleeting moment…  I felt peace."
lost,392mwe,skinkbaa,10,Mon Jun 8 21:23:30 2015 UTC,"And further down in the article (numbers 31 and 32) is something from Kitsis and Horowitz about a Once Upon A Time moment that came from an episode of Lost:   At the very end of the pilot episode of Once Upon a Time, there is a moment when our 10-year-old protagonist, Henry, stares out the window of his bedroom at the Storybrooke town clock tower. It's been frozen since the cursed town came into existence years earlier. As he stares at it in the wake of the arrival of his mother, Emma, the clock finally comes alive and ticks. Henry smiles. That small moment encapsulated everything the show was about and still is to this day: hope.  We consciously decided that we didn't want to end the pilot on a traditional ""cliffhanger"" or ""twist"" — we hoped there were enough turns in the story to have engaged the audience already. Instead we really wanted to focus on the ""feeling"" we hoped to leave with our viewers. In many ways it was a direct descendant of a moment we wrote years earlier on Lost, in an episode where Hurley found an old VW Bus on the island. The story simply became about starting the van — but it was really about hope. The catharsis Hurley felt, and by extension the audience felt, when the impossible happened and the ancient van revved to life was an important epiphany for us as writers. Since then we've always strived to find a well of emotion in the simplest of moments. For Once Upon a Time, it has now become our ongoing mantra to keep the show unabashedly hopeful and uncyncial. To always search in every episode for what we call our ""clock tick"" moment."
lost,392mwe,terdsie,7,Mon Jun 8 21:40:38 2015 UTC,And it was spoiled by me. It was the first show I ever really watched and I found spoilers for the finale and read them all for some reason. Every word I read I hated myself a little more and then I arrived at the end. The crazy thing is I don't even remember what I felt about it because I also read another thing from the LOST execs saying that they knew some spoilers got out HOWEVER we hadn't seen anything yet. We had NO IDEA what the finale was going to show so I took that as there was an EVEN GREATER twist AFTER the flash forward scene so I can't recall how I felt about it but I do know how I felt when I watched the show on TV. That scene came and went and as I sat there waiting for something even bigger than that it went to black. I was confused and honestly severely hurt. That was the day I decided to never read spoilers OR watch previews ever again.

And another clue that time has no meaning in the flash sideways is when Locke is run over by Desmond and rushed to hospital Sun sees him being stretchered in as she herself is being admitted to the hospital yet technically the 2 events that brought them to the hospital didn't coincide with one another time wise. IMO while watching the show when that aired was one of the firmer clues that something seemed off in this ""parallel universe""."

It's not like she was leading anyone along, sleeping with both, etc.   Well she did break Jack's heart by sleeping with Sawyer in the cage. They had kissed by then, and he was really into her.

The more sex scenes a show has, the worse the show is, in my opinion. It's like they are trying to lure people into watching it because it might be a bit risque (or whatever).

How did it go from being a blueprint in Horace's pocket to an old rickety thing that looks like it's from the 1800's? I think it was confirmed that it's the man in black who is in the cabin, but does Ben know it's the MIB when he claims it's jacob? Why does he appear all freaky and poltergeisty to Locke and Ben, instead of as Christian? I get that the ash surrounding it was supposed to ""trap"" the MIB/smoke monster, but how did they get him IN there to trap him? First of all, he seems too smart for that, second the cabin doesn't stay in one place. I don't have any theories, unfortunately, but would love to hear some others' (no pun intended)."
lost,38val2,eichonezeeone,4,Sun Jun 7 08:16:22 2015 UTC,"I agree that the cabin is quite fascinating. Wish we'd seen more of it.  The Island seems to have a way of cloaking/hiding. It can even hide itself from the world and it seems to do the same thing with other stuff. Jack commented on how they've never encountered the lighthouse. Or The Man in Black   ""I've spent 30 years searching for that place you brought me as a child--that...waterfall with that beautiful light. I've walked this island from end to end, not once coming close to finding it"", but he knows where it is, like he says in The End with ""we're here"".   I guess The Island plays tricks this way, because people aren't ""ready"" or have to ""talk to The Island"" first, which is why the cabin ""presents itself"" at certain times for certain special people when they are ready.  I don't think Ben knew it was MIB there. I think he genuinely thought  he would encounter Jacob there and just played a trick on Locke, like he said in ""The Incident"". He knew Richard was given these lists from Jacob, and probably stood a good distance from the cabin, while Richard was in there himself, telling Ben he had to be patient before seeing him. I also thought he appeared freaky, because both Ben and Locke would be ideal people for his ultimate plan to kill Jacob. Scaring them both could give him an advantage, which it did. When Locke sees him later, when he encounters Christian who says he'll speak on his behalf, John probably thought he got special treatment. That he finally saw something there, someone that gave him a mission delegated to him, which made Locke think more highly of himself. You hear it when John makes that comment in the finale right after Cabin Fever. ""Jacob told me what we had to do. You don't get to make all the decisions"".   The fact that he said Jacob and not Christian, and the way he says it. MIB had won him on his side, and that goes all the way from the spooky cabin event."

lost,38val2,l0stinthought,1 point,Mon Jun 8 00:06:01 2015 UTC,"The ash circles are generally used to keep the MIB out, and since the monster was already out and about on the island while the invisible person was in the cabin, that seems to suggest that it wasn't part of the MIB that was trapped in the cabin while another part of himself was allowed to roam free.  But the more compelling argument, IMO, is that when Hurley stumbles across the cabin, we see Christian in the cabin having a meeting with the invisible guy (we saw the invisible guy's eye when Locke and Ben were in the cabin, and then we saw his eye again when Hurley was in the cabin). So why would the MIB move the cabin in order to talk to himself? It seems more likely that Jacob would have moved the cabin out of the ash ring in order to have a talk with the MIB (Christian), agreeing to give MIB the cabin in exchange for something (perhaps a temporary truce/some sort of, ""If you'll help the people on the island fend off the incoming freighter people, you can have the cabin"" deal). At which point Jacob went back to living in the foot statue. (Plus Jacob is the one who frowns on the use of technology, not the MIB, which explains why the poltergeisty activity began when Locke turned on his flashlight.)  The cabin does seem to stay in one place unless its occupant decides to move it. Jacob and the MIB both should theoretically be able to manipulate the island's exotic matter which allows for teleportation, so either of them could have moved the cabin whenever they wanted."

But Libby... man, that's harsh.  Libby didn't do anything to deserve what happened.  That said: I did a rewatch of Season 1, and I like Michael in that season.  He's warm, concerned, wants to help the group (like sketching out the aqueduct design, which he probably would have built had he not gotten sidetracked by the raft project.)  He is overbearing and controlling with Walt, which is understandable seeing as 1) he barely knows him, and 2) he took him out of Australia under dubious circumstances.  Much of Michael's anxiety about losing Walt probably comes from how insecure his position is (Walt has a legal father; Michael has no legal claim to Walt whatever.)  But as I see it, what really unhinges Michael is when Walt develops a close friendship, even a fascination for Locke: especially the bad-ass things he sees Locke doing (hunting, knife-throwing, being a general jungle tough guy.)  Walt compares Michael to Locke and finds Michael wanting.    Finally, Michael just snaps.  In my view, he becomes motivated to build the raft not so much to ""get off the Island"" as to ""get Walt away from Locke,"" and away from what he sees as Locke's bad influences.  This is where it all falls apart for Michael.  After Walt is kidnapped, Michael will do anything, including kill innocents like Libby, to get Walt back.  Which is kind of ironic, because Michael's overbearing parenting and guilt complex drove him into putting Walt on a raft in the first place.    Walt was perfectly safe on the beach, even if he did play backgammon and throw knives with Locke.  Michael is the one who put Walt into danger, through over-emotionalism."

Ever since Season Three, it's been pretty obvious (from very clear points made in the show as broadcast) what the Island is going to be like after ""The End.""  Personally, I don't think that's at all compatible with the kind of action-adventure story which would make money for the network.  ""Shambhala"" isn't just a cute, hip '70s song used for background music in ""Tricia Tanaka is Dead.""  People don't just wander into Shambhala and mess things up.  Only those ""karmically ready"" can even approach it.  In lore, it's protected by terrifying guardians which make it impossible to reach, except for very few.  After 2000 years, the Island is actually, genuinely going to be protected.  Why undo all that?  I see very little opportunity for the kind of conflict many viewers would like to see, unless you completely undo everything that was built up from Season 3 - 6."

lost,38og2k,Petrichor02,3,Fri Jun 5 17:39:51 2015 UTC,"The Others didn't know about Walt's powers originally. They kidnapped him for the same reason they kidnapped all of the Tail section survivors that they took: Walt was on Jacob's list. This was revealed in one of the 13 Lost: Missing Pieces videos (some more out-of-show scenes, like the epilogue).  The Others didn't want Walt for his powers. And they were surprised to find that Walt had powers. So they started trying to test him, and when that didn't lead to anything, they just tried to get him to stop using his powers. That didn't work either, the Others became scared of Walt, and they pleaded with Ben to get rid of Walt. So Ben came up with the plan to get Michael to make a deal with them to get Walt back.  Walt actually wasn't a candidate since Locke, Jack, Sawyer, Sayid, Hurley, and the unspecified Kwon were the last candidates. Jacob never intended for Walt to replace him. (Whether Walt was a candidate to replace Hurley though is up for debate.)  Walt's purpose in the show was to 1) show that not just Tail section people were on Jcaob's list, and 2) introduce the concept of special people in the show's universe (so that the show could later introduce things like Hurley's ability to talk to ghosts, Locke's healing ability, Miles, Desmond, etc.). Walt fulfilled both of those roles, so he was no longer needed for the plot. And since Walt was getting too tall/old to keep playing a 10 year old, they decided there was no reason to write a brand new plot line for him and bring him back (outside of his guest appearances in Seasons 3, 4, and 5).  As for where his powers come from, we were told that everyone in the Lost universe has some amount of the light inside themselves. All of Walt's abilities (as well as the abilities of all the other special people) are variations of things that the light is able to do/allow others to do. So it seems that the most likely explanation for these powers is that the special people are able to manipulate the light in the world because of the light within themselves. Perhaps they have more light within themselves than non-special people; perhaps they are just more in-tune with it than non-special people, but either way they are able to use that light within themselves to affect the world around them."

I'm glad you enjoyed the ending though, I feel like people who didn't watch the whole series live (I binged the first four seasons and watched the last two live) had more fondness for the ending."
lost,38og2k,stef_bee,2,Fri Jun 5 23:12:54 2015 UTC,"Wow, the JackVLocke fight at the end was anti-climactic   Nothing says good editing like a commercial break mid punch!   WHY IS WALT SO SPECIAL? Clearly he was a candidate like the rest, so why did TheOthers act like he was so different? I chalked his powers up to the Islands Wack-Mojo, but it still doesn't explain why everyone treated him with such distinction only to forget about him until an epilogue.    Well, that's the thing. Think about all the events again. What actually says Walt is some really important character? When do the Others actually treat him differently, outside of noting he has powers.  They kidnap him, but really that's just what they do to kids. Walt is not special in that regard. When people arrive on the island, The Others take the 'good' people to integrate them into their society, and children pretty much always fit that qualification. They didn't even know about his powers.   So then they have him, he starts exhibiting weird powers, they probably do some kind of testing during this time, eventually decide he is too much trouble to be worth the effort, and jump at the chance to basically trade him for Ben just so they can get rid of him.  Even him having powers doesn't make him uniquely special. That's just a thing that exists in this universe, if certainly rarely. Look at Hurley and Miles. It's just things they're born with as far as we know.  I admit it's not really a satisfying character arc, but I feel there's a lot less mystery there than people believe. Honestly I don't know why they didn't take advantage of the time skip and Locke meeting Walt off island as a way to bring him back to the show and develop the character more. Would certainly have been more satisfying."

(Desmond is pretty special, too, in being unstuck in time and being able to withstand huge amounts of electromagnetic force.)  This is just part of the ""rules of the universe"" in which LOST occurs.  My view on why the Others captured Walt in the first place was simple: the Others steal children (just as they took Zach and Emma.) They can't have children of their own, yet need replacements.  Until November 1, 2004 (Aaron's birthday), Walt was the only child among the mid-section survivors.  Ethan did try to steal Aaron by kidnapping Claire, but got foiled.  Walt does seem to promote a fair amount of head-canon.  My interpretation of TNMIC is that Walt assisted Hurley at freeing the Island of all those ghosts; not that Walt ever replaced Hurley."

Jack gets to become a good father, something that he wished he had.   Kate gets to save Claire and Aaron, something that she tried to do on the Island.   Blah blah blah the other characters get similar closure. It's not relevant to the island or the future of the Island, but it is incredibly relevant to the characters, which is undoubtedly the 'main story'. I think what's happening here is that you consider the Island's history and lore to be the main aspect of the show, whereas I consider the character dynamic and relationships to be the main aspect. The Island is just a setting in my mind."

The Island is just a setting in my mind.""  No, no. I feel that I have a solid blend of focusing on the characters, while being fascinated by the setting (or 'the mythology'), but the latter does not obscure the former in my mind, at all. I realize now what my issue is, however. When I saw the opening of Season 6, with Jack on the plane just after jughead was made to look like it exploded (it clearly didn't), for me, this was the writers finally giving us something straight: jughead created an alternate reality to avoid a paradox. Suddenly... EVERYTHING made sense--all the Faraday stuff and Desmond stuff, course correction--you could start to see where all of those puzzle pieces made sense in light of seeing the ""alternate"" version of Jack. So for me, the reveal that it was just purgatory, and more about giving the characters a send off and closure--it discards all the things that the writers were alluding to in favor of something else entirely, so it's more of a ""we fooled you"" thing than the actualization of the initial narrative. It's as if the writers were saying: ""Ha, it's NOT an alternate reality, it's Purgatory, and isn't THAT ironic, since y'all were speculating that the island was purgatory during season 1. We've come full circle with the mind fuck!""  To me, that plays interestingly in the moment of delivery, but as far as the overarching legacy of the show and the taste it leaves, it falls short. Maybe it's just me, but I feel like the writers were one inch from the gold of closing one of the most amazing narratives in the history of the medium, and instead of mining that extra bit, they took a shit on the pick-axe. In my opinion, the closure should have come while they were still alive, not in ""purgatory"". Believe me, I desperately want to find a way to appreciate the ending they gave us... maybe I need to 'let go' a bit... =\"
lost,38rc5o,Shutupredneckman2,9,Sat Jun 6 05:28:28 2015 UTC,"Desmond dying and coming back is why the Flash-Sideways is even more important to the overall narrative. Desmond knows that regardless of what happens in this life, they're all gonna move on to another life (, brotha) and be happy. This informs everything he does in the last few episodes and he also spreads this influence to Jack and Sayid to varying degrees.   That's something beautiful about Sayid's decision to not kill Desmond also, that he thought doing so was the only way for him to be with Shannon again, but in reality it probably would have prevented him from seeing her since an act that evil and self-serving would likely make Sayid a Whisper at best and he wouldn't get to move on with the group. And like Desmond said, how would he explain to Shannon what he did?"

The problem is, Desmond is actually consciousness jumping INTO purgatory. Why is that a problem? Because we follow Desmond into that scene change as a linear progression of the MAIN narrative. That is hugely problematic for anyone who doesn't want to watch the purgatory content."
lost,38rc5o,stef_bee,1 point,Sat Jun 6 04:03:50 2015 UTC,"The flash-sideways isn't actually purgatory in LOST. The flash-sideways isn't an afterlife realm. You don't go there after you've died. You go there in your dying moments.  We were already told back in Season 2 when the flash-sideways universe was first introduced that it existed between life and the afterlife (i.e., it is not an afterlife realm itself), and then Season 6 showed us that Jack, Juliet, and Desmond all experienced the flash-sideways universe while they were still alive. All were either brought to near-death situations or were actually in their dying moments when they experienced the flash-sideways.  Juliet was still alive on the island in the premiere, but her consciousness was in the flash-sideways (which is why she asked Sawyer if he'd go to coffee with her, that they could go Dutch, and that ""it worked"", which are all things that flash-sideways Juliet tells Sawyer when he unplugs and replugs the vending machine in the hospital; Juliet was alive on the island, but dying, and as she was dying, her consciousness was experiencing that vending machine scene in the flash-sideways).  Jack sees the church scene in his dying moments. This is why the final scenes of the show flash back and forth between Jack dying and the people in the church; the audience is getting to see what Jack is seeing in his dying moments.  Desmond was blasted with what would have been a lethal level of electromagnetic radiation if not for his electromagnetic resistance. He was brought so close to death that he saw the flash-sideways universe and remembered it when he woke up in the real world again (just like how Charlotte Malkin remembered the flash-sideways world after she spoke to Yemi after ""drowning"" in Season 2). At this point there is no more flashing for Desmond. He doesn't flash between the two at all. He just remembers the flash-sideways universe and doesn't realize that it's not actually an alternate universe, while his future self who has already experienced the flash-sideways and ""woken up"" within it proceeds to gather the survivors together because he finally realizes what the flash-sideways universe actually is."

Are you suggesting that all the content during the season six ""sideways flashes"" took place while the characters lay dying, and not AFTER they died?  ""We were already told back in Season 2 when the flash-sideways universe was first introduced that it existed between life and the afterlife.""   I'm not sure what you're referring to, unless you're referring to Desmond Consciousness-Jumping during season 2? I never thought--not once--that Desmond was interacting with the same realm (or whatever you want to call it) that we see during the six season 'sideways' flashes. Is that what you're suggesting?

Well, the O6 didn't bring everyone back and didn't recreate the events of Flight 815 exactly, so there were side effects (i.e., while everyone on Ajira 316 traveled a short way through time when they approached the island, Jack, Kate, Hurley, and Sayid traveled a long way through time).  2) Jack, Kate, Hurley, and Sayid had always been on the island during 1977, so the universe had to course-correct to make sure they ended up there at the appropriate time to preserve history."

Some might say that his ""when you became a mother"" refers to Aaron, but I'd think with the temporariness of that, that maybe Jacob was talking about Kate and Jack's hook-up the night before Ajira. I definitely think Kate having Jack's kid post-Island is canon, so I would theorize that Kate was still a Candidate when she flashed back to 77, and then in the next day or so she became pregnant and the all-knowing Jacob crossed her off in 2007."

lost,38a9n4,itsGucciGucci,9,Tue Jun 2 22:37:00 2015 UTC,"I think the reason they have no ambition to leave the Island is because they think the Island saved Rose and if she left she could get sick again. After that, they were quite happy to see out their lives together staying put.  They don't offer much to the main plot after that apart from a couple of appearences here + there, but it's still a nice story.

Like Jacob's mom, Rose and Bernard seem to think that ""they come, they fight, they destroy, they corrupt"" and don't want to involve themselves in that. They would rather just enjoy the simple beauty of the island and ignore the drama, knowing that things will work themselves out in the end. So, in a way, Rose and Bernard understand the island much, much better than many of the other people in my opinion."

Bernard in particular was shown to bond with Jin and Rose had several scenes with Charlie. The Island was still the most important part of their lives and the other survivors were a large part of that.  Also, I'm sure they still lived for at least a decade or two after the MiB was defeated. That's a decade or two of hanging out with Hurley and a reformed Ben and the Others. Hell, maybe they even moved into the barracks. They looked like they enjoyed the hut, but they DID only build it out of necessity to not get caught by DHARMA."

They want to be together in the time they have.  They've built a gorgeous house over their three years on-Island (if you notice, they even have a garden.)  They've stayed out of the Dharma Initiative's way; the Others leave them alone, and so does MiB.  They basically are at peace with themselves, the rest of the Island inhabitants, and (presumably) the Island.  Hurley has shown being close to Rose from early Season Two on.  He shares a touching moment with Bernard (""Cannonball!"") right before he finds out about Charlie's death.  Unfortunately he doesn't listen to Rose when they split up at the fuselage (Rose says, ""I'm not going anywhere with that man,"" meaning Locke, and later Hurley admits as much to Jack, in 4x01 when he apologizes to Jack for not going back to the beach with him.)  I think Rose and Bernard are left alive at the end because they are going to serve as the nucleus of whatever ""new, better way"" Hurley incorporates on the Island.  Whatever survivors there are, whatever new people show up, someone has to be there to pull together the ordinary, humble activities which make up everyday life.  They're perfectly suited for it."

In fact, their relationship was also black and white (litterally).  Jacob and MiB....black and white game pieces, Locke & Jack, survivors and others, etc....  Rose accepted her fate before the island, but Bernard refused...it caused conflict - which was resolved because of the island.

lost,38akya,mdz1,2,Wed Jun 3 14:54:05 2015 UTC,I agree with you to an extent. I enjoy the character Ben for what he is but I think he is one of the worst things to happen to the show. The writers fell in love with him too much and he essentially gave them a get out of jail free card to justify their inability to stick to any on explanation for the mythology (since oh well he just likes to lie even if its lying for the sake of lying and in no way to benefit him) and that they thought he could redeem him (at least without him making a significant sacrifice) is ridiculous. That they were more concerned with resolving Ben's character than any of the original 815ers outside of Jack is a huge shame.
lost,38akya,stef_bee,1 point,Thu Jun 4 01:53:58 2015 UTC,"Ben is supremely socially savvy, and politically pretty effective.  I agree that he's terrifying in how deeply evil his deeds are.  The part where I disagree is that he would be some porn-addicted, ineffectual bundle of resentment wasting his time fuming on the internet.  Ben is a man of action, the ruler of his passions, rather than being ruled by them.    His actions are terrible, made worse by ""the banality of evil"" which he shows.  Were he to receive justice, I don't even want to think what that would look like.  It would be gruesome.  Ben doesn't get justice, though.  He receives mercy.  I think the story did this, not to turn Ben into a Mary Sue, but because it shows us beyond a doubt two things: one, that mercy is incredibly broad and wide when someone is genuinely sorry, as I think Ben is. That scene where he tells Ilana that he's going to join MiB ""because no one else will have me"" is his low point.  ""I'll have you,"" Ilana says, and that puts him back on the human path, the one he probably hasn't been on since he was twelve years old, before he got shot.

And then when the actual name of the Lamp Post station was revealed, an independent page was created for it, the information was moved from the ""Lighthouse"" page to the Lamp Post Station page, and then they just came back and filled in the ""Lighthouse"" page with the Lighthouse information once a Lighthouse was revealed in the show (rather than creating yet another brand new page from scratch for it).  EDIT: For a little more information, Lostpedia says this: ""The Lamp Post was first hinted at from a logo released in the course of the alternate reality game Dharma Initiative Recruiting Project. A Dharma Special Access e-mail described it as a ""yet-unseen Dharma station"", and the logo was visible for a split second at the end of the Dec. 9, 2008 video with Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse.""  http://lostpedia.wikia.com/wiki/Lamp_post#Logo  The tiny, hard-to-make-out Lamp Post symbol kind of looked like a lighthouse, which also contributed to the misunderstanding."

If they had three more seasons in them, ABC would've gladly let them run the show until too many people quit watching (that was ABC's plan to begin with since that's how American television tends to work).  Widmore's appearance isn't sudden at all. They spent a lot of the last few seasons building up to that by showing his intense effort to find the island. Him finally getting there is just an obvious conclusion of that whole storyline. If pulling a freighter up to the island in season four wasn't enough of a hint, I don't know what would be.

They can't both be what they claim to be. So when Jughead goes off, it creates two timelines, one in which the unstoppable force wins, and one in which the immovable object wins. The characters get to experience both outcomes but because they are still the same people they remember Timeline #1 when they reunite in Timeline #2.

Kate and Sun, and the latter was paired with Jin.  It's just a result of more male characters on the show, giving us more stories with stronger and more fascinating character arcs. And that I found Kate's episodes often to be among the weaker ones in the seasons, except for a select few"

It's an ensemble show, so I think an ensemble figure display makes more sense. Personally, at least.

The dharma debriefing was unnecessary and I'm glad they cut that scene out. A lot of the questions it answered were already answered in more subtle ways throughout the show.
lost,37pj5r,Penelopise,5,Fri May 29 13:17:16 2015 UTC,There's nowhere in the episode where they would have fit.
lost,37pj5r,stef_bee,2,Fri May 29 16:09:03 2015 UTC,"I'm very glad they didn't include the epilogue Walt-footage in the finale.  The last we saw Walt in-show was when he and his grandmother visited Hugo in Santa Rosa.  It was just fine to (in viewers' minds) stick them on a plane back for NYC, and let Walt go on with his life."
lost,37pj5r,Penelopise,2,Fri May 29 18:43:05 2015 UTC,Makes me wonder how Walt even wound up in Santa Rosa instead of some place in New York. Maybe he went to L.A. trying to find answers after the Ajira flight disappeared. That gap could make an interesting comic or something.
lost,37pj5r,stef_bee,2,Sat May 30 00:42:05 2015 UTC,"The implication in-show is that Santa Rosa is where you wind up if the Island has ""burned"" or damaged you in some way (Lenny Simms.)  Walt's grandmother would have been familiar with Santa Rosa, because she took Walt there to visit Hugo (""There's No Place Like Home, Part 2"")    I can imagine some foundation or trust set up with Hugo's money supporting Walt in his schooling, as well as paying for any inpatient hospitalization.  Mental health care in the USA is unbelievably expensive, and insurance coverage is weak.  If the ""Reyes Foundation"" is paying, they would probably recommend Santa Rosa.    It just occurred to me how awful this would be for Walt's mother: she loses her son, and then her grandson (who wouldn't be more than 15 or 16 at the time) gets kidnapped out of the hospital and disappears.  Ben and Hugo are looking at some serious charges if they ever show their faces in the states again..."

lost,37pj5r,stef_bee,2,Mon Jun 1 02:01:44 2015 UTC,That's a plausible scenario: Walt loses his grandmother; snaps from the resultant stress; powers manifest (again?) Walt certainly does look lonely in those NMIC shots.

In ""Meet Kevin Johnson,"" Michael's mother is furious with Michael because he told Walt about Ana and Libby (a scene we didn't see.)  That's going to mess up a kid badly.

Damon Lindelof, especially, had a troubled relationship with his cold and distant father (who abandoned the family, eventually.)  This article reveals that Lindelof's parents  split up when Lindelof was 11 (about the age Hugo is when David Reyes walks away.)  Normally I don't like the FSW that much, but it does provide a kind of resolution for Jack, when he gets to parent his son David; in an attempt to break the cycle of paternal neglect, so that he can find some closure."

lost,37qvrq,GodZDeaD,3,Sat May 30 12:54:43 2015 UTC,"It seems to me as if the Island replaces the fallen father figure. It's a long argument, and very psychological in nature, but essentially, all the characters repressed the father archetype (in one way or another) and the Island, symbolicaly speaking, takes on the role of the previously-fallen father. Be it in terms of a spiritual guiding figure or, in other cases, an authoritarian one. I have a lot of arguments surrounding this thesis which I have been developing for far too long. I might put it in a more articulate fashion one of these days.     Other than that, the only father-son relationship that is somewhat okay is the David-Jack Shepard in the Redemption timeline. I have a text file listing all the characters and there is not ONE that doesn't have major dysfunctionalities with the father-son dyad."

I didn't realize you posted this but I shared this little blurb of my own on another thread concerning the daddy issues:  I'm assuming the daddy issues are a metaphor for a strained relationship with a higher being, for the show's sake that would be The Island. Jacob didn't even have a father, and the Man in Black sought desperately to create his own destiny by leaving the island and foregoing the power of the island. He was the Nietzsche of the island proclaiming that ""God is dead.""  It makes the most sense when interpreting this show. Forget about the science and plot holes, the show has always been spiritual/psychological/philosophical at it's core. This argument has been overlooked but I think it actually encapsulates the essence of the show more than anything else I've come across. Nice job thinking on it!"

Locke and Boone follow a set of trails. They actually walked right past the medical station. Could it be that one of Ethan's helpers went back to the station while Ethan was going to hang Charlie? Here's Locke and Boone And here's the location of The Staff station in season season 3 and 4. The same location Locke and Boone walked past. When Locke picks up the L from Charlie's LATE-bandages, the scene works like the flashes or remember-montages later in the show. Quick white flash, a short ""whoosh"", some pictures, then a quick flash back to reality. The sound effect is very similar."

I found it interesting that even though Walt was adopted by Brian Porter, he isn't referred anywhere as Walt Porter, but as Walt Lloyd.  His name would have been legally changed to Porter with the adoption: so he himself is in a sense not using his ""real"" name, either."

If I happened to be flying with some of the people I cared about, and they survived and made it til the end? I'd definitely stay. Because 1, shunning all currency and technology would be incredible. Annoying, maybe, but only at first. I did a study abroad where the only thing I had that was mildly technological was my phone and no signal or internet, and it was incredible. I had books and my clothes and a couple essential toiletries, like Sawyer did, but that's it, and after the annoyance of it passed, it was immensely freeing. If I had the people I care about with me, say some of my family and my SO and a friend or two from home, it would be fucking amazing for us to all pool our duty to protect the island. Assuming we could survive the wilderness... I know my parents couldn't.  If I had nothing to go home to, alternatively, I'd still definitely stay."

While it was blown up you'd think with their endless money there's another sub that could easily replace that one. AND some hard core Lost fans will have to correct me if im wrong but I think I remember Ben saying after he sub was blown up that there won't be anyone visiting again for a few months. Meaning no one outside the island knows it was blown up but another routine resupply will still happen. I guess their mainland US organization had a lot of resources. So as long as I could visit the mainland to see some family and experience a philly cheese steak once or twice a year even if for a ""weekend"" pass I'd gladly stay on the island. Ben and a few others apparently visited the mainland at times so if you're high enough up I guess that's possible. Plus it seems like you never age while there. You could live on the island and see how the world changes over time with the rest of the world. In a sense you're a time traveler, just only able to move forward. I'd do it without much hesitation. I come from a small family so as long as I could see them sometimes I'd be fine. And the island residents would be a family of sorts too."

lost,37jlew,JDawn747,0,Thu May 28 12:39:21 2015 UTC,"The first couple episodes I was noticing every plot hole and telling myself I'm about to bail. I think by episode six I was into it enough and by the end of the first season I was hooked. Definitely a series that if you think you may want to cut an run, give it at least three to six episodes. A lot if the kinks get ironed out and it becomes basically a decent series.  My main problem really was that it seemed too far fetched. I get that it's TV. But all the ""criminals"" who are chosen happen to be early 20s? And all seem kinda sorta perfect? It seems geared mainly toward high school an early 20-something viewers to me. I doubt my parents would be into it but I could relate enough to keep watching. But after they started working together as a team and the predictable backstabbing of different clicks within the same group evaporated I got more into the show.  Then it began to seem like the tv show LOST. They'd encounter a mysterious something out in the woods. Or the thrill of wanting to know what and who was up in those mountains. And the secret group hiding in the mountain bunker reminded me of LOSTs Dharma bunkers. I think of you're into old abandon houses and just old houses and abandon buildings growing up as a kid, you automatically stay glued to a tv show when you hear there's an old base or bunker about to be explored in a tv show. And I'm so that guy. Of course I'm also the spooky autumn weather rather than spring kind of person. The show has enough of the possibly gloomy future-ish feel similar to the rebooted version of Battlestar Galactica from the early 2000s did. That post apocalyptic feel.   The only down side to me is that I've watched every episode of every season and then to find out I can't watch a new episode until summer of 2016.  As much as I've become a big fan I the show I hope they understand most tv shows used to only have a month less time between episodes. And from what I hear they're filming now. It's not Game of Thrones, I don't see why they need a full 12 months before having any episodes ready. The shows not Shakespeare but it's in my top five shows to watch kinda list because it just works for me. Making me wait until summer of 2016 before I see a new episode and they risk losing viewers who will forget to even watch in a year. At this point in going to have to add a reminder note on google calendar."

It really added to the fun, and especially after a season would end and we'd have to wait months for our next fix we at least had places online to chat amongst ourselves and dissect the show even more."

lost,37hbtq,Atomj26,2,Wed May 27 17:26:57 2015 UTC,"Not for nothing, but ""duh"". ;-) It's totally foreshadowing and highlighting the number-one theme of the show - the battle between light and dark. That is absolutely the only reason that line exists.  I highly recommend - and this is the perfect time since you're starting a rewatch - browsing through Lostpedia, the Lost Wiki. It was built as the show aired and is so monumentally well-done, cross-references, themes, unanswered questions and possible explanations, that it's very unlikely there is a question you could have that is not discussed somewhere in its pages. You can also browse it freely without risking spoilers, since you've seen the show already.  Here's its exploration of the theme of black and white in the show. Even the page on Backgammon is illuminating on some of what transpires later in the show."

lost,37hbtq,PepsiPerfect,1 point,Wed May 27 17:54:13 2015 UTC,"It's interesting how some of the strongest foreshadowing was so early in the show. It speaks to the fact that they had a very rough ""endgame"" planned, but no specific ideas about how to get there. That's because with a television series of this kind, they couldn't predict how long it would last. So every season they had to invent new complications.  Based on everything I've read behind the scenes, the creators had a modest list of things that they thought would be cool to include-- a mysterious hatch, the presence of other people on the Island, etc. But they exhausted most of those ideas by the end of season 2, which was why season 3 was such a drag for the first half. They had to plan out a more detailed path to the ending and then convince the network to let them execute it in a set amount of time. Also, by that point, the show was so popular that they felt more freedom to go with some of their crazier ideas, like time travel and the idea that some of the survivors would make it off the Island."

Don't let an episode play in the background or divide your attention between an episode and your phone, etc.  Watch for connections between the characters, especially in their flashback stories. Try to remember as many names as you hear and who they are. And try to use the information the show has given you to figure out or guess what's going to happen next; it makes the experience more fun. (Just be sure to recognize the limitations and rules that the show establishes to keep your theories in check.) Don't look up anything; if you're confused by something, rewatch the episode, just keep watching, or ask for clarification here (though be careful about asking for clarification here as there are still people around who try to spoil the new watchers).  I don't want to say what my favorite seasons and episodes were because I don't want to accidentally influence you one way or the other, but the whole show is great, IMO. Sit back and enjoy.  EDIT: There is also some out-of-show content that's worth looking into if you're really invested in the show, but if you're still kind of on the fence, just stick to the main show for now."

Like by changing the outcome of an early event (maybe killing Jack at the beginning like they originally planned) or doing some sort of ""alternate history"" thing (maybe Ben never got Widmore banished; maybe it was Jacob who died and fell into the Source). I guess it would be like a parallel universe sort of reboot.  Have to say, it's really hard to imagine the same characters played by different actors.

(A couple of non-canon and semi-canon sources say the statue depicts the goddess Taweret, but Sobek is another popular candidate that physically matches the statue a little bit more closely.) Regardless of which god it is, since we know that the Egyptians eventually came to the island and created things on the island adorned in hieroglyphics and other depictions of their gods, we can conclude that the Egyptians are also responsible for the statue.  The big unresolved question is whether the Egyptians came after the Mother died or before Jacob/the MIB were born. We don't see any Egyptian artifacts on the island during ""Across the Sea"", which makes it seem like the Egyptians came afterward (but we do only see a small portion of the island, so just as it took two whole seasons for the survivors to see the statue, it's possible that the statue could have been on the island but out of sight during ""Across the Sea""), but since the Mother, Jacob, the MIB, Claudia, etc. all spoke Latin, which became popular after the age of the Egyptian hieroglyphs and god worship began to die down, that makes it seem like the Egyptians would have had to come before them (though it is important to note that these things were just dying down; they hadn't gone out of style completely).  Of course since there's time travel, this may be a moot point anyway.  But given the carving of Anubis and what most people interpret to be the smoke monster facing off against one another down in the temple, that seems to suggest that the Egyptians did encounter the smoke monster at some point. So if the MIB was the only smoke monster ever on the island, that also points towards the Egyptians showing up after the Mother died. But if there have been other smoke monsters in the past (or if that drawing isn't a depiction of the smoke monster), then it could go either way. Ultimately both arguments (i.e., the Egyptians coming to the island before the Mother died or after the Mother died) hold roughly the same amount of weight."
lost,378r40,Petrichor02,2,Mon May 25 21:46:53 2015 UTC,I thought mother was supposed to have been a smoke monster as well- hence how she obliterated all of MIB's people. Am I completely mistaken?
lost,378r40,rematch728,0,Fri May 29 03:51:51 2015 UTC,"That is a popular theory, but it doesn't necessarily have to be true. The smoke monster derives all of its powers from the Source. As protector of the island, the Mother (and Jacob) are able to use the powers of the Source. Theoretically the protector of the island has all the same powers that the smoke monster has. So if the smoke monster is able to obliterate all of MIB's people, the protector could also use those same powers to obliterate all of MIB's people. So it could really go either way."

lost,3775wh,Petrichor02,1 point,Tue May 26 14:38:09 2015 UTC,"Well, it depends what vibe you're after, for sure. I'd compare S to Lost in that it's a story within a story within a story, all of which have to do with a mystery that the ""main"" characters find themselves at the center of. Clues are dropped throughout the book, including the main character's thoughts from different points in the story and actual, physical clues that you can hold.  I'd say the multiple stories + mysteries + clues for the reader is very Lostian."

There is an old miniseries of The Stand that aired on network TV. It was on Netflix for a while but I don't know if it still is. It's very divisive; most people who like the book don't seem to care for the miniseries, but I enjoyed it. Inevitably with a book as long as The Stand, a lot of material is going to be left out of the series.  However, I have heard that they are planning a series of feature films now, so maybe we will get a better version."

He'd tape the show on his VCR and we'd watch the episode AGAIN right after it aired in our quest to pull every last clue out of the show.

I'm kind of surprised that you could conclude after watching one episode that you don't like a show, but I'll be honest in saying that I was 50/50 or less on Twin Peaks the whole way through.   David Lynch takes the surrealism a bit far, IMO. But the show is funny and stylistically interesting and creepy and weird af.   I'm not sure where you're making the lost connect though. Comparing Lost and TP is like comparing apples and... well some sort of inedible objects.   Why is Ayn Rand recommended by some Thomas the Tank Engine fans?  Why is Archer recommended by some people who have a sense of humor?   Mysteries of our time, man. Mysteries of our time."

Both shows are about a main character (Jack, Dale Cooper) arriving at a mysterious place of magical power (The Island, the town of Twin Peaks) and being initiated into the occult mystery religions. They’re probably the two most overtly masonic shows to ever air on television."
lost,377lj4,Bakatcha_Bandit,1 point,Tue May 26 16:15:21 2015 UTC,"Besides the surface-level similarities-- serial format, long-standing mysteries, large cast, etc.-- there are much deeper connections between Lost and Twin Peaks. I was also a Lost fan who had Twin Peaks recommended to me, and boy am I glad it was. It has become my third favorite TV show of all time as a result.  Twin Peaks is a hard sell to a lot of people though, for a number of reasons. First of all, it has some MAJOR ups and downs. It starts slowly. By halfway through the first season, though, it had me hooked. Second, the supernatural stuff doesn't really start to intensify until the second season. Third, it's David Lynch, and David Lynch is weird. He's kind of an acquired taste that some people never develop.  Then, midway through that season, for story reasons I won't spoil, the narrative completely derails for about 8 or 9 episodes. The behind-the-scenes reason for this is because when rating started to slip, the network stepped in and started mandating creative choices to the production and writing team. When you watch it, you realize how lucky Lost was, because its ratings also began to slip in season 3-- significantly-- but the network never barged in and started dictating the story direction to the production. Quite the opposite, in fact.  So, at any rate, you have to suffer through about half a season worth of really not-great episodes until it ramps back up for the last four or five. And let me tell you, the season 2 finale is one of the best hours of television I've ever seen. I mean, it's right up there with the season 3 finale of Lost.  So overall, if you stick with Twin Peaks, I think you will find it to be worth the trip, and you will see why it's so often compared to Lost."

And even before then no one was really starving, they had plane food at first, plus a significant amount of fish and fruit and wild boar, and they eventually got all the normal Dharma food they could want. After they got their footing, I don't think I really remember hunger being a real issue for the 815 survivors they way it was for the Night's Watch during that part of the story.  Not to mention, I really don't understand why everyone singles out Hurley, realistically, he's actually the last person to point out isn't getting smaller.

The only other frame of reference we have is them talking about how the time-travel 30 years ago to July 1977, but I think it's much more likely for  someone to approximate 31 years to 30 years than two and a half years to three years if you know what I mean.

He becomes a more minor character for the last several seasons, though as /u/Shutupredneckman2 showed, he has a role in the epilogue and it's implied he gets into more adventures with the characters after the show is over.  As for his ""specialness"" never being explained, I don't think it was really meant to be in a concrete place. Walt is special for the same reason Harry Potter or Mr. Incredible is special, just because it's a part of the universe that some people (Walt, Hurley, Miles, Rose's faith healer, even Desmond) can do crazy things. The writers often eluded to Star Wars when it came to explaining things too concretely, pointing out how many people felt that the overly concrete/sci-fi explanation midichlorians kind of ruined to awesome mysteriousness of Jedis and The Force, and it's a strikingly similar situation here.

Bernard brings Rose to a sort of faith healer in the Australian outback who explains that there are certain places over the Earth where there is a great geological/magnetic energy that can do crazy things like heal people. He tries to harness this energy to cure her cancer but fails and says, ""It's not that you can't be healed. Like I said, there's different energies. This is not the right place for you."" (transcript.) Clearly the right place for her, and for Locke as well, ended up being the Island, but it wasn't the right place for some other people, such as Shannon."
lost,374n6c,339970,5,Sun May 24 21:57:40 2015 UTC,"The island seems to be selective with who it chooses to heal. For instance, Jack gets appendicitis and Ben gets cancer, and both times it's made a note of how strange it is that they got sick on the island when they're supposed to get better. I think the implication is that the island wants them to be sick in order to catalyze whatever events happen going forward in a certain way.   In the case of the inhalers, the situation makes Kate aware of Sawyer's true past, which is the beginning of him breaking down his exterior  and becoming vulnerable."
lost,374n6c,ohhimark108,1 point,Sun May 24 21:39:34 2015 UTC,I'm not sure the real reason but it could have to do with the fact Locke needed to overcome paralysis to become great while on the island whereas Sharon had no real need to be cured because it wasn't holding her back from her destiny.

Jack tells her, ""Shannon, listen to me. Look at me, look at me. You need to listen now. This isn't just the asthma, it's anxiety...""  He treats her as if she is having a panic attack, and she responds.    We never see her have another attack.  She never gets her inhalers at all; she never gets medical treatment for asthma, and manages to survive until she was murdered.  I think it's safe to say that the Island probably did heal Shannon's asthma."

lost,370q8k,cmae34lars,4,Sat May 23 19:57:31 2015 UTC,"But it doesn't make sense for Lost. Everyone on the Island (besides Locke generally) is always looking for some coincidence to explain away the issue at hand when really fate is to blame. Sometimes you just need to let go, not everything needs an explanation. Some things are just meant to happen."
lost,370q8k,theverybest27,3,Sat May 23 20:01:48 2015 UTC,"Well, I think it makes sense in context. Eko and Locke are both ""men of faith,"" but Locke is a little more extreme sometimes, just desperatly trying to find anything that could be a sign that he and his beliefs are important whereas Eli is a little more rational (for example, he didn't immediately believe that girl from his flashback had come back to life). In the scene where he says it, Locke is holding the film in awe acting like it was some personal gift from the universe and Eko cuts in with ""Woah, calm down buddy, sometimes it's just a coincidence.  This may be a bit of over-analysis on my part, but it's also possible that was a reference for the fans. If you were an active fan at the time, you'd know certain fans were notorious for taking the tiniest background detail or continuity error or something and hailing it as the answer to life, the universe and everything. The line works on its own, but it could double as a little joke about that."
lost,370q8k,339970,0,Sat May 23 21:01:33 2015 UTC,"Well when you look at the particular scene, Locke says something like ""What are the odds?"" and Eko says ""Don't mistake coincidence for fate"" so it just seems like Eko mixed the words up."
lost,370q8k,339970,2,Sun May 24 01:48:36 2015 UTC,"You're right that he literally says ""What are the odds?"" but the rest of the line and the way it's delivered makes it clear he's not seriously asking, it's a rhetorical question to basically say ""Wow, there's no way this is a coincidence, we were the chosen ones to bring these pieces together!"" And then the Eko kind of tries to bring him down to Earth, pointing out that sometimes it's a coincidence. Not saying that there's no such thing as fate or anything like that, just that coincidence exists and shouldn't be disregarded; not every tiny thing is a sign.  I assume you're just talking about what makes sense when you say it seems like Eko mixed the words up, but I've actually talked to someone who believed it was a real possibility, pointing out that English wasn't his first language and maybe he didn't recognize that grammatically it would be the other way around. I don't really remember his English grammar being poor at all at other parts of the show, but I may just be forgetting; either way I don't see them purposely writing a fairly important line the opposite of what it should be and hoping people would pick up on it. I see it being put in there to begin to establish the more rational side of Eko that was explored more later; I must say I think that aspect was quite cool and it's a shame the character wasn't around long enough to delve into it more :("

lost,36yom1,james7459,9,Sat May 23 06:03:31 2015 UTC,"You are technically correct on everything, but you've got some of the little details wrong.  For example, the island's abilities aren't magic so much as they are science and pseudoscience stretched to currently impossible limits. But since all of the island's abilities are based on real world theory, they all have clear limitations, and they are finite in number (the island can do 4 things with its electromagnetism and 2 things with its exotic matter), it seems wrong to qualify them as ""magic"", IMO.  Also, several people did end up leaving the island, as others have said. Sawyer, Frank, Miles, Kate, Claire, and Richard all got off the island on the Ajira plane. Hurley presumably brought Desmond back to the mainland. And he may have eventually taken some of the Others back to the mainland like Zach and Emma. But you are right that no one else ever came to the island specifically to rescue those who were still on the island.  The flash-sideways is a place where your consciousness goes in your dying moments, not after you die. Note that as Juliet was dying on-island, she started saying things that we later hear her say in the flash-sideways. Her body was still alive but her mind was in the flash-sideways. This is also why we see the church scene interspersed between moments of Jack dying: the audience is seeing what Jack is seeing in his dying moments.  You are free to interpret the church scene as the characters being led into the afterlife.

The flash sideways universe is a ""purgatory"" of sorts; for want of another word it is just a place for the Losties to meet up after they died so that they could move on (whether that be to heaven, to be reincarnated, or whatever you believe in) together. I believe that the writers thought to include the scene of the island in the first episode of season 6 as a red herring, to make people believe that when Juliet detonated the H bomb, it worked.

In the start, Ben just wanted a general canvas of who was on the plan (that is, everyone) so he could know who to exploit and how. That has nothing to do with either Alpert , or Jacob's candidates."

Also, I can't in any way imagine Hurley running the Island like this.  If you want to know what kind of protector Hurley is going to be, I think ""Tricia Tanaka is Dead"" pretty much tells us, as well as the Hurley-Sawyer B-arcs in Season 3.  In TTID, Hurley draws everyone together to start the van: guys who just weeks before hated each other and weren't speaking, or someone like Charlie who was seriously depressed about his fate.  (I could go back to Season 1 with Hurley's golf course, but by Season 3 the creatives probably did know where they were going with the end-game.)  Hurley is allergic to lying (even if he does it once in awhile for a good cause, like his conning of Sawyer.)  I can't see him sustaining layer after layer of lies the way Ben did.  Further, Hurley isn't into non-intervention the way Jacob was.  ""When you warn, you warn.""  When someone is hurt, he takes care of them (Eko, Naomi, Sayid.)  When they're alienated, he draws them in.     For another, Hurley isn't going to have the same crazy pressures and conflicts.  The Smoke Monster is gone.  And it may well be that women aren't going to die anymore in pregnancy, a theory which /u/339970 came up with, which I think is brilliant.  That would make him miserable, to see people on-Island suffering like that."

In fact, someone wrote a very short little story about that (it was published a few weeks before the LOST finale, so it's not totally consistent with how things turned out.)  It's really consistent with what kind of protector Hugo would be, though.  ETA: OK, so the story I linked to isn't quite the ghost scenario you mentioned, but I can still see the same type of interchanges between MiB and Hugo, whether MiB was a ghost or not."

As far as I can remember, there's no one specific moment where someone looks at the camera and explains that (the closest you get is a few conversations about choosing good people and giving them a better life) but we see it happen with a few characters from 815, Dharma, the army over the course of the show. To me that's an answer to a mystery done right, where it's clearly what they had in mind you can easily figure it out if you're paying attention, but there's no inorganic moment of ""the answer"" like they eventually tried to do in the last season a few times.  As for why they took Walt, same reason, they want to expand their society and can't have kids so they take them. It had nothing to do with his powers, from everything we see it seems they didn't even know he had powers until after they took him, they only found out later and decided to test them as long as they had him; in fact his powers actually really freaked him out which is why they were willing to let him go."

Even Damon and Carlton joked about that in the podcast after the episode ran. Or how they edit the promos like for Dave when it looked like Sayid kills Henry Gale and that Libby pushes over Hurley/Hurley pushes over Libby off the cliff. Even more laughable is the ones where they add gunshot-effects, like the end of the promo for The Last Recruit with Sayid shooting Desmond.  There's a lot of nice trailers by fans.

It was never really a secret.  I remember reading in tv guide magazine (when it was still small) that she would guest in the finale and be a regular for season 2.  Most articles speculated her fate as early as before the season 1 finale (since she only signed for a season).  Of course there were also rumors she would be strictly in flashbacks, but the season 1 finale pretty much squashed those rumors.  3)  During the podcasts leading up to that episode, Damon and Carlton were openly upset that people didn't like Ana.

Personally, I think this is a half truth. I think they did plan on killing Ana Lucia, but when they both got pulled over, this just solidified their fates."
lost,36kugj,Petrichor02,3,Wed May 20 10:07:38 2015 UTC,"The writers have stated that they actually considered changing their plans to keep Ana Lucia and Libby alive once they got the DUIs because they didn't want the audience thinking ABC was sending a message by having them kill off actors because of DUIs.

In a lot of other shows you might get one main character death per season, but in Lost you get like 5. Also, I would have loved to see Libby and Ana Lucia stay longer, but if it's any consolation, so did the writers. They didn't want to kill them so early. IIRC, either the actors wanted off or the show wanted the actors gone or something like that. So it wasn't because the characters weren't good enough to stick around.

I was recommended to watch LOST after watching Battlestar Galactica (which was an AMAZING story as far as character development goes), and it seems like every single women's death thus far has been there solely to advance the story of their male counterparts. The issue I'm having is that all the women that have died are 100% more interesting to me (and have so much more visible, clear growth to go through) than, say, Kate, Claire and even Sun to a degree. Sun is easily my favorite left, but her character arc seems finished in a way. She doesn't seem like she has too much more personal growth she really needs to come full circle, at least not to the extent that Shannon or Ana Lucia could have had."

The second anyone else starts having visions or saying something is their fate he gets very eye-roll-y at them. When Charlie starts saying he's had dreams of someone stealing Claire's baby and needing to baptise it Locke gets immediately skeptical and there isn't a shred of understanding in him. When Eko talks about having a destiny Locke raises an eyebrow. Things like that make him come across as smarmy and self-righteous more than the way he was originally presented--but then he flips around and goes back to being his guru-ish self again. When a character acts one way when the episode focuses on them, but their morals completely switch when they're a filler character in an episode that focuses on someone else: that's sloppy."

Maybe Locke thougt hes using again? And i completely disagree with that he just raises an eyebrow when Eko starts talking about destiny, i dont know how far in you are but you will see that its not the case at all and Locke can probably relate to Eko more than to anyone else on the Island at that point.

lost,36kugj,Zetsubouromance,2,Wed May 20 17:08:45 2015 UTC,"Honestly, Lost has the same issues with writing women as most modern shows. I'm not sure I recall the women being significantly more disposable than men, but they do seem more prone to cliches and squandered potential (see: Kate). As much as I do love the show, it's not where I turn when looking for a good dose of really well-written leading women. They each have their moments, but overall, they're what I'd typically expect.  From your other comments, it seems like you have a similar taste in characters as I did in season 2 (although I've always liked Hurley). Give season 3 a go. You'll probably like Juliet, who is introduced in the first episode of that season, I believe. My personal favorite character in the whole show is ""Henry Gale,"" but YMMV."
lost,36kugj,DavidAMIs,5,Wed May 20 09:07:29 2015 UTC,"Cliched and full of squandered potential is the PERFECT way to describe Kate. I really liked her at first and she seems to have been turned into a tagalong for Jack and Sawyer at this point. I'm not into shows with well written women specifically, just well-written characters in general. I'm coming to Lost off a recommendation after watching Battlestar Galactica, which was an AMAZING character study and had a cast full of characters that really came full circle. It just seems that, with Lost, the characters that get the shaft more often than not are females. So far there have been 4 important deaths. The three women that died solely died to advance their male counterpart's stories. The only male that died, Boone, died to advance Shannon's (and Locke? I guess?) story. That alone is sort of problematic, but my bigger problem is that the characters that have died had such clear potential for a TON of growth, while the characters that remain just seem so obvious--such obvious TV tropes, some of whom are very sloppily written (Locke, namely).   I am going to at least finish season 2, because this show seemed right up my ally, before making a call."

That could've been such an interesting journey for her and her character development! Her story gets worse in season 3, imho. Very focused on the love triangle thing. I think Evangeline Lilly got so sick of it, she specifically requested that there be no love triangle involved in her role in the Hobbit (but I hear they made a bunch of last-minute changes). It improves a little in later seasons, but ugh.  But yeah, I get where you're coming from. Hopefully it either picks up for you, or you find something you like better.

For me, I'm old enough to remember when pretty much every show had, like, one female character of note, who then didn't even appear most of the time.  There's nothing wrong with male characters; I love movies like The Thin Red Line or Saving Private Ryan, which are exclusively male in casting.  However, when you grow up as a girl, you do often tend to identify with the female characters.  Some of it is looking for role models; some of it is having someone to identify with, to 'project yourself' into the story, so to speak.  I've noticed that newer TV shows like The 100 for instance, do tend to have a wide variety of both male and female characters of widely different personalities; kind of ""something for everyone"" when it comes to being able to identify with characters, or feel that they're 'part of' the story."

The playing pieces are paper photos of the characters that you put inside plastic pieces, but there aren't enough plastic pieces,  so a third of the characters are just represented by pieces of paper sitting on the board. The board is a bunch of tiles that you flip over when you land on them, so flipping over any of the tiles in the middle is really inconvenient and threatens to shift everything around it out of place."

The amount of people who said there was no answers or they were dead the whole time without actually watching or investing in the show was annoying.  Lost was a show in which you had to invest in the characters as well as the story, you can't just casually watch it. Of all the people who were invested in it I'd say 80% loved the ending, whether immediately or after a rewatch.  The hundreds who slate it probably never really watched the series properly.  The lesson to be learned by Lindelof is that if you want to create a fantastic, mind provoking show you will get haters, but he needs to remember that Lost is classic which will leave a legacy for tv shows forever."

lost,36e314,ughalready,3,Mon May 18 19:09:22 2015 UTC,"Lost did a lot of things right, but also a lot of things wrong. It was a game changing TV show much like Xfiles was. It's what happens when you try and do something no one has really done before. Not having much of an idea where you are going or having the mindset that you are creating ""mysteries"" to get people to tune each next week and then ending up with so many you can't answer without evoking what is essentially magic to explain it isn't what people wanted. I think it would have been better to leave the island far more mysterious and leave it more open. What I found especially annoying was they had about 2 seasons at least knowing it was ending in season 6 but chose to ramp up the ""mysteries"" to ridiculous levels rather than try and craft a more sensible plot from what they already had.  I wish I could recommend Lost to people but it's so long and the pay off so bad I just can't. I liked the questions about science vs faith but in the end it just said big ""f you"" you science and tell us it really is all about faith in what is basically magic. And it's at once so lazy and the same time the only root they could take, because after a certain point there was no way to do it without evoking the supernatural. You think x is a plot hole? Nope! Here's a magical reason why it isn't! Lazy lazy lazy. If magic can be your explanation for everything then it lets you do anything, which takes away all the suspense. It's why Deus Ex Machina is such a bad way of dealing with a plot. From listening to interviews it feels like they were totally ok with not having a more intelligent way of dealing with it all, which is a shame. It would to me been far better to have built season 4,5 and 6 into something that left things up to interpretation for that ""science vs faith"" question, and still left it hanging a little. Sure people would have been pissed off still, but probably not so completely pissed off because we could have imagined a satisfying conclusion where either case applies.

Not that there is anything wrong with that, if that was the intent of the show. In fact, maybe it was. As early as the first few episodes of season 1, when Locke is teaching backgammon to Walt, he says its a simple game about two sides, black and white. He was pretty much eluding to the forces of good and evil in this mortal world, which was also basically setting the stage for all the events that would transpire on the island between then and the church.   I still really like the show, but thought it went to heavy on the magical or religious parts, when I personally more enjoyed the mystery and the weird science that they were discovering on the island seasons 1 through 3."

I do dislike the final season, and I do believe that Damon & Carlton screwed us over the whole time. They didn't deliver what they promised and lied to us the whole time. It doesn't change the fact that Lost is a work to reckon with. Even a lie can be beautiful and amazing."

I've always been confused why ppl hated the ending and what was wrong with it. It pretty much answered everything by the final episode and we know what happens to each person. So what was left to say an what was wrong or missing?  I honestly think it was good. It was the classic happy ending to characters I grew to love. They went off into the sunset kind if ending and we know a couple of them continue their work with the island. What's wrong with this ending and how was any ending promised that would be different? What questions remain? I've always been curious. It's not a critique btw I just think maybe I'm missing something by not understanding why some ppl are frustrated.

lost,36cror,339970,3,Mon May 18 12:04:05 2015 UTC,"Overall, I personally liked the last three seasons more than the first three, and season four is actually my favorite. But of all of them, it's certainly the least mysterious, most story-driven one, a lot of very interesting things happen to get from one thing but that leaves little time for the classic, dark mysteriousness. That's probably why I liked it the most, the twisty story was my personal favorite part of the show, not the atmosphere, (plus Daniel Faraday is my favourite character <3).  (If you didn't know, the reason season four was a little shorter than it was originally intended to be because of that writers strike; by raw episodes it didn't affect the season much, and the actually made up for it later, but it's possible they were rushing to get the essential parts of the story out not knowing how much time they would end up getting, which is possibly why it has a slightly different feeling.)  One other thing to keep in mind: as we learn more and more stuff, it by definition gets less mysterious, so yeah certain things seem more mundane as you get later in the show. A mystery is pretty much always more interesting than the answer, no matter how cool the explanation is. Some of the bigger, cooler mysteries the writers actually left more open-ended, often comparing it to the Force in Star Wars and how they didn't want to ruin cool, abstact ideas with overly concrete, sci-fi explanations like midichlorians in the prequels.  But starting with the season four finale that atmosphere does come back in the past few seasons, especially the last one, so I'd stick around if I were you. Do you happen to have any questions btw? Not spoilery things, just if you're confused about something."

I'm not sure exactly what episode you're up to, but you should have already learned he has some pretty severe brain/memory problems (for example, he could only remember two of three cards after a few minutes,) so he's never quite sure if what he's saying makes any sense.  That combined with general awkwardness, probably as a result of mild spoiler about part of his back-story; don't read if you particularly hate spoilers, but it doesn't ruin much, just makes him a quiet, nervous person in general.  Great question, the characters are really the best part of Lost to me and he's my favorite one, I'm glad someone was interested enough to wonder =)"

The time travel aspect is really only there so that seemingly impossible to resolve conflicts with mystery attatched to them are able to be resolved, but also are able to create more drama and character development. ( thats how i see it on the surface at least) real reasons are bit deeper :P i think personally  If time travel bothers you just brush over it and know that the whole series is worth watching , and that imo time travel's biggest purpose is for advancing the plot, in pretty much the most suiting LOST way and i'd say possible way.  and that the 5th season is LOTS of Dharma :D"

lost,36d4zd,Choekaas,2,Mon May 18 16:20:53 2015 UTC,I just finished it about a week ago. I couldn't talk about it to anyone for fear of spoilers!   One thing that bugged me throughout was that in 40 or so survivors from a plane full of people leaving Australia (for anywhere) there was just one Australian and two Asians. Surely statistically there would be about half a plane full of Australians leaving Australia and half a plane full of people going home (and a few on a world trip).
lost,36d4zd,smange,3,Mon May 18 19:00:20 2015 UTC,From my understanding those who survived were chosen to be on the island by the island itself. Just as it selected certain people to be on the plane at that particular time.
lost,36d4zd,Jobcv314,0,Mon May 18 19:36:04 2015 UTC,"I suppose that the island choosing people would throw off the statistics a little bit. I mean, it's statistically unlikely that the numbers would show up in random places that often.  However, my understanding is that the island/Jacob were bringing people to the island as potential replacements. It seems odd that so many of the remaining potential candidates would be American. Of the six not crossed out on the wall in Jacob's cave (4/Locke, 8/Hurley, 15/Sawyer, 16/Sayid, 23/Jack, and 42/Sun and/or Jin), four were Americans, one/two was Korean, and one was Iraqi.  In reality, it's probably just because this production was made in 'Murica, so it starred some 'Muricans. And we can say that the Iraqi guy was the result of the narrative possibilities of having a person who had fought against Americans in a recent conflict be a main character (played by someone of Indian descent, of course)."

lost,36d4zd,RichardPeterJohnson,1 point,Tue May 19 16:49:02 2015 UTC,"Surely statistically there would be about half a plane full of Australians leaving Australia and half a plane full of people going home   Well not quite, if that were exactly the case (which seems about right), you'd expect there to be about a proportional number of people as the populations of those countries. The population of Australia is about 1/12 that of America, so you'd expect about the same proportion as we see. I actually fly the Sydney-L.A. route and similar ones as a passenger quite often, and ever since I saw Lost I've been looking out for how many passengers are actually Australian and it's always very few.  Here are all of the passengers/crew of 815 I can think of off the top of my head (I'm probably missing a few, but it's the general idea):  Australian:   Claire Cindy   American:   Jack Kate* Edward Mars Locke Hurley Sawyer Libby Rose Bernard Ana Lucia Boone Shannon* Michael Walt* Arzt Frogurt Nikki Captain Seth Nooris Zach Emma   Neither:   Sun** Jin** Charlie Sayid** Nathan Eko* Paulo**   *Not Australian but had been living in Australia.  **Not American but were going to live in America.  That all seems pretty reasonable, especially when you consider that we don't know the nationality of most of the redshirts, so any slight inaccuracies in proportion could just be explained away as a result of the characters we happened to focus on."

The wreckage of flight 815 was not ""freshly crashed,"" it was rusted and crumbling. The plane became part of the landscape of the island, like the Black Rock; our survivor's stories became part of the tapestry of the island and it's stories as well."
lost,36dmyd,raeyne4,3,Mon May 18 21:20:46 2015 UTC,"Those shots were added by the network and not the show runners. They were meant to transition out of the show's emotional climax, not to add anything to the story.  http://www.ew.com/article/2010/05/26/lost-final-scenes-wreckage"
lost,36dmyd,OptionK,-1,Mon May 18 18:55:35 2015 UTC,"Frankly, I think that's a cop out by the show runners. Why would they let the network add a scene that, following the final scene that was set in a church and that appears to have ended with an ascension to heaven, gives the viewers the impression I (and many others!) had. If the creators didn't know that scene would run during the credits, they should have been absolutely furious when they saw it. It changes the context of the entire show."

I don't think the island was ""purgatory"", per se. I think the writers got too ahead of themselves and realized that there was no way they could realistically write themselves out of what they wrote themselves into. By making all the people dead the whole time, they could just explain everything away."

But you still prefer it to the interpretation based on the understanding of those shots asserted by the showrunners? I don't see how everyone having been dead all along actually gets them out of anything. It actually seems to cause more difficulty than anything else, in that it makes understanding the flash sideways impossible."
lost,36dmyd,OptionK,2,Mon May 18 20:24:20 2015 UTC,"if it was added by the network without consulting the show runners, that's really weird.   Yeah, show-runners don't really get to have much authority against the network. A network, or movie studio or whatever, really does what's best for itself and rarely do the creators get much input on the stuff that's not the product itself. If you listened to the official podcast while the show was on, the show-runners would sometimes complain or make fun of the ads and such the network put together, but weren't allowed to do anything about it. I don't see a network really caring what they thought, yet alone specifically going out of their way to get permission for something, especially something so mundane as what to slap over the credits, which every network does all the time.  It wasn't anyone who worked for the show who came out with the statement, it was some representative from ABC, this was clearly on them.  And either way it this is a weird argument to be having because they say/show on the show proper, plus several times outside that that is not the case."

The surviving passengers left it, and they took out then burned the dead ones in the main fuselage so as to not attract animals. Even if the creators did know the network was putting it there and could do something about it (which I'm really not sure if they could, you may be over-estimating their power,) I don't think they realized it would give people that impression, especially after they do mention explicitly in the episode that they were alive on the Island (i.e. ""The most...important part of your life, was the time that you spent with these people."").  I'm sure you're right that now, given the reaction the creators/network would have chosen something else, but at the time I could see why they wouldn't think it was a problem."

lost,36dmyd,Fats33,2,Mon May 18 18:42:38 2015 UTC,"Since no one seems to have seriously answered your question yet, here's a very general outline of what happens in the last season (in an order that makes sense for a summary, not in chronological order of what we see onscreen):   Juliet dies from her injuries after falling down the shaft. Sawyer is sad. Conflict and story between the characters happens that I won't get into (but in general I'd say it's pretty good and emotional). We find out that the Smoke Monster used to be a man, Jacob's twin brother, in fact, he became the way he is after being pushed into the very heart of where all the Island's electromagnetic energy comes from (pretty typical sci-fi/fantasy super-villain origin, honestly). He's been stuck on the Island his whole life and wants to leave, but he can't as long as Jacob is there, which is why he wanted to kill him last season. Even though Jacob is dead, Smokey (now in imitating Locke's body, if you remember) can't leave because Jacob had been chosen some available people who could be candidates to take his place after he died, including some of our characters,so Smokey would need to kill them too. He ends up managing to get Sun, Jin, Jack, and Sayid killed. In the end, of the surviving characters, Kate, Claire, Sawyer, Richard, Miles, and Frank manage to repair the Ajira plane and fly off the Island, presumably living the rest of their lives in the normal world. Hurley stays to protect the Island like Jacob had been doing, and Ben (and eventually Walt) stay to help him. There's also a kind of epilogue, (though being Lost it's not just stuck on chronologically at the end, we see bits of it the whole season,) where some many decades later, after all of the characters have died, they meet up again in that ""between places"" sort of afterlife we'd heard about a few times, and ""move on"" together. It was a nice opportunity to see all the characters again for a last time.   In my personal opinion, the last season is a whole lot of fun to watch. People inevitably hate on it because it was the last season and they expected the best thing ever, but in general I'd say many parts of it are better than many parts of the first few seasons. If you find yourself with some free time I wouldn't hesitate to give it a try just because you know what happens, it has several great character moments and I'll admit I cried a couple times.  That was just one of the most bare-bones summary I could think of, do you have any questions about anything else specifically??"

If I hadn't already known the premise and the general attitude of the show and where it would go I would have a slightly different perspective on the show.  Due to the several hiccups in later seasons, it is easy to get confused or think things are going off course, but there is a lot of extrapolation needed in spite of this.  I like seeing these things that connect from the past seasons as well as making up my own logical explanations to things I thought were not answered, only to actually have someone else reveal to me the actual intentions to a seemingly made up plot position to progress story"

lost,368q7t,339970,1 point,Sun May 17 08:22:51 2015 UTC,"Well, 117/118 is just the number of episodes they're credited for, not how many they actually appear in. If an actor is given main star credit for a season, then they're credited for every episode even if they didn't appear in all of them. Interestingly, none of the characters in Lost appeared in every episode, not even close, even Jack who appeared in the most missed nine of them (Hurley misses fifteen).  Here's a handy chart of how many episodes some of the more major characters appeared in. Even that's a little misleading though because it counts the raw number of times they appear in a literal sense, not their actual importance. In the episode The Substitute, for example, when MIB and Sawyer are going over the final candidates it briefly flashses to when Jacob touched each of them; Jack, Jin, and Sayid don't appear in that episode other than that one second of archived footage, but it still counts for the purposes of that chart. It would also count if a character just walks by in the background for a few frames, or appears as a corpse or something.  That was actually one of my favourite aspects of the show, it's an ensemble cast done right, it didn't rely on a few major characters to carry every episode. If you're interested, here's a list of how many episodes each character appeared in and in what capacity, if you're interested you should really look around Lostpedia, they have a lot of really cool articles like this =)"

lost,368q7t,olily,12,Sun May 17 14:27:46 2015 UTC,"There's no religious bias in the finale. The flash-sideways realm isn't an afterlife realm. It was heavily hinted back in Season 2 to take place during your dying moments, not after you've died, and then that was confirmed in the Season 6 premiere when the still-alive Juliet on-island started saying things that she was also saying in the flash-sideways.  Furthermore, the church in the flash-sideways that they met up in was the DHARMA Lamp Post station, a place of balance between science and faith.  So there was no religious bias there or science bias there. The viewer was presented with every element so that they could choose for themselves whether the flash-sideways had any spiritual element to it. You are free to view the flash-sideways as having no spiritual element if you like, and the evidence would support you just as well as if you chose to view the flash-sideways as having a spiritual element.

It very clearly showed characters dying, and then you had the idea that they were going to go to the afterlife.   As I explained in my previous post, the evidence in the show tells us that the flash-sideways is a place you go in your dying moments. The light filling the church was the characters moving on into death, not an afterlife. (Granted, if there are any afterlives in the LOST universe, the characters would move into those afterlives right after dying, but the church and flash-sideways was about dying and accepting death, not the afterlife.)   The answer to the Island was magic   Every question was actually answered by some property of electromagnetism or negatively charged exotic matter, occasionally stretched to sci-fi proportions. Granted, if you think lightsabers and other such explained-by-sci-fi-""science"" things are the same thing as ""magic"", you'd be correct, but the answers never feel like magic because they all tie back to a set of strict rules and never deviate from those rules.  In the LOST universe, electromagnetism can only do 4 things, and exotic matter can only do 2 things (or just 1 thing if you look at it like a physicist). Every answer fell within one of those 6 (5) categories."

The thing that Heroes did well was the development of individual characters as they encountered their powers; that's largely a later-season Lost trait (say, 5 & 6), as in the earlier seasons they preferred just to contrast historical conflict with present-day conflict. That's not bad, it's good, and it's what made Lost great. But it's why the shows are different; the characters are defined by their powers, there's no rich (and overlapping) history.  There's a level of intrigue, but it's not that high, and it's resolved fairly quickly (and beyond the first season, there's really not that much of it at all that doesn't feel completely artificial).   So yes and no. But mostly no. A season and a half of a good show is similar to another good show, but thematically they're not that similar at all."

You'll get mad at the writing in season 3 because its derivative of itself. Also there are no ""rules"" in the mythology. Onc you keep that in mind, heroes is actually better.

lost,368g30,cmae34lars,1 point,Sun May 17 12:57:11 2015 UTC,"Season 1 of Heroes has a few dull spots and cliches, but overall it's very good.  Season 2 of Heroes is kind of boring. Its plot is basically a repeat of Season 1 but with some additional holes due to the writer's strike.  Season 3 is split up into two storylines (Volume 3 and Volume 4). Volumer 3 is terrible. So many plotholes, character inconsistencies, retcons... it's a lesson in how not to write a show. (Plus it once again repeats the basic plot of Seasons 1 and 2.) On the bright side, Volume 3 is very watchable as an unintentional comedy. Volume 4 is still pretty terrible too (for most of the same reasons), but it isn't quite as bad as Volume 3.  Season 4 is actually fairly good again. It's almost as enjoyable as Season 1. Things are still rough around the edges, but if you've stuck through Seasons 2 and 3 up to this point, Season 4 seems kind of amazing by comparison.  There are some similarities in the way that all of the Heroes are unknowingly connected to one another just like the survivors on LOST, but that's the only particular similarity I'd draw between the two."

lost,364wml,Tuberomix,1 point,Sun May 17 02:02:11 2015 UTC,"There was a very common one that Matthew Abaddon (if you forget, he's that guy who worked for Widmore, played by Lance Reddick) was Walt from the future. You can kind of see it with his interest in Locke, and the way he interacted with him was slightly reminiscent of Walt. There were various theories as to why he was working with Widmore, maybe he was trying to sabotage him or gather intel, or maybe Widmore had a greater purpose we just didn't realize, or maybe he just became a villain. People were really enthusiastic about it, some were basically accepting it as truth, and many people were seriously disappointed or even pissed off when it didn't come true.  I've even seen a few comments citing that specifically about why they didn't like Lost's ending, which I think is pretty telling about just how hard it was for this show to win some people. Some fans would get mad when their theories didn't come true and decide that somehow made the show lazy and boring, some would get mad when their theories did come true and decided that somehow made the show predictable and boring. Over-analyzing stories is a lot of fun, but people have to learn to not take it too seriously."

Jack went down to the Source emotionally calm, with selfless intentions.  MiB was probably terrified and enraged when Jacob tossed him down there.    Also, the intention of the protector probably had something to do with it as well.  Jacob probably knew and intended the consequences to MiB.  Jack intended to go down there to save the Island.

He was wearing the same suit from that day, as charlie with the same haircut. Perhaps the whole ""move on"" thing was to get back.

Or he had some the same Hurley-type ability.   I choose to think the island did not intend any of this to happen. When the real mom revealed the truth to MIB, he killed ""Mother"" and Jacob made him the smoke. This is ultimately not ideal for the island.

Obviously this is extremely speculative and there isn't true evidence, just interesting correlations between Walt, and the theme of people pretending to be someone else to infiltrate a group in order to spy.  So when we first see Abaddon, he's visiting Hurley at Santa Rosa. He claims to be an attorney for Oceanic, we later discover he's working for Widmore. He offers Hurley a transfer to an upgraded facility. There are a bunch of reasons Widmore could have wanted this to happen, maybe surveillance was easier there. But it's interesting to note that Walt too spent an amount of time there at Santa Rosa, and he and Hurley were two of the closest people on the show, especially knowing how it all plays out. Walt as Abaddon doing this mission in the past could have discovered his friend Hurley was spending this time in a place he wasn't too fond of either and wanted to make his time a little easier. Once he was put in the hot seat though he had to abort that idea and leave.  Then we see Abaddon interact with Locke and he says some really interesting things:   ORDERLY: Don't give up, Mr. Locke.  LOCKE: Excuse me?  ORDERLY: I'm just saying, don't give up. Anything's possible.  LOCKE:You should read my file. My spine was crushed. There's a 98% chance I'll never get any feeling back in my legs. So I don't know why I'm even trying to--  ORDERLY: As a matter of fact, I did read your file. You survived falling eight stories out of a building. That's a miracle, Mr. Locke.  ABADDON: Let me ask you something. Do you believe in miracles?  LOCKE: No. I don't believe in miracles.  ABADDON: You should. I had one happen to me.  LOCKE: Hey, look. I just want to go back to my room.  ABADDON: You know what you need, Mr. Locke? You need to go on a walkabout.  LOCKE: Wha—what's a walkabout?  ABADDON: It's a journey of self-discovery. You go out into the Australian Outback with nothing more than a knife and your wits.  LOCKE: I can't ""walkabout"" anything. In case you haven't noticed, I'm a cripple.  ABADDON: Is that what you are, Mr. Locke? I went on my walkabout convinced I was one thing, but I came back another. I found out what I was made of, who I was.  LOCKE: And here you are, an orderly.  ABADDON: Oh, I'm a lot more than just an orderly, John.  [Elevator bell dings. Abaddon wheels Locke inside.]  ABADDON: When you're ready, Mr. Locke... you'll listen to what I'm saying. And then when you and me run into each other again... you'll owe me one.   Walt consistently referred to Locke on the island as ""Mr. Locke."" And one of the first things Locke ever said to Walt was ""Do you wanna know a secret? A miracle happened to me."" Abaddon then goes on to say he has had the experience already, which parallels with Walt's experience on the island, discovering that he was special, and that he's much more than what Locke perceives him to be at this time. And finally he closes it out saying ""when we meet again"", not if, obviously insinuating that Abaddon is certain they will meet again in Locke's future (Walt's past).  Then when Abaddon meet Locke in ""Bentham"", Abaddon is guiding Locke off island, just as Locke guided Walt on island. Opposites and mirror imaging are obviously huge themes in the show.  We see that Abaddon is the one who tells Naomi ""These are the people you need to get on that freighter,"" those people obviously being Faraday, Charlotte, Miles, and Lapidus. All of those people became instrumental in aiding the castaways, something of course Walt would want to do, especially if he was told to by Ben and Hurley.  Finally, and I think this is the really cool clincher for the idea, the only people who ever saw Walt after he left the island were Hurley and Locke. Walt went to go visit Hurley at Santa Rosa, and Hurley eventually went to get Walt from Santa Rosa. Locke went out of his way to do nothing more than say hi when he was off island. The only two people we ever see Abaddon talk to directly are Hurley and Locke. In other words, he's returning the favor. And we all know on Lost, ""what goes around, comes around."""

Spying is tricky work, but when one keeps their friends close and enemies closer, they have to keep up appearances. In other words, the benefits of helping Widmore outweighed whatever negative impact it might have, especially when you know the future and how things will generally play out. Helping Widmore gives access to information and assets that wouldn't be there otherwise.  And everyone dies sometime kiddo, sometimes horribly. Lost made a theme of people being killed suddenly, horribly, and seemingly with little reason. ""The island was done with him/her/them."" No one on Lost is immortal, even the most powerful people can be killed. Richard couldn't kill himself for instance, but he knew Jack could do it for him. When your time is up your time is up, and it's just as likely that Walt/Abaddon's final task in his life was to get Locke where he needed to be in order to get the Oceanic 6 on Ajira and back to the island."

There's no real evidence supporting the new-Ben theory, but it makes sense because 1) Hurley only just became the new-Jacob, and Ben only just became the new-Richard, and The End made it seem like those two held their positions for quite a long time... much too long to be giving it up now, and 2) the Others don't have a leader now that Locke is officially dead so the position is open.  There is some evidence supporting the new-Juliet theory though. Ben specifically says to Walt that they want to take him back to the island to help Michael, i.e., a ghost. Solving the ghost problem is most likely something that Hurley would want to have fixed while he was the leader of the island. He wants to help people, so since he's helped all of the living people on the island, why not help the remaining people on the island? And Walt has vaguely-defined supernatural powers and a connection to one of the ghosts, so it makes sense that they might recruit him to help them with that problem."

At that point, Jack is already on the fence leaning towards being the hero. He's obviously the protagonist of the series, but he's only the villain if you believed Locke from all along."
lost,35tnw4,EarthboundCory,2,Fri May 15 05:00:48 2015 UTC,"but he's only the villain if you believed Locke from all along.   which I don't think anyone has any reason to do. We, the viewer, know so much more than the characters. I think Locke was lucky to get his legs back and, mainly, look into the heart of the island so early. Most of the other characters had to wait a long time and go through so many experiences to be able to believe in the island. If I crashed on an island and there was this bald knife throwing dude telling everyone how we were meant to end up there, that ""the island"" brought us there, I'd probably stay as far away as possible from him."
lost,35tnw4,arafast,15,Fri May 15 08:56:43 2015 UTC,"Jack's narrative is certainly put forward in a way to empathize with him.  Just because you choose to empathize with Ben, who wanted to protect the Island for his own selfish reasons says more about you than Jack being a ""villain"".  The fact that you qualify Ben's actions as ""murderous at times"" is indicative of how your bias and antagonism towards the lead character has inhibited your ability to view him with any evenness.  Ben orchestrated the Purge that killed off the D.I. for his own need of power.  He then went on to kill Jacob because his hubris was injured.    Jack on his worst day was better Ben.  Even in the context of the Island being the protagonist.  Can't you see that Jack needed to be tested, he needed to believe in the Island on his own terms in order to protect it?  Locke was so willing to believe, so gullible because of his need to be special, he actually became victim to the MIB and ultimately became the Island's true enemy, along with Ben who unwittingly helped the MIB because of his envy of John.    The fact that Jack questioned and fought it so hard is what made him the right Island protector and to then pass it on to Hurley.  I'm surprised that so many people can't see this.    Just re-visit the theme of Thomas the Apostle.    I'm trying hard to keep a straight face here."

I get that people can like or dislike any character, that's fine. I just think that in Jack's case there's a bit too much hate which only makes sense when you see how people are just misunderstanding him. They forget that Jack doesn't have all the knowledge the viewer has of everything that's going on and is only acting in a way that he finds is the best. I find it surreal to use the word ""villain"", especially when you think of characters like MIB (the smoke monster, not Jacob's original brother), Ben, Mikhail and Keamy."

Maybe they are just used to usual tv characters with only one layer, love them or hate them...   And, I just feel that they are missing the whole point. The point is not to like Jack at the end or when he is dead, it is all about understanding why he wasn't ready and how he finally was able to see and understand.   Totally! If Jack weren't so misguided and messed up up until season 6, his actions and behavior towards the end would have been meaningless. One of the most amazing moments for Jack's character for me is when he finally lets go control and follows Hurley. When Hurley admits to Jack that he has no idea what he's doing, and Jack is just ""I know, it's ok. You'll figure it out"". Seriously, all that sense of peace and trust was so amazing and wouldn't even be noticeable if Jack hadn't been so stubborn and obsessed in the previous seasons. Or just the look on Jack's face when he wakes up back on the island. Such a fucking amazing actor to be able to tell so damn much with such a simple, subtle, look on your face."

I think there is a very vocal group of ""Skaters"" that really resent that Jack was the hero of the show and managed to win Kate's affection in the end.  And another group that resent that so much of the story focused on him as opposed to their favorite character.

He was the leader, everyone questioned his moves, he remained stubborn and then he cracked, he failed, he spiraled and he struggled to redeem himself.   Still, the show was from the survivor's perspective. If Jack was the antagonist of the show that means the protagonist was just anyone who was at odds with Jack? The island and Locke for the first half, I could see that, but then he sides with the island and Locke's views after Locke's death. So who does the protagonist become then? MIB? It's just not how the show was presented to us.   You may not have liked him going against the island for the first half of the show or not approved of his spiral into oxycodone addiction but so what? This dark side of Jack was part of his character, just by saying ""morally sound Jack Shephard goes down a dark path"" means maybe you didn't understand him that well. He was never ""morally sound"" or a complete person before the island. He was too stubborn, too hung up and not the great man that he first appeared to be, despite his redeeming qualities. His struggle through his stubbornness and addictions and long road to redemption was frustrating, I agree. But just because a character is frustrating i don't think that makes him a villain."

She does not want to return, and becomes the hardest person for Jack to convince to come back.  She denies the role of Island protector by becoming a mother.  She leaves the island again and tries to convince the current Protector to abandon the island and let it crumble.

lost,35tnw4,Genericname48,9,Wed May 13 16:39:46 2015 UTC,"you're ignoring that Jack was pressured into every one of those decisions by other people. and when he wasn't, he had plenty of support from people not brave enough to do it themselves.   He wanted to leave, and almost pulled a Michael by getting on the sub. Think about it, who might have died after he left the island? He was the only doctor.   He left so that he could get outside help to come and save everyone. Of course it would never work, but as far as he knew it was the best chance of finding rescue.   He ignored everyone that told him not to contact the freighter which in turn got almost all of the remaining survivors killed. He did all of this just so he could leave the island (only this time he brought four of his good friends, whoopty doo)   Pretty much everyone except Locke and Ben (who were both murderers) wanted Jack to do this. And he did it to save the lives of 30+ of his closest friends.   Then he makes everyone lie about everything that happened on the island and all of the survivors in order to ""protect"" them but the only thing it does is ensure that nobody would ever find them.   Except that it does protect them from Widmore and everyone else who would seek to control the island.   Jack's arc in seasons 4 and 5 is admittedly pretty destructive to those around him. But if he didn't do what he did then everyone in the 70's would have died when the electromagnetic pocket imploded, Aaron would never be reunited with his mother, and the MIB would still be at large.  Everyone wants to be the leader until they have to make the hard choices. Jack was a great leader because he was able to pull the trigger when no one else wanted too."

We knew (or deeply suspected) that the people on the freighter were bad news, so it's obvious to us that not contacting them would be a safer move, but, as you said, all Jack had was two crazy murderers telling not to make the call.

Since MiB in LOST is (often) cast as a kind of ""satanic"" adversary, maybe 2 Corinthians 7:14 applies to him:  ""...[E]ven Satan disguises himself as an angel of light.""  In lore, Lucifer was said to be the most beautiful of the angels, and even after his fall could appear in an attractive, seductive form.  JM Straczynski did something similar in the Babylon 5 episode ""The Fall of Night"" (2x22), when the Vorlon ambassador Kosh steps outside his environmental suit and appears to a cluster of B5 people, who each see him in the form of what they culturally define as an ""angel.""

Imagine having an absolutely horrible life (Arguably the most traumatic life in the show), then coming to the island where you actually understand things for once. Locke understood the Island better than anyone every would or possibly could. That, tied with his need to feel like someone for once, led him to do the things he did. I won't deny it, Locke went a little overboard sometimes. But you can only be amazed at how realistic the show portrayed Locke, let alone the amazing acting on Terry O' Quinn's part."

It is not the same filming location though.  The connection between Jack and The Man in Black is simple. If you go into the Light at The Heart of the Island, then it spits you out at that same place. Just like the donkey wheel spits you out in Tunisia."

lost,35neo0,theverybest27,2,Tue May 12 11:39:38 2015 UTC,"As with many stuff with Lost there is leeway and open to interpretation but I am pretty convinced that after he was thrown into the source he lost his true physical form and could only replicate his past self but his soul ""changed"" but not dead. Not so different than how Claire, Sayid and Ben were ""changed"" throughout the series. Jacob could not kill his brother so we know he didn't die and the Smoke Monster can only takes bodies of the dead so then how does he recreate the man in blacks body? Also regardless it was all Jacob and the Mothers fault anyways."
lost,35neo0,JakeArvizu,2,Tue May 12 11:52:15 2015 UTC,"From the Lost Encyclopedia on the smoke monster:  ""When Jacob threw his brother into the heart of the island, the consequence was the creation of the smoke monster. The Man in Black's spirit became fused with the all-powerful force that lay hidden inside the island's heart, a source of malevolence, evil and darkness. In his purest form of hate and rage, the Man in Black as the smoke monster was a seemingly unstoppable dark force of nature. The smoke monster was a purely instinctual being that simply acted first, with no conscience or remorse.""  From the Lost Encyclopedia in the Man in Black:  ""A heartbeat later, an unearthly howl erupted from the opening ad the smoke monster barreled out with frightening ferocity. Jacob's brother was forever transformed, and all that remained of his former self was his lifeless corpse.""  So it seems like you're both right. It wasn't completely his brother because his soul was fused with evil, but it wouldn't exist without him either."
lost,35neo0,flytimenow,1 point,Tue May 12 13:30:53 2015 UTC,"I'm not that big a fan of Locke compared to many other fans, don't get me wrong, I love him as a character, I just don't gush over him that much. But it's hard to deny he had some just amazing flashbacks, he may be the only character who had multiple amazing flashbacks. Most characters get one that's really good and the rest of them may be okay but you're really just wanting to get back to the Island story, with Locke, I can think of at least three episodes where the flashbacks themselves were a highlight.  I might also say Sawyer. He doesn't have as many amazing flashbacks as Locke, but unlike most of the characters, I think they were able to stop his flashbacks before they ran dry (he has fewer flashback episodes than most other characters of his level), so on average they're of overall quality than most of the other characters. I think almost everyone—including Locke—has at least one really bad or really ret-conny, forced, unnecessary one (by Lost standards), but with Sawyer they never quite really dip to that level.  Not to mention, I think Outlaws may have the distinction being the one normal episode in the series where the flashback was almost undeniably better than the Island story (which wasn't even that bad), especially for a non-introductory episode. It was a suspenseful, emotional, very well-put together story, with the first (and I would argue the best) major character cross-over with Christian in the bar. There aren't many episodes where they can cut to commercial in the middle of a flashback, and when they do, you know it's a good one."
lost,35neo0,339970,3,Tue May 12 10:40:39 2015 UTC,"I think the best scenes in ""Outlaws"" were the Christian crossover and then Sawyer's interaction with Jack in the end.  While the flashback was revelatory and very well done, I don't think that his flashbacks play nearly the same importance as Jack and Locke's in the broader context of the show.  Also, how many FBs did we need to see with Sawyer conning people?    Granted, Jack and Locke had a few weak episodes, but they also had some of the best as well.  I just don't think Sawyer's FBs can be placed in the same category."

Here's what irks me a little more: in the flashback where we see Emily give birth, her mother mentions that the guys she is seeing (which I'm guessing is supposed to be Cooper because she's talking about how they're in love) is twice as old as her. At the time Emily is 15, which would make Cooper 30 if her mom is being literal. So if he's 30 in 1956, that would make him 74 when he pushed Locke out the window and 78 when he dies. Not only is the actor is almost 20 years younger, but he never acts that age, I'd imagine even some of the most fit 74 year olds would would have trouble tackling a grown man and pushing him out the window.  It's not impossible, though, especially, when you consider Emily's mother was probably exaggerating."
lost,35lqcq,339970,4,Mon May 11 16:38:00 2015 UTC,Cooper is also a noted con-man. Maybe drop off 5-6 years max? Still a little weird and I agree with what you are saying. But we have zero reason to believe Emily knew of Cooper's real age.

E.g., the Sri Lanka video, Comic-Con teasers, mobisodes, etc. And for added immersion, you should watch them in the order they were released to the audience:  Season 1  Season 2  Sri Lanka video  Season 3  Missing Pieces Mobisodes  Comic-Con '07 teaser  Season 4  Oceanic Six: A Conspiracy of Lies  Comic-Con '08 teaser  Season 5  Mysteries of the Universe  Comic-Con '09 teasers  Season 6  Epilogue (The New Man in Charge)  Comic-Con '11 video  In other words, watch all of Season 1, then watch all of Season 2, then watch the Sri Lanka video, then watch all of Season 3, then watch the mobisodes and Comic-Con '07 teaser, etc.  The second reddit link I posted (the link to someone's comment) contains links to playlists of all sorts of extra material, including deleted scenes. (The majority of this material can be found on the DVDs if you have them, but this does make it easier to access.) I haven't seen every deleted scene myself, but some of them are definitely worth watching. So it's up to you whether you decide to watch them or not.  I don't know how much you'd be able to do of the ARGs any more, but I've heard that the pre-Season 3 ARG (The Lost Experience) was a lot of fun. I enjoyed the pre-Season 4 ARG (Find 815), but it wasn't a must-experience thing.  The pre-Season 5 ARG (Dharma Initiative Recruiting Project) and pre-Season 6 ARG (Lost University) didn't do a whole lot for me."

I'm not too concerned about deleted scenes/behind-the-scenes material and whatnot - I'm primarily trying to focus on the content of the show itself and all material that expands upon the world in which the show exists.   I've checked into the ARGs and they're definitely not 'playable' anymore, but between the Lostpedia articles, availability of associated media online, and Wayback Machine archives of the websites (the sites themselves just refer back to the ABC site), I think I'll at least be able to get the jist."

lost,35iyvu,HoustonsSolution,3,Sun May 10 21:12:18 2015 UTC,"If the dream came from MIB, this is possible. But if the dream came from Jacob or the island, it seems like the dream was supposed to lead Locke to the plane and put him in a position where Boone would be injured (hence why Locke's legs gave out/the island withheld its healing as soon as they got in range of the plane). Because if Boone hadn't died, Locke wouldn't have beat on the hatch that night, and Desmond most likely would have killed himself, leading to the button not being pressed and the world ending."

lost,35hvxd,CRISPR,1 point,Sun May 10 16:25:31 2015 UTC,"I agree that it makes sense they would, but I figured they abstained as we never see Jin or Michael pen notes (which isn't inherently to say they didn't).

lost,35hvxd,339970,2,Sun May 10 16:32:35 2015 UTC,"The message bottle solely exists for the non-raft going survivors to get a message out, just in case they are unable to re-locate the island.   Well, I'm not sure that's exactly the point, at that point they don't really have any reason to believe they won't re-locate the Island. But besides that, the more likely reason for the bottle would be in case the people on the raft didn't make it there would still be some record out there somewhere, so it would totally make sense either way that the people on the raft would write things too. As for the thing about the pen, I'd think they would just write their messages before they got on the raft, Walt seems to imply that when he asks Sawyer what he wrote.  Romance aside, you can't really deny that Kate and Sawyer had a strong connection in season one, they never got to say goodbye and that was probably nagging on Kate. She was just looking for any last form of communication from him, and the type of message one would write in a bottle like that would probably be a meaningful one."
lost,35hvxd,Bearvillager,2,Sun May 10 21:49:04 2015 UTC,"I mentioned the issue of re-locating the island (not because we knew the island is hard to find because of later seasons) because Michael mentions to Walt that the task of finding the Island again could take time, also several times up until this point, it's mentioned the Flight 815 was severely off-course as well."

Michael was presumed to be touched by Jacob, but once he got to the Island and went Waaaaaaalt crazy, I doubt he was favored as a Candidate.  Kate was a Candidate, but was dropped once she became a mother.  With all these Candidates ""dropping out"" maybe he went back to the list and picked others?"

Same year as Inception, one year after Avatar, etc. I get that they're a TV show and maybe were trying to save their budget for other things, but you'd think they could at least find some other way to do the affect. I'm so glad they were smart enough to never showe Smokey turning into a person directly on-screen, that would have ruined many a dramatic moment.

lost,35e3dl,JellyJaffa,3,Sat May 9 15:47:28 2015 UTC,"One of the things that ""ages"" a movie is how much ""modern"" technology it contains, and how the characters react to it. If you watch a 1986 movie where a hacker takes the hero to his basement, rips a sheet off a table and reveals an old mid-80s computer and proudly tells them all the things it can access and the hero is amazed at the power of this new technology, a person in 2015 will probably chuckle. Or if a rich kid takes a large, brick-sized cell phone with a 2-foot-long antenna out of his backpack and all his friends are jealous. It doesn't work anymore because we all have better things, so it plays as comedy when it's not supposed to.  The thing about Lost is that it's mostly set on an island, with makeshift shelters, and limited technology. Most of the DHARMA stuff they find is ALREADY old in context. So in that sense, Lost probably wouldn't age too bad because, other than flashbacks and forwards, there's not a lot there to cement in one particular time."

As much as it is a cute analogy, I think Lost, every living thing has a portion of that light, and Locke had not yet lost his when he was healed by Jacob."

When Boone was injured in the Beechcraft fall, Locke brings him back and then abandons him there, not telling the truth about what happened to him which influences Jack's treatment of him - possibly causing his death, if it were possible for Jack to stop it. He also attacked Sayid in the beginning, wasting the effort and planning it took to triangulate the radio signal...

At this point, most people would still have hope of getting off the island, and it seems like Jack is the only one interested in doing that. Locke, meanwhile, was always doing his own thing without much thought of other people as long as it benefited him.

It's great because you see subtle things, clues, hints, things you didn't catch the first time around (or maybe second).  Knowing how it ends doesn't spoil it, it makes it maybe more compelling.  You know what happens so you don't have to hang on the edge of your seat, wondering, waiting.  You can keep an open screen on your computer and research while watching, keep some reading materials handy to learn more about some of the things they discuss and learn and see.  The whole thing can become a more interactive experience rather than just passive viewing.  Or maybe it can be more passive viewing.  Sit back, enjoy, really let each scene sink in as opposed to a first viewing where you're so busy anticipating the next moment and trying to solve the next mystery that you maybe missed some of the impact.  I always think that was one of the problems people had when they didn't like it.  They were looking for an answer to mysteries.  But the mysteries weren't the basis of the show.  It was the characters.  Their lives and their journeys.  Repeat viewings can allow you to really focus on that aspect of the show, I think.

The end did not have the same emotional impact as it did the first time around, but the middle parts, everything leading up to it, was something that I had grown more appreciative of.  Taking a philosophy class while rewatching it made it much more fascinating as well. A lot of people claim that John Locke was not similar to the philosopher John Locke, but there were some themes that were obviously related. Blank slate was the ""in your face"" reference. But the idea of how we interact in a state of nature(Hobbes v. Locke) was addressed. His ideas on pursuing your passion without outside interference, for example ""don't tell me what I can't do!"" or when looking for Michael ""who are we to tell anyone what they can or cannot do?"". The references to Hume were really interesting as well. What happened with Charlie's death is an example of compatibilism. The whole time travel thing... that's just scratching the surface."

We just have to let the show rest a bit. It's still only 5 years since the end. But at some point, ABC will probably launch a sequel, prequel or anything that is connected to The Island, because at some point, a large part of the TV community will miss the show.

Let's, for the sake if argument, say it was his plan. Same thing goes for flight 316, and while we're at it, the Black Rock, too.   If it was Jacobs' doing then he seemed to have zero problem with allowing all the other passengers dying in the process. We can also surmise that he's been doing this for the past 2000 years or so. He seemed to have no regard for the collateral damage from these events.   Now I'm not saying I think Jacob was evil, but it's a bit of a grey area for how he achieved his goals.

As a child, takes a keen interest in piano, but is forced into the sciences by his aforementioned mother.  Becomes the youngest doctor to ever graduate Oxford. Still not good enough for mother, she tries to convince him to break things off with his girlfriend, so he can focus.  His father (unbeknownst to Daniel) gives him a grant to study time travel, and he actually figures out how to time travel via consciousness.  Goes on to test his device on himself, permanently damaging his memory, and on his girlfriend, leaving her consciousness forever ""stuck"" as she lies in a bed forever.  Charles Widmore offers Daniel a chance to go to The Island, telling him it will cure him. Daniel accepts the offer after his mother tells him that if he goes, it will make her proud of him. So he does, of course.  Joins the freighter team, and falls in love with Charlotte.    Fast forward as a whole bunch of crazy on-island stuff happens, skipping forward to the point where they start flashing through time   As they skip through time, he watches as Charlotte has more and more dire effects from the time traveling.    More time traveling flashes, all the stuff with Jughead and the trek to the Orchid, time traveling all the while.    Loses a second woman he loves to time travel sickness. First Theresa, now Charlotte  Travels back to when Charlotte was a child, tells her specifically never to come back to the island, because she would die. Daniel becomes convinced that if he can set off the bomb, everyone will evacuate the island, thus none of them will ever need to come there, which will leave Charlotte alive and unharmed.  Goes to the 1950s Others, demands to see Eloise (his mom, who's in charge) and be taken to the bomb. Only to then be shot dead by his own mother.    You would think his tragedy ends there, but this is where the tragedy of Daniel actually begins. After Eloise shoots him dead, she reads his journal. The journal that she would buy for him as a college graduation present, some 40 years in the future. She sees all of his research notes, and all the work he has done. And because of all that work he's done, not only does she not try to change his fate as she raises him, she pushes him harder and harder toward it.   From before Daniel was born, his fate was decided. Both Eloise and Charles kept Daniel on the track to what they both knew would happen to him. They knew what wold happen to him if they didn't change his fate. And yet both of them used him for his whole life, all on their quest to get back to, and to protect, the Almighty Island.

Then, after saving his son who now thought of him as a real father, he admits the truth causing their separation all over again. He wants to die, but he can't. In the end, he dies without anyone really caring about him and now he's stuck on the island as someone unable to move on, having to remember the terrible things he did while living ."

lost,352izi,Tuberomix,3,Tue May 12 11:12:23 2015 UTC,"I'm kind of surprised no one has said Walt, I think comparing just childhoods, he is worse off than Locke. From the few times we see/hear about Locke's childhood, he seems to have a stable home and loving foster parents. Yeah, his foster sister (who I assume is the one who eventually dies,) and some kids at school tease him, but those are pretty normal childhood problems, not great but not on the level of suffering some of the other characters experience.  Walt on the other hand is constantly moving around, never having a real home, with these two parents who don't really seem to pay him much attention. All of a sudden his mom dies and this stranger who is is biological father comes and kidnaps him (he didn't know Brian wanted to get rid of him, from his point of view Michael was taking him away from his actual dad) to take him to live in a strange place with no one he knows. Then all the plane crash stuff happens, which isn't great but doesn't really make him suffer more than any of the other characters. Then he gets forcefully kidnapped and experimented on and finally Michael rescues him and they get off the Island. But Michael tells him how he murdered two people and Walt is afraid to be around him so he goes to live with this other stranger (his grandmother) in this new place. And then Michael leaves and never comes back. Up until the end of the show, Walt never finds out what happens to him, (or to most of the other people from the flight he had gotten to know).  On top of all that, he's going through all this as a kid helpless to do much, and there are all these people lying around him and he has no idea what's going on. Plus he has these powers he doesn't quite seem to understand and eventually ends up in a mental institution.  I'm glad they gave him the ending they did in the epilogue, because before that I think he had one of the most tragic and unfair stories/endings of any character.  That's just talking about childhoods, though, if we're talking about sum-total character who experienced the most suffering, the answer is pretty much undeniably Rousseau."

I've worked professionally with people with special needs, so his handicap didn't bother me or anything like that. Honestly, I think that, at the time, I didn't realize that Locke's disability was the result of an accident. I thought he was born with it (If an accident was mentioned before that, I may have missed it or just forgotten at the time) , so his tirade to the tour guide looked like he was venting anger at an innocent bystander over something that he should have long-since accepted by that point in his life, as heartless as it sounds to say. Once I started to see more flashback episodes, and what Locke went through with his father stealing his kidney, etc etc, I started to consider that the outbursts were more justified.   And then when I start to think about it, I realize that I don't have any right to expect a person to ever accept and get over being physically disabled in a world where the majority of people aren't.

It's as if Michael thinks that if he can just get Walt back, that will justify everything he did.  I believe that it's at this moment that Michael steps on the path to damnation (in the LOST universe, characterized by ""not moving on."")  It's not because he killed an innocent; it's because like the boy in the story, ""he is not interested in forgiveness,"" only in rationalization and justifying his actions (""The dog bit my sister"" / ""I have to get Walt back."")

ETA: We also do see Joint Task Force military on-Island in the early 1950s, which again makes more sense to have them be the ones to build a lot of those structures, not Dharma, given how Pacific nuclear test sites were constructed.

He jumps right into life on the beach with the other survivors; he's even shown sketching an aqueduct to bring water from the caves to the beach (one of the early S1 eps; can't remember which right now.)  He's perfectly justified in keeping Walt away from Locke.  I know a lot of people like the character, and I don't say this to bash Locke, but Locke in Season 1 is ... weird.  When he starts getting really friendly with Walt, I admit my ""mommy radar"" started pinging.  That ep which ended with Locke leaning really close to Walt and saying, ""Do you want to know a secret, Walt?""  O.o  Michael has the same reaction, and even though the answer Walt gives him (""The Island is a place of miracles"") is better than many parents would fear, it's still a weird thing to say to a ten year old.  Then there's the knife-throwing, and that deleted scene ""Finding the Tell"" where Locke and Walt are talking about bluffing in poker.    In general, though, Michael in S1 is helpful, generally kind (he's attacked by Jin and many in his shoes would have retaliated far worse.)  Hurley likes him, which says a lot.  Also, I haven't watched it in awhile, but doesn't Walt get motivated to build the raft because he's upset about Locke getting too close (in Michael's view) to Walt?  Michael, though, gets absolutely unhinged after Walt's kidnapped.  We also don't see a lot of his capture by the Others, and they do some pretty dreadful things to people.  So while it was sad (and annoying at times) to see him degenerate into an obsessed eventual murderer, it's worth it to rewatch S1 Michael and see how far he fell."

(Which could be considered kind of ironic given the ""one side is light, the other dark"" thing.)  Keeping with that, the Man in Black wasn't really all evil. Characters who are pure good or pure evil are generally less realistic and more caricature-ish anyway.  Originally, he was just a guy (whose adoptive mother killed his birth mother) who wanted to leave home. It's pretty classic in that respect. The twist of his murderous, psychopathic, adoptive mother is what changes it. Not only does she not want him to leave, but she kills everyone who he loves who's attempting to help him achieve that goal.  At that point, he's basically a victim in almost every way if you really think about it. His ""adoptive mother"" is actually a woman who kidnapped him and Jacob and killed their mother. She then held them in captivity until the Man in Black finally decided enough was enough. (It doesn't matter how big a cage is - a cage is a cage.)  Up to the point of him killing his kidnapper (who killed his mom, friends, and new family), he wasn't a bad guy. As far as we know, he didn't do anything really terrible up to that point. Even the murder of ""Mother"" is defensible given the actual context. (I wouldn't feel bad for a second if I saw a news story that a man kidnapped a little girl who then escaped after driving a knife through his chest.)  But then, the brother with Stockholm Syndrome decided to do what he was warned not to do, and he throws the Man in Black into the Heart of the Island.  At that point, the dynamic changes again. And leading up to the finale, we didn't really even know if anything terrible would really happen if the Man in Black left the island, and I remember a lot of people thinking Jacob was more of the bad guy around the time. However, it turns out that he can't leave without the plug being pulled in the Heart, and pulling the plug really does seem to be a catastrophic event-causing action.  So, while the Man in Black wasn't really a bad guy up to that point, once Jacob tossed him in and he became the smoke monster, he had to stay there for the greater good. The fact that he was selfish at that point and didn't care who had to die (even if it meant everyone) for him to leave is what made him evil. He also became a manipulative killer in that time, so after being tossed into the Heart of the Island, he basically went from generally good or neutral to bad."
lost,34os0s,Stubborn_Asshat,3,Mon May 4 02:32:27 2015 UTC,"The MIB isn't evil. The MIB is us.  Jacob is trying to find a replacement. The replacement has to be someone that both recognizes the power of the island, but doesn't try to dissect it under a microscope/harness it for their own gain. Most people don't make it past those requirements - most people deny that there is anything greater than themselves (like Jack for 99.99% of the show and MIB for 100% of the show).  In case you haven't noticed, lots of the candidates really want their lives to ""matter"", and they pursue things that make them feel like they're significant - Charlie feels like he matters if he's a rock star. John follows destiny blindly because he wants all his suffering to have been for something. Ben feels like he matters when he's in a position of power. They have to let go of that illusion of control and surrender themselves as tiny (but inherently significant) cogs in an enormous machine that they'll never be able to comprehend.  Jacob hasn't been able to find a replacement because no one has been willing to accept that fact. LOST is a commentary of the folly of egocentrism, IMO.  That is echoed in the relationship between Mother and the MIB. She told him that he was special - more special than Jacob. That made Jacob feel like garbage, and it made MIB think ""Hey, I'm special. I'm not like these people. I'm like those people. I'm the victim here, so I'm going to go do stuff like I was born to do! I'm going to harness and exploit something precious so I can go bask in my importance somewhere else! Fuck everyone else."" That's pretty much the story of humanity.   The joke is on him, though, and on all of us. We're all the same. There are no ""others"". We are all equally significant. We want to feel like we're in control of our destinies, but our only real choice is to do right or do wrong. That's what Jacob wants to prove - that people aren't inherently selfish, and that they can make the choice on their own.  The MIB chose to destroy because he was in pain, and Jacob chose to protect in spite of his own."
lost,34os0s,beepbeep_meow,6,Tue May 5 03:39:16 2015 UTC,"It's not so much that the MIB is directly bad (he is - he's willing to murder indiscriminately to get what he wants, but that has nothing to do with why Jacob doesn't want him to leave the island), the problem with the MIB is a slightly more indirect one.  When the MIB was thrown into the Source, his consciousness was fused to it. So now the MIB's consciousness and the Source essentially exist as a single thing. So therefore, if the MIB was to ever leave the island, he would have to take the Source off the island as well.  But the show established that if the Source ever leaves the island (be it by physically being removed or by merely being extinguished), it will cause all the light/electromagnetism all around the world to be extinguished as well. So for starters, the MIB leaving the island is going to cause massive ecological damage since his exodus from the island would cause electromagnetism all over the world to disappear. Furthermore, since a little bit of electromagnetism exists within every person in the Lost universe, the extinguishing of this electromagnetism could cause worldwide corruption or outright extinction if it reaches to that electromagnetism as well.  And the MIB doesn't care that leaving the island will destroy the world. He's so selfish, and there's no life that matters to him, that he doesn't care if he ends all life by leaving the island; he just wants to leave to prove that he can."
lost,34os0s,Petrichor02,2,Sun May 3 05:38:38 2015 UTC,"How exactly does the show establish that? It is said once by a character who is established as a lier and manipulator and gives us no clue as to how she could have obtained or verified that information. We also see the light go out for a pretty lengthy period of time with no effect on any of the human characters personalities or well being. Some of the characters who are the loudest in saying MiB is pure evil don't appear to believe it either. Widmore says that if MiB turns off the source and leaves the island that all of humanity will simply stop existing, but later he makes a deal with MiB in which he tells him how to turn off the source in exchange for an assurance of his daughter's safety. Wtf lol  It is intentionally ambiguous but based on the information given by the show, I'm inclined to believe that if Jack hadn't killed MiB and plugged the cork, the island would have simply sank, MiB would have gone off and lived an unceremoniously human life, and humanity would have continued on none the wiser.   Granted, they should have established that because its an awful idea to have this ambiguity and to suggest that our hero's greatest sacrifice was pointless but its hard to ignore what they did."
lost,34os0s,mdz1,6,Sun May 3 20:41:57 2015 UTC,"The light is out for just a number of minutes, and it causes a ton of destruction to the island, so it's safe to say that this destruction would have continued if not remedied.  But it is established by the Lamp Post station that the island's electromagnetism is connected to all of the other pockets of electromagnetism around the world, so the disappearance of electromagnetism on the island causing it to fall apart would probably mean that the disappearance of all the other pockets of electromagnetism around the world would cause similar damage."

If MIB were to have left the island before he was thrown into the light, it would have been fine, right? And so if that's the case I still do feel bad for him, because his brother literally ruined him."

But Jacob didn't realize what throwing the MIB into the Source would do to him. He just wanted to punish the MIB for murdering their mother (as it looked to Jacob like the MIB came and murdered their mother for no reason; he didn't know what the mother had done to cause the MIB to get angry enough to kill her).  Really it's the Mother's fault more so than Jacob's."

Once jacob kills MiB and gets pushed into the light his true form becomes black smoke, a small piece of leaked evil that wants to wreak havoc on the world.

I always wondered if the Island cured Jack of his alcoholism in the first go-around, too.  In the plane he's cadging drinks from Cindy, and right after the crash he takes the bottle of vodka out of his pocket and stares at it for a second.  I thought at first he was contemplating drinking it, but then he puts it back in his pocket.  On-Island the first time, Jack is never shown to crave liquor (he does share a drink with Ana Lucia.)    So I wonder if it's simply a matter of the Island healing who the Island wants to heal, and in this case it healed Jack of his substance abuse problems, both times."

lost,34mjec,stef_bee,1 point,Mon May 4 23:42:34 2015 UTC,"Oh, I know that Jack's single action in the pilot, by itself, doesn't mean alcoholism.  I'm also thinking though of what we see of Jack in his flashbacks throughout the show.  Jack is drinking (for instance) when he stalks Achara in Phuket to the tattoo studio.  I think (but I could be wrong) that he was drinking when he was stalking Sarah and then confronted his father at the AA meeting, accusing him of sleeping with Sarah.  Jack definitely shows alcoholic behavior when he comes back with the Oceanic Six; I agree."
lost,34mjec,Greensledge,2,Tue May 5 00:18:30 2015 UTC,"He drinks, there is no doubt of that.  So do some of the other characters.  He definitely wasn't drinking when he was following Sarah and confronted his father.  I think he was appalled by his father drinking on the job.  I never got the impression that he drank other than in social situations, prior to the crash.  He was flying a kite for fun during the day in Thailand!"
lost,34mjec,stef_bee,1 point,Tue May 5 00:32:23 2015 UTC,"OK, thanks: I mis-remembered it.    You're right: the kite-flying was probably supposed to show us that Jack was not your average wealthier Western sex tourist.  However, when he starts following Achara, he is drinking from a bottle, out of a paper bag, no less.    Your point is good, though: Jack doesn't show signs of heavy-duty problems until he returns with the O-6."
lost,34mjec,Greensledge,2,Tue May 5 14:24:46 2015 UTC,"I don't think he was intentionally there for the sex tbh.  It's not like he is the sort of guy that doesn't get women.  I think he needed to be in a faraway place to deal with his divorce and his dad losing his medical license (which he blames himself for).  Plus he is sort of overly ethical, he wouldn't be into the sex trade there with underage girls and slaves.  That's just not who he is as a person.    Listen, I'm a guy, countless times I have imbibed on a roadie in a bag.  I don't think it's a big deal.  If anything, I think it shows that despite his privileged upbringing, he can lowbrow it too."
lost,34mjec,stef_bee,1 point,Tue May 5 22:48:24 2015 UTC,"I agree; Jack never seems to be primarily motivated by sex, not the way a few other characters in LOST are.  His ego-motivations are different.  That's a good point about Phuket being a ""far-away place.""  It's interesting how Phuket is used in Once Upon a Time, too (mostly [ETA: produced and] written by two ex-LOST writers.)  In OUAT, Phuket is one of the few places in our world where genuine magic still exists.  While many LOST fans hate ""Stranger in a Strange Land,"" I think it shows us that Jack has a genuine encounter there with something supernatural (Achara's ""gift"") which in a sense points to him becoming a leader of the castaways and eventually protector.  I'll concede the point, that Jack doesn't develop serious problems until he returns with the Oceanic Six."
lost,34mjec,Greensledge,1 point,Wed May 6 17:15:43 2015 UTC,"Jack doesn't seem like he is lacking for female attention (the stewardess, Anna Lucia, Kate, the women that watch him play the piano, the patient's daughter and Juliet have all shown sexual attraction towards him), so if sex was a primary motivation, he doesn't need to go all the way to Thailand for it.  I say this from an objective male POV, he's a handsome guy.  As I mentioned before, Jack's morals would never permit for him to exploit the sex trade in Thailand.  I also agree that his ego-motivations are different and motivated by his domineering father.  But Jack is motivated by love too and I think we see that in some of the actions he took in respect of his feelings for Kate.   While many LOST fans hate ""Stranger in a Strange Land,"" I think it shows us that Jack has a genuine encounter there with something supernatural (Achara's ""gift"") which in a sense points to him becoming a leader of the castaways and eventually protector   I think the actress playing Achara is the biggest problem with the episode.  The casting director blew it.  A different actress, I believe could have changed the reception of the episode.  But I agree with your comment about it being magical.  Nice observation."
lost,34mjec,stef_bee,2,Wed May 6 23:11:31 2015 UTC,"Oh, true, the ladies like Jack; he doesn't have to chase them, and he has a kind of fresh-faced lightness which isn't painful to watch (in comparison with Sawyer: don't get me wrong, I like Sawyer as a character but his constant heavy-handed flirting and seduction get tiresome after awhile.)  I agree that Jack is definitely deeply in love with Kate, and vice versa.  See, I didn't know anything about the actress who played Achara: had never heard of her, never seen her before, so she didn't come with any ""baggage"" for me.  (Similarly, I wonder how Charlie's character would have been received, had he been cast with a complete unknown, without any LOTR ""halo"" effect.)

lost,34mjec,Greensledge,2,Thu May 7 13:19:21 2015 UTC,"I haven't been the biggest fan of Sawyer, I fall in the minority.  I thought the writers overdid his persona with too many nicknames and one-liners that at certain times were distracting to me.  And his ""constant heavy-handed flirting and seduction"" routine was certainly part of my dislike of him.  He seemed more like a female fantasy than a genuine character (although my girlfriend says that Sawyer is not her type either).   Then I wondered if that was the point, this was all supposed to be a front hiding who he is.  Because I certainly preferred the new and improved Sawyer when he was with Juliet.  And he seemed to like himself a helluva lot more when he was with Juliet than when he was with Kate.  He displayed a maturity and confidence that he didn't before.  He didn't always have to be the guy needing to shoot off one-liners to get attention, he was able to tap into the raw intelligence and skills he had and use it effectively.     I agree that Jack is definitely deeply in love with Kate, and vice versa.   I agree and I say this because it seemed that despite their problems, whenever the shit was gonna hit the fan and push came to shove, the two of them always were there side by side.   There was no doubt that they would ultimately have each other's backs.   I really didn't know anything about the actress that played Achara, I am just basing it off her terrible performance.  She just seemed crazy to me and had this humorous way of speaking that just made it a hot mess.    Stranger in a Strange Land is still better than a lot of TV out there."
lost,34mjec,lostfan2015,2,Thu May 7 17:06:44 2015 UTC,"It's so refreshing to read a discussion about Jack that isn't all about how much the fans hate him.  Which has gotten to be as old as time.  Jack does have an earnestness to his persona when it comes to the opposite sex.  While he is a complex character, he does have this ""what you see is what you get"" approachability to him.  And I think a confident woman will be drawn to a man that doesn't have to lay it on thick to get her to be interested.    As a female, I also found Sawyer to be ""too much"" at times, the constant sexual innuendo, the tackles, the grab and kiss were all out a corny romance novel to me.  He had the long locks and the unbuttoned shirt too.  All that was missing was the ripping of the bodice.    Sawyer is very handsome, but his brooding, squinting and flaring nostrils were unintentionally humorous.  Like the other person said, there were moments when he was adorable and I loved it when Sawyer let his guard down, BUT only when it seemed less contrived.  The ""Awww.  Sawyer is holding Aaron.  How cute."" thing never won me over.  Sawyer made me like him when he would show the human side of him.  And no scene shows that better than the scene when he tells Jack that he met Christian in Sydney.  I think that is one of the best scenes in the entire series, tbh.  Sawyer had no real like for Jack, but he knew that if he didn't tell Jack what Christian said, Jack could very well die believing that his father hated him.  Sawyer could have let his envy and rivalry over Kate win over and make him keep it a secret, but instead he let his decency and empathy override his selfish urges.  And what came out was beautiful."

Once I was being treated for an impinged nerve in my back, and I was taking 8 to 12 5mg pills daily for weeks.  I was still having lots of pain so the doc took me off the pills for a month to see if I was actually suffering a lot of  ""rebound"" pain from the pills. He wanted to see if my pain levels were any worse with no oxycodone, ie, testing if the pills helping very much at all.  I stopped cold turkey with no tapering.  I had fucking wicked back pain and sciatica,  but no classic withdrawal symptoms.  The doctor said taking oxycodone at the level I was, should not cause any terrible withdrawals after stopping, and he was right. There was that ""rebound"" effect in the first 24 hours after stopping where the pain seemed amplified, but then it subsided to normal shitty pain levels.  Later in treatment before a back operation, they were giving me real-deal, higher doses long acting opiate pain meds.  I did indeed have to go through a lengthy tapering process after my operation was successful.  During the tapering process I sometimes felt mild withdrawal symptoms, seemed very akin to how women I know have described menopause symptoms.

The main differences are that:  1) Whenever there are multiple scenes that occur at the same time, Chronologically Lost shows them all happening at the same time, split-screen style. Lost Chrono, on the other hand, orders the scenes one right after the other though. (So you get a better sense of when exactly the events are happening with Chronologically Lost, but there's no chance of missing any of the dialogue or anything on-screen with Lost Chrono.)  2) Chronologically Lost includes the mobisodes and epilogue with the episodes. Lost Chrono includes ALL the deleted scenes (but I'm not sure it includes the mobisodes or the epilogue). So Chronologically Lost includes all of the canon show, while Lost Chrono just stuffs in everything (except possibly the mobisodes and/or epilogue)."

When Desmond's consciousness is flashing back while he's on the freighter, Chronologically Lost has all of those scenes from the past there rather than in with the actual date order that they belong in.  I get that it's a choice to preserve Desmond's experience as the mark for where it should be placed in the timeline, but this is the only time they made the choice of character over time. It's slightly odd to me. Like, with all of the other flashes through time, the overall timeline is preserved, but for Desmond's flashes, Desmond's timeline is preserved."

There were many theories about crazy stuff happening to him/with him involving DHARMA and Island secrets and that would tie to his backstory in some way (even giving clarifications to Christian). There were also MANY theories of this being sort of like a ""Flashes before your eyes""-flashback.  When the second part of the episode was going on, and we didn't get anything, I started to get furious. ""Why are we seeing all this?"" and then they gave us the biggest twist in the show.

lost,34k4dr,Senescences,8,Fri May 8 10:20:45 2015 UTC,"I guess I am a ""religious man"", but I don't think the light in the church was heaven. It was my interpretation that the light in the church was death (and acceptance of death). Sure, death would then lead to any potential afterlife/lives that may exist in the Lost universe, but it was not directly heaven itself.  I say this because 1) back in Season 2 when the flash-sideways universe was first introduced, the person who visited the flash-sideways (Charlotte Malkin, the daughter of Claire's psychic - not the same person as Charlotte Lewis), described the flash sideways as ""between places""; maybe that means between life and death or maybe it means between life and the afterlife, but this leads to the next point, 2) when Juliet was dying (but still alive) in the beginning of Season 6, she mentioned that she and Sawyer should get coffee sometimes, and they could go Dutch, and then Miles revealed that her last thought that he was able to hear was ""It worked"". All of these things are what flash-sideways Juliet said to flash-sideways Sawyer. When Juliet was still alive, her consciousness was in the flash-sideways, so clearly your consciousness doesn't exist in the flash-sideways any more once you've died, and the way to leave the flash-sideways is to come back to life (a la Charlotte Malkin) or to go into the light (a la Jack and co.). And 3) the light filling the church is the last thing we saw right before Jack closed his eyes and died, seemingly signifying that Jack was seeing the church in his dying moments. He wasn't dead yet, but his consciousness was in the flash-sideways, just as Juliet's had been. It wasn't until the light filled the church that he actually died, which tells us that the light is death first before it's capable of being any afterlife. 4) Everyone being together in the church ""fulfilled"" the ""live together, die alone"" mantra by turning it on its head and allowing the whole group to die together, not move on into the afterlife together. The flash-sideways existed to make its inhabitants learn to let go of life and the regrets that had plagued them in life.  So even if Ben had gone into the church and into the light, there's no guarantee that it would have led him to heaven. Of course, that conversation between Hurley and Ben implied that Ben spent a LONG time still alive on the island making up for what he did, so maybe he did get that 20 seasons worth of redemption, just off-screen."

lost,34k4dr,stef_bee,3,Fri May 1 21:27:09 2015 UTC,"As I mentioned above, I don't think we have to believe the religious / philosophical basis of LOST, but I'd argue that the LOST universe definitely includes the possibility of redemption for anyone who's sorry.

lost,34k4dr,jimminyxmas,6,Sat May 2 01:02:16 2015 UTC,Hurley is just a forgiving guy. Ben knows he has done bad things and regrets it. That's why he stayed outside of the church. That and Happy Endings 101

No longer is he pushing himself forward, going ""What about me?""  ETA: and yes, Hurley is the soul of forgiveness, from the beginning of S1 all the way through to The End."
lost,34k4dr,stef_bee,3,Sat May 2 01:03:19 2015 UTC,"I agree, Ben during his life up till the finale was a terrible human being.  That said, Hurley was and is always about unconditional love, forgiveness, and mercy.  Maybe that makes Hurley a sap, a pushover.  Perhaps another kind of protector would have put Ben on trial, maybe even executed him.  But that's not the protector the Island got at the end of LOST.    Two stories which might make Hugo's actions more understandable.  When Jesus was on the cross, there were two thieves on either side of him.  One cursed Jesus; the other asked for forgiveness.  No doubt this thief was a nasty piece of work, to get himself crucified.  Jesus accepted his forgiveness, and said that ""the good thief,"" as he has come to be known, would be ""with him this day in paradise.""  On that topic, there's a story about St. Francis, how a wolf was terrorizing the town of Gubbio, killing livestock and townspeople.  St. Francis spoke kindly to Brother Wolf as he called him, then discovered that the wolf was injured, and couldn't hunt fast game.    St. Francis proposed to the town that they should feed the wolf, and that the wolf would guard their town. This arrangement worked until the wolf died, shortly after.  I'm not saying anyone has to believe these stories, or the religion from which they arise.  Hugo, though, was shown in-story to be the son of a very devout mother, and this has always been Hugo's approach from the first season of the show to the very last."

You don't see a lot of what Ben does before and you see none of the repent after.  What we see is the island moving away from him and him losing his faith.  Assuming the years he spent with Hurley could have very well been a century, after all that time when it was time to move on, Ben didn't feel it was right.  He was reflecting. After ALL. THOSE.

lost,34fhj7,stef_bee,10,Mon May 4 19:15:57 2015 UTC,"With a few replies already posted, I was totally expecting someone to say Boone. His death was so tragic, the first of the main castaways to die. Looking at his character alone, it was so sad: only trying to help out the group, and specifically his ""mentor"", leaving behind a sister who depended on him (and though she was becoming more independent, their platonic love had grown in the weeks on the island). But the effect it had on everyone else - we get to see an extreme example of Jack's relenting dedication and the strength of his hero complex, we see a glimpse of all of Locke's anger that was hidden under the surface until that point, which would go on to shape his own journey and eventual demise. That was arguably the breaking point (either this or the journey from the Black Rock) between Jack and Locke, where Jack realised ""we're going to have a Locke problem"". Then Jack's absence from Claire's birthing meant so many other character bonds being strengthened, whilst that juxtaposition between the giving and taking of life on the island made the death all the more shattering - and when we see the birth of Aaron again during the flashes, in the back of our minds is a reminder that past Locke is pounding on the door of the hatch, Jack has just finished transfusing his own blood into Boone's arm whilst continuing to treat him, and Michael is preparing for the possibility of amputating a leg. It was such a pivotal moment across so many characters and brought out so much in them that we would see over the coming seasons (i.e. in many cases, the rest of their lives). If I have to choose a death as the most ""well-done"", not just tragic or dramatic, that wins out on so many levels."
lost,34fhj7,AntiIogical,3,Fri May 1 00:24:32 2015 UTC,"Very well said. Boone was especially hard because not only was he the first Lost main character I saw die, but he was the first fictional character I ever saw die."

She said that they had her on a very very loose platform, so when Josh Holloway grabs her arm and struggles to hold on to her, he was really holding her up. When her hand slips, its truly because he couldn't hold on to her any longer. I might cry at my desk.  However, I think the most ""well done"" death was Alex's. The acting was incredible, and as a woman who was once a little girl who loved her daddy Alex's sobs as she begs Ben to save her really hit me in the feels. The first time I saw it I was wondering how Ben was going to get her out of it, but Keamy is actually a bad guy who does what he says he's going to do and executes her. My jaw hit the god damn floor, and the look on Ben's face is priceless. The fact that the last thing Alex hears is Ben disowning her just adds to the tragedy."

I say this because of the impact it had on Jack. It was her death that caused him to fully accept that he can't fix everything and that maybe the Island just wanted to fix itself. This in turn led him on his path to become Protector and save the Island.

lost,34am8c,Porsche924,1 point,Wed Apr 29 21:20:18 2015 UTC,"Oceanic Airlines:       Oceanic Airlines and less frequently Oceanic Airways are names of fictional airlines used in several films, television programs, and comic books; typically works that feature plane crashes and other aviation disasters, with which a real airline would prefer not to be associated.  The most famous use of this brand is in the TV show Lost, where Oceanic Airlines is featured branded with a highly stylized logo depicting an Aboriginal dot painting that resembles a nazar, a bullseye, an island, or an ""O"". The show's fictional storyline begins with the crash of an airline flight called Oceanic Flight 815.  Airlines with this name have also been featured in many other media, starting as early as the 1960s. Before Lost, the most prominent use of Oceanic Airways was in the 1996 film Executive Decision. The film's producers shot extensive footage of two actual Boeing 747s with Oceanic Airways logo and livery (but not the same logo used later on Lost). This stock footage has been reused in several films and television programs, spreading the Oceanic Airlines brand across various otherwise unrelated fictional universes.

So that likely pissed everyone off.  Also, I think it's pretty funny that the writers regretted these characters so much (with their stupid-hot complex, shitty ""We were here all along!"" origin, and the fact that they were just annoying) that they killed them off in the worst way they could think of: paralyzed and buried alive.   It also seems to me that the writers were making fun of these characters in the episode by writing it as ridiculously as possible. Their retconning of the characters' time on the island was blatantly egregious, if I recall at one point Nikki says a line that goes something like: ""Come on, Paula, you're always saying you want to help out more to the group (the main cast)!"" It's also comically lazy how they cut in scenes from the pilot with these two hanging out like they'd been there since day one. And as for the backstory, they literally said ""Fuck it, let's make her a stripper!""  It seems to me that the writers are making fun of themselves with this episode for their decision to throw in these two shitty characters, and they did that pretty well."

When you really think about relationship in the show :    Miles is more important to Sawyer then most Losties that were in the church. Sawyer, Miles and Juliet spent 3 years together (the Island event are only 3 months). Miles and Sawyer should move on together. It's stupid to think that they ceased to be friends when they left the Island after Jack's death.  Why are Sayid and Shannon together in the flash-sideways ? Sayid spent years looking for Nadia. When he escaped the Island he finally married her, then he did everything he could to avenge her death."
lost,34bwob,Shade77,3,Thu Apr 30 15:18:15 2015 UTC,"This is an interesting idea. Everything in that scene is about Jack. His father greets him with a 'Hello kiddo,' Locke tells him how everyone was waiting for him, Kate approaches him dramatically, Christian is even the one who opens the church doors, leading everyone into the next phase of existence.

Helen in Locke's flash sideways with Anthony Cooper) that he couldn't possibly know."

Frank is a little bit of a mystery though. Presumably the people that he knew and loved in life were so disconnected from the Flight 815 gang that he wouldn't have shown up with them.

lost,34c4eu,jbd118,3,Wed Apr 29 23:33:39 2015 UTC,"In post-September 2004, after Jin crashes on the island, Danielle and Jin never really meet. The two only appear in the same scene together once: when Jack takes Jin and a bunch of others out in the Season 3 finale for Danielle to demonstrate what they've been doing with the dynamite. And in this one scene, Danielle never really looks over at Jin or hears his name in this relatively big group of people. She would have no reason to expect that this guy that she knew for all of a day was the same guy, un-aged, 16 years later. She probably doesn't even accurately remember what Jin looked like given how little time she spent with him (plus the Jin she got to know was half-blown up, and present-day Jin didn't have the same injuries, so he did look a little different).  I don't quite agree with your interpretation of the sickness, though I do get why you'd think that. The reason I don't agree is because 1) Danielle refers to the dark territory as ""the place where Montand lost his arm"" rather than ""the place where my team died"". So she seems to believe that the team was still alive after that whole incident. 2) If you translate the full French message that was playing on the radio tower, it reveals that Brennan also made it out of the temple alive at some point before dying. 3) The MIB doesn't reanimate corpses; he just makes his smoke form look like the dead. When an MIB-apparition is attacked, the attacks just go straight through. So the fact that Robert left a body behind when Danielle shot him indicates that it was the real Robert who was alive but had been infected, which manipulated his mind."

lost,34c4eu,Petrichor02,2,Thu Apr 30 02:24:24 2015 UTC,"The sickness is essentially when the MIB manipulates you and bends you to his will. Every person has a little bit of electromagnetism within them, and the MIB is able to manipulate electromagnetism. So whenever someone is weakened in some way (or perhaps just emotionally vulnerable), the MIB is able to influence the electromagnetism inside of that person to make them want to do what he wants them to do. Of course it is just an influence. Sayid and Claire both showed that you can overcome the sicknessif you try."
lost,34c4eu,Fats33,3,Thu Apr 30 04:57:53 2015 UTC,"I agree.  The sickness is taking the light (goodness) out of you, much like losing your soul.  MiB did this to them when they went to help Montand. Robert was going to kill Danielle has he had no goodness in him so she killed him first.  Claire and Sayid recovered because the losties gave them a little goodness back by still believing in them and trying to help them despite their apparent lack of emotion.  There are similarities throughout.  Sayid helped Desmond in the constant and Des told him 'it was enough' in terms of time spent talking to Penny.  Likewise, Des was able to give Sayid 'enough' goodness when talking to him from the well for Sayid to break away from his sickness.  Another similarity is belief in each other.  Jack never felt his dad believed in him, Locke wished Jack had believed him yet when the losties pull together and believed in each other they were able to overcome their flaws and away from the sickness."

As for the Season 6 flash-sideways, I think it's probably safe to say that you are interpreting them as you were meant to at this point.

The Orchid video is in canon. The videogame is not in canon. It's unfair for the audience to go to ancillary sources in order to really understand the show. Even the things like the mobisodes, which are in canon, aren't essential to your understanding of the show. These things are just added bonuses.  LINDELOF: The only true canon is the show itself.    The Lostpedia article mentions some stuff from it that is/might be considered canon.  I agree with everything you said including that serious fans should play it. It's absolutely terrible, but I still ended up buying two copies.

The only other LOST-like shows I might consider recommending are:  Supernatural (lots of deep, involved mythos)  Person of Interest (a good handful of old LOST actors, and a blend of action, mystery, and conspiracy like LOST, with flashbacks being used regularly to develop the characters and the invisible web that ties everyone unknowingly together)  Battlestar Galactica (it feels like another LOST mystery-type show in Season 4, but prior to that it's still big on the important philosophical motives driving the characters, much like the early seasons of LOST especially)  The Booth at the End (another mystery/philosophical conversation show)"

When he finally finds out where she is from the Australian government and is going to reunite with her, his plane crashes on the Island. When he escapes the Island, they marry, and she almost immediately dies in a car accident. In purgatory, he creates a world where he can't be with her because she married his brother instead, and after killing Keamy realizes he has to let her go and depart from the States (before being apprehended by Sawyer).

Shitty attitude.  Not to mention that Michelle Rodriguez is a very shitty actress.  EDIT: Here's an interesting read for you as to why everyone else hates her (so you know it isn't just me):  ""When Ana Lucia Cortez became a main character in Season 2, producers found many fans disliked the character. Her ""tough girl"" attitude turned many people off, along with her accidental killing of Shannon. The producers claimed that her character would ""arc"", which she did right before she was killed off in ""Two for the Road"".[1] Long before the episode even aired, though, an insider claimed that the producers were fed up with Rodriguez's behavior, both on and off set and that she would be killed off, like Maggie Grace, who was also rumored to be difficult to work with.[2][3]Lost producers denied rumors that she was killed off because of Ana Lucia's unpopularity or that Michelle Rodriguez was frustrating to work with. The main rumor seemed to be that Ana Lucia (as well as Libby) were killed off because the actors who played them, Rodriguez and Cynthia Watros, were arrested for drunk driving in December 2005.[4][2] Rodriguez pleaded not guilty, and was sentenced to five days in jail. Michelle only served sixty-five hours of her jail sentence, before being let out due to jail over-crowding.[5] Producers denied that Ana Lucia would be killed off because Rodriguez had a DUI and jail time even before she was killed off; they claim that Ana's death was planned when Rodriguez was cast, because Rodriguez had a ""nomadic spirit"" and didn't want to be on the show for more than a year."""

He got so consistently screwed over. He gave up on his dream of being an artist to try and support his son but even then had trouble finding work in construction during the winter - his son that he wanted more than anything was taken away from him, his girlfriend (they may have been on a ""break"" at this point, I don't remember) found someone else in a faraway country that she wants to raise Walt with instead, he was nearly killed in a car accident seconds after finding out that he was about to lose his son, he had his medical costs leveraged against him, his letters and drawings that he sent were actively hidden from his son, and to top it all off the second that things got bad Walt was just dumped on him despite not being allowed to see him for years.  It's such a shame that Walt kinda had to get written out due to growth concerns. I'm sure that if they were able to keep him longer Michael's storyline would have been much better fleshed out and less rushed.

There's a deleted scene where Faraday explains it more, but he basically says that small changes can be made without changing the general course of time, but large changes would be able to change the general course. It's unclear as to whether those large changes can really be made in the Lost universe though.  Faraday and Desmond talked before that point back before Desmond got to the island while Faraday was at Oxford. It happened during one of the times that Desmond's consciousness was doing the Slaughterhouse-5-ish flashes through time. At the time, Desmond's past self was going into the future - that's why he was so confused about what was going on in present-time. (At another point, his present/future self was flashing back to his past self. That's when he tries to change things and Eloise stops him.)  I think Desmond's special because of the type of time travel he's subjected to throughout his life. He's not traveling through time physically, but his consciousness is. So, somehow, his time traveling alters his brain so that he can do things in the past or future as his self in that time instead of physically going and changing things in the past or future as another physical version of himself.  I hope this makes sense. I'm tired and trying to rationalize all of this, and it's weird."

Jin-soo is Jin's full first name, and ""shi"" is generally added at the end of first names when you are addressing someone who is not a total stranger with respect. For example in everyday life it is frequently used when addressing customers or coworkers. In this case Sun using it indicates she as a wife formally respects her husband Jin as the ""man of the house"", which is quite traditional. Notice that Jin only added ""shi"" at the end of Sun's name in the beginning when they were dating/didnt know each other very well, but not afterwards.

I think the problem was people who watched the show live, on TV, real time invested so much time and effort into the show, so when the ending came it was a disappointment and stupid. But when you binge watch, because you're watching continuously, I feel you get a better understanding of the ending."
lost,33zupc,celebrategoodtymes,15,Mon Apr 27 05:44:44 2015 UTC,"I am not sure it's so black and white. I watched the show for five years, slowly, as it aired. I spent each week obsessively theorising and sharing stuff on forums, I read deep analyses of every episode as they aired. I was deep in the mythology.  I found the ending to be one of the most satisfying endings ever. While I was incredibly invested in the mythology, I was even moreso invested in the characters. I didn't go in to the finale expecting answers, like so many people did - I still don't quite understand why people expected them, considering nearly everything had been answered in the show already by that point."
lost,33zupc,manwithabadheart,6,Mon Apr 27 11:11:36 2015 UTC,"Agreed.  I, too, was one of those incredibly obsessive fans, and I absolutely loved the ending.

That being said, I loved the sci-fi elements too, but I was more than satisfied with them ending on a more mythic/allegorical note."

I think it has to do more with people's ability to ""get"" it, though that's a vague explanation. Not to say people are stupid or anything, of course, but I bet many people don't give Lost the attention it deserves. If you check your phone ONCE for a message while watching Lost (without pausing, that is), you're watching it wrong IMHO. You might have missed a tiny piece of dialogue that answers, or leads to an answer, of a major mystery, or that reveals something really important about a character. Don't get me started on people that skipped episodes. My point is, how many times have you read ""I didn't like the ending, I thought it was lame that they were dead all along"". In terms of answers, I think they answered at least 95% of the mysteries. The thing is most answers aren't very direct."

lost,33zupc,jor1ss,10,Mon Apr 27 18:59:58 2015 UTC,"I don't think that binge watching gives you a better understanding of the ending because it's really not hard to understand, but I think you're right on the disappointment part. Binge watching removes the week (or several months) after every episode of thinking about and discussing what things mean, where they'll lead, and all of the stuff that went along with the live Lost experience. Instead of thinking about possibilities so much, you're getting the reality fed straight to you nearly continuously. It means that you don't have time to think of things that you wished would be the case, so you didn't get your hopes up about the ending being something that it wasn't.  It goes along with JJ Abrams's ""Mystery Box"" thing and how presenting a mystery in a story is like the box. As long as the mystery remains unsolved, anything could be in the box, but the moment you open it, you know what it is, and the possibilities go away. Watching live meant people thought of a lot of possibly great things inside of each and every box the show presented, but binge watchers don't have that time because the box is opened so much quicker for them.  To illustrate the difference in the experiences:   People who are discovering the show now and binge watching it see signs of the DHARMA Initiative and, depending on how much time they're spending on the show, may be seeing the actual DHARMA Initiative (when they go back in time) within days. Watching live, all we had was a few little tidbits of information, and people made their wildest guesses based on that. To the point where people basically wrote their own stories for what it might be, what they're on the island for, what happened to them, etc.. We didn't get to see the actual group for years.   But that's the tip of the iceberg with this specific situation. Ask most people who've binge watched about the Hanso Foundation. ""The what?"" (At least that's the answer they give in my experience with getting people into the show.) People obsessed over that name live because it's mentioned in the video in the Swan Station in connection with the DHARMA Initiative.  But even with that, it's important to note that not all of us who watched live (and were obsessing over everything and really going down the rabbit hole) disliked the ending. The ones who did dislike it are often very vocal though, so I think it paints a very lopsided picture of reality."

In that case, it would be easier to not realize the relationship between the normal world and the flash-sideways and get confused.  Them, plus the people (including critics/reporters) who only saw the finale without having watched the last few seasons--maybe having given up in seasons one or two or possibly not even started--explain why there's so much misunderstanding in the general public."
lost,33zupc,339970,3,Mon Apr 27 22:54:48 2015 UTC,"I think the real issue is that people forgot that at its core, Lost is a story about the characters, not the mysteries of  the island (even though the island itself is a character).  The island's mysteries drove many of the story lines, but really served primarily to help the characters discover who they were and what their lives meant.  So the ending focused on that: resolving the characters, not the mysteries.  I for one loved the whole mythology of the show, and loved all of the suspense and intrigue, but I was okay with not having every single question answered.  I don't want it to be possible to understand the island fully - I want to continue to be mystified and enchanted by it.  But I do want to know how the character stories all ended up: Did Jack ever learn to let go of logic and embrace faith (Yes, finally)?  How did Locke react when he realized he really wasn't ""special"" (He killed himself in despair)? Did Kate ever let herself love anyone enough to stop running (Yes, Aaron)? Did Hurley ever realize just how important he was and was in fact the opposite of a jinx (Dude, totally).  Did the island find a new protector who would defend it endlessly and with more heart than Jacob? (Dude, totally).  If the only reason you (general you, not you specifically) watched the show was because you wanted to know what the smoke monster was or how the island moved through time, you missed the essence of what the show was about, or that essence wasn't important to you.  And if that's the case, that's totally fair, and it makes sense that you were disappointed with the ending.  But if you watched it because you fell in love with the characters - not in spite of, but because of their flaws -  then the ending gave you exactly what was needed to feel like you were walking away with answers."

That's why people were mad. During the last season, I distinctly remember the phrase 'mind-blowing' thrown around a lot during promos, and there was definitely frequent use of the ""QUESTIONS. WILL. BE. ANSWERED."" shtick. We were promised answers to the mysteries of the island and we didn't get them.   Think of it this way, we were promised a sundae, which at its core is a dish about ice cream. When being promised a sundae, you still expect maybe some whipped cream, sprinkles, chocolate syrup, etc. It's like we went to a place that serves sundae's that constantly advertised how amazing the toppings were, then we got there and they were all out of toppings. Sure we still got the core element of a sundae, but it's not what we were promised."

Elsewhere on Reddit and the Internet though, it can be tough to be a Lost fan. Any time the show is brought up in a thread, it'll be full of people who didn't understand the ending or stopped watching after Season 3 and thought the show went to shit.

Also the problem with a lot if questions people have is they just end up leading to more questions and a lot of the things people wanted explaining really didn't matter at all. I've heard some go as far as ''why did the monster make those mechanical noises'' questions like that are simply ridiculous.   It's interesting that the numbers seem to come up a lot even though that had more explanation than alot of other things did on the show.

(Also Damon is/was a little obsessed with the number 23 and the 23 Enigma. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/23_enigma)  Locke fell 8 stories, so that's why they chose the number 8.  Flight 815 reinforced the ""8"" and gave them 15.  I don't remember if they've said where they got 4 and 16 from, but Locke was paralyzed for 4 years, so that might be where they got 4.

I had thought to make it “42” (an homage to Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy – Answer to the Ultimate Question). When Damon had the same idea, that clinched it.

The 4 is the only one not to follow this pattern.  I always thought that was a big hint into whatever the origin of the numbers was.

Not that Daniel had also been time traveling and also needed a constant. The quote was about a future theoretical situation Daniel might get into, doesn't mean it definitely happens.  People sometimes label Daniel's memory issues before he comes to the island as the same time travel issues others have had. But the show has also been clear that Daniel's memory issues isn't some time travel thing like we see with Desmond, Minkowski, or Daniel's girlfriend. First off, it isn't consistent with that. He's literally just having really bad memory issues, something like Alzheimers or Dementia, while the others are acting like they are in other times. This episode itself shows us that Daniel's experiments give off unsafe radiation and while he has protection for most of his body, he doesn't have any for his head (which was incredibly stupid of him, but whatever) implying thats what leads to his later state. And also why he starts getting better the moment he gets to the island (healing powers) not when he meets Desmond."

lost,341g69,SageOfTheWise,2,Tue Apr 28 01:58:08 2015 UTC,"Ok... hmm... I guess it's a very fine distinction here. I was thinking about this wrong, and you make a good point. Let me get a redo on this explanation now that I've though about it more.  So what we have here is that its Desmond's present day consciousness going back to the past, but the moment it arrives there, it reverts to its past self, for one reason or another. You could say it's a time travel effect of familiarity, or that the two selves merged, and since the past is the only thing they share in common, that's what the remember. The show does not going into this level of detail. But whatever the reason we actually see this happen before in the Flashes Before Your Eyes episode where he goes back and time and forgets that it happened (temporarily at least). The trick is at this point its functionally identical to his past self. So that's whats traveling back and forth through time might as well be referred to as his past self. Talking to Penny undoes this obviously. Whether that means it just restores his lost present self, or maybe it un-merges the two versions, or something completely different, I don't know.  So the past self isn't remembering those events because the particular part of him that experienced it isn't actually part of his past self."

Its creation was the result of efforts made following the Cuban Missile Crisis by the United States and the Soviet Union to find a solution to the hostility and danger of imminent global disaster created by the Cold War. The equation was secretly commissioned through the UN Security Council and is used to predict the time of human extinction.

lost,340dn6,autowikiabot,4,Mon Apr 27 08:48:36 2015 UTC,"In-show, we get a reference to the Valenzetti Equation on the blast-map door, without an explanation of what it is, or that it relates to Hurley's Numbers.  More details on the Valenzetti equation (like in the Lostpedia article cited elsewhere) come from the LOST Experience game.  In-show, the Numbers appear in the world at large, especially to Hurley.  In my view, they're a way for the show to signal to viewers that there are no coincidences; that something out there is actually reaching out to, and manipulating the lives of various people to bring them to the Island.  Thus Sam Toomey and Leonard Simms heard the Numbers being broadcast from the Island radio tower, while stationed at a listening post.  In some unspecified way, the Numbers drove Leonard mad, and he wound up in Santa Rosa, where Hurley head them from Leonard.  But that doesn't explain why the Numbers were chosen for the Hatch serial number, or why a girl's athletic team at the Sydney airport would have the Numbers on their team shirts.  Or why they appear to Hurley in so many instances.  Later, when we see that Hurley becomes Island protector, it becomes clearer in retrospect.  Everyone who's touched by the Numbers in some way is under the Island's influence and subject to the Island's intentions.    A simpler way to say it is that the Numbers are a concrete way for the show to indicate that there are supernatural forces at work in these peoples' lives, ""getting them where they need to be."""

Well, why were they chosen as the serial number on the hatch?   A reason isn't given. Most likely a coincidence. Or at least not something done intentionally by Dharma (Speculation on outside forces withstanding). The serial number I imagine is likely the reason the computer code of the swan was also the numbers though.   Where did Hurley's crazy friend hear them?    His friend worked at a listening station and happened to catch The Dharma Radio tower broadcasting them because of the valenzetti equation.   Why were they written on Rousseau's papers?   Rousseau and her team were on an unrelated expedition when they picked up the numbers transmission I mentioned before and investigated it, leading to their shipwreck on the island and all the bad stuff that followed. So the numbers had a certain fixation for her after that."

What is a potential answer to that question? I feel like you have to be very careful about entering into Midi-Chlorian territory.

I was binge-watching when I first saw it, so didn't have to worry about waiting a whole other week to see what happened to Locke (several more weeks, in fact, we didn't get back to his story for a while) so I could just enjoy it for what it was, which was awesome. I could write a lot about that episode, but instead I'll just copy-paste some of a (slightly drunken) comment I made a few weeks ago:  Nikki and Paulo themselves weren't great characters, and it was incredibly annoying how they were introduced, but that doesn't change the fact that the episode itself is a boatload of fun to watch! Think about it:   First of all, even if you utterly can't stand the sight of Nikki and Paulo, the flashbacks are only half the episode, possibly less. And the non-flashback part of the episode, is everyone's favorite characters (Hurley, Desmond, Sawyer, Charlie, Sun, Jin) working to solve the mystery of what happened, which is not something we get to see a lot and fun to watch. In my personal opinion, though, the flashbacks are even more fun to watch. Yeah, they're Nikki and Paulo centric, but not only do they form a neat little self-contained mystery story, they're mostly showing old parts of the show with characters we love, including getting to see dead ones again. I just love re-visiting old moments from a new perspective and the writers throwing in little winks and nods at the audience along the way. If you've ever seen the show Avatar: The Last Airbender, it really reminds me of the episode The Ember Island Players (the one where they see a play of themselves); it doesn't move the plot forward very much (both episodes actually do a little, just not as much as others,) but they're a really good and sometimes fun and humorous way to look back at the show so far. Yeah, the idea of the stolen jewels itself is a little corny, but the little self-contained mystery they did, where you're seeing piece-by-piece just how everything got to the way it is was great to watch. That combined with the amazing, awesomely creepy ending made it feel kind of like an episode of The Twilight Zone.   I actually watched this episode for the first time with a big group of people, and we were all laughing and clapping and gasping at this episode way more often than most. And when I'm re-watching the show with other people who are seeing it for the first time, I'm always looking forward to that episode to see their reaction to it all, especially the reveal and the ending. I wouldn't want for every episode to be like that, but it was a great one-time special episode to have and if I could re-write the show I would certainly leave it in =)"

Why shouldn't we get a backstory for at least two of them?

lost,33x9dx,reece1495,51,Sun Apr 26 14:53:03 2015 UTC,"DHARMA originally found the island through a lot of combined research. The army found the island in the '50s by accident when they were testing nuclear bombs on islands in the Pacific. They were going into each island to make sure they were uninhabited before testing their bombs, which led to the whole Jughead fiasco. The army kept some information on this island.  But back in 1867, the Black Rock crashed on the island when Jacob brought it there, and the captain of the ship was Magnus Hanso. His first mate survived the crash (and probably the first MIB attack) and kept a journal about all the weird things he experienced on the island. Somehow this journal ended up off the island and in the hands of pirates before it was eventually recovered by a man named Tovard Hanso, a descendant of Magnus, and a relative of Alvar Hanso.  Alvar Hanso is the guy who funded DHARMA and told them about the island in the first place. Alvar knew about the island's existence through the army research and the Black Rock journal, but he didn't know where the island was. So after relaying all of this information to DHARMA, DHARMA realized that the island must contain a pocket of electromagnetism. So they developed the Lamp Post station in order to detect the world's pockets of electromagnetism, which eventually let them find the island.  Now, some of the DI were candidates to replace Jacob, so maybe you could say he brought those specific people there, or maybe he just chose candidates from those that he knew would end up on the island anyway. Hard to say whether they were part of the plan (especially when the future is all set in stone, and Jacob can apparently see into the future).  The reason the MIB didn't kill them is because 1) more bodies meant more opportunities to tricking someone into killing Jacob for him (which isn't something he could count on the Others to do), and 2) since DHARMA was exploiting the island and digging into it, there was potential that they could destroy the island/deactivate the source, which would also free the MIB. He had more to gain by letting them live."

In The Constant the auctioneer said that The Black Rock was lost at sea after setting sail from Portsmouth in 1845 The ledger was found on Ile Sant Marie in 1852 The Black Rock crashed on the island in 1867   Since the auctioneer said the ship was lost at sea more than 20 years before it actually was lost at sea, means there must be some clarifications.  1) The Black Rock sets sail from Portsmouth to the kingdom of Siam on March 22nd 1845, like the auctioneer says. After this voyage the boat was never noted on official records, since it was  ""lost at sea"". But we know the boat was still going strong, so they must've practiced illegal and non-commercial activities on their voyages.  2) On a voyage the ledger is stolen by pirates because it was found ""among the artifacts of pirates on the Ile Sante-Marie off the coast of Madagascar seven years later."" Meaning 1852. The ship is still going strong, while the world thinks it was lost at sea seven year earlier.  3) 14 years later, in 1866, dynamite is invented and patended the year later. At this time, 1867, The Black Rock picked up Richard Alpert.  Since the ledger was discovered in 1852, means that it never was on The Island.

I found it more plausible that the ledger never was on the island, than every detail the auctioneer says is wrong, that the ship's first mate survived the smoke monster attack on The Black Rock in Ab Aeterno and somehow was able to leave The Island, with the ledger, that ended up in Hanso's family."

Here's what we know:   Sayid mentions a geothermal generator at The Swan.  Kate, Sawyer and Alex ran past a big generator outside Room 23. And there was this generator in ""Happily Ever After"" too.   So those we saw at The Hydra were probably the ones powering that station.  There weren't any electrical poles on the island, but we got some mentions on the blast door map of subterranean conduits, so we know the power exist and is transported underground.   I don't think that such a big station as The Tempest only produced poison gas. Especially since it was two stories high, had this gigantic door (maybe to transport big generators and other big equipment?), so even though Goodwin lied about his burn in ""The Other Woman"", I think he was telling the truth that the station also provided power for the main island, like the Hydra station had equipment to power Hydra island.

Sure, he gets off to a rocky start with Walt, and that he even took Walt in the first place is a bit dubious, as Brian really can't just walk away from Walt by handing him over to Michael; Brian is supposed to be Walt's legal father, as he adopted him.  There's a reason Walt shows up on the side of a milk carton in Hurley's dream.

It also makes more sense from a writers' perspective that way: it brings the show full circle and completes that arc.

Jacob wins by not allowing the MiB off the island. So he makes all of his possible replacements and sets them on the course for the Island.  2) To ensure the island has a protector, he chose them because of my answer for 3.  3) Jacob pointed out that none of them had happy lives, they were all flawed, which is why he chose them, because they were all like him, alone looking for something that they couldn't find.  4) It would've been Jin. Sun was a mother and Kate's name got removed for being a mother.  5) He knew Jack would take it and I suppose he wanted to give everyone the choice of taking the position.  6) Richard had to push on a specific stone to open the entrance. I doubt anyone who stumbled upon it would know of its importance and spend a lot of time trying to smash their way in  7) Once Miles had done his thing to Jacob's ashes he said that up until the moment Ben had stabbed him, Jacob was hoping that he was wrong about Ben."

lost,33s8va,frozenpandaman,3,Sun Apr 26 12:54:10 2015 UTC,"1) How does Jacob win? Jacob brings people to the island to prove MiB wrong, that people are inherently good and not evil...but how does he accomplish this? The MiB ""wins"" by killing Jacob - but a candidate can just replace Jacob so he has to get off the island to win I suppose.   It's not really a traditional game the two are playing. Basically, the default state is that Jacob (or whoever is protecting the island) is ""winning"". As long as the Man in Black is still on the island, Jacob is winning.   2) Why are the candidates a thing? I get they're for Jacob's replacement, but why does he keep ""recruiting"" them without telling them, and what's the point. He isn't dead yet, so why does he need like 500 potential people to replace him/whats the point?   Jacob has a weird psychology as a character. He doesn't want to interfere, but he still constantly does. So, his selection process is basically in line with that in terms of bringing people to the island.  As for why there are so many, he probably doesn't want to directly choose a candidate because maybe he'll be wrong. And, statistically speaking, he was wrong a hell of a lot more than he was right considering all of the candidates who were brought in and failed. Maybe he could've brought one person, told them what was up, and had a replacement, but then he has no assurance of what kind of person he/she will be after that. Jacob's method allows people to have a chance to basically prove themselves without being told what's right or wrong, so their choices are their own (as much as any of our choices are our own).   The point is that he's giving people the chance, and it's up to them to earn it or not.   3) How does he decide who is a candidate/why does he pick them?   He tells the group around the campfire (Hurley, Jack, Kate, and Sawyer) why he brought them. He said they were all looking for something they couldn't find off of the island, and they needed the island as much as it needed them.   4) Did we ever find out which Kwon was the candidate/did it matter?   We never officially found out. The thing about motherhood disqualifying candidacy doesn't really fit with the name on the wall either. When they were brought to the island, Sun was not pregnant. Remember that they were concerned about her dying because the baby was conceived on the island (and Sun was worried it was conceived prior to leaving because she was banging that bald asian guy). When ""KWON"" was listed as a candidate, Sun wasn't a mother.  It didn't ultimately matter though obviously because they died.   5) If someone (Jacob?) crossed out Kate's name for being a Mother, why does he say it doesn't matter and she can still be the protector later. Doesn't that make the whole point of picking a candidate or crossing them out pointless?   As I mentioned earlier, he told them that they were essentially chosen because they needed the island as much as it needed them. He probably figured that Kate no longer needed it, and she was better off and happier being a mother. It doesn't make picking people pointless because that's part of the process. If someone no longer fits the bill, they're no longer a candidate.  Him telling her it's hers if she wanted it was an extension of what he told them around the fire. He told them that he wanted them to have the one thing he never had: a choice. He was giving her a choice. Maybe it's a continuation of his weird psychology as mentioned above, or maybe it's growth/the pressure of time that got him to the point of offering the choice.   6)What does Jacob do all day? Sit in the statue and maybe slip a note to Richard? Makes threads? Couldn't it be possible for someone to waltz into his statue and find him? He said you need to be invited but the MiB/Ben just came in and killed him.   Even if someone stumbled upon the foot he lived in, the way in was through a rock wall that took the Man in Black some effort to move. Most people would probably think it's a weird statue and not assume that there's some way in if they just pushed really hard on all of the rocks.  He probably spent most days moving around certain areas of the island, undetected. He was obviously in and out of the cave along with the statue and probably even the lighthouse. Probably doing what anyone who was mostly settled in on an island does.  He likes long walks through the jungles and working on his tapestry.   7) Why does he stop Richard from killing him in Ab Aeterno, but doesn't stop Ben from killing him? Why can't he tell Ben what's up/make him an advisor like Richard.   The circumstances are different, so that's going to factor into anything. Ben isn't Richard, and Jacob is older. (Richard came to him almost 140 years before Ben killed him.)  Plus, they both had a choice. Richard came at him aggressively, and Jacob fought back. Then, Richard listened to Jacob and was open to discussion. Ben started by talking and then slammed the dagger into his chest. I think Jacob just didn't care to convince Ben not to kill him at that point. He was going to do what he was going to do."
lost,33s8va,Stubborn_Asshat,1 point,Sat Apr 25 07:23:26 2015 UTC,"1) I think you're conflating their ""contest"" with the rules. The rules are entirely separate from the contest. The rules keep the MIB on the island, but allows the MIB to leave if Jacob and all of the candidates die (but the MIB can't kill any of them himself). The ""contest"" is Jacob just trying to prove that people are inherently good, which is something that can only be won by the MIB changing his mind about the nature of humans. Similarly, MIB can only win by changing Jacob's mind about the nature of humans. Ultimately this contest never produces a winner. Both Jacob and MIB remain resolute in their beliefs as to the nature of man.  2) It would have only been 360 (or less) potential replacements, most likely (one for each of the compass bearings). The candidates are a thing because he knows that one day he's going to want to stop being the island's protector, and he knows that the MIB wants to kill him, which means he needs people to take his place if the MIB succeeds.  3) There are two possibilities. Jacob did say that he only brought people to the island who needed it because something in their lives wasn't right, but since it looks like Jacob is able to see into the future to some extent, he may have also chosen candidates simply because he knew who the future candidates were going to be. And since he can't change time, he just goes along with it and chooses the candidates that he knows he is going to choose because of his ability to see into the future.  4) We never did find out which Kwon was the candidate, but it really doesn't matter since Jin and Sun died at the same time. A pretty popular theory suggests that Jin was the candidate because the known living candidates on Flight 316 all traveled to 1977 upon reapproaching the island, and Sun didn't, but this theory does hit a snag given that Kate time traveled as well, and she wasn't a candidate at the time, so the time traveling may have had nothing to do with candidacy.  5) Jacob wanted the candidates to pick themselves. So he crossed out names when he believed that a person would no longer volunteer to take over his position (which would mean he could stop working on that person and focus his subtle efforts in convincing people into accepting the position who could potentially be convinced). But if a former candidate volunteered to take the position, they were allowed to do so. It's unknown whether Kate lost her candidacy-protection from the MIB when Jacob crossed her off the list though.  6) It's possible, but since Jacob can manipulate the island's electromagnetism, which allows him to bend light (and thus create mirages), he could essentially make himself invisible if he wanted to, thus preventing anyone from seeing him.  7) 150 years separates Richard's attempt to kill him and Ben's attempt to kill him, so that's enough time for Jacob to change his mind. On top of that, Richard didn't know the full story, but Ben more or less did when he made his choice (minus a little bit of the MIB's story). Furthermore, Jacob had people to replace him if he died when Ben killed him, but he didn't have anyone in place to replace him if Richard had killed him."
lost,33s8va,Petrichor02,1 point,Sat Apr 25 17:34:04 2015 UTC,"I'd argue on point 4 that Kate at least was an candidate (just crossed off, which we know means nothing), but the theory that Jin was the candidate means that Sun was just never a candidate in the first place, hence not going back."
lost,33s8va,theblackfool,1 point,Wed Apr 29 14:48:20 2015 UTC,"1: This is just my speculation, but I think Jacob kind of gave up on the whole ""proving people good"" thing, and just wanted out of the job.  He couldn't die; couldn't kill himself, so the only way to do it was suicide-by-Ben (or somebody else: who knows who else Jacob tried to manipulate in that way over the years/centuries.)  2: He needs huge numbers of candidates because MiB keeps killing them indirectly (getting them to fight and kill each other; throw themselves off cliffs; die of illnesses or injuries, etc.)  3: He tells the candidates in ""What They Died For"" that he picked broken, unhappy people who were at the end of their ropes, presumably because they'd have nowhere else to go.  That kind of subverts the whole ""free choice"" thing, though.  4: Considering they're both dead, it probably doesn't matter.  5: Because it's Jacob's game and he can make the rules (and change them at will, apparently, too.)  6: Jacob doesn't only weave; he would have to sow the flax, cultivate it, harvest and thresh it, spin it into thread, collect and process the dyes, then dye the thread.  It's a lot of work, but as you say, he has time on his hands.  Plus, he takes occasional jaunts to ""our world,"" so for all we know, he has some kind of elaborate secret life (like, at the Hotel Earle?)  7: Jacob stops Richard because Jacob needs Richard for his new plan, which is to find an intercessor or diplomat, so to speak, between Jacob and the Others.  By the time Ben comes along, I think Jacob is ready to die.  (Some think that what Miles ""hears"" from Jacob, that Jacob was disappointed in Ben, implies that Jacob wanted to live.  I disagree: it's possible for Jacob to be disappointed in Ben yet still be totally weary of life.)"

The only answer I could think of was once Desmond deactivated the island it was no longer hidden for that time period thus allowing the plane to escape.   Imagine explaining that one to the authorities. Flight 316 goes missing that just happened to have the Oceanic 6 on board (that would have been massive news creating conspiracy theories galore) and then some time after 316 going missing it arrives with virtually none of the original passengers, now has other people from 815 on board that weren't part of the original 6 (Kate being the only 1).

I think a much more effective resolution of the Rousseau ""sickness"" arc would have been the revelation that her ""infected"" friends were not her friends at all, but rather the Man in Black impersonating them. Then, if she hadn't been killed off, she could have totally been suspicious of S5 Flocke, recognizing in him the same ""signs of infection"" as her dead friends. The Flocke reveal would then have retroactively explained the Rousseau + Jin flashback in a really cool way.  The problem was that they set up ""the sickness"" as a thing inconsistently in too many other places. The Swan quarantine and injections were never really explained, yet the same(?) injection was later shown to be for helping pregnant women survive the effects of the Incident, so maybe it's all related to that. Instead, the entirely new Claire/Sayid mental sickness is introduced without clearly-defined rules governing what it is or how ""infection"" occurs."

I think what ultimately fixed both Sayid and Claire was that people showed them unconditional love, especially Hugo (in the case of Sayid), and Hugo and Kate in the case of Claire.  This even ties in with what Hugo says to Sayid in the FSW, when he tells Sayid that he's ""not a bad guy.""   That IMO is the point between that little conversation between Sawyer and Hugo about ""bringing Anakin back from the Dark Side.""  Hugo believes that Sayid can be brought back, and both he and Kate believe that about Claire.  We see this when Claire greets Hugo in Locke's camp.  Despite her shabby appearance, she's wearing a big smile, and gets a signature Hurley-hug.  He tells her that she ""looks great:"" that's not just an empty compliment to her appearance (because she actually doesn't look that great.)  Both Kate and Hugo see beyond Claire's craziness, appearance, and behavior, and believe that she's salvageable.  That's the medicine which cures the sickness, in my view."

Since the show never explicitly explained how the Others are able to accomplish what seems like teleportation, but the show did establish that teleportation is possible by creating a wormhole in spacetime via the island's negatively-charged exotic matter, it doesn't feel like much of a stretch for me that the Others accessing and utilizing a more stable pocket of the exotic matter somewhere on the island that's only capable of teleporting people explains how the Others are able to seemingly appear and disappear, not to mention come and go from the island inexplicably fast. And since they would be distorting spacetime whenever they do this, it would make sense for the voices of the dead to leak through into the realm of the living whenever the dimensions are distorted. (Or, alternatively if the Whispers are just vocalized memories that the island's electromagnetism has ""downloaded"" into itself, the electromagnetic disturbance created from the spacetime distortion could cause the leaks that allow the vocalizations to be heard by those within the island's electromagnetic reach.)  My ""one answer"" is Aaron/Richard Malkin. I was hoping for something much more substantial than Malkin just being a fake psychic, especially since he claimed he was a fake psychic specifically to cover up an actual miracle. It makes less sense to me that he would tell the truth in order to protect a lie than it does that he would lie to protect a lie. Plus it makes ""Raised By Another"" a stronger episode if Malkin really did know that Flight 815 was going to crash in advance."

Similarly, the ship destroying the statue by riding a huge wave is totally possible within the realm of the show,  but the way Richards viewpoint was cut together was very sloppy. A more serious scene with the reveal of the Whispers would have solved this,  as well as a bigger transition into stormy weather and more ship time between being a mile away from the statue and suddenly on top of it and cut to commercial.

But when Locke reappeared on the island, seemingly alive, Richard began to believe that maybe they were right all along about Locke being their next true leader, i.e., the ""reincarnation"" of their last true leader. On top of that, Richard knew that Locke had special healing abilities that were beyond those of most other people who had healing abilities, and that the island boosted Locke's healing abilities.

Before rounded vowels, as in who and whole, it is often realized as /h/. This latter pronunciation is due to a wh-cluster reduction, and is the same sound change that earlier occurred in how in Old English (hence the h spelling) – it happened later in words currently spelt with who- because these previously had a different vowel, and thus did not undergo this change.

There was urgency in Ethan's mission, but not necessarily danger. So I wouldn't call it a suicide mission. It wasn't for a quite a while that Ethan's mission became dangerous, and he sort of got himself into that mess with how he handled the Claire/baby situation.

lost,33dci7,Endileath,2,Wed Apr 22 00:34:31 2015 UTC,"Something tells me they knew everybody who crashed on the island from the plane, how else would they get detailed lists of people's names and background? (Example: in A Tale of Two Cities, Juliette knew about Jack's personal life and ex-wife) Ethan and Goodwin couldn't have just been standing around, trying to pick up on every single survivors name just by eavesdropping conversations, and Hurly had the manifest. Also, clearly they had lists of people that Jacob had called or whatever, and they already knew who these people are.   Given that, it shouldn't be too much of a stretch for them two know about Claire, and the fact that she was pregnant. And the whole thing with her kidnapping was that they had to administer Juliette's injections to keep the baby alive, or to test if said injections work. Wouldn't it be ideal for them to get a surgeon (Ethan) to do that?  In addition, maybe the ""suicide mission"" bit Ben refers to later on only applied to the tailies, or specifically Ana Lucia. Since Goodwin was stealing Juliette from Ben, he sent him to that section of the plane knowing the survivors would likely figure out what's up and possibly kill them.   I don't know if there are holes in what I just typed, sorry if there are. Also I'm only up to season 3 on my second rewatch so I could be missing things"

Let's say they somehow knew who was on the plane before it crashed, (which I don't think they did based on their lack of strategy as it crashed with Ben handing out tasks on the fly) they still wouldn't know who actually survived. Jacob bringing them to the island doesn't guarantee their survival after the crash. That being said, if they don't know there is a surgeon on the plane, it would be smart to send someone with medical training to treat people who might be useful to you. Goodwin was also very resourceful and regardless of Ben's desire for him to be out of the picture, it would be smart to send someone with his skills."

They actually did that again with Latin in Across the Sea.  The actual page for Lost mentions the trope as well, and points out that while fans got a little mad at Eko flashbacks for having them speak English, English is actually the sole official language of Nigeria.

lost,33b2fj,fe-and-wine,7,Tue Apr 21 15:47:34 2015 UTC,"I recently finished it for the first time too. It was such a ride and I was tearing up most of the last episode, especially when everyone had their moments of realization. I can provide an answer of two of those characters though.  The studio offered a part in The End to the actor who played Mr. Eko, but he requested more $ than the studio were willing to pay him for a cameo appearance, so they dropped the idea.  Michael didn't appear because the things he did on the Island caused him to remain there forever.  As to Walt... Check out the epilogue, ""The New Man In Charge"". It may provide some insight as to why Walt isn't in the church."
lost,33b2fj,EraticA,3,Tue Apr 21 02:19:03 2015 UTC,"One thing I was confused about was the whole Michael not being able to leave the island thing. I know he killed Ana Lucia and Libby, but other characters have killed way more people than he did and they still got to pass over. Not that I'm complaining or anything, because I hated Michael more than any other character, but I just thought he would've redeemed himself with what he did on the freighter enough to be able to pass over"
lost,33b2fj,brkon,2,Tue Apr 21 09:16:06 2015 UTC,"The voices in the jungle are those who are stuck there, just as Michael is. That means there are others who also can't move on. I don't know what the exact criteria is, but the other people who have killed, did so because they had to or it was in their best interest. Keamy was a killer and he knew what he was. He moved on and received whatever judgement he deserved in the afterlife. Michael was more of a tortured soul. He knew that killing those 2 could have been avoided and that he was lying to himself about it being necessary to save Walt. Then his guilt causes him to lose the son he was trying to save when he tells Walt the truth about what he did. He cannot forgive himself for killing those two and he is even more crushed that he lost the person that mattered the most.   This is just my theory, but it makes sense to me. Everyone else who killed someone was able to come to terms with what they did. Even, Hurley, the most harmless person was able to recognize that running over that man was the only way to save his friends. He killed but he was able to accept it."

Of course, the real answer is that the sideways world isn't a split timeline created by the bomb going off, it's just a whole separate purgatory world with its own rules where lots of different stuff happened.  Though I remember an interesting theory from before we learned what the FSW really was. We saw a whole lot of different stuff in the FSW that was different from the regular world even before the bomb went off, like how in the real world Jack gets his appendix out by Juliet, but in the FSW Jack got his appendix out when he was seven even though the incident would have happened when he was thirteen and shouldn't have affected things that happened before it. Looking back things like that were just early hits that the FSW wasn't what it seemed, but I remember people explaining how it could make sense for things to be different even from before the bomb, because the fact that the plane didn't crash means that the Losties never went back to 1954 and such and changed things then.

The male audience wish they could be like him, be handsome, have all the non-committal sex with pretty women, tell jokes, kill people and still be forgiven.  Sounds like a pretty good life.  The female audience is attracted to the idea of being pursued and ravished by him.  He is a Harlequin romance character, essentially.  He even has the flowing blond locks!  Meanwhile, Jack, even though just as handsome (more so IMHO), is a son of privilege and more of a boy next door.  Meanwhile, he is very complicated and even though outwardly he projects confidence and power, he is very insecure in many ways.  Maybe his personal problems hit too close to home for the audience and Sawyer is more fantastical and fictional.  Maybe the audience can't relate to Jack's elite and professional background or hold it against him, even?"

He had the least personal strength or reasoning of any cast member except Kate. Kate who really was just a bad person.  I see alot of people didn't like that slut comment and yeah I get it, it's sexist. My issue with it was every time an issue came up, her way to solve it was to have sex."

Some of which got ridiculous and so over-used, I wished Sawyer would STFU.  Am I the only one that thought ""Freckles"" stopped being cute after season 2?  Did he call her Freckles when they had sex?  It was ridiculous at times.  People have names you egotistical, attention-seeking shithead, who are you to call people what you want?  Would you want to work with a guy like that in your office.  You would want to strangle him every single day - annoying AF.    I was never too sympathetic with him.  He chose his path and he hurt many people along the way.  And when he and Charlie conspired to get the guns and even attacked Sun, fanwankers forgave him.  Didn't he also threaten to smack Charlotte around?  No one seems to remember those aspects of him.    But Jack, while self-serving at times (his need to help and fix fed into a personal need for him), he did genuinely care about people and wanted to do the right thing, even at his own expense.     Seriously, the dude stole medicine from people. The part that bugged me the most about this is, that no one ever rioted. He also felt so fucking entitled. WHY? They were everyones stuff. He literally took that shit from other peoples tents or bags or suitcases, called it his, and got pissed when people went in after it.   Pretty much this dude.  And judging by the stuff I read here, people seem to side with Sawyer and not Jack who said the medicine belonged to everyone.  GTFO!  Like anyone IRL, would want to be TEAM Sawyer in that situation.    Kate is hot AF.  But annoying too.  I disagree with your Jack and Kate assessment.  Jack was just more focused on survival and keeping safe.  He didn't have the luxury of sitting around all day and thinking about getting laid.  People always needed his help."

Kate loved Jack and used Sawyer.  She cared about Sawyer, but she was always pining after Jack.   That is what happened.     she sleeps with Sawyer, openly, many times   Many times?  Actually, considering that she lived with Jack and they were engaged, I think she had slept with Jack much more often.  Sawyer and Kate were ""together"" for not even a week.  And I'm not so sure how open they were, considering she wanted to sneak out of his tent like a hit and run."

As for Ana Lucia, she jumped Sawyer for his gun, what red blooded male with not respond how he did.  Looking at your past posts you seem to have a unhealthy obsessional hatred for Sawyer. It's a TV programme for goodness sake."

LOL - Sawyer was all over Kate, whether it was blackmailing a kiss, grabbing and kissing her while breaking rocks, his comments and innuendo and afternoon delight.   You make it sound like Sawyer was a victim here.  Ridiculous.  He was a womanizer, he used sex for deception, to manipulate and make money.  But somehow, he is not to be blamed for banging any woman that would let him?  He told Jack he had STDs at some point.  The guy is the very definition of a slut.  But this goes to my whole point about double standards the audience has when it comes to characters like Sawyer.  He is always forgiven, but Jack and Kate are burned at the stake.  It's hypocritical bullshit."

However, I also think that a single adult of any gender can sleep with whoever they want as many times as they want.   That being said, Kate was no slut."
lost,339bxl,rogueherrie,3,Tue Apr 21 13:11:16 2015 UTC,"Its about character development.  Sawyer starts off as a nasty man, but gradually realises he doesn't have to fight against the world and can actually work together (not die alone).  If you do a couple of rewatches you may notice the subtle clues to this such as his reaction and subsequent attitude change when Hurley hugs him in Tricia tanaka, also Hurley conning him to be good is a key moment.  I want say much more as I assume you've not watched S6.  As for Juliet, she was a headstrong woman but once she found love she realised that meant more than being a successful scientist.  She also wanted to leave the island and Ben had a massive negative effect on her.  Every character has great character development, as I say do a couple of rewatces and focus on the characters more than the story."

They purposely made Sawyer hateful in early series so that they could develop him and make him likeable and most fans of the show did end up really liking him.  All characters had their bad points and it's mainly why they were on the island - to sort their issues and let the island forgive them/help with their problems.  Sawyer is most definitely not someone you should hate. You just sound majorly angry for no good reason.
lost,339bxl,Greensledge,1 point,Thu Apr 23 10:10:22 2015 UTC,"When I started LOST I figured Sawyer would be off on the side lines. However at Season 5 I grew to really connect with Sawyer, Juliet and Jin.   Sawyer has quite a lot of depth if you ask me. They spend a lot of time on his letter to 'sawyer' and his past relationships and his meeting with Christian.     I think the reason Sawyer is the voice of reason by the end of S5 is because he's spent 3+ years with these people under an alter ego and in a relationship.   Juliet was loathsome at first for me but you really need to think about her position. She wanted to get off the Island for years. She had her chance, and she lost it, she stayed for another 3+ years, and moments before she was finally going home she gets into a fluke accident. She was so close to going home a solid 2-3 times and her chance was blown. Props to her for having an unfortunate life.  I agree with you on Kate however, she doesn't really get an elaborated back story nor does anything good until the finale, which was really just thrown in there it seems."

Also, as long as everyone else stays, he has a community of people to be around. He spent a lot of time alone, but being alone and knowing you don't have to be is a lot different from being alone and knowing (or assuming) that you always will be from then on.  Plus, he thought that the island would help all of them in some way or another since it cured him.  A big part of it was basically selfishness.   I think there's a lot in the character's psychology that would make him want to keep the group on the island where he was seen as powerful, and he had experiences that made him believe the island was special enough to protect from the first time he opened his eyes after the crash."

Both Breaking Bad and Game of Thrones are in my top 5 shows list but for starters i can't even remember the pilot for Breaking Bad so it obviously didn't leave a big impression. For Game of Thrones i was very excited for the show to start after all the hype leading up to it but didn't really enjoy it that much. I stopped watching the show after about 3 episodes. It wasn't until after the second season had already aired that i gave it another shot and discovered how great it truly is.  Lost however instantly got me hooked right of the bat.
lost,32xg08,jmxd,5,Fri Apr 17 21:41:54 2015 UTC,I can see an argument for Walking Dead. But breaking bad and GoT? GoT is too convoluted with characters. They do a poor job of establishing who is the lead. BB is often thought of higher because of the over quality. The pilot is just ok.

lost,32scru,339970,15,Thu Apr 16 10:30:18 2015 UTC,"Hahahahaha. They have Hurley listed as killing Nikki and Paulo because of burying them alive and Desmond as killing ""most of flight 815"" due not not pushing the button."
lost,32scru,stef_bee,1 point,Thu Apr 16 11:19:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah, most of the vague ones they didn't actually count in the number of kills, they just noted them. Like with Desmond, they listed the number but didn't have that affect his rank. The Hurley/Nikki/Paulo one is the only one where they actually count it that I think is a little hinky; it I'd say he did kill them but Sawyer had an equal part, why didn't he get any credit?  The Desmond one is actually really interesting to think about. Intuitively it seems like those shouldn't be counted as kills because Desmond didn't actually do anything, he just refrained from doing something and nature ended up killing those people, but he did make an active choice that lead to the button not being pushed whereas he would have otherwise. Like, if it was someone's job to warn trains if the track was covered, and then there was a landslide but they decided not to warn the train, a lot of people would say he killed those passengers.  The other one I find interesting is that they say the Ben was responsible for killing everyone who died in the freighter explosion, I'd certainly put that one on Keamy. I guess the people writing the list were just counting the very last blow that lead to people's death no matter how they got into that situation.  Either way, the number is quite high for everyone. Of the main characters (meaning people who were billed as man stars,) the only people who never killed were Miles, Walt, Shannon, Frank, Dan, Libby, Charlotte, Christian, Chang, Ilana, and Penny (that's only 10 of 35). And that's not even considering minor characters. It's even more staggering when you realize that that's only counting on-screen, confirmed kills. Many of these characters (i.e. Eko, Sayid) probably killed a lot more than that, we just didn't see it."
lost,32scru,DimensionsIntertwine,2,Thu Apr 16 12:29:04 2015 UTC,"There was some discussion on the Fuselage when the show was airing that Walt might have (not deliberately) killed his mother by causing her leukemia.  It made sense at the time, given that Walt seemed to be set up as a kind of ""Wish them into the cornfield"" kind of kid, as in whenever he got irritated, birds smacked into windows and stuff."
lost,32scru,339970,1 point,Thu Apr 16 13:22:43 2015 UTC,Well said on all points. Another one I noticed from the Lostpedia was Nikki. They didn't credit her for helping kill Zuckerman off the island.
lost,32scru,DimensionsIntertwine,1 point,Thu Apr 16 13:41:44 2015 UTC,"Well, I'd say that one makes a little more sense. Many times in the show people work together to get someone in a situation where they can be killed, but it would make sense that whoever physically pulled the trigger (or in this case, poisoned the food) would get the credit or it would become very difficult to count."
lost,32scru,339970,1 point,Thu Apr 16 13:56:37 2015 UTC,"I disagree. If Desmond can be credited for indirectly causing the deaths of the people on Flight 815, Nikki could certainly be credited with the indirect cause of death for Paulo."
lost,32scru,DimensionsIntertwine,1 point,Thu Apr 16 14:18:35 2015 UTC,"Those are two different things, whether or there was a kill to be counted vs. who was responsible for the kill. Nikki and Paulo planned Zukerman's murder together, but Paulo is the one who actually killed him even though Nikki was indirectly responsible. An analogous example would be in the season three finale when Sayid shoots the dynamite and blows up a few Others. Jack and Juliet made the plan to do that, and Rousseau collected and set up the dynamite for that purpose. Although all four of them were certainly responsible for their deaths, Sayid would be the one to actually get the final ""kill credit"" because he's the one to actually pull the trigger. A list crediting everyone who was responsible would be different, far longer and more complicated.  The ambiguity with Desmond's situation, unlike the one you're talking about with Nikki, isn't a question of who should get the credit for the kill, but if someone should get the credit for the kill for allowing the button to not be pushed in time. I'm not sure if you should count that situation as a ""kill"" by a person, but conditionally, if you were going to give ""kill credit"" for that situation, you'd give it to Desmond. Kelvin is kind of responsible for going outside that particular day, and if you're going back, Radzinski is kind of responsible for deciding to start drilling there in the first place, but if you were to assign a person to get ""kill credit"" in that situation it would be Desmond for actually leaving the button unattended, same way as in Zukerman's death even though Nikki is kind of responsible for having him be there, Paulo would get ""kill credit"" for actually poisoning the food."

A lot of what Lost had going for it was the surprise factor. With so many of the island's secrets revealed, would that even be there anymore? Sure, we'd have new characters, but it'd still be the same island. The smoke monster (if there even ends up being a new smoke monster) wouldn't seem as scary or as surprising since we already know it's just a dude roaming about the island, trapped.   I'm not going to sit here and said that I wouldn't lose my shit if they announced a new Lost show, because I would. But I also wouldn't be surprised if it didn't end up being that good."
lost,32scz6,HappyGilOHMYGOD,6,Thu Apr 16 09:30:02 2015 UTC,"I think you make a valid point. If they did a new show which was a prequel to the LOST we all know/love, it might be a bit underwhelming as we already know what ultimately happens and who the smoke monster is etc. I suppose it depends on the writing though. For instance, Better Call Saul (great show) is a prequel. We know where it's going, but it's still great because of the writing. There's also the option for them to pick the show up after the ending as we know it, and see what eventful things Hurley and Ben get up to."
lost,32scz6,stef_bee,5,Thu Apr 16 09:51:23 2015 UTC,"What things that Hurley and Ben get up to, though?  Ben and Hurley aren't alone on the Island (there are survivors from the finale, including Rose and Bernard), and shouldn't be.  While I could watch Hurley play ping-pong with various extras ad infinitum, most viewers wouldn't want that.   However, 3x10 ""Tricia Tanaka is Dead"" tells us what kind of protector Hurley will be.  The signature song is ""Shambhala,"" which is a kind of peaceful, pure land where ""everyone is helpful, everyone is kind.""  It's a kind of paradise (like in James Hilton's story Lost Horizon.)    Look how people complain about the Season 3 ""B arc"" (where Hurley cons Sawyer into being nice.)  Again, the show is telling us exactly what kind of protector Hurley is going to be.  Most viewers will find this as interesting as watching paint dry.  And if you spice it up with a Return of Walt, what that means is Hurley either gets shoved to the sidelines, or Shambhala gets broken, or both.  I for one don't want to see either happen."

For another, TV producers don't make expensive shows based on gentle slice-of-life domestic realism.  To make an action-adventure sequel (especially one based on the Return of Walt) would undercut pretty much the entire series finale.  I could see a prequel based on the Dharma Initiative (or even earlier, with the discovery of the Island during the Cold War.)  Mix in some Soviet spying, MK-Ultra stuff, the Hanso Foundation: that could be pretty cool.  More important, it wouldn't be filmed non-stop in Hawaii (but could branch out to Washington DC, Ann Arbor, maybe even Tunisia.  In other words, Vancouver, Canada.)  It would also have the advantage of introducing a new raft of characters.  But recreating LOST, or trying to make a sequel, I don't think so."

The show tells you exactly what kind of protector Hugo will be, in 3x10 ""Tricia Tanaka is Dead.""    The song ""Shambhala"" isn't there just for background.  Shambhala is a kind of paradise-on-earth, what  Buddhists call a ""pure land.""  The people who live in Shambhala live a very long time; they don't get sick; they don't age.  Shambhala is ruled by an enlightened ruler.  It's protected by guardians, so that unless you can already live there in peace and harmony, you can't get in.  Most people would find day-to-day life in Shambhala to be very boring.  Of course it isn't, but we're talking about sci-fi/action-adventure TV standards here.    Ben says to Hugo at the very end, with regard to Jacob's rules and people leaving the Island, ""Maybe there's a better way.""  I submit that the ""better way"" isn't just letting Desmond go home to Penny and Charlie.  The ""better way"" is made up of all those ""boring"" Season 3 B-arcs that everybody groans about, where Hugo plays ping-pong, or tricks Sawyer into being decent.  Claire taking care of Aaron.  People pulling beach-camp society together; all the behind-the-scenes stuff.  That's Hugo's Shambhala.  Good, decent people living out gentle slice-of-life domestic realism is in my view specifically what the show wanted to tell us when Hugo was made protector.  I for one don't want to see that undercut.  Also, the show already had an action-y, striving hero.  His name was Jack Shephard, and while it was very sad when he died, his death also made a statement about what the Island was now going to be like.    The conflict is over.  The death is over.

Not to mention, the kind of stuff you like with the monster and hatch and Others, don't get me wrong, they're really really cool, as are similar things that come around in later seasons, but they're not worth watching an entire show over. They're well-done and add to the experience, but watching a long series like that it's meant to be enjoyed for the story, not just the universe.

It isn't a survival show. S1 teaches you about all the initial main characters and sets the foundation to understanding the island minimally.    Lost starts off survivalist,  procedes philosophically(epistemologically I found) then toward an action adventure fantasy to a sci fi drama to a philosophical religious conclusion."

lost,32rv3s,elvenkxng,3,Thu Apr 16 05:26:21 2015 UTC,"Suprised to see the season 2 love on here. Not that I dislike the season at all but I thought it was generally considered by most fans to be one of the worst seasons. Refreshing to see something differen't.  Ranking the seasons is a near impossible task for me as they all have pros and cons and I enjoy them all but I will attempt it.  1.S1-I don't think Lost necessarily peaked here but it consistently the greatest season. In my opinion the best season in television history. Even the filler episodes are good. Can watch this season over and over.  2.S5-Initially when it aired this was my least favourite season but on several rewatch's it has changed. I didn't like how the flashback/flashforward structure was changed, the time travelling, the fact we missed 3 years of the survivors lives in one episode pretty much etc. Despite all this every episode of this season is great and is tightly wrapped up in its story arc, setting up the final season along the way. The final scene of S5 is probably the best cliffhanger ever.  3.S4-Perhaps the writers strike shortened season was the best thing to happen to the show as like season 5, 4 is neatly wrapped up and has a flowing arc that progresses every episode leading up to an epic finale. Some great episodes and hardly any filler in this one.  4.S2-The first half of this season is incredibly strong with the opening of the hatch, meeting Desmond and the tallies. After Collision the season goes into a bit of a lul and filler (Fire + Water anyone?) but heats up in the last arc of the season with Henry Gale and Michael returning.  5.S3-I still like this season a lot but the first string of episodes isn't strong at all and while it has some classics it also has a fair chunk of lacklustreness in it. Love learning about the others but it did feel like the show was getting away from the original format. It was also when most of my friends stopped watching so it was less fun to watch on tv too. The last stretch of the season was great.  6.S6-Don't hate this season but it probably has the most cons out of any season and less classic episodes. The flashsideways don't hold up overly great either.  Again I love all the seasons and my order would probably change if I did this tomorrow."

The flashes at the start of the season, especially in This Place Is Death were too convenient for me and then Daniel showing up talking about Variables was awful imo, he completely changed his mind for seemingly no reason at all. It still had some great moments though."

He knows what must happen in order for all the future events in time to occur (the incident, the plane crash, etc). Dan has always been set on ensuring everything happens correctly because that's the way it already happened. He convinces Jack and the others that they can change everything to carry out the necessary steps of they're timeline. It's been a while since I've seen S5, but that's how I interpret it."
lost,32rv3s,coltawnic,3,Thu Apr 16 15:02:35 2015 UTC,"The Dan changing is mind thing is so annoying. Not only does it make no sense, but I feel like it needlessly confused a lot of people. That season everyone was joking about how confusing time-travel was, and honestly it really wasn't people were working themselves in knots trying to make things more complicated than they were, and this just compounded it.  The worst part is, they actually did have an explanation that made in terms of the story, they just cut it out for time. Here's a video with the scene if anyone's interested, they start really talking about the subject about a minute in. If you're somewhere you can't watch a video, basically the gist is that for the most part, you can't change the past. It's like a river: you can throw a stone into it, but it won't change it's course, it will just sink to the bottom and the surface will look totally the same. But, if you manage to throw in something more massive, like a boulder in there instead of a pebble, then and only then will the water begin flowing in a different way for a while before going back on course. So for the most part, people can't affect the past, all of their actions are like little stones being thrown in a river. But if a person decides to do something massive, like setting off a hydrogen bomb, then it can change flow.  That works way better than him randomly changing his mind, plus it not only makes a fun, very science-fiction-y kind of sense but it doesn't mess up the earlier parts of the season; I know The Variable was a jam-packed episode, but you'd think they'd be able to fit that in somehow. I guess the way they justified it was that, based on what we see in the next season, his theory is wrong anyway so they wouldn't need to overly-explain why it was right, but I feel like it's unfair to his character to just have him change his mind like that for seemingly no reason."

Season 3 was an adventure. Season 4 was pure action, where pretty much every episode ended on a cliffhanger. Season 5 was more into sci-fi. Season 6 was spiritual.

""LaFleur"" was probably my favourite episode. Season 3 - I loved this season because we really got to know the majority of the cast and it was the most action-packed. My favourite episode was ""The Brig"" as it was great to see Sawyer get his revenge on the bastard who crippled Locke and made his dad kill his mom and himself. Season 2 - It was a little better than Season 1 because there was more going and it was fun, didn't really care much for Ana Lucia and the gang though. I think ""Everybody Hates Hugo"" is my favourite from this season, but I can't really decide. Season 1 - The first season was great but some episodes were boring and it felt like I was just waiting for the hatch to be opened. ""Walkabout"" was my favourite episode. Season 4 - This season was good but it was too short and it was a letdown compared to Season 3 which was great. It did have the best episode in the series in my opinion ""The Constant"" though. Season 6 - It was good sometimes but definitely not as good as the other seasons. I really liked the episode about Smokey and Jacob's' origin ""Across The Sea"" though."

The entirety of season 4 happens between ""not penny's boat"" and ""we have to go back"" which is just incredible from a storytelling perspective. I struggled between where to place 3 and 5 because both have some slow parts and some really really great moments, plus Suliet is my favorite, but the twist in the season 3 finale is a trump card.

His father wasn't biologically related to him, but his father was definitely a father to him: one could argue, the best father on the show.  Fatherhood here isn't bio-relatedness; it's doing all the things a father is supposed to do.  The really sad part is that Jin is ashamed of his father; ashamed of his lower-class origins.  He never gets a chance to reconcile any of that, either, if I recall correctly.  Further, Jin decides to stay with Sun at the end, rather than live and go back to Ji Yeon.

It seems that what matters is not taking away someone who has a kid depending on them to be there. Kate was a single parent with no family (that she was on speaking terms with and not dying). If she was gone Aaron would have no one, so it would make sense for Jacob to cross her off.  That's not really the case with either Sun or Jin. Sun seems to be away much (possibly most) of the time, doing business and such, leaving Je Yeon with her grandparents. Dangerous business too, doing things that would put her at risk and not telling anyone. Plus she leaves to go to the Island and find Jin knowing who unlikely it was she would ever come back, which says a lot about her attitude as a parent. Je Yeon did not depend on her the same way Aaron depended on Kate. And Jin had never even met her. I don't think Jacob would feel the need to cross either of them off. (It might also be worth noting that of the names we see on the cave/wheel, a whole bunch of them are parents. But of course, since all but six are crossed out by the time we see them, we can't really see when they had been eliminated and if parenthood was a factor.

This happens time and again, when grandparents want visitation or even custody when a grandchild is in dispute.

Later around the campfire, Jacob tells her she could have the job if she wanted, but that's only after she's willingly left Aaron behind with someone safe who is aware she is related to him, which clearly he didn't realize would happen.

(Don't worry, that's not a spoiler, like the other commenter said they don't really get to do that in the actual show, it's just something the writers revealed later; it's probably better just to tell you now so you don't need to worry about it.)  And yeah, you're right, the reason Hurley recognized her was because of being in the mental hospital at the same time. There wasn't anything particularly sinister about it, it was just one of the many flashback character crossovers, maybe they were originally setting up some story about the two of them being able to connect on a deeper level because of their shared experience."

lost,32qphq,Petrichor02,2,Thu Apr 16 03:36:15 2015 UTC,That's a popular fan misconception. The writers had already decided to kill both her and Ana Lucia off before either actress got a DUI. The fact that they got DUIs around the same time as they were killed off actually made the writers consider not killing them off so that the audience wouldn't think they were killing off the actors because of DUIs...
lost,32qphq,339970,1 point,Thu Apr 16 04:19:14 2015 UTC,"Well, according to this interview, they actually hadn't planned on killing her originally. Apparently they were from early on planning to kill Ana Lucia around that time, but when it came time to do it they realized just killing such an unliked character wouldn't have the right emotional impact, so they just took the most likeable character they considered the least important (her story wasn't as dramatic as some of the others so the could have just showed it all in flashbacks) an killed her off well for the drama.  That's kind of an aside because I'm not sure if this plan was made before or after the DUIs which is what you're talking about, but it certainly makes sense."

I they say in the commentary for the first episode of season two (when they were talking in general about how they take random sounds from civilization as their sound affects) that they had Rose say that line just as kind of an inside joke about where it came from. For some reason Lostpedia doesn't have the transcript for that commentary, but the writers talked about how they chose the sound during one of their podcasts:   Carlton Cuse: That sound, we did borrow that, and it was really the genius of Bryan Burke, who oversees our sound mixing, and we were sort of searching for a really cool, unique sound to play with that monster, and he had the idea of using the taxi cab receipt, and we actually sent one of our sound guys out in a cab, to record it out of a real cab in Manhattan.  Damon Lindelof: And yeah, it has to be the New York City cab, which is...  Carlton Cuse: Yeah, and it doesn't - you know - the fact is recording from the New York City cab doesn't have anything to do with the mythology of Smokey, himself.   Unlike with Walt and a couple other subplots, this doesn't seem to be something they intended on being a mystery that they didn't follow up on. I doubt they even considered there being some deeper meaning behind it, they were just looking for some cool affect, same way I doubt J.K. Rowling ever considered explaining why the Avada Kedavra curse made green light. It was just put in there as a property of the universe for artistic reasons, they didn't really think of it as something that needed explaining."

Let's face it, he really hits his peak in early season one and after that pretty much declines until the subplot about his actual death. After The Moth, the rest of his flashbacks (not counting Greatest Hits, which is amazing, but isn't exactly a normal flashback) are possibly the worst of any character in the series. He has that one in the second half of the first season where he meets a girl and steals from her to get drug money, and then he has Fire + Water, my and many other people's least favorite episode in the show. Most of the other subplots he was involved in up to the one about his death, were either tedious and not fun to watch (re-hashing the heroine subplot in season two because apparently that's all they can think to do with him,) or him being randomly and usually unnecessarily put in other subplots just to have something to do (like in the season two finale when Eko drags him into the hatch/button kerfuffle). Most of the major beats of the story between this scene and his death could have been done without him, and most of those wouldn't even have been that much different.  And think of just how cool it would have been if he really had died. Like OP pointed out, this scene is wonderfully emotional enough already, imagine just how amazing and even iconic it would have been if he actually had died. And it really would have set the tone for the rest of the show well; Lost isn't afraid to kill off main characters a lot, and doesn't often do the thing where they act like a character is dead and then ""Oh no, don't worry, not really!"" the way some other shows do. To kill such a beloved character so early on would have been amazingly shocking and kept the audience on their toes even more.  Keep in mind, I'm absolutely not saying Charlie is a bad character or that he added nothing to the show. I'm just speculating about his potential fantastic, emotional death at this point would have added more. If it wasn't for the actual fantastic character death he ended up getting, I might actually say yeah, probably. It is a little harder because of that, but still fun to think about."
lost,32ipvu,339970,11,Tue Apr 14 10:14:25 2015 UTC,"I get where you're coming from and I think they could have gotten away with this being the end for Charlie.  But then we'd be left without that heart wrenching self sacrifice ""Not Penny's Boat"" ending for him.  And that was the one death in the show that left me standing up with my hand over my mouth.    I think it really depends on how attached to Charlie you were.  I really liked watching his struggles, even though they were repetitive, because I think the way it dragged out really reflected addiction well.  It took his love for Aaron and Claire to really commit himself to sobriety and I thought the depth in that love was really moving.  That's my two cents."
lost,32ipvu,MCRAGEQUIT,3,Tue Apr 14 11:51:38 2015 UTC,"You make valid points but he was never going to die there, in fact Charlie was never even supposed to die. Dominic Monaghan was told by the writers his character would not die in the series. He then at some point around season 3 told the writers that they could kill him off if they wanted to. His reasoning interestly enough was that he felt he took Charlie just about as far as he could go. So I wouldn't worry too much since you felt the same about the character as the actor did."

There was also a blind item from a Lost PA after the show ended that saw Lilly and Fox hooking up in his trailer after a production party one night (and both actor's admitted to Matt taking care of Evangeline on several occasions after a night of partying)  I don't know why OP would deny all of that, there's tons of evidence that was spread out over those 6 years. As a fan of Jack and Kate and the actors I saw it all when it came out over the course of the series so I figured something was up. Also when Fox and Lilly were both filming in New Zealand in 2013 she visited his set dressed as Tauriel and never came out of his trailer for the day. This was tweeted by the director of Matt's film,  Emperor. The truth is out there lol"

lost,32ipvu,Bearvillager,3,Tue Apr 21 00:49:05 2015 UTC,"When did he allude to that? It's true that he doesn't like Matthew Fox and it's true that [he says] Evangeline cheated on him, but it doesn't seem at all like that's why he left the show.  For starters, even just watching the show you can tell he wasn't suddenly killed off out of the blue like Eko or other actors who wanted off their show. His death not only made sense for the story at that point as we've been discussing, but there had been a subplot leading up to it for over half a season. And even after that, unlike Eko, he wasn't against appearing on the show several more times including scenes with Lily and Fox. And Monoghan doesn't say anything like that in any interview he was in after his death. Not to mention, none of this really matters, because he and Lily didn't break up until *after his character was killed off. The two of them broke up in 2008, (and then incidentally got back together and were engaged until they broke up again until 2009,) but the character of Charlie was killed-off in 2007, and the subplot about his death with Desmond's visions and such was written in 2006 (source). I'm pretty sure that idea is just a retro-active rumour fans, perhaps subconsciously, began years after the fact after finding out about their relationship problems possibly through those tweets and then mis-remembering things."

Anyway, do you have a source for the second thing you say? I'm not doubting you, the gist sounds totally believable, but some of the details don't seem quite right. I don't see the writers deciding a character was never going to die, much less explicitly confirming it to an actor, especially early in the show before they knew where it would go and how long it would go on. I'm doing a bit of google-ing and I can't seem to find anything like that, and this exchange from this interview: Interviewer: How long have you actually known that Charlie would die? Monaghan: Well, we could go way back to Season 1. I've always said to Damon, ""Look, if I'm gonna leave the show, I'm totally cool with it, as long as I leave on an up-trajectory. kind of suggests that's not the case.  Plus while I know the writers would take suggestions from actors, I don't see them actually waiting for permission from an actor to kill a character off. Though I totally could see him realizing his character was stagnant and brining that up; it's very vaguely hinted at in this interview with: Monaghan: I’ve always tried to appeal to the writers that I thought [Charlie] was an incredibly capable character even though he had all these issues, and he wanted to contribute in the same way that Locke was doing, and the same way that Sawyer was doing. I didn’t want [Charlie] to necessarily be stuck on the beach taking care of the baby but not explicitly."

As for why I personally don't like it, I don't have a lot of time to write it out, but I'll link to a few reviews and blogs where other fans discuss their thoughts in case you're interested.   The TV Critic.org did a review explaining what they found good and bad in the episode. Rated it 38/100 A.V. Club write a review of it last year for their ongoing re-watch. Their small fan poll put it at a C-. From more of a casual fan perspective, this blogger gave it a 0/10.   The individual reviews might not be that helpful in determinging if an episode is relatively better or worse than others because you don't know how harsh or easy critics usually are by looking at just one review, so here are a couple of lists ranking the episodes: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, most of them have little explanations as to why. They were done by individuals or small groups, not by polling fans so while it's not necessarily reflective of fans overall thoughts, it certainly seems that way. There is a lot of variety about where episodes are ranked, even in the bottom five or ten episodes, people seem to be struggling to decide what to put down there with lots of differences in those spots (Tricia Tanaka is Dead at second-to-last place, really IGN?) the only two episodes consistently placed in the bottom five are Fire + Water and Stranger in a Strange Land, which should say something about their quality and fans' overall feeling.  You're certainly not wrong though, some people share your opinion. To randomly pick one, this guy gave the episode an 8/10. It's just that myself and seemingly most other fans don't agree, which is worth noting. In a discussion about what would potentially have been best for a the show overall, it would be nearly impossible for everyone to agree on just about anything."

Personally, I think the episode took Charlie in a completely awful direction that just didn't make much sense for his character. And Locke punching him always struck me as being very un-Locke-like and left a bad taste in my mouth."
lost,32ipvu,darkandfullofhodors,2,Tue Apr 14 17:47:57 2015 UTC,"Interesting. It does seem a lot of people aren't crazy about it. Just seems like there are other episodes that are basically filler where nothing really happens that I would point to before that one. At least here they're trying to do something new with a character and shot it in a way that really drives home the ""what's real, what's not"" motif."

lost,32ipvu,CaptainCoral,1 point,Tue Apr 14 21:42:07 2015 UTC,"Dude, Exposé was awesome! This is kind of getting off-topic of the ranking of Fire + Water, but if I really were to rank all the episodes, that would most likely be in my top third. Nikki and Paulo themselves weren't great characters, and it was incredibly annoying how they were introduced, but that doesn't change the fact that the episode itself is a boatload of fun to watch! Think about it:   First of all, even if you utterly can't stand the sight of Nikki and Paulo, the flashbacks are only half the episode, possibly less. And the non-flashback part of the episode, is everyone's favorite characters (Hurley, Desmond, Sawyer, Charlie, Sun, Jin) working to solve the mystery of what happened, which is not something we get to see a lot and fun to watch. In my personal opinion, though, the flashbacks are even more fun to watch. Yeah, they're Nikki and Paulo centric, but not only do they form a neat little self-contained mystery story, they're mostly showing old parts of the show with characters we love, including getting to see dead ones again. I just love re-visiting old moments from a new perspective and the writers throwing in little winks and nods at the audience along the way. If you've ever seen the show Avatar: The Last Airbender, it really reminds me of the episode The Ember Island Players (the one where they see a play of themselves); it doesn't move the plot forward very much (both episodes actually do a little, just not as much as others,) but they're a really good and sometimes fun and humorous way to look back at the show so far. Yeah, the idea of the stolen jewels itself is a little corny, but the little self-contained mystery they did, where you're seeing piece-by-piece just how everything got to the way it is was great to watch. That combined with the amazing, awesomely creepy ending made it feel kind of like an episode of The Twilight Zone.   I actually watched this episode for the first time with a big group of people, and we were all laughing and clapping and gasping at this episode way more often than most. And when I'm re-watching the show with other people who are seeing it for the first time, I'm always looking forward to that episode to see their reaction to it all, especially the reveal and the ending. I wouldn't want for every episode to be like that, but it was a great one-time special episode to have and if I could re-write the show I would certainly leave it in =)  (And this isn't meant to be confrontational at all either, I'm just very slightly tipsy and enthusiastic about that episode!!)"
lost,32ipvu,339970,3,Tue Apr 14 23:00:13 2015 UTC,"Hahahaha, ok this makes me laugh. Well, I'll admit I superficially just was irritated that they introduced these lame characters in the middle of the show that you'd never seen before, and then obviously - you never see again. To be honest, I thought it was just some annoying filler and never really thought twice about it.... and I don't think I really even watched it more than once. I'm rewatching again from the beginning (I've seen the first couple seasons a few times, but haven't ever made it through a full-rewatch again yet, so this time I'm really committing to gettnig through the entire thing!), so I'll definitely watch that episode again.

It's no coincidence that the character who said in S1, ""I'm in the wild, Doc"" ended up being the one who worked his way back into beach-camp society by being kind to Claire.    If you're really ""in the wild"" (and Sawyer is right about that), then children become the focus of everyone in the ""village.""  Hurley knows exactly what to do to help Sawyer - by having Sawyer help Claire.  ETA: There's a story by CS Lewis called ""Till We Have Faces."" In it, a ""warrior woman"" says to a mother in contempt,""Where are your scars?""  The woman answers, ""Where they are when a woman has borne eight children."" Although Claire only has one, her child is a huge part of her strength."

lost,32ii6p,theverybest27,9,Tue Apr 14 08:03:33 2015 UTC,"I think the main reason people point to that so much even though it wasn't a regular thing is because they hate Kate for some reason they can't quite put their finger on and subconsciously try to find concrete reasons to justify it. Lots of other characters mess up way worse than her and get away with it. If for example, Kate had been the one to major spoilers, OP, fans would have skinned her alive. Yet when the actual character who does those things did them, a few fans were mildly annoyed with him, but most either tried to justify it or just enjoyed it for the cool story of a deeply flawed character that it was. Kate is far from my personal favorite character, but the hate she gets from some fans is just mind-blowing."

lost,32ii6p,Greensledge,1 point,Mon Apr 20 22:43:39 2015 UTC,"Agree 100% that production values created barriers to Jack and Kate as a couple.  Personally, I like the Sailor Moon approach better: have the couple established early on, and then use that in the story (where they work together; fight enemies together; get separated by bad guys and then reunited, etc.)  That could have been done with Jack and Kate.  Personally, I'm not fond of ship-teasing, especially triangles used to ship-tease.  Think of how awful it would have been to treat Boone, Shannon, and Sayid as a triangle.  The creatives didn't do it, and I was glad.  Sayid told Boone to stuff it, then went on to start the relationship with Shannon.  They were attracted to each other; they slept together; they had problems and tried to work them out."
lost,32ii6p,stef_bee,6,Tue Apr 21 19:22:13 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I can only remember it happening once, that time they were going after Michael. The one other time you could kind of say that sort of thing happened was in season three when spoiler. So you can maybe count those two times if you're being really, really generous, but not really.  People took that one time and spun it way out of proportion, remembering it as being a more regular thing than it was. And even with that time I don't see what that situation makes her hate-able--she wanted to help Michael and was much more qualified for that kind of thing than most of the other people on that mission, (hell, Jack let Sawyer go who was still recovering from that infection and couldn't move his arm properly and really did end up slowing them down). But Jack just kind of forbids her from going, not because of what's best for the situation but because of his own selfish reasons, which he really had no right to do either way. Any other similar character in her situation would have done the exact same thing, (and probably would have gotten captured even faster, she did evade the law for years,) it's not revealing of some deep, hate-worthy flaw in her character."

She was too much of a distraction.  This is where Kate is clueless.  You'd think that she would know that the guy is a little confused by her kiss and run.  Maybe she is going for own her own selfish reasons.
lost,32ii6p,Greensledge,1 point,Mon Apr 20 22:46:23 2015 UTC,"Oh, she is, just Jack even more so. If he really wanted what was best for Michael but couldn't handel being around Kate, it would have been better to let her go instead of him. She's a better shot, an actual tracker who had been able to help Locke at previous times, and had been avoiding the law for years so is just generally sneakier and better in those situations. By making her stay behind, Jack wasn't doing what was best for Michael or the situation, he was doing what was best for himself a his own desire to be the one to save people. And then Kate follows them, thinking she may be able to help of they need it, which isn't great, but not some giant, hate-worthy flaw. Pretty much any other character would have done the same thing (Sawyer even ends the episode telling her he would have in that situation, though for his own reason). Of course Kate is somewhat to blame, but it was really Jack's pettiness that started the situation, and that one situation really isn't an excuse for the level of hate she gets.  That, coupled with the fact that this only happened once and people blow it so fat out of proportion, is really telling about how much people (in general, I'm not talking about you) actually care to think about Kate's character."
lost,32ii6p,339970,1 point,Tue Apr 21 07:56:10 2015 UTC,"You do understand that Kate represents high stakes for Jack, right?  That he is emotionally invested in her, that he's falling for her.  He sees this as a dangerous mission and doesn't want her in harm's way regardless.  I like Kate, but you bring up this stuff being a tracker and sneakier.  ""Better in those situations""!?  Are you kidding?  Have you forgotten the time Jack switched the dynamite in the packs?  And it was a good thing too, because Kate actually forgot that she was ""actually"" carrying them.  If it weren't for Jack she would have blown up.  So, can you understand why Jack would NOT want Kate to go?    (Sawyer even ends the episode telling her he would have in that situation, though for his own reason).     Good grief, give me a break.  Sawyer said that to Kate, so he could get in her good graces and hopefully get into her pants while he's at.   I don't think Kate serves the hate she gets at all, but you seem to be pushing this all on Jack and that's bull too.  They both share the responsibility.  Jack wasn't being petty, he's pissed off and rightfully so, if you ask me.  He's sick of Kate's mixed signals and, while he often let it slide because he was into her, this time he wasn't up for it or her."
lost,32ii6p,Greensledge,1 point,Tue Apr 21 15:29:00 2015 UTC,"(Real quick, I'm not trying to be sassy or anything and I hope this comment doesn't come off that way!) Think about it: your one defence is coming up with some random situation when Kate didn't do the right thing once in the heat of the moment? Of course that happened at some point, every character, including Jack, loses their cool and makes mistakes at one point or another. The point is, overall Kate has more experience and has been shown to be adept with the sort of stuff that would come up in that sort of mission in particular and you know it. If Jack actually was incapable of being around her, what would be best for that situation would be to let her go and himself stay behind. Forbidding her from going was what was best for himself.   He sees this as a dangerous mission and doesn't want her in harm's way regardless.   That's kind of opening up a whole different can of worms which I purposely didn't bring up in the other comment, but if you insist: that kind of brings up the fact that he really doesn't have any right to tell her what she can't do. He can care about her, but he's not her dad, they're both adults that can make their own decisions, he doesn't get to make decisions for her and to think she's a bad person/character for not going along with that nonsense is ridiculous and very demeaning. (Not to mention as long as we're talking about putting people in harms way, with him being the only doctor, it really shows how bad of a leader is that he would his own emotional needs over the well-being of several dozen people, but that's really beside the point.)  Not to mention, Kate's motivations in this situation are presumably almost identical to Jack: various people she cares about are going on this potentially dangerous mission, and she thinks it would be better if she were there in case they needed help. You can't use motivations to justify one thing character as being in the right and one as being in the wrong if they're basically doing things for the same reasons.   [Sawyer even ends the episode telling her he would have in that situation, though for his own reason]. Good grief, give me a break. Sawyer said that to Kate, so he could get in her good graces and hopefully get into her pants while he's at.   Um, okay then, let's imagine for argument's sake that Sawyer wasn't being serious (though let's be honest, of course he would have gone in that situation whether or not he had been forbidden). That one specific example really wasn't the point, the point was that in general, it's not some unique flaw in Kate that she would disobey orders from another Lostie. Random example: in the season three finale when Hurley follows Juliet and Sawyer to the beach after being told not to (twice).

It's not his need to be away from Kate that made him petty, it was his need to be the one to save people at the expense of what is actually best for everyone.

lost,32ii6p,339970,2,Tue Apr 21 16:59:45 2015 UTC,"Think about it: your one defence is coming up with some random situation when Kate didn't do the right thing once in the heat of the moment   Ok.  So let's look at  it this way.  In the few adventures they shared together, Kate nearly got herself and the others blown up to bits.  And when Jack said that they should wait to go down the hatch the next day, Locke went anyway.  And Kate decided to follow.  He didn't stop her.  What ended up happening?  Locke had a gun pointed at his head and Kate was tied and locked in a pantry.  So, maybe Jack has a valid reason for not wanting Kate to tag along.  And, maybe, Kate should have respected his request - for once.     That's kind of opening up a whole different can of worms which I purposely didn't bring up in the other comment, but if you insist: that kind of brings up the fact that he really doesn't have any right to tell her what she can't do. He can care about her, but he's not her dad, they're both adults that can make their own decisions, he doesn't get to make decisions for her and to think she's a bad person/character for not going along with that nonsense is ridiculous and very demeaning. (Not to mention as long as we're talking about putting people in harms way, with him being the only doctor, it really shows how bad of a leader is that he would his own emotional needs over the well-being of several dozen people, but that's really beside the point.)   Not to oversimplify this, but this isn't Kate's mission to bust in on.  It's Jack's idea and she's not invited.  End of Story.  Jack didn't bust in on her Claire adventure and if she told him not to go with her, he would have been wrong to bust his way in.    Demeaning or not, most people will want to keep the people they care about out of harm's way.  Didn't Kate drug Jack, so he could get some much needed sleep? Was that demeaning?  Or did she just care about his well-being and personal safety and the safety of others?     (Not to mention as long as we're talking about putting people in harms way, with him being the only doctor, it really shows how bad of a leader is that he would his own emotional needs over the well-being of several dozen people, but that's really beside the point.)   And Kate was putting her emotional needs over the well-being of others.     As I said several times in my comment, I'm not putting this all on Jack, but you're kidding yourself if you think he was really in the right here and doesn't deserve a lot of the blame. It's not his need to be away from Kate that made him petty, it was his need to be the one to save people at the expense of what is actually best for everyone.  make him a badly-written character or anything, far from it, but he did a pretty crappy, narrow-minded, thing in that situation that lead to the thing everyone hates Kate for and no one seems to think about it.   What he did was no worse than what Kate did.     That one specific example really wasn't the point, the point was that in general, it's not some unique flaw in Kate that she would disobey orders from another Lostie. Random example: in the season three finale when Hurley follows Juliet and Sawyer to the beach after being told not to (twice). A similar thing at the beginning of season two when Locke goes into the potentially very dangerous hatch when Jack doesn't want to. Or when Locke randomly decides to stop guarding Mikhial to play computer chess. Or Hurley walking alone into the dangerous jungle to find a dangerous French lady when Sayid says not to. There are certainly more, those were just random off the top of my head.   I agree completely.  I think the audience is full of hypocrisy and double standards.  I don't think Kate deserves the unwarranted hate she gets for doing this.  But at the end of the day, her poor decision and plan backfired and she has to own that.  And Jack knows he's partially to blame.  In his own way, when he asked Kate to come with him in ""SOS"", he was trying to make amends for his role in what happened.  And, even then Kate got them caught in Rousseau's trap.  But that is not the point."

lost,32ii6p,stef_bee,6,Tue Apr 14 15:42:54 2015 UTC,"Claire (other than Rousseau, who she's paralleled with more than once) is probably the strongest female character on LOST.    She survived birth in the bush with no anesthetics.  I've had unmedicated births.  The pain is unbelievable, but she gets through it.  She navigates having a newborn pretty well, given that she's already been kidnapped and drugged for almost two weeks before the birth, as well as threatened with death.  (I think Alex is mistaken, that Ethan is going to kill her, but that's another issue.)  If she has post-partum anxiety, that's normal, especially (as per above) you've been already kidnapped.  She manages to keep the child alive by learning how to breastfeed (it's a learned skill); how to keep him clean and dry with no washing machines or disposable diapers.  Somehow (we're not shown) she manages to secure enough food to produce milk (500-700 extra calories a day for relatively sedentary women; more if they're more physically active, as the Losties are.)    Admittedly, some of it is Island magic.  (A good half of children even in classical Rome died before age 10, and under primitive conditions it's even worse.)  The show sanitized a lot of what Claire would actually have to do and go through to keep Aaron and herself alive.  Fortunately, others on the beach cared enough about Claire and Aaron to help her.  (Kate says ""This baby is all of ours,"" and she's right.)"

Perhaps the reason you liked her more before could just have been that Aaron simply wasn't around yet and now that he has been for a while you're noticing her behaviour change.

I was just saying that if OP is one of those people who is bothered by things like that phrase, that might be what makes them dislike Claire.  To be Claire in that situation would be absolutely crazy. She's not only trapped far from home on an island with an infant she really has no idea what to do with, but she has been kidnapped and stuck with needles and knows confirmed stories of there being moles in their camps and other children being taken and of some crazy disease you need to get vaccinated for—her behaviour makes perfect sense for someone in that situation and all things considered is really quite rational most of the time.

Because Charlie has his own agenda (he wants Claire at the caves with him), he persuades her to go back to the caves, rather than to continue on to the beach.

It was so frustrating during my first run through cause I was usually was watching it late at night before going to sleep before class (I was a rebel in the 10th grade) and it would be 1 in the morning when something like that would happen then I'd be up for another 2 hours trying to see what they alluded too and get like 3 hours of sleep.

I liked the story and how it unfolded, but it could be more. Walk outside the hotel in Sydney. Explore more. The ties to The Lost Experience with The Hanso Foundation and Mittelwerk. The Incident room ...and a little more.   But there's more that isn't that good. People didn't like the voice acting and deliveries of the lines. This scene has been parodied a lot, Locke would never say ""Brand spanking new"".  Many people sound horrible. Even Claire, who is voiced by Emilie de Ravin too.   There's also lost potential. Many people really wanted to explore the entire island. That you could go around the whole place. I know it would be hard to do, since the game came in the middle of the show and that gave many restrictions.   Fuse puzzles. What does that have to do with the show? I could understand them in the new bunker areas under The Flame. That was cool. But they don't exist on the wall in the living area of The Swan. If there were small games in the game, which is a cool idea, it should've been Lost-related. ""Learn to throw knives with Locke"", ""Challenge Hurley to a game of golf to acquire a certain object you need"", ""Backgammon with Locke"", ping pong etc. I liked the psychology tests on the computer though.  Continuity mistakes. If fans of the show had created this game, then things would be in place like the show. Michael building his raft on the second day on the island, the clothes they were don't match, where did the bodies in the cockpit go?"

Nadia shows up in the weirdest places.   I also realized how insanely well-written it is. There is not a lot of wasted dialog.   And the numbers. Are. Everywhere.

I thought it would have been cool if she had actually seen Smokey.  Jin's freak-out over Claire making him touch her pregnant belly could actually be the reopening of a sore wound since we know he and Sun could not conceive off-island. Yes, I know it's unlikely that they thought of that plotline while filming the pilot, and it's more likely just due to Jin's business-like conservatism but in the context of the entire show, I like to think that played a part.  The ""Light and Dark"" backgammon speech takes place between the man whom the Dark Player uses as a pawn (Locke) and the boy that, according to speculation, will eventually become the new Light Player (Walt).  Yeah, I'm looking forward to my entire rewatch."

I think thats the fatal flaw of the side :/   Not to mention the Oceanic Six (and also Ben at various times and Widmore and any Dharma people on the sub, etc, etc) who could leave the Island. I don't know of many mythologies where you can fly out of purgatory on a helicopter. Maybe it could be like in ancient Greek religions where Hades is a literal place you go to when you die and in some rare cases it's possible to just physically walk out of it if you know exactly what you're doing. So in the Lost universe when you (or just some specific people) die you end up on this Island which is a literal place on the world but you can leave if you know the right bearing. At that point though, what's the difference really?"

I always thought this was the really obvious nail in the coffin that would keep this from ever really being a theory in the first place, but clearly thats wrong.

It sounded like they said something about poltergeist but that wouldn't make any sense given the scene but it's Lost. I did not hear it when I watched without headphones. Is kind like the first time you listen to Dark Side of the Moon with headphones. They sneak a lot of background noises in there.   In case you couldn't tell, I smoke a lot of weed."
lost,321f33,Choekaas,2,Tue Apr 14 13:13:00 2015 UTC,"I don't have the ability to check it myself right now, but there's no reason you're mental. The sound people of the show did put small snippets of whispers at odd places in the show it seems. (Like there's a lot of whispers on the audio track during the Sayid and Henry Gale interrogation scene from ""One of Them"").  There were tons of whisper transcripts-guys on the forums back in the day, but they disappeared during the last seasons. I bet there's some faint whispering in ""Sundown"" too."
lost,321f33,Derpatologist_7,1 point,Thu Apr 9 23:03:03 2015 UTC,"Were you a bit disappointed with the explanation of the whispers? All through the series they seemed to be attributed to the others and there was often heavy use of them just before an Other showed up, for example just before Jack, Sawyer, Kate and Hugo were kidnapped but especially the scene when Goodwin's wife appeared out of thin air to talk to Juliet then suddenly vanished. I feel the writers originally had a different idea about the whispers then changed their minds."
lost,321f33,Choekaas,1 point,Sun Apr 12 14:19:45 2015 UTC,"I wasn't disappointed with it being ""those who couldn't move on"", but disappointed with how the revelation was handled.  The answer could've been changed throughout the show. We get the immediate connection to The Others from Danielle. ""No, but I hear them. Out there, in the jungle. They whisper."" And at that point they could've been The Others. But still, a lot of the whisper transcripts could be people trapped on The Island. Like ""Dying sucks"" that was heard during the Whispers. Commenting, scaring and warning the people around them. At this point it could even be an eerie effect to create suspense and mystery to the show.  My theory on this: The trapped souls, those who whisper, were summoned by The Others (or followed them) as an attack mechanism. One or several of The Others with the ability to talk to the dead could make a deal with a group of whisperers to attack Keamy and his gang and then release them from The Island (like Aragorn with The Army of the Dead) when the job was done."

I felt that he was over protective of Walt because he wanted to keep Walt in his life since he was born, but his wife prevented that from happening. After his love for his son was forcibly taken away by Brian, he clearly was in a dark place. You can then feel the frustration when Brian drops Walt off because Brian was not fit to be a father. Michael has Walt back in his life and he wants to make sure something like that never happens again. That's why he was so harsh on John Locke, he had an irrational fear that Walt would want Locke as a father.  Season two onwards when he pretty much compromised the entire groups situation ... that's when I was iffy on his character. I understand his love for his son transcends all, but he pretty much disposed of all his friends that helped him and his son assimilate on the island like they were nothing.  tl;dr I liked season one Mike, I did not like season two Mike.

Your comment is irrelevant because it assumes that everyone was watching the series the same way you were - if I were to do that (assume that everyone watched the show the same way I did), we wouldn't be having a conversation here, but a cock fight. Oh and if you think they are naive, consider that I only knew what I was in for by the time I reached Season 6.  By the middle of Season two the show was positioning itself to be perfectly logic-driven from my perspective, and every mystery that was solved (disregarding the ones that were solved near the end of the series) was receiving a satisfactory scientific / pseudo-scientific explanation. It wasn't until Season 6 that they started resorting to metaphors to explain key happenings on the Island."
lost,31zlq4,theverybest27,5,Thu Apr 9 17:53:44 2015 UTC,"It was never about any of that. It wasn't about the mysteries, the science or the faith. It wasn't about the whispers or the numbers, the Source or the donkey wheel. It was about the journey. Not the spiritual journey. The physical journey. The interactions that occured on the Island. It was about Jack and Kate, James and Juliet, John and Ben, Desmond and Charlie etc. Without the characters the rest of it means nothing."
lost,31zlq4,chefbigbabyd,2,Fri Apr 10 09:24:10 2015 UTC,"I didn't get that feeling while watching the show. Perhaps if I spent a long time thinking about it now after the show, I would come to the same conclusion, but what I'm interested in is what actually happened in my mind, not what I think SHOULD have happened.   In hindsight, when I think about my feelings when watching Lost, what kept me glued to the show wasn't me being highly interested in learning how Jack sorts out his self-esteem issues; what kept me glued was wanting to know what that light coming through the hatch door when Locke was banging on it was. What kept me glued wasn't absolutely dying to know whether Charlie manages to patch things up with Claire; it was wanting to learn how Desmond knew that Charlie was going to die. What kept me glued after I saw Charlie's death wasn't wanting to know how the other characters would deal with his death; it was wanting to know the implications of it being ""not penny's boat"" and learning who's boat the heck it actually is and what do they want. What kept me glued wasn't the need to get a resolution to Locke's personal belief conundrums; it was wanting to know why he is able to walk again and what did he actually see when he looked into the ""eye of the Island"" and what exactly happened there. This is what kept me, personally, interested.  For me, the driving force was the mystery. The characters etc. were of course completely necessary in the show, but they were not why I tuned in. If there were no mystery and only the character element, we would be left with something that I would consider a mediocre drama. It was the mystery that made this show different from all the other dramas, and since from my perspective the way the mystery was presented positioned the show to be completely logic-driven (refer to my first post for details), I expected a completely different conclusion to the series.    I still enjoyed watching the show, mind you. It's just that I feel like I've been drunk for the past few weeks, which felt great then, but am now suffering an incredibly bad hangover and ""I wish I never drank in the first place."""
lost,31zlq4,chefbigbabyd,4,Thu Apr 9 12:42:13 2015 UTC,"Most of those were answered in the show. Jack's self esteem issues were caused by his dad, and his desire to go back was to figure out why or what his dead dad was doing walking around on the island and getting back to the people they left behind. The light in the hatch with Locke looking down was Desmond turning a light on in the hatch which was reflected in a mirror, IIRC, as he was rightfully, weirded out about someone beating on the hatch opening. The reason Locke could walk on the island, is the islands magic and healing powers, and after they came back, his body was taken over by the man in black, which wasn't 100% explained, but that's the fun of the show. Not penny's boat, was the mercenaries from Widmore, trying to get the island back from Ben, since Ben had banished Widmore so many years before.   I haven't been on the site for awhile now, but you should you should check out thefuselage.com or lostpedia. Tons of answers and theories on those sites, and honestly, added to my viewing pleasure as I was watching the show week to week season to season. I've now watched thru the entire thing at least 4 times and still see, or learn new things every time through it."

The only thing I'm getting at is that, the way LOST was structured, it drew to it a lot of people who  love mystery but who do not care much (or at all) for how the characters deal with issues and evolve in a show (I am one such person). And for someone like that, the show looked completely ""different,"" from start to finish, than to someone who pays a great deal of attention to the evolution of the characters, hence creating a huge understanding barrier between the two groups."

Now that I've understood your post, I'll say this, Those are most of the reasons a lot of people watched, IMO, that's what got my wife hooked when I finally convinced her to watch it through with me, that's what hooked my buddy that got me hooked on it in season 3. I agree with your original post that different people got different things from the series. Again, reference those websites I posted, you'll find all kinds of differing views on the show, and I think that's what made it such a phenomenal show. Just my thoughts, have a good one, see ya on the other side brotha"
lost,31zlq4,raeyne4,2,Thu Apr 9 13:23:27 2015 UTC,"I think the thing you were looking for was a definitive solution.  LOST was never going to tell you the answers to the ultimate mysteries.  They put what they felt was enough evidence for you to figure it out on your own.  I'm like you.  I watched for the mystery; the puzzle.  Did you ever do the ARG (Alternate Reality Game) for LOST between seasons? Websites full of hidden links and articles on Egypt and pseudosciences. Or read the book Bad Twin by Gary Troup?  Both of those were great exercises in asking questions and digging deeper.  LOST had a spiritual ending.  What if it wasn't really?  What if it appeared to be a spiritual ending because it was the only way Jack would accept what happened to him?  What if there is a scientific, or at least pseudoscientific, explanation for it, just no one in the room knows exactly what that happens to be save for one guy, and he's explaining it in the best way he thinks they will understand?"
lost,31zlq4,mastyrwerk,1 point,Thu Apr 9 13:31:46 2015 UTC,"That could be, yes (the part about Jack not being able to accept what happened to him). But it feels like a somewhat ""forced"" solution to me, meaning I didn't get the feeling that this is what the show was suggesting and it seemed to me like everyone in the church knew exactly where they at that very moment.  (Of course, if I push it hard enough, I can position anything in the show to be whatever I like it to be, but that defeats the purpose to me personally.) If only that scene did not take place at a church, then a more ambiguous explanation of the ending would have been feasible to me. As it ended though, I can't see it.  An ending closer to yours with a more definitive solution to the origin of the Island would have been exactly what would have left me satisfied."
lost,31zlq4,theverybest27,1 point,Fri Apr 10 02:30:22 2015 UTC,"I understand where you are coming from.  Considering the church had religious iconography of multiple religions, I took it as placating to the spiritual as ""any way you want to believe, this still applies"", which also means, ""you can believe anything you want if it makes you happy"" which means ""the truth is more than what you believe"".  Faraday had more scientific understanding than anyone.  When he told Desmond on the bench that he believes he already detonated a bomb, I concluded that the puzzle is still in play and that even if we don't have all the pieces, we can still figure the picture out.  I learned so much while watching LOST.  Not from the show itself, but from researching things like how islands are formed (a parasitic island is made by an underwater volcano venting lava out the side instead of the top, creating a sister island.  If Hydra was the top and the Island was the parasitic, then an explosion underground could sever the Island from the volcano and slide to the bottom of the ocean with the surface and all the buildings intact).  Or how imaginary space (also known as imaginary time) runs perpendicular to regular time and therefore is not chronologically in sync, which explains why people are remembering their Island lives out of order from when they died, but the transition was instantaneous for them.  Or the Many Minds Interpretation of Quantum Decoherence which suggests that every you in every possible universe is connected to you on a subconscious level, and if you were consciously aware of these universes, you'd never really die (Quantum Suicide Machine is like Shrodinger's Cat except it's you that's in the box).  The ending of LOST was perfect for me because I knew they would give those needing answers a solution they can go ""ok, they are dead and happy; don't need to think about it anymore,"" but also give people like me enough to keep asking questions and dig deeper.  The afterward, ""New Man in Charge"", reenforced all of it for me.  Like life, there is an explanation for everything, even if we never find out what that explanation is.  That shouldn't stop us from looking."

I'm not particularly religious/spiritual myself, but like you I binged the show over the course of a summer, and this particular summer I was living a pretty limited life. I was taking a summer course in school, I had moved a few hours away from my prior life to attend the school, and I was interning and working. Even if I had had time to spend with my friends, I was dead broke.   As lame/nuts as it sounds, I got very attached to the show and the characters, and watching the show was as close as I got to being with friends. So by the end, or I should say The End, it felt more like a college reunion with all the people I loved and missed. The grin on Hurley's face when he sees Charlie again is almost as good as the ""waking up"" scenes. That moment encapsulated how much I missed the people I cared about and how I would feel to see them again. The church scene was how I imagined I would feel if I walked into my old house and all my friends were having a party, waiting for me.  I'm gonna stop rambling about how many feelings I have about the show HAHA, but I understand your point, even if I can't relate."

lost,31zlq4,shutupredneckman,3,Thu Apr 9 13:26:35 2015 UTC,"As it turned out, the monster had completely no logical explanation behind it   Why do you say this? Season 6 established that the source was an amalgamation of electromagnetic energy and exotic matter. Season 4 established that if you are exposed to electromagnetic radiation, it will kill you unless you have Desmond's immunity. Season 2 established that electromagnetism in the Lost universe is able to ""download"" (for lack of a better word) the memories of those nearby it.  The monster isn't ""a dude got thrown in a cave and then there was smoke"". The monster is ""a dude got thrown in a cave which was filled with electromagnetic energy, the radiation from which killed his body but preserved his consciousness; his mind was fused to the pocket of electromagnetism while being torn from his body, and as a result he was able to control electromagnetic energy and create a new body for himself"".  Yeah, that's a comic-book-y/sci-fi explanation, but it's still a grounded-in-pseudoscience answer.  In fact, virtually all of the ""spiritual"" aspects of the show have these same sorts of answers when you really pay close attention to the show's mythology. The thing is that spirituality doesn't overwrite the scientific. The two work together with the latter often informing the former. That's what we see on the show too. Jacob and the Mother didn't know anything about electromagnetism, so they explained the island the best they could: as a light, a cork, a prison, etc. But when DHARMA came to the island, they used their scientific knowledge to uncover that the island was really electromagnetism and exotic matter (which had the properties and functions of a light, a cork, or a prison)."
lost,31zlq4,shutupredneckman,1 point,Thu Apr 9 13:32:38 2015 UTC,"Exactly this.  Most people see the Flashsideways as an ""afterlife"" where they all died and went to heaven, but with Faraday's journal theorizing time travel and imaginary space and Desmond actually quantum leaping into the past, future, and sideways alternate timeline, the scientific explanation of a branching timeline that everyone can leap to after their consciousness no longer inhabits their original timeline becomes all the more plausible."
lost,31zlq4,shotuprodneykmen,1 point,Thu Apr 9 16:50:56 2015 UTC,"Seems like a forced explanation to me. I see no reason why a huge electromagnetic field would turn anything into Smoke form, and a Smoke form that can be controlled. I would have accepted any pseudo-scientific explanation for this if it were made by the show itself and as long as it was in harmony with the nature of Lost's universe.   For instance, if I watch Harry Potter I am not going to complain that it makes no sense for the flick of a wand to turn someone into stone, because unexplained magic is part of the Harry Potter universe as it is presented from the beginning, and I accept that and watch it for what it is.   With LOST however, my personal impression was that everything about the Island would have a logical (even if just pseudo-logical) explanation to it, as opposed to metaphorical explanations. And in the first few seasons I had that - I received a logical/pseudological explanation to everything that was happening. But then as we got closer to the end, we suddenly have Jacob touching people to make them go to the Island, Jacob touching people to make them immortal (I understand immortality would have something to do with the electromagnetic field, but not how Jacob's touch would transfer that power onto the person), why Jack wasn't turned into a smoke monster after he re-plugged The Heart, and most of all -and which I consider the biggest mystery of all-, the poor explanation of how the smoke monster came to be.   None of the above were explained as far as I'm concerned, in neither scientific nor pseudo-scientific terms; they were only explained through metaphors, which I understand, but which wasn't what I expected from a show that had a logical explanation for all the major plots for the first few seasons."
lost,31zlq4,lloza98,1 point,Fri Apr 10 02:12:18 2015 UTC,"The electromagnetic field didn't turn him into a smoke form. It turned him into a form without a body. (You mentioned Harry Potter - the MIB is basically turned into what Voldemort was after his Killing Curse rebounded and hit himself; he was turned into something ""less than the meanest ghost"" that had no form except when attaching himself to something. He was just a mind/consciousness without a body.) The MIB wasn't smoke; he was formless - just a bunch of electrical impulses.  However, because the MIB was fused with the island's electromagnetic energy, he could now manipulate that energy himself. And electromagnetic energy in the LOST universe is only able to do 4 things. One of those things is manipulating magnetic material. Another is bending/scattering light. This means that the MIB, in his confusion, tried to quickly create a new body for himself in the limited means he knew how, which means he either 1) used his ability to manipulate magnetic material in order to pull magnetic fillings from within the cave to create a makeshift and rushed new body for himself (and this is what looks like ""smoke"" - if you know what iron fillings look like, a whole bunch of them together does look extraordinarily like black smoke), or 2) he used his ability to bend/scatter light in order to create a mirage/illusion of black smoke.  Both are very scientific or pseudoscientific explanations. Neither can be chalked up to magic.  What other parts of the show did you think were magic or too spiritual to also be scientific/pseudoscientific?"

Everybody thought that the bomb went off, and they successfully made the alternate timeline, but then they reveal that it isn't an alternate timeline, just somewhere they met up after they died.  Now we look back.  When Juliet hit the bomb it all went white. We assumed that was the bomb going off, but it also goes white when they travel through time. They were close to the ( I don't remember what it was called ) ""power"" that the swan station was built on, so it's plausible that it was the reason they traveled through time again.  Also, when they traveled through time, Juliet wasn't dead. If she actually set off the bomb, it would have gone off instantly and she would have died. The only reason she died earlier was because of the debris that was on her.  There's a bunch more evidence, but it's pretty nitpicky and I'm too lazy to type it all.  I like the theory that the bomb didn't go off, and they instead built it into the swan station as the failsafe that Desmond would later set off.

lost,31vtrz,hasek747,6,Wed Apr 8 15:38:11 2015 UTC,"Honestly, pick a character that was around for more than a season. Just to start naming some randomly. Charlie goes from a very self centered not caring about anyone else type of guy ('oh guys I can't swim, someone else save that girl'), to literally sacrificing his life for everyone else. In a similar dynamic we have traditionally very selfish Kate, matures some after becoming a mother and actually has very selfless reasons for returning to the island. Jin and Sun have huge character shifts over the course of the show. Jin starts out as the cold controlling husband while Sun is the shy battered wife. By the end Sun is much more the calculating in charge wife, while Jin is pretty much only beaten by Hurley for most loveable character on the show. Speaking of Hurley he has a journey throughout the show from stereotypical fat comic relief, into much more serious leadership roles. Locke starts out as this bad ass of near mythic proportions, and the entire show is the slow erosion of that side of him until he's killing himself in a motel room. Sayid, while pretty static in the first 3 seasons (other than the repeated I am/I'm not a torturer bit), has lots of changes in the last 3. We see him go full on into the thing he hates when he starts working as a hitman for Ben after Nadia's death. Then that leads into him pretty much given up on life and resigned himself to the idea that he's damned and unsaveable and ends up trying to kill a child. And then in season 6 we have him even darker siding with MIB awhile before his eventual sacrifice.  Hell, even with Jack you kind of glossed over much of his character development. Even before then we have jack going from pretty standard protagonist, slowly becoming more and more hellbent on the whole 'rescue everyone' hero trip that it's more of a character detriment and he ends up spending a lot of time in season 3 acting a bit crazy. And then yeah sure theirs that major shift they just kind of spring on you without actually developing (though they do go back and develop it over the next season). Fair enough. But even after that he's not really done. There's still the transition of him trying to be the one to fix things in season 5 (even if he tries to act like he's not) and that leading to disaster and Juliet's death and finally deciding to just follow the island's lead in season 6. Claire is probably the better example of all character development skipped over and we just skip to the end result. Which was a shame since I thought there was a lot of potential with her in season 4 to have her go in a darker direction after Charlies death, which would have flowed a lot better into the end result.  Ironically, traditional fan favorite character Desmond, now that I think about it, doesn't really have much in the way of character development. He does a lot of stuff, and he's awesome while doing it, but he's pretty much the same the entire way through it. What little we do get is in flashbacks.  I could name more I'm sure, but there's a start certainly."
lost,31vtrz,SageOfTheWise,3,Wed Apr 8 16:14:11 2015 UTC,"The thing with sun that alot of people dont get about asian women is their strength is a different kind. Quietly controlling things behind the scenes.  Keeping secrets and knowing how to keep their familes and husbands under control. This is very common for asian wives.   Like the airport scene where the white couple loudly chastizes(sp?) sun for being ""docile"" but really she can hear and understand everything. Kind if showcases that silent control she has.   I agree she becomes more of a traditionally western wife but they show that even in the past ( paying off the greedy mother, taking the initiative to learn a language) it all shows her character as strong, but smart and just trying to keep the peace."
lost,31vtrz,asuka_is_my_co-pilot,2,Wed Apr 8 17:51:38 2015 UTC,"Jin starts as a controlling husband in the show, but after flashbacks you can see he comes full circle as he started as really nice guy with strong ethics.  It was his love for Sun that led him down the wrong path and Paik using him to destroy the marriage. And it's examples such as this that just goes to show how strong character development really is."
lost,31vtrz,Fats33,1 point,Wed Apr 8 16:35:39 2015 UTC,"I actually love Hurley's change so much.  Jack expresses it the best too,  they were the best duo."
lost,31vtrz,KingKolder,1 point,Wed Apr 8 20:58:13 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the very detailed reply, quite insightful for me to actually see examples of this.  Some of my initial thoughts (none of the below means that I do not agree with you, just that what you are saying was/is not necessarily as obvious to me, even after giving it some thought):   Charlie felt like a fairly decent guy to me from episode one. Basically a kind guy with a heroin problem, which made him seem ""bad"" at times. Once the heroin problem was more or less gone his ""true"" kind character was revealed in full. I'm not exactly sure how to put it into words... just didn't feel so convincing to me. More like the real him was being ""clouded"" and we got to see the cloud being lifted.  Kate also struck me as a caring person from episode one (first time we see her she is helping Jack despite feeling sick about doing it). Wasn't she also from pretty early on very eager to go help Jack almost whenever needed, and would never take ""no"" as an answer when she wanted to tag along with a group? My memory could be foggy here since I only watched the series once. I'm not sure I agree that she was a ""runner"" - seems to me more like the running she did was perfectly justified (I would consider anyone who wouldn't run when they are being chased for murder, or when 'their' kid is about to be taken from them, well, odd). Even in the end, she still ran and left Jack, despite probably being able to help save his life if she had stayed - but she chose to ""run"" given the opportunity to do so, which I don't think is a bad decision at all; I only say this to point out that I'm not sure I see an evident transition from Kate in S01E01 to Kate in Season 6.  I agree about Jin and Sun, thanks for pointing them out. Regarding Hurley, I think this is the only one I strongly disagree with. The leadership role you speak of I feel was pretty much ""thrown"" at him regardless of whether he wanted it or not. What I'm saying is that I do not recall noticing any changes in his character that would make him a better leader; he had more on his shoulders near the end, yes, but that was more due to the script/lack of other viable alternatives and I didn't feel that Hurley himself was any different; he always felt fairly bold and interestingly confident starting Season 1 to me, and that's also how I remember him being when ""moving on."" He never felt incapable to me (although I disliked him heavily after he destroyed his hidden stash of Dharma food as a symbolic way of putting food behind him... you don't do that kind of stuff when stranded on an island and it just made me think of him as an a-hole throughout the rest of the series :P) About Locke. Hmm I don't think I got the feeling that he was a bad ass at all. Felt like a sheepish guy to me who got a temporary confidence boost (bordering on mania) due to being able to walk again, but then at pretty much the slightest resistance from the Island (first time something didn't go his way) he gave in and slowly started reverting to his sheepish self, ultimately ending in him wanting to hang himself. I can see how this could be considered character development, just that perhaps I had a different imagination of what it actually is. About Jack, thanks for explaining, makes sense. I really hated his character in the series so it's quite likely that this clouded my judgment of him.   Overall, I think I was thinking in more generic terms regarding what character development actually is. In my mind it's more like a ""how he came in vs how he went out"" kind of thing and I wasn't taking into account the things in between. Would appreciate your comments regarding what I wrote above since it will possibly help me see things even more clearly. Plus, please remember that my memory on the details is probably not as good as yours."
lost,31vtrz,raeyne4,1 point,Wed Apr 8 21:03:32 2015 UTC,"Well some of the character development is more subtle, and others are more observable. I think Ben and Sawyer are great examples of characters whose evolution was somewhere in the middle. But there is development for many of the characters, especially the ones that were around for the whole show.  Jack is an example of an obvious switch- man of science to man of faith. But it was more than that. Jack struggled with control issues, which interacted badly with his low self esteem. He wanted to always be in charge but believed he wasn't capable of handling the responsibility of actually being in charge. By the end of season 3, Jack had accepted his role as the leader, but this leaves his control freak tendencies unchecked and he ruins his relationship with Kate by the end of season 4. In season 5, Jack becomes ok with loosening his grip and letting others take charge, and is season 6 he actually becomes a blend of his old and new self, both a man of science and a man of faith. He becomes a true leader and accepts the consequences of his actions, he does what needs to be done and makes the ultimate sacrifice for his friends.  Kate is also kind of an obvious evolution. Instead of running, Kate learns to stay put and cares for aaron. She faces her legal responsibilities and tries to have a real relationship with Jack. When she goes back to the island it is out of a feeling of responsibility to aaron and to claire.  charlie is another good one. when we first meet him he's pretty immature, self centered and way into drugs. he learns to care for claire and aaron, even though he and claires relationship is difficult and focuses more on the baby than any benefit to charlie (aka he's not getting laid on the regular). In the end he sacrifices himself to ensure claire and aaron's safety.  Anybody else?"
lost,31vtrz,mtwestbr,1 point,Wed Apr 8 16:11:51 2015 UTC,"I am going to agree with you on a few characters.  My wife and I both agree that Kate started as a runner that found a way to snatch defeat from the jaws of every victory and really did not stop that pattern.  The flash forward sequences were key here in seeing the subtle changes in people.  I don't fully understand how, but I am pretty sure you see the change with Hugo after he drove the van and later got off the island."

They always used the same bunch of extras that should have been there without having new ones randomly show up, giving them names or nicknames and keeping track of who was dead and such. It's more work than it sounds like; if you read their original planning document that was leaked last year, they said they were just going to have all the background people randomly disappear so as not to have to deal with them. It was that documents many obvious attempts to make the show sound easy and cheap so the network would pick it up, I'm guessing that ABC gave them more free reign after the pilot did so well so they luckily didn't have to do that.  Having a couple people we happen to have never seen before show up is certainly contrived—they did cast new actual actors rather than just use the extras they already had—but I wouldn't say it's quite as annoyingly convenient as some of these other things. It's understandable that in a group of several dozen people the audience would happen to never see a few for a while."

A lot of people also view Lost as a ""con"" because either 1) they believed the show was leading up to their own pet theory and were disappointed when it didn't happen, 2) they felt that the whole show was supposed to be just a giant mystery leading to one singular answer rather than a multi-layered story with many different mysteries included that aren't necessarily related to one another, and/or 3) they saw Season 6, took Jacob's/the Mother's explanation for the light and island at face value rather than remembering what DHARMA had said about them, and then felt the show had conned them by being all about science and pseudoscience for the first five seasons and then suddenly being about ""magic"" in the sixth season (even though this ""magic"" was actually just science and pseudoscience from the perspective of characters who didn't understand those things).  Luckily, there's still a lot of people who remember the show fondly (and there's even a handful of people who dislike the show for legitimate reasons like the show belonging to a genre they're not interested in, etc.); it's not a legacy entirely of inexplicable disdain."

It's one of those things where a few years later the only thing people clearly remember about that season is that there was time-travel and all they can think is ""Time travel, that must have been confusing and boring and ridiculous, right?"" and don't remember much about the actual story that was happening.  Season 6 as well, kind of. No one was saying really more negative things than they did any other season until Across the Sea, they were mostly really excited, though that's not quite as telling about the actual opinion about quality because it was the last season people would have been excited anyway.  In general people really mis-remember how great the last few seasons were, and I think that's made even worse by the fact that they remember the first few seasons as better than they were. Don't get me wrong, they were great, but when people look back after not having watched them for years, nostalgia goggles click in and people remember them as being the coolest thing ever and absolutely flawless, which they most certainly weren't. It's like they want to construct this narrative of the quality of the show based on how other shows (and most other things, bands and such) tend to go down-hill overtime and how they thought it would turn out, so their brain makes it up for them."

Season 5 was especially experimental and inventive with time travel and payoff regarding the Dharma Initiative, and delved deeper into the science fiction genre than Lost had done before.  But, the show was still a drama, not genre scifi.  The trouble came in season 6, when the show adopted a ""been there, done that"" rehashing of plot using the flash sideways, whose meaning was more spiritual than scientific, as it turns out.  There was much buildup and the plot was stretched very thin here.  I personally loved the finale with its spiritual message even though I'm only so-so about season 6.  I think a majority of people misread Lost as science fiction, but really it was a character drama with touches of science fantasy.  It's kind like how the new Star Trek movies are science fantasy, but the tv shows were science fiction.  We're comparing apples to oranges.  Compared to a deeply scientific show like The X-Files where Scully was rigorously using rational analysis at every step to foil Mulder and to understand the paranormal, Lost was about Jack's conversion from cynicism to faith.

For Ethan to be of a group of people who can't (or don't) cover their feet just doesn't add up, so the reveal that the Others are actually quite advanced makes more sense then them being savage jungle dwellers.

She says, ""Then get rid of it,"" hands him the jar of Dharma ranch.  She encourages him in the food throwing (from the transcript.)  Had Libby said, ""Hey, let's put all this back in the Hatch,"" or ""Let's distribute it to the group,"" Hugo would have done that.  But he's head-over-heels in love with Libby at this point and it's actually her idea to destroy it.   However, Hugo is open to the idea of destroying the food, as we saw in 2x04 (""Everybody Hates Hugo""), when he actually dragged dynamite down into the food pantry and was ready to blow it up, until Rose talked him out of it.  Basically, Hugo's in a bad place in season 2, ever since the Hatch got opened.  He's having a mini-breakdown. His odd behavior starts right before the Hatch is opened, and just spirals downward from there, until ""Dave"" jumps off the cliff.   In my head-canon explanation for Libby's behavior, she's eating-disordered as Hugo is, only in the other direction (hence her exercising, when they have more than enough work to do around the camp just to meet basic survival needs, and she has to be malnourished from her 48 days in the bush.)"

And try to think through and see if you can figure out the answers to the questions yourself before the show tells you the answers (but try to keep wild theories that aren't supported by the in-show evidence to a minimum).  2) Don't look up anything on your own that you have a question about. If you absolutely have to know the answer to something, you might be okay posting your question here and asking when the show is going to answer it (instead of asking what the answer itself is). If you've already gotten past the point in the show where the question has been answered, we can tell you what the answer was if you tell us where you are in the show. Otherwise we can tell you how much longer it'll be before the answer shows up.  3) There's more to the story of Lost than just the show if you're interested in the expanded universe of the show. This includes such things as a series of ""deleted scenes"" that were filmed and aired between Seasons 3 and 4 to give viewers new perspectives for certain eras or events, an epilogue, and various in-universe teasers meant to be watched before starting a new season to hint at what is to come in that season. If you have any interest in watching this extra material, let us know and we can provide links (and tell you when you should watch it during your watchthrough)."

These are self-explanatory. Answered, but you have to put A and B together. The answer is in the story somewhere, and if you remember certain details, you have your answer. But no one comes out and directly says it. Generally unanswered, or an ""answer"" is not possible. These are more big-concept things. It's like asking how magic is possible in Harry Potter. It's just there. And there are definitely parts of Lost that can be basically described as magic or supernatural.

You shouldn't even be on this subreddit - even the titles of posts have spoilers. Don't look at anything Lost-related online! If you forget names and stuff, just stick with it anyway. You don't need to absorb every little detail to enjoy it. Just pay attention to what you can. Maybe watch some of the key episodes twice before moving on. Do whatever you can to avoid spoilers."
lost,315ozx,xaxisofevil,1 point,Thu Apr 2 06:10:07 2015 UTC,"Like /u/xaxisofevil said, Lostpedia is a very bad idea. It's an amazing website for after you finish the show, but you can get spoiled pretty badly even by the safest-seeming articles. If you do decide to keep reading, make sure you only look at the episode summary itself and not the trivia or anything like that; no matter how tempting it is to read really interesting things, that section is purposely very spoiler-y. Unfortunately I think you have just about as high a chance getting spoiled if you look at old discussions, not only did people from the future come back and accidentally spoil people, but for the most part to even get to those pages you have to see spoiler-y things. The thing that helped me a whole bunch was listening to podcasts; they're a little more of a time commitment, but usually they're fun to listen to, made by dedicated fans so you learn a lot, and almost entirely spoiler-free because they were recorded at the time and can't accidentally be changed later.  If you're really confused by something, you can always ask this on this subreddit. Some people may accidentally spoil you, (or even purposely for some trolls, be careful even with this post,) but it's not a guarantee like with some other websites, and they're also easier to avoid because it's easy to see if an individual comment or PM is a spoiler you should stop reading rather than having one hidden in the middle of an article. Do you have any questions about what's going on now, at the end of season two?"

lost,312b0f,SPAtreatment,3,Wed Apr 1 22:52:18 2015 UTC,My favorite was one about the island being the future place of Manhattan. People go through a portal through the earth from wherever the plane crashed and everyone went directly through the earth through a portal to the other side to the future of Manhattan which was in ruins and then eventually down to nothing. Which was why the reflection in the water of most marketing materials showed a city skyline. And then some things went with the plane and the people on it such as the polar bears. I always liked that one as Manhattan somehow had been detached from North America.
lost,312b0f,flyingbattleship5,3,Wed Apr 1 23:28:04 2015 UTC,"My favorite theory and one I still think would have been one of the best surprise explanations of the show, was that the people on the plane were hand selected by Jacob, who at the time was in charge of choosing candidates to repopulate earth in case of a cataclysm. The people on the plane were given hallucinating gas to disorient them and knock them out,  the plane was landed, dismantled on the beach, and the people were all frozen. Desmond was put there to make sure earth was habitable and to keep them frozen, and that if he ever stopped pushing the button that meant humanity had met its end. So when he didnt push the button, he actually tripped the auto-wakeup sequence, in which a cloud of nanobots would arrange the people like they had been in a plane crash so make them think they were still in the present to avoid them freaking out about being frozen for hundreds of years. The twist of the entire show would be they get back to the mainland only to find it had been destroyed for hundreds of years, and that even desmond had no idea."

Considering they were only on episode 2 or 3 of Season 6 when that came out, it was mind-blowing.  Oh yeah, and the call sheet that was found at a bar for the finale listed them going down to ""HELL"". I'm assuming that's what the cave was...but yeah.  Earlier theories...I remember from ""Some Like It Hoth"" (I believe) where Miles is ghost busting and he goes up the stairs in the house and comes back down and the pictures on the wall have changed...the theory started going around that everything was a time loop, or parallel universes or something similar.

One of the reasons is revealed towards the end of Season 2, but it is revealed very subtly and quickly. It's very easy to miss. However, the writers also released a bit of out-of-show content throughout the show's run to tease upcoming seasons or further the aims of the Alternate Reality Games that the show gave birth to, and one of these videos reiterates the answer given in Season 2 with greater clarity.  If you want to see that video, watch the following link. However, note that this video wasn't released to the audience until after Season 2 (during the ARG that took place between Seasons 2 and 3), so if you want to experience that answer at the same time as the people watching the show live did, wait until you've finished Season 2 to watch it:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PPCCcXarkc  The second reason isn't revealed until Season 6."

If they're gonna do a Lost spinoff, they should make it about the Dharma Initiative (pre-Losties time travel invasion) like about the Hanso foundation and the discovery of the island, then them establishing their settlement, then learning that there is an indigenous people on the island. Or something better, I don't know. The writers are pretty good and I'm sure they can do it. But sideways-Ben isn't the most interesting character.

""We have to go back"" was just mind-blowing when it happened, and I had from May til January of the following year to think about what all that meant.  Also, ""Not Penny's Boat?""  Well who is it then?  Pilot.  I missed out on season 1 live, but I caught a second airing of the Pilot right around Christmas 2004.  Based on that episode alone, I dropped $50 the following August on the DVD set and proceeded to binge-watch Season 1. Exodus.  ""We're gonna have to take the boy.""  Glad I didn't have to wait very long for Season 2. The Incident. We finally meet Jacob, and he dies!  We finally see the full statue!  We finally see the contents of that coffin Ilana's men have been carrying around, and, wow, if Locke's still dead, who's that in there with Ben and Jac...oh...!  We see this incident we've heard about for 3 years now!  Jack and Sawyer fight, and a nuclear bomb goes off, or does it?  What else does an episode have to do to make a top 10 list? The End.  Season 6 was the weakest one, to me, but The End is still one of the best episodes of the show. The Constant. You can't not have this one on the list. What more needs to be said? Walkabout.  Same as above. The Shape of Things to Come. Felt like Season 4 was dragging on when the writer's strike had hit.  This episode was the first one they produced after that was resolved, and it was an example of the show at it's best. The Man Behind the Curtain. Finally get some Ben back story, and our first trip to Jacob's cabin!  Also, Ben kills Locke, or does he?  Well...not yet... Across the Sea. A very polarizing episode, but I liked it.  Wish they wouldn't have included the flashes to season 1 though.   But there's so many good ones that get left out of this list."

However, I am planning on re-watching Lost this Summer with a couple of family members who want to start getting into the show; I bet my list will be much different after then, but here's what I think (and what I can remember) as of now:   Honestly, I love Confidence Man. This episode sticks out to me the most out of all of the episodes as far as how much I remember it, and that is why I'm ranking it so high. I'm sure that it probably won't be as high after my re-watch, but this episode for me will always be up there in terms of how much I love it. I liked the flashbacks regarding Sawyer (and little tidbits of the 'original' Sawyer) and how the episode was the first tipping point of his growing chemistry with Kate. All in all, superb episode. There's No Place Like Home. Watching Sawyer kiss Kate then jump out of that helicopter left me in tears. Through The Looking Glass -- this one isn't even self-explanatory. Great episode, but sure as hell a sad one. I was blown away by ""Not Penny's Boat"", even though it had already been spoiled for me beforehand. The Pilot. From the moment the Pilot began, I was completely engaged with the show. By the end of the first episode, I was hooked. Not many series have grabbed me that quickly and that intensely as Lost did. After seeing that wonderful episode for the very first time, I knew I was in for one hell of a journey. Live Together, Die Alone, mainly because the hatch being destroyed was one of the most memorable and insane moments of the series for me.    There are quite a few other moments in the series that stick out for me (Boone's death, introduction to Desmond, the light turning on in the Hatch, Sawyer killing Sawyer, etc.), but I don't remember their specific episode names and don't remember many other episodes enough for me to rank anymore of them justly."

Much of his life he'd been wandering around in crazy situations, always after one purpose that was to find Nadia. And then she died and his whole life's purpose was gone. He was completely miserable and had been off killing people and openly admits to being paranoid. Then he gets arrested and is put on this plane where he randomly sees all these other Losties who he wanted nothing to do with, then flashes off the plane without even knowing what's going on in the first place. Then no one bothers to tell him that he's in the past and he even more has no idea what's going on and then all of a sudden in all that confusion up walks young Ben Linus.  And he realizes that in all the craziness and turmoil that is that situation and his life, that just had to be the reason for it all. For the first time since finding Nadia, he finally had a purpose again, as he said himself: ""When I woke up in the jungle and I realized I was back on this island....I felt there was no purpose to it. But now I know exactly why I'm here."" He (not totally illogically) thinks killing Ben will fix everything, and in comparison to that things like trying to fit in with Dharma seem silly. And everything from there is him trying to fulfil that purpose.  I totally think it would make sense for Sayid's character, with what we know about his personality and all he's been through, to act that way in that situation (again, unless you're referring to something else I'm not thinking of)."

Unfortunately, their method for saving people involved putting them under that water and they accidentally drowned him. Then he comes back to life two hours later.  As for why he came back to life, it seems to be MIB's doing, but it doesn't make a whole lot of sense. For the most part, considering the circumstances of making a show and just how much is going on, I think this show did a great job explaining things and tying things together. That one aspect, however, anything relating to ""claiming"" or ""the sickness"" is, in my opinion, the most muddled and worst-put-together explanation in the show. It seems like in later seasons the writers were putting together their story and connecting most of the things nicely and then thought ""Oh crap, we have this random thing from season one, let's just somehow try to put it the story we're trying to tell now."" There are kind of ways to put it together, but you have to force it a little,  I think this Lostpedia article does one of the best jobs I've seen tackling it."

If Sayid had just explained, Jin may indeed have helped him out. But from Jin's point of view, Sayid pretty clearly demonstrated he is not on Jin's side and legitimately seems (and really is) dangerous.  As for, more practical reasons: 1) Sayid used Jin's gun to shoot Ben, so anything other than the truth may arise suspicion as to how he got it. And 2) Ben witnessed the whole thing, if he did survive like Jin was hoping he wouldn't want him telling a different version of what happened. But I think those are kind of secondary because when Jin answered the call he was probably dazed and didn't have a lot of time to think of greater implications of lying vs. telling the truth, it's probably mostly the first thing."

Judging by Jacob's criteria, those former candidates most likely could have still become the new Jacob if they really wanted, same as Kate.

It kind of makes sense when you think about it; the population of Australia is less than 1/12 that of America, and you'd expect about and equal proportion of people from both countries to be on the flight because in theory the number of times people are flying to their destination and returning home should be about equal.

Some people seem to mis-remember that as being the case, so I was just pointing out that we have no reason to believe it's true.   No, its never explicitly stated in the show so there's no concrete basis for thinking that. That's why I stated in my original comment that I was speaking hypothetically.

It's just that he can't go outside the radius. The freighter was inside the radius of the island.  Which means that I don't think it's MIB in the hospital with Jack, because it won't make sense. It would either be a manifestation from The Island, a hallucination by Jack or ghost-Christian visiting like Charlie visiting Hurley.

So the Christian that takes Claire is MIB while the Christian that talks to Sun and Lapidus is really him/the Island. It makes more sense that it was an Island projection on the freighter, telling Michael that he wouldn't be protected anymore (since he couldn't die until the Island was done with him). This would also explain how he got across the water, since MIB isn't supposed to be able to, right?"

[...]  First we built a world. Then we filled it with an ensemble of flawed but interesting characters -- people who were real to us, people with enough depth in their respective psyches to withstand years of careful dramatic analysis. Then we created a thrilling and undeniable set of circumstances in which these characters had to bond together and solve problems in interesting ways.   Soon thereafter, we created a way for you to witness their pasts and compare the people they once were with the people they were in the process of becoming. While that was going on, we also created an entire 747s worth of ideas, notions, fragments, complications, and concepts that would -- if properly and thoughtfully mined -- yield enough narrative fiction to last as long as our corporate overlords would demand to feed their need for profit and prestige, and then, just to be sure, teams of exceptionally talented people worked nonstop to make sure the 747 never emptied out.  And then we made it all up as we went."

Anyone can come up with a million sci-fi ideas before the pilot even airs. picking one or two of those ideas and actually developing them to a full plot line with interesting start-middle-AND END that actually unfolds well is the hard part.  All and all, as an avid watcher in actual air time the show proved to present the core problem of TV writing, as it ended in complete mess and unsatisfactory fashion - mainly due to the never-ending aggregate of possibilities instead of conclusions that the capitalistic profit based work process of television demands.  quick edit forseeing the regular argument stating ambiguity is part of it and we should expect a full closure to the show  Yeah ambiguity is cool in two scenarios - either is specifically has a relation to the message and meanings evoked by the plot, and thus is an actual artistic strategy with substance to it (rather than a cheap trick).

Boone was really that important to all these people, but not The Marshall, Arzt, Ana Lucia, Faraday, Charlotte or Mr. Eko? Desmond gets to bring Penny, but not one of the other castaways had a soul-friend off-Island? And what is Christian doing there?  The notion that all these people were so important to each other that they waited a near-eternity to ascend together is an acceptable concept, but only if you stick to your own internal logic."
lost,30a1en,Petrichor03,2,Thu Mar 26 18:49:03 2015 UTC,"Shannon was there instead of Nadia because the writers felt Sayid had a more real connection with the former than the latter. This is understandable because Sayid was in a romantic relationship with the two women for a similar amount of time, and Sayid had already dismissed Nadia as either probably being dead or being as good as dead by the time he got to the island, but he carried Shannon's death with him for the remainder of his time on the island.  Ben may have redeemed himself to others in his time with Hurley, but he wasn't redeemed in his own eyes until he could spend more time with Alex first.  Eko had most likely already moved on with Yemi (see the ending of ""The Cost of Living""), and none of the others were ready to move on yet. They had their own groups of most-important-people-in-their-lives to move on with when they were ready.  Who else might have been an off-island person who needed to be brought along? The only people that come to mind for me are Helen and Charlie Hume, but they would have wanted to move on with their own most-important-people-ever. There's also the theory that we're just seeing Jack's perspective of the flash-sideways, and since he never knew about these other off-island people, they wouldn't have shown up in his personal flash-sideways moving-on thing.  Christian was there to help Jack finally let go, which is something everyone else had managed to do at that point. But Jack was a hold out. He needed something big to push him to let go.  They didn't wait for one another. They all go there at the same time. Their consciousnesses essentially all flash-forward to the same time in their dying moments. The show did stick with its own internal logic in the building of the flash-sideways."

Sayid knew Shannon for roughly a month and a half until her death on Day 48 in ""Collision,"" and was romantically involved with her for about three weeks.  Sayid reconnected with Nadia in January of 2005, married her in February of 2005, and they were married until her death in October of 2005.  Length of a relationship doesn't necessarily correlate with intensity, but Sayid was married to Nadia for 8-9 months, and they would have no doubt stayed happily married if she hadn't died in the traffic accident."

lost,30bicr,dap300,4,Thu Mar 26 00:43:30 2015 UTC,"My theory on the Numbers.  Jacob had built, or let someone build the Lighthouse, tapping into the Heart of the Island, and showing him all the potential Candidates through space and time.  360 of them.  The idea is to choose six as the finalists.    Now, like a lottery with 360 numbers, there are 2,899,305,949,260 possible 6 number combinations.  Of all those combinations, or potential universes, 4 8 15 16 23 42 (the one focused on in this show) is the only one to successfully defeat MiB and create a unique timeline that branches off of that universe that the heroes can crossover to once they die; a real ""afterlife"".  So, the reason why this universe has so many references to 4 8 15 16 23 42 is because the manipulation Jacob used of the Light to favor these six rippled throughout reality.  In another failed reality, the Numbers everywhere might be 9 45 83 104 202 360.  Oh! One more bit.  4+8+15+16+23+42=108.  108 is the amount of minutes for Desmond to push the Button. The number 108 on the Lighthouse Wheel said ""Wallace"", which is a Scottish name.  Desmond Hume was Scottish, and the secret weapon for uncorking the Light and stopping MiB.  Purely speculation, but what if Jacob deliberately wrote ""Wallace"" on the Wheel instead of ""Hume"" so that MiB would not think he was affiliated with the Game, and not a threat?"
lost,30bicr,mastyrwerk,2,Thu Mar 26 18:42:45 2015 UTC,"Nah the numbers represent multiple things in lost: Jacobs list,  swan code,  and a whole bunch ton of little things.  There were a lot of factors on why they went back to the island,  and why they went in the first place,  one being Desmond's accident.  The other being Ben.   *The numbers are obviously significant for the losties especially for Hurley but I don't think Jacob was manipulating their lives..   I swear he mentions that he chose them because their lives sucked.  And Itd be better  to go to the  island.  Something like that"

The island was there, but to get to it required entering and leaving on a very strict bearing, making it almost impossible to stumble upon (especially since the island moved as well and the entry point would obviously move with it). That said, plenty of things can come and go as we saw with both planes, a helicopter, Widmore's boat (sort of), Michael's little motorboat, and the Black Rock ship. Since they left and returned a lot, the sub ensured that their movements were not detected to give away the secret to accessing the island. Most people that happened on it by accident never made it out, so really they only had to worry about people seeing them come and/or go, and the chance of that was greatly reduced when they were out of sight and below sea level."

If someone loves the show they should make their own judgement call on finales"
lost,2zu8t1,aleatoric,1 point,Sun Mar 22 01:10:50 2015 UTC,"The end of Dexter was a complete catastrophe mostly because the motivations of the characters become completely WTF. But honestly, that show was going downhill way before end. I consider myself a fan of Dexter Seasons 1-4, but everything after that was spotty at best.  I won't lie to you - a lot of people out there felt similarly about LOST. After several seasons into the show, they lost interest or didn't like where the plot was going. I'm just not one of those people. I acknowledge the show has its faults, absolutely. But for me, the good far outweighs the bad. I really wish I could go back and rewatch the show for the first time, because it was one of the best media experiences I have ever had in my life. That's from Season 1 all the way to the end.   If you do decide to watch the show, here are a few (non-spoilery) things to keep in mind:   A lot of watchers started dipping out around Season 3 (some as early as Season 2). They felt that the show's plot was going in wayward directions. There's a reason for this: the show had no end date. Worse, it's a plot heavy, serialized show watched by an audience with extremely diverse expectations. Think about that. How do you plan plot arcs and character growth without knowing how long your show will go on? Will it be 5 Seasons? 10 Seasons? They did their best to cover their bases and create a compelling show despite this writing nightmare.  Around Season 3-4 is also the time of the 2007 Writer's Strike. The delay that this strike caused might have actually helped the show. It gave them some downtime to negotiate with ABC, and out of that negotiation, they were able to get an end date to the show. You can feel the shift immediately going into Season 4 -- the show's purpose is renewed, and they stop opening up new plot threads and focus on closing the many that were opened. I love the rejuvenated energy the show has around this time, and it's one of my favorite parts of a rewatch. It also helps that the top fan rated episode of the show is in Season 4 as well.  Yes, the finale is also a point of contention with watchers of the show. If I were writing the show, personally, I'm not sure that's how I would have ended it. But after a lot of contemplation, I actually think it was a beautiful ending, and now it's hard for me to imagine any other. After several watches, I've come to understand what they wanted to do with the show, and I applaud it.  Were they able to close every plot thread? I think the most important ones were resolved, and some minor ones can be resolved by connecting some dots. There's nothing I particularly want answers to -- I have all that I need to understand the show. But I'm also an imaginative, contemplative person that doesn't think every answer needs to be nicely gift wrapped and presented to the audience like they're idiots. It's a cerebral show about life, the universe, and everything, and those are not topics that cannot be easily addressed. The treat them with the open-ended complexity that they deserve and require. The show also prioritized characters as #1 and the sci fi oriented plot as #2.    Anyway, I urge you to watch. TL;DR- if you enjoy the characters, you will enjoy the show even through the points where the plot makes you sigh restlessly. If you hate the characters, I might not stick around for the plot alone."
lost,2zu8t1,KingKolder,1 point,Sun Mar 22 02:15:01 2015 UTC,"Okay I'm going to compare experiences between when I watched lost finale and the Dexter finale.   When I saw Dexter,  first thought: how the hell did he go on a plane like 3x in a day and expect_____ to wait.  I mean the last shot was slightly clever but the lead up was a huge mess.   With lost,  ""anything before the end is just progress"".  I hope you enjoy it and burn a week enjoying the ordeal of oceanic flight 815.

lost,2zkcey,Greensledge,3,Thu Mar 19 16:34:14 2015 UTC,"Well, because things that happen to us in childhood are a huge factor in the person we become. We are who we are because of genetics and environment. A person with a stable childhood and good parents is enormously more likely to be a stable, well-functioning adult than a kid raised in violence or with addicted parents or in bad foster homes. A kid like Sawyer just didn't have much chance to grow up to be a really good person.  That's why I find it easier to forgive him. I also like him better than the other characters, because it seems to me that he grew and learned and changed the most. It took a magic island, but he did change, more than a lot of the others. Kate, Jack, Locke, Sun, Jin, Hurley--how much did they change from beginning to end? Not much compared to Sawyer."

Sawyer had plenty of opportunities as an adult to do the right thing.  He knew right from wrong and that was shown when he couldn't go through with conning that woman when he saw her son come into the house.

They were ""together"" for about a week and she is busy moping around and jealous that Jack is moving on with Juliet.  Sawyer was with Juliet for THREE years!  At least Kate had a real relationship with Jack and she seemed to be genuinely thrilled when he proposed to her."

Feeling aggressive? Kill Mikhail (I know he didn't really, but HE thought he was killing him). Feeling gullible?  GET MURDERED BY THE GUY WHO HAS NEVER BEEN TRUSTWORTHY.  Locke was nutjob who followed his emotions and his ""faith."" He never used logic and reason. His only positive qualities were that he was an amazing hunter and made a pretty dope dog whistle."

lost,2zkcey,lostfan2015,-2,Thu Mar 19 21:39:46 2015 UTC,"Eeeehhhhhh. I think it's more a story about Jacob and the MiB, you just don't realize it till closer to the end. But either way I wouldn't call Jack the ""main character"". Yes, he is more central than, say, Bernard and Rose, but the story invests heavily in lots of the characters. From that standpoint it could be argued that Locke or Sawyer, or the survivors as a whole were the main character. But to call him the sole main character, in the same way Walt is the main character in Breaking Bad, isn't exactly accurate."
lost,2zkcey,Penelopise,4,Thu Mar 19 16:29:05 2015 UTC,"I know you hate him.  But LOST is most certainly Jack's story more than anyone else's.  It opens with his eye and the story literally ends when he dies.  Locke is there to challenge Jack's core beliefs, to help him see what his bigger purpose is.  Sawyer was a B-character that was given more prominence because of his popularity.  His story arc essentially ended when he killed the real Anthony Cooper, but the creators kept him on and let him fall in love with Juliet and that became his purpose.  But he was pretty useless when it came to Season 6 and the mythology.    Most of the characters are important, some more or less in varying degrees.  But at the end of the day, Jack is the central human character.  The island can be argued to be a character as well, but I am strictly talking about people."

When Ben was saying she didn't mean anything to him, I originally interpreted Alex's expression as one of defeat/helplessness because Ben wouldn't stop scheming and she knew it wouldn't work.

Juliet Reason: She has probably suffered the most out of every freaking character. Not just for the reason that she couldn't go home when she wanted to, not the reason where she lost her chance to go home and not just the reason that she was thrown back in time and left to live another 3 YEARS in Dharmaville.  The real reason is because when she got forced down the hole, she let go of Sawyer's hand and she still didn't die, must've suffered so much.

The flash sideways is the after-life that Christian is referring to and as such not an alternate reality, but something that happens after the lives of the individuals on the island. To quote from lostpedia:   The flashes' first appearance immediately followed a flashback to Jughead's apparent detonation. This suggested that though the 1977 characters traveled to 2007, the detonation also somehow created a separate timeline. (""LA X, Part 1"") Later episodes alternated between the flashes and the main timeline, suggesting two timelines ran concurrently. The finale finally explained the flash sideways, completely debunking the alternate universe theory. The question of whether or not the blast contributed to the sideways world's creation remained perhaps deliberately ambiguous.   So, it's for sure that the flash-sideways is the afterlife, but we're still not sure about Jughead's detonation. I am going with the theory that it did not explode and instead was the Swan failsafe that Desmond eventually activated."

And we were all fooled by it. The Jughead ""explosion"" was a red herring, and most fan theories regarding the finale were centered around it. Most people thought it created a ""split"" in the timeline. I was all over these forums and Lost Podcasts around the time the show ended, and I don't think I saw one correct prediction for how the show would end."

I believe the white flash that engulfed Juliet at the end of Season 5 was seeing her being pulled through time from her perspective. They all seemed to perceive the world fading away into a brilliant white while being propelled through time during the time jumps.  I think after they vanished from the site of the Incident in the 70's, Dharma learned of their plan and incorporated Jughead into the continued construction of the Hatch/Swan Station. As a desperate last measure in case something went wrong with the station. That's why they weren't fully sure of what the failsafe key would do once turned. I think the light under the island absorbed the nuclear explosion which tainted it somehow. Maybe that was why the light shining through the Donkey Wheel opening was green when Ben and Locke had to push it but appeared golden and pure when MiB was constructing it."

The show and the writers worked hard to set up the premise that what happened, happened. So with that logic, the losties always went back in time and always helped influence the past and the future (that they eventually crashed landed into). With this, the bomb went off, the pocket of energy was messed with, the swan hatch had to be built as a frequent release valve, and Desmond missing the code caused the crash. In short, the losties caused their own crash on the island. All part of Jacob's plan (despite it being so far fetched that one person could devise such a long con)."

Clearly they didn't die, so he was wrong about that, so why is it assumed that he's right about the bomb going off?  New Man in Charge is still debated as canon; one line on a white board doesn't mean anything, especially considering they clearly scrapped the idea.  I've had a lot of discussions about Jughead on this subreddit, and as a result have done a lot of research on it. Realistically, Jughead couldn't have gone off. If it did, 80% of the main cast would have died.  If we're talking about in show evidence, Juliet. If Juliet had set off the bomb she could not have possibly survived the time jump. She was within arms reach of a hydrogen bomb. The bomb could not have detonated, broken the rock layer holding back the light, and release the light causing a time jump before it would have reached Juliet.  Another thing, the bomb would have to go off either before or after the time jump, and we know it didn't go off in either. If it had gone off before the time jump, Richard, Pierre, Radzinsky, they would all be well withing the blast range and would be very very dead.  If it had gone off after the time jump, well, that would have been the end of Lost. Jack, Kate, James, Miles, Hurely, etc. would all be in blast range. There's no way it could have gone off without it being extremely clear that it had gone off. That's almost certainly why they scrapped the idea of having Richard see the mushroom cloud.

The light at the Swan couldn't have caused a time jump anyway. Only exotic matter (or someone manipulating exotic matter) can cause a time jump, and there is no exotic matter at the Swan site.

There's no ""exotic matter"". It's the pockets of electromagnetic energy spread throughout the island. The heart of the island is just one big pocket. EM energy is what caused their time jumps.  They were drilling at the Swan site because they knew there was a particularly large pocket under it, and they wanted to control it (which earlier inhabitants of the island managed to do to a certain extent, i.e. the donkey wheel).  The time jump was caused by the rock layer breaking, releasing massive amounts of EM energy and causing a time jump.  As far as Richard goes, think about it from his point of view. They took Jughead, went to the Swan with the intent to detonate it, there was a very large and bright light, then they were gone. Of course he thought they were dead, where else would they be without him or Jacob being able to find them.  In fact, the Incident is almost entirely the reason that Jacob had been watching them for so long anyways. Obviously he knew about what happened at the Swan. Most of them were born by the time of the Incident. When Jacob tried to find them, he did. But they were all children. For obvious reasons he decided to keep an eye on them."

See: the Swan orientation film.   Of course he thought they were dead, where else would they be without him or Jacob being able to find them.   But that's not what Richard said. Richard said ""I watched them all die."" That's more than just an assumption of death because they trotted off with Jughead in tow and then he never saw them again.

Juliet hits the bomb, which taps into the pocket enough to cause the time jump. This is exactly what happens to Desmond in season 2, just  on a bigger scale. I imagine the blast also neutralized the electromagnetism enough that metal stuff stops flying around, so Dharma is able to pour concrete over the blast site (just like in Chernobyl as Sayid mentions) and to create the Swan station to deal with the remaining energy in the pocket."
lost,2zefq2,raeyne4,1 point,Wed Mar 18 13:49:51 2015 UTC,"Why can't it be both?  In the show, we see Desmond time travel to the past, and see visions of possible deaths of Charlie, which is like time traveling to the future.  Then in the sixth season Desmond travels to the Flashsideways while still being alive.  That could be the afterlife, or it could be a split in the timeline at the point of Juliet hitting Jughead (she hit it 8 times before the flash; love that).  So, if you want to think in terms of quantum physics, Juliet detonated Jughead, which was right next to a source of ""exotic matter"" that caused the Island to separate from the underground volcano supporting it and sink into the ocean.  This forced a massive evacuation of the Island and setting things in motion for the Flashsideways.  It also means Jughead didn't detonate.  The mysterious powers of the Island sent everybody back to their normal time.  The people of the 70s poured concrete to contain the radiation and leak of ""exotic matter"", but that concrete caused the ""exotic matter"" to continue building up, requiring a release every 108 minutes.  In the event this fails, Jughead was repurposed to destroy the ""exotic matter"", and the normal Island timeline continues as it always did.    The Flashsideways runs perpendicular to the Island timeline, not parallel.  Faraday's Journal shows this. In it it refers to ""imaginary space"" which is synonymous with ""imaginary time""."
lost,2zefq2,mastyrwerk,1 point,Sat Mar 21 22:29:31 2015 UTC,I've always assumed it did blow up because they constantly reference the fact that it worked. Juliet says it worked (referring to faraday's plan). His plan was to blow it up so that it couldn't be blown up in the future to crash the plane (if we assume the fail-safe is the bomb).
lost,2zefq2,logicalthinker1,2,Wed Mar 18 00:33:17 2015 UTC,"Your assumption also assumes that the ""it worked"" is in reference to Faraday's plan to basically change what happened. Taking the full story into account, it doesn't seem like that's really the case. Juliet didn't actually say that it worked before she died. Miles got it from her after she died, so it's entirely possible (I'd even say very likely) that it's a reference to the afterlife and not really the events that happened before she died. It's also possible that the ""it worked"" is the two worlds syncing up as it's what she says to him when she shows him the vending machine trick right before they both reconnect with what happened in real life."

Sequel: Walt is brought back to the island by Ben and Hurley to figure out a way to help the ghosts move on. He stumbles across the DHARMA parapsychology station. Using the station and his abilities, Walt accidentally forces all of the ghosts on the island into the various corpses littered around the island (insert Hurley's new mirage-inducing ability and healing ability to de-zombify the ""corpses""). This alerts the last members of Hanso (and/or Mr. Paik?) that DHARMA's attempts to change the Valenzetti Equation finally worked. The parapsychology station came through for them. So Hanso/Paik tries to reclaim the island in order to ""save the world"" while the off-island Others and Ajira survivors run interference and question whether Hanso/Paik should be allowed to take DHARMA's research from the island (or whether fate should just run its course). Perhaps MIB is also one of the ghosts that is brought back to life and restored to a deceased body, but no longer having any powers he goes on a personal journey and really examines his newfound mortality. Does he dare attempt to venture across the waves of the ocean now that he doesn't have to in order to survive (like when the island was falling apart)? Perhaps he searches for the donkey wheel chamber or the various wells across the island to try to tap into those sources again.

Now for some questions:   Why do people bitch about reposts in the first place? What does it accomplish, other than filling the thread with bitching? What is so bad about a repost if it's not karma whoring? Is it bothering you THAT much? Do you do an advanced search every time before YOU post something? Do you realize how infamously shitty reddit's search engine is? Do you realize we're on a subreddit devoted to an 11 year old show, so FUCKING EVERYTHING IS A FUCKING REPOST?? Do realize you sound like an asshole when you call out someone who is just trying to post something cool? Can you understand that maybe they were excited and just couldn't wait to post?  There are many more reasons to not call out people about reposts, but the main reason is just shut the fuck up and go watch Lost.  Also, OP, great user name!"

lost,2z868t,th3STlG,7,Mon Mar 16 12:45:39 2015 UTC,"You make it sound like Ben made a conscious decision to handle this as if he was an asshole, as opposed to you know, him just naturally being one. Turns out they weren't called The Hostiles because of how hospitable they were. Your questions could just as easily be turned around. Why not? Why spend your time and resources on what? A bunch of intruders you've already marked off as the bad ones. They aren't going to like you. Doesn't matter how you dress it. They aren't going to be allowed off the island (that's just a security risk of insane proportions) and they aren't going to come live with you, we've established that. Just kindly explain to them the reasons why they must eek out a living on the beach the rest of their lives, then cross your fingers and hope they're the understanding folk (despite you knowing they aren't.) This plan doesn't end well.   Simpler plan is to just intimidation and present yourself as more powerful than you are. Pretty much worked too until Ben started running too many different plans within plans and it eventually fell apart. Plus the survivors randomly stumbling into an armory didn't help.   Tell the ones you don't want to just stay on the beach and live out their lives.   They did that. That's exactly what they did. They had that whole speech about how this was their (the others) island, they were just letting the survivors stay there. And if the survivors just stayed where they were and didn't cross over into the others territory they wouldn't be harmed.  The survivors did try and ask why. When dealing with Ethan, their entire goal was to capture him alive so they could more or less scream 'WHY' in his face over and over. He died so that didn't work out. Wasn't exactly time to ask why's during Walt's kidnapping so we can excuse that scene. They tried again at that ring of fire scene but The Others had the upper hand then and were going with that intimidation strategy so no answers there. Tried getting answers out of Ben, even tortured him, but he wasn't even admitting he was an other for most of that. Michael more or less asked, but he asked in a 'what is wrong with you people??' sort of way, and they just basically said 'dude you're the one going around murdering people, whats wrong with you?'. First half of season 3 was more or less entirely comprised of Jack sitting in a cage asking why. Though at that point 'why' was 'we're trying to manipulate you into helping us', telling people you are trying to manipulate them is usually a bad idea. Though ironically Ben does eventually come right out and say it once that part falls apart. Then after that part we pretty much knew enough about them that it became a moot point."

lost,2z868t,Petrichor03,3,Mon Mar 16 14:42:36 2015 UTC,"Why harass them? Why do it that way?   The Others never intended to harass the survivors. Jacob gave them a list of all the survivors that he wanted to be integrated into the Others' society, so Ben and co. had to figure out a way to get those people without alerting the other survivors to the fact that the Others had all of these resources.  Remember, there were 72 people who survived Flight 815's crash. The Others probably didn't have enough resources for all of their people and 72 more. And if all 72 survivors managed to get together and try to attack the Others, they might succeed, depending on how many Others there are in September of 2004.  So the Others had to keep the survivors away from them. The problem is that Ethan's wife died when she got pregnant, so he really wants to solve the pregnancy problem. So when he found out that Claire was pregnant, he started experimenting on her. And when the survivors realized that Ethan wasn't who he said he was, Ethan panicked and kidnapped Claire even though that was against his orders.  Ben couldn't have just talked to the people and said that he needs to take a handful of them while leaving the rest behind to fend for themselves. The other survivors would have attacked the Others when they tried to take them. And Ben couldn't just let them leave the island because he didn't want the Others to think that people were able to come and go to and from the island as they pleased."

They also happen to be a cult of folks who live on an island and barely get out to civilization if at all. It's not all that shocking that they go OTT hardcore in some scenarios. Especially with their history. Keep in mind that the Others took the Dharma barracks by slaughtering dozens of innocent people.

With Jacob dead, MiB still can't leave the Island. He still needed to disrupt the Island's source of power at the heard of the Island, which is almost literately a cork. So it's not just an analogy, but the actual truth of the situation."
lost,2z5260,Girafarigging,1 point,Sun Mar 15 19:30:29 2015 UTC,"You're pretty much right. It's Jacob's rules that are prohibiting the MIB from leaving the island (and the fact that the MIB is forced to follow the rules because of his situation with the source), and the MIB is trying to leave the island, so it makes more sense to call the bottle the island.  But perhaps the writers (or Jacob) just didn't want to get into what makes the rules work since Richard (and maybe even Jacob) wouldn't (didn't) understand why they worked. After all, that was probably part of the reason that he identified the MIB as a force of evil rather than explaining that the MIB has to stay on the island to keep from extinguishing the source."

Specifically though, they used the polar bears to turn the Frozen Donkey Wheel in order to figure out what it would do and where it led to.

lost,2z2oma,xblindguardianx,3,Mon Mar 16 00:11:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you've gotta check out the epilogue: New Man In Charge  Eloise left for the LampPost Station in the 70s when she became pregnant with Daniel and seems to have been there up to 07. That was their scientific station where Daniel worked after he flashed back in time, so she knew everything about the workings of the island from being there for decades.  Electromagnetism because of the Incident. Ethan is born riiiiight before the Incident, then it happens, and then there are no more babies.   The numbers are a sign of fate working its magic. The candidates who survived to be the final 6 to replace Jacob happened to be the ones Jacob attached to 6 certain numbers. Those numbers appear all through the lives just as a symbol of fate and destiny of the candidates.  The Island keeps them from killing each other. Mother set a lot of the rules while she was Protector, and then Jacob sets a lot more once he takes over. Like MIB says when they were kids, ""some day you'll be able to invent your own game and make up whatever rules you want"".   The Losties were flashed back to the present by the island in much the same way as they flashed around before, so they didn't die. The bomb basically acted as a Failsafe just like when Desmond turned the Key. It let off a ton of the electromagnetic energy, but not all of it, and that's what forced them to set up the Swan Hatch to release a little of the energy at a time, up to the point where Desmond used the Key to release the left of it."

You break Jacob's rules, get off his island. Eloise left before on her own when she got pregnant with Daniel I believe.  Sort of like cabin fever, and caused by the strange distortion in time the closer you get to the island from outside of it. It drove people crazy. I'd say that's a part of the Island's security system that works to keep out anyone Jacob doesn't bring there.

But there are also special people in the Lost universe who have more of that electromagnetism within themselves and therefore have a greater control over electromagnetism in the world. Walt was one of those special people. This was revealed in Across the Sea.  DHARMA was testing on animals because of the Valenzetti Equation. A scientist named Enzo Valenzetti figured out when the world was going to end using an equation that factored in various elements of the world including zoology, meteorology, psychology, parapsychology, electromagnetism, and utopian social engineering. That's why DHARMA was established: to do experiments in each of those areas in order to change the values of Valenzetti's equation and thereby postpone the end of the world. This was explained in the Sri Lanka video and on the blast door map.  The purpose of the brainwashing room was revealed in the epilogue: DHARMA was secretly abducting Others and questioning them about their society to try to learn more about them, but then they had to brainwash them before sending them back to their people so the Others wouldn't know they had broken the truce.  They were chosen as candidates because 1) they were broken people whose paths intertwined with one another and would eventually end up on the island, and 2) because Jacob can see the future so he knew who he was going to end up choosing as candidates, creating a kind of self-fulfilling prophecy."

There have also been flashbacks to show other characters during that time, or to fill in other bits of backstory.  Given that it's based on a DC comic, and comic books love time travel, I could easily see Arrow doing flash-forwards or -sideways."

Here, people watch it 6 times and still discover a connection for the first time!   Sherlock is this ever confident problem solving guy that never fails.   In Lost the message is that everyone fails, everyone falter. And you have a choice to make.   He has all the answers.   No one knows all the answers. The mystery is real.   Other cast member are more of a support to Sherlock. They felicitate him.   It can be argued that there is no single hero in this show. Everyone has a role. A calling you if will.

The showrunners actually DID have the endings of the show planned out from the beginning.  Sure,  the show was stretched a little longer than they originally intended and,  sure,  they added new ideas as they came up with them,  but yhe ending was not quickly created due to time constraints.   I agree the first three seasons and the last three seasons are pretty different in terms of content and craziness, but that is part of what makes the show great.   I am sorry you weren't satisfied with the direction the show went, but i think you just expected it to be a different show then it was,  with different answers. The show gives you almost every answer you could possibly want without sitting you down like a child and telling you every little thing. And it leaves enough open that we can all discuss and debate it forever. You can watch and rewatch it several times, getting more questions answered each time and finding deeper connections and meanings with each episode.   Sure there are flaws. But that is kind of the point of the show. Despite people's flaws, they can still accomplish something great, something transcendent of normal life. Plus, the show is called Lost, not Found. If you expected the mysteries of the island to be answered straight forward and for everything to be wrapped up in a bow and given to you, you were missing the point of the show."

lost,2yvow4,citruselectro,4,Fri Mar 13 05:00:22 2015 UTC,"You are basically correct. Purgatory is probably a poor comparison to the flash-sideways universe because it is very limited who can go there, it serves a different purpose, and it is an afterlife realm, while the flash-sideways universe has everyone go there (so far as we're aware) and probably isn't strictly an afterlife realm.  That is to say, there is evidence in the show that the flash-sideways universe is a place people go as they're dying, not after they've died. For example, when the flash-sideways universe was first introduced into the show's mythology back in Season 2 (when Eko went to investigate the ""death"" of the girl who had drowned and come back to life in one of his flashbacks), it was mentioned that the flash-sideways universe existed ""between places"", i.e., between life and the afterlife. Then in Season 6 we saw Juliet dying in Sawyer's arms and telling him that they should go get coffee sometime/they can go Dutch/""It worked"", which are all things she was telling Sawyer in the flash-sideways. She wasn't actually dead yet, but her consciousness was already in the flash-sideways.  And this is why the church scene is interspersed with Jack's death. We're seeing what Jack is seeing as he's dying."

I don't understand the people who don't get it and hate on the ending - Christian explains the whole thing if you only pay attention.  I mean, he literally spells it out so simply that my eleven year old nephew got it, yet everybody bitched about how they were dead the whole time and then I have to get into arguments with them because I inevitably have to call them an idiot for not paying attention."

Although I turned it off at 17 minutes, I never got an impression of it being anything like that.   I have a lot of details for pretty much every episode. ""Fire + Water"" is not the greatest hour of Lost, but is highly underrated. It's riddled with symbolism that ties to the healing properties of The Island. And ""Across the Sea"" is something you can dwell on for a long time with philosophy (the rules, moral standards. You can add Kant and Locke in the mix) and of course religion. The same goes for ""Deus ex Machina"". ""Something Nice Back Home"" is also great for the almost David Lynchian atmosphere, one of the most underrated in season 4 because ""it's not as exciting as the previous episode"". Oh, and ""the 23rd Psalm"" is the best episode of season 2.  It would be very fun to be on a podcast, but I'm a busy guy who lives on the other side of the planet (Scandinavia).

""Something Nice Back Home"" is chillingly noir.  Hugo is at the absolute nadir of his ""hero cycle"" (and Jack is just a day or so behind him on the downward spiral.)  It probably is unappreciated as an episode because it's highly psychological and ""interior"" in its treatment.  That scene in Hugo's stripped-down room, where he's staring outside through the grate: it makes me shudder."

lost,2yq0td,Duck1337,2,Thu Mar 12 10:05:29 2015 UTC,"Hello!  I am here to explain my post for you.  TL;DR Torrents and magnet links are used to share data between users using BitTorrent P2P protocol.  A torrent files contains information about files, their order, folder names, trackers, info hash (those random letters and numbers), etc. TL;DR Torrent file has metadata and stuff.  A magnet links only contains info hash (those random letters and numbers), trackers and download name. Missing metadata is distributed by other peers. TL;DR Magnet links lack Metadata and stuff, but it is distributed by peers.  Seeders(seeds) are those, who has downloaded whole torrent and are sending what they have to leechers.  Leechers are those, who are downloading the torrent.  Peers are both leechers and seeders.  Also leechers doesn't download it in order, but are sharing missing parts, thus easing the pressure for initial seeder(s) and increasing general download speed for all.  For this P2P protocol to work you need information who is seeding and who is leeching.  Trackers tracks seeders and leechers, distributing that data to all peers.  DHT is a replacement for trackers, that allows to share that information between peers.  Private tracker sites require to disable DHT to be able to track your download/upload ratio.  Public tracker sites require to enable DHT, because they don't care about your download/upload ratio and wants for torrent to survive in case of tracker deaths.  I hope this information helps to understand my post better!"

Though with the whole flashback structure, its a bit hard to say an entire episode is filler since usually at least there's a flashback to a character you've never had a flashback for before so that's not filler. I'd say more that a decent number of episodes are going to have filler plots. Pretty much every episode is going to continue the plot in some way, but there might be some B plot that didn't need to exist. There's a bit of the show spinning it's wheels mid season 3 while the writers basically had to fight for an end date of the show, that's the worst it gets. Really though for network television, it's gotta be like one of the least filler shows ever. That was always the problem the network had trying to get new viewers, there were so many episodes, but pretty much all of it is all so plot relevant you can't miss an episode without losing the entire plot.

I found this:   During the nine days we scurried to cut the LOST pilot, we had to put in temporary music before presenting the project to the studio and network. Bernard Herrmann, Ennio Morricone, Hans Zimmer, Thomas Newman, James Horner, Vangelis, John Carpenter, and half a dozen other composers unknowingly lent their brilliant music for the first test screening of the pilot - which led to its ""pick-up"" by ABC.   Which makes it seem even more likely that Abrams was influenced by Carpenter; the real question is, did he realize it or not?"

When I finally finished the series, I was a bit disappointed. But I realized that's because I was confused on what it meant. (Once I understood it, I was mostly satisfied with it.) If I were you, I'd take your time going through the series so that you don't miss as much as I did. I probably got through all of it in about six weeks, watching maybe two episodes a night, more on weekends.  I will say also, I loved the journey the show went through.

For me, it was not confusing in the slightest, probably because I spent hours every week browsing forums and wikis, trying to find out as much as I could and falling in love with various theories predicting what it was all about. If you're interested and pay attention, you will not get confused. The end expressed a beautiful message, but I feel as if it was very very very poorly executed. It just seemed shallow and cheesy. It's like it turned from rich and deep story to an episode of Seventh Heaven. However, Lost is and always will be my favorite series of all time. You're in for a treat. Regardless of who you are, the last scene with Jack WILL make you cry, I guarantee it.  EDIT: This sub circle-jerks the hell out of Lost, you're most likely not going to get a well-rounded set of opinions. Just look at the downvotes I'm getting for expressing my opinion :P.

Well, you have to admit, a very good percentage of the people who say they didn't like they ending actually didn't understand it. And not in a ""Oh, it was so deep and awesome, you guys just don't understand!"" kind of way, like they legitimately didn't realize what actually happened; I won't spoil OP, but you know what I'm talking about. This sub is certainly a circle-jerk in many ways, but I think the reason you always get that response isn't necessarily because people automatically downvote negative opinions--a lot of this sub to be quite happy to pretty brutally criticize certain parts of the show--but just because people are so used to and annoyed by people thinking that other thing that it's a kind of instinct."
lost,2ylg9v,air_jordan1,0,Thu Mar 12 11:25:46 2015 UTC,"I mostly agree with your points, though I personally didn't actually hate the ending, (but I didn't love it, mostly because I don't like endings of series in general). This is why I think people who watch the show on Netflix or something after it's already finished tend to enjoy the ending a little more. There seem to be two main types of people who dislike the ending 1) the people who thought it was too complicated, who couldn't remember all the different characters and plotlines waiting from week-to-week and season-to-season and just declared it an incomprehensible mess, and 2) the people like you who thought it wasn't complicated enough, who spend time having fun analyzing and theorizing about everything and were disappointed when what the complex things they hoped would play out didn't as much.  People who marathon-watch like OP is planning to don't really seem to have these problems as much and in my experience seem to like the ending on average more than people who watched it at the time. Like you say without needing to wait so long between episodes they won't get confuse as long as they pay attention. And since they don't really have time between to come up with crackpot theories, they're more likely to enjoy the story for what it was and not dislike it for something else they hoped it would be.  Either way I'd highly recommend they watch it. No matter what they think of the ending, it's worth watching. No one watches 100+ hours of TV just to get to a conclusion, especially one that's over so they could just look up if they wanted, they do it because they'll enjoy the experience of watching, which with this show you should."
