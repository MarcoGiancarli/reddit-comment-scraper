A series of random thoughts:   You will find some help on /r/vandwellers, /r/skoolies, the skoolie forum. You can even get some advice from builders or handymen you know. General handyman knowledge will help a lot. I'm no pro handyman, but I've assisted with many projects and know my way around most tools. I borrow tools when needed, ask a lot of questions, and (when in doubt) muscle my way through it. It will cost more than you think, especially if you need professional help to do certain parts. Consider a smaller project at first (see below), since doing a single-level bus is going to cost anywhere from $5k-$30k depending on your fit/finish requirements and amenities (insulation, on-board water/grey/black tanks, shower, toilet, appliances, heating/cooling, cabinetry, solar/batteries). You may want to consider a smaller bus. There are decommissioned school buses all over the US for under $10k (under $5k if you're less picky), and it will cost much less to outfit a single level - especially when you factor in the costs of the mistakes you'll make.  You can always make a double-decker later if you love the process. You might be able to get a small, unsecured, personal loan to help if you have some credit. Otherwise it's going to be bootstrapped. Mind your head: we didn't go the school bus route b/c I'm 6'3"" and you lose 4-8"" of head room when building it out. If you can boondock while working, you can put your rent money toward it. We don't have power or water at the moment. While we used it for three months last summer in the same condition, it was tough. This time, we're parked near family while we work on it some more.

When I first started looking into a skoolie conversion I thought a double Decker would be so cool but then I saw the prices for used ones and also realized I didn't need all that room. They can be a pain to move around due to their height as well.  Start researching bus conversions now and save up $5000-10,000 that will be more than enough to buy a full school bus and get you started."

Interestingly though, of most of the articles I've read that covers some wheeled tinyhouse lifestyles, most of these people tend to share many similarities with what you'd think of as someone living in a trailer park.   They too tend to be leasing the land they are living on. Also living in a structure on wheels. So what is the exact difference between a tinyhouse owner leasing land and parking their house there, and someone else that is 'living in a trailer in a trailer park'? Other than the look and perhaps size of the structure, I am not seeing a huge distinction in terms of that."

Trailer homes are associated with a low quality of life rather than a frugal or efficient one, so a new term is needed to distance itself from that."
TinyHouses,3dwxlh,BonzaiThePenguin,12,Mon Jul 20 18:53:57 2015 UTC,"IMO tiny homes form their own category.  In the US ""Trailers"" commonly refer to single or double wide ""mobile homes"".  These homes are mostly segregated into plots of land called trailer parks.  Most trailer parks are not the nicest places to live and are filled with diverse and interesting people :).  Some trailer parks are called retirement communities with an age minimum. The retirement communities in my area are very much like normal neighborhoods (nice lawns, landscaping, etc). None of the ""mobile homes"" in trailer parks have wheels or can be moved very easily.  They are much like a shipping container, where wheels are temporarily added to relocate them.  The other close relative to tiny homes are campers or RV's.  Campers are typically built of lightweight materials making them easy to move around on a whim (vacation). Most campers are poorly insulated and can not function in cold temps making them seasonal.  Tiny homes do not fall into either of these categories.  They are heavy framed, insulated structures like a mobile home, but are mounted full time to a very heavy duty wheeled platform making them easier to move. Because they are very heavy they are not easily moved like a camper or RV. Yes people move them all the time....its just not much fun."
TinyHouses,3dwxlh,IAmAjax,5,Mon Jul 20 12:51:42 2015 UTC,"I agree that tiny houses fall under their own subcategory, however mobile homes are generally permanently built on the trailer much the same as a tiny house.  To stay a mobile home (and fall under the code requirements for mobile homes), the axles must remain attached.  Most people will remove the wheels and put a skirt around, but they remain attached to the 'trailer' portion of the structure.  Removing the house from the trailer and putting it on a permanent foundation turns it into 'prefab' rather than 'mobile' and standard building code would apply.  I only say this as clarification that mobile homes are not exactly like a shipping container, where the container is placed on top of a standalone trailer, rather they are like a standard shipping trailer with just the wheels removed."

TinyHouses,3dwxlh,drunkitect,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:07:14 2015 UTC,"The term ""park home"" also exists, and refers to a manufactured house-trailer that less easily-trailered than a ""mobile home/RV"" but more easily-moved than a ""manufactured home"".   I'm no expert, but my general understanding is that travel trailers are designed to be easily towed for weekend-, week-, or weeks-long vacations.  They aren't designed for full-time living, but people do use them this way.  They have fresh water, grey water, and black water tanks.  The appliances are often 2- or 3-way, meaning that they run on propane and/or 120V and/or 24V power.  Manufactured homes are houses that are built in factories, have truck-trailer wheels temporarily attached so they can be towed to the site, where they are placed on a permanent foundation.  Park homes occupy the middle ground.  They generally do not have tanks, so they must be connected to water and sewer utility mains.  They are wired for mains power, and are connected to mains power.  They are built on a trailer frame (while manufactured homes are built on a floor-joist system) and have axles permanently attached to the frame.  The wheels are often removed when they are parked, but it is not difficult to reattach them to the hugs with lug nuts.  In contrast, the wheels used to move manufactured homes are compete units consisting of axles, hubs, and wheels.  Just what I have surmised in reading.  Interesting, there are seperate sections in the National Electric Code for RVs and for Park Homes."

The former group of tinyhouses is fitting of multiple categories, including trailer homes. It is more controversial and more ambiguous as to what it is.   The latter group of tinyhouses, really are just houses as everybody knows of houses, but very tiny.   Not all tinyhouses have to be on wheels.   So the question is, should there be more specific clarification in the future by the community when discussing tinyhouses? Afterall, a person who wants to get into a wheeled tinyhouse, likely goes through different hoops and runs into different issues and experiences, than someone who wants a tinyhouse build on a property with a proper foundation and all of that."
TinyHouses,3dwxlh,homebuilding101,3,Mon Jul 20 19:23:33 2015 UTC,"It seems to me to be a Reddit thing.

Redditors tend to be quite young, so maybe they're less interested in a permanent housing solution and are more likely to look at and discuss mobile/temporary options."

Maybe people should be more concise about what they're talking about or promoting when it comes to tinyhouses. Maybe there ought to be more discussion as well on the other form of tinyhouses, the permanent variety, that are not on wheels.  Basically the continued promotion of ideas and sharing of news and stories, shapes opinions. If newcomers being first exposed to tinyhouses sees that everyone who does what is self proclaimed to be a 'tinyhouse', does it on wheels, then they almost view tinyhouses as necessarily having wheels as a second nature. This becomes the de facto definition of a tinyhouse.  For example, there were plenty of threads here from time to time from newcomers asking questions. It shows how they portray or view a tinyhouse. They would say things like ""I want to build a tinyhouse, so where can I find a good trailer bed?"" instead of ""I want to build a tinyhouse, how can I pour the foundations?""."

The latter is definitely just a tinyhouse, as in its a house like we all know it, but that is really really small.

If a treehouse is in a tree, then it is a nest.  This statement makes logical sense and yet a treehouse is not a nest. People call them tiny houses because that is what they are talking about. If they want to talk about trailers, they are talking about something else. Many something elses, like travel trailer, utility trailer, fifth wheel, tent trailer, mobile home, etc. At the very least, by saying tinyhouse you are probably limiting the options to tiny-house-on-wheels, or tiny-house-on-foundation.   Logic does not trump accuracy of description as it is actually used when people are discussing something. A better question might be the opposite; why ever call a tiny house a trailer when that particular word can mean so many different things?  It's like the difference between descriptive and proscriptive in linguistics; ""Descriptive grammar is what speakers say, and when, why and how they say it (and not whether they should or shouldn't say it.)"" Proscriptive is telling people what they ""should"" say.   edited for clarity"

TinyHouses,3dwxlh,alex4nder,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:43:01 2015 UTC,"Thats true, I thought about that issue. I think there are some differences I've observed.  Workshops tend to be 'buffs' in the field. In that they go there with the aim of hoping to become a specialist in some way, as they really try to practice the art of manufacturing. Craftsmanship is often a key parameter for most in this group. For example, wood workshops involve people trying to be genuine wood workers and craftsman. As a hobby perhaps.  But for makerspaces, they are more interested in having something made. They use a variety of tools. Anything really as long as they can get their hands on it. Very often involving electronics and some form of manufacturing. Open source is ideal. Often involves 3D printers. And frequented by hipsters. Quality of the manufactured product is not as big an issue. No need for much sanding/polishing or using the right technique. Even ducktape will suffice from time to time. There is also a lot of socializing involved here.  What I'd expect to see. Wood workshop = bunch of old guys, retirees or people interested in craftsmanship in the art of constructing things with wood for the house to pass time. Makerspaces = college grad hipsters that want to make some electronic device of sorts to sell on kickstarter."

Small truck mounted crane might be able to lift the roof for you, maybe a track loader with a hook on the bucket could swing it as well.  If you are looking for a simple staircase there was a tinyhouse called 'cape cod' on tinyhouseswoon.com that had a decent looking stair.  Also, bury the water line as well ,don't use a hose.

I've seen houses with cantilever designs, but with much higher ratio of what's inside vs what's cantilevered. And even then, it's one of the first points to fail, and incredibly difficult to fix. But I think if you keep on top of the weather-proofing you're probably fine.  I'm not brave enough to do cantilever."

As for the windows, pretty much every house we have seen has some sort of window in the loft where the wind would hit it. Are you saying that's a bad idea?

My amateur opinion is that if you don't move it, it'll probably be fine for years. The one house I know well didn't start failing until 20 or 30 years later. (But it is professional built.)   I would definitely not tow that though.   If you really want that much space, why not just buy a slightly bigger trailer? I think the simplified engineering, and the ability to tow would've been worth the slight extra cost."
TinyHouses,3ds1c9,mscleverclocks,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:31:07 2015 UTC,"We got it checked out today by a contractor and he said we were good to go. We have a couple of things working for us. First, there is more material inside the house than is cantilevered on both sides. Second, we have a 4x4 supporting beam encased by two 2x4s to support the lofts. Those beams are anchored to the beams of the house with tension ties and the beams are anchored to the steel of the trailer with tension ties. It has a ton of support.  As for towing, do you have a solid reason why you don't think it would work? There are many tiny homes with cantilevered lofts and they don't seem to have a problem. Aerodynamics will definitely work against us, but I don't think it's impossible."

I'm the person who is worried about installing a gypsy roof because of snowload (even though it is not really going to be an issue).  Driving 55 MPH is basically subjecting your house to a tornado. Plus, it's not bolted to the ground. So a lot of things are probably fine when the house is standing still, but not okay when it is being towed. Designs without towing in mind are more prone to breakage and/or causing trouble to your driving to swerve/lose control.  Just start slow, be cautious, and check often. You should be fine unless you're super aggressive or super oblivious."

One argument I have had success with is this.  The house part of my property cost me $30,000.  If I live in it for 5 years my monthly cost will have been $500.  Even if I burned it to the ground in 5 years it was cheaper than renting by a good margin!  If I can find some schmuck to give me $15,000 for it in 5 years (likely) my monthly costs drop to $250."

If you want you can engage them in conversation about it and find out what they are negative about in particular. You can chose to address those concerns with them. For instance  a big thing that comes up is privacy. My response to that is that the bathroom area is large enough to change in, the loft has a curtain so even if someone is goign to be crashing on our couch everyone can have their own space without being constantly in sight.  Even if you decide to have those conversations though, don't let it get to you when they don't change their minds.

TinyHouses,3dqs81,bikemandan,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:17:36 2015 UTC,Its hard to give specifics because rules vary wildly depending on municipality and what zoning your property has
TinyHouses,3dqs81,chackoc,3,Sun Jul 19 03:18:20 2015 UTC,"Look for ""occupancy"" permits or restrictions in your area.  There are usually separate rules for building structures in general and building structures that will be lived in.  Getting an occupancy permit typically requires significantly more prerequisites than a building permit.    My guess is that auxiliary buildings would not include habitation since ""auxiliary"" by definition suggests a main structure the new structure is auxiliary to."

Lots of people around here don't do permits at all.. we did not for ours, but our neighbor doesnt like us and complained to the county (we are in a subdivision) .. wasn't a big deal but cost a bunch of money to get an 'as-built' permit."

TinyHouses,3dqs81,intentionallife,2,Mon Jul 20 18:12:56 2015 UTC,Very relevant. My spot is on a failed subdivision started in the 70s. Also a garage is very much an auxiliary building.
TinyHouses,3dqs81,jimbles1,2,Sun Jul 19 00:40:57 2015 UTC,"Is there a limit on the number of ""auxiliary buildings"" you can have on a property under 200 square feet?    If not, this could be a great place to build tiny house communities."
TinyHouses,3dqs81,IAmAjax,2,Sat Jul 18 16:06:28 2015 UTC,"No. The land is super cheap (about 3,000 an acre), there are plenty affordable land contract deals, and there is an ""alternative methods"" community already started.  Apache CO"
TinyHouses,3dqs81,IAmAjax,2,Sat Jul 18 16:20:34 2015 UTC,Member of the Planning and Zoning for my town. It's common for a town to hold that if it's not specified or talked about in some way that it's prohibited. They probably define an auxiliary building as a non-domicile. Can you get a copy of the regulations on their website?
TinyHouses,3dqs81,RealDealVillarreal,2,Sat Jul 18 18:07:28 2015 UTC,Auxillary building and residence are 2 different things.  The 200sf rule allows homeowners to build outbuildings without bothering the building official.  The instant you are going to live in an out building it's considered a residence and needs to meet health codes and building codes.    You have let the cat out of the bag by contacting the building inspector.  If it's rural enough maybe no one will notice you living there?
TinyHouses,3dqs81,Brom42,2,Sat Jul 18 19:51:41 2015 UTC,I understand the definition of auxiliary.
TinyHouses,3dqs81,bikemandan,6,Sat Jul 18 22:40:42 2015 UTC,Perhaps I was not clear with my response.  Somehow that shed which starts out as an aux building takes on magical properties the instant you put a bed in it....so the state would have us believe.  Size matters not (said in my best yoda voice).  What's the worst they can do to you...personally I'd just live in it and keep a low profile. I've been following tiny homes for a while and the worst thing I have ever heard is a letter telling the person to stop living in it.
TinyHouses,3dqs81,tullynipp,2,Sat Jul 18 23:01:40 2015 UTC,Thanks. My biggest worry would be being told to tear it down.
TinyHouses,3dqs81,bikemandan,3,Sat Jul 18 23:24:37 2015 UTC,"Twice, I have built additions onto a house I owned or had an interest in, without permits. The first was in a small town of about 2,000 people- within city limits. It was a covered porch, approximately 8' by 12', then I walled in half of it, to make an 8' by 6' room with a window, door, plumbing, and electricity, to use it as a laundry room. I lived there for almost three years, and never had anyone from the state/county/city say anything about it. And it's still there seven years later, being rented out.   In the second case, I lived in a small cabin of maybe 600 square feet about a mile out of city limits. The cabin itself was mentioned as an ""outbuilding"" on the deed, but a previous owner had installed a bathroom and kitchen in two of the four rooms, and it had a septic tank and pumped water from a creek to a filtered pressure system for water. I added on an 8' by 8' addition directly off the kitchen to use as a combination laundry room/storage room/pantry. Again, no hassles during or after construction.   Both of these cases were in rural Texas, for what it's worth. Neither of them were completely new construction, but I honestly feel that if you're in a rural enough area, you tend to be left alone on stuff like this. It will also depend on how dickish your county/city are."
TinyHouses,3dqs81,OrcishWarhammer,2,Sun Jul 19 01:22:40 2015 UTC,"My place is a converted garage.  After I bought it, it was changed from an out building to a cabin on the property description.  The only requirement was that it had been used as a cabin and not a garage for at least 10 years.  It had been used as a cabin since it was built in 1980, so it magically became a legal residence."
TinyHouses,3dqs81,ethidda,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:48:16 2015 UTC,"Worst they can do...hmm. Depends. They definitely will tell you to tear it down and if not, levy fines and put a lien on the property (eventually making it have a zero ""value"" and impossible to sell). They might eventually get the sheriff to forcibly remove you and the demolish it themselves. Im not sure of the legal parameters of that scenario though. It would have to be a pretty serious health hazard for that to happen IMO"
TinyHouses,3dqs81,maverick_ninefingers,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:07:43 2015 UTC,"While I'm not from your state (or country for that matter) the usual thing with auxiliary buildings is permanent habitation. Generally it doesn't matter if its a basic building capable of housing someone for a short period (like hunting cabins, etc.) but they tend to care more if its your permanent residence.  My guess is that you would need a permit as they probably need a record of a dwelling on the property, then dwellings tend to require certain minimums to be met, etc, etc."
TinyHouses,3doj68,melissa0218,10,Fri Jul 17 23:25:22 2015 UTC,"You'll want to insulate and drywall it. Insulation is affordable and you can diy, but you really want to hire out drywall. I would guess both together somewhere in the $1000-$6000 range (really rough ballpark). Then paint."

TinyHouses,3doj68,Letmefixthatforyouyo,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:26:23 2015 UTC,Some European countries have these government subsidized tiny/small houses that can only be occupied for 4 months /yr or so.  This sounds like one of those.
TinyHouses,3doj68,ethidda,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:50:32 2015 UTC,No you can't. Mostly because they turn off the water and no snow removal
TinyHouses,3doj68,Nogoodhandle,3,Sat Jul 18 22:28:12 2015 UTC,Depends on where it is and what temperatures you are comfortable with. It can still get cold at night.
TinyHouses,3doj68,hockeystew,3,Sat Jul 18 01:08:55 2015 UTC,Ok thank you
TinyHouses,3doj68,ethidda,6,Sat Jul 18 01:10:16 2015 UTC,"Insulation will make it much easier to cool and keep cool as well as warm and keep warm. A space that size would easily be cooled by a small window A/C unit and heated by a small electric baseboard heater. That's a nice little cottage, I'm jealous. I would also suggest tongue and groove pine on the inside rather than drywall, it's much more forgiving to movement than drywall and with the added bonus of being able to hang things anywhere you want instead of just at the studs."
