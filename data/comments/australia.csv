The speaker is not there to get in the way of the Government (being the majority of the members of parliament) legislating.

Her ejection count(which is like 65 times higher to Labor) is one aspect that shows she is not impartial.  Also she often answers questions directly without requiring the nominated MP to even answer the question directed to them.  She has also held Liberal party functions in the speakers office which also has historically has not been done.
australia,3e0pzm,FreakySpook,12,Tue Jul 21 04:03:38 2015 UTC,"Speakers have traditionally removed themselves from the party room and not been involved in the day to day formulation of government policy or process.  Bishop has remained in the Liberal party room, and is an active participant in discussions and strategy.    She recently appeared on Q&A and was actively defending the government and advocating for its policies and personnel.  You cannot be both an impartial adjudicator and an advocate for one side over the other."
australia,3e0pzm,Not_Stupid,3,Tue Jul 21 05:22:23 2015 UTC,"Objectively she is fine. Many conventions around the Speaker role are not encoded in law and have been based on honour and goodwill.  Subjectively, anyone with half a brain can see the unrelenting bias and that she has pissed all over the long-held traditions of the role. I fear that future speakers will now follow her partisan approach, the line has been crossed and the respect for the office reduced. It would take greater integrity than our politicians possess to raise the bar once more."
australia,3e0pzm,GunPoison,4,Tue Jul 21 07:50:51 2015 UTC,"Govt MPs directing the chair, Speaker ignoring valid points of order, opposition MPs being named for saying 'Madam Speaker', etc."
australia,3e0pzm,blueandgold11,4,Tue Jul 21 03:55:32 2015 UTC,"In the Westminster tradition the speaker is damn well expected to be impartial, and to behave in a way that everyone in the house can accept as following the rules.  It's a matter of disgrace (one amongst many) that this government hasn't ensured that. Bishop should have been censured or removed for her blatant partiality, within a month or two of being appointed."
australia,3e0pzm,canyouhearme,-13,Tue Jul 21 06:22:25 2015 UTC,"This is hilarious.   /r/Australia's definition of impartial is ""allow the opposition to dictate what the House of Representatives can and cannot do."""
australia,3e0pzm,snuffy69,6,Tue Jul 21 06:36:31 2015 UTC,"Do I take it English is not your first language?  You certainly don't know the Westminster system, or indeed the role of the chair in any similar committee structure. Bias in the chair is an unacceptable failing - it means they can't do their jobs."
australia,3e0pzm,canyouhearme,2,Tue Jul 21 07:12:57 2015 UTC,But isn't the case in Britain that the speaker ensure impartiality by resigning from their party?  In fact as I understand it only Australia has such a problematic Speakers position.
australia,3e0pzm,N3bu89,2,Tue Jul 21 05:13:50 2015 UTC,The UK is the only parliament with that convention. And it is relatively recent.   All other countries that follow the Westminster system do it like Australia.

australia,3e0pzm,Kl3rik,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:10:44 2015 UTC,"The speaker role extends beyond chairing the House as it's sitting, and there are multiple deputy speakers.  The Speaker represents the House and/or the Parliament, and along with the Senate President, acts as the 'minister' in charge of the Department of Parliamentary Services (ie. managing APH, the Parliamentary Library, Hansard, etc.)."
australia,3e0pzm,rmeredit,5,Tue Jul 21 02:41:57 2015 UTC,The Speaker still votes when there's a tied result.  Having an appointed member would mean passage of legislation could be decided by someone who wasn't democratically elected.  The way around that would be to amend voting procedures (possibly basing it off a convention like Speaker Denison's Rule: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_Denison%27s_rule).  There's also the issue that because the Speaker can technically influence the balance of parliament (by ejecting members) that it would be undemocratic for the role to be held by someone appointed by someone other than the people.

australia,3e0pzm,xdressed2killx,17,Tue Jul 21 07:16:37 2015 UTC,"It can't be changed without a referendum. The Constitution requires the House of Representatives to elect a speaker from amongst their members. This always means that the party in power will essentially appoint the speaker. There is the added problem that under this system an electorate would be stripped of their local representative.  The only solution is to make it an administrative appointment that requires the approval of both Houses. That would require a referendum though, and there's Buckley's chance of that happening any time soon."
australia,3e0pzm,puresteel,5,Tue Jul 21 02:23:16 2015 UTC,I think a system whereby the appointment of the speaker requires the approval of the senate is ill advised.   The House of Representatives should control its own affairs. The senate can control its.   The two should be kept separate (aside from the exceedingly rare joint sitting).
australia,3e0pzm,snuffy69,2,Tue Jul 21 02:39:28 2015 UTC,So what is the alternative? Clearly the current situation isn't working. Judicial appointment?
australia,3e0pzm,madcuntmcgee,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:28:22 2015 UTC,"An appointment by a two-thirds majority of the House seems fitting. The nominees could be selected by the government, perhaps, so (even though the nominees would have to be apolitical) the government would still retain some power."
australia,3e0pzm,haremm,5,Tue Jul 21 09:37:13 2015 UTC,Wouldn't a good solution to stopping any partisanry or party politics the Speaker could bring with them into the position be to have it so that the Speaker leaves their party and becomes a Independent once they begin their duties?
australia,3e0pzm,flipdark95,8,Tue Jul 21 03:48:54 2015 UTC,"that is essentially what happens in the british parliament. the speaker severs all ties with the party, even into their post-political life.   the trade off is an unofficial convention that allows them to run for re-election unopposed, since it would break this concept of being non-partisan to go out and campaign.  seems to work alright for them"
australia,3e0pzm,donkeybiscuit,2,Tue Jul 21 05:17:54 2015 UTC,"That's really interesting. Though if the speaker is a bad local member, does that mean their constituents are screwed until they retire?"
australia,3e0pzm,MJGee,2,Tue Jul 21 07:38:08 2015 UTC,"I think that has two issues:  If we adopt your rule, the speaker may be ""technically"" not a member of a party, but this doesn't prevent them from acting like they are. They joined that party because the ideology suited them, so they will still have a matching ideology.  Also, your rule forces someone to quit from a party, and surely we should never have laws that stop people from being part of the party they like?  So your rule will have no effect, and has a whiff of over-controlling to it."
australia,3e0pzm,Salindurthas,3,Tue Jul 21 04:41:11 2015 UTC,"If we adopt your rule, the speaker may be ""technically"" not a member of a party, but this doesn't prevent them from acting like they are. They joined that party because the ideology suited them, so they will still have a matching ideology.   The Speaker's role is meant to be impartial and above the party politics, becoming a Independent (or something similarly unique to the role of Speaker) is a much needed symbolic gesture to the neutrality of the position. We don't need a Speaker from Labor or Liberal, we need a Speaker who is independent of the parties and is encouraged to hold a balanced and objective viewpoint on their roles. And being in that position should naturally teach them to balance their ideology.  I don't really see the rule as being that over-controlling because it only affects politicians who choose or are recommended by their fellows to the position. And even then, I never said it stops them from rejoining the party after they've served their time as Speaker."
australia,3e0pzm,flipdark95,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:04:33 2015 UTC,"Well it might be a nice symbolic gesture, practically it doesn't actually change anything.    A politician needn't act independent just because the law ejects them from their current party.  I'm not saying the current system is good or fair, but I just don't think your suggestion helps.   I don't really see the rule as being that over-controlling because it only affects politicians who choose or are recommended by their fellows to the position.   It just seems to me that people ought to have an unconditional right to be a part of whatever political party they want. Perhaps I am too idealistic here and such a right needn't be enforced so strongly."
australia,3e0pzm,Salindurthas,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:22:17 2015 UTC,"I can see that, I only really see this as needed because of the current state of the Speaker's role in our politics. It has gotten so unbelievably onesided with Bronwyn Bishop that I think it'd be best to just make the Speaker a completely separate position that doesn't affiliate with any parties to bring the position back to a impartial role.  I'm definitely a believer in people choosing whatever party they want to be part of, and I don't want that to go away. I just think that if you're someone who wants to be Speaker, that one part of that role includes separating yourself from your former party to form a balanced perspective."
australia,3e0pzm,flipdark95,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:40:06 2015 UTC,"one part of that role includes separating yourself from your former party    Perhaps I'm just too cynical, but your rule can only ever force people to say they are separate from the former party.    The speaker could officially leave their party but continue to be biased and partisan despite it. They might even use ""I'm not in a party"" as an excuse or smokescreen to hide how partisan they are.    Now I'm not suggesting brainwashing the speaker to remove all their previously held party-aligned views, but I just think you rule, in practice, wouldn't do anything."

Literally the worst thing that could happen is that you would get a Speaker like Bishop for a term and the natural response would be to replace them at the next election with someone scrupulously fair.    Imagine a parliament with a Don Chip or even a Scott Ludlam as Speaker, legitimately able to 'keep the bastards honest'."

Why people wanted to buy Australian was irrelevant to the report. The health angle looks like a red herring to me (or at most, a temporary issue for people who briefly wanted to avoid Chinese berries)."

That report was produced well before the ""berry scare"" and before it gave the farm lobby the excuse of protecting public health.  The express purpose given by the Government, for the labeling was to protect consumers. That is clearly bullshit, and it is what the general public thought the changes would do, because the whole berry scare 'went away' once the announcement was made.  So, what we have is a government spending money and resources to protect business while pretending to protect consumers."

Actually the most prominent group making suggestions in the report was CHOICE (the consumer group).  Obviously Australian companies want to sell more and think this will help. But doing so by increasing consumer information is well supported by consumer advocacy groups. The new labels are certainly less misleading to consumers.

Hutt St is a seperate entity, you would be hard pressed to find a link between them and a church.   Also the 'profit' you speak of is actually just a large surplus from the hutt street foundation, if you look at those records you will notice that the previous year they had a large amount of money sitting for distribution that wasn't there.   The fact they name it profit is just a symptom of accounting standards, and is never considered profit.   I have been involved in a number of grants, and all of them have required justification of all grant money, perhaps there are some out there that don't, but I would be surprised.   EDIT: tldr; hutt st foundation send money to hutt st centre, the centre receives that and all grants, all money stays within hutt st centre."

They are doing this overseas for housing  and these can be stacked in no time to accommodate these homeless people. I can understand the usual middle class arrogant snob calls ""not in my suburb"" But there are many light industrial areas that could accommodate these container houses and  they would not be bad areas  to live in.

Capitalism gets ragged on, there is still massive inequality between rich and poor in the world, but generally poverty in the world is being reduced, and it has reduced greatly in the last 50 years or so.  Those of us in first world countries have power and riches that Croesus could only have dreamt of, and the average Indian citizen today has far better food security and better access to health care than a 13th C European peasant.  Look at what has happened with China in the last 40 years or so (when they became Communist in name only). China used to be the basket case of the world regarding famines....  I'm no apologist for Capitalism. I'm probably either a social democrat or a democratic socialist....I believe that capitalism is thus far the best method devised for generating wealth in society.

australia,3e0ucj,canberracorrupt,42,Tue Jul 21 13:39:04 2015 UTC,"Because I'm in the mood for a rant - there's a fatal flaw with this whole argument. Chinese investors are not the cause of our bubble, they're a symptom. Sure foreign investors have surged very recently, and yes that has caused prices to rise faster than they already were, but these investors are part of a multi-faceted problem. They are the latest to jump on the bandwagon and they jumped aboard because property was already rising like a 'sure thing', a cash cow, a 'safe' place to park money.  But guess what happens to a commodities economy when no one wants to buy their resources anymore? We've had such a boom in the past. From the 1860s-1890s, the gold rush seemed unstoppable and people from China flooded the country to work and buy houses and to become landlords, often purchasing whole blocks from overseas to cash in on a soaring 'sure thing' market. Cart loads and organised buying tours for Chinese investors were a common sight (yes, really).   Then something changed. Gold spot prices began to plunge due to a global oversupply (sound familiar?). Unemployment rose, wages fell. Our economy had become so dependent on mining and there was nothing to replace it, especially in Victoria (the epicentre of the last housing bubble). Within three years of the gold slowdown, an oversupply in housing became obvious as migration dropped (this is Australia now - our immigration rate, high during the boom, is rapidly declining and far from having an 'undersupply' we'll have a housing glut within a year or so). Suddenly in 1890 we weren't such a good investment after all. Foreign money poured out of Australia faster than it poured in. Property prices crashed spectacularly.  Even if China does have a 'soft landing' during the global economic slowdown we're now seeing, countries like Australia are no longer attractive, 'safe' investments. We have NO industry. Rents are falling or barely keeping pace with inflation, and vacancy rates are at record highs. Wages are stagnant. People are losing jobs. Tony Abbott is PM and his whole budget is based on a fantasy return to boom level growth because fairies also Labor did it. China will invest in USA and newer rising stars. There is no longer fuel for our bubble.  Rant over."
australia,3e0ucj,littlespoon,5,Tue Jul 21 02:26:19 2015 UTC,"nice rant.  further factor, commercial print media, including the ones who published the article, are now dependent on real estate revenue as a last remaining source of income.  filter anything they publish about housing through that prism."
australia,3e0ucj,Happy-Time-Harry,8,Tue Jul 21 03:55:18 2015 UTC,"Well said. People tend to forget that the chinese investors just go to the places that look like they give safe returns. Before us, they all invested in Canada before the government there tightened up their foreign ownership laws. They now invest more in australia and NZ."
australia,3e0ucj,Happy-Time-Harry,3,Tue Jul 21 02:35:32 2015 UTC,"Source on the comments about housing oversupply and rent falling / not keeping up with inflation? Not disagreeing but I like to see data.   Anecdotally, it does seem like rents aren't really going anywhere at the moment. I signed a 6 month lease at the start of last year and haven't heard from my landlord since then either to sign a new lease or raise the rent. They seem happy enough to coast along on current rent and earn the bulk of their investment profit on cap gains. I'm looking around for a new place to rent too and it seems like there's a decent amount on offer and the prices are more reasonable than the last few years. I look at the asking price and think 'eh that sounds about right' rather than 'Fuck they want THAT much?' (might just be that exposure to this market has altered my expectation of what the fair value is)   I know rents are in no way keeping pace with the property market overall and the rental ROI on a purchase is really low, but if it's not even rising at all that's another thing entirely and indicates oversupply."
australia,3e0ucj,quickie,9,Tue Jul 21 04:44:14 2015 UTC,"On oversupply, there have been pretty varied predictions. (And it's useful to note pretty much every bubble burst is preceded by a sudden realisation there's no undersupply and in fact a massive oversupply.)  Some of the more major ones are Gomdman Sachs, drawing from many major economists (oversupply projected by 2017) http://www.afr.com/real-estate/goldman-sachs-tips-housing-surplus-by-2017-20150416-1mm941  ""The new Goldman Sachs report, one of the first to question the population assumptions behind the housing boom, notes that population growth is slowing. By the end of 2017, Australia will have 530,000 fewer people than is estimated by the widely used Australian Bureau of Statistics Series B projections. The birth rate is at a historic low, deaths are at historic highs and net migration is ""falling fast"", so that instead of population growth of 1.7 to 1.8 per cent a year in 2015-17, Toohey estimates the growth will more likely be 1.25 per cent a year.""  They tip a 75k surplus, readjusting their previous projection of a 240,000 home shortfall, with the boom peaking this year before prices decline. They estimate the surplus will get even worse when rates rise (around 2017 is their guess).  BIS Shrapnel (unsurprisingly) paints a rosier picture but still tips an oversupply: http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-07-20/australia-set-for-housing-oversupply-by-2018/6628408  ""The record breaking home building boom that we've been seeing, we see it peaking in 2015 and some key markets are set to move into oversupply,"" said BIS Shrapnel associate director Kim Hawtrey.  On migration: http://www.smh.com.au/business/the-economy/fewer-people-want-to-live-in-australia-in-growth-risk-for-rba-20150714-gicfon.html  On rents: http://www.moneymorning.com.au/20150615/why-australian-property-rental-yield-is-at-a-record-low-cw.html  Country wide average 1.5% rise, the lowest on record, and well below inflation - and this is including Sydney - most capital cities actually saw either flat or falling rents, with the largest slide in Perth of 4.5%. In one year.   For interest: this submission by Lindsay David and Philip Soos (http://blog.australiaboomtobust.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/LF-Economics-Submission.pdf), who should be taken with a grain of salt because they're arguably very firmly in the bubble camp, is great reading. Their data is from the ABS and their analysis pretty solid. They argue we already have an oversupply of 165000 dwellings. Victoria they suggest has the biggest oversupply, which already exceeds 3 years worth of surplus AND they calculated this before the fall in migration was as widely known.  One thing to note is it's somewhat difficult to demonstrate oversupply because there have only recently been models developed, probably because most were just operating under the assumption an undersupply existed - the only real evidence of which came from rising prices.   Also on the subject of oversupply, China has a much bigger one. In Shanghai buyers are paying up to 20 times annual incomes. There's a strong argument China is in the middle of a 'triple bubble' http://www.businessinsider.com.au/china-is-in-the-midst-of-a-triple-bubble-2015-7 and the truly scary thing is they widely manipulate their markets so it's so goddam hard to really know. The current PM of China was sprung (by wikileaks) telling the US Ambassador China's GDP data was all doctored, which isn't surprising - what other country magically hits their projected growth target every time?  Credit Suisse agrees with the triple bubble and thinks we're all fucked.  http://news.forexlive.com/!/credit-suisse-says-chinas-triple-bubble-the-single-biggest-risk-to-the-global-economy-20150717   China's private sector debt-to-GDP stands at 196% (despite all the talk of China's household 'savings') 40% above its long-term trend More extended than the US at the peak of its credit bubble ""Historically, a financial crisis has been preceded by credit being more than 10 per cent above trend"" Also, the investment share of GDP in China was higher than any other country in history China is in the middle of a transition from investment to consumption-led growth, which historically leads to a halving of the growth rate ""China has consumed more cement in the past three years than the US did in the entire 20th century"" China has a ""clear cut"" housing bubble Real estate as a share of GDP at about 23% is triple that of the US at its peak Housing inventories in its third- and fourth-tier cities holding the equivalent of five years' demand ""Our concern is that a triple bubble in housing, credit and investment comes with the significant risk of a hard landing""   Bet you're sorry you asked."

Goldman Sachs' proxy for net migration predicting just 160,000 extra people in 2014, which is 40,000 below the official figure for the first nine months.   I don't understand this paragraph from the Goldman Sachs article at all. Is a prediction fact?   I also find it odd that they seem to calculate future demand based solely on population growth and immigration while completely ignoring an entire generation that are still living with their parents or sharing a house with three or more others."

Rich Chinese (oh and greedy motherfuckers with no moral compass) who really don't give a shit if they waste a mil extra on a property. They reap it back with by paying less tax and getting their money out of china. If you invest in housing you should be a citizen full stop.
australia,3e0ucj,loklanc,11,Tue Jul 21 02:33:19 2015 UTC,"If you invest in housing you should be a citizen full stop.   Yep. I can't buy a property in China. They can buy here though.  The reality is there are more than a billion Chinese in the world. As small of a fraction with money that want to leave China, will be able to buy up as much property as they feel like."

Population of Melbourne: 4.24 million.  Population of Brisbane: 2.18 million.  Population of Perth: 1.89 million.  1% of 1.37 billion is 13.7 million.

australia,3e0ucj,littlespoon,13,Tue Jul 21 04:35:33 2015 UTC,"China's riches are debatable, because their economy is probably less stable than it appears. I do agree you should be a citizen to invest in housing, but there's something else that's changed in the last ten years. In the face of severe global economic instability, we lucked out and enjoyed a huge 'once in a hundred years' mining boom. For many reasons, this in coming to an end, and now Australia's economy is stagnating and is no longer an attractive place to park money. Other countries whose economies went into recession are recovering. Countries like China and India have mined their own coal and ore to glut levels. In a fulfillment of Tony Abbott's worst nightmares, many countries (China included) are trying to shift away from fossil fuels to renewables. Other countries, like Brazil, have established large mining competitors. Coal and ore are back to being worthless rocks in the ground. If you had millions to invest, would you pick Australia, or somewhere looking a little more favourable economically? Chinese investors are depending on capital gains to cash out - these can only happen if people can afford property, because property is only worth what people are willing to pay for it. Without capital gains, investments rely on rents - and rental yields are already at record lows. The Chinese investors buying now are the same sorts of idiots who just saw the Shanghai composite surge 150% and bought when it was up 145%, then lost all their money."
australia,3e0ucj,asscopter,8,Tue Jul 21 02:47:52 2015 UTC,"As someone who thinks our housing is a complete disaster...  China's economy may actually be more stable than it appears too. China is also so big sometimes it may be more effective to model it as several economies instead of one and it is shown that how recently there was a recession in Shenzhen but not other parts of china. You wont here that level of detail in the west though...   It is also heavily production based. That means if there is a crash in the world, china will be the last to go because their income source does not come from bubbles so much so as it comes from manufacturing. It means they have a solid source of income, and they only go under if other economies are going under and not providing demand for goods and services. However for us, our economy is based on growth weather it be housing or iron ore used to build more housing(..from growth in china..). An economy dependent on growth is an order of magnitude more unstable than one that is dependent on producing every day goods and services as it will only take low growth there for us to go negative.  So while china's economy is hugely diversified our economy now is more closely matched to those in the middle east or that of a developing country. When we shifted over to a service economy, we drank the wrong milk shake. Instead of moving up the production chain like the US,Japan or Germany, we moved down. Interestingly we were never very far up the chain to begin with so moving to a service economy was always going to be dangerous.  Now the effects and costs of it have been hidden for some years by the mining boom bringing in money but I think they are starting to show in terms of that we keep having to reduce government services because we cant afford them anymore(both labor and liberal have been doing so for years). Our reduced incomes also show in that now many average people cant even afford housing(think of our income in terms of housing instead of electronic toys and tvs that have been made cheap by technology advances in mass production).  Interestingly if you look at the Chinese stock market, as compared to western countries its actually a very small percentage of their GDP. The entire Chinese stock market could tank, and as noted by popular economist it would not have much effect on their economy because their economy is driven by manufacturing and not money from the stock market unlike the west. Their bail outs were more to save face because the government their had been using it as a yard stick to say ""look how good we are"".  I would say the biggest risk china carries is the lack of transparency and corruption due to their one party system meaning they have no backup plan when things go wrong or a way to mitigate intrenched corruption. For us when things go wrong we can actually change government without a bloody revolution but they cant, for them its all or nothing.  Other things to consider..  In terms of investment even if only 1% of china invests in Australia its still a population of investors comparable to our entire population. Even if we have a big crash many of them will still buy here because ""bargain"". Unfortunately it may take a very big hit to Australias reputation to make them risk averse. Personally that hit may happen and i would not mind if it did but I am less confident than you. At the moment the thing I think may trigger that is the collapse of iron ore and coal leading to a retail and banking collapse along with immigration tanking due to lack of work.  Possibly giving us an melt down similar to what Argentina/iceland previously had. Its certainly on the cards but its always hard to say if other things like real estate investment from china will compensate for it as to prevent the instability."

It is also heavily production based. That means if there is a crash in the world, china will be the last to go because their income source does not come from bubbles so much so as it comes from manufacturing.   Its GDP is what, 20% housing? And then there's SOEs.   It means they have a solid source of income, and they only go under if other economies are going under and not providing demand for goods and services.   Manufacturers in China havea solid source of revenue. If domestic demand dives, they have overcapacity, and the manufacturers will bid each other down (while the cost of inputs - things like Taiwanese-made iDevice parts - stay expensive). And since import laws favor domestic products, the bloodletting could be severe.  They could be worse off, but they wouldn't be the first manufacturing-based country to hit a wall. Remember Japan?  Of course, a major economic meltdown in China means slower growth, not negative growth.   However for us, our economy is based on growth weather it be housing or iron ore used to build more housing(..from growth in china..). An economy dependent on growth is an order of magnitude more unstable than one that is dependent on producing every day goods and services as it will only take low growth there for us to go negative.   Fuck yeah. If demand for commodities falls, then we're in an even worse spot. Nobody cares where the coal or ore comes from, as long as it's cheap, so the buyers will just keep asking for discounts until the excess mines go bankrupt.   So while china's economy is hugely diversified our economy now is more closely matched to those in the middle east or that of a developing country.

Yeah, it's because we have CREATIVITY and LEADERSHIP skills, unlike those inscrutable orientals. It's the white man's job to manage, not do. At least that's the impression I got from people explaining how Australia will stay competitive. (Not saying the attitude was racist, per say, more like an upper-class twat with absolutely no self awareness).

Their bail outs were more to save face because the government their had been using it as a yard stick to say ""look how good we are"".   Or Chinese businessmen were opening companies with a loan, faking sales, then using their soaring stock as collateral for more loans that they could use to fake more sales (so the virtuous cycle continued, as they lined their pockets). And the retail investors were betting their houses with margin loans.  And once people started worrying about loans, there was the small issue of the state-owned enterprises, local government loans, etc - which are all pretty worrying.   I would say the biggest risk china carries is the lack of transparency and corruption due to their one party system meaning they have no backup plan when things go wrong or a way to mitigate intrenched corruption. For us when things go wrong we can actually change government without a bloody revolution but they cant, for them its all or nothing.   Yeah, we come to the same conclusion in the end. I think there is some chance of things spreading. But the Chinese government knows better, and they'll bail things out - especially if their family members are up to their necks in it.  Problem is, that's what happened in Japan. They didn't fix the debt problem, so much as kept too-big-to-fail businesses on life support (partly because of face, corruption, connections, etc). They spent big on stupid vanity infrastructure projects.  Japan also had a median age over 35, low fertility, high saving rates, a manufacturing / real estate based economy, and everyone thought they were oh-so-different .... sound familiar?  Now, China won't fall as fast as Japan. They still have cheap enough labor to eke out a little growth.   Possibly giving us an melt down similar to what Argentina/iceland previously had   Argentina went for 80% GDP / capita of the US to 50%, stayed stable under semi-fascist Peron, then started declining when the right-wing junta (complete with death squads) took over. /r/Australia might call Abbott a fascist, but we're a long way from the political problems Argentina had (which no doubt hurt its economy).   Iceland didn't so much melt down, as had an unsustainable bubble (relatively) gracefully deflate. They're not below trend - they just didn't have it as good as they thought they did.   Yeah, Australia could have the dollar plunge, lowering our GDP (and raising prices of those Chinese imports). We'd recover. We'd just have to realise we aren't such a lucky country. It could be rough though, but no government was able to sterilise the mining boom."

australia,3e0ucj,byroboy,10,Tue Jul 21 02:38:39 2015 UTC,"A lot of countries restrict home ownership to citizens. Other countries, China included, had strict residency laws (e.g. you must live or study in a country for an extended period) in order for those who aren't citizens to buy. At the very least, Australia should introduce some restrictions. The trouble with allowing unfettered foreign ownership is exactly the situation we're seeing now - your country's property market becomes like a stock market, and risky investments can expose the whole country to external shocks. Keeping ownership limited to citizens means the property market is much less exposed to world financial disasters."

A decades rent on that property would conservatively be ~$250,000, but they didn't want the hassle of tenants.

Foreigners do not want to come here in anywhere near the numbers they once did, because there are no jobs and the economy is stalling. This is one of the main reasons we're projected to have a huge housing glut starting around 2016 if you believe the conservative estimates (if you don't, we already have an oversupply - as evidenced by record low rent yields and high vacancy rates)."

But I'd wager that 'financial migrants' trying to get out, or get their money out of places like China will be on the rise. Not people who want to work, just people who want to retain a whole lot of cash.   dangerously low total fertility rate   There is nothing inherently dangerous about our fertility rate. The reason it's called dangerous is because our economy is being propped up by a continual increase in population. This is obviously not sustainable, but it's been the accepted model for decades. This is why successive governments have pushed immigration so hard (at the expense of the existing population) and crippled infrastructure and transport.   What we need to do is figure out a way of having a sustainable economy without massive population growth.  I agree with you about the housing glut and the pain we're going to be in in the next few years (although frankly we deserve it and it's going to be another ""recession we had to have""). The critical thing is though, successive governments have seen this coming and done nothing. They've propped it up with 457 VISAs and other mass immigration plans. Now, outside factors are causing change, the government can't do shit, and we'll all be fucked about twice as hard as we had to, because of short-term greed and political incompetence."
australia,3e0ucj,GimmeSweetSweetKarma,7,Tue Jul 21 03:22:57 2015 UTC,"Your comments have been very good in this thread. Thank you. However, you demonstrate a bit of a natalist bias here:   and this in the face of an already dangerously low total fertility rate    Australia has a TFR of 1.77. That is below replacement level (2.1) but not ‚Äúdangerously low‚Äù. It is above many nations including Spain (1.48), Brazil (1.69), Canada (1.59), Thailand (1.50) and perhaps most interestingly China (1.55).  The developed (and parts of the developing) world is transitioning into a long period of total fertility rates below replacement and even though there is a long delay after going below 2.1, some nations are already declining in population. However Australia is still a long way from doing so. But many people will welcome it when that date arrives.  Source for quoted TFRs: List of sovereign states and dependent territories by fertility rate (2014 figures)"
australia,3e0ucj,Yossarian4PM,3,Tue Jul 21 04:06:55 2015 UTC,"It comes from having majored in geography I suppose. Our TFR of 1.77 isn't a total disaster, but there are degrees of 'dangerous'. Our TFR is a worry because it's likely to drop, and rapidly, and if it drops far below 1.6 while our population is already aging, we're likely to see long term economic stagnation. People do not like having lots of children during hard economic times, so a low TFR can both cause and compound economic woes. It's a complex sort of problem. Japan is a good comparison - they saw a huge economic rise in the 80s, and much of the three decades of economic doldrums that followed had to do with having a very low TFR. Generally speaking, a TFR over 2 is associated with growth, and a TFR well below 2 with declining living standards, if not recession. I acknowledge the limits of this argument, because TFR is only part of a picture, and a country can raise its TFR (as Costello did by throwing wads of money at parents in the form of FTB and baby bonuses), but for Australia specifically we had 7 taxpayers to each retired person just two generations ago. In another generation we will have less than 2. In population terms, that's bad, because old people are very expensive.   On China - their TFR is interesting. There a very, very strong argument China's current economic struggles are the beginning of a broader crisis they've unintentionally set themselves up for by manipulating the birth rate with the one child policy. China's TFR is probably a bigger problem than it sounds because China's policies have also engineered a huge gender imbalance - people who have one child usually want a boy because a penis earns you more money in the long run and boys are supposed to look after their aging parents. Fewer women means marriages and fewer babies. China's elderly population is going to increase by 60% in the next five years alone, as their working population decreases by 35% in the next decade or so. This is a fucking HUGE issue - and it can't be fixed in the short term, because those who will fill out China's working population to 2030 have already been born. China may well need to raise their own immigration and encourage hordes of people to move to their country to compensate when that crisis deepens, and who knows, in another 50 years they might be whingeing about cashed up Australians buying their houses (but probably not)."
australia,3e0ucj,GimmeSweetSweetKarma,5,Tue Jul 21 04:33:00 2015 UTC,"You're not the only one to have studied geography and demography in this thread and just politely, I think you may have been somewhat indoctrinated.   and much of the three decades of economic doldrums that followed had to do with having a very low TFR   Just flatly no.   Generally speaking, a TFR over 2 is associated with growth, and a TFR well below 2 with declining living standards, if not recession.   Yes, Japan has been in recession a number of times since their late 80s bubble burst but their GDP per capita has actually risen (quite a bit) over that period of time.   they've unintentionally set themselves up for by manipulating the birth rate with the one child policy   We're on contested ground here. The accepted wisdom is yes, that China lowered its fertility rates through the One Child Policy but the actual data doesn't support the assertion. China's fertility rates were already steeply declining before it was introduced. The contrasting example of Thailand is very illustrative. It had similar fertility rates to China at the same period of time and its decline in fertility rates over the same period actually mirrored China and actually fell lower without the imposition of a One Child Policy. There are places on the web where you can map the fertility curves of the two nations over that period; it is very instructive to look at.  However, you are correct that China will soon be moving out of the time when it has enjoyed a ‚Äúdemographic dividend‚Äù. That hasn't happened quite yet but yes it is fast approaching. China's fertility rate has declined much faster than Japan and that was indeed why I referred to it as interesting; but so too has Thailand, as I already said, and even faster has been the decline in Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.  You mention immigration to China and the gender imbalance there. Actually, there is already quite a big phenomenon of Chinese men looking abroad for wives, particularly from Vietnam, Cambodia, etc. That is probably going to continue but I think they will find it increasingly hard to entice them to move. And that, soon, will be the broad picture everywhere - very few  emigrant populations to feed into immigration sinks. At least, emigrants who are attractive to the immigrant countries...  Demography is a slow moving field, but an intensely fascinating one. The play-out of demographic trends we will see through this century is going to be absolutely fascinating. But it's good to think somewhat independently about it and not just accept received wisdom because there are lots of agendas out there that are promoted through various ideologically influenced demographic arguments."

australia,3e0ucj,MissAnneThrop,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:12:46 2015 UTC,"Yes, but it all depends on what is available at the price point you are willing/able to pay. If you want affordable large properties, move out of the inner city area. There is a limited amount of housing available in the inner city so of course the price will be higher.  It kinda is outrageous saying you want affordable, large housing in high demand areas. It's like saying you want a new, high-performance Ferrari but only want to pay the price of a Cammery."

Syd and Melbs are being thrown under a bus to prevent the ""investor"" scum from getting their just desserts.   Other towns probably also feel left out of the ""in"" crowd in Syd and Melbs, hence schadenfraude."

Mind you, expecting businesses to pay their tax burdens is hardly unique to reaganomics.  Why, socialists, the ALP, the Greens, the Democrats and the left across the west also expect businesses to pay their taxes too.  I doubt you'll find many government or government-seeking parties that are content for businesses to not pay any tax, ever, even if by law they are supposed to.  Anarchists maybe..."

The gst should go up to 15% and should be on every single bloody thing. The medicare levy should rise to 3%. Loop holes for businesses getting out of paying tax need to be closed.  If that means no tax returns at all then so be it.    Why?  Because the world is changing.  We are moving from a wage based economy to a world whereby the economy will  need to be based on a supplied income such as a basic income  due to the massive amounts of jobs that will be lost in the next 30 years due to automation of both knowledge industries,  computer industries,  and traditional manual industries.

If it wasn't cost effective for a business to have self service areas, they simply wouldn't have them. They certainly wouldn't have ever been expanded beyond a pilot program.  The reality is that self service checkouts save the business money and this actually means your friend pays less than he otherwise would if the business had to also pay the additional labour costs of two-three extra checkout operators in lieu of a bank of self serve checkouts to accommodate luddites.

I've lived, breathed, and taught in REMOTE Aboriginal communities.  If you had ever even been to one before, I'd be shocked.  Go to any remote community and every person there with a job requiring an education is white. Why is that? Because these communities have no education. Why dont they have an education? Because the Australian government gives them the dole (which they literally call sit down money in language) which gives them no incentive to work and the cycle continues. This has been changed recently in upper WA and if the locals want money they have to work for it.  Aboriginal communities once provided services for trade when missionaries and the like started going out to see them.    When Aboriginal people tell you that they want no part in white Australia, why should we force them to assimilate?   And this is one of the reasons why. One of the communities I went to the locals enjoyed western flour because it was a lot fucking easier to make damper with than grinding seeds. They started a trade of animal skins for flour and so westernisation began.  Again, if you had ever fucking been to one of those communities you would know that they rely on western foodstuffs much more than their traditional foods and that they have no fucking choice but to accept the rest of westernisation (including capitalism) to continue this.

And yes, I think we're getting close to seeing this Jabberwock slain :)  The last half of this year is going to be very interesting politically I think. The national and global (economic and political) climate is changing very rapidly, and Abbott has backed the wrong horse in nearly every race. The economic downturn already showing up in Australia is rapidly exposing how badly Abbott has managed the transition from the mining boom (because he has foolishly and very expensively tried to extend it, by throwing our money at miners and by doing every thing possible to road-block the move to renewable energy away from coal). On climate change he's obviously way out on the loony right and increasingly isolated internationally. Australia is going to receive a lot of bad press at the end of the year in the lead-up to and during the Paris conference. Ordinary Australians do pay attention to Australia's global image. The political friends he's backed have shown a tendency to self-combust (Campbell Newman, Bronwyn Bishop etc). Pressure to give Australians marriage equality is mounting and his hard right backers are going to go absolutely mental if the legislation gets passed. Lots already going wrong and the promise of much more to come.  Of course, some of this incoming pain for the Liberal party could be somewhat ameliorated if they changed leaders..."

australia,3e05mo,pinkocommiecunt82,5,Tue Jul 21 00:07:14 2015 UTC,"But that's based on 2PP. What happens if the Greens polling turns out to be accurate and they win a bunch of seats? They won't win LNP seats, they'll be Labor seats. The Greens, while certainly not a major, are shaping up to be more than a minor party at the next election and they are more of a threat to the ALP than the LNP."
australia,3e05mo,Not_Stupid,33,Tue Jul 21 00:19:04 2015 UTC,"2PP is what decides elections.  Even assuming the Greens pick up a couple of seats, there's no way they're supporting an Abbott government."
australia,3e05mo,pinkocommiecunt82,3,Tue Jul 21 00:49:22 2015 UTC,"Traditionally, yes, and it might do so this time as well. My point is that if the Greens could wrangle half a dozen seats (which I know is massive, but don't underestimate voter satisfaction in the two majors), then the idea of an easy ALP victory suddenly isn't so certain. I can't see them supporting an Abbott government but I can't see the Greens supporting a Shorten government, either. I'm not trying to say the sky is falling, but I think the territory we're in means we should be wary of relying solely on our traditional methods of predicting elections.  Either that, or I'm just projecting my disgust with the current state of federal politics all over the place..."
australia,3e05mo,mossmaal,10,Tue Jul 21 00:58:10 2015 UTC,"You're analysis is unrealistic because you haven't considered where the swing is and what seats the Greens could take.  You've got to look at the required swing to see if your idea is plausible.  The Greens best chances are inner city labour seats and some nationals seats. With a uniform swing of 6% (to get 53% of 2PP), Labour will have a majority of 6 seats. There just isn't six seats that could fall to the Greens."
australia,3e05mo,Not_Stupid,13,Tue Jul 21 02:15:12 2015 UTC,"With the current state of climate change denial and socially-regressive policy-making coming from the Coalition, there would be a full-scale internal revolt if the Greens sided with the current government.  Labor may be Liberal-lite in a lot of ways, but they are easily the least-worst option when it comes to forming government.  And a Greens-Labor coalition would be infinitely better in my eyes than a straight Labor government.  That said, if Labor obtain a majority in the HoR despite any Greens gains, they will still need Greens support in the Senate.  So it's much the same outcome either way."
australia,3e05mo,Brizven,6,Tue Jul 21 01:06:40 2015 UTC,"I'd be quite disappointed if the Greens entered into a coalition government with Labor. I'd rather them simply provide confidence and supply only (as they and every other independent did in the Gillard minority government), with anything else decided on a case by case basis."
australia,3e05mo,squonge,5,Tue Jul 21 01:30:35 2015 UTC,"I doubt Labor would be much for the idea of relinquishing a couple portfolios to the Greens, anyway."

australia,3e05mo,puresteel,4,Tue Jul 21 02:24:46 2015 UTC,"They would most likely guarantee confidence but not enter into a Coalition. Either way, realistically the Greens are only likely to nab up to one to two additional lower house seats."
australia,3e05mo,Not_Stupid,2,Tue Jul 21 03:12:07 2015 UTC,"Same thing.  It's not a capital C Coalition, but it's still effectively a coalition."
australia,3e05mo,rmeredit,2,Tue Jul 21 03:36:43 2015 UTC,"With a capital C Coalition, you'd get participation in Cabinet, which would be a very different level of influence than simply guaranteeing supply and confidence."
australia,3e05mo,pinkocommiecunt82,3,Tue Jul 21 04:07:40 2015 UTC,"I'd argue that the Greens would have that internal revolt either way because both sides supported metadata, anti-terrorism and asylum seeker policy. Other than that, I agree with you."
australia,3e05mo,Not_Stupid,6,Tue Jul 21 01:14:27 2015 UTC,"It's not perfect, but they have to pick someone.  The three options are; support Labor, support the Coalition, or support no-one and we have another election (and keep having elections until Labor or Liberal get a majority in their own right).  One of those options is clearly superior to the others."
australia,3e05mo,snuffy69,7,Tue Jul 21 01:17:17 2015 UTC,Hmm no that's not how it works. There is no requirement to have another election.   The Governor-General appoints the person with the support of parliament as PM. That person's party may be a minority - it doesn't matter.   There is no mechanism for calling another election simply because no party has a majority.
australia,3e05mo,pinkocommiecunt82,2,Tue Jul 21 01:35:20 2015 UTC,Well I suppose the idea of a Green/ALP government is a damn sight better than second term Tone... Urgh. We'd still have PM Shorten though! It's fucken heartbreaking.
australia,3e05mo,stop_the_broats,2,Tue Jul 21 01:31:32 2015 UTC,"If the Greens won the balance of power in the HoR, do you think they would have the gall to peg their support of a Labor government on a change of leader? Tanya Plibersek is much more Greens friendly than Bill Shorten."

There is a small, but not inconsiderable number of moderate liberal voters who are turned off by the current hardline right direction of the coalition and actually find the Greens preferable to voting for LAB."

australia,3e05mo,suicidal_smrtcar,6,Tue Jul 21 04:27:50 2015 UTC,"I could see the greens going close to winning some seats here in SA, though the Xenephon party is probably pretty likely to pick up a couple of lower house seats.   The Libs are going to be destroyed in South Australia come the next election, the question is whether or not Labour, the greens or Xenephon pick up the seats."
australia,3e05mo,omaca,6,Tue Jul 21 01:06:19 2015 UTC,"I don't think the Greens will win any lower-house seats in SA. They might poll in the high teens in a couple of seats, but that won't be enough.  They'd have to come second in an electorate ahead of one of the big two then win on preferences. You can't really even dream of doing that without a primary vote of at least 25%, and realistically a bit more.  The two seats where they got the best primary vote last time were Mayo with about 14% (ALP 21%, LNP 54%) and Boothby 12% (ALP 31%, LNP 50%). The TPP in Mayo was 63%-37% and in Boothby it was 57%-43%.  Their problem in Mayo is that the LNP had a huge win last time and even if there is a big swing against them they will expect to win easily. In Boothby the margin is more manageable but it is more likely that if it fell it would go to Labor based on primaries.  I believe Xenophon is going after Pyne in Sturt. Pyne is another who had a big win last time and will be tough to shift.  The Greens might poll well in Adelaide but Kate Ellis is popular, only had a small swing against her last time and won comfortably. She's probably going to get a big swing to her next time.  I think the Libs will probably only lose Hindmarsh (which changed hands in 2013) and maybe Boothby. Pyne will hang on in Sturt, whilst Mayo, Barker and Grey are out of reach. Abbott knows this, so he's prepared to sell SA down the river for a loss of 1 to 2 seats maximum."
australia,3e05mo,pinkocommiecunt82,2,Tue Jul 21 01:58:18 2015 UTC,"If by ""more than a minor party"" you're suggesting they win more than the ALP or the Coalition, then you're mistaken.

Abbot is only PM because he was put there as a caretaker opposition leader and the Labor party self destructed giving him a chance the be PM.  Shorten is currently the leader on labor in opposition for the exact same reason. The standard wisdom is you don't get a single term government so why use up a genuine possible PM before they have a genuine chance at the top job? But they did not expect the Abbott gov to be this bad. That said I can't see any viable possible PM in the Labor party either.  The sad fact is, we have a shit crop of politicians in both parties and we only have ourselves to blame. Voter apathy coupled with both sides clawing desperately for the mandatory swinger voting center that is solely motivated by 'Whats in it for me?', 'Who let all these foreigners in?' and 'Which way up do I hold this beer bottle?'.  The downside of mandatory voting is people with no fucking idea whats going on, and no desire to actually find out, get a say in who rules us."
australia,3e05mo,tatty000,2,Tue Jul 21 05:37:49 2015 UTC,Compulsory voting is absolutely terrible for the political culture of Australia. It means the campaign message has to be crafted to appeal to low information voters and that the parties don't have to offer any idealogical differences to get their core votes out.
australia,3e05mo,Mikey-G,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:28:56 2015 UTC,"And I can't see a way for Shorten to be out of the leadership without it being a talking point for Abbot, as most labour leadship nonsense, which would probably be enough to win another election for him.

It doesn't follow they will change their votes. (Also Shorten's base of support is lower than Abbott's - Greens don't have to like him but will still preference Labor.  Abbott is (justifiably) reviled.  Of course we do have the parties primary and 2PP ratings should we want an survey of how people would actually vote.

It, like this meme about Shorten, as it was about Gillard, as it still is about the Coalitions economic skills, etc. is a con job. No ALP leader, no matter how great a communicator, will be given the same silver platter that a Coalition leader has in the media.  http://www.theage.com.au/news/federalelection2007/howard-closing-gap-on-rudd/2007/10/18/1192300954552.html  Shorten can win, he will however need to overcome the rule about never arguing with an idiot as they will drag you down to their level and beat you with experience, and in this case the in-built advantage that the Coalition has in the media."

It was really, heavily about Labor playing a cup and ball game with their leader.   To go from Gillard to Rudd to Shorten to someone else in the span of only five years is just going to rack another shot in the Coalition chamber. Labor either needs to prop up Shorten, hope Greens pull votes from the Coalition, hope Independents do well and are willing to be courted into an alliance, or Shorten needs to completely leave politics (as an excuse for having a change in leadership, rather than having it appear as if Labor is ousting another boss)."

Female politicians in general seem to have a similar level of popularity to their male counterparts, and that popularity is similarly based around perceptions of competence and ability.  I have to admit this is all just my impression; voters decide their votes based on all kinds of factors, some of which are subjective or even subconscious, so the influence of any one particular thing can be hard to measure. By comparison, I think that a candidate's age, race or religious beliefs have a greater effect on votes than gender (again I cannot offer any hard facts, we may just have to disagree)."
australia,3e05mo,Brizven,2,Tue Jul 21 02:19:41 2015 UTC,I've campaigned in marginal seats and yes gender does play a role in changing people's minds.

Right now the best way to increase the Greens influence in government is to take some National seats, like they were trying to do in NSW. If the Greens can do that it would pretty much cement them as someone both parties have to deal with while in power and force both parties to be more progressive, not just splitting off the left wing part of Labor to leave only the right wingers.

australia,3e05mo,rainynight65,6,Tue Jul 21 01:25:01 2015 UTC,I think a big part of Shorten's unpopularity is due to the way Abbott fights opponents.

Nobody looks good if every time they suggest a policy their opponent jumps up and down, calls them names, accuses them of trying to destroy the country, etc. Some opponents fight on ideas and policy, others, like Abbott, get into the personal and aren't above using bipartisan issues such as national security and terrorism in a partisan manner. I actually admire Abbott's ability to go for the jugular, I just wish that he used his powers for good instead of evil.   I think Shorten is stuck a bit between trying to go for the high ground or returning fire.

I am only vocal about this because I do not want the Libs in power for another 3-4 years or more. I really believe Bill is that useless and the ratings prove it. He should be doing better but he is not and I think once the ETS is on their policy agenda, it will get worse because Bill isn't going to be able to articulate why it is NOT A CARBON TAX.

Well, the LNP already has their rhetoric straight on that one. According to what Greg Hunt said on Insiders last weekend, an ETS is always a carbon tax because it puts a price on carbon. They do not see a scenario where an ETS can not be called a carbon tax.  That's the kind of rhetorical standards we are dealing with in this country."

australia,3e05mo,frank_rabbit,2,Tue Jul 21 05:08:31 2015 UTC,"But that's a bit of a contradiction. Labor had a problem back then explaining the ETS because immediately the LNP started their rhetoric about how it's a tax and a 'wrecking ball for the economy'. This is what I meant previously, it's becoming virtually impossible to explain or discuss anything rationally because the moment you try, you get shouted down by the contrarians with exaggerated and sometimes flatout false claims."

I dont think the Libs will have to do much, Labor have shown they do a good job of screwing themselves over.

The Day after election people become sick of others talking about politics and they tune out until the next cycle.  I know this is hard people, The Meta-Data bullshit and Detention isle abuse reporting laws is something we need to remember to continue to hold all other parties to, and when the next party (I'm trying to refrain from specifics, but essentially greens or Labor) comes in, they need to start doing sweeping changes.  We need to stop this popularity bullshit, we know the people forget almost everything they hear, so why does Labor get scared of backing the policy's their members represent? Because the other uneducated half who has an opinion over facts threaten to say they don't like it?  We have been complaining about this government for 3 years, and it still feels like most of the population is complacent with the current situation!  We need to make this Country better. We need to open up trade, put money back into energy renewables and start looking into new methods of generating income and producing trade. We need a new, or still developing specialty that we can do cheaply, and efficiently to sell to the rest of the developing world.  We need to do this soon, or we are going to be looking at a U.S style income gap and population wealth.  That is not the aussie fair go."

He's regarded as one of the chief orchestrators behind The Rudd/Gilard wars, he's not entirely charismatic, his 'right wing faction' is losing internal support and his external policies are not that different from Abbots. He's quietly supported most of the issues that have retained Abbots general approval rating; National Security, refugee turn backs and no carbon tax. To anybody looking from the outside in, he's almost like Abbots shadow.  All while this happens the Labor loyals are increasingly moving across to the Greens who have more traditional policies and seen as more transparent and less corrupt. It would not surprise me at all if Shorten loses the next election, Albanese gets elected as opposition leader and massive policy reforms happen, and next term Abbot is opposed on every overreaching policy he tries to implement."

So they aren't, by definition, suffering any disadvantage under our laws. We moved the goal posts, and they cant even play the damn game.   law being in breach of international treaties and its failure in addressing a range of legal criteria.   Treaties are just that, they aren't binding or enforceable. Enjoy Int. Law, it's the whisper in the wind. All countries use them when convenient, and ignore them when not.    finding it difficult finding the advantages of these tough immigration laws.   Check out the Australian voting public.

The legal system has allowed an off-land processing facility. Couldn't that be a failure in the legal system for disadvantaged groups? Would that not be an area of Law Reform?

Often, they are there to legitimise and enforce discrimination. Laws aren't made by a council of our finest legal and moral minds - they are made by term politicians voted in by the screaming mob.

The answer to this? Increased investment in battery technology, which at this stage is an 'emerging/developing technology' - increasing the efficiency and effectiveness with which batteries operate will reduce the price volatility and this make it I bible generation option, and it will drastically increase the effectiveness of household solar systems by allowing for power generated during the day to be stored for use at night when majority of household power consumption occurs.   Large scale solar plants are the only effective renewable source right now, and as such deserves large scale investments.  Who cares what politicians have said to placate some voters?

Its not an oil tanker its what is called an FPSO or Floating Production Storage and Offloading Facility called MV11. These are basically floating oil refineries that receive oil and refine it to a clean standard for export.

These facilities can disconnect from the well but are permanent fixtures in the field and have a very strict security regime around them. For a vessel like this to even be able to approach MV11 is kind of outrageous. The refuge vessel had to pass through a lot of major shipping fairways, Port Headland Fairway and the Dampier Fairway, the question here is how did it go unseen? The reality is it may have not been noticed, however the other reality is that all the possibly 50 or so merchant ships it had to pass that are exporting have zero Australian representation and choose not to report to maintain there schedule. It gets worse, the police vessel ""Delphinus"" that is attending has been pulled off a search and rescue for three missing fisherman to attend the refuge boat, a tragedy that is unfolding up here with little media reporting. So now we lose a major Search and Rescue asset in an already overstretched response system. We have no national representation on our coast to provide an overwatch and a bunch of people randomly showing up to an offshore oil refinery with a 150 workers on it.

Protest outside parliament for several days straight. Make a YouTube video and put a budget behind it to make sure it gets seen. Go doorknocking next election for the party you want to see in power.

A petition with a 1000 signatures probably didnt change that many people's behaviour, but one with 200,000?  That's a news article worthy.  That a Facebook share worthy.

Not only did the Coalition bluntly dismiss the petition, since the petition they've moved to their ""multi-technology-mix"" which is even further away from the FTTP plan endorsed by the petition. If the petition had any direct effect, it was to encourage the Coalition to double down on their position.

Even now, I can't think of a single policy idea from the party that has grabbed the population. Everything has been ""Labor bad"" and ""kill this Labor thing"". The Paid Parental leave thing was a novel change, but got killed off (sorry if you voted for us over it).  I haven't voted Liberal since Mr. Howard was PM. And I doubt I will any time soon. But I sure want to hear what they have to offer."

I actually believe this wouldn't occur if it wasn't for Reddits voting system.   You know what? I call bullshit on this one. It's this typical kind of 'poor repressed right-wingers' sentiment that I see so often, from accusations of left-wing bias against the ABC (no, it's not accusations of bias, but specifically 'left-wing bias') to whining about being downvoted for offering a sensible right-wing standpoint in this sub.   From my experience, people don't get downvoted in this sub for offering alternative viewpoints or being neutral. They do get downvoted for being contrarian, flatout trolling or simply being unable to debate a topic, instead regurgitating the same things over and over. Not that I generally agree with this approach, but if you're not actually trying to contribute to the debate, what do you expect? Maybe I haven't been in this sub long enough, but I see very diverse debates here, which nullify the assertion that /r/australia is simply an echo chamber.  Myself, I rarely if ever use the voting arrows on reddit (and when I use them, I probably do it wrong anyway). I am more interested in debate than virtual scores.

Mr Burke asked how long her probation would run for and whether it would impact on the Finance department's investigation.   ""Given there is no Parliamentary precedent that I am aware of for the Speaker of the House of Representatives to be placed on probation, I ask that you provide further information to clarify how being on probation will impact on the Speaker's authority over Parliament House and the House,"" he wrote.   He also asked what it would mean for her role when Parliament resumed, whether it changed her entitlement reporting responsibilities and whether it affected her salary."

Labor also just seems to want to pin this on one person rather than reform the system that allows this for both sides of politics.

They work a huge amount and aren't remunerated anywhere close to the private sector - top public servants get up to three times as much as them.

So it seems to be irrelevant then - why have them if they are so harmless and meek and mild.. and why do overseas countries get this special mechanism and not local ones? If they're not there to allow special unaccountable, non-independent, non-case-law governed processes by which a company can extract billions in damages for law changes: then why are they being pushed so much? Mainly because the USA's companies like to use them to protect their profit-at-any-costs.   But take a look at the list of cases where ISDS have been used to sue governments.    The Government has stated clearly that it will not accept an outcome in the TPP which adversely affects the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme or our health system more generally, or an outcome that increases the price of medicines for Australians.   Funny how what the government believes is the case and the reality of privatisation or less regulated markets doesn't tend to intersect much.

Given the willingness of the right wing press to completely set aside the last scraps of journalistic integrity, and the willingness of the Liberals to spend millions of dollars on trumped up court cases, the single easiest way to hurt them is to bleed them dry while letting the public get bored.  Force them to go further and further into the bullshit causing more and more people to stop buying papers.  Do you think newscorp wanted to report on Choppergate?  Hell no! But they need to sell their papers, and too many people are getting tired of the same tired old lines, and therefore they have to jump on the bandwagon or lose readership to more competent and balance competitors.  Likewise, with every lawsuit they have to bring forwards, the purse gets drier for the next ones.  Being inoffensive lets the bad juju from the first budget continue to shadow the Libs, it forces them to stay in the spotlight with no one to attack.  The scariest part of this is that it forces the Libs to attempt to defend policies that are unreasoned, blatantly corrupt and ultimately indefensible.    The questions asked by voters in the next election are going to center on Liberal entitlement abuse, not 'stopping the boats', the core selling point of the Liberal party is being called into question as their economic mismanagement comes to the fore and they're stuck with Joe Hockey sweating his way through interviews about the fact that the debt keeps climbing despite all their promises.

All that's happening is that the government is sub-contracting out the work of running them. This leads to a weird situation where the prison companies are out to make money but don't have to cover the cost of actually enforcing the laws that the prisoners have broken. If prisons were truly private then the companies would have to cover all of the costs of running the prison system (catching offenders, prosecuting them, jailing them) in which case I'd think it'd be highly unlikely that you'd have the sorts of drug laws that we do now purely because of the non-existent return on investment.   Until that point, of course prison companies are going to lobby for tough drug and other similar laws - it's ridiculously easy money for them."

Criminals are less likely to expose themselves to ""the man"" for fear of the consequences, eg loss of job/welfare/etc. Patients can be placed in programs that help them break out of the drug cycle.

In accordance with your contract with Exetel, and as a result of a review of your usage patterns, Exetel will be changing your current broadband bundle plan   Submit the letter to the ACCC/ombudsman, even after you presumably cancel, surely it isn't legal to change the terms of your contract without your consent."
australia,3e123x,r3volts,4,Tue Jul 21 03:50:04 2015 UTC,"The telecommunications ombudsman is key here.    Contact exetel, tell them you are furious at their intentions and ask to speak with conflict resolution. Document the time of call and the content, whether or not you get to conflict resolution etc, get names and positions where possible, and be vigilent with documentation.    Regardless of if you get through to conflict resolution, co tact the ombudsman. They will ask you what you have done to try and resolve the situation and if you are satisfied or not. Whenever I have contacted the ombudsman, the conflict resolution department (both optus and TPG in my cases) have contacted me within a couple of days with a few suggested solutions. Optus was able to offer me $15 less per month for the life of my contract, and with TPG I was able to exit the contract without fee or penalty.    The ombudsman is a fantastic service. I highly suggest OP contacts them, but remember to be vigilent with documentation and remember to keep your cool while dealing directly with the companies."

Over the years I've followed reports of them disconnecting customers (as I mentioned above, it's happened to me as well) and contacting the obudsman seems to correlate pretty well with being disconnected from them a few months later.  They'll never actually state that as the reason, of course, you just get the same ""you're no longer profitable"" notification that everybody else gets. But it definitely seems like they don't like the idea of their customers understanding their rights with respect to the ombudsman service."

Yes there should be limits on spends (nothing too frugal) and oversight on what is claimed, but it should be paid for by the State.  The reason is quite simple. You don't want this to become the norm with taxpayers expecting politicians to self fund official trips because you don't want  to recreate the situation of the past where only the rich were able to represent a country in politics because only they could afford to partake in it. That, or having 'sponsored' trips paid for by companies."

No, he should get into contact with the Police Union, and have them help him. Did he breach the Queensland Police Policy, yes, but for what the public views as the right reasons. The QPS are his employers, and unfortunately it's their decision since he breached the workplace policies he agreed to.  The QPS will have their hands tied mate, they more than likely won't fire him as it will reduce public trust in them, which after the 80's is what the QPS has always been striving to keep.

But are you really under the impression that ALL if not even a majority of QPS officers are, ""Arrogant Pigs?"" I study criminology and policing at Uni... Australia as a whole has one of the least corrupt policing services in the world. Yet here we are on /r/Australia, being downvoted for stating the aforementioned fact -_-"

I'm not a cop hater and mostly am happy with our police forces (especially after dealing with police forces overseas). I am merely pointing out that one can be both good and caring while taking money and partaking in illegal activity all at the same time."
australia,3dxelj,GimmeSweetSweetKarma,11,Tue Jul 21 04:48:12 2015 UTC,Mate we've seen irrefutable evidence that the few 'bad apples' are being protected by all the 'good cops'  Otherwise there wouldn't be any bad apples.

Police also fucked up by shooting a few people but hey don't let the facts get in the way of you narrative. Growing up in Qld I witnessed the pig headed copper attitude all the time. Sexist, racist, arrogant and antagonistic. Every weekend in the Valley you'd see coppers pinning people down and sinking the boot/fists.  I've friends that have had their photos taken by police in small towns in Qld because the cops, ""like to keep tabs on who is in town""... Wtf?!  The force is obviously long overdue for a clean out and it's coppers like our whistleblower who unfortunately are the ones enabling it. I really can't see cultural change happening without it."
australia,3dxelj,Grondle,-5,Mon Jul 20 21:42:37 2015 UTC,Stop being a fucking moron.  You keep calling all cops pigs then you will only ever get what your behaviour warrants. Cunts running around attacking all police officers only helps build that bullshit us vs them mentality.
australia,3dxelj,Grondle,10,Mon Jul 20 23:23:37 2015 UTC,"Eh? I never once wrote that cops are pigs... Let alone that all cops are? And moron? Really? I study electronic engineering mate; am no genius but far from a moron. To be fair, I haven't had any issues at all with Victorian Police (despite their rep of 'shoot first' they have all been professional in my dealings with them). But Qld cops? Totally different  story.  There is a definite culture of arrogance, sexism, racism, antagonism and (to a lesser extent post Fitzgerald Enquiry) corruption.  Older people I've spoken to agree that it was far worse prior. There should be no reason for the police to be beating members of the public, but I have certainly observed that happening in Qld. Growing up in SEQ it was an open secret that the coppers could and would beat you if given half a reason. Not to say they are all bad cops. But I'm talking about a culture within the Qld police force - antagonistic, violent and racist."

australia,3dxkzt,frankenstyne,4,Tue Jul 21 00:57:24 2015 UTC,Upvote for you. The CES worked pretty well compared to this bucket of corrupt shite...daresay its costing the taxpayer more overall too
australia,3dxkzt,Knotknewtooreaddit,29,Tue Jul 21 03:26:50 2015 UTC,"The problem here is that they want the info of your new employer so that they can claim they found you the job. If they had nothing to do with it, then they have no right to claim they found it for you. Therefore, if you found the job yourself, tell them NOTHING. The paperwork you sign with them doesn't state that you have to give them any information if and when you find a job, and if they didn't help you, then their claim to Centrelink saying ""we found x person a job"" is fraudulent.   Slapping a fancy new ""jobactive"" name on the system does nothing for the fact that they simply want to claim money for things they didn't do for you, e.g. saying they found you a job when they did absolutely nothing to help.   Tell Centrelink, sure. They are the ones paying you the allowance. But also tell them that the job agency is pressuring you for information that you don't need to give them, and you suspect they are claiming they helped you find the job when they didn't."

australia,3dxkzt,jhunt0,6,Mon Jul 20 13:24:05 2015 UTC,thanks :) funny thing is that job network has barely any paperwork from me as i'd only had one appointment with them since they spent a month or so moving to new offices so they have less than they otherwise might have had.
australia,3dxkzt,jhunt0,3,Mon Jul 20 13:26:20 2015 UTC,"Fair enough. Just gotta cover bases.   My SO was in your position. He ended up just forfeiting the work credits because he would have had to take more days off than it was worth in missed wages to get them. They still occasionally call years later, after he has moved on two jobs.   Its sad cases like this are not isolated"

After all, if you have a job, why should you need to deal with the employment agency any more? You're entitled to your working credits.  I went to an employment agency years back. Useless as tits on a bull and obviously just about getting paid. I don't see why they should get paid when they didn't get you the job.  Good luck and let us know what happens.

australia,3dxkzt,Kidkrid,4,Mon Jul 20 11:20:09 2015 UTC,no they're not i'm just pretty angry right now however i shall be very nice to centrelink tomorrow. Thanks for the advice on the community law centre.

I'm doing okay making leads and my team leader is pretty happy with me. but yeah i know where you are coming from too i have been in a high pressure sales job and it was pretty horrid.

They get paid for that. Admit nothing and don't contact them.  Go to cenno when you can and explain the situation to them. What you're going through is common and illegal. Make a report and the job agency will suddenly forget you exist."
australia,3dxkzt,baazaa,6,Mon Jul 20 11:15:35 2015 UTC,it's funny because i have a new phone and they don't know the number they literally have no way to get hold of me and there's no way in hell i'd ever let them harass my boss (who is awesome and irish lol) i do want them to get into trouble because i'm pretty sure reporting someone after they give a legit reason for missing an appointment is illegal

They know what they are doing is shit. I guess they aren't fully to blame, because the system is set up this way. Centrelink knows about it but hasn't made any efforts to hold them to account, so nothing will change.  They can't do anything legal to you, and don't take time off to deal with it, not worth it.

Now that the JSA's have all changed, I've got Neato after me.  I got myself a job (with the help of family) and they want me to take time away from a new job I've just started so I can go in and sign some forms.  Well, they can go and get fucked.

We would use the cash incentive as well. We were there to not only try to broker new employment but also foster new employment. The $200 offered is set aside to ensure the new employment will maintain itself (Fuel, uniforms, training ect.) We cant access that without confirmation of employment.   But regardless, they most likely don't care to much about your new job or what not, they just need to meet their KPIs. They appear to be overly aggressive trying to get details. I think most providers will be fairly aggressive at this point with a new contact and all trying to get a high star rating to start off. Still not good enough IMO.  Really though, if you don't provide details not to much will happen, you might just have a hicup with centerlink and the Job network worker will probably get their ass handed to them for not taking a claim"
australia,3dxkzt,doggie015,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:49:06 2015 UTC,"yeah figures, this job network's 'uniforms' come from a charity shop they're associated with, they do not provide work clothes or shoes for your job or travel assistance (i was with them 2 years ago for a few months) the clothes they provided were just for interview, after that you were on your own. I asked about work uniforms 'oh sorry we don't provide things like that you can get them when you get paid.'  Yeah slight hiccup with centrelink which i'm going to get sorted very shortly."

That was also for a job that I had found on my own, they call them found own employment (FOI) we still get a bonus but not anywhere near the amount for if we brokered ourselves, all I did was email my pay evidence fortnightly.

I seriously can't comprehend how these businesses are allowed to exist, they don't even help you to land a job and force you to jump through multiple hoops every week to keep up appearances with Centrelink, and when you yourself make a breakthrough in your life they want to claim all the credit for it.  The last time I was in contact with me previous agency was 2 years ago because I decided to go back into study for full time, when I first made the decision and told them they really didn't want me to, saying it will be a waste of time.  Well 2 years on, I'm making my way into these courses quite well, and haven't had to deal with those fuckwits ever again.   Sure I still haven't landed a job since then, but how in the flying fuck are you mean't to land a decent job in one of the highest unemployed parts of Australia?

Honestly I'm not even sure who's supposed to be keeping them in line, the department of employment (then DEEWR) organised an external audit a while ago because they basically had no way of keeping track of all the fraud. Perhaps the Commonwealth Ombudsman?"

(Yank here)   Victoria is widely regarded (among car enthusiests especially) as one of the worst states to drive in. Simply due to the over-zealous highway patrol and abundance of speed cameras.  Many previous premiers of the state have focused on the issue of ""road safety"" and drummed into a large portion of the public that speed cameras ""save lives"", and that fining people for speeding even 1km/h over the limit is justified and needed (and yes, that does happen)."
australia,3dvrd6,mootmeep,11,Mon Jul 20 02:34:18 2015 UTC,its not that bad if you dont actually speed though.  I havent had a genuine fine in over 10 years of driving.
australia,3dvrd6,notepad20,23,Mon Jul 20 02:47:23 2015 UTC,"Yes, and that's the key. It affects people rarely, so not too much of a fuss is kicked up about it. But the principal is what matters. It's wrong, and shouldn't be occurring.  There are a few factors at play here:    It is simply not possible to stick to the speed limit 100% of the time.  No car has a completely accurate speedometer. Most have a 10% margin of error. Many have needles which take up a 5km/h space on the dial. Most roads in Australia have speed limits which are completely inadequate and set far too low. This causes a lot of problems with drivers as many know that they can safely drive faster than the posted limit, so they do. They then end up tail gating other drivers, or driving at a difference in speed to others. Regardless of whether you think this is right or wrong, it happens, and will continue to happen. It needs to be managed. It's dangerous."
australia,3dvrd6,mootmeep,6,Mon Jul 20 03:49:42 2015 UTC,"There's also the fact that speed limits have been steadily decreasing. And to compound it, often without changing light timings at all. On the drive to my girlfriend's place there are 3 separate stretches that have had their limits recently reduced, and at all of them you need to drive the old limit to make the lights. Doing 10 k's over the limit over about a 2km stretch (all up) saves you 15 minutes, so everyone does it"

australia,3dvrd6,VannaTLC,2,Mon Jul 20 22:58:35 2015 UTC,"How is it not possible to stick to the speed limit? The sign says 40, you slow to 40. It says 100, you go 100.  Theres a fair bit more as well to driving at a safe speed rather than just driving comfortably.  That crest ahead may be shallow and no problem to control a car going over it, but what kind of stopping distance and reaction time do you need to properly respond to an obstruction on the other side of it? 120km/hr is a lot different to 100/kmhr"
australia,3dvrd6,notepad20,7,Mon Jul 20 04:33:54 2015 UTC,"We've thrashed this out in the other comment thread. No speedometer is truly precise, and before 2006 none had to be accurate. How do you know you're actually travelling at the speed it says?  I would say driving comfortably is driving at a safe speed. I'm uncomfortable doing 40km/h up a 110km/h hill. I'm uncomfortable doing 60 when the rest of the traffic is doing 48. I'm not uncomfortable doing 110km/h on an empty freeway, but I am when the traffic is slowed to 60kmh through congestion. Checking for safe driving is the problem - its circumstantial and can't be measured by a computer, unlike speeding tickets.  A road with a crest on it like that is not the kind of road that tends to get attacked with such frequency. The complaints often refer to desert roads with no hills, no curves, no roadside shrubbery for 100s of kms.  The speed limits set, certainly here in SA, are configured to cater to the most woeful of drivers driving vehicles that passed whatever ADRs were in 1950, in any weather condition at any time of day. Certainly some of the deserts roads would be made significantly safer by introducing higher speeds - some of the long straight roads, interrupted only occasionally by wide sweeping curves would be an ideal candidate to increase speed limits to make it a SAFE speed through reducing fatigue, increasing concentration, limiting the number of stupid overtaking manoeuvres (sitting at the speed limit throughout the whole overtaking period, therefore being on the wrong side of the road for minutes at a time) and spending less time on the road at dawn/dusk.  The SA state government recently passed it that when passing an emergency vehicle with lights flashing when parked on the side of the road, you must slow to 25km/h. I have been on the receiving end of this, and stopping 6 ton in a vehicle that only just fits inside the ADRs from 110km/h to 25km/h in order to react to a poorly considered stopping place is beyond dangerous. They don't mandate you travel at 35km/h everywhere (as much as they'd like to) just so you prevent an accident when someone slams on the brakes while cresting a hill to respond to an emergency vehicle."
australia,3dvrd6,BiasedBIOS,6,Mon Jul 20 04:55:25 2015 UTC,"How is it not possible to stick to the speed limit? The sign says 40, you slow to 40.    If you're slowing to 40, you were above 40, and breaking the speed limit. That's how simple it is.  You were watching the road instead of the speedo? Probably dipped above the limit.  You were paying attention to the other cars on the road and went slightly downhill - suddenly above the speed limit.  You were scanning the road for pedestrians? - ooops, again above the speed limit."
australia,3dvrd6,mootmeep,4,Mon Jul 20 04:59:39 2015 UTC,I have had people yell and stop suddenly in front of me after they tailgated for 2km because I was following the speed limit and they wanted to go faster. So I know exactly what you mean when you say that it will happen regardless.
australia,3dvrd6,Jimmy_Black,9,Mon Jul 20 07:03:39 2015 UTC,That's kind of the issue though. It's far easier to enforce some arbitrary number than it is to ascertain if someone was driving safely.   If I drive 20km over the speed limit in a school zone at 3pm I'm treated just the same as if I drive 20km over the speed limit on an empty country road at 2am.
australia,3dvrd6,Nibbles1,2,Mon Jul 20 04:51:10 2015 UTC,"It genuinely is easy to speed in Melbourne. In Melbourne, there are now over 1,000 roads that are 40 zones. They're usually not well sign-posted. For example, most of Collingwood is now a 40 zone,  and the speed sign is at the start of the area. All the side-streets inside that zone? No signs. The same goes for several other suburbs (I picked Collingwood, as you've probably heard of it even if you aren't from Melbourne).  Imagine a border around a suburb. Ok, we'll put signs at the border declaring that you are entering a ""40 area"", but no sign at the other end to say you're out of the area again. Main artery through the suburb (For Collingwood, that'd be Wellington St)? 40 zone. Police love it.  They also keep changing speed limits - and there's no pattern I can see to understand why. Some are easy: This road is 40 between 7am and midnight, but 60 other times. But then there are other tricks: Sydney Road used to be like this, then they just changed it to be 40 all the time about a month ago and didn't do any announcements to tell people or even change the signs. They just put white stickers over the bit that sad 7am-midnight. So, all the locals who are used to seeing the 40 signs, but don't really pay close attention to them, ignore them thinking it's 60 out of hours. And guess what? Those white stickers? They look black under headlights at night. Like, the writing that was always there, or maybe some graffiti or something.  Doing 46 in a 40 zone? You dangerous hoon! $285 and a point!  Australia in general is pretty confusing with speed zones. New Zealand has 60/80/100 or something. It's always pretty obvious what the limit is, even if you've missed the speed sign. We have 40/50/60/70/80/90/100 all over the place. And it's not always obvious what the limit should be."
australia,3dvrd6,Nth-Degree,5,Mon Jul 20 06:36:34 2015 UTC,"Practically all residential streets in NZ are 50km/h. 60 and 80 zones must be on roads designed to handle faster traffic. In automobile accidents, there is a rule of thumb called the 50/50 rule. Collide with an immovable object at 50km/h in a modern passenger car, and the front seat occupants have a 50% chance of death or life changing injury. Roads that permit higher speeds must provide a buffer between traffic and lamp posts/roadside cabinets, and 80km/h urban roads must have a median strip.  Now that road designers are having to consider other modes, 40km/h will be the new norm for urban streets. There is a dramatically lower chance of pedestrian injury at 40km/h."
australia,3dvrd6,nicbrown,4,Mon Jul 20 07:24:41 2015 UTC,"Why has it become acceptable to book you for doing a speedo-indicated 100km/h when you're travelling at 110km/h? Its legal for the speedometer to read lower than the road speed in many vehicles, so why is it acceptable for someone to be booked based on the information fed to them by the ADR-approved vehicle? Surely it is beyond the point of reasonableness to expect people to fit other speed gauges, when the government themselves decided that the 10% gauge is good enough?"
australia,3dvrd6,BiasedBIOS,2,Mon Jul 20 03:15:45 2015 UTC,"ADRs are used to determine if a vehicle is suitable for sale. Modifications (or deteriorations) that occur after sale are in a significantly grey-er area. Therefore, your speedo is unreliable in the eyes of the law and the only thing that matters is the actual vehicle speed, as measured by law enforcement.  The principle being applied is that you are responsible for your vehicle's speed, not your perception of its speed, and it is ""reasonable"" that you will be concerned enough about the road rules to figure out if you're breaking them, or at least be satisfied that you're not likely breaking them. If the margin of uncertainty in your speedo is a risk you can't live with, it's your responsibility to reduce your speed until you're certain.  I'm not saying the rules themselves are good, and they're certainly abused for raising revenue, but the principle of absolute driver responsibility is a good thing."

One of my cars sits 100% dead on for most speeds, reads 102km/h at a road speed of 100km/h.  Another one reads 58km/h at a road speed of 60km/h and has an even higher under-reading at road speed 100km/h of 95km/h.

Instead of cameras we've got cops who hide behind buildings or trees, which isn't as bad because unlike cameras, they're not always there.  Some areas have stoplight cameras and there are other areas we are warned to watch for cops at, but that's the extent of it really. That's just Indiana though, I hear in some places it's stricter but never anything like Victoria."

Vaccinations don't work on 100% of people, and some vaccinations don't kick in fully until the child is older (such as whooping cough which I think takes until at least 6 months old but is potential fatal if contracted earlier than that). So as a community the aim is to protect those vulnerable to these horrible and preventable diseases via herd immunity."

Add to that confirmation bias (if you google vaccines are bad then you'll find plenty of blogs telling you that you are right) and you have a recipe for a community to lose herd immunity.   It's referred to as the 'free rider problem' as you benefit from herd immunity but don't contribute to it.  From a policy perspective I think that governments must put the community ahead of individuals, and in terms of vaccinations its very clear that the community benefits far greater from having a strongly vaccinated population than if we didn't.  My understanding (at least in NSW) is that its still optional for you not to vaccinate your child but that its encouraged in ways of financial incentives, and I'm pretty sure that many child care centres will only let you enrol your kids if they are vaccinated.    without the pressure of losing payments and dealing with pitch fork mobs   Do you have any other suggestions for ensuring high rates of immunisations?

australia,3dvrd6,verifiedpain,0,Mon Jul 20 02:07:06 2015 UTC,"Research doesn't produce facts; it empirically illustrates a correlation between two or more events. Facts don't exist, and shouldn't, everything (especially governments) should be questioned."
australia,3dvrd6,Ozbiker4x4,4,Mon Jul 20 07:42:27 2015 UTC,"I don't like the concept of the care of babies essentially being taken away from parents and placed in government ""research"".   Where do you claim this happened?   having said that, I probably will vaccinate my child when he or she arrives in December, but i think it should be mine and my wifes choice, without the pressure of losing payments and dealing with pitch fork mobs.   IMO, if you endanger other people in society, you should, at the very least, lose taxpayer funded benefits. I'd like to see you charged with reckless endangerment."
australia,3dvrd6,ActuallyNot,3,Mon Jul 20 02:02:47 2015 UTC,"It's unfair that you're being downvoted for simply voicing your opinion. People in this sub need to stop being dicks and actually start a discussion with people they disagree with.  So, in consideration of that, I'll try and break down how I understand the situation:  In msot cases, decisions regarding children are left in the hands of the parents, however, the case of vaccination is a special one, as it doesn't only affect your child, but all children in the community due to group immunity. The choice to not vaccinate your child puts the entire community at risk, other people who don't have a choice in the matter are being negatively affected (their child is being put at risk because of your decision). That's why there's been some government intervention.  Generally I believe that we should all be able to do what we want - so long as we don't harm others - a very libertarian approach. But vaccination isn't one of those cases. It does affect others and can harm others if it isn't carried out.  Because of that, I understnad the argument and support it."
australia,3dvrd6,mootmeep,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:38:37 2015 UTC,"I understand the concept of group immunity. But I don't believe I should force my child to jab for the betterment of the ""group"" If I am concerned of the health impact that this may have on my child."
australia,3dvrd6,farqueue2,2,Mon Jul 20 05:00:02 2015 UTC,"Of course, but we live in a society and make sacrifices everyday for the benefits society gives us.  We give up some freedoms as a trade for the benefits. Most of these trades are obvious and people generally don't have an issue with them. Like for instance, we've agreed that it's illegal for people to not wear a seatbelt - why? It harms no one but themselves if they crash? - Ah, but most people join the dots and say, well yeah, BUT, it does harm in other ways, it would cause immense cost to the health industry if people stopped wearing their seatbelts, minor prangs would be serious accidents possibly requiring ambulances, clogging up health services unnecessarily. Plus the toll of the gruesome scene paramedics and police would have to deal with on a much more frequent basis.  So, we give up some freedom in that case.  Similar with vaccines, we make it mandatory for all children to be vaccinated. The problem is that it's a little harder to see the wider benefits. In reality, you're benefiting yourself and your children by creating a healthier (and cheaper) society to live in, but it's such a long term thing it's harder to conceptualize.  Take for example whooping cough making a comeback in communities that have low rates of vaccination. Or there's this article in Time - 4 Diseases Making a Comeback Thanks to Anti-Vaxxers"

australia,3dvsqv,Paiste402,8,Mon Jul 20 09:20:40 2015 UTC,"""Oh dear, what are they trying to hide...  Tony Abbott Doorstop: Peter Slipper MP   21/04/12 EO&E..............................................................................................................................................................  TONY ABBOTT:  The Speaker is the guardian of parliamentary standards. The Speakership is one of the most important offices in the Parliament. The Speaker is there to uphold the integrity of the Parliament and now we have very, very serious allegations against the incumbent Speaker, allegations of sexual harassment and allegations of potentially criminal misuse of entitlements. These are very serious allegations indeed. Yes, the Speaker is entitled to the presumption of innocence but he does have quite a lot of explaining to do.  It‚Äôs also very important that the Prime Minister act to ensure the integrity of the Parliament. The Speaker is only in that office because the Prime Minister used her numbers late last year to install him. The Prime Minister, to uphold the integrity of the Parliament, needs now to require the Speaker to step down until these matters are resolved. It‚Äôs also incumbent upon the Australian Federal Police to swiftly investigate the potentially criminal allegations that have been made against the Speaker.  I can‚Äôt underestimate the seriousness of this. The Speaker is required to maintain parliamentary standards and yet there are now these extremely serious allegations against the Speaker himself. So in order to maintain the respect and the reputation of the Parliament, in order to preserve the integrity of the Government and our institutions, it is very important that the Prime Minister act swiftly to require the Speaker to step aside and it‚Äôs very important that the Australian Federal Police quickly investigate these matters so that they can be resolved as soon as is humanly possible.  QUESTION: So these aren‚Äôt the first allegations against him. Should this have been dealt with a long time ago?  TONY ABBOTT: Well these are matters that have been referred to a court. These are matters where legal documents have been lodged. These are matters that are now to be the subject of proceedings in court, so these are of a vastly more serious and substantial nature than anything that has been alleged against Mr Slipper in the past.  QUESTION: After everything that‚Äôs been going on with Craig Thomson, I suppose the question is, you know, where to from here? Does she need to make a stand now?  TONY ABBOTT: Well this does go to the integrity not just of the Parliament but of the Prime Minister and of the Government. The Prime Minister cannot wash her hands of this business the way she has tried to wash her hands of the allegations concerning Mr Thomson because Mr Slipper is no mere backbencher. Mr Slipper is the Speaker of the Parliament. Mr Slipper occupies a very, very important office. He is the guardian of the standards of the Parliament, the protector of the reputation of the Parliament and now there are these extremely serious allegations against him and that‚Äôs why the only proper way forward is for the Speaker to step aside while these allegations are being dealt with. If he doesn‚Äôt do so voluntarily, the Prime Minister should indicate that she will require him to step aside until these matters are resolved.  QUESTION: Do you have any thoughts on who should take his place while the investigation is ongoing?  TONY ABBOTT: Well, as a matter of ordinary parliamentary procedure, if the Speaker is unable to take the chair, the senior Deputy Speaker automatically would take the chair.  permalinksavereportgive goldreply  [‚Äì]perthguppy 54 points 1 day ago   Labor should just take this, modify it slightly to change 'he' to 'she' and remove the sexual conduct stuff, and then put that out as a press release"

Something any business would jump at the chance to.   I'm lucky in that my award pays overtime. There is no reasonable overtime, only paid overtime. Thing needs doing after hours? It costs. Everything has a cost, working for free simply transfers the cost from the person who benefits to the person who worked.

But most employees are usually scared / don't want to seek legal advice / etc. and so won't even attempt to contest such matters.   but where overtime is expected and a necessary part of the job   There are very specific circumstances where it is considered 'reasonable' to request an employee to work overtime, under the law.  It is not just at any time of the employer's discretion.   I also have a non-compete clause.   Also extremely tough to enforce, because a broad non-compete represents a restraint of trade.  You cannot prevent someone from earning a living in this country.  There needs to be specific restrictions, like soliciting clients of your former company within 3 months of leaving the company, for example may be deemed a reasonable request to enforce, but very rarely beyond that.    Non-competes are very rarely contested, and the people who would be affected the most (executive level and above) usually get it written into their contracts that the company will pay them for the period of their non-compete."

I never worked with him personally but some colleagues did. According to them, our managers were much worse.  I think it's a case of survival of the biggest cunt in that company. The weak/smart/frustrated leave the job and only the ones who adopt that attitude stay. Maybe they feel that they have done the hard yards  and then pass it on to the new generation.

Sometimes I feel like that I work in one of the few non-dodgy stores. Everyone who's on our shop floor to work gets paid (if they're a casual). Casuals don't get asked or expected to do sales setups unless it's part of their regular rostered hours. Midnight launches are paid for. You get regular hours. Even us full-timers don't put in extra hours above our contract unless it's absolutely necessary (usually just to make our lives easier the next day, for instance)  And yeah, I think we're the exception.  I'm not in that RSM's region but honestly it doesn't surprise me. Thankfully most of the higher-ups I've had to deal with have been nice people, but the corporate culture inside EB has really taken an insane nosedive ever since they introduced the KPI system a couple of years ago. Everyone's feeling huge amounts of pressure to perform and it's really made the quality of customer service dive in-stores as the pressure is to get good numbers on everything, regardless of context. Someone got 20% preorders? Tough shit, that person got 20.1%. Our year-to-date customer satisfaction numbers are constantly in a nosedive because no shit, the customers don't like being fucking harassed about everything, but the people who are genuinely friendly and good to talk to don't get anywhere in the company unless they can pull the numbers.  e: A lot of you are saying that you won't shop at EB any more. I 100% understand that. But please understand that the people that ends up punishing more in the short-term are the people working at the stores, not the toxic management that forces us to do shitty things. Us faceless mooks have bills to pay and mouths to feed, and I promise you at least some of us are trying our hardest to not let the big-wigs shit on us hard enough to pass it on to you guys.

As for the KPI's it seems to be the way of modern business and it's a bit shit. Company I work for in the last 2.5 years has gone from a pretty lazy approach to KPIs (record them, but no real target) to a basic target on one KPI with incentives, to 3 KPI's, to just changing to ""Dynamic KPI's"" with 8 total ones now to get the incentive. We now have to individually record our KPI's each week, where before it was team based as well, they shift pretty dramatically too, with seemingly no change one week you need to hit a target of 38, the next is 130. Bit stressful since they now also issue a please explain if you fall short, rather than purely incentive based if you hit it.

I've seen some setup solely for sales and staff who provided customer support would suffer greatly in their KPIs because the more aggressive sales people would pass all the customer support issues to that one person.  So the one that would go out of their way for customers and get them coming back was the one with the poorer KPIs and the staff with the Highest KPIs would be the ones hired for management roles.  TLDR KPI's don't tell the whole story.

As well as team meetings in which everyone was expected to clean up the store after being yelled at for pretty much everything. Not to mention I was being paid about a dollar under award wage for my age with no penalty rates.   This was Go-Lo, which was part of the Discount Variety Group which is very much dead and gone now (they went broke). It does not surprise me one iota that other retail places are like this.   I was considering a job at EB Games, I'm friends with the manager of my local store and he told me that he can't afford to give his casuals hours and also keep himself afloat. 99% of the time I go in there, he is in there with one casual and it makes me wonder how much of that is unpaid work he does there... at the very least, he was complaining a few months back (before they started the latest sale) that he didn't have time to put up the displays because it was only him there and he had to stop whenever a customer came in. So you can bet your ass he put all that stuff up when the store closed.  I also did unpaid work experience at GAME before they liquidated (because I was too young to be hired) and I only ever worked with the assistant manager, he would often leave the store in my hands while he went to get lunch or have a smoke. Anyway, they kept me on until I was old enough to get a job and then weren't interested in hiring me despite the fact I'd been trusted to the point where the assistant manager got me to fill out banking slips. I only realise now that I must've been taking hours away from a paid casual. They took advantage of my naivety. So yes, in my (admittedly limited) experience, retail is a horrible place where this is not unusual.  TL;DR, got underpaid and expected to work overtime with no pay at Go-Lo, got warned off a job at EB Games by a manager and did 6 months of unpaid ""work experience"" at GAME and still didn't get a job."

Lo and behold, all super repaid by the ATO a couple of months later, and an inside-source (friend) tells me they're paying off a massive fine at the moment.  Look after yourselves people. A lot of the time the law is on your side."

Basically everything is dumped on the store manager, the ASM (assistant store manager) is irrelevant (not as far as work output, they get dumped on there) they are just ""chief lackey"" who fills in for the store manager and will take the position when the store manager eventually leaves (or the ASM will leave first because the store manager is an arsehole).  Anyway, I worked under a few state managers and a few district/area managers, I actually respected most of my bosses quite a lot, they did push the crap that came down from above but they would try their best, never unprofessional when dealing with problems that I saw and always motivated me when they visited.  But, the shit from head office is ridiculous, your wages budget is based on previous budgets, so if you opened a new store, and you get generous budgets then, if you are good and you find you don't use your budget and still get everything done, be prepared for a smaller budget based on what you used, not what was previously given to you....it is basically punishing you for doing well, as this means next time you won't get quite as much of a bonus (which is capped at 20% of your wage anyway.  Also it is a total boys club, if you want to get past store manager on the store side than you better become really good buddies (like in their bridal party level buddies) with state and district managers, otherwise you will be overlooked for area manager positions consistently.  I loved working there as a casual employee, had a lot of fun, ASM sucked, Store Manager sucked even more during June/July and Nov/Dec/Jan, but otherwise was pretty good, but as the years went on the other months started sucking more and more too.

I would rather see the medicare levy go up if there is shortage of funds for hospitals largely created by Abbott cutting funding to increase  pressure on  states to increase the GST. I dont want a GST increase so that Joe Hockey can further cut taxes for companies and high income earners just absorbing the GST increase.  How is it fair that we  going to give billions away in super tax concessions and these handouts will be bigger than the health or pension slices of  the total budget. Its stupidity at its best calling for the end of  the age of entitlement and we end up giving billions away while our hospital system and health care system rots.  It is also bad policy increasing the GST for a shortfall in government revenue while nothing is being done about the inefficiency, duplication and wast of all layers of government. This mantra  is right from the Liberal song book, but they doing more to increase government waste than cutting it. An example is the federal government health dept wring a cheque to another beauracryc in the states to dish out healthcare funding. This is incompetent double handling and very wasteful. They should write the cheque out directly to the hospitals and the hospitals should be left to decide what equipment and  policies they pursue. Its ridiculous that we have public servants telling hospitals what syringes and equipment they should buy from their approved corrupt supplier list. Wasteful practices at its best. This same mistake is repeated right across government.  Unfortunately I dont trust this government to  do the right thing with our taxes.

The rich will get the best pieces of land because they can afford to purchase in those areas. There is no getting around this simple fact, the lower class renters or the equivalent will not live in these highly desirable suburbs because they will get outbid by those with more money.

But the more I hear about concepts of net neutrality, the more things like this annoy me. THIS content shouldn't be un-metered, ALL content should be un-metered.  Internode should be hosting these content mirrors, not so they can offer their own customers free access, subsidized by the competition, but so their customers get FASTER access at less cost to them (internode).  I don't want to see our walled garden approach continue. It's bad enough with things like Foxtel buying exclusive distribution rights to Game of Thrones. Imagine if one provider got exclusive access to steam (couldn't happen) or the like? It would take an already fragmented internet and just destroy it."
australia,3dxnak,asciimov,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:51:09 2015 UTC,"Net Neutrality is about prioritising speed of delivery, not cost of delivery. iiNet (and all its subsidiaries which include Internode) offer unmetered access as they colocate with content mirrors specifically for Netflix. It is in iiNet's interest as they don't need to pay for transit links to America to cover the volume for their customer. (You could make a case that this is a form of net neutrality I guess, in that the traffic will be faster as it is colocated, and doen't need to traverse the Internet, only the iiNet core network, but I think that is a misnomer)  When you have ISP's shaping traffic (i.e.: reducing speeds) to certain sites, then you go into the field of Net Neutrality. That is when the ISP is making decisions on which traffic is more important than others (i.e.: rate shaping torrent traffic as opposed to HTTP) or when a company is attempting to squeeze a competitor (i.e.: in America where Comcast, who are a media company are rate limiting to competitors like Netflix, or blackmailing them to make them pay a premium to boost speeds)  What a company like iiNet is doing is value adding, not negatively impacting traffic flow.  Australias internet landscape is quite different to that of the United States or mainland Europe. If you want to read iiNets views on Net Neutrality, they can be found here.  Transcontinental submarine links are significantly more expensive than fibre interconnects. Also considering the majority of content is hosted in the United States, large volumes of traffic are required to  traverse these links. It is for this reason cost of internet traffic are higher for Australia. (Although CDN's like Akamai do reduce the amount of traffic required to transit these links, it doesn't guarantee traffic won't, and ISP's need to be able to cover these needs)   I can also see a need for content shaping in a network in peak times. Traffic which is delay sensitive should be prioritised over traffic that isn't. HOWEVER this does not mean an ISP should use this to limit costs by not investing in enough transit (or backhaul, which is more often the bottleneck). However a company has to straddle having enough bandwidth free to support network use, but not so much to leave large amounts underutilised."

I do make that case.  At it's heart, the concept of neutrality would define an ISP as a carrier of data not a provider/gatekeeper of data.  I understand the historical reasons. I understand we are not the US. I understand the physical realities of the networks.  Saying that neutrality should only apply to speed is like saying that barn raised chickens are ""free range"" simply because they aren't in individual cages. When you are in a standing room only situation and your beak and talons have been cut off so you can't harm your neighbours, you are not free. Or to put it another way, don't use the word ""neutral"" to describe something in a blanket fashion when you only mean it in one very specific circumstance."

For example the government sells licences to a mining company who invests significant money on machinery and infrastructure and commences the project. Next election the Greens win and decide they don't want the mine and using parliamentary powers, cancel the licence. Now the mining company who acted within the legal framework has lost significant amounts of money which it can't recoup directly due to change in government policy and government intervention. Rightfully they should be able to sue.  There are issues with the TPP, but the idea of suing is not something that's strange.

Funding rooftop solar for low income earners was never within the CEFC's scope.  http://www.cleanenergyfinancecorp.com.au/what-we-do.aspx  The CEFC focuses on projects and technologies at the later stages of development which have a positive expected rate of return and have the capacity to service and repay capital. We can also look at earlier stage projects which have significant support and a risk profile appropriate for CEFC.
australia,3dxim6,v_maet,6,Mon Jul 20 11:34:42 2015 UTC,"hmmm I got the impression they were, formerly, within the scope.

I never argued that it was a developing technology, only that people who previously were in the process of getting solar might now be left in the lurch. Also the point about ""a lot of people"" would want it is irrelevant because,once again, I specifically referring to that small subset of people who were previously entitled to some loans, or were assisted by funding made available to companies who then were able to offer a free installation who will not be now.

Which is exactly why they are being told to stop working outside their scope and focus on emerging technology that is not yet commercially ready.  There are hundreds of solar pv sellers in the market and over 1.4 million rooftop solar systems installed across Australia so investment by the CEFC into this space is not necessary.
australia,3dxim6,v_maet,2,Mon Jul 20 13:20:59 2015 UTC,"You misunderstand my comment. I'm pointing out that they do invest in rooftop solar, so an ISDS claim can't be dismissed on the basis that the CEFC didn't invest in rooftop solar.   stop working outside their scope and focus on emerging technology that is not yet commercially ready.   You are completely and utterly wrong. You have totally misunderstood what the CEFC was created to do. Here's an excerpt from the second reading speech that shows why you are way off;   The Clean Energy Finance Corporation will be independent from government, with no ability for the government to direct the corporation in relation to specific projects for investment. This will ensure an independent decision - making process.  The corporation will operate based on three principles.  Firstly, the corporation is a mechanism to help mobilise private investment in renewable energy, low-emission s and energy efficiency projects and technologies in this country. The corporation will also invest in manufacturing businesses that provide inputs to the clean energy sector.  The corporation will focus on catalysing private finance into Australia ' s clean energy sector. It will provide financial products and structures that address the financial barriers currently inhibiting private investment. Such facilitation is critical in transitioning the Australian energy market.  To ensure the effectiveness of this capital mobilisation the corporation is expected to require private co-investment in projects. It is unlikely ever to be a sole financier. This approach will build investor experience and confidence in the clean energy sector.  The corporation will invest at least half of its funds in renewable energy technologies. The other half will be available to fund energy efficiency and low-emissions technologies.  Secondly, the corporation will apply a commercial filter when making its investment decisions. It will focus on projects and technologies at the later stages of development, consistent with the r eport of the expert review panel.  The commercial filter will apply priva te- sector skills and disciplines to investment selection. Having a public policy purpose, the corporation has different financial risk and return requirements and values any positive externalities from investments. For a given financial return, the corporation may take on higher risk and, for a given level of risk, due to positive externalities, may accept a lower financial return.  Thirdly, the corporation has the capacity to offer concessional finance and directly influence financial barriers that inhibit the financing of this sector. The individuality of each project necessitates a case-by-case approach.  The corporation can tailor concessionality in each case and apply it through availability, tenor or cost of finance. In setting the terms, the corporation will provide only the least generous terms required for a proposal to go ahead.   The CEFC invests in late stage development, and focuses on financing not technology development. You've completely confused ARENA with the CEFC.  You may not want the CEFC to invest in late stage projects. But it was built to do that. It's not in the slightest 'out of its scope'.  As the second reading speech notes, the CEFC is not meant to focus on projects that are not commercially ready. That is why it usually requires co-investors."
australia,3dxim6,mossmaal,0,Mon Jul 20 13:52:23 2015 UTC,"Just because the CEFC have funded rooftop solar previously does not mean it is within their scope, or that it should somehow allow them to continue funding rooftop solar.

Here's another quote that is the final nail in the coffin of your idea that the CEFC is meant to focus on R&D.   the Government expects the corporation to apply a commercial filter when making its investment decisions. Investments will focus on projects beyond the research and development stage, have a positive rate of return and have the capacity to repay capital. This approach will ensure the corporation invests responsibly and manages risk to achieve a targeted rate of return and ultimately be financially self-sufficient.   It is right there. Focus on projects BEYOND R&D. Beyond. As in, when the project is reading for commercial development.  Just in case you don't know, early development = R&D, mid stage = first deployments and late development = everything past that. It's a common phrase used because development never actually stops.  Not even the politicians are claiming that rooftop solar is outside the scope of the CEFC.

The reason people are more hostile towards Christians (openly) is because they've had a good ride, have long been a majority, and have had many things go in their favor and people are less reluctant to finally fight back and speak up."

The Prime Minister cannot wash her hands of this business the way she has tried to wash her hands of the allegations concerning Mr Thomson because Mr Slipper is no mere backbencher. Mr Slipper is the Speaker of the Parliament. Mr Slipper occupies a very, very important office. He is the guardian of the standards of the Parliament, the protector of the reputation of the Parliament and now there are these extremely serious allegations against him and that‚Äôs why the only proper way forward is for the Speaker to step aside while these allegations are being dealt with. If he doesn‚Äôt do so voluntarily, the Prime Minister should indicate that she will require him to step aside until these matters are resolved."

But it is speeches like this which make Tony such a deplorable hollow man (becoming depressingly typical of the modern politican of both big parties). Faced with a similar but worse situation, his squirming is just complete hyprocrisy.  I always remember he made a similar speech in opposition about the auto industry in Australia and how it was so near and dear to his heart and how he could not imagine this country without that great institution. Again, it was poetic and you could easily be fooled into thinking he was genuine. You have to wonder what integrity he has to talk like that then do a hatchet job on it a few years later. I am personally glad that welfare industry was abolished I think it is one of the best and bravest actions this Government has taken.

australia,3dxw5m,oakum_ouroboros,6,Mon Jul 20 14:04:29 2015 UTC,"One only needs to read Westpac's response to Murray's report. The $114 billion bank revealed it only holds ""capital of 1.32 per cent"" against $468 billion of home loans (see second chart). That means Westpac is leveraging its wafer-thin equity 77 times when extending half a trillion dollars of finance to home owners, which is exactly the same leverage estimate we calculated in this column in July last year. Imagine how Westpac would react if you told them you could only provide a 1.3 per cent deposit for your home.  When a loan goes into default, most investors and rating agencies assume ""loss severities"" of about 40 per cent. So Blind Freddy can figure out that Westpac only needs to suffer an increase in its residential mortgage default rates to 3.3 per cent before it wipes out all the equity it holds against these assets. That default rate, by the way, is less than levels experienced by British banks during the global financial crisis, and a fraction of the rates recorded in the US.   http://www.afr.com/business/banking-and-finance/big-four-banks-hit-iceberg-after-apras-wayne-byres-talks-mortgage-risk-weights-20150501-1ms1sr  All this talk about Australia's banks being strong is such bullshit. They were making up their own risk weightings and handing out loans like crazy. Those loans are still okay - for now. The people still have their jobs. But these are loans that should have never been made - either at all or not for the same level of debt.  If proper risk assessment had been done then the quality of the loans would be better and the ""banks are strong"" idea would have a bit more evidence behind it.  As the article I posted mentions - a default rate increase to just 3.3% for Westpac wipes them out entirely. A default rate that is lower than experienced in other countries during bubble bursting.  The banks are NOT holding enough capital against their loan books because their loan books are full of soon-to-be-bad loans! It is being completely ignored that they made up their own risk assessments and threw money out like mad.  This is our version of sub-prime mortgages. There is also evidence of widespread mortgage fraud committed via mortgage lenders - inflating assets, inflating income, counting bonus payments as regular income, etc.  What really needs to happen is an assessment of the loan books modelling a 7% interest rate and checking the monthly income of various customers to see how it stacks up against the loan application.   When the bubble breaks we're going to find out a lot of dodgy mortgages were created and the banks will push it off to brokers or claim they couldn't have known defaults would be higher than 3.3%. It's utter bullshit."

We are currently looking at a $130 BILLION productivity bill due to lost transit and delays due to excess immigration. Our hospitals, schools, ambulances, kindergardens, pre-school, and every other service worth considering is WELL PAST breaking point, several years past.  This is before we even mention services for women, homelessness, child abuse, domestic violence etc.  On top of this we are running a $50-60 BILLION deficit as we have lost almost our manufacturing.  The ENTIRE mass immigration movement has been started by far right wing corporate interests, developers, super markets and the state government who is entirely beholden to stamp duty revenue.  Above all the greatest threat is now also upon our environment as we are massively over populating Victoria, placing huge burdens on flora, fauna and energy demands.

For the parents perspective it's very tricky, she says she's insulted and offended that he's getting these privileges, and that millions of Australians expect more from the justice system.   I'd like to say she's over reacting but really she isn't over reacting, but do a mother's hurt feelings warrant this? He's already serving a life sentence without parole, is that not good enough? There's a reason why we haven't just executed this person. She also calls the justice system that gave him life without parole broken.    ""The community interest in retribution, deterrence, protection of the community in such situations may so strongly outweigh any regard for rehabilitation that that's when a life sentence becomes a real option.""   At the same time when he was sentenced the judge didn't consider him a possibility for rehabilitation so should the prison be giving him these privileges?    The thought that he can do courses or get a job is offensive to us as well as to the millions of Australians who expect more from our justice system.   Whilst I don't agree with this looking at the comments people left for why they signed is quite eye opening.

Everything I've seen suggests that short of difficult preventatives measures like chemical castration (which is not actual rehabilitation and requires constant monitoring) any such rehabilitation is impossible. It would be like rehabilitating a serial killer - their crimes are driven by a consuming compulsion rather than any external factors, and those compulsions cannot be removed with much success."

Why not lock him in a dark cell and never let him see the sunlight, if it helps her to sleep at night?  We can all appreciate her pain but there's a really good reason that we don't let the victims decide how we treat criminals.  Demanding more restrictions to this guy does nothing to make the world a better place, it just makes him more unhappy. What's the point of that? He's never going to get out. Depriving somebody when it serves no purpose other than making you feel good that you got to hurt them, makes you a bad person. We should all have that cruel, reactionary side of our selves, and we should all try to turn away from it at every opportunity. It's not about forgiving him for what he did, it's not about him at all. It's about who we are.  Then there's the practical implication that the whole reason they give prisoners privileges is so that they can take them away if they misbehave. True rehabilitation to the point where he can rejoin society is not an option but people (guards, doctors, other inmates etc) still have to deal with him every day for the rest of his life so some sort of rehabilitation is still necessary.

I'm a bit worried that brigading a bunch of people to affect an internal decision.

It's not like he was on day release or getting access to the internet where he can be in contact with kids, it was just a wood working class. He's behind bars so safe from causing any harm.

Canberra almost had its own FTTN network a decade ago in the form of TransACT. But between really lax contracts, insufficient contractor review, work review and quality assurance we had things like cable being run past houses, with no facility to actually connect anything to the cable (so literally cable hanging on power poles, with no optical networking gear installed and no way to install it without ripping the cable down and starting again from scratch). Then there were the catered lunches put on to woo suppliers ‚Ä¶ seriously, it should be the suppliers trying to grease palms.

I want a diary and a report of her actions. What was the outcome of the trip??"
australia,3dvhpe,NowInOz,30,Sun Jul 19 22:36:29 2015 UTC,"Sometimes her duties require her to be a representative of the Australian Parliament as a whole.

australia,3dvhpe,Not_Stupid,10,Sun Jul 19 23:32:41 2015 UTC,Plus wouldn't the representative of the Australian Parliament as a whole be the prime minister. Maybe the foreign minister or governor-general. But her job is basically to be the impartial judge of the house of reps.  She doesn't have anything to do with the legislative process. Her job is to keep the HoR to order and inline with the rules of Parliament.  Electronic voting is the AEC responsibility. Wouldn't a politician having direct involvement defeat the point of fair elections.  P.S. If this seemed like an attack it wasn't. Just that she doesn't have business overseas unless there is a commonwealth speakers of the house retreat and spa day.  Edit: Apparently I was wrong the speaker does represent the house.

Think of it in a way like a G20 Conference. We have representation through the Speaker of the House and internally they elect a President every few years.   She was going for that position as a representative of the Australian Government.   Generally, any travel while representing your country is paid for, and while the Presidency is though this group, she only has access to it through her role as Speaker.

What possible justification is there, during an apparent 'debt and deficit disaster' where the incomes of families, pensioners and the vulnerable have been slashed often by thousands, for the Speaker of the House - a wholly domestic role - to travel overseas for any reason, let alone to do so repeatedly. Australia's taxpayers should not have to fork out 90,000 dollars (oh sorry just 88,000 as you so helpfully pointed out) for you to go to a personal job interview in Europe. Australia certainly should have to put up with you wasting close to HALF A MILLION DOLLARS on travel during your very, very short tenure.   Bronwyn - you are not a diplomat. You're not a party politician. You're not the Pope or the Queen, both of whom would probably balk at the flagrant excess of hiring a helicopter to go to a party an hour down the road.

Also, given that this was the speaker of the house in another country, additional safety guards against espionage, etc. would have been necessary, raising the cost even more.

You're making assumptions here based again off one experience. It should not happen, but it did. You got the food for free and I am not sure what you expected them to do on the spot to put your mind at ease. In your original post you basically admitted that you were not happy with their response but what response did you want? Them to beg for forgiveness and promise to do better next time?  Again, only ate there twice, one bad and one good but I am not going to assume that NO systems are in place in a major and popular eatery in the city. It's just not a reasonable thought."

Were the inspectors doing their jobs then? I will remain skeptical about councils food  standard inspectors.

The main focus should be to keep everyone safe, and an effective way to do that is to keep people calm. Talking to people and interacting with them can be an easy way to calm people down and avoid a situation developing. I've worked a few RSA gigs alongside security teams, and ive shaken hands with people who I thought were complete assholes, simply because it was an easy way to de-escalate the situation.    I just don't think there is enough evidence in this picture to tell me anything happening here is bad. I'd much rather see pictures like this than a cop beating the guy with a stick.

What's wrong with leaving the fascists be is that they begin to look strong, and this begins to appeal to the thick skulled amongst us ... and in no time your society is unrecognisable.

It is my experience that only those who have never experienced authority disrespect authority or expect those in positions of power to be infallible. That officer who punched a handcuffed man should be suspended (without pay after an internal investigation) and forced to do some training. Sacked if he is a repeat offender.     The end.          Instead; Rick Flori has brought the entire police force into question by bringing negative media attention on the vast majority of officers who are doing their best day in day out.        his now desperate  attempts to stay in the media spotlight makes me uncomfortable and i think his initial decision may not have been altruism, rather attention seeking. approaching a senior officer to ""shake hands"" is the actions of a schoolyard bully.

While some question the severity of punishments the police receive, generally once an offense is exposed it's punished. The bigger issue is the opacity and lack of transparency of the whole ordeal - the fact that a public institution charged with maintaining law and order is handling these cases behind closed doors, where the potential for backroom deals (especially in a state like Queensland where police corruption was already the subject of a massive inquiry) is too high.  Police cases should be handled out in the open for the public to see like any other case. No internal disciplinary bullshit when it comes to actual crimes, leave that for officer conduct. Or else you get the same issue that American universities have when handling allegations of rape or sexual assault."

McDonalds etc. settle any ""food poisoning"" complaints quietly and out of the media.              i don't like it, I would love open and transparent. This is  just not how these thing go.

australia,3dxdw2,Primate541,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:02:36 2015 UTC,"People calling ambulances for minor things is a problem, but it is not what ties up ambulances for the most part. The main issue is when there are no places to admit patients from emergency departments, so the beds are filled and then there is no place to offload patients from ambulance stretchers. The ambulances then are required to stay with the patient unless a decision is made to make use of an ambulance release team to look after them, which is an added cost that frees up the ambulance but is only used in times where numerous patients can't be offloaded.   These patients are still able to be seen by doctors but often can't be properly examined as they may be in an ambulance bay or corridor. It's in their best interests then to be offloaded so they can be properly assessed and treated, not to have even more ambulances stuck in emergency departments.   Employing more paramedics is not a solution, it's a bandaid for a leaking artery. We need to create more hospital beds and employ extra staff to cover them, so ambulances can be offloaded in a timely manner.   I do think an additional cost for ambulances for trivial matters should be instituted. There is very little recourse for them currently. I have seen people call ambulances for the purposes of getting home from the shops feigning illness (their residence was down the road and they left as soon as they arrived) and others because they didn't want to be home alone at night."

I grew up in Mackay and I don't agree with this MPs views. The irony of the situation is that in the last decade the population of the place has grown and a lot of the new arrivals are more than likely from larger metropolitan areas or indeed other states. Chances are people in that crowd are not from the area or qld in general, who knows, does it really matter?

There's obviously no need to talk to people like this, but the level of sensationalism of calling such a glib remark a ""threat of sexual violence"" is made clear if we consider what the reaction would be if this tweet to Christensen was take similarly at face value. I don't think he would partake in the gangbanging of Miranda Devine any more than he would actually seek to skullfuck the member for Dawson. If any reasonable person would agree, then there's not much substance to it.   Of course, maybe a lot of people would take it as a sincere statement of intent. There is always the matter of the greater public being naive to the internet (even among people who are on the internet a lot).

Thus why it went largely unnoticed until Miranda Devine herself tied it to the Q&A fiasco.  All that said, it goes without saying that it's a lesson in public speaking. Twitter's where half the news seems to be these days, so you should think about what you are saying and how many people you might be speaking to when you go online."

How can you truly discuss issues without including people like him from the community?  I don't agree with Zaky but I sure as shit support his right to speak his mind and question his government officials on live television if he is given the chance.  Maybe instead of creating theatre and drama over it, the elected representative could have answered the question politely.  Zaky spoke the truth on that episode, blunt and to the point, it is the Liberal party attitude that turns young disgruntled youth away from us and into the hands of these groups, plain and simple.  Extremist groups know this and actively recruit from disgruntled youth, hence why we had that young ginger haired twit speaking in ISIS videos last year.  edit: spelling"

What?  Half of the kids that went over to Syria weren't even middle-eastern, they were young middle class white suburban teenagers pissed off at the world.  Twenty years ago they would have joined a hippy commune in Nimbin, gone overseas to try their hand at the French foreign legion or disappeared to India to search for enlightenment, these days they are going to Mosque's.  We need to seriously ask why this is happening rather than shut down debate and turn it into more political theatre and the best way to do this is to have people like Zaky and other kids that were in that position.    Some people may be out to cause trouble, but in the current political climate with so many dirty politicians sucking the life out of the country with their extravagant tax payer funded lifestyle who's to blame them for being disgruntled?  The fire is burning because Team Australia are fanning the flames mate, Zaky Malah was relatively unknown until last months Q&A drama was dragged on for weeks in the media, and the more Tony Abbott and Co kept up the hissy fit, the more publicity the kid got and the more ridiculous our government looked.

It's good to pose the question of why it is happening, I didn't say not to. I did say, however, that I believe Zaky looks to cause trouble, misinformation, discredit things, rather than help answer this question. A political (and religious) agitator. But seeing as you changed context, can you answer that question? Why are these kids attracted to Islamism or extremism? I highly doubt it's solely on the current political atmosphere.

From screaming at me to ""Stop Her From Killing Your Baby!"" to taking pictures of both us and our car. My gf was in tears at this point because she thought the pictures might be shared with fuck knows who and that we might be targeted because of it. I honestly thought I was going to have to carry her inside because I could feel her freezing up she was so upset. Yet apparently this sort of behaviour is entirely legal, as the cops do absolutely nothing. This isn't surprising, because when the cops show up they just see 8-10 haggard looking pensioners with signs. Not that scary. That is until you actually have to get in the clinic.  Make no mistake, these protestors are not just harmless old people who want to talk to you about Jesus or just share some factually incorrect pamphlets with you with some gross pictures of miscarriages at 16 weeks and claiming that is what a 6-week old abortion looks like. Not at all. I thought that was all they were, until I went there. These people want to scare women at their most vulnerable and are very successful at it.

If I was a Jehovah's Witness and believed blood transfusions are wrong and awful, I can't go blocking access to Emergency Rooms and handing leaflets to ambulance officers.

My point is that it's a slippery slope to start treading on when you limit the freedoms of one particular group.   Surely, there is already a provision that allows them to be moved on. When the construction unions blockade a worksite, cops on horses show and people get pepper sprayed and batons to the face with little to no community outrage - you're telling me they (edit: anti-women's rights jesus cunts) can't be peacefully told to fuck off? Perhaps their is political pressure, perhaps people are too scared to complain - who knows!? But the imposition of more regulation should be the last resort."

I do not believe there would be any sort of slippery slope to legislation that specifically addresses abortion clinic exclusion zones.  Abortion clinic protests are a special breed, indeed, I believe the behaviour of many of these protesters goes against acceptable protest conditions. https://www.nationalcapital.gov.au/downloads/corporate/publications/The_Right_to_Protest.pdf  Such as breaching (or at least nudging the grey area) issues of permanence, and impeding movement.  From footage I've seen, there could undoubtedly be arguments made for protesters committing unlawful assembly, offensive behaviour and property damage. http://www.lawhandbook.org.au/fact_sheets/ch21.php  It wouldn't surprise me if police were not particularly willing to charge clinic protesters. They are usually older and have all the time in the world to write letters, manufacture outrage and make nuisances of themselves. Perhaps that is part of the problem, and the reason people are calling for exclusion zones: so it becomes a very simple rule that can't be argued over.  ... maybe a new law wouldn't be necessary if we picketed some police stations, to ask them to more properly enforce the law at abortion clinics, eh? :)"
australia,3dvviq,mightybonk,6,Mon Jul 20 01:36:08 2015 UTC,"I think the reluctanct of police to act is something that absolutely needs to be addressed because surely the cobduct of protesters constitutes harrassment.

If they didn't seek to intimidate or harass individuals - they wouldn't be picketing the place.

However a lot of people, like me, also took advantage of a tracker mortgage that was linked to the European Base Rate (+ a tiny %, in my case 0.25%). When I took it out this base rate was something like 4%, and now it is sitting at 0.05% to help stimulate the European economy. The banks make nothing on my mortgage and they have fought and lost legal battles to get rid of tracker mortages, so they are stuck with them. So essentially I have an extraordinarily cheap loan. Unfortunately I can't sell the house as it so deep in negative equity, so I have to stick with it until I've paid enough of the mortgage off or the property market climbs back up again. Fortunately with the interest rate so low, rents almost cover the mortgage, so I just have to cover management and other expenses!"

The oversupply is in the 1 and 2 bedroom apartments in CBD/Southbank/Docklands area. I agree that there will be little to no growth in those properties, considering that there is no real height limit there, there is no scarcity, they can never achieve capital gains. If apartments did go up in value, a developer would just build another one next door. In fact this is what we are already seeing. An apartment in a high rise should never cost much more than it's construction cost, the land itself is a tiny portion of what is being purchased.  A house in the inner - middle suburbs sitting on it's own dirt, those aren't coming down in price any time soon. The demand for those is massive, and fuelled by genuine market forces. Genuine scarcity and genuine desirability. When you have those 2 things, there is no force on earth that can force the price down."
australia,3dwhqv,L3mon-Lim3,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:17:49 2015 UTC,"The oversupply is in the 1 and 2 bedroom apartments in CBD/Southbank/Docklands area.   How do you know this? The evidence doesn't show this at all.   Regarding a price crash - it's true that there are genuine market forces at play. People want to live in Camberwell, there is no more empty land there and the existing residents hire QCs to stop development so the only way in is to buy.  But there is also speculation at play right across the country. There are people who have bought into Camberwell at $700K who will lose their job when the recession comes along. They will be forced to sell. There are investors who will be forced to sell. There will be others who are genuinely selling (they're moving or whatever) who won't be able to get their price because suburb prices have already been dropping.  In the US Manhattan lost 40% of its price. A city, highly sort after and then a massive drop because speculation was the major component rather than genuine demand.  There are many things that force prices down even with scarcity and desirability. In Ireland 2007 their house prices dropped 0.6% in March and 0.8% in April. Within two months prices began slowly dropping while the media and real estate industries tried to talk them up. By 2011 house prices were down 51% and apartment prices 60%. From Jan 2012 - July 2012 house prices dropped another 13.6%.  Desirability and scarcity (perceived) don't matter at all in a falling market. If you see prices drop 5% in a month would you be eager to jump in? Or perhaps do you wait another month to see what happens?   In a recession with rising unemployment it is a complete money drought. No one is buying and desirability has nothing to do with it.  Where I live prices have been dropping. One area has lost about 8% from the median price last year. The price drop is about $5000 more than our yearly rent so we're quite happy to wait another year to see what happens.   A lot of the market is driven by psychology but there are also hard limits. People need jobs to buy houses and when people collectively wake up to the realisation that a house 1+ hour commute from Melbourne in an suburban nothing isn't worth $450K then you see people stay out of the market."

The article is light on details but there is a picture of him in the portacot and it does say it is a food stall. Perhaps the complaints were about a kid sitting around in a small portacot for a number of hours. I can't imagine she is interacting with him much if she is busy.

I'd be curious how you manage to take samples from something you can't find.  Or perhaps the more obvious explanation, is that they couldn't find it from the air with the UV light sensors, so switched to alternate methods (ie they found it by actually going out there in a fucking boat), and your pithy attempts to be feel vindicated require misreading the article."

In other words, due to the vigilance of the fisherman whose reports you disparaged when this story first came to light, a spill has been identified and, hopefully, the culprit will face penalties.   Really, it is painfully obvious to everyone here that you are stuck in a denialist mindset. Plain, simple denial of empirical facts."

""And that is all he knew; that it was an oil slick and it was about 800 metres in diameter. I can't tell you any more.""   Since then, they apparently located an oil spill by helicopter and water police at 7:00pm Friday night, then couldn't find it the next day in daylight searches with a helicopter because the equipment wasn't sensitive enough.  MSQ then go n to say:  Mr Quirk said the oil was weathering in south-easterly winds in slight to moderate seas and was most likely to break-down before reaching beaches.  He said while the oil was not visible to plane equipment, it was still in the water.   So basically, they found some small sheen areas (nothing like the original 800m diameter claim from a fisherman before dawn), then they lost them and now say it will likely break down before it gets to a beach because they don't know what/where it is."
australia,3dvssr,Occulto,1 point,Mon Jul 20 07:43:37 2015 UTC,"So they still haven't found it.   That's not what Mr Quirk said.

Fourteen ships have been identified as possible sources of a film of oil stretching, in broken sections, 30 kilometres long and five kilometres wide south of Townsville, Patrick Quirk, general manager of Maritime Services Queensland said on Saturday.

A statement said Ms Bishop only took the chopper to ""meet commitments,"" and that, ""because of her concern for the country, she works as hard as she can and wishes she could do even more.""   A passage from George Orwell's Animal Farm on why the pigs running the farm are entitled to so much more:   ‚ÄúComrades!' he cried. 'You do not imagine, I hope, that we pigs are doing this in a spirit of selfishness and privilege? Many of us actually dislike milk and apples. I dislike them myself. Our sole object in taking these things is to preserve our health. Milk and apples (this has been proved by Science, comrades) contain substances absolutely necessary to the well-being of a pig. We pigs are brainworkers. The whole management and organisation of this farm depend on us. Day and night we are watching over your welfare. It is for your sake that we drink the milk and eat those apples.‚Äù    How ironic that Orwell was writing a critique on communism Stalinism rather than the Liberal Party.  EDIT: words for clarity. Remember citizens... FOUR LEGS GOOD, TWO LEGS BAD!"
australia,3dtw3e,WontThinkStraight,41,Sun Jul 19 13:00:30 2015 UTC,"This does not reference communism - the farm originally overthrew the farmer and created an utopia, the farmer being Tsar.   The usurping of the communist ideal by the pigs represents the destruction of the communist ideal and the imposition of the totalitarian state - STALINISM.  Stalinism is NOT communism any more than Saddam Husseins Iraq was a democracy.    The story is a parable about the corruption of power which can occur in any society, even the most idealised one - communism.  It is therefore an almost perfect parable for the lNP.  Ironic that this should be so misguided as Marxism is now being revived and the death of Capitalism being heralded.  ."

And hence the antagonism between working and capital classes (workers can ONLY sell their labor - that is all they have to sell).  Capitalism will eventually devolve into a state where we have absolute and total control over our natural world to the point we can supply all our needs on a whim without work (we are verging on that state now) - this state is communism.  Marx was never prescribing a method of running an economy or society, he was proclaiming how capitalism would eventually result."

australia,3dvrmv,rainynight65,9,Mon Jul 20 01:52:32 2015 UTC,"Sure. We have an older home with suspended timber floors.  Sensible options were foil insulation, polystyrene board, or rockwool batts.  I went with rock/glasswool batts for the added bonus of sound deadening (as we live near a busy road)... plus the polystyrene is messy to cut and fit.  I bought earthwool batts from Bunnings, as these were the best fit for my joist width (less cutting, more installing fasterer) and proved very easy to install (underfloor insulation batts are more rigid than wall/ceiling ones because you want them to kinda grip the joists themselves).  I installed them just like this video says to.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVQL4WqkW8E  Cost under a grand, and took 2 people who had never done it before under 10 hours to do our place, which did have a fair bit of confined space work.  House was immediately quieter, and over the next few days we noticed our heater was more effective, and the house temperature is more stable.  ... sucks though, because now I know what a great difference it makes, I want to do the walls too, which will be much more work :)  If you buy a staple gun from Bunnings, get one of the Arrow brand ones. I bought a Stanley that was on special and it crapped out after a thousand staples."

I think it's the 50% discount on capital gains, the massive centralisation of Melbourne and Sydney, council zoning restrictions, and undersupply that are the main reasons. Removal of negative gearing would scare off some newer investors and lower prices, but it wouldn't make them much more affordable."
australia,3dun3d,Supersnazz,3,Mon Jul 20 09:40:40 2015 UTC,"Oh I disagree it's the main cause too, I think it's a pretty complex beast this bubble. Undersupply, I fear, is not as big an issue as we've been led to believe.  The bubble probably began because of unusually high economic growth, in combination with a rise in the idea that renovating and flipping properties was a 'great investment' (shows like the Block became a big part of popular culture); favourable tax policies definitely formed part of the picture as they encouraged people to borrow and aim to lord over their own string of houses.   As the boom continued, a combination of low rates, a high stable dollar, low unemployment and very high immigration puffed the bubble up and up, and as it grew more people began to see housing as a cash cow or sure thing, and prices rose higher still, and more people wanted on the bandwagon, and prices began to look insane at this point (around 2009, 2010), yet still rose and rose.  We began to hear the first bubble calls, but as is the way with bubbles, these economists (e.g. Steve Keen) called too early and were seen as foolish, fuelling the idea a crash could not happen to us - in a similar way to those economists who began to call the US bubble in the early 2000s half a decade before it popped. There was no pop when they said there would be, and bubble calls began to seem ridiculous, like a boy crying wolf - and people said 'I've been hearing about this bubble pop for years' and told themselves it's not going to happen.  After 2010 we started to see a huge upswing in foreign (primarily Chinese) investors hoping to cash in, as the bubble accelerated and returns started to look unstoppable. They're by no means the cause - rather they're a symptom, but of course this increase in investment has compounded the problem. Domestic investors - suffering from fear of missing out - also piled in, and the disparity between those looking to buy a home and those looking for an easy buck increased.  More recently, just as house prices have reached at least 5 times the annual income (at least) and wages have stagnated, the economy has started to sour - with mining dying a slow death and China floundering on the back of its own highly manipulated smoke and mirrors economy (the current PM of China came out in 2007 and said Chinese economic data like GDP growth was basically bullshit and inflated by the government, so who the fuck knows if China's economy is on the verge of a crash). Rents have stalled in Australia due to high investor competition. Vacancy rates are at record highs. Strong signs of an oversupply have become apparent - one of the main catalysts for most post-bubble crashes (people stand around crying 'much be an undersupply' with only rising prices as their evidence, then all of a sudden BAM - oversupply becomes obvious, people suddenly shit a collective brick).   We're at the stage where we're getting a few bubble deniers, but many people have realised what's happening (this massive spike in public interest also preceded the US, Irish and Spanish crashes). Property is no longer looking like such a great investment to many. The economy is skating dangerously close to recession. Migration to Australia is dropping significantly (it's looking to be unexpectedly down to 1.3% from a projected 1.7% this year). And once prices do start to fall, the investors will want to be the first out the door - all at once. We're really just waiting for the inevitable pin right now, which might come when the US raises rates, it might come as our economy nosedives, it might come when we raise rates - who knows."

Wind and small scale solar have no real future until battery technology becomes more cost efficient and cost effective.

But combine patriarchal stipulations in Islam, the threat of infinite hellfire, strong patriarchal Arab influences (it did originate in the Arab world, after all) and it's very, very testing.

australia,3dsyep,quim-font,2,Sun Jul 19 08:44:33 2015 UTC,"Muslim women wearing head coverings only became widespread in the 19th century. Before that it was rare and done to signify high social status - not for modesty as now.   Not true at all. Head coverings have been worn from since the time of the prophet of Islam. A look at the earliest Islamic historical sources the hadith shows us many cases of head coverings being used in the time of the prophet.   Bukhari: Narrated 'Aisha:  Allah's Apostle used to offer the Fajr prayer and some believing women covered with their veiling sheets used to attend the Fajr prayer with him and then they would return to their homes unrecognized.  We can see from this example that not only were head coverings used but it was also done as a means of modesty hence the term ""unrecognized"".   As well as this we can also study the works of the various muslim scholars in early islamic history to see their thoughts on the Hijab. I can't speak for the Shia tradition but in the Sunni tradition all 4 major schools of jurisprudence (the maliki, hanbali, hanafi and Shafii) are in agreement about the ruling of Hijab. These schools of jurisprudence have existed for over a thousand years, so this idea that the Hijab is a modern innovation is absolutely absurd.  A case study can be shown in early Islamic scholar Ibn Kathir's(c1300, 1374) exegesis of the Quran. Here's a translation from his exegesis which discusses a particular verse in the Quran which he interprets as giving a ruling on hijab.   And so to conclude, the hijab is not a recent thing. Its been used by muslim women historically. It was not a fashionable piece of clothing that was worn every now and then - muslim women had to by the law. As for this idea that it wasn't meant for modesty, firstly use some common sense - if you wanted to flaunt that you have awesome social status, why would you put a scarf over your hair? A more sensible option would be to wear a tiara. If you wanted to have some modesty, a sensible thing to do would be to cover up. Furthermore a study of historical sources and exegeses by early muslim scholars will show that it was an item of clothing whose primary telos was that of modesty."

Also just the type of people who are in Reclaim Australia are bigoted in general so any kind of equality they seem to be rooting for is probably bullshit.

I think you vastly overestimate how many people care, though that's understandable considering the media around the subject. Another factor to consider is the Netherlands and more recently France, I'd say the goings on in those nations is enough to draw a negative conclusion albeit a flawed one but not totally without merit. what do you propose we do about the extremists that literally want the downfall of the Australian government in favor of one under an Islamic administration? Follow up question; how do you propose that the average citizen should discern between a group of extremists that define themselves by their religion and a member of that same religion that also defines themselves by it and adheres to strange and foreign teachings they don't understand and are generally contrary to their own beliefs - at least without the context an education on the subject would provide. Iran was arguably the most liberal place in the world until the Islamic revolution occurred, to be fair the Americans are largely at fault there but most people don't actually know that which brings me to my next point: Most people don't know jack shit about Islam and they don't care, what they do care about is when the trusted man on the news tells them that a bunch Muslims flew a couple planes into some buildings, or blew up a train station or night club, you never hear of any Chinese doing that.

australia,3dsyep,FXOjafar,-2,Sun Jul 19 04:39:15 2015 UTC,"I think people would feel better if most Muslim countries weren't shit holes   Yeah you're right.

Another factor to consider is the Netherlands and more recently France, I'd say the goings on in those nations is enough to draw a negative conclusion albeit a flawed one but not totally without merit   Absolutely. No argument there. In my opinion what has happened here is solid case of mismanaged immigration. My view is that these countries have thrown open their borders and have not exhibited first the discretion necessary in making sure you're not importing fundos and secondly they have not provided the upskilling and employment support necessary to prevent low educational and employment outcomes in these communities, which has gone on to backfire spectacularly in the form of rampant extremism and crime endemic to those areas. I don't think similar will happen in australia simply because most of our muslims are from relatively wealthy (read educated) backgrounds and they place a higher value on education and getting prestigious jobs (any muslim commerce student can weigh in here)   what do you propose we do about the extremists that literally want the downfall of the Australian government in favor of one under an Islamic administration?   Fuck em. Treat them how you would treat christians who want a fundamentalist christian theocracy. (read watch very closely and arrest when they do something stupid).

Iran   Come the fuck on bro. You KNOW what happened there. What you may not know is that the mossadegh was a liberal and extremely well loved by the people. When he was *ahem ""removed"" everyone hated his replacement, the shah, who was massively corrupt. At this point, the only political group organised enough and with the necessary public profile to actively oppose the shah's secret police was the clerics. Can you really blame the iranians if they chose a slightly less bloody alternative to assembling their own liberal-democratic institutions while facing down the Shah's US backed thugs?

Just a few things I take issue with:   I would assume that the propping up of dictators, the assassinations of responsible leaders (mossadegh in iran for example) would point to a certain conclusion.   Not really sure why you wrote that, I'm aware of Iran's fall from grace which is why I addressed it earlier. I wouldn't consider being toppled by the CIA a justification for being a shit hole.

The fact that as the majority Muslim populated countries are across the board ""shit holes"" can't exactly be discarded (as much as I would like to) when assessing the situation.

The threat from extremists is certainly not overrated, they act to spread terror through acts of terrorism we wouldn't be having this conversation if such acts were not wildly successful in spreading terror, ignorance and intolerance amongst the Australian populace.

I'm not sure wealth disparity should be directly tied to this issue, we're not talking about your average Australian Muslim here, we're talking about a minority of extremists and I'm not sure the two subjects correlate in any meaningful manner.   Fundos does indeed refer to fundamentalists. And yes mistakes have been made, evident by the number of idiots overseas atm.   I really don't think it's so much wealth disparity but education levels. A higher educated person is more likely to not fall for extremism than someone with a comparatively lower understanding of things because it's likely they've been exposed to different view-points and most importantly have interacted with people of a different faith before. So yeah, there is a problem minority and currently we're taking a top down approach as a community, making sure to denounce their ideology during friday sermons and try to engage with them from a theological perspective to ""bring them back into the fold"" so to speak.  There are indeed groups promoting such, I would point to the Lords Resistance Army and even america's nasty issue with fundo-christians forming militias and the like. As to the threat level, I agree with you. It is important to understand that the division and hatred sowed with every act is the end goal, as opposed to the attritional loss of lives or property. So we are facing a terrorist threat, but there needs to be a paradigm shift so that we understand how exactly we're being affected.  Yeah the downvote brigade did arrive.

australia,3dsyep,revoltactionsuit,3,Sun Jul 19 16:20:11 2015 UTC,"I think the problem here is it is more nuanced than a single post in a single forum can handle. Islam has specific tenants about spreading the faith in earth and having a totally Muslim world, this is similar to Christianity's belief that revelation will consume the while world but in islam the apocalypse can't happen until all are Muslims. This religious doctrine is something which doesn't have to influence your behaviour to make people uncomfortable, just as not everyone practices yum kupur or sacrificing birds to appease god. The point is that if the doctrine is there, in the texts, it is easy for an outsider to see how that may be used.   In my mind, the fact that Islam is untrue and yet has so many devout believers is more disturbing. There are so many clear issues with Islam, as with Christianity, and yet Christianity has been dragged kicking and screaming through the Reformation and I don't see that happening with Islam. I sincerely hope that the youth of the world will continue growing out if religion as they have in the past ten years, but the level of censorship which Wahhabi Muslims enforce makes it difficult to see change happening in the middle east, and the fact that we are so politically correct as to not even discuss politics and religion in public makes me fear for the children of new Australians.   To have a brighter future I think we need as much discussion as possible, comparative religion should be a compulsory subject perhaps under the banner of humans and their culture, and it would have to focus on a few major religions, Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, as well as a few smaller ones, Mormonism, Jainism, Buddhism. This would give people perspective that not only are there people who disagree, but the vast majority of people disagree with you, no matter what religion you believe in."

australia,3dsyep,TheCapriciousLeper,6,Sun Jul 19 11:38:01 2015 UTC,"There is an important point I would like to make. Islam in its form today is completely misguided and practiced in a manner that is contradictory to its early form.   Sharia Law and law within Islam does not have instruments of corporal punishment. The Quran is the only scripture that is regarded as ""holy"" by muslims, but it comes second to the Hadiths in relation to what most muslims follow as guidelines.   The Hadiths are absolute rubbish, made up fallacies that may have a line in them or two that may be accurate, but that is finding a needle in a haystack and therefore irrelevant. Not once is ""stoning"" mentioned in the Quran. There is no such thing has chopping off of hands for punishment. The verse relates to ""cutting off two or more of thieves hands"", which in Arab translations point to cutting off resources. The Hadiths are what has lead the Islamic world to mimic a medieval gore fest.   There are muslims called Quranists, who reject everything and anything that is Hadith or any other man made work. The fact of the matter is, most Qurans are translated with Hadith as a guide and therefore lead to very matter of fact translations.   Sooner people know this, the better. Obviously lots of muslims would disagree here, but just have a look at the Muslim world right now and I dare you to tell me they are on the right path..."
australia,3dsyep,StephieBubbles,6,Sun Jul 19 04:56:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah my personal opinion is that this is the dark ages for Islam.

As for OP, it ain't fucking rocket science, stop blowing things up or joining murderous crazy fucks and Islam will be just another religion."
australia,3dsyep,Swazzgoblin,9,Sun Jul 19 08:49:45 2015 UTC,"Yup, agreed. Islam had a Golden Age (which I was interested in and studied at Uni) in which they advanced in lots of fields including mathematics, translations of literary texts and science etc, they even translated greek philosophy back then, in which now they would claim to be complete heretic literature that should be burnt and not learnt and built upon, whilst Europe was busy working out ways how to torture people for longer and slower.  Now it is the direct opposite. The West is in its absolute Golden Age. whilst the Islamic world is in its Dark Ages, absolutely no doubt about it. So violent and barbaric under the guise of religion, with the most frustrating fact being their ""sharia law"" is primarily composed from Hadiths that are not even ""holy"" sources. Just hear say, of what his uncle heard her cousins, grandma's uncle once hear the prophet say etc...  The US has also meddled in the ME affairs and ISIS is a byproduct, with the end result being a Kurdish state, which will further ruin the region for another 100 years.   I mean look at the burqa, the full face covering. What on earth is that? That is not religion. It is absolutely misogyny. In the Quran, never is it stated to cover your face...heck even a hijab, the way it worn today is not exactly described. It simply states to dress and cover modestly. Not become a walking tent with only your eyebrows visible. This is why Islam has become a laughing stock to the rest of the world. They follow absolute rubbish texts based on hear-say, written 400years later at the earliest, after the Quran. Whatever suits the agenda becomes = I heard my uncle say that my grandma once said etc..hilarious.  On top of that, there is a divide that is based on politics being Shia and Sunni. It is not a religious divide that many think, it is political. Imagine people fighting over if Tony Abbot's daughter should be next PM due to blood relation, or have a vote, it is just like that, the only difference being the leader was prophet Mohammed, which is the only religious context in this situation.   Another point is, in contemporary history, there has really never been a civilization that has made the most humanely possible dumb mistakes than the arabs. They betray the Turkish empire to Britain and France, then get tricked by the sykespicot, get carved up in regard to oil, and now what? They want it all back to normal? The US was taking their oil, without even paying them a % at one stage. Just giving them free cars and one off payments, can you fucking believe it?"

The first thing is that, it seems as if everyone cares about the muslims, both right and left sides of politics, but no one seems to be asking them anything.    I'm so glad you said this because everyone always talks about Islam like it's the fucked up kid of two parents going through a divorce, everyone always talks about what would be in its best interest without getting to understand it or talk to it. I've been talking to friends left and right and friends on the left vehemently defend Islam without actually having read anything about the religion, which really weakens the specificities of its defence because it feels more like they're doing it for their political agenda then some real passion for freedom of religion or the individuality of a religion with more than 1 billion practitioners."

A person is at least 35,000 times more likely to die of cancer. A study in the US found people there were 9 times more likely to be shot by a cop than to die in a terrorist attack.

australia,3dsyep,SkruffPortion,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:06:17 2015 UTC,"I don't really know what you're referring to with the towers, but raping 9 year olds?   ""is the hadith about Aisha RA. I'll just cut and paste below but if you see the analysis of the hadith you see that it can't really be backed. That would be an example where the chain of narration is weak and we cannot trust the hadith. ""Most important: it is probably inaccurate. Several analyses of other accounts, and other things Aisha(ra) and those around her reported witnessing give significantly differing estimates of her age. And the reports that say she was a young child have some issues. Most of these narratives are reported only by Hisham ibn urwah reporting on the authority of his father. An event as well known as the one being reported, should logically have been reported by more people than just one, two or three. It is quite strange that no one from Medinah, where Hisham ibnurwah lived the first seventy one years of his life has narrated the event, even though in Medinah his pupils included people as well known as Malik ibn Anas. All the narratives of this event have been reported by narrators from Iraq, where Hisham is reported to have had shifted after living in Medinah for seventy one years. Tehzibu'l-tehzib, one of the most well known books on the life and reliability of the narrators of the traditions of the Prophet (pbuh) reports that according to Yaqub ibn Shaibah: ""narratives reported by Hisham are reliable except those that are reported through the people of Iraq"". It further states that Malik ibn Anas objected on those narratives of Hisham which were reported through people of Iraq. (vol 11, pg 48 - 51) Mizanu'l-aitidal, another book on the narrators of the traditions of the Prophet (pbuh) reports that when he was old, Hisham's memory suffered quite badly. (vol 4, pg 301 - 302) According to the generally accepted tradition, Ayesha (ra) was born about eight years before Hijrah. But according to another narrative in Bukhari (kitabu'l-tafseer) Ayesha (ra) is reported to have said that at the time Surah Al-Qamar, the 54th chapter of the Qur'an, was revealed, ""I was a young girl"". The 54th surah of the Qur'an was revealed nine years before Hijrah. According to this tradition, Ayesha (ra) had not only been born before the revelation of the referred surah, but was actually a young girl (jariyah), not an infant (sibyah) at that time. Obviously, if this narrative is held to be true, it is in clear contradiction with the narratives reported by Hisham ibn 'urwah. I see absolutely no reason that after the comments of the experts on the narratives of Hisham ibn 'urwah, why we should not accept this narrative to be more accurate. According to a number of narratives, Ayesha (ra) accompanied the Muslims in the battle of Badr and Uhud. Furthermore, it is also reported in books of hadith and history that no one under the age of 15 years was allowed to take part in the battle of Uhud. All the boys below 15 years of age were sent back. Ayesha's (ra) participation in the battle of Badr and Uhud clearly indicate that she was not nine or ten years old at that time. After all, women used to accompany men to the battle fields to help them, not to be a burden on them. According to almost all the historians Asma (ra), the elder sister of Ayesha (ra) was ten years older than Ayesha (ra). It is reported in Taqri'bu'l-tehzi'b as well as Al-bidayah wa'l-nihayah that Asma (ra) died in 73 hijrah when she was 100 years old. Now, obviously if Asma (ra) was 100 years old in 73 hijrah she should have been 27 or 28 years old at the time of hijrah. If Asma (ra) was 27 or 28 years old at the time of hijrah, Ayesha (ra) should have been 17 or 18 years old at that time. Thus, Ayesha (ra), if she got married in 1 AH (after hijrah) or 2 AH, was between 18 to 20 years old at the time of her marriage. Tabari in his treatise on Islamic history, while mentioning Abu Bakr (ra) reports that Abu Bakr had four children and all four were born during the Jahiliyyah -- the pre Islamic period. Obviously, if Ayesha (ra) was born in the period of jahiliyyah, she could not have been less than 14 years in 1 AH -- the time she most likely got married. According to Ibn Hisham, the historian, Ayesha (ra) accepted Islam quite some time before Umar ibn Khattab (ra). This shows that Ayesha (ra) accepted Islam during the first year of Islam. While, if the narrative of Ayesha's (ra) marriage at seven years of age is held to be true, Ayesha (ra) should not have been born during the first year of Islam. Tabari has also reported that at the time Abu Bakr planned on migrating to Habshah (8 years before Hijrah), he went to Mut'am -- with whose son Ayesha (ra) was engaged -- and asked him to take Ayesha (ra) in his house as his son's wife. Mutam refused, because Abu Bakr had embraced Islam, and subsequently his son divorced Ayesha (ra). Now, if Ayesha (ra) was only seven years old at the time of her marriage, she could not have been born at the time Abu Bakr decided on migrating to Habshah. On the basis of this report it seems only reasonable to assume that Ayesha (ra) had not only been born 8 years before hijrah, but was also a young lady, quite prepared for marriage. According to a narrative reported by Ahmad ibn Hanbal, after the death of Khadijah (ra), when Khaulah (ra) came to the Prophet (pbuh) advising him to marry again, the Prophet (pbuh) asked her regarding the choices she had in her mind. Khaulah said: ""You can marry a virgin (bikr) or a woman who has already been married (thayyib)"". When the Prophet (pbuh) asked about who the virgin was, Khaulah proposed Ayesha's (ra) name. All those who know the Arabic language, are aware that the word ""bikr"" in the Arabic language is not used for an immature nine year old girl. The correct word for a young playful girl, as stated earlier is ""Jariyah"". ""Bikr"" on the other hand, is used for an unmarried lady, and obviously a nine year old is not a ""lady"". According to Ibn Hajar, Fatimah (ra) was five years older than Ayesha (ra). Fatimah (ra) is reported to have been born when the Prophet (pbuh) was 35 years old. Thus, even if this information is taken to be correct, Ayesha (ra) could by no means be less than 14 years old at the time of hijrah, and 15 or 16 years old at the time of her marriage.""  there you go. A pretty comprehensive rebuttal of that misconception. You probably won't read it though."
australia,3dsyep,Tovora,2,Sun Jul 19 16:04:11 2015 UTC,"I get what you're saying. To me the remarkable thing is the absence of political violence in Australia in the context of global events.  And I won't bother to address the meatheads from RA, who are just the puppets of people like Murdoch and Abbott.  Kind of funny that it probaly isn't acceptable for 'apolitical' local Muslims to point out that the Liberal Party is constantly stoking racism and hatred to fulfill its agenda of distracting the population from their real agenda of building a two-class society.  BUT, Australia is traditionally a secular country, at least since the Catholic/Protestant thing was left behind in the 1960s. Australians are not used to the sight of large numbers of people whose dress is determined by their religion. We have some whacky Christian cults where I live, and they would suffer much the same misunderstandings if seen in larger numbers in white anglo enclaves of major cities.  Especially if members of those cults were leading an attack on civilisation in multiple countries. Now of course the West has destablised the Middle East and created the conditions for what's going on, but the fact is there is a lot of evil going on in other countries in the name of Islam.  You can say this is a perversion of Islam, but to outsiders that doesn't, and shouldn't, matter.  Because religion is a man-made thing.  The Catholic church chronically protects child molesters. There are no excuses for this, least of all claiming  'those child molesters are not following Catholicism'. The fact is the church functions as a structure to promote and protect this. As long as Islam cannot excommunicate or expel those committing acts of calculated and attention-seeking brutality, people in mostly non-Islamic societies will be scared. Indeed, that's exactly the intention of the violent ones, with the Liberals and News Limited happy to oblige.  I'd suggest you become an athiest.  If God is real, He will understand you doing that given the shit men are throwing around in His name."
australia,3dsyep,staffs,-4,Mon Jul 20 00:11:32 2015 UTC,"hahaha well played. The evangelising sting in the tail. Haven't seen that one before. But by and large you are right. Muslims are denied a voice by the media and the whole christensen fiasco has probably eroded whatever trust they had left in the government and authorities by now.  Australia is indeed a secular country. No one is arguing against that, least of all 2% of the population who consider themselves muslims.  Islam is indeed the focal point. But I'd argue that the ""attack on civilisation"" is outgoing rather than incoming. The middle east has never really righted itself after artificial borders which gave no heed to existing ethnic realities on the ground where arbitrarily drawn in 1948. This has been compounded by the systemic propping up of dictators and the treatment of the middle-east as the US military industrial complex's personal sandpit. Islam has been weaponised to deal with what they over there see as a literally existential threat. I'd point you towards inquiring into the history of wahabbism, which is the doctrine to blame for the brand of fundamentalist islam responsible for compounding the issue. It is actually a relatively new interpretation, birthed as near as the 1800's in egypt. It was given the profile and wide-spread approval it enjoys by the saudi government, in itself worthy of a post. I'd be glad to explain if you're curious.  All that being said, I did highlight that the faith as it stands in australia and the world suffers from systemic problems. This is something we are slowly waking up to as muslims and the issues are beginning to be addressed."

australia,3dwg5h,ozr3dditor,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:38:18 2015 UTC,"Regardless of whether it's tennis, cricket, football, whatever, money is the name of the game, and sportsmanship has long gone by the board.  It's win at all cost.  However, having said that, serious consideration has to be given to the way umpires/referees behave!  How often do we see umpires/referees make the wrong call that costs a player/team victory?  How ""independent""/un-corrupted are the officials?  Almost every week we see umpires/referees make mistakes, and surely any player has the right to contest the decision, especially seeing the amounts of money involved.  With all of the available technology/video replays and so on, there is no reason a game should not be 'held-up' so that a proper review of an umpire/referee's decision is undertaken and can be examined.  Of course, folk will argue that it disrupts the flow of the game/slows it down, or whatever, and may cost the broadcasters money, especially when it is a 'time defined event', but surely, having the right outcome, where the winner is actually the winner, is more important than other commercial considerations. This doesn't mean I condone the bad behaviour and violent actions, like smashing rackets, of any player in any sport, but given the pressure they are under to win, having truly independent and highly qualified umpires/referees is essential."

That was a long time ago. She pretty much destroyed that chance in 2000 and lost her ministerial position in 2001. That's 5 years on the backbench and months prior being a front bencher in exile.   She's surrounded by yes-men with no backbone. Nobody, other than potentially Abbott, seems willing to fight on her behalf. There's blood in the water and politicians are sharks."

As one of those people I feel I should state that Much better is an overstatement.  Turnbull is a worm, and a pretty neoliberal worm who loves his privatization agenda.  But he is also more cognizant of the differing forces of the party room and the popular vote and you see it every time he tries to walk the tight rope in an Interview.  In this way he's a lot like the Labor front bench, and one could expect that if he was leader AND he had managed to reduce the power of the conservative backbench he would more then likely tend away from the far right in line with the public opinion in order to stay electable, that's just the kind of person he is.  He isn't a great choice, he's just not on the same hardcore right wing level that most of Tony's front bench of unrepentant aristocrats are, he at least know that a revolution of the poor could see him hanged so he want to avoid inflaming that fire."

Like in the last referendum there doesn't seem to be clear message from the Republican movement especially in regards to the election of the new Head of State.  At the moment it seems they have a large scale idea, but that isn't going to win a referendum.   Further, calling monarchists morons doesn't exactly help the cause which it appears you seem to believe in. While yes, monarchs have been horrific rulers in the past the present system restricts the powers of the monarch to virtually a symbolic role. And in any case not all democratically elected leaders have been saints throughout history either. Lastly, I don't see how King Edwards political views are relevant to Queen Elizabeth.

Quite literally the same value that underpins racism and eugenics.  To think that our politicians are busy calling Queen Elizabeth ""Your Highness"" when this is a woman whose uncle and recent predecessor in the role was a fucking Nazi and whose son is a moron who not only advocates for ""alternative remedies"" (aka quack bullshit that costs lives) but violates the separation of powers by advocating for it to government ministers.

I'm struggling to realise how the British Royal Family can be seen as dictators when they have no real power.   monarchies are undemocratic incarnations of nepotisms, afforded the highest privileges and perks in their countries by virtue of being born that way.   That can be said of the kin of ANY super-rich family. Being born into wealth and luxury is just a thing that happens to some people. Just as being born white and male is seen to many as a perk and privilege. As for the: ""highest privileges and perks in their countries"", with reference to the British Royal family, they own Crown Land, and the money from that land is surrendered to the UK government in exchange for a fixed income. It's obviously very lucrative to the British parliament. No government in their right mind would uphold tradition in favour of profit if they had their way.  What I am curious about, however, is how ditching the Constitutional Monarchy in favour of a Republic will benefit our situation. Aside from your obvious moral qualms with Kings and Queens and privilege, how does leaving the Commonwealth affect the average person?   When your best argument is ""I don't feel the current system is bad so why change it,"" you know your position is horrid.   What's so horrid about it?

They inherited and continue to enjoy the legacy of abhorrent dictators. That's the reason they're royals, because their ancestors were good at taking power and keeping it hereditary.    That can be said of the kin of ANY super-rich family.   Difference is, wealth from rich families has to be maintained and invested in most cases. Look at how many once-great families have been reduced to a shadow of their former glory because their descendants were profligate or simply didn't have the business sense to expand or maintain their wealth?   None of those families have their status or influence statutorily protected. None of those families have the symbolic but incredibly significant right to assent to the laws of our democracy. None of those families are given the right to be called ""Your Highness"" for fuck's sake.

australia,3dt1qp,endbit,40,Sun Jul 19 11:05:35 2015 UTC,"Because signing petitions worked so well when 1/4 of a million people signed to keep FTTH NBN? Give it up already, this government doesn't give a damn about the people, 'digital graffiti' and especially petitions."
australia,3dt1qp,azz808,22,Sun Jul 19 14:48:26 2015 UTC,"That is true, but it doesn't hurt to sign.  At least it puts some pressure on Government at some level.  Better than letting them think no one gives a shit at least."
australia,3dt1qp,endbit,8,Sun Jul 19 06:20:40 2015 UTC,They might put some pressure on a government with a conscience which is why these petitions have zero effect on the current government.   I agree with the bit about not letting them think people don't give a shit. The best way to do that is to spam their mailboxes with a personal message directly rather than signing some petition they will simply ignore. I've written a lot more letters under this government than any other for some reason...
australia,3dt1qp,azz808,8,Sun Jul 19 06:35:15 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's about conscience.  More that if it keeps hitting papers, social media and there's a petition with 100,000 signatures on it, it becomes a lot harder for them to not do something about an issue.  It's the same reason you'll often see unpopular policy announced on Friday afternoons for example.  It's not because they feel bad, but because they would like to minimise negative sentiment."
australia,3dt1qp,endbit,6,Sun Jul 19 06:59:36 2015 UTC,"That's a fair point but our media treats this government as a protected species and even when the NBN petition did hit the media it was just ignored with a wave of the hand.   Color me jaded but I've given up on petitions and just write letters, then rewrite them to remove the swear words."

australia,3dt1qp,-lumpinator-,10,Sun Jul 19 15:58:46 2015 UTC,Why should we give up? Only because they ignore it? They ignore pretty much everyone that doesn't donate to them. Giving up is not an option.
australia,3dt1qp,endbit,2,Sun Jul 19 21:45:05 2015 UTC,"I'd certainly never suggest giving up quite the opposite. Just make your effort a little more meaningful, write your local member or the PM's office, join a party even. Anything would be more useful than signing yet another useless change.org petition.   Don't get me wrong I'd be totally behind it if even one petition had had an influence in the past but as the NBN petition, the largest petition I've seen, clearly demonstrates they are completely useless."
australia,3dt1qp,-lumpinator-,4,Sun Jul 19 07:08:32 2015 UTC,"Not saying there aren't other more efficient ways. However, if the petition gains enough traction it gets mentioned in the media.  Just because the government ignores certain things, doesn't mean they are completely useless (they pretty much ignore everything anyway). For example that NBN petition showed that the government doesn't give a shit about what the people really want. Might have cost them quite a few votes."
australia,3dt1qp,jnd-au,4,Sun Jul 19 07:46:19 2015 UTC,"A big reason petitions fail is apathy: so few people sign them. The largest petition was 1.2 million, and it was successful. The next largest was quite a lot smaller. There are 14 million voters, so 0.25 million is small fry."

One failed petition because of egregious pricks being elected for the communications portfolio does not render this an invalid tool of attack. The apathy you feel is precisely the kind of numbing effect they want: why bother to protest, they will just do worse!  The thing is, a lot of these people are going to be held to account soon: 6 August 2016 or nearabouts. The being held to account won't be enough; though it is not legal to allow feral starving dogs to gnaw at the leaders who have failed us to date; but it will allow a flushing of the political toilet - enough so at least steaming fresh matter may be injected at the top of the process.

Most people who sign it already know it will not change things alone, but the mounting public opinion as a whole will.

australia,3dt4xy,nath1234,18,Sun Jul 19 05:06:55 2015 UTC,"Here's the text:  Tony Abbott Doorstop: Peter Slipper MP  21/04/12 EO&E..............................................................................................................................................................  TONY ABBOTT:  The Speaker is the guardian of parliamentary standards. The Speakership is one of the most important offices in the Parliament. The Speaker is there to uphold the integrity of the Parliament and now we have very, very serious allegations against the incumbent Speaker, allegations of sexual harassment and allegations of potentially criminal misuse of entitlements. These are very serious allegations indeed. Yes, the Speaker is entitled to the presumption of innocence but he does have quite a lot of explaining to do.  It‚Äôs also very important that the Prime Minister act to ensure the integrity of the Parliament. The Speaker is only in that office because the Prime Minister used her numbers late last year to install him. The Prime Minister, to uphold the integrity of the Parliament, needs now to require the Speaker to step down until these matters are resolved.  It‚Äôs also incumbent upon the Australian Federal Police to swiftly investigate the potentially criminal allegations that have been made against the Speaker.   I can‚Äôt underestimate the seriousness of this. The Speaker is required to maintain parliamentary standards and yet there are now these extremely serious allegations against the Speaker himself. So in order to maintain the respect and the reputation of the Parliament, in order to preserve the integrity of the Government and our institutions, it is very important that the Prime Minister act swiftly to require the Speaker to step aside and it‚Äôs very important that the Australian Federal Police quickly investigate these matters so that they can be resolved as soon as is humanly possible.  QUESTION: So these aren‚Äôt the first allegations against him. Should this have been dealt with a long time ago?  TONY ABBOTT: Well these are matters that have been referred to a court. These are matters where legal documents have been lodged. These are matters that are now to be the subject of proceedings in court, so these are of a vastly more serious and substantial nature than anything that has been alleged against Mr Slipper in the past.  QUESTION: After everything that‚Äôs been going on with Craig Thomson, I suppose the question is, you know, where to from here? Does she need to make a stand now?  TONY ABBOTT: Well this does go to the integrity not just of the Parliament but of the Prime Minister and of the Government. The Prime Minister cannot wash her hands of this business the way she has tried to wash her hands of the allegations concerning Mr Thomson because Mr Slipper is no mere backbencher. Mr Slipper is the Speaker of the Parliament. Mr Slipper occupies a very, very important office. He is the guardian of the standards of the Parliament, the protector of the reputation of the Parliament and now there are these extremely serious allegations against him and that‚Äôs why the only proper way forward is for the Speaker to step aside while these allegations are being dealt with. If he doesn‚Äôt do so voluntarily, the Prime Minister should indicate that she will require him to step aside until these matters are resolved.  QUESTION: Do you have any thoughts on who should take his place while the investigation is ongoing?  TONY ABBOTT: Well, as a matter of ordinary parliamentary procedure, if the Speaker is unable to take the chair, the senior Deputy Speaker automatically would take the chair.  [ends]"

It seems to me that the taxation recipe they're advocating will only further politicise Government social expenditure by making the taxation fair only if the low income households were fully compensated instead of having fairness built into the system as in the case of progressive taxation.
australia,3duhgf,douhua,12,Sun Jul 19 17:34:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah, right.    Raising the GST would not be unfair, as critics argue, if low income households were fully compensated, he said: ""For those who can least afford it, if they knew they were going to be compensated, then they'd be fine. For the rest who can afford it, they probably have a greater appetite to pay a GST than other punitive taxes, like income taxes.""   ""punitive"" ... I suppose someone in this accounting wonk's tax-bracket might think so AND it makes his job easier. Win-win for him and his ilk.

Bracket creep has been easily fixed in the past by any government seeking popular approval by unilaterally adjusting income tax bracket rates and thresholds.   This is part of a concerted plan to shift overall tax shares from higher earners onto consumers.  Higher earners will pay less tax and as this won't increase their propensity to consume there will be no economy boost there. Instead those on low or no income will fill the gap with higher GST on everything. And concessions can be later as easily unilaterally adjusted as are income tax thresholds now whereas any changes to GST are a political bunfight.  This is an ambit claim from the big end of town. I hope the States will see it for what it is."

She doesn't allow as much of the normal bullshit back and forth, keeping both sides (more) on point.  It's a pity however, how she's handled her position outside of parliament (e.g. transport). At least in the meantime she's apologised, repaid the costs and initial fine. Her interview was to the point, giving no evidence she's unfit for the speaker's chair. Suggesting that she wasn't aware of the figure until it was published and that they charter was organised by her office. From this she concluded that it was an error of judgement, and I'm sure that there will be no repeat of this mistake. This must be the 10th time I've seen this same story. It would be great to just leave it until the Royal Commission are finished with their investigation, and in the meantime focus on actual politics.  edit - I'm not bias towards the Labour or Liberal Parties. And my viewing of her in parliament is in my opinion fair and just. If you have videos proving an unfair warning or ejection of a member that would be welcome to disproving/proving my point. Otherwise if you're down-voting me because you disagree with things she's done outside of parliament sessions, I'd implore you to focus on the job she does when parliament is in session and leave the rest in another thread.  edit2 - I'm sure there are a number of errors that have been made by Bishop outside of Parliament.

Although it seems silly, much of the political heckling comes in forms like that (across all parties). And Bishop is stamping much of that out.  Again, she's cutting the bullshit and making an example out of someone to ensure that it doesn't happen again. I haven't seen laughter to that extent used tactfully to prolong and/or support an issue since. She noted that this had become an issue within parliament, put her foot down, warned all members of Parliament, Labor was the primary side laughing with the member for Franklin seemingly starting it."

If you watch a recording of that parliament online, I'm sure you would agree that Bishop was in the right.  http://www.news.com.au/national/mrs-bishop-has-now-kicked-out-309-mps-304-from-labor-in-15-months/story-fncynjr2-1227216299822 - Shows how disrespectful some of the Labor MP's are in being evicted.  That final article sums up what I like about Bishop in the first sentence. ""NO-NONSENSE Speaker Bronwyn Bishop..."". Any more evidence would just be watching Parliament. I honestly can't think of an unbiased eviction of Labor MP's if you have one please show me. I believe that the combination of Bishop being ""no-nonsense"" and Labor being in the opposition position, often more likely to speak out and attack the government, are how these record evictions are being pulled. Most of them are during question time, and from the articles linked are the most famous ""bias"" evictions of Labor MP's."
australia,3dsao1,one_buffalo,2,Sun Jul 19 12:30:22 2015 UTC,"This article shows more depth into Labor's poor behaviour in that ""infectious laughter"" debacle. Christopher Pyne had used the words ‚Äúdeceit‚Äù and ‚Äúdishonesty‚Äù and when Labor demanded he withdraw, the speaker remarked that it was language allowed in the previous parliament.   It also shows the bias in ruling words synonymous with lie in a personal attack to be fine. Pyne withdrew voluntarily, without speakers intervention.   Fairing of Kevin Rudd, showing great respect for a Labor MP   I interpreted this as theatre. Without greater context of that sitting and a fair few before it, I couldn't be certain either way.   Re-explaining her role, and defending herself on liberal-bias comments on QandA.   The fact she went on QandA aside, I found it obvious from her speech that she was distinctly making us/them comments regarding the two parties. She was conciliatory in that she recognised the oppositions position is to make life hard for the government but ended the discussion with personal attack on Anna Burke. Saying she was ""Disappointed, that as a former speaker..."" Instead of continuing to address the issue, its looked like a cheap parting shot where none was required.   This article shows her taking the first coalition member rightfully so, (granted up to date she has only thrown out 7 non labor members) and also explains her under-fire for the private function and exonerates her citing an example of a Labor speaker years ago did the same thing.   MP Jones definitely deserved it, but what of Pyne? He just walked up and insulted a member of the opposition antagonistically, Bishop didnt even bat an eye let alone ask him to withdraw it until Shorten insisted. As for Labor speaker examples, tradition is poor(failure of) logic for her to justify anything.   His article illustrates Labor MP stating that Bishop is the most bias speaker ever, and implies that they didn't do anything wrong. If you watch a recording of that parliament online, I'm sure you would agree that Bishop was in the right.   I think this statement in that article sums it up. Name-calling in parliament is routine, and disciplinary action is at the whim of the speaker. Wrong or no the standards are definitely not applied equally across both parties.   Shows how disrespectful some of the Labor MP's are in being evicted.  Usually Speakers, including the current one, act quickly to stop MPs using ‚Äúprops‚Äù in Parliament. But this time Mrs Bishop didn‚Äôt intervene and even refused to recognise Labor protests.   It was my impression he was doing that as a kind of protest against the speaker. As the article mentioned the speaker made no move to stop Julie Bishop from belittling her counterpart using props in parliament. Childish of Dreyfus to leave in that way maybe but neither was it a whim.  I can see enough in what was provided to show her partisanship, not on the level that is commonly reported referencing the ejection count alone though."
australia,3dsao1,Wykar,6,Sun Jul 19 23:49:27 2015 UTC,"keeping both sides (more) on point.   The statistics seem to show Government MPs are obedient, placid and largely silent. Only a handful have been ejected. Labor MPs have been kicked out by the Speaker 400 times in the life of this Parliament, a record."
australia,3dsao1,Leadback,-9,Sun Jul 19 04:41:45 2015 UTC,"I would disagree, or rather I think that statistic is misleading. Watching parliament about once a week this year,  I've seen that the Government MP's are not as ""obedient, placid and largely silent"" as a group. Many of these warnings are given when there is a group uproar, and many inappropriate comments are thrown about. There's always a lot of heckling from both sides. I've found that the Liberal members more often heed the warnings than not as they mostly have to defend their own decisions. While the Labour members get extra warnings, taking extra digs at the Abbott Gov. that are often loosely connected to their questions during question time.  From watching this year, I don't believe any of her warnings I've seen are unfair and nor her ejections. It's my opinion, which I'm sure is going to get downvoted, that she's taking a tighter rein on the parliament than previous speakers have."

australia,3dsao1,Leadback,-6,Sun Jul 19 05:05:43 2015 UTC,"Speaker Bronwyn Bishop under fire for hosting Liberal fundraisers in her Parliament House office.   Okay, firstly, I'm saying I appreciate her work as speaker when Parliament is in session. I already mentioned before that I think it's a pity how she's handled herself outside of parliament, your link is another example. Again, the Royal Commission is looking into her role as speaker and what she has done in that position. I'm just a believer that she is doing a good job of her main role in parliament  Secondly, regardless of track record, I was trying to state that both sides talk a lot of unnecessary shit towards each other and Bishop helps put that more under-raps. I believe that Liberal has an easier time because they generally just have to defend questions. Labour has to attack and then defend when Liberal rebuts. Neither side misses an opportunity to attack the other side, and there are a few repeat offenders in the Labour front and back benches that aren't getting away with their normal heckling strategies.  I'm not bias towards the Labour or Liberal Parties. And my viewing of her in parliament is in my opinion fair and just.

australia,3dsswi,Australosaurus,47,Sun Jul 19 02:52:06 2015 UTC,"Mr Hockey criticised Mrs Bishop for a second time, saying he has ""never heard of anyone"" doing such a thing in his party.   Wait... is this the same Hockey that has claimed $184,000 in allowances to sleep in his own house (bought under his wife's name), not including the double dipping when he charges colleagues to rent it with their allowance too? Or when Tony Abbott claimed travel expenses to attend a wedding?  I mean, good on him for calling out Bishop's expenses for what they are, but to imply that it's the only example of entitlement culture in the Liberal Party is stretching credibility a bit."
australia,3dsswi,WontThinkStraight,-9,Sun Jul 19 03:14:05 2015 UTC,"You certainly have a point with the Abbott claim, but the Hockey one was a bit of a beat up;   Under travel allowance rules, Mr Hockey is allowed to claim $271-a-night when he stays in Canberra   His use of the travel entitlement is allowed under the current rules and does not represent any improper use of his entitlements.   I'd say that you'd be hard pressed to find a politician from either side of the fence who would voluntarily give up an entitlement that formed a part of the conditions of their employment. If that was a requirement simply because his wife owned the place, then she would simply kick him out and rent the place to someone who would pay rent, and Hockey could use the entitlement to stay in a hotel like any other politician claiming the perfectly legal allowance.  It's hardly comparable to blowing $5k on a chopper ride."
australia,3dsswi,wallyupdabungenstein,24,Sun Jul 19 03:46:34 2015 UTC,"I have no issue with the entitlement (it's a cost of doing business when you're required to go to Canberra to represent your constituency) - I have an issue with how it's being used for self enrichment.  If the money was spent at a local business, it creates jobs and supports the local economy. If it goes into a politician's personal bank account, then it's a conflict of interest at best - which still wouldn't be acceptable.  It may be certainly ""within the rules"", but that to me says more about how lax the rules are... just like in the case of Bishop's spending."
australia,3dsswi,WontThinkStraight,-12,Sun Jul 19 03:50:25 2015 UTC,"Just because one politician chooses to use the entitlement to stay in a hotel, shouldn't bar another politician from using the same entitlement to pay off a mortgage on a house that he stays in. It costs the taxpayer the same.  And what's the difference whether he enriches a hotel owner, or the owner of a bed and breakfast, or the owner of a private residence? The food he eats comes from the local area, and there's no indication that the profits of the home owner are spent outside of Australia, any more than the profits of a hotelier."
australia,3dsswi,wallyupdabungenstein,14,Sun Jul 19 04:00:10 2015 UTC,"I don't disagree that it costs the taxpayers the same. And that's not the problem.  If there was a government contract worth $200k, and it didn't go out for bidding, but went to the wife of the politician signing the check, would we be happy with that? The cost is the same to the taxpayer. Perhaps the end result would even be the same.  It if were any other public servant, they would be under potential criminal investigation. If this were a member of public claiming welfare, it would be called ""rorting the system"" by ACA. I don't see why politicians should be held to a different standard... except for the fact the rules they have written for themselves allow them a hell of a lot more latitude.  Which is why we end up with a Speaker of the House that can't see at all why it's inappropriate to spend $5,000 on a helicopter ride (not even taking into account whether it was for ""official duties"" or not), or what the fuss is about."
australia,3dsswi,WontThinkStraight,-1,Sun Jul 19 04:08:34 2015 UTC,"it didn't go out for bidding   That's the crucial difference, and the only thing that would make it criminal.  Of course it should go out for bidding, and if his wife won the bidding then there's no reason she shouldn't get the contract.  What if Hockey owned a hotel. That's not against the rules. Is he obliged to give himself a free room, or should he be forced to stay in the hotel across the road to get the entitlement?  What if he only owned a 50% share in this hotel. You can't rip off the other stockholders, so does he have to give himself a 50% discount on the room, and reduce his own personal returns on the investment proportionally? Of course not. He wouldn't invest in a hotel in the first place if he had to give away rooms for free, and no one should be forced to give away accommodation for free"
australia,3dsswi,wallyupdabungenstein,2,Sun Jul 19 04:14:25 2015 UTC,"Yes he should stay across the road.  The perception of bias is to be avoided, just as much as any actual bias."
australia,3dsswi,Mahhrat,1 point,Sun Jul 19 06:35:59 2015 UTC,"If this were managed by a public bidding system (for the sake of argument), then I would have no issue with it at all, whether he has equity in the property or not. Because that way, at least the decision was done in a proper and fair manner, with any potential conflict of interest taken into consideration.  If Hockey owned a hotel and started sending business his own way without bidding, then there is a clear conflict of interest (even if the rules allow it). If the only reason he invested in the hotel was because he knew he could get the business without bidding, that's doubly so.  Is he entitled to do what he is doing? Yes, absolutely. It's within the rules.  Should he be doing what he's doing? If he wanted to be seen as an honest politician that isn't lining his own pockets, then no. It's not a good look."
australia,3dsswi,WontThinkStraight,3,Sun Jul 19 04:24:51 2015 UTC,"If the govt. provided the accommodation based on a bidding system, then I'd agree. But they don't.   I believe that the allowance is a set amount, regardless of what's spent. I don't think you don't have to provide receipts, and I'd imagine that if a minister can find cheaper accommodation, then they can pocket the difference.  If you can prove me wrong, then I'll agree with you. If you can't, then why shouldn't ministers refund the part of the entitlement that they don't use? And why should Hockey be the only one that has to refund what they don't use?"
australia,3dsswi,wallyupdabungenstein,3,Sun Jul 19 04:51:30 2015 UTC,"I think we're pretty much arguing the same thing (in a round about way), and you seem like a cool bloke, so I don't really want get into the minutia of government travel policy.  I think you are right in that the ministers don't have to bid or even show receipts (I'm not sure either), unlike every other public servant that has to use a centralised procurement process. I don't think it's just Hockey either that's doing it - so I'm not singling him out for that - I only mention him because he's the one saying that he doesn't see any other examples of questionable expense claims.  The point is that there is one set of rules for politicians which for anyone else - including other public servants - would be considered totally inappropriate. The sensible thing to do would be to put it all up for bidding (eg. 20,000 nights accommodation a year for 200+ pollies), and we'd get much better value for money as taxpayers and it would remove any hint of self-interest.  But that requires changing the rules which currently benefit themselves. Again, there is no disagreement about whether they are allowed to do it - just about whether it is appropriate. Especially if they are casting themselves as being too clean to be wetting their beaks in the trough."
australia,3dsswi,WontThinkStraight,2,Sun Jul 19 05:05:41 2015 UTC,"The man is beyond wealthy. He has no need for that money. To claim government entitlements out of greed rather than need is a particularly despicable act - especially when you belong to a govt that wants to force as many unemployed as possible to wait literally months with zero income before they receive a single cent.  It doesn't matter if it's ""within the guidelines"" if he had a conscience or any moral fibre at all he'd be content with the extremely generous income he already receives.  He deserves to be called out for this."

australia,3dsswi,mrsdrat,-4,Sun Jul 19 04:26:13 2015 UTC,"I honestly can't see the difference to the taxpayer, because if his wife were forced to forego rent on an investment property, then she'd never buy it in the first place.  It's insane to buy an investment property, and give away accommodation for free. She'd be smarter to just kick him out and force him to use his allowance to rent the house next door. Then she could get some paying tenants in.  Without the allowance, it would never happen.  Tell me, can you name a Labor minister, who out of the goodness of his heart, has said 'I want to forego my allowance, and use my own money and get a mortgage to buy a place in Canberra on top of my home elsewhere'.  If you can't find such benevolence, then I don't see what Justifies this attack.  If there was no return, then there'd be no investment in the first place."
australia,3dsswi,wallyupdabungenstein,2,Sun Jul 19 04:34:44 2015 UTC,"Absolute bollocks.  The purpose of the allowance is not to give our politicians money to invest in property, but to give them somewhere to stay while they're in town on business.  To use it for anything else is dishonest and against the spirit of the allowance.  Whether their decision as a millionaire couple to invest in a property in Canberra is financially viable or not is completely irrelevant.  It is not what the allowance is for and Hockey is a scumbag who is robbing the Australian people blind.   You would not get rent assistance if you were living with your parents on Newstart.  This is the same.  And this entitled grub thinks there are 2 sets of rules.  The sooner we are rid of this most corrupt and incompetent government, the better Australia's future will be."
australia,3dsswi,mrsdrat,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:54:39 2015 UTC,"To use it for anything else is dishonest and against the spirit of the allowance.    It may be against the spirit according to you, but it's not dishonest, and even if it was, Hockey's use of it is what it is for. The allowance is paying for the roof over his head, whether it's as a mortgage payment, or as rent to his wife.   That $271 is the travel allowance paid to all politicians for every day they come to Canberra for work. The allowance was designed to cover hotel bills, but increasingly, politicians of all stripes have been more creative about how they use it.  MPs can claim an allowance of up to $271 a night while in Canberra regardless of whether they stay in a hotel, rent an apartment, stay with friends or in their own home.  http://www.abc.net.au/lateline/content/2015/s4252718.htm  http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/nsw/minister-jamie-briggs-joins-joe-hockey-in-2-million-sharehouse-owned-by-treasurers-wife/story-fni0cx12-1227399358960   If you can show me just one Labor minister who has said ""I'm not going to claim my allowance"", then you might have a point, but all politicians claim it. You can sleep in your car, and spend it on hookers and blow if you want. That's not against the rules.  There's plenty of millionaires on Labor's side who have investment properties that generate rent. Why not make them sell one of their properties, and buy one in Canberra to stay in? Why shouldn't they forego rent? Why should Hockey be the only one who has to provide his own accommodation?  Show me just a single Labor politician who foregoes their entitlement. There are plenty of them who don't use the entire amount, and they don't refund any of it.   Why aren't they all branded dishonest as well?"

australia,3dsswi,mrsdrat,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:21:35 2015 UTC,"Of course he shouldn't. It was within the guidelines. He was using it to put a roof over his head in Canberra. You can change the guidelines for the future, but you can't make it retrospective if he was working within the guidelines at the time.  You may have an argument that they're robbing us blind. But being a representative isn't a minimum wage job. A lot of them are paid much less than they'd get in the private sector, with degrees in law, finance, economics etc. The private sector would pay an allowance if they were required to live away from their home as part of their employment conditions.  It's not as simple as just saying 'they're robbing us, we should just pay them the dole and see how they like it'. Unfortunately sometimes if you pay peanuts, you get monkeys, and I wouldn't want monkeys running the country.  Of course you can joke that they are monkeys, but in most cases, the private sector would disagree."

It is responsible for the destruction of the NBN, the ongoing trading of renewable energy, the destruction of the Carbon Tax, the frittering away of ABC funding, the threats to the Great Barrier Reef, the incoming TPP, and a wide range of other things where public interest has lost out to the interests of donors."

australia,3dxbts,PickerLeech,9,Mon Jul 20 08:43:44 2015 UTC,"I work for DHL. We are required to get first and last names.  Sometimes it's because only the addressee can sign for it, but mostly it's about tracking exactly who the receiver is. For example, when delivering to a business, any number of people can sign for it, but if someone rings us because they haven't got their parcel yet, we can tell them that Bob turwhiligur signed for it. We need the last name because there could be 17 Bobs working there.   By refusing to give your name, you effectively refused delivery.  I personally break this rule all the time, but only when I'm delivering to the same person all the time."
australia,3dxbts,wotmate,-1,Mon Jul 20 09:14:55 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your response.   And does a residential delivery change things?   Also, when someone does decline to give their full name, wouldn't it be reasonable for the courier to assauge their concerns? Perhaps by identifying who the courier is more clearly?   The courier had no identification at all. Not that I asked for any.  Also, how often will people (in a residential property) decide not to give their full name? Is it a common occurrence or a rarity?  I'm not lying when I say that i've never had this before and I've received dozens of packages."
australia,3dxbts,wotmate,2,Mon Jul 20 09:19:49 2015 UTC,Residential delivery changes nothing.  Technically we can demand ID if we want.  And I've never had anyone refuse to give their full name.   It's worth noting that it's very possible that parcels are often being tracked by law enforcement agencies.
australia,3dxbts,littlespoon,9,Tue Jul 21 07:38:32 2015 UTC,"I love how everyone is pointing out you gave the courier attitude and you are too self-absorbed to actually realise how rude you come across. Even your post reads like you looked down on him for being a courier before he even asked for the surname.  Some people really need to get off their high horses and give people in the service industries more respect. This guy was just trying to do his job. He asked for your surname, so what.. What did you think he was going to do with that information? Not everyone in society is out to 'get' you - especially not people in the service sector who are some of the hardest workers..  If I was your wife, I'd be pissed too - probably because I was married to such a self-centered cunt.  I went to pick up a parcel today from an AusPost store and was required to provide ID showing my full name and address. You probably would have flipped your shit at that. People are too precious these days.."
australia,3dxbts,fuzzyfurbum,-5,Mon Jul 20 11:57:53 2015 UTC,"Why don't you ask me if I have problem with couriers?   I have problems with couriers that hit buzzers and run, sure. I have problems with couriers that say they attempted to deliver parcels that they didn't attempt to deliver, sure.   Now am I making this up? Nope.   I didn't have a problem with this guy until he gave me a problem.   So you love how I gave the courier attitude even with no evidence that I did so. Okey dokey.   And presumably I'm the one on their high horse, not those accusing me of having an attitude despite no evidence that I didn. Righty ho.   Lol. A self-centred cunt. For being cautious about handing out personal information? Hmmm. I'm wondering if perhaps you're the cunt here.   No, I wouldn't have flipped my shit at providing photo ID at the post office - because I know that that's how the post office works.   I was not aware that I'm supposed to provide my full name when I'm at my home. And why aren't I aware of that? BECAUSE ITS NEVER HAPPENED BEFORE AND AT NO STAGE WAS I INFORMED OF IT BEING A REQUIREMENT."
australia,3dxbts,fuzzyfurbum,5,Mon Jul 20 13:02:59 2015 UTC,"Sounds like you failed the attitude test. All he wants to do is drop the parcels off and be on his way.  I'd have thought different parcels had different requirements for who can sign for them or even if anyone needs to sign for them at all or they can just be left.  I'm not sure what the big deal is with answering his question. I'm sure there's probably a few dodgy courier guys out there, but surely, the vast majority of them are doing whatever the bare minimum is to get their job done and get on their way? Including, asking whatever questions they need to in order to fulfil their requirements. I'm sure he wasn't scheming to steal your identity.  I get a bit annoyed and shitty when customers at my work don't want to tell me their name ""for privacy""."
australia,3dxbts,fuzzyfurbum,-4,Mon Jul 20 09:08:39 2015 UTC,"Attitude? Test?   I'd have thought different parcels had different requirements for who can sign for them or even if anyone needs to sign for them at all or they can just be left.   And I guess it's the recipients responsibility to be aware of all such requirements, even when not informed of them?   I'm not sure what the big deal is with answering his question.   I'm not sure either. I'm not a security or privacy expert. But I don't like handing my details out unnecessarily. Silly me for not trusting everyone and everything on face value, and for not allowing myself to be pressured into giving details to someone who hadn't identified themselves.    I'm sure there's probably a few dodgy courier guys out there   Oh you do do you   but surely, the vast majority of them are doing whatever the bare minimum is to get their job done    So we should just play the odds then, right? I'm thinking that perhaps the crims would be quite happy with that.    I get a bit annoyed and shitty when customers at my work don't want to tell me their name ""for privacy"".   So? Why do we care if you get annoyed when people are attempting to protect their own rights and security. We should ignore our own privacy and security concerns in order not to annoy others, is that it?"
australia,3dxbts,Arkosaurus,4,Mon Jul 20 09:14:21 2015 UTC,"Gee, I dunno. Maybe it's because they want me to give them a licence but I can't if they don't give me things like, well, THEIR NAMES!  Did it occur to you that there's any number of other ways this guy could get your surname without going to the elaborate rouse of dressing up like a courier with a uniform and courier van and turning up at your house with a few packages addressed to your wife?   All you managed to do was give a courier the irrates and your wife a case of the shits. And that, my friend, is a prime example of the results of a failed attitude test."
australia,3dxbts,CocaCoal,-4,Mon Jul 20 11:17:51 2015 UTC,"Still don't get what you mean by attitude. Or a test.   Do you think I was rude to the guy? By not wanting to give out my personal details - that's being rude?   Really?   Let's be clear - I gave the guy my name. As soon as he asked.   There is no argument there.   The guy asked my name, I gave it. Done.   What I did not do, is give him my last name - and why? Because it struck me as being unnecessary to do so.   If it were NECESSARY, then we'd all be doing it all the time - BUT WE'RE NOT - are we.   No.   TYPICALLY we're asked for our first name, and to then sign some electronic squiggly thing.   Do I think the guy was some kind of mastermind scammer? No. I hadn't given it ANY thought.   All I knew was that it struck me as UNNECESSARY to give him my last name. That's all.   And do you think I was being tested?  Do you think maybe the guy could have EXPLAINED, or perhaps shown some fucking ID or something.   No, that would be too sensible. Why put the pressure on the courier, when you can put the pressure on the recipient.   Hey recipient, tell me your name. No I won't show you where i'm from, or what the parcel is, or who the parcel is addressed to. Yes, I am standing at your fucking door in a property in which you clearly live in, but fuck it - you tell me who you are god damned it. No I won't give you an explanation or any assurances that i'm from a reputable company. No I won't explain why you're never normally asked for your last name.   Fuck me for not wanting to be tested in my own god damned home."
