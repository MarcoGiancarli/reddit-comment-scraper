Definitely not  like last year where we hit the ground running and didn't stop til we had the cup in our hands.   We've been on that line just between good enough and not good enough, and have managed to squeeze out those wins anyways, but they're not clear cut ""this game is in the basket"" wins. It makes for better football.   Even if we don't manage to get the cup again this year, I'd much rather watch 10 (or however many games we play this year) really close nail-biters than watch a bunch of games that are pretty much over by half time.

CFL,3dyu6p,Stach37,9,Mon Jul 20 17:20:46 2015 UTC,"I don't even disagree with a single point. Usually in these opinion pieces I find myself disagreeing with at least a few points but I really can't find anything in here that I don't agree with.    One thing I think he left out was that after any big play you no longer see even slight celebrations because the players are more concerned with looking around for flags.   We are 4 weeks in to the season and there isn't any noticeable decrease in flags like the league was telling everyone in the preseason.  My only concern is that the obvious decision would be to remove some of the new rules and loosen the rules to only call penalties on deserving plays, but if we've learned anything from Pro sports, they never admit they are wrong and they never change rules back to the old ways.  I don't think anyone agreed with having challenges for penalties after it was botched last year, so instead of removing the replays, they decided you could still challenge but they just wouldn't overturn anything no matter how ridiculous (Sask vs BC nonexistent PI in the endzone).  How many PI challenges have we seen this year that should have been won but the command centre just refused? They leave the challenges in for no other reason than to not move backwards in time even though they know it's just fucking retarded."
CFL,3dyu6p,skippy2893,4,Mon Jul 20 17:43:09 2015 UTC,"I feel like defenses are still adjusting. If the number doesn't decrease by labour day, then I'll be concerned."
CFL,3dyu6p,antonio106,3,Mon Jul 20 21:19:21 2015 UTC,"People keep saying that but it's not like there hasn't been an increase of 10 yard offensive penalties. I'm pretty sure there have already been more offensive PI this year than in the last 2 years combined. The amount of holdings, illegal blocks, hands to the face, and basically any other judgement call on offence have increased. The new rules have led to gain in penalties due to illegal contact and PI penalties, but those only make up a small percentage of the total penalties this season so it's not solely on the defence not being able to adjust.   The cut and dry penalties like facemask, offside, procedure, too many men, time count violations, not enough players on the LOS, etc. have not increased at all. If players were less disciplined then those penalties would also be increasing you would imagine. The penalties that have had an obvious increase are the judgement calls which means either the players are very specific when it comes to the penalties they ignore, or the ref's judgement is poor compared to the last 20 years."
CFL,3dyu6p,skippy2893,3,Mon Jul 20 21:26:08 2015 UTC,"And yet there was no flag when Willy got his bell rung against Hamilton. (Not suggesting the play was dirty, but it definitely warranted a penalty)"
CFL,3dyu6p,KamikazeCanuck,4,Mon Jul 20 20:50:34 2015 UTC,I think this is like when the NHL went through it's obstruction crackdown.  It was penalty mania and it didn't even work.  They had to try it several times and when it finally started to get though to the players it took an entire season.  Even then you could argue the refs let up again during the playoffs.  I think the CFL is going through that now but hopefully it won't take the entire season but judging by the NHL it will take several.
CFL,3dyu6p,LandMooseReject,-6,Mon Jul 20 23:23:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's so boring and horrible that players are supposed to stay on their own side of the line of scrimmage, and can't pull whoever they want down to the turf whenever they want. Obviously all these holding and offside penalties are symptomatic of serious problems with the way the game is being called."
CFL,3dyu6p,skippy2893,8,Mon Jul 20 19:57:52 2015 UTC,Holding penalties that are nonexistant or illegal blocks that are obvious flops should not be called as often as they are. Things like offside and procedure are not being called any more frequently than in the past. It's more and more 10 yard penalties that are negating big plays that is getting infuriating.  When a D-lineman dips his head down and the O-lineman's hand slips onto his facemask for a quarter second it should not be a hands to the face penalty but yet we saw 3 of those called in one game.  Every team has had a big special teams return negated by a tickytack illegal block that was far enough away from the play that it should not be called.    There is holding on every single play. Don't believe me? Rewatch any play and look at the receivers and the lineman and I guarantee you will see at least one holding. In years past the refs ignore them because they are minor and in most cases they have no impact on the play. This year they are calling every single one that they see even if it's not a major holding and is irrelevant to the play.  If you are honestly defending the officiating at this point in the season then it's clear that you have barely watched any of the games. I've watched at least 10 games and there are WAY more big plays being negated than in the past.

CFL,3dyubi,DancingC0w,7,Tue Jul 21 01:10:48 2015 UTC,"I think the question is this:  how would TSN make money off it?  TSN pays significant money to the CFL for exclusive rights.  That expense has to be recouped somehow.  The CFL could stream the feeds (it could negotiate this out of the next broadcast contract) but then it will receive less money for the broadcast rights.  TSN could sell streaming access but it would have to do so in such a way that it made financial sense and didn't excessively pilfer subscribers from their cable channels.  The only way I could see this working would be if the advertising revenues from greater distribution (online, if the ads are included, definitely increases distribution and viewership) would more than outweigh other issues.  I don't know what percentage of revenue TSN receives from advertising versus subscribers, but I'm inclined to believe that subscription fees form a significant part of their revenues.  I understand people want inexpensive (or free) streaming, but the CFL isn't free.  The content has to be paid for somehow. I think that's the struggle right now."
CFL,3dyubi,Niptacular_Nips,8,Mon Jul 20 17:39:37 2015 UTC,"I feel that TSN and CFL both have much to gain by implementing a stand alone streaming service not tied to cable.  With the trend of cord cutters, advertisers are going to demand more bang for their buck, advertisers are savvy (I'd hope) to know that this cord cutting trend isn't slowing down. I honestly feel it'll be them who forces TSN to release a standalone subscription service so that the advertisers can ensure their money is being spent well.   Furthermore, the young generation is craving something like this. How many times do you see ""I'd cut the cord if I could only get sports online"". We have real world examples how how a stand alone subscription service can be both profitable and well received (HBO's standalone service), and if the CFL is truly trying to target younger fans this is something they need to push for. I'd honestly gladly pay upwards towards 20-25$ a month for the ability to watch TSN whenever I wanted."

Rogers bought the NHL and is doing it right, IMO. I can buy the entire season, and watch any game I want, when I want. I can load it up on my Roku, tablet, phone, laptop. Not limited by where I am. A part of me wishes that it was Rogers that signed that contract extension..."

I no longer have cable because everything I watch can be found online using netflix and whatnot. I'm not going to pay a full cable fee just so I can get 1 sports channel.  I imagine there's thousands of people like me in Canada and tens of millions in the US that would get rid of their cable if they could stream sports legally.  Right now I use illegal streams only because it's the only way. I would gladly pay even $100 a season only for CFL games not the rest of TSN programs, but if I use cable I would be spending over $300 for the season and that's just ridiculous.  I can't even imagine the amount of money that cable companies pay professional sports to stay out of the streaming business since it would completely destroy cable.   Fuck em.

CFL,3dw5i8,dotCeh,14,Mon Jul 20 04:03:46 2015 UTC,Why would anyone ever try to catch the ball in the endzone under these rules?
CFL,3dw5i8,JLord,9,Mon Jul 20 03:16:36 2015 UTC,"I don't quite understand. With this proposal, a missed field goal that goes through the ends one would not be a point, but a missed field goal that is caught and downed in the end zone would be? That seems really inconsistent. The way I see it, rouges ARE ""earned"" as-is. They're earned by kicking the ball through the opponent's end zone. Sometimes, that's via a missed field goal, some times it's via a punt and sometimes it's  via a kickoff.   I often hear that a rouge is a ""reward for failure"" because of the missed field goal thing. While I can see how that may be true, the same argument could be made for FGs being rewards for failed touchdowns."
CFL,3dw5i8,mangotiger,7,Mon Jul 20 02:02:06 2015 UTC,"I agree.  Like I've said before, I don't consider it a reward for failure, I consider it a small reward for having driven the ball down the field close enough to have achieved that point (winning the field position battle)."
CFL,3dw5i8,ponimaju,4,Mon Jul 20 02:29:52 2015 UTC,Well put!
CFL,3dw5i8,mangotiger,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:32:02 2015 UTC,So when it happens 3 times in a game on kickoffs that's a reward for scoring a touchdown?
CFL,3dw5i8,ponimaju,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:27:20 2015 UTC,"I don't know what touchdowns have to do with it (unless you meant to reply to the other guy), but this obviously refers to ""in the event of a missed field goal"" - a rouge isn't scored in the same way on a kickoff (it has to die in the endzone and the other team fails to return it to the field of play).  Which is somewhat of a reward for having a kicker with a heavy leg but enough skill to make it die in the endzone.  If you're suggesting that it's a potential additional point to score as part of a touchdown (a second extra point), then possibly, but there are also kickoffs at the start of each half that don't happen because of a touchdown (and if a team defers to get the wind in the fourth, the other team has two of these kickoffs)."
CFL,3dw5i8,Canadave,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:49:51 2015 UTC,You nailed it. I actually didn't really know that rule. I knew some kickoffs didn't cause points but some do.
CFL,3dw5i8,mangotiger,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:15:48 2015 UTC,"The idea is that if the defense does not have an opportunity to defend against the rouge then its not given. My wording didn't quiet reflect that, Instead of ""If the ball is not caught in end zone"" it should be if the ball goes out of bounds in the end zone without bouncing no rouge is given.  This way as per u/JLord concern of not trying to catch the ball the defense would have to make an effort to get it in case it bounces.  I agree with u/dotCeh that with all the new rules are quite a bit however yesterday's game proves how important 1 point can be and I just don't see why a team should get a point for missing a field goal. The reason I disagree with you u/mangotiger is that the FG is not a reward for a failed touchdown is a team could choose to go for it on 3rd down and try again. Instead they choose to go for a field goal."
CFL,3dw5i8,JLord,6,Mon Jul 20 04:33:27 2015 UTC,The defence has just as much opportunity to defend against the rouge as they do against a field goal.
CFL,3dw5i8,JLord,2,Mon Jul 20 12:32:34 2015 UTC,"Hmm I still don't really understand what this would accomplish. Consider two missed field goal rouges - one from the 20 and one from half. The missed field goal from 20 would likely go out the back of the end zone (no point) and the long missed FG would likely bounce in the end zone (rouge). You've essentially rewarded a team for only being able to advance the ball to the opponents ~48 yard line as opposed to moving deep into the offensive territory.  The ""opportunity to defend"" rouges that don't touch the end zone completely exists already. As a defence, your opportunity to defend the non-returnable rouge takes place during the standard gameplay - if you'd like the opportunity to return the punt and prevent the rouge, keep the other team far enough away from your end zone."
CFL,3dw5i8,JLord,2,Mon Jul 20 17:26:08 2015 UTC,"Instead of ""If the ball is not caught in end zone"" it should be if the ball goes out of bounds in the end zone without bouncing no rouge is given.   This would add a really strange element to FG kicking where you would benefit from not kicking the ball as far and trying to land it in the endzone."
CFL,3dw5i8,KamikazeCanuck,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:03:24 2015 UTC,And after a couple of big returns they would probably stop that.   I also don't think kickers are thinking about hitting the ball as hard as possible now to make sure they get through or aren't returned. They focus on making the kick
CFL,3dw5i8,pudds,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:26:09 2015 UTC,"If you land the ball in the back 10 yards of the endzone I think most teams would be happy with a 99% chance of a single point as opposed to <1% chance of giving up a long return.  The focus now is on making the kick, but you also want a kicker who can put distance on the kick in case of a miss."
CFL,3dw5i8,KamikazeCanuck,0,Mon Jul 20 19:35:33 2015 UTC,"Instead of ""If the ball is not caught in end zone"" it should be if the ball goes out of bounds in the end zone without bouncing no rouge is given.

CFL,3dw5i8,KamikazeCanuck,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:03:27 2015 UTC,"Yes, well put.  A rouge is earned by kicking an unreturnable kick.  I like how you said a FB is a failed touchdown."
CFL,3dw5i8,KamikazeCanuck,5,Mon Jul 20 16:41:48 2015 UTC,"I'd be curious to know how many times are accuracy earned by missed field goals going through the back. My guess it's it's actually a pretty low percentage, since the uprights are at the front and any miss has to go an extra 20 yards to go through.  Long field goals aren't going to go out, and close ones don't get missed that often, so I'd bet the vast majority of rouges are conceded."
CFL,3duj0b,Stach37,31,Sun Jul 19 16:41:46 2015 UTC,"There were two reasons I feel that caused the stadium being 3000 seats short of selling out.  First, the rain was absolutely atrocious, this article doesn't really outline how bad the rain was. Unless you were on the North side (NorthsideSux) with the giant canopy, you were absolutely drenched. The forecast had been calling for this all week.  Second, The Tragically Hip were playing at the exact same time at Bluesfest, which probably took some of the REDBLACKS older fans away for a night, Bluesfest was packed for that show.   I think journalists have been sitting waiting for this to happen so they can publish an article like this and imply the franchise is in trouble to help sell papers.

CFL,3dta5e,chemicalxv,5,Sun Jul 19 06:17:41 2015 UTC,"The guys at football outsiders consider field goal percentage to be basically random from year to year:   This theory, which originally appeared in the New York Times in October 2006, is one of our most controversial, but it is hard to argue against the evidence. Measuring every kicker from 2000 to 2014 who had at least ten field goal attempts in each of two consecutive years, the year-to-year correlation coefficient for field-goal percentage was just 0.135. The patron saint of this theory might be Mike Vanderjagt, whose field-goal percentage bounced around from 82 percent in 2001 to 74 percent in 2002, then a perfect 100 percent in 2003, followed by 80 percent in 2004, 92 percent in 2005, and 72 percent in 2006. Adam Vinatieri has long been considered the best kicker in the game. But even he had never enjoyed two straight seasons with accuracy better than the NFL average of 85 percent until 2011, when he followed up his 26-for-28 2010 campaign by going 23-for-27 (85.2 percent).   See also Rene Paredes."
CFL,3dta5e,pudds,4,Sun Jul 19 12:46:48 2015 UTC,"The thing about Hijrullahu is that he's proven that he has the leg to kick some pretty big FGs and he's a decent punter. The missed FG at the end of the game was a result of the holder (was it still Brohm?) not getting the laces out on time. As for the missed PATs, my best guess is that it's a mental thing that he needs to get over.  Yes the Bomber kicking situation hasn't been great, but Hijru is still a sophomore and there's no need to cut the kid just yet."
CFL,3dta5e,ultimate_possum,2,Sun Jul 19 15:15:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah, if you look at the Bomber forums, they pretty much either want him challenged in practice next week or on a bus out of town with Stoudemire.

CFL,3ds1bz,Vickdumm,2,Sun Jul 19 00:18:02 2015 UTC,I disagree. Been going to games on the west side my whole life and it gets loud.

CFL,3ds1bz,les-is-more,2,Sun Jul 19 00:29:24 2015 UTC,the building really makes a difference.  Investors in winnipeg seems much louder than our old stadium.  Same people.
CFL,3ds1bz,les-is-more,2,Sun Jul 19 00:24:11 2015 UTC,Objectively the old stadium was louder.  Even though this stadium helps more.

CFL,3dso0t,Stach37,3,Sun Jul 19 02:02:36 2015 UTC,"I think he means instead of going for the field goal, why didn't they punt for a rouge instead"
CFL,3dso0t,-Rattata-,2,Sun Jul 19 02:34:59 2015 UTC,"Here's my thinking:  If you punt, you're only going to tie it with a rouge, wether you put it through or the kicker takes a knee (which he wouldn't because it would tie it up.)  If you go for the field goal, you can get some better protection, plus the chance of hitting and taking the lead, with what was stated above as other options/outcomes."
CFL,3dso0t,dotCeh,2,Sun Jul 19 03:10:20 2015 UTC,"Don't forget when they punt, it's from 17? yards behind the line of scrimmage.  Kickers are roughly 80% from 52 yards, and the league punting average is around 47 yards. The point would have been from about 62 yards out, so kicking through is probably not doable. Angling out might be, but it's riskier and makes the kick even longer too.  Considering league averages and the fact that Hajrullahu had been 2/2 from 50+ until that kick probably made it the right decision."

CFL,3dso0t,CaptainHadley,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:27:43 2015 UTC,They were scrimmaging from the 45 yard line was it? Probably the punt would have just reached the goal line. Calgary would have had (at least) 2 returners and it would have been the easiest thing in the world for them to bring it out to the 1 yard line. I can't imagine them being able to get a point off of that considering where they were on the field.

I watched my boyfriend be encouraged and scouted by the TiCats for over 2 years, and seeing them use a draft pick for Langa over an honest player was really hard. These guys work their asses off for this chance, and at this point there is no incentive for them not to cheat. Even without my personal involvement, I as a CFL fan want to watch people be the best athletes possible knowing they worked for it. If the game becomes about who can juice the most, then it's no longer a challenge of athletics and hard work, it's a contest of who can afford and inject the best drugs."

I'm not saying performance enhancing drugs should be ignored, but where does a lab get off refusing to test... If you need to be on your high horse, isn't testing with little consequence, better than no testing at all?  After all, they are labs, not enforcement agencies."
CFL,3drgia,Turd_Hurdler,1 point,Sun Jul 19 08:08:33 2015 UTC,"They're accredited by the World Anti-Doping Agency largely for their unwillingness to support doping. If they didn't have an opinion they wouldn't be as respected. Chances are that they do want to be able to take money from the CFL, but that requires the CFL to be as honest and fair as the rest of their clients in order for them to maintain a certain reputation. If they can speak out enough and encourage the league to openly enforce harsher consequences, then the cash will start to flow back to them again."
CFL,3drgia,vickipaperclips,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:15:55 2015 UTC,"I see your point... That seems a bit far reaching, though.  A lab's accreditation should be based on their scientific methods, not their stance on doping.  In fact, a lab must be neutral.  Impartial data and it's collection is their sole purpose.  Data collection by people with an agenda is a problem."
CFL,3drgia,Turd_Hurdler,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:46:34 2015 UTC,"The method of testing urine/blood for drugs isn't exactly rocket science, nobody is going to accredit them for their scientific method. But they're accredited by an organization that preaches anti-doping, so obviously the labs they stand behind are going to be against doping. If they were accredited by a general 'World Sport Organization' then neutrality would be expected as their reason for being employed doesn't rest on their opinions of drug use. Their opinions are just vocal in order to prove that people can trust them not to fake negative results."
CFL,3drgia,vickipaperclips,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:58:41 2015 UTC,"Faking results of any type, should be the end of credibility for any lab, regardless of what they are testing...

CFL,3dntye,Niptacular_Nips,3,Sat Jul 18 04:26:59 2015 UTC,Nah just because it was so damn far from being pass interference that I will accept literally any argument to ease my pain. Apparently the receiver can fully extend his arms but the defender can't slap them off now. I just can't even. I literally can't.
CFL,3dntye,skippy2893,2,Sat Jul 18 04:31:35 2015 UTC,I feel you. Every team is suffering for the same reason.

CFL,3dntye,Wilibus,2,Sat Jul 18 05:00:23 2015 UTC,"Dude learn the new rules. You can bank some PI's by not looking at the receiver for 5 plays in a row but then you are only allowed the PI once for 5 games. If you decide not to bank the PI then you have a 65% chance that you will get a penalty, but you can also choose to use your banked PI if you collect 4 Illegal contacts within 13 full quarters.   Duh."

CFL,3dmpif,KamikazeCanuck,3,Fri Jul 17 19:41:44 2015 UTC,"Both from the NIMBY crowd [there were a few news stories about the increased traffic around Ottawa's digs], and people who don't want their taxes to go towards something they don't directly see a benefit from, or aren't interested in (newsflash, most of your tax dollars don't directly or even indirectly benefit you)."

CFL,3dmpif,1dererLives,2,Sat Jul 18 18:00:49 2015 UTC,"Its not about ""indirect benefit"", it's about people not benefiting from it ...period. I'm from Halifax, and the NDP here were recently bounced from office primarily over anger at their corporate welfare policies. The resistance here is no different. I would love a CFL team here, but not if it costs an already cash-strapped community money that it can't otherwise afford.   If an economist could show me something that indicates a stadium would be an efficient and profitable investment for the community then I would be all for it. I'm generally on the side of knocking down the old and aggressively pursuing the new. But that doesn't mean that we should just assume a CFL stadium would be a good investment because we want it to be.   That said, in Nova Scotia it is quite difficult to ascertain if something is beneficial because there is a huge contingent of people here that are terrified of any change whatsoever and will fabricate any reason to quash an idea."
CFL,3dmpif,ponimaju,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:50:45 2015 UTC,"Fair enough, I have heard that stadiums are not an economic boon (don't really benefit a surrounding community economically, at least enough to justify it in the same way that one would normally justify an investment [profit/return]); I was referring to whether or not one would enjoy games/concerts/events at a specific locale, like a stadium.  With the benefits part, I mean like people without kids having taxes go towards schools, relatively healthy people not being much of a burden on the healthcare system, money going towards roads and infrastructure for highways/towns/places they will never visit, etc.  People think far too individually and personally about their taxes, and especially seem to think that a larger chunk of their tax dollars go towards things they don't support, rather than that they are spread out over dozens of different things."

CFL,3dmpif,jonhiseler,2,Sat Jul 18 16:55:45 2015 UTC,"The reality of the situation in Halifax is that there isn't much use for a stadium outside of the potential for a CFL team as well as university sports. Yes, there are a lot of NIMBY's in Halifax, but there really hasn't been a feasible case put forward for a stadium yet, and I would much rather tax money be spent towards something that will actually have a use."

Proulx honestly has one of the most consistent crews in the league.  Bradbury easily has the least consistent, followed by this guy tonight, and then finally Kim murphy's crew.  Proulx always calls a tight game, but he is consistent and the players and coaches know what will be called. Bradbury will call 6 unnecessary roughness calls one game and then 0 the next even though there may have been 2 in each game. It's consistency that is the most important quality of a ref in my opinion."
CFL,3dmp9b,skippy2893,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:58:18 2015 UTC,This would be a valid point if they still had consistent crews.  The entire crew is mixed up each game as of last year.

CFL,3dmp9b,SafiJaha,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:53:15 2015 UTC,"OK, so the CFL is not the NFL, BUT... I think the CFL has to step up and make the head ref for each team(of refs) a full time job.  I think if the head ref got better, he could coach his linemen etc to become better, without having to make all reffing positions in the CFL full time.  Note, this is based on my unsubstantiated belief that all reffing positions are currently part time in the CFL as opposed to all full time in the NFL. Please correct me where I am wrong."
CFL,3dmp9b,jmasterdude,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:07:08 2015 UTC,"You are right and it is something that should be addressed. The CFL never admits that the refs fuck up and they have directly controlled the outcomes of games in the past and the league has ignored it.  A couple years ago there was a blatant PI in the endzone while Montreal had the ball on the last play of the game. If the refs didn't miss that call then the Riders would have played Montreal in the Grey Cup instead of Hamilton, but the league completely ignored it.   There are only 6 head refs so it really wouldn't be hard for the league to allocate $300k to quality officiating."
CFL,3dmp9b,skippy2893,2,Sat Jul 18 00:05:12 2015 UTC,It should be an immediate priority. This would probably make a big positive impact on the game in general.
CFL,3dmp9b,FondleOtter,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:49:35 2015 UTC,"I realize the refs would only work one day a week, twenty weeks a year, but what kind of full time employees would they attract at 50k a year?

CFL,3dijgq,RaptorsFromSpace,1 point,Fri Jul 17 05:15:21 2015 UTC,"Lost our centre to the NFL (Jones), and left tackle signed with the Bombers (Bryant). During the preseason, are starting left guard suffered a concussion and is on the 6 GIL. So going in the first game, we lost 3/5 linemen from last year. Jump forward to Monday's game, we lose Harrison and Feder. Right now, we only have one starting offensive linemen from last years Grey Cup game (Wilson) still playing."
CFL,3dijgq,dotCeh,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:42:14 2015 UTC,"Sounds about right.   I'm not trying to take anything away from what is obviously a talented player. But watching highlights of years past I felt that I could have ran for 20 yards on some of those plays, given that no one touched him.   Lets be honest here, O-linemen are a dramatically under appreciated aspect of the running game. But he's a talented player, so it's not going to come as a surprise to me if he still rushes for a 1000 with little help from his line.  I'd like to wish you the best of luck, but one look at my flare will tell you that's a farce. So let me say I hope your team has catastrophic losses, all in good humor of course :)"

CFL,3dij4t,Stach37,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:33:20 2015 UTC,I always have to wonder what kind of fans would rather watch teams win by breaking the rules. An official alters the game just as much by ignoring a legitimate infraction.
CFL,3diiex,CaptainHadley,5,Thu Jul 16 15:27:45 2015 UTC,"Not panic. The Riders haven't played a bad game yet so why should we panic. They have led going into every fourth quarter, they just need to close out those games. Offense is #1 in the league (by more than 100 yards/game over the second best team) and the defense needs to play a full 60 minutes instead of falling apart at the end of each game."

CFL,3dijf2,Stach37,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:35:29 2015 UTC,Well that wasn't a very informative article.... what exactly are the issues with the building? Is this similar to what Winnipeg is experiencing with our new building?
CFL,3dijf2,such-a-mensch,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:43:14 2015 UTC,"I don't know 100% of the internal issues (if there are any with the structure), but I believe their problems are less about structural downfalls and more about how things played out. They tore down the stadium, leaving the TiCats without anywhere to play for over a year, and then took much longer than they said they would to construct (which equals more money). It's nearly an identical stadium to their old one, just an updated, flashier version. Unlike IGF where they built in a bowl shape, Tim Hortons Field is open on both ends and allows the wind to easily whip right through the field, which is annoying for both fans and players. The TiCats weren't in support of keeping the field in the same location either. It was a lot of really stupid city council politics where council was split on  where to build the new stadium (it took them so long to figure out, PanAm almost revoked their involvement in the games). Some counselors wanted to build on the other side of town where there isn't much of anything right now, and use it as a way to create new commercial space (which was a really good idea). Others wanted to keep the stadium where it currently was in hopes that it would 'rejuvenate business'. The reason the 'rejuvenation' route was stupid was because Ivor Wynne was literally built in the middle of a downtown residential area. There's not really anything to rejuvenate through business, since the only commercial spaces down there are a few convenience stores and some small family restaurants. The houses themselves are pretty old and run down, it's not a nice neighbourhood (not really the place you want to leave your car for a night game). Now, when I say they built in the middle of a residential area, I don't mean like the way IGF was built where there are houses nearby, I mean there are literally houses across the street, so imagine the insane traffic that comes with trying to navigate those streets before and after games. The TiCats were in favour of moving the stadium to the new location as it was the option that made the most sense (to just about anyone other than a few city counselors). I don't really blame them for withholding payments, especially with all the shit the city put them through for this stadium. Chances are that that the cost went up with the delayed construction and the city expected the team to pitch in more money than originally expected."
CFL,3dijf2,vickipaperclips,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:52:25 2015 UTC,"I agree with everything here except for comment concerning leaving your car near Ivor Wynne at night.  I've never felt the least bit scared of any crime in that area of Hamilton, even in areas that are a bit more crime-ridden in the city aren't near as bad as they were 10-20 years ago. I'm sick of Hamilton getting poop talked on this subreddit. (Coming from someone who grew up in Hamilton, and recently moved to Montreal.)"

If we can beat Edmonton anything is possible.  Our team is only improving as long as we can  get a  good MLB.  I think Argos are the best in the East they won't lose many.  But I think we might be able to beat them as long as they don't kill our run game.

I can't stand seeing a flag on every single play.   When every team is filled with players who have been playing the game since they were very young children and are being called for these chickenshit penalties all of a sudden I put it on the shoulders of some of the most notoriously awful officials in all of sports. The Calgary game demonstrated they literally fabricate penalties.

CFL,3dbkpm,anttrapper,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:02:42 2015 UTC,I hesitate celebrating any good play this year because there's probably a penalty on it.
CFL,3dbkpm,PolarOpposites8,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:38:40 2015 UTC,"I'm done watching any games that aren't the Riders for now at least.    I've been watching more and more CFL games in the last couple of years - I enjoy the league so much more nowadays and like scouting out the other teams and just learning about all the players that everybody has.  So many times lately, I'll shut the NFL off on a Monday/Thursday/Sunday night game and just do something else, but I don't do that nearly as often with CFL.  It is even more frustrating this year though, obviously (but weak/questionable roughing the passer penalties [throwing a flag on a bang-bang play happens way too often] have been terrible for a number of years).  And the consistency has always been a problem, and gets worse when you look at the PI/contact calls - like when we had to challenge to get PI on a 2 point conversion when the guy was clearly early and there were two officials in the vicinity [what else would they be looking at?] but soft illegal contact/PI calls are getting called immediately in other games."
CFL,3dbkpm,ponimaju,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:17:19 2015 UTC,"Completely agree, and the most baffling part is this is all being done in the name of improving the game. The CFL really is proving that the road to hell is paved with good intentions. There was nothing wrong with the game besides too many penalties, so why was the solution for less penalties more rules?"
CFL,3dbkpm,FondleOtter,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:42:02 2015 UTC,"""First, it is true that penalties are up, and I don't think anyone will say that 28.5 penalties per game is okay. However, the 32 per cent increase is compared to last year's total. There has been an increase of just 14 per cent over this time last year. What that shows is that while there is an increase, it is smaller than first thought. Also, historically there are more penalties called early in a football season.""   This pretty much blows the reasoning behind the rule-whinging out of the water as far as I'm concerned. The bad calls would still be happening because the officiating isn't there, and 14 percent year-over-year after a major rules change is well-within what I would consider to be an acceptable range.    My utopian fantasy is that this shock will reduce officiating complacency amongst the executives and end-up being a positive for the quality of the game in the mid to long-term."

CFL,3d9173,PhotoJim99,2,Wed Jul 15 23:12:54 2015 UTC,"Good analysis.  I think I'd argue that going for it on 3rd and 1 in overtime wouldn't be a guaranteed loss (it would however have a ~20% chance of almost guaranteeing a loss).  I'm not sure what the odds of a TD score would be if Saskatchewan had gotten the first down on that play, but it would have changed the complexion of the overtime period.  Still, your point is that Chamblin could have played some things differently but mostly he did fine is pretty encouraging."
CFL,3d9173,PhotoJim99,2,Tue Jul 14 14:48:07 2015 UTC,"Yea, I didn't write that very well.  Should have said ""failing to kick it and failing to convert"" is a guaranteed loss.  You got the gist though."

Fans just don't like comebacks like that, it was very disheartening watching, especially after the OT Toronto loss."
CFL,3d9173,Niptacular_Nips,2,Tue Jul 14 19:45:08 2015 UTC,"That is some good stuff.  When you look at all the decision points made there, basically all of the paths taken had a good probability of delivering victory.  The fact that they didn't is a string of poor luck/execution that you can't really attribute to the decisions themselves.  Another thing to mention regarding the decision to go for it in the 4th is that, this year, conditions are more favourable for punt returns than they used to be.... was, then, the decision to go for it partially a lack of confidence in being able to stuff the Lions return team?  If there was a punt on that play, and the Lions got a good return and ended up scoring, everyone would be screaming ""why didn't you go for it on third and inches when succeeding there would have won the game?"""

CFL,3d9pjc,Stach37,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:26:32 2015 UTC,"This is a very difficult decision to me. First of all, I fully see the perspective that low hits should be penalized on receivers and running backs as well as quarterbacks, but the issue for me is that we're taking the instinctive nature out of the game. We already witnessed it happen with regards to high hits, and helmet to helmet contact. Players now have to think about where and how they are going to attempt a tackle, as opposed to making the tackle in the most effective way possible. This gives defensive players another huge disadvantage. Imagine Tristan Jackson 1 on 1 in open field with Jerome Messam. If Jackson is forced only hit between the waist and shoulders, 9 times out of 10, a player like Messam is going to drop his shoulder and go right through the defender. I understand the players perspective, and i understand the league will want to protect its big money makers, like Jon Cornish, Andrew Harris, Adarius Bowman etc., but I think the more we limit the rules of the game, the more we limit the product on the field."

CFL,3d6o4j,-Rattata-,2,Tue Jul 14 02:26:37 2015 UTC,"Game's been pretty good. Toronto started off strong, but then Calgary started absolutely dominating.  My weekend was amazing. Went to a really nice cottage, and then had a huge block party barbecue after that. What were you up to over the weekend?"
CFL,3d6o4j,BrawndoTTM,2,Tue Jul 14 02:33:28 2015 UTC,"Went camping with a lot of friends (Balsam Provincial Park), drank a lot, did a little bit of drugs and hit on ladies at the beach  Lost my TiCats hat :( going to buy a new one tomorrow hopefully though  Glad to hear the Stamps are doing well"
CFL,3d6o4j,-Rattata-,2,Tue Jul 14 02:36:58 2015 UTC,"Went camping with a lot of friends (Balsam Provincial Park), drank a lot, did a little bit of drugs and hit on ladies at the beach   Sounds like a very solid weekend. Get any numbers?   I'm glad the Stamps are doing well too, but am sort of pissed I missed the bet deadline by like 5 minutes so I don't have any money on it."
CFL,3d6o4j,BrawndoTTM,2,Tue Jul 14 02:39:49 2015 UTC,"One girl added me on facebook and lives near me, we hooked up but I don't think I'm going to try and make anything more out of us  I put 100% faith in the Stamps this weekend to save my pickem, I'm screwed if they lose this"
CFL,3d6o4j,-Rattata-,2,Tue Jul 14 02:42:32 2015 UTC,"Nice! At least you got a hookup out of it.  Wait, how does your pickem system work? I thought you just lost if any of the teams on your pickem lose."
CFL,3d6o4j,BrawndoTTM,2,Tue Jul 14 02:45:11 2015 UTC,"No you just kinda pick who you think will win and how confident you are, based on how confident you are determines how much you risk/can win  And yeah the hookup was... ok"
CFL,3d6o4j,-Rattata-,2,Tue Jul 14 02:52:36 2015 UTC,"No you just kinda pick who you think will win and how confident you are, based on how confident you are determines how much you risk/can win   So is this ProLine or something else? Where do you make your bets? I use Bodog myself, but I'm tired of dealing with shady/possibly illegal shit with my sports gambling habit.    And yeah the hookup was... ok   Lol, I suppose that's the reason for the no follow-up?"
CFL,3d6o4j,BrawndoTTM,2,Tue Jul 14 02:55:48 2015 UTC,"to be fair, i shut off that lions/rider game with 3 minutes to go because it was all over in my mind.  you were robbed on that one."
CFL,3d6o4j,bigwilliec,6,Tue Jul 14 00:02:48 2015 UTC,MRW I look at the calender
CFL,3d6o4j,OdetoPoutine,5,Mon Jul 13 23:41:47 2015 UTC,"""Flag at the end of the play.""  Holy fucking shit fuck off. I'll stop complaining about penalties when the refs actually start letting these guys play."
CFL,3d6o4j,dotCeh,4,Tue Jul 14 03:04:47 2015 UTC,walked away..... hour later.... calgary is up.... ok im very happy now
CFL,3d6o4j,coelurosauravus,3,Tue Jul 14 03:01:08 2015 UTC,Refs must have Argos in the Pick'Em.
CFL,3d6o4j,dcm386,5,Tue Jul 14 04:01:37 2015 UTC,"Go Stamps!! Won tickets for on-field patio for fan appreciation night, high chance of rain, and some huge injury returns. Bring it!  Edit: spelling hard"
CFL,3d6o4j,Tim_Timebomb,2,Mon Jul 13 23:29:15 2015 UTC,"That's the new patio by the Red and White club? Looks sweet. I mean sitting field level past the end zone won't have the best view for much of the game, but I'd take those patio chairs over aluminum bleachers."
CFL,3d6o4j,PickerPilgrim,2,Mon Jul 13 23:35:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah thats it. Im not expecting too great a view but definitely an experience I would never get otherwise. $80 a person with a minimum of 50 people or somethig like that. The seats I have regularly arent bleachers though, theyre individual seats. Im not entirely sure but I don't think there are bleacher seats at McMahon anymore"
CFL,3d6o4j,Tim_Timebomb,2,Mon Jul 13 23:40:14 2015 UTC,"There are definitely bleacher seats. My season tickets used to be bleachers, but a couple seasons ago they screwed individual molded plastic seats on top of the aluminum. Slight improvement, but still no back on them. The cheap end-zone seats are still just bare metal benches though."
CFL,3d6o4j,PickerPilgrim,3,Mon Jul 13 23:43:25 2015 UTC,I just hope this game is half as epic as that Lions - Riders game.. That was amazing!
CFL,3d6o4j,Boxfortsuprise,6,Tue Jul 14 01:08:44 2015 UTC,"damnit Cornish!  im counting on you to help us get back to the top of the division, and you do this!?!?!?!?!?"
CFL,3d6o4j,coelurosauravus,3,Tue Jul 14 01:27:12 2015 UTC,Calgary's O-line is getting scary thin.

CFL,3d6o4j,JoshwayTV,2,Tue Jul 14 00:17:34 2015 UTC,Go Toronto from Toronto! :D
CFL,3d6o4j,anojan12345,3,Tue Jul 14 03:00:53 2015 UTC,Is there a exact reason for this game being on a Monday?
CFL,3d6o4j,ponimaju,2,Mon Jul 13 23:29:17 2015 UTC,Calgree Stampede just ended (McMahon would be occupied during the entire week)
CFL,3d6o4j,PickerPilgrim,5,Mon Jul 13 23:31:02 2015 UTC,I don't think McMahon would be occupied necessarily but transit would already be strained and it would dampen turn out. The Stampede and the Stampeders probably just don't want to compete with each other.
CFL,3d6o4j,ponimaju,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:37:47 2015 UTC,Probably the more likely of the situations - I think they have the opening ceremonies and probably other events there though (maybe it's not occupied 24/7; I've never been to Stampede).
CFL,3d6o4j,RaptorsFromSpace,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:45:31 2015 UTC,"McMahon is kind of far from where the Stampede takes place, the Stampeders use it almost exclusively, save for when the Dinos play there."
CFL,3d6o4j,anojan12345,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:47:10 2015 UTC,I didn't know that McMahon gets used for the stampede.
CFL,3d6o4j,Tim_Timebomb,3,Mon Jul 13 23:31:53 2015 UTC,I think the parking lot does
CFL,3d6o4j,Vickdumm,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:33:23 2015 UTC,nah McMahon isint used at all by stampede.
CFL,3d6o4j,RagingIce,3,Tue Jul 14 01:21:25 2015 UTC,Hoping for a big game for Coombs
CFL,3d6o4j,CaptainHadley,3,Tue Jul 14 00:34:01 2015 UTC,Rich Stubler looks like a 90s Danny Devito.
CFL,3d6o4j,Nexcapto,2,Tue Jul 14 03:05:08 2015 UTC,Holy crap! I was just saying he reminded me of Danny deveto jumping put of a couch naked and sweaty when Rick is sweaty. So true.
CFL,3d6o4j,RaptorsFromSpace,3,Tue Jul 14 03:16:51 2015 UTC,18 penalties... that is unbelievable.
CFL,3d6o4j,CaptainHadley,3,Tue Jul 14 04:00:05 2015 UTC,That wasnt even fuckin close.
CFL,3d6o4j,Canadave,2,Tue Jul 14 04:00:46 2015 UTC,"Nope. That was a terrible call, even though it might give us a last gasp."
CFL,3d6o4j,gaganminhas,3,Tue Jul 14 04:01:20 2015 UTC,Why are CFL officials so horrible this year? There usually great
CFL,3d6o4j,FondleOtter,3,Tue Jul 14 04:01:12 2015 UTC,"They have always been awful, barely above amateur level. It's sad to watch knowing they're the highest level available for the Canadian game"
CFL,3d6o4j,ctweeder,3,Tue Jul 14 04:17:26 2015 UTC,That was the most bullshit call I've ever seen.
CFL,3d6o4j,RaptorsFromSpace,3,Tue Jul 14 04:01:12 2015 UTC,Refs fucked us hard on that last one.
CFL,3d6o4j,-Rattata-,3,Tue Jul 14 04:01:42 2015 UTC,Wish the refs told me who they wanted to win before I made my Pick Em...
CFL,3d6o4j,coelurosauravus,3,Tue Jul 14 04:02:48 2015 UTC,You magnificent bastards.  Thank you thank you thank you.  I can sleep in peace
CFL,3d6o4j,Vickdumm,2,Tue Jul 14 04:09:06 2015 UTC,Nice to see fuller back in the lineup. We definitely missed him last week
CFL,3d6o4j,dotCeh,2,Tue Jul 14 01:22:58 2015 UTC,"In case anyone is wondering, not only did Calgary lose two starting Olinemen from last year, but a starting guard is also on the 6 game list."
CFL,3d6o4j,dotCeh,2,Tue Jul 14 01:30:13 2015 UTC,"WOW NEVER SEEN THAT PLAY WITH PARKER BEFORE.  **Disclaimer, Parker was a high school senior my rookie year of high school ball. That was a bread and butter play for them...rough night..."
CFL,3d6o4j,RaptorsFromSpace,2,Tue Jul 14 01:52:58 2015 UTC,He's done that a lot in the CFL too.
CFL,3d6o4j,dotCeh,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:53:51 2015 UTC,Ran it a lot with the Dinos. Probably in his sleep to.
CFL,3d6o4j,PatAunces,2,Tue Jul 14 01:55:52 2015 UTC,That was a beautiful lateral there.
CFL,3d6o4j,RaptorsFromSpace,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:02:35 2015 UTC,"It was, smart play by Bell."
CFL,3d6o4j,goboatmen,2,Tue Jul 14 02:05:00 2015 UTC,No fucking way.  God fucking dammit

CFL,3d6o4j,-Rattata-,2,Tue Jul 14 02:57:58 2015 UTC,God damn why is this gamethread so dead?
CFL,3d6o4j,JoshwayTV,3,Tue Jul 14 03:01:30 2015 UTC,Late Monday night game? I dunno. I'm here so I can't speak for everyone else lol
CFL,3d6o4j,CaptainHadley,2,Tue Jul 14 03:02:50 2015 UTC,"Not saying injuries are good, but if it has to happen to someone atleast its on the team that plays Winnipeg next week on a short week."
CFL,3d6o4j,ababcock1,2,Tue Jul 14 03:02:30 2015 UTC,The battle of attrition. Will Calgary have enough players to finish the game?
CFL,3d6o4j,JoshwayTV,2,Tue Jul 14 03:03:11 2015 UTC,"If Dave Stala can do some kicking for the Argos, surely Calgary can fill some holes with coaches/TSN sound dudes"
CFL,3d6o4j,ababcock1,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:05:27 2015 UTC,I was hoping for a promotion from armchair quarterback.
CFL,3d6o4j,JoshwayTV,2,Tue Jul 14 03:07:51 2015 UTC,"As one of three Argo fans in my village, I would be ok with this! Chances are 33%! Getting to live my dream of playing in the CFL would be unbelievable (even if it means I would likely lose my spleen)"
CFL,3d6o4j,shichibukai3000,2,Tue Jul 14 03:12:17 2015 UTC,Or will the refs run out of flags first? You decide.
CFL,3d6o4j,RaptorsFromSpace,2,Tue Jul 14 03:09:57 2015 UTC,I really don't like Mark Killam I haven't for awhile.
CFL,3d6o4j,bquinho,2,Tue Jul 14 03:04:23 2015 UTC,Anyone else ever contemplate the fact that Charleston Hughes and Nik Lewis are the same person?
CFL,3d6o4j,dotCeh,3,Tue Jul 14 03:04:29 2015 UTC,nah. The Dlinemen is skinnier than the slot back. Wait..
CFL,3d6o4j,CaptainHadley,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:05:44 2015 UTC,"As much as it may seem true, not even close. 45 pound difference."
CFL,3d6o4j,bquinho,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:10:13 2015 UTC,Hughes is 250 and Lewis is 240.
CFL,3d6o4j,CaptainHadley,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:21:58 2015 UTC,Nik Lewis is 205.
CFL,3d6o4j,RaptorsFromSpace,2,Tue Jul 14 03:34:47 2015 UTC,I think Hughes is lighter then Lewis.

CFL,3d6o4j,ababcock1,2,Tue Jul 14 03:49:41 2015 UTC,Death in the family I guess.
CFL,3d6o4j,BobBeaney,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:50:45 2015 UTC,Thank you.
CFL,3d6o4j,dcm386,2,Tue Jul 14 03:53:42 2015 UTC,I believe they said his father in law passed away?
CFL,3d6o4j,BobBeaney,2,Tue Jul 14 03:51:11 2015 UTC,Oh bummer. Thank you.
CFL,3d6o4j,BobBeaney,2,Tue Jul 14 03:53:31 2015 UTC,I kinda like the Monday night start. What do you guys think? (Of course they couldn't do it during nfl season).
CFL,3d6o4j,RaptorsFromSpace,2,Tue Jul 14 03:52:50 2015 UTC,"I'm okay with it, I don't like the long break between two games on Friday then a game on Monday. I understand why they did it though."
CFL,3d6o4j,BobBeaney,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:54:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah, maybe it's just the novelty but I wad tired after work and it was cool to plunk down on the couch and watch the game."

CFL,3d6o4j,bquinho,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:55:58 2015 UTC,As long as they give us a Saturday game next time.
CFL,3d6o4j,gaganminhas,2,Tue Jul 14 03:56:00 2015 UTC,That call could cost the stamps the game
CFL,3d6o4j,coelurosauravus,2,Tue Jul 14 04:01:53 2015 UTC,Please stamps please.... Make my day
CFL,3d6o4j,JoshwayTV,2,Tue Jul 14 04:05:53 2015 UTC,GG lads. Your defence did you a solid the second half

CFL,3d4ffj,Stach37,3,Mon Jul 13 13:05:11 2015 UTC,"Jury is still out.  Two games is not the best sample size.  Cato's decision making is a big part of why they were in the Winnipeg game to the end.  However, his play was also a reason they lost that game.  Its also scary to realize how small Cato is.  He's not Brandon banks small, but he is dwarfed by other players.    Idk I think this article is just anointing him too soon."
CFL,3d4ffj,coelurosauravus,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:47:47 2015 UTC,"I agree with this. Showing his story on TSN was also done a little too soon. Making a big deal out of a QB like this will lead to a huge let down for young fans if he fails.   Wait until he's played 4-5 games and then show his story, and call him great after he is the unquestionable starter. Look at Tate, he's never lost when he plays the full game, but he's played only 4 full games his entire career.."

CFL,3d2ufn,omegatron20xx,3,Mon Jul 13 02:07:38 2015 UTC,Good piece! Those teams didn't have to fail; Shreveport was kinda getting its act together and Baltimore was Baltimore. Only the Posse was a complete disaster.
CFL,3d2ufn,roolb,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:07:08 2015 UTC,Sounds like Birmingham with some better scheduling decisions could have done better off. Ive read one other team was still interested in continuing as a franchise but the CFL didnt want one lone American team with 9 other Canadian teams.
CFL,3d12d1,BanksKnowsBest,37,Sun Jul 12 17:13:50 2015 UTC,"I dislike these types of articles about Roughrider fans. It is true that Saskatchewan has a very dedicated fan base and football is important here. However, always being told that you are the best fans in sports (which I don't think is true) gives some Rider fans the sense of entitlement and arrogance that other CFL fans hate. I feel that being great fans is as much about comradery and sportsmanship as it is about dedication to the team."
CFL,3d12d1,Handjobber,14,Sun Jul 12 17:56:28 2015 UTC,"Agreed. The way I see it, there is a core of true fans, and then there are the bandwagon fans that came in during the last 10 years or so (yes, I know I am making a vast generalization) that seem to live to: 1. Drink (nothing wrong with that unless it leads to...) 2. Engage in trash talk, but without the good-nature that most true CFL fans enjoy 3. Look for ways to be physical with fans from other teams  I have several friends that are fans of other teams including the Riders, and we have great trash talk sessions, but they are always fun, give-and-take kinds of talk. This is what I consider a true CFL fan and its a shame what this new breed of fan has brought to our game. And, yes, there are fans of this type in all stadiums wearing every team colours."
CFL,3d12d1,darkhorse65,11,Sun Jul 12 18:52:20 2015 UTC,"There's been some pretty ugly times at McMahon for Rider games though. Particularly playoff games.  There's equal parts assholes on both sides.   I was once shoved by a Stamps fan there and got a ""Hey Saskatchewan, thanks for your combines!"" It was beautiful, I didn't know if it was an insult or what. Was he planning on taking our combines for use in Alberta? Since when are combines manufactured in Saskatchewan? Perhaps he bought some used ones and was genuinely happy with multiple purchases?  So many questions.   Everyone is guilty of these types. I think Calgary is the worst because you get all the expats looking for a good old proper Saskatchewan drunk and there's just too much rye in everyone's veins"
CFL,3d12d1,chase82,4,Sun Jul 12 22:21:55 2015 UTC,The worst I ever had was at a game in Edmonton. An old man in a wheelchair was waiting beside us and started laughing. We asked him what was funny and he informed us he may be physically handicapped but at least he wasn't mentally handicapped like us. Rolled away laughing his head off. Fucking dick
CFL,3d12d1,Old_Kendelnobie,4,Mon Jul 13 00:12:27 2015 UTC,"I don't get it. What do people get out of being an asshole to fans of other teams? It certainly doesn't make the game any more enjoyable - for anyone in the area - so why bother? I love the trash talking that goes on in my section with other fans. No matter who is winning, the smiles and laughter are still out in full force. That's part of what makes the CFL better than the NFL imo. I've been to several NFL games, and you really don't want to be a visiting team fan. We don't need that kind of crap up here."
CFL,3d12d1,darkhorse65,4,Sun Jul 12 22:46:37 2015 UTC,"I like to think he was a combine enthusiast and genuinely thanking you for the contributions that Saskatchewan has made to the combine industry.

CFL,3d12d1,RaptorsFromSpace,18,Sun Jul 12 23:06:48 2015 UTC,"I honestly think the Bombers have some of the best fans. They're passionate about a team that hasn't had a lot of success in a while. Every bomber fan I've met has been kind to me, and is always down to talk about the game, their team or mine. Every other team I can think of one downside, including my own Stamps fans can be complete asshats, but Bombers? Nope can't say a bad thing."
CFL,3d12d1,RaptorsFromSpace,2,Sun Jul 12 21:26:07 2015 UTC,Most of the Bombers fans I've seen at games/in person have been good people.  They tend to be the saltiest online though.

They know the basic rules of football but not much else about the team or the league. I'm not saying you need to be a cfl historian but if you claim to be a diehard fan you should at least know the team names or who Burris plays for. But they love going to the labour day classic and going to Edmonton, they get really drunk, trash talk everyone and make fools of themselves. They tend to give real fans a bad name and are no where to be seen when everything goes for crap (like last season)."
CFL,3d12d1,Old_Kendelnobie,3,Sun Jul 12 18:06:28 2015 UTC,"going to Edmonton, they get really drunk, trash talk everyone and make fools of themselves.   This is an accurate statement.

CFL,3d12d1,JLord,3,Mon Jul 13 15:40:58 2015 UTC,"Another day, another polarizing article about the Roughriders.  We get it, Rider fans are a bunch of drunken bandwagon jumpers and no one likes Rider fans except maybe other Rider fans."
CFL,3d12d1,omegatron20xx,11,Mon Jul 13 01:55:35 2015 UTC,"Well, Saskatchewan makes a good claim for having the worst fans in sports (as in obnoxious and annoying). Whether they're also the best is less clear, but I think there are a lot of great Rider fans. The worse the Riders do, the better the fans seem, though. There's nothing worse than a Rider fan when they're winning."

I cheer for the Bombers when my Riders aren't involved.  But come labour day and banjo bowl, the shirt runs green.  I hope it's a great season for the Bombers.  I would love to see them play in the big game at home this year."
CFL,3d12d1,Tyrango,4,Mon Jul 13 02:37:07 2015 UTC,Give me a break. I went to banjo bowl last year and bluebomber fans cheered themselves as being the best fans in the league and not an hour latter cheered as Durant was announced injured and hauled off the field. My friends were then pushed from behind as they left the stadium. One fan would turn around in his seat and look for a rider fan tell to go fuck himself whenever the bluebombers scored. None of this was prompted by anything on our part (we would cheer our team on but that was it).
CFL,3d12d1,monsterosity,0,Mon Jul 13 02:23:05 2015 UTC,Yeah Labour day in Saskatchewan is way worse.  I have seen food thrown towards Bomber fans around me.  All a Bomber fan did was move his mouth.  I never said all Bomber fans were classy.

I don't know if it's always like this early in the year or what, but it felt like the stadium was half empty for the home opener, which I though was pretty pathetic.  Officially there were 27k at the game, but I doubt that many game through the gate."
CFL,3d12d1,pudds,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:43:55 2015 UTC,The Montreal game was at a bad time.  Also Friday games get less due to 90% of Winnipeg going to the Cabin.  Lots of people left Hamilton early.

CFL,3cx689,JasonBourne008,3,Sat Jul 11 15:49:25 2015 UTC,"Well, the CFL only has 4 games a week and at most 2 games on the same day, so they can afford to show more.  Also these highlight packages wouldn't be the same ones you would see on sportscenter, they are typically closer in length to the NFL highlights."
CFL,3cx689,omegatron20xx,2,Sat Jul 11 16:18:03 2015 UTC,"That is correct. However, the NFL has boatloads more money than the CFL, so they could create great video highlights if they wanted to."
CFL,3cx689,dotCeh,3,Sat Jul 11 17:34:05 2015 UTC,"yea, but they also need something for NFL Network, which usually has longer highlight packages, and for their regular networks to use."

CFL,3cx689,benjarvus,1 point,Sun Jul 12 00:19:36 2015 UTC,"Up until around 4 years ago there NFL would put out a separate highlight package that was highlights plus the radio announcers voiceover, they were pretty comprehensive.

CFL,3cwxta,ryanwmc,2,Sun Jul 12 03:58:55 2015 UTC,"I more worried about winning games then I am them jumping ship. I suppose there is some worry, but Fuller needs to stay healthy for the season before he thinks about the NFL."
CFL,3cwxta,RaptorsFromSpace,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:03:38 2015 UTC,That's fair I felt the same about Breaux last year and it was a forgone conclusion as long as he stayed healthy that he would be heading to the NFL.

CFL,3cwxta,ryanwmc,1 point,Sun Jul 12 22:55:30 2015 UTC,"There's been some buzz, but not a lot. Maybe more towards the end of the season depending on if he continues making plays."
CFL,3cwx6m,Stach37,8,Sat Jul 11 14:20:27 2015 UTC,I don't like the idea of the league-wide Hall of Fame being tied to one team's stadium.
CFL,3cwx6m,Guy_Buttersnaps,10,Sat Jul 11 15:24:01 2015 UTC,"I understand that concern, but ultimately it's being moved to where it's more relevant. This is an act of desperation by the Hamilton city council because the Hall of Fame was simply a massive drain on resources. It was getting almost no interest on it's own, so moving it into Ivor Wynne will likely increase the attention that it gets. It makes sense to put the Hall of Fame where football fans are, rather than expecting them to go and seek it out on their own."

Uncertainty at QB position is a concern, but fields a strong defence.  Stadium: Percival Molson Memorial Stadium  Fans: The most loyal fans in the East.  Very passionate about the game and about their team.  More relaxed than Rider or Blue Bomber fans, but just as supportive.  AKA: ""Als,"" ""Larks,"" ""The French Team,"" ""Patriots North""  Toronto Argonauts  Comparable to: New York Giants (lead by Drew Brees)  Key Players: Rick Ray (injured but returning QB), Chad Ownens (WR), Brandon Whitaker (RB)  Style: Balanced* Offense, Pass Rush Defence  Story:  The oldest sporting team in North America that still exists, and one of the all time dominants of the CFL.  Always competitive - ""the team has followed the great tradition of never rebuilding, but always reloading."" (/u/CanadianGladiator)  Stadium: Rogers Centre  Fans: Weakest fan base in the CFL.  Despite being in the largest Canadian city, and the best sporting team in the city, support and turnout is relatively low.  Best known fan is former-Crack-Mayor Rob Ford.  AKA: ""Argos,"" ""Boatmen,"" ""Double Blue,"" ""Scullers""   - Balanced in the CFL is still about a 60/40 split of passing to rushing.   Ottawa Redblacks  Comparable to: Jacksonville Jaguars (lead by elderly Cam Newton)  Key Players: Henry  ""Smiling Hank"" Burris (QB), Jovon Johnson (DB), Chris Williams (WR)  Style: Balanced* Offense, Pass Coverage Defence  Story:  Brought back to life for a second time, the resilient Ottawa franchise had a rough time in their first year back.  Things seem to have improved, as the team is more cohesive and pulling off unlikely victories already.  Stadium: TD Place Stadium  Fans:  Small but growing fanbase with a few loving supporters that never gave up.  Need a winning season to really swell support for the team.

Stadium: Tim Hortons Field  Fans:  Fans stuck loyally to this team during a decade when they could have justifiably abandoned ship.  Seeing increased support with recent winning seasons.

Also famous for their beer snakes during games  AKA: ""Bombers,"" ""Blue and Gold,"" ""Big Blue,"" ""True Blue""  Saskatchewan Roughriders  Comparable to: Green Bay Packers  Key Players: Kevin Glenn (the cursed backup QB), John Chick (DE), Paul McCallum (PK)  Style: Rush Heavy Offense, Run Stopping Defence  Story: Once the lovable losers of the CFL (at one time 2-14 in Grey Cup appearances) the Riders recent decade of success has made the Riders even more loved and more hated than ever before.  Stadium: Mosaic Stadium at Taylor Field  Fans: The most dedicated fans in the CFL, you will see Rider fans as almost every CFL game, regardless of who is playing.  Recent success has seen new bandwagon hoppers.  Celebrity fans include Snoop Dogg, and Tom Hanks  AKA: ""Riders,"" ""the Green and White,"" ""Jolly Green Giants,"" ""Melon Heads"" (fans)  Calgary Stampeders  Comparable to: Dallas Cowboys  Key Players: Jon Cornish (RB), Bo Levi Mitchell (QB), Charleston Hughes (DL)  Style: Run-to-set-up-the-pass Offense, Pass Rush Defence  Story: Last years machine was one of the best CFL teams ever fielded, winning more than 80% of their games.  Defending Grey Cup Champions. They look to dominate the league again this year, as Calgary always fields a powerful and aggressive offence.  Stadium: McMahon Stadium  Fans: Extremely loyal and supportive, although you might find the stadium packed with Rider fans when they come to town.  Football is a big deal on the prairies and Calgary is no exception.  AKA: ""Stamps,"" ""Horsemen""  Edmonton Eskimos  Comparable to: Kansas City Chiefs (with Packers Jerseys)  Key Players: Mike Reilly (QB), Dexter McCoil (LB), Adarius Bowman (WR)  Style: Balanced* Offence, Solid Linebacking unit  Story:  They were a strong team to start this millennium, but for the past few years things on offence just haven't seemed to click.  Never to be counted out though, the defence is a force to be reckoned with.  Stadium: Commonwealth Stadium  Fans:  Just like the Stampeders, the Eskimos have an army of dedicated fans who love their team almost as much as their NHL franchise.  The Labour Day Classic (Battle for Alberta) is always one of the best games of the year.  AKA: ""Esks,"" ""Eskies,"" ""The Double-E""  B.C. Lions  Comparable to:  San Francisco 49ers (lead by Sam Bradford)  Key Players: Travis Lulay (QB), Austin Collie (WR), Solomon Elimimian (LB)  Style: Pass Heavy Offence, Pass Coverage Defence  Story:  The other great dynasty of the last fifteen years, the Lions are in a bit of a rebuilding phase.  Always a passing team, and always trying to field the best receivers in the league, BC is always competitive.    Stadium: BC Place  Fans: Support in Vancouver is middling to low, but grows as you move away from downtown to the suburbs and inland towns.  Celebrity fans include: Pamela Anderson, Michael Buble, Dennis Leary, and Billy Ray Cyrus.  AKA: ""Leos"""
CFL,3cv9md,JoshwayTV,2,Sat Jul 11 06:03:39 2015 UTC,Is that Martin Short next to Tom Hanks?
CFL,3cv9md,nostredummass,2,Sat Jul 11 14:25:03 2015 UTC,Ya they went to the Grey Cup together that year.
CFL,3cv9md,willhamaker,0,Sat Jul 11 15:26:37 2015 UTC,"""Fans: The most loyal fans in the East.""  WAY OFF! Alouettes haven't filled their 25,000 seat stadium 3 seasons.  The ""dominant dynasty"" under Calvillo saw the Alouettes lose 5 out of 8 Grey Cup appearances...which explains SOME of the lukewarm reception this team gets in the city. Maybe with Cato...  The CFL franchise in Montreal has gone under twice already, and coupled with the loss of the Expos makes Montreal sports fans (of ANYTHING other than the Habs) the worst in the country. Ticats fans are (by far) the best and most loyal in the East followed by Ottawa."
CFL,3cv9md,SlumdogSkillionaire,2,Sat Jul 11 13:21:47 2015 UTC,As a former free agent who just found his team I found this very helpful: https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/fk44p/assistance_in_choosing_your_cfl_team/ Go Bombers
CFL,3cv9md,nostredummass,2,Sat Jul 11 02:36:33 2015 UTC,Because we've been in the Grey Cup both of the past two years. No shame in hopping on the bandwagon if you're just starting out.
CFL,3cv9md,dotCeh,2,Sat Jul 11 05:47:33 2015 UTC,"As far as what team the Alouettes resemble I have to respectfully disagree with the commentator that says the Patriots. Under Cato the closest team to these Alouettes is the Seattle Seahawks. Cato destroyed Russell Wilson's  record for consecutive games with a TD. The Alouettes defence is agressive with a great line, linebackers and secondary. Their running back, while not a beast, is a smaller CFL smashmouth equivalent. Great returner in Stephan Logan. In fact...all things considered...the Alouettes have a better receiving corps than the Hawks. The only GLARING difference is the Head Coach. Higgins has an ""insy"" personality....and is a bit of an embarrassment.  Otherwise TWINSEYS!!!"

CFL,3ctr09,BallSoHerd,3,Fri Jul 10 20:29:32 2015 UTC,Don't fall for it. Montreal has found their new star QB every year for one year since calvio retired. Cato will be gone sometime this year almost undoubtedly.

CFL,3ctr09,mcorcoran3,3,Sat Jul 11 00:54:01 2015 UTC,Cato has a bunch of raw natural skill... If this is how he plays on instinct as a rookie... then I can see a bright future for this kid. I am not saying he is going to beat Anthony Calvillo'd records... but he may be the next star... if they keep him around... I can see him being used as trade bait seeing as though he was #3 which means they think higher of the other 2 guys.
CFL,3ctr09,goofy_ia,2,Sat Jul 11 00:58:48 2015 UTC,"Not necessarily.  He was #3 in part because he joined the team much later.  He didn't enter the CFL draft because he was focusing all his energy on the NFL draft.  He didn't show up to a lot of Arena/CFL workouts because he was just interested in the NFL.  This whole thing has been a pretty major after thought, if what's been reported about Cato is accurate."

CFL,3ctr09,RaptorsFromSpace,2,Sat Jul 11 00:42:00 2015 UTC,I am pretty sure that this Touchdown had the player AND the ball gross the Goal Line...
CFL,3ctr09,goofy_ia,2,Sat Jul 11 00:28:16 2015 UTC,Thanks for the insight on a controversial play from the panel. Dorks.
CFL,3ctr09,FondleOtter,2,Sat Jul 11 00:34:05 2015 UTC,Panel didn't want to touch that with a ten foot pole.
CFL,3ctr09,HollowWiener,4,Sat Jul 11 00:34:09 2015 UTC,The fact they were talking about the angle showing the ball (since we see the foot clearly) tells me that it's definitely the ball that matters when you're running it in though.
CFL,3ctr09,PolarOpposites8,3,Sat Jul 11 00:35:31 2015 UTC,"Dunnigan specifically said that the ball has to cross, not the player."
CFL,3ctr09,HollowWiener,3,Sat Jul 11 00:38:50 2015 UTC,Which is what I thought. I'm confused why we are being quoted the rule which I believe a user is misinterpreting.

CFL,3ctr09,Reddit4LifeDawg,2,Sat Jul 11 02:00:13 2015 UTC,"That PI is something that would holdup 100% if it was called on the field, but since it wasn't called the command centre will never overturn it.  That same play has already been called PI or illegal contact half a dozen times already. The camera angles were shit obviously, but in a year when the refs throw the flag if a DB even breathes on a receiver, I think they could make the call since the DB had his arm on the receiver for a full second before the ball arrived.   I'm not upset about the non-call, I'm upset that the refs don't call that when they call it every time a DB gets within a foot of a receiver.  I would take consistently bad calls over these inconsistent bad calls any day since at least the defence knows what the fuck they are allowed to do.  Half the teams are letting the receiver catch the ball and take a step before making contact since they don't want to take a penalty."
CFL,3ctr09,skippy2893,2,Sat Jul 11 02:01:18 2015 UTC,"So when the Stamps short yardage clearly gets a TD they rule there's  'inconclusive evidence'. But when Montreal has conclusive evidence that it didn't go in, it's a TD.   These refs man..."

CFL,3ctr4a,dcm386,15,Sat Jul 11 05:28:13 2015 UTC,This game is on Chamblin. First he goes for it on third down when all he had to do was punt and they would have pinned BC within their own 20 with 35 seconds. Then he kicks a fucking field goal on 3 and a foot. A kick in overtime does nothing but give you a chance at double overtime. Our offence has scored all night when we needed it but he would rather trust our defence to hold BC from get 35 fucking yards. Chamblin has blown two games in a row with his atrocious game calls.

CFL,3ctr4a,HomerSPC,3,Sat Jul 11 02:26:54 2015 UTC,"I've moved out east, it's dawning on me how hard it's going to be keeping up with these late start games (moreso once NHL is back)."
CFL,3ctr4a,benjarvus,3,Sat Jul 11 02:30:27 2015 UTC,Dressler was obviously the hot matchup this week jesus.
CFL,3ctr4a,skippy2893,3,Sat Jul 11 02:34:35 2015 UTC,Lulay is such a priss he needs a trainer to put on his eye black!  #Trashtalk
CFL,3ctr4a,HomerSPC,5,Sat Jul 11 02:42:05 2015 UTC,"He has to, ever since that one time..."
CFL,3ctr4a,bigwilliec,3,Sat Jul 11 02:46:52 2015 UTC,"IMO penalizing the flag gesture is a continuation of the notion that you should be disciplined and control your emotions, whether it's this or not taking a retaliation swing/shove at a guy."
CFL,3ctr4a,ponimaju,3,Sat Jul 11 03:38:14 2015 UTC,Lions are just dedicated to providing balls for minor football on field goal at a time
CFL,3ctr4a,Xmr_bubbleX,3,Sat Jul 11 03:58:20 2015 UTC,I'm here to bandwagon the team Austin Collie is on.   I am disappointed.
CFL,3ctr4a,Simpleton216,3,Sat Jul 11 03:58:56 2015 UTC,Lulay killing his receivers on the edge tonight.

CFL,3ctr4a,AvsFan23,3,Sat Jul 11 05:24:15 2015 UTC,Why would we go for a field goal? Why? Best case scenario we go to second overtime
CFL,3ctr4a,skippy2893,3,Sat Jul 11 05:26:30 2015 UTC,fun ending
CFL,3ctr4a,polarbear81,3,Sat Jul 11 05:28:21 2015 UTC,Most fun I've had at a game in years! Also fuck the no contact rules!
CFL,3ctr4a,Xmr_bubbleX,3,Sat Jul 11 05:30:40 2015 UTC,Classic Riders.  Playing shitty when it counts the most.  8-10 here we come.
CFL,3ctr4a,CarlSpackler22,3,Sat Jul 11 05:32:52 2015 UTC,Good thing I didn't change the channel when I thought it was over in the 4th. Great comeback win.

CFL,3ctr4a,coelurosauravus,1 point,Sat Jul 11 02:13:51 2015 UTC,"I live in Vancouver and used to work close to that steam clock. It's cool but it's not even historic. The city installed it in the 70s to attract tourists, and it worked because in the summer there was always a gigantic crowd around the thing from 10-4."
CFL,3ctr4a,RaptorsFromSpace,1 point,Sat Jul 11 02:22:59 2015 UTC,It looks nice! If I was within a thousand miles of it I would go!
CFL,3ctr4a,goofy_ia,6,Sat Jul 11 02:14:30 2015 UTC,What a weird call. If they're ruling forward progress that totally should have been a first down.
CFL,3ctr4a,PickerPilgrim,6,Sat Jul 11 05:12:38 2015 UTC,field goal dance.
CFL,3ctr4a,Simpleton216,7,Sat Jul 11 05:17:04 2015 UTC,"I just tuned in with less than two minutes left in the game, but wow, this is exciting.  I clearly need to watch more CFL."
CFL,3ctr4a,arichi,4,Sat Jul 11 05:18:26 2015 UTC,A professional football league where the Lions can win.  What a world!  The next game is on Monday night?  I want more CFL now.  It's been five minutes and I'm hooked.
CFL,3ctr4a,arichi,3,Sat Jul 11 05:29:56 2015 UTC,"Toronto and Calgary on Monday. The schedule is a bit weird this week, we don't usually have Monday games and there is usually a Saturday game."
CFL,3ctr4a,bquinho,2,Sat Jul 11 05:32:01 2015 UTC,"Yep, Calgary v. Toronto in a Blue Moon Game. CFL doesn't do Monday night games, but this one had to be on Monday because of availability."
CFL,3ctr4a,dotCeh,3,Sat Jul 11 05:31:30 2015 UTC,Lulay looked out of rhythm until the fourth. Collie looks like he is adapting well to the CFL. But amazing fourth quarter by the lions offense!

CFL,3ctr4a,RaptorsFromSpace,3,Sat Jul 11 02:26:58 2015 UTC,Am I alone in missing the riders all in white? They looked like green & white storm troopers. Hoping they just switched the uniform up for this game.
CFL,3ctr4a,OdetoPoutine,5,Sat Jul 11 03:43:19 2015 UTC,The Riders have a better record when they have white helmets plus they look slick.
CFL,3ctr4a,skippy2893,2,Sat Jul 11 03:44:09 2015 UTC,Exactly! With the white face masks too? Super nice.
CFL,3ctr4a,OdetoPoutine,2,Sat Jul 11 03:45:12 2015 UTC,Kory Sheets was unstoppable in them. It was basically a guaranteed win every time.

CFL,3ctr4a,goofy_ia,2,Sat Jul 11 04:07:39 2015 UTC,Hate to say it but I agree. Those uniforms were sliiiiiick.
CFL,3ctr4a,schmidtzkrieg,4,Sat Jul 11 03:51:42 2015 UTC,Seems like you guys got a pretty good kicker over there in Sask. QBs not bad either...
CFL,3ctr4a,KamikazeCanuck,3,Sat Jul 11 04:55:13 2015 UTC,We liked that Geroy character as well.
CFL,3ctr4a,chase82,4,Sat Jul 11 05:03:20 2015 UTC,Bullshit call. Forward progress is clearly stopped before that fumble.  Edit: Not sure how he didn't get the 10 inches he needed.
CFL,3ctr4a,dcm386,5,Sat Jul 11 05:07:28 2015 UTC,Tedford is lovin' it
CFL,3ctr4a,BalesofNay,4,Sat Jul 11 05:21:17 2015 UTC,"Riders just can't buy a win this year, huge third down stuff by Bighill, and Leone has ice in his veins.   This is why we all love the CFL, what an absolutely crazy finish. Love Tedford's reaction like he just scored a goal in the Stanley Cup Finals. No idea who takes this in OT, just happy to see some bonus football, probably won't be as happy at work tomorrow morning."

CFL,3ctr4a,FondleOtter,2,Sat Jul 11 02:02:31 2015 UTC,I am loving the fact that I am a fan now of the CFL and have not settled on ANY team... I enjoy the games! And lets all be real.. that is what it is all about! Having fun!
CFL,3ctr4a,goofy_ia,2,Sat Jul 11 02:06:58 2015 UTC,It's almost better in a way not choosing a favorite. That way you can enjoy every play

CFL,3ctr4a,FondleOtter,2,Sat Jul 11 02:27:21 2015 UTC,"And that was going where, exactly?"
CFL,3ctr4a,ababcock1,3,Sat Jul 11 02:36:23 2015 UTC,"Taj was supposed to curl in front of the half back but extended the route. It looks dumb on tv, but it was a bad read by the receiver. If the db stays deep then you are supposed to break off the route and curl in front."
CFL,3ctr4a,skippy2893,2,Sat Jul 11 02:38:43 2015 UTC,Jesus Taj. Stop fucking up routes.
CFL,3ctr4a,skippy2893,2,Sat Jul 11 02:36:49 2015 UTC,I like Lulay.
CFL,3ctr4a,goofy_ia,2,Sat Jul 11 02:47:59 2015 UTC,Holding on the matchup against Alex Hall?

CFL,3ctr4a,ababcock1,2,Sat Jul 11 03:16:13 2015 UTC,That's the stupid shit that QBs do not need to take. What a piece of shit move
CFL,3ctr4a,chase82,2,Sat Jul 11 03:18:10 2015 UTC,This Erly dude is swinging a decent ball hammer
CFL,3ctr4a,chase82,2,Sat Jul 11 03:21:10 2015 UTC,Wow receiver 2 yards offside and no call.
CFL,3ctr4a,skippy2893,2,Sat Jul 11 03:24:17 2015 UTC,Bloop!
CFL,3ctr4a,ababcock1,2,Sat Jul 11 03:26:30 2015 UTC,You fucked up BC #85...
CFL,3ctr4a,dotCeh,2,Sat Jul 11 03:51:45 2015 UTC,"God damn I hate when the Riders run a 3 man front. Literally every passing first down has come from the 30 front.  All the successful teams this year are using a 4 man front with blitzing. All the shit teams are using a 3 man front with extra defenders in zone coverage. It doesn't work, it just gives the QB more time."
CFL,3ctr4a,skippy2893,2,Sat Jul 11 03:54:03 2015 UTC,"Dressler, you magnificent midget.  Since they're not playing Messam enough, you sure stepped up on my fantasy picks."
CFL,3ctr4a,HomerSPC,2,Sat Jul 11 04:10:03 2015 UTC,So glad they spent the cash and brought him back last year.
CFL,3ctr4a,FondleOtter,2,Sat Jul 11 04:10:39 2015 UTC,How often does BC close the upperdeck? The crowd looks much better.
CFL,3ctr4a,bquinho,3,Sat Jul 11 04:12:08 2015 UTC,New this year.  I believe they have to retain this seating configuration for the season.
CFL,3ctr4a,HomerSPC,3,Sat Jul 11 04:14:35 2015 UTC,"I thought they only did this for Whitecaps games, this is new I think."
CFL,3ctr4a,schmidtzkrieg,2,Sat Jul 11 04:16:54 2015 UTC,I think it will make a huge difference for atmosphere. It's an appropriate size now for the team
CFL,3ctr4a,FondleOtter,2,Sat Jul 11 04:16:57 2015 UTC,Also cannot hold nearly as much.

CFL,3ctr4a,KamikazeCanuck,2,Sat Jul 11 05:16:32 2015 UTC,Tedford looking rather excited.
CFL,3ctr4a,PickerPilgrim,2,Sat Jul 11 05:17:15 2015 UTC,If only he hit that PAT the game would be over now. Misses the 32 hits the 50+ one.

CFL,3ctdx8,dotCeh,2,Fri Jul 10 17:37:19 2015 UTC,"Does anybody really like seeing drives extended and scores run up simply because of weak/questionable calls?  People don't mind low scoring games as long as they're fun/interesting, with lots of big plays in all phases.  I don't think they needed to make the changes to the passing game; offence was down last year because of all the QB injuries and the REDBLACKS not being able to catch a damn pass."
CFL,3ctdx8,ponimaju,1 point,Fri Jul 10 22:42:12 2015 UTC,I like that something can actually happen on every play.  That wasn't true the last few years...
CFL,3ctdx8,chakfel,1 point,Fri Jul 10 23:42:03 2015 UTC,"Points are up because DB's are used to playing with contact during the scramble - which leads to questionable defensive pass interference calls, which extend drives.

CFL,3ctdx8,dsonnance,1 point,Fri Jul 10 23:35:30 2015 UTC,"This whole more scoring equals more fun idea is stupid. If that was the case soccer wouldn't be popular at all. I would rather watch a defencive back make a play, rather than play to avoid a questionable call. It's about the ""artistry"" of the play, not just watching a number on the scoreboard run up.  I would rather have fewer flags and fewer touchdowns any day. Get rid of the new rules."

If a half-baked gay joke is what passes for banter north of the border, then you really need to up your game. I suspect that he couldn't trash talk his way out of a trash bag on the trash-talkingest day of his life even if he had the assistance of an electrified trash talking machine.  For my own sake, I hope that the Winnipeg's defense plays football better than their fans trash talk, otherwise I'm afraid that I might actually get bored of watching Rakeem Cato throw sick touchdown passes tomorrow.  Speaking of tomorrow, on July 10th 1871, the first Dominion Land Survey monument was placed just west of Winnipeg. What a coincidence that tomorrow, exactly 144 years later, construction of a new monument will begin to honor the memory of Drew Willy who died tragically after suffering two on-field concussions in one week."

You've gone 2 and 0 by beating sad green teams, but you're gonna have to face a real western opponent now.   Do you even have a quarterback? I mean if Ricky Ray was healthy you might have a chance. Ricky Ray almost sounds like he has two first names, like any real quarterback should. If his name was like Ricky Ray Johnson, or Ricky Ray Wilcox, or Ray Wylie Hubbard or something he would be a real badass. But he's not and Ray is his last name. What the hell? And who the hell is Trevor Harris? You can't even make it sound like he has two first names. Trevor Ray? Bo Trevor? NOPE.

Meanwhile, Bo Levi Miss-ya alternated between throwing the ball over receivers heads and at their feet. I guess the NDP government in Alberta mandated an equal share of footballs need to be given to the turf? Not only that, but how many two and outs did you have against Montreal? If you repeat that performance against the Argos, at least it'll give Jon Cornish more time to do what he does best: make pouty faces on the sideline.

CFL,3cl1ko,ponimaju,4,Thu Jul 9 04:46:16 2015 UTC,"I argue with a couple of my friends about this all the time.  The fact of the matter is that even those good Alabama teams didn't have enough pro quality players to make up an entire 50+ man roster team that could compete against a CFL roster out of the gate (sure, you might have surefire NFL OLs, DLs, LBs, and maybe a WR or RB, but a lot of the other positions, and all the backups, are guys that will never even be invited to a pro camp, let alone be drafted or otherwise make it into the NFL or CFL).  And regardless of whether or not they did or did not go on to success at the pro level, in this hypothetical situation you're pitting college guys with no pro experience, some of them freshman/sophomores, against a hypothetical CFL team filled with men, pros, the best roster that the team could put together through a weeding out process of drafting, signing, camp, etc.  You can't for example say, okay, the it's 2012 Alabama squad with all these NFLers but in 2015, some with a few years of NFL experience already.  And quarterbacks are a huge if - who knows what AJ McCarron will do if he ever plays (and look at what happened with Blake Sims and Rakeem Cato - Sims didn't even make a roster [cut even before getting a shot to play in preseason], and Cato lit it up in his first ever CFL start)."

CFL,3cktb6,OlderThanGif,3,Wed Jul 8 19:00:56 2015 UTC,"REVIEWABLE PLAYS - GUIDING PRINCIPLES  The instant replay system will cover a variety of plays in three main areas:   possession rulings in the end zone; forward progress with respect to first down or goal line; and end zone plays involving the sideline in goal and dead ball line passing plays – pass complete or incomplete. other detectable situations, such as a ball carrier ruled down by contact, and a fumble which occurred prior to down by contact   NOT REVIEWABLE PLAYS  These include, but are not limited to:   Proper down Status of the clock Penalty calls and their Administration Forward progress not relating to a first down or goal line Force outs on pass plays near a sideline Recovery of loose ball in the field of play   REVIEWABLE PLAYS - SPECIFICS  Not all plays are reviewable, according to the Guiding Principles identified on the previous page. The specific kinds of plays that are reviewable are:  (a) Plays governed by Sideline, Goal line, End Zone and Dead Ball Line:   Scoring plays, including a runner breaking the plane of the goal line. Pass complete / incomplete / intercepted at sideline, goal line, sideline in goal, and dead ball line. In, or out of bounds ruling on a ball carrier / receiver. In, or out of bounds related to last touching / recovery of loose ball. Forward progress on a third down play, relating to first down.   (b) Passing Plays:   Pass ruled complete / incomplete / intercepted in the field of play. Touching of a forward pass by an ineligible receiver. Touching of a forward pass by a defensive player (makes all players eligible). Quarterback (Passer) forward pass or fumble. Illegal forward pass beyond the line of scrimmage. Onside / offside pass beyond the line of scrimmage. Forward pass or onside pass thrown behind the line of scrimmage. A simultaneous catch to determine the team entitled to possession.   (c) Other Detectable Situations:   Ball carrier ruled down by contact. Fumble prior to ruling down by contact Touching of a kick. Onside players on a kick. Where a turnover is the direct result of a major foul which was not penalized (e.g. clothesline which caused a fumble, face mask on a tackle when a fumble occurs) Note: The reviewable aspect of this play is that the alleged major foul was the primary cause of the turnover. If there was no change of possession, this play is not reviewable.   REVIEWABLE PLAY TYPES  (a) Kickoffs  On a kick off, until the ball is legally in possession, the only reviewable aspects are whether the ball is legally touched and who touched first, or last, before going out of bounds.  (b) Running Plays  On running plays there are four basic situations which are reviewable: 1. Determining whether a ball carrier is down / not down by contact. Replay may also confirm a fumble prior to down by contact. 2. Determining whether the ball in possession breaks the plane of the goal line. 3. Determining whether first down yardage has been gained on 3rd down play. 4. Determining whether a ball carrier had stepped out of bounds.  (c) Passing Plays  There are a number of situations where a pass play is reviewable, including the following major categories:   When a pass is ruled completed, and subsequent review shows it incomplete, it shall be ruled incomplete with downs continuing. When the QB is hit while throwing: if it is ruled as a fumble and the offence successfully challenges the play as an incomplete pass; if the correct ruling is incomplete pass, the ball shall be ruled incomplete with downs continuing. Where a pass is ruled complete / incomplete near a sideline, goal line, sideline in goal or dead ball line.   (d) Kicking Plays  Plays that are reviewable primarily involve:   touching of the ball  reception of the ball at the boundary lines  determination of possible onside players  whether a Field Goal or kicked Convert was successful or not   (e) Scoring Plays  All scoring plays will be automatically reviewed by the replay official in the command centre. In addition all attempts of Field Goals and kicked Convert that have been ruled unsuccessful shall be automatically reviewed.  (f) Plays Involving Offside Passes Or Forward Passes Made After Crossing The Line Of Scrimmage  Where a pass is thrown in a forward or offside direction, and is not a legal forward pass   offside pass, whenever and wherever it occurs illegal forward pass - passer crossing the line of scrimmage and making forward pass   (g) Game Administration  Instant replay can be used for timing, downs and distance only in conjunction with a reviewable play.  Situations involving the clock; penalty administration; spotting the ball other than for first down; etc. are not reviewable.  When reviewing a play, the Referee may change the ruling on any reviewable aspect of the play.  Penalties which are created as a direct result of the change in ruling may be applied even though a flag had not been thrown, and penalties that were called during the play may be cancelled as a direct result of the change in ruling.  A penalty which occurred after the ball was ruled dead by replay review will not be applied, unless it is a Major Foul.  When the Referee changes the ruling based on an aspect of the play other than what was challenged, the challenging team retains their challenge and is not charged a time out."

CFL,3cktb6,werbo,3,Wed Jul 8 19:10:45 2015 UTC,There was a thread about this in /r/riderville and I still say he was onside. (Keep in mind that players in motion forward can be in the neutral zone. You do not have to be behind the line of scrimmage at the snap to be considered onside)

CFL,3cktb6,bquinho,3,Wed Jul 8 21:00:45 2015 UTC,So slotbacks are allowed to be within a yard ahead of the ball when its snapped? TIL
CFL,3cktb6,cat-n-jazz,3,Wed Jul 8 18:57:22 2015 UTC,"Yup. Line Judges/Head Linesmen are often taught the rule of thumb of ""if you can see the ball behind the receivers' feet"" for determining if he was offside or not, because it's a tricky one to get precisely right, considering how quickly the slotbacks are running."
CFL,3cktb6,CanadianCardsFan,2,Wed Jul 8 18:59:22 2015 UTC,That makes a lot of sense cause slotbacks tend to look offside a lot.
CFL,3cktb6,dotCeh,2,Wed Jul 8 19:07:24 2015 UTC,"Wait, what?? You can be ahead of the line of scrimmage as long as you're in the neutral zone?"
CFL,3cktb6,falsekoala,2,Wed Jul 8 19:04:30 2015 UTC,"Only in so far as calling a player offside while in motion towards the line is a bitch of a call to make. So the rule of thumb is that you need to see the ball behind the player to confirm they are offside.   You are taught as a referee that you only call the fouls that you see, so extrapolation and assuming is a no-go."

It would be better if they could balance the conferences better so that the schedules worked out but anyway, the only reason I criticize this being the 3rd team is because there was such a huge thing about how the fans are the greatest fans in the league and also people chirp the riders for them almost folding in the 90s but don't remember it was the fans that saved them."
CFL,3cmavu,But-Seriously-Though,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:09:18 2015 UTC,"The Renegades averaged 22k fans per game over 4 (horrible) years in a broken down stadium and next to no help from the city (public transportation, etc.).  The Rough Riders only had one bad particularly attendance in 1996 (their swan song yea) but even that was comparable to league averages around the league in the years before and after.  The fans deserve credit as loyal fans after all the garbage they've put up with. You won't hear many of us saying we're better than the Riders fans (that's a whole culture of its own) but the amount of pure bullshit that gets spewed about undeserving fans and a bad market (even in our own city) is infuriating to those of us who lived through what actually happened."

CFL,3cih5h,Rance_Mulliniks,4,Wed Jul 8 23:19:42 2015 UTC,"This is exactly why I feel there has been so many QB injuries. The rule changes don't allow any contact on the receiver past 5 yards. So, teams are blitzing more frequently and/or trying to put more pressure on the QBs because that disrupts the play at the source.  In essence, I believe the rule changes in the off season, are contributing to all the QB injuries. It was very short sighted of the league and the GMs to not anticipate this result. It is only going to get worse once more teams figure it out."

I'm gonna eat my own words from the pre season a bit because I think it was you I debated with about the quality of Willy as a QB, he's improved tons since he was a rider, I didn't think the willy we had could ever be a starter but I have been proven wrong with his play against us and before the hit against hamilton. I can admit when I'm wrong and as much as it kills me to say it the bombers have a helluva QB, far from the 8th best that I said he was."

Whether we ""deserved"" another team is a question to be debated, I think we're still proving that we deserve to have it. I think the city of Ottawa needs to show all the other CFL communities as well as the CFL itself that we are truly a CFL town and we can support our team regardless.

So this winter he started to train with kf sports and did their 7 v 7 program... which goes to various tourneys in the states.  I have to think this more or less the right track... at the same time not sure if playing 'regular' football in the rep leagues is 'better' or if programs like kf sports playing 7v7 is the way to go.  I'm 100% behind the decisions my son is making on where/what he wants to do, but I don't know anyone who played post highschool to know if he is making the right decisions to put himself in a position to get a scholarship for usa/canada colleges / universities.

CFL,3cggv0,CanadianGladiator,2,Wed Jul 8 04:11:07 2015 UTC,"Hey /u/CanadianGladiators, get on this! /u/RaptorsFromSpace goes way back in the /r/cfl history books."
CFL,3cggv0,CanadianGladiator,1 point,Wed Jul 8 05:19:32 2015 UTC,"Ahem, I'll do one. With one rule. No questions, only statements"
CFL,3cggv0,CanadianGladiator,2,Tue Jul 7 18:52:37 2015 UTC,Is no a statement.
CFL,3cggv0,ponimaju,2,Tue Jul 7 19:07:52 2015 UTC,:( oh
CFL,3cggv0,CaptainHadley,2,Wed Jul 8 01:38:06 2015 UTC,Where do you see /r/cfl going in the future?
CFL,3cggv0,CanadianGladiator,6,Wed Jul 8 23:05:04 2015 UTC,"Hopefully more interactive users and I can take a step back of posting all the news articles because everyone else will beat me to the punch (not that I mind, I enjoy keeping everyone informed).  I'd also like to see some corporation between this Sub and the league. The league wants so bad to attract a younger demographic and I think this would be the perfect place to start.   EDIT: Not to mention our ability to pull ""more open minded"" US viewers to watch games."
CFL,3cggv0,CanadianGladiator,3,Tue Jul 7 19:06:47 2015 UTC,"Y'know what's sad? The CFL Twitter feed. It comes across so desperately that it's trying to appeal to youth, but it's cringe worthy. Several times now while live tweeting a game they'll say ""ZOMG"" or use emoji's in a way only adults pretending to be young would. This sub would be perfect to appeal to a younger crowd rather then having a 25 year old intern pretend to be 10 years younger.  I've wanted to get that out of my system for awhile."
CFL,3cggv0,CanadianGladiator,4,Tue Jul 7 19:36:30 2015 UTC,"Their social media manager and I have spoken briefly after the Grey Cup last year.  I was super eager to give the league the stats of all the traffic we brought to our sub, plus the American viewership we brought, plus the youth demographic we had been able to attract.  He seemed thrilled and as soon as I submitted to him the data I never heard from him again. I don't want to personally attack him or allege anything but it was pretty fucking shady on his part, considering we all collectively have built this sub for the benefit of all CFL fans and people who are interested in the CFL. We've done more to explain the game to foreign viewers and bring them in our family oriented community than the league has with Rob Black or Duane Ford constantly repeating ""THE FIELD IS LONGER AND THERES AN EXTRA MAN"".  It's a huge irritant of mine that the league is aware of us but has no desire to cooperate with us.  Their AMA's could have been incredibly successful if they were posted in our sub, we could have gotten real substantive questions, yet they decide to post in the main AMA page and get drowned out and generally flop.   I'm going to keep pushing to co-operate with the league, it's my biggest project behind the scenes, I really want them to see the value in what we do here and how we're able to help drive the CFL fanbase and get that young demographic that they're (terribly) trying to attract"
CFL,3cggv0,CanadianGladiator,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:26:54 2015 UTC,I wonder if we could get players to do AMAs here. I know there's a ton of Stampeders who are active on social media I don't think it would be hard to try to convince one of them to have a crack at it here.

CFL,3cfl1w,sneezypenguin,4,Tue Jul 7 15:06:36 2015 UTC,"I can't believe he's playing. If it was a concussion, which O'Shea is dancing around naming the injury, then he should be out for awhile. I get the feeling Willy may be the next Buck Pierce if the 'Peg isn't careful."
CFL,3cfl1w,Nexcapto,5,Tue Jul 7 17:36:56 2015 UTC,"No one, and I mean NO ONE, will be able to reach the injury milestones that Buck hit."
CFL,3cfl1w,OlderThanGif,5,Tue Jul 7 18:00:26 2015 UTC,"I'm guessing it wasn't actually a concussion? I mean with the league's concussion protocols in and all the big lawsuits in the news, the Bombers organization has to know that, if it they are playing someone with a concussion, they're opening a lot of people up to some major financial consequences down the road. I don't think they'd be stupid enough to do that, but who knows."
CFL,3cfl1w,TheMeatball,1 point,Tue Jul 7 19:12:29 2015 UTC,How could it not be a concussion? He was knocked unconscious. Unless he has narcolepsy that's a pretty damn good indicator that he suffered a concussion.
CFL,3cfl1w,Nexcapto,5,Tue Jul 7 20:53:00 2015 UTC,"I don't know. He claims he wasn't knocked out, and remembers the hit. I'd hope there was a way to tell if a player had symptoms without asking what they feel, but don't think that is the case.   I'm sure if a player wanted to, they could lie to pass protocol. And that is what Arland Bruce basically admits to doing and then tries to sue the league.. Problem with head injuries is they are in your head. :/"
CFL,3cfl1w,RagingIce,2,Tue Jul 7 21:53:24 2015 UTC,He wasn't unconscious - Willy said he remembers the entire play.

CFL,3cfl1w,Vorocano,1 point,Thu Jul 9 03:02:13 2015 UTC,"He better be good and damn recovered from that hit, because Montreal is going to be bringing the house on him on Friday. I hope that Coach O'Shea had Willy practicing quick releases until he could do them in his sleep because Willy's going to get blitzed all night long until he can prove that he can make a defense pay for deciding to blitz.  If Willy is anything less than 100% then let Brohm or Marve play and not take the risk because whoever is behind centre on Friday is going to take a beating."
CFL,3cfl1w,Vorocano,2,Tue Jul 7 22:51:33 2015 UTC,Didja see Brohm play? Marve maybe. But not Brohm.

CFL,3cdcl4,Ricekrisper,6,Wed Jul 8 02:06:44 2015 UTC,"This season has been a total crap shoot with all the upsets and injuries (RIP my CFL Pick'em) but here is my personal rankings:   Hamilton Tiger Cats (1-1) Excellent so far in all aspects of the game, even though they lost a very close game to the defending champions. Toronto Argonauts (2-0) After two solid performances by Harris they have shown that they are contenders  even without Rickey Ray. Calgary Stampeders  (1-1) They haven't played well and I believe the defending champs are a much better team than what they have shown so far this year. Ottawa ROUGE ET NOIR (2-0) Huge difference from the 2-16 team of last season but I am hesitant to put them higher until I see more. Winnipeg Blue Bombers (1-1) Drew Willy and Paris Cotton have been great behind the revamped O-line, but Willy needs to stay healthy. Saskatchewan Roughriders (0-2) I am biased and maybe they deserve to be lower but statistically they are the number one offence and the fifth best defence. They lost two very close games where they moved the ball better than thier opponents. They are a couple turnovers/missed plays from being 2-0. Montreal Alouettes (1-1) They have looked really good and really bad so far. Cato really impressed me but one game isn't enough to make me a believer yet. BC Lions (0-1) They lost to the REDBLACKS but it is tough to start the regular season a week later than everyone else. Edmonton Eskimos (0-1) This team doesn't deserve to be placed here but they were handily defeated by Toronto and now they are without thier starting QB. Nichols and the Eskimos need to step up and show that they are the Grey Cup contenders that they should be.   Wow that was difficult, small difference between 1 and 9. I am interested to see how everyone else makes thier rankings"
CFL,3cdcl4,Handjobber,6,Tue Jul 7 05:21:43 2015 UTC,"No respect for my Als. One relatively narrow loss while losing their #1 and #2 QBs and having to adjust the game plan for it... followed up with blowing out the reigning champs with a freshly signed rookie at QB.  My boy Rakeem Cato's first outing made him look like the lovechild of Doug Flutie and Warren Moon out there. With a little help from my boy Brandon ""Perfect QB Sneak Conversion-rate"" Bridge, my birdies are flying all the way to nest themselves in that sweet, sweet Grey Cup."
CFL,3cdcl4,1niquity,9,Tue Jul 7 06:50:07 2015 UTC,Rakeem Cato is an NFL level QB in a small WR's body. He can be the franchise for you guys.
CFL,3cdcl4,BeeboBaggins,5,Tue Jul 7 11:04:10 2015 UTC,"He showed great accuracy and poise, but when you're dealing with an unknown commodity like Cato it's hard to react as a defense. When there's more tape on him and defenses can get inside his head better, I think he'll settle in. Hard to call him an NFL level QB at this point, but he had a crazy college career and so far so good in the pros."
CFL,3cdcl4,pixel_pete,1 point,Tue Jul 7 13:29:00 2015 UTC,"Great points! They probably should be higher and Cato seems to be a much better option than Crompton at QB. I want to see Cato play some more and be consistent before ranking them higher. Same thing for the REDBLACKS, they should also be higher than #4 but I want to see more than just two good games from them."

CFL,3cdcl4,porcupinetime,3,Tue Jul 7 08:44:35 2015 UTC,"I would agree with you, but stick Montreal at 5 and shift the Bombers and Riders down one each. Montreal had a rough first game that any team would struggle with, and last week utterly crushed my beloved Bo and the Stamps. They have to prove they can sustain this but they have better chances of that than either the Riders at least, I'd tie them with the Bombers if Wily Drew can keep it together. There's no doubt the competition in the east is gonna be fierce this year!  You're right though doing power rankings and pick 'ems at this point in the season is just shooting in the dark... while drunk... on a boat."

CFL,3cdcl4,lord_of_vader,3,Tue Jul 7 17:58:25 2015 UTC,Yeah the Ti-Cats total YPG of 228.5 this year is WAY BETTER than a laughable 261 by the Stamps.
CFL,3cdcl4,bluebomberfan,2,Tue Jul 7 20:24:38 2015 UTC,"Ticats played Winnipeg and half the game was garbage time. Defence just sat back and took on a bend don't break mentally after getting 2 pick sixes and a lead of over 20 points. Plus, Calgary played the als, so of course their numbers look good."
CFL,3cc0g3,sneezypenguin,4,Mon Jul 6 19:02:46 2015 UTC,"Wow, did not expect to see this today.  Hopefully he legitimately did not have a concussion and the doctors aren't just not officially diagnosing it and letting him play anyway."
CFL,3cc0g3,FloppyDriver,2,Mon Jul 6 19:43:00 2015 UTC,He said he never lost consciousness and passed the concussion protocol. He wanted to go back in the game too but the Bombers coaching staff wouldn't let him.

CFL,3cc0g3,Tercotta,2,Tue Jul 7 14:09:27 2015 UTC,"Agreed. I'm actually somewhat impressed with this move. Doc says he's OK, but the coaches all saw that hellacious hit. Nobody can deny that something bad had to have happened, symptoms or not. Not all concussions show up right away, and there's still much we don't know.

CFL,3cc3xl,omegatron20xx,9,Tue Jul 7 02:05:42 2015 UTC,as soon as they saw McCallum could still get his wheel chair ramp into the dressing room yesterday Milo was gone no surprise at all. I just hope Paul still has it.

CFL,3cbbb4,CaptainHadley,3,Mon Jul 6 18:19:24 2015 UTC,"In fairness when he commited to making the tackle his helmet was in the ""strike zone"" and it would have been clean had Willy stayed in the position he was only fractions of a second prior. Thats not me saying I wouldnt fine the guy because as you said its a good way to make an example in a year where so many QBs are going down, but I wouldnt be surprised in the least if nothing comes out of it ."
CFL,3cbbb4,majikmonkie,5,Mon Jul 6 18:30:47 2015 UTC,Your helmet is never supposed to lead in a tackle no matter how low you are hitting.
CFL,3cbbb4,majikmonkie,3,Mon Jul 6 18:33:23 2015 UTC,"I agree that the hit was in the strike zone, but he led with his helmet, and that's not cool. Not an intentional hit to the head, but intentional leading with the helmet."
CFL,3cbbb4,morrise18,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:41:48 2015 UTC,Looks like the CFL agrees with me. He was fined today for leading with his helmet.
CFL,3cbbb4,morrise18,5,Tue Jul 7 23:44:35 2015 UTC,"When the QB is tackled into the player's helmet's path then I don't think it should be called. The ref's usually err on the side of safety and call it, but I think it is kind of an abomination of the rule."
CFL,3cbbb4,HereticS1xth,2,Mon Jul 6 18:27:39 2015 UTC,"I will take your word for it, I was at the game and they didn't give us a replay, real time it looked like a call though."

CFL,3cboas,JLangvee,3,Mon Jul 6 17:37:51 2015 UTC,One of the greatest freakin' QB efforts in Riders history wiped out by a defense that is too afraid to play tight.   Shame.

CFL,3cboas,Stach37,1 point,Mon Jul 6 21:19:03 2015 UTC,There's still a majority of people who believe that Glenn is a bad qb. I never understood it but I think that's how he will be remembered. The BC fan on here (I think his name is werble or something) was arguing that Glenn has never been a good qb. The guy has done nothing but take teams to the playoffs from the backup position and he still gets shit on. Like he took BC to the playoffs when they damn sure wouldn't have made it if they didn't have Glenn but this guy still stands by calling Glenn terrible. No respect.
CFL,3cboas,skippy2893,1 point,Mon Jul 6 23:38:13 2015 UTC,"KG is a solid average QB. He can get you into the playoffs, but he chokes very hard under pressure.

It's sad because if he got over that he'd be one of the greats and probably have a Grey Cup ring or two."

CFL,3c9gdw,silveredge96,10,Mon Jul 6 03:22:14 2015 UTC,"I've heard many reputable CFL writers and radio guys say that it is just the league's way of dealing with horrible refs. It's easier to get a call right when all you have to do is see if the receiver was touched rather than if he was interfered with. I didn't know if it was true to begin with, but after seeing the refs already miss blatant PI's and then call some very questionable ones in only 2 weeks, I'm starting to think there's truth to those statements.   The CFL refs have always been super shit and everyone knows it. Proulx's crew is always going to call a ton of penalties on lineman (holding, hands to the face, face mask, chop blocks) while other crews emphasize different things. Bradbury's crew goes way the fuck overboard with downfield penalties that kill the flow of the game. My point is that there shouldn't be any discrepancies since they all enforce the same rules, so adding in a new set of rules won't help when the refs are too incompetent to call the game the same way.   People say they like the new rules because they like offence. I say I don't like the new rules because I like football."
CFL,3c9gdw,skippy2893,6,Mon Jul 6 06:22:06 2015 UTC,"That's really interesting and makes sense. I find it one of the most frustrating things about Canadian football is how bad the officiating is. Blatant missed calls everywhere, and then sometimes calls that just seem fabricated or tenuous at best. It really detracts from the game."
CFL,3c9gdw,FondleOtter,4,Mon Jul 6 10:17:48 2015 UTC,Toronto was offside on the opposite side of the play when they scored there convert in last nights overtime game. A bad call literally fucking lost the game.
CFL,3c9gdw,M12Domino,7,Mon Jul 6 11:36:46 2015 UTC,"Seems like it really handicaps the defence and allows the refs to wash their hands of most ""judgment"" calls when dealing with pass interference.  Though it still seems like something blatant that should be called is missed and other times ""you looked at a receiver too hard, here's a flag.""  Maybe the refs will get more consistent as everyone gets used to the rule change."
CFL,3c9gdw,omegatron20xx,2,Mon Jul 6 05:04:50 2015 UTC,"I was on the fence about it, but unless something changes I'm leaning towards hating it. All it seems to be leading to is teams sending more heat, and teams going to the high percentage plays. While I like more offence than defence, having defences get chipped apart isn't fun to watch, it's infuriating. Hopefully we don't get very many 80+ points games, because I think they seem bush league."
CFL,3c9gdw,dotCeh,1 point,Tue Jul 7 03:59:51 2015 UTC,"I think the illegal contact rule is overboard. Sure offences were down last year, but there were a whole slew of reasons for that (new team, greater demand for Canadians, o-lines not the best, etc.). I think they should have waited a year to implement anything, and even then maybe just expand on PI instead of going all out no contact.  I think what we're going to see is more blitzes. You can't defend the pass, so pressure, confuse, and kill the QB. Teams than can't defend the blitz are going to be going more towards short, quick plays, and teams that can block the blitzes are going to throw deep and walk down the field on penalties.  I haven't been able to watch any games other than the Bombers yet, but this is just my take.  On the game changing, I'm ok with it, as long as it ads to it. This used to be rugby, after all."
CFL,3c9gdw,majikmonkie,0,Mon Jul 6 20:01:32 2015 UTC,I personally like how the league has looked this year. Does no one remember how bad last year was?

CFL,3cbcjk,cheese-bubble,2,Mon Jul 6 17:47:05 2015 UTC,The new illegal contact on the receiver after 5 yards penalties have essential tied the hands of the defence. They play not to get penalized instead of actually trying to actually make a play.
CFL,3cbcjk,FondleOtter,2,Mon Jul 6 18:41:04 2015 UTC,"And if you can't defend the receiver, go after the QB. Not a great time in this league to be a QB or Offensive Lineman."
CFL,3cbcjk,majikmonkie,2,Mon Jul 6 18:43:14 2015 UTC,If it stays this way you're going to see teams not spending money on the defensive side of the ball with the exception of players who are extreme difference makers. You'll have a few DB's/ Pass rushers making huge bank and everyone else making the min.... why bother paying someone when their skills are made obsolete by the rules?   Even then the pass rushers will be handicapped by whatever knee jerk reaction the league has to this rash of QB killings.

CFL,3c9lwv,alchupanebra,3,Mon Jul 6 05:08:28 2015 UTC,"While I completely agree, if you talk with many of their most hardcore fans they don't want one, they just want the R&O to be the main team in town. It's all about Laval, not sure how the CFL would do."
CFL,3c9lwv,radi81,6,Mon Jul 6 19:22:16 2015 UTC,I'd love to see a CFL team on the east coast. As a former saskatchewanite I miss going to games. But I don't think people out here care that much for CFL unfortunately.
CFL,3c9lwv,vonrupenstein,3,Mon Jul 6 11:44:09 2015 UTC,There are no other teams in the area that they would have to compete with so that helps.
CFL,3c9lwv,bquinho,3,Mon Jul 6 16:11:54 2015 UTC,"I think there should be a major expansion to get the league to 12 teams.  A team in Halifax would be awesome if they can ever get a stadium built.  Hopefully the conversations around the waterfront property works out.  A team in Quebec City makes sense given the thirst for junior and college football in the area.  Finally, given how the city of Saskatoon is booming now, putting a second team in Saskatchewan would be great.  There is no more rabid fan base in the country so why not leverage it to promote the whole league?  And those are my two cents."
CFL,3c9lwv,nsbound,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:34:09 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure the Maritimes are a viable location. There's such a small population in each major centre, you're hoping to draw from various cities. Sure you can hold a game there a year and draw a crowd, but to do it 9 games a year, plus pre-season is asking a lot. Also, there isn't a lot of love for the CFL there."
CFL,3c9lwv,donniemills,5,Mon Jul 6 13:13:17 2015 UTC,"The counter argument: even though each individual population center is smallish, they're clustered close enough together that the drive is reasonable for 9 weekends a year, which isn't altogether different from a team in say, Regina, courting the entire province for support."
CFL,3c9lwv,jdchambo,2,Mon Jul 6 17:07:08 2015 UTC,"I know that's what the league, and Halifax or Moncton, are hoping for. But I don't think you can compare the fanatics in SK to a new team in Atlantic Canada. It'd be awesome, but could be a failure."
CFL,3c9lwv,donniemills,4,Mon Jul 6 17:20:30 2015 UTC,"Of course it could be, like any other expansion. However, it also takes time to build up a fan base as well. The comparison might not be completely apropos right this second, but with a team it's impossible to know whether such a fanatic fanbase will emerge. Especially with a lack of other pro teams nearby."
CFL,3c9lwv,jdchambo,0,Mon Jul 6 17:34:01 2015 UTC,"The fan base will be fickle. Fredericton, Moncton, St. John, Halifax, PEI, all had trouble holding on to AHL teams. I'd love to see it, but I can't see it taking hold."

What's the point of having 5 channels when 1 and 2, that people have, are both showing the same thing.  Meanwhile, 3, 4 and 5 are showing the game, but few people bother to get those channels.  Apparently, losing the NHL has made TSN make some very questionable decisions.  If I were the CFL, I'd be moderately furious.  Supposedly the CFL was supposed to keep TSN afloat, but if they're pre-empting it for something watched only by a small subset of gamblers, they're either making idiotic decisions or the racetrack people drove a boatload of money up to the network's door."

CFL,3c7lzq,pitcher_10,3,Sun Jul 5 22:34:38 2015 UTC,Doesn't everyone? The NFLs overtime sucks and this makes it so you have to go for 2 as well. No PATs in Ogretime
CFL,3c7lzq,RagingIce,3,Sun Jul 5 22:35:18 2015 UTC,"Absolutely, what frustrates me with tbe NFl's ot is that if one team scores a TD, the other team doesn't even get a chance. I get that they want to keep the game the same in ot, but it just does not work because it doesn't really give both teams a fair chance. The 2 pt conversion is also nice."

CFL,3c7ckd,mynameisrainer,5,Sun Jul 5 17:18:32 2015 UTC,"As another Herd fan chiming in here, the one thing I'll say about Cato is this: Wait until he's comfortable with the system.  One of the biggest reasons for his success in college was the fact that the offense ran on efficiency.  Few wasted plays.  That happened because he knew the system within which he was working.  Looking back on his freshman year to his junior year when he was able to open things up a bit... it's just night and day.  Once he gets a hang of the offense, we're talking about limitless opportunities Montreal.  Sutton seems like a great fit for a Cato-led offense, too."
CFL,3c7ckd,BraveSaintStuart,1 point,Sun Jul 5 19:42:14 2015 UTC,"from what i watched, it seemed like Montreal's system was similar to Marshall's, hence why he shined so well."

CFL,3c6qcf,BE20Driver,2,Sun Jul 5 14:44:38 2015 UTC,I can't see there being too many tickets at the gate. Stubhub and Ticketmaster had literally under 10 tickets left for the entire stadium 5 hours before the game.  Can season ticket holders forfeit their tickets for the game to sell?
CFL,3c6qcf,BrawndoTTM,2,Sun Jul 5 15:49:59 2015 UTC,"I have no idea, just repeating what I heard. They did say ""an extremely limited"" number of tickets at the gate, so for all I know it could just have been those 10 seats that didn't sell on Stubhub. Either way it was an impressive turnout though. No comparison to the shit we'd get with the Renegades. Back then I'd always buy cheapo seats and end up moving over to the 50 yard line before halftime because it was super empty and no one gave a shit.

Here's Dash's guide to picking a CFL team:  EAST DIVISION  Montreal Alouettes  Comparable to: New England Patriots (post-Brady)  Key Players: Rakeem Cato (Rookie QB forced to step up), Chip Cox (LB), Bear Woods (LB)  Style: Pass Heavy Offense, Solid Linebacking unit  Story: The dominant dynasty of the last 15 years, except now their legendary QB Anthony Calvillo has retired.  Uncertainty at QB position is a concern, but fields a strong defence.  Stadium: Percival Molson Memorial Stadium  Fans: The most loyal fans in the East.  Very passionate about the game and about their team.  More relaxed than Rider or Blue Bomber fans, but just as supportive.  AKA: ""Als,"" ""Larks,"" ""The French Team,"" ""Patriots North""  Toronto Argonauts  Comparable to: New York Giants (lead by Drew Brees)  Key Players: Rick Ray (injured but returning QB), Chad Ownens (WR), Brandon Whitaker (RB)  Style: Balanced* Offense, Pass Rush Defence  Story:  The oldest sporting team in North America that still exists, and one of the all time dominants of the CFL.  Always competitive - ""the team has followed the great tradition of never rebuilding, but always reloading."" (/u/CanadianGladiator)  Stadium: Rogers Centre  Fans: Weakest fan base in the CFL.  Despite being in the largest Canadian city, and the best sporting team in the city, support and turnout is relatively low.  Best known fan is former-Crack-Mayor Rob Ford.  AKA: ""Argos,"" ""Boatmen,"" ""Double Blue,"" ""Scullers""   - Balanced in the CFL is still about a 60/40 split of passing to rushing.   Ottawa Redblacks  Comparable to: Jacksonville Jaguars (lead by elderly Cam Newton)  Key Players: Henry  ""Smiling Hank"" Burris (QB), Jovon Johnson (DB), Chris Williams (WR)  Style: Balanced* Offense, Pass Coverage Defence  Story:  Brought back to life for a second time, the resilient Ottawa franchise had a rough time in their first year back.  Things seem to have improved, as the team is more cohesive and pulling off unlikely victories already.  Stadium: TD Place Stadium  Fans:  Small but growing fanbase with a few loving supporters that never gave up.  Need a winning season to really swell support for the team.  AKA: ""Rouge-et-Noir,"" ""Renegades,"" ""Rough Riders""  Hamilton Tiger-Cats  Comparable to: Pittsburgh Steelers  Key Players: Brandon Banks (RB), Zach Collaros (QB), Andy Fantuz (WR)  Style: Pass-to-set-up-the-Run Offense, Pass Coverage Defence  Story:  After more than a decade of failures to make the playoffs and being the laughing stock of the CFL, Hamilton has fielded an amazing team the last three years - stopped just short of winning the last two Grey Cups.

Also famous for their beer snakes during games  AKA: ""Bombers,"" ""Blue and Gold,"" ""Big Blue,"" ""True Blue""  Saskatchewan Roughriders  Comparable to: Green Bay Packers  Key Players: Kevin Glenn (the cursed backup QB), John Chick (DE), Paul McCallum (PK)  Style: Rush Heavy Offense, Run Stopping Defence  Story: Once the lovable losers of the CFL (at one time 2-14 in Grey Cup appearances) the Riders recent decade of success has made the Riders even more loved and more hated than ever before.  Stadium: Mosaic Stadium at Taylor Field  Fans: The most dedicated fans in the CFL, you will see Rider fans as almost every CFL game, regardless of who is playing.

Defending Grey Cup Champions. They look to dominate the league again this year, as Calgary always fields a powerful and aggressive offence.  Stadium: McMahon Stadium  Fans: Extremely loyal and supportive, although you might find the stadium packed with Rider fans when they come to town.

Never to be counted out though, the defence is a force to be reckoned with.  Stadium: Commonwealth Stadium  Fans:  Just like the Stampeders, the Eskimos have an army of dedicated fans who love their team almost as much as their NHL franchise.

The Argos are widely criticized by the league's other 8 (lesser) teams, but fans quickly learn to live with it. After all, the Argos have won the most Grey Cup championships in history (18 and counting) we have the face of the league at quarterback (though he's currently hurt and has been accused of falling off in recent years like A CERTAIN NFL QB) and the team has followed the great tradition of never rebuilding, but always reloading.   Detractors will point out that the Argos have a (relatively) small fanbase and an outdated, crumbling stadium (that they're escaping in 2016) but the fact is the Argonauts are oldest existing professional sports team in North America still using its original name, we're the team in the country's biggest city, and The Boatmen, like any good wrestling heel, feed off the boos and use the negativity to become stronger.

Not in the least that I don't wish him success but we were on the cusp of having the first Canadian QB start a game in 16 years. Ok no problem Montreal decided to go with Cato and that obviously turned out to be the right choice, but then Montreal stated that Bridge would also get some playing time. Well, when Cato plays like that there's no way Bridge gets in. In short the stars were finally aligned for a Canadian QB to shine, and Cato came from almost nowhere and shattered that from happening likely soon. But in the end it will be great for the league as well, to have a talent like Cato if he keeps it up."

CFL,3c245m,spetsnazcats,10,Sat Jul 4 01:30:37 2015 UTC,"American players are not drafted into the CFL. The CFL draft is only for Canadian players. Effectively every American player in the CFL is brought in as a free agent.  Also, because of an agreement between the two leagues, a player can have their rights held by a team in each league.

CFL,3c245m,mbekker15,10,Sat Jul 4 08:59:16 2015 UTC,"What u/OlderThanGif said but it's actually incorrect that most players are American. Each team has 44 players, 3 of which are designated as quarterbacks. Of the remaining 41 players only 20 are allowed to be imports. 21 must be Canadian. So it's actually split about even all told.  However, of the starting 24 players only 7 must be Canadian so most of the time there are more Americans on the starting squad than Canadians."
CFL,3c245m,BE20Driver,3,Sat Jul 4 02:28:27 2015 UTC,"The CFL drafts players similar to the NFL, but from Canadian universities (CIS). A big distinction that separates the drafts however is that a player that is drafted doesn't lose CIS eligibility. IIRC they only lose it should they sign with the team. Because of this, you'll often see players drafted in their 3rd or 4th year, attend rookie and spring camp with the team, play in exhibition games, the be sent back to their university for their final year. Some players if given the option will stick with their club, but usually play out their university eligibility."
CFL,3c245m,dotCeh,3,Sat Jul 4 03:33:25 2015 UTC,You can also select Canadians who are attending NCAA/NAIA schools in the CFL Draft too.

CFL,3c245m,dotCeh,3,Sat Jul 4 12:10:11 2015 UTC,"I don't consider CFL as a dumping ground, because there are plenty of NFL hopefuls who aren't even good enough for CFL either. However, think more about how many people are in the running for NFL. The reason we end up with a lot of Americans is because making it into the NFL can easily be about numbers sometimes. If there are plenty of people in the same position, with similar stats, sometimes they don't all get drafted because only so many teams were interested in that position right now. So then they try their luck with availabilities in the CFL. Football isn't as popular here as in the states, and some of these kids have prepared their whole life to play pro, so they may be more skilled than Canadians in the same position. That's not to say that Canadian universities don't produce talent, they absolutely do, but there are far fewer planning on making this a career."

CFL,3c1u83,mcorcoran3,15,Fri Jul 3 23:55:47 2015 UTC,"The team most similar to the Patriots is the Montreal Alouettes, except that they are in their post-Brady phase.  Even have similar colours.  They were a powerhouse dynasty of the past 15 that dominated the East and won a plethora of Grey Cups under Anthony Calvillo, probably the best CFL QB of all time.  Except he's retired now (actually now the WR coach for the Als), so the team is relying on their respectable defence to carry their young (Canadian) backup QB to victory.  They have the most passionate fan base in the East, and pulled of an upset tonight against the heavily favoured Stampeders.  Quick blurbs on the other teams:  Toronto is a regular competitor, and has the Canadian equivalent of Drew Brees at QB, although the team could be compared to the Giants.  Incredibly small fanbase for how large the city is, and how well the team usually performs.  Ottawa is lead by Henry ""Smiling Hank"" Burris (sort of like a very old Cam Newton), an expansion team brought back to life several times.  Last year was their first year back, and, well, they were terrible.  This year is looking better already though, but they're still longshots.  Hamilton has one of the best teams in the east, and rely heavily on CFL superstar RB Brandon Banks amazing running game and kick returns.  They were a terrible team for most of the last decade, but have been unreal the last 3 years.  Winnipeg has become a Cleveland Browns-esque sadness factory.  They spent most of last year losing games in heartbreak and suffered losing most of their best talent to injuries and the NFL.  Die hard fans.  They looked good in week one, though.  Saskatchewan used to be lovable losers, but sort of got a bunch of Seahawks-esque bandwagon jumpers after finally having a few really good seasons.  You will see Riders fans at almost every CFL game, regardless of who is playing.  Also, one of the teams firmly committed to trying to establish a running game in a league with only 3 downs.  Calgary is the elite team this year.  They have a solid QB in Bo Levi Mitchen, and Cornish is possibly the best RB in the CFL.  They've almost always been an offensive focused team.  Edmonton looks to rely on their defence again this year.  They QB hasn't quite proven himself and the offensive gears just haven't seemed to click the past few years.  The defence has been reliable for the most part.  BC Lions are a lot like the 49ers in how they approach the game - a pass heavy west coast offence.  Lulay is like Sam Bradford a bit - good when he's healthy but probably not healthy.  Rely on receiver talent.  The weakest fan base in the west, but still much higher than some of the East teams."

CFL,3c1u83,curiousquare,5,Sat Jul 4 01:22:52 2015 UTC,"The vast majority of the time, if you are born in Saskatchewan or have parents/family from Saskatchewan, you become a Rider fan. It's very entrenched in our genes it seems...even if someone has left the province for a few years or a few generations they always take their Rider Pride with them.   Yes there may be bandwagon jumpers but every team in every league in the world is going to have them if that particular team is successful.   What one person said here is correct, the Riders for decades were the ""lovable losers, free space on the bingo card"" kind of team that other teams and their fans looked at with pity. With only 4 Grey Cup Championships in the 100+ year history of the team, when my Riders win the big game, it's really indescribable how proud and overjoyed you get. I can still remember watching the Grey cup in 1989 when Dave Ridgway kicked the game winning field goal to win for the first time since 1966 and I cried and cried with happiness and not just because I was a 15 year old girl at the time...as a Rider fan, you just always thought it was never going to happen. The 2013 Grey Cup win at home was something I will probably never experience again...not like that. It was one of the best times of my life and sharing that time of extreme joy with Ridernation is a feeling I will never forget.   The sense of pride, tradition, history, and yes, despair associated with the team is so deeply rooted in our community that it is part of our identity and our culture. Ultimately, football is just a game but in Saskatchewan, it's something just a little bit more. We just fiercely love this team and love being Rider fans. Ridernation is worldwide!"

The Argos are widely criticized by the league's other 8 (lesser) teams, but fans quickly learn to live with it. After all, the Argos have won the most Grey Cup championships in history (18 and counting) we have the face of the league at quarterback (though he's currently hurt and has been accused of falling off in recent years like A CERTAIN NFL QB) and the team has followed the great tradition of never rebuilding, but always reloading.   Detractors will point out that the Argos have a (relatively) small fanbase and an outdated, crumbling stadium (that they're escaping in 2016) but the fact is the Argonauts are oldest existing professional sports team in North America still using its original name, we're the team in the country's biggest city, and The Boatmen, like any good wrestling heel, feed off the boos and use the negativity to become stronger.  I hope you choose to jump aboard the Argos boat! If you do, I'll gladly be your guide!"

CFL,3c1k2c,TheWyldMan,3,Sat Jul 4 02:20:59 2015 UTC,"Cato is better then Crompton, and the Stamps depth is no longer as deep as it was last year with the departures. and injuries."

CFL,3c1k2c,OdetoPoutine,2,Fri Jul 3 23:20:32 2015 UTC,The Rod Black prophecy will be fulfilled when all the starting QB's are out.

CFL,3c1k2c,signious,3,Sat Jul 4 00:02:24 2015 UTC,"So this is my first time watching a live game. Anything that's a huge difference from the NFL, outside of field dimension differences?"
CFL,3c1k2c,albinorhino21,3,Sat Jul 4 00:04:11 2015 UTC,"All the motion before the snap and the extra man on the field, for one! Also, only three downs."
CFL,3c1k2c,OlderThanGif,2,Sat Jul 4 00:06:46 2015 UTC,Also single point on a field goal or punt that isn't brought out of the end zone.
CFL,3c1k2c,TheWyldMan,2,Sat Jul 4 00:07:54 2015 UTC,Is the extra man considered an eligible receiver or a lineman?
CFL,3c1k2c,Biggymacsauce,2,Sat Jul 4 00:11:12 2015 UTC,"From what I understand (I'm fairly new to following CFL as well), he's usually a fullback or something along those lines."
CFL,3c1k2c,Sunjag,2,Sat Jul 4 00:12:44 2015 UTC,It depends on the formation. Almost always he's lined up as eligible.
CFL,3c1k2c,FondleOtter,3,Sat Jul 4 00:13:12 2015 UTC,"-3 Downs  -5 middle lineman are not allowed to leave line of scrimmage until ball is punted on a punt  -No no-yards rule (you must give a 5 yd cushion between anyone on the cover team & the player who returns the punt at the time when he catches / picks up the ball)  -2 pt conversion after TD takes place at the 3 yd line, 1pt conversion kick is at the 25yd line  -defense has to be at least 1 yd away from line of scrimmage at the time of snap  -12 players on the field per team  -up to 3 points may be awarded at the end of the game to any team who displayed good sportsmanship and a courteous on-the-field attitude (k, that one is a joke)"

CFL,3c1k2c,coelurosauravus,1 point,Sat Jul 4 00:37:04 2015 UTC,He's been fat for a few years. Man can throw a mean block when he isn't making a catch.

CFL,3c1k2c,Sunjag,3,Sat Jul 4 00:43:00 2015 UTC,Stop challenging our nice plays!!
CFL,3c1k2c,calgary3200,3,Sat Jul 4 00:43:30 2015 UTC,Cato's looking pretty good and I'm glad even though he beat Tech ion the Championship game
CFL,3c1k2c,shichibukai3000,3,Sat Jul 4 00:44:00 2015 UTC,Sorry but I think that's a good catch. He was pushed.
CFL,3c1k2c,ponimaju,3,Sat Jul 4 00:45:02 2015 UTC,How is that catch a thing?
CFL,3c1k2c,HomerSPC,3,Sat Jul 4 00:45:10 2015 UTC,"just tuned in, nice to see Cato playing somewhere.  hell of a catch."
CFL,3c1k2c,matrb,3,Sat Jul 4 00:47:22 2015 UTC,that was questionable at best by bridge

CFL,3c1k2c,Vickdumm,3,Fri Jul 3 23:13:13 2015 UTC,Sucks man.
CFL,3c1k2c,shichibukai3000,2,Sat Jul 4 02:26:59 2015 UTC,Let's hope that we win by more than just the skin of our teeth this time. Go Stamps Go!
CFL,3c1k2c,OlderThanGif,2,Fri Jul 3 22:51:25 2015 UTC,This should be a great game if Brandon Bridge is as good as people say. I hope the game is 1/2 as good as last week.
CFL,3c1k2c,HomerSPC,2,Fri Jul 3 23:20:50 2015 UTC,Cato's looking quite impressive. I guess those Marshall numbers don't lie.
CFL,3c1k2c,MagnustheBlue,2,Fri Jul 3 23:52:34 2015 UTC,Right on! Go Cato!!
CFL,3c1k2c,RaptorsFromSpace,2,Fri Jul 3 23:53:34 2015 UTC,So.... Cato is perfect... is it too late to change my Pick Em yet?

CFL,3c1k2c,Vickdumm,2,Sat Jul 4 00:43:33 2015 UTC,Lewis looked very...stable...on that play.

CFL,3c1k2c,coelurosauravus,2,Sat Jul 4 00:48:37 2015 UTC,Me and my CFL Pick Em hope so
CFL,3c1k2c,CaptainHadley,2,Sat Jul 4 00:49:51 2015 UTC,Nik Lewis didn't want to retire and he's biting his former team in the butt...  Paul and the Riders have a home'n'home with the Lions this month that I'm sure everyone is looking forward to now
CFL,3c1k2c,bquinho,2,Sat Jul 4 00:49:56 2015 UTC,We can come back still. We've come back from much worse. We've just got to get our shit together.
CFL,3c1k2c,ttsci,4,Sat Jul 4 00:50:23 2015 UTC,"I can't remember the exact number, but it's something like 10% of Division I players would have the talent to make the roster of a CFL team. Obviously even the worst CFL team would destroy a Division I team, but a lot of Division I players do have a shot at making the roster of a team. They just bumped up the minimum salary, so average salary is probably about $100k? Very very few players will crack $500k. Nobody's buying gold-plated Ferraris in the CFL, and a number of players do take off-season jobs, but they can get by playing football. Overlap between NFL and CFL players is maybe less common than you're thinking. There aren't a lot of washed up NFL players that join the CFL and there aren't a lot of CFL stars that jump ship to the NFL. By and large, players stay in their leagues. Among players who do jump between leagues, I'm actually not sure which is more common (if the CFL comes first or last). It feels like a mixture to me."
CFL,3c1k2c,shichibukai3000,5,Sat Jul 4 00:50:46 2015 UTC,"Talent wise, they're very close (with the exception of the Canadian content rule).  Mainly for two reasons:  1) The CFL tends to pick up undersized players who are amazing athletes, the NFL tends to pick up all the oversized players who are amazing athletes.   So you aren't going to find many 6.7 315 offensive (or defensive) tackles that can play pro football at a high level in the CFL, but you will find a bunch of 5.8 receivers who can get 1000+ yards in a year.  2) The remaining players tend not to be less talented, but less consistent.  An NFL player will make 'that' catch/play/tackle/read/etc 9.5/10 times.   The CFL player will only make it 8/10.    So for most of the game if you were watching an NFL player and a CFL player, they'd look pretty identical.  The difference is when the game is on the line, that NFL player will make the catch and the CFL player might drop it.   You get that one extra 'oops' in the CFL, where as in the NFL you'd be cut and run out of town.  The biggest difference that stops the CFL from being a fully talented system is the Canadian content rule.   Each team probably has 3 or 4 players who are fully qualified and would make the team on their talent alone.  The problem is that each team is required to start 7 Canadians, which means you have a handful of marginal players who would be closer to Div 1 players than NFL players.  Also quality of depth players tends to drop off quickly because the CFL has much smaller rosters and thus less players in the pipeline when someone gets injured.  TL;DR: What does this all mean for the product on the field?   You get quasi NFL level play most of the time, with random bits of ""How the hell was a guy that wide open!?!"", and the occasional ""Why would you have 13 men on the field for the last play of the Grey Cup??!!"""
CFL,3c1k2c,Sunjag,2,Sat Jul 4 00:56:25 2015 UTC,"I don't agree about the Canadian part.  10-15 years ago maybe,  but now,  at least for the seven starters,  the Canadian are on part or better than their American counterpart.  Depth is often the issue.  Cis is soo much better than it was."
CFL,3c1k2c,ttsci,2,Sat Jul 4 01:45:28 2015 UTC,"Two years ago I would have agreed with you, but the redblacks put a pretty noticeable dent in most teams that will take a few years to regrow.  I guess being a rider fan I just notice it more, where we had 9ish Canadian starters in 2013 which were all being clearly the best in position (and in a number of cases, the league), and now we're struggling.  CIS development is quite a bit better now.  The your questionable Canadian players are often ""you wouldn't be starting every single game"" instead of the old ""you wouldn't even be on the team""."
CFL,3c1k2c,OlderThanGif,3,Sat Jul 4 06:12:03 2015 UTC,"A ton of CFL players are Div 1 players who just couldn't cut it into the NFL. Keep in mind that by rule a certain number of Canadian players must be on the field/team.    How do salaries compare?   Not very much, the average salary is 100k. The total salary cap in the CFL is around 5mil   Is the CFL a before league or more of an after?   Mostly div 1 nfl rejects.   Is it normal for guys who couldn't get into an NFL camp to start in the CFL until they (hopefully) mature a little more and then go and make an NFL team?    Some do, some don't. Its said often that your average NFL and CFL player isn't that different however there's no ""superstars"" in the CFL.   Currently you make A LOT more money being a practice player in the NFL then you do being a starter in the CFL. Once that changes i think we'l see a lot more participation in the CFL."
CFL,3c1k2c,coelurosauravus,3,Sat Jul 4 07:15:20 2015 UTC,"talent wise, how does this compare to DI football?   Better. It ain't the NFL but it's pro football. Players sometimes move NFL to CFL and visa versa.   Is the CFL a before league or more of an after?   It's more of an instead league. We lose our best to the NFL and we get some NFL cuts, but a whole lot of players play their whole careers here or never actually get an NFL start despite moving south for a season or two. It takes more to adapt to the Canadian game than you might think."
CFL,3c1k2c,shichibukai3000,2,Sat Jul 4 00:58:28 2015 UTC,"i feel like most of this could be answered by the sticky at the top of the sub.  to answer some though.  talent depends, a lot of top tier US college guys play in this league.  Many guys made NFL rosters, but theyre sized funny (brandon banks of hamilton) or their skill set doesnt align with the NFL.  CFL shape is hugely different from NFL shape.  Salaries are much lower, as TV deals arent as sweet, and ticket prices drive the league more.  again see the top post for a better explanation.  Its really an all encompassing league.  Jon Cornish of the stamps in years passed and probably even now surely could have make an NFL roster, but i think love of the game is why he stays in the CFL.  lots of NFL wash ups in their old age come in, and most dont adapt well.    Guys like Cato can take advantage of the opportunity to keep advancing his skills and maybe get picked up by the NFL.  Cato has a good CFL skill set though, mobility, decent touch, and hes not big, which is not a bad thing in the CFL, think Doug Flutie."
CFL,3c1k2c,goboatmen,2,Sat Jul 4 00:58:52 2015 UTC,Gap between CFL and College is much larger than NFL and CFL.
CFL,3c1k2c,CaptainHadley,2,Sat Jul 4 01:01:00 2015 UTC,League minimum is 50k. We signed our starting quarterback Drew Willy to a 3 year $450k contract i believe. That was after one year as a starter.
CFL,3c1k2c,Sunjag,2,Sat Jul 4 01:06:08 2015 UTC,It does seem like Calgary has managed to stop the bleeding and might be starting to make a few plays. Maybe they're just a slow-starting team this year.

CFL,3c0ekt,drpgq,0,Fri Jul 3 17:41:33 2015 UTC,Better be a suspension regardless...
CFL,3c0ekt,sneezypenguin,5,Fri Jul 3 19:24:21 2015 UTC,"Absolutely not.  If he was standing up it would have been a textbook tackle.  It was unfortunate the way he got twisted around which resulted in a helmet to helmet hit but that was in no way a malicious hit.  This isn't two hand touch, you've gotta get the QB down or else you get a Manning to Tyree type play.  I feel bad for Willy and hope it's nothing serious, but that was  football play and shit happens.  Lots of other suspension worthy hits out there, this was not one of them."
CFL,3c0ekt,Mannbearpiggg,1 point,Fri Jul 3 21:45:49 2015 UTC,it wasnt a textbook tackle. Willy was already be taken down by another player when another Ticat decided to take a cheap shot on Willy almost taking his helmet off
CFL,3c0ekt,werbo,6,Fri Jul 3 21:58:25 2015 UTC,Gang tackling happens all the time. This was not a cheap shot. It was a player helping a teammate make a tackle.
CFL,3c0ekt,biga204,2,Fri Jul 3 22:23:59 2015 UTC,"hitting underneath the chin, and launching yourself at a player going down is a cheap shot. Also gang tackling usually involves a proper tackling form, not launching yourself at a quarterback"
CFL,3c0ekt,werbo,4,Fri Jul 3 23:19:29 2015 UTC,It's a cheap shot if it was intentional.  Taylor is going in to assist with a tackle.   The player that is tackling has Willy wrapped up and spins him.  As Taylor goes in - at what would normally be chest level - Willy bends lowering his head.  Taylor is already committed to a tackle in the numbers bit now instead of Willy's numbers hits his head.  Penalty? Absolutely. Cheap shot? Absolutely not. The game moves so fast there would be no way for him to stop once he committed to the tackle.
CFL,3c0ekt,biga204,1 point,Fri Jul 3 23:26:21 2015 UTC,"If he was down the whistle would have blown.  QB's have been known to get out of tackles and make big plays.  The hit itself was pretty much a form tackle.  Pretty much the first rule drilled into your head by coaches when playing any sport is you play till the whistle.  Freak accident, no ones fault."
CFL,3c0ekt,Mannbearpiggg,3,Fri Jul 3 22:27:59 2015 UTC,"it was not a freak accident, what happened to durant was a freak accident. Tearing a ligament without contact is a freak accident, taking a shot to the head of a quarterback going down is not a freak accident. The player in question should have been penalized for the shot as he could have avoided hitting Willy, its not like he just fell on him, he intentionally launched himself at Willy"
CFL,3c0ekt,werbo,1 point,Fri Jul 3 23:21:56 2015 UTC,"Every single tackle the defender intentionally launches themselves at the player with the ball.  Willy wasn't down.  His head wasn't where it was when the defender first went to make the tackle.  How do you propose the defender should have responded given the play was still live (no whistle), Willy's knee wasn't on the ground or guaranteed to hit the ground, and he's not supposed to make a tackle?  This tackle football, injuries happen on clean plays, it's a fact of life.  Let's not turn football into Sarcastaball."
CFL,3c0ekt,Mannbearpiggg,6,Fri Jul 3 23:32:32 2015 UTC,I disagree. It wasn't intended to be a malicious hit. When Durant was taken out last season when the refs blew the play dead there wasn't a suspension-- because there wasn't malicious intent. Just unfortunate circumstances.
CFL,3c0ekt,incredibleewok,2,Fri Jul 3 19:25:45 2015 UTC,"Everyone is entitled to their own opinions and I'll admit I don't know the CFL's rules as much as I know the NFL's rules. But in my opinion, intent doesn't really matter. He hit Willy in the head (which should be a no-on) with the crown of the helmet (which should also be a no-no)."
CFL,3c0ekt,sneezypenguin,7,Fri Jul 3 19:35:14 2015 UTC,Intent doesn't matter to the refs. They should have thrown a flag. But this was an accidental football play and intent does matter when it comes to suspensions.
CFL,3c0ekt,biga204,2,Fri Jul 3 22:22:55 2015 UTC,I hope he sits out next week. Last thing we need is him coming back too early. That was a nasty hit.
CFL,3c0ekt,bquinho,1 point,Fri Jul 3 20:03:06 2015 UTC,Am I the only one that thought I saw him hit two helmets? The obvious first helmet hit the seemed to sandwich his head against the first tackler.
CFL,3c0ekt,babooyagoo,1 point,Sat Jul 4 09:39:58 2015 UTC,"I am not sure the official CFL rules, but as he was wrapped up and then hit in the helmet, he should be ruled a defenceless player who was hit in the head. A UR penalty should have resulted but I didn't think one happened, unless the CFL doesn't follow this rule anymore?"
CFL,3c0ekt,pronking1983,2,Fri Jul 3 20:34:28 2015 UTC,"By your logic any time someone is engaged in a tackle the second man in should not touch the offensive player.  That's not how football works.    A defenseless player is a receiver running across the middle who gets popped in the head before he can change his course, or if someone who is already down.  There is a chance Willy could have pulled a Manning and spun out of that sack and made a play still so he's gotta go down.  It sucks your QB went down, but there was nothing dirty about the hit.  Defender went low (i.e away from the head) and unfortunately Willy got swung around and his head got hit."

CFL,3bzk96,Ricekrisper,13,Fri Jul 3 12:39:24 2015 UTC,Who knew 7-yard passes that are consistently 3 strides behind the receivers wouldn't result in a comeback?
CFL,3bzk96,RedDorf,3,Fri Jul 3 16:45:50 2015 UTC,Brohm's noodle arm is so damn hard to watch. He can't hit anyone in stride.
CFL,3bzk96,bquinho,2,Fri Jul 3 20:00:18 2015 UTC,I remember he played well against Calgary before he went down last year.
CFL,3bzk96,RaptorsFromSpace,9,Fri Jul 3 20:05:02 2015 UTC,"Sigh.  It's sad that I've pretty much become accustomed to this by now.  QB injured and lose by 30?  What is this, 2013?"
CFL,3bzk96,halpinator,8,Fri Jul 3 17:20:51 2015 UTC,I've been alive since March 1990. The Bombers have done this literally every year I can remember outside of Kahari Jones.
CFL,3bzk96,RhynoSorceress,7,Fri Jul 3 18:02:34 2015 UTC,If the Bombers ever get good I hope they remember all the times other teams ran up the score on us and return the favor.
CFL,3bzk96,Stach37,7,Fri Jul 3 16:19:29 2015 UTC,I look at the Bombers being bad like a US president going up for re-elections.  4 MORE YEARS! 4 MORE YEARS!
CFL,3bzk96,laxvolley,1 point,Fri Jul 3 16:54:36 2015 UTC,maybe it's payback for the Dunigan partial (when he wasn't hurt) years?  Bombers put up a lot of points in one sided games then...
CFL,3bzk96,CosmicGuitars,2,Sat Jul 4 03:02:05 2015 UTC,But it was a good game!
CFL,3bzk96,drpgq,3,Fri Jul 3 13:46:06 2015 UTC,Looking forward to having Tasker back. Although I'm not sure who you take out for him.

CFL,3bzk96,-Rattata-,2,Fri Jul 3 15:39:32 2015 UTC,Not really. Lopsided games are never good. If the score was reversed I'd be happy but I'd still say it was a shitty game.
CFL,3bzk96,HomerSPC,5,Fri Jul 3 17:47:37 2015 UTC,"I know, I got bored after the first half tbh  I'll always take a win, but I'm hoping tonights game is better"

CFL,3bxe4p,laxvolley,6,Fri Jul 3 01:15:22 2015 UTC,Definitely a concussion.
CFL,3bxe4p,RaptorsFromSpace,3,Fri Jul 3 01:28:22 2015 UTC,Yea they showed it a couple times. Helmet to helmet as he was going down. Looked like it was unavoidable for the DL.

CFL,3bxe4p,werbo,5,Fri Jul 3 02:13:57 2015 UTC,"There are many problems involved with that including but not limited to:   Disparity between the Canadian and American dollars Not wanting to try and compete in NFL markets Try to compete for airtime in the US, CFL only gets limited coverage in the US Popularity in the US, is definitely a lot smaller than it is here Travel costs would a lot more when going to the US for games The Grey Cup has never had a prolonged residence in the US and hopefully never will(Baltimore folded after they won the Grey Cup, because of the Browns moving to Baltimore and becoming the Ravens for the 1996 season).   That said I would actually love the CFL to expand into the states if it would be viable to do it"

The main reason is the difference in the field size, if you watch Banks' return touchdowns, almost all of them are punt returns that he manages to get the edge on. In the NFL, with the much narrower field I don't think he would be able to get the edge as often, not to mention how many punts would end up fair catches."
CFL,3bxe4p,luck75,3,Fri Jul 3 01:36:44 2015 UTC,I don't know enough to comment on his talent but it seems to me like there's another reason why he didn't make the transition for the amount he could make in the NFL.

I get that they might not want a ton of contact after a few yards.   But in the CFL, with such a big field, the offense has a huge advantage. Less of a challenge to find space and get open. You're gonna get teams sticking to a zone d and receivers finding a soft space and picking up 10 yards.  I just don't get why a change had to me made. Nothing was broken."

But we get all this info on Bridge and his development and his strengths/weaknesses but not one bit about Cato except that he's the other guy.

The kid is great, he broke all the records of our previous QBs that went on to play in the NFL - in fact, I wouldn't be surprised if he is looking at the CFL as a stepping stone to get into the NFL at some point.  Montreal should definitely give him a chance, IMO. I don't know enough about their system to say for sure if he is a good match for them, but from what I saw last night I think if they give him a bit more time under center they won't be disappointed."

CFL,3bvqye,Turd_Hurdler,1 point,Sat Jul 4 07:10:14 2015 UTC,"That's true, but I think someone of a certain talent level can excel at either game just like, say, an NHL superstar will probably be pretty good in the Russian KHL even though the games are different as well.  Not saying Cato is a superstar by any means, but I think he's highly underrated and it's quite ridiculous that he was passed up on in the NFL draft. Just the symptom of playing for a small school unfortunately - even though his team was one play away from going undefeated last year. (which was the fault of the defense and not him)"
CFL,3bvqye,-H-E-L-I-X-,1 point,Sat Jul 4 10:52:03 2015 UTC,"Ricky Williams was supposed to run all over the CFL... Not so much.  I liked his play as a blocker, which to me showed he knew what he was doing out there, but he did nothing with the ball in his hand.    Heissman runner-up, the year Ricky won, Michael Bishop.  Star collegiate quarterback, just never had it up here.  Always showed enough potential to keep around, but just couldn't make it happen mentally in his numerous oppurtunities as a starter.  Flipside is a guy like Doug Flutie, who lit up the CFL and was mediocre at best in the NFL.    All of that aside, the CFL is built on players who for some ridiculous reason, don't fit the mold of what the NFL is looking for at the time.  Smaller, faster players at all positions have found a home here and have been stars on our larger field.  Hopefully this Cato kid has it... Looks like CFL needs as many quarterbacks as we can find this year!"
CFL,3bvqye,Turd_Hurdler,1 point,Sat Jul 4 17:59:44 2015 UTC,"Well, you were right. Cato had a dream debut. Montreal is basically anointing him their starter now after 1 game."

If what the author says is true and Cato's release time is a second faster than Bridge's then that is a huge advantage for him starting. However Bridge might not be as polished but he has a cannon for an arm which is something you just can't train in a guy."

He took second-string snaps and played the second quarter against the Winnipeg Jets and completed 8 of 12 passes.   Not bad, but you'd have to think his results would be a little worse if he hadn't been playing a hockey team."
CFL,3bufcd,Libertatem,11,Thu Jul 2 06:14:39 2015 UTC,"Great article.  Although calling it a version of American football is almost hilariously inaccurate, given that it's not a spinoff of that. It's a little weird that the article actually explains this but still uses the term. Use of ""Cousin of Ameican football"", or ""version of Gridiron football"" would have been better. The BBC could have used a factbox to explain the term ""gridiron football"" to avoid confusion."
CFL,3bufcd,1dererLives,3,Thu Jul 2 14:25:42 2015 UTC,"While I agree, at the same time I concede that NFL football is simply a bigger blip on the British radar. So it's a good way to explain to a brit that this isn't like Aussie Rules Football.   Also, when you say factbox about gridiron, it reminds me of a hilarious story. A buddy of mine had a Japanese PS2, and decided to buy Madden 2001 for it. The Japanese version, naturally. It came with a 30+ booklet explaining the rules and strategy behind American football, which makes me wonder who in the hell would buy the game if they didn't understand the rules, haha..."
CFL,3bufcd,antonio106,1 point,Thu Jul 2 22:01:11 2015 UTC,"Haha, It's pretty odd thinking that exporting an NFL game to Japan would have good results. Anglo-European nations have had a lot of luck essentially ""colonizing the world"" to their sporting traditions, but it's usually through the Olympics and other international competitions, not video-games!  (Although video games have probably helped soccer quite a bit in North America).

That defeats the whole purpose of equal rights. He's getting special attention for something that nobody should care about."
CFL,3bvqr8,Nexcapto,5,Thu Jul 2 18:06:15 2015 UTC,"I completely agree. That said, my biggest issue with this whole debacle is that he came out before he actually proved himself as a football player. The fact that he then failed to prove himself just makes the whole thing look like a mess. If he ends up succeeding in the CFL, great, move on the NFL, but if not, then he doesn't have a snowball's chance in hell at a professional football career.  Also, if Michael Sam doesn't make it, it propagates negative stereotypes that nobody wants to see. So I'm praying he makes it. I'm just not very optimistic."

Touchdown Atlantic has shown that the region has some interest, but they don't have the population numbers to support a fanbase on the size of the remaining 9 teams.  It's not a pleasant thought because we all want 10 Canadian teams and Moncton is the obvious choice, but I think it's reality that, unless Moncton unexpectedly discovers a huge oil field nearby or something and sparks a population boom, it's not going to change. We have a choice between having only 9 Canadian teams, or having a 10th team which is markedly worse than even Toronto.  Personally I think an American city makes more sense for expansion because, with good management, they'll have no problems putting bums in seats, but I doubt that will happen when everybody can still remember the clusterfuck that was Larry Smith's attempt at a US expansion."
CFL,3br9jl,BE20Driver,6,Wed Jul 1 20:36:02 2015 UTC,"I disagree.  Moncton is not the obvious choice. Halifax is. While Moncton is a more central location, and there for can draw from all the maritime provinces, Halifax has the largest single population base as well as a government who is actively trying to build a stadium."
CFL,3br9jl,jdchambo,1 point,Wed Jul 1 21:06:08 2015 UTC,"I like the idea of basing them in Moncton but marketing them as the Atlantic Whatevers. Instead of drawing upon a single city or province, draw upon a whole area. Similar to how the New England Patriots operate."
CFL,3br9jl,1dererLives,2,Wed Jul 1 23:44:05 2015 UTC,"I think that's the general intent, whether they're based in Moncton or Halifax. I think Moncton would be better for the long term success because it's more centrally located, but on the other hand with only 9 home dates a year, it's easier to make the drive down from longer distances."
CFL,3br9jl,cat-n-jazz,1 point,Thu Jul 2 04:01:53 2015 UTC,"I'm definitely biased because I live in Halifax and would love to see a team here... but I don't see the ""centrally located"" argument as that worthwhile. Quebecers are not going to become loyal to a Moncton team, which means that the region is essentially just ""Moncton"" on one end and ""Halifax"" on the other.   Halifax is both bigger and gets more tourists, and so is more central in ""economic centre of gravity"" terms. I think we're the best option, but Moncton is very good at hosting events, and would still do fine if they get the chance.  Edit: Got Saint John confused with Moncton re: Geography. The central location argument makes a bit more sense now."
CFL,3br9jl,Nexcapto,1 point,Thu Jul 2 14:49:34 2015 UTC,"It's worth noting that the rebranding of the Boston Patriots as the New England Patriots in 1971 was NOT an effort to market the team to the whole of New England, but rather because they had moved their stadium to Foxborough, 35+ km away from downtown Boston. The Washington Stealth of the National Lacrosse League did the same thing, they were playing in Everett, not Seattle (distance, 40ish km) so they named themselves after the state."
CFL,3br9jl,heil_das_grammar,1 point,Thu Jul 2 07:41:04 2015 UTC,"There is now also a problem where the Nationals VS Internations rule would need to be gone. American Sports apparently don't support this segregation based on nationality anymore. Can't find the link to the article on the subject but it would now require a rule rework to get an american team in the league.   Also, it would cross that line the NFL & CFL kind of have.. and then NFL would pick up a team in Toronto."
CFL,3br9jl,jdchambo,3,Thu Jul 2 18:14:05 2015 UTC,I feel like Portland would be a good option. It's fairly close to Canada and has a large population. Not to mention all those hipsters would love having a CFL team instead of an NFL team.
CFL,3br9jl,cat-n-jazz,2,Thu Jul 2 03:48:58 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure I agree. While not the case for all Americans, the general sense I get is that a lot of people down here look down upon the CFL because it's seen as inferior, so I think there would be a harder time gaining traction amongst the fan base as a result."
CFL,3br9jl,coelurosauravus,2,Thu Jul 2 04:03:27 2015 UTC,"I'm asking this more to hear the reasons why not rather than because I'm truly behind the idea, but what's wrong with Quebec City?  And why is Moncton being seen as a better option than Halifax (which again, I'm asking to hear the answers, not because I think differently)?"

My concern is Ottawa.  Their following seems remarkable at the moment, however, theyve had 3 teams in the last 20 years.  Respectably the rough riders lasted a very long time there, but the renegades didnt.  Obviously this isnt a case of an expansion in the next 2 seasons, but you want to be sure that Ottawa is going to firmly hold on to the REDBLACKS before looking further towards expansion.  Financial stability in the league is there, i just want to be happy seeing Ottawa know theyre going to be there and stable for a very long time."

CFL,3bkwqy,GX6ACE,2,Tue Jun 30 04:36:16 2015 UTC,I honestly think at this point there's a good chance we see Kory Sheets at Mosaic again before Durant. Quarterback is such a tough position to play in the first place. Being taken out for so long can't bode well for him. I hope I'm wrong.   Although I hope I'm right about Sheets
CFL,3bkwqy,FondleOtter,3,Tue Jun 30 06:17:27 2015 UTC,"I was shooting tweets back and forth with Kory today.  He is still injured and the soonest he'll be good to go will be next year.  When I asked if we would see him in green and white in 2016 he said ""thats the plan"""

CFL,3bkwqy,GX6ACE,1 point,Tue Jun 30 07:06:16 2015 UTC,"Although I hope I'm right about Sheets   I'm indifferent to him coming back. He seems like a great guy, but we already have a good setup with Messam and Allen. Kory will also be 31 before he steps onto the field again. Not a good age to make a comeback as a RB. In the end it has to be about what's best for the team and, unfortunately, Kory likely won't be it."
CFL,3bkwqy,BE20Driver,1 point,Tue Jun 30 19:37:02 2015 UTC,I'd like to see him thrown in with Allen and Messam. The 3 would be an incredible backfield together.... if the Riders can afford it
CFL,3bkwqy,FondleOtter,1 point,Tue Jun 30 20:04:36 2015 UTC,I guess the question is whether Sheets would accept a position  as just 1 of 3 backs. Messam isn't on the same level as Sheets but he's good enough and he has the huge advantage of helping the ratio. Do we cut him to make room for a guy that might not be as explosive as he once was? Maybe you're right but I just think Sheets is not worth the tradeoff.
CFL,3bkwqy,BE20Driver,1 point,Tue Jun 30 20:54:46 2015 UTC,"I think if it comes to Messam vs Sheets I find it so tough to ignore the ratio issue, I would stick with Messam.   Also wouldn't get rid of Allen for Sheets, he is a solid player without a history of injury, and contributed to the community in a meaningful way in his first off season.   Sheets would really have to be willing to work as part of a running back corps as far as I see it. Would probably have to take a little bit of a pay cut from where he would have been if he signed again after 2013 too."

Just a flukey injury to come down on that foot like that."
CFL,3bi6tn,Vorocano,4,Mon Jun 29 15:03:54 2015 UTC,I could see on the replays that it wasn't due to being stepped on.  The commentators of the game didn't seem to catch that but somehow I did.  I was fearing an Achilles tendon injury right away - what else would it be that could go that way? - but I sure wish I'd been wrong.  TL;DR Feel smart but am sad
CFL,3bi6tn,PhotoJim99,2,Mon Jun 29 16:51:37 2015 UTC,"That could happen to anyone. Plant your foot wrong walking downtown and bam. Snapped achilles.   I mean, his might've been weakened already because he's an athlete, but still."
CFL,3bi6tn,falsekoala,3,Mon Jun 29 16:36:51 2015 UTC,"I wonder if it was weakened because of him not playing much since last September.  The Achilles tendon tends to weaken with lack of use.  Durant is only 32, but the thought comes to mind.  In any event, I think he'll be back and he'll be fine.  In theory he could return this year based on what I've read online but it would be safer if they didn't push the issue; the long-term success of the corrective surgery is higher if the tendon is given more time to heal itself."
CFL,3bi6tn,PhotoJim99,3,Mon Jun 29 16:53:20 2015 UTC,I'm thinking his career is over after that. 2 lost seasons for a player that relies on mobility like he does isn't promising for a full return IMO. He'll come back and maybe he'll start again but he'll never be the player he was a few years ago. Too bad.
CFL,3bi6tn,such-a-mensch,4,Mon Jun 29 15:08:01 2015 UTC,"For sure. As much as I hate the Riders, you have to feel bad for a guy like Durant, going down and watching the team struggle without him, having a chance to turn the team around this year, only to go down in the first game like that. I could see him coming back as a veteran backup, but like you say I doubt he'll be a starter again, especially if the Riders manage to find a diamond in the rough replacement."
CFL,3bi6tn,Vorocano,2,Mon Jun 29 15:25:48 2015 UTC,"That's what I'm scared about. Not necessarily for the performance of our team, but just for the dude's career.

So here's how I'm going to disagree.  I agree completely that Montreal should stop looking for the old guys on the way down... Guys like Smith and Johnson who should be retiring instead of chasing the last bits of football glory.  I do think they are making the right choice going after a Michael Sam.  Because, like it or not, being an 'out' athlete has lowered Sams NFL value... And that's what happened to Wake.  He was a guy who had talent, who had an undeserved belief he couldn't make it at the next level, and BC turned that into CFL defensive player of the year.  I'm not saying that's Sams fate.  But I am saying that he's probably worth more as a player than how he's being valued in the NFL.  And those are exactly the types of guys who can blossom in the CFL and maybe become stars.  But stop with the old guys.  Learning the CFL game is just too different for the old, set in their ways, veterans and they just never pan out."

CFL,3bfubj,PhotoJim99,6,Mon Jun 29 20:25:23 2015 UTC,"I actually totally agree with this.    One of the best things about the CFL is that it's more relaxed than the NFL.  We allow wackier, wilder touchdown celebrations.  We let trash talking slide more easily.  We don't keep the players on total media-leashes.    /r/CFL should take the same cue from the league itself.  Let's allow some wacky retro American flairs."

Having a flair could give you an idea of who the person likes or follows and gain a better understanding of their point of view.  For example if I see Toronto and Hamilton Fans commenting on something Hamilton did I could disregard it as banter or rivalry but having a Calgary fan comment on it, that might make me take a different perspective away from the comment.  Having flair for past teams does not really help identify people (to me) and seems as something purely cosmetic."

CFL,3bfs92,CosmicGuitars,2,Thu Jul 2 07:34:43 2015 UTC,"He might possibly be followed by some sort of evil force that commands he get onto the field and throw interceptions at all costs  Just jokes, while it is a terrible coincidence that Durant gets hurt in the first half of the first game, Im glad we have Glenn to help us compete, while he does throw to many INTs and is by no means going to carry us into the Grey Cup on his shoulders alone, he gives us more hope to compete than any other back up could have provided other than maybe Tate."
CFL,3bfs92,PhotoJim99,1 point,Mon Jun 29 16:41:26 2015 UTC,"For sure, Sask has a much better chance with their backup QB than we do. We Esks love Matt Nichols, but he just hasn't been the same since his ankle. I think that serious injury got to his end and had him lose some of that killer instinct.   Might give us a chance to see this if this Franklin guy is legit or not! He really tore it up in the preseason."
CFL,3bfs92,Biggymacsauce,2,Thu Jul 2 07:33:50 2015 UTC,He actually got into the Winnipeg uniform and stepped on Durant's toes himself.
CFL,3bfs92,Animal31,3,Mon Jun 29 03:44:26 2015 UTC,"Heh.  Actually, nobody touched Durant on that play.  He just stepped slightly oddly after he threw the pass.  One of the Winnipeg defenders came close to his foot but there were still a couple of inches between them.  I'd like to blame Winnipeg for this (just like I'd like to blame them for the elbow injury last year in Winnipeg) but a clean hit and a non-hit mean I have to tolerate the Blue Bombers for at least a few more minutes."

And although the eskies didnt do to well with Nichols at QB last year with Reilly sidelined with concussions, I think they still are a above .500 team without Reilly. Which is good enough for a playoff spot."
CFL,3bfre8,woodsbre,2,Mon Jun 29 04:46:49 2015 UTC,Fair point. The Esks were in a race for the 2-3 spot with the Riders. Now both are without their QB. Could be interesting. Nichols worries me though.

CFL,3bfre8,FondleOtter,2,Mon Jun 29 08:07:11 2015 UTC,"He didn't look to good after he replaced Reilly. But he had not taken any reps with the top guys, so there is some hope that he can improve.

There's a reason why I hate the Stampeders, and it has nothing to do with the fans (they're good) or their ability on the field (the team's an ace team).  It's because it seems so hard to beat them.

Edit: I should clarify, I don't want any (most) of the players to be injured. It sucks to see guys go down. I only meant that if he's going to be injured in a game against us, I wish it was a bigger play.

It looks like you're playing the Alouettes again on the Thursday before Labour Day weekend, which makes sense since I think they gave that matchup to Ottawa and Montreal last year (which would make sense given it was Ottawa's first season back in the league).

CFL,3bd53x,theDashRendar,3,Sun Jun 28 15:23:49 2015 UTC,"B.C. always runs a very West Coast, pass heavy offense with an emphasis on receiver talent.  They've even picked up Austin Collie to bolster their receiving corps this year.   Quarterback Travis Lulay is sort of Diet Sam Bradford.  He's pretty darn good when he's healthy, but that's always much less often than you like.  The team plays out of B.C. Place in Vancouver, one of the largest and nicest stadiums in the CFL.  Hometown support isn't all that high in Vancouver, but as you move into the country and the suburbs you see a lot more orange.  The team has been one of the best performers of the 2000's, but haven't been able to get back to the same level of greatness in recent years, after most of the big name stars (GeRoy Simon most notably) left and/or retired.   Sort of in that post-dynasty phase.  The Lions are a little weird because their rival is Montreal.  All the other rivalries are based on proximity (Stamps/Esks is battle for Alberta, Riders/Bombers is battle for the Praries, Ti-Cats/Argos is battle for Ontario), and these two teams sort of got left over.  The rivalry sort of cemented as these two were the dominant dynasties of the last fifteen years, and faced each other in the Grey Cup regularly."
CFL,3bd53x,werbo,2,Sun Jun 28 03:40:01 2015 UTC,"This is super helpful, thank you! And Austin Collie is still playing football? He's had so many concussions, does he even know what year it is at this point???"
CFL,3bd53x,werbo,4,Sun Jun 28 03:46:40 2015 UTC,"He is being used sparingly if the preseason shows anything.  Also of note this year is Tedford has brought in 2 TE size players to play a hybrid H-back position, and introduced a higher tempo offense closer to what might be seen in college(or even a bit like chip kelly's offense).  The main players to lookout on offense are tailback Andrew Harris #33 who is a key part of the offense in rushing as well as receiving, Manny Arceneaux #84 a deep threat who can break a long one at any point in the game, and lastly #14 Travis Lulay our quarterback who is coming off a shoulder injury that limited him to 1 start last year, but he looked in game shape in the preseason.  On defense the players to watch out for are #44 Adam Bighill part of our awesome linebacking core he is a big hitter along with #56 Solomon Elimimian (Solee for short) the current reigning Most Outstanding Player, and Most Oustanding Defensive player. They make opposing offenses plan around them, and are feared :D"

CFL,3bd3vz,antonio106,2,Sun Jun 28 12:29:18 2015 UTC,Serious Question here:  You guys were an expansion team and it was no secret that last year was going to be tough for you. Why do you think that your management brought in a QB who is probably only going to give you 2 or 3 years before he retires instead of taking younger guy and using these first few years (that historically are tough for expansion teams in any sport anyways) to groom along with the rest of the team.
CFL,3bd3vz,Hero_of_Brandon,2,Sun Jun 28 13:26:30 2015 UTC,"Because the Renegades did that with Kerry Joseph, and even though he ended up being a Good CFL QB, the fickle, impatient fanbase bailed out on the team quickly.

It's a ""home game"" for a team that exists 3000 miles away and being played in a town that is going bankrupt due to the oil field layoffs. The only reason there is a game here is because Toronto's stadium is being used by the Pan-Am games. The Rider vs. Bombers game this afternoon will be much better. Also, Edmonton often has the highest attendance of any team in the league so don't judge their fanbase by this. They haven't had much success in recent years and still often get over 40,000 fans at their games (not bad for a city of 800,000). When they were having a lot of success a decade or so ago they were averaging well over 40,000 and often getting over 50,000 at their home games."

CFL,3ban59,GodTuukka,2,Sun Jun 28 01:27:36 2015 UTC,That's two QBs taken off on carts today already.
CFL,3bb9b5,silveredge96,14,Sat Jun 27 15:50:07 2015 UTC,"Back in the olden times (~1970s) a typical formation was something like 1HB (confusingly he is often called a Tailback in Canada even when not in an I-formation), 1FB, 2WR, and 2TE with the QB under centre. However, the game evolved into much more of a passing dominant game in the 90s and began to use a ""6 pack"" offense (e.g. 6 receivers) quite often. This meant that there was far more emphasis placed on the QB to read the defense and make a throw. Putting them in the shotgun allowed them an extra second or so and was well worth the trade-off of having to run the ball from a couple of yards behind the line of scrimmage (since if you run from under centre and pass from shotgun you are essentially telling the defense what you are going to be doing).  Today's game is more of a hybrid. The ""6 pack"" with an empty backfield is used rarely. Most teams are now using 5 receivers with a RB for blocking on passing plays. Those 5 receivers are rotated into different packages but SBs and TEs are more common now than they've been in a long time. WRs are still the big play makers and there's usually at least 2 of them on the field.  Of course, many other formations are used as well using as few as 2 receivers. I may be imagining this but it seems FBs have recently fallen much out of use in the CFL except on short yardage plays. TE formations have become more common (probably due to the recent success of teams using them in the NFL) and the smaller, non-blocking, slotback variant are also seeing a lot of success. Also, RBs in the CFL are expected to be legitimate passing options (same as the modern NFL). All of this leads back to your original question in that the shotgun gives the QB time to get the ball to all of these extra receivers.  All of that being said, it's a big mistake to think the running game is unimportant in the CFL. Almost without fail, the best offenses in the league have the top running games. Jon Cornish is widely regarded as the best player in the league and he is a RB."
CFL,3bb9b5,BE20Driver,1 point,Sat Jun 27 16:17:20 2015 UTC,I think it's just an advantage to have that extra time and space the shotgun allows you in such a pass heavy league. It's always kind of been that was as far as I can remember

CFL,3ban2d,dotCeh,6,Sat Jun 27 12:29:12 2015 UTC,I know what you mean. I went to game once where the wind blew the (portable) scoreboard onto the field. It actually made it past midfield before someone stopped it.  I have this eerie feeling it's going to be one of those games.
CFL,3ban2d,OlderThanGif,3,Sat Jun 27 14:29:34 2015 UTC,Like Ottawa-BC last year.  All the signs blew onto the field and the game was 7-5.
CFL,3ban2d,CaptainHadley,1 point,Sat Jun 27 20:17:45 2015 UTC,"I'm sitting at home in the GTA, but this ""home"" game isn't even remotely attainable through conventional travel. If it wasn't weird before its gonna get weirder! I say embrace the weird as long as the boatmen win!"
CFL,3ban2d,JoshwayTV,1 point,Sat Jun 27 19:07:38 2015 UTC,Seeing Stala in an Argo uniform will be weird enough on it's own.
CFL,3ban2d,CosmicGuitars,1 point,Sat Jun 27 20:59:08 2015 UTC,Add in the fact that he's gonna be our kicker the rest of the game is gonna add to the weirdness factor for me
CFL,3ban2d,JoshwayTV,1 point,Sat Jun 27 22:32:01 2015 UTC,Shaping up to be that way
CFL,3ban2d,BrawndoTTM,7,Sat Jun 27 21:12:35 2015 UTC,American here - I was delighed to see a score of 2-1 at one point. My Canadian girlfriend laughed at my delight at how amazing I thought it was to see a football game with a score of 2-1.
CFL,3ban2d,RebeccaNobody,1 point,Sat Jun 27 21:52:01 2015 UTC,"Haha, as a fan of both leagues it always tickles me funny when I go back to the Canadian season and see scores that simply don't exist south of the 49th. Games that end 29-22 and the like."
CFL,3ban2d,BE20Driver,7,Sat Jun 27 23:11:19 2015 UTC,"Friend started a CFL pool;   Picked Montreal to beat Ottawa: Crompton hurt, other dude hurt, lose.  Picked Hamilton to beat Calgary: Hamilton blows it in final seconds Picked Edmonton to beat Toronto: Trevor Harris goes in dry on them.    Sports hate me this week for some reason."
CFL,3ban2d,GodTuukka,3,Sat Jun 27 23:35:40 2015 UTC,"Please tell us you picked the Riders to win, too. *crosses fingers*"
CFL,3ban2d,old_and_lame,2,Sat Jun 27 23:40:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's about the only positive in those picks."
CFL,3ban2d,GodTuukka,1 point,Sat Jun 27 23:41:38 2015 UTC,Thank you.
CFL,3ban2d,old_and_lame,5,Sun Jun 28 03:11:13 2015 UTC,That stadium is looking might empty.  Why is this even being played in Fort Mac anyway?
CFL,3ban2d,GodTuukka,2,Sat Jun 27 23:43:57 2015 UTC,Some fake olympics.
CFL,3ban2d,CaptainHadley,2,Sat Jun 27 23:44:58 2015 UTC,Pan Am games in Toronto. Should have just gone back to Moncton since they have proven they can put butts in the bleachers.

CFL,3ban2d,BE20Driver,4,Sun Jun 28 00:06:18 2015 UTC,i dont think there is 5000 people there
CFL,3ban2d,russianwildrye,3,Sat Jun 27 21:10:57 2015 UTC,I'm just puzzled as to what there is to do in Fort Mac on a Saturday afternoon besides this football game. Where is everyone?
CFL,3ban2d,JoshwayTV,4,Sat Jun 27 22:42:04 2015 UTC,drinking
CFL,3ban2d,TheWildRover_,1 point,Sat Jun 27 23:05:25 2015 UTC,But drinking and football go hand in hand! (especially when you are one of few Argo fans!)
CFL,3ban2d,JoshwayTV,1 point,Sun Jun 28 00:03:04 2015 UTC,Edmonton sports fan. Nuff said. (although i know you empathize)
CFL,3ban2d,TheWildRover_,4,Sun Jun 28 00:09:26 2015 UTC,A lot of the intended audience for this game (males age 20-40) are currently laid off due to the downturn in the oil patch. It's understandable that they have other priorities. Simply bad timing for the league.
CFL,3ban2d,BE20Driver,2,Sat Jun 27 23:16:41 2015 UTC,"jeez, that place should be packed for this. I'm dreading what attendance is gonna be for FC Edmonton's games there."
CFL,3ban2d,howdjadoo,3,Sat Jun 27 22:03:47 2015 UTC,"If the matchday bus for the supporter group gets cancelled, I'd be surprised to see 200 people there.  If we make it up, I'd be surprised to see 230 people there. :P"
CFL,3ban2d,ProfessorScribbles,4,Sun Jun 28 02:44:20 2015 UTC,Somebody said this would be a weird game. It's living up to that so far. What bizarre camera angles and mistakes.
CFL,3ban2d,CosmicGuitars,3,Sat Jun 27 21:12:24 2015 UTC,I think they are trying to minimize how much they show of the crowd so we don't see how empty the stadium is.
CFL,3ban2d,BE20Driver,1 point,Sat Jun 27 21:25:25 2015 UTC,"Yep... hating the angles, and it just feels overall surreal."
CFL,3ban2d,TheWildRover_,3,Sat Jun 27 21:19:22 2015 UTC,"It's not through any fault of the teams involved but that crowd is an embarrassment to the CFL. There haven't been a whole lot of missteps by the league in recent years but this is definitely one of them.  That being said, go Argos!"
CFL,3ban2d,BE20Driver,3,Sat Jun 27 21:16:58 2015 UTC,blatant push-off. Bullshit. absolutely blatant.
CFL,3ban2d,TheWildRover_,2,Sat Jun 27 23:25:36 2015 UTC,Lets keep it real; it was subtle.

CFL,3ban2d,TheWildRover_,3,Sat Jun 27 20:51:15 2015 UTC,I just turned on the game. Did TSN only bring 2 cameras to this game or something? I'm guessing challenges won't be very popular in this one.
CFL,3ban2d,OlderThanGif,1 point,Sat Jun 27 21:23:06 2015 UTC,It's in Fort Mac. Pretty low tech.
CFL,3ban2d,TheWildRover_,3,Sat Jun 27 21:33:18 2015 UTC,Wow Jordan Lynch was a RB for the bears for a short while cool.
CFL,3ban2d,bquinho,1 point,Sat Jun 27 22:37:34 2015 UTC,Lots of former NFLers in the league. I would guess around 1/4 to 1/3 of the starters in the league have had some kind of stint in the NFL. Mostly guys that were too small or couldn't run 4.40 on the 40 yard dash.
CFL,3ban2d,BE20Driver,2,Sat Jun 27 23:53:13 2015 UTC,Im just surprised because he is playing QB. Didnt know he played some HB.
CFL,3ban2d,bquinho,1 point,Sun Jun 28 00:12:26 2015 UTC,"Haha. The Roughriders former QB, Kerry Joseph (won the Grey Cup in 2007), played Safety for four years for the Seahawks."

CFL,3ban2d,BE20Driver,3,Sun Jun 28 00:37:28 2015 UTC,Why is Dave Stala a kicker now
CFL,3ban2d,GodTuukka,1 point,Sat Jun 27 23:53:15 2015 UTC,Their kicker was injured in (I think?) the first quarter.
CFL,3ban2d,BE20Driver,3,Sun Jun 28 00:00:08 2015 UTC,"Cleyon Laing has injured Reilly every single time they've met on the field. Repeated aggravated assault charges is guaranteed jail time, but not if you have a helmet on your head in the middle of a turf field.   Get this fucker out of the league."
CFL,3ban2d,ProfessorScribbles,3,Sun Jun 28 02:48:36 2015 UTC,The NFL goes to London for games the CFL to Fort Mac
CFL,3ban2d,mruab,2,Sat Jun 27 17:08:11 2015 UTC,That makes it better.  Harder to sell tickets to Fort Mac than London.

CFL,3ban2d,sinfulregret,1 point,Sat Jun 27 21:14:30 2015 UTC,Why run the ball when you're on the goal line? Wasn't the smartest play call.
CFL,3ban2d,CaptainHadley,1 point,Sat Jun 27 21:15:52 2015 UTC,That was the saddest play.

CFL,3ban2d,BE20Driver,2,Sat Jun 27 23:56:14 2015 UTC,You're probably right. I still feel bad about Buck though. I honestly think he had the talent to be the next Flutie. I'm probably delusional but he sure looked like that level of talent early in his career pre-concussions.

CFL,3b9tip,dwelve,34,Sat Jun 27 04:00:57 2015 UTC,I think i can speak for a lot of us in saying it's really cool to see Americans enjoying our game. We hear a lot of trash talk about our league from NFL fans.
CFL,3b9tip,bquinho,29,Sat Jun 27 04:45:45 2015 UTC,I find a lot of the trash talk is from young male Canadian NFL fans just trying to get a rise out of a CFL fan.
CFL,3b9tip,zeddediah,12,Sat Jun 27 14:02:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the Toronto kids I went to law school with who couldn't be caught dead watching the Argos but will spend money through the nose to watch the Bills...actual American football fans seem to love the CFL."
CFL,3b9tip,antonio106,3,Sat Jun 27 14:05:44 2015 UTC,"In all fairness, it's the Argos."
CFL,3b9tip,ocarina_21,7,Sat Jun 27 14:58:38 2015 UTC,"Hey, I love mocking Toronto, it's in my blood. But the year they won the Grey Cup, folks at who couldn't be bothered to watch a championship on home turf spent a small fortune to watch the Seahawks obliterate the Bills. You can't tell me that game was more entertaining."
CFL,3b9tip,antonio106,6,Sat Jun 27 15:31:19 2015 UTC,"Exactly this, I've found most American NFL fans just don't know that much about the CFL, but don't really badmouth it."

CFL,3b9tip,-Rattata-,6,Sat Jun 27 13:48:17 2015 UTC,"I can vouch, watched my first CFL game last night and chose the TiCats as my favorite team (closest to my hometown) and by the end I was cheering just as loud as I would for my favorite NFL team. By the very last field goal, I felt like I would have a heart attack."
CFL,3b9tip,Hiel0s,2,Sat Jun 27 14:59:48 2015 UTC,Yeah the 3 downs makes for bigger plays and more special teams which is always exciting
CFL,3b9tip,-Rattata-,16,Sat Jun 27 15:02:08 2015 UTC,Glad you enjoyed it!!  Welcome!!  Keep watching; it's very often this good or better!  and us Blue Bomber fans could always use a few more.

CFL,3b9tip,laxvolley,2,Sat Jun 27 04:27:04 2015 UTC,Sell me on them!
CFL,3b9tip,Menthol_Moose,10,Sat Jun 27 04:36:10 2015 UTC,"The Bombers have been around since 1930. They've made it to the Grey Cup 24 times, and won it 10 times. The Blue Bombers have struggled in recent years, but Winnipeg has stood by and supported them. We have a beautiful new stadium that is absolutely awesome to watch games in.   There is reason for excitement even though there have been recent struggles. Previously, there was a inept group running the team that caused the damage. The CEO was a businessman, and the GM didn't understand the Canadian game at all. There is tremendous importance in having good Canadian talent on your team, as there is a rule that there must be 7 Canadian starters on your team.   Here's why you need to be excited: First we are hosting the Grey Cup this year, and we have been spending some decent money in hopes that we can play in it! The Bombers are now being run by FOOTBALL people. Our CEO, Wade Miller, is a former Blue Bomber Fullback, and successful Winnipeg businessman. He took the job as the CEO stating that he wanted full control of the team, and that the board of directors would let him do his job. Our head coach Mike O'Shea is a former CFL linebacker - second all time in CFL career tackles. Our GM Kyle Walters understands the Canadian game, and is putting a large priority on getting good Canadian talent on the team.   As far as new players go, in the offseason, our offensive line was a huge priority, and we picked up some excellent talent. First is Stanley Bryant, who many now consider to be one of the best, if not the best lineman in the CFL. He was a huge pickup in free agency. Next we have Dominic Picard, our new starting center. He's a big, nasty, aggressive veteran who is going to bring some serious fire to our O Line. Lastly, our first draft pick this year was the best available O Lineman, Sukh Chungh, who absolutely lit up the combine and has apparently been very impressive in training camp. He's supposed to be a mean, nasty, rough edged lineman as well, and has been taken under the wing of veteran center Picard.   Why is our new O Line exciting? To protect our promising young franchise quarterback Drew Willy. There were big problems with protecting him properly last year, and Willy was still able to impress many people. With proper protection, we are very excited to see what he is able to accomplish. Many people feel our Third String Quarterback Robert Marve should be second string. He's very mobile, has a cannon arm, and is very exciting to watch.   Our starting RB, Paris Cotton took over starting duties at the end of last season. He looks like if he has proper blocking - he could potentially be a great running back. It looks like the Bombers might be running a two tailback with the addition of Cameron Marshall who is larger more powerful back, whereas Cotton is a quicker more elusive back.  For receivers we have Clarence Denmark who is our most experienced, dependable receiver. Nick Moore who is very talented, but had a little trouble staying healthy last year. We have a couple talented Canadian receivers in the dependable Rory Kohlert and Julian Feoli-Gudino, who made a great impression early last season with the Bombers.  On the defence, our biggest pickup is Jamal Westerman who is a valuable, talented Defensive Canadian lineman who has spent time in the NFL. D lineman are traditionally American, so finding a starting Canadian for the spot is a great thing to have. The rest of our starting D line is returning from last year.   We are hoping to be much more successful on defence with our new experienced and very successful Defensive co-ordinator Richie Hall. Richie played a large part in his former team's (and our main Rival) Saskatchewan RoughRiders defensive success. I'm very excited to see him running our defence as last year's unconventional and unsuccessful co-ordinator Gary Etchevary did not do well.   Our linebackers are a bit of a question mark. They have good potential, but we don't yet know what the result will be. The last two years in a row we've lost our best linebackers to the NFL. We again have some Canadians starting in the middle, and we hope to see continued success there.   As for the secondary, we re-signed Demond Washington who has been one of our best players on defence with the Bombers for the last 3 years. Matt Bucknor, and Moe Legget have also returned and have looked good, and will hopefully look even better under our improved coaching.   Overall, the Bombers are going to be a team on the rise. If you enjoy watching a team grow into something special, I believe this is the team to cheer for. GO BLUE!"
CFL,3b9tip,crandell84,6,Sat Jun 27 16:51:41 2015 UTC,Well our quarterback threw for 716 yards in a single game in '94. Best franchise/league stat I know.

CFL,3b9tip,mattbin,8,Sat Jun 27 14:04:07 2015 UTC,"Very cool that you saw that game - it was an exceptional game but not unusual if that makes sense.   I think the CFL has a lot for NFL fans to enjoy. The games are less of a chess match, more like rugby, and the motion and wide open field must be pretty crazy to see.   I'm sure you'll enjoy the rest of the season. It's a different game but goddamn if it isn't exciting, eh?"

CFL,3b9tip,storiesfrom17th,3,Sat Jun 27 06:41:08 2015 UTC,tell me about them!
CFL,3b9tip,werbo,5,Sat Jun 27 06:46:34 2015 UTC,"There's quite a bit to mention, I don't know where to start! There's  a historic franchise, having been founded in 1910. They play out of Regina, Saskatchewan at Mosaic Stadium at Taylor Field with a new stadium due to be ready in 2017. Our mascot is Gainer the Gopher who has some pretty amusing antics around the stadium. He's typically seen messing with opposing fans (All in good fun of course) and riding around in the Gainermobile after a touchdown.   The Riders have won the Grey Cup 4 times. 1966, 1989, 2007 and most recently in 2013 which they were lucky enough to win at home. The 1989 Grey Cup has been very widely considered one of the greatest games ever played in the CFL. If you have some time to spare, look it up on YouTube. You won't be disappointed.   The Rider fanbase is easily one of the most dedicated in the league. They've stuck with the team through some pretty noteworthy dark years. In the 90's, the team was doing so poorly financially that a telethon was held to save them. Luckily, the telethon was successful and as of today, the Riders are the most profitable franchises in the league. The fans are so dedicated that you'll often see a very good chunk of green in the stands during road games. Teams usually see at least a small spike in attendance when the Riders come to town.   As for the team identity, they're kind of in a bit of a shift right now. This season, they're going through an overhaul in coaching staff with new offensive and defensive coordinators. If you're a fan of short passes and monster D-Lines, you'll love the Riders. Personally, my favourite players are Slotback Weston Dressler for his deceptive speed and heart and Defensive End John Chick for the sheer fact that he's an absolute monster.   I hope I covered most of the bases. If there's anything else you want to know, just ask.   I'll leave you with the highlight of last season. Best of luck with deciding on a team!   EDIT: I totally forgot the rivalry! They're biggest rival is the Winnipeg Blue Bombers. They traditionally play on the Labour Day weekend and rematch the next week in the Banjo Bowl. The term was coined when Bomber kicker Troy Westwood when he referred to people from Saskatchewan as ""a bunch of Banjo picking inbreds"" later half apologizing by saying that the majority of people from Saskatchewan have no idea how to play the Banjo. You could say that the rivalry gets a little heated at times. But it makes for some fantastic football."
CFL,3b9tip,ocarina_21,3,Sat Jun 27 07:31:15 2015 UTC,"Great summary.  A few other things:  The team is community owned.  Similar to the GB Packers.   The Riders sell the 3rd most merchandise in Canada - behind the Toronto Maple Leafs and the Montreal Canadiens.   Not bad considering the province of Saskatchewan is just over a million people.   Riders are similar to the cowboys in the fact they have a massive fan base that extends coast to coast.  Saskatchewan is kind of Texas Jr in regards to football --  football is the sport up here.  Incredibly popular. Fans are absolute diehards and are very knowledgeable.    Games in Saskatchewan are very similar to College games in the states (or so the american side of my family says)  Everyone is in some sort of costume.  The atmosphere is just a huge party.  I think Mosaic Stadium was voted a must visit place to watch football by Sports Illustrated or something of the like.    As previously mentioned, they play their rivals - Winnipeg in the season opener in Saskatchewan.  It will be a great game to watch if you have the time.   6pm centeral standard time."
CFL,3b9tip,Stach37,4,Sat Jun 27 11:34:33 2015 UTC,"dont cheer for the riders, cheer for either the argos or the redblacks as they need fans :P"
CFL,3b9tip,coelurosauravus,2,Sat Jun 27 08:41:19 2015 UTC,"Not to mention the really weird stuff that is what makes me like them. Weston Dressler was coming back from the NFL last year and getting offers around the league. Local businesses were offering him free sandwiches and stuff to sweeten his contract. And then the merch. If you ever wanted to root for a team whose merch includes windshield washing fluid, kitchen sink plugs, and raccoon hats - to say nothing of such branded grocery items as the ""Sack of Ice"", Pancake mix with Blitz bits, and Fantuz Flakes - the Riders are for you."
CFL,3b9tip,tornateo2,5,Sat Jun 27 15:09:55 2015 UTC,And thus another was converted.   Happy you enjoyed it sir! :)
CFL,3b9tip,Tim_Timebomb,3,Sat Jun 27 11:33:35 2015 UTC,"From one american to another, its a great product, I started last year and I've been nothing but entertained.  Granted I started following about midseason but wow.  Little things in this league make the difference.  Prime example last night was Hamilton's last drive.  Even with all of Calgary's timeouts spent and so little time, the ti-cats were never assured victory, and Calgary snatched it from them viciously.  Its a beautiful games and I've turned off NFL games to watch cfl games consistently"

Are the temporary seats 'bad' or 'over priced'?  Seems sort of strange that an event like this would not be popular up there.  Just seems like something is not adding up.
CFL,3b8xz1,c74,7,Sat Jun 27 00:01:13 2015 UTC,15k i believe. They looked fine when i saw them on tv. Not sure about price.
CFL,3b8xz1,bquinho,3,Sat Jun 27 00:57:25 2015 UTC,Prices from their website:   Family Zone $49 Corner Seating (Sections UU & VV with limited visibility) $49 Sideline (permanent seats) $99 Sideline (temporary bench seating) $99 Kids 5 and under - free    Pretty much in the same ballpark as what you'd pay for lower-bowl seats in Commonwealth Stadium.

CFL,3b8hj5,B_Gallagher,10,Sat Jun 27 01:42:35 2015 UTC,"Watched this game because I'm sports deprived right now, boy did this not disappoint! Not a bad league you guys up north have, surprised at the crowd this drew also. I might have to watch more of these!"
CFL,3b8hj5,-Rattata-,7,Sat Jun 27 04:01:34 2015 UTC,Hey. Hey Stamps  Fuck you guys :(  [edit] :)
CFL,3b8hj5,Vickdumm,6,Sat Jun 27 01:14:15 2015 UTC,OH YEAAA???  WELL THE JERK STORE CALLED  AND THEY'RE ALL OUT OF YOUUUU
CFL,3b8hj5,OneOfThePack,9,Sat Jun 27 01:45:54 2015 UTC,Holy shit that Pick Six!
CFL,3b8hj5,Hiel0s,9,Sat Jun 27 01:15:00 2015 UTC,The Hamilton offense hasn't scored and it's already 14-7 lol
CFL,3b8hj5,mattbin,7,Sat Jun 27 01:38:28 2015 UTC,Will Hamilton offense score any points? Stay tuned!
CFL,3b8hj5,-Rattata-,8,Sat Jun 27 01:39:04 2015 UTC,Why bother?
CFL,3b8hj5,CosmicGuitars,4,Sat Jun 27 01:39:37 2015 UTC,Overrated
CFL,3b8hj5,OneOfThePack,9,Sat Jun 27 01:40:53 2015 UTC,Andy.. :(
CFL,3b8hj5,Johannes_silentio,6,Sat Jun 27 02:17:20 2015 UTC,Returns are so much more exciting without the fair catch.
CFL,3b8hj5,FondleOtter,5,Sat Jun 27 03:04:52 2015 UTC,Canadian who only watches NFL (until now). How often do punt returners get laid out?
CFL,3b8hj5,Hiel0s,4,Sat Jun 27 03:05:38 2015 UTC,"It happens often. There is no fair catch so lots of opportunities for cover teams to do damage, and vice versa."
CFL,3b8hj5,-Rattata-,8,Sat Jun 27 03:07:09 2015 UTC,R.E.K.T. (until review) HELL YEAH!
CFL,3b8hj5,ArminscopyofSwank,3,Sat Jun 27 03:35:10 2015 UTC,"Honestly it might get overturned, but I can't see the ball at all, the ref says the ball didn't cross but it seems clear his body did"
CFL,3b8hj5,signious,6,Sat Jun 27 03:36:58 2015 UTC,Let's hope for a great game tonight!
CFL,3b8hj5,Hiel0s,8,Fri Jun 26 23:35:45 2015 UTC,As a full-blooded Saskatchewanian living in Calgary: GO TICATS!  I want to flavour my coffee on Monday with the sweet sweet tears of coworkers
CFL,3b8hj5,BrawndoTTM,8,Sat Jun 27 00:28:00 2015 UTC,"Wow, that was a great pick, what a way to start."
CFL,3b8hj5,-Rattata-,7,Sat Jun 27 01:16:35 2015 UTC,Ti-Cat flairs are out in force in this thread.
CFL,3b8hj5,BrawndoTTM,5,Sat Jun 27 01:44:30 2015 UTC,RamLaw!  We're a dedicated base
CFL,3b8hj5,-Rattata-,8,Sat Jun 27 01:45:14 2015 UTC,"I'll say, the ratio of Ti-Cat to Stamps here is nuts!"
CFL,3b8hj5,BrawndoTTM,3,Sat Jun 27 01:47:43 2015 UTC,"Which is weird, I figured there'd be more Stamps"
CFL,3b8hj5,-Rattata-,5,Sat Jun 27 01:50:21 2015 UTC,Perhaps they're all watching the NHL draft.
CFL,3b8hj5,BrawndoTTM,5,Sat Jun 27 01:51:54 2015 UTC,Laaaaaaaaaame  Football > Hockey
CFL,3b8hj5,-Rattata-,5,Sat Jun 27 01:52:39 2015 UTC,"Agreed. I started trying to watch the NHL draft, and then realized I had no idea who any of these prospects were, so I flipped over here."
CFL,3b8hj5,BrawndoTTM,3,Sat Jun 27 01:55:17 2015 UTC,Yeah everyone's not established the same way they are with the NFL draft. I can't get invested
CFL,3b8hj5,fallentraveler,5,Sat Jun 27 01:56:45 2015 UTC,Plus half these prospects are going to get kicked to some kind of D-league for a few years even if they're first rounders. It's just not the same.
CFL,3b8hj5,FondleOtter,7,Sat Jun 27 01:58:07 2015 UTC,"An American here. I've watched the CFL on and off for a few years and this year I'm committing to every week! Gonna pick a team to root for also (it seems that the only team I've watched a lot is Edmonton...). I love the game, super pumped for the CFL, and love my Northern Brothers (I secretly wish I was Canadian)."
CFL,3b8hj5,drpgq,6,Sat Jun 27 02:20:24 2015 UTC,"Welcome! It should be a good season, I don't think you will be disappointed"

CFL,3b8hj5,xASUdude,5,Sat Jun 27 02:57:12 2015 UTC,You're gonna have quite a few jerseys by the end of the game.
CFL,3b8hj5,coelurosauravus,7,Sat Jun 27 02:58:13 2015 UTC,The Tiger-Cats look like a fantasy uniform made by a big LSU/Steeler fan.
CFL,3b8hj5,-Rattata-,6,Sat Jun 27 03:13:43 2015 UTC,"pittsburgh and hamilton are sister cities and share a lot of cultural similarities.  The tigers part of the ti-cats pre date the steelers.  You should see the Ti-cats alternate jersey, theyre beautiful..."
CFL,3b8hj5,ttsci,6,Sat Jun 27 03:18:43 2015 UTC,"No matter what we're being damn competitive, a lot of people didn't think we'd have a shot winning in Calgary"
CFL,3b8hj5,Hiel0s,8,Sat Jun 27 03:14:07 2015 UTC,GOAL LINE STAND!
CFL,3b8hj5,BrawndoTTM,7,Sat Jun 27 03:34:58 2015 UTC,This is gonna be tight...
CFL,3b8hj5,Vickdumm,6,Sat Jun 27 03:43:55 2015 UTC,Hamilton pass rush is on fire. Either that or Calgary's line is really really bad.
CFL,3b8hj5,Hiel0s,3,Sat Jun 27 02:21:41 2015 UTC,"Goto give credit to Hamilton, theyre coming out in a ton of different formations. I'v seen 3-3, 4-3 5-2 and even a 6-1 so far.   Theyre rushing 5-6 nearly every play."
CFL,3b8hj5,dwelve,7,Sat Jun 27 02:23:45 2015 UTC,"NFL or CFL, it's always the Butler..."
CFL,3b8hj5,FondleOtter,6,Sat Jun 27 02:51:33 2015 UTC,"I'm really getting into this, its easily comparable to American football as far as fun to watch. I thought it would way sub par compared to the NFL. How popular is the cfl in canada?"
CFL,3b8hj5,BrawndoTTM,5,Sat Jun 27 02:56:39 2015 UTC,In saskatchewan it is religion. Rest of Canada is hit or miss. The west is much more into it than the east
CFL,3b8hj5,BrawndoTTM,6,Sat Jun 27 02:59:06 2015 UTC,That was a hell of a catch
CFL,3b8hj5,OneOfThePack,5,Sat Jun 27 03:31:17 2015 UTC,That's a weak sneak game. Why do that again when it didn't work last time?
CFL,3b8hj5,CosmicGuitars,8,Sat Jun 27 03:36:03 2015 UTC,That QB scramble lol.
CFL,3b8hj5,-Rattata-,5,Sat Jun 27 03:41:47 2015 UTC,"We did way better than I expected with how many injuries we've sustained, but I really wanted to win this one. Winning against Calgary with our swiss-cheese ass team would have felt good. But, I'm optimistic for the rest of the season. Good game, lads."
CFL,3b8hj5,RagingIce,15,Sat Jun 27 03:58:57 2015 UTC,"20-0 BITCHES!  Hop on the hype train now 'cause we about to leave the station!   ""B-but you're going to be playing in Calgary, you're pretty big underdogs"" - Some bitch who don't know shit   This game's going to be a shutout, any points the Stamweiners might score were from bs plays and the refs trying to keep the game competitive and therefore do not count  TiCats boughta dunk the ball in for hole in homerun motherfuckers. Oskee Wee Wee up in this province!"
CFL,3b8hj5,-Rattata-,4,Fri Jun 26 22:48:48 2015 UTC,This guy right here. He knows what's up.
CFL,3b8hj5,SenatorIncitatus,5,Sat Jun 27 01:00:44 2015 UTC,You're goddamn right
CFL,3b8hj5,CosmicGuitars,4,Sat Jun 27 01:04:51 2015 UTC,I hope you realize all your credibility rests on this one game after our chat last night. I better like what I see from your Tiger Cats since you've hyped them so much.
CFL,3b8hj5,-Rattata-,4,Sat Jun 27 01:14:37 2015 UTC,"Oh boy. Here we go. I don't want to sound like I'm just making excuses, but I fully expect to lose this game with how many injuries we've sustained in training camp/pre-season.  We're just not ready for the season to start, much less starting against Calgary."
CFL,3b8hj5,CosmicGuitars,8,Fri Jun 26 20:56:56 2015 UTC,Pfft get outta here with that talk we're going undefeated

CFL,3b8hj5,old_and_lame,6,Sat Jun 27 01:38:06 2015 UTC,That was a nice stop. One dude in the middle was a rock.
CFL,3b8hj5,-Rattata-,4,Sat Jun 27 02:11:08 2015 UTC,I'm loving getting to see some pressure on Mitchell.

CFL,3b8hj5,-Rattata-,4,Sat Jun 27 02:51:11 2015 UTC,14 point differential right there.
CFL,3b8hj5,Hiel0s,4,Sat Jun 27 02:58:57 2015 UTC,After the miracle catch I thought there was no way we weren't scoring...  95 yard pick 6 to tie the game
CFL,3b8hj5,-Rattata-,5,Sat Jun 27 03:00:09 2015 UTC,PLEASE get a pick GOAT Sears...
CFL,3b8hj5,IvorWynneStadium,3,Sat Jun 27 03:32:43 2015 UTC,Stop!

CFL,3b8hj5,ttsci,5,Sat Jun 27 03:56:50 2015 UTC,"Screw last night, THIS is the season opener to me.  Lets hope it sets the pace for the season."
CFL,3b8hj5,PinheadRecords,5,Sat Jun 27 03:56:53 2015 UTC,"Holy shit. I'm majorly bummed we didn't win, but what a game. I can't believe we were that close with all the injuries."
CFL,3b8hj5,-Rattata-,5,Sat Jun 27 03:57:30 2015 UTC,"Holy fuck, what a game!"
CFL,3b8hj5,anonymousZJW,4,Sat Jun 27 03:57:45 2015 UTC,I know now how the Rams felt in '01

CFL,3b8hj5,bquinho,3,Sat Jun 27 01:17:31 2015 UTC,great TD pass calgary  wait jk lol
CFL,3b8hj5,signious,3,Sat Jun 27 01:18:59 2015 UTC,Nice to see Johnny Sears make a play.
CFL,3b8hj5,istasber,5,Sat Jun 27 01:22:48 2015 UTC,Lost it in the sun
CFL,3b8hj5,mattbin,3,Sat Jun 27 01:24:01 2015 UTC,That was a pretty throw. Hooray for CFL! I missed football.
CFL,3b8hj5,-Rattata-,6,Sat Jun 27 01:27:28 2015 UTC,Possession time is for losers.
CFL,3b8hj5,BrawndoTTM,3,Sat Jun 27 01:38:13 2015 UTC,Hey Stamweiners? Y'know what's not between your legs? A SACK! got em
CFL,3b8hj5,gronky444,3,Sat Jun 27 01:47:32 2015 UTC,That might have been the least convincing play-action I have ever seen.
CFL,3b8hj5,Aardvark52,2,Sat Jun 27 01:56:56 2015 UTC,"Came for some C.J. Gable, was sad to hear about the injury but i'm staying for the live football.  This is awesome, like there is a white runningback starting...what a time to be alive.  And this Jeff Fuller fella is fun as hell to watch, the dude is huge. While I don't really like (read: understand) the whole one point for a touch back thing,  I hope CFL keeps growing, this stuff is super entertaining"
CFL,3b8hj5,dwelve,3,Sat Jun 27 01:58:03 2015 UTC,I'll just run a boot leg over-- oh god oh god
CFL,3b8hj5,coelurosauravus,4,Sat Jun 27 01:58:15 2015 UTC,"Couldn't find an answer for it in the threat, why did Calgary get an extra 2 points?"
CFL,3b8hj5,IvorWynneStadium,4,Sat Jun 27 01:59:04 2015 UTC,bad snap for a safety on a hamilton punt
CFL,3b8hj5,coelurosauravus,5,Sat Jun 27 01:59:54 2015 UTC,"Bad snap, Hamilton had to kick it through the end-zone."
CFL,3b8hj5,Hiel0s,4,Sat Jun 27 01:59:59 2015 UTC,god that was a beautiful hit
CFL,3b8hj5,mattbin,3,Sat Jun 27 02:00:52 2015 UTC,Why do we have no O...
CFL,3b8hj5,SuperEdel,3,Sat Jun 27 02:08:32 2015 UTC,/u/drpgq just ordered a Holley jersey online.
CFL,3b8hj5,CosmicGuitars,5,Sat Jun 27 02:24:31 2015 UTC,Fun fact: the two most recent interceptions I've seen in the NFL and CFL were both made by players named Butler.
CFL,3b8hj5,CosmicGuitars,5,Sat Jun 27 02:52:21 2015 UTC,These penalties against Hamilton are getting ludicrous.
CFL,3b8hj5,ponimaju,4,Sat Jun 27 02:56:04 2015 UTC,I think we just got a taste of our own medicine.
CFL,3b8hj5,coelurosauravus,5,Sat Jun 27 02:58:48 2015 UTC,"Heck of a series of last few plays.  The pick-6 and the confidence to just run it in with Cornish to tie it up.  I hate you Calgary...but damn, do I respect you."
CFL,3b8hj5,BrawndoTTM,4,Sat Jun 27 03:00:24 2015 UTC,"as much as i hate to admit it, that was a hell of a catch"

CFL,3b8hj5,bquinho,5,Sat Jun 27 03:04:46 2015 UTC,HELL. YES. Buying a Sears jersey right now.
CFL,3b8hj5,Hiel0s,4,Sat Jun 27 03:19:12 2015 UTC,Sears is one of the best defenders in the league when healthy.
CFL,3b8hj5,BrawndoTTM,3,Sat Jun 27 03:21:11 2015 UTC,Why do they keep giving it to their RB when he usually doesn't do much?
CFL,3b8hj5,werbo,3,Sat Jun 27 03:22:34 2015 UTC,You pretty much have to go for it here.
CFL,3b8hj5,RagingIce,6,Sat Jun 27 03:34:27 2015 UTC,Rekt
CFL,3b8hj5,CosmicGuitars,6,Sat Jun 27 03:35:08 2015 UTC,Very close - gonna stand I think
CFL,3b8hj5,FondleOtter,6,Sat Jun 27 03:37:17 2015 UTC,Collaros seems to be losing it. He needs to get his head in the game.
CFL,3b8hj5,mattbin,4,Sat Jun 27 03:42:48 2015 UTC,For anyone watching from the States for the first time after the 3 minute warning the clock stops after every play. So the final 3 minutes can be incredibly exciting and hard to predict
CFL,3b8hj5,drpgq,4,Sat Jun 27 03:46:02 2015 UTC,I think /u/drpgq wants a Fantuz jersey but feels it's too cliche to say so.
CFL,3b8hj5,OlderThanGif,5,Sat Jun 27 03:47:56 2015 UTC,I'm getting the Sinkfield third jersey.
CFL,3b8hj5,Hiel0s,5,Sat Jun 27 03:48:56 2015 UTC,I love the Ticats bringing heat in the last minute instead of playing prevent.

CFL,3b8hj5,mattbin,5,Sat Jun 27 01:41:09 2015 UTC,I picked one up when he re-signed and they had a 16% off sale. So glad he signed for 3 years...
CFL,3b8hj5,bquinho,3,Sat Jun 27 01:51:07 2015 UTC,/u/drpgq says he's getting a Banks jersey this year.
CFL,3b8hj5,mattbin,4,Sat Jun 27 01:41:55 2015 UTC,Along with his Sears Jr jersey and Holley jersey.
CFL,3b8hj5,IvorWynneStadium,5,Sat Jun 27 01:43:49 2015 UTC,He's gotta live that Maas jersey down somehow.
CFL,3b8hj5,-Rattata-,5,Sat Jun 27 01:44:49 2015 UTC,Priceless.
CFL,3b8hj5,mattbin,5,Sat Jun 27 01:46:43 2015 UTC,Where do you guys get your jerseys from? Around me I can find team apparel (shirts/hats) rarely but I never find jerseys. Just online or?
CFL,3b8hj5,-Rattata-,3,Sat Jun 27 01:43:51 2015 UTC,At the stadium on sale... or at the Tiger Town store in Hamilton.
CFL,3b8hj5,dwelve,3,Sat Jun 27 01:45:38 2015 UTC,...roadtrip!
CFL,3b8hj5,CosmicGuitars,4,Sat Jun 27 01:49:47 2015 UTC,This will be my first CFL game! Quick give me reasons to like one team over the other!
CFL,3b8hj5,ponimaju,12,Fri Jun 26 21:24:45 2015 UTC,"Calgary were the champions last year, Ticats are the underdogs from the East. Calgary dominated all last season, and the Ticats came back from behind to get into the Grey Cup. This is a rematch of the 2014 Grey Cup game, but the Ticats have suffered significant injuries in the training camp/preseason and Calgary is favoured to win by 80%.  Really, it comes down to if you like to cheer for the one who is clearly ahead, or the one who is behind."
CFL,3b8hj5,IvorWynneStadium,3,Fri Jun 26 21:29:21 2015 UTC,"Got home late from work/gym so I only caught the third quarter and on of the game last night, so this will be my first full game of the season.  Looking forward to a lot more offense than we saw last night.  Naturally, I'm rooting for the Ticats as I gotta pick the Eastern team in an East-West matchup that doesn't include the Riders; not that I haven't cheered for a fellow Western team (or Winnipeg when they were still in the East) when they've been weak, but Calgary is the team to beat and has been for 3-4 years TBH.  And let's hope there are no major injuries - MTL lost their top two QBs for the game last night (haven't read anything further on the extent of the injuries) and it's always a shame when teams aren't in top form to compete because of that.  Edit:  apparently Crompton is day-to-day and LeFevour is potentially going to have season-ending surgery for a dislocated shoulder.  Damn."
CFL,3b8hj5,OlderThanGif,3,Fri Jun 26 22:56:50 2015 UTC,"Bummer about LeFevour, talk about tough sledding."
CFL,3b8hj5,coelurosauravus,3,Fri Jun 26 23:43:57 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I'm pretty excited that Brandon Bridge is getting a chance to play. But yeah, you always want to see teams at their best. It would have been better for Brandon Bridge to get his first snap in garbage time and not come in for real until after he'd had a chance to develop."
CFL,3b8hj5,ttsci,3,Sat Jun 27 00:14:36 2015 UTC,Im just here to see brandon banks leave calgary in a smoke cloud

CFL,3b8hj5,OneOfThePack,5,Sat Jun 27 01:52:23 2015 UTC,Our offense hasn't made plays though :(
CFL,3b8hj5,coelurosauravus,3,Sat Jun 27 01:52:58 2015 UTC,"Couple questions: Are all snaps taken in shotgun? I don't think I've seen a ""standard"" snap once yet.  Also, is it generally harder to get QB pressure in the CFL? My general impression has been that QBs have quite a bit more time in the pocket here.  EDIT: Okay, 2nd quarter has been entirely contradicting my earlier statement about QB pressure, lol."
CFL,3b8hj5,RagingIce,6,Sat Jun 27 01:52:47 2015 UTC,"id say they probably have the same time, the only difference is receivers are in motion and that means theyre at high speed faster and hitting their breaks sooner.  So less time to wait for an open receiver."
CFL,3b8hj5,styuR,6,Sat Jun 27 01:54:24 2015 UTC,It's more of a phase - CFL used to be almost all under centre snaps. Now the fashion is shotgun. I think the thinking is it gives the quarterback a better view of the defence.

CFL,3b955y,werbo,5,Sat Jun 27 00:20:47 2015 UTC,"Ok, that all seems like common sense but what is a rouge?"
CFL,3b955y,werbo,4,Sat Jun 27 00:29:09 2015 UTC,"A rouge can be scored on every kicking play, where the ball goes through the endzone or is downed by a receiving player in the endzone, with the main exception being a kickoff going through the endzone without being touched by a member of the receiving team which results in a touchback. Kicking includes a missed field goal, a kickoff, and a punt which can be made at any time and by any player on the field. Punting for a rouge can be interesting at the end of tied games because in the case of a missed field goal, the receiving team can kick the ball right back out of the endzone to prevent them from losing the game.

CFL,3b8mcl,krashmania,7,Fri Jun 26 21:18:41 2015 UTC,"Penalties can vary based on the discipline of the teams playing. They're definitely not AS common as in this game. To be honest, I am a bit surprised that it was killing the flow for you. I've always found NFL games to be wayyy more stop and go.   In either case, the game you've linked is Week 1 so it's the refs first game of the season so they're always going to be more vigilant and it's the teams' first season game so they're going to be less disciplined. If you're looking to watch a past game I'd say check out something from mid-season as there might be less penalties.  Either way, I'd definitely suggest you watch tonight's Stampeders vs Ti-Cats game. The Stamps and the Ti-Cats played for the Grey Cup last season so it should be a VERY intense game if the Ti-Cats are looking to stick it to us."
CFL,3b8mcl,DMann420,1 point,Fri Jun 26 21:34:23 2015 UTC,"I have seen games where there have been no penalties in the first half - it's rare but it happens.  There are new rules this season that affect receiver-defender contact that might result in higher penalty counts until everyone is used to them, so if you see a lot of penalties in early 2015 games, be patient.  Like any football league, the CFL has its share of ugly games but it seems to have more than its share of really exciting ones."
CFL,3b8mcl,PhotoJim99,1 point,Fri Jun 26 22:56:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah, as an alternative, definitely watch tonight's game if you can.  I've always found watching live games a lot more interesting (especially since they're the current rosters playing, and they're teams you can follow right now).  Two of the best teams in the league as well."

I haven't tried it in awhile but I used to do this to get around the block, just use a Canadian IP obviously. I used 199.85.71.128 which is TSN's own IP :D"
CFL,3b7d0i,cat-n-jazz,1 point,Sat Jun 27 00:07:00 2015 UTC,"Yep, as other commenters have mentioned, every game (yes, every game) is viewable on ESPN3.com or the WatchESPN app for your computer, tablet, or smartphone.   Some games (I think an average of 1 a week) will additionally be on ESPN2, which is the TV-aired broadcast channel. They will still be viewable from ESPN3.com or the app, as well. For a schedule of which games are on TV in the States, I think there's a page on the CFL's website (www.cfl.ca) with the US Broadcast schedule, but I'm not sure if that's been updated yet. You can also go to ESPN3.com and search for ""CFL"" in upcoming and it should come up with the games, kickoff times, and network being broadcast on (and again, if it's on 2, it's also viewable online and on the app).  Let us know if you have any questions about the game/teams/rules/broadcast/whatever. We're glad to have you!! (from a fellow American Canadian expat)"
CFL,3b6l1y,Stach37,12,Fri Jun 26 11:34:13 2015 UTC,"I want to see him play purely to see if he's got anything in him.  He hasn't seen live reps since NFL preseason.  If the guy loves the sport he should be dying to get on the field.  However, I understand if media storm is taking its toll and he needed a second to breathe, though admittedly the attention seems immensely less than last year."
CFL,3b6l1y,coelurosauravus,9,Fri Jun 26 12:54:04 2015 UTC,There have been a lot of people critiquing whether or not he actually does love the game that much. He spent an offseason dancing instead of getting ready(for a dance show if I remember correctly) and now he takes time off from the spotlight that he put on himself.   I think it is a lot smaller this year than last too and maybe some of those remarks about his ability to play has brought him back for one last shot. I'm not sure he'll make it. But I am prepared to eat my words.
CFL,3b6l1y,Nexcapto,10,Fri Jun 26 12:59:37 2015 UTC,Glad to have him back!

I'll be cheering for Ottawa to do better this year. It was really good not only to see them get their first game but not look half bad doing it though you have to take it with a grain of salt because they were playing a 3rd string quarterback in the second half. I don't want to go so far as to say ""look out CFL. the RedBlacks are coming"" but I think they'll be adequate this year and adequate looks really awesome compared to what we saw from them last year"

CFL,3b3n2o,JasonBourne008,2,Thu Jun 25 19:57:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah I do get some texts from Twitter already. The CFL website already broadcasts live game updates, so all you would have to do is translate those updates into plain text and automatically Tweet them.

CFL,3b3n2o,coelurosauravus,5,Fri Jun 26 00:32:32 2015 UTC,Pull Hank. Fuck it. Pull him off the field. I can't defend him anymore
CFL,3b3n2o,calgary3200,3,Fri Jun 26 00:50:38 2015 UTC,At least the ball is coming out of his hand with a good velocity and spiral. Last year he was launching ducks.

CFL,3b3n2o,CaptainHadley,3,Fri Jun 26 00:30:17 2015 UTC,Interceptions.... interceptions everywhere
CFL,3b3n2o,fordo,3,Fri Jun 26 00:33:50 2015 UTC,Wow. Crompton must have like 7 incompletions in a row now & a interception.
CFL,3b3n2o,Niptacular_Nips,5,Fri Jun 26 00:31:12 2015 UTC,It's the hair. He lost his power when he cut his hair off
CFL,3b3n2o,theDashRendar,3,Fri Jun 26 00:33:29 2015 UTC,he had power before he cut it?  all i heard was he was inept before he cut it.  Though admittedly i thought he looked pretty good in East final.
CFL,3b3n2o,JarvisMarvisMcDarvis,3,Fri Jun 26 00:34:33 2015 UTC,oooo Chrisy W have my babies
CFL,3b5v2b,Loop_Within_A_Loop,4,Fri Jun 26 05:34:55 2015 UTC,"No, Ottawa took an intentional safety when they got stuffed deep in their own territory.  Rather than punting it out to maybe the 45 yard line (pretty much giving Montreal a free field goal, or worse, put them in good position to score a TD), they instead opted to lose two points and have a clean safety punt."

CFL,3b47c3,Dylandickens_15,7,Thu Jun 25 20:50:18 2015 UTC,"I'm going against the grain a bit:   Ottawa over Montreal. I think they're gunna come out hungry to prove that they aren't as bad as last year, and maybe catch people by surprise. Also with the whole 2 QB thing, not sure how it will work out. Ottawa will win a close one. Hamilton over Calgary. Another very close game. Considering how close the Grey Cup was, this game will be great. Hamilton will get a small revenge for last year. Edmonton over Toronto. Didn't watch CFL much last year, but when I did Toronto wasn't very good. Edmonton will beat them by a lot. Saskatchewan over Winnipeg. Playing at home will be the difference here. Close game, with Saskatchewan playing hard to win the first game at home.   Since I'm pretty new to CFL, let me know if my picks and reasoning are stupid because I really don't know very much haha"
CFL,3b47c3,FiveholeIsBestHole,3,Thu Jun 25 22:06:17 2015 UTC,"The best part of the CFL is that any team can beat any other team at any time, so your picks are just as valid as any expert's. Plus, week 1 is always a crapshoot at the best of times.  On the other hand, your Edmonton pick will look foolish when the Argos go 18-0 this season."
CFL,3b47c3,CanadianGladiator,4,Thu Jun 25 22:25:25 2015 UTC,"Haha it's ok, I'm not picking the Argos to win the Grey Cup since only an idiot would do that. Instead, they're so good they're gunna cross over to the NFL and win the Super Bowl."
CFL,3b47c3,FiveholeIsBestHole,2,Thu Jun 25 22:34:00 2015 UTC,Seems legit.
CFL,3b47c3,HomerSPC,4,Fri Jun 26 02:42:59 2015 UTC,I like that your first comment about Sask is the departure of a potential third string QB. lol

CFL,3b47c3,pixel_pete,2,Thu Jun 25 21:33:29 2015 UTC,"I have all the same picks as you, but I think Hamilton/Calgary is gonna be a shootout. These are two teams with a lot of offense and a lot to prove, I think it's gonna be a nail biter with each team scoring into the 30s.  Also I think Edmonton will take the win by more than a field goal. Both teams are missing their biggest playmakers in Ray and Stamps, but for Edmonton it's not so bad because you have a good running game to fall back on and a QB with a lot more experience."
CFL,3b47c3,CaptainHadley,3,Thu Jun 25 21:13:28 2015 UTC,"Good point! With your offensive co-coordinator Craig Dickenson (correct spelling if needed), Pete you guys have an excellent offense, Hamilton as well has a good offense as well. It will be a shootout as well. We will have to see when the game plays tomorrow!"

CFL,3b47c3,But-Seriously-Though,2,Thu Jun 25 21:24:41 2015 UTC,"Ottawa @  Montreal - Defense vs defense.  Will either team score?  I think Ottawa is going to be improved this year, and I like some off the offensive additions.  I also think Montreal will be quite average, and I dislike their quarterback.  But I don't like Ottawa enough, or dislike Crompton enough to pick against Montreal at home.  21-14 Montreal.   Hamilton @  Calgary - Grey Cup rematch in week 1, the schedulers must like us.  I expect Hamilton to win the East again, but I still expect the East to be the weaker sister this season, and Calgary is the likely to be right up at the top of the CFL again this year.  Anyone picking against them at home when they are at full strength is a fool.  35-20 Calgary.   Edmonton @  Toronto - @ Toronto.  In Alberta.  Maybe when the Argos get a real stadium they won't get so screwed by the schedule.  Toronto has a habit of going out west and winning unexpected games, but no Ricky means no magic.  This is my blowout of the week, in front of Edmonton's bonus home-crowd.  40-18 Edmonton   Winnipeg @  Saskatchewan - The Riders are 13-2 against the Bombers since 2008, and haven't lost to the blue and gold at home since 2004.  I did pick the Bombers to finish ahead of the Riders at season end, so I expect a down year for the Riders, but the Riders have had a down year or two since 2008 as well.  Is this the year the Bombers finally break the streak?  I think not, but the last 4 have been decided in the final 3 minutes of the game, so I expect this one will be close as well.  28-24 Saskatchewan."
CFL,3b47c3,HomerSPC,2,Thu Jun 25 21:37:05 2015 UTC,Good picks! I'd kind of expect a closer game for Sask Vs Winnipeg! But we will not know till we play the game! Happy CFL Season everyone and good luck to the rest of the teams in the CFL
CFL,3b47c3,But-Seriously-Though,2,Thu Jun 25 21:40:26 2015 UTC,"Oops, that was a typo.  I've corrected it now, meant to put 28-24 Riders."
CFL,3b47c3,CaptainHadley,2,Thu Jun 25 21:59:02 2015 UTC,"I have Ottawa in a very close game that shows the 2QB system wont work  Calgary in a battle between Mitchell and Collaros that we are gonna see alot for the next decade  Edmonton in a blowout, I dont think Toronto wins a game until Ray comes back  Saskatchewan has my pick because Im bias but no Dressler and no Brackenridge isnt exactly a great way to fuel confidence."
CFL,3b47c3,ArminscopyofSwank,2,Thu Jun 25 22:00:44 2015 UTC,I'd rather be without Dressler and Brackenridge for the first game than the late stretch.
CFL,3b47c3,Stach37,2,Thu Jun 25 22:14:21 2015 UTC,"yeah absolutely so would I, just brought it up to point out I would be jaw drop level shocked if we lost this week"
CFL,3b47c3,-Rattata-,2,Thu Jun 25 22:15:40 2015 UTC,http://pickem.cfl.ca/groups/88  Montreal:  Unless they have QB troubles.  They are on record to be like last year but they have good D.  Edmonton: Although Harris looks nice so it will be close.  Calgary: Hamilton lost a lot of talent recently.  Saskatchewan: (Winnipeg)
CFL,3b47c3,Tercotta,2,Thu Jun 25 22:25:20 2015 UTC,"Pick'em like I see 'em:    Edmonton vs. Toronto @ Fort McMurray    As an Argo season ticket holder I was given an offer to purchase tickets to this game.  If the game was held in Hawaii or Paris, ok.  Fort McMurray?  I'll be watching this one on TV.    Ray is a great/good QB (when's he coming back.....), but Toronto has always relied on it's defense.  Toronto comes home 0-1.  Edmonton wins, but it's not a blowout (for CFL standards) - 18 points or so.    Ottawa vs. Montreal:    Both teams are wildcards.  Ottawa looks more potent on offense, while Montreal has a ton of questions on both sides of the ball.    When you have two QB's you have none.  I think the REDBLACKS shock on the road.    Hamilton at Calgary:    Might be the Toronto fan in me, but I think Hamilton overachieved last year.  Playing it what might be the toughest home field stadium in the CFL is not going to help as well.    I think Calgary romps to a win.    Winnipeg at Saskatchewan:    Not a betting man, and keeping with tradition I would not bet on this game.  Something strange could happen.    Hard to bet against Saskatchewan at home however.  Give the green a win."

Are they intentionally flying so low under the radar? with the big man back in the drivers seat for the Riders, i expect them to try and carve out a solid 3 way battle for the west. 23-10"

It is very inexpensive, and doesn't take too long (an hour if you look at a bunch of the busts/exhibits), so there isn't really anything to lose.  It does operate on a very low budget, so there is no ""wow"" factor, but I enjoyed it last year."

The CFL has a proud tradition, but recently funds for the HOF was probably not high on the list.    My Father and I would love it, but if it is in a terrible state of disrepair I would prefer not to go.  Does this make sense?    My Father and I bonded over the game, and if the HOF is like a Niagara Wax Museum I would prefer not to go.    If it is like a library, then I am all in.  Honouring players who made the game.  Yes, yes, yes!    If it is like a bazaar hawking goods, then no."

Got me hooked on the author, Michael Lewis, and I've since read The New New Thing and am partway through Liar's Poker (his book on 80s Wall Street, which was his career path before becoming an author), in addition to collecting a handful more to eventually read.

CFL,3b09ky,ponimaju,5,Thu Jun 25 00:11:28 2015 UTC,2 shitty QBs != 1 good QB
CFL,3b09ky,Rance_Mulliniks,2,Thu Jun 25 03:11:40 2015 UTC,I don't think LeFevour is a shitty QB. I have no idea why they would start Crompton though.
CFL,3b09ky,mattbin,3,Thu Jun 25 15:11:40 2015 UTC,"If you need 1 yard, he is great. I watched him for the seasons he played in Hamilton and he failed to show much promise in the opportunities he was given."
CFL,3b09ky,Rance_Mulliniks,2,Thu Jun 25 16:19:48 2015 UTC,He definitely had better moments and worse ones. But I still think he's better than Crompton--Crompton looks like a lost boy in the middle of the field usually. LeFevour could at least put some decent plays together.
CFL,3b09ky,mattbin,2,Thu Jun 25 16:34:18 2015 UTC,Time will tell as I agree with you that Crompton will never amount to much and Montreal is starting to realize that so undoubtedly LeFevour will get chances to prove himself.  At least Crompton cut that ugly mop he had growing from his head.  BTW Oskee Wee Wee!
CFL,3b09ky,Rance_Mulliniks,2,Thu Jun 25 17:01:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it won't help him much as a quarterback but at least I won't detest him quite as deeply as a person... and yeah, we'll see what LeFevour can do soon enough.  At least our backup options are looking good this year. Friday's going to be a good game!"
CFL,3b09ky,mattbin,2,Thu Jun 25 17:11:44 2015 UTC,"I just wish we didn't have all those injuries. Watt, Gaydosh, Bulcke, Figueroa, Murray, Gable, Tasker and now Norwood. I talked to Tasker and Gable at an event last night and they can't wait to get back, both said Game 3 returns after the bye week were what they are aiming for. With the depth we seem to have this year, I am not to worried about injuries."
CFL,3b09ky,Rance_Mulliniks,2,Thu Jun 25 17:36:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's just ridiculous that we're in the third straight freakin' year of these crazy strings of injuries. It's a real credit to Austin that we're even fielding a team by end of season, never mind in the Cup.  Bulcke and Norwood are the injuries that concern me most - I seem to remember Bulcke going down in the past and leaving a hole that other teams could almost exploit at will. And Norwood can be a game-changer when he's not stopped by the other team, so he'll definitely be missed as well.  I had heard that Tasker and Gable were not far off from ready so I'm not as worried about those injuries. Once we get back anywhere near fighting strength we're going to be a force to contend with again.  Now I'm going to go light some candles to appease the injury gods so they'll let Collaros play every game this season..."
CFL,3b09ky,mattbin,2,Thu Jun 25 17:41:06 2015 UTC,"I forgot to mention Grigsby too. Bulcke is out for the whole season with an ACL injury. Norwood should be back in no time as he is out because he had a ""household injury"" which required stiches to his lower body, probably a cut on his leg.   I am just so excited for the season to start! It's an exciting time to be alive!"
CFL,3b09ky,Rance_Mulliniks,2,Thu Jun 25 17:49:53 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Grigsby hurt. With Norwood, I am worried that he's on the six-game list, but I agree it probably won't be that long. Here's hoping he's back on the field too.  I admit I'm excited as well, more excited even than last year. I wasn't expecting so much of last year's team to still be around--especially Bakari, who is unfortunately far undervalued--but I don't even think I'll miss any of the players who are gone, and I'm excited to see what this team will do.   Third time's the charm! Oskee wee wee!"
CFL,3b09ky,mattbin,2,Thu Jun 25 17:54:33 2015 UTC,"Two QB system is always a bad sign,  No one has two Anthony Calvillos."
CFL,3b09ky,CaptainHadley,3,Thu Jun 25 02:28:56 2015 UTC,"So basically you're saying you don't have a lot of confidence in Crompton, so then the question becomes why is he the starting QB?"
CFL,3b09ky,chemicalxv,3,Thu Jun 25 02:41:10 2015 UTC,That isn't a good sign for either Crompton or LeFevour. I think we'll see either Brandon Bridge or Rakeem Cato takd over by the end of the year

Basketball: Same as soccer only replace with Toronto  Baseball: MLB in the last twenty years has done everything in it's power to turn Canadians off baseball and it's worked. The Expos are gone. There's almost no minor league ball left (we had like 10 teams when the Jays won their last), outside the IBL and some senior leagues out east baseball is effectively dead.

Lots of people were out in pubs watching the World Cup last summer (I went with some friends during work hours to some of the games).  Plenty of people from all over the world live here too (I've played on a team with mostly African students, and my current team has a Dutchman and an Irishman on it).

But personally, I love watching rushers. Adrian Peterson is my favourite football player (on the field) of all time, while in my more youthful days it was Charles Roberts. Unfortunately, 3 downs does not lend itself favourably to a running game.   That reason alone makes the CFL less fun. Most offensive series (especially watching the fucking Bombers) are just run-pass-punt, with no real excitement.   But again, maybe that's just a lifetime of being a Bomber fan that makes me feel this way. Seriously, how the fuck do you not win in 25-fucking-years in an eight team league?!"

Throughout the preseason we really didn't see much of a change on punt returns. It's going to increase the return yards on the small scale by providing a small amount of extra space to run initially. But instead of only having the punter on the back end to save a touchdown, now you have 5 extra safety-nets. What everyone seems to be forgetting is that the interior lineman are never the first contact downfield anyways. The returner still has to beat the first 2 men and then will have an extra little buffer before hitting a wall. It will help make more 10-15 yard returns, but I can't see the touchdowns being any more common."

Always a deep ball threat and when it's a short route he dances around after he catches it. Taj has grown to a point where he's still a deep threat, but he learned to head up field after catching short passes instead of dancing around. I'm sure with a little experience Roosevelt will learn. I think the problem with American receivers is that they see such a wide field so they think that scrambling around might work, eventually they all learn that turning upfield for 3 yards is better than scrambling for half that."

The game is free. Sign up here.    I set up a similar NASL Pickem game for /r/NASLSoccer, where I'm a moderator, and figured I would do the same here after the positive response to my feeler. From what I can gather, there aren't many CFL Pickem options out there.    Here are the game rules. Predict the score of each of the 86 games this season and earn points based on your picks versus the real scores. You earn 30 points for a correct result, up to 15 for the correct winning margin, up to six points for each correct team score, and six extra points if you pick the exact score correctly. The person with the most points from each of their picks is the winner.    We keep track of weekly, monthly, and full season results.    We also ask that each participant select the team they support, so that we can keep track of the best performing fan group in the CFL. We also provide the standings within each fan group. Please pass the game along to fellow fans of your team.    If you're not interested in participating, perhaps you'd still be interested in our season results grid and the game score grid.    We also have a predictions average and average pick score page which we can all use to help determine favorites before the game and the upset magnitude afterward.    I'm currently looking for volunteers to help with score updates and a weekly preview and/or review writer. I'm open to reproducing content from another website or otherwise partnering with another website to show their previews/reviews. I'm hoping to find a sponsor of the game, message or email me if interested. If a sponsor can be found, I may be able to offer up a prize to the winner(s).    Please check out our other fantasy games as well, I do this all as a hobby and hate to see effort go to waste."

He's a Canadian with good size, good hands, good route running, and he was very consistent. I guess they just feel like Korey Williams has more talent right now.  Hugh O'Neill wasn't going to make the team no matter how well he did as long as Milo didn't fuck up too badly. Woldu really should have been gone last year since his only use is special teams which isn't exactly a position you want to spend on a 30 year old. Woldu couldn't play defence because he was too slow and got torched over the top every single time. The only reason he was kicking around was because he's a hometown kid that the city loves."

CFL,3akr9t,Handjobber,2,Sun Jun 21 15:41:10 2015 UTC,"I would agree, same with Doughty. But the problem is that they can sign with anyone now and I feel like Pierzchalski is going to be a stud in the future.  Project players are important for keeping the cap low and the Canadian talent pool high.  Rob Bagg and Getzlaf were in the same boat when they started and now they are both starters who have each played a big role in our previous success. It would be a shame to see him get picked up by someone else because we wanted to keep an okay American on second string."

CFL,3aiw2i,Djruggs,7,Sat Jun 20 17:44:26 2015 UTC,"the big thing in college ball is youre playing against 2 or 3 guys who have a decent shot at making it to the pros on any given college roster, the weaknesses in college are easier to exploit because those top tier guys are often light years ahead of anyone else.  Once you hit NFL or CFL, the weaknesses are so much smaller and a lot harder to beat.    sometimes you're also a product of your system, Alabama has had some hulks at running back, but you need to look at Alabama's o-line to get the whole story.  those guys could throw some d-lines around like rag dolls.  when you hit the pros, those d lines are the best players from NCAA and CIS, and aren't pushovers.  but most of all, you need the right skill set to succeed in the CFL, QBs need to be mobile but still effectively passers first, a good CFL QB can extend the play on a big field or run.  the stakes are so high too, an incomplete pass isnt a death sentence, but you have one less down to keep a drive going, and you have less time between plays to shake off that last play and move on to the next."

CFL,3aiw2i,rsvpism1,9,Sun Jun 21 01:29:27 2015 UTC,"-The ball is bigger so any QB with smaller hands isn't going to have a fun time  -The field is wider so throws to the flats/sidelines take longer and more throw power  -Some probably just can't adjust to that extra guy on the defense despite having one themselves  -Unless you have some ridiculously elite RB like Cornish there really is no concept of ""run to set up the pass"" and play-action plays less of a role (a lot of guys live and die by this)  -Some just aren't good QB prospects regardless of where they play. The quality of the guys you're playing against doesn't matter if you can't learn a playbook/read the defense/can't hit the broad side of a barn."

CFL,3aiw2i,RagingIce,1 point,Sat Jun 20 19:37:54 2015 UTC,"The cfl ball's specifications actually allow the ball to be smaller, which is pretty funny considering everyone thinks the cfl balls are so much bigger."

CFL,3aiw2i,ponimaju,3,Sat Jun 20 21:39:31 2015 UTC,Reggie Slack. He's the only guy I've ever seen throw a screen pass into the stands.
CFL,3aiw2i,BE20Driver,2,Sun Jun 21 05:08:56 2015 UTC,"Oh God, that sideline pass. I still remember Heath Rylance starting off a 1998 game in Edmonton by throwing a pick-six with the very first pass. In my memory, you could hear the Rider fans screaming as the ball was thrown - it was that obvious, to a CFL fan, what was going to happen, but Rylance thought it'd get there in time."
CFL,3aiw2i,roolb,3,Sat Jun 20 18:39:51 2015 UTC,"Because basically every aspect of the game is different, these quarterbacks have been trained to play a game and on a field that doesn't really resemble Canadian football at all."
CFL,3aiw2i,mxckxnz,3,Sat Jun 20 17:48:27 2015 UTC,"Some QBs from big college programs weren't asked to pass much, especially in decades past. Tony Rice was an all-American at Notre Dame doing little more than handing off and hitting wide-open targets. That got him a look up here, but he failed. There are also better athletes up here imply by virtue of it being a pro game."
CFL,3aiw2i,roolb,1 point,Sat Jun 20 18:42:03 2015 UTC,Isn't that the main reason why Blake Sims was cut this year?
CFL,3aiw2i,SinkableAverage,1 point,Sat Jun 20 19:21:18 2015 UTC,"Looks like Sims passed about 25 times per game in college, which should be enough to season a guy, right?"
CFL,3aiw2i,roolb,3,Sat Jun 20 21:17:31 2015 UTC,"There is a massive difference between college and professional football. The players are bigger, faster, stronger, and the game is much faster. There are plenty of very good college players who simply are not good enough to play at the next level."
CFL,3aiw2i,doug_brownies,6,Sat Jun 20 19:03:49 2015 UTC,"It's a very different game. That extra player is a big deal, it's a whole new style of defense to learn and and the quarterback needs to make his reads quicker, especially as the receivers are allowed to be moving at the time of the snap. If a quarterback can't read a defense in the NFL, the CFL is going to give him fits. The same thing goes for pressure, the d-line can look at the motion and use it to get a jump on the snap. The blitzing is more pass-oriented, so the quarterback has to be aware of the pocket and has to be able to extend plays with their legs. Plus, with a wider field the quarterback needs to have some serious arm strength or he's going to either get picked off, or get his quarterback killed. It's actually easier for a CFL quarterback to transition to the NFL if you can believe it. Joe Theismann, Doug Flutie, Joe Kapp, and Warren Moon all did very well in the NFL. Compare that to a Todd Marianovich or Andre Ware, who were both actually better with their NFL teams than they were in the CFL. The decision-making, arm strength and improvisation required of a CFL quarterback gives them an advantage over the traditional NFL pocket-passer. The real issue is that the CFL asks more from its quarterbacks than the NFL does, so it's a hard transition. Plus, if a player washed out due to injuries, they're going to get hit a lot harder and more often in the CFL. If a quarterback failed in the NFL because they didn't fit the traditional mold of a quarterback despite being crazy talented, like a Doug Flutie then they'll be fine. If it's decision-making, pocket presence, toughness, or arm strength issue though, they will wash out of the league."
CFL,3aiw2i,thisratwouldlikepie,3,Sat Jun 20 21:15:19 2015 UTC,I actually think Henry Burris could have done OK in the NFL too if he'd ever gotten a half-season as a starter to get settled. Whereas most of the star CFL receivers who take a shot at the U.S. are fooling themselves.

CFL,3aiw2i,FrMatthewLC,4,Sun Jun 21 02:04:42 2015 UTC,I believe they cut him so he could explore his NFL opportunities. If i remember correctly.
CFL,3aiw2i,bquinho,1 point,Sun Jun 21 02:17:17 2015 UTC,I'm a Calgarian who lives in the States. I don't follow the Bombers much. The story here was he was cut and working at Foot Locker when the Seahawks called.  The implied presumption (for non-Bomber fans) was he was cut because he either didn't perform or didn't match the system.
CFL,3aiw2i,FrMatthewLC,8,Sun Jun 21 02:23:55 2015 UTC,"""Matthews left the Bombers less than a year ago to chase his NFL dream, signing for the first time with the Seahawks on Feb. 18 of 2014. After a solid training camp he thought he'd made it but got caught up in a numbers game and found himself bouncing on and off Seattle's roster.  Matthews took jobs working at a Foot Locker and as a security guard while the Seahawks took their time making up their mind on his talents.  The Seahawks released him on Aug. 30 but signed him to the practice squad the next day. He was released from the practice squad on Sept. 3 and re-signed on Oct. 29; released on Nov. 4 and re-signed Nov. 18.""

Aside from that, you can find highlights on the CFL website.  I'm not sure if you can watch full games anywhere.

CFL,3agzty,Benniwannamarijuana,3,Sat Jun 20 15:39:05 2015 UTC,Jeff Knox and Telvion Clark have surely made the team. I can't imagine the Riders would cut either. I hope the debate is just who starts. Great showing tonight by both
CFL,3agzty,FondleOtter,2,Sat Jun 20 03:16:39 2015 UTC,"Totally agreed. I can't say enough about the two.   For debate sake, who do you think is the stronger of the two? Not to discredit Knox, but I think Clark has been on the field longer, and he's been busy."
CFL,3agzty,jefriboy,1 point,Sat Jun 20 03:35:30 2015 UTC,"That's really tough. I feel like Clark is more refined and could make an immediate impact on the field early in the season, but he may be at his peak.  Knox on the other hand I think would be solid to start but may need a season to really get the game. However he also has the potential of being a star in the backfield for many many years."

CFL,3agkjb,JLord,4,Sat Jun 20 02:53:51 2015 UTC,"It was the end of a running play for the Eskimos, you can see the ball carrier hitting the ground under the pile as the clip begins.  Mitchell, the BC player in the centre of the screen is seen grabbing Rottier's arm and wrenching backwards around his body.  The rest of the clip is Rottier on the field injured.  Mitchell was suspended for two games as a result of the play, which was unanimously considered a deliberate attempt to injure another player.  I can't remember if he appealed it down to one game suspension or not.  Rottier was out four weeks with a hyper-extended elbow.  After the game Mitchell also denied any wrongdoing on the play, saying that no penalty was called on the play so it was a legal play.  Even after he was suspended he accused the media of making him out to be the bad guy and refused to apologize."
CFL,3agkjb,kikastra,2,Sat Jun 20 03:06:18 2015 UTC,"He is an ignorant man, with decent football abilities. He probably had a shitty upbringing, but was probably praised for his football abilities and feared for his size and physical strength growing up. Other than his football abilities and physical strength he has no other redeeming qualities. I am not surprised he would not apologize. Obviously he has not made a lot of money in professional football, and doesn't have much intellect. I fear for the neighbourhood this man decides to settle in now that his pro days are numbered. Some idiots never realize the gift that smacked them right in the face."

CFL,3afzkd,pudds,3,Fri Jun 19 22:16:30 2015 UTC,"If you can live with audio, I prefer using internet radio to fighting with pirated streams."
CFL,3afzkd,Tyaust,2,Sat Jun 20 01:45:11 2015 UTC,Especially since the stream quality can vary so much. I have shitty bandwidth in my dorm so I often end up listening to Oilers games on 630 CHED's website instead of trying to pirate a stream or VPN Game Centre. At least it's easy to find a Riders game on at least one TV here though.
CFL,3afzkd,FondleOtter,2,Sat Jun 20 06:22:53 2015 UTC,Unfortunately I think pirated streams or cable are your only options. Hopefully next year they will start streaming games on tsn.ca more

Edit: in general  anyway. Looks like potentially all the Thursday games except the last one could find their way onto an ESPN cable channel, and even if not you'd be able to find the game on ESPN3, which you don't need a cable sub for (you DO need a valid ISP subscription though)."

Is he still in the league? Did the ti-cats keep him?"
CFL,3afakk,majikmonkie,2,Fri Jun 19 21:13:16 2015 UTC,"He's on their roster, but he's not in the lineup tonight.  It boggles my mind why an american running back would pull that shit. Coming in here you gotta know three things:   American running backs are a dime a dozen. A serviceable import RB is more common than any other player on any roster. You will likely be replaced after a couple years because there will be someone as fast/big/strong as you are and they'll play for cheaper. Every year, there will be many others trying to take the job. But unlike all the other positions, a RB is probably one of the easiest jobs to replace.   Honestly, we're better without him. We don't want any one who doesn't want to play here. He had many fans, and he left 'em all behind."

CFL,3aea0x,HomerSPC,1 point,Sat Jun 20 04:36:06 2015 UTC,"Really? It just seems like such a massive jump from regular season and playoff prices. Maybe I am more of a Bomber fan than overall CFL fan, or maybe it's because I am not exactly swimming in cash, but I find that they are pretty expensive.   On the other hand, it's the Grey Cup and I would absolutely love to experience it, but unless it's an absolute barn burner or (of course) if the bombers were in it, I think I would have some buyer's remorse afterwards at those prices. Honestly though I think that's more just because of my current financial situation. I would rather spread out that money at multiple bomber games instead of just one grey cup game. Someday though!"

CFL,3aaech,Lapare,2,Thu Jun 18 16:01:46 2015 UTC,McDaniel missed like 8 games last year with a broken hand. 2013 was his best season has far as yards and TDs goes. West is injury prone and his numbers aren't that impressive. While he's a good player he's not essential like McDaniel is.
CFL,3aaech,JLord,2,Thu Jun 18 17:36:34 2015 UTC,"McDaniel had the advantage of being one of few proven faces in a receiving core, hes a number 3 option on alot of teams, not top 10 in the league, fell free to make your own rankings though Id love to see it"

Healthy Lulay - He won't be healthy. Willy - 6-1 start with garbage o-line. Mitchell Collaros Burris - Past prime Crompton - Team took him to the playoffs. BC backup - Lulay won't be healthy and Ottawa will beat out BC

CFL,3a6a32,CaptainHadley,11,Thu Jun 18 03:15:09 2015 UTC,"But seriously though, here are my rankings.   Mitchell. Guy's in his prime and looking good. Durant. Assuming he's healthy. Rather big ""if"" there, though. I considered putting him much lower because I'm not convinced he'll make it through the season. Reilly. Looked great from what I saw last year. Ray. Much as it pains me to admit it, he's a good passer.  Collaros. The guy is mobile and passes amazingly well on the run. He needs a decent o-line though. Willy. Plenty of potential but I don't know whether he's capable of turning a team around. Lulay. Assuming he's not 100% healthy. And I don't think he ever will be. Burris. Way past his prime. He'd look better on a better team, but I think last year was the end of the line for him. If he played for a better team, they'd trade him to Ottawa. Crompton. Unless he shakes off the rookie bearing he had last year, it's going to be four games at most before he's back on the sideline. Montreal has better options."
CFL,3a6a32,bquinho,3,Wed Jun 17 16:01:38 2015 UTC,"Interesting that you have lulay this low, that was a tough one for me deciding where to put him, on one hand there is the thought that the injuries might have more or less ended his career, but then again there is the fact that while he was at his best he was quite possibly the best QB in the league."
CFL,3a6a32,JasonBourne008,2,Wed Jun 17 16:23:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah, healthy Lulay would have been in my top 3. I have no faith that he will ever be healthy again though. I think his starting career is over. It's unfortunate."
CFL,3a6a32,CaptainHadley,8,Wed Jun 17 16:33:03 2015 UTC,"So is it fair to say that most top 3s are Reilly, Mitchell, Durant?"
CFL,3a6a32,CaptainHadley,3,Wed Jun 17 19:14:56 2015 UTC,I like Ray because he led the league with injured receivers.  Also on pace to beat Calvillo's records.
CFL,3a6a32,JasonBourne008,1 point,Wed Jun 17 20:45:51 2015 UTC,It depends how you look at it. Ray has accomplished so much in the league and if he was still in his prime right now he would no doubt be #1.

CFL,3a6a32,skippy2893,4,Wed Jun 17 22:02:36 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind I like to use Durability as a stat when I consider how good someone is.   Reilly - Guy is great, and durable. Has not missed many games. Bo Levi - Pretty Composed. Good QB on a good team. Durant - Mobile and Experienced. Collaros - Very good for a young QB Willy - Good, but I don't think he's as good as everyone claims. Ray - He has good numbers, but all in YAC yards. Burris - The guy is a tank. But throws a hard ball to catch now. Lulay - I truely believe he is done. Crompton - I think he's the next Troy Smith. I'd put money on him not playing after 6 games in.   For Elaboration:  Ray is low due to the fact 15+ yard tosses are a challenge for him, and after this injury he might be done.  Burris is very durable and a good QB but we see a lot more Bad Hank in Ottawa. Lulay will never be as mobile or confident as he was. It's a shame. Reily is ranked high because the guy doubles as Edmonton's RB basically. People know when he's going to run, and he still gets yards."
CFL,3a6a32,JLord,2,Wed Jun 17 18:40:35 2015 UTC,"I had never thought to rank Reilly 1st in the league, but when I think about it, there is no QB that would trade for strait up.  If I wouldn't take any QB over Reilly I guess I would have to rank him 1st.  But I think Calgary fans would probably say the same though about Mitchell and he won the championship so he has to get the nod.  I think every other team probably would trade their QB strait up for either Mitchell or Reilly.  So by this logic I would go:   Mitchell Reilly Durant Ray Willy Collaros Lulay Crompton Burris"
CFL,3a6a32,RaptorsFromSpace,3,Wed Jun 17 20:55:50 2015 UTC,as a fan I wouldnt trade Darian straight up for anyone either but thats probably just the sentimental value which is maybe why Im on reddit and not in the front office
CFL,3a6a32,JLord,2,Wed Jun 17 21:29:30 2015 UTC,"I feel the same about everyone except Mitchell. He's just too young and has the leadership qualities it takes to win so it would set the Riders up for a minimum 5 years. Mitchell also hasn't been around long enough for me to despise him so that helps. I would never take Reilly, Burris, Ray, or Lulay over Durant simply because of age and health. Collaros is meh and Crompton is unproven. The only person close to A fair trade for Durant will be Willy but that would be two or three years down the road. This is basically how I made my list haha."
CFL,3a6a32,bquinho,1 point,Thu Jun 18 00:23:42 2015 UTC,"I respect your opinion, but Ricky Ray is not the 6th best QB in the CFL.    Collaros is nowhere near as good as Ray.  Hence why he was dumped by Toronto.    Collaros is good, but Ray is a game-changer."
CFL,3a6a32,bquinho,1 point,Thu Jun 18 04:35:30 2015 UTC,"I know Ray is very good, but I really believe that he is done. Also, I like to factor in age just because it is better to have a guy who could play 10 more years vs 2."
CFL,3a6a32,ArminscopyofSwank,2,Thu Jun 18 11:26:14 2015 UTC,"Mitchell Durant Willy Ray Crompton Collaros Burris Reilly Lulay   I would have Reilly higher if this was last year. He will not be as good this year because of his reckless play style that is starting to catch up to him. His arm is meh but he runs which puts the defence in a tough position. The only problem is that he is taking a beating and won't make it through another season if he keeps this up.   If he stops running then he will last longer but be below average. If he keeps running he will get ended but will play great up until that happens.    The league is in a tough spot with our best Qb's all reaching the end of their careers. This is Lulay's, Burris', Ray's, and maybe even Reilly's last year barring a miracle. Durant will be fine for a couple more years since our O-line is decent. Mitchell might not be the ""best"" but he is 100% the most valuable at this point because of his skill, age, and health. Collaros wasn't very impressive last year, Willy will be a consistent above average QB for years to come, and Crompton will be an average qb if he's provided with an amazing receiving corp year in and year out like the Al's always have.   Basically my reasoning is that Lulay won't make it past labour day, Reilly doesn't have Fred stamps so Bowman will have a tough season and also Reilly won't play more than 9 games at his current rate. Burris has no support so he will be in trouble. Ray is injured and I can't see him doing enough to be back on top. Collaros is average. Crompton has too much around him for him to be bad. Willy will be good. Durant has support and he's healthy again. Mitchell has way too much help for him to have a drop off from last year."
CFL,3a6a32,bquinho,2,Wed Jun 17 20:48:29 2015 UTC,"This is Lulay's, Burris', Ray's, and maybe even Reilly's last year barring a miracle.   Reilly is 30 and is signed through next season.  Why would this be his last year?  I understand you think he will get hurt, but career ending injuries are relatively rare, and barring that he will likely be playing next year.  And he has been pretty durable despite taking a lot of hits."
CFL,3a6a32,ArminscopyofSwank,2,Thu Jun 18 01:38:12 2015 UTC,"He has taken bigger shots than any other player in the league and that's including running backs. He is one hit away from a devastating concussion due to his head first running. A concussion on a 30 year old player who's only success comes from running the ball is not a good thing. Look at Buck Pierce and Dave Dickenson, it took one concussion and they were essentially done, and Dickenson wasn't even a runner. I just can't see Reilly lasting any longer at his age. He's not a pocket passer and it's not something that can be learned when you are already 30 and the best years are behind you. He's taken a ton of big shots and people say ""look how durable he is because he's not hurt"" when they should be saying ""Our qb is taking YEARS off his career by not running out of bounds or sliding."""
CFL,3a6a32,FondleOtter,1 point,Thu Jun 18 03:51:47 2015 UTC,"Yes he might get hurt, I am saying that statistically a career ending injury is not the most probable outcome at this point in his career."

CFL,3a3ip2,roolb,9,Wed Jun 17 05:01:04 2015 UTC,"What did Popp expect to happen under these circumstances?  They were happy to throw a big press conference and sell Sam jerseys when he arrived.  Now he's gone and no one who knows anything is saying anything, and it's all ""nothing to see here, move along, move along..."".  If they said 'family reasons' or ' health reasons' people would be happy to give him privacy but in the absence of any information, rumours are going to fill the void."
CFL,3a3ip2,Drop_The_Puck,6,Wed Jun 17 14:59:16 2015 UTC,"probably shouldn't have had that press conference at the start of rookie camp. I understand why it happened, but when was the last time you saw any rookie/newly signed player that hasn't played a down in the CFL get that in recent memory?"

CFL,3a3ip2,such-a-mensch,2,Wed Jun 17 03:25:08 2015 UTC,Well it is a league where franchises date back over a century so being within the same generation works. :D
CFL,3a3ip2,canadiancreed,1 point,Wed Jun 17 11:06:10 2015 UTC,"That ""ochenta y cinco"" loser. And to a lesser degree Troy Smith and all the talk of Tim Tebow. Maybe these aren't to the degree of hubub around Sam, but still players that are highly touted as the next big thing in the CFL.  But yeah, I don't think fans really cared as much as the media who was looking for a big story. They probably should have just downplayed it as he's trying to make the team just like the other 50 or so guys and whatever. No press conference, refuse non-football questions, etc.  This is one of the biggest changes that has come with the Bombers new management. They don't take shit from the media anymore. They don't need to defend their decisions, or when they do it's purely about football. O'Shea and Walters rarely answer non-football related questions, and our team is so much better for it."
CFL,3a3ip2,majikmonkie,2,Wed Jun 17 16:44:33 2015 UTC,"I don't think Michael Sam wanted to come to the CFL.    I wonder if Montreal informed him he wasn't going to make the cut, no pun intended, and he chose to leave.    While a trailblazer, by treating Sam like everyone else is that not the biggest compliment?"
CFL,3a3ip2,ArminscopyofSwank,0,Thu Jun 18 04:46:15 2015 UTC,"Sam was the SEC defensive player of the year. I know its an arbitrary award, but he was seen as the best defensive player, in the best conference (by a wide margin) in the NCAA. Seems odd he can't find a fit in either the NFL or CFL."
CFL,3a3ip2,danielwoloshin,3,Wed Jun 17 15:05:24 2015 UTC,Best way that I can think of it is that college awards don't mean much if anything past college. What makes a good college player doesn't make a pro player.
CFL,3a3ip2,dotCeh,3,Wed Jun 17 15:24:04 2015 UTC,What's odd about it? Lots of NCAA award winners haven't made the NFL or CFL in the past. He won't be the last one who can't transition to the pros either. Perhaps he's simply not committed enough to take that step to the professional level? There was lots of talk that he wasn't in the best shape going into Montreal.
CFL,3a3ip2,17to85,1 point,Wed Jun 17 16:00:45 2015 UTC,It's mainly odd because every other conference DPOY winner from one of the 5 major conferences over the last decade has managed to at least play a down in a regular season game.
CFL,3a3ip2,jdchambo,-11,Wed Jun 17 17:49:45 2015 UTC,"Nobody cares.  The only reason this guy is getting even more attention is because he likes the dick.  That's fine, I don't personally care, but if he were a straight, black, American football player, there's no way he would be getting this kind of attention."
CFL,3a3ip2,TexasNorth,18,Wed Jun 17 05:38:04 2015 UTC,"If you don't care then why do you feel the need to comment and regurgitate the same tired position that has been put forward tens of thousands of times: ""it wouldn't be a story if he weren't gay""?  It doesn't take a genius to realize it, and it doesn't make one a savvy social commentator to point it out.  ""Please, let my attention to this matter serve as evidence that I do not care"""

CFL,3a1x9y,danielwoloshin,12,Tue Jun 16 16:20:23 2015 UTC,I'm a Riders fan and even I cringe a bit when the TSN broadcast teams pander to us during the game (Glen Suitor deserves special mention here).
CFL,3a1x9y,roolb,7,Tue Jun 16 18:49:01 2015 UTC,"I like the rider fans, and so it seemed did most of the season ticket holders around where I had tickets. In Toronto CFL enthusiasm isn't that high so to see a group with such passion warms my heart."
CFL,3a1x9y,jacatola,8,Tue Jun 16 19:25:32 2015 UTC,"As a unit they are boastful, condescending and downright annoying. As individuals they are literally no different than me; a fan of the game that is proud of their roots and their team.  Guess what? Any unit is the same way it just appears worse because there's so many of them.  As a Bomber fan I don't universally hate Rider fans but I do hate the Riders."
CFL,3a1x9y,biga204,5,Wed Jun 17 01:15:52 2015 UTC,"I live in medicine hat and I would say that the majority of people here are actually roughrider fans, not stamps fans. I can totally see why people in Calgary and Winnipeg have a problem with them. When the local sports store carries mostly roughrider shit it's perfectly acceptable to find that annoying. But most of the hate comes from them being successful. Which wasn't true 10 years ago. Just look at a team like the patriots in the nfl or even Chicago in the nhl, I'm sure all of us have that one person we know that despises those teams just because they have won something. Just like we have that one person that we know that faithfully cheers losing teams like the cubs (mlb). Who tends to be the most obnoxious?  The person cheering the winning teams."
CFL,3a1x9y,woodsbre,1 point,Tue Jun 16 23:12:39 2015 UTC,To be fair lots of people in the Hat are either from Saskatchewan or have family there.
CFL,3a1x9y,Tyaust,6,Wed Jun 17 07:12:38 2015 UTC,"I view them as exceptional fans, especially when you consider the size of the league itself. However I also view them as obnoxious and generally massive homers as well."
CFL,3a1x9y,dockingrockets,6,Wed Jun 17 00:17:47 2015 UTC,"I used to have Stamps seasons tickets a few years ago, and we sat beside some other season ticket holders who were Riders fans when Calgary was playing Saskatchewan. They were really great people, and made the rivalry really fun. That being said, there were always some rowdy people around, but our Rider buddies always made the games more enjoyable in general."
CFL,3a1x9y,fearlesscontender,17,Wed Jun 17 03:32:38 2015 UTC,"I'm going to be blunt here, but I don't mean to be rude, so if it comes off that way, I apologize.  Roughrider fans, at least here in Calgary, are almost universally despised by everyone not actually from Saskatchewan.  I've been to a number of a Stamps/Rider games and without fail, every single time there has been at least one melonhead who tries to fight a cop.  I'm not sure if it's some un-written rule that one of them has to take the plunge, but it's so obviously disrespectful that I am genuinely curious to know if there are roots beyond just ""drunk rider fan thinks he can overpower police force"".  I would never get mad at RiderNation for buying up the majority of tickets to the game as it just shows how rabid their fanbase is for their team, but like you said, while they used to be the lovable losers, it seems like the success has gone to their head and they've gone way beyond what I would consider acceptable for a rivalry.  At the end of the day, I have a fairly negative view of Rider fans but would happily change it to something more positive if I saw literally any reason to do so.  It's one thing to cheer on your team (whether that's at home or away) but be respectful."
CFL,3a1x9y,nexxai,4,Tue Jun 16 16:51:03 2015 UTC,"Honestly I think it has to do with the ""small town"" feel of the fan base. I grew up in a small town a few hours away from Regina. There are true football fans but also a lot (especially the younger crowd) of people that just enjoy the idea of being a Rider fan. They get blackout drunk and watch the game with friends. When they make the trip 2 hours to go to the games, they view it as a party, not just a football game. They get hammered, maybe cause trouble, and go sleep it off in the hotel. I find a lot more of the fans from Regina that go to the games generally show up, have a couple drinks, cheer on their team and head home. It's much different living here, if I had to guess, I would say a much smaller percentage of people living in Regina would say they are Rider fans compared to the towns throughout Saskatchewan."
CFL,3a1x9y,reddit499,1 point,Tue Jun 16 22:20:43 2015 UTC,I think you are probably right.  In my experience this describes the type of people causing problems when the Riders are in town.

CFL,3a1x9y,But-Seriously-Though,14,Wed Jun 17 14:46:15 2015 UTC,"I think every fan base has douche fans like that. I've been to a lot of games in Calgary ,especially when I was a kid,and I think every game we had some stamps fans trying to fight my dad in front of me an my young sister. Are all Calgary fans like that? No. Just because there are a few bad fans doesn't mean they are all like that and to label an entire fan base off of a few bad apples is stupid."
CFL,3a1x9y,Thomaz66,-7,Tue Jun 16 20:17:58 2015 UTC,"hmmm Stamps fan points out how belligerent Rider fans are, Rider fan recounts the story of his dad getting into fights at Stamps games attempting to make it out to be the Stamps fans fault.....   I've got the feeling your pops might have had a few wobbly pops at that game and your memory is a bit skewed.   Notsayingjustsayin"
CFL,3a1x9y,such-a-mensch,-7,Tue Jun 16 21:20:34 2015 UTC,Rider fans fuck with bombers fans way more than anything.  At the Banjo Bowl bombers fans don't bug rider fans.
CFL,3a1x9y,CaptainHadley,11,Tue Jun 16 22:02:38 2015 UTC,"I've never been to the banjo bowl so that might be true, but I also know that every labour day classic the bomber fans stick together in huge groups and taunt the Rider fans as well. For the most part its friendly but when people drink that much things happen and it goes both ways."
CFL,3a1x9y,reddit499,9,Tue Jun 16 22:08:07 2015 UTC,"Hahaha, that's bullshit. A couple years ago I went to banjo bowl. The riders got pummeled. A lot of rider fans tried leaving the game a few minutes early, myself and group included. The drunks in the stands hurled beer cans and drink glasses at anything wearing green. It was brutal, but could have easily been any drunk fan at any stadium."
CFL,3a1x9y,Aplaidlad,3,Wed Jun 17 01:08:26 2015 UTC,The number of fights bomber fans have tried to start with me at banjo bowl would say otherwise. There are problem fans in every stadium across this league.
CFL,3a1x9y,Soybeanpete,3,Wed Jun 17 04:19:40 2015 UTC,"My own personal theory for any sports game.  If team A's kicks teams B's ass then team A's fan's are rude belligerent arse's. And vice versa of course.  If it's a nice close game, the fans are generally civil to each other.  I've been to a Rider Calgary game a few years ago, were the Riders lost badly and the amount of BS being thrown around was unbearable. I've also been to Rider Calgary games were the Riders won by a lot and wanted to punch other people wearing green.   Close games have half as many problems. I've found this to be true in the NHL, MLB, WHL...  We've done well in the Banjo bowl. If we get our asses kicked this year someone will be talking about what a bunch of jerks Bomber fans are. Last time I was in the 'peg for a loss was in 2007 and you guys were defiantly not fun to be around after the 3rd quarter."

We'll always give you a hard time (and you should give us one right back) but football fans are football fans.  We all share something in common.  Still, for some reason it does give me more pleasure when we beat Calgary than when we beat any other team.  (Sorry, Winnipeg.)"
CFL,3a1x9y,PhotoJim99,9,Tue Jun 16 21:09:35 2015 UTC,"Same here in Winnipeg but the dumbass redneck level jumps to exceptional heights around the Labour Day home and home.

CFL,3a1x9y,such-a-mensch,3,Thu Jun 18 00:14:08 2015 UTC,"Roughrider fans Bandwagoners,   The success of the Riders over the last number of years has unfortunately brought out a lot of ""fans"" who only come out of the woodwork when we're doing well, and disappear real fast when we don't do so well.  These ""fans"" are also 9 times out of 10 the jackasses you refer to.  A real simple comparison would be Seattle in the NFL, got real good recently after being obscure for a while and now they're one of the most hated fanbases.  Part of the problem of finding success fast."
CFL,3a1x9y,Mannbearpiggg,4,Tue Jun 16 17:13:40 2015 UTC,"While you are right in that success brings out people who will just as easily abandon the team when times are tough, please don't write off all the fans who came to the game because of success and stayed because they genuinely enjoyed it. Case in point: me and my family. I think I went to 3 games (at what was then just Taylor Field, now Mosaic Stadium) in my whole life prior to 2007, and winning the grey cup is what prompted my dad to buy season tickets. We've now had season tickets ever since and go to every home game, but it never would have happened without that initial championship I dare say."
CFL,3a1x9y,mr_shaboobies,2,Tue Jun 16 17:56:57 2015 UTC,"I'm in my 30's...  I very vaguely remember 89, after that what possible reason could I ever have to cheer for the team? The Riders spent all the years they could have influenced me the most, my teens and young adult years being a bunch of losers.   You could call me a bandwagon jumper in Sept 2007, but considering I was cheering for ""coach"" Greg Marshall, and cheering on Tino late last year I'm not sure what's going to take to make my jump off."

CFL,3a1x9y,Mannbearpiggg,1 point,Tue Jun 16 18:06:58 2015 UTC,"Exactly. Ten years ago I could get tickets for row 15 on the 50 yard line a week before the game. Now you can't even get that without being a 5+ year season ticket holder. There are so many more ""fans"" now that it's easy to have bandwagonners who don't respect the sport. Look at UFC fans that will fight like idiots because they have different favourite fighters. It's like you have been a fan of that fighter for under a year and are throwing punches because you don't actually respect the sport. Anyone who fights over a sport doesn't appreciate the game for what it is. The players are all friends with each other league-wide because they respect the game and know that each team is in it for the same reasons."
CFL,3a1x9y,skippy2893,2,Tue Jun 16 21:46:42 2015 UTC,Very interesting point! I do not travel with the team as much as some fans so my only experience are at our home games and my guess is the majority of our fans act a lot different in Mosaic Stadium surrounded by other Rider fans then on the road where they are the minority.
CFL,3a1x9y,werbo,4,Tue Jun 16 17:06:09 2015 UTC,"I've been to BC Place(live in 'toon), Commonwealth, Mcmahon and Mosaic and of all the fans at Mosaic were the worst.  Other stadiums had a little heckling, but rider fans were drunk and not really there for the game.  Living in the province, there are way too many people who wear the colours but don't know anything about the team and give me crap about it.  Best example of awful fans was a guy sitting behind me for the second lions/riders game in Regina(the game where Rob Murphy and co started a big fight, and probably should have gotten ejected). The lions were losing the whole time apart from the last minute, and the guy behind me was giving me shit the whole time(i was wearing either my lions shirt or my brent johnson jersey), and the in the last minute jarious threw a td to geroy on 3rd and 15 to win and silence the crowd. After the game I turned around, shook his hand and went on my merry way :P  But honestly I hate the fans, the colours, and the team, but the organization is one of the best atm tbh."
CFL,3a1x9y,RaptorsFromSpace,2,Tue Jun 16 21:53:17 2015 UTC,"Pretty much this. I will say that Last season when the Riders came to town there was more red then green, the Calgary fan base is getting stronger, this year the fan day had the biggest attendance yet."
CFL,3a1x9y,JLord,1 point,Tue Jun 16 19:40:46 2015 UTC,"This is basically how they are viewed in Edmonton as well.  As the most obnoxious fans of any team.  It's great that they spend so much money in our city and at the game, so I am happy there are a lot of fans.  But nobody likes having to deal with them.  And by ""them"" I am also talking about the super drunk and loud groups, typically of men in their 20s that you will run into on the train, walking to the game, in the concourse, in the bathrooms, in the stands, constantly causing general disturbance and inconvenience to everyone around them.  Often acting aggressive towards non-rider fans, getting kicked out of the game by police, fighting with security guards for confiscating their alcohol, bumping into old ladies, pushing over kids, and so on.  You do occasionally see people like this during other games, but when it's Saskatchewan this is the norm.  I know that there are lots of normal Saskatchewan fans who just come to the game like a normal person to watch the game normally, but they are overshadowed by the obnoxious behavior of other Rider fans.  So I realize it isn't every fan or even a majority of fans, but it is definitely not a case of ""every team's fan base has some bad apples.""  There is a big difference that is noticeable to every regular at the stadium.  It's a game every year that I look forward to in terms of the action on the field, but nobody looks forward to having to deal with Rider fans."

Edit: I've also never seen a person at any CFL game wave around the centennial loonie. I'm not saying it's never happened, I just highly doubt that it's as common as u make it out to be."

Doesn't matter what is being discussed, if there is a Rider reference to be made, it will be.  Hell I've been to a Flames game where 4 of them showed up in green and were chanting ""Let's go Riders!""  Idiots.  I've been on vacation in Mexico and they are on the beach wearing green and chanting.  Fuck off already. From what I can tell there is nothing else relevant in their lives but the Riders.   As a large group, they are the biggest assholes I have ever encountered.  I've been to 3 Labour Day Classics in Regina, and I have seen fans dump trash on the Bombers bench, I've been given the finger and cussed out more times than I care to remember walking around Mosaic, and I stopped a drunk fan who was threatening a teenage girl in a Bomber jersey.  Three guys tried to jump my friends and I when we were walking back to our car after a LDC.    I've seen them block cars after the game at McMahon when the Riders are playing in Calgary and chant at the occupants.  I've seen numerous fights started by Riders fans in both Winnipeg and Calgary.    I know every team has its assholes, but Rider Nation seems to wear the asshole label with pride."

They also seem to quickly forget that SK is the team with the fewest Grey Cups, and was the lovable loser for almost my entire childhood.   That being said, as much as I hate those walking pieces of human garbage...Labour Day and the Banjo Bowl are truly some of the most fun sporting events I've ever been to.

CFL,3a1c44,such-a-mensch,1 point,Tue Jun 16 17:27:29 2015 UTC,"DEEP CUTS THE KNIFE: No football coach takes pleasure in swinging the axe, Mike O'Shea included.  So there were likely a couple of dozen coaches and GMs across the Canadian Football League over the last few days who were more than a little surly or depressed as teams had to slice their rosters in the first real wave of cuts.  The last few days have been rough on general manager Kyle Walters (left). MIKE DEAL / WINNIPEG FREE PRESS The last few days have been rough on general manager Kyle Walters (left). Photo Store The Bombers released six players Sunday night, making the news available to the media Monday morning. Sent packing were defensive lineman Sammy Brown, defensive back Patrick Hall and slotback Lavasier Tuinei -- all imports -- and Canadians Quinn Everett, an offensive lineman and a fourth-round draft pick in 2014, receiver Ezra Millington and defensive back/linebacker Dan West, who dressed for 45 games over the past three years with the club.  ""They're all tough,"" said O'Shea after a blustery practice Monday morning. ""That's a good thing. As I said, the competition makes these decisions tough and that's a positive for the organization.""  MORE MO: Safety Maurice Leggett is back on the field practising after missing much of last week with an injury, and was taking some turns at linebacker and in the defensive backfield. His early review of Richie Hall's defence is all good.  ""I love it,"" said Leggett. ""You get to fly around and make plays. It's a lot of teaching to do, a lot of learning, whether you are a rookie or a vet. There's more guys up front... bigger bodies. And that's always a good thing. Protects us little guys, right?""  Leggett, the Bombers' top defensive player last year, said he is moving around in Hall's scheme, in part to get a better understanding of everyone's role. With a year under his belt he also has a much better understanding of the little nuances of the Canadian game and, most importantly, the tendencies of some opponents.  As for a difference between Hall and last year's co-ordinator, Gary Etcheverry, Leggett offered this:  ""(Hall)'s more animated. He's the energetic guy in the meeting room. He cracks a lot more jokes.""  OOPS: So there was Nick Moore on Monday, making a spectacular diving grab on a pass from Drew Willy and then, after getting up off the ground, running the wrong way.  ""I felt like I spun around or something. When I got up I guess I wasn't touched and they told me to start running and I ran the wrong way,"" said Moore. ""(My teammates) are not going to leave me alone about it.""  Moore was visible and vocal at practice, at one point yelling across the field at defensive back Malachi Freeman after a tackle on a receiver.  ""We're all out here to practise and get better as a team,"" said Moore. ""The rule is to stay up and not have any bodies on the ground. If bodies start going on the ground then somebody needs to stand up and speak up. And I'll be that guy.""  Asked if he would play more of a leadership role this year, Moore added: ""Not only do I think that, but I think the coaches expect that of me as well. Our ultimate goal is to get to the Grey Cup... I'm not really the most vocal person, but if that's what it takes, that's what I'll do.""

CFL,39xkkw,KamikazeCanuck,20,Mon Jun 15 20:24:30 2015 UTC,I'm inclined to believe at this point. A few reporters who have been at training camp have shared their sentiment that he wasn't physically fit enough to keep up.
CFL,39xkkw,Stach37,7,Mon Jun 15 21:02:07 2015 UTC,"It's a sad day for all of his fans. If he is going home, I respect his decision but I think that he should give a better reason. He's a great player and a great person but this sends a bad message to a lot of people."
CFL,39xkkw,calgary3200,15,Mon Jun 15 21:49:19 2015 UTC,"It would be great to be wrong, but it's fair to wonder if it's a situation where he left to spare himself the indignity of being cut."
CFL,39xkkw,roolb,11,Mon Jun 15 21:04:53 2015 UTC,It's fair to think this but there is no shame in being cut. I would respect him if he played as hard as he could and couldn't make the team.
CFL,39xkkw,calgary3200,3,Mon Jun 15 21:53:39 2015 UTC,"Possibly dealing with his own internal shame, realizing that had he been better prepared, he would have had a chance to make the team. I imagine he has put up with a lot of emotional pressures over the last year.  Metaphorically and subconsciously, being cut might have been the straw that could break his back.  or I think more likely,  By leaving, rather than being cut, he still has not tarnished his media persona and it was a calculated move.  I wouldn't doubt there are better opportunities for Sam in the US on some speaker circuit or with some rights organization, rather than being just another player in the CFL. Now, if it had turned out he had star potential in the CFL, that would have enhanced his marketability.  I see no shame in making a career move."
CFL,39xkkw,jmasterdude,9,Tue Jun 16 00:16:03 2015 UTC,And his career is now over
CFL,39xkkw,lostwolf,4,Mon Jun 15 23:22:42 2015 UTC,"Could someone explain why the Al's allowed him to leave and say he would be welcome back anytime. It's tough to say whether this is a skill related thing (which I'm assuming it is) because the Al's could have just cut him and be done with it. I just don't really understand why they are suspending him rather than releasing him. If someone is more knowledgeable on the CFL roster rules I would like some help. I know having a suspended player basically frees up a spot just like releasing a player, but what's the difference? It seems that the suspended list is a way of keeping the player without paying them. So maybe they aren't cutting ties with him based on talent and maybe it is something more? I don't know but it just seems weird to suspend him instead of cut him."
CFL,39xkkw,skippy2893,2,Tue Jun 16 00:35:56 2015 UTC,So no one else can have them and they can get him back easily.
CFL,39xkkw,CaptainHadley,1 point,Tue Jun 16 13:42:29 2015 UTC,I had already said that. My question is why would they do that if he sucked? It seems like if he was that far out of his element they wouldn't even waste their time. We've had players get cut that Taman knew were going to come back some day (Tristan Jackson x10) so why wouldn't we suspend him instead of cutting him? It seems weird to suspend someone who clearly cannot compete and then cut people who will likely be back in the future.
CFL,39xkkw,skippy2893,1 point,Tue Jun 16 16:55:21 2015 UTC,"I'll take good PR for $200, Alex.    So far the Al's have done nothing but make themselves look good with this whole situation - Be the first to step up and sign an openly gay player, make him look good, do all the press conferences etc.  Like you, I think Sam was going to get cut so he packed up and left so that he wasn't officially cut. I think the Al's know this so by suspending him and saying he's welcome back any time (probably know it won't happen) they continue to look good in the press and are now moving on with football operations as normal."
CFL,39xkkw,Mannbearpiggg,2,Tue Jun 16 17:18:13 2015 UTC,I definitely feel like that's the most likely situation. The other situation would be that he has some personal issues to sort out and they are expecting him to return. Can't see that happening but the Al's won't give any hints.
CFL,39xkkw,skippy2893,2,Tue Jun 16 18:06:07 2015 UTC,"Definitely a possibility, and if that's the case I hope the best for him and he does come back to be successful.  However, with the 24/7 news cycle and nothing has hit the news about a death / sickness / something real bad within his family I also think it's an unlikely situation.    I'll just be glad when the whole Michael Sam media circus finally goes away and things just get back to football and not all of these distractions."

His 14/18(77%) completion rate 2013 was enough for you write him off?  Or was it his four rushing attempts?  Or was it his 9/12(75%) for 122 yards and a TD in his first ever CFL game in preseason?

CFL,39vign,ShivasIrons983E,2,Tue Jun 16 06:17:22 2015 UTC,"The reason he's stuck around is because he does extremely well in practice and camp.  The problem is that he can't handle the gametime pressure that he isn't faced with in practice.  His problem isn't making throws, it's not knowing that he's about to get hit or making poor decisions because he doesn't know how to handle pressure. It was time for him to go."

If someone says that people one time thought the heat were better than the cavs then they would be right since people thought that last year and multiple years before. I wouldn't make a comment saying ""absolutely untrue, nobody thought the heat were better this year"" because no body mentioned this year, they were just saying that at one point people thought that."

CFL,39vign,skippy2893,1 point,Mon Jun 15 19:37:55 2015 UTC,"RiderFans forum. I'm too lazy to search, but you'll find PLENTY from last year to suggest keeping Sunseri over Willy was a popular (though not universal) opinion amongst fans of the Green & White."
CFL,39vign,Premier_Poutine,1 point,Mon Jun 15 17:49:03 2015 UTC,suggest keeping Sunseri over Willy was a popular   I generally don't take the opinion of the under-informed to heart.  Considering Willy signed as a FA there was little choice the Riders had in the matter - we kept the only player we had the ability to keep.    I'm on riderfans frequently and I still disagree with you about the frequency of this belief.  Despite that- you're still slagging a whole fan base due to different opinions of different people at different times.
CFL,39vign,DownvoteDogUpvoteCat,1 point,Mon Jun 15 19:39:30 2015 UTC,"I think that those who did feel this way did so mostly because of age, in preseason of 2013 Sunsuri was every bit as good if not maybe a hair better than Willy in similar playing time, not to say Willy is a bad QB he is a decent pivot but he had gone as high as he was going to go with us and I think people felt more comfortable trying to groom tino for the future (an experiment that evidently failed) then letting an older Willy who had already basically peaked, sit behind Darian, I said earlier that I dont think Willy is an elite QB, in fact its my belief that he is 9th out of 9, and again thats not a shot at him or at the bombers its just to say that currently Quarterback is a very strong position across the league when someone as talented as Willy is a bottom end starter."
CFL,39vign,But-Seriously-Though,1 point,Mon Jun 15 20:35:25 2015 UTC,Oh yeah 9th out of 9.  Sure thing.  He was only 1st in stats for half the season with the worst o-line in the league.
CFL,39vign,CaptainHadley,1 point,Mon Jun 15 21:12:52 2015 UTC,"Im not saying this to belittle him in the least I mean that sincerely but honestly, lets say your playing the grey cup tomorrow and you have your pick of any quarterback in the league to start for a team that you have designed to their skill set name one starter your taking after Willy?"
CFL,39vign,But-Seriously-Though,3,Mon Jun 15 21:30:00 2015 UTC,He's at least better than Crompton.
CFL,39vign,FondleOtter,1 point,Tue Jun 16 00:12:27 2015 UTC,"after? Collaros, Crompton, Burris, BCs backup, Mitchell  before? Ray, Reilly, Lulay in perfect health, Durant."
CFL,39vign,CaptainHadley,1 point,Tue Jun 16 02:03:20 2015 UTC,"I 1000% disagree that he's better than Mitchell, nowhere close to it, Mitchell might be the new face of the league as much as that hurts me to say, I also think collaros is far better and in the last half of the season Compton showed he might be too but that's a tougher argument, I'll admit I temporarily forgot ottawa existed which caused me to forget about Burris, willy is probably better than burris yes."
CFL,39vign,But-Seriously-Though,1 point,Tue Jun 16 23:36:34 2015 UTC,Don't forget Winnipeg was 6-1.  Crompton is abysmal.  Collaros missed alot so tough to say.  I was surprised too but  Willy's stats killed.
CFL,39vign,CaptainHadley,1 point,Wed Jun 17 13:53:30 2015 UTC,"Yet Crompton took Montreal to a 9-9 record, with a good chunk of those losses coming in games he didnt start at the beginning of the season, I wouldnt say abysmal is a good way to describe him, and for me the largest indicator of a quarterback's worth is how many they put in the win column something that willy only surpasses Burris in based on last season.   Im gonna let this be the closing point in my argument and restate my thesis that the CFL is overloaded with quality starting quarterbacks, I agree that Drew Willy is a very talented player, my point is that in this time of prosperity at his position, he is what I now think is fair to call the bottom 3 of starters with Crompton and Burris, with arguments to be made for all three to be at the top or bottom of the list.  I hope that Willy and the bombers have a great season and maybe prove me wrong a bit because as its been said before its more fun when both sides of the rivalry are strong, it makes for better football and a better league."
CFL,39vign,But-Seriously-Though,1 point,Wed Jun 17 14:26:53 2015 UTC,"I was never one to say that Tino was better than Willy, however I never considered either one of them to be starting QB material, when willy was here all he did was run backwards and refuse to throw the ball unless the receiver was wide open and positioned perfectly which was incredibly frustrating to watch. I still do believe and this is more of a compliment to the rest of the league than a shot, but I still believe that of the 9 starting QBs in the CFL Willy is the 9th best, make an argument that says hes better today than any of them, I cant think of one."
CFL,39vign,But-Seriously-Though,1 point,Mon Jun 15 16:17:11 2015 UTC,Don't forget the jittery feet - you could always tell when he was panicked.  I thought he was a good backup and fwiw am glad he got a starting gig even though it fucked us pretty decent.

How many interviews do potential draftees give prior to playing a game? I have a hard time judging him because Oprah wanted to speak with him....
CFL,39vfq5,such-a-mensch,3,Mon Jun 15 22:42:46 2015 UTC,No player on the bubble would.  That's why his team told him not to do it.
CFL,39vfq5,KamikazeCanuck,0,Mon Jun 15 23:29:42 2015 UTC,"He's a rare bubble player with a profile.   Would you view it differently if the black first team all American SEC defensive player of the year out of mizzou got a feel good interview on Oprah? I've seen her and baba Walters do plenty of human interest stories for less than I've noted above without the gay thing included.   Obviously being gay and being out changed everything but I really don't think this kid made many mistakes off the field while going through this. Other than to quit of course. I'll hold quitting against him, that is not how you go out, I don't care what's going on around you."
CFL,39vfq5,such-a-mensch,4,Tue Jun 16 00:12:46 2015 UTC,It's not about Oprah.  Sam was too concerned with being The Gay Football player rather than a football player. Do the Oprah special and dancing with the stars after you've made the team.

CFL,39tit5,biga204,1 point,Mon Jun 15 16:54:38 2015 UTC,I don't disagree with most of that. But he's a veteran receiver that has a championship. Reaves is a project and Richards is a rookie. If they can get him for five figures that's a nice insurance policy.
CFL,39tit5,molodyets,2,Mon Jun 15 17:35:23 2015 UTC,What's the suspended list?
CFL,39tit5,Handjobber,1 point,Sun Jun 14 21:24:58 2015 UTC,The suspended list is analogous to the injured list for players who breach thier contract. A player on the suspended or injured list does not count against the teams active roster. Often at this time of the year teams will place a few players on those lists to reduce the amount of cuts that they need to make. The most common reason that a player is placed on the  suspended list is beacuse they are late to training camp or missing practices and those players usually end up getting released later on anyway.
CFL,39tit5,molodyets,1 point,Sun Jun 14 22:35:29 2015 UTC,"List of players that a team has suspended. At this point in the season, a lot of teams will suspend some if they're injured to avoid putting on the injury list, and to avoid having to cut them."

CFL,39rjjz,Tyaust,5,Sun Jun 14 03:05:24 2015 UTC,"Speaking of how far north Fort McMurray is - I was up camping in Northern SK a few weekends ago (so far north that with about 2 hours left to our destination we had lost cell reception - it's roughly parallel with Cold Lake, AB).  We would've had to drive about 4 hours further north to be parallel with Fort Mac (it's about a 4 hour trip from Cold Lake to Fort Mac according to Google Maps).  Also, there are trees in Saskatchewan that far north (gasp)."

It was a great time; so awesome to be in such relatively untouched wilderness (I've been to Candle Lake but it was a lot more isolated than that - we saw three cars go by on the park road the whole four days we were there).  I'll have to keep Meadow Lake in mind though.  That would be pretty handy for our buddy who lives in Cold Lake too."

CFL,39rjjz,skippy2893,2,Sun Jun 14 03:41:28 2015 UTC,I always loved this Bentley.  So much more interesting cars on display at Le Mans and similar races than especially stuff like NASCAR where everything has similar stuff underneath the relatively samey outer body (and the fact that they have several classes of racecars participating in the race all at once).
CFL,39rjjz,ponimaju,2,Sun Jun 14 03:53:24 2015 UTC,"The top 4 LMP1 cars this year all use completely different setups. There a diesels, turbos, battery packs, fwd, awd, and rwd.

CFL,39rjjz,bigwilliec,2,Sun Jun 14 03:55:29 2015 UTC,I still don't understand doing PATs from the 32yd line...
CFL,39rjjz,Tyaust,2,Sun Jun 14 04:44:10 2015 UTC,"To add an element of unpredictablility to the game, and to contribute to going for 2/3 points, maybe when the wind is up or it's raining/snowing (bad weather in general) - to add excitement to the game and to add an additional option when the offense is hot or the weather is poor.  The NFL got rid of it after preseason but I hope we keep it around for the regular season.  BTW it's a kick from the 25, resulting in a 32 yard field goal for the PAT, just like the NFL did (their's was from the 15 yard line + 17 yards for the lineup and goalposts being at the end of the endzone).  In every article I read coming up to the preseason they always said that the kick was from the 32 yard line, but that would mean it was in actuality a 39 yard attempt, but I figured it was from the 25 to result in the same 32 yard attempt that the NFL had tested."

CFL,39pn6l,FondleOtter,2,Sun Jun 14 01:26:50 2015 UTC,"I like the idea of fostering Canadian talent, but it has to start in College, not at the pro level. They need to figure out a way to get CIS players throwing more, and foster the quarterback position.   I got a chance to interview Jock Climie for my school newspaper a few years ago. He said unequivocally that his starting QB at Queen's was one of the best arms to ever throw in the CIS (name is at a loss). But at the same time, this guy just couldn't compete with the velocity and accuracy of guys who played second tier NCAA ball.   Giving a guy like that a roster spot does no one any help. We need to do more to raise the talent pool at an earlier stage."
CFL,39pn6l,antonio106,2,Sun Jun 14 02:42:06 2015 UTC,The best Canadian talent needs to be playing in NCAA D1 football at QB. Montreal's Bridge looks like he's going to earn a roster spot.
CFL,39pn6l,poopy_mcbooger,2,Sun Jun 14 05:38:06 2015 UTC,I've always said that Canadians can cut it at QB in the CFL if they're NCAA trained. The QB play in the CIS is a huge drop off from the NCAA and the CFL that it would take years of development for them to really even compete with starters.

Abrupt leaving.   I feel like people are digging for a story here. We don't know if there is a medical emergency in his immediate family or a death or a multitude of other possibilities that would require immediate attention. I feel like everyone should chill on the judgement until Sam's side out.   We all know this would be a none-story if it was a player that wasn't of Sam's caliber.   For comparison. Sinopoli and Price on the REDBLACKS didn't attend the first preseason game. I'm not sure their reasons but it was not questioned. They've both been lowkey at preseason camp too. Where as Sam seems legitimately attentive and happy to be in Montreal and the opportunity he has been given whether it be his shot back to the NFL or just a chance to play pro football he seemed legitimately thankful to be there, this would be incredibly out of character for him.   I hope that everyone will wait until the full sort is out and not assume he ""couldn't make it"", ""doesn't want to be here"" or ""quit""."
CFL,39mmip,Stach37,3,Fri Jun 12 22:46:21 2015 UTC,"We all know this would be a none-story if it was a player that wasn't of Sam's caliber.   The two likely responses to this are:  It wouldn't be a story if he weren't gay.  We don't even know yet how good he is, if he'll make the team, if he can transition to the faster pace/wider field, etc. (I'll admit that I'm rooting for him, if only as a barrier-breaker, but still cautiously optimistic so I'm probably in this camp)  I just hope it isn't the case that this was a courtesy given him by the Alouettes to avoid a large press scene because it was inevitable that he would be cut."
CFL,39mmip,ponimaju,1 point,Sat Jun 13 01:26:18 2015 UTC,"We do know how good he is though. He was the one of the last cuts of the rams, a team loaded with (good) defensive players. The rams let him go because they had no spot. Not because he wasn't good. Just go look at the tapes. Yes nfl and cfl are totally different but you can clearly see there was talent there. Just no spot."
CFL,39mmip,woodsbre,1 point,Sun Jun 14 00:19:59 2015 UTC,"Seems legit enough.   From what i heard, Sam was close to being penciled in as a starter and it has something to do with his fiance.

CFL,39kzed,OlderThanGif,3,Fri Jun 12 15:39:13 2015 UTC,So players have tested positive and league did nothing about it?  I'd be curious to see who it was.  When was the last time a player was suspended for steroid use?

CFL,39kzoy,skippy2893,1 point,Fri Jun 12 18:34:05 2015 UTC,I would be absolutely stunned if a city as small as Fort Mac could support a football team especially when half the people who live there are temporary workers who fly out every 2 weeks.  It would easily be the worst decision the CFL could make in the next decade.
CFL,39kzoy,PhotoJim99,2,Fri Jun 12 21:53:21 2015 UTC,"When Fort McMurray hits about 450,000 people, then we can talk.  Regina is significantly smaller but draws from Saskatoon and all around, so the effective market of the Roughriders is probably closer to 600,000 people."

CFL,39kzoy,TorontoMapleQueefs,2,Fri Jun 12 22:53:59 2015 UTC,There's an abundance when the oil economy is good - and when it's not there's a paucity.  It's a very up-and-down city and likely always will be until it finds another thing to anchor its economy.  Goodness knows Regina has had enough troubles with that issue and it's far more diverse than Fort McMurray is.

CFL,39c4zn,rusticnacho,1 point,Wed Jun 10 22:08:29 2015 UTC,"I think Edmonton had been disappointed so many times with Ray at QB that some people forgot how good he was when healthy and surrounded by decent talent.

CFL,397hes,danthemanmarino,4,Wed Jun 10 18:32:40 2015 UTC,"CIS football is relatively popular, but only in terms of CIS-sports in general. Even then I find people only pay attention to it during the big cups, like Uteck, Mitchell, and Vanier. It's worth noting that I live in Ontario. Experiences will differ and it seems like the CIS scene is far more popular west of us.  Attendance is where you'll find heavy disparities. The most heavily attended Vanier Cup was about 37,000. Compared to regular season US College games that can pull in upwards of 80,000.  Regular CIS games tend to bring in around 30,000 TV viewers. According to this article playoff games drew 80,000 to 120,000 views and the Vanier Cup itself drew 200,000 people. Apparently in 2013, OUA football barely garnered an average of 28,000 views for 10 regular season games.   Of course our population size is smaller, but I'd be hesitant to say it has anywhere near the popularity of US college ball in the south even boiled down to percentages. In terms of the greater sports world, I think it would be fair to say that CIS football is very unpopular.  As for high school football, I've never heard of people unrelated to the players going to a game. Some Ontario high schools even have ""buy outs"" that allow students to skip class to watch these games. Most will just find a way to slip off school grounds and go home early."
CFL,397hes,dotCeh,3,Tue Jun 9 23:35:11 2015 UTC,"From an Alberta perspective (namely southern,) it depends on the community. Football nights don't really shut down the town per say, but they can attract massive attention depending on the teams playing. For example: All the Calgary high school teams play at Shouldice Park, but the city final last year at the be moved to McMahon Stadium because the amount of people, and to help keep the two schools fans separated."
CFL,397hes,TheDrewski157,2,Tue Jun 9 20:34:22 2015 UTC,Would you say it's the second most popular sport after hockey?
CFL,397hes,TheDrewski157,5,Tue Jun 9 20:47:47 2015 UTC,I'd say so.
CFL,397hes,KamikazeCanuck,1 point,Tue Jun 9 20:55:20 2015 UTC,Thanks for the info!
CFL,397hes,Tyaust,3,Tue Jun 9 20:57:02 2015 UTC,I played high school in Nova Scotia. For bigger games we might get 350-500 people. Not a ton by American standards.
CFL,397hes,Wingdings2,3,Tue Jun 9 21:01:11 2015 UTC,On the professional level (CFl and NFL) but not at the junior level.
CFL,397hes,dotCeh,1 point,Tue Jun 9 23:10:48 2015 UTC,"Our top three most popular sports are hockey, then football, then curling. Despite having a pro baseball and basketball team we absolutely love throwing stones on ice."
CFL,397hes,Highlander253,1 point,Fri Jun 12 07:36:59 2015 UTC,"and to help keep the two schools fans separate   So basically Francis and ND fans, probably a good idea to keep those two groups as far away from each other as possible lol.  Edit: a word"
CFL,397hes,dotCeh,1 point,Wed Jun 10 06:01:22 2015 UTC,"Haha yea. I heard things got out of hand at times during their first game at Shouldice, but that's just what I heard. Couldn't make it to the first one."
CFL,397hes,KamikazeCanuck,3,Wed Jun 10 21:03:27 2015 UTC,Not very big in BC from my experience. Our high school games never drew anyone other than classmates and family. Junior ball had a bit of an attraction but never over 1000 or so fans for the biggest games. University was a bit more followed but the team I played on was far from a contender so I don't know what the draw would be like for a successful team.
CFL,397hes,dotCeh,1 point,Tue Jun 9 20:38:27 2015 UTC,"What is junior ball? Thanks for the reply!   Also, I've watched every game Austin Collie has played in since 2004, I think you're in for a treat."
CFL,397hes,CaptainHadley,6,Tue Jun 9 20:47:09 2015 UTC,"Canada doesn't have different levels for university football like the NCAA.  After high school, there are two different paths to those who might wish try and make pro, CIS (Canada's NCAA), and the CJFL (Canadian Junior Football League.) The CJFL is more ""community"" based, as teams aren't tied to a school, but geographical areas, like regions (Vancouver Island Raiders, Westshore Rebels), or cities (Calgary Colts, Regina Rams (sorry, Thunder.)  After graduating high school, you're given 7 years to use up 5 years of eligibility for CIS. Because of this, some people will say play Junior football for 4 years, then go to CIS for 3 (or any other combination of 5 years+ CIS eligibility.)  Some advantages that junior football offers is that it is competitive football, but people can have the choice of schooling (you could attend a university, go a trade school, no school, etc.)  In terms of signing with a pro team, CJFL players are property of the CFL in their geographical location. If you play for a team in BC, your rights belong to the BC Lions. If you play for the Calgary Colts, your rights belong to the Stampeders, so on and so forth. The only time that a CJFL can be part of the CFL Draft is if he played in a CIS game (or dressed, I don't know...) at which point is is draft eligible, and if un-drafted, he is then a free agent.  FUN FACT: The CJFL National Championship ""The Canadian Bowl"" is the oldest football championship in North America, its even older than the Grey Cup."
CFL,397hes,dotCeh,3,Tue Jun 9 21:21:45 2015 UTC,I did not know that.  So in a way the CJFL is like a farm team for the CFL.
CFL,397hes,dotCeh,2,Tue Jun 9 23:12:07 2015 UTC,"Yes and no. You see CJFL teams recruiting, but not based on the needs of the CFL team. However, it isn't unheard of for a played moving to team to be under the territorial rights of certain team, but it's not common."
CFL,397hes,bquinho,1 point,Tue Jun 9 23:17:01 2015 UTC,There are few cjfl players in the cfl.
CFL,397hes,Canadave,2,Wed Jun 10 19:15:29 2015 UTC,"That's interesting. Do they get paid or is it still amateur? In universities are there scholarships available, or are these all players paying their own way? For the junior league, it's the a draft or just free agent recruiting?"
CFL,397hes,PhotoJim99,1 point,Tue Jun 9 23:17:57 2015 UTC,"They don't get paid, but many teams offer scholarship money, but the amount and policies vary by teams I believe.  For the most part it is free agent recruiting, but some leagues have exemptions. As an example, when the current HC of the Calgary Colts came to the team, the Edmonton teams ""panicked"" and had the PFC put in a boundary for Alberta for recruiting because they didn't want guys from Edmonton and Northern Alberta going south (He's the winningest coach in CJFL history.)"
CFL,397hes,dotCeh,1 point,Wed Jun 10 01:11:26 2015 UTC,So the conference made a rule that said he wasn't allowed to recruit Alberta? That's really interesting. I've never heard of something like that happening.
CFL,397hes,bquinho,2,Wed Jun 10 01:20:02 2015 UTC,"The thing only applies to the Alberta teams. Calgary can't recruit north of Red Deer, and the Edmonton teams can't recruit south of Red Deer. For as far as I know it doesn't apply to other teams in the conference, but they generally don't recruit much, if at all, in Alberta. The Alberta teams can still recruit out of the province as well."
CFL,397hes,dotCeh,1 point,Wed Jun 10 01:31:00 2015 UTC,It costs the players to play.
CFL,397hes,skippy2893,1 point,Wed Jun 10 03:41:33 2015 UTC,"There are scholarships for Canadian university sports, but unlike the NCAA, full rides are not allowed."

CFL,397hes,dotCeh,1 point,Tue Jun 9 21:49:23 2015 UTC,No it does not at the moment in BCFC and PCF at least. Maybe in the OFC do to their age limit changes.
CFL,397hes,FondleOtter,2,Tue Jun 9 23:14:10 2015 UTC,"It's sort of like juco but not quite. Basically it's just like university football, but for people who don't want to go to university.  It's growing rapidly and has amazing support in western canada.  A lot of the best highschool players in western canada are just farm boys or small town kids so not very many of them want to go to university.  Junior football allows the players to keep playing football, while having a full time job.    Junior ball isn't so popular in eastern Canada because of all the big cities. It's just a different mentality kind of like comparing Alabama to New York.  The east still has a ton of talent, but a lot of their best highschool talent goes on to play university. In western Canada that's not the case."
CFL,397hes,Tyaust,2,Tue Jun 9 21:19:58 2015 UTC,"From a Saskatchewan point of view, highschool football is our number 1 sport.  No one gives a rats ass about university ball. The CIS is too unknown to the public even though the UofS is often very good, but the UofR is notoriously corrupt with recruiting.  I played in a small town of about 1000 people and we would get 750 or more to every game which is small-time, but the UofR struggles to get that on a good night. Most of the fans at UofR games are parents, or fans travelling with the opposition.    The highschool football is very competitive in western Canada, but most of the people don't even think about continuing their career after they graduate.  I played for Team Sask when we won the national championship in 2010 but like many others on our team, I had no desire to continue playing."
CFL,397hes,Canuckleball,2,Tue Jun 9 21:11:50 2015 UTC,Corrupt?  Citations please.  The U of R has been pretty smart with recruiting.  Three Rams are playing in the NFL right now.
CFL,397hes,skippy2893,2,Tue Jun 9 21:59:44 2015 UTC,"Getting a citation on that will be impossible since it's not actually ""corrupt"", but what I mean is they recruit low level players with connections. Those players sit on the bottom of the depth chart for years without a hope of playing while there is legitimate local talent that gets snubbed every year. And I didn't say they do a bad job recruiting certain Elite level players, but they recruit most of those players from out of province. A team which has produced such a high number of pros in the last 4 years should have more to show for it than being consistently the 4th best team in a division of 6.  They do well on the high end of recruiting, but they neglect local talent on the low end. Those project players all go to UofS and that's why the UofS does so damn well despite not having as many studs.  Recruiting in university isn't about having the best player in the league, it's about having the most well-rounded group of players.  In the pros you can't win if you don't have someone elite on your team, but in Canadian university it's all about minimizing weaknesses. The UofR's biggest weakness has always been their depth. They lose one or two players and the season is a write-off.   All of this is pretty widely know among players in the province. It's the main reason why the UofR is often the 2nd or even 3rd choice for players. No one wants to play for a team that only values the top level players.  When Mike Thomas didn't get drafted coming out of school, McCrystal's only comments were ""maybe he would have made it if he could catch"". Now Thomas runs Football Saskatchewan and he doesn't shy away from commenting on the UofR program. Again, pretty much every player in Saskatchewan knows this."
CFL,397hes,Canuckleball,3,Wed Jun 10 00:37:14 2015 UTC,Kind of reminds me of the divide between University of Alberta and the University of Calgary. Alberta as been so inept that some players will leave it after spring camp or after their first year. I've know of a couple of players that left Alberta to play for a junior team that was coming off of a winless year.
CFL,397hes,jmasterdude,2,Wed Jun 10 04:38:21 2015 UTC,We also have junior football after high school which is reasonably popular. The saskatoon hilltops generally have a reasonable following.   It's also popular enough in saskatoon that a city league exists outside of high school football.   Saskatchewan is really the only place in Canada that you can debate whether football is more popular than hockey

CFL,397hes,Doghnov,2,Wed Jun 10 04:54:36 2015 UTC,UofS gets supporters because the field is on campus and they spend an ungodly amount of money on theatrical shit like fireworks. Also the stadium only holds 6000.

CFL,397hes,CaptainHadley,2,Wed Jun 10 04:02:56 2015 UTC,"AUS football is pretty big in the maritimes (considering population) with Mount Allison, StFX, Acadia and SMU. Eastlink broadcasts the majority of the games and AUSTv has online streams as well. The dozen or so games I've been to in the past couple years have had great attendance in the stands.  It's just a shame that all the talent has to go west to find a pro team."

CFL,396ahr,RedDorf,7,Tue Jun 9 15:46:59 2015 UTC,"Honestly I hope streaming the pre-season becomes the norm.  Last nights Ti-Cats/REDBLACKS game was really well done. Video quality was great, audio quality was great (minus some feedback and that horrid national anthem singer).  CFL fans get their pre-season games and the network doesn't have to fill a time slot with something that wont draw a high amount of viewers.   Furthermore they can really test the viability of streaming games through TSN.ca and explore if it'd be profitable to have an online subscription service that runs parallel with the television broadcast.  I, for one, would pay 20$ a month for TSN streaming, I cut the cable years ago and the only thing I miss is HD TSN broadcasts."
CFL,396ahr,Stach37,3,Tue Jun 9 16:18:37 2015 UTC,"It was pretty well done considering the feed was the one they use for the Jumbotron. It'll take a bit more tweaking (ie, better direction, and implementing graphics) but it's a model I'd support."
CFL,396ahr,RaptorsFromSpace,2,Tue Jun 9 21:11:02 2015 UTC,"I found on my PC the stream was jumpy/choppy and some spots repeated the same couple seconds every so often, however on my iPad it looked/streamed great.  I thought the anthem was pretty bad too.  If it was someone not used to singing in front of large crowds nerves play a factor.  Also if they can't hear themselves properly it's hard to carry a tune, usually singers have earpieces to hear themselves over the stadium sounds, right?  Or maybe she just wasn't very good, it is the preseason after all."
CFL,396ahr,omegatron20xx,5,Tue Jun 9 16:57:00 2015 UTC,"I've worked in the music and audio industry for the better part of my adult life so I'll shed some light on what went down with the national anthem singer.   Nerves to a degree, however the girl could not sing in key to save her life. Most performers who have nerve will stay within their dominate range. She ping ponged through different keys (not well I might add).   The way she delivered each bar made no sense, some were too long, others were too short. Almost like she was hesitating at times and rushing at others. That could be explained by the lack of in ear monitors and the stadium reverb.   Lastly no music to help her figure out where she was in the song.   She didn't seem like someone who had any god given talent and more someone with a good connection."
CFL,396ahr,Stach37,3,Tue Jun 9 17:23:18 2015 UTC,That explanation works for me.
CFL,396ahr,omegatron20xx,1 point,Tue Jun 9 19:47:47 2015 UTC,"Personally, I find the whole ""Sportsnet idea"" of having 100 different channels to be stupid. a) 90% of the time, 4 channels show the same show, while perhaps the main feed has something different. RARELY, if ever, have I ever seen even 3/5 channels utilized for different programs. While I don't pretend to know the numbers or ins and outs of doing a TV broadcast, it baffles me why they can't (or wouldn't want to) throw ALL preseason games on TV. ESPECIALLY now given that the CFL is really TSN's only draw."
CFL,396ahr,Premier_Poutine,3,Tue Jun 9 21:52:31 2015 UTC,"The thing with the TSN.ca streaming is that it requires login credentials for your TV service provider.

CFL,395qi9,drpgq,4,Tue Jun 9 14:22:52 2015 UTC,I think Matthews impressed me the most from what I saw of the two. But it's hard to say because it is preseason and it was against Ottawa. Who was also playing the worst defensive game in team history.
CFL,395qi9,RaptorsFromSpace,3,Tue Jun 9 14:29:29 2015 UTC,"It's tough to say right now, and I'd want to wait until the second game to make that call, but if I was pressed right now, I'd go with Matthews. Mind you, I have only seen him in one part if one game, and I have no idea how he is in practices or the locker room, so I would be choosing on a very limited set of info."
CFL,395qi9,darkhorse65,2,Tue Jun 9 13:57:23 2015 UTC,I'd agree with this. All reports out of training camp say that he's been the most accurate with the ball and has shown the best decision making.
CFL,395qi9,AintSingingForCoke,3,Tue Jun 9 14:04:39 2015 UTC,I think we saw all we needed from Captain Fumble Masoli last year. Matthews is likely taking the #2 spot.
CFL,395qi9,CaptainHadley,2,Tue Jun 9 14:22:42 2015 UTC,Masoli is not even close to their level judging by last year.
CFL,395qi9,drpgq,2,Tue Jun 9 15:00:07 2015 UTC,"One other thought I would make about Matthews, does he even get a shot in the CFL if not for his history with Austin? Sports can sometimes come down to luck in terms of getting a chance."

Masoli had a very very tough draw last season. do i think hes a keeper? no definitely not, but the odds werent in his favor going against the CFL's best defense, an the future grey cup champion.  That said, Matthews showed decent mobility and fairly good decision making.  He got absolutely thrashed on a blind side sack on what looks like an overload or missed assignment.  Didnt catch much of Harris, though to be honest, when you read the reports, you dont hear much of him.  Matthews put on the show last night.    So if someone has to go, Masoli.  Just didnt step up in the games that counted last season."

CFL,3921ku,RaptorsFromSpace,2,Mon Jun 8 19:08:58 2015 UTC,Well the Bombers one sucked but the Stamps one was a hit.
CFL,3921ku,CaptainHadley,1 point,Mon Jun 8 19:22:25 2015 UTC,The Stamps one wasn't designed by them.  The club said screw theirs and made their own.  That is why they were the only good ones.
CFL,3921ku,RaptorsFromSpace,1 point,Mon Jun 8 21:21:44 2015 UTC,I can't tell if you're being facetious or not but if that's true then it's good news. That means they'll retain the rights after Reebok is no longer partnered with the CFL and can continue to wear it after this season.
CFL,3921ku,CaptainHadley,1 point,Mon Jun 8 21:31:25 2015 UTC,"I don't know what Facetious means.... So I'm going with no?  But Factious.  Yes, very."

CFL,3921ku,TrapzMcCoy,3,Mon Jun 8 19:25:44 2015 UTC,I beg and plead that they stay far from Adidas. They've done nothing impressive design wise for any pro sports teams but soccer. Their NBA basketball kits are atrocious.
CFL,3921ku,HomerSPC,1 point,Mon Jun 8 20:31:36 2015 UTC,"While the NFL/Nike deal is up in 2019, the CFL could provide a spring board for Adidas and UA to try and bid for that. UA has been wanting to break into pro-level sports, and outside of the NBA Adidas doesn't have much at the pro level in North America. Just a thought though."
CFL,3921ku,Arians_Hat,1 point,Mon Jun 8 20:37:37 2015 UTC,"Its time Under Armour got its oppritunity, Football is where they started. They'll give the CFL image an upgrade and their appeal will be an automatic with minor football across this country which is really where it matters.  Im ok with Nike as well, just not ADIDAS."
CFL,3921ku,RaptorsFromSpace,2,Mon Jun 8 20:49:08 2015 UTC,I am pro-Adidas.
CFL,3921ku,RaptorsFromSpace,2,Mon Jun 8 23:07:29 2015 UTC,"Reebok is a subsidiary of Adidas, so I doubt Adidas makes a run at the CFL partnership.  The company has been shuffling things around lately, so it isn't completely out of the question, I guess."
CFL,3921ku,KamikazeCanuck,1 point,Tue Jun 9 01:41:39 2015 UTC,I bet they do because they're a huge hit.

CFL,38xly2,JasonBourne008,6,Sun Jun 7 20:23:54 2015 UTC,"It would be big news if he got cut. But I suspect people would more likely conclude that Sam sucks, more than the CFL being too good."
CFL,38xly2,DetectiveWood,3,Mon Jun 8 00:35:16 2015 UTC,"Sims was never ""High Profile."" Also, would you expect him to stay when he missed 2 camps already and had to compete against 4-5 other QBs that already know the system?"
CFL,38xly2,DetectiveWood,2,Mon Jun 8 01:00:50 2015 UTC,"I'll be honest with you. I don't know the first thing about the CFL. I think the world of Blake Sims but yeah, coming in that late and they already have a bunch of QBs, he was doomed from the get go. He's a great worker and probably should have been tried at different positions.   I am curious if he was released for ""bad play"" or something else. Seems weird to not play him in a preseason game."
CFL,38xly2,DetectiveWood,3,Mon Jun 8 14:02:47 2015 UTC,The second part is very possible. He has a daughter and his parents are at all of his games. Maybe he didn't want to leave them.

CFL,38wpwa,goboatmen,2,Mon Jun 8 01:18:55 2015 UTC,Great to see!  I hope this new ownership can really turn things around.  The CFL needs a strong Argos team.
CFL,38tuvu,PChopSammies,10,Sat Jun 6 19:46:22 2015 UTC,"Poor McCallum.  Starts his career with the Lions but can't make the team because they're clinging to a declining veteran, Lui Passaglia, for sentimental reasons.  20+ years later, he wants to finish his career in BC, but the team is now run by the least sentimental guy in the league."
CFL,38tuvu,Puttingonthefoil,2,Sat Jun 6 22:27:10 2015 UTC,"I suggest the league should create a ""Legacy Veteran"" designation who doesn't count against the roster. Would need some parameters like being at least a 10 year veteran and a minimum age of 35 (or whatever). The Commissioner could hold a veto if he was of the reasonably held belief that the designation were being misused."
CFL,38tuvu,Derosa6037,12,Sun Jun 7 00:50:09 2015 UTC,Could we get Stegall back.
CFL,38tuvu,CaptainHadley,6,Sun Jun 7 01:28:33 2015 UTC,Tsn is paying him more than we would. He's not coming back.

CFL,38tuvu,CaptainHadley,2,Sun Jun 7 12:36:57 2015 UTC,"McCallum's still good at what he does, but what he does is less and less each year. He can't do kickoffs, punting or field goals beyond 45 yards, which means wherever he plays, they need a strong-leg kicker to back him up."
CFL,38tuvu,OlderThanGif,4,Sun Jun 7 15:01:57 2015 UTC,Didn't want to retire I guess.   My bet is he waits until a team needs a kicker mid-season.
CFL,38tuvu,falsekoala,2,Sat Jun 6 21:21:56 2015 UTC,"Mid-season? Brett Maher blew his knee in training camp, and even at his best was missing was a mediocre place kicker last year.   I want him here in Ottawa for the Rough Riders legacy, sure, but he also seems like a perfect fit for the team, is he not?"
CFL,38tuvu,antonio106,3,Sun Jun 7 13:06:11 2015 UTC,This. We need a fucking kicker.
CFL,38tuvu,Stach37,2,Sun Jun 7 14:08:14 2015 UTC,"He'll be a welcome addition to any team looking for a kicker, that's for sure.   How many games did he play in Ottawa for the Rough Riders?"
CFL,38tuvu,falsekoala,3,Sun Jun 7 14:29:51 2015 UTC,CFL stats says he had 13 place kicks and 15 punts with them in '93. So...not many? Haha.
CFL,38tuvu,antonio106,2,Sun Jun 7 15:12:45 2015 UTC,No disrespect to the man but I wouldn't want to pay his salary either.

Clearly everyone is aware that playing football is riskier than playing chess, nobody is claiming that the players were in the dark about the possibility of getting a concussion when they played.   The question is whether everyone understood the full extent of the risks involved, and I firmly believe that most players were not aware. How dangerous second impact syndrome can be. How many decades you could be shaving off your life by playing as a lineman for a long career.   A lot of players are only learning now about these dangers, and to a large extent this information was ignored by league officials in all football leagues who didn't want to act to protect players if it might decrease the popularity and profitability of their teams. To what (if any) extent the CFL was similarly complicit, I have no idea. I do completely believe that the players have a case however, and they should have their chance to show it."

CFL,38nnqu,tmlrule,1 point,Fri Jun 5 20:24:58 2015 UTC,"If I may, I'd like to throw out two points about the 200 MILLION DOLLAR figure. Both are definite speculation, so take them with a grain of salt, but from someone who followed the NFL lawsuit somewhat closely.  First one is more obvious, I'd wager that $200 million figure was a negotiation tactic to:   get some press scare the league into a better settlement most importantly, get more former players on board - there is strength in numbers, and the more players on board raising a ruckus and providing evidence, the better chance they have.   So I wouldn't take the dollar figure all that seriously.  Secondly, any figure the players win from the league will be paid out very gradually, not a $200 million cheque rolled out after the players win the case. In the NFL case, it basically worked out to a top-up of their pensions, added health benefits and damages given to those who suffer particular head injuries. So even if the $200 million figure somehow stands, it would work out to $3-4 million a year for the next 60 years. Still a lot of money surely, but this might put it in a bit more perspective."

CFL,38banz,jmasterdude,4,Wed Jun 3 02:40:51 2015 UTC,"I think if the CFL had the same rules as NFL it wouldn't be as popular and might not even exist.  NFL has better players, coaches, stadiums, media coverage, etc.  The thing the CFL has going for it is that the rules make for a better game."
CFL,38banz,JLord,2,Wed Jun 3 14:14:05 2015 UTC,"People always use this arguement and I don't understand it. ""Better players"". The only position that may be arguable in is QB. Look at people who have come to the CFL and flopped hard in recent years that thought they were going to tear it up.. Like Chad Johnson."
CFL,38banz,Nexcapto,2,Wed Jun 3 19:59:23 2015 UTC,"You don't understand why people say the NFL has better players?  Probably the simplest way to prove this point is to look at the salaries.  If any CFL player was offered an NFL contract they would sign it immediately as even the minimum NFL salary is significantly higher than the maximum CFL salary.  So to think that the CFL has equal or better players you would have to believe that all NFL scouts and GMs are collectively such bad evaluators of talent that year after year they are collectively missing out on and underrating a pool of about 500 equal or better players that they could be signing for less money to fill out their teams.  Since it is highly unlikely that this is the case, the logical conclusion is that NFL players are better in general than CFL players."
CFL,38banz,JLord,2,Wed Jun 3 20:09:12 2015 UTC,"The CFL field is larger, meaning people that are smaller are more conducive to it. That means huge lineman are not as welcome as athletic ones, and why receivers and dbs can be smaller.   Just because they get paid more does not mean they are better. Some players don't both trying the NFL or entertain offers.   You are implying that every player has tried the NFL at one point or another, which is not the case either.   Also, consider the player that tried the NFL, didn't make it, and then hones their skills in the CFL and just never tries a second time.  Not everyone is fuelled by cash. Some people love the fame and country so they stay. Some don't."
CFL,38banz,Nexcapto,2,Wed Jun 3 20:36:28 2015 UTC,"Some players don't both trying the NFL or entertain offers.    I don't know if you any basis for saying this, but if it is true it is certainly a very small majority would not entertain NFL contract offers.  And I do not know of a single example in the past 20 years where player has turned down an NFL contract in order to play in the CFL.   Just because they get paid more does not mean they are better.   This is true, but as I said, to believe that players in the CFL are equal or better you would have to believe that all NFL teams are terrible evaluators of talent.  This is not a reasonable belief.   The CFL field is larger, meaning people that are smaller are more conducive to it.   Certain types of players are relatively more valuable in the CFL compared to the NFL and vise versa.  But there is no type of player where the better players of that type are playing in the CFL.  You can find more small receivers in the CFL, but the best small receivers are playing in the NFL.   You are implying that every player has tried the NFL at one point or another   No, not at all.  Nothing I said implies this.  If you want additional evidence that players in the NFL are generally better look at the Canadian players.  In the NFL there are no restrictions on nationality and teams might have 1 or 2 Canadian players at most.  So clearly a rule forcing teams to have 20 Canadians is reducing the average talent of CFL teams.  To argue otherwise would be absurd.  You would be saying that having an restriction on roster composition results leads to teams fielding better rosters compared to an unrestricted system.  Or another argument would be to look at the draft.  The NFL drafts players regardless of nationality.  Nobody in the past 20 years has ever been drafted by an NFL team but turned down their contract to play in the CFL.  So every year the top 250 college players are going to NFL teams.  Yet somehow this doesn't result in the NFL having the better players?  It seems impossible for this to be the case.  It would be like taking an NHL team and telling them they are only allowed to sign undrafted players and thinking this will result in a better roster.  It is not a reasonable belief."

I do feel like with the CFL the losing team is not out of it nearly as early. Be it for better or worse, the half time adjustment to me is far more pronounced in the CFL. I find the clock management and time of possession in the NFL leads to a higher percentage drab games (with last year in the CFL being a bit of an exception).  It would be interesting if pudds or some other stats minded person had relative numbers on big yardage gains between the CFL and NFL. Just how big is my confirmation bias."

CFL,38a972,omegatron20xx,3,Tue Jun 2 22:12:36 2015 UTC,"You cannot park at the stadium.  You can park at various places in the neighborhood around the stadium but it is much better to take the train or bus.  If you want to park you need to find a school or something that sells parking or else go far enough away that parking is not restricted and then walk.  If you are not staying by a train or bus stop then you would still probably be better parking by a train station and getting to the game that way.  If you have your ticket in advance then your ticket automatically acts as a bus pass so you don't pay extra for transit.  This is how the vast majority will get to and from the game.  There will be riders fans all over so don't worry about any particular section.  The obstructed view seats are fine and have a thin metal railing to stop people falling over the edge.  It isn't very obstructed at all.  My seats are in that area and it is never a problem.

Usually you can get pretty good value in the form of a free beer or wings or something like that from the bar that is doing the promo.  Check this thread for the bars that provide rides to the game.  It is from last year, but these things usually continue year after year so most of these places would be offering similar promotions this year.  You would have to confirm or course:  http://www.esksfans.com/forum/showthread.php?30857-Non-ETS-Game-Day-Shuttles  But remember the downside to all these promotions is that you are somewhat limited as far as leaving the game early or anything like that.  You are tied to one particular bus which will probably be waiting until after the game is over and everyone has a chance to catch it.  Whereas the ETS buses/trains are leaving all the time."

CFL,387rps,JLangvee,20,Tue Jun 2 13:35:04 2015 UTC,"Hi there! The games are very similar safe for some key distinctions in game play. Firstly, Canadian football follows a 3-down system rather than the NFL's 4. What that means is that each offence is only really afforded 2 shots at moving the ball 10 yards, which results in the CFL being a much more pass-heavy league.   Moreover, defenders in Canadian football are required to line up 1 yard from the line of scrimmage (in the NFL, d-linemen line up right on the line of scrimmage). Another key distinction at the line of scrimmage is the waggle. This tends to be every american receiver's worst nightmare when they first arrive in Canada. The waggle eludes to pre-snap motion of receivers behind the line of scrimmage. In the NFL, receivers must start their routes from a dead-stop. In the CFL, wide receivers and slot-backs are often in motion before the ball is snapped, and do their best to time crossing the line of scrimmage the instant that the ball is snapped from center to quarterback. There are other differences regarding rules and play-clocks, but those become a little more specific for current intents and purposes.  Structurally, the Canadian field is longer and wider than an American field. The NFL field measures 100 yards, end-zone to end-zone with 10-yard deep end-zones. The CFL's field measures 110 yards from end-zone to end-zone (with a neutral center-line at the 55-yard line). The end-zones themselves are 20-yards deep, which again, leads to more passing plays than what is seen in the NFL. Furthermore, the Canadian field is about 15 yards wider than the American field, which manifests in different kinds of receiver routes being drawn up relative to NFL playbooks.  There are other differences for sure, so I'll let others delve into more specifics."

CFL,387rps,Wilibus,4,Tue Jun 2 18:15:10 2015 UTC,"Here are two previous very awesome (in my own humble opinion) comments I've written on similar posts: 1, 2. (Seems I have a penchant for starting off my comments with ""First off,"")  First off, I would definitely recommend using reddit search and going through old threads to find other comments which, while maybe only 90% as awesome as mine, are still awesome.  Canadian football goes back to the mid-19th century. It evolved (slowly) from rugby football. It was influential in creating American football and has also borrowed a lot from American football. Professional football in Canada was fragmented and regional for a while, but in 1958, the CFL was formed as a merger of existing leagues. Since then, Canadian professional football has had a single, nation-wide league.  If you like history, the Toronto Argonauts and Hamilton Tiger-Cats are both very old teams, as far as professional sports teams go. The Argonauts were formed in 1873 as a rowing club. Shortly after, they started playing rugby and then ultimately Canadian football. They hold the North American record for the oldest existing professional sports team still using their original name. The Ti-Cats are a merger of the Hamilton Tigers (est 1883) and Hamilton Wildcats (1941). If you accept their Hamilton Tigers lineage, they're likely one of the oldest existing football clubs around.  If you're in the UK, you're probably screwed for watching games in a usual way. I wouldn't expect games to be broadcast there. My recommendation is to join the game threads here in reddit for each game. There will always be at least a couple online streams posted in each game thread.  Edit: I just realized a lot of the games are going to be starting after midnight in your timezone. I don't envy you, ha."

The battles of Alberta are awesome games against Calgary and any game at Commonwealth against the Riders is epic. Though we tend to win those ones more than the BoA. :P    Really you can't go wrong. The CFL is awesome.

CFL,38cytb,Stach37,9,Wed Jun 3 12:29:45 2015 UTC,This is a terribly researched article.   Sears is not in the NFL. Kohlert is not a newcomer and Cotton was our leading rusher but only if you don't count what Grigsby did early in the year. He also gives no valid reason other than last year's stats as to why the Bombers will be terrible.   The guys been covering the CFL for 43 years. Sounds like that cover is on his TV. I think he should take it off and actually start watching the games.
CFL,38cytb,biga204,7,Wed Jun 3 12:56:18 2015 UTC,"Chris Randle was never our safety last season, it was always Legget (who had a great season). Derek Jones is not a starter at corner, no idea where he got that idea. Fraser is not our starting DT, that goes to Turner and Anderson. And it's pretty much a guarantee that Westerman starts on DE, not Nate Collins. Cotton only had 361 rushing yards, but only started what 3 or 4 games? He performed much better than Grigsby did. No mention of Robert Marve as one of our QB's despite him leading us to victory over Calgary last season (almost twice). This article is complete garbage."

CFL,387zvd,Boxfortsuprise,2,Tue Jun 2 14:36:22 2015 UTC,In the west I would expect the Edm/Cgy rivalry to be a big story.  Last year Calgary won every meeting including playoffs and were the only team Edmonton did not beat.  This year they don't play until labour day.  If you are living in Edmonton you won't want to miss the Calgary game in September.
CFL,387zvd,JLord,1 point,Tue Jun 2 22:36:10 2015 UTC,"Big storylines (in my opinion) are whether or not Travis Lulay can return to form in B.C. after missing virtually two seasons to injury.   Toronto is interesting. Ricky Ray is banged up and aging, but if he can have a good season they will be in the hunt.   For me, I'm thoroughly intrigued in Ottawa. They only won two games last season but went a little crazy with spending in the off season and completely revamped their roster. I'm interested to see if they can push for a playoff spot in the East. Not going to be easy."
CFL,387zvd,shawnwsmith,2,Tue Jun 2 14:38:43 2015 UTC,"Ottawa could definitely see a huge change.   I'm a little confused about all the hate Burris seems to be getting though. Hear a lot of ""Ottawa will be shit as long as Burris is QB."" He went from leading a Grey Cup contender team in 2013 to having receivers that dropped almost every pass in 2014, not really his fault. With actual talented receivers I bet things will be much different this year.  Maybe someone can enlighten me as to why he's seen as washed up now."
CFL,387zvd,FondleOtter,3,Tue Jun 2 14:52:40 2015 UTC,"I think it's his age more than anything. He's still a good QB, I don't think he's quite 'elite' anymore. He'll be surrounded with arguably the best receiving core in the league this year, so it's possible he'll prove me wrong. If the offensive line can give him time, Ottawa will be a lot of fun to watch this season."
CFL,387zvd,shawnwsmith,1 point,Tue Jun 2 15:20:37 2015 UTC,"Edmonton is fine without Ray who was injured.  They have Reilly who us in the top half of QBs.  Ray is comming off an injury expected to play the beginning of the season.  Winnipeg is getting better, they had an amazing off season.  Lots of hope.  No Swaggerville.  Thank god.  Eskimos have a perpetual second place curse I predict.  Hamilton lost 2 grey cups in a row, see 90s bills.  Calgary us damn good.  Ottawa is new and trying to build.  Sask had Durant injured.  BC has bad coaching changes.  Lulay hasnt played more than 2 plays in over a year.  Montreal got Micheal Sam, I think as long as they do well with passing they can win the east."
CFL,387zvd,CaptainHadley,2,Tue Jun 2 15:09:52 2015 UTC,"I'm really intrigued to see if Winnipeg can break through this season. They've got a lot of talent, but it's going to be hard to get through Edmonton/Calgary.   I'm in Hamilton, so it hurts my heart to admit you're right about the Alouettes. I think with that defense, there's a good chance they take the East as long as Crompton is as good as we think he is."

CFL,387zvd,drpgq,2,Tue Jun 2 17:34:29 2015 UTC,I think it kind of comes down to the fact that he was the QB who they started when they started to turn things around.  I don't think he really was much of a catalyst to that though.

There are more then plenty of options for Riders fans to get merch around town, they don't need their own store. Opening one would be a slap in the face to the Stampeders and Stamp fans.

CFL,386lly,dotCeh,1 point,Tue Jun 2 12:41:34 2015 UTC,"From a business standpoint, opening a Stamps store in the Green province is just throwing money away.  On the reverse, a Riders store in Calgary is a goldmine.  tl;dr Come at us, Calgary.  <3"
CFL,386lly,HomerSPC,1 point,Tue Jun 2 14:06:15 2015 UTC,"I would imagine that teams have ""territorial rights"" to prevent setting up these type of shops in another teams region.

Probably why you don't see Maple Leafs/Canadien's stores outside of TO (Ontario?) and Quebec."
CFL,386lly,ponimaju,2,Tue Jun 2 14:55:12 2015 UTC,"It's probably the league.  When you buy any merch a third-party retailer, the entire league splits the profits.  When you buy at a first party store (e.g. The Rider Store), the team gets 100% of the revenue.  The Riders are like 3rd in Merch sales in Canada (behind the Leafs and Habs) -- That would be a lot of money the league is missing out on if there were Rider Stores everywhere.  Although I'm fine with it.  We have to pay for our new stadium somehow :P  Edit: Non-serious thought; Let's build Rider stores on all the major highways coming into the Province.

If it requires some politicking and demonstrations to block the building of the store, not only will it be nationwide news (not just in the sports section) and become basically free advertising for the brand, but it will be a testament to how salty Calgary fans can be.

CFL,384axi,JasonBourne008,1 point,Mon Jun 1 22:23:23 2015 UTC,I get why tsn doesn't do a legit fantasy game. Because fantasy is all about offense and their simply isn't enough offensive players to have a competitive league. Unless you have so many rules that it makes things more complicated then the average person has time or patience for. Like what would be the rules? If you take Cornish number 1 (who wouldn't?) Would that mean you can't have another rb that was named starter at the beginning of the season?
CFL,384axi,woodsbre,1 point,Tue Jun 2 04:43:43 2015 UTC,"It is a challenge, you're right about that.  We put roster limits on certain positions - no player can more than one QB, RB or Kicker, except if your regular guy is on bye.  Fantaseh handles the QB byes automatically, but we manage the other 2 positions manually, by having the manager who's player is on bye make a post in the forum stating that they are dropping RB X because he's on bye, not just because they are dropping him.  If that post exists, then the RB is considered reserved until after the bye.  It's a bit more complicated than an NFL league, but it's still pretty easy."

CFL,382bwu,chemicalxv,3,Mon Jun 1 13:00:30 2015 UTC,"I think the reason they suspend rather then releasing them is so that the player doesn't just become a FA and then sign elsewhere. This ensures they either retire, show up, or sit out the year and stops players from using this as some tactic to get released. I have no idea if this is why for sure but that's why I would do it."

The only thing that's changed is our O line and Huff is such a genius at drafting and scouting that I don't think it'll be an issue.

CFL,37mw86,b3hr,3,Fri May 29 03:46:34 2015 UTC,There was nothing better then switching to the Worlds and hearing beyak after listening to Randorf and num nutz shit on the Jets in the first round. Thank god I was at game 3 and didn't have to listen to that shit. Didn't mind him as a host of CFL on TSN but we benefit from his departure CFL broadcast wise with Rod Smith being the new host

An empty stadium + low quality football (the players on the field are being evaluated and most times cut) doesn't make for good TV product. Not to mention viewership for pre-season games is low, which brings advertiser money into play - but that's a whole other topic.   If you look at the schedule 2 of the 3 games have some sort of potential draw. Saskatchewan (no explination there) playing Edmonton in Fort McMurray, which has been hyped up for awhile and more than likely sold out (correct me if I'm wrong).  The next is Toronto at Montréal, ie Michael Sam's first game. There's going to be plenty new viewers, casual viewers, and American viewers watching that game to see how he performs.

CFL,37i1gt,ponimaju,-1,Wed May 27 23:49:37 2015 UTC,"edit: This is a statement in general on the conflict, obviously not addressing the picture itself  You're missing the point entirely if you think that not making it news will help to normalize it - society has to come to the point on its own where an openly gay pro athlete is not out of the ordinary and not newsworthy at all - you can't just say ""I'm sick of hearing about it, isn't making a big deal of this the opposite of what should be happening if we want him to feel accepted?"" which it what it seems like some of the subreddit wants to believe.  It's probably more of a big deal in a sport like football where a lot of the players are either African American or from Southern/Midwest states (and are therefore more likely to be religious and against homosexuality simply because of their upbringing).  Obviously his play will have to speak for itself."

CFL,37i1gt,calgary3200,2,Wed May 27 23:47:28 2015 UTC,This is one of my favourite comments that I have read.
CFL,37h655,Stach37,17,Wed May 27 16:33:35 2015 UTC,I for one am already tired of this hype train.
CFL,37h655,RaptorsFromSpace,-7,Wed May 27 17:09:10 2015 UTC,"Did you have to quit playing football less than four years ago (like me) because you were a target of taunts from a teammate because of who you were with? Did you ever face comments that made you unhappy enough that you hated the sport that you once loved? Do you understand how many people never will watch or play sports again because  they weren't strong enough to overcome homophobia? If you knew what it was like, I think you would have more empathy. This may be the most historic event of my life and it is helping positively impact current and future generations. Michael Sam is changing the way people think. I hope this doesn't offend you but I'm going to celebrate every game he plays because I never thought we would see a player like this."
CFL,37h655,calgary3200,22,Wed May 27 19:00:12 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry you had to go through those things but making a big deal out of someone's sexuality is exactly the issue. It's great that he's out and playing professional football but have you ever stopped to think that maybe all this media attention isn't such a great thing for the cause? Maybe seeing Sam in the spotlight and making such a big deal about it has deterred other players from making the same step.   He'a gay, that's great good for him, but at this point we haven't even seen him on the field and people are going around saying he's going to be the DPOY and ROY. The hype is not justifiable.  It may be historical for you and I'm really happy that it's happening for you, but he himself said in this very article that he just wants to play ball, not do anything historic."
CFL,37h655,RaptorsFromSpace,-1,Wed May 27 19:25:09 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry if I offend you but I think you are unfair to him. You're one of my favourite people on reddit but your opinions hurt a lot because it feels like you don't know what it's like being disrespected for being different than others. It feels like you don't care about anyone else other than people that are like you. This is a huge deal because it promotes diversity. Isn't that why most of us love Canada? This is much more than a gay vs straight issue. This is is about allowing every athlete in Canada to focus on their sport and have less fear of being discriminated against. If the media ignored Michael Sam, it would be a slap in the face to many people like me because it would send a strong message that the best way to overcome disparaging comments is to bottle them up and not talk about them. Many of us don't know how he will do but it would be nice for you to at least give him a chance and try to understand how lucky we are to finally see this happen. Let's enjoy these moments together because this may never happen again."
CFL,37h655,calgary3200,2,Thu May 28 18:07:14 2015 UTC,"How dare you say that I don't care about other people who aren't like me. How dare you think that because I haven't been discriminated against in the way that you have that I haven't been discriminated. I've been bullied my whole life and these assumptions of yours make me think that you don't care about people who aren't like you. You have an uncanny ability to assume and put words in my mouth. I never once said that I didn't want him to succeed or that the media should ignore him. What I did say is that the media is blowing the issue out of proportion. They're turning out article after article on him and they over saturating the issue. It's getting to a point where people aren't going to care at all which will completely negate everything that Sam has worked for.   I've been one of your biggest defenders on this subreddit, and today you not only offended me but you hurt me."
CFL,37h655,RaptorsFromSpace,1 point,Thu May 28 18:53:53 2015 UTC,"If you are offended, I'm very sorry. As you know, I would never try to hurt you or anyone else. I care about what you think and how others feel. You are one of my favourite people on Reddit because you're a Stamps fan and share your love of the CFL. Sadly, I may have misinterpreted your comment but it was my opinion that ignoring Michael Sam or diminishing how important this is would be a slap in the face to everyone that supports diversity. If you were bullied, then Michael Sam is one of the best role models you could ever have. He recently had a talk in Calgary about trying to get rid of bullying.   Again, I'm very sorry if I misinterpreted your comment. This is a sensitive topic but I hope you will forgive me if I made a mistake. It may take time to forgive me but I hope you know that I would never be mean to anyone."
CFL,37h655,calgary3200,-5,Thu May 28 19:16:29 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry you had to go through those things but making a big deal out of someone's sexuality is exactly the issue.    Like I said in another thread, society has to naturally come to the point where a gay pro athlete isn't newsworthy and it's just another day at the office, so to speak.  People are sick of hearing about it now and think that if they just did away with the articles right now it would help normalize the idea of a gay athlete, but it won't."

CFL,37h655,RaptorsFromSpace,1 point,Thu May 28 00:37:46 2015 UTC,I am an American and I like the CFL.  I wish it had better broadcast coverage.  I am from Tampa Bay area and a Bucs and Storm season tix holder.  I love football.  I like the Stampeders cause their logo is similar to the USFL Bandits.
CFL,37h655,mollarirulz,1 point,Thu May 28 13:28:12 2015 UTC,I didn't mean to come across as xenophobic. What meant to say is that we shouldn't care whether or not American's like the game or not because it's part of our history and uniquely Canadian. We of course welcome American fans with open arms.
CFL,37h655,RaptorsFromSpace,1 point,Thu May 28 15:47:20 2015 UTC,"I understand.  I am fine with CFL being unique and seperate from the NFL style.  There will always be a segment of Americans that will not accept (as in watch it) the CFL.  I do think there is an opportunity to market yhe game to Americans.  For instance the CFL reg season starts almost 3 months sooner than the NFL.  The CFL does other days other than Sundays.  I would argue that you should care, because more fans is more money , through tv viewrship.  I would not change anything about the game, but i would change how the CFL markets to Americans. Edit: misspellings"
CFL,37h655,mollarirulz,-1,Thu May 28 17:55:05 2015 UTC,How would you feel if the NFL said that their league was just for Americans? I'm sorry but that would offend me. We must get along with others and disrespecting what others think about the CFL is not a good way to get more fans.
CFL,37h655,calgary3200,2,Thu May 28 18:22:06 2015 UTC,"Did you even read what I said? At no point did I say the CFL was just for Canadians. I said that we shouldn't have to cater to Americans because this league is uniquely Canadian. By all means we should have American fans, and encourage growing who watches the CFL, but we shouldn't have to be afraid of changes because we're afraid of what Americans might think."
CFL,37h655,RaptorsFromSpace,0,Thu May 28 18:34:27 2015 UTC,Yes. You said you didn't care if others liked the CFL. I don't think the CFL should change every rule the fans want but they should care enough to listen even if they don't live in Canada.

CFL,37h68j,ClassicMach,1 point,Thu May 28 06:22:48 2015 UTC,I have a really good feeling about this guy. I think he will succeed Ricky Ray in Toronto. If Ray goes down with another serious injury this season I think Sims will step in and dominate. He seems built for the Canadian game.
CFL,37h5wk,Stach37,0,Wed May 27 16:31:45 2015 UTC,"It is and isn't. Why the fuck is such a talented athlete not on an NFL roster? All-American honors and also won SEC (one of the top three college football conferences, and arguably the best of the last five years). We let the best, an All-American, slip to Canada this is not a moment to be proud. Be happy for Michael Sam of course, but it shouldn't take an excellent American player a Passport to follow his dreams. And you can't tell me Jacksonville or the Bills sorry asses couldn't have used an All-American added to their roster."
CFL,37h5wk,unclefunkjr,7,Wed May 27 17:48:46 2015 UTC,"As mysticsavage said he's slow, and for the NFL he's undersized.  In the SEC he could get away with his size and speed but I'm quite positive it wouldn't fly in the NFL, and as 2 different teams have shown, it didn't.    With that being said, I think he has the potential to have a great CFL career.  His intangibles can make up for his slight lack of speed and he's not undersized in our league.  I hope he finds success in our league, but really wish people would just start talking about football instead of his sexuality."
CFL,37h5wk,Mannbearpiggg,5,Wed May 27 19:36:55 2015 UTC,5 second 40 speed.
CFL,37h5wk,mysticsavage,2,Wed May 27 18:15:03 2015 UTC,"Results on the field should matter more. If you want to only look at combine results, we shouldn't play the games."
CFL,37h5wk,calgary3200,4,Wed May 27 19:01:19 2015 UTC,Results on field aren't good either.  Except in Garbage time preseason.
CFL,37h5wk,CaptainHadley,2,Wed May 27 22:41:56 2015 UTC,"His results were very good. It wasn't his fault that he only got the chance to play during ""garbage"" time."
CFL,37h5wk,calgary3200,2,Thu May 28 18:34:19 2015 UTC,Yeah they didnt a need DE.  Other teams he would get more of a chance.
CFL,37h5wk,CaptainHadley,3,Thu May 28 18:56:27 2015 UTC,The NFL's never really been the league for that. They're obsessed with metrics down there. Remember when Doug Flutie was too short to be a quarterback?
CFL,37h5wk,OlderThanGif,2,Wed May 27 22:44:09 2015 UTC,"Why did Russell Wilson get a chance to play but Michael Sam didn't? Both were very good college players but didn't have the ""metrics"" that they the NFL is ""obsessed"" with.   Let's hope that Michael Sam will finally get a chance to show how good he is in the CFL."
CFL,37h5wk,calgary3200,1 point,Thu May 28 18:38:07 2015 UTC,"Honestly, this is why the NFL is the most scandal prone league. Character does not have the same quantifiable traits as measurable(s) and field performance. Nobody has hinted at the real reason Michael Sam, an all American, SEC defensive player of the year as a senior was drafted in the 7th round like 149th +- 3. So I will be the first. Teams did not want Michael Sam in their locker room, or the media attention having the first openly gay ""active"" athlete comes with in a major sports league.   People are saying he was undersized as a reason why this kid fell so far in the draft. You are being dishonest if you say there were not other prospects who were undersized, or had character red flags, who were taken earlier in the draft. This was clearly open discrimination, a talented player who recorded a number of sacks in a Ram's uniform in his rookie year, gets passed on by teams who could have used in services."
CFL,37h5wk,unclefunkjr,-2,Thu May 28 22:02:45 2015 UTC,"Don't feed me that garbage, he should be an NFL player period. He may not be he prototypical Defensive end, in terms of size and speed. Which the difference is minimal to be honest, unless you compare him to other defensive ends like genetic freak Clowney and then everybody starts too look bad. He got the job done! In the best league, and people doubt him. Russell Wilson was another college star to have crazy numbers (had some 100 plus passes without an interception at one point), undersized, and is now an NFL champion. When did production and character become meaningless compared to potential."
CFL,37h5wk,unclefunkjr,2,Wed May 27 20:43:35 2015 UTC,"He has always been regarded as a fringe talent at best. I think everyone was rooting for him to make it in the NFL because of what he represented, but the truth is he simply isn't good enough. Hopefully he can find success in the CFL."
CFL,37h5wk,doug_brownies,1 point,Thu May 28 02:07:21 2015 UTC,"He gets since actual gametime experience in a league with a higher level of play than the NCAA. If he does good, he'll make it back to the NFL, but for now no one there is giving him a chance and he's going to the one place left where he can prove himself. I don't see why you're so upset."
CFL,37h7og,Stach37,5,Wed May 27 16:44:34 2015 UTC,Wow. We are so lucky to have him.
CFL,37h7og,calgary3200,4,Wed May 27 19:11:27 2015 UTC,I really believe he will go down as one of the all time greats in league history

CFL,37h5tc,calgary3200,1 point,Wed May 27 19:07:18 2015 UTC,The only rule I'm uncertain about the converts.  I see where they're coming from trying to make converts more exciting but this seems like too radical of an approach.
CFL,37h5tc,doodleface,1 point,Thu May 28 04:42:40 2015 UTC,The one thing that stood out to me was the decision to bring 2 point conversions closer along with the longer 1 point conversions. Why change in both directions? Moving the kicks out brings enough uncertainty as it is.  I feel like they changed too much too fast. I just hope I get proven wrong.

CFL,36z4l3,jdchambo,3,Sun May 24 15:03:08 2015 UTC,"He's not unskilled, he's just nothing special either. At his draft combine he was mediocre at best, and spent more time talking at press conferences about how brave he considers himself to be. At his recent vet combine, people were calling him 'flat out horrible'. The guy doesn't seem to try, he's slow, and nothing really worthy of making a team. If you ever listen to some of his interviews, you'll realize he thinks he's hot shit, but doesn't really have anything to back it up. When you say things like ""other gay nfl players have reached out to me. I won't say who they are because they aren't as brave as I am to come out"" you also start sounding like a self-centred idiot. His attitude doesn't seem like it's in the right place, if he genuinely deserved that award, then he has changed quite a lot in a small amount of time ."

Why is it news (and on the frontpage of Reddit, no less) that Ireland just became the first country in the world to legalize gay marriage by popular vote?  Surely you don't need that one explained."
CFL,36z4l3,ponimaju,3,Sun May 24 01:40:26 2015 UTC,Honestly no I don't see why that's fascinating news either.  Is it an unexpected result?  No.  Do other countries have legal gay marriage?  Yes.  So its only unique in that it was by popular vote?  Well OK.  Maybe it'll be news when Saudi Arabia legalizes it but until then its become the norm not the exception.  Its like a news article saying McDonalds sold a million hamburgers.  No shit.

Maybe it will be news when a country which punishes homosexuality with fines, jail time and sometimes the death penalty legalizes gay marriage?  It's always news because some of the biggest and most powerful nations in the world still have puritan ideas about people's private lives (USA and Russia are chief among them).  If they actually ended slavery in Mauritania (technically abolished in 1981, but nothing is done to stop the practice), would you say ""pssh, the United States did that more than 150 years ago!""?"
CFL,36z4l3,ponimaju,2,Sun May 24 15:20:02 2015 UTC,"You know what I meant.    Abolishing slavery and getting married are hardly the same thing. One is a lifetime of pain and torment the other is slavery.  And yeah, nobody gives a shit about Mauritania."

CFL,36vrm3,Stach37,21,Fri May 22 19:55:37 2015 UTC,"Because I drop my opinion like I drop mad rhymes (I'm a straight thug if ya'll didn't know) here's my take on Michael Sam coming to the Als.  This first and foremost is a huge marketing opportunity for Als in arguably the city in Canada with the biggest LGBT population. With the pundants debating back and forth whether Sam's sexual orientation was the reason that he doesn't play in the NFL, Montréal and the CFL can use this to bolster the leagues tolerance and desire to push for equality (EDIT: Yup I was right, Commissioner Orridge is already pushing the CFL tolerance and equality angle!, the Argos too, and Jim Popp). Furthermore, this could really open up a new niche market for attendees at the Alouettes games, driving gate revenue and helping the team have potentially more sellouts (there attendance numbers were down significantly last season). I bet $20.00 we'll see an LGBT Rainbow flag with the Alouettes monogram in the middle during at least one game. In THIS link you can see all the LGBT holidays that take place during the CFL season that the league and the Als could very easily make a push for with Sam as their figurehead.  Now orientation aside, the Als just got an unbelievable rush-end that could possibly play Linebacker. Michael Sam is an absolute animal and once he learns the game will probably be an amazing impact player. His first season I expect him to make his mark on special teams racking up some incredible tackles before either being slotted in a start position late in the season or winning the spot out of camp next season.  In conclusion, HOW IN THE MOTHERFUCK DOES MONTRÉAL KEEP LANDING ALL THESE HIGH PROFILE PLAYERS."
CFL,36vrm3,Hero_of_Brandon,10,Fri May 22 15:07:26 2015 UTC,"They reached out to him as soon as he was drafted in the NFL saying if he doesn't get a contract in the NFL that they want him in Montreal.  I just hope that his sexual orientation doesn't become a sideshow. I can already see one of those tacky emotional pieces from TSN like they did for poor John Chick who has seven kid and life is so hard playing the game he loves for a living.  For the scope of TSN and the CFL, he's a football player first and formost and should be talked about and treated as such."
CFL,36vrm3,chemicalxv,4,Fri May 22 16:51:54 2015 UTC,"Too late, they've already compared him to Jackie Robinson"
CFL,36vrm3,faizimam,9,Fri May 22 17:02:22 2015 UTC,"Well, Jackie did get his start in Montreal as well, so it's not baseless."
CFL,36vrm3,chemicalxv,7,Fri May 22 18:45:27 2015 UTC,"It's baseless because outside of being a ""first"" (and he's already played in NFL preseason games, let's be real here that's way beyond any opportunity Robinson had been given) their situations really aren't comparable.  Robinson faced discrimination on levels the likes of which Sam has never seen (dude was literally prevented from playing in some places) not to mention the whole ""Color Line"" in baseball was a real (and known) thing."
CFL,36vrm3,ponimaju,5,Fri May 22 19:40:39 2015 UTC,"This is exactly the kind of thinking that reinforces the hypocritical bias against homosexuals in the African American community, despite the civil rights struggles their ancestors faced, and the racism they often still encounter today."
CFL,36vrm3,calgary3200,4,Fri May 22 23:07:46 2015 UTC,"Sadly, Michael Sam has faced discrimination and will continue to face discrimination for the rest of his life. Did you know that he can't get married where he grew up? Or that it is a crime to be LGBT in over 1/3 of countries and a person can be punished to death because they are gay in seven countries? Michael Sam has faced homophobic comments from his father, other players, and even a former NFL head coach. He may not have faced what Jackie Robinson did but it doesn't diminish what he has overcome. Unless you were bullied as a kid because you were gay, it is difficult to comprehend how big of a deal this is. Gay kids in Canada and the rest of the world finally have a football player like them that they can look up to!"
CFL,36vrm3,CaptainHadley,-3,Fri May 22 22:01:59 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah? And I've faced insulting comments and discrimination cause I'm bad at stuff.  People face that for being fat, people face that for being ugly.  I'd trade spots with him in a heartbeat."

The guy was SEC defensive player of the year, it's not like he's not performed. So what if he couldn't cut it in the NFL, neither could a lot of guys in the CFL, doesn't mean they're not talented enough to play in our league."
CFL,36vrm3,skippy2893,7,Fri May 22 16:51:40 2015 UTC,"He's really slow and weak for a defensive lineman at the pro level, but he matched up well against college tackles. People mentioning it's only a publicity stunt should also mention these things so they don't look so ignorant, but it's a valid opinion. I think he has a lot of either speed or strength training to do to fit in well but luckily for him CFL offensive tackles are about par with top college tackles so he can pull it off. People just see a slow edge rusher and think ""well he must be really strong"" then when they find out he's really weak it's a big red flag."
CFL,36vrm3,solid_vegas,2,Fri May 22 17:27:25 2015 UTC,"I agree that his combine stats are eyebrow raising, but it's not like there's nothing there; plus he improved on nearly everything at his pro day workout.  Would it be this big news if he wasn't gay? Of course not, but I don't think people would be ringing the ""talentless"" bell either; they would be more likely to just say ""let's wait and see""."

CFL,36vrm3,GodTuukka,3,Fri May 22 19:22:52 2015 UTC,"Not directly about the signing and kind of a Canadian inferiority complex sort of point but I've found it really interesting to see the American reaction to the signing.   Up until recently it felt like the reaction from down south to Americans who couldn't crack an NFL roster signing with a CFL team was ""lol have fun at the career graveyard"" with maybe an occasional refrence to Doug Flutie and Warren Moon.   Now it seems mostly positive.  I think the CFL is now being looked at more and more as a good development league. There's a growing number of CFL products going to the NFL and actually contributing in meaningful ways. The league isn't just seen anymore as those wackos to the north that can't figure out the rules."
CFL,36vrm3,Stach37,3,Fri May 22 23:59:25 2015 UTC,"I think Bill Parcels changed the opinion on the CFL with his signing of Cam Wake.

Kinda sucks for us as fans, but i'm always proud of CFL boys making the jump."
CFL,36vrm3,ponimaju,3,Sat May 23 04:31:15 2015 UTC,"I think at the end of the day, the product both sides of the border is increasing dramatically in value. The talent is coming to the point where the NFL is noticing the CIS and seeing the usefulness of having the CFL as a pseudo professional developmental league unlike the NCAA where the players are untested against pro-level players. This idea also lends credence to the fact that the NFL will probably never put a team in Canada in fear of destroying its free farm system.  Does it suck for us fans, yes, we'll lose some great players. But we will also see the level of play increase along with better talent being developed locally and better talent being shuttled in from the NCAA schools.   Now if the CIS could get their collective shits together and start funding football properly and broadcasting it properly we could see a great football uprising in Canada. But I'm a dreamer."
CFL,36vrm3,falsekoala,0,Sat May 23 11:22:48 2015 UTC,"Not directly about the signing and kind of a Canadian inferiority complex sort of point but I've found it really interesting to see the American reaction to the signing.   It's still there though - in reading through the comments on the ESPN posting, most of the comments are in two similar categories:  ""this wouldn't be a story if he weren't gay""/""what other 7th rounders get an article every time they make a roster move?"" or something derisive of the talent level in the CFL.  I don't get surprised anymore because there are plenty of people even in SK that constantly trash the CFL because they prefer the NFL."
CFL,36vrm3,Tigrafr,3,Sat May 23 15:25:30 2015 UTC,I acknowledge that he's the first openly gay NFL/CFL player. I respect that.  But all a football fan should care about is if he can play. Sexuality has nothing to do with this factor.

CFL,36vxll,canadiancreed,2,Fri May 22 20:06:16 2015 UTC,Always found it odd that a team would be named after an American regiment. Guess Teddy was REALLY popular....or Canadians didn't like the Spainards being in Cuba either.

CFL,36v31v,OdetoPoutine,5,Fri May 22 19:59:40 2015 UTC,The failure of Bills in Toronto pretty well confirmed all of the NFL's fears about considering a team in Canada.
CFL,36v31v,spartiecat,6,Fri May 22 12:26:35 2015 UTC,I don't believe this can be considered a real comparison as no one is going to get strongly behind a team that isn't ours. I love the CFL and I believe that an NFL team in Toronto could co-exist with the Argos.
CFL,36v31v,TheHeroRedditKneads,4,Fri May 22 15:47:09 2015 UTC,"Combine that with the horrible venue that is Rogers Center. Bad atmosphere, no tailgating (huge no no for me) and high ticket prices, it was a recipe for failure."

CFL,36v31v,BATKINSON001,2,Sat May 23 04:51:46 2015 UTC,"I mean, the Bills were charging the highest prices in the NFL (other than the Cowboys towards the end) in an out-of-home city for a bad to mediocre team in a bad stadium, repeatedly. It's not a shock that the games werent full, and they were still relatively well attended in any event"
CFL,36v31v,Jeffler,1 point,Fri May 22 19:58:00 2015 UTC,that's because they were papered to make them look full for the tv cameras.
CFL,36v31v,BATKINSON001,2,Sat May 23 04:47:40 2015 UTC,"It is not a fair comparison to hold a potential NFL club up against the Argos. An NFL club would absolutely be successful in Toronto and would likely receive support from fans in the rest of the country, similar to the Blue Jays. The Buffalo games were not successful because it was not Toronto's team, it was Buffalo's team playing a game in Toronto. I doubt the Argos would do well if an NFL club came to Toronto, and perhaps a move to Atlantic Canada or Quebec City would be in order."
CFL,36v31v,tmcroissant,2,Fri May 22 16:57:26 2015 UTC,"I agree it would be successful. I went to a couple of the Bills series games, and I've been to a bunch of games in Buffalo as well. The experience in TO was terrible in comparison for a number of reasons - no tailgating (a huge blow given how great that is in Buffalo), the Dome isn't ideal for football, ridiculously expensive tickets (only ever went because I or a friend got tickets through work) and the stadium itself was a divided fanbase - not every football fan in Toronto is a Bills fan, so there was no home crowd atmosphere. Give this city its own team, build them a stadium and put it somewhere that could allow a tailgate zone (like Downsivew Park, which has ample space) and it would do very well!  I feel like the Argos could survive alongside the NFL though, because while the CFL fanbase is Toronto is small, it's a dedicated bunch. It's what's great about them, they support their team well even if many others in town won't. Sadly the team doesn't get bandwagon fans the way the Leafs, Raptors, Jays, even TFC gets bandwagon fans - doesn't make sense, but it is what I've noticed. But anyways that dedicated core SHOULD still be able to sustain the team, if given the chance. Whether it happens or not is another question, but I feel the two could coexist."
CFL,36v31v,radi81,2,Mon May 25 16:13:19 2015 UTC,"I dunno  I mean, I agree with you about the Argos.  Even when you have the Argos actually playing good football (ignore the last few...) , you'll still have people driving for 2-3 hours to watch the Bills be over-rated...so an NFL fan base can be said to be here...  BUT   That same fan base refused to support the Bills Toronto clusterf*ck the Skydome has repeatedly been shown to be incapable of being the stadium the NFL requires any NFL team here would be up against the Laffs Leafs for media coverage, fans, etc...have fun with that Toronto fans are really fickle, so the first year or so, yeah...great success, but after that the team would need to field an offense as high output as Denver, a defense as dominant as Seattle or Houston and go 21-1 in a 16 game season while going deep into the playoffs each year and winning every other Super Bowl - okay, this might be a slight exaggeration and then, of course, you'd have the corporations buying up all the good season's tickets and driving up the prices, making it impossible to afford to actually go to a game- like with the Leafs - and you're back to the life sucking cavern that is Rogers Centre destroying the experience"

CFL,36sk4p,Stach37,2,Fri May 22 02:56:06 2015 UTC,So I know this is a good thing but I guess it isn't the ideal perfect scenario right?  Wouldn't MLSE have been better because it would have been cross promoted with every other sport in TO?
CFL,36sk4p,FondleOtter,4,Thu May 21 22:14:49 2015 UTC,I originally hoped for MLSE ownership however Rogers has made that absolutely impossible. For whatever reason that company wants to see the CFL's demise.

CFL,36sk4p,jdchambo,4,Fri May 22 00:23:55 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure that reason has to do with wanting an NFL team in Toronto. They were the partners in the Bills Toronto series after all.

CFL,36taoj,Premier_Poutine,2,Fri May 22 03:11:42 2015 UTC,"The thing with Regina, and bring on the downvotes, is it really isn't a big enough city to host a national event like this (too often).

Plus isn't Moose Jaw not too far away?  Long story short, I get the concern, but I'd still give them their turn in the queue.

CFL,36taoj,Premier_Poutine,1 point,Thu May 21 23:11:45 2015 UTC,"One of the few things I do not like about the wave of new stadium in the CFL is that so many of them have reduced seating for the Grey Cup simply due to their regular size. TD, Tim Horton's, IGF, Mosaic and now BMO will all seat about 40,000 for the big game, which to me just doesn't have the same atmosphere as 50,000+. I wish they host it in Rogers Centre for that reason alone; if you want to change the perception of the team, having the championship in the main stadium is huge.   But then Rogers happened I suppose."

For the past decade they've essentially been blowing in the wind with no real owner caring about the team. What I don't agree with is the fact that the Argos get zero respect. Which is absolutely ridiculous. Just on the sheer stature of them being the oldest professional sports franchise in North America should garner them some respect in the Toronto landscape.   Regardless, I have hopes that this new ownership group will do nothing but good for the Argos and the CFL"

They should start using the slogan 'established in 1873' as a prominent feature in their marketing, there's something about heritage that gathers people to the cause... when the riders did their '100 years of pride' campaign a few years ago it was a massive success. And that's what the CFL does best, even more so than the NHL.. the sense of heritage tied to the game is unmatched.

CFL,36od5z,GodTuukka,3,Fri May 22 01:43:30 2015 UTC,Ticats fan here who loves to hate the Argos and I am personally very happy they are getting this new opportunity. The CFL needs the Argos. Foley is 100% correct and signing a coach for $50 million is only going to generate more unrealistic expectations for a team that is lacking talent and heart.
CFL,36od5z,friarcanuck,2,Thu May 21 04:59:25 2015 UTC,"Uh, he realizes MLSE now owns the Argos AND Leafs, right?  In fact, i'm fairly sure MLSE planned it like that. Everyone flpping shit looking for the lastest on babwatch all flipped to TSN to find an Argos press conference. Got a few more eyes on it than they normally did.  I find it strange the Babcock news was not officially confirmed until AFTER the Argo conference."
CFL,36od5z,Girthworthy,3,Thu May 21 07:59:40 2015 UTC,It's not MLSE buying the Argos. It's only Bell and an ownership group that includes MLSE's former CEO.  MSLE is owned by Bell and Rogers.

After 3 NFL games and EPL (I believe), the pitch in London did show very noticeable signs of disrepair.   However, that stadium is netorious for having issues when it comes to the quality of grass after heavy usage, and they mentioned that the new grass being installed at BMO will be stronger, but it hasn't been used before in the way that it will be used at BMO. It's still just ideas.  I think its to early for anyone to say that the field will be ruined, or wont be. Won't know until the end of 2016."

But that doesn't change the fact that the Argos are a mismanaged shit-show, perpetually in a state of bankruptcy.   Look; let me extend an olive branch because I'm feeling good right now (Leafs signed Babcock). For the record, I just responded to the TFC bashing in here, that's all. I didn't instigate it.   Look, no one wants the CFL or the Argos to disappear. We just wanted the Argos to clean up their own backyard and get their own stadium. Hell, I was even willing to have my 416 tax dollars contribute to that.   Now, having said that, the deal is done and we have to move forward. I think TFC fans won't have any issue with the Argos, provided the field is healthy with no visible football lines before each and every TFC game. Anything short of that might garner a negative response from the Reds' faithful, and rightfully so.  I read an interesting article yesterday regarding another option; two different playing surfaces. Here it is: http://argosadmirals.com/2015/03/24/the-torotno-argonauts-have-no-place-on-the-pitch/  This could and should be the solution we all want. Agreed?"

I mean he was eligible for the 2014 NFL Draft...  E: Okay I think I worked it out.  He was on BC's neg list as an international player. Since he was granted Canadian citizenship this would give him national player status.  I'm guessing the reason he had to go through the Supplemental Draft is that were he a Canadian citizen when he finished his college career (2013-14 season) he would have had to have been selected in the CFL draft, and he hasn't played in the CFL yet.  I'm assuming if BC had brought him in last year he wouldn't have been placed in the Supplemental Draft."

CFL,36ivd8,Zeppelanoid,9,Wed May 20 15:53:50 2015 UTC,"Branding, branding, branding. If Bell and Larry can make the Argos the IN thing then it could be huge. Start small, work on visibility, then look towards endorsement. Look what Drake did with the Raptors. Is it a long shot, maybe. But it's doable.   I honestly feel with Toronto now safe the CFL needs to work on branding itself as a bigger, more professional league. It needs to start implementing some of the glitz and glam the NFL does that attracts the young wide eyed viewers."

CFL,36ivd8,TheHeroRedditKneads,4,Tue May 19 19:46:18 2015 UTC,"While I think that this is good for the Argo's for now, I think we're still a bit away from a permanent solution, both for the Argos and TFC.  With the Argos being second tenant, if the increased usage from football begins to effect the field for MLS football, it could cause headaches for the Argos, Bell and Tanenbaum.  In addition to this, from what I've read in other articles and sites, there will be NO on field advertising for the Argos. This will be a major revenue hit that will have to be rectified within a couple of seasons. One proposal that I've seen comes from this Argos fan blog, and I agree with it: http://argosadmirals.com/2015/03/24/the-torotno-argonauts-have-no-place-on-the-pitch/  The Argos being sold and moving to BMO a short term solution that will need long term planning for it to be successful. While a major piece is now in place to help provide stability to the franchise, I wouldn't be calling this the moment that the Argos are saved."
CFL,36ivd8,dotCeh,3,Wed May 20 01:31:21 2015 UTC,"These are all good points, and I'm glad you've mentioned them. I'm inclined to agree that BMO shouldn't be considered a permanent solution by any means, for the good of everyone involved.   On the other hand, given how hard it was to even get this arrangement in place, I'm skeptical the Argos could figure out a permanent fix in the near-ish future."
CFL,36ivd8,CanadianGladiator,2,Wed May 20 02:42:33 2015 UTC,"I think this could become as close to a permanent solution as you can get without building your own stadium. There's still things that have to be sorted out between now and when they play their first game, and even after. I imagine that an idea like the removable turf will have to explored for the long term. I just think we should temper the idea that the Argos are somehow magically saved. Still a long way to go before BMO can be a permanent home for the Argos, but they're closet then they ever where before."
CFL,36ivd8,dotCeh,6,Wed May 20 04:54:25 2015 UTC,"You're correct on a lot of points.  One thing I think that hasn't been considered is TFC's whanning attendance numbers and television numbers. Both are stagnant outside of marquee games. Some have argued TFC has hit its ceiling in terms of growth in Canada, others would argue the opposite. If the latter is true, then BMO field needs the Argos more than the Argos need it in the coming years. The simple reason behind that is advertising numbers. CFL vs. MLS viewership in Canada is a laughable comparison. CFL crushes MLS in viewership, translating into a higher price charged for advertising. I honestly feel that the only reason Rogers allowed a lease to be negotiated for the Argos is fear of losing advertising dollars.    It could be possible in the next 5 years that because of the money drawn from the gate, concessions and advertising BMO slowly turns into an Argos first stadium with TFC in second, while MLSE continues to jerk off the TFC supporters telling them ""HEY THE STADIUM IS RED ITS DEFINITELY YOUR GUYSES""."

At first I was not in favour of it but the more I think about the more it seems like the best move. This would reduce the overlap with the NFL. 4) Hire independent neurologists - This should and probably happen in the next 5 years. 5) Punish CIS Dopers - Not really a big deal in my opinion. If a player has to use steroids in college/amateur chances are he won't make it in the CFL. Plus this isn't really a CFL problem, its a CIS problem."

He's retired now but they've got a young up and comer at QB and the defense is still pretty solid."

CFL,366uzb,seniorhame,1 point,Sun May 17 07:03:49 2015 UTC,"Setting the record straight: Anthony Calvillo may have set a number of regular season passing records. But as a lifetime Alouettes fan...one thing needs to be said: AC was 3/8 in Grey Cup games. That's 3 losses and 5 defeats. Calvillo is well known as a choker in Montreal. Not to mention the fact that before Trestman came to town (and this informs my opinions and prejudice about Calvillo) AC was 1-5 in Grey Cup Games...and EVERYONE was sure AC was on his way out. Trestman rode Calvillo like a triple crown winner. In fact...NO FORCE ON EARTH could convince Trestman to pull Calvillo...whether the Als were up 50-0...AC was in ""choke"" mode (more often than not in Hamilton)...or at the end when AC could barely lift his left arm (for shame...what were you thinking Matt Dunigan?). Several backup quarterbacks wasted years of their careers waiting for a chance that would never come...stripped of their futures in order to feed 2 men's blinding ambition. So AC got the BIG records.Trestman got to HC the Bears. What did Alouettes fans get exactly? A couple of Cups and NO Future.  So yup...now the Alouettes have been floundering since the Calvillo ""injury"" then retirement....and especially since any decent backup to AC left town years ago. Troy Smith, Alex Brink, Tanner Marsh, Crompton, LeFevour...GM Jim Popp has been pulling the wool over Alouettes fans' eyes passing off other teams' QB rejects as legitimate quarterbacks. Despicable cynicism.  So what do I think about Rakeem Cato? I think there's every possibility he'll win 3 or more Grey Cups with this team before he gets nabbed by the smartest NFL franchise. I SERIOUSLY DOUBT he'll lose 5.  What team do the Alouettes remind me of? Think Seattle Seahawks. 1) The Name: The alouette is a lark...a bird like the seahawk. 2) Rakeem Cato: Destroyed Russell Wilson's consecutive games with a TD record in college 3) Defence: In the absence of ANY real starting quarterback the Alouettes still managed a reasonably good season last year. The Als defence is aggressive with one of the best secondaries in the league.  4) Smashmouth running: Since Brandon Whitaker was released Tyrell Sutton has taken over at RB. Whitaker, despite some impressive numbers was truly inconsistent in short-medium situations...a drive killer. Sutton ran N/S for 134 yards last week. Not bad in a 2 down game. 5) Kick/Punt returner/ST: After YEARS of Trestman pretending special teams means nothing in the CFL (most informed opinion places it at 1/3 of this game) Installing his buddy as part-time ST coordinator...the Alouettes have FINALLY given ""teams"" the importance it rightly deserves.  This includes hiring ex-HC Kavis Reed as full-time ST coach. Stephan Logan as a returner is pure speed and electricity. Als replaced Smurf-foot Sean Whyte with 6'4"" 225lbs Rouge et Or phenom Boris Bede. Bede probably won't be kicking around the CFL for very long...one look at his leg and you get that.  I doubt GM Jim Popp had the Seahawks in mind when he picked Rakeem Cato. But from what I can tell...his addition completes the analogy. If the kid can keep it up...and veteran receivers like SJ Green, Fred Stamps, Sam Giguere and Nik Lewis don't let up... the Alouettes MAY be just that much better and more successful than the Hawks (on a bigger, yet smaller stage)   Oh BTW  D&P and all the rest of 'em: You guessed it: I TOLD YOU SO!"
CFL,3666ei,Stach37,2,Sat May 16 15:11:57 2015 UTC,"Turenne was a decent player for us over the last couple of years when he got the chance to play, but I don't know enough about the Xs and Os or the personnel situation to comment on whether or not it was a good move (if anything, they think they found someone who is either better or cheaper).  Sad to see a familiar name go.  Fun(?) fact: Turenne being injured allowed Brackenridge to be in the lineup for the 2012 Labour Day Classic, where he had a punt block/return TD - his contributions that game likely lead to his prominence on the roster today source.  That's how the game go"
CFL,3666ht,Stach37,3,Sat May 16 15:12:54 2015 UTC,"They mentioned two reasons for the salary cap going up in the article: a rising salary cap, and a premium price being placed on Canadian talent.   I think there is a third thing as well, or at least an extension of the second reason above.   More of the top end Canadian talent is going to the NFL, even if it is just to kick around on a practice roster for a few years. These increased signing bonuses are incentives to spend some time in the CFL right away, and maybe wait for that NFL shot."
CFL,3666gv,Stach37,3,Sat May 16 15:12:39 2015 UTC,"I, contrary to what the people in this thread say.  Believe that the transit is actually perfect, and I take it every game.  Free too.  Driving and parking: parking is not amazing, but is being improved because they added a new lot that only costs 10 dollars.  Driving there is fine now, it just sucked going south bound to get to the perimeter because of construction.  That being said, the old stadium was perfect for this.  I parked about 10 cars away from the stadium on a street that drove into the north side of Canad'Inns.  Like a 2 minute walk and free.  Most of these comments weirdly disagree with what I'm saying though.    Also this location is way closer for some so I'm thankful personally."

CFL,3666gv,OdetoPoutine,5,Sat May 16 20:56:51 2015 UTC,It definitely is a beautiful stadium (at least in my opinion) but it's plagued by structural problems and a controversial location.
CFL,3666gv,PolarOpposites8,4,Sat May 16 22:27:14 2015 UTC,"This is a cluster fuck for the Bombers, and the city of Winnipeg. The arena was built in a terrible location (former U of M student, the arena is a HUGE inconvenience to students of the university who pay a lot of money to park on campus, and are forced to move during gamedays/events). Events at the arena are more of an inconvenience to go to than anything. Traffic flow, and any kind of public transit, is a nightmare. You pretty much need to go 2-ish hours early to anything if you don't want to be incredibly inconvenienced or late.  The fact that the stadium already needs 30 million dollars in repairs, given the huge cost of the stadium to the city already, is an absolute joke. And they want to repair the stadium (ideally) at no cost to the team? WOW..."
CFL,3666gv,enigmaticevil,11,Sat May 16 17:24:36 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I haven't found that traffic flow is an issue for events. I live pretty much next door to the campus, go to events occasionally, and find that they handled traffic really well. It's just common sense that when 50,000 people are moving towards the same location, you'll have slower traffic. But the only ""slow"" part was Pembina near Bishop Grandin, which was mostly from the traffic lights. I found their system of having two lanes for people looking for parking, and one lane for drop-off's (which is redirected off the main road) to be very efficient. Lots of police to stop people from just driving wherever, lots of signs to prepare you for what lane you need. When I went to a Bombers game, we barely had to stop the car to get dropped off, it was so easy and we walked to the stadium from the drop-off area within 2 minutes. As for surrounding areas where I live, I barely notice events happening. The traffic is dispersed efficiently enough by the time you reach Pembina or the surveys around the school. I feel like they actually handled it really well. Try getting to a Ti-Cats game and you'll realize we've got it good. Ivor Wynne becomes just a sea of people walking the streets and parking on lawns.      I do agree though, 30 million in repairs this soon is insane."
CFL,3666gv,vickipaperclips,2,Sat May 16 19:31:24 2015 UTC,"As insane as it is, if you don't make the $30m in repairs soon, it might be a much bigger bill even 2, 3 years from now.   But you shouldn't have to make any repairs on a brand new stadium, and that's the problem."
CFL,3666gv,falsekoala,1 point,Sun May 17 00:57:57 2015 UTC,"Good points. I'm thinking from the perspective of anyone who lives north of Pembina, I used to live in the west end, or anyone who would rely on Transit (which has it's own issues).  PLUS considering the True North drama with the MTS center, it's a political nightmare (as the other reply noted) waiting to happen.  Edit: grammar."
CFL,3666gv,enigmaticevil,2,Sat May 16 19:43:21 2015 UTC,"Ahh true, I've never had to deal with transit so you've got a point there. I guess it's pretty different for people North of Pembina."
CFL,3666gv,vickipaperclips,2,Sat May 16 19:47:51 2015 UTC,"To be fair, it's not a ""they want"" -- this is Lawless's take on the issue. He's looking in from the outside, as all columnists necessarily do. So his take and the Bombers' take may be different.   That said, you're right, a $30M repair-and-oh-we-didn't-get-it-right-the-first-time bill is ludicrous. And the fight over this is going to be triple the ludicrous.  Where normally the province and therefore the taxpayers would likely take the lion's share of the bill with the Bombers shouldering some small portion (ludicrous x2, just on principle), I don't know whether Selinger will want to take that political hit in an election year, or if he would instead be more inclined to fight it in court until after the votes come in and it's either not a problem or it's someone else's problem (ludicrous x3).  And Lawless rightly points out that for Wade Miller to have to deal with all this under the watchful gaze of three people whose legacies for the club are intricately entwined with a goddamned working fucking stadium is just insane.  The board has shown some new character with Miller, Walters, and O'Shea at the helm of football operations, and I absolutely love what I've been seeing in that respect. I hope they continue to show that character and that Asper, Watchorn, and AbouZeid gracefully recuse themselves from proceedings relating to the suit with Stuart Olson Dominion until it's finished. That might be the best for all involved, IMO."

I shudder to think what traveling to games would have been like if they'd built it in Point Douglas like they were talking about at one point.  However there was a better option that the city/province shot down early, and that was to build the Stadium at Assiniboia Downs. That would have been the best option, I think; access to both the Trans Canada and the Perimeter, tons of room to expand parking, lots of space for things like shuttle buses, and it would have made travel to and from games way way easier for both out of towners and people in the north part of the city. But it would have required building this shiny new stadium outside of the Perimeter so we knew it would never have happened."

Allowing them to be counted as Canadians (sorry, Nationals) and get on a roster gives a boost to the CIS system, though. If you're a talented quarterback at the CIS level and have an actual shot at the CFL, you're more inclined to train and develop as a QB instead of, say, a SB. That's the primary reason for having local talent ratios in pro leagues around the world, is it helps development at the lower levels."

Thankfully the quality of Canadian players seems to be on the rise.   It's not really a question of fair or unfair, but rather that this is a Canadian league, and we want to see Canadians play.

He let Sinopoli remain at the #3 QB for almost 3 years before converting him to a Rec. I could see the same situation with Buckley. No way he's going to outplay Tate or Bo, but I feel he has an advantage over Bryant Moniz and Dominique Davis just because he's been playing the game longer. I see Buckley sitting in nicely at #3.   Brandon Bridge I honestly feel will be right behind Crompton this year. I don't see Dan LeFevour who is in the last legs of his CFL career and Tanner Marsh really being able to compete with Bridge. Bridge was on the radar of so many NFL teams due to his arm strength and mechanics. Not only that Popp has publically said that they're absolutely thrilled and excited to have him and expect great things.  Yantz, I could see going either way. The Bombers depth at QB is ""meh"" at best. Brohm and Marve were both inconsistent however Brohm had flashes of brilliance last year. Josh Portis has bounced from PR to PR and has never done enough to make the full roster so I feel he's a non-issue. It's been repeatedly said that Yantz was the most pro-ready QB in the CIS this past year so I honestly feel he could land at #3 on the depth chart.  Those are my thoughts. At any rate this is incredibly exciting!"
CFL,35yns9,Shadybob91,4,Thu May 14 16:54:01 2015 UTC,"I agree that our backup QB depth isn't great, but I would not say that Brohm  had flashes of brilliance last year. He came in and played ok when Willy was hurt, but IIRC he really only ran short pass plays and struggled with longer throws. I thought that the small amount of time Marve got to see game action, he was way more impressive. Marve is also way more of a mobile QB and made some nice throws on the run and had some nice gains on scrambled plays.   I would much rather see Marve come into the game if for whatever reason Willy can't play simply because he can make plays that Brohm can't. Just my two cents though."

CFL,35ussb,bquinho,2,Thu May 14 09:02:15 2015 UTC,Kyle Walters absolutely believes in starting a Canadian CB.
CFL,35ussb,bquinho,1 point,Thu May 14 12:35:08 2015 UTC,"Excited to see what Demski and Abankwah can do.  Hadn't really looked up many of the prospects and the only tape I really watched was the Rider interview with Byron Archambault (who Hamilton picked).  Not really sure where our holes were because anything was overshadowed by Durant's absence.  Hopefully Matt Rea is a nice replacement for Hughes if he decides to retire.  The Dlinemen we selected look like they can be good I guess, don't really know much about them but TSN did a profile on Tennant.  Not sure what to say about Adjei other than that there must be a fitness model with the same name (I guess you can google him if you want to see some mancandy)."
CFL,35ussb,ponimaju,1 point,Thu May 14 14:03:01 2015 UTC,Abankwah looks like an entertaining player based off his highlight tape.

CFL,35vq1k,GivePopPopYourHair,1 point,Thu May 14 13:52:47 2015 UTC,Agreed. Maher just wasn't consistent enough and with the new kicking rules I think it would be worse.
CFL,35w1er,JasonBourne008,1 point,Wed May 13 23:57:21 2015 UTC,"Totallying the scores from each team:   Montreal Alouettes - 294 points (9 selections) BC Lions - 280 points (8 selections) Winnipeg Blue Bombers - 203 (6 selections) Toronto Argonauts - 205 points (7 selections) Ottawa RedBlacks - 183 points (6 selections) Calgary Stampeders- 267 points (8 selections) Saskatchewan Roughriders - 176 points (7 selections) Edmonton Eskimos - 172 points (5 selections) Hamilton Tiger-Cats - 143 (6 selections)     As far as I know there is no public single CFL Draft big board, so I had to make my own. Firstly, players are ranked by their Spring Rankings according to the Scouting Bureau. After that players are slotted based on their positional rankings, by Dwayne Forde. Thirdly, unranked players are ranked in the order in which they were drafted. Undrafted players are on the bottom. Finally, players who were either drafted or signed by NFL teams were given a value penalty. I arbitrarily moved Christian Covington half-way through the draft, and Tyler Varga and Brett Boyko I placed 1/3 of the way down the draft board."
CFL,35u9i9,JLangvee,2,Wed May 13 15:44:34 2015 UTC,"I'm a long suffering Bomber fan and perhaps that's is a bit of bias when I say that Winnipeg will have the most impact from their draft picks.   Their previous management pretty much ignored Canadian content,  so it's a given that their picks will get play time,  especially on the  O line."
CFL,35u9i9,Hammerhil,5,Wed May 13 18:25:47 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure there's a way to combat the bias.

CFL,35qikx,r_a_g_s,2,Tue May 12 21:24:30 2015 UTC,It's possible that it's new retro. A few years ago all the teams released retro jerseys and logos.
CFL,35qikx,badgerpapa,6,Tue May 12 23:14:29 2015 UTC,"Entirely possible, but almost all of the retro Als stuff you see has the old A-M logo from the 70s and 80s (as seen here or here) so I'm more inclined to believe it's legit old school."

CFL,35pxc4,RhynoSorceress,3,Tue May 12 16:24:16 2015 UTC,My gut tells me that we might take Brandon Bridge in the 6th or 7th. I also feel Huff or Barker might take a shot at him too.

CFL,35pxc4,bquinho,3,Tue May 12 16:55:19 2015 UTC,"Since the Argos have the #3 pick at present, it would make the most sense to select the best OL available.

CFL,35pxc4,moethehobo,2,Tue May 12 17:05:33 2015 UTC,"Edmonton fan here - Hervey has said he is committed to drafting the best player available, which I agree with.  But the best scenario for Edmonton would be for the BPA to be an O-lineman.  It would be a great year to move up because the chances that one of the top O-linemen falls to Edmonton isn't looking good.  I think Calgary will be looking to move up for o-line as well.  I don't know if any other team would pass on an o-lineman who can start from day one though."
CFL,35pxc4,notkapowski,2,Tue May 12 18:20:19 2015 UTC,Dumb question but I'm a newbie: would it not be smart to draft that quarterback given that being able to use a non import slot there would be so beneficial or is the benefit negligible?
CFL,35pxc4,CaptainHadley,2,Tue May 12 23:14:09 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure quarterbacks don't count as import or nonimport, so there's no benefit."

CFL,35pxc4,JasonBourne008,2,Wed May 13 00:07:45 2015 UTC,Despite what it says below I'm certain QB's count as nationals/internationals. The fact of the matter is there just isn't that many Canadian QBs who are good enough to make it. Last Canadian QB was Sinopoli and he plays receiver now
CFL,35px3l,Stach37,6,Tue May 12 15:24:12 2015 UTC,"I can't imagine that his accusations are true. There is no way a CFL team would actively lie to a guy about being released or even mislead him about his contract status.  That said, still a very unfortunate situation all around."
CFL,35px3l,CanadianGladiator,1 point,Tue May 12 17:25:49 2015 UTC,I don't really understand why we didn't re-sign him? His ypc has been stellar in his career so far (averages 6 yards per carry on 69 carries). He was the best part of our offense at the end of last season.
CFL,35mykd,Stach37,2,Mon May 11 20:48:29 2015 UTC,Well his career is done. At least he ended it with a Grey Cup and MVP. But he'll be too old and too out of touch by the 2016 season.

CFL,35mykd,FondleOtter,1 point,Mon May 11 23:23:58 2015 UTC,Most people logically assumed he was done when the news came out.  If he's still not healthy enough to play at all this year (consider there's still like 6.5 months till the Grey Cup) it's reasonable to assume he never will be.  Achilles tears are bad but they don't have year+ recovery times anymore.  He's already at like 8.5 months.
CFL,35mykd,chemicalxv,1 point,Tue May 12 00:30:48 2015 UTC,"Such a pity. He had basically made the Raiders when this started to happen. You couldn't predict a long NFL career for him, but I'm sure he would have savoured it."

Everyone thought that the Stamps might take a shot at Yantz with the last pick, so we where somewhat surprised  Buckley got taken over Yantz. Apparently the Stamps where the first team to reach out to Yantz for interviews and such, so he was on their radar.  With some of the talk, something's came up that may have tipped the balance in Buckley's favour a little to justify a draft pick: He's younger (I believe), he's more of an athlete so he could potentially play another position, and it looks good from a PR stand point (Stamps draft Dino who grew up and developed though the various Calgary and area leagues.) Yantz is more of a 'pure' QB, it is more than likely that he'll get picked/given a look as a free agent with someone."

CFL,35lsrd,ponimaju,1 point,Wed May 13 02:27:33 2015 UTC,Als seem to be a QB factory. I wouldn't be surprised if he ends up playing there and they turn him into a very good QB.
CFL,35lsrd,RaptorsFromSpace,1 point,Wed May 13 02:33:09 2015 UTC,would love to see him come up here and give it a shot!
CFL,35lsrd,dotCeh,1 point,Wed May 13 04:11:33 2015 UTC,He should be seeing as he wasn't given an offer in the NFL

Helps that he's a national, and a local boy from S'toon, and the U of R.

CFL,35e000,omegatron20xx,2,Sat May 9 19:27:38 2015 UTC,"You may remember me from word clouds I made in every MLB, Premier League, NHL, NBA, and NFL team subreddit for their last respective seasons, or my Swears/Subscriber Breakdown by for states/cities/regional subreddits and my previous sports profanity breakdown. I gathered this data for this using a modified version of a script made by the folks over at /r/MUWs. If you want to create your own word cloud for another subreddit, you can post requests there. I have also done several requests, as the default /r/MUW bot does only a monthly breakdown, and as I have several sports and city related dictionaries I use to filter out particularly common words that are not normally detected. The actual word maps were made through Wordle. My apologies if these are difficult to see. I suffer from monochromatic colorblindness, so I had to use hex codes I found online when putting this together. Common words such as “the”, “and”, “I'm”, as well as numbers were removed from the clouds.  To get at swearing frequencies, I took the raw data (including “the”, “and”, etc.), totaled all the words, and then added up all instances of swearing. Each category of swearing had several words that made it up, as the raw data does not differentiate between plural and singular forms. Common prefixes and suffixes were added. For instance, motherfuckers show up in the fuck category. The non-American category includes such words as twat, bugger, wanker, bastard, arse, arsehole, and shite. Genitalia includes cock, cunt, pussy, dickhead, tits, and cocksucker.  Words per subscriber were obviously obtained by dividing the number of words used by the number of subscribers to the sub and the subscriber counts were taken at the time my scan took place."

We're both fans of growing leagues that are generally looked down on by the so called big leagues, and if there was any other immediate viable option I'm sure that would have been looked at and supported. But as it stands BMO is the only place in Toronto that gives the Argos any chance to continue playing after 2017.   It's a shit situation, but I think fans of both leagues can get along using the same facility. Who knows maybe with some ticket packages with the Argos TFC can pick up supporters from CFL fans across the country and gain some interest in soccer as well."

CFL,35810e,autowikibot,1 point,Sat May 9 03:46:27 2015 UTC,"Canadian Football Act:       The Canadian Football Act (1974) was a proposed Act by the Parliament of Canada in April 1974 designed to give a government-protected monopoly over professional football in Canada to the Canadian Football League. Although it was never signed into law, the move by the government eventually compelled the World Football League's Toronto Northmen, a team that was originally set to play in Toronto, to move to Memphis, Tennessee in the United States as the Memphis Southmen.  Today, there is speculation that a similar act will develop if the National Football League tries to expand to Toronto and thus threatens the Canadian league's existence.  Yet likely it would still allow for an NFL team to play in Canada in an NFL preseason game and the CFL's off season; thus allowing for a Canadian city to host the Super Bowl in the unlikely event that the NFL ever decided to host their premier event in a non-NFL city.  It is also unlikely than any future act will be passed to ever affect American college football, such as the NCAA and NAIA, who have or have had teams based in Canada and bowl games hosted in Canadian cities, with no opposition, in part because the CFL draws part of its players from American College teams as well.

CFL,358do2,darkhorse65,1 point,Fri May 8 02:09:22 2015 UTC,"While I agree McMahon is low guy on the totem pole for getting a Grey Cup right now, it can host it though despite being a dump compared to other stadiums.   While Calgary does need a new stadium, again I go back to my point that the Flames want to build a new stadium and arena in the same area (similar to how some NFL and MLB stadiums are.) Unless something changed and they cannot do that anymore, then I doubt it has to do with a new football stadium. Could be something unrelated to the Grey Cup and a new stadium."

I think the last two years have been spreading out a rebuild after the stacked grey cup run.  I think some of the coaching staff turnover is unexpected, but ended up fitting with the current rebuild process.  There is potential to not regress from last year as I think the player talent will be better than last year.  If the coaching staff doesn't gel, well game over for Sask.  More importantly, in the west, I think every team is solid and going to be better than last year, except maybe BC and Calgary (only because Calgary has no other direction to go)"

CFL,34xv1z,ponimaju,1 point,Wed May 6 00:52:03 2015 UTC,"Yep, that's my understanding too, and I assume it carried over when they made the national/international change (I believe it was only a name change, for all intents and purposes).  Since that was/is the reason Josh Bartel is considered non-import/national.  It's whether your ""football training"" took place in the States or not.  So I assume if some American player was living in Europe and came up in one of their football leagues, he would count as a national (as he would if he went to a CIS school instead of an NCAA one).  Not sure where that leaves Americans who play for Simon Fraser."

CFL,34vnwh,JasonBourne008,5,Tue May 5 02:20:07 2015 UTC,Yup.  I'm surprised one of the major airlines(WJ/Air Canada) haven't jumped in bed with the CFL.  With an almost entirely Canadian viewer/fanbase it seems like easy marketing.   I realize Canadian North became the 'official' airline of the CFL -- which is fucking weird considering they fly from a few select bases to the middle of nowhere Northern Canada.

I feel like if this situation happened in 2010, smart Wally would have made Lulay sit out the entire year so as not to risk injury to his franchise QB. The Grey Cup being hosted in BC this past year put a lot of pressure on the Lions to be in it once again. Risking a QBs health for another championship is almost despicable. Glenn wasn't doing a horrible job, he wasn't gonna win them the Grey Cup but he got them to the playoffs.  I know every team wants to win it every year, but the throwing arm on a quarterback is the most important part. Forget putting Lulay in vs Ottawa, he should have sat until week 20."

If under MLSE ownership the team was brought to profitability without the inclusion of the Television Contract they would be drawing money straight from their competitors as well as the profits from the team as well as the naming rights to the stadium.

CFL,33j54c,RagingIce,1 point,Wed Apr 22 23:15:59 2015 UTC,"I tend to like teams with a long tradition, even if they are not the best. Really a team that has always had a rabidly loyal fan base, even through the really, really terrible times, is one that I could see myself following. That seems kinda vague I suppose but I really appreciate teams with good histories, even if their history is not that long. From my short wikipedia browsing, it looks like there are some newer teams with older histories so I suppose that point is a little redundant."
CFL,33j54c,RagingIce,6,Wed Apr 22 23:32:18 2015 UTC,"Either the Winnipeg Blue Bombers or Saskatchewan Roughriders fit your criteria to the tee. Both have had huge championship droughts and have supported their teams through thick and thin (and probably have the most rabid fanbases of the modern CFL). Both have a lot of history (Riders are over 100 years old and Bombers are over 80 years old) as well.  The Bombers are currently in a 25 year championship drought (which is a lot in an 8/9 team league).  Ottawa while new also has a fair bit of history as well. They've folded twice and this is technically their third team, but they've been around for the majority of the CFL's glory years."
CFL,33j54c,shanata,3,Wed Apr 22 23:47:12 2015 UTC,Thanks for the quality responses! I'll definitely look into both teams a little bit more but I really like what you've said about both so far!
CFL,33j54c,PhotoJim99,4,Wed Apr 22 23:57:22 2015 UTC,I would say the Rider fans are the the Cheeseheads of the CFL.  We like to wear watermelon helmets and overall just dress up a lot. Bomber fans definitely are loyal hard core fans but I would say have a few less weird traditions.
CFL,33j54c,Tyaust,2,Thu Apr 23 17:28:42 2015 UTC,"Saskatchewan fits perfectly.  Over a century of history, but the team nearly failed in the 1990s (near-bankruptcy).  It has considerably recovered since then and now routinely sells out its games and draws the largest crowds on the road of any other CFL team.  It won a championship at home a year and a half ago, only the fourth it's ever won.  Its second championship, the 1989 Grey Cup, is widely regarded as being possibly the best Grey Cup game ever played, with the Roughriders prevailing 43-40 on a last-play field goal by Dave Ridgway.  A new stadium is under construction - if you care to come up you can get the fun of a game in the old, storied barn this season or next or the new building in 2017.  It's being built just a few blocks from the old one."

Last season was painful to watch most games, and it was because the games were choppy from so many penalties...  I'm expecting a lot of that same choppy game-play from this new rule resulting in as many, or even more, penalties than last season.

CFL,338nxj,Denton83,1 point,Tue Apr 21 16:48:30 2015 UTC,"I agree with your point that it remains to be seen how the league/refs will enforce this rule, but I'm expecting it to be a gong show of flags (at least for the first 1/3 of the season).  If this rule is enforced to the letter... well none of the players have played with such little contact on routes/coverage since their days in Pop Warner (the CFL will have less contact on a receiver beyond 5 yards than most flag football games).    It all depends on how heavy handed the league chooses to be about this, but the reason I think it is going to suck is that A) the league will be flag happy early in an attempt to firmly set this new precedent; and, B) despite my love of all tings CFL, the reffing is still one of its glaring weaknesses, and I expect this rule to be enforced as inconsistently as all the other rules."
CFL,338nxj,daneflys,1 point,Tue Apr 21 17:21:53 2015 UTC,"we shall see. I am hopeful. It all depends what instructions the refs get, if they get instruction only to call blatant Jams after 5 yards, wont be so bad, if they decide to call every bit of posturing and positioning, not great."

CFL,32q9w4,VildL2,8,Wed Apr 15 21:10:43 2015 UTC,"If you want to be indoctrinated into the cult that is Riderville, there is a regular podcast from Regina called the sportscage.    Even when there is absolutely nothing CFL going on, they still find things to talk about, but they are 100% RoughRider homers. It works for me.  For example, they were on location at the Riders mini camp in Florida this past weekend to give you an idea of their rabid fandom.  They even joke about their fandom being a little much. Last week they were making fun of themselves, joking that 'Weston Dressler was seen getting a slurpie, early indications were that it was Grape.'  You do have to put up with coverage of other Regina sports from time to time and heavens forbid, MLB and NHL. I wouldn't listen to it for NHL, NBA, MLB coverage as the focus on CFL makes other league coverage pretty weak.  With no football and playoff hockey going on, they tend push CFL coverage to Monday and Friday."

Arash Madani is a good one too, but he can get a little irritating from time to time. Out of Winnipeg, you gotta check out Darrin Bauming & Gary Lawless. Both great writers and broadcasters!   Chris O'Leary from the Edmonton Journal is also a spectacular beat writer for the Eskimos and does a wicked job of covering across the league.   When it comes to the Riders, I'd much rather listen to Jamie Nye instead of Rod Petersen... Petersen runs Sportscage off 620CKRM and their over the top homerism is too much for me too handle."

CFL,32ifm3,BombersJetsJays,10,Tue Apr 14 01:22:14 2015 UTC,"Many ridiculous things said in this video. First of all the Argos will survive at BMO. 100%. Rogers Centre is terrible for football. Once they move outside into a nice, cozy stadium, they will succeed.   They also said a Grey Cup could be played at BMO. Why would they play at BMO when they can use Rogers Centre which is bigger for the bigger event? Just because they would play regular season games there doesn't mean they have to have Toronto Grey Cups there as well.  They also implied the league was in trouble with out Toronto. Ridiculous. Yeah without Toronto the CFL would lose sponsors without the biggest market, but it's not like over 100 years of history would be chucked away. Players would just be paid less an the level of professionalism might dip, but football wouldn't stop. So if Toronto is losing their team I guess everyone in all of Canada will suddenly stop coming out in tens of thousands every week to watch their favourite team in what are for the most part beautiful new stadiums. Give me a break.  They also implied the City of Toronto and MLSE had nothing to gain from the Argos moving in. The naming rights of the stadium is up for grabs this year. The Argos TV ratings are literally 10 times that of TFC meaning the naming rights will suddenly be worth 10 times more ($$$), plus it brings in more dates and therefore revenue streams for the city to make money. Nothing to gain my @$$.   Toronto media implies that if Toronto doesn't decide to spare the time for the burden of their CFL team the entire league will fall apart because without Toronto the entire football culture of Canada will die. What a joke. I will support my Blue Bomber until I die, Toronto or not, big tv deal or not, or anything else."
CFL,32ifm3,tmlrule,7,Tue Apr 14 01:28:58 2015 UTC,"Why would they play at BMO when they can use Rogers Centre which is bigger for the bigger event?   Well for one:   Rogers Centre is terrible for football.   Secondly, the big reason Rogers wants the Argos to leave is to replace the turf at Skydome with real grass. That means you'd have to either keep the grass in good shape through mid-November or replace it entirely for one game, neither of which are really feasible."

CFL,32ifm3,PhotoJim99,3,Tue Apr 14 12:19:53 2015 UTC,"The Rogers Centre is an amazing place when it is full.  (So is Montreal's Olympic Stadium.)  The problem is that it is not usually full.  It is sufficiently full for a Grey Cup (and witness the Alouettes' success at Olympic Stadium for their playoff games).  However, the grass is the problem.  Once the grass is in the stadium, no more football will be played there."

It would be like the NHL losing the Coyotes. Big market, but no fans. The point I was making was that the Toronto media implies that the CFL is only alive, because it stands on the foundation of Toronto and without it the CFL would perish which is crap.

CFL,32fzsr,JasonBourne008,6,Mon Apr 13 14:21:57 2015 UTC,"I read the article, honestly, the author is just speculating. He doesn't really present any good evidence to prove his point.    When you need three yards in the CFL, that’s a throwing down no matter where you are on the field, so teams will continue to throw on two-point converts—just with a little less vertical space to play with.   I'm sorry, but running the ball from 3 yards out is totally viable. Especially considering the Defense has to be 1-yard off the ball pre-snap.     I do agree with him though that Offensive Pass interference should be challengeable. I think the reason it was not passed this off-season is because they are hoping that the no contact after 5 yards rule will make it easier for the referees to make the correct call initially."

CFL,31g1ln,ponimaju,2,Sun Apr 5 18:09:21 2015 UTC,"The only reference I can find with a quick google search is that 30 hours per week is considered full time employment - not sure what that translates to if your employment simply doesn't exist for certain periods of a year.  Just saying realistically that the employment term in the NHL is longer (and regardless of whether or not they're getting paid specifically for playoff games, it's still part of their job/contract somehow I assume - I guess it could be likened to salaried employees [and well, player wages are usually referred to as salaries]- if you're on three weeks vacation for a certain month you're still getting paid as much as if you worked the entire month with no days off)."

CFL,318okf,jacatola,2,Thu Apr 2 23:33:06 2015 UTC,"Oh god.  I had this argument with a couple of friends over whatsapp recently and they were angrily adamant in their opinion that some of the best college teams (like Alabama a couple of years ago) could beat CFL teams.  While I concede that there are some very good athletes and players on some Div 1 teams, what my argument came down to: the harsh reality is that many of them are not going to be good enough for any level of professional football, and a CFL team consists of 50+ men who are good enough for professional football.  A few studs like a Joey Bosa or a James Laurinaitis aren't going to be able to carry a team.  I used the ""boys against men"" argument as well.  Basically, my friends don't give the CFL enough credit.  Would Alabama of the AJ McCarron era be able to beat last year's REDBLACKS?  I still don't think so, though that's the argument they tried to make to say that I was being absurd.  Again, I think it comes down to the fact that while a few of the players will go on to be stud NFL players, many of them won't even be starting in the NFL in their rookie seasons, and the vast majority of the 100+ college football roster will never play football professionally, nor would they even get more than a second look if they were at a training camp/walk-on (most wouldn't even be invited).  The fact is that any level of professional football is a weeding out process, and the teams will (with few remarkable cinderella story exceptions) field the best team that they can through signings, free agency, camps and all of that."
CFL,318okf,ponimaju,1 point,Sun Apr 5 03:36:39 2015 UTC,I read in an article only 1.4% of D1 players ever go pro at any level. So the CFL is made up of players that are part of the top 1.4%.  Plus boy against men.

However, I'm unconvinced because I'm sure an all Canadian matchup isn't that much bigger viewership-wise and I'd bet that the number of people from Saskatchewan alone tuning into a non-riders game is equal to many all American MLS games.    Recently, numbers were posted on /r/cfl that showed the CFL often gets better ratings in the states than MLS.  The biggest thing the Lions need to worry about is ""demographics"".

You're five linemen generally take the middle of the field, while the up backs take the outsides to funnel the runners in to the linemen. By having them stay home, there really is no incenditve, IMO, to try and get much preasure, as you can have your Dline come back and block the 7 guys that can try and make a tackle (11 on 7). You'll likely see the ball getting a lot closer to or past centre field on most punt returns. If this is the case, teams are either going to go for it more on 3rd down if they're past centre field, or just kick it out of bounds and eat the 10 yard penalty."

And I don't get it, if you're going for 2 points you can scrimmage from the 3 yard line?  I thought either way you start at the same place?  Like do you declare you're going for 2?"
CFL,30t4w3,KamikazeCanuck,2,Mon Mar 30 22:44:15 2015 UTC,"I think both this and the TSN article got the wording wrong on that first part - I assume they want to do the same thing as the NFL which is have PATs effectively be 32 yard kicks - in the NFL that meant kicking from the 15 and in the CFL it would be from the 25 (otherwise it's a 39 yard PAT attempt).  And yes, in the past the PAT and two point convert attempts both took place from the 5 yard line (5+7 = a 12 yard PAT) so effectively you'd have to declare it, but I don't think that's a big deal since you hardly see fakes for 2s - if you're going to go for 2 you'd probably want to just line up in a formation that gives you a better chance for success (and have the personnel out there to throw/catch/run it in)."
CFL,30t4w3,ponimaju,1 point,Wed Apr 1 04:40:07 2015 UTC,"Like: 32 yard PAT (I think they mean it would be kicked from the 25+7 to make it the same yardage as what the NFL attempted)  5 yard no yards being tacked on to the return - I like that there's more of a penalty for encroaching there, since all you have to do is get 6 yards on the return and the penalty is meaningless.  Additionally (and this is my interpretation of the wording) it seems like a returner could use this as leeway to try to run backwards in order to get a bigger return, since if they fail and the flag was thrown, the worst they can do if they happen to lose yardage is still 5 yards from where they touched the ball originally (though maybe they'll change that in the final wording?)  Don't like:  Three point extra point attempts - maybe a little too gimmicky?"
CFL,30t53p,Stach37,1 point,Mon Mar 30 14:28:44 2015 UTC,At least he understands the risks he's getting into. If he still has anything left in the tank this could be a big signing for the Lions but I can't imagine he's more athletic now than he was at 23.

CFL,30g9oj,JetsFan2Point0,4,Fri Mar 27 02:56:12 2015 UTC,"Please approve these:   a kick for a single point, which now comes from the 12-yard line, would come instead from the 32-yard line. any time in the game the offence be allowed to signal to the referee that it doesn't want to substitute and it wants to use a tempo offence. The officials would then blow the play in immediately upon the ball and yardsticks being set for play. offensive pass interference subject to video review.   My interest has been sparked:   a kicked convert that is wide would remain live and can be run back for a two-point score. two point converts would be scrimmaged from the three-yard line, instead of the current five-yard line. during the pre-season, a convert worth three points when a team chooses to run or pass the ball over the goal line from the ten-yard-line.   I don't really care   on a punt play, when the ball bounces on the ground and a five yard no yards penalty is called, the penalty will automatically be added to the end of the return, or from the point the ball was first touched by the return team, whichever is better. Currently, the receiving team has to choose between the five-yard penalty or the yards gained on the return. on punts, prohibiting the five interior linemen on the kicking team from leaving the line of scrimmage until the ball is kicked remove the ability of a coach to request a measurement, leaving it to the referee to measure when he is unsure if a first down has been made or not. no longer giving the receiving team the option of demanding that a team kick again after one of its kick offs goes out of bounds. The receiving team will either take the ball where it went out of bounds, or at a point 30 yards in advance of where the ball was kicked off, whichever is better.   Please No!   defensive player would be allowed to contact a receiver within five yards of the line of scrimmage, but would not allow either a defender or a receiver to create or initiate contact that impedes or redirects an opponent beyond five yards."
CFL,30g9oj,JasonBourne008,2,Fri Mar 27 04:39:52 2015 UTC,What is the current rule for the defensive player vs receiver? Isn't the proposed rule pretty much the same as the one already in place? I must be missing something.
CFL,30g9oj,reddit499,3,Fri Mar 27 14:43:27 2015 UTC,"I think in the current rules the defender is allowed to slightly grab, or touch the receivers, so long as they don't impede their route running. It's kinda like when the NHL got rid of off hand grabbing and stuff a couple years ago"
CFL,30g9oj,JasonBourne008,1 point,Fri Mar 27 17:33:15 2015 UTC,"I believe the current rule states no contact after 1 yard from line of scrimmage, but obviously it's been called so inconsistently that they want to make it more black and white."

CFL,30g9oj,HomerSPC,5,Fri Mar 27 03:11:23 2015 UTC,"I think it is a very good idea. Kicking field goals from the 12 yard line is basically automatic, its boring and outdated. Make the single-converts more challenging, and thus the game more dramatic."
CFL,30g9oj,JasonBourne008,4,Fri Mar 27 04:58:05 2015 UTC,I just don't want to see teams losing the game due to converts. What if your teams QB makes  a touchdown drive in the last 2 min only for the kicker to miss the convert and they still lose. I don't think that's good for the game.
CFL,30g9oj,reddit499,4,Fri Mar 27 14:39:55 2015 UTC,"So basically what you're saying is, you would rather a touchdown be worth 7 points automatically..."
CFL,30g9oj,Longroof,1 point,Fri Mar 27 15:41:26 2015 UTC,I'd be more in favour of that than a 32 yard convert. Speeds up the game without having a significant impact. The team could choose to go for two if they like.
CFL,30g9oj,reddit499,3,Fri Mar 27 17:32:10 2015 UTC,"Combined with the 2 point convert line of scrimmage being moved up to the 3 yard line, it should (if passed) result in more 2 point attempts, I'd think, which is far more exciting anyway."

CFL,305ljj,MnstrShne,-8,Tue Mar 24 20:27:58 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry if my opinion offends you but I disagree. Michael Sam is an outlier and shouldn't be compared to other players. There are cultural reasons why Michael Sam can do good in the CFL but not in the NFL. The reason he may not be ""good enough"" to get another chance in the NFL is because teams don't want the ""distraction"" that others may create if he is on a roster. Last year, ESPN had a reporter discuss Michael Sam's showers and NBC had an analyst, who is a former Super Bowl winning coach, say that he wouldn't want Michael Sam because ""things will happen"" if he was on a NFL roster."
CFL,305ljj,calgary3200,8,Wed Mar 25 17:42:50 2015 UTC,"You may be right, of course. But, the way I read that article, Sam showed poorly in the objective tests at the combine.   I agree that if he's good enough, he may be more likely accepted in the CFL. If he's good enough."
CFL,305ljj,MnstrShne,1 point,Wed Mar 25 18:14:55 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry but I thought the article was very subjective. It used one anonymous agent from a TMZ article. If we are going to only use  combine results, then we shouldn't watch games."
CFL,305ljj,calgary3200,4,Wed Mar 25 18:25:44 2015 UTC,"He sucked during last training camp, he sucked at the combine, he sucks in size and speed.    Watch the preseason games where he only did good against people that had no chance making the NFL.  Sorry if my opinion offends you; but he sucks."
CFL,305ljj,CaptainHadley,2,Thu Mar 26 21:38:26 2015 UTC,is it fair to say we agree to disagree? i watched the preseason games and he looked like the best player on the field. it will be interesting to see if he is one of the best players in the CFL too.

CFL,305ljj,GrouchoNarx,-4,Wed Mar 25 18:06:45 2015 UTC,It's sad but we live in a world where many people can't be who they want to be. It is estimated that 10-15 per cent of people in the world are gay but there are zero professional football players that are comfortable enough to say so. People are often more offended watching Michael Sam kiss his best friend than reading about another player arrested. The part that hurts me most is that people think that discrimination doesn't even exist. People are entitled to their opinions but I think that is a lot more hidden than it was 100 years ago.
CFL,305ljj,calgary3200,-3,Wed Mar 25 19:07:41 2015 UTC,"You know, and it kills me to say this, but I think that's dead on.  Mrs. Groucho and I were watching the news coverage of Sam getting drafted, and my first comment was that his boyfriend had just set his chances back significantly - irreparably for some teams. Just that one kiss and, omg, the furor. Would it have been less had the boyfriend just given him a kiss instead of a tonsillectomy? We'll never know, but best case is ""maybe"".  Personally, I think coming out like he did shows serious balls/toughness that many players wouldn't have- but sadly, when you're gonna be the trailblazer, you need to be a Jackie Robinson level talent even in our more enlightened age."
CFL,305ljj,GrouchoNarx,15,Wed Mar 25 19:17:50 2015 UTC,"I completely agree with that. Many people have been offended by him not being on a team in the NFL, but it has nothing to do with his sexuality. He was a great player in College, which sometimes doesn't transfer to any pro league. He's a Tweener, not a DE, not an OLB. He thinks that he is better than film and play show, but he's really not that good."
CFL,305ljj,treeburner57,12,Tue Mar 24 19:12:41 2015 UTC,He's a tweener in the  worst possible way he's got the worst aspects of each position so he doesn't fit anywhere.

CFL,305ljj,calgary3200,5,Wed Mar 25 17:23:34 2015 UTC,I wouldn't exactly call Brees a tweener. He's just a small QB.
CFL,305ljj,Becau5eRea5on5,0,Thu Mar 26 01:55:45 2015 UTC,you're right about brees. would you say that russell wilson is a tweener? he is sort of a QB and sort of a RB. he isn't the best at either position but he is an average player.
CFL,305ljj,calgary3200,-1,Mon Mar 30 02:57:34 2015 UTC,"i understand why you may think that but some people just want to see michael sam get a chance. he has proved to be a good player in every game he has ever been in. heart is often more important than how fast or big someone is. if we only cared about combine results, jemarcus russell would be the best QB of all time."
CFL,305ljj,calgary3200,3,Thu Mar 26 02:26:28 2015 UTC,"The thing is, even his college stats are somewhat of a lie. Sam was bigger than most kids since he was a senior. He also played on a loaded Missou d-line too so that helped him."
CFL,305ljj,GodTuukka,-1,Mon Mar 30 02:55:50 2015 UTC,"Sorry but his college stats are not a lie. He changed his team from one of the worst to one of the best in one year. The NFL has many ""tweeners"" on defence or special teams."
CFL,305ljj,calgary3200,2,Wed Mar 25 16:21:05 2015 UTC,"Sam didnt' do it. On the other end of the line, Kony Easly was drawing double teams as the best player ont hat d-line all year with a more prototypical NFL size, and was a second round pick, and did reasonably well in the NFL for the Carolina Panthers.  So there's that."
CFL,305ljj,Loop_Within_A_Loop,-2,Wed Mar 25 17:50:35 2015 UTC,Really not that good? You're entitled to your opinion but I think you should watch him play more before you write something like that. He may not have the best combine results but he has the heart of a champion and is one of the best players in the world. He is fun to watch and had very good stats with the Rams.
CFL,305ljj,calgary3200,3,Thu Mar 26 21:14:29 2015 UTC,You can't really say he is one of the best players in the world when he hasn't had the chance to play against the best in the world in regular season NFL (reasons why he hasn't had the chance aside). He's got a lot of work ahead of him if he wants to be a regular on a pro roster if these results are anything to go by.
CFL,305ljj,ChinatownHustler,4,Wed Mar 25 18:01:00 2015 UTC,"Two observations here:   That line at UMissouri was stacked, and he might've had some heat taken off of him by Kony Ealy...BUT he did start on a really stacked line... at 6'2""/260-ish, he isn't appreciably smaller than Cliff Avril...so too small to play DE might not be the case.  I've thought all along that what the boy needs is to put some meat on him...get up to about 285-290, 'cuz that bull-rush of his screams 3-tackle   He's out of position, alright, but bulk him up and move him inside and you might really have a baller on your hands."
CFL,305ljj,GrouchoNarx,-5,Thu Mar 26 04:18:56 2015 UTC,"Also, keep in mind that the Rams had Michael Sam lose weight because they wanted him on special teams. If Michael Sam ever gets a chance to play, he could be even better than Cliff Avril!"
CFL,305ljj,calgary3200,3,Wed Mar 25 18:03:14 2015 UTC,"I'll add to that that the Rams, another stacked D-line, kept him around until the end of camp  That says loads right there"
CFL,30532w,Stach37,6,Tue Mar 24 15:36:44 2015 UTC,"God I remember the talk the Raiders might draft him in the first after that combine he posted (literally ran a 4.75 40 at 6'7""/314 lbs and put up 34 bench press reps) despite the fact he was extremely raw.  The fact he lasted until the 8th pick of the 4th round was hilarious.  The guy was absolutely useless in the NFL though.  Just another project player that didn't pan out."

Replaced by an NFL-influenced rule that would limit the number of players in formation who could cross the line of scrimmage until the punt is kicked.   I think I like this variation."
CFL,3051xp,JasonBourne008,2,Tue Mar 24 17:37:04 2015 UTC,"I agree, it seems like there's literally always a No Yards call on punts. Even if it has zero effect on the outcome of the play."

CFL,2z7rys,avaRofl,60,Mon Mar 16 09:11:13 2015 UTC,"First off, these sorts of questions are asked every now and then, so you might find it interesting to search through old posts on this subreddit.  Canadian football and American football developed sort of in parallel (you can make a case that Canadian football is the original gridiron football game and American football is a derivative). The two types of football do copy each other a lot, though, so they look similar. The most visible differences between Canadian and American football are that the Canadian game has a larger field, 12 players per side, 3 downs, 1 yard neutral zone, 20 second play clock and a substantively different kicking game (rouges are awarded for kicking the ball into the end zone and preventing the opposing team from bringing it out, the kicking team can recover kicks with onside players, the no-yards rule, the field goal uprights are at the goal line, making missed FG returns a matter of course, etc.) Compared to the American game, the Canadian game is generally regarded as being faster, more open-ended and higher-scoring (though recent trends in the style of NFL play may have changed that)  No CFL team would have a chance at beating a good NFL team. A CFL team beating even a terrible NFL team sounds very unlikely. Maybe when Doug Flutie was in his prime. CFL teams did used to compete against US teams in exhibition matches, but that hasn't happened in decades, and the Canadian team only won once (Hamilton beat the Buffalo Bills).  A CFL team would beat the best US college team. I can't remember the exact statistics, but something like 10% to 20% of the best US college team's roster could conceivably make the practice roster for a CFL team. (Considering how far the NFL teams are beyond the CFL teams in terms of talent, that should give you an idea of how mind-boggingly wide the gulf is in talent between NCAA and NFL)  Popularity of the CFL varies regionally quite a bit. It's extremely popular in the prairies (fun game: go to any small town in Saskatchewan on game day and try to find a person who's not wearing a green shirt) but extremely unpopular in central Canada (e.g., Toronto). That means you get 30k people out to a game in Regina (population 200k) but only 15k out to a game in Toronto (population 3M). New stadiums being built are generally aiming at 25k in capacity or so. You have to keep in mind that Canada has a very small population compared to what you're used to in the US, so it's pretty unrealistic to expect 100k Canadians to do anything (excepting SARS Stock).  Overall, the league is doing alright, though. The Grey Cup (annual championship) is always the highest-rated single TV event of the year in Canada, with a majority of Canadians watching at least part of it."
CFL,2z7rys,OlderThanGif,19,Mon Mar 16 10:06:01 2015 UTC,"A lone cavaet about Central Canada, Hamilton has some decent support. Not nearly to the level of Rider Nation, but you'll find people wearing jerseys, having flags on their cars, even bars promoting the game quite decently. Compare this to Toronto where outside of the former mayor wearing a jersey to work the Argos get no love (even thought they're the only team in that city that can win anything). It's an interesting dichotomy of two cities that aren't really that far apart.  Source: Small sample size of living/visiting the area that was once Wentworth county, former resident of Toronto."

Another interesting point someone made below was about the CFL getting great talented players that just are not the insanely monstrousity that is required at the same talent level in the NFL which I thought was a good point.   Im guessing that the exhibitions have stopped because the NFL teams have so much to potentially lose if they suffer an injury to a key player and not much to gain from the game. Basically the same reason I've been told I will never get to see my dream of the worst NFL team playing the best NCAA team in an exhibition.   THANK YOU OLDER, AND EVERYONE FOR YOUR REPLIES!"
CFL,2z7rys,jeff744,4,Tue Mar 17 02:42:02 2015 UTC,There's also a lot of former NFL players that fall flat in the CFL simply because the game they play is so different from the one we play. As a result a player with a good record in the NFL may only turn out moderately well in the CFL depending on their position.
CFL,2z7rys,Tofinochris,3,Tue Mar 17 04:04:17 2015 UTC,"Great reply. I'd add that a great CFL team would give a very bad NFL team a run for its money, assuming some sort of compatible rules. Like you said, a good NFL team is unlikely to lose to even a historically great CFL team, mostly because the quality players are likely to be in the NFL. Most CFL players are practice squad quality NFL players: still very good, but even the very good CFL players would just be ""a guy"" on NFL teams. Exceptions like Cam Wake tend to get their ticket to the NFL pretty quick. We miss ya, Cam."
CFL,2z7rys,sckewer,2,Tue Mar 17 04:41:24 2015 UTC,"Also the field is 110 yards(probably because 100 metres is 110 yards), and the receivers are allowed to take a running start before the snap, which must be a pain for line judges to determine whose offside/ an eligible receiver.  On top of that the defender can only hold the receiver within one yard of scrimage as opposed to the NFL's 5."
CFL,2z7rys,johnnypesos,1 point,Tue Mar 17 08:02:31 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the input a couple of questions this caused me to have maybe you could clear up...  You mention the field is 110 yards long and account for that likely being that 100 meters is 110 yards but then in your commentary on rules all of the unit measures are given in yards. So I am a little confused, are the rules written and game played (and commented on) in terms of yards or meters? For example is a penalty a 5 YARD penalty or a 5 meter penalty? Or even more confusingly are the fields/downs measured in meters but other things givin in yards? Also this could possibly be due to the goal post thing, i believe an NFL field is 120 yards in total size including the end zones because of the move of the goal posts outside the end zone, thus if you exclude the defensive end zone from the total field distance available to the offense, the offensive teams field would be 110 yards in length. Of course sometimes the defensive end zone does end up being an area of valid play in the NFL (kickoffs, great punt results) but Im speculating just on the origin.  Secondly....    receivers are allowed to take a running start before the snap   Holy shit what? How does that even work? From what point in time is the receiver allowed to begin moving? At the start of the QB count? If that were the case couldn't a quickly called play allow a receiver to run for like... 20 seconds before the snap?   Are defenders against receivers (dont know technical name of this position) allowed to move as well?  Thats probably the craziest thing I've heard about the rule differences yet!  Thanks for taking time for your reply btw =]."
CFL,2z7rys,sckewer,3,Thu Mar 19 19:38:53 2015 UTC,"They're only allowed a running start behind the line of scrimmage dude. So they're allowed to start running whenever they want as long as they don't pass the line and remain on side. I am assuming your amazement was because you thought they got a 'head start' of sorts, if not kindly disregard this post."
CFL,2z7rys,OlderThanGif,2,Fri Mar 20 03:58:22 2015 UTC,No you were totally right I thought they could actually cross the line of scrimmage before the beginning of the play lol.
CFL,2z7rys,MnstrShne,1 point,Fri Mar 20 04:22:59 2015 UTC,"The downs etc. are still measured in yards, so it might be the goal post thing, after all 110 yards is actually 101 metres upon further research.  As to the recievers, technically the rule is any player who starts the play in the back field can move in any direction at any time before the snap, except for the QB.  The defenders can move as much as they want but they can't go be 1 yard of the line of scrimage or thats offside.  The rules regarding eligible recievers being on the line apply as normal, so the more you try to run your recievers up to the line the more you risk either offsiding or having them inelligible."

It is often said by Americans who have had NFL time that the CFL has surprised them. The league is populated with very very good football players, but few freaks of nature.

To add:   rouges are single points; you have incentive to run missed field goals and punts out of the end zone if you don't want to give up the point attendance is much smaller than in the US but crowds of 80,000 have occurred for championship games in large stadiums the game is fast-paced and fun - the large field and the tighter timing rules make last-minute comebacks much easier and the pace of play much quicker.

Now that the Stamps have signed a few former Riders (I think it was only three this off season, but two RBs in two years if you consider Sanders and Toston), some people are trying to make the same joke, and of course this certain someone and his cronies have the memories of goldfish when it comes to the stuff that came out of their mouths (he claims Hufnagel discovers and develops all of his talent in house, and the other teams, especially the Riders, have to resort to free agency [or signing players who have been cut], which I guess in his eyes is pilfering)."

First, yes you guys are great fans, good on ya, but you weren't always so, in great numbers I mean, and it wasn't that long ago. Have some humility will ya? Its not like you all were there all along.

They're looking at building the arena first, and then the stadium with both sharing a joint parking lot, as the Flames and Stamps generally don't have home games on the same day, unless a weird quirk in the scheduled occurs. If they're sharing a parking lot, having home games for both on the same day won't happen.   Another thing that I've been told that adds to this is that the University of Calgary is already making plans for a new, smaller football stadium for the Dinos, and once the Stampeders have moved, likely selling the land. For those that don't know, the land that the McMahon Stadium, Foothills Stadium, the Vollydome, etc, is on is owned by the UofC. From what I've been told the land is worth at least $500 million, likely more. In their more long term plans, the UofC is looking to sell the land once the Stampeders move, with (as said above) a new, smaller Stadium being build near the Olympic Oval, and beneath it would be an underground parking area."

I would imagine that all the conversions from ice-turf would impact the quality of both. Not to mention you would then run into the issue of practice facilities. The Flames would likely need to build a separate practice facility like other teams (although I would be shocked if this isn't part of the plans), or the Stampeders would have to build a practice facility for during the week. Right now they practice at McMachon, but the it likely being torn down and the land sold, they would need to build a place from scratch likely, because the only other place you would do practice would be Shouldice Park.

CFL,2y5l7e,Animal31,0,Mon Mar 9 17:57:18 2015 UTC,"Following the GM Place -> BC Place example, huh?"
CFL,2y1wkt,Old_Kendelnobie,3,Thu Mar 5 19:21:36 2015 UTC,Hopefully he still has some gas left in the tank to earn a spot.
CFL,2y1wkt,FondleOtter,3,Thu Mar 5 23:18:42 2015 UTC,"I love these ""last chance"" players. They bring talent for sure, but I think their drive sets them apart. Nothing motivates you more than the prospect of broken dreams and unemployment."

CFL,2xyqae,Animal31,3,Thu Mar 5 02:57:29 2015 UTC,"I'm honestly really hoping we make it a 10-team league in the next couple years.  Halifax or Quebec City seem like the best options, with western Ontario being a distant third."
CFL,2xyqae,theDashRendar,2,Thu Mar 5 18:34:35 2015 UTC,"Heck, yes. A 10th team would iron out so many schedule problems at once that it would almost be worth it for that reasons alone."
CFL,2xyqae,roolb,2,Wed Mar 11 04:01:20 2015 UTC,"I was all excited when I heard there was a pre-season game, because I was told we wouldn't be getting any until 2016. Now I see what the deal was, lol.  Oh well. I guess they couldn't do any because the FIFA women's world cup is going to be here, right?"
CFL,2xyqae,antonio106,1 point,Thu Mar 5 14:45:34 2015 UTC,I think the Women's WC is also why the Eskimos are playing in Fort Mac this year.
CFL,2xxz7g,dotCeh,6,Wed Mar 4 20:17:09 2015 UTC,Repairs to IGF will be done before Tim Hortons Field is complete. I'm calling it.
CFL,2xxz7g,Stach37,-2,Wed Mar 4 20:52:48 2015 UTC,"I've disliked this damn stadium since it was announced.  Stupid location, concourse is far too small, road access is pretty bad (though I will commended them on their handling of public transport to and from, now that they have the hang of it).  Beer costs more than an NFL game and as you can tell by the article, the design quality was shit.  The old Stadium had a better location, was easier to move around in, and was more exciting as weather was more of a factor.  I miss the old girl."
CFL,2xxz7g,pegcity,6,Wed Mar 4 22:42:11 2015 UTC,"As someone who lives outside of the city, I think the location is fantastic. 15 minute walk to my car and within 2 minutes I'm on the perimeter highway on my way home. The old stadium I'd be stuck in bumper-to-bumper traffic for over half an hour."
CFL,2xxz7g,RhynoSorceress,3,Wed Mar 4 23:34:06 2015 UTC,"It's amazing how much of a difference one's direction home makes.  My dad and I both live south of Mosaic Stadium and it's a quick and easy route home from where we park after the games.  Going to the north or east end after the games (like any busy time, during rush hour on a weekday especially) is a nightmare though."
CFL,2xxz7g,ponimaju,3,Thu Mar 5 23:56:35 2015 UTC,Ive parked on pembina for pretty much every game minus a few at IGF. I never have problems getting out other than the construction that was at pembina and the perimeter. The walk down chancellor is def faster than the drive.
CFL,2xx9kz,CaptainHadley,2,Wed Mar 4 17:06:25 2015 UTC,"I drafted this guy a couple years in a row in our fantasy football league. I was convinced he was going to break out, but he never did. He had a lot of promise though, and I think he could be a heck of a RB in either the CFL or NFL if given the right opportunity."
CFL,2xx9kz,bootscallahan,2,Wed Mar 4 18:33:19 2015 UTC,"Haha! I came here to say the same thing. Stephen Hill, Lamar Miller, Bernard Scott every single year. I'm glad one of them worked out."

CFL,2xwxkt,mattbin,4,Wed Mar 4 15:31:46 2015 UTC,"If you think that a start up league in Australia is going to be competitive with the CFL right away and the NFL within 5 years, saying that you're dreaming doesn't even cut it.   Looking upon it, I don't see the point to this article. ""Will Bo last until 2018?"" It's only 3 years. You might have a case if he had signed a contract in 5+ years range. For Bo to get serious attention from an NFL team, IMO, he'll have to be better than he was this past season for at least the next two years. That leaves him and the Stamps with a single year left. If he wants to take a shot and the Stamps release he, it's one year that he is being released from, big whoop.   If I was a betting man, I would put money down on Bo staying through the term of his contract. If he is making between 450-500K, that puts him in the same pay grade, I believe, as a practice roster NFL player. Unless he gets a serious shot at becoming a starter down south, I highly doubt he leaves."
CFL,2xwxkt,dotCeh,1 point,Wed Mar 4 18:48:00 2015 UTC,"I agree with everything you wrote. There was no point to this article, and it certainly didn't answer the question it raised. Not only that but speculating that he's making 450-500K is ridiculous. They said that he took a discount and Huff himself stated that he's not even among the Top 5 paid QBs in the league. Isn't the max at $400,000 anyway?"
CFL,2xwxkt,RaptorsFromSpace,1 point,Wed Mar 4 19:22:03 2015 UTC,"I don't think there's a maximum per se, but there's a functional maximum since there's a sub-$5M salary cap per team and all salaries have to fit within that cap."

CFL,2xsxp9,CaptainHadley,2,Tue Mar 3 19:46:44 2015 UTC,http://www.stampeders.com/video/index/id/108727  The conference where they announced it. He pretty much states that he doesn't want to play in the NFL and wants to stay in Calgary for the rest of his career.
CFL,2xsxp9,coelurosauravus,3,Tue Mar 3 23:36:56 2015 UTC,"He pretty much states that he doesn't want to play in the NFL and wants to stay in Calgary for the rest of his career.   I can't imagine many players outright state that they'll be looking for opportunities in the NFL but it's always there if they're good enough.  Still, he did take a discount apparently which is pretty incredible."
CFL,2xt3fd,Stach37,7,Tue Mar 3 17:48:17 2015 UTC,Former Commissioner is the Toronto Mayor...  Former Commissioner is looking like the CEO of the biggest sports conglomerate in Toronto...  The absolute perfect possible scenario for the Argos?
CFL,2xt3fd,FondleOtter,5,Tue Mar 3 17:52:04 2015 UTC,I sure hope so. It would be so nice I'd the whole argos stadium issue would just resolve
CFL,2xt3fd,Canadave,2,Tue Mar 3 17:53:06 2015 UTC,"As a Leafs fan, I sure hope this works out. Cohon was a great commissioner for the CFL, and MLSE is sorely in need of some stable, competent leadership to help support the improvements that have gone on in the Leafs' front office."
CFL,2xqaye,Old_Kendelnobie,7,Tue Mar 3 00:24:08 2015 UTC,"I don't understand why January is held so highly by the media. If you watch all his plays he will get beat on a quarter of them. He's always been one of the most overrated players in the league and I really don't get where it's coming from.   Is he one of the best o-lineman on the bombers? Yes.  Is he in the top 10 for lineman in the west? No.  Top 15? Probably still no.  I can see him being a top priority for the bombers to re-sign, but he's not a top 6 free agent league-wide and certainly not the number one."
CFL,2xqaye,skippy2893,1 point,Tue Mar 3 05:15:40 2015 UTC,Bombers have no use for him anymore.
CFL,2xqaye,RhynoSorceress,4,Tue Mar 3 14:58:41 2015 UTC,Surprised no one had picked up Curran yet.
CFL,2xqaye,RhynoSorceress,3,Tue Mar 3 02:00:51 2015 UTC,"Bombers need help big time at LB, might be asking for too much money I guess."
CFL,2xqaye,Thesmarks,3,Tue Mar 3 14:59:27 2015 UTC,Pleasd re-sign Grant cats. He's an excellent threat in our receiving core. It makes me think he wants more of a #1 role the fact he hasn't re-signed
CFL,2xqaye,mattbin,2,Tue Mar 3 14:27:49 2015 UTC,"I think they're already looking good for receivers and they aren't willing to bump Grant's pay. They're probably offering him low money and he's shopping around to see if he can get a better deal.  That said, I really hope he's back with the Cats this year. Other than Tasker he was the #1 free agent I hoped would return."
CFL,2xqaye,Thesmarks,2,Tue Mar 3 19:11:02 2015 UTC,"Grant is just reliable guy too. Tasker shows some signs of injury (head injuries) and Fantuz is likely to miss a few games for something, no offence to him. You're probably right though, he's fishing around, but losing Ellingson (who was hurt a lot too but played well), and Grant would be a bummer."
CFL,2xqaye,biga204,2,Wed Mar 4 06:45:57 2015 UTC,Really hoping the Bombers sign Sears again. Not looking good though.
CFL,2xqaye,ConqueringCanada,3,Tue Mar 3 01:01:08 2015 UTC,He's taking his chance with the NFL. If he doesn't get any bites he might be back. Heard they were close before he decided to make one last attempt down south.   Would love him back. Keep the rest on the list.
CFL,2xqaye,biga204,2,Tue Mar 3 03:08:44 2015 UTC,I still have a soft spot for January because he made Winnipeg his home but I get not bringing him back.
CFL,2xqaye,ConqueringCanada,2,Tue Mar 3 04:17:19 2015 UTC,"I agree. I wouldn't mind if we brought him back to compete for a job. Obviously, the price has to be right and I don't know if that can happen."

CFL,2xqap3,RaptorsFromSpace,2,Tue Mar 3 01:37:26 2015 UTC,Guessing they're hoping Harris can stay healthy this year and whoever they have as backup(s) are good enough.

CFL,2xogw8,alternatesubmitter,2,Mon Mar 2 17:54:50 2015 UTC,That signing could not have been more hyped.  Austin waaaay over paid him and burnt us good when he traded him back.  I wouldn't be upset if signed him at a fair price though.
