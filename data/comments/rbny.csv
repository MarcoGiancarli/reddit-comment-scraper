rbny,3e7lqa,UpTheAnteRazov,2,Wed Jul 22 16:02:52 2015 UTC,That's great thanks.  Seems like it won't take long on the train at all. I'm not really bothered about where I sit either so I'll wait for a bit before buying tickets.
rbny,3e4se4,jrocket121,2,Tue Jul 21 23:21:10 2015 UTC,"Update from Empire of Soccer: ""For their part, the Red Bulls are not ready to give up on their leading scorer. In fact, it wouldn’t be a surprise if, come a similar situation, it is Wright-Phillips lining up the next crucial penalty kick for the team.  “Obviously now that’s the third one that doesn’t go in for him, but I don’t want for him to waiver in his confidence,” Marsch said. “I want him to know how important he is to our team, and the belief we all have in him, so I know he’s hurting bad, but he’ll recover and he’ll be fine."""
rbny,3e4se4,UpTheAnteRazov,12,Wed Jul 22 13:23:32 2015 UTC,"PK's are such a crap shoot. Keeper dives the wrong way, and BWP looks like a genius. Keeper dives the right way, BWP sucks and should be sat. Pick a spot and hit it hard, the rest is mostly luck.  Granted he has looked frustrated for a few games, but it is truly amazing how quickly you all forget what he is capable of and what he has done for us. Despite this, BWP is still our current leader in goals and assists. We should try something new, like supporting our best players through rough patches instead of turning on them at the drop of a hat."
rbny,3e4se4,austinshepard13,5,Wed Jul 22 03:03:12 2015 UTC,"Because Thierry Henry can't feed him a perfect ball for a tap in on a penalty...  Because the last time either of the Wright-Phillips brothers put together a good individual run of form (read: without relying on world class players to pick up their slack), Sylvain Distin was on MCFC...  I love our team, but their is some crazy revisionist history about BWP. BWP won the Golden Boot last year with 27 goals, however, that does not change the fact that he blew tons of incredible chances created for him by Henry. He should have had 40 or 50 goals with the amazing passes he was being fed.  10 years ago he probably could have been a top MLS striker. That is simply not the case anymore. The league is growing and he is too inconsistent. We have a bigger, stronger, faster, and from the looks of it, more skillful striker (Abang) that I would much rather invest in."
rbny,3e4se4,bassedinpton,-1,Wed Jul 22 01:42:58 2015 UTC,"This. I cant stand that he got dp money. Its like the coaching staff and gm didnt even watch games last year. The guy scores 1 out of every 5 chances he gets in a game if that. Hes not a natural finisher. I wish Marsch would get Abang in more games cause Im sick of watching BWP moping around the field and yelling and waving his hands at his teammates all game, when he cant finish a shot to save his life."
rbny,3e4se4,kjabs87,4,Wed Jul 22 02:45:40 2015 UTC,Because hes a fucking head case. Expect another scoring draught.
rbny,3e4se4,MSGuyute,-2,Tue Jul 21 23:50:36 2015 UTC,Maybe Jesse will try BWP as a DM or keeper this time while he pouts and listens to whatever the grime equivalent of emo is...
rbny,3e4se4,pi69y,11,Wed Jul 22 00:27:52 2015 UTC,"It's accepted knowledge in some soccer circles that you should never have someone take a 2nd PK in the same game after they miss the first try. BWP tried again, and failed. I assume it was still weighing on his mind today.  BWP took over for Henry after Henry messed up a PK... maybe Kljestan should be the new PK taker going forward, temporarily at least."

The pointlessness was the injury coming so late in a game already dominated by RB. With Duvall on such an ascent, I'd personally rather someone be subbed in at the 60' or so - if not at the half.   Pulling assets after the win is probable is one of the main strategic uses of subs and it was, IMO, pointless to have Duvall still in so late.   We stuck around after to try to find out what the injury was but even our sales rep didn't yet know. It was not a worthwhile loss at that moment. Some are. And the Cosmos were getting more and more physical as the minutes ticked on..."

Zubar is expensive, but coming into the year it made sense to pay him that. Not knowing he wasn't ever going to actually play.

rbny,3df4tw,anotherdarkstranger,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:18:25 2015 UTC,figures. the one closest to my area
rbny,3df05u,G1n5eng,2,Wed Jul 15 19:25:22 2015 UTC,Fuckity fuck they need an editor.  Good news on Duvall though. Hopefully he doesn't try to push the recovery too soon and screw himself over.
rbny,3df05u,The_Metrist,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:04:22 2015 UTC,Amen to both.  The news can be great from Big Apple but the editing and not to mention that website really detract from the whole experience.
rbny,3dewkk,Pakaru,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:00:32 2015 UTC,"Really good to see that while they might not be investing in the big team right now they are still investing in the future.  That strategy might actually pay off when later in the year you need some fresh legs, you can call up guys from the academy to get some time with the first team for some experience."
rbny,3dewkk,mystrymaster,2,Thu Jul 16 14:31:42 2015 UTC,This gives us a big advantage moving forward and it's what MLS needs to start upping the quality of the average player.
rbny,3dewkk,kmurphy246,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:34:15 2015 UTC,Definitely. But that also doesnt mean we shouldn't also supplement these players with premier players from foreign leagues.
rbny,3dewkk,kmurphy246,2,Thu Jul 16 01:48:39 2015 UTC,I agree wholeheartedly
rbny,3dewkk,cronaldo45,2,Thu Jul 16 01:50:01 2015 UTC,I grew up learning from Red Bull trainers. Very professional people.
rbny,3dewkk,take_a_bow_son,3,Wed Jul 15 22:16:22 2015 UTC,"Granted I'm a bit of a youth soccer nut thanks to years of FM/just following the sport, but it's stuff like our academy that's going to let us thrive even with Papa Red Bull cutting back spending in recent years. We've got plenty of potentially MLS caliber talent in the system, probably 10+ players capable of playing professionally graduating in the next two/three years. Not everyone will necessarily be Miazga or Agudelo, but having access to such an excess of quality young talent is something most teams just don't have in MLS and gives us a serious advantage going forward."
rbny,3dewkk,take_a_bow_son,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:26:00 2015 UTC,"GK: Castano  LB: Lawrence  CB: Miazga   CB: Adams (Ouimette has potential too)  RB: Duvall  LM: Etienne  CDM: Davis   CDM: ? (please no more Felipe)  RM: Obekop  CAM: Stolz  ST: Abang  Hypothetically, in 4-5 years, this is pretty cool. Not all of these are youth guys, but quite a few have more experience and would likely play over the academy players for a while. Plus we can always count on another African talent snipe"
rbny,3dfs7v,NewYorkRedBulls,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:46:00 2015 UTC,Your user name and flair confuses me.
rbny,3dfs7v,take_a_bow_son,3,Thu Jul 16 20:14:10 2015 UTC,"would have liked to rate Ali Curtis, jaycohen, and pakaru"
rbny,3dfs7v,MILKDAY,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:04:29 2015 UTC,Interesting to see some of the results in there  In addition to dream signing I would have liked a realistic signing  because the red bulls are not getting Khedira in any way shape or form ha
rbny,3dfs7v,mystrymaster,5,Thu Jul 16 14:14:20 2015 UTC,"Alright who the fuck put Lebron James as their dream signing, because that made me laugh."
rbny,3dfs7v,blobman2000,5,Thu Jul 16 04:54:44 2015 UTC,"Which seven of you nutjobs gave Dax a 4? Dude's playing as well as he has in his career, and consistently."
rbny,3dfs7v,iced1776,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:56:36 2015 UTC,Oh shit that was me I was on mobile. Just take each of my answers and x2!
rbny,3dfs7v,MSGuyute,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:36:57 2015 UTC,How do you see the results?  E: Never mind
rbny,3dfs7v,KTBFFHCFC,2,Thu Jul 16 03:26:45 2015 UTC,"Alright, who gave everybody 4's lol?"
rbny,3dal74,mkbloodyen,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:01:21 2015 UTC,why is this a stickied post?

rbny,3dal74,samugolinifirenze,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:42:05 2015 UTC,"Actually its with YANMAR, Red Bull isn't a ""partnership"" since they kinda own the team."
rbny,3dal74,samugolinifirenze,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:42:46 2015 UTC,"less sad, but still sad, every time i hear Metrostars i die"
rbny,3dal74,Montauket,11,Sat Jul 18 17:43:59 2015 UTC,"Am I the only person who appreciates have a 'bull and a bayer' pun as our sponsor? You know, like bull and bear, like stock market outlooks...  c'mon /u/drunkeneconomist back me up on this one man! It's clever!"
rbny,3dal74,mattyrapps,2,Wed Jul 15 14:38:23 2015 UTC,"Strictly thinking NJ corporations, The only companies I think that would be bigger than this would be getting Panasonic to sponsor us? OR to have Prudential come into a more long term partnership? Jersey kids let me know."
rbny,3dal74,G1n5eng,8,Tue Jul 14 23:53:47 2015 UTC,"I thought this was a partnership with Bayer Leverkusen and I got really confused, considering RB owns a German team.  For any other confused people, this is a partnership with the drug company Bayer."
rbny,3dal74,AnthonyNice,7,Tue Jul 14 20:37:19 2015 UTC,Doesn't drug Bayer own soccer Bayer?
rbny,3dal74,G1n5eng,5,Tue Jul 14 22:44:58 2015 UTC,"well shit, they do.  I figured that since Red Bull had to name Leipzig ""RasenBallsport"" rather than ""RedBull"" that would be impossible.  Learn something new everyday."
rbny,3dal74,midnight_thunder,7,Tue Jul 14 23:04:42 2015 UTC,Grandfathered in.
rbny,3dal74,davebozo,12,Tue Jul 14 23:21:54 2015 UTC,Hopefully this means more money for DPs
rbny,3dal74,HolyTurd,11,Tue Jul 14 20:07:45 2015 UTC,"Ahhh, mister funny guy over here"
rbny,3dal74,Pakaru,6,Tue Jul 14 20:28:36 2015 UTC,"I mean, theoretically this should also result in some allocation money (Garber$$$). At least, that's how jersey sponsorships work."
rbny,3dal74,Biscuitt,2,Tue Jul 14 21:10:49 2015 UTC,More Garbucks for us
