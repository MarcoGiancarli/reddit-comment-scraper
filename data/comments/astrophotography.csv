Stacked and processed in pixinsight, residual noise removed with noiseware.  As the title says, just a quick test to see how much of the red zone light pollution the filter could knock down, and I have to say I'm quite impressed with it.  I could expose for twice as long as I could without it before hitting the skyfog limit.  Only issue I had on this target was that it killed a lot of the orange/red (since its a lp filter after all).  Since the skyglow was so bright, and my iso so high, and the exposure so short, I basically had no red in the histogram.  After removing most of the green cast from the filter and from the debayered image, I wasn't left with much color, heh.  I'll try again using a lower ISO and a higher exposure.  I'm also new to pixinsight so I'm not the greatest yet at bringing back color into the stacked images I get.  Hope to upgrade to a modified camera at some point as well, which will allow more red hopefully.  What will really help is that the city center lies to my east, right where Andromeda is currently rising.  Later in the fall/winter Andromeda will be to my west, which is only a yellow zone, so I'll probably have a lot more luck gathering more color info that I was able to in the red zone.  All in all though the LP filter made a huge difference, allowing me to expose for almost twice as long as I could before in that washed out red zone.  I'll try some targets to my west where its only a yellow zone and how it works there next."

Luminance: Deconvolution was carried out using a dynamic PSF, range mask and star mask to help enhance the dust structures toward the center of the galaxy. Histogram transformation was then carried out to a place I was happy with and HDR multiscale transform used to reduce the core brightness (I think I used 8 layers for this). Curves transformation was then used to further edit the histogram, and a light TGVDenoise to reduce the noise. ACDNR was then used to further help the noise on the background areas.   Colour: SCNR was used to reduce the green levels. The histogram was then transformed and the saturation on the galaxy increased using the same range mask we created earlier.

The weather here has been deplorable, so it took about a month and a half to get four good-enough nights to capture the data for this.  The Iris is a unique nebula with a considerable blue reflection from the inner star cluster, as well as a nice dark nebula surrounding the bright center.  I'm pretty happy with the data here, but really suffered from dew issues during acquisition, which is something I will absolutely have to address before I start on a new target.  Since my exposure times are so long now, satellites (and other space junk) aren't uncommon (as shown in this image).  But, once again because since my exposures are so long, I don't have enough other frames to effectively eliminate these faint lines in stacking.  What happens is if I adjust the high rejection mark to eliminate the satellites, I end up losing good data too.  Once I back off the high clipping to preserve the data, the satellites return.   I learned an interesting PixInsight trick to assist with this and essentially make the satellites much easier to eliminate.  It basically amounts to drawing a heavy feathered line over the satellite in the source image and using this image in the stack.  The new line is so dramatic that rejection is a gimme, even with few frames.  PixelMath can be used as follows using a single expression, where the arguments to d2seg are the x,y start and end coordinates, and where ""r =""  represents half the desired line width.  (i.e. r=2 makes a line of width 4)  d = d2seg( 3268, 11, 3352, 183 ); iif( d <= r, $T*d/r + ~(d/r), $T )  Symbols: d, r = 2  This allowed me to retain a lot of frames that I may have otherwise decided to toss.  I'm curious to know if anyone else knows tricks to assist with this!  I can't say enough about how pleased I am with the STF-8300M camera, and the off-axis guiding system using the QHY5L-II.  My guiding holds under 0.50 arcseconds now very consistently, and I've never been so happy with the star shapes.  I am unbelievably excited to try to stretch everything a bit further next time!

astrophotography,3dyn1y,yawg6669,2,Mon Jul 20 16:31:15 2015 UTC,Excellent work man.  Does windsorized sigma clipping not take care of satellites for you?  Works for me just fine.
astrophotography,3dyn1y,yawg6669,2,Mon Jul 20 16:51:59 2015 UTC,"Thanks!  Winsorized didn't do it, for some reason.  I mean, it's not like the lines were retained in their entirety, but they were present enough to drive me a little nuts.  And again, I could eliminate them completely by bringing down the high clip level, but I'd lose good nebula data in the process.  Drawing a line over them made it easier to eliminate them with less aggressive clipping.  (Hey, and by the way, I did some 30 minute test frames the other night at your suggestion.  Oh man... so good!)"

astrophotography,3dyn1y,iBaconized,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:20:07 2015 UTC,Brilliant picture and awesome post!  Edit regarding satellite problem: Doesn't the Clipping take care of this? Each pixel stack is looked at and if you have a satellite in one of the stacks frames it should be clipped anyway without the need of d2seg.
astrophotography,3dyn1y,iBaconized,2,Mon Jul 20 16:35:59 2015 UTC,"Thank you very much!  The clipping could take care of the satellites if I adjusted the level properly, but the problem was at this level, I'd lose a sizable amount of good data from the nebula too... don't want to do that!  Drawing a line over the satellites made it easier to reject them using less aggressive clipping levels, which allowed me to preserve the good stuff.  Part of the issue is surely due to the small stacks I used (7 frames for R and G, 8 for B).  I'm certain these lines would have been easier to eliminate with larger stacks.  ...or maybe I'm doing something terribly wrong when I stack lol"
astrophotography,3dyn1y,changetip,2,Mon Jul 20 16:56:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah I think I understand what you mean and I am no where near a professional level so I can judge what is better or not but I think the clipping will erase the satellite without the loss of data.  Think about it like that, the sigma clipping makes a stack of the same pixel of each frame. Then it throws out those pixels that are different from the others by a certain value (sigma value you enter).   That means from my point of view:   It will reject the satellite cause it only appears on one frame of the stack and so has a high sigma deviation It will not remove any good data casue it is very similar on each frame (low sigma) and therefore will not be rejected."

The spots where the stars are covered in the black cosmic dust, is that just because the nebula is closer than the stars?   Yup, that's exactly right.  The cosmic clouds are so dense that they absorb or block all the light of the stars behind it, and produce very little reflection as a result."

This has the effect of removing the wavy and blurry effects of atmospheric distortion, kind of like hubble being above the atmosphere.  You get a much clearer image this way.  Then you touch up the final image using something like wavelet sharpening to bring out the subtle details.  That said, on the very rare crystal clear night it can look almost this good through the eyepice as well.  About a month ago I had one of these nights viewing through my C8, and it was breathtaking."

Unfortunately the first rule in the posting guidelines forbids landscapes and the mods are very nazi about it:   Astrophotography refers to images of astronomical objects or phenomena exclusively. Man-made objects and people are not to be included in the image, other than satellites which are the subject of the image. Terrain should be limited to that which is necessary to show the astronomical object, such as a widefield shot of the milky way above the ground. (MILKY WAY SHOTS EXCLUSIVELY) Images should be cropped to the best of your ability to avoid excess landscape. Images of any other objects which violate either of these constraints will be removed.    A rule that takes a lot of fun and information out of this sub. I love to include landscape in many of my constellation shots as it gives some scale for the viewer on the size of the objects. Sadly those kind of pictures can not be posted here."

Landscapeastro has a wealth of info and highly knowledgable subscribers."
astrophotography,3dy4i6,Bersonic,3,Mon Jul 20 18:29:16 2015 UTC,"Karma doesn't really interest me (less than 7000 points in five years, yay!), I just see the divide between /r/astrophotography and /r/LandscapeAstro unnecessary, or at least the strictness of the first rule unfortunate. It just restricts the diversity so much and takes certain kind of very informative pictures away from here.   How can you show proper pictures of meteor showers, Zodiacal light or Gegenschein without any ground visible? Living at 61°N means that many interesting objects and constellations spend most of the year near horizon, but those pictures are forbidden here because of the landscape that is part of the picture.  I'm not against the mods enforcing the rules, just saying that the strictness of the first rule forbids a lot of beautiful and educational content that I'd love to see here. APOD isn't restricted to just pictures of galaxies and the moon, I'd love to see more that kind of content here too."
astrophotography,3dy4i6,sissipaska,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:55:09 2015 UTC,"Hmm. I dont shoot the southern milky way because I can't see most of it. Just like southern astronomers don't shoot pics of m31. Not really sure what your point is there.   /r/astrophotography is NOT APOD. While the two aren't mutually exclusive, much of the content APOD shares is very tangentally related to astronomy. APOD is more of a science pic of the day that usually has something to do with astronomy, but SPODTUHSTDWA has less ring to it. /r/ap is a place for people to share and learn about hard space photography. If the subject isn't space, it doesn't belong here. Shooting a pic of the milky way and purposefully placing a dead tree at the center of the frame is not what we're going for. By adding landscape you are moving away from astrophotography, and into artsy landscape photography with an astronomy element."
astrophotography,3dy4i6,Bersonic,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:40:46 2015 UTC,"Of course APOD is not the same /r/astrophotography, I just used it as an example of what generally falls under astronomic photography. And for me astronomy is about the world, our place in it. I find observing nightsky really fascinating and love sharing it with others, either face to face with facts (hey, look, that's Jupiter over there!) or on the web with pictures (hey, this is what Zodiacal light looks like!). For me astronomy is very much about learning, but also about teaching others. I love seeing what people can see and photograph around the world, but also what might be hard at other places.   I just find the first rule very restricting. No Zodiacal light, Auroras, ISS or comets if they happen to be near horizon.  Hell, even most of the fascinating images ESO's Yuri Beletsky takes at the Atacama desert would be banned here. Just because there's ground in them."

But /r/ap isn't the place for that, at least not intentianally. It wasn't created as a place to see cool space pics, spaceporn was already that. /r/ap was created as a place to learn about and discuss deep sky photography and planetary photography. Milky Way shots at the time fell under ""landscape photography."" A few years ago we started allowing more and more wide field shots. It quickly got out of hand, because people were posting too many ""dead tree with star trails"" shots, and the focus drifted.   Yuri Beletsky's work, while neat, is not the kind of photography we are referring to in the ""/r/astrophotography"". The focus is less on the stars and science, and more about using them as the ascetic backdrop of ESA's various sites."

There was a lot of cloning to do as it was half hazy/cloudy but luck was in my hands as none of it touched the milky way. The tree was literally right at the edge of the frame there cutting off some of the milky way and unfortunately I was on a lake so I couldn't just position myself different.

astrophotography,3dy4i6,greenasinapple,3,Mon Jul 20 15:52:01 2015 UTC,How do you like the 12mm? I have the 24mm with my 6D and I really like it. Here is my average attempt overlooking Squam Lake http://i.imgur.com/kWQi8WNh.jpg Sunapee is probably a little darker than near the lakes.
astrophotography,3dy4i6,sissipaska,2,Mon Jul 20 17:21:19 2015 UTC,"Wow, what a great photo. That sky is breath taking. Sunappe is almost pitch black depending which way you're looking at the lake and where you are in location to the main road. Like I said before, conditions weren't ideal as it just rained and there were still some light clouds throughout the sky.   The rokinon though, well it's alright. Let me start by saying it's definitely a $250 lens. It get's a lot of noise and the manual focus is easily it's biggest draw back. Usually if it's too bright out to see the LCD well to focus or I don't have the time, I just crank it to f16 and shoot a high iso and guestimate the focal length. At that point though it loses quality. It vignette's really hard at 2.8 but that and the distortion can all be fixed in LR. I'd buy it again though, just knowing well before the drawbacks of it.  Do you like your 24mm?"
astrophotography,3dy4i6,sissipaska,2,Mon Jul 20 17:51:17 2015 UTC,"The manual focus on the Rokinon 24mm is the same as the 12mm. I try and get to my spot early on and just use the live view on a bright star or distant light and tape the lens once I have it the way I want it. I've been meaning to just mark infinity on the lens, but I haven't got around to that yet. Overall the 24mm is a great lens. I have only noticed a very minor amount of aberration at f/1.4 and almost none at f/2.0.  I usually start all my shots of the Milky Raw with the same settings for that lens (20"", f/1.4, ISO 6400 or 3200) and view the histogram to determine if my settings will be fine for that night/lighting."
astrophotography,3dy4i6,sissipaska,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:05:09 2015 UTC,Ïs your lens the 12/2.8 fisheye or the 12/2.0 rectilinear? If the latter one I'd be really interested to see how it works on the 6D as to my knowledge it's a lens meant for crop sensors.

astrophotography,3dzjtc,michael1026,2,Tue Jul 21 00:16:27 2015 UTC,"Absolutely. I shot this last year with a stock DSLR: http://astrob.in/full/130567/0/  The reason I switched to a mono-CCD wasn't because I felt limited in the targets I could capture, but because it is very hot and humid where I live and I wanted the set-point cooling of the sensor for noise control. It would cost a chunk of change to modify my DSLR with a cooler, so I just saved up for a camera that already had one.   I actually like the color I got in last years version better, but I'm still pretty new with the whole mono versus one-shot color transition, so hopefully, in time, I'll figure that out. :)  Cheers!"

astrophotography,3dznyq,Joelsfallon,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:59:30 2015 UTC,"We shot a couple globular clusters that night as well, along with the moon, but couldn't get the saturn shot to turn out that great.  The observatory we were at is in the downtown core so there is a ton of light pollution and atmospheric disturbance :("
astrophotography,3dznyq,prjindigo,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:12:11 2015 UTC,"This is anecdotal and merely sharing experience subjectively.  Sometimes a polarizing filter can help with this to reduce that ""boiling water"" distortion but it will also greatly reduce the amount of light.   Long time back we used to use a pair of polarized filters that threaded onto each other so we could turn one against the other to reduce total light so if its an observatory one's gonna be banging around in some drawer someplace.   ""lunar filter polarized pair"" some such.  We need to have the info about the scope, camera and duration of the image and if you used an eyepiece, barlow, telemultiplier/extender etc etc.  My suspicion is that Saturn is simply beyond the location's reliable capture without a much higher sensitivity camera with much shorter exposures.   (or much shallower atmosphere, as close to overhead as possible ftw)  You can see the same boiling water distortion in my pic from early spring, this was taken from a red zone in florida with ""ok"" disturbance with my AT6RC.  I took this shot to calibrate the maximum I could push the telescope and camera to.  At 225x I seem to be a touch past the atmosphere.   Polarization would get rid of photons boiling in one axis across the image and would have then caused me to have to take multiple images and stack them. (mind you this is a $2500 camera on a 6"" reflector that performs as well as most really good 100mm APO scopes)  https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B2G1DIsSJshiem1JNkt5MlRlX2M/view?usp=sharing (AT6RC f9 epp 6mm (225x) plossl deep projection resulting in ~780x final , STF8300C@-21C, under 2 seconds exposure, CGEM-DX pHd2 ST-i on f13.9 at 2fps tracking)  It is theoretically possible to use some kind of uniform rotation of a polarizing filter on a camera then do a thousand frames on each 5° rotation of the filter till it reaches 90 degrees... but that's a LOT of work and would still require manual mosaic of the ""perfect bits"".    I doubt that sitting all night with stackert or some other program will gain more than 10% improvement in that atmosphere.     Reducing the magnification to shorten the exposure length WILL help, so will a finer resolution camera.  Neither is worth the $$ to follow up on if this was a prime-focus shot."

astrophotography,3dz2om,mrdobing,2,Mon Jul 20 18:25:47 2015 UTC,"Awesome,    Try this again with 10 or so pictures (light frames). Then put your lens cap on, take another 5 pictures with the same settings. This will create your dark frames.  Put something neutral white over the lens and take another 5 snaps. This will be your flats. Now put your lens cap back on and crank your shutter speed to the fastest it will go. Take a couple for the bias frames. Download Deep Sky Stacker, drag your files in batches into the program, it will ask what kind of frames you are importing. Select the right type (e.g. light/dark/flat/bias).   You'd be better off finding some youtube vids  to show the process in DSS but it is quite simple :)  Basically, you register your picture and tweak settings to detect the number of stars. It will subract your dark/flat etc automatically here. Once you stack you should end up with a very nice sharp and detailed image. Here you can play with the histogram to get your LRGB channels correct before exporting the pic.   I'm a newbie still but I hope this helps in some way mate."

astrophotography,3dve9b,ate6753O9,3,Sun Jul 19 21:17:01 2015 UTC,"Maybe I'll post a sub, but it's essentially non-existent. The only reason you know it's there is because you can see the absence of stars where you know the nebula is.  This particular object is in a really golden portion of the Milky Way in the constellation Aquila. You'll notice the sky isn't really black or even dark in the image, and if you looked up other pictures of it you can see what this area of the sky looks like.  However, other dark nebulae that aren't in this area end up being more brownish in the processing and the brown is contrasted against the dark sky, but it can be difficult to separate from the background particularly if there is weak signal and a lot of noise in the image.  It really requires a dark sky to adequately shoot dark targets like this. This picture was shot 5 hours from a Bortle 1 sky and 8 hours from a Bortle 2 sky.  Thanks for looking,  -Neil"

astrophotography,3dtlgs,ignoble-savage,2,Sun Jul 19 09:33:02 2015 UTC,Great shot! Could you explain the gain that you get from stacking the photos? Is it just a case of noise reduction? It would be really interesting if you could post the difference between stacking vs no stacking.
astrophotography,3dtlgs,rnclark,6,Sun Jul 19 12:26:26 2015 UTC,"Sorry, this analogy is incorrect.  When you stack, you are adding or averagign more light.  Whether you add or average produces the same results: improving signal-to-noise ratio, and you do that ONLY by collecting more photons.  Better analogy is to set the bucked out in the rain for one minute, empty it out into a bucket in your house, put it out for another minute, etc.  Then in the house measure how much is in the big bucket and divide by the number of exposures to get the average amount per minute exposure.  You still collected all that water."
astrophotography,3dtlgs,rnclark,2,Sun Jul 19 13:43:35 2015 UTC,"You improve the signal to noise ratio but you are not producing more signal. Don't you agree ?    No.  Multiple exposures IS accumulating more signal.  The signal-to-noise ratio is the square root of the total photons collected (plus read and thermal noise with is very small).  So when you stack and improve S/N, you do so by accumulating more photons.   Let me try an example: 5 shorter 10 minute exposures stacked will have less noise but will not resolve as many dim objects as a single 50 minute exposure with the same imaging platform.    The total light collected will be the same in the two cases.  The ONLY thing that will be different will be the read noise contribution.  But read noise is usually swamped by noise from thermal dark current, sky (airglow+light pollution).  In practice it would be very very difficult to see any difference, especially with modern cameras.  Another factor is the many short exposures can reject satellites, airplanes and cosmic ray hit very well, so in general the multiple long exposure will produce the better image.    But there is more data in the longer exposure.    Not from the deep sky object.  What matters is total added exposure time.  If total exposure time is the same, the total light collected from the subject is the same."
astrophotography,3dtlgs,tashabasha,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:04:18 2015 UTC,"My message still stands though. Stacking is no substitute for a higher exposure. You improve the signal to noise ratio but you are not producing more signal. Don't you agree ? Let me try an example: 5 shorter 10 minute exposures stacked will have less noise but will not resolve as many dim objects as a single 50 minute exposure with the same imaging platform.   No, stacking images is producing more signal.  Your 50 minute exposure is going to be so swamped with ""bad"" signal that you won't be able to process it.  I'd much rather have 5 10-minute exposures than 1 50-minute exposure.  Find the optimal exposure time based on your conditions, take multiple exposures at the optimal exposure time, and then stack those images."

astrophotography,3dtlgs,canadian1296,2,Sun Jul 19 16:51:35 2015 UTC,"I think it's because we are about two-thirds of the way from the centre of the galaxy. We can look toward the centre and see most of it, even if we aren't seeing the part that is behind us.   In this picture, you can see how looking toward the centre from where we are puts the large majority of the galaxy in view."
astrophotography,3dtlgs,AgentSQUiSh,2,Sun Jul 19 20:12:08 2015 UTC,How do we know the milky way looks like that if we're inside of it?
astrophotography,3dtlgs,canadian1296,2,Sun Jul 19 17:28:06 2015 UTC,"I had no idea, but I did look into it.   To summarize what I found:    We know it's more or less a flat disk because of what we see when we look across it. We also see a bulge in the centre, which other spiral galaxies have as well.  We can observe the velocity of stars and gas in the galaxy, and see the overall motion compares to that of other spiral galaxies.  We can determine there are 4 main ""arms"" to the spiral shape.   All the pictures you'll see are artistic renderings, and are educated guesses. We know the general shape of the galaxy, but not exactly how it would look from outside of it. I highly recommend checking out the sources I got this information from, they explain it much better than I do.   Sources:  Specifics of the spiral shape (Wikipedia)  How do we know the Milky Way is a spiral galaxy?  How many arms?"

astrophotography,3dtlgs,rnclark,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:35:30 2015 UTC,"I agree.  The night sky, stars, and the Milky Way are not blue, especially this deep blue.

It is a popular look these days, but very unnatural."

astrophotography,3duoqq,yawg6669,2,Sun Jul 19 19:14:41 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your kind words.  I know there are a lot of pictures of the moon around here but I'm really happy with how this one came out.  I'm only 2 months into my astro journey so I'm not sure I can recommend an AVX 6 or 8.  What type of mount are you using now?  My first impression of the AVX mount wasn't good because I received a defective unit. Neither the RA or DEC motors would connect to the hand remote. (If this happens to you, make sure you have the DEC motor cable attached.  It comes with the mount but it's not mentioned in the instructions.)  Celestron and B&H  were quick with a replacement but it wasn't an ideal experience.  Second, once I received my replacement, I found that the lock nut that secures the counterweight bar was binding.  I discovered this while slewing DEC.  It would move for a bit and suddenly stop.  After speaking to Celestron support again, I found that ""That shouldn't happen,"" and I needed to buy a 3/4"" OD washer to correct the issue.  I did... and finally... I was able to use the mount.   My next surprise came when I mistakenly thought I could use EQMOD to operate the mount from my laptop.  I learned I had to use NexRemote to control the mount and NexHub if I wanted to make more than one ASCOM connection to it.  NexRemote is free.  NexHub is $50.  It's only $50 but I wasn't thrilled about the discovery.  I hesitate to give my opinion about the mount's tracking ability as I have yet to successfully polar align it.  Until I do, I blame any negative experience with GoTo or tracking on operator error.  I don't have experience with any other mounts so it's hard to say if this is ""bad"" or simply part of the learning process.  Now that I have gotten this far I'm optimistic that I'll have success in the future.  Fingers crossed.  :)"

If you take flat and dark frames, that would help much more than you might think. Also, your integrated exposure time is just 2.5 minutes. If you want a better picture, you just need much more pictures. It seems you are not tracking the night sky. Do you have your camera just on a tripod? Even with that you can make amazing pictures if you take enough frames:  I took those pictures without any tracking and exposures around 3 seconds, just like you:  https://www.reddit.com/r/astrophotography/comments/2vka4f/lovejoy_meets_andromeda/  https://www.reddit.com/r/astrophotography/comments/2wnbv0/orion_untracked/  You simply have to take hundreds of frames. You asked for a tutorial on post-processing, but I would recommend you to get much better data first. Learning post-processing is very frustrating otherwise."
astrophotography,3dtmwo,N_las,2,Sun Jul 19 10:37:28 2015 UTC,Yeah I'm not tracking. I wish. I do have dark frames and perhaps I had too many because when it all processed in DSS everything was black no matter what I did so I feel maybe it was too many darks. If I have clear skies tonight I might give it another stab
astrophotography,3dtmwo,N_las,2,Sun Jul 19 14:30:19 2015 UTC,"You can't negatively influence your image by to many dark frames. After a while adding dark frames doesn't have any further positive effect anymore, but it can't destroy the image.   Do you happen to have such a ""black"" image from DDS? Can you post it?  If skies are clear, the most important thing is to take more exposures than with your last try.  Also, it looks like the images you posted are further post-processed with DDS. Can you save the stacking result as 32-bit without applying changes to the image? (While saving you can check to apply changes or not)"
astrophotography,3dtmwo,N_las,2,Sun Jul 19 14:39:32 2015 UTC,The image was just black no matter what adjustments I made so I didn't save it. I still have those dark files I can throw on my Google drive in a little bit when I get back to my apartment. I regret not taking like 100 pictures so bad. I thought I had enough
astrophotography,3dtmwo,N_las,2,Sun Jul 19 14:55:20 2015 UTC,"If people track and guid and make 10-minute long exposures, than a few pictures are really enough. But if you take just 3sec exposures, you need to make as many as possible. Even 100 pictures won't be that many. That would be just 5 minutes worth of exposure.  Are you shooting RAW? How many RAW pictures fit on your memory card? Do you have to make each exposure manually, or can you set your camera up and make them automatically?  Every so often? Maybe every 200-300 frames or so, you need to move your camera to recenter M31 in the frame. But no worries, DDS can deal with that.   What version of DDS are you using, can you load in the images directly in RAW format? (In older versions that was not always possible)"
astrophotography,3dqahw,zsanderson3,7,Sat Jul 18 12:10:07 2015 UTC,"Details:    Telescope: Orion SkyView Pro 8"" Newt Reflector  Mount: CG5 EQ with Magnificent Mini Autoguider  Camera: ZWO ASI120MC  Additional Equipment: Barlow 3x stacked with 2x Barlow  Red zone light pollution. 7 Bortle scale.  18 sequences of 500 frame videos at 5 minute intervals    Processing:    All videos were captured in SharpCap2, with 500 frames per video, videos spaced at 5 minute intervals, and all the same sharpcap settings for each video.  Stacked in Registax6 keeping the best 50% of the frames, then using the same wavelet values for each stacked image.  Stacked and waveleted images were imported into photoshop CS5 where I aligned them all and created a gif from the frames. Photoshop was mainly for putting together the gif, but I did do some minor color tweaks to bring out the detail a bit better.    Comments:    Quick note: This was actually taken on May 3rd, 2015, I only just got around to posting it though, lol  This is by far my most spectacular planetary image to date. I am super pleased with the amount of detail you can see in Jupiter, especially with only an 8"" telescope. Along with that, is the fact that the animation worked spectacularly well, being fairly smooth. The only thing that degraded the animation was the fact that for the last 30 minutes, clouds started rolling in, which affected the sharpness and color. Even still, I think it turned out wonderfully.  Another thing I think is really neat is the moons. You can even clearly see that Callisto is a resolved disc and not just a point of light. If you look very carefully, I think you can even see some areas of darker and lighter features on the surface, which is really cool to me. In addition, Callisto is grey, Io is yellowish green, and Europa is a bright blueish white, which is in fact each of their respective surface colors. So it's really exciting to me that I was able to effectively capture that.  Overall, this is one of the images I'm most proud of thus far!"

I have 2 barlows that are both 2x, can I stack them, and is that the equivalent of a 4x barlow? I have a Celestron 8 SCT with a 2000m focal length as my planetary scope. I took this the other night, but couldn't bring myself to post it here because I was so unhappy with how blurry it was. Should I stack the 2 2x barlows? Also, I captured this with a 60D, not a planetary camera, so I'm guessing that's part of the issue."
astrophotography,3dqahw,sixpointlow,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:30:19 2015 UTC,"Thank you!  You've got the right idea about how stacking them works, it seems! So, since I stacked a 2x and a 3x, it's effectively 6x. An important thing to remember is that it also takes down your focal ratio though, so my scope is natively an f/4.9, but with 6x barlow, it's effectively a ~f/30, meaning it collects a lot less light, which requires longer exposures, which means you need better seeing conditions. So really, I'd say it's all about experimentation and a little bit of luck to figure out what setup will work best for you."

astrophotography,3drmf7,Idontlikecock,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:05:36 2015 UTC,I think maybe the LP filter is what is giving it that orange/yellow hue and not the classic red. You could try playing with the curves in PI to bring out the red. Or maybe you played with the curves in PI and have it that color in the first place. Not really sure which though.

astrophotography,3drmf7,yawg6669,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:34:59 2015 UTC,"Something that tracks the movement of the stars, so you can take a long exposure without the stars moving on the camera sensor.  I've used an Astrotrac (portable tracking mount) and this image was taken with an NEQ6.  By tracking mount, we mean a motorised mount.  Other than that, a good bit of glass helps also (telescope with adaptor for DSLR or a low f# telephoto lens).    Never tried it, but you could take multiple untracked shots and stack them in Deep Sky Stacker for example.  If you use the rule of 600 to reduce movement, it could work well.  ""The rule of 600 states that to 'eliminate' star trails the exposure time in seconds should be 600 divided by the focal length of the taking lens. 20mm lens could go to 30 seconds, 300mm lens could go to 2 seconds."""

astrophotography,3dna84,Idontlikecock,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:00:11 2015 UTC,"I use a Canon 1000D. The only downside is that it's 12 bit. The 1100D and all newer Canons are 14 bit. I use 2, 1000D's - a modded one and a stock one. The stock one I keep stock for family photos and such. The wife and kids use that camera a lot so I can't really mod it and force them to use custom white balances all the time.  I shoot anything with a significant hydrogen cloud in it with the modded camera and anything that doesn't (star clusters, dark nebulae, reflection nebulae, etc) with the stock camera.  The modded camera picks up significantly more hydrogen then the stock one. I also don't have to push the reds in processing to sort of ""fake"" the hydrogen. It's captured well with the modded camera and processes smoothly with the other colors.  So, I'm liking it. A lot. I've had them both since 2010. I'm glad I had the mod done (Hap Griffin Imaging Infinity did mine). Replacing the stock filter with a hydrogen sensitive filter is well worth it. I can easily tell the difference between the stock and modded cameras in the hydrogen signal they pick up. I use the stock camera with sunlight white balance, and the modded one with custom white balance shot on a 18% digital grey card in full daylight to give me sunlight white balance. I'm saying this because the star color between the two cameras is the same, but the amount of hydrogen signal picked up is significantly greater in the modded cam and it makes it very useable for a narrowband hydrogen-alpha filter.  I hope that helps if you were considering modding your camera.  -Neil"

I know I definitely thought that those 2 objects would be the easiest to capture due to their size and brightness, but I've actually come to the conclusion that they're actually both more difficult than one would think. While it is easy to ""capture them"" it is more difficult to capture a lot of details without over exposing their cores. What most people with really great pictures of both seem to due is to take 2 different sets of pictures, one to capture small faint details, the other to capture the core and not have an over exposed one.  Hope this helps."

Your biggest error: Your stacking result is only 16-bit tif. 16 bit tif is fine for a a single exposure, but after stacking you need to save at least with 32 bit. Can you stack again and post your result with 32 bit tif please?  Also, this is only 15 minutes worth of data. Next time take either much longer exposures, or many more exposures. I don't have an equatorial mount, so I usually can't take exposures longer than 25 seconds. Getting decent results with such short exposures means taking several hundreds of them.

Any way, first I want to say I have no better result than you, and I don't know DSS or pixlnsight and I don't have a tracker. That said, I think you can darken the background by filtering low signal on the histogram. (I know you can do this on gimp, so it should be easy in photoshop ;) )  Other than that, I can only advise you to be careful with your tracker alignment. Reducing the exposure time would probably help sharpen the stars, but what would be the point of using a tracker then? (But as I mentioned, I don't have a tracker, so... I'm mainly guessing.)"

I'm going back in Oct. with my 70d and possibly my SBIG camera, but I'm not sure about that yet.  A couple of tips I've learned when shooting through the 60"" Use a remote release to trip the shutter. it will avoid shaking.  It sounds like you're not shooting afocally  (Holding the camera/lens up to the eyepiece) and are using a t-dadapter and 2"" camera adapter with no lens on the camera. This is the best way of doing it.    Use the lowest ISO possible.   Shoot in Manual mode.  Use Long exposures. This will be a bit of trial and error as well as experience in astroimaging to determine the correct exposure/ISO combination.  Focus using the magnified live view on the LCD screen. My 20d did not have live view, I'm glad my 70d does.  Take multiple shots  so you can stack them in SW later. Bracketing exposures is not necessary.  Take dark frames for image calibration. But take them after you're done looking at an object. They should be the same exposure time and ISO as the light frames. DON'T use Long exposure Noise reduction.  Download Ron Wodoski's CCD calc program. You can set up the scope and camera and it will show you the field of view.  Http://www.newastro.com/book_new/camera_app.html"

It is already there, but without the reducer you see only the middle part of the image, so it isn't noticable.  The reducer is pretty much needed if you want to do astophotos, it is good that you have it. With proper flat frames you get rid of the vignetting.  This is the first picture I ever took using the focal reducer, you can see the vignetting quite clearly.

I made this at 2AM and I forgot to account for the time it takes for light from Pluto to reach earth (I took the New Horizons countdown clock a little too literally).  I used my university's observatory with the following equipment:  Telescope: Meade LX-220-ACF 14""  Mount: Paramount ME   Camera: SBIG STF-8300M with SBIG FW8-8300 filter wheel  Software: TheSkyX (mount), CCDOps (camera)  I took a 30 second exposure through red, green and blue filters (the CCD was set at 5 C and I took a dark frame as well).  I did take more exposures to increase SNR, but the seeing got really bad after I took this first RGB exposure.  This photo was taken in Virginia under moderate light pollution (orange on this map).  I was kind of in a hurry, so the only processing I did was bump up the contrast and play with the levels to get the sky dark.  I'm 95% sure that I pointed out Pluto correctly in my photo, but there's a chance I'm wrong.  I used TheSkyX to determine Pluto's position in this photo, but it was difficult and I was not able to find detailed star charts with the current position of Pluto to back me up.  If I am indeed wrong, here's the photo without any text or the arrow.  Also, the RGB layers might not be 100% correctly lined up because I did the alignment manually with CCDOps (I haven’t gotten around to learning CCDsoft yet).  I’ve been an amateur astronomer for quite some time, but I only got into astrophotography in the past few months so don’t be fooled into thinking that I really know what I’m doing based on the equipment list.  My university has a nice observatory, but the professor running it retired and now I am the only person who knows how to use it (something I hope to change)."
astrophotography,3df3l4,A_FLYING_MOOSE,5,Wed Jul 15 19:48:21 2015 UTC,"Cool! I'll be doing the same thing hopefully in the next week only with the 16"" version of that scope.  If it's not too wet out I can pull out a big scope and maybe get 0.271 arcsec/pixel. Unfortunately the weather here is not great for photometry very often.  Hopefully going to catalog some TNO in the fall, my uni only has 2 astronomy projects next semester so I have the observatory almost to myself."
astrophotography,3df3l4,yawg6669,4,Wed Jul 15 23:55:28 2015 UTC,There's a 0% chance you'll actually get a 0.27arcsec/pixel image.  You'll be seeing limited long before that......unless your uni is on a chilean mountain top.
astrophotography,3df3l4,A_FLYING_MOOSE,3,Thu Jul 16 00:28:25 2015 UTC,"Its what my formulae for the telescope and camera say, I haven't done the photometry yet but I'll be trying with a 0.375 system first.  I have a 1 meter aperture telescope that's f/4.0 and the STI 8300M which gives me 0.27.  I've never done this before but I assume that over the 30 minute exposures I should be able to limit seeing error if I check my standard stars frequently and pay attention to my professor"
astrophotography,3df3l4,yawg6669,3,Thu Jul 16 01:34:50 2015 UTC,"I think you're confusing actual resolution with theoretical resolution.   Actual resolution is seeing limited when the system is more resolved than the optical train.  0.273 would require seeing around 0.1arcsec, essentially impossible.  Photometry and standard stars are irrelevant in this conversation."
astrophotography,3df3l4,A_FLYING_MOOSE,2,Thu Jul 16 01:39:31 2015 UTC,"No I understand it, I just haven't done the observation yet to see what the difference is yet.  It will depend on the sky of that night so I don't have anything to compare it with now"
astrophotography,3df3l4,yawg6669,7,Thu Jul 16 01:47:07 2015 UTC,"From wikipedia:   The best conditions give a seeing disk diameter of ~0.4 arcseconds and are found at high-altitude observatories on small islands such as Mauna Kea or La Palma.   In my experience, the best seeing you will encounter is about 1 arcsecond on an exceptional night.  On an average night, it's probably something like 5.  You could theoretically use lucky imaging, but that only works for really bright objects.  The only way you will ever get diffraction-limited images with a big scope is with adaptive optics and/or lucky imaging (or being in space, of course)."
astrophotography,3df3l4,chulengo,3,Thu Jul 16 03:16:29 2015 UTC,"Oh, well regardless of the measurement you're not going to get 0.1arcsec seeing, I'll bet cash on it.  Long exposures just make the resolution worse."

I imagine you'd have to combine a short exposure of the planet and then a relatively long exposure to get the background stars.  There are also other Kuiper Belt objects that seem like they could be within the range of amateurs.   At 18.7, Eris (although technically not in the Kuiper Belt) is pretty dim, but probably within the reach of a good CCD and telescope.  Makemake is even better at 16.7."

astrophotography,3dfzqi,Idontlikecock,2,Sat Jul 18 00:28:58 2015 UTC,"There are a few factors at play:   The signal is really good because the target is pretty bright, so I'm not stretching the noise trying to dig out faint details. It was it was shot from Bortle 2 sky so I didn't have to process out any light pollution or sky glow. This makes it so that I'm not separating nebulosity from light pollution which only accentuates noise. It was a very steady night and I didn't use my Peltier Cooling Chamber for the DSLR, but the dark frames were nearly perfect matches so dark calibration was excellent. The process for saturation I use in PixInsight eliminates chromatic noise as part of the step. See the video links below. Lastly, I used ATrousWaveletTransform in PixInsight for noise reduction. I don't recall the setting, but I think it was 5 layers at 1.75, 1.25, 0.75, 0.

astrophotography,3ddjh4,Idontlikecock,5,Wed Jul 15 12:51:19 2015 UTC,"I would suggest a lower ISO next time, the nebulae seem to have gotten a little washed out."
astrophotography,3ddjh4,Idontlikecock,2,Wed Jul 15 15:38:16 2015 UTC,"Cool, I'll see what I can do.  I'm fairly under mounted, so anything beyond 30 seconds tends to have movement in it, but an upgraded mount is on the menu!  Does lower ISO allow more saturation?  I'm still learning the whole post processing thing too, so I may have butchered this at numerous stages, lol:)  Assuming the mount were no issue, what's the ideal ISO and exposure for dso imaging?  I've been exposing till the curve peaks are about half way across.  If it were possible with my mount, would ISO 100 be the most ideal ISO?"
astrophotography,3ddjh4,rnclark,5,Wed Jul 15 18:09:45 2015 UTC,"Well ISO is just your cameras sensitivity to light, shooting at 100 is very impractical because you want to have much more sensitivity than that. The problem with higher ISO is you amplify the light signal too much and get too much noise, and in your case, also over exposed the nebulae. If I were you, I'd shoot for around 800-1600 is the general setting. Some bright objects require you to lower it, some faint objects will require you to raise it."
astrophotography,3ddjh4,Idontlikecock,4,Wed Jul 15 19:36:58 2015 UTC,"ISO is not sensitivity.  Changing ISO does not change how much light the sensor records.  It only changes how much the signal from the sensor is amplified.  What ISO works best for astro depends on the camera's downstream electronics and the contribution of noise from the downstream electronics.  For very good downstream electronics, a lower ISO can be used, giving more dynamic range.  Nikon and Sonys have very good sensors and downstream electronics (except for Sony's lossy compression the the raw files)."
astrophotography,3ddjh4,rnclark,6,Wed Jul 15 19:46:40 2015 UTC,"""The problem with higher ISO is you amplify the light signal too much."" I know you aren't ""actually"" making your cameras physical sensor more sensitive to light, you're just amplifying the signal. I understand this, but I was trying to word it simply to help him understand why the higher ISO washed out his picture.  When you say high ISO doesn't cause noise, it does. You make the argument it comes from the downstream electronics, but saying that is like saying Hurricane Katrina didn't flood New Orleans, the city did by letting the levees fail. Yeah, it did flood from the levees failing, but the reason they failed was because of the hurricane. Yes the downstream electronics cause the noise, but the reason they are causing the noise is from the cranking of the ISO."
astrophotography,3ddjh4,Idontlikecock,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:57:11 2015 UTC,"This idea that iso causes noise probably stems from daytime photography.  Raise the iso, and the camera shortens the exposure time or closes the aperture.  The shorter exposure time and/or smaller aperture diameter reduces the light.  It is the lower light level causing increased apparent noise, not the ISO.  Try this: expose a scene at ISO 3200 (or 6400), then with the camera in manual, make another exposure at ISO 1600 then raise the exposure in the raw converter to compensate.  See any difference in the noise levels?  You shouldn't unless the camera has really bad downstream electronics.  See Figure 3 here for these very example (ISO 6400 versus ISO 1600 pushed 2 stops in the raw converter).  ISO does not cause noise.  Edit: the main noise we see in digital camera images is from photon noise.  Only the very lowest signals in an image are affected much by downstream electronics.  So the noise we see from photon noise is the square root of the total number of photons collected.  That is why signal-to-noise ratio does not change with iso, because iso does not change the amount of light collected, only total exposure time and aperture do that."
astrophotography,3ddjh4,rnclark,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:06:24 2015 UTC,"See, you SHOULDN'T raise the exposure to make them equal. If you took a LONGER exposure at 800 ISO until it is equivalent to the shorter 3200 ISO, you would find that the 800 ISO would have lower noise. Once you begin raising the exposure to compensate, of course you'll get more noise, but that's not what you should when lowering the ISO. When you lower the ISO, you leave the shutter open for longer, not just up the exposure in software."
astrophotography,3ddjh4,Idontlikecock,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:28:01 2015 UTC,"WHAT???   Look at the signal-to-noise ratio.  It will be unchanged by changeing the exposure slider in the raw converter as it is amplifying sigal and noise equally.  It is the signal-to-noise ratio that we perceive as noise in images.  That is given by how much light we collect, not ISO."

astrophotography,3dbsmx,cookie_partie,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:43:25 2015 UTC,"True color of the Sun to human eyes is actually white. This is because we evolved under Sun's light and our eyes perceive Sun's light to be white. Take a blank sheet of white paper, it will reflect all wavelengths equally. Under sunlight (when it's highest in the sky) it appears to be white, as it should be. With a neutral density (meaning it does not modify color balance) solar filter shows the Sun as it would appear to us were it not too bright.   The reason why we think the Sun is yellow is because we can only look at it (and not get blinded, that is) while it's nearly set or has just risen, i.e. when it is close to the horizon. The Sun then appears yellow-red because its light has to pass through very thick layer of atmosphere which scatters away the more energetic blue (and to some degree green) light of the spectra, making the Sun appear yellow-orange. The atmosphere does the same with the Moon, too. Notice that when the Moon is close to the horizon it also appears to be yellow-orange, but once it climbs higher it becomes the usual white-gray color.  Red appearance is caused by the wavelength used by specialized solar telescopes, the Hydrogen-alpha wavelength of 656.28, which is deep red. It is the wavelength emitted by ionized Hydrogen atoms, and there's plenty of hydrogen in the Sun.

astrophotography,3da3p2,82364,11,Tue Jul 14 18:18:10 2015 UTC,No it would not appear nearly as large as that in the night sky. Here is a picture of how large Saturn would really look compared to the Moon when observed form Earth.

astrophotography,3da3p2,galloots,2,Wed Jul 15 02:19:28 2015 UTC,"What you are talking about is called angular size.  The angular size of Jupiter at opposition is 45-50 arc seconds, Saturn (with rings) is approximately 40 arc seconds wide.

astrophotography,3d8y5p,JohnnyDDrake,3,Tue Jul 14 23:15:36 2015 UTC,"The bigger the scope the finer the details it can resolve. So you may not be able to resolve the same fine details as a larger scope could.  However, in a lot of cases you will be more limited by seeing, and by the performance of your camera anyway, so given good enough conditions you might be able to get something better.   Here is an example I found comparing images between 4 in and 8 in scopes to give you an idea."
astrophotography,3d8y5p,blewyourfaceup,2,Tue Jul 14 23:42:26 2015 UTC,"Excellent image.  I'm still learning and images like this are a great inspiration.  One question -- how did you arrive at this image scale?  You don't mention that you used a barlow or extender, and yet you ended up with a very large image.  By comparison, I use a telescope with a much longer focal length, and end up with much smaller images (https://www.reddit.com/r/astrophotography/comments/3d1qwg/saturn_from_friday_night/).  Did you scale the image during processing (e.g. drizzling)?  Edit: doh! I see you used a 2.5x powermate.  I suppose my original question still stands, though -- when processing, do you utilize drizzling?"
astrophotography,3d8y5p,JohnnyDDrake,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:03:42 2015 UTC,"For this I used 2x drizzling in Registax to achieve that scale.  Generally I find drizzling to be hit or miss, but I thought this one ended up OK.  I usually try both ways and see which turns out better.  Edit: It also depends a lot in your camera sensor size and resolution. I'm not too familiar with the camera you listed in your link, but I assume our pixel densities are different."

astrophotography,3d8y5p,scibuff,4,Tue Jul 14 15:39:54 2015 UTC,"I am really enjoying it, I've had it for about a year or so now.  Performs well on planetary and some DSOs, galaxies and smaller nebulae are good targets.  There are other scopes you can find that can do specific things better, but this is pretty good all-rounder.  And visually it's fantastic, if that interests you.  I do have the 0.7x focal reducer, and it's a mixed bag.  I'm using a Canon 6D (full frame, had it prior for terrestrial stuff), and I have pretty severe vignetting with it that I usually have to crop down pretty aggressively.  If you're using a smaller sensor (APS-C or CCD) then you should be ok.     Here are a few DSOs I did last year using the FR.  Don't mind my questionable processing skills.  There are a few guys on CloudyNights that do some pretty amazing things with this scope.  M42  Horsehead"

astrophotography,3dbit8,yawg6669,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:31:57 2015 UTC,Used LR to change from Raw to Tiff. Processed the darks (10 frames) the same way. Loaded into DSS with a sigma clipping. Saved to 16 Bit. Opened in PS. Stretched mildly to bring out fainter stars. Masked the shit out of them to keep the core from flowing out. Removed the gradient toward the end using the subtraction method used by Misti. Boosted the saturation slightly. Smoothed out the final with some noise ninja. And boom. M22 is staring at me as you see it. I'm sure I could improve this methodology but that would require patience.   Anywhere I can improve?  Many thanks.

The one thing I'm a bit bummed about is not being able to bring out really any of the Hydrogen emission nebulae in the region, but I guess that's to be expected with an unmodded dSLR"
astrophotography,3dacj0,rnclark,2,Tue Jul 14 21:33:27 2015 UTC,"Not really.  Much if the problem of not bringing out the H-alpha stems from processing methodology.  Specifically, the dominant colors in this region are reddish-brown Milky Way and many red and orange stars.  If the processing steps include any sort of histogram equalization in a dominantly red scene, the reds are suppressed.  Try your same methodology on a really red sunset and what the reds come out bland.  See this thread on processing challange for the same region  Your image is 66.3 minutes with a 13.4 mm diameter lens, dark skies.  The image in the challenge thread is 9 minutes with a 50 mm diameter lens, light polluted (green zone) skies.   ( 50 / 13.4 )2 = 13.9, or the 9 minutes equivalent to your setup with 9*13.9 = 125 minutes of exposure, so double yours , but worse conditions.  See what I and others were able to do (many also did histogram equalization).  Edit: fix spelling"
astrophotography,3dacj0,CNVsCauseASD,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:05:25 2015 UTC,"Thanks a lot for the information. I'm pretty new to this, so I'm still learning a lot with each go.   My workflow in Pixinsight was:  Crop  Canon Banding Reduction  Dynamic Background Extraction  Background Neutralization  Color Calibration  Histogram Stretch  HDR Multiscale Transform  Saturation Adjustment  Local Histogram Equalization to increase contrast.  How should I go about the Color Calibration/Background Neutralization differently? Or even skip them altogether?"
astrophotography,3dacj0,tashabasha,2,Wed Jul 15 03:13:00 2015 UTC,"Looking over your list some more, some comments.  First note that there are natural color gradients in this scene.  Dynamic Background Extraction + Background Neutralization: the background is not neutral, even if there were no light pollution and no airglow.  The deep sky becomes redder the closer to the Milky Way (of course with some local variations).  Histogram Stretch: this is reducing the dominant color in the scene, which is reddish.  Local Histogram Equalization to increase contrast: probably also is reducing the dominant color in the local area."
astrophotography,3dacj0,rnclark,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:16:08 2015 UTC,"The thing that I'm seeing consistently in your and other processed images here is when I make a histograms of all or parts the the image, the three channels in the histogram line up.  This makes an overall neutral white balance, but because this area is dominated by reds and oranges, the red are suppressed (thus also including the H-alpha) and blue is enhanced.  I suggest reprocessing and anywhere there is anything like a histogram equalization step to eliminate it.  Perhaps substitute  it with some curves work or other contrast stretch.  If you have a a choice on white balance during raw conversion, choose daylight.  That will make solar type stars come out yellow-white, hotter stars bluish and cooler stars yellower to red just like we perceive them (e.g. in binoculars and telescopes)."

astrophotography,3d71q5,yawg6669,4,Tue Jul 14 00:52:51 2015 UTC,"These data were captured over 5 nights starting back in May with my TPO8RC+moonlite riding on an Orion Atlas mount. Separate stacks of Ha, LRGB were captured with my QSI660wsg8, OAG with a LodestarX2.  Darks and bias applied, flats not applied because my red flats didn't save and I have since cleaned the mirrors and recollimated.  Ha total time: 5hrs.  Lum total time: 5.1hrs.  RGB 1.5 hrs each, all binned 1x1 from my home in a red zone (SQM 18.5 measured).  I don't bother to record seeing, but if I was imaging it was at least average (2arcsec), but likely better occasionally.  Processing consisted of RGB combine followed by ACDNR, Ha addition using NBRGB script, deconvolution of luminance and addition to HaRGB.  I also applied a secret trick that I don't want to disclose since 1) I'd like to perfect it, and 2) I'd like to see if anyone can tell what I did by looking at the image.  Of course, eventually I'll put it into some sort of advanced tutorial, but first I need to learn more about pixelmath.  The usual background neutralization, color calibration, color saturation, and curves transformations after that.  I could probably do better with these data, but I'm sick of having such a large queue of unprocessed data, so now I'm on to the fireworks galaxy, for which data have already been collected.  Comments and criticism welcome.  Can you see an oddity in the image?  Can you deduce my “secret trick”?"
astrophotography,3d71q5,Idontlikecock,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:52:55 2015 UTC,"I can see the oddity, but that's only because you mentioned it on someone else's image ;) good job, glad you were able to cloud around the ring, but I feel like it made the ring look over exposed. I think you should try a composite with the ring from a lower exposure but add the cloud in from this. Similar to how people add Saturn and Jupiter's moons. Great work though, especially from a red zone."

Most LRGB subs were 2,4, or 5 minutes, the outer rings comes from Ha, and those were 30 min subs.  I may be able to help that vignetting with processing, but the right way to do it is with flats, of which I don't have a reliable way to do them yet (considering a flat panel or similar).  Right now, I do them at twilight, but it's not always the case that I can be set up and ready to go by then, so I need a new method.  I can upload the masters if you want."

astrophotography,3d6eck,recoveringdropout,2,Mon Jul 13 22:20:26 2015 UTC,"No problem dude. That is because they're over exposed. In LRGB the L stands for a ""luminance frame"" which is a long exposure with no filter.  This is to get a lot of light in the relatively dark nebula but leads to stars being way too bright. The liberated electrons in that cell of the  semiconductor flood into neighboring ones which causes the bleeding effect."

astrophotography,3d4gva,mycatkilledabird,4,Mon Jul 13 13:19:01 2015 UTC,"I didn't really expect to pick up faint emission nebulae with a camera that still has its IR-filter but a fast lens can really work miracles!  *Camera: Pentax K-50 (unmodded!) *Lens: Pentax-F SMC 50mm F/1.7 *No mount, just a cheap tripod.  *40 lights (6s, ISO 6400, F/2.2) *no darks, no bias, no flats  Before going into DSS I loaded the raw files into ACR and did some work there. At F/2.2 my lens really does shine but there's still a bit of chromatic abberation and vignetting left so that was the first to go. Next of I carefully lowered the background noise without harming the details and went into the RGB-curves to subtract the light pollution. Even though I was on a field out of town there was still a noticable orange in the pictures. Finally I played with the sliders a bit. Lowering the exposure, lowering the highlights and raising the blacks-slider to stop the stars from being giant white blobs later on. After raising the saturation a tad I synchronised the settings and saved them as tiff-files. Off to DSS!  In DSS i did the usual. Stacking via Median Kappa-Sigma Clipping, aligning the RGB-spikes and stretching them out a bit, then using the curves. The end result looked like something already! Not much else here. Saving as a 16-bit tiff and back to Photoshop.  The first step was going into ACR again and using the graduated filter tool to graduate that nasty gradient away. Following this came a series of curve-adjustments to increase contrast, increase the reds, keep the stars at bay and increase the contrast again... Then I got creative. What if I got all the brighter stars selected and used them as a mask for the next few adjustments? Select>Colour Range>Select the stars I want to stay unaffected and hit okay. Expanding the selection by 1 pixel and feathering it by that amount aswell made sure that I wouldn't end up with rings instead of stars. This selection was the mask for -yet again- another curves adjustment. Now the nebulae are really starting to show! At F/2.2 my lens is really darn good but there is still a bit of distortion at the edges to to lower that I copied everything into a new layer, took ACR and de-clarified it a bit. Giving it a mask I used the radial gradient to leave the middle unaffected. Now came the last step: Again, making everything into a new layer I opened that in Camera Raw and raised the slightly grayish stars back to white and used the HSL-sliders to raise the saturation and luminance of the red and magenta channels since that's where the nebulae are.   And that's basically it. Having a tracking mount and maybe a UHC-filter so the stars don't jump out as much in the first place would definitely help with an image like this but still... I think this is pretty darn nice for my equipment!"

astrophotography,3d1qwg,derbeazle,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:14:38 2015 UTC,"You might want to get the camera checked out, it's really weak in the blue channel. Have you captured other images without the yellow cast? If you've been unable to get anything closer to neutral, you should look into a warranty return.  I assume the Skyris has some sort of white balance adjustment or calibration. You may want to look at that."
astrophotography,3d1qwg,Bersonic,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:32:24 2015 UTC,"It does have a white balance adjustment.  In fact, you can tweak each channel individually during the capture, as well as white balance, hue, and saturation.  I think the camera captures blue just fine, but the auto white balance just doesn't seem to work well.  Now that I know I need to ""boost"" the blue channel to get a more natural color, I'll try that next time.  FWIW, I can make the image completely blue by just bumping up the blue channel during capture by 5 or 10 ""ticks"", and that channel does behave just like the red and green channel.  So my gut says the blue channel is fine, I just had the capture settings off.  What I suspect happened was while I was tweaking the camera for capture, I probably noticed a blue fringe around Saturn due to chromatic aberration, and tried to minimize it by cutting the blue channel a bit.  That's likely what made the yellowish tint, but I never realized that's what it was because I was compulsively trying to minimize the effects of CA.  Next time I'll ignore the the CA effects and remove them during post, so I (hopefully) end up with a more natural color balance during capture."

I decided to revisit this target once more to try and bring out the faint galaxy. The galaxy is about a quarter of a billion light years away.  Getting both IC1296 and M57 to show without over saturating M57 was a processing challenge. I spent a good amount of time playing with levels, masks, and the ""lighten"" layer property. Initial color correction was done in Lightroom and levels + unsharpen mask in photoshop. Image scaled down to 70% of original.

astrophotography,3czizu,Idontlikecock,1 point,Sun Jul 12 05:06:49 2015 UTC,Surprised you were able to get IC 1296 from a white zone. Keep up those long exposures :)
astrophotography,3czizu,yawg6669,1 point,Sun Jul 12 05:22:07 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind that this was done at f10 which helps reduce the red/brown glow a little. I do have access to a field flattener/reducer, and I find doing deep sky imaging with it from the back yard becomes a lot more challenging at f6.3. I am able to get much longer exposures without it, reducing the noise component. Take a look at this video for more on how to improve your signal to noise: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO4QFb3ydNM.  Also, I only did 2 hours of exposures when Vega was right over head. My subs stopped being useful once M57 was slightly lower in the horizon where they had been dominated by light pollution."
astrophotography,3czizu,yawg6669,1 point,Sun Jul 12 14:31:54 2015 UTC,"That's what I'm imaging RIGHT NOW!   Great color OP, but you need flats! :)"
astrophotography,3czizu,yawg6669,2,Sun Jul 12 05:44:43 2015 UTC,"I have not used flats as I have not had much success with them yet. They seem to make things worse. In theory, I agree that they would help quite a bit. Manually removing vignetting and dust spots is no easy task. As you can probably tell, I have a bit of it left in the background of the image.  I'm still learning the equipment and one issue that I can't figure out yet is that field of view of the guide camera does not change but there is a bit of drift in the SCT field of view. I have read that this may be either flexure or mirror flop. I'd like to take the exposures up to 15 minutes some day."
astrophotography,3czizu,yawg6669,1 point,Sun Jul 12 14:21:07 2015 UTC,"Ah yea, at f10, it's mirror flop, most SCTs have that unless you have good mirror locks.   Sorry to be the bearer of bad news, but 15min exposures are off the table for you.  10 if you're lucky.  My upper limit was 8, especially at F10.  On the plus side, flats aren't too hard.  How are you doing them?  Sky flats with t shirt (under armor) worked great for me, in fact, still does."
astrophotography,3czizu,yawg6669,1 point,Sun Jul 12 18:06:19 2015 UTC,The entire reason I'd like to get to +15min is so I can dip my toes into narrowband. This will allow me to get around the light pollution issue. I will likely switch the SCT out for a refractor some day.

Background Neutralization using a small square in the upper right corner, then Color Calibration using the same square and the whole image as a white reference.  A few Histogram Transformations, then ACDNR for noise reduction.  Used the Ha as a Lum image, stretched the Ha, applied ACDNR to the Ha, and then used LRGB on the RGB image, boosted saturation to .4 and applied chromatic noise reduction.  Made a copy of the image, removed layers 4 and 5 using Atrous Wavelets, then made a star mask of that image (nosie at .60, contours checked, and applied to the original exposing only the stars.  Applied Morphological Transformation to reduce the stars at 50%.  Used the same star mask and applied HDR Transform twice.

astrophotography,3ctaz9,RFtinkerer,2,Fri Jul 10 16:33:07 2015 UTC,"I think this is as good as I can get from the data I have.  Canon 70D 70-200 f4L + 1.4x, 280 mm, f5.6 Celestron CG-5 mount Yellow zone Stack 1: 16x 60s, ISO 200 Stack 2: 154x 60s, ISO 1600 20 darks 20 bias 18 flats Astronmik CLS filter  I've been struggling with it on and off for a few months.  First of all, 280 mm is not close enough so I have to crop.  This exacerbates the fact that I didn't have an autoguider and the lens+1.4x gets too soft wide open.  But I think I did pretty much what I can processing it and will improve the data next year.  I updated to Startools 1.4.302 alpha and there are some improvements over when I did it last time; better denoising and reveal algorithm.  It helped greatly with bringing out the details in the nebula.  I did a 2 stage noise removal as well--light on the brighter nebula and details, then masked around it and feathered that around the dimmer clouds; made a much more aggressive go there.  I was actually able to pull up more of the surrounding dust but decided I liked the contrast from the nebula better than bringing up all the gray-colored dust.  The dust of course is more yellowish but the LP filter cut that and all color was basically lost in the noise.  I don't know whether it's better to keep the filter in and lose the dust details, or take it out and deal with the worse noise pollution, possibly losing the hydrogen and oxygen emission details?  I don't know.  Hopefully I can do both next year and try it out!  I went pretty hard on sharpening the details as much as possible, but held off on the life module and any of Noel Carboni's actions I tried before.  In PS I layered the stacks to get greater dynamic range and stretched the contrast, saturation until I was as happy with it as I could get."
astrophotography,3ctaz9,yawg6669,3,Fri Jul 10 16:45:09 2015 UTC,"Looks great RF.  I'm curious, can you post one of those dusty gray ones for comparison?  Your blacks looked a little clipped, and I wonder if a slight gray dust with a bit of noise would help at all.  Also, what about using a filter for one part, no filter for the faint dust, then combining those?"
astrophotography,3ctaz9,yawg6669,2,Fri Jul 10 16:49:56 2015 UTC,"Thanks!  All right, here's one with the dust brought up some.  Dust increased  I also included a wider area since it shows up more outside the main area.    I think you have a good idea about the imaging for next year.  Worth a try at least.  Hopefully the weather cooperates; it's been cloudy for the past few months when the moon is set."

astrophotography,3culci,Idontlikecock,3,Sat Jul 11 00:55:16 2015 UTC,"The 10"" Dob would do fine for planetary, you may want to use only it for that.   As for what else you should get though, I'd look for a nice used Orion Sirius mount, HEQ5, or AVX in your budget. As for the scope, a standard 80mm ED is never a bad choice. If you wanted to work work with a shorter focal length, an AT65EDQ is a good choice or the William Optics 71mm Zennithstar. The sidebar suggests three AT6IN reflector which is great, just know that reflectors are harder to use in general than refractors for Astrophotography. Don't forget though, you'll also need a guide camera and scope as well as the accompanying hardware to put it all together (rings, plates, etc.)  Hope this is a good write up, good luck :)"

Anyways the setup I was looking for was exactly what you had seemed to point out. Sirius mount and 80mm ED. This is where I found the combo.  I have been using my dob for planetary and lunar imaging and also viewing, and this setup would be mainly for DSO imaging. My limit is $2,000 Canadian, maybe stretch it to $2,500 depending on what else I need for the setup.  Any thoughts on this?   Thanks! :)"

astrophotography,3culci,Idontlikecock,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:31:37 2015 UTC,"The ZWO ASI120 is a great planetary camera, not so amazing guide camera. The QHY5L-II I think it is called (weird name, but you should be able to find it)  is great at both planetary and guiding. The Orion SSAG is a great guide camera as well (the QHY5 has higher sensitivity though and would make a better guide camera, the Orion equivalent of the QHY5 is their Starshoot auto guider pro, they're basically the exact same camera). So the QHY5 is one of the best guiders in it's price range, with the ability to image planets almost as well as the ZWO. But what are its cons? Software. Apparently it's weird with drivers and can freeze PHD. Others say it works fine though, just do some reading before deciding for it or against it."

When I try to take a picture or a video Saturn its so small that my camera only captures a few pixels of it. It's so much more blurry in camera than when I look through the eyepiece.   Is there a way to take better pictures with my telescope? I have a nikon D800 camera a T adapter, a Samsung Galaxy S6 and a home made mount. I've just been either putting the D800 in with the adapter or using my home made mount to hold my cellphone up to the eyepiece. Is there something more I could be doing to get a clearer or larger shot? Should I try a webcam?"
astrophotography,3culci,Idontlikecock,2,Sat Jul 11 02:53:49 2015 UTC,"A barlow would help the most, if you would like better still, a better camera would be the next step or more powerful telescope."

astrophotography,3culci,Idontlikecock,2,Sat Jul 11 23:12:40 2015 UTC,"Fairly important. Depending on how nice your mount is, and how well you polar aligned it, you can take shorter shots and be fine, but to take long shots, you'd need a tracking scope and guide camera."

astrophotography,3culci,mrstaypuft,2,Sat Jul 11 23:51:47 2015 UTC,"The nomenclature APers usually use for the ""tracking scope"" is a ""guide scope"" (whereas the equatorial mount ""tracks"").  Does a poor PA go away with a guide scope?  Maybe... Depending on several factors (the focal length of your guide scope vs. the focal length of your OTA, the pixel size and sensor size of your guide camera, atmospheric seeing, etc), the guider can do a poor or awesome job of making up for a variety of tracking errors, including polar misalignment.  A guider reactively (i.e. after the error happens) corrects your mount.  Your guidecam usually will be configured at minimum to take exposures every 1s or so.  If your PA is terrible, that terribleness will become quite evident in those 1s periods, and so much so that your images will suffer since the guider can't correct well enough... so, your best bet is to do as well as you can with your PA so that your guider works ""less"" on alignment errors, and more on the errors it must react to (like worm gear inconsistencies, wind, etc).  Hope that helps!"

That's like saying you want to drive to work, only to find out you need to ""accessorize"" your commute with an automobile.

astrophotography,3culci,mwhaskin,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:54:48 2015 UTC,Wanted to start a new thread but I will ask here first. I have a new 8in dob on the way and am looking forward to knocking my socks off with some lunar photos. My 1200mm FL refractor (80mm) frames it perfectly with my canon t2i BUT with the dob I will most definitely need a barlow which will push me too close to the moon for the full disk.   My question is this: are there any tutorials for stitching the moon back together? I would hate to have to give up the full disk because of a silly little barlow.
astrophotography,3culci,Idontlikecock,2,Sat Jul 11 03:45:02 2015 UTC,Photoshop and Lightroom will stitch them together automatically as long as they overlap by 40% or something like that
astrophotography,3culci,mwhaskin,1 point,Sat Jul 11 04:00:53 2015 UTC,I'll definitely have to look into that. Thanks!

astrophotography,3culci,bonzothebeast,2,Sat Jul 11 05:46:01 2015 UTC,Google: autostitch. Or some thing like that. I'm on my phone and I'm too lazy to search. Or you can go through my post history and find the latest lunar mosaic I posted. My comment should have the information.
astrophotography,3culci,mwhaskin,1 point,Sat Jul 11 23:27:36 2015 UTC,Thanks! Only probably I might face is the lack of tracking.

astrophotography,3culci,bonzothebeast,2,Sat Jul 11 23:41:13 2015 UTC,AutoStitch doesn't work with videos. It works with images. You just give it a bunch of images and it stitches them together to create a mosaic.

astrophotography,3culci,IKLYSP,2,Sat Jul 11 18:49:15 2015 UTC,It's best to lower the ISO and experiment until you get the best tradeoff between noise and detail. I usually shoot at ISO800 with my Canons but the ideal ISO does vary between cameras due to the different amounts of noise they produce.
astrophotography,3culci,Zeisa,2,Sat Jul 11 19:38:18 2015 UTC,"Thanks for reply! As I have discovered best ISO performance is  by multiplying 160 (160, 320 etc), so closest would be 640. But thats is too low, to capture enough stars. Would it be dumb, to capture at max ISO, and make picture black and white, so that noise wouldn't be so noticeable?"
astrophotography,3culci,IKLYSP,1 point,Sat Jul 11 20:08:03 2015 UTC,I don't think that would help. What kind of lenses and exposure times are you using?
astrophotography,3culci,Zeisa,2,Sat Jul 11 20:35:56 2015 UTC,"I as don't have telescope or anything like that to get detailed look at skies, I use kit lens at widest (18mm) to get some nice and interesting pictures. Exposure time usually is 30s, and as I don't have any fancy star tracking tripod, that's usually is longest possible time... Biggest problem is that usually cloudy and stars are just not visible, but that's why I now want to prepare for that rare clear sky night..."
astrophotography,3culci,IKLYSP,2,Sat Jul 11 21:00:25 2015 UTC,"Yeah it should possible to take some OK widefield shots with the kit lens. I was testing out my 14mm F/2.8 lens and was able to see the milky way with 15 seconds of exposure, albeit that was in the countryside with no light pollution.  I think the most beneficial thing to do is to keep practicing and experimenting to see what works for your specific camera. Everyone's equipment and location are different so what works for someone might not work for someone else."
astrophotography,3culci,Idontlikecock,2,Sat Jul 11 21:33:33 2015 UTC,"My suggestion is to shoot at around 800-1600, but take a lot of pictures. Stack them, then denoise them. You may have a little left, but no where near as much as you started with."
astrophotography,3culci,Zeisa,1 point,Sat Jul 11 20:10:21 2015 UTC,"Thanks, like this suggestion a lot. One more quick question -  with my experience with Lightroom it's difficult to reduce noise without loosing some stars, as they are very noise-like. Is there any special program for star photo noise reduction?"
astrophotography,3culci,Idontlikecock,1 point,Sat Jul 11 20:35:45 2015 UTC,Definitely try PixInsight and follow the guide in the wiki on how to edit DSLR pictures by yawg. He uses PI and goes over tons of steps to make your pictures really great.

astrophotography,3culci,mrstaypuft,2,Sat Jul 11 22:39:08 2015 UTC,"Absolutely -- I think what you're looking for is ""quick align,"" and should be in the align menu.  This is an ""instant align"" option and doesn't require any alignment stars or cal stars.  It maps the mount's goto function assuming (a) you entered the correct location (lat/long), date, and time information, and (b) your mount is properly aligned.  So, make sure this info is correct (and polar alignment is roughly close), and you should be good to go.  I have the Nexstar controller on my CGEM and I use this to skip alignment when using plate solving with Sequence Generator Pro.  Should work the same for setting up widefield shots.  Good luck!"

Do you plan on using the camera outside of Astrophotography? If not, I would check out Astromart or cloudynights and try to find a nice narrowband camera. It would allow you to image even with a full moon out in the middle of New York. It would be a little more than the one you liked, but it would be worth it in my opinion if this is something you'd stick with and don't need a camera outside of AP.   If you however do want a camera outside of AP, I'd check out your local Craigslist. I saw a 6D on mine the other day for like $800.

I started to get into astronomy about a year ago. I am a high school student, so I am limited on funds. I started saving up for a Zhumell Z8 but quickly realized that by going with that scope I'd out grow it and quickly look into a more satisfying hobby: astrophotography. I have a DSLR (Canon 30D) and I know a lot about photography (I come from a family of photographers).  I planned on buying the Celestron Omni 150 XLT scope, figuring that I would be able to acquire the tools to begin astrophotography with it. But, I am visiting Hawaii soon, so against most reviews, I ordered the Celestron Travel Scope 70mm. I have been using it for a few weeks now, and love it. But now I have the itch. I read online that I can effectively hook it up to my DSLR and it would act as a great widefield telephoto lens. In order to make this happen, I need a mount.  I know r/astrophotography doesn't skimp on price, but I need a cheap option. $300 max. I am a proficient DIY-er, if that adds any value to the conversation. I am currently looking at Orion's Adventures in Astrophotography bundle. I saw a post here by /u/wattevah adding a neat autoguiding feature.  Is this my next move? Thank you for any advice!"
astrophotography,3culci,Idontlikecock,2,Sun Jul 12 03:25:44 2015 UTC,"I would stay farrr away from that. Seems incredibly over priced and would definitely not leave you with the results you want. Your best option for right now is to literally just go out with a tripod and your camera and try to shoot the Milky Way, or spend like $20 and build a manual barndoor tracker and go for some wide field Milky Way shots. You won't get a proficient mount for $300 and you'll just end up disappointed. Save your money for a better mount."
astrophotography,3culci,MGJon,2,Sun Jul 12 04:39:52 2015 UTC,One word: Craigslist.  A while ago there was a guy here in Oregon selling off a bunch of astronomy stuff.  He had a nice Vixen Polaris EQ mount and tripod that he was willing to take $150 for.    I should have jumped at it.

I want to get into deep space astrophotography and my knowledge in photography in general is minimal. I read the wiki and ""what telescope?"" pages and they were very useful. However, given where I live things will be expensive to buy and difficult to access. On top of that, I live in a white zone and the nearest dark sky is almost 2.5 hours drive as per this map. Reaching a true dark sky is another 1.5 hours.  I have a budget of around $1000 and I could push an extra $150 if the quality will be significantly improved. I have no interest in regular photography so a specialized kit in astrophotography is also an option.  I live in Saudi Arabia on the west coast. Does this have any bearing on how difficult it is to capture deep space objects (e.g. polar alignment, sky direction or what not)? I really don't want to invest only to find that my location doesn't allow me to photograph most visible objects.  Also what are some of the good reading materials on astrophotography? Amazon have very favorable reviews for ""NightWatch: A Practical Guide to Viewing the Universe"". Should I get this book? Or online resources are enough?"
astrophotography,3culci,IKLYSP,2,Sun Jul 12 11:00:52 2015 UTC,"Saudi Arabia sounds like a good location, the worst ones are at very high or very low latitudes where the sun doesn't fully set in summer and the horizon blocks off a lot of interesting targets.  Imaging is certainly possible from a white zone, though not as good as a dark site, you may want to get a light pollution filter later on to block some of it out. I do OK from a red zone.  I don't read astronomy related books, I find online has been more useful. I started off coming from visual observing so it helped me to read on Reddit about what kinds of telescopes and cameras other people were using to take pictures."
astrophotography,3culci,pheroh,2,Sun Jul 12 15:48:31 2015 UTC,"Thanks. That is promising.  I suppose my next question would be ""What telescope?"" given that the pieces are new for around $1200. Buying used items isn't usually possible given my location and even if I did buy used from the US or elsewhere the packaging would pose a challenge as I don't want to get broken items."
astrophotography,3culci,Idontlikecock,1 point,Sun Jul 12 17:06:03 2015 UTC,"There are no sort of websites where people buy and sell used things like Craigslist in Saudi? The only complication I can think of would be heat, but I have no idea how cold it gets at night there.  Also I know you said your price range, but imaging is quite tough in a white zone. Planets and lunar would be fine, but any sort of DSO would be a lot eaiser to take from a dark sky zone. If you don't want to make the drive, look into narrowband imaging, it could be done from your backyard with no problem since it uses wavelengths that aren't light and would still look great. The only problem is, is that they're expensive cameras. However, you may think it to be worth to save up for one if you wouldn't want to drive anywhere and just image from your house."
astrophotography,3culci,pheroh,1 point,Sun Jul 12 18:39:56 2015 UTC,"No, there aren't many and they are mainly for mainstream items (cell phones, tvs, etc.).   I wouldn't mind driving every now and then. Ultimately, it's a hobby (hopefully!). I suppose I could start at planetary imaging and then move to DSO. I am torn on mounts as it seems to be very critical for DSO. The Celestron CG5 is difficult to find since it's discontinued and the Orion Sirius will take my whole budget and then more! Are there any decent mounts that are relatively cheap? Or is the Celestron Advanced AVX is the bare minimum?"
astrophotography,3culci,Idontlikecock,2,Sun Jul 12 20:54:31 2015 UTC,The AVX/CG-5 are pretty much the minimum for DSOs.

Basically I'm looking for some advice on what the best intro-intermediate DSLR and lens would be for astrophotography while still being a solid everyday DSLR.  My plan is to focus exclusively on milky way shots in the beginning (since that it what interests me the most) then look into adding a telescope etc. to build my rig down the road.  my budget is ~1-1.2k for camera/lens/tripod.  Thanks for your help! :)

astrophotography,3culci,Idontlikecock,2,Mon Jul 13 02:10:32 2015 UTC,"Is the price of the camera included in the $300? And when you mean and stuff, what do you mean? Different objects require very different setups. Basically your set up will either be for planets and lunar photography, or for deep space objects (nebulae and galaxies). I just will let you know right now, DSOs aren't really possible on your budget, so I don't want to get your hopes up with that and stuff.  If you want to image lunar and planetary objects solely though, your best bet is a 8"" Dob, used would be your best bet."

astrophotography,3culci,Idontlikecock,1 point,Mon Jul 13 10:38:07 2015 UTC,"Telescope, imaging camera (could get a planetary imaging camera), mount, barlow, and if you get a DSLR, a T-Ring and T-Adapter."
astrophotography,3culci,robbiecol,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:29:38 2015 UTC,Would I need something to track the planets?
astrophotography,3culci,Idontlikecock,2,Mon Jul 13 16:27:00 2015 UTC,Not at all. You just take a video of them and track by hand. Any frame without the planet in it gets dropped.
astrophotography,3culci,phrique,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:30:03 2015 UTC,"Hi!  I really want to get into astrophotography; primarily of the planets at this point.  I have a Meade LX200 8"" S/C Telescope.  I have a Nikon D40 DSLR as well with an adapter to marry it to the scope, but from what I've read that's not a great DSLR for astrophotography.  Any suggestions?  Comments?  Thanks!"
astrophotography,3culci,IKLYSP,1 point,Mon Jul 13 12:04:40 2015 UTC,Well you have a good scope for planetary at least :) If I were you I'd buy a good planetary camera such as a ZWO ASI and try getting some planetary imaging done.   For deep sky the DSLR should be usable but it's a bit ancient so it won't be the greatest. Ideally you'd want something a bit newer but that can wait if you want to figure out the telescope first.  For the mount you'll need an equatorial wedge (assuming the LX200 is an alt-az fork mount) or a proper EQ mount so you can track the stars without field rotation. You'd also benefit from a reducer and a guider to help with the long focal length and high focal ratio.
astrophotography,3culci,robbiecol,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:24:53 2015 UTC,"Anyone with an 8 or 10 inch telescope, which do you recommend and what specific models?"
astrophotography,3culci,mrstaypuft,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:14:21 2015 UTC,"Depends what you're trying to image :-)  An 8 inch short-focal-length Newtonian is a much different animal than a long-focal-length SCT.  (To round things off, an 8"" RC falls in the middle somewhere, typically.)  I have the 8"" Orion f3.9 astrograph (newtonian), which is a short 800mm focal length.  It's my first scope (purchased in January), and I've been incredibly pleased with it as a starter scope.  It's excellent for wider field, long exposure photographs of medium-to-large DSOs.  At some point I'll upgrade to an RC, but that'll likely be years from now.  I see myself getting a lot of use from this guy.  Higher focal lengths SCTs will do great with shorter exposures of bright objects (like planets).  They can also work well for small DSOs (like planetary nebulae), but these require long exposures, which is a much taller order here -- The combination of a long focal length and slower optics makes accurate tracking and accurate guiding paramount.  Need a good mount, a good guide system, and good skies.  Hope that helps!  Let me know if I can answer anything specifically on the Orion 8"" I have."

At F/5.3 it's not as fast as an F/4 astrograph newt but it has a well corrected field without having to use a separate coma corrector and produces nice sharp images.   The downside is it's much more expensive than a conventional newtonian, but I think it was worth it."

astrophotography,3culci,IKLYSP,2,Tue Jul 14 11:55:23 2015 UTC,I like my IDAS D1. It doesn't seem to affect the colour much at all and lets through nebulae very well. I think it's similar to the P2 in terms of blocking wavelengths. It's supposed to be better than the CLS but I haven't used one so I don't know.  Obvious benefit of the CLS is you can use lenses with it as well as telescopes.

Researching in between nights,  Then trying again with minor improvements. However, in 2 weeks I am taking my family up to Austin, on top of a hill in a fairly dark sky. Id like to come away with a video of saturn to edit/stack later back at home.   My equipment: Mount: Orion Atlas Pro. OTA: LXD75 SN 10"" w/UHTC. Camera: Nikon d3200. Barlow: 2"" televue 2.0x.    I've been able to hook my camera up to the barlow (t rings and adapter). Focus saturn (too small to tell if true focused).  But when I record some sample frames. Saturn is VERY small. I can just make out the rings, however they are just a few pixels thick. Zooming in on the computer makes saturn a pixely mess. I feel like I'm missing something simple. A digital zoom before recording?  Not sure if my camera even has that. New to dslr as well.  Not sure what additional info I should give. My past few attempts have been lackluster, and I can't seem to find what I'm missing. I just want to use this rare dark sky opportunity to come away with something, anything.

I knew the scope was geared toward DSO. However the lxd75 manual covers basic planetary imaging. So I assumed it was achievable.  It's looking more like I'll have to use my phone through an eye piece for planetary?  And stick with DSO for the dslr?

Apologies, I don't have my own reference photo pulled from the test recording I took.  So small that when I crop the image,  it's nothing but pixels and a ring of pixels for the bands.  I'm unsure how to get saturn any larger with just the 2x barlow. Unless you digital zoom before recording? If all I get is what I'm getting I understand.

astrophotography,3culci,IKLYSP,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:03:06 2015 UTC,It's probably better to get a specialty planetary camera. It still won't be huge at 1000mm but with a barlow it'll be good if the seeing is decent. The cost may be a little high but I'll always recommend ZWO's ASI120 cameras.

I've been observing the night sky for ages, but haven't imaging for very long. I got started by wanting to show my friends what views you can get with a telescope without making them stand outside all night.   My main tip would be buy very nice equipment from the start.

If you can find skies dark enough you won't need an app to show you where the milky way is, you will see it clearly rising from the East.

I am looking for a cheap camera that does long exposure photography that I can set up with the telescope which has tracking via computerized motor etc. I don't need the best MP but I need to know if anyone knows any cheap digital cameras that have 1-3 second exposure timing. Preferably something under $150. We will be in joshua tree on friday and need something that I can order and have by friday. Doesn't matter if it is an old model or a simple digital camera, just want something with a decent long exposure so we can capture some of the bigger objects we can see in our telescope. Furthermore, I have an android phone with camera fv5 pro installed anyone had any success capturing large night objects with this set up? What is the most granular object I can expect? Thanks in advance."

If you've never done this before, try and shoot with a regular camera lens mounted on top of your telescope, don't try and shoot through the telescope. 1-3 seconds isn't long enough to capture anything, try 30 second shots of the milky way... again with a regular camera lens. Only thing that I would say is critical is make sure it has Liveview so you can focus easily."

I, like several posters in here, have an 8"" dobsonian, and I'd like to see what I could do with it as far as planetary imaging. I don't want to spend too too much right now because I anticipate I'll be buying a whole new more AP appropriate rig in the next couple of years that can have a mount, tracker, and all that other good stuff. Anyway, I need to get a camera. I'm currently using my iPhone with a mount a made myself, but obviously that isn't doing much and I don't wanna buy the $8 app a lot of people say you need.  So what camera should I get? On the orion website I've found two: there's this one, and this one. I'm wondering, should I even get one of these or just go ahead and get a real camera like a nikon t3i or something? My birthday is next month, so I'm planning on asking for these things and then using some of the money I made at my summer internship to get stuff. I'd prefer these investments to be able to carry over and not become obsolete when I get a new mount. Are either of these two cameras worth it or should I just go ahead and get a DSLR for a bit more?"
astrophotography,3culci,Idontlikecock,2,Wed Jul 15 21:06:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah, both of those cameras are pretty poor. If you want a dedicated planetary camera that you need to upgrade unless you got some serious scope, the ZWO ASI120 is a great option, as well as the QHY5L-II."

astrophotography,3culci,IKLYSP,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:22:58 2015 UTC,With a planetary camera focus is less of an issue since the sensor isn't as recessed as a DSLR. Also if you're into planetary you might want a longer focal length like an SCT or maksutov  cassegrain.

astrophotography,3culci,IKLYSP,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:19:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah it can be difficult to find the correct focus at night. If you have a street light or the moon up go into liveview mode and zoom in with that as far as you can. On my Canon I can go up to 10x digital zoom in liveview. That should help you focus.   Alternatively you could try focusing to infinity at 18mm during the day, then put a mark on the body of the lens to show where that focus point is."
astrophotography,3culci,ammonthenephite,1 point,Thu Jul 16 07:04:46 2015 UTC,"How long should my exposures be for DSO's?  Should my subs be exposed to the level I want my final image to look (i.e. expose so that space looks nice and dark around the object), or should I overexpose them to get more info and then lower the exposure in post processing?  I've been trying the slightly overexpose route, but it seems like it generates so much background noise (space looks like a medium to light grey instead of dark grey or black in my subs) that I wind up using a lot of noise reduction in post processing to kill all the added noise it generates when trying to tease out detail in the faint stuff that my backgrounds get a very mottled and 'processed' look to them.  Here is an image of the Trifid and Lagoon Nebulae I did the other day.  If you look at the background you can see what I mean by the processed look.    Should I try shorter subs and just more of them, cutting back on how much I expose?  Current histogram peaks are about half way across.  Where do you expose your histogram peaks to for your best results?  Thanks!"
astrophotography,3culci,yawg6669,2,Thu Jul 16 14:27:53 2015 UTC,"sub exposure length is dependent upon many factors, like mount quality, seeing, optical train f-ratio, guiding accuracy, camera sensitivity, etc.  I generally try to expost to get to about 1/3 of the histogram for a non HDR image.  More images are better to increase SNR, BUT you can't just take a million 1s photos and say its the same as five hundred thousand 2s photos (bc read noise).  Anyway, a general rule for sub exposure time is that your final image will look like a really good version of any given sub.  So, the subs should be long enough to bring out detail, and MORE subs will crush the noise."

It's a good combination and they work well together, especially with the magnificent mini guider you've linked.   Any of the magnificent mini packages are usable with an 80ED, it depends on your budget.

Thus, dark frames will likely help some.  Do some hard stretches on some dark frames at ISO 800, 1600 and 3200.  See which ISO shows the least patterns, (probably 1600 or 3200), then use that ISO for your astrophotos.

If you buy a 200mm lens (and I'm guesstimating, people with experience correct me) and a good tripod, you might get away without long exposures for M31. Like 5 or 10 second exposures might do the trick.  Matters how dark it is where you're imaging. Also the milky way and other Messier objects like M7 and M6 will be easy to photograph.

DSO imaging is not 1 single picture, but a multitude of images taken over a period of time stacked into one.  This is Andromeda if it were brighter You could easily get that with a camera and lens.. one thing I did to get an idea for DSO imaging was use a cheap eq mount with manual control and found a star on my finder scope and manually tracked it.. maybe try this first..

astrophotography,3cqhhf,HenriDutilleux,2,Fri Jul 10 02:23:46 2015 UTC,"Sorry to break it to you man, but imaging galaxies is extremely difficult. Apart from a dozen or so, they are all very dim and very small. $300 honestly won't get you much in the astrophotography world. You need to have a pretty good setup if you want to chase galaxies. If I were you, I would save the $300 and wait until you have about $1000. Watch AstroMart for used gear and buy when the price is right. For $1200, you could get a used Celestron CG5 or AVX, an 80mm achromatic refractor, and a DSLR. With a setup like that, there is a lot you can image. Tons of nebulas, some galaxies, a lot of globular clusters. I started out with a CG5, Stellarvue SV80ED, and a Nikon D700 and it was a good setup for years...then I got the itch and just recently did a massive upgrade lol.  The 1000D is a very old camera. It has horrible noise at any ISO over 800. You would be better off finding a much newer Nikon D3000 or D5000 series camera or the equivalent canon (I'm a nikon guy, I'm not familiar with the current Canon models). The newer cameras are infinitely better than a 1000D for low light and that is REALLY important. The more sensitive and less noisy the sensor, the better your images will be.  I would avoid trying to build your own mount. The mount is an extremely critical part to astrophotography. Without a stable, rigid mount, you cant image shit and it will frustrate the hell out of you. Get a used entry level motorized GEM mount."

The best thing about photography in general, and astrophotography in particular is that it's something I thoroughly enjoy, so there's hopefully a decent number of years left for me to continue to hone my skills.

astrophotography,3ck5h6,tashabasha,5,Wed Jul 8 16:25:26 2015 UTC,"beautiful image, congrats.  I wouldn't change a thing.    I'm currently doing 15 minute exposures with my Sirius mount, but I think I'm going to go for 30 minute exposures, looks like you're getting a lot more data in your exposures.  Are you having any issues with noise in your QSI 683?  I've got the same Kodak KAF-8300 in my SBIG ST-8300M and sometimes I wonder if I should have gone with a less noisy sensor.  How are you handling the noise in PI?  Are you using dark frames?  Wondering I should just skip the dark frames as I'm imaging at -20 C, although I've read they take away more noise than they add.  What is your modified hubble palette formula in Pixel Math?  I'm working on the Crescent Nebula narrowband right now and trying to find the right look with Pixel Math, I like this palette."
astrophotography,3ck5h6,yawg6669,4,Wed Jul 8 17:40:54 2015 UTC,"Thanks tashabasha!  The Sirius is a decent mount. It was actually the first mount I owned and I could do 30 minute subs back then. If you're managing 15 minute subs without issue, then stretching to 30 minutes is unlikely to cause an issue. There's definitely more S:N with the longer exposures based on my experience, though I did have an ICX694 chip where 10 minute exposures yielded a decent amount of data. The QSI683 is actually one of the better KAF8300 cameras in regards to noise, so yes, it's there, but at -20c with image calibration I get rid of a lot of it. PixInsight is then put through its paces to get rid of the rest. I'm using a couple of rounds of ATrousWavelet Transform, some MultiscaleMedianTransform, and some ACDNR on the RGB data. I don't often need to do anything on the HA/Luminance image. It comes out pretty clean.   I've always used darks with the KAF8300 chips ( I too had an ST8300M before the QHY22 before the QSI683) as well as bias and flats. I only used flats with the QHY22/ICX694 chip. While that seems like a pain, I create masters of the dark, bias, and flat frames once a season maybe, and just keep using them for each image. It's a slight pain, but nothing major.  The Sony chips are amazingly clean, but they're very small. If I wasn't having a good time with the QSI683, I'd definitely consider going to a ICX824 or the like. They'd be useful up to 1000mm of focal length I'd say, but after that (and even that high) you're really increasing your image scale and thus making it tougher to guide. It's also a matter of increased resolution at the expense of sensitivity. Those chips are really matched well to a short focal length refractor.   For the pixel math, I use: sii*.85+(.15*ha) R  (.25*ha)+(.75*oiii) G  OIII B  I'll fiddle with curves a bit to tweak the colours if need be.   I'm looking forward to seeing your Crescent. Make sure you shoot me a PM in case I miss it when you post it."
astrophotography,3ck5h6,ParticleSpinClass,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:49:50 2015 UTC,"just posted it.  :)  I think there's too much noise still, probably in the OIII I took during the full moon last week.  I didn't have an issue with focus during the sessions but it looks a little soft to me, not sure if that's due to the seeing conditions or the application of noise reduction without a mask.  Yours looks a lot more in focus and has a lot less noise than mine.    I'm also wondering if I should skip dark frames as I'm shooting at -20C to reduce the noise.  I go back and forth on this, when I have time I'll combine with darks and without and then measure the noise - I suspect there's less noise without but it's just a guess.  I also shoot darks and bias once a year and reuse the masters, but I reshoot flats every few imaging sessions (my camera's locked in so tight it doesn't move).  I'd also love to go with a Sony chip because they're so clean, but I agree that they're too small.  I love the FOV with the KAF8300 chips and that's the main reason I went with one (plus the price - the ST-8300M was on clearance at SBIG after they came out with the STF-8300M, saved like $500)."
astrophotography,3ck5h6,shinfenn,1 point,Fri Jul 10 12:34:40 2015 UTC,"Hey sorry for the lack of a speedy response. I've had family visiting and we took off for a few days. That's a great image.   Keep in mind that I use the HA for Luminescence which is where I do all of my sharpening and heaviest stretching, so on. I then use the combo of the 3 bandpasses as my colour data, but since L is what mostly gets displayed they act a lot like a colour map. It's that RGB combo where I process all noise reduction, and you can be reasonably heavy handed with it because the detail is in the L layer. You're effectively smoothing the background in the RGB image. What I do is somewhat similar to this (though he's using Photoshop rather than PixInsight like I do): http://astroanarchy.blogspot.com/2014/04/tone-mapping-v20-my-lecture-at-neaic.html  and J-P produces some killer images.   I always found that I needed full calibration of images when I had an ST8300M. It's a bit noisier than the QSI, but the noise can be processed out just the same.   We'll have to see how the landscape of chips plays out over the next few years. Sony is phasing out CCDs in favour of CMOS chips. If they can wind up coming up with a sensitive monochrome version somehow, and it isn't ridiculously priced, I'll have my order completed seconds after its arrival for purchase."

astrophotography,3ck5h6,RFtinkerer,3,Wed Jul 8 16:17:37 2015 UTC,"Thanks yawg6669!  I've been favouring combining the SII, HA, OII, and using a fully processed HA for luminance lately. It often results in a pretty decent pic. However, HA would overwhelm all but the strongest of OIII subjects (like M27 for example) so when blending the colour data it accounts for a reasonably small amount of the overall palette, thereby diminishing its strength. This was more ascetic than scientific in nature.   As for the mount, yeah, it's the single finest piece of equipment I own of any classification. I have to roll out my gear on a JMI Wheelybar (I lost my permanent observatory in my move across the country) and it takes maybe 5 minutes to become polar aligned and ready to image. Any previous mount that I had (and I had several) took 30-60 minutes to get lined up to be ready when starting from scratch each night. I haven't measured my PE, but suffice it to say, it's low. Like crazy low. In all fairness I haven't imaged at anything longer than about 900mm focal length, but my stars have been pretty tight except for the odd bit of cloud that can roll in an sabotage a sub.

astrophotography,3ck5h6,Le_Baron,4,Wed Jul 8 17:59:38 2015 UTC,"Thanks RFtinkerer!  I've only recently come into any processing prowess and that's after years of sticking with it. Part of the difficulty for me is that the weather in the Toronto area was pretty rotten for imaging a lot of the time, and I kept shifting my equipment leading to lengthy gaps in my image capturing and rather than keep at processing I'd forget half of what I had learnt previously, and would then have to relearn things all over again.   The point I'm trying to make is that you just need to stick with it, and keep reading tutorials, fiddling with processing, so on. My first image attempts weren't great by any stretch of the imagination. Of course that led me to spend FAR too much money on gear rather than spending time on beefing up my processing skills. Provided your data is good, one person can turn what you might think is crap data into a masterpiece while another would struggle with it.   Keep at it man. You bother because you love it. That is why you'll succeed."

This combo is really designed for just this very sort of image. Though I'm itching to go longer focal length, I really do owe it to myself (and to you now) a proper use of the already wide FOV that I have.   I'd probably wait until next month to start on those two, but can likely start something in Cygnus first provided the smoke from the nearby wildfires dies down a bit. Though they're starting to be visible during my small astronomical window (2300-0300), they're in that sweet spot where there's little weight on the gears in the mount which can lead to a bit of PE. If I'm doing a 4 or 6 panel mosaic, I'm gunning for mind blowing rather than mildly disappointing."

Just got the mounting hardware and am going to finish putting on the finishing touches tomorrow night.   What did you use for polar alignment scope? That's one thing I still need to figure out.   I just got a piano hinge that I'm going to use to replace the current hinge as there's a bit of slop in it. We went to pretty extreme lengths to ensure everything fits right and that there's no slop so I'm hoping that pays off like you said.   Here's the piano hinge.

astrophotography,3ciey4,zaubermantel,1 point,Wed Jul 8 23:04:34 2015 UTC,"Yes that's very similar to the piano hinge I used.   I haven't sprung for a polar alignment scope yet. I'm not convinced that it would offer a big improvement over just sighting down the hinge at the expected location of the celestial pole, especially since you'd have to align any scope really well with the hinge in the first place. The errors that I'm seeing in my images look more like vibration / slop than drift from bad alignment.   I could be wrong. If I did get a polar scope, it would be something like this"

I've been lurking here for a while and watching videos about how to take and process images.  I chose M13 because it's bright and high in the sky right now.  I took about 45 light frames, but ended up throwing out half of them because of star trails.  When I reviewed my pictures, I would get a few good ones, then a few with trails, and then more good pictures.  Is this due to poor alignment?  If so, why does it only affect some of the pictures?"
astrophotography,3cgiz9,mrstaypuft,2,Tue Jul 7 19:03:47 2015 UTC,Great job. To answer your question it's probably due to an imperfect alignment. If you're using BEOS then you should be able to drift align. Forest Tanaka has a video of it on youtube.   Or you might have bumped the telescope.
astrophotography,3cgiz9,mrstaypuft,2,Tue Jul 7 22:26:10 2015 UTC,"Looks like a great start!  Puts my starter pics to shame :-)  There are a lot of reasons the the trailing.  Beyond the external factors which will plague any mount (wind, you bumped it, etc), the most likely culprit for varying frame qualities are the inherent and varying errors throughout your mount's worm gear.  Parts of the gear will work great, others will introduce errors.  I don't know the exact length of the Sirius' cycle, but by comparison my CGEM is 8 minutes, and the Sirius is probably similar (maybe a minute or 2 shorter).  What may be happening is your ""good"" photos were taken on a good part of the gear, the bad ones weren't.  If you're familiar with it, this style of error is exactly what PEC tries to model and correct.  PEC is a predictive correction which will try to catch the error before it occurs.  PEC is trained over the entire length of the worm, and then will apply the correction over each worm cycle.  Guiding will also help this type of error, but it is reactive and will correct movement after it's occurred.  Using these 2 things together help account for this inherent gear error.  (Of course, since guiding is reactive, it helps with any errors, regardless of the source, including polar alignment offset, etc.)  Hope that makes sense.  Really nice photo, good luck on more!"
astrophotography,3cgiz9,astro-bot,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:27:18 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the tip about PEC.  That sounds like the cause, since there were repeating cycles of good and bad pictures.  My mount does support PEC so I'll figure that out for next time and see if it solves the problem."

This is was taken with a Canon SX50 that has a 1200mm equivalent lens: https://www.reddit.com/r/astrophotography/comments/33ttnm/iss_taken_with_handheld_canon_sx50/ -- so that sort of supports the ""about 1000mm for structure"" idea.

I think you could go for 1/200 or 1/320 exposure and adjust the ISO. I'm not sure if ISO 1600 is right, too low or too high, however try to get a lower ISO to avoid too much noise -- that could ruin some of the detail, as much as having motion blur from a too long expsoure."

I bought it a while back and haven't touched it much until recently. I've been doing nature shots mostly, but really thought astrophotography and pictures of stars would be interesting. Sorry to bother you with this, but your picture is so beautiful and we have the same camera. Any tips for someone just starting out? Like what lenses to purchase, other accessories?"
astrophotography,3cdvh0,CubicleByThePrinter,3,Fri Jul 10 01:05:56 2015 UTC,"Hello, I appreciate the input :)   Mine is a H-alpha modified Canon 600D, which gives it additional sensitivity towards H-alpha light. For this picture I used a light pollution filter (keep in mind that this does NOT eliminate light pollution entirely in the image, it merely reduces it). I also stacked 36 frames to reduce the noise of the raw image and I did some additional histogram streching in DSS as well as PixInsight.   In terms of lens selection and accessories, I think it depends on what you intend to capture. If you intend on imaging close ups of DSOs, you'll need optics with reasonably large focal lengths (preferably 200mm above). Ideally you'll also want mounts with the ability to track the movement of objects to allow long exposure photos.

You need to subtract the light pollution and scale the individual channels to get a decent color balance.  If you have the option, choose a daylight color balance.  Once you have the colro balance and light pollution subtracted, then stretching will bring out the colors."

It's a less powerful version of Photoshop, but powerful if all you're looking to do is enhance photos. It's very intuitive and fun and effective. But it's expensive. If you're the type to want to get it through TPB or something, it's easy.   Also, maybe by asking about post processing you were also referring to stacking? It doesn't look like your planet images were stacked (or maybe you just didn't play around enough with the wavelets). If you don't have software for this, Registax is a free astrophotography stacking program that is made for planetary imaging. I like it a lot, tons of tutorials on YouTube and elsewhere."

The small details and errors will probably stick out to keen eyes. Anyways...    I captured over 50 short videos with my DSLR, then imported the videos into Registax. It used the best 20% of frames. I then imported the best quality frames into Photoshop, and used Photomerge to stitch together a composite image. I imported the stitched photo back into Registax for wavelet adjustments, and then re-imported back into Photoshop and applied a liberal amount of High-Pass Filter. Some other basic adjustments were made in Photoshop, like refining the edges of the moon, and getting rid of any artifacts via healing brush. That's pretty much it. The longest part was Registax processing all of my videos.    My main inspiration is /u/_bar 's work. You should check him out. His moon shots are amazing."

The biggest issues I had were the bloated stars everywhere (a result of not stopping down the lens enough) and the extremely dark.. dark nebulae. They were almost black clipped right off the bat, so that was interesting.   I didn't really follow any particular flow. I did all color correction and noise reduction before stretching, and used a couple of range and star masks to combat the stars. I've found that unless you're striving for scientific usefulness, min/maxing the processing is a futile endeavor. People could spend an eternity debating pixel math and such, but really if the picture looks good at the end, what's the point. Make no mistake, processing is the most important step in AP and you should take your time here... but in the end doing noise reduction before or doing it after the stretch isn't going to make or break an image. The biggest thing in processing is having an eye for it. Being able to tell when you're overdoing it, and when the colors seem slightly too green. THAT will make or break an image."

astrophotography,3c84l1,SPACESHUTTLEINMYANUS,2,Tue Jul 7 04:33:40 2015 UTC,"First some comments on already posted results:  Bersonic:  Nice image, but some key parts of the dark lanes in the Milky Way are clipped losing faint detail.  It appears that one of the steps equalized the histograms making the color channels align.  This is kind of like auto white balance.  That step suppressed the reds, which are dominant in this scene.  For example, the Milky Way dust is reddish brown but is made more neutral in this image.  The fainter hydrogen alpha nebulae, e.g. to the lower left of Antares are completely missing. Many of the faint stars are lost.  Spaceshuttle*:  Better on the clipping side, but another histogram equalization step has muted the colors of the nebulae.  The stars are showing a lot of chromatic aberration.  The colors could be punched up with some curves work.  Image size is small so hard to evaluate things like faint stars.  The red nebula below left of Antares shows best of these three post processing examples.  Pleiadian:  A lot of clipping in the dark lanes. Colors muted due to another histogram equalization.  Stars are pretty good: many faint ones show, and star size is good.  A hint of the red nebula below left of Antares shows.  Here is my post processing attempt with details (I do have more to add and will do so when time allows) Toward the end, in the Enhance section are links to higher resolution results.  I need to add more to the Enhance section."
astrophotography,3c84l1,spacescapes,1 point,Mon Jul 6 19:59:19 2015 UTC,I like your edit. The image size on mine was so small because my internet was being slow. I struggle a lot with suppressing the purple chromatic aberration in my images.
astrophotography,3c84l1,htmwrx,1 point,Mon Jul 6 23:37:03 2015 UTC,"I said it below, but your edit has some amazing detail (although very saturated).  I couldn't seem to get that kind of detail out of it ignoring color etc.  Also I'm sure you are very aware of this, but chromatic aberration is a pretty big issue evident in every edit here.  Heavy saturation just makes it more so, even with your lens profile corrections.  I'd stop down the lens a bit to reduce the effect.  Not familiar with your lens, but I'm sure it would improve greatly even 1 stop down.  Edit: well, at least based on dxomark measures, the chromatic abberation actually doesn't get better when stopping down the 100mm f/2.  Weird cause my lenses have a pretty big difference when stopping down.  Checked the CA ""Profile"" measurements here: http://www.dxomark.com/Lenses/Canon/Canon-EF-100mm-F2-USM-mounted-on-Canon-EOS-1Ds-Mark-III---Measurements__436"
astrophotography,3c84l1,yawg6669,0,Tue Jul 7 03:43:12 2015 UTC,"While I agree that stopping down would reduce chromatic aberration, it would also reduce the amount of light gathered, and that you lose faint nebulae.  Both your version and mine have minimal chromatic aberration.  Don't confuse chromatic aberration with lens flare.  When stretching to bring out faint details, the lens flare is amplified, but remains the color of the star.   Note that the bright star above Antares (i Scorpio) has blue reflection nebula above and below the star, looking sort of like chromatic aberration."

astrophotography,3c749t,hooe,2,Sun Jul 5 14:24:52 2015 UTC,"You do look to be more in focus this time. I'm liking the details on the crater edges, these are good views. If you're still having trouble with focusing, try a bahtinov mask. You can easily make one out of cardborad using a blade, or buy one for cheap. Here's how to use one(not my video) Even manually focusing on a star and then pointing at the moon will give you a very sharp focus. I don't mean to harp on it, I think your images are great, I just want to make sure you have good resources to learn from and make sure you're getting the most out of your imaging sessions. Are you cropping the final images at all or are these the final images?"

astrophotography,3c3xz9,Idontlikecock,6,Sat Jul 4 15:17:15 2015 UTC,"If you could like to see my first attempt for a comparison, you can find it here.  Hi everyone! This was my first night with a new camera and lens (Canon 60D and f/1.8 50mm) and is from about 2 weeks ago.  This was 12x20"" pictures at 1600 ISO from a Bortle Class 4-4.5 area.   I stacked and processed in PI using /u/yawg6669's guide for DSLR processing in the side bar. I may try to process my next one using the guide by /u/Bersonic on how to edit using Photoshop instead of PixInsight and see how much of a difference it makes.  Kind of upset I missed focus slightly, but it was a new camera and I completely forgot to use live view to focus the lens (I didn't think about it since I couldn't do it on my old camera).  Still, very pleased with how this came out, never uploaded it because I was so upset over the missed focus. I was still very excited to see the Lagoon Nebula so well though since it is one of my favorite nebula.   I am missing all the DSO shots though due to the full moon so I thought this would be a nice way to change things up.   Hopefully now that I have my Orion Sirius in, I can get even better shots. My next shot will either be a panorama of the MW, a time lapse of the MW, or a stitched shot of the whole core with this lens. Just have to wait for the moon to go away (shakes fist angrily at bright blob in the sky).  Any questions or tips? Please let me know! :)"

If you don't care about that and want a cheaper solution Celestron makes a fixed T to 1.25 adapter:  http://agenaastro.com/celestron-1-25-universal-t-adapter-93625.html  I prefer the fixed adapters as there are fewer bits to fiddle with and they tend to be more rigid but that's a personal preference.

astrophotography,3c1is6,goober12,6,Sat Jul 4 19:22:04 2015 UTC,"tracking is when the mount moves automatically at the speed of the rotation of the earth to follow the stars.  It is more accurate the better the mount, but unless you have a really really really expensive mount, for long exposures you will need to autoguide/guide, which means having a 2nd camera locking onto a star and sending the mount real-time correction information when it moves.  The guide camera views its guide star either through a separate parallel-mounted telesecope or ""off axis"" guiding using the periphery of the light going into the main camera.  without autoguiding many entry to mid-level mounts can do exposures of a minute or so without problems (if they are well aligned and have things like periodic error correction).  with good autoguiding you can do much longer exposures."

However I have been wanting to get into taking pictures so I just recently bought the following two items (T adapter, T ring) to hook up my girlfriends's Canon 7D EOS camera. It fits ok but I can't really use my 10mm or 25mm lenses with the adapter, just the Barlow 2x. I can BARELY fit the 10mm lens in the T adapter and screw the T ring on but it isn't a good thing. It interferes with the camera shutter and it's a PITA to find anything with the 10mm lens through the camera viewfinder. What else do I need? Do I need to get special lenses or a different adapter? HALP!  Here is what I captured last night. http://imgur.com/a/Xdcfq"

It interferes with the camera shutter and it's a PITA to find anything with the 10mm lens through the camera viewfinder.    Uhhh. Are you putting an eyepiece in front of the T ring and then the camera. I don't think you should use eyepieces for AP with DSLRs just prime focusing.   The Barlow will increase your focal length (magnify) but that's it. Eyepieces are not going to help to my knowledge.  Should be OTA -> T ring/ adapter -> Camera
astrophotography,3c1is6,kilo4fun,2,Mon Jul 6 23:43:22 2015 UTC,Yeah I figured my T adapter is meant for lenses but not mine (it has the screw to hold them). I found another T adapter that will fit my lenses for eyepiece projection but it is pricey.
astrophotography,3c1is6,CNVsCauseASD,1 point,Tue Jul 7 03:38:31 2015 UTC,"Cool. Yeah I just looked up eyepiece projection. I usually use my iphone for that.   Your scope has a similar focal length as mine. Also it's a AZ mount, which is workable but impossible for longer exposures.   If you're interested, you can modify a webcam for planetary viewing and get really good results. Gary Honis has an awesome guide for a $40 microsoft webcam.   Note that you would probably want to purchase an IR cut filter if you use this method. Instead you can use your 2X barlow and 10mm eyepiece (~200x magnification) and build a platform to hold your iphone and do afocal AP with that.   I tried it and got amazing results. Make sure you have an app on your phone that can adjust the exposure and take video, stack in AK.   Clear skies!"

My budget is pretty low, and I am initially considering one of    Canon T5/T5i Canon SL1 Nikon d3200/d330   The Canon's seem to have better software support and as far as I can tell Canon is the brand of choice for astrophotographers.  However the Nikon's are supposed to have much better low light sensitivity and can reach a higher ISO. Unfortunately BackyardNikon doesn't support the d3xxx series.  What do you guys think?

As you say there is better software support especially if you expand to guiding/tracking with long exposures. If you do end up tracking then you won't need to worry about high ISO on the Nikon as you'll be using longer exposures instead.

astrophotography,3c1is6,mwhaskin,1 point,Tue Jul 7 05:27:22 2015 UTC,"Is there such thing as a 1x Barlow (or something that would do the same thing)?  I just bought an Orion xt8 yesterday after much drama of looking at other scopes. This has a 1200mm focal length which is great when it came to my refractor/camera set up. The moon fit comfortably in the frame for stunning pictures. However, since this is a reflector, I think I will have to use a Barlow to allow my camera to actually see anything. Multiplying the moon by 2 with that focal length an my camera would most likely make it way too big for the frame. I don't have it yet so this is all speculation but I'm pretty sure I'm right. Is there a way I can, without sacrificing quality, have my camera work with this beast and get a full moon? I think I may be able to get two halves of the moon and maybe stitch them, but that's above my skill so far.   If I find a link I'll add a current moon pic as a comment to this.

astrophotography,3c1is6,yawg6669,2,Tue Jul 7 20:23:34 2015 UTC,"No, a 1x barlow doesn't make any sense.  You can however, move the primary mirror forward which will shorten your focal length a touch, and move your focal point further out, thereby negating th eneed for a barlow."
astrophotography,3c1is6,Idontlikecock,2,Tue Jul 7 19:20:46 2015 UTC,"Well I don't think you'll need a focal length extender to achieve focus, but I have no experience shooting through an XT8, only looking. If you do though, the way Barlows work is by literally extending the focal length, so the point at which the scope focuses is at a different length. There is no way to extend that length, without changing the magnification (because focal length and magnification go hand in hand). The only thing I could think of would be a reducer to Barlow set up or something like that, but I have 0 idea if that would work. I know they make like 1.6x Barlow which is nice because it's not a huge jump up, but should be enough to help.  Sorry I don't know more to help you though."

astrophotography,3c1is6,Idontlikecock,2,Tue Jul 7 20:25:36 2015 UTC,"Pretty much none. They all require at least a second or so of exposure to pick up, and even a second long shot will give you some trailing at that focal length. You could try Andromeda, or Orion if it's out for you. Those are two of the brightest and easy to find, if you can't get either of those, I'd say every thing else is out. Definitely try out those two objects first though.  As for what you would need to take long exposure shots without $1000 dollars.... there isn't much, sorry to the bearer of bad news. Your best bet, if you already own the DSLR which I'm guessing you do, would be just take some wide field shots. Other than that, you'd need a mount and a telescope or a nice lens.

Some of the problem I noticed was that the planet was so small in the frame it was only being captured by a few pixels and therefore did not have much detail. If I used a barlow or 10mm lens it made it very difficult to line my cell phone up with the eyepiece. The Telescope is a Celestron 127eq (I know it's a bird jones and has limitations but it was what I could afford) I tried shooting with my nikon d800 and a t mount and also my galaxy s6 rubber banded to a block of wood that was clamped to the eyepiece. No post processing except to crop, turn the video still to 300dpi (to make individual pixels less noticeable and to do some slight sharpening.  as you can see the picture is blurry and you can not make out much detail.

Am I on the right track? Can I get more for my money? I understand that computerized telescopes aren't the best for beginners, or at least are recommended to stay away from.   I've looked at the ""What Telescope?"" link in the side bar, I did not get much information from it. Other than, that I need to spend 700+ to get decent galaxy photos, and at my budget I'd mainly be looking at planetary images.   Any help on equipment suggestions are appreciated.

What are the most ideal focal length, aperture, f-ratio, etc. for an entry level Planetary setup? Budget for the scope is probably $250. Are there certain telescopes that I should absolutely avoid?  I'm most likely going to modify a MS Lifecam per the suggestion in the sticky since I have one that I'm not using. Does anyone have experience with this camera have any comments on the quality or usability of the setup? Also, when using a camera in place of an eyepiece (like the Lifecam for example) what focal length would you use to calculate your magnification?  How well do collapsible telescopes work for AP?"
astrophotography,3c1is6,yawg6669,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:39:46 2015 UTC,"For planetary, you'll want a long focal length, like that with an SCT.  For 250 it will be difficult to get any usable scope.  Certain telescopes to avoid?  Anything that advertises ""power"".  No experience with the Lifecam, but to calculate magnification you use the native focal length of the scope."

astrophotography,3c1is6,Antioch,2,Wed Jul 8 22:15:44 2015 UTC,"Short answer, no. The eyepiece H-alpha filters meant for nebula don't have a sufficiently narrow bandpass. In other words they don't do a good enough job of filtering out light except for the h-alpha wavelength we want. The nebula filters have a bandpass of around 700 angstroms compared to a typical h-alpha solar filter bandpass of less than one angstrom. If you think a single filter is expensive some will stack a second filter just to bring the bandpass down to half an angstrom."

astrophotography,3bukup,PirateShiplol,1 point,Thu Jul 2 07:25:03 2015 UTC,"Just some quick advice that may help you not have to process as much. Make sure it's on manual (as opposed to auto) so you can select the ISO and exposure. Since the moon is so dang bright, set the ISO at 100 (or 200) so it won't have as much noise. If possible, use a remote shutter because just touching the camera will shake it and can cause blur. If you can't do that, use a 3 or 10 second time. Click. beep beep beep *shutter. Experiment with different exposures. When I am using my telescope I try a variety of things from 1/30 s to 1/60. The fuller the moon, the less time you need. Less time means less time for the earth to move which means less  blur.  That's all camera technical stuff but this is a big tip I learned one time. Point it at the moon and use the digital zoom to crank it up  to 10x. This won't make the photo bigger, but will help you focus. Make very slight adjustments to the lens when you are looking at a large crater until the edges become as crisp as possible. Just using the regular view to focus will get you close, but looking at 10x will allow you to pinpoint exactly where the focus is the best.   I'm not great at post processing but that is fine because a good moon picture won't need much. I turn the shadows up a bit which makes the black truly black (and not pixelly noise black). I also bump the sharpness a bit which brings out the craters some more. You can change the brightness/exposure if it's blown out which will bring out the subtle color changes on the surface. Last but not least, flip/mirror the moon so it appears just like it did when you see it with your eyes. This is really important when using a telescope but may not be needed for just a camera/lens.   Here is a shameless plug of a moon picture I took with my dslr/telescope set up. The telescope just acts as a really long lens.   Waxing Gibbous: http://imgur.com/a/w34ww  Waxing Quarter: http://imgur.com/a/kdnEn  Last but not least, shoot on RAW or as large of a JPEG as possible. This will have the most information and allow for easy/cleaner processing."

astrophotography,3btvu0,Emperor_of_Cats,6,Thu Jul 2 02:50:42 2015 UTC,"First of all, sorry for the horrible picture. It was pretty cloudy that night and that's the best one I could get. I also had to rely on my cellphone since I left my camera in my apartment about 2 hours away. Things look a lot better in person.  A bit of some backstory of how I fell in love with Astronomy and how the telescope came to be.  About 5 years ago, I was accepted into a highly competitive summer program. I was so excited! We got to choose 3 different courses we would like to take. I signed up for the 3 science-focused ones. I'll be honest, astronomy was my third choice and when I found out I was placed into it, I was a bit upset. However, I don't even remember what the two other classes were. It was going to be a great summer!  I received a letter from the professor with a list of materials that we would need to bring with us (wood, PVC pipes, screws, a foam ball.) I laughed and thought ""how are we going to build a telescope out of this?""  Well, a few days into the program, we built what you see in the picture (the professor provided the mirror and lens.) It's not much and it looks pretty horrible. Focusing it is a pain in the ass since you have to move the lens forward and back (a piece of felt keeps it in place, but it's far from precise especially if something is pretty high in the sky.) It's pretty good for the low cost. It can clearly see Saturn's rings and a few moons.  That's when I really started to fall in love with astronomy and where I started to get my feet wet in astrophotography. I haven't really got into it much (just point into the telescope and shoot), but I hope to start getting a bit better and doing some more advanced stuff (this subreddit has already been a huge help!) I have a few pictures I took from that summer that turned out really well. I will try and dig those up when I go back to my parents' house tomorrow. They are mostly pictures of the moon, Saturn (taken with huge dobsonians that we got to operate as part of the ""star show"" we hosted) and a couple of the sun."

I've seen pictures on here of some homemade equipment, but didn't see any homemade telescopes. I thought people might be kind of interested.  Picture was taken on a Droid Turbo. Not sure what the crazy blue is around the moon and I couldn't really get rid of it with the free editing tools on Windows. I just heard of this place not too long ago and I've really started looking into getting more involved now that I'm taking my telescope back with me (I'm visiting my parents and they've had it since I moved out for college.)"

astrophotography,3bes6r,soccerjonesy,2,Sun Jun 28 20:14:10 2015 UTC,"Well you also have to remember how small the sun is in the sky. You can cover it up with your pinky held at arms length. The same goes for the moon. Both are incredibly small even though we think they take up a lot of space in the sky. If it were visible, the andromeda galaxy would be like 2-3 times the size of the moon."

Luckily for me i was in the 'faint grey zone' for light pollution and the moon was below the horizon at 13%.  I used my nikon d5300 and shot the photos on my 200mm f/2.8 lens. exposure time of 3.5 seconds: 300 light frames and 60 dark frames. i used a normal tripod weighed down by sand bags. i would realign my viewfinder with the star, Deneb, every 20 photos or so.

astrophotography,3bcj4g,Seeker04,4,Sun Jun 28 04:26:30 2015 UTC,"I uh, need some help understanding the light frame/dark frame logic :D. I have only taken shots of milky way at 30 secs or below and received enormous star trails (only when zoomed in though). So basically I cannot use the one-shot-for-milky-way logic for andromeda when fully zoomed in?"
astrophotography,3bcj4g,Ecocide,4,Sun Jun 28 03:39:08 2015 UTC,"No, you will need multiple shots to get this much detail of Andromeda. If you are tracking, with a GoTo mount then you can do much longer single exposures. But if you're just mounted on a tripod, you will need to do many short exposures. In OP's case, he did 300, 3.5 second shots."
astrophotography,3bcj4g,ablitsm,3,Sun Jun 28 07:08:24 2015 UTC,"If I understand correctly more exposures only improves the signal to noise ratio, not the actual exposure. So stacking will not help if your individual exposures are to short (or polluted) to pick anything up.   Is that correct ?"
astrophotography,3bcj4g,Ecocide,3,Sun Jun 28 14:24:14 2015 UTC,"I believe so, but someone more knowledgeable should probably answer that one haha.   It makes sense though, however a lot of factors come into play. Such as him using a 2.8 200mm over a f/5.6 and different ISO settings detecting fainter light. I'd never be able to do a shot with this much detail, using my 4-5.6 200mm unless I got a tracking mount."
astrophotography,3bcj4g,total_zoidberg,3,Sun Jun 28 17:48:29 2015 UTC,"What you can do with a lot of exposures (300+) is improve the SNR, and so you increase brigthness after stacking (without brightening noise or posterizing the image). There's a limit to how much you can brighten the image this way before artifacts start kicking in, but it is possible to compensate an underexposed image this way."
astrophotography,3bcj4g,total_zoidberg,5,Sun Jun 28 20:41:59 2015 UTC,Here is the same setup of the andromeda galaxy i took months ago but only shot 80 light frames and 20 dark frames http://imgur.com/2eidnuv. I was able to get a lot more color and sharpness this time through so it must have some other benefit? maybe?
astrophotography,3bcj4g,total_zoidberg,3,Sun Jun 28 22:19:58 2015 UTC,"Well they were asking about changing exposure based on getting a lot of pictures. Yes, in general, the more pictures you can take, the better detail (either structural or color) you'll be able to get. But then there's also that thing that improvements are logarithmic, that means that (roughly) you need 4x images to ""double"" the quality of the image. So 4 images are ~2x better than 1, 16 images ~2x better than 4, 64, 256, 1024 and so on.   Once you reach that spot, it's better to start evaluating your (huge) library of images and only stack the best -- this is similar to what is done on planetary imaging, where your target is so bright you can do realtime 100fps videos and quickly get to 10k frames to work with."
astrophotography,3bcj4g,Seeker04,2,Sun Jun 28 23:36:58 2015 UTC,thanks! that helps put this in much better perspective for me. ive always wondered how many photos is enough before its redundant
astrophotography,3bcj4g,Seeker04,3,Mon Jun 29 01:32:32 2015 UTC,"Well, it's never ""redundant"" because you can always extract information from new data, but somewhere down the road you get to a point where you have to take X more shots (or X more minutes/hours of shots) and, knowing you have diminishing returns, you just say ""that's enough"".  There are beautiful targets to get out that need hours of data before becoming visible (some people even spread their observations over many nights). Your new image, compared to the old one, is better because you now have about 17.5 minutes worth of incoming light, compared to just 3.5 minutes you had in your previous image. This is usually called ""integration time"", and you'll read many people say ""integration time is king"".  Doing untracked, we're bound to short shots (1"" to 3 or 4"", if using a long lens, like you did), so we have to take a lot of pictures to increase our integration times. I'm looking into making a barn door tracker to comfortably get to 30"" exposures (my camera limit), you should do it too - or get a tracker."
astrophotography,3bcj4g,Ecocide,1 point,Mon Jun 29 03:14:29 2015 UTC,Then what do those dark frames mean? Just black shots (like with the lens cap on or something)?
astrophotography,3bcj4g,htmwrx,3,Sun Jun 28 21:13:27 2015 UTC,Exactly! Take the same photo with identical settings except with a lens cap on. I usually do a couple every 50 photos or so.  When you take dark frames you're basically recording all the errors that your camera inevitably makes even when there's nothing your camera can see. By combining all the dark frames you take you can make one master dark frame and subtract all those reoccurring random little errors from your data and subtract them from the actual light frames.
astrophotography,3bcj4g,Rooster_with_roses,2,Sun Jun 28 21:48:30 2015 UTC,So basically I'll need to learn how to do the subtraction now :-\ But thanks for the info though OP :)
astrophotography,3bcj4g,ablitsm,3,Sun Jun 28 22:25:08 2015 UTC,yeah no problem :) deep sky stacker also does it for you if you load them into the program. good luck!
astrophotography,3bcj4g,Ecocide,2,Mon Jun 29 01:25:15 2015 UTC,"Yes, these shots allow any dust on the lens/mirror to be removed from the final shot during stacking."
astrophotography,3bcj4g,Ryan907,1 point,Mon Jun 29 00:49:59 2015 UTC,I think that you're thinking of flat frames.  Dark frames remove the sensor noise.  Light frames adjust for any dust and vignetting in the imaging train.
astrophotography,3bcj4g,Ryan907,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:55:04 2015 UTC,"What ISO did you use? I'm not entirely sure whether it matters if you shoot at 1600 or 25600, as apparently there are two camps atm advocating either setting. My d3000 only goes to 1600 :(  Also: how did you find the galaxy? the field of view is quite narrow at 200mm.   nice shot though! This will be an example which I will try to recreate this summer!"
astrophotography,3bcj4g,Ryan907,1 point,Sun Jun 28 12:42:01 2015 UTC,"The highest iso ratings available on many cameras (often called extended iso range in the settings) are extrapolations of the highest native iso of your camera, for example, my 500D has a native iso of 3200 (my 5D only has a native iso of 1600), but I can expand it to 25600 (I think, never use it) and 6400 respectively.   Using these means underexposing and pushing in camera, this is different from using a higher gain on the sensor (using higher native iso) in that it does not actually increase exposure. You are doing the same as pushing the exposure slider up in lightroom or photoshop, not adding more data. This does not mean they are not useful, because they are. Noise is also not symmetrical on an exposure, and exposing to the right and then pulling the images will result in less noise.   The real value is a camera that both has a high native iso, and an acceptable signal to noise ratio when using sensor amplification. Heat becomes a problem in certain scenarios.   Imaging on my 5D with ISO 1600 results in much cleaner images then the 500D on ISO 1600, but if I stack the 500D the difference goes away, and the 500D can even outshine it sometimes because it has a higher resolution sensor (but much smaller pixel pitch, so that plays in as well).   Interesting note is that many iso ratings are also pushed and pulled from another, and this may vary wildly between manufacturers. Have a look at this page on the magic lantern wiki for some anecdotal data: http://magiclantern.wikia.com/wiki/ISO  I believe the Sony full frame mirrorless cameras are currently the best in the noise department when it comes to consumer sensors. But I don't really keep up with the latest developments in camera sensors anymore."
astrophotography,3bcj4g,nexguy,1 point,Sun Jun 28 14:38:05 2015 UTC,"I don't think I gave my ISO much thought when I was out shooting, It was at 2500. Which is just what I find comfortable on my camera when i'm taking photos. Any above that and my already noisy photos become unbearably noisy.  your camera might be pretty noisy at 1600, but that's why you got to take lots of photos (light frames and dark frames) so you can get rid of all that extra noise! If you had the patience you can take great photos at only 1600 ISO, you should just try to collect as much data as possible when you do shoot! And to find the galaxy I kinda just wing it and usually can find it pretty well. My lens is 70-200mm so I start taking exposures facing the correct area of the sky at 70mm until I can see the smudge of andromeda and then I zoom in on it little my little until I have it in the middle of my frame and i'm at 200mm. I also use a great app called sky guide which helps me find where i'm looking. Sometimes I find my objects that i'm photographing right away and sometimes it can take 30 minutes to finally get it right, it's different every time. And thank you, that means a ton! Good luck!"

I use a Canon T4i so can get away with 15 seconds untracked at 18mm before star trails are too much.

Yawg's sentiment about refractors sometimes needing slight collimation tweaks is fair, but the extent that you're seeing isn't slight by any means.  I wonder if maybe your camera/focuser/flattener is not flush to your scope.  To troubleshoot this a bit without buying more things, try taking a handful of images at different camera rotations. Share the results here, as that would be helpful in diagnosing what you're dealing with. I would also consider rotating all of those parts independently if you can.  The other thing is maybe you could be causing this by not letting your scope's temperature cool/heat to ambient. I could see this maybe being caused by the temperature being different between each piece of glass in your scope."
astrophotography,3b8tcq,yawg6669,1 point,Sat Jun 27 00:33:24 2015 UTC,"Good point, didn't think about that.  Yea, different glass temps would look like collimation as well.  Hrm......"
astrophotography,3b8tcq,RabidNelson,1 point,Sat Jun 27 05:57:32 2015 UTC,"Okay, I'll try rotating the camera/field flattener in relation to the telescope next time I'm out. If the rings rotate with the camera, I suppose that would rule out the scope.  The temperature thing makes less sense to me, because I've already gone shooting in a variety of circumstances and the patterns are very consistent. Staying outside with my scope for hours does not correct the issue."

Not quite sure the aperture of the kit lens but the lower the f number the more light the lens will receive. I would suggest getting a http://www.amazon.com/Rokinon-FE14M-C-Ultra-Canon-Black/dp/B003VSGQPG or a lens of similar caliber with a low aperture number. That being said im sure you can still take aurora pictures with the kit lens it would just look much better the lower aperture you have. And also if your just getting into this i would suggest getting a $200-300 tracker which will allow your stars to be pinpoint without them trailing ( i personally use ioptrons)

astrophotography,3b8tcq,Dontcallmeshirlie,1 point,Sat Jun 27 23:22:44 2015 UTC,"I've never taken pics of the AB, so take this advice as expectation not experience.  First, start off with the 18-55mm lens.  Not only will this lens capture more of the sky/lights, but the aperture (f-stop) will be lower.  Lower f-stop means a brighter picture, but a more precise focus will be needed.    (tip) During the daytime, focus your lens on an object far away from you (farther the better).  Make a note of where the lens ring is for this focus.  That way, when you take your night pictures if your camera can't focus on the lights you'll know exactly where to focus it manually.  Now it's time to make some choices.  First, your ISO.  The higher it is, the more light your camera can absorb making for nice, bright AB shots.  However, a higher ISO also makes your shots look grainy.  I try to avoid going above 1600 myself if I can help it.  Next comes exposure.  The longer your exposure, the brighter your shot.  However, the AB is constantly moving as your camera is taking the picture.  It won't move enough to notice at 1/100th of a second, but a 10 second exposure will create a blur everywhere the AB has been.  This blur will be compounded by YOUR movement, so use a tripod!  So, hopefully the lights are nice and bright, and you can use a modest ISO and a short exposure time.  If not, you'll have to choose between wavy blurs or grainy shots.  Here are some examples:  Picture 1: Taken with a 14-24mm lens, 6 sec exposure, ISO 800.  See how the lights look as if they're smeared upward?  That's the long exposure time.  Picture 2: 24mm 1.4f lens (1.4f allows for a lot of light), 6 sec exposure, 800 ISO.  To get something comparable to this (assuming the AB is as bright for you), you'll need to increase the ISO or exposure time since your lens will not have an aperture this low.

If not that lens, you can grab this guy on a tighter budget for $330 (may be cheaper elsewhere or used).   Do you have a mount for a telescope? You have to figure it into the equation, a decent mount you can pick up used, but even then, you're still looking at spending $700+ depending on what you buy. As for the telescope, a standard ED80 refractor is what most people use and is a pretty safe bet. You could always go with a 65/66mm or 71mm or something like that with a smaller focal length."

The moonlight will likewise limit your exposure time due to background clipping. Your color will be skewed due to the moonlight.  Fortunately, this can usually be well-compensated in post processing through color calibration.   Shooting opposite the moon will certainly help, but the above points are still major considerations.  I find moons less than 50% phase to be very easy to work with.  Above this, I've found it to pose exponentially increasing difficulty.  If it's above 80%, I'll usually just work on PEC and/or do some learning with the tools.  ...but not always.  I did shoot NGC2403 under an 88% moon.  It was opposite the moon the night I shot it.

I have had lots of fun looking around and getting some new lens, as well as acquainting myself at least somewhat with how to use this thing. (Do you ever really figure it out?) Now, I want to start doing some photography.   I am looking into getting a camera. One that I think would be good, considering I'm on a budget, is the T3i. I am seeing some for around 300-350$ used. Is this a good buy?  What are some other options? I don't want a webcam necessarily, because than I will just want to upgrade to a camera.  My goal is to get some great shots of the moon, planets, as well as of some galaxies and nebulae.   Thanks"

If you ever want to ""upgrade"" it down the line, you could send it in and have the hydrogen alpha filter removed, but there are other things you should spend money on before that.  In my opinion, the best camera for Astrophotography, is what you get the best deal on (as long as it is a decent camera). Check Astrobin out and search the camera name, all pictures taken with that camera will show up and give you a good idea of what to expect. :)"

astrophotography,3b6qmg,verylongtimelurker,4,Fri Jun 26 12:35:09 2015 UTC,"Ugh, I just typed out a super awesome reply from my phone and accidently hit cancel instead of send!  Anyway, what I said was this:  To answer your question, I use ABE/DBE on linear (i.e. non-stretched) data, as I have found that it does a better job for my data sets.  Now, I can't say if this is the ""correct"" way or not, just that it seems to be what works best for me, and others with similar gear and data sets as mine.  I think before we can get a really robust community response on this, a little elaboration on the histogram, and histogram stretching is needed.  I'll admit, I don't really know what's going on when one ""stretches"" a histogram, so can you explain here?  Here is my current understanding, please fill in the gaps.  If you consider an image to be a 2D array of pixel values (0-255) for a simple 8 bit image, then each pixel has its own value, and it can be plotted brightness (x-axis) vs. number of pixels with that value (y-axis).  Cool, got it.  Now, when you ""stretch"" the data, your resulting product is ALSO a 2D array of pixel values, but the relationships between the actual pixel values within that image have changed, i.e. the histogram has spread out more, or been ""stretched"" (widened).  Since the resulting image is just a 2D array of pixel values, and the starting image is just a 2D array of pixel values, there MUST be some relationship between them, presumably some behind the scenes math that I don't know shit about.  That being the case, can you explain the math a little bit without just pasting confusing equations everywhere (for me and other readers of this thread)?  I think understanding what is going on when you stretch, what is it that is making your data go ""non-linear"", knowing about THAT will help everyone to answer as to whether or not subtraction should be done before or after stretching.  At least, that's where I stand on it.  My next point is that I think there's a difference between the ways that people do AP.  Some people just want to make pretty pictures, and so they don't care if their method produces the absolutely mathematically correct output, it just needs to look ""good enough"" to them.  Personally, I am the analytical, pedantic, picky type of person who likes to know everything and have every little detail correct, and dislike it when others say things that are not correct.  HOWEVER, I have found that when people start off their statements with ""this may not be technically correct but..."", I tend to give them a LOT more leeyway than I otherwise would.  So perhaps, in these types of conversations where we really are drilling down to the core of the question, we (people like you and I that is) can accept ""this may not be technically correct but it gives images that are good enough for me"" as a reasonable ""ok, fair enough"" middle ground.  Now, if others out there want to insist that there is more than one correct way to background subtract, and want to get into the nitty gritty details of the subtraction event (which imo is tied to the histogram stretching event), so be it, let's argue math!  But I think the conversation is more a matter of side of the AP coin you are on, 1) the absolutely mathematically most robust, analytically rigourous (I put that extra u in there for you  :)  ) way possible, or 2) the way that works well enough such that one is happy with one's images.  I don't think anyone can say that one SHOULD follow 1, or SHOULD follow 2, as that is a matter of personal preference, but IF one is insisting that 1 and 2 are equal, well, to me that sounds like a falsifiable claim, so let's dig!  In captain Jean-Luc Picard's voice Community, engage!"

What happens in linear to non-linear is seen best in wikipedia about gamma correction: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_correction. Long story short, gamma correction changes the dynamic range of an image to make it look closer to the way the human eye sees."
astrophotography,3b6qmg,total_zoidberg,1 point,Fri Jun 26 15:56:52 2015 UTC,"changes the dynamic range    HOW?  Through what procedure?  I know WHAT it does, I'm asking HOW it does it."
astrophotography,3b6qmg,yawg6669,1 point,Fri Jun 26 15:58:00 2015 UTC,"Quote from Wikipedia:  ""Gamma correction is, in the simplest cases, defined by the following power-law expression: Avout = A * Vingamma""  You take every single (RGB) value in the image, raise it to a power and multiply it by a constant. If your gamma is high (gamma > 1), it results in ""darker"" images, because higher values will grow exponentialy. If your 0 < gamma < 1, then it gives a brighter image."
astrophotography,3b6qmg,total_zoidberg,1 point,Fri Jun 26 16:22:30 2015 UTC,"ok, is that what ST and PI are doing then?  If so, it's not really that complicated."
astrophotography,3b6qmg,yawg6669,2,Fri Jun 26 16:23:18 2015 UTC,"If it's ""just gamma correction"", yes. But you can also use the curves tool to adjust the image (through a spline, a polinomal or an arbitrary output for every value of the input), and maybe use a different curve on every channel. And then it's a huge mess.  Note: gamma correction can be seen as a curve-adjust using that specific formula."
astrophotography,3b6qmg,total_zoidberg,1 point,Fri Jun 26 16:30:15 2015 UTC,"Ok, that makes sense.  So if it is indeed the case that a histogram stretch is just the application of that gamma correction formula, I don't see why you can't subtract light pollution AFTER stretching.  luker needs to chime in here."
astrophotography,3b6qmg,yawg6669,2,Fri Jun 26 16:37:07 2015 UTC,"Problem is that when things get messy, what was once a constant value (LP) is now changed through a function. And if you want to subtract that, you have to apply the same function to what you subtract. I posted a simple ""example"" that shows some of the problems with LP correction after curves/stretch, but I'm sure there are some edge cases that didn't get well represented in that."
astrophotography,3b6qmg,total_zoidberg,2,Fri Jun 26 16:52:03 2015 UTC,"The explanation is pretty simple. A CCD counts incoming photons (with a particular success rate dictated by the QE, but that's a whole other discussion). If for a moment we forget about other small influences, the amount of photons that it counts per pixel is simply;  signal total (ST) = signal object (SO) + signal light pollution (SLP)  If we're after SO, it's plain to see that if you know SLP, you can subtract SLP from ST to arrive at SO. It turns out that SLP is pretty easy to model; SLP is typically a simple bias, or a gradient. There are a number of tools available that can help you model SLP such as GradientXTerminator (Photoshop), DBE (PixInsight), Wipe (StarTools), etc. Or you can just pick a single bias for all pixels (which rnclark suggest), which can work quite well if the bias doesn't look too much like a gradient. Sweet!  To demonstrate let's take three pixels.  STP1 = 0.9  STP2 = 0.5  STP3 = 0.3  Let's say that we have observed the light pollution SLP to be 0.3 across all pixels. Then;  SOP1 - SLP = 0.9 - 0.3 = 0.6;  SOP2 - SLP = 0.5 - 0.3 = 0.2;  SOP3 - SLP = 0.3 - 0.3 = 0.0;  Cool - now we have the real signal for both pixels; happy days, we can start stretching these now (we could/should normalise these results, but let's ignore that for a moment). Let's use a simple 2.2 gamma function to stretch the signal.  (SOP1 - SLP)1/2.2 =  (0.9 - 0.3)1/2.2 = 0.793  (SOP2 - SLP)1/2.2 =  (0.5 - 0.3)1/2.2 = 0.481  (SOP3 - SLP)1/2.2 =  (0.3 - 0.3)1/2.2 = 0  Great, original signal stretched (much more visible to the human eye), no light pollution, an SO of 0 is now indeed 0 in the case of P3). All is well (again - we may want to normalise the data but that's not important right now).  So far, so good, but now let's see what happens when we stretch the image first with a non-linear function with the light pollution still in place.  (STP1)1/2.2 = (0.9)1/2.2 = 0.953  (STP2)1/2.2 = (0.5)1/2.2 = 0.730  (STP3)1/2.2 = (0.3)1/2.2 = 0.579  How much should we subtract for the light pollution, now that SLP has been stretched along with the total signal? And that's the rub! Instead of being able to subtract a constant, the right amount to subtract is now dependent on ST; there is no longer a constant we can easily subtract!  Hmmm... Can't we just subtract a gamma 2.2 corrected SLP then (e.g subtract SLP ^ (1/2.2) from the numbers above)? Nope. But let's try;  ((STP1)1/2.2)  - (SLP1/2.2) = (0.91/2.2)  - (0.31/2.2) = 0.953 - 0.579 = 0.374  ((STP2)1/2.2)  - (SLP1/2.2) = (0.51/2.2)  - (0.31/2.2) = 0.730 - 0.579 = 0.151  ((STP3)1/2.2)  - (SLP1/2.2) = (0.31/2.2)  - (0.31/2.2) = 0.579 - 0.579 = 0  An SO of 0 is now indeed 0 (in the case of P3), so what we're doing appears to be correct, but we've subtracted way too much for P1 and P2 compared to the 'correct' way of subtracting light pollution. Were we to subtract less than SLP1/2.2, then we'd leave some bias in the darker pixels such as P3. Ergo it is impossible to find a constant that you can subtract that will yield the correct pixel value for all pixels once you've stretched your pixels non-linearly (and if it weren't clear yet, subtracting a constant is what you do when you move your black point to the right)  It all comes down to this;  ST1/2.2 - SLP1/2.2  != (ST - SLP)1/2.2  just like  42 - 22 != (4-2)2  Sequence matters a lot in image and signal processing"
astrophotography,3b6qmg,rnclark,0,Sat Jun 27 05:21:14 2015 UTC,It is not just a gamma correction.  It is linear at the low (where it matters in this case) and a variable gamma correction at the high end where intensities are so high it makes no difference.
astrophotography,3b6qmg,mrstaypuft,0,Sat Jun 27 03:06:40 2015 UTC,"It is linear at the low (where it matters in this case)    None - that is NONE - of the curves that are in use in RAW converters (sRGB or BT.709) are linear around the the brightness levels where the bias due to light pollution sits. Even if there were areas where they are linear, it is of absolutely no consequence to the crux of the issue. You cannot subtract a constant in an image where pixels have been non-linearly transformed and expect to end up with a visually correct result."

astrophotography,3b6qmg,rnclark,1 point,Sun Jun 28 01:39:11 2015 UTC,"Given the state of current software, what is so ""rigorous"" about the first method? It's just clicking on a process icon in PixInsight at a certain step in the development of an image   It is more than clicking a box that does everything. The traditional process includes measuring darks, flats, and bias frames.  Some people develop libraries of master darks at different temperatures.  Then you need to determine the temperature you imaged at then find the same temperature darks in your library and apply them.  You need special software to handle all these things.  The new method is little more than convert raw, stack and stretch.  Stretching includes subtracting sky as desired.  No special software needed beyond what is common in many image processing programs and raw converters that you would use for daytime photos.  New software comes at a double price: the price to buy it and then learn it.  That can be significant if you already have software that could do the job with newer methods.  Edit: clarification"
astrophotography,3b6qmg,tashabasha,2,Sat Jun 27 20:56:24 2015 UTC,"double the price, but think of the amateur and how much your camera costs, versus buying a used 1000D and a PixInsight license?  I could probably buy a telescope, mount, and autoguider in addition for the same price as your camera.  I only need to take flats after every session, which isn't a big deal, and I've got the library of darks and bias frames.  PixInsight can scale the darks so temperature or exposure time isn't an issue.  It's not a big deal at all to run a script in PixInsight, click a few process icons, and you've done it at the linear stage.  Not sure that ""rigorous"" is really an issue for #1 that should be considered when evaluating #1 and #2 methods."
astrophotography,3b6qmg,rnclark,1 point,Sun Jun 28 01:34:44 2015 UTC,"The learning curve for the amateur photographer who already has been processing daytime images is a huge leap to switch to a traditional linear workflow and astronomical software.  And it is even larger for those who haven't done any kind of digital processing.  It is much simpler to start with tone curve data and a reasonably modern camera with on-sensor dark current suppression to make the job easier.  The 1000D is very old technology.  Sure one can use old technology, but then one may be forced into correcting unneven dark frames, which limits how faint one can get.  Even a newer camera like a 70D can do 4 to 6x fainter in the same time period due to more efficient sensor and lower noise floor.  Old cameras are like beating ones head on the wall to get real faint compared to newer cameras of the last few years."

astrophotography,3b6qmg,tashabasha,1 point,Sun Jun 28 16:09:25 2015 UTC,"What do you think are the benefits of using #1 over #2?    Use #1 when you want to do precise photometry.  #2 is fine for producing nice images.  #1 is necessary for older DSLRs and CCDs without on-sensor dark current suppression, or if the sensor has banding (pattern noise) that could be reduced by the traditional method.   Seems like you're saying that your method (#2) is an easier way to start out in amateur astrophotography. Do you think it is a stepping stone to #1?   Not at this point, unless one wants to do precise photometry.  (Note method 2 can still be used for photometry is a few percent without too much effort).   The advancements of DSLRs mean simpler operation, so there is no need to use old methods if one is interested in making nice images of the night sky."

astrophotography,3b6qmg,rnclark,3,Sun Jun 28 02:47:52 2015 UTC,"I was expecting pretty pictures and got none, so I did an approximation of LP with and without stretching. I started from this picture: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:The_Orion_Nebula_M42.jpg . I did curves to ""linearize it"" (this was done with a steady hand, not through a formula), and added a constant orange-ish colour -- RGB(77, 38, 0) -- to it through a layer. This is taken to be the ""base image"": http://i.imgur.com/rRC7jQF.jpg  LP before curves:   Subtract the constant color (picked with the colour picker from a dark spot in the image): http://i.imgur.com/cv3JQll.jpg Curves: http://i.imgur.com/dPJwonc.jpg The result is close to what was seen in the original image. The fainter details were lost when ""linearizing"" the image, but colours are close to correct.   LP after curves: * Curves: http://i.imgur.com/iC4MtW3.jpg * Subtract color: http://i.imgur.com/MrKNitI.jpg * White balance (through click white): http://i.imgur.com/wNIm2RS.jpg * Curves (slight touch to the green channel): http://i.imgur.com/RTnLfc9.jpg  Now it looks closer to what it should look. But there are still some small differences with the result from the other method. To higlight those, I took both ""final images"" and got the difference -- then I (linearly) stretched the values to make them brighter: http://i.imgur.com/IQxWct3.jpg  Moral of the story:   This is just a ""simulation"" I did in 20 minutes to get an idea of what is happening, not absolute truth.   It would be very interesting to see it done on a real case to get a better experiment.  With LP after non-linear colour transforms, I had to keep adjusting the image to get closer to what was originally ""imaged"".   I had to re-do white balance because the subtraction-after-stretch threw it off the window. And then again to get rid of that green tint. I think every extra operation degrades data, and thus affects the ""correctness"" of the final result. It can also posterize the colours of the image.    All in all, the ""wrong"" method gives a lot more work and degrades the final result."

Basic workflow in Pixinsight (background extraction/neutralization, scnr, denoising, etc).  So, my question.  My raw images straigt from the camera look like this. (a quick jpeg export of how the raw looks). They have far more color to them.  If you zoom in to the core, you see much more golds, greens, purples, and blues.  But after all I do in pixinsight the images come out looking like the final, have lost much of that wide color variance and intensity.  Its this way with all the images I've tried so far no matter the subject.  For some reason, when I debayer the images they loose about 15-20% of their color, and when I integrate/stack the images, they lose another 20-30% of their color.  No matter how much I push the color saturation of the final integrated image, I just lose a lot of color and the final image looks far less colorful than just the single raws/.arw's.  If I first convert the raw's to .tif's, then I lose none of the color of the debayering process as I don't need to debayer, and only lose a little in the stacking process, but I was under the impression that there is much more info in the original .raws so its better to work with those.  Anyone else run into anything similar?  I've checked to make sure I have the correct debayering settings (vng and rggb matrix) and I normally use percentile when stacking as I almost always have less than 10 images.    Or is it ok to use .fit conversions without losing much of the information in the raws?  Any comments, questions or snide remarks would be helpful.  I've only had pixinsight for about a week so I'm still learning.  Didn't find much on the web with the 'ol google search either.  But thanx in advance for any info ya'all can send my way.  I'm off to bed tonight but I'll get back to anyone that might have any advice tomorrow after work (or during if its slow enough)."

I came across this the first day I bought pixinsight, and its been a ton of help, thank you for recommending it.  My issue though is that my color is all ready gone, even before I would start this tutorial.  By the time I've debayered and integrated, my image is a washed out, almost completely desaturated image compared to the raw that came out of the camera.  So, in my mind, something during those initial first steps as the original integrated image is created is stripping color from them and I just don't know what it is.  Even though the rest of the image looks better with multiple images stacked in pixinsight, if I just use one single raw or use raws converted first to tiffs and then do some processing to it, the color is way, way better and far more saturated.    Gotta love a steep learning curve, heh."

I'm in a very light polluted area though so I can't see much at the best of times.  Tbh the long focal lengths are worth it just for planetary viewing alone :P Saturn always looks incredible.
astrophotography,3b6g65,Idontlikecock,2,Fri Jun 26 15:30:18 2015 UTC,"That's what I'm thinking. There is also an 8"" Dob for sale, but I figured I could always throw the 8SE on my Sirius if I ever wanted to take pictures of super small DSOs. I just want dat 2032mm focal length hnnggg. Also I feel like the 8SE would be a little more portable than the dob."
astrophotography,3b6g65,burscikas,1 point,Fri Jun 26 15:39:03 2015 UTC,"Yup. Plus the tracking on the SCT if you're putting it on a Sirius would be very useful for planetary imaging, trying to track planets manually with a dob can be annoying.  I'm not sure how well it'd work for imaging DSOs, but you'd definitely want to invest in a focal reducer leaving you with about 1200mm of focal length and a faster focal ratio."
astrophotography,3b6g65,yawg6669,2,Fri Jun 26 15:53:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah, if I ever wanted to do normal DSOs, I'd just use an 80mm refractor. I would only consider for super small objects like the ring nebula, or some small galaxies like M104. I'll definitely buy a focal reducer though if I ever want to do anything other than planets."
astrophotography,3b6g65,burscikas,3,Fri Jun 26 16:03:02 2015 UTC,"Hi guys, im trying to figure out which scope would be better for visual and/or planetary photography. C9.25 SCT or 180 MAK. Main points- C9.25 has bigger aperture, but bigger central obstruction (36%) too, MAK has smaller (24%) CO, but smaller aperture. price differs mak- 1k€, C9.25- 1.7k€. i have found MTF graph for C9.25 (http://www.damianpeach.com/images/articles/c925/fig03.jpg), but not for 180MAK, but from what i gather, MAK has better MTF. PROS/CONS for both of these scopes and why should i get one and not the other? Im really liking the 180MAK though :)  P.S. where i should look for used scopes to ship to Lithuania?"

Depends on the focal length of your telescope."
astrophotography,3b5m94,mar504,1 point,Fri Jun 26 05:12:31 2015 UTC,If budget is your main concern I'd recommend finding a smart phone adapter for your telescope. Its a great way to get a taste of imaging without going all in.
astrophotography,3b5m94,sndwav,1 point,Fri Jun 26 15:04:19 2015 UTC,"Using your phone's camera against the eyepiece is a good way to get your first shots of the moon or planets for cheap. If you want to move up from there get a DSLR that connects directly to the telescope (prime focus).   Equipment and accessories will largely depend on what kind of astrophotography you want to do. Do you want to shoot the moon and the planets? Do you want to get wide star fields? Do you want to take pictures of small and dim deep space objects like nebula and galaxies?   You will want the right tool for the right job, this can be an extremely expensive hobby depending on what you want. I would almost suggest ditching the telescope and using DSLR and regular camera lenses at first to get some good shots and experience. Nice thing about that is you can use it for daytime stuff too.  What telescope did you get? Or more importantly, what kind of mount is it on?"

Personally I'd recommend just making quick visual observations of the planets, processing images from the previous season, upgrading your setup, reading tutorials etc.   But at least you're lucky enough to have 2-3h of darkness so you can occasionally go out if you don't have anything to do the next day :)"

I've been trying to get an image of M13/Globular cluster in Hercules, I've stayed out maybe 4 nights trying to get it but haven't gotten anything yet. As a beginner it seems like a reasonable goal to aim for, it's viewable in the eyepiece (bloody pretty too), and right now it's very high up in the sky for less atmospheric interference.  The equipment used is a Celestron 130EQ +Nikon D3200, after finding M13 in the eyepiece I lock everything as tight as I can and insert the DSLR as gently as possible but the weight of it always moves the scope and I have to find it with the eyepiece again. I even tried to relieve some of the DSLR weight with a second tripod, but that didn't work  I've often been getting frustrated with the hobby lately, it sucks when the sun starts to come up and you failed to image an object.

astrophotography,3b0k0b,bbmm,2,Fri Jun 26 02:46:10 2015 UTC,Very nice. Can we see one of the individual frames? I'm curious how much the stacking improved things.   Sure! Just uploaded a single frame on the same page!  http://www.astrobin.com/189608/B/   What's the aperture of the refractor?   Roughly 600mm!
astrophotography,3b0k0b,LegitTacos,1 point,Fri Jun 26 17:14:17 2015 UTC,"Sure! Just uploaded a single frame on the same page!   Thank you very much.  You've provided the last push I needed to try stacking for moon pics.  I wonder what the seeing is like tonight...    Roughly 600mm!   That's the focal length.  I meant the f number or the diameter of the front element.  Here's why I ask:  With regular lenses on 16Mp m4/3, IME, diffraction effects start being visible around f/8, though you need to looking at charts or tiny detail to see it.  By f/16 things turn into mush.  You seem to have pulled nice details (I'm assuming stacking took care of turbulence &c.) and I was curious what aperture enabled this."
astrophotography,3b0k0b,LegitTacos,1 point,Fri Jun 26 17:29:13 2015 UTC,Took this picture the 25 of Juny during the first quarter moon.  This is my first attempt at capturing the the moon! I recently ordered an adapter which allowed me to use my Lumix GH2 to an old cheap 600mm refractor Telescope.  This picture is the result of stacking 180 different pictures taken every 2 seconds. Applied some sharpening with Registax6.  Softwares/workflow:  PIPP: cropping  Autostakkert!2: stacking  Registax6: Sharpening   I used ISO 200 and exposed for roughly 1/320s each frame

I am sadly back in the city where light pollution will preclude any more shots for a while, but I am happy to get any advice on how to get shots with less noise, or how to go about post processing. I will be camping out in a bortle class 2-3 at some point later this summer and would like to try again.  For the next year at least, new equipment isnt really an option, but is it worth it getting a lens with a wider aperture for this or should I just hold out till I can afford a full-frame camera?"

astrophotography,3avqi8,orangelantern,1 point,Tue Jun 23 22:39:25 2015 UTC,How do you stack multiple photos?
astrophotography,3avqi8,goober12,2,Wed Jun 24 01:28:12 2015 UTC,Look up Deep Sky Stacker. Even a few images stacked significantly improves your picture.
astrophotography,3avqi8,franscum,2,Wed Jun 24 01:33:03 2015 UTC,"If you zoom in on the stars you can see that there is trailing (they appear as small lines due to the turning of the earth).    If you take shorter exposures and stack them in DSS, you can get a shot with no noticable trailing.  Stacking many exposures will also improve the signal to noise ratio.  Or if you buy a star tracker to mount on your tripod, you can take long individual exposures without trailing.  For stacking, as the poster below mentioned, download Deep Sky Stacker.  It's got a pretty easy learning curve."

astrophotography,3avxod,shinfenn,6,Tue Jun 23 22:54:14 2015 UTC,"So I know I am going to get a lot of people saying that I should be using DC power when out in the field. Here is the reasons I decided to currently use this AC method. Talk about an easy rig to make for power. I have a 800W inverter bolted down on the lid. You will also notice this inverter had a controller box I have mounted to a table. The table also has a power strip bolted down so this small portable table provided easy access to power. I went this AC mostly for 2 reasons. 1: my laptop would die too early into the night cause I couldn’t power it, forcing me to charge it off my car battery (not good). Two, my DSLR is using AC as its main power. In addition my atlas mount has AC capability, so it all works easy. I do have a separate battery I can use for DC if I need to (thinking dew control down the road, but so far this setup has done wonders for me and charging my phone to see what you guys are shooting at during the night is easy too  As for my gear here is what I use. 125amp hour batter with 800W inverter Atlas Mount Orion 8” Astrograph Canon 450d Astro Mod Baarder coma corrector and LPF SSAG and 50mm guide camera Shot during a dithering moment last Friday.

astrophotography,3avxod,orangelantern,4,Tue Jun 23 22:54:17 2015 UTC,"Cool, How long would you say this battery setup lasts you?"
astrophotography,3avxod,orangelantern,1 point,Wed Jun 24 00:31:38 2015 UTC,"I have gone several days with no charging but I normally charge it whenever it is not in use to help the overall life of the battery. Normally at the end of the night there has been nearly no change in the battery voltage. (I test it and make notes, being a Scientist it is who I am) Has worked well enough that I built several power carts for mobile use at work."

I've always wanted to capture a Milky Way panorama, so took the chance the first clear night I had.  This was taken from the city, so lots of light pollution, but I was facing towards the dark ocean which helps a lot. See that bright white light on the bottom left? The BIGGEST flood light I have ever seen, about 2km away across the bay.  Not sure what that was about as I've been to this location before and it wasn't on...oh well, I just rolled with it.  And check out that green air glow! It must have been very active that night, I've never even seen it show up in my images before.

Otherwise didn't bother with darks/bias/flats   Processing details:   Lens profile correction in Lightroom for each pane (excluding distortion correction, see next point) Stitched the frames using Microsoft ICE. Took a LONG time to bend it to my will, was getting really weird results and it likes to think it's smarter than me by putting frames where they don't belong. I assumed that correcting for lens distortion in Lightroom first would make stitching easier, but only after I tried stitching the raw distorted photos did it finally work as expected.  Who knew.  It still missed a small piece that I know I captured, so had to do a tiny bit of clone stamping. Loaded up in Lightroom and murdered it with ALL the sliders. No regard for anything.  Just.. mayhem. A few more touchups in Photoshop with curves/levels Totally didn't include any nasty landscape in the image at all."

Unfortunately I forget what the exact settings were that ended up working... wish I made a note of that, but guessing it's different for each pano anyway.  From what i remember, the search radius was around 25%, and the vertical/horizonal overlap were quite high, like 50-60%.

astrophotography,3atz1h,Jeremyjud,1 point,Tue Jun 23 18:38:30 2015 UTC,Super newbie to this stuff question here. Does it look pretty close to this through your telescope or does it only look this amazing because its put through a program to adjust it? How powerful of a telescope do you have to have to see something like that?
astrophotography,3atz1h,Jeremyjud,8,Tue Jun 23 15:33:04 2015 UTC,"The ""closeness"" depends on what eyepiece you use. The eyepiece determines the zoom and the telescope determines how sharp and how bright the object will be. The larger the telescope, the more light you gather and the brighter the object will be.   From my neighborhood, the following image is fairly close to what I see through a 23mm eyepiece using a 6 inch telescope.  http://i.imgur.com/QWeCDGo.png  If you'd like to learn more about this subject, check out some of the links in the sidebar ""What Telescope"" and try searching for ""dslr astrophotography"" on youtube.

astrophotography,3atz1h,Jeremyjud,3,Tue Jun 23 18:27:40 2015 UTC,"Hi! Welcome to the sub!  The answer to seeing objects like this with your naked eye depends completely on what the object is, some you can see pretty clearly, others you can't see at all until you image them with long exposures. The Ring Nebula specifically is one of the easier planetary nebula to find and can be visible with a small telescope. The bigger the telescope, the better the view. Something like an 8"" Dob would give you a great view of this object. Keep in mind, it still wouldn't be as great as the picture, but if the skies are dark enough, you should be to make out the outer ring!  Hopefully this helps you out and feel free to ask anymore questions!"
astrophotography,3atz1h,Idontlikecock,1 point,Tue Jun 23 15:49:54 2015 UTC,"Thanks. I've been lurking for a few months now but I finally just bought a 8'' dob (Orion xt8 plus) about a week ago and I've been able to see Saturn, Jupeter, Venus, the moon, sun,etc. but nothing like a Nebula or anything like that. I wasn't sure how good of a telescope was needed to see something like this. Would Andromeda be potentially visible to a 8"" dob?"
astrophotography,3atz1h,AlexC77,3,Tue Jun 23 18:27:16 2015 UTC,"Andromeda should definitely be visible, it is one of the largest and brightest objects in the sky. My suggestion to you would be to go to Cleardarksky.com and look at their light pollution map. If you want a nice view, go to any place that is a 4 and below on the Bortle scale. Planets and the moon are really easy to see even in white zones (the worst light pollution) because they are so bright, however, nebula you need dark skies to see them. 4 is pretty minimum as far as seeing goes, you can see the Milky Way pretty great and a few brighter and larger nebula, but to see any of the more faint ones, I'd recommend a 3 or below. As well as light pollution, you need to account for seeing conditions like transparency and what not, but that's all explained on the website.  Have fun!"

OIII I had to do a background extraction (I used the auomatic one), then the same histo stretch into curves.  How I merge the channels  Bi-color images are tricky, because you need to make a synthetic green. In addition to that, to make a pleasing bi-color the red and blue need to be blended slightly.  The following are the pixelmath values to generate the final image. No Luminance is used, just a straight pixelmath calculation.  Red: iif(ha > .15, ha, (ha*.8)+(oiii*.2)) Green: iif(ha > 0.5, 1-(1-oiii)*(1-(ha-0.5)), oiii *(ha+0.5)) Blue: iif(oiii > .1, oiii, (ha*.3)+(oiii*.2))   The story of doing this image and my motivation  The crescent nebula is in an ideal area of the sky for summer seeing conditions. That's why I wanted to image it, aside from seeing some neat looking images of it in the past. Unfortunately its position is awkward and requires a meridian flip, which is kind of a bummer.  The seeing conditions were generally fairly good towards the top of the sky. I was getting around 2"" seeing at zenith, and the images average around 2.5"" (hence the 2"" resample).  I spent a night doing SII, but decided the image was better as a bi-color. There is extremely faint SII in the crescent nebula, but it's not worth representing in my opinion. Here is an image of the SII, and I just don't feel like bringing that into this image really benefits the result. When you stretch extremely faint data and merge it with less faint data, it distorts the stars wildly. For that reason I don't think it's worth processing or aquiring (even if I did waste a night)  Aside from that the only real goal I had going into this target was to get the rotation correctly in its presentation, which I did accomplish. This is my first bi-color image, and I think it came out interesting at the very least."

Starting to wonder if I should also through out my SII as there's not much there, and focus more on the OIII and Ha.  I'm starting to get that blue ring around the bubble with that part that extends beyond the Ha portion which is nice.  Problem now is just needing time.  How did you arrive at that Pixel Math calculation?  looks very complex but wondering if you got it off the PixInsight forum?    So far I've been using the Juan's ""natural"" pixel math calculation or I've been trying the HSO formula with good results.  Excellent image, I really like it."
astrophotography,3arde4,Idontlikecock,1 point,Wed Jun 24 17:44:14 2015 UTC,"How did you arrive at that Pixel Math calculation?   I've just screwed around with pixelmath a lot now and I have a good idea of how it works. I didn't get it from anywhere, it's just from understanding the weakness of my data and trying to improve upon the result using PM.  You'll see if you do enough imaging on this, that the OIII SNR will be noticeably lower than the HA SNR. So if you read the Blue for instance:  iif(oiii > .1, oiii, (ha * .3)+(oiii * .2))  What it's saying is ""If the value of OIII is greater than 10%, use OIII). So really all the formula is addressing is ""how do I handle the situation where the signal of OIII is very low"". And I address that by combining a little HA with a little OIII."

I would have thought it's a bit short to guide an 8"" OTA accurately.   As for processing I'd recommend going back and practicing the colour calibration as the stars seem a little toward the blue side. Other than that I like the amount of detail you've captured, especially the fainter dust outside of the main nebula.  Deconvolution might help with the central parts if you're interested in learning a new and exciting processing step.

astrophotography,3alg8b,AdiGoN,1 point,Sun Jun 21 10:47:28 2015 UTC,Most likely vignetting correction gone wrong.
astrophotography,3alg8b,IKLYSP,1 point,Sun Jun 21 10:56:20 2015 UTC,I'm assuming you're not using a tracking mount - It's probably due to distortions inherent to the lens. Stacking untracked images makes the distortion more pronounced due to the way it moves across frames. You could try stopping the lens down to F/4 or something to reduce the edge softness.
astrophotography,3alg8b,IKLYSP,1 point,Sun Jun 21 11:28:26 2015 UTC,"I've never had this problem stacking 10 or so, do you think it could be the extra 30?"
astrophotography,3alg8b,total_zoidberg,1 point,Sun Jun 21 11:32:05 2015 UTC,"Maybe. Some lenses have a kind of ""fish-eye"" effect where the corners are stretched which makes stacking the images difficult if there's a lot of movement. It could be that the extra drift with the 30 frames makes it more of a problem than with 10 frames."
astrophotography,3alg8b,IKLYSP,1 point,Sun Jun 21 11:50:12 2015 UTC,"I've recently had a similar problem stacking 250x1"" shots, in between which I had to change the orientation to recenter the target (untracked). In some (about 100) the target was ""close"" to the edges of the frame. I don't think it's the exposure times, but the edges and lens distortion."

astrophotography,3alg8b,PygmyPony,1 point,Sun Jun 21 16:58:19 2015 UTC,"No, I don't think that's coma.  Coma goes radially outwards evenly in all directions.  Since this is just one corner, I'd think it's non sensor/light path orthogonality."

This particular 35mm lens is f/1.8, so it's able to capture quite a bit of light with the large aperture. I still want to get some wider angle lenses to get more in the shot though.  The color is likely wrong from the post-processing. When I did the shots, I think WB was set to Cloudy, but I wasn't really concerned with it because I was shooting in RAW and knew it would all change in post process. I adjusted color temp, tint, contrast, blacks, shadows, etc....definitely have a lot to learn still though. Had to make quite a bit of adjustment from how the original looked.

A 200mm lens isn't going to be able to absorb enough light.  When it comes to un-tracked shots, zoom is not your friend.  I used a 6 sec exposure too, but more shots (500) and a smaller lens (50mm 1.8f) and got this: http://imgur.com/jblfePb"

astrophotography,3afsvp,yawg6669,2,Fri Jun 19 20:04:56 2015 UTC,"Just more subs.  I have a tutorial on deconvolution in the wiki, did you check that out? That may help a bit.  Deconvolution is a tricky process, I've never gotten good results with a DSLR,  but I'm sure others have."
astrophotography,3afsvp,yawg6669,1 point,Fri Jun 19 20:12:41 2015 UTC,"I definitely should look into the wiki more. As for more subs, would you recommend stepping down the ISO?

astrophotography,3afsvp,rpfile,2,Fri Jun 19 20:16:30 2015 UTC,"I think I'd need to see more subs, both raw and stacked, before I could make a ""use ISO X"" claim.  Usually 800-1600 is fine, but 2000 isn't too high.  If you plan on adding to this image, keep the ISO the same, although technically you could still use new subs with different ISO if you wanted.  Depending on how much post you want to do, you could try to up the ISO (like 3200?) and expose longer to try to get that faint outer area, but it would be tricky (but doable) in post to blend them.  I like the star colors."
astrophotography,3afsvp,Idontlikecock,2,Fri Jun 19 20:20:34 2015 UTC,"i think this looks pretty good for 2h of total exposure time! i'd keep the ISO the same for this project to avoid having to use darks and bias of a different ISO. if you are using the BPP script in PI it won't be able to distinguish between the different darks, so you'd have to do all the calibration by hand if you want to switch ISOs mid-project."
astrophotography,3afsvp,rnclark,1 point,Fri Jun 19 23:11:34 2015 UTC,"Hmm, the only thing I could think of to help with noise would be to lower ISO, more images, or change the Bias/Dark/Flats, did you take these at different temperature, humidity, etc.? What steps did you take in processing? Did you use the TGV tool?   Edit: just a heads up, I don't know tons about this, but I may know a little bit to help."
astrophotography,3afsvp,Idontlikecock,1 point,Fri Jun 19 20:21:38 2015 UTC,"Lowering ISO does not reduce noise.  What does a Sony dark frame and bias frame look like?  Can you post a raw file of each?  If there is not much difference, e.g. both show the same level, the Sony sensor has on sensor dark current suppression and one way to reduce noise is to not use bias and dark frames.  The Sony sensor, being very new should be excellent in this regard.  The lossy raw compressor in the Sony could be adding noise, and there is no way around that."
astrophotography,3afsvp,rnclark,2,Fri Jun 19 22:27:47 2015 UTC,"This is the second time you've said this, and since I had never heard that the noise you get when shooting at something like 6400 ISO isn't from the ISO setting, I did some quick research. Basically people seem split. This article seemed to describe it the best http://www.digital-slr-guide.com/iso-and-image-noise.html however I also found an example of shooting at lower ISO produced more noise, however this noise came from brightening the image during editing in order to get a useable image from 100 ISO to match the brightness of one shot at a higher ISO.   As for now though, I won't agree that higher ISOs will not give you more noise, but I will admit you can get more noise at lower ISO.  Basically there seems to be a middle ground that is the perfect ISO for each shot, and lowering the ISO past the ideal and brightening later will give you noise, and then the same for shooting at higher."
astrophotography,3afsvp,10ACJed,1 point,Fri Jun 19 23:16:21 2015 UTC,"See ISO  Where you'll see more noise at lower ISO is only at the noise floor.  For example, see table 1 here and look at the column called apparent read noise.  In astrophotography, once you get to a level less than 3 electrons read noise, noise from other sources, like the sky, dominates at most exposures, so there is effectively little to gain above iso 1600 and a loss of dynamic range."
astrophotography,3afsvp,rnclark,1 point,Sat Jun 20 00:29:27 2015 UTC,"This is a reply to a post that is somewhat old, but I really enjoyed reading your article on ISO. I didn't necessarily understand 100% of it, but have intuited a similar conclusion based on my used of various iso settings where shutter speeds had to stay above 1/200.    I wonder if you have a link to any information that discusses the ISOless zone on other camera models besides the Canons you use?"
astrophotography,3afsvp,10ACJed,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:03:03 2015 UTC,"Thanks.  For modern cameras (made in the last few years) Canons are ""isoless"" above iso 1600 and possibly even 800.  Nikon/Sony's are above 400 to 800, and still pretty good down to 100.   14-bit sampling limits discrimination of faint tonal details below about iso 400, so for astro work, I would stay above about 400 on Nikon/Sony and above about 800 on Canon."
astrophotography,3afsvp,rnclark,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:36:42 2015 UTC,Thanks- I'm shooting on an Olympus OMd-E5 ; not sure if you have any specs on a micro 4/3 and Olympus sensor.   I'm really enjoying your website- btw. Your photography has a unique style- particular the care you take in accurate colors for astrophotography. I could tell just by looking at thumbnails in your galleries that you'd put a lot of work into developing your style.
astrophotography,3afsvp,Idontlikecock,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:36:44 2015 UTC,"Thanks. Sorry, I do not have any data on the Olympus OMd-E5 sensor.  It should be pretty good, and if you attach it to a telescope, should do similarly as an APS-C or full frame camera, just the field of view will be smaller.  Otherwise it should be just as sensitive.  (The internet common idea that larger sensors are more sensitive is due to the larger lenses that tend to be used on them, not that the sensors are better.)   So just use large aperture lenses for astrophotography to collect light and that is most of the battle (coupled with dark skies away from cities).  As long as your camera does not have a lot of pattern noise (banding) in the low intensity end, it should do a great job."

I am able to identify constellations and  tell which stars are which with my naked eye just fine. The problem comes when I am actually looking through my scope to try to center the star. I can not seem to tell the difference between the star I'm supposed to be looking at, or the many others in my view, so I have no idea if I am honing in the right one. I am wondering how you guys are able to tell them apart? Am I doing something wrong, or is this a matter of familiarity and practice?"
astrophotography,3ag9w7,mrstaypuft,5,Sat Jun 20 17:17:28 2015 UTC,"I feel your pain.  It took me months to get used to alignment.  I'll try to offer some tips based on my experience.  Hopefully something here will help you out.   Getting your rough polar alignment close (when you set up the mount) and ensuring the location information is correct in the scope (lat/long, time, etc) is very important in having the alignment close to start.  It is always easier if that first alignment star is in your field of view rather than outside of it. If you are equipped with a wider-field guide scope, make sure it is roughly aligned with your OTA.  (For example, use a giant object like the moon or a distant light to line them up.)  Once this is the case, you can stick an eyepiece in the guidescope to get the star close, then center it properly through the imager/eyepiece on the OTA.  For example, I used my 400mm guidescope to get me close before zeroing in on my 800mm OTA with the camera attached. The stars used for alignment (especially the ones the mount will suggest using) are always the brightest one in the immediate vicinity.  I can't remember a time where the alignment star was not the brightest in my FOV.  I never really tried to identify constellations/etc through the live-view or eyepiece... Just went after the brightest star.  (Maybe this is a terrible approach, but it worked great for me.) Aligning via the live-view on a camera is just hard.  I think it takes some getting used to... If this is what you're trying, maybe try aligning with an eyepiece first to get it close, then stick the camera on there and update the star positions.   Good luck!  [edit: THEIR THERE]"
astrophotography,3ag9w7,bwientjes,2,Sat Jun 20 18:00:26 2015 UTC,"To add to the first point: if you're outside the US, check if you need to use the daylight saving option. I have been pulling my hair out last March because no matter what I did, I was always an hour off alignment. Turned out that although we here in The Netherlands were not in daylight saving yet, the US was, and the American software in my mount aparrently did not understand that I was not in daylight saving.  Probably will be fixed in a firmware update, will have to either look into that or remember to check for daylight saving this fall.  Regarding the third point: I have a shortlist of stars that I am able to identify in the blink of an eye, and my mount lets me choose which star(s) to use for alignment. If I don't know where a certain proposed star is, I'll just choose one I know."
astrophotography,3ag9w7,yawg6669,1 point,Tue Jun 23 13:04:42 2015 UTC,"yea, like puft said, a good finder helps, and knowing the star names helps too.  Also, if you have screws on your tube, you can ""sight down the tube"".  It is much trickier to do, but it can get you pretty close if you're finderless, or if your finder is not aligned.  I used to do that quite frequently, and still do, occasionally."

astrophotography,3ag9w7,IKLYSP,4,Sun Jun 21 07:34:48 2015 UTC,"It was my first scope too. It's not great, the tripod is too shakey for even visual and the finderscope is complete garbage. If you're looking for a beginner scope it would be better to find a dobsonian and put off doing deep sky astrophotography for a few years until you have a larger budget. Dobsonians are just fine for taking pictures of the planets through though so you will be limited to that.  I got into astrophotography after doing visual for a few years, it helped to know about optics and collimation etc but there's not too much overlap between visual and imaging deep sky."
astrophotography,3ag9w7,anmolkohli,2,Tue Jun 23 00:14:39 2015 UTC,"The problem with that is I can't find many Dobs over here, and the ones that I have found(Orion SkyQuest X8) are around 60,000 INR, which is way too much. The AM 130EQ is around 16,000, which I can afford. I should visit a physical shop soon, as these prices are from Amazon."
astrophotography,3ag9w7,Fran_97,2,Tue Jun 23 07:51:33 2015 UTC,"I think it's an excellent piece of equipment to start. Though if you're looking to doing astrpotography in the future you should check wether you can motorize the mount or not, but my guess is you can."

Having visual experience doesn't really help you with AP at all, other than you'll know general areas of the sky whee things are, but that knowledge really isn't needed anyway.  I'd stay away from that scope, look for an 80ED if you want to do AP.  That scope is totally worthless for AP imo."

Equipment / Optical Train (in order):  Celestron C8 SCT  Celestron f 6.3 Focal Reducer/ Corrector  1.25"" Visual Back  Celestron Universal 1.25"" t-adapter  Cannon t-ring  Cannon Rebel Xti    Here is a sub without the reducer, not as much vignetting  Here is a random sub with the Reducer, notice extreme vignetting    My understanding  From what I can understand this could be caused by the f/6.3 reducer corrector and/or the use of the 1.25"" t-adapter. A little bit of googling told me that the inside a standard 1.25"" adapter is 25mm (this may be completely wrong) while the diagonal (which I am led to believe is what you are supposed to measure by) on the my camera, the rebel Xti, is about 26.68mm (22.2 x 14.8mm). So far what I get is that this 1.68mm difference is enough to cause some vignetting like in the first photo, but what I don't understand is how it is so extreme in the 2nd photo? Is that just the nature of the reducer, or is the vignetting enhanced by the view from the reducer going through the 1.25"" T adapter? I almost wish someone could draw a picture that the light is travelling so I can understand"
astrophotography,3ag9w7,IKLYSP,3,Wed Jun 24 00:20:44 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure it's inherent to the reducer. I've used one as well with my C11 with similarly bad vignetting. I'd guess it's due to the baffle tube on the primary mirror, it has quite a narrow aperture at the front so some light may be lost when the image is compressed down to f/6.3.  Basically what the reducer does is compress down the size of the image from the scope. So for example reducing by an f/stop makes a 4x4 image become a 2x2 image. The 4x4 image is large enough that the vignetted areas caused by the OTA design fall outside of the camera sensor but when you compress it down to a 2x2 the vignette is visible.  I tried to draw you a picture to explain. http://i.imgur.com/RRfqRS3.png  Take good flats and you can avoid almost all of it."

astrophotography,3ag9w7,rpfile,1 point,Sat Jun 20 20:56:54 2015 UTC,"the bulk of the cost of the setup for me is the mount and camera. the OTA is actually a $250 AT6RC with a reducer.  a lot of software work went into that image - i had to extract the background from each sub individually in order to fix the light pollution gradients. this can drive someone insane, but on the other hand i think it forces you to develop your processing skills.  i think the key thing is the mono CCD camera. while it's very easy to get started with a DSLR, working with an uncooled one-shot color camera can be really frustrating when it comes to managing noise. the best i could do on this target with a DSLR is here, and you can see the difference right away:  http://www.astrobin.com/23323/"

Messier/NGC objects will be labeled, and you can also stick the solved frame's RA/Dec coordinates in Stellarium and see how close you were to your target.  As far as the PI learning curve: Yes ;-)  Definitely takes time and patience, but it all pays off if you stick to it.

I've been using a DSLR and tripod, then stacking images with Deep Sky Stacker. Widefield is about all that can be done with only a DSLR (I think?). That said it's not ""just"" wide-angle pictures of the milky way. I've been using a 50mm and pointing my camera at bright clusters like the Southern Pelaides (IC2602) and M7. They're fascinating! Plus, because they're bright enough to be visible to the naked eye, they're easy to find and don't need really long exposures (though I'm sure they'd be even more awesome with a tracking mount and a longer focal length...) One of these days I'll have an image good enough to post to the main page. This is Monday night's effort. I've got a lot of learning to do, but I'm enjoying the process!"

I'm using a Celestron NexStar 6SE with a T-adapter and a 2x barlow.  I have a Sony A7, and will probably get a Sony A6000 in the near future. I hear the pixels in the A7 are too big for good planetary images, and even after putting Saturn through registax the results were not that great (though the seeing was mediocre at best as well).  Will the A6000 be significantly better in that regard, or should I look into a webcam (like the Philips SPC900) instead? Would prefer not to spend too much if not using one of my regular cameras.   TL/DR: Between a Sony A7, Sony A6000 (with T-adapter and 2x barlow), or a dedicated webcam, which is best for planetary imaging? If webcam, what are the best (and reasonably priced) options?"

Both are 60fps. Obviously these are cameras I'd be using for regular photography as well. If neither is adequate, I'd like to get away with a consumer webcam (modified if necessary) or CCD that's ideally <$100 (some wiggle room if there are compelling reasons to spend more) as I'm just starting out with planetary, and it seems like people are getting pretty good results with those.

astrophotography,3ae2qd,properthyme,2,Fri Jun 19 10:55:55 2015 UTC,you are not quite polar aligned?
astrophotography,3ae2qd,blewyourfaceup,2,Fri Jun 19 12:28:39 2015 UTC,Are you doing the ASPA after doing the alignment. The alignment only tells the mount where the stars are currently so the go-to accuracy is correct. I think /u/blewyourfaceup is correct in that your polar alignment might be off.
astrophotography,3ae2qd,Gamedude05,2,Fri Jun 19 13:11:22 2015 UTC,"Someone correct me if I'm wrong but order of operation should be (and works for me) is: visual polar align, 2 star align on startup, all star polar align, calibration stars. Test. I image with a DSLR so I also do a rough drift align as well."
astrophotography,3ae2qd,blewyourfaceup,2,Fri Jun 19 15:48:34 2015 UTC,"Mostly correct. The 2 star align and the calibration stars are only for go-to accuracy. The mount creates a rendering of the sky based on this information, that is what it uses to do the ASPA. If the go-to calibration is off the ASPA will also be off. So that is why it is recommended to get in the general area using the polar scope opening on the AVX, then 2+4, ASPA. If your go-to accuracy after ASPA is off then you will need to redo the 2 star align plus calibration stars. Some will even say to return the mount to home and power it off after ASPA then do another 2+2 go-to alignment. You wouldn't have to redo the polar alignment as long as you don't physically move the mount. However, I have never had to turn the mount off as after ASPA the go-to has never been out of my sensor.   Depending on how long your exposures are, drift aligning is not worth it. I believe /u/yawg6669 told me that ASPA should be good enough for 10min images with guiding."
astrophotography,3ae2qd,Gamedude05,1 point,Fri Jun 19 16:13:36 2015 UTC,"Right.  Drift align is really about how picky you want to be, although to be honest, if you're good with a well calibrated polar scope, you can skip drift align.  I can get 1hr exposures at 1600mm focal length using polar scope align only, so it is do-able if you're careful.  If you're only shooting for 5-10 min shots at under 1k mm focal length it should be fine."
astrophotography,3ae2qd,yawg6669,1 point,Fri Jun 19 16:53:02 2015 UTC,I don't have a guider :(
astrophotography,3ae2qd,blewyourfaceup,1 point,Fri Jun 19 17:24:43 2015 UTC,Well it depends on your focal length of the setup. Longer lengths will make the problems more apparent but you should be able to get decently long enough exposures without guiding and just using ASPA.
astrophotography,3ae2qd,Gamedude05,1 point,Fri Jun 19 17:41:47 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the response. This could actually be the issue. I set the latitude on the mount with the built-in scale and use the exact N-S orientation of roof of the building I'm using, but it must still be slightly off. Would the mount's computer compensate for this by adjusting Dec. as well when tracking?"
astrophotography,3ae2qd,yawg6669,1 point,Fri Jun 19 13:28:25 2015 UTC,Exact N-S orientation?  What does that mean?  That will not get you a good enough polar align.
astrophotography,3ae2qd,Gamedude05,1 point,Fri Jun 19 14:07:02 2015 UTC,"The building is perfectly aligned geographically North to South, so if I line the telescope (in index position) exactly parallel with the building and set the latitude at the correct number, in theory this should make the equatorial mount polar aligned, right?"
astrophotography,3ae2qd,Gamedude05,2,Fri Jun 19 14:34:45 2015 UTC,"It would get you close. However, as /u/yawg6669 stated, not enough. That physical alignment would be alright for visual observing but I would suggest doing that physical alignment. Then do a 2+4 go-to alignment. Then do the ASPA that is included with the AVX. It works very well(as long as you actually align on the star it's asking for...) at getting you polar aligned."
astrophotography,3ae2qd,yawg6669,1 point,Fri Jun 19 14:48:45 2015 UTC,"Great, thanks for the procedure. Just to clarify, the 2+4 is the two star alignment plus 4 calibration stars, yes?"
astrophotography,3ae2qd,orangelantern,2,Fri Jun 19 15:52:18 2015 UTC,Correct. Always do 2+4 before the ASPA. Then if your go-to accuracy is off after doing the ASPA you can do replace the go-to alignment stars and get away with a 2+2.

I am very curious as to what scope you think I should purchase, ideally, for under or around $500.   My first inclination was to buy a refracting scope because that seems to be what most people use for DSOs. It is worth noting that I plan on doing SOLELY DSO imaging, no planetary. If I ever plan on doing planetary, I will buy an 8"" DOB off of CL, but for now, I plan on sticking with DSOs. (I have experience imaging planets with my current scope, but no DSOs).  Originally, I planned on buying a Vixen ED80Sf that was on sale at Amazon with all the tube rings, finder scope, etc. for $450. I wish I would have bought it when I saw it, but oh well. Now, my search has been expanded though. I am currently considering the Orion ED80, the Vixen ED80Sf, and the Sky-Watcher ProED 80.

After more research though, I stumbled upon the AT65EDQ which seems like a great option in the same price range along with the WO ZenithStar 71mm with the field flattener. The last two seem like good options, the AT being more budget conscious of the two. The reason I thought these might help me more than the standard 80mm refractor is because the quick f number I thought would be best for nebulae and galaxies, and the other 80mm all have an f of 7.5, leading me to think they are for both planetary and nebulae viewing.   Other than that, I frequent reddit.com/r/astrophotography a good deal, and thought after looking at their telescope buying guide that I would find which refractor I listed would be best for me, but I didn't. Instead, I found the AT6in, a 6"" reflector. At only $300, it seems like quite a bargain, and whoever wrote the guide seems to really like it.   This led me to do research on the differences, and I basically concluded refractors have a little trouble with CA, which is fixed normally by getting a triplet, but I can't really afford those. The AT65EDQ was a quad lens design which I found funny considering its price. but it is basically a doublet with double the lenses to my understand + an included field flattener (one less thing I'd have to buy if I took this route). But the problems with reflectors is that they are generally not user friendly since they are difficult to focus and cause diffraction spikes from the spider arms holding the mirrors.   If you would be so kind as to make your own recommendation as to reflector or refractor in my case, that would be great. Even better would be if you could choose a single one that would be best suited for strictly DSO viewing."""
astrophotography,3aek3s,yawg6669,1 point,Fri Jun 19 17:36:00 2015 UTC,"strictly DSO viewing.   I think you mean imaging?  Well, it's like this, 80ED's are ok for imaging, triplet's even better, quads better still (think takahashi FSQ line).  The AT65edq is a triplet apo WITH a built in flattener.  To me, that's a big deal.  If i were you, I'd try to up the budget a touch and get this:  http://www.optcorp.com/william-optics-71mm-zenithstar-refractor-telescope-with-flattener-z71ap.html  If not that, then the AT65EDQ used or new is a great idea.  Fracs are nice and simple, no diffraction spikes (which is just personal preference), and no collimation.  Sometimes they are a little more temperature dependent, but unles you're going CF, what isn't?  If your budget is a HARD 500, just keep an eye on the used market, or put out a want ad.  You have an amart account?  Totally worth it imo.  If you need a price on an amart item lemme know, I'll check it for you."
astrophotography,3aek3s,Idontlikecock,1 point,Fri Jun 19 18:07:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that WO 71mm + FF was on that list. Even though it is a doublet, you recommend it over the Triplet AT65EDQ, why?  And yes, I mean imaging, sorry about that."

Won't be posting here since there will be landscape though ;)  It will be untracked 15 second exposures at f/1.8.  I'm just wondering if there's much benefit in waiting for true astronomical dark to start shooting? I'm in an orange light pollution zone and only have from 12:53am until 1:37am for this if I wait for astro dark... Tempted to start like 30 minutes before just so I have more time, but not sure if it'll make a big different in my photos (especially considering this is already in an orange zone).

astrophotography,3adjtq,diablo1086,7,Fri Jun 19 06:17:46 2015 UTC,"First step, go here: http://cleardarksky.com/csk/prov/Arizona_charts.html  Find your location, and try to get in at least a yellow area, you'll get much better results in green and blue areas though.   Second step, point your camera at the a bright star and try to focus it manually while looking through live view, or the viewfinder. If you can not see the star in either, try taking a picture, zoom in on the picture at the stars and check the focus, adjust as needed.  Since you have no way to track, your best bet would be shooting 15-20 second exposures (20 may be pushing it) at almost as zoomed out as your lens goes (I remember someone mentioning that fully open is bad because it could soften your image or other adverse effects, I won't pretend I know a lot about photography).   You'll want to be shooting in RAW mode at an ISO not over 1600 for your camera. Yes the image may look better on your small LCD screen at a higher ISO, but you will get too much noise once you get it on an actual screen.   Shoot as many shots as you can at these settings, the more the better. I have an interval shooting mode on my camera where I can basically tell it to take X shots every Y seconds, yours may have something similar. If not, a remote would fix that, or just manually press it.   You can either take you bias, flats, and dark images now, or since you're a beginner, skip this for now.  Once you get home, go to bed, it'll probably be late! But the next day though, you can edit your images! Try downloading the free trial of PixInsight and follow the guide on how to edit DSLR images in the side bar.  To help give you a good idea of what to expect, this was my very first attempt at the Milky Way, and there was a full moon out in a yellow zone, far from ideal. Having no moon makes an enormous difference in your pictures. But as a reference on what your pictures may look like before processing, processing allowed me to turn this RAW image into this image of the Milky Way. Not great, but I was happy with my first attempt. I only had 5 images to stack as well, I recommend taking more, as in 20+ would be great as it will give you more detail and even less noise.  Hope this write up helped you, good luck!"

Use the 500 rule. Do 500/(focal length you're shooting at) and that will tell you about long long of an exposure you can do without star trails. I shoot widefield at 18mm and I can do 25 second exposures no problem."
astrophotography,3adjtq,michael1026,3,Fri Jun 19 07:14:01 2015 UTC,"True, that is definitely an option, I just always preferred to use the calculator found here: http://www.lonelyspeck.com/how-to-make-an-amazing-photo-of-the-milky-way-galaxy/  The 500 rule is close, but I think it is based off the use of a full sensor, not the more common APS-C sensor found in your popular DSLRs."
astrophotography,3adjtq,Idontlikecock,0,Fri Jun 19 07:37:50 2015 UTC,"The 500 rule is for low quality lenses and for short star trails.  If you have a sharp lens, and want round stars, a 200 rule is better.  Note the lonelyspec page shows blue halos around the Milky Way and a blueing of the Milky Way with elevation in the image.  That is a sign of using white balance (which is a multiply) to remove light pollution and airglow which are added light so should be subtracted.  The blueing is an artifact if poor post processing and not natural colors of the Milky Way."

I read before that the absolute lowest is not the best option, but slightly above it is due to having it completely open softens the image. I recently just got myself a new camera and lenses (two days ago actually!) and I reshot the Milky Way. The lens I used was capable of 1.8, so I used 1.8, but it sort of looked out of focus / soft. I am not sure if this is because I missed focus, or because I should have been at 2.0 or so. If I were you, I would experiment and see which will give you better results.   A good f/number for shooting is generally 2 or lower, but my first attempt used a lens  with an f number of 4.5. It wasn't ideal, but it definitely worked. When do you plan on trying it out? Can't wait to see how you do!"

I agree with this advice, but changing ISO does not change the noise (except in some cameras, lower ISOs can show pattern noise (banding).  Only exposure time and aperture change the amount of light collected and thus the main noise we see in the images.  ISO 1600 is great for reasonable dynamic range so fewer stars are clipped than when using higher ISOs."

After that, move it back to the other side while still shooting video and continue to do this until you get as many frames as you wanted (you can't do this forever mind you, eventually the planets rotation comes into account, but a couple minutes or so would be a great starting point). The software used will automatically drop all the frames where there is no planet visible or the frame is poor, so don't worry about it not being in the video for a second.   Good luck :)"

astrophotography,3a9ztw,ImNotGabriel,1 point,Mon Jun 22 03:39:54 2015 UTC,"Sorry, but not a chance without a mount, and a mount to be able to hold an 8"" Dob would be really really expensive.   DSOs you need a mount that can hold your telescope perfectly steady while taking a picture, the smallest bump will ruin your picture, this can even come from a small gust of wind, especially when your scope is bigger and heavier. In order to hold your scope (which I am guessing is ~30lbs), you need a mount with a max payload of 60lbs (you take half the max value to get what you could use to photograph). This means you would most likely be in the market for something like this.  This also is ignoring that your scope's focal length would make tracking and focusing DSOs fairly difficult. All in all, you would be much better off buying a mount + different scope if you would like to do DSOs. Dobs are amazing for visual, and great for planetary and lunar photograph, they just are not great at DSO imaging."

astrophotography,3ab1zz,goober12,1 point,Thu Jun 18 21:01:37 2015 UTC,"There is a concept of an ideal level of sampling, i.e. an ideal focal length for your setup for imaging the moon and the planets, such that both the camera and the telescope are delivering maximum performance according to their capabilities.  Your camera's pixels are 3.75 microns wide and your scope is 8"". Following general rules of thumb (which I got from Thierry Legault's intro book), calculated based on your scope and camera specs, your ""ideal"" focal length for imaging with the ASI 120mc would be something around 2600mm.  Your scope's native focal length is 2032mm.  This means that a 2x barlow, which brings you to 4064mm, might very well be overkill.  It might be worth a try, especially on a night with fantastic atmospheric seeing, but theory says that you will be oversampling, which won't give you optimal results.    Or, you could keep working with your current focal length and try to improve other factors, like scope cooldown, collimation, focus, etc, and of course waiting for nights of good seeing.  Those things should all give you a better image, and one that you can drizzle to a somewhat larger size in AS!2."

Next time, try taking some shorter exposures and then zooming in the stars to ensure they are crisp.  Great first attempt though, best of luck in your future attempts, can't wait to see them!"
astrophotography,3ab1iy,Idontlikecock,1 point,Thu Jun 18 17:42:20 2015 UTC,"Thanks!  I wondered about the focus.  I tried using a homemade bahtinov mask to get the focus right, but looks like I could probably improve it a little."
astrophotography,3ab1iy,prjindigo,2,Thu Jun 18 17:54:07 2015 UTC,"If you used a mask, there are two things that could have gone wrong imo, either the mask was poorly made, or the weight of the camera and anything else you had hooked up to it could have been moving the focuser (either pulling it out or pushing it in). This may not have been visible at a quick glance, but over a long exposure time it could happen."
astrophotography,3ab1iy,prjindigo,1 point,Thu Jun 18 18:09:58 2015 UTC,"Temperature change on that f13.9 scope will alter the focus every time.  The 90mm Maks have got an excellently tight focusing rig, mine's never slipped."

astrophotography,3abe9c,Acentt,2,Thu Jun 18 18:56:52 2015 UTC,"I've had this problem with the NexStar Solar System camera several times and usually it's one of two issues:   First, if you don't have the camera plugged in before starting the program, at least in my case, it will not work. I don't know why this is like this, but that usually fixes the problem for me. Plug the camera in, wait until it's recognized and then start icap. If that doesn't work, go into icap and set the resolution to the higest one available, that will let you see the widest field. Aim the telescope at something big and bright like the moon and see if any image is coming up, if not mess around with the gain and exposure until you get something.   Is that tiny metal lens cap removed? Because it can be missed. Also, it's very difficult to aim the telescope and hit it with the camera on the first shot. The best technique for me is to start at the highest resolution and bring it down a notch, re-center the planet, bring it down some more, recenter, etc. That will get you the best picture you can."

I just took the camera out and used an eyepiece until I had Saturn in view, then put the camera back on."
astrophotography,3abe9c,Steveman180,1 point,Thu Jun 18 19:17:21 2015 UTC,"I aim my scope at Saturn with the eyepiece in, then focus and center it. When I replace the eyepiece with the camera, I just get black."
astrophotography,3abe9c,goober12,2,Thu Jun 18 19:20:09 2015 UTC,"The focus will be different for the camera and for the eyepiece.  If it's very different, you might not even see much of anything in the extremely out-of-focus image in the camera, even if you are actually centered on Saturn.    If the moon is out, focus on the moon, then go back to Saturn with the camera still attached.    You might also want to make sure the camera is working with the capture software in the first place.  Just turn it on without the camera attached to the telescope in a lit room, and make sure it's sending a signal to your computer and displaying the unfocused light it gathers from the room.  If that is working fine, then my guess is that it's a focus issue."
astrophotography,3abe9c,goober12,2,Thu Jun 18 19:46:05 2015 UTC,"Okay I'll try to focus with the moon first. And yeah it definitely picks up light because when I shine a flashlight into it, the capture screen goes white."

astrophotography,3abhi2,yawg6669,3,Thu Jun 18 20:13:15 2015 UTC,Smaller scope on top of your imaging scope with a guide camera attracted to it and hooked up to your mount. The camera watches the stars through the guide scope to allow for more accurate tracking.

astrophotography,3abhi2,yawg6669,2,Thu Jun 18 20:44:10 2015 UTC,"It depends on what you want. A webcam or some similar planetary imager would be great for planets and the moon. A DSLR however is what you'd look for if you wanted to do DSOs. You can image planets and the moon with a DSLR as well, it just needs to have video capabilities, but generally, a dedicated planetary imager would give you a better shot. Not saying a DSLR would by any means give you a bad planetary shot, just not the best it could be. Similar to how a DSLR is great for DSOs, but even better, are CCDs. But they're stupid expensive and worth every penny but they are definitely a more niche object than a DSLR. You can at least use a DSLR normally and around town to take normal pictures with if that's something that interest you."

Last time I took about 40 lights (half were unusable due to the fucking planes) 18 darks and 18 biases. I wanted to do flats when I got home, but I totally forgot about the flats... took some photos on the way home and of course changed the focus, so flats were out of the question.

I use it with my mount. Mount quality aside, there's no reason you can't do unguided even with an Atlas. It basically just uses the T-point calculations to figure out the drift of your gear (as well as atmospheric refraction) to make adjustments over time to your mount."
astrophotography,3a8130,dreamsplease,1 point,Thu Jun 18 00:25:45 2015 UTC,"over time, not, in real time.  it's not going to update once a second is it?  That's exactly what guiding does."
astrophotography,3a8130,dreamsplease,2,Thu Jun 18 00:27:42 2015 UTC,"Think of it like ""SkyX knows your stars will drift by X per second"", so it will compensate for that automatically without any more input. Even if your polar alignment is literally perfect (to the refracted pole), it will still drift due to the distortion in the atmosphere. Skyx knows what that should be based on your input (temperature, humidity, location), and figured out the periodic fixes it needs to make."

astrophotography,3a8130,dreamsplease,2,Thu Jun 18 00:42:41 2015 UTC,"and AO   Well, do your research on that. The hype consumer adaptive optics has is misplaced. The main issue is seeing conditions will fluctuate over the very wide field of view of consumer scopes. Even if you had a proper (and faster) AO system than SBIG sells, your correction would really only be substantially improved on a small FOV around the AO's star (like 40"" x 40""). I've seen plenty of underwhelming reviews/posts online where people get consumer AO systems.   Waiting on an SBIg as the final solution.    Hail SBIG"
astrophotography,3a8130,dreamsplease,1 point,Thu Jun 18 00:46:10 2015 UTC,"over time, not, in real time. it's not going to update once a second is it?   I would assume it updates at least once a second.   That's exactly what guiding does.   Well... pro-track isn't going to fix your periodic error or flexure."
astrophotography,3a8130,dreamsplease,2,Thu Jun 18 00:31:36 2015 UTC,Actually it is modeling the flexure as it has see it following 60-70 plate solves across the sky.  I have run a PEC model and post correction it is 1.1 arc seconds.
astrophotography,3a8130,dreamsplease,2,Thu Jun 18 00:37:53 2015 UTC,"Yeah... okay I mean flexure more like ""my gear shifted suddenly on the mount"", not the flexure pro-track/t-point definitely does account for."
astrophotography,3a8130,astro-bot,1 point,Thu Jun 18 00:41:47 2015 UTC,Yes it is applying corrections in real time.  You can what them calculate.  It not like a guider sending pulse corrections via the st-4 port.  TheSkyX is the software driving the movement of the scope.
astrophotography,3a9gsf,fuck_your_cupcakes,1 point,Thu Jun 18 07:49:39 2015 UTC,"About exposure time, go as high as the camera allows you -- 30 seconds seems a bit too short for a DSLR, usually there's a setting that's called ""bulb"" that means ""shoot as long as I press the button"". The best way to do this is with an intervalometer or a remote control, to avoid moving your setup while it's imaging.  You can also use camera tethering software (if you can bring along a notebook) to control the camera, many people here use BackyardEOS, but in the CD that comes with the camera you should have Canon Camera Window or EOS... something, I always forget the name.  As for ISO, there are two opinions about it:   Opinion 1 says that there's a ""sweet spot ISO"", around ISO 800 or 1600, at which the sensors SNR tops out, and you should always shoot at that ISO to minimize noise levels. No matter what are the advantages of higher ISOs, this is the best way to shoot. On the other hand, Opinion A says there's no such sweet spot, and that, since the electronics that amplifiy the signal to reach a certain ISO level are placed before the quantization step, there's a certain benefit to shooting at higher ISO.    I mentioned them as A and 1 to avoid any endorsing. Best you can do is try one, try the other, compare results and decide for what works best for you. Until there's a detailed discussion of the subject, and both parts agree on what's really the best approach, that's the only sane thig to do."

I do have a intervalometer on the way, but it won't arrive this week, so bulb is currently not an option.   Is stacking the 30-sec photos not a good approach? I was led to believe this was the way to do it. Especially because the telescope's mount isn't a top-notch one, which might cause the photos to have trails even with as little as 30 seconds."
astrophotography,3a9gsf,Idontlikecock,2,Thu Jun 18 14:42:00 2015 UTC,"30 seconds may be achievable, but I wouldn't put much hope in anything past that, you may only get 15 or so. This is definitely your best option though, just take as many as you can and you'll do fine. (I've seen someone here that only took 3 second exposures because that's all they could handle. They took almost 200 and their galaxy was visible, even in a high light pollution area.)"
astrophotography,3a9gsf,total_zoidberg,1 point,Thu Jun 18 15:00:20 2015 UTC,"Noted, thanks! I was actually considering something around 15-20 sec to be on the safe side. I think I'll use 15 sec with ISO 1600 and see what happens. If it's not extra-crappy, I'll post it in the astrophotography sub. :)"
astrophotography,3a9gsf,total_zoidberg,1 point,Thu Jun 18 15:10:03 2015 UTC,"Yes of course, tracking is the way! Without tracking trailing depends on your focal length -- cameras have a short enough focal length to allow up to 1 or 2 seconds of untracked imaging without trails, but any telescope will produce trailing unless you go for a very short exposure (1/50th of a second or less).  For tracking, the most important thing is aligning correctly the scope/tracking mechanism. The better aligned you are, the longer the exposure times you can get without trailing."
astrophotography,3a9gsf,tigolbiggiez,1 point,Thu Jun 18 14:48:00 2015 UTC,"of course, tracking is the way! Without tracking trailing depends on your focal length   I was talking about ""stacking"" in the first part, not tracking :) I realize I was a bit unclear with that part of my question, sorry. Eng is not my primary language and I sometimes can't explain things well :)  So currently, my max exposure time is 30s. That means, until I get the remote, I was thinking about taking dozens of photos with (max) 30s exposure and then stacking them. When using bulb - do we want to take multiple photos and stack them or is the primary goal to take one single perfect shot?   Like I said, the mount is far from perfect and I don't think I'll be needing more than 30 sec for this kind of deal."

astrophotography,3a684o,LanFeusT23,1 point,Thu Jun 18 18:33:53 2015 UTC,"The ASI120 has a CMOS sensor, so not a CCD.  It has small pixels and very high framerates, both of which are good for planetary videos.  The USB3 version can get well over 100 fps for cropped videos.    The ASI120 won't be very good for DSOs in general, though you can shoot some small bright planetary nebulae with it.  It's uncooled and has a pretty small sensor, making it impossible to get much context around even small DSOS.    I don't think there is a very good all-round camera out there that does well with both planets and DSOS.  The two areas just have very different demands, leading to very different camera specs."

I have a Canon 450D that I use for DSOs, and the ASI120MM for planetary. I've seen the ASI used for DSOs, but I don't think it could compare to what my DSLR does (even considering my camera isn't that great). I also don't think the DSLR could compare to the ASI with planetary shots.  Also, you might find this interesting: This is an image of Saturn I took two years ago using a $25 Microsoft LifeCam HD5000 webcam. That was also with my C8 and a barlow."

astrophotography,3a684o,Goodguyscumbag,1 point,Thu Jun 18 19:54:47 2015 UTC,"Fantastic photo.  It makes me want to ask a ton of questions, because I want to be able to take photos like that with my own 8"" scope..  How low was Saturn on the horizon?    Do you have any sort of tube fan or cool-down technique to reduce thermal issues in the OTA?  Did you focus on Saturn, or on a star with a Bahtinov, or some other technique?"
astrophotography,3a684o,bubbleweed,1 point,Thu Jun 18 20:11:51 2015 UTC,"Thanks! Ask all the questions you want; I'm happy to answer. Saturn was around 37 degrees off the horizon. I didn't have any cool-down for my OTA... I'm in the SE USA (very hot/very humid) and the temperature was probably around 80 deg. F. I did use a dew heater because of the humidity.   I did not use a Bahtinov. I just had saturn up on my screen (using firecapture) and zoomed into about 150%, and slowly adjusted the  focus until I felt like it was clear. I mainly looked at the Cassini division to see if it was clear or not."

It would work for planetary and lunar, but it wouldn't be able to do DSOs without a new mount, and even then, that focal length would make for some tough times trying to take DSOs.   Also as far as that camera goes, you could just use a DSLR or webcam if you have either already.

I always knew the the playa would be great to image from because it's not only very dark, but there aren't any trees around to block your view. Sadly I live in Washington state. Can you just drive out in the desert to whatever location you want or are there restrictions? Are there roads? Do you need to have a 4x4?"
astrophotography,3a4eeu,CNVsCauseASD,1 point,Wed Jun 17 20:00:53 2015 UTC,"You can drive on the playa with few restrictions. There are a few dunes with brush growing that are roped off as they are nesting habitats. Driving in all dunes on the edge is not allowed, with the exception of existing roads/paths. Far to the east, there is a wilderness area where all vehicles are prohibited, but it's a drainage area so driving would be very risky with any vehicle. I've been out on the playa dozens of times with a front wheel drive Honda, no problems. If if it is wet, not even a rock crawler will make it through mud. To drive up some of the roads from he playa to old mines or hot springs, 4wd is recommended but I've seen small front wheel drive cars in surprising places. I drive around in a Subaru Impreza now and the only issue is some of the mountain roads where clearance becomes a problem.  But to drive around on the playa and look at the stars, any old car will do."

Looks like the guiding is starting to work well for you.  I know I've chatted with you about it before, but adding more data will only help.  That said, maybe there's some stuff in the stacking/processing that'll help things out as well.  In this specific one, if you blow it up to full-scale, you'll notice some leopard spots throughout the image, most noticeable on your high signal areas (like M51 itself).  Looks to me to be an overaggressive use of the MultiscaleMedianTransform, perhaps?  Whatever process it is, it's damaging the quality of your signal a bit, and among other things, causes the fringes of the targets to look a little battered.  Maybe try lessening or eliminating this step and seeing what you come up with.  If you're interested and you post the integrated image, I'd be happy to put it through the wash too.

astrophotography,3a2iba,Ryan907,0,Wed Jun 17 03:55:08 2015 UTC,It means that I removed the infrared filters that are in front of the DSLR sensor. It gives the camera way better sensitivity to red. Some people do the Baader mod which is a bit less sensitive but better than a stock camera.
astrophotography,3a2iba,idrinkcoldcoffee,2,Wed Jun 17 04:19:48 2015 UTC,"Gotcha, so it's the same IR filter modification that u/Kindark did to his camera.  The more and more I look into this, it looks like I'll need to have a camera with that mod."
astrophotography,3a2iba,astro-bot,0,Wed Jun 17 05:24:28 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure what Kindark did, but there are a few ways of doing it. I opted to take out the full filter assembly. This option helps collect more red but is not without problems. Without the filter assembly your camera's autofocus won't work. Also, if you are using a lens (refractor, camera lens, barlow, reducer/corrector) stars will appear blown out. To remedy this, I use a Astronomik CCD Clip filter. I have the light pollution filter CLS-CCD, but there is a luminance-CCD clip filter as well. One problem with  the clip filters is that you can't use them with EF-S lenses.   Other people use go for the Baader mod option which is where you replace the stock IR filter with a Baader filter that allows some IR. The benefit of doing this is that you can still use autofocus. You can create a custom white balance to get your pictures looking ""regular"" for terrestrial photography. I originally did this mod on a different camera and messed it up. It left weird red reflections.   Others people do a clear filter replacement that makes images similar to removing the entire filter assembly. This allows autoficus to work. The drawback is that it is a far more complex operation to get it to work properly.   Gary Honis has some great info on how to operate on your camera. He also sells pre-modified cameras."

Also make sure that you pay attention when turning to a new object, because it's easy to get the cords wrapped. I've already had one snap the needed to be soldered back together. Other than that you should be fine, the motors are pretty fragile, but they work great and I've never really had any problems with them. On a good night when my polar alignment is perfect, the weight distribution is perfect, and the mount is level, I can get ~120 sec exposures on the telescope, or ~420 sec exposures with just the camera and lens (due to less magnification)"

astrophotography,39x2l5,bonzothebeast,1 point,Mon Jun 15 17:49:49 2015 UTC,"Amazing image, man!    Question: Do you really use the exact same telescope and camera for guiding? Why?"
astrophotography,39x2l5,Joelsfallon,1 point,Tue Jun 16 05:03:05 2015 UTC,"Thanks bonzothebeast!  It's because my camera has a built in off axis guider. Some people swear by them, some people swear at them. I've used both an oag and a separate guide scope and don't lean heavily toward one or the other; they both work. The QSI cameras are pretty nicely integrated packages rather than a bunch of separate items so that's what I'm using for now.   That said, when I try my AT6RC out later this year, I'll likely use a separate guide scope to ensure I get more stars to guide on. The offset is there's always the chance of differential flexure between it and the main imaging scope.   This isn't an easy hobby by any means, but that's what makes it so rewarding."
astrophotography,39x2l5,orangelantern,2,Tue Jun 16 05:53:56 2015 UTC,"Aah, OAG! That makes so much more sense. I thought you had two TeleVue NP101is and two QSI 683wsg-8 and you use one set for imaging and one for guiding :\    How do you like the QSI? I haven't yet started getting into DSO imaging, but I know that I will start soon enough. I can't decide if I should buy a DSLR first and then upgrade to a monochrome CCD, or if I should just get a CCD straight up given that I do want one eventually."
astrophotography,39x2l5,Joelsfallon,1 point,Tue Jun 16 06:37:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah sorry about that. The reason it's displayed that way is because I copied from my posting on Astrobin and either I haven't filled out my gear profile properly, or it's a bit misleading. I was being lazy :-)  The QSI is an extremely well put together piece of equipment. You can tell they didn't cheap out on anything, though that's very much reflected in the price of them.   If you don't need a fully integrated camera, there's a lot more options to choose from, but if you want that ccd, filterwheel, and oag very neatly put together, it's a QSI or an Atik One (though those are Sony chips, not Kodak/Truesense) or the high end SBIG cameras, but those are VERY expensive.  Other than that, you can mix and match components from various manufacturers that can work out equally well.   As for the DSLR to the CCD or CCD right off the bat, that's a tough one. If you want to shoot narrowband, then the DSLR is sub-optimal, yes you can mod it to be more sensitive, but it won't ever compete at the same level as a dedicated monochrome ccd and then you'll have gimped it for normal photography. On the other hand, if you're fine with broadband/rgb images, the DSLR is pretty handy in that you can use it for every day photography as well.   I have both, though when I first tried shooting with my DSLR, it was readily apparent that my local light pollution made it near impossible to capture anything of worth. My location has changed to darker skies now, but only after I sunk all my money into gear.   It boils down to money, or perhaps having more money than brains sometimes. It's a hobby where you can spend the earth if you're not careful."
astrophotography,39x2l5,jVestMan,3,Tue Jun 16 17:07:51 2015 UTC,Great quality! It's amazing how little noise there is exposing for 30 solid minutes stacked only 32 times. I can't wait to see what big-league cameras a like in 10-20 years.  What mount did you use?
astrophotography,39x2l5,orangelantern,2,Mon Jun 15 19:59:09 2015 UTC,"Its practically non existent! Having that many 30 minute exposures helps an awful lot with SNR. You say 30 minute pictures stacked ""only"" 32 times. Thats a shit load of times considering its 30 minute subs!  edit: That's 16 hours!"
astrophotography,39x2l5,orangelantern,2,Mon Jun 15 20:10:47 2015 UTC,"Thanks Joelsfallon!  Keep in mind that I used a few passes at noise reduction within PixInsight. The raw data isn't horrendous by any means, but I tend to use HA as luminance when processing tri-coloured images and it's the smoothest of the three bandpasses  so the image in general benefits.   It also helps that I'm in an orange zone for imaging. Not ideal by any means, but far from the white zone I used to live in.   I use an Astrophysics 900GTO. It is truly superb, and possibly the finest piece of equipment I own."
astrophotography,39x2l5,Empyred,3,Mon Jun 15 20:14:02 2015 UTC,"No amount of narrowbands will eliminate the clouds of Germany for me :(  That mount is borderline research grade right there, mad jely."
astrophotography,39x2l5,TheDaddyofKush,2,Mon Jun 15 20:40:03 2015 UTC,"I can fully empathise with your cloud problem. There is about 6 months of mostly cloud and rain here with few pockets of dry sunny skies over the winter. It's very green and lush here as a result so I guess I can't complain too much.   As for the mount, it is pretty crazy. Were it not for a stock payout when my company was acquired it would have remained a thing of dreams rather than reality. I gave up my observatory when I moved across the country, but polar alignment and mount sync takes about 3 minutes. Other than wheeling it out of its shed, there's next to no work to get it on its way.   Of course it helps that I'm imaging at 435mm. I'll have to be a bit more careful when trying out the AT6RC that I snagged."

astrophotography,39wixk,technojamin,6,Mon Jun 15 11:57:56 2015 UTC,They are called 'Newton Rings' and are refracting artifacts between the classcover and the ccd chip. They are a regular pain in the a$§ whith h-alpha photography... I did make flats but they acutally made it worse this time.

Did the temperature drop in those 3 hours?  I'll bet it did.  Also, PI has a ""cannon banding script"" that is useful, it does look like a bit of banding going on, but that could be because of the bias used (you may need to use more to get that pattern noise to not show up).

You should utilize a combination of the star mask and range mask in order to keep deconvolution from hurting your stars. That inner darker area of the stars can be avoided by utilizing masks.

astrophotography,39stqb,yawg6669,2,Mon Jun 15 01:04:42 2015 UTC,"You use the ""RangeSelection"" process under Masks in Pixinsight.  Basically it will mask your image based on the signal. Deconvolution as one example doesn't work terribly well in low signal areas (or on stars). So what you can do is use pixelmath to make a mask where the trifid nebula is only visible (to be modified), and then subtract the star mask from that.  Here are the steps sort of:   Preview of the range selection being setup What it looks like applied Use pixel math to combine the star mask with the range mask (depending on how you think about it or if you invert things) Applying the newly made mask with pixelmath leaves you with something like this   You can improve it by using convolution on the star mask before using pixinsight, to make it a bit fuzzier.  Anyway, if you do that, then you can push your post-processing of the nebula harder without screwing up your background and stars."

From the image can guess you used a tripod and it was untracked (there's star trailing and it seems consistente, so no hand shake), ther's little noise, and the trailing isn't severe, so I'm guessing low ISO (800 or 1600?) and about 1 second exposures -- but It'd help a lot to know the camera.

astrophotography,39sehv,michael1026,3,Sun Jun 14 08:22:10 2015 UTC,My guess is that your AT6IN is out of collimation slightly. At the very least your blue seems a bit off-focus. You can see the blue circle off-center from most stars. Aside from that you can start taking flats so that you get rid of those dust donuts in your image.   but I feel this one isn't much better even though this is the most data I've done for one image.   Well for AP images 13 x 5 minutes isn't all that crazy. I would think you'd need at least double that to start seeing obvious improvement over less exposure times.
astrophotography,39sehv,dreamsplease,1 point,Sun Jun 14 09:19:28 2015 UTC,"I thought it might be collimation. I checked it a few days ago and it seemed fine. I'll have to try adjusting it more.

astrophotography,39sehv,yawg6669,2,Sun Jun 14 09:23:20 2015 UTC,"yea, I'm with dreams on this one, it looks like collimation, but could ALSO be seeing and guiding which is resulting in the 10.8FWHM on the stars.  Until you get collimated and try again, there really won't be any way to tell how close you were with the other factors (focus, seeing, guiding)"
astrophotography,39sehv,dreamsplease,1 point,Sun Jun 14 15:54:57 2015 UTC,"I think my scope might have actually been slightly out of focus too. Oh, well.   Almost certainly. You're getting about a 10.83 FWHM star size in arc-seconds. Things start looking out of focus around 3.5. Most nights you should be able to be under that.  Your 10+ value is going to be a bit higher due to the collimation issue, but I reckon you were still a bit out of focus."

This has been, by far, the hardest thing I have done in this hobby. The Coronado has an extremely short back focus, and the focusing mechanism is just weird (it uses a pentaprism to focus). I tried, and tried, and tried, and I just couldn't get the sun to come into focus. From searching online I saw that almost every one has used a different method to image the Sun with a PST. For some people, the ZWO worked at prime focus. Others had to use a barlow. Some others got it to work with an eyepiece projection. And some used DSLRs (with an eyepiece or barlow).    Here are the things I tried on various different days:     PST with Nikon D7100 at prime focus PST with Nikon D7100 and 2x barlow PST with Nikon D7100 with 25mm eyepiece projection PST with ZWO ASI 120MM-S at prime focus PST with ZWO ASI 120MM-S with 2x barlow PST with ZWO ASI 120MM-S with 25mm eyepiece projection (taped the eyepiece to the 1.25"" adapter that came with the ZWO) PST with ZWO ASI 120MM-S with 25mm eyepiece and 2x barlow (again, taped the eyepiece with the barlow in front of it) PST with 12mm eyepiece with iPhone using an Orion Smartphone/Camera mount PST with Nikon 7000 and 2x barlow PST with Nikon 7000 with 25mm eyepiece and 2x barlow   The picture that I posted was taken with the last of those (Nikon 7000 + 25mm + 2x). That was the closest I got to getting an in focus image of the Sun. For the duration of the month that I had the PST, I read up extensively online about how to get it to focus: http://coronado-pst.blogspot.com/ http://umich.edu/~lowbrows/reflections/2006/mdeprest.26.html http://www.buttynights.com/page/articles/cat/user-reviews/coronado-pst-review-r2754  I also watched videos and followed what they explained: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYDzdYkVbGM    I bugged various other redditors who were able to achieve focus with the PST (go through my comment history and you'll find lots of questions about the PST) on this sub for help and got some great advice, but for whatever reason, none of the things worked for me. At this point, I've given up (I have to return the scope tomorrow) and realized that this image is the best I can do."

Any eyepiece,  8.8 through 40mm, none work, BUT if I use my ES3x barlow, bam, no problem.  I don't get it.  Anyway, see why I don't want to image the sun and would rather focus on DSOs?  Totally different ball game.  So much easier just to look.  :)"

For planetary, it is taking a video, taking the individual frames and stacking them to get your picture  For DSOs, you need a mount to track your object and a scope. You take some long exposures (I have seen some near 30 minutes) and you take multiple of those (have seen some in the hundreds for amount taken). After that, you take your images, stack them, and process them in a program.   Any thing else I can help with?"

astrophotography,39let2,spacescapes,11,Fri Jun 12 15:31:38 2015 UTC,"This is the second chance I've had to image from a fairly dark site (blue zone).  Amazing the difference it makes compared to imaging in the city!  My main goals were to get some color out of Rho Ophiuchi on the right side, and get good detail in the nice dark dusty details around the core.  I couldn't quite get it framed how I wanted due to trees and horizon just below frame, but close enough.  Antares doesn't get very high above the horizon where I image.  Equipment:   Celestron Advanced VX EQ mount (no auto-guiding) Canon T4i DSLR Sigma 18-35mm f/1.8 Art lens at 35mm   Conditions/Location:   Blue light pollution zone Temperature 12C, camera sensor was reading about 18C Above average transparency and seeing (although near the horizon the stars were twinkling, which is where I was shooting, so not very good) No moon Taken from Vancouver Island, BC (near the town of Shirley)   Capture details:   Captured using Backyard EOS ISO 800, f/2.8, 35mm 22 x 200 second lights 1h 13m integration time 90 bias, 40 flats, 4 darks (it was after 2am and I just wanted to go home instead of shoot more darks...)   Processing details:  Processing is a bit of a blur as I don't yet have a ""standard"" workflow.  Here's what I remember:   Stacked in DSS (after some pain and final realization that the hot/cold pixel rejection was ruining my images.  That will now remain off forever.) Some prep in Lightroom to fix white balance and light noise reduction Photoshop CS2   Light crop Stretch with levels tool A few iterations of curves to bring out details Unsharp mask with huge radius (I think around 60px) to make those big dust lanes pop.  I did this after doing a ghetto star mask by selecting by color value for highlights and inverting.  Lightroom   Boost saturation/vibrance/clarity Boost luminance and saturation for blues, oranges, magentas (this really brought out the nebulae due to lum boost)  Back to Photoshop   Add ""star glow"" since all the cool kids are doing that these days. Basically add a new layer with levels brought down to only show largest stars, do a heavy gaussian blur, then bring levels back up for the big blurred stars.  Set layer type to ""screen"".

astrophotography,39let2,Monrius,2,Sat Jun 13 02:03:11 2015 UTC,"really nice data, it's amazing what dark skies can do.  quick 10 minutes in PixInsight - didn't do much processing but I like how it turned out - imgur link  I think the main difference is that I didn't go as far on pushing the saturation and colors as much as you did.  My thought is that you tried to pull out the nebula colors and it ended up looking a little over-saturated.  I do this all the time.  I've had to learn to dial back my saturation/color boost, still takes me several attempts at processing to get a final image."

Definitely a more natural look to your version. I'll admit I like a good amount of saturation, but maybe pushed it a bit far.  The stars in your version are especially nice.  Less blown out and nicer color than mine. Granted you only spent 10 minutes on it, but I prefer the Rho area in my version ;)  I had to spend extra time processing it to get Rho how I wanted without affecting the rest of the image too much."

The stars as less blown out in yours, I think something happened along the way in my processing that bloated them too much.  Probably the sharpening.  What did you use to edit? There's a bit of a green cast in yours, I think I just played with the ""tint"" in Lightroom to get rid of that.  Although my colors are far from perfect."

astrophotography,39let2,tphelan88,2,Fri Jun 12 22:27:38 2015 UTC,"So how do you rate that lens for astrophotography? The stars look fairly sharp, pretty good for f/2.8."
astrophotography,39let2,tphelan88,2,Sat Jun 13 14:29:13 2015 UTC,"Personally I think it's one of the best wide angle lenses for crop sensor cameras.  Getting f/1.8 at 18mm focal length is almost unheard of.  It also has great optical performance even at the lower f-stops (low aberrations, coma, super sharp).  Most lenses don't have acceptable quality until f/4 or so., but I have even shot at f/2.2 with great results.  f/2.8 seems to be the best tradeoff between quality and light gathering for this lens, so I'm sticking with that for now."

There's a few of us redditors in this area if you didn't know already.

I just recently started getting into some astrophotography of my own, and I had a question regarding compositing/ photo stacking two pictures I have.  I have a Canon 70D, with a Rokinon 14mm f/2.8. I shot both locked down on a tripod. The first picture is with the stars in focus, the second picture is with a yucca plant (also lit up faintly by my flashlight) in focus. I am trying to combine the two photos so that the yucca and star pictures are combined into one photo.  I already edited both photos in Lightroom, then sent them to Photoshop to try and ""erase"" the blurry stars from the yucca photo (the in-focus star shot is in a layer below.) I'm having issues being able to erase close enough to the yucca leaves. Is there a better solution than this? What is your workflow? Thanks for any and all suggestions!"

astrophotography,39n126,yawg6669,1 point,Fri Jun 12 23:44:38 2015 UTC,a C6 would be a decent fit I think.  You could probably push it to a C8.

I know that one day I'll want to use an autoguider, but right now I don't have a lot of guiding experience. I'm currently trying to figure out, generally speaking, what hardware I'll need, and I just have a question or two about using a homemade system with commercial autoguiders, and how autoguiders work exactly.  From reading around the internet, I understand a commercial autoguiding camera like this one needs to connect both to my laptop (where the guiding software will be running) through USB, and directly to the mount through an RJ-12 cable.   If my mount is already connected to my computer (just for info, I'll be using two stepper motors connected to stepper drivers connected to a microcontroller, and the microcontroller will be connected through USB to the computer. That's the gist of the plan anyway. And I know I'll have to write an ASCOM driver for it), and the autoguider is connected to the computer, and the guiding software is being run on the computer, why the heck do I also need to have the guider directly connected to the mount? I don't have much prior experience with autoguiding, so in a normal setup, which signals are passed through which connections exactly? What does the basic system diagram look like?  I know that I could possibly use something like this from shoestring astronomy, but how can I guide just with an autoguider connected to my computer, guiding software on the computer, and the mount connected to my computer?

I'm relatively new at this, but my understanding is that you certainly wouldn't need to be in focus, or attached to the scope, to take dark frames, because no light will be coming through the scope into the camera anyway.    As for taking darks inside, though, it's very possible that temperature differences between outdoors and indoors will lead to a poor result.  If it's -5  C outside and 20 C inside, the noise produced by your camera will be different, which will lead to non-optimal dark frames.

astrophotography,39n126,NNYPhillipJFry,1 point,Sun Jun 14 19:16:20 2015 UTC,Well I already have a DSLR...so I can use that for DSO and use the web cam style to guide. For planetary I can probably just get away with using the guide camera and leave the DSLR out. so what is a good inexpensive camera for guiding that would also work for planetary?

I'm also thinking that you'd have to do some weighting of the stacks -- say, if you have 90 images from night 1 and 10 from night 2, it's obvious the stack from night 1 will be cleaner. I've never seen the option to weight images for stacking, so I'd make 10 stacks of 10 images each and then combine then.  I think this is getting too complicated and I'm not sure it'd make a noticeable difference.

For planetary, a mount also helps, but you can still take pictures of planets without a super nice mount that cost hundreds and hundreds of dollars.   If he doesn't have a scope though, planetary is out of the question, and getting a scope + mount + camera would most likely put him over budget if he wanted anything decent that would last.

There is a ""resample"" process, but that isn't used by batch pre-processing afaik.  When you open up a single light frame that you are giving the pre-processing script, it is definitely 6k x 4k?"

astrophotography,39i39l,dreamsplease,2,Thu Jun 11 21:52:40 2015 UTC,Yeah... I'm not sure. Maybe it has something to do with debayering your image?
astrophotography,39i39l,verylongtimelurker,2,Thu Jun 11 21:54:49 2015 UTC,True. I've never understood debayering. Mind if I ask for an explanation on the debayering part of post processing? (ELI5) Pretty Please? :)
astrophotography,39i39l,dreamsplease,3,Thu Jun 11 21:57:02 2015 UTC,"Your DSLR is really just a mono camera. However to create color, a Color Filter Array (usually a Bayer Matrix) is overlaid. Now your 24MP mono camera is recording 6MP red pixels, 12 MP green pixels and 6MP blue pixels.  Debayering algorithms attempt to interpolate the 18MP red pixels that were missing, the 12 MP green pixels that were missing and 18MP blue pixels that were missing.  As you can see, that's a whole lot of interpolation if you are absolutely adamant that you need to retain the 24MP resolution. Because you're interpolating so much, you're introducing a lot of data that isn't real. This becomes a rather big deal when the interpolation algorithm starts to interpret noise as detail it should be trying to reconstruct. The result is that, what was once small noise grain, starts to bleed into neighbouring pixels, at best creating blotchier noise grain (which is hard to remove) and at worst starts creating small correlated detail that isn't real (which is neigh impossible to remove).  However, if you're happy to say ""I don't need interpolation of red and blue, and I could use a more precise signal in my green channel"" then using a quarter of your resolution will guarantee you will have a real data sample for each channel (and some much needed bonus precision in your green channel).  Add to that that high resolutions go to waste anyway in seeing limited data and you don't actually lose any detail by doing this, just resolution."
astrophotography,39i39l,verylongtimelurker,2,Fri Jun 12 06:20:54 2015 UTC,"Thanks for posting this. I think it's interesting because I bet a lot of people use interpolation algorithms that don't quarter the resolution - thinking that it will improve their astro image. They then do all their processing on this image, and wind up not liking their stars, tracking, or whatever... and then they resample down to a quarter res anyway :-P. If they were going to do that resample at the end, they likely would have been better off just doing the proper debayering in the first place.  Anyway, this is something I've never really thought about since I shoot monochrome. I see a lot of people scoff at the resolution of monochrome CCDs in favor of color sensors, and this makes for interesting food for thought in that regard."
astrophotography,39i39l,autowikibot,1 point,Fri Jun 12 06:30:16 2015 UTC,"Actually, you can keep full resolution if you perform Bayer Drizzling - scroll down to the bottom of the page. In simple terms, it involves shifting the image a tiny bit between frames in such a way that, once you combine the frames, you get a real reading for every channel for every pixel."
astrophotography,39i39l,dreamsplease,1 point,Fri Jun 12 23:39:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah, well by that logic we can drizzle to an even larger scale to get an even bigger image.  Drizzling is great and all, and I use it for my monochrome images; however, hearing that I can drizzle a quarter of the res to get back to what I thought it was in the first place isn't terribly impressive :-P.  This is just the case of me not thinking about the implications of the bayer filter on the resolution claimed by DSLR manufacturers. I'm sure there are all sorts of approaches to get images upscaled/drizzled/interpolated to achieve the claimed native res of the camera - but I think the implications of doing that are understated. A 2x drizzled image is not as good as an image natively resolved in that resolution that you are 2xing to. It's not bad, and I certainly do it - but it's not the same thing."
astrophotography,39i39l,dreamsplease,1 point,Fri Jun 12 23:55:18 2015 UTC,"With Bayer drizzling, it kinda is close to 'ideal' though (but, you're right, not quite). When you think about it, Bayher Drizzling is just a very roundabout way of applying a filter wheel to the full CCD - it's the same thing; we're making sure every channel has a sample.  In fact, if you stack multiple images that have been debayered with something like bilinear interpolation (e.g. something very simple that just fills in the gaps with averages), you're almost doing the same thing (provided you're doing the shifting/dithering). The interpolation will be slowly corrected by readings that got it 'more right' for the missing pixel, because for some frames the pixel wasn't actually missing and nothing had to be made up - those pixels readings will 'win' and stand out vs the stuff that was made up.  Bit of a tangent, but the latter is also why 'smarter' algorithms like AHD (which actively try to reconstruct detail) are less effective in the same situation, as the stuff they make up (artifacts) is hard to distinguish from stuff that wasn't made up. This is a nice example of how AHD (left) performs vs Bilinear interpolation (right). AHD gives you more detail (see in particular the fern fronds), but also gives you more detail that isn't necessarily real. Bilinear debayering (recommended if you'll be stacking multiple images) doesn't even try to recover detail, but also doesn't introduce detail where none was detected - it tries to be as neutral as possible. That neutrality really helps stacking algorithms to do their best."

Its particular arrangement of color filters is used in most single-chip digital image sensors used in digital cameras, camcorders, and scanners to create a color image. The filter pattern is 50% green, 25% red and 25% blue, hence is also called RGBG,   GRGB,  or RGGB.   It is named after its inventor, Bryce Bayer of Eastman Kodak. Bayer is also known for his recursively defined matrix used in ordered dithering.

I've never actually imaged with a DSLR and PI together. I'm also not sure how DSLR manufacturers represent the resolution of a Bayer filtered image.  The idea of a Bayer filter is that each pixel is represented by 4 sensor wells which  are filtered RGGB in a square. So maybe when you open an image alone in PI it is showing it at that resolution, and then integration merges it into just a single pixel?  I really don't know. Maybe someone who images with a DSLR and uses PI can tell you."

I usually use the PHD2 drift align method.  It took a few nights through it to get used to it, but I do find it to help.  The Celestron mounts' polar align methods (All-Star, I believe on the AVX) actually works quite well, from my experience, which makes the drift align either painless or unnecessary.  It is a nice sanity check to perform, though."

Were you able to run the drift align in PHD2 (even if not adjusting anything)?  That'd give a sense how close PA actually is.  Also, I wonder if theres some flex or focuser sag that is accounting for the less-than-ideal guiding.  If this is the case, tightening things up (rings, focuser locks, etc) should help."

astrophotography,39dqyi,oenoneablaze,2,Thu Jun 11 05:44:05 2015 UTC,"The Lunt telescope has a built-in Hydrogen Alpha filter.  Through the eyepiece, the sun is a very deep red."
astrophotography,39dqyi,autowikibot,3,Thu Jun 11 05:53:12 2015 UTC,"First off, this is an amazing image—thanks for sharing it. I feel like I learned something just by looking at it.  Next, I was curious if anyone knows—why does it appear as if the surface of the sun is darker towards the edges? Since the source of the sun's luminance is not the reflection of light from other bodies, this might imply that the light originating from its surface is not radiating in all directions equally, and that it's strongest at a tangent to any given surface. Maybe this is because the light we see coming from the sun is at least partially coming from deeper within the sun? On the other hand, I remember reading that the light coming from deeper within is constantly being absorbed as energy and re-emitted by outer layers. Anyone have some insight?  Also, I think this would do really well on /r/interestingasfuck."
astrophotography,39dqyi,spacemark,6,Thu Jun 11 05:18:17 2015 UTC,"Thanks!  The effect is called limb darkening, and you're completely right about the cause.  Towards the middle of the sun, you're getting photons that are passing straight out through the outer gas layers.  As you go closer towards the edge, the light is coming at you from more of an angle, passing through more of (and getting filtered out by) those same layers.  On the other hand, the brightness of the prominences around the rim of the disk is completely artificial.  Prominences are actually very dim compared to the solar disk.  I pulled up their brightness because it just looks sort of neat that way..."
astrophotography,39dqyi,TheWhyteMaN,1 point,Thu Jun 11 05:45:31 2015 UTC,"Limb darkening:       Limb darkening is an optical effect seen in stars (including the Sun), where the center part of the disk appears brighter than the edge or limb of the image. This phenomenon occurs mainly as the result of an outwardly decreasing temperature in the lower stellar atmosphere; its understanding offered early solar astronomers an opportunity to construct models with such gradients. This encouraged the development of the theory of radiative transfer.    Image i - The limb-darkened Sun - An image of the Sun in visible light showing the limb darkening effect as a drop in intensity towards the edge or limb of the solar disk.

astrophotography,39hp8q,iBaconized,2,Thu Jun 11 20:03:03 2015 UTC,"Get that baby collimated! The mirrors might not be aligned properly. Reflectors tend to have their mirrors move out of place easier than other types of scopes, so you might want to invest in a laser collimator on ebay for cheap, or if the scope doesnt have the small circle on its back mirror, there are other ways of collimating it. There are DIY ways of collimation as well, but I took the easy road ;).  With that 3"" I'd say you could see the moon, stars, and glimpeses of planets on a nice night (although I am no expert, just giving my opinion). Probably not DSOs, but in the end, most of the time it depends on your location and how well viewing conditions are.  All of this is coming from a amatuer that had just really started getting into it all as of a few months ago, so my observations may not be entirely accurate. :)  As far as AP goes, there is the wiki that can help you find what setup you can use for your price range and target."

Its going to be hard due to your mount not being able to track, but with a wide eyepiece ( high number, like 40mm) you can get a bright star like vega or arcturus and defocus it a bit. Adjust the screws/whatever on the bottom of the scope until the dark shadow of the secondary mirror is in the center of the light-orb.

astrophotography,39dfed,bubbleweed,6,Thu Jun 11 00:44:40 2015 UTC,After being impressed with recent ISS pics on here I thought I'd give it a try. I used my C11 on the Cgem dx mount. I attached a Canon 1100D and focused on Jupiter using Backyard EOS. However I decided to ditch the laptop for this. I couldn't figure out how to shoot continuous mode using Backyard EOS (is it possible?) and also didn't fancy tripping over usb wires etc. I put the camera in manual and set ISO at 800 and exposure at 1/640 to start and then 1/2000 as it got brighter and higher. I powered off the mount and did my best to keep the ISS passing through the centre of the telrad cirlce again and again with my finger held on the camera release. No one shot is particularly good but as a sequence it works well I think.

astrophotography,39ejg7,total_zoidberg,3,Thu Jun 11 14:04:37 2015 UTC,"Yes, the GIF is two single shots taken one-night apart.  I have an Alt-Az mount, so I'm limited to relatively short exposure at higher-ISO. The brighter objects in the GIF are stars and the fainter ones are mostly ISO noise. The raw images in the GIF and the new image were much brighter and noisier, so I used Photoshop Despeckle and Levels to darken it up as much as possible.  A really good site to use to help find Pluto against the star background is TheSkyLive.  After taking my own shots, I save a screenshot and background image from that site and align it with my own shots to find it.  It works wonders."

astrophotography,39czsp,rnclark,2,Wed Jun 10 22:57:24 2015 UTC,"Cool picture, but you'll obviously get a lot of people here who don't understand what you've done.   During mid eclipse, with the Moon quite dim, many stars can be seen and photographed near the Moon.   That may be, but it's not super relevant to how you do this.   This is an HDR composite of 2 exposures with a Canon 6d 20 megapixel camera and 500 mm f/4 lens: 1) 2 seconds at f/5.6, ISO 200, and 2) 30 seconds at f/4, ISO 1600.   So even if you didn't stretch the image with the stars more dramatically, there is still a tremendous difference in light in the background with all the stars.  I get that you realize all of this, but certainly a lot of people won't. I think it's a neat image, but I think it should be clear (not just explained in the technical details), that even though the moon was relatively dim, it was still vastly brighter than the background you've composited."
astrophotography,39czsp,dreamsplease,0,Wed Jun 10 23:28:37 2015 UTC,"There is a 30x difference in the 2 exposures.  The brightest stars are visible in the shorter exposure, and several were visible visually through the camera viewfinder.  Certainly something like this is not possible out of eclipse except for the very brightest stars.  The main issue in this image was not so much the brightness of the Moon, but the brightness of the light pollution."
astrophotography,39czsp,dreamsplease,1 point,Thu Jun 11 00:32:00 2015 UTC,There is a 30x difference in the 2 exposures.   Assuming you stretched both images the same then that could be a good estimate of the difference in brightness between the composited images.

Still, that I can string a few clear nights in a row together is a lot less frustrating than I found living in Toronto to be for imaging. Successive clear nights were very hard to come by there, and the humidity from spring to fall definitely impacted clarity.  Also, I've determined that I prefer rain to brutally cold winters.

Make no mistake though, there is a tradeoff; it rains here quite a lot for about 5-6 months. Makes everything green and lush, but not all that awesome for imaging.   As for your own woes, that's the weather gods imposing their toll on you. New equipment means rotten weather, almost without fail. Nothing is more maddening.   One thing you may want to look into is using some automation software for your imaging runs. I've used CCDCommander, and CCDAutopilot, but I've heard great things about Sequence Generator Pro. There's also MaxPilote which is free, and so pretty hard to beat price wise. Any of them can automate the handoff/interaction with whatever software you're using for navigation, focusing, platesolving, image capture, so on. Once you get around their learning curve, you can often polar align your scope for the night, turn everything on, enter the plan into the planning software, and hit the sack. Most of the time, you'll wake up to neatly captured sub-exposures ready for processing."

Yours will have a decidedly red tinge to it because hydrogen alpha data is very much in the red spectrum. SII data is even more so.   If you look at http://starizona.com/acb/ccd/advimnarrow.aspx you can see where the colours land on the spectrum. In the Hubble palette, SII is typically mapped to red, HA to Green, OIII to blue as opposed to Very Red, Red, and Greenish respectively."

astrophotography,396crw,dreamsplease,1 point,Wed Jun 10 06:33:52 2015 UTC,"Narrowband is very satisfying, though now that I have darker skies I really do need to start some broadband imaging too. I snagged a little AT6RC that I need to play with a bit more during galaxy season.   The 3nm do seem relatively parfocal with the 5nm as well as the Astrodon LRGB GenII filters I have as well. That said, in case they aren't perfectly parfocal, I always refocus when shifting filters. Any automation software you'd use will take care of this for you along with FocusMax or the like so it's a bit of lost imaging time, but not much of a hassle. The NP101is is also pretty thermally stable which helps.   I do find that they're close enough for me to strictly use my luminance filter for platesolving without refocusing regardless of whichever filter I'm using for imaging."

astrophotography,396crw,Idontlikecock,1 point,Tue Jun 9 22:29:03 2015 UTC,Thanks RFtinkerer!  I just looked through your history and you have NOTHING to cry about dude. Your images look great. The only suggestion I'd have it to make sure that you employ masks a bit to isolate the stars from the nebulae and vice versa. This way you won't stretch your stars when trying to bring out any nebulosity or when trying to smooth the background and you won't impact the nebulous bits when trying any deconvolution or sharpening on the stars.

That will allow you to bring out the fainter parts of the galaxy. Dark frames should be taken at exactly the same settings as the light frames (same exposure time, same ISO etc). Also, I don't know if you did this but, take the dark frames while you're taking the light frames (take 5 light frames and then take a dark). Don't take the dark frames before or after all the lights. This is because you want the sensor to be at the same temperature as when it took the light frames. Next time, also take bias and flat frames."

In all honesty I'm still learning both techniques though! I only recently fully understood about using the digital zoom to achieve true 1:1 pixels with the prime focus 550D and how powerful the stacking software is to allowing me to take longer videos to stack. The other thing is that I can achieve a greater ""zoom"" with the additional optical zoom of the point & shoot.

I sent it in to get repaired and also got surgery so its been a while. The dew shield was replaced with a new one and now everything is working great!) I didn't bring the autoguider out because my plan was to mainly image Saturn tonight. Spent a considerable amount of time on Saturn then quickly took this image to test the optics. I was surprised how well this stack turned out considering how rushed this was. Had to keep the exposure times low because no autoguider. The target was very low in the sky and there was a rising moon too. I removed the LP filter out of the corrector/flattener to see the difference, (previously I was using an Antares LP filter and there were these little blue reflections around the brighter stars)..

astrophotography,394lpc,cats_can_fuck_off,6,Tue Jun 9 05:39:10 2015 UTC,"I agree with all the comments about hot pixels - you will never find a standard DSLR without them! Taking darks, bias, and flats are you friend. Use these when stacking and they'll essentially vanish.  Another thing to consider is that if these photos are taken on a stationary (normal) tripod then you might be in focus but exposing for so long that you are catching the motion of the earth. I know that with my Canon 550D and an 18-55mm kit lens on a standard tripod I can only get 5-10 seconds of exposure before I start seeing the movement of stars and getting star trailing, even with perfect focus. This effect is worse the longer your focal length (i.e. the more ""zoomed"" you are).  To get longer exposures than that you will need to invest in a tracking mount, and this is why all astrophotographers have had to sell their gran :)"
astrophotography,394lpc,sagramore,1 point,Tue Jun 9 07:01:33 2015 UTC,"The main concern is that it doesn't matter how I rotate the camera - when I shoot in very dark conditions (be it in my room or outside), the same red pixels are in the exact same spots."
astrophotography,394lpc,sagramore,2,Tue Jun 9 10:52:53 2015 UTC,"That's right, but that's normal for hot pixels. As explained by some of the other commenters these hot pixels are on your sensor, they are probably permanent, and they are normal. Under ""standard use"" in daylight you don't tend to notice them because the exposures are short, but the long exposures of AP bring them out. Over the course of using your camera more will probably show up as well!  You need to take some dark frames. These allow the stacking software to know where the hot pixels are and correct for them / remove them. They average the surrounding pixels to generate data for the missing pixel.  My original comment was regarding you secondary question about focusing at night. I think your focus is okay, I just think your exposure is so long that you are getting trailing from the rotation of the planet vs your stationary tripod. The best thing to do with focus is find a very bright star or the moon and focus, then move your camera to the position that you want to photograph. They are all ""at the same distance"" as far as your camera is concerned."
astrophotography,394lpc,bobchin_c,3,Tue Jun 9 11:17:29 2015 UTC,"You are not doing anything wrong, and the camera is fine.  The red pixels are hot pixels. You can eliminate them by either using a cooled astro camera, or in your case by subtracting a set of  equal length dark frames and bias frames. Look up Astroimaging calibration.   As for focusing, you can use live view and zoom in on a star and manually focus the lens. Autofocus won't work at night."
astrophotography,394lpc,1kLlamas,1 point,Tue Jun 9 06:27:49 2015 UTC,"I'm on a mobile so it's hard to zoom in to pixel peep, are they in the exact same spot? Those might be hot pixles, they tend to be a bit more visible at higher ISO's. You only really see those if you're zoomed way the heck in (past 100%). There are some fixes in editing you can do, or since its new, maybe exchange the camera if it's in the same place every time (that might be an indicator of a stuck pixel)."
astrophotography,394lpc,1kLlamas,1 point,Tue Jun 9 06:30:55 2015 UTC,"Yes, they are all in the same spot, that's why it seemed strange. I tried again today, turned off the light took a long-exposure photo. Red in the same spots.  The lens wasn't zoomed in at all, it was zoomed out all the way."
astrophotography,394lpc,1kLlamas,1 point,Tue Jun 9 06:49:01 2015 UTC,"You might try what this guy recommends here to see how many hot pixels you're dealing with if it helps make your decision on exchanging or not. Like the others here have said, every camera has some and there's pretty easy work arounds, so it might just be knowing where to look when editing your photos in Photoshop."
astrophotography,394lpc,_Matariki_,1 point,Tue Jun 9 07:04:25 2015 UTC,"As for focusing, put the camera in live view ( think the 3200 has that option) and then zoom in on an individual star and focus on manual. Should make things a bit better."
astrophotography,394lpc,_Matariki_,1 point,Tue Jun 9 06:32:39 2015 UTC,I think these are either hot pixels (if they are in the same spot all the time) or just thermic noise (if they vary in position). You can get rid of them by either substract a dark frame (that should eliminate some of the thermic noise) or do a stack of several light frames with kappa-sigma clippng so that these high sigma variations will be filtered out.
astrophotography,394lpc,mnmachinist,1 point,Tue Jun 9 06:49:39 2015 UTC,"But why do I get the same red pixels in the same locations? I also tried today with long exposure and high iso in a very dark room - same pixels, same locations."

Next time I will try with the C11 and achieve more bigness, or use a barlow.  Acqusition was done using a Canon 500D on a Skywatcher MN190 mounted on a Skywatcher EQ6 mount. The camera exposure was set on Vega, and various snaps were taken until Vega just started to become dim on the camera's preview. I ended up going for ISO800 and 1/4000 second exposures to keep the motion blur to a minimum. The camera was set to continuous shooting mode and a remote shutter used to hold down the button to take continuous 1/4000 second exposures. The telescope was slewed manually with the mount powered off and the ISS tracked using a 50mm finderscope. The pass magnitude was about mag -3.  Once captured the image was taken into PixInsight where a Colour Calibration was performed (since my camera is H-alpha modified and gives a red cast), and the histogram slightly transformed to raise the contrast between background and spaceship.  Next time I would like to increase the exposure slightly because it's a little dimmer than I would like. While the body seems nicely exposed the solar panels aren't really visible.

astrophotography,38yw32,gravelmonkey14,3,Tue Jun 9 02:45:07 2015 UTC,"I wait for it to pass over using my weather forecast on http://clearoutside.com/ to determine the time and direction of the pass. The ISS is very bright and easily visible to the naked eye, so as it is passing I look through the finderscope on my telescope and try and keep it in the crosshairs while taking pictures. This obviously requires the finderscope to be aligned quite well, so it's best to do that on a star or something before you start."

I would LOVE to get all of your raw data, including those darks. I'd be so happy if I could play with it to see what I can get. Would that be possible? I know it's a couple hundred megs, but I have a crappy sky tonight and would love to process this. If you can, PM me with a link or something, or just post it here."
astrophotography,391is0,mmokkp,2,Mon Jun 8 18:31:08 2015 UTC,"It's about 2,4 GiB, it ill take a while to upload. Btw, I want to say the camera is a charm, and I love it. It really surprised me with its performance and I'm amazed at the results. I think the worst thing for the results were the conditions (heavy light pollution) rather than the camera, and I wonder why those with DSLRs stop at ISO 800 given the incredible performance that can be achieved with current technology sensors. Also, I can't wait to get a micro 4/3 or a 1"" sensor camera."
astrophotography,391is0,mmokkp,2,Mon Jun 8 19:11:20 2015 UTC,"Many times iso above 800 will not create any additional information. It is often the ""sweet spot"" for the camera, giving much information, at low noise gain. In my opinion this is achieved on iso 1600, but everyone should do as he thinks is best. Also, this iso settings are given for a cameras that are on a tracking mount. In such case you can choose what iso you will use as the potential exposure is infinite.   You (and me too) don't have that comfort, so we often use some ridiculous iso speeds (like 12800). IMO with your camera you should do like 1 sec exposure with 3200 (2 sec would probably be to much, and I hear you can't use iso 6400 at 1 s), even though you'd lose some light. I haven't seen what you can do from the raw, but such noise levels are pretty tough.  Also, the raw file that you show (in jpeg, but i believe that this is what the raw looks like) is heavily processed by the software you use. This is not a raw file (As I understand, you took the photos in raw, and then created tiffs from this raws, right?) If it was raw you would be able to see much much more color noise.  PS. Wait, so you are actually uploading? If so, huge thanks!"
astrophotography,391is0,yawg6669,1 point,Mon Jun 8 19:34:19 2015 UTC,"I'm trying to upload to mega. Expect it to be up tomorrow? It says it'll be done in about 15 hours -- my ISP gives me about 512 kbits upstream -_-"" Update: browser crashed overnight, starting again. Update 2: link in main post.  Yes, all images are RAW (.CR2 files, which is actually a variant of TIFF), and then created TIFFs with Canon's software. Those were made into PNGs (because of ""operational difficulties"" working with TIFFs in Python+Windows) and that's what I uploaded and imgur converted to JPG. What you see is what came out from the RAWs.  About the camera and exposure times, the G16 is curious thing. Unlike the G12, instead of having a ""high sensitivty mode"", it just lets you use ISO 12800, and if you go over a certain exposure time, it sets you to a lower ISO. Maximum exposure times, are:   ISO 12800 -> 1 second ISO 3200 -> 30 seconds ISO 80 -> 250 seconds   And those are also the ""cut values"" -- if you set an exposure at 40 seconds, it automatically sets ISO to 80.  I prefer to keep my exposures under 1"" because at full zoom that already gives a very slight trailing -- that's also why I used 0.5"" exposures for this image. I'll try to make a tracker and see how it works with longer exposure times."
astrophotography,391is0,mmokkp,1 point,Mon Jun 8 22:59:06 2015 UTC,"Hey man, I'm so confused about this process.  I'm not sure that your method of background subtracting is legit (meaning, actually does what it is supposed to do).  For example, why did you use a threshold at 112?  What is that anyway?  A threshold of what?  Also, I don't understand the point of all this?  Why not just take your raws (note: is it RAWs?) and stack them in DSS?  If you do that,w hat do you get, can we see?  It's great that you're willing to write scripts to do cool things, but I don't want this thread to mislead people into doing things in ways that either A) may not work, B) may not work for them, or C) are actually incorrect, but SEEM to work based on the info provided."

astrophotography,38xstq,dreamsplease,1 point,Sun Jun 7 20:24:44 2015 UTC,"Well keep in mind that drizzling doesn't really provide much benefit if you don't have a lot of subs for each integration, and they need to be dithered too. I would think at least 20-25 subs to drizzle.  Honestly I question why you would do deconvolution at all. Have you tried doing the same exact processing steps without decon? Deconvolution is usually used to help overcome seeing conditions, but the images you are posting are at 5.56 arcsec/pixel. There's no way your seeing is that bad. I would have to assume if decon is doing anything it would be helping if you are out of focus. I would think your images might actually look better without decon. Maybe try inspecting your subs with Pixinsight's subframe selector. What kind of FWHM are you seeing for your stars? If you are resampling your images to 50% (which looks to be the case, at least)... then as long as your FWHM is below 2... you likely don't want decon at all. If it's higher than 2, then I reckon you have some focusing issue (or like the worst seeing ever)."
astrophotography,38xstq,dreamsplease,1 point,Sun Jun 7 20:44:21 2015 UTC,"Oh my bad, I didn't deconvolve (a bad copy/paste from my previous post). I tried but as you said, the result was better without it.   My FWHM is pretty bad, between 2.5 and 2.8. My focuser and my refractor are not made for such heavy ccd. I also had a bad polar alignment and some flexures issue on my focuser.  Concerning the number of number of subs, as I said it was a test but I'll do much more for sure next time.   For reference here is the Ha image.  Thanks again for the help !"
astrophotography,38xstq,dreamsplease,1 point,Sun Jun 7 21:06:07 2015 UTC,"My FWHM is pretty bad, between 2.5 and 2.8.   Well that makes sense. Your actual native resolution is 1.39 ""/px (I assumed you resampled less than you did). So a FWHM of 3.89 "" isn't that crazy with your drifting from polar align in addition to the field curvature. On good subs at best I can get around 2.0""/px for typical nights, so that's not too far off of yours (accounting for those things).  Whenever you have an HA field that pretty much fills the sensor (or at least a good portion of it), consider using HDRMT with the defaults except 9 iterations. Don't use LHE if you do this (imo). It will help ""pop"" the HA data, which is what you want if you are going to use it in HaRGB."

I tried the mask generator (http://astrojargon.net/MaskGenerator.aspx), but end up with a completely black mask...  This is for a Sigma 18-35mm lens.  I used 35mm for focal length, and guessed 60mm aperture (complete guess based on 72mm filter size, but I will actually measure it if this will work), and just left edge thickness at default.  Would love to get perfectly sharp widefield images.  I will definitely be making one of these for my Celestron C6 though!"
astrophotography,38u1sd,mashed_potato_famine,3,Sun Jun 7 02:33:50 2015 UTC,"Try making a Hartmann Mask -- it's pretty much the same, but it creates a different pattern. For example, you can try with 3 triangular holes, equidistant from the center of the circle, and that will create 3 triangle shaped projections in the camera -- with the Hartmann Mask you have to adjust focus untill all 3 ""ghosts"" overlap and you have only one bright projection.  The main difference I've seen with the Bathinov Mask is that the Hartmann is much darker -- but for a small diameter like a photographic lens, it's a lot easier to make (maybe?)."

I was out imaging Saturn last night and right as I was done, the moon came up and so I thought I'd do the same thing you did here: use my ASI with the RGB filters and get a mosaic. But I have the 120MM-S, so I get a lot of magnification with it behind the C8. And I realized that it would take me another hour and so I decided to call it a night. But now looking at your image, I might actually give it a go. So, you took 8 panes of the moon, and each pane was R+G+B, so that's a total of 24 x 1500 frame videos. I'm assuming you combined the RGB after stitching the individual channels together? So basically:     Stack each of the 8 x R and 8 x G and 8 x B panel videos Apply wavelets and LRD to each of the 24 panels individually Stitch together all R panels, then G, and B Put the 3 stitched R+G+B together   Is that correct?"

astrophotography,38q2oi,Idontlikecock,1 point,Fri Jun 5 22:00:30 2015 UTC,"Firstly, this is a great image. If it weren't for me spending so much time working with HA data I wouldn't have any objections. I'm also doing this target myself, so I have a good idea of how it should look (in my opinion, at least).  Okay, so aside from needing to flatten your field (you can do this in PI btw) -  Your image got a little beat up with deconvolution. I'm not sure how many iterations you did (probably at least 15), but it's obvious (having done plenty of decon myself on HA data). The problem with deconvolution is how it interacts with stars. It will make a dark center in your stars (very obvious at the top brightest star towards the middle), and it will also brighten stars by creating a ringing artifact. So what decon does to stars detracts from the quality of your image, by distracting you from the nebula itself. So what you need to do is make a star mask, then only decon the non-masked area.  The other thing is deconvolution sort of shits on lower signal areas. It makes it look sort of ""bumpy"". This is less obvious in your image, but you can make a range mask, the make one mask out of both star and range masks and do decon on that.  Besides that, my personal preference is to go lightly with LHE. With NB images being so high SNR relative to broadband images, there really isn't as much of a need to bump up contrast in the nebulosity.  Above all else I'd highly recommend you drizzle. If you dither your data, it makes a tremendous impact in the result. The reason for this is that most of the post processing you've done here has negative aspects to it (distorts it). These algorithms work much better on the 2x drizzled version. When you are done post-processing the drizzled version, you then use the resample tool to go to 50% (the native res). If you just do that alone, it will probably mask the issues you have with decon.  Edit: Oh right, try 10m subs if you can. There are plenty of ""easy"" narrowband targets like the lagoon nebula that 5m subs will work great for, but crescent isn't necessarily one of those."
astrophotography,38q2oi,taposk,1 point,Fri Jun 5 22:48:43 2015 UTC,"Looking at your image again, I see you did resample to 50%. So you were probably seeing the things I am talking about as result of decon. So drizzling basically makes it so you get the benefit of that resample, without halfing your resolution. I'm not 100% if 40x 5m is enough exposure time to do this, but it might be."

astrophotography,38q7p5,michael1026,3,Fri Jun 5 22:16:13 2015 UTC,"Okay, this is a question that I've always wondered and people ask me, but does anyone (not necessarily here) make money off of astrophography other than actual professional astronomers? I spend too much time on Astrobin and some people on there have what seems to be $50k worth of gear. At that point, it seems like more than a hobby. The only way I could ever see spending anywhere near that much is if you made a living off of it, but I see no way that's possible other than selling prints, which I don't see people doing.  Edit: $50k might be an underestimate."
astrophotography,38q7p5,mrstaypuft,4,Sun Jun 7 08:31:34 2015 UTC,"Great question -- I was just asking the same thing in a chat yesterday.  I'd love to hear other responses on this as well.  What I've found (and of course there may be rare exceptions) is that no one makes a living of off it.  There are plenty of folks who sell prints through a personal or commercial website, but nothing that'd fund, say, $50k in equipment, much less anything beyond such an expense to cover living expenses, etc.  Perhaps some photos get you published, or you make some royalties somehow, but even so, I still don't think we'd be talking about making-a-living money.  The folks with a ridiculous amount of gear, from what I've seen, tend to either currently have or have retired from quite gainful employment in a different field.  Instead of buying that Porsche, why not build a giant observatory on your property?  It seems universally to be a labor of love, personal satisfaction, and curiosity than a money maker."
astrophotography,38q7p5,nuggetbram,2,Sun Jun 7 14:47:01 2015 UTC,"I've recently been looking at photos here and elsewhere, mostly images of the milky way, with seemingly huge (5-60 minutes) exposure times. For me, a photo with an exposure time of 40 seconds (100D on a tripod) starts to wash out the image, as well as showing some star trails. How is it you can have such a long exposure, and what benefit does it create?"
astrophotography,38q7p5,mrstaypuft,5,Sat Jun 6 04:44:30 2015 UTC,"5 minute exposures and 40 second exposures are quite different animals.  The images you saw with 5+ minute frames were very likely on a tracked/guided setup (rather than a stationary tripod).  On a stationary tripod, trailing will occur at these lengths, period.  Depending on your focal length, the part of the sky you're shooting, and your camera sensor, trailing at 40 seconds is very likely.  The reason we try to expose over longer periods of time is because the faint details in the universe (including the milky way) are incredibly dim, and longer exposures will help bring these details out.  Image stacking is one way to compensate for shorter exposures, and this entails taking multiple shorter exposures and combining them to maximize the signal.  (On stacked images, sometimes you'll see the ""integration time"" which is the total of the stacked images' exposures.)  With a perfectly tracked/guided setup, the limiting factor for one's exposure length is typically light pollution.  For example, a 3 minute unfiltered exposure on my driveway in the middle of city will overexpose the sky and ruin the image.  If I drive an hour north to a green zone, I can shoot 15 minute frames without any background sky clipping.  (Both with tracked/guided setups, of course, to eliminate trailing.)  Hope that helps!"

They also give you the joy of seeing things you did yourself. My first pictures were a far cry from anything worthy, but they still made me happy.  Do you have a local astronomy club you can join? You might be able to find an Elmer to help you out and show you the ropes. Plus you will get to try out telescopes, which if you get serious about AP, are going to be in your future.  After your first basic photos, you could try your hand at shooting with a barndoor tracker. These are usually hand made and most of the stuff you can get at a hardware store for a few bucks/quid. They allow you to start taking longer exposures without star trails. This is when you start seeing more of the deep sky, nebula, galaxies and star clusters. But these won't be very close up for most of your shots. For that you will need to graduate to a telescope.  Somebody else mentioned purchasing an intervalometer. Those are used to automatically open you shutter for a fixed amount of time, and you can set the number of shots you want to take.  These are not very expensive. One of the benefits is you don't have to press your shutter and risk shaking your camera."

astrophotography,38q7p5,yawg6669,3,Sat Jun 6 19:58:51 2015 UTC,"1)  Read noise.  Shorter exposures won't necessarily expose long enough to beat out the read noise and give a high enough SNR,  at least for faint things.  2)  It depends on what you get, and how you camp.  I camp all the time, like this:  drive to site.  Empty car.  Setup gear.  Drink beer.  Fall asleep in car.  Wake up with sun.  Pack up.  Drive home.  So, it depends."
astrophotography,38q7p5,mashed_potato_famine,2,Sat Jun 6 20:21:22 2015 UTC,"Long exposures let you see fainter objects. Drawback of longer exposures is noise, either from the electronics or from skyglow. Darkframes help subract the noise from electronics, but the longer you go, the more you have to stay on top of changing tempuratures.  If a satellite or plane passes thru your shot during a long exposure, its there for good. With stacked, you just toss it out and use the rest of your frames. Seeing conditions are additive in long exposures. If Jupiter is a boiling ball of light due to bad seeing conditions, you end up with a blurred image. Taking several shorter shots allows you to pick the best ones.  Tracking- with long exposures, you need to be on your game. You can do this with an autoguider,  which is a camera that is locked on to a star and sends corrections to your mount. You can also physically do this with a guide scope and crosshair eyepiece. This is how it was done in the days of film.  The bulky factor depends on how you go camping. Is it car camping or hiking? If by car, its fairly manageable. There are smaller telescopes, mounts and portable power supplies that will easily fit in the trunk of a car.  You can throw in a laptop as well . Hiking however...not likley unless you just want simple star trails and wide field shots."

astrophotography,38q7p5,themangeraaad,1 point,Tue Jun 9 14:22:36 2015 UTC,"So earlier this week I picked up a Canon t2i DSLR & today I picked up a CG5 ASGT. Was hoping to be able to find a good deal on a scope before I leave for vacation tomorrow but sadly that didn't happen and I'm going to have to suffice with only a camera/mount to try and get some shots next week... poor me, right? ;)  So my question is - is there a guide out there on how to get a solid polar alignment w/ a camera only? Everything I've found focuses on polar aligning a mount w/ scope... nothing to give tips on just using a camera. And additionally my CG5 doesn't have the polar alignment scope. Is it just a matter of ""zoom as much as possible (inc using digital zoom) and get the polar alignment that way, then zoom out (digital zoom) for the actual photos?  And also, while I'm here, is there a guide on camera settings, tips, & tricks for widefield/DSO photography? I'm new to photography in general but have a good idea of what settings do what and how they can affect the picture... but astrophotography may be a bit different. Tips on settings or how best to focus the camera and such would be great!   I understand that the basics of getting a polar alignment will be the same as any guide for doing so with a scope... but I feel like it would be a hell of a lot more difficult to get a truly accurate polar alignment w/o being able to focus in on a single star. Granted with the lower zoom of a camera vs a scope the polar alignment can probably be a bit less precise... but if I'm going to do it I'd like to do it right so I don't develop bad habits before moving onto more precise optics. Thanks!"
astrophotography,38q7p5,yawg6669,2,Sun Jun 7 00:39:09 2015 UTC,"You can drift align.  I'm not going to go into details here, but the process is the same for a camera and a scope.  The good news is, with a camera lens, your image scale will be huge, so polar align will be less of an issue the further from celestial equator you shoot.  Of course, you can always crop.  :/"

astrophotography,38q7p5,mrstaypuft,1 point,Sun Jun 7 03:33:52 2015 UTC,"Ok, great!  That's a refractor, looks pretty similar to an ST80 (link here) which has 80mm aperture and  400mm focal length.  You mentioned you are interested in planetary photos.  This type of scope isn't the best for doing so.  I think you should be able to achieve focus on this setup with a T-mount adapter for your camera and a proper 1.25"" adapter for it, and you could play around with un-tracked sky photography or try some planets while you're at it to see what you can get.  With these accessories, you'd remove the diagonal on the scope and hook your camera directly to the focuser.  If you do this, you'll need to get familiar with stacking short exposure photos using AS!2/Registax for planetary, or DSS for deep sky.  Don't want to fool you -- This isn't a great astro photo scope, particularly as mounted on a non-tracking mount.  But I believe you ought to be able to try some stuff out with it with the purchase of a few mounting accessories to try your hand at it if you'd like.

astrophotography,38q7p5,goober12,1 point,Mon Jun 8 00:09:50 2015 UTC,"For the question about whether to expose well or underexpose, my understanding is that for planets you want to get an exposure on your single frames that looks ""good"" to the eye--i.e. not under or overexposed.  That should give you the most details in the final stacked image as well.    If your camera doesn't have an option to reduce gain/ISO or exposure time, and Jupiter is overexposed as it is, you won't be able to get a good image."

Can anyone explain to me what a high end mount like that does that my Sirius mount can't do? The mount I'm specifically talking about is the Takahashi EM-400 Temma-2M. It only has an 85lb payload and I've seen other mounts go higher. Besides the payload and better quality gears, I can't really read up on anything that justifies getting a $7900 mount when I can get a used mustang for that amount."
astrophotography,38q7p5,yawg6669,1 point,Mon Jun 8 02:37:01 2015 UTC,"In two words, precision engineering.  The premium quality mounts will track better, to the point of doing unguided images.  Payload of course is useful, and at the high end, 85lbs capacity means 85lbs of gear, not the ~50% that mass production mounts offer.  While youre sirius may track pretty well, if you actually measure your mounts periodic error, you are probably in the 10-15 arcseconds peak to peak.  What this means is that through a worm cycle, the exact center of a star in your fov (excluding seeing and optical aberrations) will drift 15 arcseconds, that is, it will trail IF you have a reasonably small  image scale (think, 1arcsec/pixel).  To correct for this problem, we (APers) guide, called ""guiding out"" the errors.  The premium mounts (I can't speak for that specific model, only for the one's I've researched) have default periodic error less than 7 arcseconds peak to peak, with periodic error correction (the mount correcting itself because it ""knows"" about those errors) being as low as 0, often in the 3 arcsec peak to peak range.  So, if your image scale is 2arcsec/pixel, which is a common, reasonable value, and if your seeing isn't that good, which is also reasonable for most people's locations, the amount of star motion in an image due to the mount is LESS than the amount of motion due to seeing, this is what we call ""seeing limited"".  Under those conditions, you don't need to guide, because seeing cannot be guided out.  To solve that problem, you need adaptive optics.  Does that help?  Btw, if you want to measure your periodic error, and correct for it (your sirius can do that), you can use some specifically designed software called PEMPro.  I highly recommend it.  :)"

astrophotography,38q7p5,arandomkerbonaut,1 point,Tue Jun 9 20:16:06 2015 UTC,"The issue with imaging satellites is that they are so small. The ony real way you can get detail on the ISS is cause it is huge and bright. After looking at LightSail on Heavens-Above it's magnitude ranges from around 3.5-5, which is really dim for a satellite. Not even really seeable by the naked eye unless you're outside of light pollution.  I think the only real deteail you could get on lightsail would be if it's sail was actually open, and I don't even think it's as large as the ISS fuilly opened, hence why it's not that bright."
astrophotography,38q7p5,Bersonic,1 point,Tue Jun 9 22:35:29 2015 UTC,3.5-5 is quite bright for a satellite. Most hover in the mag 8-11 range. I'll bet we could resolve the sail if we knew where it was going to be.

astrophotography,38q7p5,yawg6669,1 point,Wed Jun 10 01:09:40 2015 UTC,"Exposure time is dependent on target and conditions.   Locations can be found via Wikipedia and stellarium.

To do long exposures (necessary for capturing faint DSOs) you really need an equitorial mount. Otherwise you will get field rotation.    Here's a couple of links explaining about field rotation.   http://www.astronomyasylum.com/telescopemountstutorial.html  http://www.astrotx.com/Field%20Rotation.htm  You might be able to get away with 30 sec to 1 min exposures, but more then that, and the problems start."

astrophotography,38pg3j,bobchin_c,3,Fri Jun 5 20:40:16 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry, but the way your post is worded is what made me ask. ""I understand my telescope is large and with my current tripod its not 100% ideal for astrophotography compared to a Alt-AZ tripod. however, I have what I have at the moment, a regular tripod (computerized tracking).""  What  you posted, is  that what you have is  not ideal for for AP compared to an Alt-Az tripod. I'm guessing that English isn't your native language.  In regards to Exposure time no more than a minute is what I responded with. You mentioned that you wanted to capture a galaxy, not an easy thing to do with a 30 sec exposure Which is how I responded. You can try M31, M51, M81/82 those are all fairly bright and you should get something in 30 sec. ISO no more than 1600 or you'll get too much noise.  As for programs, I like Nebulosity for acquisition and stacking. It might be able to handle field rotation by stacking with translation. You'll have to try. Shoot RAW not JPG by the way."
astrophotography,38opyy,zach0508,5,Fri Jun 5 16:23:45 2015 UTC,"I don't have experience with those scopes in particular, but I don't recommend those choices for a new person.  First of all they're alt/az, second of all they have a LONG focal length (not newbie friendly), and third of all they're SCTs (mirror shift, locks, etc), on a fork, (AP quality motors/gears?  I don't know).  What would you like to shoot?  Targets dictate scope and camera, but mounts are forever.  Look for a GEM like an EQ5 or EQ6.  How much frustration failure are you willing to put up with?  What gear do you already have?  Camera?  Other scopes/mounts?"
astrophotography,38opyy,yawg6669,1 point,Fri Jun 5 16:29:24 2015 UTC,"I was hoping to shoot planets mostly so I was going to buy a Microsoft Life cam because that seems to be the favorite for shooting planets. I'm pretty patient, so I can deal with a lot of frustration and failure. The scope wouldn't just be for photography. I know my family will want to use it for observation. I do have some telescope experience, just no astrophotography experience."
astrophotography,38opyy,yawg6669,5,Fri Jun 5 16:39:53 2015 UTC,"Ok.  Well, 1500 bucks can get you a LOT of scope if you're only wanting to use it for visual/planetary.  I would recommend checking out the ZWO cams.  They are stupidly awesome planetary imaging cameras for a pretty good price.  I would also recommend mono, although OSC is much easier.  Unfortunately, those cams are pretty much planetary ONLY, you won't be getting anything useful DSO wise, so think hard about what you wanna do, then do it.  Of course, you can always sell that cam to fund a different one (that's what I did after I got bored of planetary).  Those ACF models are good scopes for visual, but for visual, aperture is king!  Check out a 10 if you can, or maybe consider a dob (again, you're limiting yourself to planetary, if you're ok with that, then by all means go for it).  Personally, I have a Celestron C11 and it is an amazing visual and planetary imaging scope, although the fork mounted version (CPC1100) is pretty pricey new (hence the dob suggestion).  Just some thoughts."

astrophotography,38opyy,_ThatsNoMoon,3,Fri Jun 5 17:30:01 2015 UTC,Standard ED80 refractor on a nice equatorial mount might be of interest.  Something along the lines of: http://www.telescope.com/Telescopes/Refractor-Telescopes/Refractor-Telescopes-with-GoTo-Mounts/Orion-Sirius-ED80-EQ-G-Computerized-GoTo-Refractor-Telescope/pc/1/c/10/sc/336/p/24281.uts  Perhaps the zeq25 mount instead (lightweight).  You could save some money buying used too.
astrophotography,38opyy,iBaconized,1 point,Fri Jun 5 20:36:06 2015 UTC,How do you think that telescope would compare to the Meade models for observation?
astrophotography,38opyy,_ThatsNoMoon,2,Sat Jun 6 05:34:19 2015 UTC,ED80 makes a great observation scope for bright objects planets/moon. For DSO's(along with planets) it's hard to beat a Dobsonian mounted reflector. Dobs are much cheaper but are not for imaging so that is the trade off. It really depends on what you want to do. ED80 would allow wider fields images than those mead scopes you mentioned. Wider images are easier to take and as others have said those meades are probably not the best choice to start out with. You can always buy used then sell later for little loss if you want to change equipment.
astrophotography,38o6ha,ijakeee,4,Fri Jun 5 14:12:36 2015 UTC,"We usually use Manual (M) mode on the camera since that one allows us to set all the settings. For milkyway shots you should use the shortest focal length (18mm) and the widest aperture, set the ISO to 1600ish and experiment with the exposure time until the stars stop streaking. 20 seconds is a good starting point for 18mm but different parts of the sky will streak at different rates so you will have to fine tune it yourself.  For lunar, 210mm, aperture doesn't matter, low shutter speed and ISO. Probably like ISO200-ish and 1/4000 but again it depends on the sensitivity of the camera - I don't have a Sony personally so these are just guidelines.  It's worth reading up on exposure time, ISO, shutter speed and aperture if you haven't already - all of them are important for astrophotography and each camera will perform slightly differently so you will pretty much have to find the ideal settings yourself. It helps to know what effect each factor has on your images."
astrophotography,38o6ha,IKLYSP,3,Fri Jun 5 14:31:18 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind that 18mm is equivalent to 27mm with full frame cameras. so like IKLYSP said, 20 seconds is a good starting point as the 500 rule which is 500 divided by (your focal length x crop factor) so you'd be at 500/(18*1.5)= 18.5 seconds. The rule will prevent the starts from visibly trailing (blurring) in your photo.   the kit lens doesn't let a lot of light in. at 3200 ISO you're around -5.6EV. You can pick up a cheap samyang 12mm f2 lens which will let in a lot more light do to it's aperture AND will allow you expose for much longer if you are looking for milkyway shots.  Check out this calculator: http://www.lonelyspeck.com/milky-way-exposure-calculator/"
astrophotography,38o6ha,nebulight,2,Fri Jun 5 15:43:30 2015 UTC,"I have a similar camera.  Using 210mm lens, you can get some OK photos of the moon. Will look better if stacked. Much better. As for the settings, auto mode will be enough to shoot moon. However if you plan to stack (much better quality), manual mode will have to be used. I suggest putting the ISO to something like 400, and starting with 1/200 of exposure time (this lens is pretty dark, f6.3 at 210). Also, the images will be nicer if you shoot raw. Find some noob friendly tutorials about camera settings on the web. Everything will be much clearer then.  The 18-55 can be used for wide-field only if you live in a very, very good area. Light pollution will be a major problem. The lens is pretty dark at 3,5 (18mm) so don't expect much. As for the settings, you can go as high as 3200 or 6400 ISO and 25-30sec exposure time. With that you will be able to get some photos of the galaxy core, though not great ones (but you'll be super happy with the results, I guarantee)"

Mounting the lens on a 45° angle to the head because I don't have any spacers and the head is to large for the lens plate.  I can keep the lens pretty still, but even with liveview It's very hard to see if I'm in focus or not due to noise (liveview x10). Another problem is locking focus down because the elements are on a spring so it returns to closest focus unless locked. What feature of the moon do you use to focus ? I've been using the edges.   How do you make very fine adjustments to focus ? Focus past infinity and use bellows on a rail to bring it back ? Focus on the edge of clouds in daytime and lock focus until night falls ? Abandon the idea and get another lens ?   I have similar problems with more modern glass as well though, just not being able to make adjustments small enough.   This is what I can come up with using the Novoflex 400/5.6 x2 on the 500D, I'm still very inexperienced with this sort of editing.

astrophotography,38j2ya,zsanderson3,3,Thu Jun 4 15:35:29 2015 UTC,"Details:    Telescope: Orion SkyView Pro 8"" Newt Reflector  Mount: CG5 EQ with Magnificent Mini Autoguider  Camera: ZWO ASI120MC  Additional Equipment: Barlow 2x  Red zone light pollution. 7 Bortle scale.  40 sequences of 500 frame videos    Processing:    All videos were captured in SharpCap2, with 500 frames per video, and all the same sharpcap settings for each video.  Stacked in Registax6 keeping the best 50% of the frames, then using the same wavelet values for each stacked image.  Stacked and waveleted images were imported into photoshop CS5 where I aligned them all and created a mosaic using CS5's photomerge function.   The photomerge function successfully matched the vast majority of the panels, but there were a few that it couldn't do, so I went in and manually aligned them and blended them into the final image.  Then imported the full lunar mosaic into PixInsight where I did a Localized Histogram Equalization to enhance some of the large-scale contrast in the moon.  Then in PixInsight I did an LRGB Combination to increase the image saturation to give it some color.  Finally, I brought the image into Paint.NET to do final framing and scaling. No actual editing to the moon was done in this step.    Comments:    I think this is probably the best moon photo I've ever done, so I'm very pleased with it! I think the color and contrast is great, especially for a full moon, considering it's so difficult to get any crater detail due to the lack of shadows. I really like this one because I think it is processed just the right amount: not too much, where it looks totally fake, but not too little, where it looks very bland.  The keen-eyed observer may notice a couple of sections in the mosaic that look a little discolored and fuzzier than the others. That's due to a few minor holes in my mosaic. To fix these holes, I did a franken-moon edit where I used tiny sections from a different, lower resolution moon photo, to fill in the gaps. Overall, I think I did a fairly good job covering up the gaps and blending them, but they are still noticeable if you look closely.  Final Note: the resolution of this image is approximately 1 pixel = 1 kilometer, which is a pretty darn nice amount of detail if you ask me."
astrophotography,38j2ya,jamesgreddit,2,Thu Jun 4 15:46:22 2015 UTC,"Great work, really good mosaic. Congratulations!"
astrophotography,38j2ya,IKLYSP,3,Thu Jun 4 19:52:11 2015 UTC,Very awesome. I've been wanting to do the same with my C11 but it tends to get cloudy half way through every time I've tried.  The hardest part of doing lunar mosaics IMO is keeping track of which sections you've done. I found a cool program called iMerge which lets you drag and drop videos as you take them into a kind of preview mosaic to let you see which sections you've covered.
astrophotography,38j2ya,IKLYSP,2,Thu Jun 4 15:52:28 2015 UTC,"I agree! That is a huge pain, and I always either miss some small little section, or end up going way overboard and covering the entire moon twice, lol  I'll have to give that program a shot next time I do a large mosaic like this! But, I probably won't be attempting this again anytime soon, because it's a nightmare to do it all, lol, I consider doing DSOs easier than this."
astrophotography,38j2ya,_bar,2,Thu Jun 4 16:01:08 2015 UTC,"It takes a while for sure, then you have to process each of the videos individually. My Jupiter timelapse was 306 separate videos, and that took 3.5 hours of acquisition and at least 20 hours of processing. I expect the moon will be a similarly large project especially if I decide to do it in RGB. It should be worth it though.   With DSOs it's the opposite, long acquisition times and relatively short processing times without having to slew every time you take a new frame or adjust filter wheels manually."

astrophotography,38gmr7,dreamsplease,3,Thu Jun 4 10:47:21 2015 UTC,"I'm in inner city Melbourne with really bad light pollution, luckily this doesn't effect observing planetary objects since they are really bright. It's more a case of the heat from the city causing atmospheric turbulence."
astrophotography,38gmr7,MrNarc,1 point,Thu Jun 4 10:59:14 2015 UTC,"Generally I'd advise getting a 2"" tele-extender for photographic work.  They produce 2x magnification over the primary in a much more reliable manner and don't induce as much chromatic error as a barlow.   They DO cost more but they're very reliable.  A good 2"" 2x will run about $200 but will work with coma correctors etc."
astrophotography,38gmr7,MrNarc,2,Thu Jun 4 11:21:31 2015 UTC,"Interesting. How do you rate eye piece projection with a quality eyepiece? A good tele-extender is definitely something I'll look into when I want get more gear to improve the quality of my images.  Edit: Also, is chromatic error less of a deal breaker for planetary images, since the planet is such a small object in the entire FOV?"
astrophotography,38gmr7,metalvinny,1 point,Thu Jun 4 11:32:42 2015 UTC,"Generally the eyepiece you want for EPP is gonna be a Teleview Plossl in the 16 to 19mm range.  For the most part without a variable distance adjustment that results in about the same size of image as the scope itself gives at prime BUT when you slide away the image gets bigger and bigger on the sensor.   You have to try out a few shots to maximize detail vs luminance depending on your equipment.   I've got a shot someplace I did of Saturn with my STF8300C without stacking https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B2G1DIsSJshiem1JNkt5MlRlX2M/view?usp=sharing it's a single frame shot.   This was done with an f12 155mm R-Maksutov Cas (iOptrion) and a 9mm cheap cheap plossl (and a purpose built $2500 chilled camera).  You can see how the magnification from the eyepiece itself exceeds the accuracy of the telescope on a whole.  If I'd taken that shot with the 16mm I recently purchased I would have had to move the camera even further away to get anywhere near as large an image but the detail would probably have been better even at the same size.   You can see that there's some miss-alignment in the optical path by the chromatic error on the image from top to bottom - adding in a tele-extender, eyepiece projection unit and on down the list can be difficult to shim.  What the EPP allows you to do is match the magnification of the scope with the best amount of sensor for the resolution of the image.  You can change magnification simply by moving the camera towards and away from the eyepiece.  The chromatic error can end up being nasty and uneven due to all the little shifts in the optical path and it DEFINITELY gets worse as you go towards the edge of the field of view.  If you can use a tele-extender to get the magnification you want, it is by far the better option.  You can get a 4x unit for the price of the EPP assembly and a good eyepiece with much less path hassle than using EPP.  There really is NO substitute for accurate aperture when doing planetary shots.  Yours should be able to do Uranus and Neptune if you can ever find them."

astrophotography,38gmr7,IKLYSP,6,Thu Jun 4 16:54:47 2015 UTC,"The video ends up with 8000 frames, and that's a lot of shots/wear to put on your shutter, let alone at 3fps (Max my camera can do) it would take 45 minutes.  Secondly, because you are shooting the video in the cropped sensor mode, you are actually recording in the full resolution of the sensor, but just the centre portion of it. No down sampling or quality degradation occurs. If you shoot a picture, you don't end up with more resolution of the planet, you just capture more of the black space around the planet (you effectively increase your FOV).

astrophotography,38gmr7,BlueSquadron,2,Thu Jun 4 09:22:48 2015 UTC,"Just a question, so I understand it right, did you record a video and the software split it into frames? If so, how long was the video? Did you have to do any tracking? My telescope has a motorized thingy but I have yet to figure out how to use it. I have a celestron powerseeker and a rebel t3, but have yet to do any real astrophotography because I seem to not get how the telescope works, lmao. I'm working on it. Great guide though!!!"
astrophotography,38gmr7,DrMintIcecream_PI,3,Thu Jun 4 12:52:40 2015 UTC,"Yep you record video and the software converts it into frames.  Usually I film about 4-5 minutes for Saturn, 2-3 for Jupiter.  I have to manually track the objects, but it's more of resetting the view rather than tracking. What I mean by that is I place Saturn on the right edge of the frame and let it drift across to the left edge. I then bump and budge my telescope til saturn is back to the right edge and I let it float across again. You repeat this process 4-8 times since each time it only takes about 30s to drift across the frame."
astrophotography,38gmr7,DrMintIcecream_PI,2,Thu Jun 4 13:21:19 2015 UTC,"I've tried using my DSLR to take video through my 10"" Dob but I don't have enough focus to even get the image close to being in focus.  I don't want to buy a longer T-ring or anything so I use my CMOS planetary imager.  Great post though.  I need to get better at using the wavelets in Registax."

astrophotography,38gmr7,alanb101,2,Thu Jun 4 08:38:44 2015 UTC,"The Skywatcher has a focus point slighter further out compared to most 8"" dobs, so I can reach prime focus without any modifications.  However, with a barlow, it pushes the focus point out a little bit further so that sometimes helps with focus issues. Most Dobs should be able to get DSLRs to reach focus with a barlow."

It's not too off topic. Say I'm interested in this. Let's start with the telescope.. if you're just looking through the telescope without a camera involved, can you see the planets as clear as in images 15-18, or is it the post processing that does the magic. I'd really like to first obtain a telescope and figure that out before I ever try adding a camera to it.. just wondering if I'd be disappointed or not.  It appears from this sub that with a <$400 telescope I can see some really cool space stuff. That's enough for me, the photography would come after.   Thanks!"

astrophotography,38lwpq,anicelysetcandleset,3,Fri Jun 5 01:55:28 2015 UTC,"I'm looking at this scope as well, let me know how it performs!   As for gear,  the Orion Field Flattener for Short Refractors is what I've seen recommended and should do the job.   For a camera, it really depends on your budget, you can get away with something cheap like a Canon T3i, or go all the way with an expensive CCD. I use a T5i and eventually am looking to get a 7D Mk. II (~$800 and $1700 new respectively). The results I've seen from this scope are good at both ends of the spectrum.   I don't believe you should be using a diagonal when imaging, just attach the camera directly to the Flattener, which is attached to the back of the scope. For visual use whatever diagonal works should be fine.  LP filters are good especially if you can't make it somewhere dark, here is a good filter I've had recommended to me for that function. There are also IDAS LPS filters basically shop around for whatever suits you best.  That autoguider seems to work well for people (eyeing it myself again) and as for a mount I'd say an Orion Sirius or better, the mount is crucial in everything AP. All this info and more detailed stuff is in the wiki in the sidebar, and I'm sure someone more experienced can tell you even better."
astrophotography,38lwpq,OrionThePursuer,1 point,Fri Jun 5 02:45:19 2015 UTC,Are all CCD's monochrome? I looked up some a while ago and saw that at least a lot of them were. Why is this? Are all the colors in images of galaxies and such just put in there using photoshop?
astrophotography,38lwpq,yawg6669,2,Fri Jun 5 14:28:57 2015 UTC,"No.  There are one shot color ccds (OSC).  Monochrome gives you better resolution as the entire sensor is being used with each filter.  The colors are not put in there with photoshop, they are captured with filters.  Check out my section of the wiki on ""filters"" for more info."
astrophotography,38lwpq,OrionThePursuer,1 point,Fri Jun 5 14:52:25 2015 UTC,"As /u/yawg6669 said, not all CCDs are monochrome but those that are use RGB filters to capture colors.   As for DSLRs they're capturing colors already (as they're used for normal photography as well) and any editing done in Photoshop/Lightroom/Pixinsight/GIMP/etc. is only accentuating color/structure that is already present in the data. NOTHING is being added in these programs, and often it's as simple as adjusting contrast, exposure, saturation, and SNR. Though with Pixinsight it can get a bit more technical."
astrophotography,38lwpq,Gamedude05,1 point,Fri Jun 5 17:18:04 2015 UTC,Any particular reason you are looking at the 7D mk2 instead of something like the 6D? I am in this particular struggle myself right now..leaning towards the 6D but would like to know your opinion.
astrophotography,38lwpq,OrionThePursuer,1 point,Fri Jun 5 17:44:18 2015 UTC,"My gf's father uses an older 7D and I've seen what it can do, the weatherproof feature and toughness of the 7D Mk. II are a plus for me as outside of AP I do a lot of nature photography and not having to be as worried about some water, rain, or other things while hiking with the camera would be nice. Not to mention the lenses I have currently would not fit the full frame sensor of the 6D.   According to what I've read though the 6D should perform better in low light/ high ISO situations so really it's a toss up, I like both."

As long as your mount can take the type of dovetail (it's a vixen style).   Can anyone help me decide what camera/accessories I should be looking at for an Orion Ed80?   Basically you need a field flattener of some sort (a 2""). Hotech makes one, so does Orion. The hotech is the nicer of the two, but they both flatten the field similarly well.  The autoguider you picked out will work fine, I've used that in the past without issue with this scope.    Aiming to capture both planetary and deep sky.   Well you really bought a DSO scope - it won't be amazing for planetary.  Anyway, you should look to get an Atlas mount or at least a sirius. From orion.

astrophotography,38kd62,FlexGunship,2,Sat Jun 6 06:57:24 2015 UTC,"That's probably the same problem as with Registax just with better error reporting.   Your computer doesn't have the correct codec, or the software requires it to be located in a specific folder. Start by downloading the appropriate codec and just leave it in the same folder as your video file.   If this doesn't work, then your camera's battery may have died during imaging and couldn't close the video file properly."

Like, clear night full of stars, nothing. I did manage to focus in on closer stuff during the day, but it seems like the finder scope is off, no matter how carefully I try to align it. Which means I can't polar align it, since I can't see the North Star. After that it's little stuff, like figuring out what speed the motor should be set on. I've read tons of things online, but it's flying right over my head. The actual photography end of it, I understand. Not sure if I should be piggybacking or shooting through the scope, but I imagine trial and error will answer that. Anyway, it's sort of everything that isn't quite working right. Maybe I flubbed something when I first assembled it. The directions and manual weren't that great."

Believe it or noe, but I've had to tell people ""your scope is pointing at the ground"" before, so let's get the stupid small things out of the way.   Where did you get it from?

I used it occasionally for scenery shots but it has kind of low contrast and really focusing on something alive (like birds) is pretty difficult.  It is also rather dark with F/10 and new, it costs quite a bit - about as much as some 6"" to 8"" dobsonians (well, w/o any knowledge on what is still needed on top of that to attach a camera).

But I'm rather intimidated by the choices and cost, from what I've read it's better to spend a bit more to start out and get a motorized mount as well. In my limited experience this seems worthwhile.   And while I would love a telephoto for birding I wouldn't want anything longer then 300mm or so. Maybe even a 70-200mm with the 1.4x teleconverter, but that is an entirely different discussion. I don't find much use for my Novoflex because of the sheer size and weight of the thing."

astrophotography,38d0gh,BuckDunford,4,Thu Jun 4 00:01:05 2015 UTC,"Through the scope, Saturn is much brighter than that image. The reason it is quite dark is because the camera shutter speed is only 1/125 of a second!  I would say that visually, Saturn actually looks much closer the processed image than the single frame.

astrophotography,38hc42,IKLYSP,1 point,Thu Jun 4 05:28:57 2015 UTC,Very nice. In terms of barlow choice it's probably best to start off with a 2x. Seeing is usually nowhere near good enough to be using a 5x unless you live in a particularly nice location.
astrophotography,38hc42,IKLYSP,2,Thu Jun 4 13:29:06 2015 UTC,"good advice, thank you. so the big question now is, 2.5X powermate or 2x barlow? if a barlow, which brand?"

astrophotography,38cjlt,total_zoidberg,2,Wed Jun 3 13:23:49 2015 UTC,"First I'll say the image is beautiful and amazing. At this high magnification, and clearly good quality in the telescope, you're competing with what 20 years ago was the realm of scientists and, and those with a big pocket backing them.  Now on to the camera thing: I'm amazed at the fact that the best setting offered is MJPG, which is an abomination from every perspective (almost). MJPG was invented to easily add ""video"" capabilities to low-end mobile phones ""recycling"" the JPG compression chip/routine you could find it. Usually the quality of each frame is set at the 50% range (for JPG standards), which absolutely horrible, but considering there's motion and how the eyes/brain work most of the block-artifacts are ignored by the brain. What's worse, every frame is compressed independently, so you don't gain anything from a more or less still image (which is the case for more complex video codecs).  The only good thing about MJPG, is that it's extremely simple conceptually and easy to implement, but this is more a cost/implementation ""plus"" than a real feature. If you get the chance, try the same observation with a different camera and see how that goes."

astrophotography,38etck,yawg6669,3,Wed Jun 3 19:12:58 2015 UTC,"Cool Ron, looking good so far.  When you put together the color version, can you note any particular issues/out of the ordinary processing steps associated with the Ha/RGB combine?  I'm working on a ring nebula image with the outer ring in Ha, but when I combine it it just looks wonky.  I'm going to add more time on it in the coming months, when I have a full set of masters I can send them your way if you want to play with them."
astrophotography,38etck,yawg6669,3,Wed Jun 3 20:20:42 2015 UTC,"Will do.  One thing you might try is this.   Make an RGB image and an HaRGB image (both linear -- no stretching) Copy the Ha image, rename it as ""BlendMask"" and apply a moderate stretch.  This will be a blending mask for mixing the RGB and HaRGB together.  Put the BlendMask on the RGB image.  Apply PixelMath to the masked RGB with an expression something like (RGB0.4)+(HaRGB0.6).  You can vary the blend by changing the 0.4 and 0.6.  If they do not add up to 1, check the rescale box.   That way the image will be mostly the original RGB, enhanced with Ha where the Ha-based mask says that is appropriate.  At this point, you can do a colour calibration if needed or deconvolution (or whatever you normally would do next).  Clear skies, Ron"

astrophotography,38etck,dreamsplease,2,Wed Jun 3 21:50:38 2015 UTC,"I reckon the issue yawg is having is that he's trying to pull out extremely faint HA signal (very faint even for HA), and trying to make that make sense in the RGB image. The ""outer ring"" he's referring to is as faint as the ""glow"" of his stars.  It seems like you're trying to get much higher signal HA into your image."
astrophotography,38etck,dreamsplease,3,Wed Jun 3 20:46:23 2015 UTC,"Signal is king.  Always.  Even with 8hr40m exposure, Sh-124's nebulous surroundings are barely there."
astrophotography,38etck,michael1026,1 point,Wed Jun 3 20:52:58 2015 UTC,"Yup. I've found that if you do about 16 hours or so, and do a really good job dithering, rotating between sessions, then drizzle... you can pretty much kill the noise around that point. It takes a long time to beat the noise in the fainter areas of an HA image (and HA is probably the easiest of the narrowbands :-P).  Cool image though, Ron. I might take a crack at this one after the Eagle and Crescent so I can see how I stand up ;)"

I started on the crescent last night (for when the moon sits on the eagle nebula), and I can get about 5-6 (and it's higher up)."

astrophotography,38etck,CNVsCauseASD,1 point,Wed Jun 3 21:32:47 2015 UTC,"I only started doing astrophotography this year and I always see people shooting in different spectrums (if that's the correct word), but what would the difference be had you shot in full color?"
astrophotography,38etck,GMoon777,3,Thu Jun 4 01:09:54 2015 UTC,"Some cameras can shoot in full colour.  They are called ""One-shot colour"" cameras, or OSC.  I use a black and white camera.  To make colour images, I shoot through different filters and then combine them in the computer.  To make ""realistic"" colour images with mono cameras, imagers use filters that let through broad swaths of red, green and blue light, similar to what a OSC camera would allow through, or what your eye would see.  These are called ""broadband"" filters.  The three channels are then combined to make a colour (or RGB) image.  Some people also shoot through a clear filter to get ""luminance"" (brightness) data that they add to the RGB to make an LRGB image.  Another approach is to use ""narrowband"" filters that let through just one or a few wavelengths specific to a particular element, like hydrogen, oxygen or sulfur.   The signal from each filter gets assigned to a colour (red, green or blue) to make a false colour image.  These can be really beautiful, but look very different from broadband RGB images.  One big advantage of narrowband filters is they can be used well even where there is light pollution.  A disadvantage is that long exposure times are needed because the filters let through so little light.  A third approach is to use both narrowband and broadband filters together.  That's what I sometimes do.  I shoot broadband red, green and blue to make the foundation of the colour image, and to get realistic star colours.  I then selectively boost the red channel by blending in signal acquired through an H-alpha filter (hydrogen alpha).  Here's an example:  http://astrodoc.ca/ngc6960-western-veil-nebula-and-pickerings-triangle/  Clear skies, Ron"

astrophotography,38hcde,total_zoidberg,2,Thu Jun 4 22:00:32 2015 UTC,"I would take the photo with you against the background with a very soft light pointed at you (perhaps a strip of low intensity LED lights with one or more strips of white paper covering them), so both you and the background get ""slowly exposed"" against the camera sensor.  If the background was still too faint to show detail, I'd take a couple more pictures without you and with higher ISO and/or exposure time to get the background. Then you can compose all the pictures to get a similar effect to the picture you included.  I imagine this won't be an easy shot to make, so it may take a few tries before you get it right the way you want."
astrophotography,38hcde,Sumrandomr,2,Fri Jun 5 00:40:38 2015 UTC,"More of a question, I guess... but what about using 2nd curtain flash?    It might let you get a longer exposure for the background, and maybe still get you crisp and bright (though maybe a bit fuzzy around the edges depending on how still you can stand...) It's what I'd experiment with if I was trying to get a portrait of someone with a starry night background.    Might not work, of course. Just an idea."

You don't want to get upset after you blow a lot of money down on something and then unfortunately realize it doesn't work with your setup or with what you want to image.   Best advice is to keep posted here, see what people post, ask questions about their setups and see what they can recommend.

astrophotography,387yd0,mrstaypuft,4,Tue Jun 2 14:25:37 2015 UTC,"Annotated image (IC/NGC/PGC/Tycho): http://i.imgur.com/EBI2rDe.jpg    The Draco Trio is composed of 3 galaxies which are on the small side for my 800mm focal length.  NGC5981, 5982, and 5985 (right-to-left in the image) come in at 2.8' x 0.5', 2.6' x 1.9', and 5.5' x 3.0' respectively.  This image represents a pretty healthy crop from the full frame.  This ended up being a really difficult target to image.  After my last image, I thought I was in great shape for flexure, but boy was I wrong.  Probably due to the area of the sky the Draco Trio is in (it was rarely directly overhead), flexing between the guidescope and the OTA was an issue on most of the frames I shot.  I used PixInsight's SubFrameSelector this time around to help reject the bad frames and give higher integration weights to the good ones (detailed in the workflow below), which helped mitigate the effects a little, but smeared detail is smeared detail no matter how you dress it up, and I think some of that crispness is lost for this reason.  In any case, I'm still tickled that these teeny amigos came out as well as they did.  May is a tough month for short focal lengths, and I'm glad I went after a tough set of targets instead of letting the clear nights go by!    This is a really momentous image for me personally, as I post the finished product today exactly 1 year to the day from when I was gifted my first telescope, a 5"" AWB Dob.  About a week after I had the scope, I had my camera on it and have been hooked ever since.  It's been quite a journey over the last 12 months, and I can't believe how much I've learned in such a short amount of time.  Here's the picture book in chronological order of the photos I've taken over the last year.  Hope you enjoy!    If you're interested in trying your hand at processing:   Integrated XISF: Link - 139MB Integrated TIFF: Link - 139MB   Both have been added to my running set of other data in the data donation thread.  Please share your results if you tackle it!    Questions, comments, and criticisms are very welcome.  Thanks for looking!    Image:   Target: NGC5981/5982/5985 - The Draco Trio Light frames: 25 x 900"" @ ISO1600 (6hrs 15min total integration) Dark frames: 9 x 900"" @ ISO1600 (Taken from an incubator at light frame ambient temperature) Flat frames (set 1): 50 x 1/800” @ ISO1600 (using t-shirt and daylight) Flat frames (set 2): 50 x 1/3200"" @ ISO1600 (using t-shirt and daylight) Bias frames: 100 x 1/8000” @ ISO1600 (stored library) Guided with PHD2 guiding   Environmental:   Date: May 18-19 and May 21-22, 2015 Location: White Memorial Wildlife Area, Silex, MO, USA Light pollution: Bortle 5.0(ish) Avg Temperature: Approximately 51F / 10.6C Transparency: Above Average (via ClearDarkSky) Seeing: Poor (via ClearDarkSky)   Main Equipment:   OTA: Orion 8"" astrograph f/3.9, 800mm focal length Mount: Celestron CGEM w/ 17lb and 11lb counterweights Camera: Olympus E-P5 Body, unmodified, micro 4/3 format, 16mp sensor, controlled via remote wireless shutter Guidescope package: Orion ST80 w/ SSAG, 400mm focal length   Accessories:   Coma corrector: Baader MPCC Mark III Off-axis counterweight: ADM DCW-SM side-mount  w/ 3.5lb counterweight.  Aids in balancing when imaging on an OTA with an off-axis focuser/imager. Collimator: Orion LaserMate II Focusing: Bahtinov mask   Integration and Processing:   All in PixInsight 1.8   SubFrameSelector was used to approve and weight frames based on their quality.  The following approval formula was used to separate the good frames from the bad:  FWHMSigma < 1.5  && EccentricitySigma < 1.5 && SNRWeightSigma > -2   A weighting formula was used to add a ""WEIGHT"" FITS header keyword to each approved frame as follows:  1 / (FWHM + Eccentricity)   ImageIntegration was then used with Winsorized Sigma Clipping (3.3. low / 2.5 high) and a weighting mechanism based off of the WEIGHT keyword to produce the integrated frame.  DynamicCrop was applied to remove fringe artifacts from stacking.   RGB: LinearFit was applied to separate color channels using the Blue image as a reference.  DynamicBackgroundExtraction was used with 1.000 tolerance / 3.0 shadow relaxation / .250 smoothing factor and about 250 sample points.  BackgroundNeutralization was applied with a range of .0000-.0035.  ColorCalibration was then used with Target and Background references generated from aggregated previews of the main image.  A HistogramTransformation was applied from a modified ScreenTransferFunction, followed by a CurvesTransformation on the RGB curve only.  SCNR was then applied to remove some Bayer green-cast.  Another CurvesTransformation was applied, this time with the S channel only with a Luminance mask in place to help boost high-signal color.  The ColorSaturation tool was then used with the Luminance mask in place to selectively boost red/yellow/blue.  With a StarMask in place, the CurvesTransformation tool was used to slightly de-saturate the stars.  Finally the ACDNR tool was used to blur, using Lightness w/ a 1.5 StdDev and Chrominance w/ a 6.0 StdDev, both with a LightnessMask in place. L: The saved DynamicBackgroundExtraction process was used.  Deconvolution was applied with a DynamicPSF using 75 stars and 40 iterations of R-L.  A HistogramTransformation was applied from a modified ScreenTransferFunction, followed by a CurvesTransformation (K only) to bring back the background a bit more.  The LocalHistogramEqualization tool was used with a Luminance mask in place to strengthen the high-signal area.  TGVDenoise was used to apply a very light reduction to the major noise areas.  ACDNR Lightness was used with a Lightnessmask in place to protect high signal areas. Combining:  L was applied to RGB using LRGBCombination.  A final CurvesTransformation was applied (RGB/K) to adjust levels slightly to taste.  Lastly, a final crop was applied using the DynamicCrop tool."
astrophotography,387yd0,Idontlikecock,2,Tue Jun 2 14:26:46 2015 UTC,"I really really liked your images of Andromeda and Pleiades, if I'm reading that right, you basically took tons of really short exposures without tracking? As someone without a tracking mount to take really long exposures, I may try this next time the night is clear on Andromeda and see what kind of detail I can get. Thank you for the inspiration :)  Your Draco Trio is great too!"
astrophotography,387yd0,Idontlikecock,1 point,Tue Jun 2 14:49:33 2015 UTC,"Yup, that's exactly right!  The Andromeda photo was simply using my camera/lens/tripod (no telescope).  The Pleiades I tried through my Dob, which has a pretty flimsy helical focuser that caused the sort of egg-shapes present in that one.  The most difficult thing is needing to constantly re-center the image after a short amount of time.  Especially when doing Andromeda without a scope, I was pretty much guessing where I was pointing, and would sometimes need a few test frames to center it properly.  Also -- A remote shutter is extremely helpful if you don't already have one.  This eliminates shake, and also let's you fire off the frames more quickly.  Thanks for your feedback :-)  And good luck!"
astrophotography,387yd0,IKLYSP,1 point,Tue Jun 2 15:15:23 2015 UTC,"It's been suggest I buy a remote, and it would be great for long exposures, but I have a setting that will automatically take x pictures for Y seconds so other than for longer exposures, I don't see the point in getting one just yet."

astrophotography,3893kr,mycatkilledabird,4,Tue Jun 2 18:26:10 2015 UTC,"A little heavy on the blues here for my tastes! I can understand preprocessing the image prior to stacking to remove the lens distortion, DSS is bad for that if you're using an untracked lens with a lot of drift over the course of the session. I don't know whether it's the best approach but I'm not sure of any alternatives."
astrophotography,3893kr,IKLYSP,2,Tue Jun 2 19:28:12 2015 UTC,"Preprocessing to remove lens distortion is a good idea... I used the transform tool on every single picture to remove the distortion (like the idiot I am). Thanks, I'll keep your comment in mind for when I get out to shoot the milky way!"
astrophotography,3893kr,CNVsCauseASD,2,Tue Jun 2 19:35:35 2015 UTC,"Unmodded Pentax K-50 with the Kit-18-55mm.  1 lights shot at ISO 6400, 15s, f/4,5 and 18mm focal length. Why not more? Because the person who drove me out of town got annoyed pretty darn quickly and I had to pack up and go. No darks, no bias, no flats... Not even 40 lights. Here's what I posted back then  Today while deleting stuff from my SD-card I came across these 11 pictures again and thought I might try to get some more out of them...   Instead of removing all the gradients from vignetting, light pollution, atmosphere and zodiacal light in post I got to work with the graduated filters in Camera Raw. Once done with that I loaded the images into a single document in Photoshop and started the allignment process. Manually. You ( u/yawg6669 specifically) might ask why not use DSS?. Well, the kit lens does distort the image a bit and since I didn't even have my manual hinge tracker back then Orion and everything else moved ever so slightly around the frame. Just alligning everything gives you the zoom-like effect that is apparent in the original image. And since DSS does not account for that I had to do it myself. Luckily I had only shot 11 frames...  Once done I converted them all into a smart object and stacked it in median-mode. At least that kinda got rid of the plane saying hello right in the first shot. Didn't really help with the clouds rolling in though. Yay for post processing...  So I did the usual RGB-curves and stuff to sort out the background glow but now comes the cool part. I remembered a video I saw a while back about LRGB-processing. Essentially it's blurring the shit out of one layer and boosting its saturation and using another layer on top for the details. So I blurred the shit out of a highly saturated version and immediately saw barnard's loop, the lambda orionis ring and the rosette nebula which was pretty cool. I then proceded to use the curves again to even out some of the leftover gradients and the clouds. Finally I took my stack and turned the contrast up, so far that only a handful of stars remained. I then blurred the shit out of that layer as well, saturated it and put it on screen mode over the background. Finally I took the stack again, and simply put it as an overlay, giving me stars all over the place again. The rest was just curves, curves, layer masks and curves again to get the most pleasing colour-combination. In the end I got the pic I expected.   No tracking, no full-spectrum modification and certainly not as many pictures to stack as I would've liked but still, there you have it. The first picture I'm truly proud of!  EDIT: Forgot to complain about my shitty kit lens... Can't wait for winter again to shoot Orion with my 50mm f/1.7!"

astrophotography,388mk9,DrBiochemistry,2,Tue Jun 2 16:55:39 2015 UTC,"Can someone explain to be how webcams in worse scopes perform better than DSLRs in good scopes?   Nice acquisition btw,"
astrophotography,388mk9,CNVsCauseASD,2,Wed Jun 3 00:37:53 2015 UTC,"I'm relatively new at this but I think I can field this question.  A webcam shooting a video will often outperform a DSLR doing a series of single exposures in part because there will be a lot more frames to work with from the webcam.  With more frames you can more easily separate the actual signal (light coming from actual features on the object) from the noise (a wide variety of factors that can lead to pixels containing information not related to the actual light coming from actual features on the object).    It's not uncommon to record 8000 or more frames of a planet, then have software reject the ones that are distorted by the atmosphere, then align and stack several thousand of the remaining frames to further increase the signal to noise ratio.  This will generally give you a much cleaner and sharper image than a single frame.  8000 frames is not really practically doable with burst mode on a DSLR, it's only really possible for a DSLR with video capability.  But, even video-capable DSLRS might have a lower maximum framerate than a decent planetary webcam (some can shoot at over 100 fps).  With a higher framerate you can capture more frames in a given amount of time, which again is often an advantage for planetary imaging.    Another thing to consider is that DSLRs have comparatively large sensors, which is pretty much useless for photographing planets, because if you magnified a planet so much that it covered a decent portion of a DSLR sensor, the atmospheric distortion would make the image completely useless.  You can only magnify as much as your telescope, and even more importantly your atmospheric seeing conditions, allow.  Any more does not give you a better image.    So there is no need to have a large sensor--that just gives you a bunch of black space around the planet.  This is another advantage of webcams--they have small sensors that are still easily large enough to cover the entire planet at the highest useful magnification for normal conditions.  Many even allow you to ""crop"" while recording, meaning that you only use the portion of the sensor actually receiving light from the planet.  This makes it possible to have even higher framerates for the videos because it reduces computer and camera processing time while recording."

astrophotography,388mk9,plaidhat1,1 point,Tue Jun 2 16:58:04 2015 UTC,"Hi /u/DrBiochemistry,  Could you say what ISO and shutter speed settings you were using?"
astrophotography,388829,gordito,2,Tue Jun 2 15:31:08 2015 UTC,"Very nice, I especially like the Saturn - it can be difficult to photograph at high latitudes. You could try using Autostakkert 2 instead of PIPP since it centers everything automatically and can do a better job of stacking than Registax."
astrophotography,388829,IKLYSP,2,Tue Jun 2 16:04:35 2015 UTC,Thanks!  For some reason Autostakkert 2 hasn't been accepting the video files outputted by BackyardEOS.  Is there an option in BackyardEOS to change the file format to a compatible version that you know of?  I definitely want to mess around with Autostakkert 2 as soon as it clears up.
astrophotography,388829,IKLYSP,1 point,Tue Jun 2 16:12:39 2015 UTC,I'm not sure about that. BackyardEOS should be saving as a raw video which AS!2 should support.
