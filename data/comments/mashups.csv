mashups,3e1828,isosine,5,Tue Jul 21 04:20:51 2015 UTC,One of my favourite artists (Isosine) posting a mix from another favourite (Bruneaux).   Much love guys <3
mashups,3e1828,ugotamesij,2,Tue Jul 21 14:21:36 2015 UTC,"wow, it just keeps going!"
mashups,3e1828,Xan_the_man,2,Tue Jul 21 12:50:03 2015 UTC,"Awesome. Glad that this finally dropped. I won't know if I really like until about listen 3, but it sounds super promising."
mashups,3e1828,Jeeraph,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:48:38 2015 UTC,I've listened about 4 or 5 times during workouts. You'll like it.
mashups,3e1828,towehaal,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:45:09 2015 UTC,Impressive. edit: 39:50... Brilliant
mashups,3e3kwq,RoboKrabs,2,Tue Jul 21 18:13:22 2015 UTC,Part 2
mashups,3dzg6o,RembrMe,7,Mon Jul 20 19:56:07 2015 UTC,Is this the first one off the new album?
mashups,3dzg6o,Zscore3,5,Mon Jul 20 21:11:54 2015 UTC,We can hope!
mashups,3dzg6o,towehaal,2,Tue Jul 21 01:21:05 2015 UTC,That's what they've said I believe.  5 days of full length tracks from their next album.
mashups,3dzg6o,PaulGriffin,5,Tue Jul 21 16:46:55 2015 UTC,"Man, this gives me hope that good mashups aren't dead. Literally the best mashup i've heard for a year and a half"
mashups,3dzg6o,The-Angry-Baker,0,Tue Jul 21 03:36:17 2015 UTC,"Damn, that's a shame."
mashups,3dzg6o,PossumCheckers,4,Tue Jul 21 09:58:58 2015 UTC,<3 White Panda!
mashups,3dzg6o,ArMaestr0,5,Tue Jul 21 01:38:11 2015 UTC,"My first reaction before listening: Lean On with rap verses and glitching for the chorus? How original. But how'd they do?  Well, color me surprised. The rap is KEYED correctly to the track (take notes, folks). And what's this? Volume and filter automation too (among other things)?  Barring very minor vocal artifacts (and the glitch plus rap verse in the bridge), very well done guys."
mashups,3dzg6o,stel1234,3,Tue Jul 21 06:47:49 2015 UTC,Yep. First Lean On mash to actually do it right.
mashups,3dzg6o,Farisr9k,2,Tue Jul 21 08:39:25 2015 UTC,Beautiful mashup
mashups,3dzg6o,JerkinYourGerkin,2,Mon Jul 20 23:01:15 2015 UTC,Love their stuff. Can't wait for the rest of the releases this week.
mashups,3dzg6o,LukeCJ,2,Tue Jul 21 08:01:49 2015 UTC,So ready for more tracks. I love these guys!
mashups,3e4284,kristen6786,2,Tue Jul 21 20:10:52 2015 UTC,"There's absolutely no problem with requesting mashups - at least so I've seen.  There's a handful out there that have gone unmolested, so it seems like no issue."
mashups,3e4284,NotTimHeidecker,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:28:35 2015 UTC,"Thanks! Exciting news because I get a lot of ideas, but don't know how to execute 'em."
mashups,3dyyon,RoboKrabs,4,Mon Jul 20 17:52:05 2015 UTC,I decided to remake this mashup because there were a few little errors in the original that were bugging the crap out of me. There's already a second Ravioli Remix (Hot Formuoli by Krabby Shmurda) on the channel right now if you want to check it out. I'll be posting it here tomorrow.
mashups,3dyyon,DoubleAgentReviews,4,Mon Jul 20 17:53:46 2015 UTC,"I'm the guy who made the original remix. I can confirm, this is also mine."
mashups,3dyyon,thatloudblondguy,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:15:20 2015 UTC,It seems appropriate that you also have 69 subscribers on youtube
mashups,3e1wp9,PossumCheckers,3,Tue Jul 21 09:16:05 2015 UTC,This is all I wanted and more. Thank you!
mashups,3e1wp9,jshjspr,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:13:06 2015 UTC,"No problem, glad you like it!"
mashups,3e1wp9,GFagandini,3,Tue Jul 21 18:59:00 2015 UTC,Genius
mashups,3e169d,100_Duck-sized_Ducks,2,Tue Jul 21 04:03:34 2015 UTC,"Listening to their album now, might just try to get something out of it..."
mashups,3e169d,NotTimHeidecker,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:22:19 2015 UTC,I think Cold Fingers would work awesome with Childish Gambino.
mashups,3e0w4q,_CreepItReal_,2,Tue Jul 21 02:34:47 2015 UTC,Loved it
