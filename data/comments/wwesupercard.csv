wwesupercard,3e3a3i,DSlushy,10,Tue Jul 21 17:00:32 2015 UTC,https://twitter.com/SuperCard_Game/status/623548002376900608/photo/1  Cena is a pro for me. SV card will pro for a load of people too i assume. Good stuff.
wwesupercard,3e3a3i,WAxlRoseX,5,Tue Jul 21 17:44:42 2015 UTC,"Man, Seth Rollins would make a Pro for me. I've never been able to finish the Survivor card in RTG though. I usually get 10-30 points into it by Sunday night. I'm gonna have to go hard at it. Really hope I can get it. It would be my first Survivor Pro.   If I play all of my games, 5 point games all the way through Legendary, 12 hours a day means 600 points total on Friday and Saturday. That should be enough, no? I have to work Sunday but if I could get some games in on that day too, I think I have a good chance without spending any money."
wwesupercard,3e3a3i,kingchu32,5,Tue Jul 21 18:22:30 2015 UTC,i feel sorry for people who's first pro is one of the weakest cards in the tier..... i want to give you a hug buddy cause.... seth is bad.... like really bad..... and no that's not me mocking you cause i was in the same boat my first survivor pro was dean.... better then seth.... but still a bad card
wwesupercard,3e3a3i,408RG2,2,Tue Jul 21 19:08:15 2015 UTC,"I would have my first sv pro if i got him too. If not, next week ill have a pro rock. I've never been able to finish a survivor card though. If these events were on weekdays i would do so much better. Fridays-Sundays are my busiest days, i hope they consider one sometime. Maybe have people opt out of weekend ones to participate in weekday events to prevent double rewards. Idk, just a thought"
wwesupercard,3e3a3i,Raptor2114,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:11:52 2015 UTC,"I'm basically in the same boat, although I haven't tried for a Survivor since I hit this tier.  I'll push for Undertaker and hope my deck is strong enough now to get Rollins, too."
wwesupercard,3e3a3i,GBeskow,3,Tue Jul 21 18:54:49 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure if i'm happy to see Cena as WM card because i can throw him into the chamber guilt-free or mad because i pulled him 3 days ago and got a pro, i could have pulled any other WM card, perhaps other card for pro."
wwesupercard,3e3a3i,Gonzales95,4,Tue Jul 21 17:58:29 2015 UTC,"ffs, I chambered away my Rollins assuming that as a login reward they wouldn't make him an event reward any time soon :/"

wwesupercard,3e3a3i,Holomua,2,Wed Jul 22 00:00:09 2015 UTC,Im surprised that they made Cena an undercard that'll pro for a ton of people and also SV Seth who was just the login reward. We'll see if  the noobies can get seth in the RTG this week and Pro him right away.
wwesupercard,3e3a3i,mythofdob,2,Tue Jul 21 18:24:03 2015 UTC,SV Seth is the reward so people will spend more in an attempt to get him since it will pro for more people. Gotta make up some money from a weak RD week.
wwesupercard,3e3a3i,SirTebz,2,Tue Jul 21 18:46:44 2015 UTC,Get ready to see mispro'd SV Seth. Someone will do it.
wwesupercard,3e3a3i,ModelMartel,0,Tue Jul 21 20:41:48 2015 UTC,I'm at the point where SVpros don't help me .so if I get a pair I miss pro them for the catalogue. And a missed proed gives the same xp.

Prepare for the coming flood of Rollins Pros!) beating out Rock by a couple of days, since I know I'll have a Pro from the login bonus.  If I could just get some fucking Divas, I could be at WM level by next week!"

wwesupercard,3e3a3i,TM0verlord,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:06:29 2015 UTC,Same here. I'm going to the beach for the weekend. Gotta make as much progress as possible Thursday and Friday
wwesupercard,3e3a3i,DarthKegger,7,Tue Jul 21 17:50:49 2015 UTC,I was right. Lesnar is making Supercard history by being the first person to have won a PCC and have an RtG at the same tier level.  I did a quick look comparing RtG Lesnar/PCC Lesnar/RtG Owens base stats since all 3 are pretty similar.  RtG Lesnar now has the best Power in event cards (beats RtG Owens by 1 point which beats PCC Lesnar).  RtG Lesnar has more Toughness than both RtG Owens and PCC Lesnar  RtG Lesnar and RtG Owens have the same Speed and both lose to PCC Lesnar.  RtG Lesnar has less Charisma than PCC Lesnar while both Lesnars have less Charisma than RtG Owens.
wwesupercard,3e3a3i,TM0verlord,10,Tue Jul 21 17:34:05 2015 UTC,Wrong! Sting had a PCC and was the first ever RTG card  http://imgur.com/5eSydzj
wwesupercard,3e3a3i,DarthKegger,0,Tue Jul 21 20:03:20 2015 UTC,"True, but then again PCC Sting and RtG Sting are under 2 different personas (Crow Sting and Surfer Sting respectively) while PCC and RtG Lesnar are under 1 persona (Brock Lesnar)"
wwesupercard,3e3a3i,robokripp,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:28:44 2015 UTC,That's true...I think the Sting RTG also had Sting as the Survivor Undercard....Im still waiting for the all Cena RTg

wwesupercard,3e3a3i,neoviper89,2,Tue Jul 21 17:12:55 2015 UTC,Yes Undertaker thank God! I need a left arrow pro so bad!
wwesupercard,3e3a3i,MrPopcornbubbles,2,Tue Jul 21 18:49:15 2015 UTC,I Was able to +3 my way to get the first rtg roman last RTG. My deck is much better this time around in mania tier. Trying to see if I can get both Brocks with titles.   Is there a difference in difficulty in first and second rtg card? Your noticings?
wwesupercard,3e3a3i,Duckie1080,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:01:47 2015 UTC,My RTG is halfway through Wrestlemania. For the last RTG I was able to get through the first Roman(albeit by picking out my opponent for the last about 5-10 matches I believe). I had more trouble with the 2nd Roman. Had to do +6's the rest of the way and finished on Saturday. I used 10 dollars worth of title bouts to speed through. Main difference I found was there was a lot more regular Wrestlemania pro's than before; their divas were about the same.
wwesupercard,3e3a3i,TheRockCooker,2,Wed Jul 22 05:44:56 2015 UTC,Guess I gotta bust ass and get Seth. I could use a 2nd survivor pro.

wwesupercard,3e3a3i,GBeskow,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:34:24 2015 UTC,"I really understand what they do, cards are their product and the more famous the guy on the card is the more money they will make. I'd love a Cesaro card, his recent matches were very good but the truth is it won't sell for a big group of players, only to a small group that follows wrestling and watch it every week. Cena and Roman are heroes to a lot of kids and they are the big amount of players and are willing to spend, it's a smart move."
wwesupercard,3e3a3i,JA28,0,Tue Jul 21 18:55:04 2015 UTC,People would pay for crash holly if the stats were good enough
wwesupercard,3e3a3i,lewthelegend,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:56:44 2015 UTC,"Some people would indeed pay but what about those who have no idea who Crash Holly is/was? Not every player on Supercard is a WWE diehard fan, some just watch it casually, i wouldn't pay for a Crash Holly as i have no interest in a wrestler like that, probably a few would think that way too. Also knowing that the card might soon be obsolete would be a factor that could make people not buy it."
wwesupercard,3e3a3i,TwistedEnigma,2,Tue Jul 21 19:04:35 2015 UTC,"You mean you wouldn't pay for a wrestler who weighs in AT WELL OVER 400 POUNDS AND IS A HERO TO THE SUPER HEAVYWEIGHT DIVISION, ALONG WITH HIS SCALE?  Crash was one of my favorite comedic characters back in the Attitude Era. I'd probably spend if he was an RTG main card."
wwesupercard,3e3a3i,poketheturtlesface,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:19:07 2015 UTC,"I have not spent on this game, but if they had someone like a Crash Holly or a Gillberg or someone totally stupid and random like that I would drop some coin to get it. That would be hilarious."
wwesupercard,3e3a3i,TwistedEnigma,-1,Tue Jul 21 21:02:47 2015 UTC,The wma being cena is Fucking stupid... cena was the wm for the Bret rtg are they gonna rotate the same characters every 2 months
wwesupercard,3e3a3i,dxgxnxratx315,-1,Tue Jul 21 18:49:37 2015 UTC,Of course because they are out of ideas obviously
wwesupercard,3e3a3i,ScottySammi,-1,Tue Jul 21 18:54:33 2015 UTC,And I missed the cena because my phone broke the last day of that rtg... there's enough am cards to not have to repeat a reward for at least a year
wwesupercard,3e3a3i,robokripp,-3,Tue Jul 21 19:06:44 2015 UTC,Why? He already has a WM PCC card. Why not someone else?
wwesupercard,3e3a3i,TweetsInCommentsBot,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:23:02 2015 UTC,"Because they're not only trying to sell the game, but the show too, and Brock is a monster right now"

wwesupercard,3e323w,mercyless9,11,Tue Jul 21 16:05:03 2015 UTC,"Just gonna throw it out there.  If you think there is a pattern to ""beat"" the reset board, don't play roulette. You're gonna lose a lot of money"
wwesupercard,3e323w,mythofdob,4,Tue Jul 21 16:27:34 2015 UTC,Like i said its can be beliefs  or superstitions  and tips tricks about all aspects of the game that you might believe. I know for fact that the board resets is random but i wud like try something others follow or believe just for fun. Thats all there is to it.
wwesupercard,3e323w,ibpants,5,Tue Jul 21 16:46:37 2015 UTC,"When doing pulls I take wins from the top left and losses from the bottom right.  It doesn't mean that I pull anything any quicker but it helps me keep an eye on my win:loss ratio and tells me whether my current deck needs work.  A pretty obvious one, but in KOTR I run 6mb (4 men, 2 women).  During qualifying I do a standard 3mb cycling out regularly to keep the stamina up, then during the knockout stages I switch to my best 5.  This way I don't piss away my stamina during qualifying.  In RD I don't fight unless I have to.  If me and my opponent both play our cards without fighting then I win 5-4.  All I'm focusing on is being able to win back any cards I lose so I always start weak and work towards my strongest cards (I often don't have to play my best cards).  Don't be a dick in KOTR chat because it just makes me (and I'm sure others) want to quad boost the fuck out of you."
wwesupercard,3e323w,kingchu32,3,Tue Jul 21 17:38:45 2015 UTC,that's a waste of boosts...... especially since the dicks tend to be weaker players.....
wwesupercard,3e323w,ibpants,2,Tue Jul 21 19:20:36 2015 UTC,"I know, but it's so satisfying."
wwesupercard,3e323w,r0xxon,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:29:20 2015 UTC,Only in the playoffs
wwesupercard,3e323w,408RG2,2,Tue Jul 21 22:53:43 2015 UTC,"Idk, I pull board resets faster from the corners than any other places. I would say as much as 60% of the time my board resets from pulling one of the four corners. However most of those are boosts or rares, my L and up have always been somewhere scattered around the middle. So my strategy is always the four corners, the middle card, then i just tap all over the place until a reset lol."
wwesupercard,3e323w,EdenisGod,2,Tue Jul 21 20:22:02 2015 UTC,Tip - You know time to call it a day when your last 15 resets were KOTR Boosts
wwesupercard,3e323w,kingchu32,3,Tue Jul 21 20:54:57 2015 UTC,never quad boost in kotr if you do the person you quad boosted again will post it in the kotr chat making you public enemy number 1 for that tournament
wwesupercard,3e323w,Liquidpop,2,Tue Jul 21 19:21:18 2015 UTC,"I really do not understand what is so bad about quad boosting, it is a valid strat. What is your take on it"
wwesupercard,3e323w,kingchu32,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:25:56 2015 UTC,you accidentily posted that twice..... anyway i personally don't quad boost unless 1. i've maxed out my boosts early in the tournament or 2. it's nearing the end of the tournament and getting a certain place means i won't have to boost in the quarter finals in witch case using my boosts on another top tier player would be a wise decision
wwesupercard,3e323w,Liquidpop,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:40:48 2015 UTC,Fat fingers on the iphone =D
wwesupercard,3e323w,acer0ckolla,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:06:40 2015 UTC,"I'm with you, I still don't get the problem with quad boosting. It's pointless to do in qualifying, but I've rarely ever seen people NOT do it in the contenders bracket. Every time I win game 1 (without boosting) I've noticed that I get quad boosted in the 2nd and 3rd game.   It's a lot less annoying to me than 3MB or anything of that ilk."
wwesupercard,3e323w,Liquidpop,1 point,Wed Jul 22 04:01:19 2015 UTC,I do agree. It's my decision and you have boosts as well so it's not an unfair advantage. If you don't use them it's not under my control. Although if you promise not to and do then you are just an asshat :(
wwesupercard,3e323w,ModelMartel,1 point,Wed Jul 22 05:35:37 2015 UTC,What is quad boosting ?
wwesupercard,3e323w,Liquidpop,1 point,Wed Jul 22 04:02:43 2015 UTC,In king of the ring using all 4 boosts in a match
wwesupercard,3e323w,dhege0527,1 point,Wed Jul 22 05:34:04 2015 UTC,One more.. During pulls i choose to complete a random line like say the 3rd row and i pull a reset i choose another random line like the 2nd column. Thats just me
wwesupercard,3e323w,GBeskow,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:07:39 2015 UTC,I like to make the four squares in the corners by getting rid of the middle line horizontally and vertically. I seem to be able to get the most cards out of doing my picks this way which helps to get energies for KOTR and cards to train with
wwesupercard,3e323w,Sylly3,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:12:13 2015 UTC,"I also pick rows to clear. If i forgot which row had my last reset, i start with the middle row, if i get a reset in that row i usually move to the 1st or 5th, if i can't get a reset i move to the 2nd if i picked the 1st or 4th if i picked the 5th, the last row i clear is the one that gave me a reset on the last time."
wwesupercard,3e323w,JohnCoster1999_,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:32:28 2015 UTC,"I usually pick the middle card, then the corners, and since they are never there I pick everything else until the very last card"

wwesupercard,3e323w,yeshask,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:13:13 2015 UTC,"When I need an energy card, the upper right and left corners gives me one 74.6% of time. Disclaimer: Percent totally made up. Also, when I'm below 5 energy cards, I'll find the boost before finding an energy card, guaranteed. Usually a KOTR boost when I'm 5/5. Just Supercard things."
wwesupercard,3e3v6c,Jnbracz,3,Tue Jul 21 19:23:23 2015 UTC,"I hit that problem every so often too... I think you have to pro him. That makes him the best card you'd have, right? I think you roll with that"
wwesupercard,3e3v6c,PunkerSXE,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:47:08 2015 UTC,Yeah he would be the same as Rollins. I'm kinda hoping I don't get him so I don't have to pro him and start the fusions again. Gutted about Rollins in the Rtg used him for my most recent sv fusion.
wwesupercard,3e3v6c,408RG2,2,Tue Jul 21 20:06:22 2015 UTC,I would pro if you get him
wwesupercard,3e3v6c,Chad1888,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:23:52 2015 UTC,"Pro it if you get Bray, he'll be handy in the upcoming RTG"
wwesupercard,3e3v6c,robokripp,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:10:55 2015 UTC,im in the camp of going for sv fusion because its a matter of risk vs reward.  lets say you get lucky enough to pro a sv fusion that is going to be a massive boost but at worse case you will have another sv fusion which is only marginally worse than a FPPL.
wwesupercard,3e3v6c,bigken117,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:38:08 2015 UTC,definitely pro him if you get him and get Ryback out of your Ex deck.
wwesupercard,3e3v6c,antoniobourdain,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:31:58 2015 UTC,"@Jnbracz I never ever pro my fusions unless its a pair of the highest tier....for example I was in Leg when fusions first came out but I whacked out SV fusions every time, sacrificing any SV card I had at the time.   By the time WM fusions have rolled out I had 4 Fusion SV pros (Nikki, Dean, Reigns and Bryan - my best cards obv except WM pro Flair) and 2 Fusion singles (Cena and Blassie). This helped to propel me further way faster than I would have been able to if I'd pro'd Leg Fusions as I completely dominated the KotRs I was in for the most part, hence getting 2 SV cards constantly. I was therefore able to fill out my RTG deck in no time at all with SV pros, which lets me win WM cards with ease (I'm f2p so I am able to get the WM card no problem. If I'm free I can push for one of the RTG cards as fusion fodder).  Right now I have 6 cards ready to fuse away not including the above. I was preparing these knowing WM fusions were about to land. I fused my single Cena for my first WM fusion and now my 6 Leg are waiting.   When it comes to fusions, always aim for pros of the highest tier and you'll be dominating before you know it :)"

Fusion AJ, Brie WM and Naomi WM are my others for RtG. Crazy how i pick up so few superstars from the board but i have pulled 5 divas since getting into WM (Eve got chambered)"

wwesupercard,3e4gy8,ghostbuster55,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:28:37 2015 UTC,Might hit the wall early. Just grind +1/+2 when you get stuck.

This is because anything you get out the chamber will have better long term value for you.  Or, alternatively, you can pro him and hold on to your fusion. Then start some new fusions off from common onwards and as soon as you get your next leg card, drop it into the chamber. That way you haven't wasted any time or resources. I don't prefer this method unless the fusion card I have is a pro."
wwesupercard,3e1dth,Tateman,9,Tue Jul 21 05:18:50 2015 UTC,Huh. And here I was thinking that my Wrestlemania pull was gonna come any time now after pulling so many shards... :P
wwesupercard,3e1dth,chokobaby,4,Tue Jul 21 05:37:20 2015 UTC,I can relate. Took away 73 pulls from my tally when I found out.

wwesupercard,3e1dth,red_lantern,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:08:46 2015 UTC,I think the main thing for me is just getting energy and boosts in there. It is hard to be in Kotr and play RD when you need to farm for energies :) Not sure how easy it would be to link the two boards together. I know you said it would be a major update to get energy or boosts in there.
wwesupercard,3e1dth,ferro_man,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:39:31 2015 UTC,"Same with linking the boards, unfortunately. It's on the list!"

wwesupercard,3e3d85,DanTheCheesyMan,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:21:35 2015 UTC,You start after you get a card on your tier. So after you pull a legend
wwesupercard,3e3d85,keepthefaith46,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:41:23 2015 UTC,"But if I pull an Epic card, is that included in my count? will it still take 300 resets no matter what cards come in between?"

wwesupercard,3e2f7s,JONNYBOY0079,3,Tue Jul 21 13:01:21 2015 UTC,It's not that they don't. It's just they're incredibly rare. You pull more WM cards due to the guaranteed pull than you so survivor cards.

wwesupercard,3e24xl,twiztidkilla17,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:18:20 2015 UTC,"I'd keep the Legendary Fusion. A Survivor Fusion will unbalance your deck, as all the survivor Fusions have stats that are at least 600 better in each area than your current best card Rollins. Max out the Legendary Fusion, then get Survivor Rock at the end of the month and you'll have a nice balanced deck. If you get Brie, don't pro her yet. That will unbalance your deck even more, and the two Bries will help you more in RTG than one very good one."

wwesupercard,3dyib9,SluggishJuggernaut,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:12:52 2015 UTC,"Those doublers were probably the difference, because I only got one for of them and I didn't get the Guerrero.

PCC forget about it.. I absolutely HATE it! I can grind for a bit but I'm too busy to sit and play 24/7..

wwesupercard,3dyib9,dynastynyy,22,Mon Jul 20 16:05:22 2015 UTC,you shouldnt need to be a slave to a game to make progress.
wwesupercard,3dyib9,mkay0,-5,Mon Jul 20 16:33:25 2015 UTC,"I don't get this mentality.   You can easily 'make progress' with exhibition, fusion and kotr and never touch the weekend events. But, if you want to get to the elite levels and have the special cards, you need to spend money or seriously grind."
wwesupercard,3dyib9,dynastynyy,4,Mon Jul 20 17:44:23 2015 UTC,"exhibition isnt forcing you to ""alarm clock"" to make sure you get good cards...it's a casual play when you can thing. RD and PCC require you to be a slave to the game in order to get the cards you want. I like my weekends, I don't think I should need to play on a constant basis throughout my weekend to get good cards.   It's essentially doing everything they can to coax people into paying to get their way through these events."

RTG is my favorite mode, I only play PCC to get fusion food. The RD was broken broken first time around, couldn't get Zayne without spending lots of money. Didn't bother second time around because a single zayne is useless to my deck. However I buddy of mine got him by Sunday morning, playing when he could and had to put $6 in because he lost out on 8 hours of playing Saturday evening and didn't want to take the chance of something happening Sunday and him not getting him.  When the next RD comes around, depending on who it is, I will put effort into the game to try and get the card. Until then, I will simply do fusions to pass time, playing sparingly.  To get the best cards in the game, you have to put time or money in. If getting the best cards in the game took little to no effort and could be done in a day (without money) what would be the point? Everyone would have them."

wwesupercard,3dyib9,ibpants,6,Mon Jul 20 16:33:59 2015 UTC,"I'd say it's worth it if only for all the pulls.  You get three picks, and each pick could give you anything from 1 card to 4.  That means one quick game could potentially give you 12 cards.  It's great for training, although your KOTR will suffer a little."
wwesupercard,3dyib9,mkay0,2,Mon Jul 20 17:29:03 2015 UTC,"Agreed. I got Eddie and Rick Rude, but the volume of pulls made it worthwhile on its own."

Truth is, this is an expensive game mode, from what i see most people spent $10-$15 for a single card this time, plus the previous RD another $10-$15, around $30 for a pro card is way too much for me, not to mention that it will be useless once a new tier is released and when people start to get multiple WM Fusions Pro."

wwesupercard,3dyib9,chasingbreakers,2,Mon Jul 20 16:41:47 2015 UTC,"I managed to get through Rick Rude and Andre, and get a couple pieces on Sami (I mostly just wanted to see if I'd get a random WM or SV pull). For context, I only got a SV Miz last week -- and just barely  I bought one pack of doublers (just the 12 pack for 100 credits, as I did last week) to ensure I got through Andre, but in retrospect, I probably could have gotten by without them.  I still am very mixed about this mode. It takes a LONG TIME -- I played as many bouts as I ever have in one of these modes, but I got the rewards I was after. Not sure I could do it on a regular basis, but glad to have my deck in better shape for the upcoming RTG."

I wasn't playing obsessively, but I played a good amount on Thursday night, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, and I didn't even make it through my first card. The tier-below/your-tier/tier-above thing is getting really demoralizing—I can't even reliably try to get something to use for fusions.  Maybe if they moved to having three different shard maps, so the tier-below card goes quicker and the tier-above/event-reward tier takes longer. 25/36/47?  I mean, I'd prefer either 2 pulls for a loss and 4 for a win, the AI to stop playing like they know what cards you have in reserve, or more even-handed matchmaking, but I'm not expecting any of those to change."
wwesupercard,3dyib9,7tenths,2,Mon Jul 20 19:16:11 2015 UTC,3 of my first 6 shards i got on the exact last piece. Needless to say i quit on Friday. I would have at least spent some more time on it but since i can't even get energy cards it's a complete and total waste of time.
wwesupercard,3dyib9,Sicmay,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:59:45 2015 UTC,I've had the same terrible luck as you. I fully cleared at least 3 boards and pulled the correct shard on the last piece. That kind of time commitment to reveal a tiny sliver of a single card is so demoralizing that I didn't even wanna bother for the rest of the event.
wwesupercard,3dyib9,chiller2484,2,Mon Jul 20 20:45:40 2015 UTC,I did the maths on the event. you need to play a ridiculous amount for even one card as a free player: https://www.reddit.com/r/wwesupercard/comments/3d8jz8/official_ring_domination_discussion_sami_zayn/ct3lcit  /u/bmuscles tried to tell me that every player is able to get all 3 cards (of course staying awake 24hrs and winning every game)- but again some simple maths proves thats not true:  https://www.reddit.com/r/wwesupercard/comments/3d8jz8/official_ring_domination_discussion_sami_zayn/ct9y923

I had no expectation or goal of actually getting rewards from this.  I""m pretty much only playing RTG from here out, at least with any degree of seriousness."
wwesupercard,3dyib9,NevilleLB,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:09:23 2015 UTC,"Got ten shards into Andre before I timed out. That's two events in WM+ where I've walked away with Survivors. Definitely an event for paying customers. Not even worth the money, I've come up against two pro Sami's and I've wiped them both out with my RTG pro's."
wwesupercard,3dyib9,Tateman,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:56:57 2015 UTC,I'm not really sure what I'm doing differently than everyone struggling. I finished last time with 3 hours to spare and this time I finished on Saturday around noon... so about 33 hours to spare. Both times I spent $5.
wwesupercard,3dyib9,ghostbuster55,2,Mon Jul 20 17:59:46 2015 UTC,"I would say luck, or less sleep? :)  I still get lots of pulls coming down close to the end of the shards before a reset."
wwesupercard,3dyib9,Shwoor,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:25:33 2015 UTC,"Had to use some credits for board resets, and about 24 double pulls, but I was able to get Eddie and Rude with about an hour to spare."
wwesupercard,3dyib9,boomincali,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:18:24 2015 UTC,"I'm in Survivor+ and I only managed Eddie and a few shards into Rick Rude.  I was thinking that on a normal PCC I only get enough points for the Epic pair, but with the KOTR energy pulls I always have one running and am pretty much guaranteed 1 or 2 survivor cards from KOTR.    I am actually enjoying the RD game, but find it a chore and will do until KOTR energy and boosts are introduced and the board resets count."
wwesupercard,3dyib9,hermanfong2703,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:35:38 2015 UTC,At first I thought that upping the shard reward by one would make this a doable game mode for me but  it's just as hard considering the first RD had an extra day to get the reward and it was still almost impossible for free players.
wwesupercard,3dyib9,ferro_man,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:17:25 2015 UTC,"Dont give up on RD, the beginning does not look good but after 10-11 shards, you are already in halfway for that board.   Personally for me, I think that RD is more rewarding than RtG, I managed to get Wrestlemania with around 14hrs to spare in this RD. For RtG, I have not been able to even get near the Wrestlemania."
wwesupercard,3dyib9,r0xxon,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:26:33 2015 UTC,"I didn't really get to play that often because I spent the weekend at Pitchfork Music festival, but i still had enough time to get Eddie on Saturday night with only using 100 credits on him (and i only spent them because i was worried about not having enough time to get him). I like RD way more than PCC."
wwesupercard,3dyib9,r0xxon,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:56:31 2015 UTC,"With the amount of games you played, you would have made it to about Ultra Rare in RTG?  You're complaining about no rewards when you put in a very casual amount of time.  That's not RD's fault"
wwesupercard,3dyib9,corduroyburns,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:00:58 2015 UTC,"I routinely finish the Legendary card and get about halfway through the Survivor in RtG playing at the same pace without spending any money. Face it, the rewards for this game mode do not match the time commitment required to get them."

wwesupercard,3dyib9,chokobaby,0,Tue Jul 21 22:39:53 2015 UTC,"got all 3 top cards with doublers, a 156 pack and 35 from a 75 pack with 8 refill bouts to finish and pro zayn early friday evening. Would have been earlier, but had cable outage for several hours. Saturday night I lowerd my deck, and used up the rest of my doublers and got eddie with an hour left. Played only half the bouts that I could for him, if I got him I got him, if not it's only fusion food anyway. Got around 18 pulls off of him with remaining doublers, and finished rest for free. My win lost record lowering my deck was maybe 65 percent at best, no wheres near my rate with better deck, but yet even without getting maximum bang from doublers due to mediocre win lost, and even though finishing it up halfway through without doublers, it was the easiest card to get, the shard rate hits on it were like 2 thirds faster than on the higher cards, unreal easy on this card. And the sami pro indeed blows. Horrible combo speed and charisma, any combo of power or toughness with one of his combo attributes would've been better. Just like Roman not great in anything.Makes Roman card seem Brettish, that's how much this card sucks."
wwesupercard,3dyib9,corduroyburns,-3,Mon Jul 20 20:28:08 2015 UTC,You people need to stfu it s a great mode yes they could reduce the number of shards to get the card but 9ther than then that its fine. I was able to get both  event cards without spending money. Please stop bitchING and use the game for what it was made to do have fucking fun  not to bitch on the Internet because the game isn't easy enough for you ass holes.
wwesupercard,3dyib9,niknaks_2050,2,Tue Jul 21 02:59:29 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry, but I find it incredibly hard to believe that you were able to get that first Sami Zayn card without spending any money. We only got 2 picks per win in that event, so to have been able to get that card without spending, you would have had to have been extremely lucky with your shard pulls. And I haven't seen a single free-to-play player report being able to get that first Sami. So either you had miraculous luck in the first RD event, or you're talking bullshit."
wwesupercard,3dyib9,corduroyburns,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:38:25 2015 UTC,"lol, i over looked he got both event cards of sami free, the first one no way in hell for free, but 2nd sami event with shard increase i can believe. I take my70's applause back"

wwesupercard,3dzdy1,mrdanknich,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:52:04 2015 UTC,Grats your way on your progress as well! L KOTR has helped me greatly on pairing the L pros I have now.

I will be getting my 2nd L HBK tonight, so that will allow me to get that to Pro and I have another Epic Fusion coming in a few days. I may even be able to make it all the way through Survivor, which is a far cry from when I couldn't even make it through Epic."

Horrible luck in the fusion chamber and getting wasted in SV KOTRs can do that to you. I still have a single legendary Diva though."

wwesupercard,3dzqnv,doctornick72,2,Tue Jul 21 06:35:33 2015 UTC,I did seem like it more often then not but it could just be the fact your looking for it to work there's definitely no special programming to give hints to where it is
wwesupercard,3dzqnv,Vannostrum,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:24:45 2015 UTC,"It has been talked about before. I tried it out this time around and it didn't seem to yield any good results. It's cool that it works for some people though.   This likely is just coincidence but I have another method that I need to try next time. Pick shards that won't reveal who the card is first. For time both Rick and Andre, the first shard was a small piece of their name but no where near enough to know who based off of what I got.  Second shard was both in their stats area. Third both around their level meter. It might be nothing but you never know. Need more data to actually call it anything."
wwesupercard,3dzqnv,nmt96,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:02:15 2015 UTC,I noticed the name area as my first piece on Rude and Andre. Wasnt the same for Sami though.
wwesupercard,3dzqnv,mycattalkstome,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:45:50 2015 UTC,Not for me. First bit of rude was his face
wwesupercard,3dzqnv,yeshask,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:35:23 2015 UTC,"While i might be wrong, I also noticed that shards appearing kept cycling in different quadrants. If you see the map, you can clearly see four different quadrants. I could always pinpoint the quadrant to concentrate on after two or three shards got revealed. This helped me speed up given that I did most of the work on Saturday and Sunday and I had almost given up on Rick Rude but this strategy got me out of the woods."
wwesupercard,3dzqnv,justbriman,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:31:54 2015 UTC,"I tried the ""quadrants"" thing too...  but for me, this did not work.  In fact, I had one of the top 2 quadrants nearly empty before the bottom left quadrant had even one shard removed...  Unfortunately, I think the shard picks are ""number based"" -- ie you're randomly ""assigned"" a number for which that pick will be a shard, regardless of where the pick comes... so if you've been ""assigned"" pick 24, it's going to take 24 picks to get the shard, and it doesn't matter which shard you pick as the 24th... just conjecture, no proof though..."
wwesupercard,3dzld3,edf4386,3,Mon Jul 20 20:32:02 2015 UTC,As a free player you'd have had to have played and won every game for 52 hours... (and thats ignoring the impact of the pick doublers)
wwesupercard,3dzld3,Sicmay,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:41:48 2015 UTC,That's why i hate this event lol. I managed to get Eddie
wwesupercard,3dzld3,408RG2,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:11:33 2015 UTC,380+356+261=997/3=332.333=83.08  actually its worse you have to win every game for 83 hours for a 90 hour event.
wwesupercard,3dzld3,robokripp,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:58:06 2015 UTC,Why are you adding cards pulled instead of bouts played. Are you confusing cars with shards?   But neither our calculations include the impact of pick doublers that would pretty much half the tiem if he used them on every game.
wwesupercard,3dzld3,Sicmay,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:21:45 2015 UTC,"yah i thought it was shard pulls.  (76+82+58-5)/4=52.75  228,246,174 shards per card this seems awfully low and lucky, actually since the bouts are so low its probably a very high number of title bouts especially during sami"
wwesupercard,3dzld3,robokripp,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:40:58 2015 UTC,He spent 1500 on doublers - not sure how many doublers that gets you
wwesupercard,3dzld3,Sicmay,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:22:23 2015 UTC,10 credits for 1 title match  100 credits for 12 title matches  600 credits for 75 title matches  1200 credits for 156 title matches  156+12+12+12= 192 possibly.
wwesupercard,3dxfvm,mycattalkstome,6,Mon Jul 20 09:43:50 2015 UTC,"I would love to see more data like this concerning RD. I did not play this week's RD since I barely got my first card last time with playing as much as I could.  With these numbers, I ran a quick calculation.  SV 366 pulls. Assuming 100% win rate, you would need 122 bouts to reach 366 pulls at 3 pulls per win. At a rate of 4 bouts per hour (1 bout every 15 min), you would need 30.5 hours to free play the first card.  WM 367 pulls; 30.6 hours.  SZ (event card) 361 pulls; 30.1 hours.  This is a total of 91.2 hours during a 96-hour event for a free player.  TL;DR: A free player needs approx. 30 hours per card. The event is only completable by free players if the player spends hardly anytime sleeping in 4 days.  P.S. This is not a statement of whether free players should even be able to get an event card vs paying players. This is just a statement of the numbers for realization that it is nearly impossible, and no where near practical, for a free player to get all three cards."
wwesupercard,3dxfvm,Derkaberzerk,5,Mon Jul 20 12:10:38 2015 UTC,"Ok, Let's compare that to RTG. And assume the person can win +5s the whole way. You need 1380 points when you add up all the points needed to win every level of RTG. 1380/5 = 276 bouts => 69 hours. So even with the change from 2->3 RD is too time heavy in comparison to RTG.  Especially when you consider that in RTG you'd win a WM RTG Pro and not just a single. To win just a single WM RTG Event card in RTG you need 1180 points, 236 bouts, 59 hours.   Coupled with the lack of KOTR power-ups there remains no value in RD."
wwesupercard,3dxfvm,meanstreetposse,2,Mon Jul 20 12:45:21 2015 UTC,Agreed. I won't be playing Rd from now on

wwesupercard,3dxfvm,jdauntouchable,2,Mon Jul 20 13:03:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm not regretting my decision to sit this one out as soon as I found out they only bumped up the picks to 3 instead of lowering the number of total shards."

wwesupercard,3dxfvm,Bill_Money,2,Mon Jul 20 13:03:26 2015 UTC,Yeah. I came to e same conclusion. I had a 95% win rate and bought pick doublers
wwesupercard,3dxfvm,wwehistorian,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:29:18 2015 UTC,"That's crazy. I also had about a 95% win rate more or less and it took me a long, long time to get my first one. The legendary Eddie for some reason felt like it was shorter, but it took me till about the last 2 and a half hrs before the RD event was over."
wwesupercard,3dxfvm,robokripp,2,Mon Jul 20 13:19:03 2015 UTC,Well then..... Sure have missed Rtg! Thx god it's this weekend.
wwesupercard,3dxfvm,kingchu32,3,Mon Jul 20 14:09:31 2015 UTC,"the shard pulls are bullshit on the Leg Eddie. which I didn't even finish all I pulled were C, UC, R, 2 SR, & 1 UR It felt like every time it took me to the last 5 shard to pull a reset. No double shard pull special cards either. Its sad cause I really like the gameplay of RD  but feel like its a waste of time & I'd be better off grinding exhibition pulls"
wwesupercard,3dxfvm,Fan48,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:07:00 2015 UTC,"I also kept track (of total shards) from last time and this time.  My numbers were as follows: RD1... SV - 301, WM - 312, Sami Zayn - 316 RD2... SV - 317, WM - 247, Sami Zayn - 288 I had better luck this time. In both events, I dropped down to get legendary also just to level cards. This event is AMAZING for leveling cards."
wwesupercard,3dxfvm,kingchu32,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:33:41 2015 UTC,You had a better pull rate than me. I now have a dozen ultra rare cards which are training banks. I also manages to pro my andre wm card and the zany.  I also got the legendary but did not keep track
wwesupercard,3dxfvm,The_Miz_Is_Awesome24,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:28:49 2015 UTC,I could only estimate. I won probably about 95% of matches. I got andre with about 20 hrs left.   Slept probably 7hrs per day so ~14 hrs.  90-20-14 = 56 of real play time. 56x4x(3(.95)+1(.05))=649.6/2  this puts me at 324.8 shards per card. I think 300-360 shards per card is a typical range.
