StandUpComedy,3e3ou4,gage69,6,Tue Jul 21 18:40:20 2015 UTC,I don't see Stanhope on the bill so the title is debatable.  Looks like a good lineup though
StandUpComedy,3e3ou4,BannaHamHock,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:12:04 2015 UTC,"If you know Arizona, this is really an amazing lineup, and all performing at The Lost Leaf... going for sure!"
StandUpComedy,3e0msg,madest,7,Tue Jul 21 01:18:14 2015 UTC,Love his standup. His Race Wars podcast is very entertaining as well
StandUpComedy,3e0msg,SpottyJ,4,Tue Jul 21 03:10:03 2015 UTC,"Kurt is my favorite comedian right now, right up there with Dave Attell and the other bests."
StandUpComedy,3e0msg,Clibanarius,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:59:06 2015 UTC,"Kurt reminds me a lot of Patrice, moreso than Attell. He has a similar style as Attell, but the jokes are all taboo social commentary which tackle different subjects than Patrice did, but he does it in the same tough love kind of way."
StandUpComedy,3e0msg,The_Adventurist,3,Tue Jul 21 19:05:34 2015 UTC,"Just recently bought his CC special White Precious after seeing a few of his clips linked here, and now I have a new favorite comedian. His bit about God watching our assholes had me in tears."
StandUpComedy,3e0msg,hatteshizzle,4,Tue Jul 21 05:48:43 2015 UTC,I think Kurt usually has a really interesting perspective when it comes to religion. He grew up as a Jehovah's Witness.
StandUpComedy,3e0msg,I3lizzard,3,Tue Jul 21 05:53:22 2015 UTC,I keep seeing clips from this special in this sub. Is it on Netflix or something?
StandUpComedy,3e0msg,promonk,3,Tue Jul 21 02:12:56 2015 UTC,"It's a Comedy Central special so you won't see it on Netflix. It is, however, available for $5 on Comedy Central Direct."
StandUpComedy,3e0msg,Fehndrix,4,Tue Jul 21 04:58:36 2015 UTC,"Totally worth the price, too, imo."
StandUpComedy,3e0msg,hatteshizzle,4,Tue Jul 21 05:46:42 2015 UTC,the best price is 2.99 at amazon
StandUpComedy,3e0msg,I3lizzard,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:48:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah, for a rental."
StandUpComedy,3e0msg,Fehndrix,2,Tue Jul 21 15:56:38 2015 UTC,https://youtube.com/watch?v=6DKr57lQp78  It's a shame I never heard of this guy till tonight.  A condensed version of his Comedy Central special is posted above-- I can't recommend it enough!
StandUpComedy,3e0msg,timidnoob,2,Tue Jul 21 05:43:15 2015 UTC,definitely one of my favorites. you should listen to race wars it's fucking hilarious.
StandUpComedy,3e0msg,I3lizzard,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:50:18 2015 UTC,Does he have a website?  I'm trying to find his tour schedule and this is all I could find   http://www.laughstub.com/comedians/Kurt-Metzger
StandUpComedy,3e0msg,kcsquared,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:22:27 2015 UTC,I never heard of the guy until yesterday. Was checking r/standupcomedy and he was in the side pane on youtube. He's got a lot of good bits and I like his conversational style. I hope to see more of him.
StandUpComedy,3e0msg,kcsquared,2,Tue Jul 21 13:26:50 2015 UTC,Give his Marc Maron interview a listen.  He's got some great stories about growing up as a Jehovas and getting into arguments with feminists.    Here's a good short interview with Kurt about rape jokes  Supposedly the same feminist bloggers who have shamed him have gone on to praise his jokes because they were not aware that he writes for Schumer's show.
StandUpComedy,3e0msg,The_Adventurist,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:35:06 2015 UTC,"Facebook is his website, but fair warning he uses it daily and often for rants.  Basically if you're his friend on facebook, he just tries new material on you all day."

StandUpComedy,3dx203,peteraitch,12,Mon Jul 20 14:09:14 2015 UTC,It's also on Netflix if anyone wants to watch it with better quality and no ads. He also has a podcast with his wife if anyone's interested.
StandUpComedy,3dx203,DrunkleDick,4,Mon Jul 20 17:30:27 2015 UTC,"This is the first I've heard of him, loving it so far thanks for the heads up on netflix."
StandUpComedy,3dx203,-3-,6,Tue Jul 21 00:38:41 2015 UTC,Man that's cricket!! He's so spot on with that show

StandUpComedy,3dx203,1percentof1,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:41:21 2015 UTC,I heard his medical marijuana bit on the Pandora comedy station and immediately looked him up. This has become one of my favorite specials in recent memory.
StandUpComedy,3dx203,archaelleon,4,Tue Jul 21 03:16:49 2015 UTC,That was great. Must look for more of his stuff.

StandUpComedy,3e1bwe,JuiceBusters,0,Tue Jul 21 04:58:36 2015 UTC,"In fact, my grandfather was a WW2 Vet and it does seem to that age group a 'War Hero' was actually (as Rock says) the motherfucker who got away! Someone who won big 'above and beyond duty'.   Which was in NO WAY intended to diminish, disrespect or belittle PoWs. It was simply they had a term for a big winner who succeeded hugely sorta thing.  BTW: Is there a new term for the 'Guy who got away' meaning do we have a term for a soldier who just owned the fuck out of the enemy and won big (as in won extraordinary fights, beat them, killed the most, etc)??"

StandUpComedy,3dzmj2,Slippery_Slope_Guy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:08:26 2015 UTC,"He's not the ""best comedian legend"" BUT if all his work was on par with his 2006 dvd release ""Joe Rogan: Live"" (which is back on Netflix!) then in my eyes he would be legendary. His 2006 release is some of the only standup material of his that i likeâ€¦but i LOVE it! it's become one of my favorite specials. So much energy."
