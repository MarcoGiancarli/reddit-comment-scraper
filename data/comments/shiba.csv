shiba,3dz82x,crispette,4,Mon Jul 20 20:35:43 2015 UTC,"Actually she isn't considered a sesame. She is considered a improperly marked black and tan because there is no actual blending of the red and black coat.  Some people call it a red headed black and tan. It is a common misconception.  I am just copying and pasting my sesame info I did on my FB page because that will be easier.  In order for it to be a true sesame, the shiba must have the following   Red base coat with black overlay No concentration of black anywhere. The black overlay must be a even blending Cannot have a black mask Cannot be darker than 50% black and must have a good red base coat Pattern must be similar to a black and tan, but the black areas are replaced with the black tip overlay   There is an exception to the pattern for a sesame. Sometimes the pattern can end on the forehead creating a widow's peak leaving the bridge of the muzzle red.  Some refer the sesame coat color as ""sable"" but it isn't used as a shiba standard definition because it isn't entirely correct for shibas. AKC's Complete Dog Book defines sable as ""A coat color produced by black-tipped hairs upon a background of silver, gold, gray, fawn, or brown."" By this definition, all sesame Shibas are sables, however not all sables are sesames. A sesame is a sable in which the black tipped areas must follow a SPECIFIC PATTERN in order to be called a sesame.  What isn't a sesame shiba   A red shiba with a black back and/or black tail A shiba that has similar black and tan markings but is really dark A dark red shiba with concentrations of black throughout their body A reddish shiba with more black and a black mask.   Sesame's are actually quite rare with many claiming to be a sesame isn't a true sesame because of the lack of proper pattern or color blending. You probably have never come across a proper sesame shiba.  Shibas also do not use the term ""red sesame"". There is no distinction for sesame coloring since it should all follow a specific pattern with the exception on the face. Shikoku Ken is the only Japanese breed that uses ""red sesame"" as a grade of sesame coloring which refers to a primarily red dog with few black hairs.  Info on Sesames from the National Shiba Club of America http://shibas.org/newstand/sesame.html"
shiba,3dz82x,crispette,3,Mon Jul 20 21:46:42 2015 UTC,"It looks like your dog is a black and tan with 2 color faults (that I can see, in these pictures). The first is a modifier known as ""creeping tan"" and the second is that the black hairs where they do exist are actually too solid (which is bananas, but thems the breaks).  I don't know why the AKC calls this a sesame, but I've heard it erroneously referred to as sesame by many people. It isn't. It's caused by the same genes, but different modifiers, as the black and tan coat. It's often called a ""red headed"" black & tan. It's a fault in the coat color. A lot of the time, you'll see a ""red headed"" black & tan that has more black on their body, but this is still a variation of that coat color.  What makes the difference is how the black hair is distributed. A sesame should be intermittently banded with black and red/cream (this is caused by 'AY' or 'aw' on the A locus). A black and tan has a more uniform appearance and gives either the ""tan point"" or ""saddle"" patterned appearance (caused by 'at' on the A locus).  My Kishu Ken, Nami, is an ""inccorectly marked sesame"". This pattern transcends the breed barriers. A Shiba Inu marked like Nami would also be an incorrectly marked sesame. See how her coat is kind of peppered with black hairs? That's the difference.   The reason she is incorrectly marked is because a correctly marked sesame should be well-blended in their distribution of black-banded hairs and not ""patchy"" like Nami is (where you can see patches of just-red coat). She's also got a black mask, which is another color fault, but whatever. She wasn't picked for her coat color. :)  TK, my Shikoku Ken, is an example of a ""correctly marked"" sesame. See how well-blended his coat is, but it's still very grizzled - no place is solidly black. This type of sesame is relatively uncommon in Shiba Inu, but it occurs in some lines in France, the UK, the USA, and Japan (that I have seen). (Interestingly, TK also has a minor color fault - the white stripe on his nose and tail tip is usually selected against in the Japanese breeds.)  You can see the differences a little better when they're together. The distribution of black hairs is absent from the back of Nami's neck and her face. Essentially, she has the same fault as your dog - ""creeping tan"", it's called, in some western breeds, but is a true sesame.  This dog is a properly marked black and tan (called ""black"" in the Japanese standard). You can see a little bit of the undercoat in this dog and how it's a different color - that's desirable (per the NIPPO standard, IIRC). Being ""too uniformly black"" can actually be a fault. Apparently, a correctly marked black and tan is really difficult to breed and show - at least, it is in the Shikoku Ken. I assume the same is true of Shiba Inu, since they have the same possible alleles and color variations."

The rule is that you should be able to stick 2 fingers underneath the collar.  Remember that puppies aren't that strong so an xs collar shouldn't snap on them.  I would suggest getting a harness as well since shibas are prone to slipping collars easily."
shiba,3dym3a,jwallwalrus26,2,Mon Jul 20 18:20:06 2015 UTC,"I got a $2 mesh/nylon collar from Walmart the day we picked up Momo.

Momo is 7mo now and I purchased a 1"" wide, 14"" long custom collar from Frenchie (Etsy store) that should last her a very long time."

Even XS dog collars were too big!   That said, you can try buying a couple sizes and just returning the one you don't use, or try bringing her in to the store to try on collars after you get her - Just don't let her touch the floor of the pet shop without one or two rounds of vaccines in her first!  I also highly recommend Puppia Harnesses they're inexpensive, comfortable, and very stylish. For a young pup you'll want the XS size, more than likely."

shiba,3dx9o2,CanadianGGG,4,Mon Jul 20 08:10:11 2015 UTC,"She is also resource guarding. You should look up how to train against RESOURCE GUARDING.  Dogs NEVER bite or react for NO REASON. Something IS setting her off. Consult a behaviorist, get a professional who works with POSITIVE TRAINING METHODS preferably experience with primitive breeds such huskies.  Also with the biting issue and with a child, you can ask for all the advice you'd like online but HIRE A BEHAVIORIST!!! A good trainer DOESN'T NEED YOU TO REPLICATE IT. My shiba has aggression issues towards specific dogs and we just train around those types of dogs. She hasn't tried to attack them, but the trainer helps desensitize her. Look into styles like BAT (which is what I do). http://empoweredanimals.com/  DO NOT USE CESAR MILAN TECHNIQUES!!! Time and time again this has 1. Been completely based off of scientifically INACCURATE information about wolves. and 2. Has been known to not work well at all with primitive breeds, especially shibas. It actually has a high probability of making the issues EXTREMELY WORSE. Just spend some time google the negative things about that style of training and why he is wrong and you will get hundreds upon hundreds of websites from other trainers, vets, human societies, ASPCA, breeders, biologists etc all saying why he is doing more harm than good to the dog community. Just because he is on TV does NOT mean it is a good thing or that he is right. Also his videos explicitly state to ""NOT TRY THESE TECHNIQUES AT HOME without under the guidance of a trained professional"". So you shouldn't be trying to do what he is doing. You should be listening to a real trainer and not a TV show. It's definitely hard to not try. I've done it before in the past.  Alpha rolling, dominance, etc can make your shiba MORE aggressive. Look into positive training methods where you build a partnership with your dog versus trying to control and dominate it. Also training needs to be consistent and don't expect that you can solve these issues even in a month.  Lastly, and it is sad to say, with a child in the mixture, you might need to consider rehoming your dog. There are plenty of shiba specific rescues who deal with these behavioral issues and it is always better for the dog to be placed with people who are experienced with shibas and NOT in a shelter. Especially with her biting issues. It's not fair to you to deal with this and it isn't fair to the dog.  If you feel you need to rehome, please reach out to me. I have a network of people and contacts that deal in rehoming shibas and dealing with aggression issues. If you put her in a shelter, she more or less likely WILL be euthanized for the biting."
shiba,3dx9o2,jwallwalrus26,2,Mon Jul 20 15:08:48 2015 UTC,"You want to spay her, she is right about at sexual maturity.  I have had 3 neutered Shibas in the family and though all of them had hoarding tendencies none of them had issues with biting except occasional nipping when painfully grabbed.  ""Irritability Each estrus cycle causes significant hormonal changes in a female dog. Some dogs become irritable or nervous and even feel pain due to ovulation. Because spayed dogs don’t experience these hormonal changes, a female dog’s behavior may be more consistent after she’s spayed.  Aggression Females may be less aggressive toward both dogs and people after they’re spayed. Unspayed females sometimes compete for the attention of a male dog by fighting. Spaying can reduce or eliminate this fighting. Spaying your dog can also eliminate the possibility of hormonally driven guarding behavior. Female dogs will sometimes behave aggressively if people or other pets attempt to approach or touch their puppies. Some dogs who don’t get pregnant during a heat cycle will experience a “false pregnancy” or “pseudopregnancy.” Females in false pregnancy often “adopt” objects and treat them like a litter. These females may guard the adopted objects as if they were real puppies. To prevent the development of the behaviors listed above, it’s best to spay your dog before she reaches sexual maturity at six to 12 months of age. That way, she’s unlikely to develop unwanted habits associated with her heat. If your dog has practiced these habits for months or years, they might persist even after spaying. However, if you have an older dog, it’s still worth it to spay her. Even if you can’t completely get rid of her problematic behaviors, you might see them less often after she’s spayed—and spaying will still be beneficial to her physical health.""  My guess would be hormonal issues, plus lack of ""social skills"" that come from play-fighting with other dogs that would teach her that biting is not OK. It may be a little too late to totally stop this behavior just by spaying though."
shiba,3dx9o2,rickfromrickandmorty,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:00:46 2015 UTC,"This.  We were told by the vet to wait till she's at least 6 months to old spay her, then right at 6 months she had her first woman time, a couple weeks later was her first aggressive episode.  She's spayed now but I worry we've already let those hormones in the mix."
shiba,3dvtmk,JSCuadros,3,Sun Jul 19 23:17:48 2015 UTC,"Banfield had too many negative reviews for me to feel comfortable to use them, that being said, 2 of my friends have been using them for their dogs for years and are super happy. Seems to be location based for good or bad.  I use Trupanion which isn't going to give you all the perks Banfield does for regular visits etc, however the one thing Trupanion has that most insurances don't is that conditions and treatments are not refreshed every month. What this means is that say Taro gets cancer while she is already insured (so not pre-existing). She gets treatment that first month and I cover the $200 deductible and the 10% that isn't covered on the insurance and they pay the rest. Here comes the next month and we have continuing treatments. Since it is for the same condition, the insurance doesn't start over. I don't have to pay the deductible, just the 10% that isn't covered and this continues for the rest of her life as long as we are on their insurance.  A lot of other insurances don't allow conditions to rollover and you have to start new every month."
shiba,3dvtmk,jwallwalrus26,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:41:58 2015 UTC,"I use Healthy Paws and signed Vector up around 8 weeks. For my timing it was very affordable ($30/month) with a $250 yearly deductible and 90% post-deductible coverage. His premium lasts for life so long as we keep him on the plan, and the deductible resets annually rather than monthly.  The thing with Banfield is that they're corporate owned, but obviously each doctor is going to be different. The only thing you can compare with any two locations is that they're usually always in a Petsmart, and Petsmarts are everywhere. So I guess if you travel a lot and you have an accident with Nalah, they can very easily look up your records between Banfields.  Ultimately, just like two independent vets, you're going to have two completely different medical experiences from the staff, but ultimately, I'm sure the staff has limits to what they're able to provide based on their corporate ownership. If you find a great location with reputable staff that you can build a lasting relationship with, awesome. Go for it. If the insurance is cheaper through them than say, Trupanion or Healthy Paws, and that's important to you, then go for it. Insurance will get more expensive as the dog ages, so the younger she is, the better premium you'll get from a really good company like Trupanion or Healthy Paws.   Good luck!"

shiba,3dvu75,ThisIsRyGuy,2,Sun Jul 19 23:22:48 2015 UTC,My pup and I are no experts. But treats and something to lure her are my suggestions.  I use my phone sometimes to let her prey drive kick in.
shiba,3dvu75,c_chan21,2,Mon Jul 20 01:16:31 2015 UTC,"Proper leash walking will definitely take some time, but the big key is CONSISTENCY.  There are a few things you can do to help this.  Treats, toys, other items, things that might encourage him. But don't give him too many treats and make him fat or make him expect that treats will happen all the time on walks.  The one big thing is that this dog has NO BOND or TRUST with you. He WILL be stubborn and not want to do what you want to. Kiba pulled in every sort of direction and I had to drag him a lot for the first 4 months.  I still have to drag Kiba sometimes (because Taro has to wander everywhere to pee), but it has gotten better as Kiba has learned to trust me.  Shibas are also stubborn little shits, so even Taro sometimes does this and I've had her since 11 weeks old. I basically stand her up and say GO GO and she trots along and she might mope a little bit.  Definitely be patient. He is in a new place, with new people, and everything is overwhelming for him. Your walks might such for a few months as he is adjusting to you and try to not get impatient. Might be a good idea to go on small individual walks with him. REALLY short. Like down one block and back a few times a day.  I wouldn't say the puppy mill has anything to deal with it, and more that he is frightened and unbonded to you on top of being an independent breed."
shiba,3dvu75,jwallwalrus26,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:37:04 2015 UTC,"(because Taro has to wander everywhere to pee)   Ugh. Does Taro have to find the ""Perfect spot"" to poop? Vector will pee just about anywhere, though he does have his favorite spots, but when it comes to pooping around our apartment, he HAS to be in his favorite spot, which just so happens to be a big patch of ground covering ivy leaves. Luckily landscaping keeps it pretty trim, but it's just annoying because it's a bit more of a walk to get to his poo spot. The only other spot he'll poop in the apartment complex is on the other side, near our car in the parking lot."
shiba,3dvu75,Fizzbit,3,Mon Jul 20 20:21:56 2015 UTC,"OMG. POOPING IS THE WORSE! 20-30 mins. She literally will have poo halfway out her butt when she decides that this spot isn't good enough, gets up and starts walking and sniffing again. She will literally circle one area for a good 10 mins half squatting before finally committing. Sometimes she does it for 20 mins, I just give up and say ""Well you obviously don't need to poop that badly"" and we just go back inside and she falls asleep and I will just take her out later and hope she is inspired to truly poo."

I think the success depends whether or not your dog seeks closeness for comfort in stress situations. My corgi was the stickiest of velcro dogs and always cuddled me and loved being snuggled up to anyone, so it was perfect."

shiba,3driav,completelysilent,2,Sat Jul 18 19:27:54 2015 UTC,"Maybe go on a raw diet? Could be all the overly processed foods and not enough moisture. It really sounds more like an issue with her genetics versus food but I would consult with a new vet or look for a specialist.  I would also go on grain free. Shibas tend to do much better on grain free diets. If your shiba was poorly need, that is probably the reason as well."

The solution is to let her calm down after she wakes up and then dote on her, or let her out to pee and then dote on her."

shiba,3dk2p0,JSCuadros,5,Thu Jul 16 22:19:32 2015 UTC,"Biggest drawback, you have to double everything.  Now you have 2 dogs to train, 2 dogs to take care of, feed, bathe, pay for health issues, exercise, pay for boarding etc.  The dogs might have small confrontations from time to time, so you have to deal with that, but if you get the right companion that matches her personality than you should be good.  With a female shiba I SUPER SUPER STRONGLY suggest getting a MALE shiba or dog. Female shibas especially can be very ""bitchy"" with one another. There are always exceptions, but opposite gender pairs always do better because there is no sexual competition (Even when they are fixed, that still is partially there).  If Nalah is pretty hyperactive and energetic, probably not a good idea to get a senior dog, or a slow moving, low energy.  Shibas definitely do best with other shibas, but if you want another Japanese breed, I suggest a Kai Ken. They do really well respecting shibas boundaries and they are the least aggressive of all the Japanese breeds.  But other breeds to well with shibas. Huskies, labs, Australian shepards, german shepards...  We adopted a 3 year old Kai ken for our shiba Taro. She prefers larger male dogs, so we got a male dog a bit larger than her and he is a little over a year older than her. He isn't as energetic as her (he is still adjusting) but he has a lot of patience and deals with her hanging off of him very well."
shiba,3dk2p0,jwallwalrus26,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:11:49 2015 UTC,"We were told that shibas can be bitchy with other females in general not just other female shibas, but luckily Nalah seems to be fine every female dog on the block and got along with my friend's american eskimo. And nalah definitely is extremely energetic lol, I will definitely look into Kai Kens, thank you so much for the response I'll update you if we end up getting her a little buddy"
shiba,3dk2p0,jwallwalrus26,1 point,Fri Jul 17 11:43:11 2015 UTC,"Oh sorry, yeah female shibas just hate other females. If she gets along with them then she might be the exception but definitely matching temperament I think is more important."

The new vet is the one who's been subscribing all the meds, it's also a vet that my fiance's parents have been going to for 15+ years. This vet has recommended us to a specialist (aka $$$$) so we're trying to change her food to see if that will help first. We both just got out of college so the money is tight (especially since we paid $2500 for her and over $2k on vet bills so far). Again, we'd like to see if it's the food allergy that's causing the UTIs before we take her in again."

shiba,3diaml,FiveTailedFox,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:16:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah, we got ours from a ""puppy rescue"" (evidently they were saving puppies... from themselves. Owners also ran a puppy mill, they've since been shut down).  Really sorry to hear about the problems with her though. I'd definitely second the idea about getting pet insurance, but do some research. Close friend of mine is having digestive issues with her dog and the insurance wanted to not cover parts of treatment because they claim the issue was pre-existing. As far as the FIL can you talk to your SO or the rest of the family and have them talk to him? Maybe he's listen if the instructions were coming from his child or wife. Best of luck with it though!"
shiba,3diaml,Fizzbit,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:26:02 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the advice. I will look into the insurance for sure. And yes i've spoken with my fiance about it multiple times and asked him to speak privately with his dad... however... his family does not talk. They literally never tell each other when they're mad, sad, angry, nothing. I'm the only one who actually tries to talk about issues in the house. It's infuriating. So as much as my fiance says he'll talk to him, I seriously doubt it'll be an intense/serious conversation that lasts more than a few sentences."

shiba,3diaml,jwallwalrus26,2,Thu Jul 16 22:50:21 2015 UTC,"Do you put fish oil or coconut oil in her food once a day? Shibas in general are known for having skin issues of all sorts (allergies, just dry skin in general, hot spots, etc) and the oils do help a lot. It won't be immediate, but long term use will help her skin heal and be better suited to fight any recurring exposures.   I highly recommend Ultra Oil - for a dog her size, one pump a day should be perfect, just on her kibble."
shiba,3diaml,cupidforgets,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:33:15 2015 UTC,I love coconut oil (I eat it myself) so i will definitely start putting that in her food! Thank you!

She likes her food for about a week and then gets SO OVER IT and always wants something else. So I try to switch out dry food brands a bit regularly but I incorporate canned food (Merricks), cooked food, and now some raw food (Primal Raw nuggets) to just add variety.  You can also just make a bit of gravy or buy a thing of Costco parmesean cheese and sprinkle a little on their food, or cook up a scrambled egg and add that or small bits of chicken."

He's gone an entire day without eating on his own before, but then he'll eat half of it for breakfast the next morning.

We made her lay down when the cat was near - even if we had  to hold her down. Eventually she realized that when she stayed still, the cat would come investigate. Once the cat gets more comfortable with a semi-calm shiba, it is less likely to run away from an excited one."

shiba,3d9m9u,lordvoldermuff,3,Tue Jul 14 16:03:22 2015 UTC,"Mine was just spayed last Monday. Took her in in the morning, and picked her up after work. She was drugged out, and slept as soon as she got home. You'll want to be careful when you pick her up, the vet should show you how to properly pick her up without hurting her. I had mine placed on the floor of my car and instantly regretted it when I got home...  She was doing better the next day, gave her some Tramadol. Supposedly the painkillers can cause diarrhea - Alice had a waterfall flowing out of her butt later that afternoon when I took her out to pee. She didn't need to take any more after the first half pill in the morning, probably tasted like shit. We're told to keep them out of action for at least 1 week, but she was back to normal energy levels on the third day already. She did have one accident the night she came back, probably didn't get to pee all day though, and couldn't wait for the leash to go out to pee.   Also important to note that even though they may recover pretty quickly, we should still try to keep them calm. I ended up coming home for lunch last week, and took Alice out for shorter walks more frequently the entire week."
shiba,3d9m9u,omorawr,3,Tue Jul 14 16:33:18 2015 UTC,"Mine was just spayed last Thursday.  She was at 6 months.  Until yesterday night (monday) she was lethargic and doesn't really want to move.    last night she started getting back to normal.    On our walks for her to pee, she walks like 1/2 block and just sits.  and repeats."
shiba,3d9m9u,c_chan21,3,Tue Jul 14 18:24:54 2015 UTC,Okay so... We got ours spayed last month around the 6 month mark. And she was so so so loud. She whined and was in pain a lot. She was on meds and sleeping pills and it was just really bad that first night.  But after that first day she began getting back to normal by day 4 she was almost fully good again. We were super careful and babied her a lot though.
shiba,3d9m9u,Skiptoomylou,3,Tue Jul 14 18:30:19 2015 UTC,"My Kaiju was high as a kite when we picked her up. I second the extra caution when placing them in your vehicle and make sure that they can easily and safely be picked up without grabbing the sutures. She tried to resume business as usual when she got home but she was still pretty sedated and ended up crashing like a boeing 747 for pretty much the entire night. The following days had some pretty crazy diarrhea. We kept her walks a little shorter than usual and more frequent than usual due to the diarrhea, which was relentless. We'd take her out, she'd poop and pee and we'd get back indoors and she'd poop again, guiltily, right in front of us, looking at us all hunched over like 'i'm sorry guys'. We had to take her back after day 2 so we could get some additional medication to help get her poops back to the norm. It worked just fine. I'm extra cautious with my pets and kept her activity to minimum the entire 2 week recovery period because I didn't want to risk any issues with the affected area.  After 2 weeks had passed, I removed her E collar, gave her a warm bath to get rid of everything that accumulated during that 2 weeks. Gave her a snack and went out for a nice long walk.  Contrary to what some people say, getting your Shiba 'fixed' doesn't calm them down at all, haha. Shithead Shiba will be back in no time. :)"

shiba,3d9m9u,jwallwalrus26,2,Tue Jul 14 19:52:01 2015 UTC,"Taro was a bit lethargic the about a day or so after the surgery. She actually took it all really well and the cone didn't bother her at all.  The biggest advice is to KEEP THE CONE ON HER! Don't let her get to her stitches. Even if she seems to be super depressed about it being on her, it is REALLY important that she doesn't open her incision.  Also monitor the incision area for redness, swelling etc. Spay is a lot more invasive so higher probability of some complications.  If you take her to the lakehouse, just don't over exert her. Totally fine to travel, but just be cautious with her activity level and maybe look into emergency vets in the area in case if something happens to the incision area and she needs medical attention ASAP."

DC Shiba Inu Rescue has been working hard to help the pair become more trusting of humans, and realized that they were doing really well together. As of last week, they finally decided that the two were ready to find their forever homes, and I figured some kindhearted, nurturing Redditor might be interested.  A slightly more detailed post here."
shiba,3d795h,eight--bit,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:58:35 2015 UTC,"Hopefully the dogs find a good home. But I wouldn't work with DC SIR if my life depended on it.   They were one of the first places I contacted when I had first set my mind to getting a Shiba. I was told in not so many words, and only slightly less rude, to pound sand because I was too far away... This experience has left me with a sour taste when it comes to DC SIR, they are more concerned with keeping the dogs in a city area than with actually finding them a good home. I hope that the dog I contacted them about ended up finding a great home, but unfortunately for him, Kitsune now romps around the nice grassy non-city areas that he would have had."

He came to us from his rescue group as Kuma, which is cute. We've also considered Koga (after a wolf demon character from the anime Inuyasha), Shippo (fox demon from Inuyasha), or some play on Finn/Fennec (Finn being from Adventure Time, Fenn short for Fennec). Jiro was on the list, but I think we've ruled that out. Open to suggestions! But... hooray, after years of consideration and waiting for the perfect timing, we have a pup!"

He is adorable and I am mad jealous! Do you mind if I ask whereabouts you live? The shiba rescue out here in Texas pretty much never gets puppies.

Steel Fang is appropriate because he likes to chew! Finn McCool is an exceptional name, ha!  We live in Colorado. We waited for 5 years for the right situation to come up. We lived in Indiana prior to this so our options were a lot more limited unless we went through a breeder, which we didn't really want to do."

I'm hoping to get to that point, but I've read due to their nature (much like a husky or other animals with a prey drive or desire to run) they can't always be trusted unless they have great recall."
shiba,3d1y8x,cdmove,0,Mon Jul 13 20:04:55 2015 UTC,"I absolutely cannot.  Not unless we're at the dog park where there's a fence.  He doesn't really have a prey drive, but he's so curious about everything that he will run off.  I can tell by how hard he pulls on the leash.  He also lunged at a car when we were going home from my mother's house.  So yeah, he will never be off of a leash when we're outside."

Usually if I give him a moment to investigate whatever has caught his attention he'll come along with a light tug of the leash.  Speaking of his size, how big did your boy grow to be? My pup's vet records say he was 7.5 pounds at 8 weeks. He's 13 weeks now and we'll find out his weight this week at the vet."
shiba,3d1y8x,NJSeahawks,0,Mon Jul 13 20:39:30 2015 UTC,"He's a full grown dog sitting at 30 pounds, so he's a bit husky for the breed. I'm assuming that he didn't get much exercise at the mill. He's also imported from Japan, so I've been told that his build and gait are a bit different than a lot of Shibas bred in the states. He'll be getting much more exercise now, though.

shiba,3d5327,jdmwrex,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:33:05 2015 UTC,"I mean she's definitely too excited when meeting people.

As for the barking, shiba dogs are known for not being vocal.  Mine will bark once when someone is at the door, but he only started after seeing another dog do it, maybe introduce her to a vocal dog?   But be careful what you wish for, lol."

shiba,3cxq8q,intergalacticowl,7,Sat Jul 11 18:45:57 2015 UTC,"Hi. First off, your Shibapom looks awesome! I'm a 24 year old male and live with my 23 year old GF. We adopted our Shiba when he was 3 months old and he is now 11 months old. Birthday on August 6. He's a male named Rocko and purebred. In terms of loyalty and affection, he is not a single human dog. He love me, my gf, my mother, my sister, my uncle, and other people he's gotten to know a bit more. When I come home, his ears go down, his eyes squint, he smiles, wags his tail and attacks me with licks. It lasts about 5-10 minutes and then he goes on to play with his toys or look out the window. He does the same with my GF, mother and sister. He is very social in terms of meeting other people but he will protect our home to the death. He freaks out whenever somebody he doesn't know comes in our apartment or walks by our hallway (we live in a big apartment building). This is usually the only time he barks, or if he hears another dog. Rocko is very polite and social but that is because we socialized him as soon as we got him, introducing him to new things/people/dogs everyday, and trained him on proper manners (no biting, asking nicely for treats, and telling us when he needs to go out to use the bathroom). Shibas are really smart but that also comes with attitude, independence, and knowing how to piss you off. At the end of the day, the shiba will respond to how the human treats it. One thing about him is that he appreciates his own space but will sleep or hang out near you when he's tired. Let me know if you have other questions."
shiba,3cxq8q,Mrsolodolo7,2,Sat Jul 11 19:23:01 2015 UTC,How do you properly train is it better to punish bad or reward good or a combo of the both?
shiba,3cxq8q,PartiallyFamous,2,Sat Jul 11 20:11:08 2015 UTC,"Mostly reward the good with treats. When he is out of control, he gets a time out in his crate. We also do a lot of counter conditioning when he does something ""bad"". For example, he is very territorial so he thinks that a lot of things belong to him. One of those things are the window blinds (weird I know) so if you get near them, he would run over there and try to get u away from the blinds. We counter conditioned this by slowly walking towards the blinds and giving him treats as we got closer. This keeps his mind busy and eventually he forgot about the blinds. Practiced this a lot and now he doesn't care if we go near the blinds. I'm no expert in dogs since this is my first dog so Rocko has been teaching me a lot about dogs especially since shibas are no easy breed."
shiba,3cxq8q,Mrsolodolo7,2,Sat Jul 11 22:30:08 2015 UTC,This is my exact experience too.  I would add in to be very diligent with leash training and socialization early on as well.
shiba,3cxq8q,Architektual,3,Sat Jul 11 22:09:19 2015 UTC,"I have a six year old female Shiba that I adopted three years ago. In terms of loyalty, she is bonded with me, but has also bonded well with my boyfriend of a year and a half. She gets agitated when we leave and when she sees us coming up the walkway through the window she barks and gets excited. However, I can never take her off a leash because other instincts take over and she will run. I know some people who can take theirs off leash in open areas, but I've heard for the most part that Shibas will run in those instances. They're escape artists as well. That's one of the major downsides of the breed for me, but I can still take her to enclosed dog parks, so it doesn't matter much.  In terms of loudness I'd say mine barks less than four times a day. It's usually a means to say, ""I'm hungry"" or ""please let me outside"". It's pretty great because my brothers dogs bark at EVERYTHING and it wears on you. However, the Shiba bark can be high pitched and hurt the ears a tad.   My Shiba loooooves affection. She loves when company comes over because it means more people to pay attention to her and pet her. She will sometimes sleep in bed with me or sit next to me, but mostly only when she feels like it (it is a decent amount though). She usually follows me around, but spends a fair amount of time away from me just napping or laying in the other room. It's kind of nice sometimes, especially because I've seen other dogs that are always under foot.   I have heard that there is a difference between male and female shibas, but I can't remember specifics. One can be more aggressive than the other, but I think it mostly depends on training and dog personality because I've been to Shiba inu meet ups where males and females are all over the place and don't fit the specific traits I read about online.   I'm on mobile so it's harder to type, but i think I answered all your questions. If you have more feel free to PM me. Shibas are great, beautiful dogs. Hope it works out for them!"

shiba,3coxm7,Idol_Luna,3,Thu Jul 9 16:30:26 2015 UTC,I can see the resemblance.
shiba,3coxm7,Chrisixx,2,Thu Jul 9 22:54:12 2015 UTC,Inari is also a japanese shinto god/goddess (depending on the story) of the harvest (thus the sushi) who uses foxes for messengers.
shiba,3coxm7,dirvine_r,1 point,Fri Jul 10 00:09:41 2015 UTC,Inari is also a municipality in northern Finland. Very beautiful place. http://www.inari.fi/en/main-page.html
shiba,3coxm7,peukku,1 point,Fri Jul 10 10:09:17 2015 UTC,"Cute!  My shiba is also named Inari, a female though. Mischievous doesn't begin to cover it. Until she was 6 or so, when she mellowed out a bit, we referred to her affectionationately as devil-dog"
shiba,3coxm7,dirvine_r,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:38:08 2015 UTC,"Yay for awesome names! Yeah Inari is about 5, so we have another year to go, case in point, this picture was taken right after being yelled at for being on the bed. Guess whether he complied"
shiba,3coxm7,dirvine_r,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:46:14 2015 UTC,"We found the key to our Inari was tone of voice. If it was anything other than a clear command (think drill sergeant), she interpreted it as a suggestion that she was free to ignore. When she was in full on devil mode (e.g. she'd escaped by digging and commando crawling under the fence, and was amusing herself by staying 20 ft in front of us while we chased her) then the tone of voice would need to be commanding and very angry."
shiba,3coxm7,drowninginthedarknes,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:52:02 2015 UTC,"Oh I trained Inari very well, but currently he is with my father and he spoils him and wonders why he doesn't listen"
shiba,3cpl0s,ThisIsRyGuy,6,Thu Jul 9 19:25:40 2015 UTC,"Its harder to give advice because you are getting an adult and not a younger dog. His personality will already be set.  When you take him home, establish a routine and rules right away. Dogs, including shibas, like routines. They like to know what to expect. And if you bend rules once or twice, then its no longer a rule as far as they are concerned."
shiba,3cpl0s,dirvine_r,4,Thu Jul 9 20:38:31 2015 UTC,"And if you bend rules once or twice, then its no longer a rule as far as they are concerned   Shibas. Give them an inch, and they'll take a mile."
shiba,3cpl0s,slithymonster,3,Fri Jul 10 14:43:48 2015 UTC,Why stop at a mile?
shiba,3cpl0s,dirvine_r,2,Fri Jul 10 15:15:42 2015 UTC,"I'll definitely get a routine going for him immediately.  The lady said he seems very well tempered and doesn't seem like he wants to hunt anymore, as he's gotten old and also been fixed.  The videos that I've seen of him are pretty good.  He's calm but sometimes ignores, meaning looks the other way, when she calls his name.  I expect him to be like that for a while.    Thank you very much for your input!"
shiba,3cpl0s,mcmahong69,3,Fri Jul 10 00:56:56 2015 UTC,Completely agree with divine on this one. My shibe and I have a very regular routine.  For the most part they are extremely quiet and listen well but can be EXTREMELY stubborn. Especially as an adult. Be prepared for him to basically resist you on everything.   Very bad in social situations. At least mine is. Best of luck with your new shibe. Hope everything works out.
shiba,3cpl0s,dirvine_r,2,Thu Jul 9 23:56:47 2015 UTC,"Thank you!  I do know that they're quite stubborn and I'm prepared for it.  We also have a female Sheltie who (I hope) will help me teach him the ropes of how things go around here.    I'll definitely make sure that he has a routine, especially with exercise.  I plan on walking him twice a day, weather permitting, since they're quite energetic and need the exercise.  When you say, ""bad in social situations,"" what do you mean?  Social dog situations, like at the park or around people?  I've read and heard from numerous sites and people that they're wary of new people.  We're both really excited to have a Shibe and want him to feel good about where he will live."
shiba,3cpl0s,mcmahong69,2,Fri Jul 10 00:09:21 2015 UTC,"some shibas want to get into dominance fights with other dogs, especially of the same gender. They don't all do that - mine knows she's top dog and ignores others unless they're rude. Then she'll put them in their place. But others snarl and lunge at every dog they see.  I had a sheltie too until recently. Completely opposite personalities. Have fun!"
shiba,3cpl0s,jwallwalrus26,2,Fri Jul 10 02:47:41 2015 UTC,"Honestly, my Shibe is the best dog in the world. She's exceptionally smart, quiet, pleasant and good with other pets (I also have a cat), this includes taking her to the dog park. She rarely has issues with other dogs and only if they initiate on her. She doesn't chew stuff up, 100% housebroken and have literally never had an incident since she was a pup.   However, when I say they are bad in social situations. What I meant was that they are very very cerebral animals and are crazy alert. Because of that, the littlest thing to you can make them freak out and become very cautious and on guard.   For example, I brought my dog to a company BBQ and there were these carnival rides and what not and she FREAKED OUT THE WHOLE TIME because of the noises! She fought the leash, wouldn't allow strangers to come near her and wouldn't have anything to do with friends of mine or other dogs.   I'd say my dog has extreme social anxiety. That doesn't necessarily mean your Shibe will behave this way but needless to say my dog is probably more suited to being a house dog.   Be very cautious when taking him to the park and be sure to watch him. They are also very good escape artists. Mine has escaped and come back more than a handfull of times. Best of luck to you and the most loyal companion you will probably ever have."
shiba,3cpl0s,jwallwalrus26,2,Fri Jul 10 19:17:41 2015 UTC,"One thing that is good about adopting an adult, you know EXACTLY what his personality will be upfront and for the rest of his life. Luckily, he is 8 years old. Shibas really mellow out around that age. He will still have some of the stubborn, prissy diva type stuff, but he should be far more manageable. Basically, adopting an older (over 5 years old) shiba tends to be far more positive and a good idea especially for people who are inexperienced with shibas.  Of course you should interact with the dog a whole bunch when you go there, but definitely expect that he might not really care to interact with you (typical shiba aloof-ness to strangers).  You will need to ask the rescue people WAY more questions on his temperament. If it is a shiba specific rescue, they are especially going to be very honest about his personality because many shiba rescues are very adamant on proper placement.  If you do end up going home with him, everyone has already said to establish a routine. Slowly start doing more things with him and helping him out without flooding him with too many things. He might take to everything really quickly, but he might not.   Shibas can sometimes take a while to really warm up to new people so expect AT LEAST 6 months of frustration of him potentially ignoring you, being fearful, etc.  We adopted a 3 year old Kai Ken (cousin to the shiba) and we are coming up on 10 months since adopting him and he is still slowly coming out of his shell, but Kai are NOTORIOUSLY harder to rehome."
shiba,3cpl0s,bonytony21,1 point,Fri Jul 10 00:34:11 2015 UTC,"The rescue specializes in placing Shibas in good homes.  They have a few other breeds of dogs but their main breed is Shibas.  I've asked about his temperament since we have a cat and a Sheltie.  She said that he doesn't really have that ""hunting"" drive that a lot of them tend to have and that he's a pretty mellow dude.  They did a fairly extensive background check along with the application we had to fill out, which included four personal references and released my vet records for our current pets, so they do try their best to make sure that these animals go to good homes.    I'm definitely planning on trying to interact with him as much as I can without freaking him out.  We'll be the new people and I expect him to be unsure of both of us.    Thank you for your response!"
shiba,3cpl0s,slithymonster,1 point,Fri Jul 10 00:54:43 2015 UTC,"Yeah. Kiba was pretty standoffish with us when we came to visit him, but we adopted him anyways because of what the woman had told us about him and the fact that Taro had a neutral interaction with him.  It might actually be good to ask them if you can bring your sheltie to have them meet on neutral ground and see how they interact."
shiba,3cmiit,lunabonamour,3,Thu Jul 9 01:43:56 2015 UTC,What kind of damage was done? How is he feeling now?
shiba,3cmiit,H2ho,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:19:48 2015 UTC,"We brought him in pretty quickly, maybe four or five hours after we left the beach and he's young and otherwise healthy so he recovered pretty quickly. It essentially turns to wet cement in their gi tract and is pretty uncomfortable and, if not addressed, really dangerous. His x-ray looked a lot like this(scroll down a bit). But they gave him an iv to get him rehydrated and to get the belly cement softened up, and some pain medicine. He came home the next afternoon already back to his bouncy self other than a few...interesting bathroom experiences."
shiba,3cmiit,H2ho,2,Thu Jul 9 16:36:45 2015 UTC,So did he take a quick few mouthfuls when you weren't looking? Or did you find him making a 5 course meal out of the sand?   I wanna bring my dog to the beach and she loves to roll her face and head in the sand. I don't know if she ingests any during this tho. But it doesn't seem like mine sees sand as a food course. Your post is making me worried :(
shiba,3cmiit,cdmove,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:36:05 2015 UTC,"We saw him trying to lick the sand a few times, pretty gently it seemed, and immediately stopped him. He dug a couple of holes and I think he might have intentionally licked up some sand then, though not much, and we realized later that when we thought he was just drinking water from the waves as they washed in that he was probably lapping up sand. He didn't seem to be doing it very quickly or aggressively at any point, but he was definitely licking the sand when we saw him and not just rolling around in it."
shiba,3cmiit,c_tsmith,0,Thu Jul 9 18:40:08 2015 UTC,don't worry. just keep your eyes on your shibe the first time. mine doesn't do this so I think you'll be okay.
shiba,3cmiit,anathemeta,2,Fri Jul 10 00:05:15 2015 UTC,"Our's is constantly trying to eat EVERYTHING. She's been sick since the day we got her because she's always trying to eat dirt, bugs.. lick the cats butt. like seriously, wtf."
shiba,3cmiit,cdmove,2,Thu Jul 9 16:32:37 2015 UTC,"Jozy is the same way, sand was only the latest in a string of efforts to prove that he will eat ANYTHING. He also loves underwear, paper towel, our dresser drawers (but only one corner), my sleep mask, and of course his own poop. Wouldn't touch a piece of fruit to save his life though."

shiba,3clu8d,DumbShoes,4,Wed Jul 8 22:29:46 2015 UTC,"Ask /r/Dogtraining, but if you want to know what I would do, with the caveat that I'm not nearly as qualified as people in that subreddit are...  I'd ask her to lay down, make her stay, and then enjoy my time with the Poodle.  If she tries to move you correct her, snap your fingers or whatever and get her to lay down again.  It will probably take a few times to get her to stay, but I find giving them something to do other than telling them something they can't do is more effective.  It also helps her understand you're the boss without being physical about it, just mental.  Do it in the same room but not too close to where you're relaxing with the poodle, the corner of the room while you're about a dozen feet away.  After she's calm for a while you can invite her over and see if she stays that way while you pet both of them.  Keep your heartrate as low as you can, make sure you're relaxed and not putting off any energy that would give her any reason to feel tension outside of her own mind.  All chill, two dogs and you just relaxing.  TL;DR: When I see behavior like that I clamp down.  No more lovey dovey, but not mean, just emotionless with a rigid unwavering structure until I see the behavior I want and reward it.  I don't release the clamp until I see the correct behavior demonstrated over time, make them earn your attention with good behavior."

shiba,3clu8d,randersom,2,Thu Jul 9 08:50:57 2015 UTC,"Have you taken care of a pregnant dog before, or assisted with a birth? Her changes in behavior are related to her pregnancy, not because she is a Shiba.  At 6+ weeks pregnant, she should be settling in and preparing for birth. However, she's also young and inexperienced, so could be extra irritable.     ""Even if your dog is usually as sweet as cherry pie, she might behave in an uncharacteristic agitated manner around the end of her gestation. Play it safe and never allow young kids or fellow pets to be anywhere near dogs who are displaying annoyed or impatient behavior."" Source     If you will have her for a week or more, you should prepare for puppies. She needs a whelping box, has special dietary and exercise requirements, and should be monitored by a vet for complications.     More info - http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/breedingpregnancyguide.htm"

shiba,3cijr6,B4llzD33p,6,Wed Jul 8 04:35:11 2015 UTC,"Because shibas are reactive and pissy. He was probably getting really tired of the other dogs and has minimal patience that had run out. He is also at that angsty teenager phase where they have EVEN LESS patience and want to be left alone from time to time and if he isn't getting that alone time, he will lash out.  Yes this has happened with me and my shiba breeder friends. Shibas truly are emotional divas and sometimes you kind of have to try to work around their emo phases.  Taro (almost 2 years old) gets pissy after being at a different place for usually half a day. She starts getting anxious and wants to go home. After a full day of play, she is pretty much OVER all the other dogs and wants to be left alone. If we are staying the night, depending on the location, Taro will pretty much just go in another room to be alone and sleep while the other dogs play.  Now how do you handle this? Understand that your dog doesn't want to be friends with everyone ALL the time and might need some alone time. Watch his body language and if he is showing signs of negativity, then you need to remove him from the situation, let him have a safe quite place to retreat to, make sure he can have his food, water, and some toys to himself so he can have alone shiba time and if he wants to interact, he will, if not, just let him do his own thing.  My shiba breeder friends get the same thing. The dogs all grew up together and have lived together for years, but sometimes they just are so tired of each other and need to be separated from time to time to just be alone. Shibas demand respect for their space, so when they don't get it, they get REALLY upset.  OMG quick story. Taro was SUPER emo when I went to my parents for the 4th of July. She usually loves the place because it is filled with fun cat toys, but she decided to be emo and stay in the bathroom for a while and be completely unsocial while my other dog (who had never been there) was busy have the friggin time of his life. She eventually decided it was ""ok"" when we started eating and giving her beef and salmon trimmings."
shiba,3cijr6,jwallwalrus26,2,Wed Jul 8 05:59:35 2015 UTC,"I agree with u/jwallwalrus26's remark regarding the patience of shibas.  My shiba has exhibited similar symptoms when I brought him over to play with a particular puppy who had an unending amount of energy.  Mine will play for about 30 mins with that dog, then he's sick of it and will start growling and hiding under my legs to get away from the puppy (who's still going, is about 80lbs and still pouncing on my dog and nudging him with his long legs -- entirely in the innocent, overjoyed, big-doe-eye PLEASEPLAYWITHME puppy kind of way).    My dog, however, clearly has had enough and now it's time to separate them, give him alone time or to take him home, or he will start nipping.   My shiba has otherwise been great at dog parks (where we stay for maybe an hour at a time), and with most of my other friends' dogs."
shiba,3cijr6,mangosago,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:07:13 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the input guys.  He's the same way at dog parks u/mangosago.  He's great for an hour, then time to go.  I'll keep a closer eye on him and see when he starts getting cranky.  Is there any way of weening him off being crappy like that or any chance he may grow out of it?"
shiba,3cijr6,randersom,3,Wed Jul 8 23:58:28 2015 UTC,"Honestly, Shibas tend to get more intolerant with age. And prefer socializing with a small group of close friends rather then large groups of unknown dogs like at dog parks or meetups.     Best way to avoid further crappy behavior is to prevent it. The more a dog practices bad behavior, the more it becomes an ingrained habit.      If your dog only has tolerance for a hour or two of intense play, or one day of a visit, that's all he gets. If you really want to increase the threshold, start with a safe margin of time (that you know he's good with), and slowly add more as long as he's up for it. Negative experiences will set you back, and you have to start over.      I know that's pretty simplistic, but that's the basis of all positive association training. Good luck!"
