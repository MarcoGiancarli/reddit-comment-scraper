PictureGame,3e2pzb,TheLamestUsername,2,Tue Jul 21 15:09:51 2015 UTC,"Calle Góngora in Malagra (Mal)  - then a licking dog on the street  This goes to my quandary. Should questions, be very open to several interpretations (his poetry, some other clue based on his biography etc) or should there be something in the question that directs you in a way (use the info to find the exact spot, and tell me the licking dog's breed) but does writing the question in that manner make it too easy or take away the fun of the riddle? no clue."
PictureGame,3e2pzb,gosslot,2,Tue Jul 21 15:17:12 2015 UTC,"yeah, it's a tough call. I lean towards preferring the later. without it, so many possibilities make sense and the winner is determined by who went down the right rabbit hole"

PictureGame,3e2pzb,fatwoof,2,Tue Jul 21 15:34:09 2015 UTC,"I think it really depends on what complexity you expect from these games. I think if something's solvable in 1-2 hours (with some hints) it should be okay here... I mean, I only started to play here yesterday, so I'm noone to tell, but from what I saw, that is the average time span for harder ones. And again, this included everything to guide you I think... no?"
PictureGame,3e2pzb,fatwoof,2,Tue Jul 21 15:22:30 2015 UTC,"I think all you needed was in the picture. you just needed to look at the info correctly, and guide your focus that way. There was no need for hints. only change i would have made is not having a question that could have been solved with wild guesses or brute force. But nothing was arbitrary or flexible.  I like added complexity, because it brings in a whole new dimension of the game. All of the items were there, and i do not think there were other valid answers. we can't blame you if we ran down crazy rabbit holes."

PictureGame,3e2ilo,Ewulkevoli,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:38:48 2015 UTC,Just a suggestion: I would try to be a bit more clear next time about what you're looking for. I know it seems that doing so would give it away but at least mention that the answer isn't related to the artist. There are a lot of possibilities that fit into what we were provided.
PictureGame,3e2ilo,fatwoof,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:42:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah you're right, only problem is there are so many possibilities to take care about that it's almost impossible to do so. I mean I just needed a pic saying ""art saves"" and searching into the background of every pictures is tough, not to mention to expect Gibraltar having anything but red sand on one side when the road is called Red Sands is basically impossible. :-D You either know it or don't, and then the solvers will bump into facts that you didn't expect. Well, maybe the solution is to go simpler with my riddles...and yeah this was a bit vague :-) Thanks tho :-)"
PictureGame,3e2ilo,Ewulkevoli,2,Tue Jul 21 13:48:59 2015 UTC,"not to mention to expect Gibraltar having anything but red sand on one side when the road is called Red Sands is basically impossible.   1) Google: ""Gibraltar sand""  2) first link is https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Gibraltar_Sand_Dune  3) first paragraph in the first section:   The prehistoric dune is made from yellow, windblown sands lacking the red component of the sands on the west side of the Rock.   Rounds should be created with a clear goal in mind.  However....the occasional gray area round is permissible because hell, I love to throw a curveball round in once in a while.      Another thing we should start doing more is explaining the round.  How did you find the answer? What path did the OP intend?  Sometimes you post something obscure, and it turns out someone else was in that exact building in Dubai at the same time and immediately recognized the image.  That's part of the game though, and you'll find that the longer you play, the more you learn about the world and all the cool and weird shit it has.  Just my $.02    edit: and you may find out that someone else knows more about your round than you! or that you're wrong about something.  (has happened to me a few times)  :D"
PictureGame,3e2ilo,fatwoof,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:56:50 2015 UTC,Another thing we should start doing more is explaining the round   I agree. I'm always very interested about that. But it's tough to choose between spending a bit of time explaining yourself and getting a good start on the next round.   Have you ever thought about how nice it would be if rounds only started/became visible at the XX:X0 or XX:X5 mark? Ideally the OP would be able to post at any time but the round would wait to go public until the clock ended in 0 or 5. Constant refreshing and missed rounds would be a thing of the past if this were the case
PictureGame,3e2ilo,al_qeal_yall,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:20:48 2015 UTC,not if the OP gave a post eta per the rules. :)  You can always explain after you've posted your round too.

First edition of this wonderfully anti-clerical fluxbox where Hendricks has offered various relics which are clearly modern and not what is claimed: ie, a pen used by Theodore of Mopsuestia to write his Nestorian errors (a biro); a fragment of rope by which Judas hung himself (some electrical wire), fingernails of Monophysitists cut at the Council of Chakcedon (true enough - fingernails); holy shit from diners at the Last Supper (cat poop); the final stone that killed St James the Less (a tiny pebble); nails from the cross of St Andrew (again nails but suspiciously modern looking) and sweat of Lucifer from the heat of hell (the liquid is indeed red and in a medical bottle once used by Maciunas to treat his own ailments). To our taste the very best of the small Fluxus boxes. Limitation not known but very scarce. Fine. Ref: Silverman Fluxus Codex nr. 153."

PictureGame,3dufy2,TheLamestUsername,0,Sun Jul 19 16:14:07 2015 UTC,"Robert Lincoln was coincidentally either present or nearby when three presidential assassinations occurred.  Lincoln was not present at his father's assassination. He was at the White House,and rushed to be with his parents.The president was moved to Petersen House after the shooting, where Robert attended his father's deathbed.  At President James A. Garfield's invitation, Lincoln was at the Sixth Street Train Station in Washington, D.C., where the President was shot by Charles J. Guiteau on July 2, 1881, and was an eyewitness to the event. Lincoln was serving as Garfield's Secretary of War at the time.  At President William McKinley's invitation, Lincoln was at the Pan-American Exposition in Buffalo, New York, where the President was shot by Leon Czolgosz on September 6, 1901, though he was not an eyewitness to the event.  Robert Todd Lincoln died in Vermont"

His other favoured term was ""perfect"" and in 1984 he performed The Perfect Death, walking a large circle whilst a Tibetan monk blew a traditional horn. Byars would have considered his real death to be perfect: he expired in the Anglo-American Hospital in Cairo, a venue conveying the exotic, old-fashioned, inherently romantic flavour of his existence."
