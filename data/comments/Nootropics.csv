Nootropics,3e1r6m,EliKanavaros,7,Tue Jul 21 07:58:15 2015 UTC,"In order to increase reaction speed (response time), I think you need to take a systems approach to the brain.  There are many different areas involved in the brain to create a reaction, and depending on the stimulus or task, the areas of the brain required can vary widely, but in general a healthy and optimized brain will be able to react more quickly to stimulus.   For example, having all the nutrients in your eyes at optimal levels can increase visual processing and ultimately reaction speed on visual tests.   In general, increasing macular pigment density through supplementation resulted in significant improvements in visual processing speed, even when testing young, healthy individuals who tend to be at peak efficiency. [Source]   Aerobic exercise also can have an effect on reaction speed. A meta-analysis of randomized control trials shows this effect:   Aerobic exercise training is associated with modest improvements in attention and processing speed [Source]       Brain training is also another method to increase reaction speed, once which I have seen improvements on myself (I have reached a .19 ms average reaction speed in some games).    Our results showed that playing Brain Age for 4 weeks could lead to improve cognitive functions (executive functions and processing speed) in the elderly. This result indicated that there is a possibility which the elderly could improve executive functions and processing speed in short term training [Source]   A contributing factor of response time is being able to ignore distractions, and that is one of the reasons the stack caffeine and L-theanine works so well. Caffeine increases reaction speed and theanine reduces distractions, increases alpha waves and calms the brain.   The response time for trials requiring a switch followed the same pattern as that seen for overall performance of this task and the response time decreased relative to baseline in all conditions...Response times were fastest in the L-theanine+caffeine condition. [Source]   This systems approach to the brain is also evident in looking into why meditation increasing reaction speed. Similarly to the l-theanine, meditation also increases alpha waves and improves relaxation and increased neuronal synchronization.    Meditation appears to provide at least a short term improvement in reaction time performance...The improvement we see in novice meditators may be related to the increase in alpha (8-12 Hz) or theta (5-7 Hz) waves and the increased feelings of relaxation that may decrease distraction on the subsequent PVT, and thus improve performance. In addition, the increase in neuronal synchronization may directly improve the performance of neuronal systems needed for the PVT, perhaps by some kind of ""re-setting"" to baseline conditions. [Source]   Piracetam and other racetams are known to have autonomic normalizing effects that improve the all-around abilities of the brain and so the effects can be difficult to measure acutely. This is why many scientists who use a site-specific drug targeting ideology have a hard time with piracetam and piracetam-like substances. One of the main ways piracetam effects the brain is through increasing membrane fluidity, especially in older subjects. This increased ability  can play out in many different testing scenarios as positive results. Regarding reaction speed, here is one study (not the best source) that shows increase in reaction speed in a simple reaction speed test:   The reaction time was measured by ruler dropper test method, and by this method we can determine the nerve time, movement time & processing time. This study showed that piracetam significantly improves the processing time of reaction time, which reflects the stimulatory and enhancement effect on cognitive function and vigilance [Source]    I could keep going, I have more studies on piracetam, phenylpiracetam, citicoline, caffeine etc but I have to run. I hope you got my general point that reaction speed is composed of many parts of the system. To increase reaction speed, you should have all required and supplemental nutrients and nootropics required, exercise, meditation, sleep, training etc. Since working on optimizing my brain and body for performance, by utilizing a system approach, not only have I noticed increased reaction speeds, but other people have noticed as well and brought it up in conversation."
Nootropics,3e1r6m,matznerd,10,Tue Jul 21 19:05:43 2015 UTC,"You know how in the Halo universe, they replace the nervous systems of the Spartans with electrical wiring so that they have faster reflexes? Well, turns out some of your nerves already do this.  There are certain neuronal synapses in the nervous system called electrotonic synapses, that are actually coupled electrically rather than chemically. The gap junction of an electrotonic synapse is only 2nm, rather than the normal 20nm. These special synapses are in charge of high-speed responses, such as reflexes or the synchronization of a large number of neurons, and often come with neighboring synapses that determine whether the electrotonic synapse is coupled or uncoupled.   If I understand correctly, it is a failure to properly uncouple these neurons while falling asleep that causes hypnic jerks.  As far as drugs that increase reaction time, I've gotten quantifiable results from P21. Just whatever you do, administer it intranasally, not subQ: much more effective that way."

It also gave me pretty bad drowsiness: at one point, I was spitefully using it as a sleep aid, since it didn't seem good for anything else.  Intranasally, I got the reaction time along with an uplifted mood and and a more pronounced kinesthesia boost. I don't remember the sedation being as prominent, either.  From what I gather, it really is a lot better paired with SELANK or SEMAX, to counteract the sedation and synergize with the other neurotrophic factors. Unfortunately, my NASEMAXA arrived just as I ran out of P21.  There are far better values in terms of drugs and far better drugs in terms of effects. I would be keen on trying out the original cerebrolysin. If I end up with some money to use, I might drop some on THT's product and finally give it a swing.

Nootropics,3e1r6m,Lyle_Cantor,13,Tue Jul 21 14:30:01 2015 UTC,"Okay... not sure what to do about that. Sorry you don't believe me. Would you like to disprove it or something? We're not discussing religion or philosophy, here. I got my facts from a 2012 neuroanatomy textbook: theres a chance that they have been disproven. I'm not making any of this up, though.  It makes sense to me that the brain would only use this form of conduction for the most essential of mechanisms and nothing else. The brain is already a very energy-intensive organism: I imagine electrotonic connections make the biggest draw of all on precious reserves of ATP. The brain will happily forget everything but the most rudimentary instincts and habits for the sake of better energy efficiency: why not be the same way about rapid conductivity? Our ancestors didn't survive to procreate because their brains were sloppy with energy allocation, not to mention that there are certain benefits to slower conduction rates, namely the functionality of interneuron feedback negation and other fail safes that regulate neural activity. Electrotonic connections would make such feedback systems far more difficult to manage."
Nootropics,3e1r6m,Debonaire_Death,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:50:18 2015 UTC,"I just know that saltatory conduction is embarrassingly slow. I'm sure your right, and evolution is pretty terrible at design, but given the fitness advantage of reaction time and intelligence, I figured anything was better than saltatory conduction."
Nootropics,3e1r6m,Lyle_Cantor,6,Tue Jul 21 22:33:37 2015 UTC,"Well, you have to think about what is being managed. In one of the Federalist papers, Hamilton exalts the virtues of the slowness of bureaucracy, because it keeps any one faction from gaining too much power too quickly and overthrowing the other factions. I think, through compliance with natural laws, our brains needed to do the same: make do with a slower form of conduction because higher forms wouldn't allow the capacity to safely manage activity. Doing things right isn't about doing them quickly, and this is nowhere more true than with the brain. Also, just like Hamilton argued that slowness prevents despotism, so slowness in the brain would keep any of the multiple regulatory systems from going out of control and destroying everything, the way a crazy dictator does (or at least slow down the process so someone can notice and do something).  Imagine the electrotonic synapses as phone lines, and the saltatory synapses as government workers: although the slowness keeps everyone in check, everyone still needs to be able to communicate quickly enough to act as one when the need arises. Electrotonic connections are basically a key part of what gives rise to a singular consciousness in a many-fold organism like the human brain.  Could you just imagine the kind of rate at which neuroses could develop into irreversible events with a hardwired brain? Without all of the tonic transmission and a buildup of proper EPSPs and IPSPs, you would have a molecular machine that could easily go out of control due to even a simple conundrum, much as what happens with computer programs when presented with something out of their code. Instead of immediately arriving at an impasse or pushing ourselves to a breaking point, our slower conduction allows the brain to adapt it's circuitry. Perhaps this could be achieved with completely electrotonic neurons, but I imagine it would be very difficult. I mean, we've already been increasing the rate at which our external lives move and you've seen what that's done for our mental health.  EDIT: And as a side note, I would argue evolution is pretty awesome at design, since it work by basically trying everything possible at once, so that anything that has the slightest chance of failing will. The complex designs of today are built on the bones of countless inferior systems, in the form of everything from failed chemical reactions, to non-reproducing animals, to fallen empires and obsolete technology. It is an elegantly direct system that can work as a heuristic for the improvement of anything bound to the temporal realm."
Nootropics,3e1r6m,Debonaire_Death,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:19:56 2015 UTC,"Your brain already has the second largest energy consumption density of anything in your body, taking ~10% of your energy and ~20% of your blood flow. There are some interesting analyses comparing humans to other apes showing that humans have replaced a significant amount of energy consumption for digestion with that which supports cognition. I am willing to believe that biologically there are much better possible substrates for cognition which aren't used because of energy costs. Luckily that isn't a problem now-a-days :). Also transmission through neurotransmittors and through electronic synapses are done very differently. Electronic synapses can simply serve to equilibrate the potentials of 2 neurons while neurotransmitters have the well known picture of one neuron 'firing' and causing another neuron to fire. Also the speed of neural stuff happening is not really determined by the synapses but by how fast signals propagate along axons which is more determined by myelination, atleast with longer nerves.  I personally don't believe electronic synapses are the way to go because of their difference in mechanism, but they do exist and do things on much faster time scales.  edit: also for an evolving human I'm not sure thinking speed mattered that much. For a well trained athlete the body is basically the limiting factor in terms of speed of action."
Nootropics,3e1r6m,heart_of_gold1,4,Wed Jul 22 00:09:02 2015 UTC,"Well, not exclusively.  Electrotonic propogation does exist and is faster than action potentials, but the signal attenuates (dies off) exponentially since it isn't being constantly renewed like it is in the action potential chain reaction.  This makes it suitable only for extremely short distance relaying and taking input from multiple sources.  However, I find it implausible that it's responsible for elevated twitch based ability due to its short range and the relatively long distance through the brain from visual stimulus to voluntary muscle planning and movement.  The extended axons theory sounds more plausible..."
Nootropics,3e1r6m,zalo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:44:01 2015 UTC,"As I added above, you also have to take into account how much more difficult to regulate a 100% electrotonic brain would be. A lot of neural regulation happens via the activation of feedback loops and parallel signalling, which requires detection of intrasomal neurochemical concentrations and neuronal excitation. I'm not even sure how a brain could function in terms of recycling and ordering neurotransmitters and neuropeptides if it was running completely electrically."

We can run using chemical, saltitory, or fully electrical transmission, the problem is pure electrical is traditionally assisted by auxillary cells which help maintain the synaptic conditions, and requires very exact ion threshold regulation in both neurons, all of which is hard. Failures here can lead to over-stimulation, seizures, or down-regulating from over-firing.  Oh, and if you run out of supporting glial neurotransmitters you have to stop while the vesicles refill, lest you lose the proper level of neuromodulation and again either become too close to the seizure threshold or fall too low.  Basically the pathway needs to be specific enough that these conditions only exist in well-practiced pathways."

Nootropics,3e2rna,captaincannibal,14,Tue Jul 21 14:47:54 2015 UTC,"There is a lot of misinformation about Memantine in the nootropics community right now for some reason. Clinically, Memantine is used in severe Alzheimer's treatment, where excess glutamatergic activity is theorized to contribute to the progression of the disease. By negatively modulating glutamatergic activity in a somewhat unique way, Memantine might slow disease progression by reducing excess glutamatergic signaling and slow excitotoxicity. Memantine also has some very, very preliminary research showing potential positive effects as an adjunct (though not as a primary medication) in some other conditions such as bipolar disorder. But again, I must stress that this is preliminary and it's not suitable as a first-line or standalone treatment, and certainly not suitable for self-medication in bipolar disorder.  As far as actual positive results in humans go, that's about where it ends. Early reports based on murine studies and unhealthy individuals suggested a possible cognition-improving effect, from which there were many sensationalized news stories that implied that Memantine was the next big thing in cognition enhancement, but the real-world results don't seem to translate in to healthy humans with otherwise functional glutamatergic activity. In fact, most internet reports on Memantine (including my own) end when the user realizes that the brain fog never really completely disappears.  There are some hand-wavey theories about how Memantine's alpha-7 nAChR antagonism (which decreases cognition) will somehow force the receptor to re-regulate to a new set point where it is more active than baseline even with Memantine antagonizing it, but these are seriously stretching our understanding of that system and I'd consider them more along the lines of wishful thinking than actual science.  To answer your questions:   What exactly is it used for? I've seen everything from brain fog to depression to anixety to Alzheimer's.   Alzheimer's right now, maybe adjunctive treatment for bipolar disorder in the future. Memantine isn't going to treat brain fog directly, unless that brain fog is caused by an underlying disorder which Memantine counters (e.g. cognition is improved in Alzheimer's patients). In the vast majority of people, Memantine is just going to induce brain fog.  Depression studies in humans have shown that Memantine is not helpful and does not produce the same depression-lifting effects as Ketamine. Here is some solid reasoning for why that is the case: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24912158  You can find some anecdotes where people claim Memantine eases their depression, but these people are usually in the early dissociative phase of treatment, where you tend to feel unphased by anything due to the dissociation and brain fog. Memantine might also induce some early dopaminergic effects due to NMDA antagonism and D2 agonism, but those will fade over time. In short, it's not a viable depression treatment in humans.   How long do you take it for? I haven't seen anyone actually say ""I took it once a day for 4 months at 3mg"".   The half-life is extremely long. On the order of a couple days. As such, your blood concentrations won't even stabilize until you've been taking the exact same dose for a week or two, and you're probably looking at another week of two to allow for proper re-regulation at that dose level. Combine that with the slow ramp-up required to keep brain fog from turning you into a useless person, and you're looking at a month or two just to get to a stable dose and in to chronic treatment territory.  In short, you have to be committed to Memantine for a long time to even get to chronic treatment territory. This is not something you can (or should) try to cycle. It's a long term medication.   If you're using it for its normal benefits and the tolerance benefits, should you just not use any substances during the entire period you're taking this? I've seen several people talking about using it and still drinking coffee and what not. And then I've seen others say ""if you want to reset the tolerance for something don't take it while you're using memantine"". I can't go more than a few days without caffeine..   The stimulant tolerance-prevention effects are a bit dubious, honestly. Memantine may slow tolerance acquisition, but it's not going to stop or reverse tolerance. Only time can do that. It's not a reset button.  Furthermore, many people find that the brain fog from Memantine wipes out any benefits they may have gained from the stimulant in the first place, which makes it useless for them.  Finally, the ""tolerance reset"" isn't a universal feature, but rather related to NMDA interactions with certain dopaminergic pathways. As such, I don't think it applies to your coffee habit in the first place, as your adenosine system is probably quite dependent on caffeine and Memantine isn't about to change that. Again, time and tapering are your only actual solutions here.   The symptoms the first few days sound awful - fatigue, disorientation, brain fog, etc. I'm already tired as hell 24/7 so should I avoid this stuff or what?   In short, yes. The brain fog doesn't ever disappear from most accounts, save for a handful of anecdotes I've seen. Memantine is also notorious for destroying sleep quality (NMDA antagonists disrupt the SCN), which isn't going to do any favors for your fatigue issues."
Nootropics,3e2rna,PragmaticPulp,3,Tue Jul 21 18:05:11 2015 UTC,"Wow, thank you so much for that write-up. Very informative.  This brings up one of my fears about the nootropics community - a lot of people taking something that really has no benefit for them and then misinterpreting something else as a positive effect - like people talking about the depression lifting when really they might just be in the dissociative phase. I've seen quite a few people say it made them just ""stop caring"" about things that usually worry them so I'm sure you're correct there.  I'm fine with being a guinea pig but for some reason this one just really scares me. Especially considering the reports of lasting brain fog and cognitive decline that I've heard about from memantine."

Nootropics,3e2rna,PragmaticPulp,2,Tue Jul 21 19:43:58 2015 UTC,"Sorry, I should have been more clear: The brain fog appears to be intrinsically related to Memantine's mechanism of action. That is to say, it continues for the duration of the treatment, albeit not as significantly as during the the ramp-up period. Discontinuing Memantine (slowly) should result in a return to baseline eventually, although chronic NMDA antagonism is bound to produce some sort of long-term changes in the brain. The real question is what they are and how significant they might be."
Nootropics,3e2rna,ThePractice,3,Tue Jul 21 19:51:24 2015 UTC,"The authors of the ""Intense World Theory"" of autism suggest that memantine (as an NMDA antagonist) may be helpful in cases of autism and aspergers. (http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fnhum.2010.00224/abstract)"
Nootropics,3e2rna,EternalOptimist829,2,Tue Jul 21 18:46:18 2015 UTC,"It can be noted that memantine is an antagonist at alpha-7 nAChR, which may contribute to initial worsening of cognitive function during early memantine treatment. Alpha-7 nAChR upregulates quickly in response to antagonism, which could explain the cognitive-enhancing effects of chronic memantine treatment.  Memantine acts as an agonist at the dopamine D2 receptor  Memantine is a low-affinity voltage-dependent uncompetitive antagonist at glutamatergic NMDA receptors.  By binding to the NMDA receptor with a higher affinity than Mg2+ ions, memantine is able to inhibit the prolonged influx of Ca2+ ions, particularly from extrasynaptic receptors, which forms the basis of neuronal excitotoxicity."

I beleive alzheimers is mainly it's use although it's usually used along side other meds as it's mechanism of action is more neuroprotective And geared towards preventing further damage, as apposed to cognitive enhancment. Tolerance reduction will always work better if you stop a substance but if you take memantine along side a substance your tolerance will be lower tomorow than if you just took the substance. A full reset is difficult without stopping however. The period of treatment usually varies but is often atleast a month at a time. This has alot to do with it's 3 day half life. and the build up symptoms are in balance with intensity and duration. If you build up the levels in your body slowly with a low dose (like if you want 20mg, doing 5mg for a week first then 10 etc), they last longer but are much milder. But if you use a high dose to build up (like 20mg from day 1 or even 3 days of 20 before a 10mg schedule) they are more intense but over quicker. Overall its a great drug that leaves a bad first impression. The side effects are more apperant but go away where the benifits dont wane."

The directior of the project at one point, I beleive, was Steve Hsu (http://infoproc.blogspot.com/). The program is well under way and targets the genes, responsible for the intelligence. As far as I know, human intelligence is the by-product of the co-work of several hundred genes. The project aims to identify all of them and to improve human cognition via dna engineering (selection and incorporation of alleles, beneficial for intelligence, in the newborns and dna cleansing of mutational load (""bad genes""). There will be no miracle pill for human cognition - never -  our response to every medication is gene dependent and we  carry different sets of genes. The intelligence is usually considered to be a lack of mutational load in the individual and aggregation of genes, that code for cognition. If a had a million $, I would focus on the bottom 30% of human population. Anything that would add 1 SD to the IQ of the bottom 3rd would work miracles. It is not the top 1/3 that lacks it. Yet no pill would do the miracle. Only decrease of the mutational load.  If I am to give a $ 1 million for the advancement of human cognition I would give them to a university of my choice or I would create a grant with clear conditions - say, improvement of human cognition. We do not have the basic understanding of the mechanics of human cognition yet. Before we go up, we need to go deeper into our biology first. I would say, I would create a grant with the amount, available for the university research faculties, with the clear aim of the research, that would lead to advancement of human cognition. And I would let the universities fight for it. Let say, the aim of the grant would be the creation of a substance, that would improve the IQ of healthy volunteers with one standard deviation.

Keep it up until I have a convincing enough case to start pushing cognitive enhancers through clinical trials (which should go better as we know the doses required etc). Do it and make bankroll from all the stock I'm sitting on. Now the drugs are out on the market and can be used off label for lots of things (which goes to the goal of enhancing human cognition). Reinvest in new research on new compounds. Keep the cycle rolling as long as possible until the hammer drops, or until dozens of cognitive enhancers have flooded the market (especially since most will be late stage in terms of patents, they will go generic fast which will make for an interesting regulatory position).   Costs:  5-30k meeting with lawyer to find out best way to protect my ass and not end with the FDA stopping me early.  100-400k buying big enough chunks of these holding companies to show I'm serious enough to get to talk to someone who can give me a licensing deal.  100k- big enough synths that it's worth my time.  100k- testing those synths heavily enough that I can be confident in putting them in humans.  100k- setting up shop in AZ, drug packaging, storage and distribution, web pages, and a few employees to help me move on target doctors.   Rest of money: War chest or more synths. (maybe stretch and buy cheap patents?) (maybe provide these drugs to the poor?)"

You're partially right here, but the bigger picture here is that opioids just aren't an actual anxiety treatment. The underlying causes of the anxiety aren't addressed, and you'll quickly find yourself on the wrong end of the tolerance situation and worse off than where you started. It sounds like you're just barely starting to ramp up the dose, so I can't emphasize enough that you are headed straight-on toward addiction here. You want to end this now and find a real solution to your anxiety.   Mostly what I'm asking is: Does LDN make low-dose opioid therapy sustainable on a long-term basis? Does anyone have any considerations to point out for long-term low-dose opioids?   It will do something, but it's almost certainly not going to accomplish what you want. You're trying to experience the effects of opioid agonism here, so antagonizing those receptors is going to reduce that effect in the first place. It's just not a real solution, and it's not doing you any favors in the long run."

Any dose of Phenibut will downregulate the effected GABA receptors.  ""Reverse tolerance"" is a strange term to use, but perhaps they're probably referring to the phenomenon of sensitization, which is seem with certain drugs acting through certain pathways. To my knowledge, sensitization is not observed with GABA agonists."

Which I realize is generally bullshit but seems to be grounded in a bit of truth. Still though I am becoming less and less convinced this would do anything by the minute.   Correct, this does not apply to GABA systems as far as I know. Furthermore, sensitization isn't something you get control over. Usually the sensitization just tends to amplify side effects, not the core effect you're looking for.   Any thoughts on Facoracetam which is an antagonist? Would this actually do what I am trying to and upregulate my gaba receptors without problems   Pretty deep in to ""bad idea"" territory here, and probably not going to accomplish what you're looking for. Furthermore, it's never as simple as up/down regulating certain receptors, as the net effect depends on many downstream systems. Finally, just throwing an antagonist at a receptor doesn't necessarily upregulate it. Some receptors downregulate if any ligand binds, even antagonists, for example. GABA receptors are particularly complex.  Honestly, the only thing that will re-regulate your system is time and abstaining from phenibut. Phenibut is very bad news, particularly long term and high doses. I strongly recommend that you taper off, discard it, and never even think about touching it again."
Nootropics,3e3j2g,Lubb3r,2,Tue Jul 21 18:27:10 2015 UTC,I have only used phenibut twice.

I have abstained from all gaba agonists for 3-4 months at a time before in the last year and a half with 0 change in sleeping ability so I am kinda at the end of my rope.  I mentioned fasoracetam because there are numerous posts mentioning it lessening withdrawal symptoms from phenibut/benzos and anecdotal reports that speculate it up regulates gaba receptors  https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/35eas6/fasoracetam_gabab_upregulation/  http://www.bluelight.org/vb/threads/733142-Fasoracetam-and-gaba-receptor-recovery

It does appear to have mild to moderate anti-cholinergic effects, though, which are going to be counterproductive if you reach a dose where the anti-cholinergic effects become significant. Unfortunately I don't know that threshold might be.   (cycled, of course).   Just remember that cycling isn't actually a solution to tolerance or downregulation. Bromantane will down-regulated the relevant systems, which will have a decreased tone for a while once you discontinue. This is true for even a single dose. In other words, just don't forget that you must always pay it back with below-baseline performance at some point in the future.  Also worth mentioning: Bromantane is more akin to a powerful pharmaceutical drug than a typical nootropic supplement. Be very careful here, because this isn't a harmless compound."

When I'm feeling particularly clouded, I take 100 - 200mg when I first wake up, along with some food (on an empty stomach, it gives me nausea). After an 45 minutes to an hour later, I feel a very noticable improvement in my mood, and feel more like myself. It lasts for a few hours, then subsides. I never felt the need to take more after the effects subside, because by then I have had enough energy to overcome depression inertia.  Heads up: Like most drugs, 5HTP's effects come at a cost. Diverting resources to manufacture serotonin WILL deplete the resources needed to keep other important chemicals in balance. Your brain is a precariously balanced system, and fucking with that system should be done with care.  If I use 5HTP for longer than 2 weeks, my brain starts to feel fried, and it stops having the desired effect. I calk this up to depleting my supply of dopamine, or the necessary materials to synthesize it. I tried taking L-Tyrosine as part of a stack, as an offset, but that only buys me another week before I start feeling kinda worn out.  In short, it helps me for short bursts, to peel back from depression and feel like myself. Then I leave it alone for a month.

Eventually by chance I figured out that it was the 5-HTP. Once I suspected it, I did a few tests including opening up a capsule, mixing contents with a little water, and using that to do a skin prick test.   I had a terrible reaction to it. It made my eczema go nuts and my eyes to puff up and leak. They're still hyper sensitive, but things have improved massively since stopping two weeks ago. I don't know of any other food allergy, and as far as I know I'm not allergic to anything else in the Fabacea family. The supplement form of 5-HTP is almost always made from the plant Griffonia simplicifolia which is a member of the Fabacea or Legume/bean/pea family.   The lesson for me is to be careful with any of this stuff. Luckily for me, I had started to keep a daily journal this year, so once I was suspicious of the 5-HTP, I was lucky enough to be able to go back through my journal and discover that the dates of me starting to use 5-HTP and starting to get my terrible allergies aligned exactly!

They blogged about it last year:   The spice Crocus sativus, also known as Saffron, has been added to the Examine.com database. This expensive spice has several surprises up its sleeve, including a set of unique molecules and an ability to combat depression.  Saffron contains a group of molecules called carotenoids that are water soluble, but only in the context of saffron. Normally, carotenoids are fat soluble.  Repeated human trials have concluded that saffron is effective at treating depression, when taken at the standard dose (30mg a day for eight weeks). Its potency is comparable to several prescription drugs.  Research has yet to determine how exactly Saffron achieves this effect. Preliminary evidence suggests it manipulates serotonin signalling, but the exact mechanism has yet to be pinpointed. Prudent supplementation is advised, because saffron can become toxic to the body if used improperly. Doubling the standard dose and time frame (60mg for sixteen weeks) can do damage to the body. Until there is more evidence for saffron’s effects and toxicity, care should be taken during supplementation.   So, it doesn't really look like it's a nootropic, but potentially useful for short term treatment if the risks/warnings are heeded."

Nootropics,3dw3yp,Coma-,4,Mon Jul 20 15:09:20 2015 UTC,"does the body produce testosterone at the level it did before supplementation   Roughly there are 3 glans that produce relevant hormones: pic.  Actually it's more complex than this, but this is good enough simplification for 95% of the cases.  When you have exogenous testosterone, those glans stop producing their hormones and they begin to atrophy.  With testes it's the easiest to notice and people who have been on TRT for a long while can see their testicles decrease to the size of raisins.  Now if you stop ""supplementing"" it will slowly return to normal.  The longer you've been on those supplements the longer would it take to recover.  To make an analogy -- imagine you have broken an arm and have it put into a cast for a while.  Once you take the cast off you'll notice that your arm muscles atrophied a lot.  In a while those muscles would restore their strength back to the normal levels, but they wouldn't overcompensate.  In a year after taking off the cast you'll be effectively as good as if you hadn't broken your arm.  Would it be better not breaking the arm in the first place?  Absolutely.  But not everything is as simple.  People do use so called PCT (Post-Cycle Therapy) to help HPTA recover much faster.

Nootropics,3dw3yp,Keninishna,3,Mon Jul 20 23:53:00 2015 UTC,"For perspective, I am 20 years old. I did about a year of research before deciding to supplement. The biggest deciding factors were 1) The western world contains massive amounts of xenoestrogens so if im taking in external estrogen I see adding tesosterone as simply combating the effects of industralization (western mens tesosterone levels have dropped about 70% over the last century) and 2) When people talk about growth plates closing from steroids they are talking about Testosterone aromatizing since estrogen fuses the plates and so if you prevent aromatization (run an aromatase inhibitor) you prevent growth plates from closing. All the effects of exogenous T supplementation are reversible - similar to OP's reply to your comment your HPTA gets shut down but can be restarted. You can even have children on cycle no problem - your sperm count does get lowered as a statistical average (most do but some suffer no lowered sperm count at all, just luck of the draw I guess) but its a misconception that its impossible to have kids on cycle.   There are protocols called PCT (Post cycle therapy) which are used to kickstart your HPTA once you get off cycle. The other method, which I wouldnt suggest until you've had kids and are around 28-30 is B&C, blast and cruise, where you never come off you just switch between super high doses of 500mg-1g/week to 100-150mg/week. 100-150mg/week still puts you around 1200-1500 ng/dL which is the upper limits of natty. Something to keep in mind is that many bodybuilding legends ran steroids from the ages of 14 and never came off yet suffered no ill health effects (yet anyway) the most notable example being Arnold Schwarzenegger.  I'd be happy to answer questions on how it has impacted me from running at a younger age."

He doesn't mention using them until he had been competing for at least a few years, while he was in his 20s. I highly doubt he was using them in his teens. Based on how remote his hometown was, the lack of bodybuilding influences in his life, and his service in the military, it is highly unlikely he was using the rare and cutting edge PEDs of that golden age of bodybuilding. Go look at photos of him in his teens. You don't need steroids to get to that level.. not even close. He was quite far away from his genetic limit."

Having extra testosterone in your body can switch off production of luteinizing hormone and follicle stimulating hormone in the pituitary gland, which results in less testosterone production in the testes.   Also, there are hormones that are made by the heart. Atrial natriuretic peptide is one. Endocrinology is complicated, so it stands to reason that there could be some mechanism that results in the heart getting screwed up one way or another, because it seems like all the hormones work in concert with each other.   Thyroid hormones can affect the heart. Hormones made in the thymus can indirectly affect the heart, by raising and lowering calcium levels."

The side effects will be a lot more severe - acne, hair loss, high BP, lipids going to shit if you slack on cardio, etc. You'll also have to invest in something to manage your estrogen or you risk getting side effects such as gyno.  From my own experience, I was rather disappointed by supraphysiological doses. Perhaps I expected too much from it, I thought I'd turn into a crazy confident, social god. That didn't happen.

Combined with aromatase inhibitors to keep any extra estrogen from floating around and causing bad side effects and you're set for a clean cycle.  THen at the end you taper off with a nice SERM or two for post-cycle therapy and it's crazy how little hassle it can be.  But it's a lot harder on some people so there's that, and it's something only someone dedicated to the idea should partake in (like getting a tattoo).

If you do it without doctors supervision you'll have to procure Schedule 3 controlled substances, which is orders of magnitude harder than buying some herb extracts off amazon.  You'll have to deal with shady dealers or send money via wester-union overseas.  It makes sense for people who compete in sports (or at least are very serious about it) or for people who are very serious about being huge.  No doctor would put you on TRT with your levels.  Your levels are only one standard deviation below mean, which is well within the healthy range.  Would you say that a 5'7"" guy is unhealthily short and needs life long medical support?  Your absolutely best bet is to figure out why your levels are so low.  Unless you have some real medical condition, increasing your testosterone levels should be pretty easy.  Are you sure your organs are healthy (particularly liver and pancreas)?  Do you sleep enough?  Are you stressed too much?  Do you eat enough protein?  Are you eating enough fatty foods?  You body creates testosterone from cholesterol.  Do you exercise correctly?  For example lifting weights increases testosterone, doing too much cardio decreases testosterone.  Overtraining is bad.  Are you getting enough sun light?  If not, you should be supplementing with Vitamin D.  Are you getting enough Zinc in your diet?  Consider taking some good sports multivitamin.  Finally, you can take clomid to stimulate your body to make more testosterone.  But yeah.  Being a big guy was insanely helpful for attracting girls.  I'm something like 5'10-5'11"", and at peak I was 205 lbs with around 10% bodyfat (I had a visible six pack).  I got stared at in bars.  Women started initiating small talk conversations with me.

Yeah, as a 25 year old man, 450 ng/dL might mathematically be within the mean, BUT, that is because the metrics used are complete shit! We define anywhere from 300-1000 as the ""average"" levels, and that ranges from young 20's men to men in their 80s. What should be normal for a 25 year old is what should be OPTIMAL - 800+, period.

My regiment? 21mg (.21cc) Sub Q Depo-T twice a week, this is very low compared to most people. I don't take any aromatase inhibitor, DHEA, pregnenolone, HCG, clomid, or any of the other 'essentials' the internet and Dr's commonly recommend. I have no acne, no hair loss, full size testicles, no erection issues, daily morning wood, putting on a ton of muscle, 12% body fat. Seriously, keep things simple. Unless you're willing to attempt the crazy balancing act of all the forcefully altered hormones in your body, you'll eventually start to feel terrible. I'm not just talking about acne etc, but anxiety and other deep mental/cognitive stuff. Check out user reports relating to unbalanced estrogen, both high and low cause a slew of issues and balancing through aromatase inhibitors is a complicated and very unnatural process. That's just one of many that will be impacted by increased dosage.  Anyways, if you browse certain forums looking for answers you'll notice many say ""huge doses"" and add a bunch of pointless pieces to the puzzle in an attempt to balance out the havoc you're putting your body through.

My total T was a little over 400 after a major surgery and I had the same idea, to take T for depression/ADHD reasons.    My little experiment didn't pan out the way I would've liked.  Yes, I did get a dopamine blast in the beginning, but it was pretty much the same feeling I had with selegiline in the beginning.  My depression was exacerbated because I aromatized to estrogen like crazy.  I tried test cyp with various dose timing, with and without HCG, and using arimidex.  Arimidex would crash my e2 even with 1/4 mg, leaving me in a deep, dark place.  High E2 gave me erectile dysfunction, and extreme anger and hypomania.  I decided it wasn't worth it, I wasn't making gains in the gym any better than natural, and my inconsistent moods, insomnia, depression, were really screwing up my life.  So I said screw it, I'm going to do an HPTA restart and be done with it.  I'm done using any substances that cause HPTA shutdown, which includes SARMS.  I've begun a restart protocol, just finished HCG, and have been using nolvadex.  I am adding Clomid tomorrow.  Hopefully I don't feel too crappy for the next couple months.  Last year I tested my T at 605 and I was ill at the time, and I feel significantly better since that time period, so I'm hoping that I'm in the 800s after my HPTA restart.

The orals really fucked my liver and stomach up but I had similar effects to people I know who inject test and do cycles and post.  The first few weeks I was sleeping like a king, really social, high energy, high sex drive, etc. About halfway through I was still sleeping like a king and had a high sex drive but I became really antisocial and had anxiety. Basically if someone's body language walking up to me didn't look natural and stupid I was really judgmental and didn't want to talk to anyone unless they were doing something for me. So yea motivation, energy, and focus were definitely up but I would say anxiety for me went a big higher. I think I was very hyper aware of people around me, and also I think a few people knew that I was gaining quickly so maybe I was thinking if they knew that I was currently taking the juice.  Also I think I became very selfish during that time period.  Like I would have the opportunity to have sex with attractive women and felt like if they had nothing to offer me then I wasn't even down for it.  Too much testosterone was good during the period of life growth I was going through though  I did it during a time I was only taking 9 credits at college and I just checked that I got 3 B's so I'm not sure what they did for me mentally. However I was hitting the gym like 2-3 times PER DAY on average every single day with no days off. I would wake up and literally jump around and yell and I was restless in the gym. The best moments were where you are caught in the pump at like your average weight but your body doesn't say no and you get caught in the pump for like 45 seconds and you drop the weight and you feel light headed and god like.  Sorry if my thoughts are a bit chopped up but this is what I remember.

That there's some genetic limit you have to reach first? Or that there's a certain number of years of training and good diet that should be hit first? I've seen this a few times but I've never seen any hard evidence explaining why.
Nootropics,3dw3yp,deadkactus,5,Mon Jul 20 11:28:51 2015 UTC,"Slightly off topic but I think I can help.  There's no hardline rule saying whether someone should or shouldn't use them before a certain age. There is no scientific basis behind that.  The idea is that it's really fucking dumb and reckless to hop on an extremely powerful compound for fitness purposes if you haven't done your due diligence and learned about the body, how to train it, how to rest it, and how to feed it.  I have my diet absolutely dialed in. I have my exercise programs absolutely dialed in. I get good rest. If I didn't have these things figured out prior to hopping on steroids, then I'd be wasting my time and money while also risking side effects like high estrogen."
Nootropics,3dw3yp,ender1944,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:23:25 2015 UTC,Huh that's really interesting. Well thank you for your response! I'm interested in the fact that there's no scientific evidence stating that steroids at a young age disrupts hormone production. Isn't testosterone and GH production the highest around ages 16-21? Or somewhere around there? Or is this just more broscience?
Nootropics,3dw3yp,deadkactus,3,Mon Jul 20 01:31:34 2015 UTC,"Oh, it definitely disrupts testosterone production. I don't think it does long term, though. There aren't any studies I know of detailing this, but there are plenty of studies detailing the fact that PCTs can restore normal function, or elevate normal function for the duration of administration.  Yeah, IIRC, testosterone production is highest until you're about thirty, and then it declines by a percent or two each year afterwards, unless you lift weights, in which case you will have a higher baseline testosterone production no matter what."

Nootropics,3dw3yp,Smackugood,2,Mon Jul 20 03:13:07 2015 UTC,"I am 20 years old and currently on cycle however I have been lifting consistently (never missed more than a week due to vacation or injury and lifted around 270 days out of the year) for 5 years.   In a perfect world yes you should reach your genetic limit before using steroids - steroids shouldn't be used as a short cut to hitting your genetic limit but used to surpass it. I'd say less than 5% of steroid users actually hit their genetic limit before starting however as I likely would not have hit mine until I was 30 if I had started at 15. The rate at which muscle is added decreases until you are lucky to be putting on a couple pounds per year. The first year you lift is the year you have the most muscle gains naturally, every year after that is down hill.   Establishing good training/diet is reccomended solely because of the discipline aspect. On AAS I tend not to give a shit and am much more impulsive, already having the habits of good eating and gym attendance makes it a routine to go otherwise I'd rather do something else. Plus, you won't get nearly the same benefits if you have 0 training/diet experience and start AAS. Weightlifting is more than just picking things up, you have to feel the muscle contract and swell with blood. If you don't know how to build muscle naturally you won't be able to do it as efficiently on AAS since you have no idea what works.  On AAS even not working out you will gain muscle - there was a study where there were 4 groups observed over several months. Group 1) No test/Didn't work out - 0 lbs muscle gained. Group 2) No test/Did work out - 4 lbs muscle gained. Group 3) Test/Didn't work out - 7lbs muscle gained Group 4) Test/Worked out - 14lbs muscle gained. I can't find the study now but its been posted in r/steroids.   It all comes down to you will build muscle more efficiently on AAS if you already have a good diet/know how to work out. AAS isn't unhealthy per se but it definetly isn't healthy for you either and so you want to be getting the most benefit out of use you can if you are on cycle"

I think there are some non-peptides that all increase appetite as well. Honestly though it wouldn't be worth it for you. You just need to learn to how to eat more. Lots of people do it so if you just force yourself to eat more you will gain weight. There are lots of diets out there designed for exactly that purpose anyway.

Allow me to save you months or years of suffering, psychological pain, and suffering, and let me tell you this: not all doctors are made equal.  That treatment your doctor is offering you, the DHEA? That is the most bullshit treatment of low T I have ever heard of. I mean, honestly speaking, it is fucking pathetic and will not do a thing for your T levels. You can pick up DHEA at vitamin shoppe. You don't need a prescription for it.  People tend to be dogmatic about testosterone. It is misunderstood and there is a lot of hearsay floating around. Everyone seems to think they're an expert on it, but I've slowly realized that very few people actually know what they're talking about with it. I mean, my first GP and endocrinologist couldn't have been more ignorant, and they're fucking medical professionals, for crying out loud.

However, the bigger concern here is that you've always had underlying brain fog issues, yet you're taking prescription medications (tianeptine) on an ad-hoc basis and mixing it with bing drinking. You need to be getting a proper handle on your underlying conditions, and skip the binge drinking until you do. Or skip it forever, for your health. Self-medicating with tianeptine is not a solution.

Clonidine has a pretty mild effect, I don't think it's placebo but I can't be certain.  It also has some annoying side effects, so I'd like to get rid of that, and will talk to my doctor about it next time I go in.  I take ashwagandha every day and got a mild but noticeable reduction in anxiety from that.  I take phenibut occasionally for anxiety, but not often because I'm worried about the addictive properties.  Once or twice a week tops.  Baclofen is pretty similar, but prescription, so it's a little harder to just order.  I'm going to talk to my doctor about the possibility of gabapentin next time I go in as well.  I have full-body pain with no currently known physiological cause, (I follow up with a rheumatologist next week,) and I suspect it's caused by anxiety and stress.  Gabapentin might help with that.  Edit- just read an abstract about a trial with sulforaphane with ASD patients, very interesting.  Edit the second-  I've also tried tianeptine; I used that for about six months, but stopped when I got the clonidine prescription because of its known interactions with tricyclics.  I'm pretty sure tianeptine itself doesn't interact with clonidine, but it's not legal in the US so I couldn't ask a medical professional about it.  Tianeptine had moderate effects on my mood and anxiety; I'd say the ashwagandha I'm taking now is probably a little better.  When I was younger I was prescribed effexor, wellbutrin, and either prozac or paxil, can't remember which.  None of them really did anything.

Time is also obviously a factor, since the longer they're exposed the more of a problem there is. Are you mixing these together before going to the gym? I doubt you'll have a problem. Are you trying to mix together a week's or a month's worth all at once? I'd suspect that you would have some issues, since at the very least it would probably turn into a clumpy brick at the bottom if you left it sitting too long.  This isn't something that people really test a lot and while my knowledge of chem is OK, it's not good enough to really peg something like this.

Based upon what I've read around here, it seems like they're quite the patent troll. Despite that, I don't see why we don't have at least one public vendor selling it. I used to oversee a legal department run at an internet company, and we used to regularly get cease & desist notices from various companies (many in the fortunate 500) suggesting we close down or change our website/business to stop ""infringing"" on them. We easily spotted the bluff, however, and simply thanked them for their notices, made no changes, and awaited the ""lawsuit"" to come. As expected, the supposed ""lawsuit"" did not ever come to fruition (though they did take to sending more notices, I suppose in hopes we'd change our mind).   I'm not familiar with the business practices or ideology of Neuralstem, but I would be willing to bet that these threats are bluffs. To be honest with you, I don't think it would be much of a risk at all to begin selling it -- unless a significant danger is posed to these sort of companies, they will likely just threaten and send their notices. I certainly understand that each vendor picks and chooses their own risks, but there is a lot of demand for NSI-189, and from what I can tell, little supply. If anyone has a source for NSI-189, I am very interested -- please send me a message."

We planned for the resistance training to increase progressively, across the 12 weeks, from moderate to high intensity.

Sometimes skipping a day, so Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday, Saturday Sunday off.  After a few weeks of this I started to notice some withdrawl. So on the above schedule, the Saturday and Sunday would be a little jittery and shakey, but this is also a result of heavy drinking, and even still, it's almost worth having three perfect days to have a couple rough ones.

Edit: Here's what I found on longecity -   HED (mg/kg) = Animal Dose (mg/kg) x [Animal Km / Human Km]  Human Km = 37  Mouse Km = 3  Rat Km = 6  So... HED in this case would be = 200 mg/kg * 6/37 ~= 32 mg/kg.   That would be ~2.2 g of Curcumin in a 70kg man.   Edit2: Now, the next question I have is how much turmeric standardized to 95% curcuminoids I would need to take to get to that 32 mg/kg dose."

I can't do this job without drugs, I think. I really want and need this, but I'm also very lazy and definitely socially weird, so I'm pushing myself. Pheni is like wall-hack, though, really makes everything do-able, as opposed to not at all.  I'm not planning on abusing any new substance quite yet, but the prospect of long-term Phenibut usage is not appealing. I feel sort of 'drunk' on it, my short-term memory has deteriorated, and my decision-making skills are very much below optimal, especially when 'high' on Pheni. I'm pretty sure much of my behavior can be described as manic while on it. But it feels very good.  Picamilon doesn't seem to do much for me. Any alternative suggestion is appreciated.

Usually involving lots of anger/sadness/depression/extremely suicidal thoughts. It's very strange. The first time it happened I wrote it off as coincidence. But I tried it again several months later (completely different bottle/batch) with almost the exact same results. I have not read of this happening to anyone else (not that I've researched it effecting emotions in depth, but I have read tons of stories of people using it, mostly people raving about it).  Note that I am self diagnosed depressed, and suicide is something that I think about (not seriously, just thoughts, since age 8 ffs) almost daily... but this was something else entirely. We're talking full melt down. It was like the full weight and understanding of the fact that everything is pointless was just bombarding me and making me feel it on a whole new level. If I could somehow, some way, channel this into positive thoughts, I think I'd be almost super human.  Not sure if this will get downvoted because I know it's a popular substance and my instance is not the norm, but you asked for negatives regarding Semax, so there you go.  Also, while obviously taking any advice from reddit with multiple grains of salt, anyone have any idea what the fuck might cause this sort of thing? Like how fucked up am I that it caused this to happen? lol  I wasn't taking any noots the 1st time, though I was smoking a little bit of weed around that time period. I had taken adderall a week or so prior as well. The only constant with the second time was weed once again. But I've never heard of a negative interaction with the two despite both being relatively popular and seeing other stories of people combining them with no problem. obviously everyone is different though, so who knows."

I felt so alienated, I felt that my brain just functioned so differently to everyone else that it would be impossible for me to be a member of society.

Nootropics,3dt8e8,arachnd,4,Mon Jul 20 08:09:33 2015 UTC,"A negative reaction to marijuana like that suggests to me that you have high cortisol. If this is the case, there is a very good chance that SEMAX will help you, as will exercise if you aren't already.  It isn't well-known that marijuana use acutely boosts stress hormone levels. For people who have low cortisol, this is great and they might not even get some of the negative emotional side effects that others get. If you have high cortisol; the paranoia and other negative sides should be a lot more pronounced.  As you may have seen in the discussion, SEMAX is theorized to lower cortisol release in humans, and has been shown to attenuate levels in rats. There is a good chance you would benefit from it.  Not that I haven't gotten feelings like that on weed before. I guess for me, part of the therapy of that herb is getting those sorts of feelings and coming to peace with them. It really helped me with my social anxiety when I was younger: it's like the fact that I had caused the anxiety gave me a better sense of control over it, giving me a consequence-free simulation of feelings I would have later with a new sense of perspective and clarity."

NASEMAXA also seems to accrue a tolerance with time, the opposite of what happens with SEMAX.  Most people don't have negative reactions to either drug. If I hadn't, I'd be recommending the SEMAX. The NASEMAXA is better geared for occasional use, since it exhibits effects on the first day.

Serotonin is what makes you feel sick of food when you've eaten too much: take those levels high enough when you are just trying to get through life, and it will make you just as sick of more life as you can feel sick of more food: serotonin is trying to tell you you've had enough; a bad reaction when it's applying itself to life as a whole.  I would recommend you try a sage supplement and see if that helps you.

Nootropics,3dt8e8,iamgoingbald666,3,Sun Jul 19 11:54:16 2015 UTC,"That sounds somewhat obsessive compulsive.  Sometimes suicidal thoughts aren't suicidal as much as they are frustrated and violent.

I'm no doctor though, to me you're starting to get into ""see a doctor"" territory.  There's just so many other options for depressions out there.

I'll go a few days without a care in the world (that's hyperbole, but relatively..), then suddenly, suicide seems like the only option for a day or so. But it's one of those things where it's easier to notice when something is wrong as opposed to when things are working as intended, so it FEELS like I'm suicidal most days even if it's actually a minority of days that I feel that way.

At the end of the day I went to dinner with some friends and something was sorta off. I ended up having a good time (maybe better than normal).   Next day I tried to repeat the results. It didn't work as well as I'd hoped. Essentially I had too much coffee and was zonked.  I should mention that for both days that I took NASA I couldn't get to bed very easily.

I take it first thing in the morning and it provides a feeling of having woken up rested, as opposed to having taken something stimulating. The most peculiar thing with it (which I've seen mentioned a few times) is that you don't feel like you've taken anything, but at the end of the day you look back and realize your day was far more productive than normal.  The best way I can describe the feeling I get is that I feel more present.  Also, this may sound weird but my decision making is somewhat wiser. I'll decide upon things that are better for me. For instance, I've come to realize that I seldom skip meditating or exercise on the days I've dosed with it.   Someone called Selank meditation in a bottle, I call Semax wisdom in a bottle :P"

Nootropics,3dt8e8,coupdevent,2,Sun Jul 19 19:03:05 2015 UTC,"I think the nootropic effects are what makes me feel more present. It's not as evident as oxiracetam for instance but I would say that it makes a difference.  Again, it's very unique in so far as when I take it, I really do not feel like I've taken anything (there is no perceived before and after even if I pay attention), yet I feel improvements. It's a weird dichotomy that I cannot explain and that no other substance has exposed me to."
Nootropics,3dt8e8,1sabeau,2,Sun Jul 19 23:59:17 2015 UTC,"Thanks for answering! Apparently the stimulant effects taper off in time, but it's been said that the nootropic qualities actually build over time. I guess what I'm wondering is whether or not you feel like you've successfully made your brain permanently better off, specifically through neurogenesis and elevated BDNF levels and BDNF sensitivity."

The reason I'm using nootropics is that I've been sick in the last years, with huge brain fog, however I'm getting healthier by the minute, thus recovering my brain functions :) Is it the nootropics, is it the health improvement or is today simply shiny? :P"
Nootropics,3dt8e8,samlljc,2,Mon Jul 20 15:37:05 2015 UTC,Anybody get downsides from long term Semax use? What about positive things?
Nootropics,3dt8e8,coupdevent,3,Sun Jul 19 18:40:43 2015 UTC,"I've taken regular Semax, NASEMAX and NASEMAXA pretty much everyday for a couple of months. I initially went the sub-q route but later switched to the intranasal MOA that u/Debonaire_Death has popularized.  The effects were initially all positive -- improved energy, focus and a general sense of well-being. Another benefit seemed to be improved social confidence particularly with regular use; although I cannot be certain if it was due to the semax or any of the other nootropics I was also taking. Semax, and its variants, also seemed to work even when I was sleep deprived and didn't seem to have a noticeable come-down.  As the months progressed, however, it seemed that I would experience a crash after dosing semax that would leave me quite tired rather abruptly. Re-dosing semax would give me a fresh boost of energy; but at the cost of progressively worse come-downs and what appeared to be a growing tolerance (not to mention the increased monetary expense of using more semax).  Keep in mind that I cannot say if these negative side effects were directly due to the semax. I (ab)used semax during a period when I had a ton of project deadlines I needed to meet, so I was both sleep-deprived and using other stimulants in conjunction with the semax. It is also likely that I was using way too much semax than is recommended.  These days, I take semax sporadically and seem to experience mostly positive effects; although the magnitude of these effects do not match my first few uses of semax.   What I do now, and what I find more sustainable for a daily regimen, is to do some cardio in the morning prior to going to work. Several people have reported on this sub how using semax subjectively feels like the afterglow from a good workout. My experience with doing daily cardio has mirrored their impression of semax in this aspect, with the concomitant benefit of also helping me stay alert throughout my workday, although I surmise that semax, and its variants, probably have a greater effect on focus than the bdnf release from cardio exercise does."
Nootropics,3dt8e8,samlljc,2,Mon Jul 20 04:42:04 2015 UTC,"Did you gain any permanent positive effects? I'm guessing you don't really notice any.  Also, some people say that their tolerance decreased with use. Others say that the nootropic effects compound over time. You're saying this wasn't the case for you, right?"
Nootropics,3dt8e8,1sabeau,3,Mon Jul 20 04:45:10 2015 UTC,"Well, its really quite hard to say whether I gained anything permanently from chronic semax use. While I seem to be more socially confident these days, I have also been deliberately practicing my social skills and affecting a more confident outlook, but semax might well have contributed positively to this. I also seem to have less fatigue these days, but it could really be because I try to sleep better and because of my healthier lifestyle.   So I guess what I'm really saying is that my experience was too confounded with the other happenings in my life to attribute any permanent gains to semax; likewise with regard to my lifestyle and perceived semax tolerance. However, as logically indefensible as I know this sounds, I don't think I've incurred any permanent negative effects from chronic semax use aside from a smaller bank account.   As with all nootropics, YMMV. Sorry I can't be more helpful!"
Nootropics,3dt8e8,coupdevent,2,Mon Jul 20 04:57:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah, ideally you'd like to try a nootropic in a vaccuum and analyze it to death but the need to use them is usually when life gets disco, making that pretty much impossible :/"

There are always risks involved in trying a new delivery method and the effects may be different.  I can't find any information on the vaporization or combustion temperature of dihexa, but you would want to find this to make sure it did not combust and form potentially dangerous products. It could still form dangerous products if you vaporize it below its combustion temperature."
Nootropics,3duhip,SPUDGEIST,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:41:34 2015 UTC,The normal ROA (I'm guessing you mean oral) is hardly bioavailable at all - there is literature that supports this. I'm interested in trying new methods to find the most effective way to consume it (besides IV'ing it) because I believe that this may be the reason why not many people seem to have decent results from it (when taken orally)

I was mixing it with glucodin and snorting it for a while until I read that due to its hydrophobicity it is a completely ineffective route. I have also IM'd it into my thigh after diluting with DMSO (ouch) - again, which I later read from literature is about an 8% bioavailable route.

Nootropics,3duhip,dz93,3,Sun Jul 19 16:59:48 2015 UTC,"It wasn't a joke, it's much easier and more predictable than vaporizing. You should look into it. What about sublingual though?"

Nootropics,3dop8o,Debonaire_Death,8,Sat Jul 18 16:18:29 2015 UTC,"What was your ROA? I found it even better sublingually. Faster onset without a shorter duration of effect. The powder isn't the best solute, but dropping another solution or tincture on top of it after a few minutes really seemed to help carry it into the body and I would feel effects within an hour of taking it. I've actually been experimenting a lot lately with using tinctures and solutions as carriers for sublingually-administered powders, and I've been getting some good results.  My serotonin runs high, which was probably a factor in my preferences, but I found bromantane to be the shit with tianeptine. I can get strange bouts of lethargy from it otherwise, and reinforcement of the dopaminergic aspects of the drug really kicked it's motivational boost into impressive territory.  As far as coming off of bromantane or developing a tolerance to it, I just found that my body just needed a physical break from the stuff. I was obviously capable of pushing my body and mind further than they are normally capable of, and after a few weeks of doing that it just felt like high time to give it a rest.  What I didn't expect, especially considering how heavily monoaminergic it seemed to be while on it, was that going off bromantane cold turkey (instead I had an adaptogenic tonic I've been experimenting with called Rebbl) was a wonderful experience. I suppose it might have been downregulating some receptors in my system that normally give me trouble, but the first day without either the bromantane or tianeptine my mood, motivation, and outlook were great. It's one of the best cold-turkey experiences I've ever had.  You're having trouble measuring out 50mg? I would recommend ordering some red microscoops from PowderCity. They're life-savers for handling tiny amounts held in awkward containers. If you don't have a scale, get one. There are some cheap ones that work relatively well for the price (linked is what I use)."

Nootropics,3dop8o,theskepticalidealist,2,Sat Jul 18 15:22:31 2015 UTC,https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bromantane  Bromantane (aka Ladasten) is a a stimulant drug that was developed in Russia in the 80's. It has anxiolytic properties.  So basically it's a stimulant that reduces your anxiety. Which is really unique.  Available at Ceretropic.
Nootropics,3dop8o,onecrap,2,Sat Jul 18 18:28:23 2015 UTC,"It's weird but I get barely any noticeable effects at all from bromantane and I've even tried taking 150mg sublingually.

I guess it's just not for me, like how my sisters husband doesn't get much of anything from modafinil despite taking 400mg.   Someone in these comments compared bromantane to phenylpiracetam which I find weird because I love phenylpiracetam. If it wasn't for the fast tolerance buildup and it being (strangely) expensive I find it on par with, if not better than, modafinil. It feels like it makes the fog pass and gives me a clear head."

By the end of my trial I was using one tenth of what I had originally started with (1mg) to get the same effects, and the side effects persisted for days afterwards. Higher doses didn't worse the side effects very much, too, so they seemed to have a pretty low ceiling for unpleasantness.  I had a much better experience with intranasal NASEMAXA. I'm still trying to figure out what went so wrong with the SEMAX. I have gotten my cortisol tested while on NASEMAXA and it tested extremely low and I tested normal after I went off of it 6 weeks later, so there is a chance it lowers cortisol in humans and that, perhaps, the subQ SEMAX was lowering my cortisol so much that it was affecting my health."

Phenlypiracetam has had the same effect for me, more mild though. Kinda like I wanted everything but could only do a little. Need to lower dose and don't combine it with anything stimulating. Might try some Theanine with it.   Careful with the Phenibut man. Notorious for withdrawals and addiction. Tolerance as well. Limit use to once a week imo, you can sometimes get by with twice though.

I'm intellectually interested in this kind of stuff, but often have to force myself to engage with it (and often feel like a fraud, because my baseline desire is to gorge on crappy TV etc.).

Nootropics,3dlry2,jimmythegreek1,9,Fri Jul 17 11:15:59 2015 UTC,"Caffeine is one of the few stimulants I'm aware of that acutely improves liver function--why it's so prized for use in intermittent fasting regimens.  You definitely don't want to let tolerance get out of hand: adenosine receptors are very important and worth keeping around--but it is by no means a dangerous drug if it isn't being handled in it's anhydrous powder form (in which case it is a very dangerous drug). I certainly wouldn't discourage anyone from using it in moderate doses for a few-month cycle.  The major concerns while on it are that it takes a toll on peripheral circulation, blood pressure, and hydration. Just drink more water and be sure to keep exercising and everything should be fine. I haven't read it, but the book you are referencing sounds like it is targeted to less-informed people who unknowingly grow dependent on caffeine. Caffeine dependence can be bad and should be avoided.   Coffee has even more going for it than just caffeine: namely the MAOI ß-carbolines harman and norharman. There have been rat studies where ß-carbolines increased nicotine self-administration. In general, it seems to enhance the addictiveness of other compounds, and I wouldn't be surprised if a similar dynamic is playing out with caffeine in the human body.  Coffee is definitely something I use much less frequently than caffeine in general, and I find it has a very strong effect all its own. ß-carbolines are also inverse benzodiazepine agonists, so I could see that causing GABA adaptations that would lead to a more pronounced feeling of inertia during withdrawal as opposed to caffeine alone (I'm no expert, though)."

For instance, they've shown caffeine to reduce spontaneous DNA strand breaks by a decent amount, to subtly activate certain highly metabolically beneficial pathways, such as CREB/SIRT3/AMPK, to induce hepatic lipophagy and generally reduce hepatic fat accretion (probably via SIRT3/AMPK), and so on. Though it can promote anxiety in genetically prone individuals, that side effect isn't very ubiquitous unless consumed in excess. Furthermore, speaking of mental health, there's a few studies also showing it to mitigate incidence of alzheimer's, parkinson's, and so on, as well as protect against certain neural derangements stress puts forth (via its effect on the adenosine system). On top of all this, it's highly ergogenic via promoting Ca2+ release from the SR and sparing glycogen, plus it's generally been shown to improve insulin sensitivity. Aka caffeine = wonderful.

Coffee and caffeine intake is also associated with a lower risk of elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT) activity in persons at high risk for liver injury.  Daily coffee consumption is also correlated with a substantially lower risk of type 2 diabetes.

After all, ppl can become addicted to exercise chasing that next runner's high. Shit, I wish I was addicted to exercise. To be honest there is really zero urge to redose caffeine either once you've reached the desired effect i.e. stimulated. Its not like cocaine where the next line is always on your mind. There is no doubt that caffeine tolerance and withdrawals is legit but the mainstream opinion is that it's very tolerable. I drank coffee every day for couple years then just quick one day and didn't even notice it. so I am pro-caffeine for use as a safe stimulant."

I was addicted to the stuff for several years (moreso to avoid the withdrawal headaches than anything else) and finally decided to quit three months ago.  The first two weeks were hell, but after that I instantly felt less depressed, less anxious overall, less overtly exhausted all the time, and my singing range even went up by like three notes.

The only risks are mild to moderate addiction (dependent on genetics, some quickly develop tolerance and addiction, while others do not), possibly triggering anxiety in those predisposed or at high doses, and exacerbating certain kind of heart arrythmias (though only rarely is this dangerous, usually it merely makes them more uncomfortable).  It's not something I advise taking regularly at doses higher than 100 mg due to the dependency that can be uncomfortable."

Even after 4-5 months without, taking them would not do much.  However other noots like coluracetam always deliver.  I've started memantine a month ago for it's suppression effects on nausea and vomiting and I was hoping it would ressensitize me to them but so far nothing, to my great chagrin.

Almost immediately after I dosed (which has been the case for every dose. Effects were felt in seconds. Not 2-3 minutes, seconds!!) life became much better.  Everything became brighter, my mood, energy, cognitive abilities and sleep all improved. Also, my tinnitus greatly diminished, my ears unblocked and a head pressure and anxiety that had been constants in the last year simply vanished.  The suppressing effects on nausea and vomiting were also obvious in the following days.  That was maintained for a couple of days and stopped. I upped to 20mg and identical scenario. Then upped to 30mg and suddenly felt super zen but experienced the dissociation I read about + some cognitive impairment + sound distortion (a bit akin to a low dose of k), but nothing problematic. Eventually got used to that as well. I've been using it for approximately 2 months and the effects that remain are: lessening of anxiety, no longer vomiting or experiencing nausea unless I trigger, my tinnitus is faint, the pressure in my head and ear blocking came and went but are now gone and I sleep better (a correlation could be made to the reduced anxiety). I also might have improved my ability to focus.   I'm now contemplating increasing my dose but I want to research things better before I do.  A few things to mention: I have Mast Cell Activation Syndrome. Also, I was getting better when I started, as such it's hard to evaluate properly what's what.  At the moment, I don't feel like it does anything so it would certainly be interesting to stop taking it and evaluate what changes.  Et voilà! My detailed and super subjective experience.

Looking at the full paper (thank you, /u/shrillthrill, an invaluable member of the community as always ; )  ), It looks like they are actually enriching the culture itself with the extract, influencing it's actual growth and I would imagine alkaloid synthesis within the fungus.  If that's what this is discussing, then it's titillating information. It looks like using the unextracted garlic-enriched mycelium actually produced a much better performance than the garlic-enriched mycelium extract alone. I'm not sure about this, though: some of the info in the results has me confused about what ""HGE"" means in the experiment.

The effect was so dramatic that I suspected an inhibitory effect on liver enzymes though research wasn't able to prove this. Cloves do seem to have detoxification benefits (at least for former alcoholics) like increasing glutathione.  I stopped using cloves in my food on a regular basis because of the taste and potency. I guess my intuition told me that it was something I shouldn't be eating all the time.

Nootropics,3dilrf,kizzeck,4,Fri Jul 17 00:35:56 2015 UTC,"Hallucinogens are all agonists at the type 2A serotonin receptor (5HT2A), with the somewhat notable exception of salvinorin-A. Melatonin (N-acetyl-5-MeO-tryptamine) is an active metabolite of serotonin (5-OH-tryptamine), and the tryptamines are quite frequently psychedelic via their action at 5HT2A conferred by their structural similarity to serotonin. DMT (N,N-dimethyl-tryptamine), psilocin (4-OH-N,N-dimethyl-tryptamine), and bufotenin (5-OH-N,N-dimethyl-tryptamine) are all psychedelic tryptamines. If you look at the structure of LSD, you can see that it contains a DMT skeleton!  If I remember correctly, 5HT2A is also involved in regulating circadian rhythms, but I think stimulating this receptor actually promotes wakefulness… At therapeutic dosages, I'd assume it would have negligible activity at 5HT2A, but if one were to take a bunch of it, weird things could certainly happen.

Nootropics,3dilrf,silverrain64,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:04:38 2015 UTC,"Just to quickly detail that ""hallucinogens"" (I quite dislike this categorisation) also include a large variety of drugs that do not have their primary action at 5-HT2A. For a short ordered list consider NMDAr antagonists such as ketamine, MXE, PCE, DXM etc... Or nAChR antagonists (deliriants as DPH, doxlyamine). Or even more simply think of GABA-a PAM's like zolpidem, zoplicone and zalepon. Muscimol is also a GABA-a PAM but unlike the z-drugs and benzodiazepines it binds to the GABA-a receptor at the GABA site which should produce unique sedative/hallucinogenic properties not totally unlike z-drugs.   Fun fact: zalepon is metabolized in the liver at CYP3A6 which can easily be inhibited with piperine (black pepper). Additionally, the metabolism of zalepon is catalyzed by aldehyde oxidase which can in turn be inhibited with loratadine (Claritin). I read on another forum of an experience of inhibitin zalepon metabolism with large amounts of black pepper, 5x10mg tablets of claritin and combining it all with pregabalin.   Here, I even dug up the comment:   The most interesting combo I have ever done with pregabalin involved Zaleplon (sonata), a substance that I have found can be pseudo-empathogenic in itself. In a past experience in which Zaleplon's duration was extended thru inhibition of CYP3A4 with black pepper and inhibition of aldehyde oxidase with 4 or 5 Claritin 10mg (this ended up lasting for like 2 days, oops... although the claritin/ aldehyde oxidase technique is a personal research discovery of mine ), me and 2 others tested what I had experienced previously, which was that zdrug amnesia can basically be avoided by taking dopaminergic stimulants beforehand. For some reason it seems that GABA A alpha one - PAM induced amnesia can just be overwhelmed by amphetamine, and is GREATLY enhanced in a stim comedown, basically instant overwhelming confusion and blackout crashing off of DRIs or (to a lesser extent) DRAs.    Also, he is not full of nonsense. I corroborated his notions in several points in the literature. I have not used Sonata (zalepon) at all, however combining 40-60mg [±20 for tolerance] of zolpidem (ambien) with nitrous oxide can become quite intensely dissociative and euphoric.

Melatonin is a well known to be anti-dopaminergic ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12043836 for example) and it obviously has a potent impact on circadian rhythms, which are closely associated with depression. The average Melatonin pill also comes with a curiously high dose for some reason, which only exacerbates the negative effects.  Complaints about Melatonin-induced depressive symptoms are not uncommon on internet forums. Others experience the opposite, so it's very much a YMMV situation.

This is bad news for energy and depressive side effects.  The obvious answer is to keep to very low doses or avoid long-term use.    If you're feeling intense, though, you can offset nightly melatonin with daily beta-blockers - basically an attempt to staple your circadian rhythm where you want it.  YMMV & IANAD, though, this involves taking a lot into your own hands."

Nootropics,3dilrf,PragmaticPulp,5,Thu Jul 16 16:47:57 2015 UTC,"It's never that simple, especially when you're dealing with an exogenous hormone (melatonin) with a relatively short half-life and circadian rhythm functions which naturally cycle throughout the day. We often talk about up- or down-regulation as if it's a simple balance, but those metaphors are only barely useful in the contact of direct or indirect (e.g. amphetamine) agonists/antagonists. Even then, the direction of regulation may not be what you expect, as some receptors can actually upregulate in response to both antagonists and agonists.  But the dopamine and circadian rhythm systems are even more complex. Take a look at this study, for example, showing state-dependent effects of the melatonergic interactions with the dopamine system: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15301928  In short: We can't draw any conclusions, really, because melatonin is a strange beast. But I definitely wouldn't count on it to upregulate dopaminergic tone.  This is why it's always a bad idea to buy in to neurotransmitter reductionism."
Nootropics,3dilrf,rainonyouwarriors,5,Thu Jul 16 17:18:23 2015 UTC,"Thanks for this.  From what I've seen, upregulation is almost always an inconvenient side effect, not a predictable force to harness.  All but the most simple, nature-overwriting compounds (as you say, amphetamines) tend to have weird knock-on effects that do things you don't expect."
Nootropics,3dilrf,shydominantdave,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:25:39 2015 UTC,"The average Melatonin pill also comes with a curiously high dose for some reason.   That's what I always used to think, until yesterday. I talked to my sleep doctor and he said the .75 mg I'm taking is probably too low, because 3 mg is the dose needed to occupy all of the melatonin receptors. I asked if that could cause dependency and he said no, not at all (I guess because it's a hormone and not a foreign direct agonist). He explained it better than that but I forget."
Nootropics,3dilrf,Marsupian,18,Thu Jul 16 18:23:11 2015 UTC,"Your doctor gave you a very hand-wavey explanation, and the bit about not causing dependency is only true if you think of dependency in terms of traditional drug addiction.  ""Occupying all of the melatonin receptors"" isn't the goal here. Inducing sleep with the bare minimum amount of exogenous manipulation is. Going full-bore with a high dose may get the job done, but it will also come with more rebound and more side effects. Your goal is to find the dose that works for your situation by carefully evaluating the effects, not by reaching for some arbitrary theoretical receptor occupancy.  As for dependence/rebound: Any sleep-inducing compound has a tendency to lull users in to a cycle of dependence. Some of this comes from down-regulating the natural feedback loops that already control these systems, but much of it comes from the psychological association between the compound and sleeping. Some people just plain forget how to relax and fall asleep as soon as they're given an ""easy button"" for inducing sleep. Same goes for concentration and stimulants, where some people just plain forget how to get any work done without downing some pill first. The goal, again, is to find the minimum dose to help tip the scales in your favor while working with natural, healthy habits to induce and maintain sleep. You can't replace your natural processes with supplements, but you can use them as a crutch. Just don't forget that you still need to focus on getting the basics right."

Nootropics,3dilrf,staspmr,1 point,Fri Jul 17 09:52:01 2015 UTC,"The key for me is to focus on the sleep-wake cycle as a whole and building your day around it, rather than viewing sleep as an on-off activity that occurs at a certain time at night. Build your day around an extended wind-down period in the evening. Stack your higher-intensity activities toward the middle of the day. Save your relaxing activities (reading, walking, no video games!) for the late evening.  Manage light control aggressively. Bright high color temperature light in the morning, dim low color temperature light in the evening. Use tools like f.lux, and you can even integrate it with Phillips Hue light bulbs if you want to get fancy (it's fun and it helps!).  Carve out night time as sleep time. Phones, internet, lights, are all strictly off limits once you're in bed. Once getting up to do something else isn't even an option, it becomes easier to stay in bed. Learn to relax, and accept the fact that relaxing in bed with a chance of falling asleep is still miles better than staying up, etc.  I had to learn the hard way that ""fall asleep faster"" just isn't a realistic goal for some of us, but if you can work the whole process of winding down and falling asleep in to a several hour period in the evening, you'll be in much better shape."

Has anyone tried topical administration? Melatonin dissolves in water....
Nootropics,3dilrf,1WithTheUniverse,2,Thu Jul 16 17:26:07 2015 UTC,"If anything time release makes the morning feel worse, but that's only a very vague observation as I can only compare 10mg time release vs instant release and I never really experienced any side effects from using .5mg for the past year or so.  If you'd use it for sleep induction but otherwise sleep fine I don't see the point of artificially keeping melatonin levels high throughout the night.  It does dissolve in water but it probably isn't stable for very long and hydrolyzes to 5-MeO-Tryptamine in alkaline solution. 80% glycerine or propylene glycol buffered to ph 4-5 improves stability but it will still noticeably degrade if kept for more than a month."

This surplus seemed to make me want to sleep or just do nothing for most of the day, until night time rolled around and my energy spiked back up, thus requiring me to take another pill and repeat the cycle.

Nootropics,3djxox,Greyone,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:31:23 2015 UTC,"from their blog http://www.ubiomeblog.com/announcing-the-ubiome-smoking-study-on-the-oral-microbiome/  ""FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE:  uBiome Seeks Citizen Scientists to Explore Smoking’s Effect on Mouth Bacteriasmokingstudy  uBiome, the leading microbial genomics company, seeks smokers, ex-smokers, and non-smokers to take part in a free ground-breaking study investigating the effects of tobacco smoking on the mouth’s microbial make-up.  ————–  San Francisco, California – July 15th, 2015 – Although tobacco use in the United States is in slow decline, almost one in five adults is a smoker. While a great deal has been learned over the past fifty years about smoking’s serious health implications, it has only recently become feasible to investigate its impact on the oral microbiome. Biotech startup uBiome is giving smokers, ex-smokers, and non-smokers the chance to contribute to important research while also receiving their individual data showing the bacterial composition of their own mouth. Study participants will get a free at-home, mail-in mouth testing kit. They will also learn how their microbiome compares to those of other smokers, non-smokers, and ex-smokers.  How to take part in the study: http://ubiome.com/smoking  The microbiome consists of the bacteria living in and on the human body, making up between three and six pounds of an individual’s overall weight. Bacteria can be both helpful and harmful. They play a crucial role in digesting food and synthesizing vitamins. However, they also contribute to serious issues such as autoimmune disorders, diabetes, heart conditions, bowel conditions, and skin conditions. The bacteria which make up the human microbiome are distributed across many different parts of the body – in the gut, ears, nose, genitals or mouth, for instance. The mouth alone can be home to around 1,000 different bacterial species.  Oral bacteria can cause tooth decay and gum disease, with figures showing that nearly 42 percent of periodontitis (gum disease) in the United States is attributable to tobacco smoking. There may be other links between smoking and the microbiome. For example a recent study by University Hospital Zurich suggested that the gut microbiomes of ex-smokers differ from those of smokers in a way which might partly account for the weight-gain often seen when people stop smoking. Potential weight-gain is a frequently cited reason for smokers refusing to give up, so understanding more about the interrelationship between bacteria, smoking, and weight change would be invaluable.  Jessica Richman, co-founder and CEO of uBiome, says the tobacco smoking study has significant potential. “Despite the known health risks, about 42 million Americans smoke. One way or another we’re all affected by smoking. Everyone either knows a smoker or is one themselves. We need to know more than we do, so this crucial study will shine a light on some of the unknowns. What difference does it make to the oral microbiome, for instance, if someone took up smoking as a teenager rather than coming to it later in life?”  Almost eighteen of every 100 U.S. adults aged 18 years or older currently smoke cigarettes. Although smoking rates in the U.S. have halved since 1964, the rate of decline has slowed. Smoking dropped from nearly 21 of every 100 adults  in 2005 to nearly 18 of every 100 adults in 2013. Cigarette smoking is the leading cause of preventable disease and death in the United States, accounting for more than 480,000 deaths every year, or 1 in 5 of all deaths.  Dr. Zachary Apte, CTO and co-founder of uBiome, says the oral microbiome samples from smokers, ex-smokers and non-smokers will be scrutinized in the company’s state of the art laboratory. “Just ten years ago it would have cost millions of dollars to analyze just one single person’s microbiome. Our sequencing service, based on research from the NIH Human Microbiome Project, can now do it for $89. For the first time, this makes large-scale research like uBiome’s new smoking study possible.”  uBiome’s mission is to use big data to understand the human microbiome by giving consumers the power to learn about their bodies, perform experiments, and see how current research studies apply to them. uBiome was launched in 2012 by UCSF scientists and Stanford and Cambridge technologists after a crowd-funding campaign raised over $350,000 from citizen scientists, roughly triple the initial goal. uBiome is now funded by Andreesen Horowitz, Y Combinator, and other leading angel investors.

It promotes a healthier metabolism of estrogen so you end up with more of the ""good"" estrogen metabolites in your system and less bad ones, which also has the effect of freeing up a little more testosterone, and can increase libido. though of course, results vary among different people. this short article talks about a few other libido enhancers also."

I try to eat vegetables and so on myself, but I still get some twitching in my eyebrow if I don't take magnesium regularly.  Fish oil is most likely only significantly important if you're dealing with inflammatory or neurological issues, though I'll admit that's partially an assumption on my part. Studies tend to find it has a more dramatic impact when paired with neurological agents (ex: augmentation of SSRIs in major depressive disorder) so if you're mentally very healthy you'll probably not see much.  Vitamin D is necessary if you don't get enough sunlight, which is the case for a significant part of the population (non-white) inherently and a significant part of the white population as well (lack of time outside). It does, however, have pretty erratic effects on mood--which itself might be linked to susceptibility.  For the most part, they're ""most likely"" good things to do for health given that on a basis of pure statistics most people are deficient in some combination of them. Likewise, whether by causation or correlation, some things (like weak magnesium status) tend to be linked to mental disease.

But yeah, if your sunlight exposure is fairly minimal then it isn't a bad idea. Getting a clear image of what all it can do is kind of tough due to the amount of research that establishes correlation but the receptors for it are (iirc) pretty ubiquitous throughout the body. There's been relationships found in everything from hormone levels to cognitive function and depression.  The reason we're not quite sure what all it can do is the most obvious one: People who go outside more have more vitamin D (since you get it naturally from sunlight exposure). Since it has influences throughout the body, it's hard to pin anything on it specifically. And like most substances, it might only be independently significant in people who are prone to mental disease.  Health is a complicated subject.  Fortunately Vitamin D is pretty cheap to take.

Vitamin A from plants is gated in order to prevent toxicity, the kind of vitamin A you get from animals is not. Consuming large amounts of cod liver oil will cause vitamin A toxicity, which isn't bad acutely but in the long run can damage your bones.  Also, vitamin D/A is cheap as hell, so there's not much point unless there's good price:value in doing so.   Otherwise, it's a perfectly fine option."
Nootropics,3djh5a,manrider,2,Fri Jul 17 16:57:37 2015 UTC,"nah, cod liver oil isn't going to put you at risk of excess vitamin A unless you're taking way more than necessary. you can do up to 10,000 IU of vitamin A in cod liver oil and it's perfectly safe. people with some health conditions do double that.   vitamin D helps to balance out vitamin A and reduces the risk of toxicity. vitamin A toxicity is more of a problem if you're taking it in isolation. and some people would argue that getting your nutrients from food sources is superior than isolated synthetics, but i'm not trying to get into that here.  as for vitamin A from plants (beta-carotene), it may have the benefit of lower risk of excess because it requires conversion within the body, but it's also true that not everyone can convert it to proper vitamin A effectively, especially with certain health conditions. so for some people it's not sufficient."
Nootropics,3djh5a,somestranger26,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:44:31 2015 UTC,"Something to note on cod liver oil is that oftentimes the distillation/purification process that they apply to it results in a drastic reduction in natural vitamin A (retinol) and D3. They then add these in and usually use retinyl palmitate which is a synthetic form of A that has a lower toxicity threshhold. Still though 10k IU is not going to hurt you. Getting the ""real"" cod liver oil such as the fermented form would be more beneficial though."
Nootropics,3djh5a,manrider,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:39:30 2015 UTC,"yeah, i would definitely advise choosing a brand where they do not add in A or D to it. the main point of using cod liver oil is to get these nutrients as they come in it without modification."

Even if it's not placebo, there's a fair chance that something entirely unrelated to the magnesium washed out (maybe you ate something bad and had a panic attack or whatever) when you stopped taking it. When N=1, most conclusions are meaningless.  Edit: Haha, I got this confused with another thread for a second. Sorry!  Problem with establishing causation is that the mind is a powerful thing. It also comes in multiple shades. The Magnesium very well may have had a solid impact on your issues. It may also be that, upon feeling that impact, you convinced yourself that the Magnesium was working for you which in turn triggered a strong placebo.  Of course, the beauty of placebo is that it still works even if you know it's placebo. The reality is is that ""if it works, it works!"" so it doesn't really matter on an individual basis whether or not the cause is placebo."

Now it's my understanding that Oxide is less bioavailable than Citrate, but regardless, you're probably just taking too much.    Absorption rates for Magnesium Oxide are something like 5%, I think. Contrast to other, more bioavailable forms, in which the common estimate is 20%-30%. 1000mg is a lot of Magnesium Oxide, but as far as your body is concerned it's not really a lot of magnesium. The symptoms OP described sound a lot more like a bad panic attack than anything else. I'm also not aware of magnesium toxicity causing such acute symptoms. If overdose is expected, I'd expect it to be a result of the amount of MgO running through his system as opposed to an overload of elemental magnesium in his blood. But that's purely speculation--the reality is is that the amount of available magnesium in the pills isn't high enough to trigger that kind of toxicity.  Of course, regardless of whether or not it was the oxide, it's probably a pretty good idea to switch to citrate since it's better bang for your buck."

Nootropics,3dj329,PragmaticPulp,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:27:02 2015 UTC,"Hmm, this is very strange. My first instinct is that you have some overlapping symptoms here, some of which may or may not be due to the magnesium supplementation.   I pulled the trigger and got some MagOx 400 482.6mg pills, and they were WONDERFUL!!! I felt like a normal person again, had more energy, and just generally felt better.   There are two explanations here, and I'm guessing the truth lies somewhere in the middle:  1) You were magnesium deficient to begin with, and the supplemental magnesium corrected that deficiency.  2) Placebo effect. Magnesium just isn't a powerful substance, but the placebo effect is not only very real but can be very powerful.   Everything I have read/researched seems to say it is almost impossible to get too much magnesium through oral supplementation.    Definitely not impossible to overdose when you're taking 1000mg of supplements every day. Strange things can happen when you start taking excess amounts of a single electrolyte (magnesium in this case) and start throwing your natural systems out of whack. Instead of supplementing magnesium, why not take a more balanced electrolyte supplement and focus on Mg-rich foods? Almonds, spinach, and something like gatorade would actually do wonders.  Really though, you need to see a doctor. Are you aware that it's trivially easy to test for serum magnesium levels? You really need to get some tests for those underlying fatigue issues that you were experiencing in the first place, because any of those could be caused by absorption or hormonal issues."

A) We can ship to corporate addresses, accredited research institutions, and medical professionals/organizations. We can't ship to individuals who are unaffiliated with any of the above.  B) Yes. We were in a hurry to get the site up. The catalog is going to expand, and, at the same time, we're going to add lots of info to it. In the meantime, if you have any questions, please let us know & we'll attend to them as quickly as we can.  C) This is primarily due to the legal situation surrounding the sale of these products. We need to keep a good lawyer on retainer. There are lots of paperwork/bureaucratic/analytical requirements we need to pay attention to, in order to ensure the continued survival of the business as a public-facing entity. It's fairly onerous. (This is why we went silent for a few months -- needed to get everything in order.)  To some extent, this also goes back to question A. As we are primarily oriented towards corporate/university/professional customers, and as we're focusing on bulk sales, it makes a certain amount of sense to sell small quantities at a relatively higher price, and large quantities at a very significantly discounted price."

Nootropics,3dfwm6,windrise,2,Fri Jul 17 16:38:13 2015 UTC,"""Of merit"" generally means a bit more than ""provides the bare minimum"". Of course, there's no hard and fast definition, so you're free to call it whatever you like but I think it's pretty silly to defend calling companies with exceeding bad customer service as ""companies of merit"".  Furthermore, in the context of this post we're talking about products without proof that the product is safe where you're defending the company not providing that proof.   I'd say that anyone who buys from a company which sells potentially unsafe products, does not provide information about safety/purity and also does not respond to customer inquires would be pretty dumb.   Note: Not talking about THT specifically here, for all I know they may have already responded with the requested information."

The study found that 4 weeks of treatment with 7, 8-DHF improved spatial and fear memory, and ameliorated morphological spine abnormalities including the number and elongation of spines in the hippocampus and amygdala   I've never heard of anything else that purports to have this effect - is 7, 8-DHF unique in this capacity thus far?  If so it represents an extraordinarily promising (and novel) potential treatment for what some believe to be the pathogenesis of many of the negative symptoms of autism.

Nootropics,3ddlxg,windrise,11,Wed Jul 15 13:11:17 2015 UTC,"Wikipedia says it's a melatonin receptor agonist in addition to a 5-HT-2C receptor antagonist.    The 5-HT2C receptor is one of the many binding sites for serotonin. Activation of this receptor by serotonin inhibits dopamine and norepinephrine release in certain areas of the brain.[3]  5-HT2C receptors are claimed to significantly regulate mood, anxiety, feeding, and reproductive behavior.[4] 5-HT2C receptors regulate dopamine release in the striatum, prefrontal cortex, nucleus accumbens, hippocampus, hypothalamus, and amygdala, among others.  Research indicates that some suicide victims have an abnormally high number of 5-HT2C receptors in the prefrontal cortex.[5] There is some mixed evidence that agomelatine, a 5-HT2C antagonist, is an effective antidepressant.[6] Antagonism of 5-HT2C receptors by agomelatine results in an increase of dopamine and norepinephrine activity in the frontal cortex. Conversely, many SSRIs (but not fluoxetine, which is a 5-HT2C antagonist[7]) indirectly stimulate 5-HT2C activity by increasing levels of serotonin in the synapse although the delayed mood elevation that's usually typical of SSRIs is usually paralleled by the downregulation of the 5-HT2C receptors.   Is it correct to say then that agomelatine is not serotonergic?  EDIT:  5-HT2C receptor antagonist.  EDIT2: Just saw this:   By antagonizing 5-HT2C receptors, it disinhibits/increases noradrenaline and dopamine release specifically in the frontal cortex. Therefore, it is sometimes classified as a norepinephrine–dopamine disinhibitor. It has no influence on the extracellular levels of serotonin."
Nootropics,3ddlxg,thrivenotes,8,Wed Jul 15 15:00:42 2015 UTC,"Look at the binding affinities, though... it's highly selective for the MTRs over 5HT-2C, so who knows how clinically significant that is.

I suggest those looking at agomelatine check out the 5-HT2C wikipedia page. 5-HT2C antagonism increases dopamine release in all rewarding behaviors (food, sex, reinforcing drugs, etc).

Liver damage from APAP occurs when your glutathione gets overwhelmed, the acetaminophen binds to protein, and the resulting ROS signals a downstream response. Then your body alters its calcium homeostasis, which alters the mitochondrial membrane potential, and prevents the cells from synthesizing enough ATP. The metabolite does not bind to protein until almost all of your glutathione is depleted, though. So it depends on your natural levels as to what dosage will cause damage."

Initially (within the first few days) I experienced some acute effects of sedation and mental fogginess about half an hour after dosing. The second morning after starting my prescription I experienced such a sudden lifting of my depression (I'd broadly characterise my ""type"" as anhedonic) that I appeared almost hypomanic to friends and family. This intensity of effect, or ""rush"" from the drive and lightness of feeling I experienced from Agomelatine lasted for about three weeks.   Since then I have almost totally recovered from my depression, thanks in part to the mood levelling effects of Agomelatine. If I stop taking my dose (it's very expensive) I do notice what could be just a return to my depressive baseline or could be withdrawal symptoms, it's hard to tell.   I agree that Modafinil seems to be much more effective when taken with Ago as I had taken Moda prior to being prescribed with Valdoxan and experienced limited effects. Modafinil and Valdoxan have been my only constantly dosed medications (aside from herbal anxiolytics) in the past year, the year I managed to start exercising regularly and genuinely enjoying socialising for the first time in years.

Also, there are sites that ship domestically (USA) and sell drugs that are typically prescription-only (viagra is a common one), but sell them in bulk powder or liquid forms and label them as for research purposes only.

Nootropics,3ddhfv,BaneWilliams,9,Wed Jul 15 15:47:08 2015 UTC,"Maybe, but the hypothesized mechanism in dementia is really that it protects neurons from stress caused by whatever is causing the dementia or compensates for deficits in the ability to use glucose. I'm skeptical that either of those will translate very well to people who don't have any degenerative or metabolic disease.  There's also evidence that self control benefits from relatively high blood sugar, or at least from tasting sugar. This doesn't necessarily imply that ketogenic diets impair executive function because a high level of ketone bodies  or some sort of metabolic adaptation might compensate for this; but with no research on this specifically it's equally possible that it compromises executive function."
Nootropics,3ddhfv,ohsnapitsnathan,-2,Wed Jul 15 18:40:48 2015 UTC,"I can't really comment too well on the first part, but the second I can (Once again from personal experience, which as we both know doesn't amount to a whole lot).  Before I attempt to logic the crap out of that study, I want to state a decently well known thought. Higher EF generally correlates with lower self control (Manic episodes are extremely EF friendly, but come with significant detriment to self control, various noots stated to increase EF also impact self control, flow states are high EF low self control, the list goes on). One could technically theorize the inverse from the study you linked, in that high blood sugar could corellate with decreased EF due to increased self control, but I wont (Mostly because the study only studies LOW BS, and not HIGH, where did you get the ""relatively high BS"" from anyway?).  Logic re: Glucose Study   This doesn't necessarily imply that ketogenic diets impair executive function because a high level of ketone bodies or some sort of metabolic adaptation might compensate for this   I disagree with the notion firstly that research on this specifically is even required. When the human body runs low on energy (which in a conventional diet will equate to BS levels, but in Ketogenic diets does not) irritability increases, cognitive function is impaired, EF is impaired.    Acts of self-control deplete relatively large amounts of glucose.   I bet there is nothing in the study to back this up in relation strictly to BLOOD glucose. I don't have access to it, but what is this compared to in terms of relation? I can't find anything but psuedoscience on this statement, with more to refute it than there is for it.  I guess you could state that self-control requires increased PFC activity which would theoretically require more energy, being that it's the most energy hungry part of a sedentary body.   Interestingly, being on the ketogenic diet lowers the amount of self control incidents required if restricting energy intake by utilizing slow release energy. Now, if we were to do a study on something like that, it could be interesting.   Self-control failures are more likely when glucose is low or cannot be mobilized effectively to the brain   Water is wet. Low BS = Low Energy in conventional diets. We know from a myriad of studies that this impacts the things already mentioned here.   Restoring glucose to a sufficient level typically improves self-control.   Increasing energy improves the symptoms caused by lack of energy? This is hardly compelling science that hasn't been hashed over a million times before.   The rest of the abstract follows conventional thought processes. I warrant that the study is accurate, but there really is no point to it. It's really explaining a host of things the science community knew by 2000. It doesn't really impact thoughts on Ketogenic Diets because Ketogenic Diets keep their blood glucose levels extremely steady (in fact, studies are being done as we speak on the effect of Ketogenic Diets on prediabetic and Type 2 Diabetics due to the fact that it keeps BS so stable)."
Nootropics,3ddhfv,BaneWilliams,2,Wed Jul 15 20:21:38 2015 UTC,"The idea that their findings are attributable to a lack of overall energy is a reasonable speculation, but it's not data. For instance, another group found that the effects of sugar on EF had more to do with tasting sugar than with ctual energy avilability  The reason I bring this up is that while you can make a case that ketogenic diets either impair, have no effect on, or enhance executive function, most of the time you end up so far from the actual data that the only really scientifically justified answer is ""we don't know"""

Excitotoxicity or acceleration of tolerance effects are not out of the question. Don't expect to find any actually studies along these lines, because nootropics are relatively unstudied alone, let alone in combination with other drugs.

Nootropics,3deg83,infinitehigh,7,Wed Jul 15 17:07:33 2015 UTC,The super rhodiola from ceretropic is both stimulating and mood enhancing. There are some tolerance issues though so you should take a break from the powder before trying it and then cycle w/ something else that is both stimulating and mood enhancing - maybe bromantane or ceretropics caffeine/nalt. This strategy will prevent any tolerance unless they share some pathways I am unaware of.   Other than that the rhodiola from powdercity is the best powder you'll find given its standardized salidroside content is just as high if not higher than anything else I've seen.

For me personally, I mainly tried nootropics because I was always interested in trying them at least once to see what the hype was all about and I wanted to see what the effects were like. Another reason why I've tried them was because of my low self-esteem of my own cognitive capacity, my struggles in life because of my limited cognitive capacity as well as not been able to accept that fact that I'm just not a very bright person to begin with.  My general opinion on nootropics are still undecided. For one, they're probably safer than most pharmaceutical drugs but on the other hand, the long-term studies are lacking which is concerning. If there is a rise in use of nootropics worldwide, I think it's because of the societal stigma attached to mental health issues and lack of support for people going through mental health issues.  After taking SSRIs (which I was prescribed for depression and anxiety), I've realised that most mind altering drugs like SSRIs/SNRIs and nootropics takes at least several weeks to start making changes to your cognition (except for stimulants which takes effect immediately). I didn't know about this and I thought that Piracetam wasn't working for me anymore after it stopped having an effect on me after the 3rd day. But if I continued to take it, it's possible that I might have gradually noticed an improvement my cognitive function.  I've lost interest in nootropics after not getting the amazing cognitive enchancement effect that I was expecting out of it as well as realizing that majority of intelligent, successful people don't rely on nootropics to function in their daily life (except for entrepreneurs like Dave Asprey). So now I'm focusing on possible cognitive disorders that I may have and I may go with the pharmaceutical medicine route if it turns out I have a cognitive disorder even though I know that there's greater risks and side effects involved."

It matters heavily what your baseline state is. Many say that nootropics only work when your average performance is below baseline and people with above average cognitive function see no benefit - this is wholly a generalization and everyone is different. Even the relatively ""weak"" racetams have a significant function on how I think and where mental resources are allocated. As an MBTI INTJ (a personality type categorized by always performing a specific type of broad constant logical assessment and analysis of situations to develop engineered objective solutions), having had meditated and introspected a lot and having a good sense of how my thinking and cognitive process works internally, I can see how pramiracetam literally turns me into more of a logical robot than I already am. I still have emotions, but they're calculated and set aside so critical work can be done with higher accuracy and reliability. Not a single spelling, grammatical, numerical, layout, or logical error exists in critical documents. I and others would have a higher chance of missing one if not for these things; which for fields which require perfection, such as aerospace, is critical.

I tried Adrafinil and didn't see any difference (over perhaps a too short period of time?), so I doubled the dose and had one of the worse experiences of my life---a sort of clogging, inability to think. Never again Adrafinil. Is there information on Dave Asprey's use of nootropics? I'd be interested in that.

Nootropics,3db06x,MisterYouAreSoDumb,3,Tue Jul 14 22:38:31 2015 UTC,Can you explain why thc needs to be extracted from weed into fat to be bioavailable? Or is that a myth too. I was under the impression that if I just ate some weed it would be significantly less effective than if the thc had been dissolved into a fat first.   This was also true of synthetic cannabinoids. Back before they were banned I tried taking just the powder with no or little effect but if dissolved in oil first they were very active orally.  Or am I just way off base?
Nootropics,3db06x,DrunkBTC,13,Tue Jul 14 23:33:49 2015 UTC,"That's because THC in the plant is in a carboxylic acid form. Cooking the THC in heat decarboxylates it. Since THC is fat soluble, fat is used in that process to make the extraction more efficient. The fat is not altering the absorption of the THC. It is facilitating the extraction during cooking, which decarboxylates it, which then allows the THC to absorb and work properly.  Tetrahydrocannabinolic Acid, which is what is found naturally in the cannabis plant, is not psychoactive. You need heat to turn that THCA into the psychoactive THC form. THC itself is very non-polar. So you need a non-polar solvent, like alcohol or fat, to get it to absorb in a solution. Also, eating THC products is actually more potent than smoking, because when passing through the liver during first pass metabolism, THC gets converted into 11-hydroxy-THC. That has been shown to be more psychoactive than regular THC, and has much higher plasma levels after oral administration of THC compared to smoking.  I have not really researched THC that much, though. There might be some interactions with stomach acid that I am not aware or, or bile salts. I would have to do some more reading on it."

Nootropics,3db06x,LordDongler,3,Wed Jul 15 06:38:25 2015 UTC,"No, not to my knowledge. The liver working to metabolize substances, and liver toxicity, are not the same thing. It's your liver's job to metabolize things. So just because something is hepatically metabolized, does not automatically mean it is damaging or straining the liver."

Administration without food can result in inadequate drug concentrations and may reduce effectiveness.  Coadministration of VIIBRYD with ethanol or with a proton pump inhibitor (pantoprazole) did not affect the rate or extent of vilazodone absorption. In addition, neither the Tmax nor terminal elimination rate of vilazodone was altered by coadministration with either pantoprazole or ethanol.

Nootropics,3db06x,CheeseVikings,1 point,Wed Jul 15 09:51:24 2015 UTC,Thanks for info! I've been approaching this wrong.
Nootropics,3db06x,shydominantdave,3,Thu Jul 16 19:37:49 2015 UTC,"Remember, my point was that a substance being fat soluble does not automatically mean you need fat to absorb it. Many substances suggest taking food with them to slow your GI tract motility, or to prevent upsetting your stomach. Vilazodone looks like it needs longer to absorb in your GI tract. So taking it with fat or food will signal your body to slow down the GI tract motility, allowing longer for it to be absorbed. The fat itself is not facilitating the absorption, though. It is just signaling your body to slow down the movement through the GI tract, which then allows things to absorb in higher amounts.  Take Aniracetam for example. It is high lipophilic. However, it is rapidly and completely absorbed in the GI tract from a fasting state. If fat-soluble drugs needed fat to absorb, then that would not be the case. Your intestines are lined with a mucous membrane, which is a lipid membrane that facilitates the absorption of molecules. The membrane itself is the fat, which lipophilic molecules rapidly pass through. Also, just because a drug is hydrophobic does not mean it will automatically be lipophilic. It's more complicated than that."

Nootropics,3d8abh,Makkaboosh,21,Tue Jul 14 16:22:21 2015 UTC,"This has been something of an open secret in US SC2 circles for a while, but it's not ubiquitous. One thing about these games is that your ""twitch"" reflexes are rather important but they are instinctual.   What happens and the place where these things improve performance most is that when you play five or six or ten games in a row and you just can't constantly focus any longer, they allow you to continue to perform. One of the most easily quantified aspects of Starcraft play is ""APM""- actions per minute. When a player is performing 300 actions per minute, most of them aren't actually hurting his opponent or improving his performance, but they show, essentially, the level of focus of the player at a given moment. Often, when the action happens, players start to perform fewer actions per minute, because their focus has to narrow and they can't manage several areas of the map at once any longer.  Things like exercise, modafinil (or others), aren't as effective in these cases as amphetamines, which are longer-lasting, and extremely cheap and readily available among these players because so many of them carry prescriptions. Generally, most players haven't even heard of modafinil and many wouldn't even consider taking an ""illegal"" drug like cocaine.  Subjectively speaking, there's just not much comparison between the effects of exercise, which gives a generally better attitude and more energy and stamina, with amphetamines, which can provide very intense and sustained focus. Very good players often use both."
Nootropics,3d8abh,jrhsk8,8,Tue Jul 14 20:11:49 2015 UTC,"Modafinil is really good for the long haul sort of stuff too. I use it for work. I don't care enough about CSGO to take it just to grind away for a day, but my guess is that it would work as well for that. I've tried Ritalin too, and it felt pretty similar, maybe just stronger.   Drug testing amphetamines is easy. Just have them piss after the tournament. But some people have legitimate prescriptions for Adderall and it becomes really hard to deal with cheaters in that case."

Modafinil keeps you awake and alert enough to function normally. Are you one of those kids that got onto the moda hype train? Modafinil is mostly placebo if you're healthy and had a good nights rest. And no, no drug will give you extra base performance. You can only stimulate and supress what's already there. If you're stupid, neither of these drugs can change that. The difference between the 2 is that the moda participant will be more alert, but otherwise normal functioning and the second, adderall participant, will be obcessed with whatver it is they're doing for the remainding period of the drugs effect. Seriousley, alot of the drugs that are being dicussed on this sub are done so in an un-scientific manner. Most of it's difficult to distinguish from a placebo. Nootropics is a hobby for some people and too small to be taken very seriousley, otherwise there would be much much more attention given to the topic.

Nootropics,3daydf,OnceAndFutureChris,11,Tue Jul 14 21:32:06 2015 UTC,"Amphetamine neurotoxicity is a complex topic, but it goes far beyond just excess dopamine in the synapse. Amphetamines actually enter the presynaptic neuron and disrupt the internal functioning through various mechanisms in order to increase dopamine efflux, but they also induce other undesirable disruptions in certain cellular functions such as the Ubiquitin Proteasome Pathway.  IIRC, L-Theanine has simply been observed to modulate dopamine concentrations in certain brain regions. As far as I know, this is due to downstream effects through otherwise natural pathways in the dopaminergic system, as opposed to direct interference with the internal functioning of presynaptic dopaminergic neurons (don't quote me on that, though, I'm not very familiar with L-Theanine). That's the key difference.  The other big difference is the magnitude. L-Theanine obviously doesn't induce the same magnitude of dopaminergic increase as amphetamine, because the two medications have vastly different efficacies (even ignoring the NE properties of AMPH). It's apples and oranges."

While I'm not saying everything was emotionally, developmentally and neurologically A-OK with ""analog"" porn consumption 30 years ago, can we agree that the average man's relationship to porn was a lot different (probably, on balance, for the better) when the options were basically: Buying a magazine or working up the nerve to go to a scuzzy peepshow/theater/whatever?

So doing it a lot trains you to believe gratification should always be instant, and then you are more inclined to avoid things that involve up-front frustration, tedium and discomfort in exchange for a payoff later (which describes most worthwhile endeavors; certainly the things we're striving for by taking nootropics).   I shudder to think about how we're shaping our neural pathways when we have the infamous ""fourteen tabs of porn open at once"" and we're frenetically clicking between them in futile search of that ultimate stimulation.   This might not get to the heart of the question about neurology, nor to the the matter of consensus, but I think it's an important factor in the discussion."
Nootropics,3d8y9m,FW900,6,Tue Jul 14 19:31:40 2015 UTC,"Oxytocin, vasopressin, and a myrid of other neuropeptides/NTs are released during orgasm, and even during sexual activity, followed by a surge of prolactin. Prolactin has somewhat of an inhbitory effect on dopamine, is the reason why motivation is usually dulled after the deed is done.   Vasopressin, prolactin, oxytocin, amidst many other chemicals and hormones are released during orgasm. Vasopressin is a significant memory enhancing hormone, can enhance memory consolidation and I imagine an action like repeated orgasm could theoretically dull its natural release.   As for dopamine, I don't buy into the dopamine downregulation theory all that much that get spewed around on ""nofap"". Maybe if you're doing this hours a day every day, each day of the week?   Here are some of my past thoughts (from two different threads, sorry for the lousy cut and paste) regarding the neuroscience of why abstaining from sexual activity may have nootropic effects."

The decline isn't prolonged; by the following day things will be 'normal' again (provided I only had 1-2 orgasms) but I will no longer masturbate whenever I'm using a drug that is stimulating or potentiating dopamine.   Without the use of drugs however, I didn't notice anything particularly detrimental but I can see it being a problem if you're masturbating constantly. We've all had those days, and I doubt they were particularly productive but it's impossible to know whether that is due to dopamine down-regulation or not. I certainly think it's worth being aware of this stuff and not over-doing it. Too much of a good thing and all. ;)"

We as humans are hard wired to place sex/reproduction as our main motivator for the most part. When we watch porn we get an immediate satisfaction. I imagine watching porn everyday for years has some negative effect. Instead of the feeling of libido hitting in more natural ways, seeking out mates, it hits when we turn off the lights, turn down the volume, get the lotion ready, and pull up pornhub.   If you remove porn, after a while your mind will return to its natural sex-seeking state, which can be all encompassing at times. You'll feel hornier throughout the day, which can make you be more risk seeking (confident), and my testosterone levels do seem to rise."

At best, most studies just demonstrate differences in brain structure, but proving causation without a control group is harder. I think a lot of guys mainly go off the ever growing body of anecdotal reports in deciding to go porn free, in much the same way that a lot of people here rely more on anecdotal evidence. I don't have them saved, but I've seen articles/studies showing poorer working memory and evidence of a reduction in the size of the prefrontal cortex in heavy porn users. Here's one example of a brain structure study that shows heavy porn users have less grey matter is some areas: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24871202  There's a whole bunch more on the studies page on yourbrainonporn.org (.com?).

In my mind until we can prove that porn causes the differences in brain structure it's really not worth investing in. It'd be equally valid to conclude that a deficit in prefrontal cortex function makes an individual susceptible to porn addiction (and addiction in general).

Nootropics,3d8y9m,FW900,2,Wed Jul 15 13:31:34 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm agnostic about the effects of porn too, but the instinctual downvoting some people do is really weird..."
Nootropics,3d8y9m,SPUDGEIST,1 point,Thu Jul 16 12:25:27 2015 UTC,"From my experience, abstaining from porn and masturbation changed me as a person. This could have happened a variety of ways. I have had experience abstaining from masturbation without expecting any benefits before, and looking back, during this period I had significantly more charisma and less social anxiety.  These changes could take place via a variety of pathways. I know for a fact that porn changes the way I perceive women in a very negative way. When masturbating regularly I would think about sex constantly and would release my urge a few times a week, and project my intense sexuality, just in my mind, onto almost every woman I met. I hated this and tried to control it, and tried to desexualize women in my mind, but it was impossible. I hated myself for it. Abstaining made this sexual mindset disappear most of the time so I could interact with women just as normal people. This is valuable not just to men themselves, but primarily because women as humans deserve this respect.  Secondly, when I jack off after abstaining for a while my life becomes significantly worse in every aspect. Sex is always on the mind, I become more likely to give into other urges (but this feeling may be why I did it in the first place), I am unproductive, enervated, feel like I've been kicked in the head, and extremely self-conscious in a useless and selfish way. It also makes me want to just sit and play Call of Duty, which I only ever want to do if I've masturbated in the last two weeks. A year ago I played it almost every day. These effects persist intensely for a week, but I don't feel back to my new higher baseline until about 3 weeks.  Before I stopped masturbating, those were basically my personality traits, along with self-hatred and criticism. I think abstaining acted as a catalyst for growth as well as having its own effects, but I would rather quit exercising, taking supplements/noots, meditating, and eating carefully than start masturbating again. These experiences may also not be the norm because I'm a 17 year old male with probably raging hormones who started jacking it at about 12, so this is confounded by the process of growing up, but I think everyone should seriously consider the effect that this all-too-common habit (IMO) is having on them.  There's a study here that says sexual satiety decreases androgen receptor density: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17268169  And increased estrogen receptor alpha density: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17239879  I urge you all to consider it, and consider that even if there isn't currently a complete or significant understanding by which these changes take place (and that they all might be a brilliantly orchestrated placebo), that doesn't mean that it is not possible that there are pathways by which these changes take place.  I hope you will all give it at a try with an open mind, if not for the nootropic benefits then for the psychological benefit. If you're having trouble, keep in mind that after a long enough time the urges do go away."
Nootropics,3d8y9m,SPUDGEIST,11,Tue Jul 14 14:19:49 2015 UTC,"Look, I'm no expert and I'm not trying to critisize your life choices, but when I read...   I would... project my intense sexuality, just in my mind, onto almost every woman I met. I hated this and tried to control it, and tried to desexualize women in my mind, but it was impossible. I hated myself for it.   I think your problem might be a little different than you think. Any given piece of sex research out there is probably going to suggest that the normal and healthy thing that's going on there is thinking of the opposite sex in a sexualized way, and the unhealthy thing is hating yourself for it. That, I imagine, is where most of your unhappiness is stemming from - whatever issues are leading to that self-hatred, and the resulting feelings. If abstaining from certain behavior is working for you as a way of addressing that, that's cool, but I believe you're treating a symptom, not the cause, at least to a certain degree.  The healthy mammalian brain is wired for sex and there is nothing whatsoever wrong or abnormal with thinking about it regularly, being preoccupied with it, and thinking about the opposite sex in a certain way. It doesn't make you a creep or a misogynist to be attracted to random women or female friends or what have you. But the cycle of self-hatred you're describing, that is something you may want to look into."
Nootropics,3d8y9m,UnifiedAwakening,3,Tue Jul 14 15:51:17 2015 UTC,"being preoccupied with it   There is something wrong with being preoccupied with anything to the point where it severely interferes with ones life. Many mental illnesses and symptoms of them from OCD to impaired executive functions such as poor impulse control can have very real consequences to any preoccupation, even if its natural. We are also wired for food, but its rather unnatural for us to be completely preoccupied by it.  I agree with your point that it is extreme and potentially unhealthy to self-loathe over sexual thoughts. Perhaps ""thinking about"", or ""ruminating over"" or even ""temporarily preoccupied"", would have been more accurate to use instead of preoccupied."

Nootropics,3d8y9m,Synzael,2,Tue Jul 14 20:36:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I understand what you're saying. The excessiveness and choicelessness in the matter was what bothered me, and I suppose immaturity or psychological confusion was what was causing me to hate myself for it. I still have frequent sexual feelings towards women, but before it was incessant, to the point where it was constantly on my mind when I interacted with women, even if I wasn't sexually interested at all. It was certainly unhealthy, and I didn't want to live like that. I don't think that should be the norm. It was definitely the root cause of the problem. Now I have appreciation and agency in my sexuality rather than it being a burden."
Nootropics,3d8y9m,0_-,2,Tue Jul 14 16:06:40 2015 UTC,"I have definitely slowed. It used to be a nightly ritual but over the past year or so I do it less and less. I still prefer to have a go every week or so but I do notice that it's becomes a cycle much like cocaine. Even when I've finished and do something else, it's not long after that I become horny again. If I don't do it for a numerous amount of days I feel better and my thoughts are not on sex. It has become more of a want to do than a need to do and it has been a positive experience.   Same with cannabis. Smoked heavily for about 9 years. Last 2-3 years I have slowed down to where I only do it at night when I'm just relaxing or every couple of days. I feel much better. I will only smoke during the day if it's a special event or a time when most people are drinking. I'm not a big drinker so I generally use weed instead."

Nootropics,3d8y9m,relbatnrut,-8,Wed Jul 15 19:24:01 2015 UTC,"There are absolutely sweeping powerful and positive benefits to conserving your sexual energy. Science is incredibly limited in how it can demonstrate this to you in the external sense, the best way to experiment with it is to arrive at your own anecdotal results through your own personal experimentation (meaning quitting porn and masturbation entirely).   Personally I avoid ejaculation at all costs even when I'm making love to my wife, that is because I know the benefits of avoiding that.  Generally people who masturbate all the time or visit prostitutes all the time are among the most messed up sort of people you're going to meet. They look ""grey"" somehow, dead, they don't really have a lot of life in their eyes.  Masturbation depletes the emotional response enormously. It drives men to have a negative emotional response to women; this you can prove scientifically. There is evidence that men who are moving into harder and harder pornography tend to bring out some of those behaviors into real life.  Like any addictive behavior, it drains the willpower of the individual and leaves them a helpless mess, an addict.  Worse of all, like any drug addiction, or like obesity, it is often self reinforcing and self justifying. Some of the reward pathways that drugs use are also used in excessive sexual stimulation.  All in all it's quite pathetic considering the very limited momentary elation that it provides, at a long term cost. All things in moderation, including sex. I enjoy sex very much, but also realize that it's important to respect women. Modern pornography humiliates women and it's a sign of hate towards women that resonates in every aspect of our society, such as our disdain towards mothers, not considering that a job or considering that a filthy lowly profession, so much so that women are now terrified of having a child and instead emulate men, attempting to have a high power career. The humiliation of being a woman or a mother is too much for many to handle.  There are at least 10,000 good reasons to avoid that filthy habit. Let the rabble indulge in their human weakness, generally all these people (who are bound to down vote me) have not produced an original thought in their entire lives. They certainly aren't going to question or think about any of their behaviors. If you are smart, you will, and you'll see the enormous waste of energy involved in sexual misconduct. It is the capital waste of energy in your body. So how does that effect your brain? Well, it makes you an idiot. Idiots watch porn, masturbate, and treat women like they are scum. And then they fail in business, and their lives are screwed in a thousand ways, even if they make money they aren't happy. They are stupid fools in other words. Don't be one."

There is evidence that men who are moving into harder and harder pornography tend to bring out some of those behaviors into real life.   Ok, prove it scientifically then.

Nootropics,3d98y9,theskepticalidealist,6,Tue Jul 14 23:17:27 2015 UTC,Went through brain zaps with Venlafaxine withdrawl.   Consensus on the internet was mega doses of omega 3 fish oil and magnesium malate. So at least 4 grams of omega 3 fish oil and probably as much magnesium malate as you can manage. This pretty much reduced the brain zaps to about 10%.  Dizzyness was really helped with otc motion sickness medication. Fatigue combatted with your favourite stimulents.

Nootropics,3d98y9,chicagoit,4,Tue Jul 14 20:32:53 2015 UTC,It's best to slowly taper down the dose of SSRI's over a long period of time. The last SSRI I used was prozac. I think it was 20 mg caps. Prozac has a long half life you do not have to take it daily.  I quickly reduced that to one cap every other day. Then a few times a week. Then to once a week. And then to none. I have been clean 3 years now ha.  You can make solutions of it that you refrigerate and you can take fractional doses that way. I did that before I went to zero. I adjusted my once a week dose to a daily shot of the solution. I reduced the dose over a year or so.

I would get the zaps within a few hours of a missed dose, and got them during the taper and for several weeks afterwards pretty frequently.  I ended up tapering myself off since my doctor thought going from 60 mg to 30 mg for three weeks, than stopping was a good plan (it wasn't). Cymbalta is little dots of medicine inside a capsule, so they couldn't be split. I literally opened my capsules, counted the little dots of medicine, and reduced my dose by approximately 5 mg each week until I was done.  I'm in a pretty severe depression now, but after that (my 3rd and final experience with antidepressants), I can't even imagine seeking out medical help with depression ever again.  I tapered off almost 4 years ago and I still get the brain zaps from time to time. I have no idea why; it seems impossible it could be related to former antidepressant prescriptions, but who knows?"

The only reason I'm taking prozac still is because of the annoying discontinuation symptoms, its effect on depression is almost zero compared to what changes in my diet and personal philosophy has had.

It also reduces brain inflammation and has few interactions/side effects. However I'd only do this if you were not tapering off, 24hr coverage is hard without the XR version and it's only theoretical.   If not a lot of the other suggestions are quite good."

Driving and teleporting to work, it's a 5 min commute and I definitely wasn't completely removed, but still.  I do lab work and I stared at a shaker following it with my eyes in a similar situation to refrigerator. Not nearly insanity but still, like I said.  Id rather just be tired and less focused."
Nootropics,3dal5n,Hey_You_Asked,3,Thu Jul 16 09:16:43 2015 UTC,"After a few hours (and sometimes from the start), I start feeling pretty detached from my surroundings, and experience the ""Spock"" effect that people have mentioned here in context of pramiracetam and others. Basically I feel so actively involved in my work, that I get irritated by any interruption or having to do smalltalk. I don't empathize with people anymore either.   This describes me to a large extent. I was previously on Rx AD which nullified any feelings. I decided to stop and find a supplement/nootropic stack which appears to be helping. I'm a non-responder to NA-Semax, but I take Nuvigil for the (work) focus and I've found that Tianeptine Sodium has helped tremendously to actually feel feelings again (good and bad) while lifting clinical depression. I also have found that Rhodiola Rosea and Ashwaganda helped curb my anxiety and immediate annoyance with people who interrupt me at work. I actually just ran out of the latter today, and thought I'd check reviews here for L-Theanine to help with same. As an aside, Kava and Kratom did nothing to help with stress/anxiety/anger.   TL/DR: Tianeptine/RR was a life changer for me. hope this helps."

Come home from a shitty day at work, drink some red maeng da kratom, and I'm feeling good. Makes me chattier sometimes, relaxed, in lower doses it is somewhat stimulating. Green/white vein kratom is suitable for situations where you could use a little more focus.   Kava kava can get you ""drunk"" if prepped right."

Ashwaghanda is great for not getting irritated at people as well and the two combined make for a nice mood. But rhodiola did absolutely nothing for me. I did get the NOW brand which is just not very good quality so YMMV.
Nootropics,3dal5n,apoctapus,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:59:05 2015 UTC,"I experience the exact same thing, but it happens regardless of what nootropic substance I'm using.  I feel detached, cerebral, annoyed by interruptions.  I've become mentally inflexible, unable to shift gears.  I've essentially become dissociated from my body and emotions.  In my opinion, this is the result of not consciously moving your body for extended periods of time.    I've experimented with a number ways to get back connected again, and the key to solving this has been forcing myself to:   Get off the computer.  Every 60 minutes.  I set a timer app. Get blood pumping.  Walking up and down stairs, or around the block if the weather permits.  Stretch anything that feels achy or stiff.  Shake out muscles and taking deep breaths.  You don't have to make a big production, just wake up your connection to your skin and your body again. Get heavy exercise in every day, treadmill, yoga, weights, anything that causes strain and pushes my body.  If you can't exercise because of an injury, find something else that brings your attention into your body (and not just your hands).    If I don't do these three things, I slowly slip into a more dissociated state, disconnected emotionally.  I start to feel awkward and lonely, and my wife get frustrated with me because I'm distant and superficial.    When I do these things, I'm more relaxed, have more energy, more empathetic, and feel good.    It never really occurred to me that I was amping down my metabolism by sitting still for most of the day.   Once I force myself into physical activity, priming and pumping my body into action, I become more conscious of my physical space, and more connected to it.  I get more energy and can gather a second wind at the end of the day to spend time with my wife and work on other things.  It's the best of both worlds.  I can focus deeply and clearly on the work I'm doing, and then turn that focus on my body, connecting me again to my emotions and empathy, improving my mood and social anxiety to boot.  Hope it helps someone like it helped me!"

Nootropics,3d9mh5,mrhappyoz,4,Tue Jul 14 22:28:47 2015 UTC,"You could look for stuff that could help focus and executive function indirectly. ADHD is often comorbid with mood disorders that can in turn be comorbid with sleep, energy and metabolic dysregulation.   You could try taking mild and relatively nonaddictive relaxation and sleep agents towards the end of the day. IIRC magnesium is supposed to be good for ADHD and will help you sleep and recover from workouts better. Valerian, low dose melatonin, lavender and ashwagandha might be worth a look. Zinc can be (mildly) good for depressive and anxious symptoms and T levels. Pre and probiotics. Light therapy. High dose vitamin D in the morning. These probably won't cure you but they might help in small ways that will reinforce other positive changes."

It is more expensive than most nootropic pills -- but google around and find something you can affore.   Try incorporating it into your meditation practice and keep it handy for when your symptoms become overwhelming."

Nootropics,3d9mh5,Beast3Cells,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:07:18 2015 UTC,"I have a doctor apt tomorrow. I was being a bit dramatic yesterday.. IDK. I've always found nootropics that work for a week or so than taper off or work too well and have horrible side effects. I think real adhd medication would be safer (though I know prescription medication has it's own risks) and more effective.   I have been on the nootrpics band wagon for about 4 years. It was great until it sent me to the hospital and cost me about a grand. I don't blame nootrpics in of itself, I just took way too much phenibut way too often. Twas' amazing in it's prime though.  I can thank nootropics for helping me develop into a more desirable person. It really pushed my limits intellectually and allowed me to be more confident and productive and I will always cherish that. I just am afraid I'll take some research chemical and end up right back in the hospital with a huge hit to the wallet.   The doc I'm seeing tomorrow is for lower income people as I still work in an entry level position and am paying off student debt, in case anyone was wondering. There's a good chance the doctor would recommend me for adhd testing and I won't be able to afford it. I wish to explain to the doctor that there's no way I can pay for that kind of treatment and perhaps they could prescribe me something helpful. I'm a little nervous the doc will stand firm on not being able to provide real adhd medication and it'll be yet another waste of money. But we'll see..... sorry for rambling.

I'd like to put an extra emphasis on meditation given my personal experience. After a month of daily practice, something snapped, and executive function skyrocketed. I'd really suggest you practice it every day, as it forces you to be more aware of how you spend your time, and I've personally found it raises my energy significantly.   As for nootropics, I'd suggest NA-Semax because of its stimulating properties. Some people also do well on piracetam and ALCAR, but ultimately, you must experiment by yourself."

You take the complete stance of a witness: witness the full inhalation, the full exhalation and then witness the very faint space between the two.   Whenever the mind drifts, gently bring it back to witnessing the breath. If you find this difficult in the beginning, you can say ""In"" (internally) for the whole duration of the inhalation and ""Out"" for the whole duration of the exhalation. When you're a bit more focused let go of the words, and simply focus on the breath fully.   Good luck!"

Nootropics,3d9mh5,ProfWiki,2,Tue Jul 14 16:50:41 2015 UTC,"I recently started taking some adderall, and also have some straterra.  As someone who has not had proper ADHD medication since early adolescence, I can kind of compare what the real stuff feels like compared to the experimental nootropics and supplements.  The absolute closest thing to adderall in terms of effects is probably adrafinil. It works differently, though, and is not as good at reducing hyperactivity. In fact, it can induce hyperactivity at times. Adderall on the other hand makes me so calm I feel more like I took a xanax, but I feel as awake as on adrafinil. I'm also wayyy less irritable than I usually am.  So yeah, adrafinil is probably the closest non-prescription but if you have issues with hyperactivity it won't really help that and may make you more hyper. If you are just ADHD-PI then yeah, definitely give adrafinil a shot."

Take 2 in the morning about 20 - 30 minutes before eating anything and don't take any other medications for at least 45 minutes. It's a prodrug, meaning it is converted into an active metabolite before it actually does anything, so having food in your belly or other medications being processed could reduce efficacy. It actually turns into modafinil, which is Rx only, in the liver. Modafinil is quite popular around here so Adrafinil is a way to get it in your system without dealing with expensive shady online pharmacies in India.  Also, try not to take more than 600 mg a day. 900 max. I'd cycle off it sometimes too."

Nootropics,3d9mh5,cheese_pizza_,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:44:35 2015 UTC,"ephedrine and pseudoephedrine   Both are available behind the counter at the pharmacy, ephedrine will be for asthma (primatene, bronkaid) and pseudoephedrine is in stuffy nose and allergy medicines (like Claritin-D)   Both work pretty well, it's pretty funny seeing the reviews for the pseudoephedrine drugs people say things like (without a stuffy nose I can get so much more done). Note that neither one of these are ment to be taken for ADHD and you should probably run it through your doctor first to make sure you aren't at any risk from either one. If you want something to take long term then pseudoephedrine might be better because some people use it daily for 6+ months out of the year and there hasn't been any serious wide spread side effects.   ephedrine is supposed to be taken more acutely/as needed and the only real long term users who take more than 4 pills a day are people going a cutting cycle.   Also make sure you get them from behind the counter, there are some medications like Phenylephrine, Sudafed PE that look just like pseudoephedrine and make the same claims but have been proven to be 100% bunk and pure placebo. If it's not behind the pharmacy counter and you don't have to show ID to buy it's junk.   As long as you don't look like a shady meth head or there hasn't been a string of junkies coming in that day the pharmacist shouldn't even blink at your request. Some stores like CVS/Walgreens/Walmart/Kroger have them in the OTC section available as little plastic cards that you bring to the pharmacy counter in order to get the actual product.

Ceretropic says ""It is 140% as efficacious as modafinil at wakefulness promotion and does not have the same interactions that modafinil can have. It also does not last as long, making it easier to dose more effectively, without having to wait out 12 hours of effects. It has slightly lower DAT affinities but had higher eugeroic actions. It is more potent than modafinil with 50-100mg corresponding to 100-200mg for modafinil.""  http://www.ceretropic.com/buy-hydrafinil/"
Nootropics,3d7f3s,theskepticalidealist,4,Tue Jul 14 02:44:32 2015 UTC,Hydrafinil was pretty weak for me. Mods was much better at the same dosage (100mg)
Nootropics,3d7f3s,happypiggy,0,Tue Jul 14 02:49:21 2015 UTC,that is crazy bcuz neither moda nor armoda will keep me awake.

I just want something that will keep me awake during the day and let me sleep at night. Modafinil keeps me awake at night to point I've purchased etizolam to help me sleep. How exactly this situation is better than methylphenidate I do not know, damn UK GPs and their short sightedness.   I've tried hydrafinil from Ceretropic, doesn't work for me at all."

Apparently there's a large difference in dark/light colored Adrafinil anecdotally observed by many people. From my understanding, the conclusion was a difference in the enantiomers and there concentration vs true racemic.  I agree the enantioselective compounds can have very different effects, which I always thought was really cool. R-Phenibut and  R-Phenylpiracetam have analogous enantiomeric differences, as another example."

Nootropics,3d7f3s,123abc123abcdsfdlsf,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:06:47 2015 UTC,"I'll have to read it. I have heard of using chromatography for purification. If I remember correctly, R/S enantiomers will have slightly different characteristics that can be purified by selecting a specific medium for the one of interest?  Something akin to running the product through chromatography, then having a medium that is R or S. The enantioselective one will proceed through at a quicker rate, while the other will be slowed significantly...?   I'll check it out the link and see it's the same concept. Thanks Deb!  Actually, you just gave me an idea!? So, if a known reaction produces a racemic product (more or less 50/50), I wonder if that same products properties/effects would be identical to that of a 50/50 mixture made from pure R & S enantiomers? Logically, of course it should, but I haven't heard of this being tried for verification? If anyone has a reference for this I'm very curious. I love stereochemistry, maybe something I will look into for a research project if it hasn't already been done?"
Nootropics,3d7f3s,rmcfar11,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:15:50 2015 UTC,So you are talking about splitting an enantiomeric compound into it's enantiomers and then blending them in a perfect 1:1 ratio?

I'd be curious to see if they are identical. What I'm getting at is a racemic is 50/50 of two enantiomers, but since enantiomers can have drastically different effects, I'm wondering if they would go back togethor just as they were in the racemate form.  We know for sure that enantiomers are mirror images of each other, and we know that specific reaction mechanisms will create a racemic mixture. Has anyone ever studied whether a prefectly purified 1:1 mixture of separate enantiomers imparts identical characteristics/effects to the racemic? I suppose what I'm getting at is there is quite a bit of work that goes into purification and I'm now wondering if the end result is identical to the pre purified racemic. From what I do know, chemistry says they would be the same based on the principles of stereochemistry, but has anyone ever verified this before? In the most simple sense, performing a stereochemical Retro Synth. That probably sounds like a waste of time and money lol, but that is where my mind went in my last response. :-)"

Nootropics,3d7f3s,123abc123abcdsfdlsf,2,Mon Jul 20 19:43:48 2015 UTC,"Right, I am just explaining why drug companies have not gone after it. Cephalon already has Nuvigil, which is R-Modafinil. Coming out with S-modafinil would kind of negate their statements about the R enantiomer being superior. Also, they were bought by Teva Pharmaceuticals, which is a large pharma company that is striking deals for generic distribution in Europe.

Nootropics,3d9qyc,GreenTeaBD,11,Tue Jul 14 16:36:26 2015 UTC,"This is a poor idea.  First of all, as others have pointed out, the upside is low.  But vaping introduces substantial risk.    It's not clear that a concentrated solution of Tianeptine sodium in PG / VG is heat stable enough to avoid rapidly clogging the atomizer / coil and building up a whole bunch of unknown degradation byproducts in the juice (and thus in the vapor).  The pH will be basic, which at high temp could potentially cause corrosion of the resistance wire and leach metal ions into the juice.    Even if Tianeptine is heat stable and doesn't cross react with the PG / VG or resistance wire at high temp, it will likely taste terrible.  In general if something is irritating or caustic in the mouth, it will be even more irritating or caustic if taken parenterally.  The effects of repeated exposure to an alkaline vapor with high concentrations of Tianeptine sodium on bronchial / lung tissue are unknown, but may be serious / potentially irreversible."

Nootropics,3d5vtq,MisterYouAreSoDumb,2,Tue Jul 14 21:46:21 2015 UTC,For sure. I am actually starting to trial all three Semax variants out in a single spray. I think mixing all three in an appropriate ratio would lead to better effects than each individually. I am just trying to settle on the ratios now.

Nootropics,3d5vtq,theskepticalidealist,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:18:41 2015 UTC,Ooh nice. Are you doing this with other peptides?
Nootropics,3d5vtq,MisterYouAreSoDumb,3,Tue Jul 14 18:27:30 2015 UTC,"We are doing it with all the peptides that are nasally bioavailable. Also, we have created new dropper cap molds, and used high-stability ink, on our 30ml dropper bottles. Some of our original caps we had manufactured leaked, and the Caffeine/NALT solution would wear off the organic based ink on the glass dropper. We had the manufacturer go back to square one, and make us badass new ones that address all those issues. We also have calibrated 15ml and 60ml bottles on the way as well. We actually filled a whole 40 foot shipping container with 180,000 bottles!  On top of the nasal spray kits, we have new plastic trays with magnetic enclosure boxes, that will hold our peptide vials in shipping. So they will clip right into premade slots, and be completely protected during shipping. Once we get the nasal kits and peptide trays in, we are going to work on similar boxes for our solution bottles. So eventually all our peptide and solution shipments will come in specially designed kits, with our logo on the box, and magnetic enclosures. I am super excited!"

Nootropics,3d5vtq,MisterYouAreSoDumb,2,Tue Jul 14 19:49:32 2015 UTC,"It's actually more legally defensible than premade nasal sprays. Most of the other vendors are at much higher risk for FDA involvement, because they are actively marketing drugs as supplements, and giving dosage and effect information. We have very clear statements regarding our products, and never use the word ""supplement"" or ""dose"" on non-approved substances. Look at Chaos and Pain. They are labeling SARMs as dietary supplements, while also giving dosage and effect information. That is just stupid. New vendors pop up every day, putting non-approved drugs in their dietary supplement blends, with dosing and effect instructions. Those dosing and effect claims are going to be the first thing the FDA clamps down on.  We've done a lot of due diligence on the legalities of what we are doing, and have consulted with lawyers on the specifics of everything. I also have backup plans in place, in case things start to turn south. We've already had to fight a few battles in the background, that I never clued most people into.

Nootropics,3d3opd,ushmel,7,Mon Jul 13 15:38:46 2015 UTC,"Take a gander at: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/5-HT2A_receptor.  Seems to me this is the mechanism of cannabis's psychedelic effects, as well as glaucoma relief effects (decreased intraocular pressure).   Newer antipsychotics are antagonists of 5HT2A as well, which could explain why some people (who are predisposed or otherwise susceptible) experience psychosis after cannabis use.   But I haven't looked much into it, I'm just basing this off general knowledge.   Edit- The paper extrapolates this to memory deficit in particular. This co-receptor complex is responsible for the amnesic effects of THC. It's simply laying groundwork for further studies trying to delineate THC's nociceptive (pain relief) effects from its amnesic effects. Drug development labs can try and synthesize THC analogs with less affinity for this receptor complex to reduce the side effect of memory impairment, while keeping pain relief."

Nootropics,3d3opd,pha3dra,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:13:59 2015 UTC,"This study isn't about drug-drug interactions, but rather a continuation of previous studies by the same authors where they found that CB1 and 5-HT2A receptors form a complex (i.e. they interact together in the membrane). Due to this interaction - in principle - this 2 receptor heterocomplex leads to a different response compared to each receptor by itself, although the authors haven't figured out how these receptors cross-talk. The authors found, however,  that this complex is most likely implicated in the THC induced memory impairment, because when they knocked the 5-HT2A receptor gene (sort of 'deleted' it) in mice, the amnesiac and anxiolytic effect of THC were significantly reduced (by comparing mice behavior). They're trying to pave the way for THC-analogs for the drug industry. However, from this point they can now research the signaling pathway activated by THC and other CB1 ligands on this heterocomplex. This may have wider implications in neuroscience than just drug designing. Who knows if it has an active role in depression or not?   Apart from other still unknown effects from this cross-talk, taking 5-HT2A antagonists likely affect the density of this receptor, making it either more or less likely to form heterocomplexes with CB1. From this paper point of view reducing the density of 5-HTA2 receptors will lead to more resilience to THC-induced amnesiac effects. The inverse situation is also true.  Imho, knocking out 5-HT2A leads to a phenotype that is way broader than what the authors considered, which I think could affect the interpretation of this data. However, it's pretty neat to know that there are interactions between this receptors.  TL;DR. It probably doesn't affect the THC psychoactive effect, but rather your resilience (or lack of thereof) to THC-induced amnesia and anxiety."

Nootropics,3d505k,VultureInQuotes,3,Mon Jul 13 15:58:24 2015 UTC,"4 x a week at 2 grams means you always have some running around your system. Even a small amount in your system might help with the situation. Stop completely to find out.  Phenibut only works partially like Benzo's so i imagine the withdrawal is less extreme. Some benzo's have been shown to absorb into body fat and release slow, don't know if phenibut does this but that could be another possibility"
Nootropics,3d505k,NotHyplon,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:31:57 2015 UTC,"There seems to be some contradictory information about how long it stays in the body but I haven't read anything that claims it is in excess of 24 hours. Since I basically dose every other day, I would think I would have ~24 hour periods with it cleared from my body."
Nootropics,3d505k,NotHyplon,1 point,Tue Jul 14 12:35:31 2015 UTC,"5 hour half life and nearly 10 x standard dose.  T:0= 2 grams  T+5 = 1   T+10 = 0.5  T+15 = 0.25 = normal dose  T+20 = 0.125  T+25 = 0.062  Assuming ideal half life time. Withdrawal does not kick in immediately (6-12 hours, can be much longer depending on substance). So just as withdrawal might start you are redosing."
Nootropics,3d505k,NotHyplon,1 point,Tue Jul 14 12:57:05 2015 UTC,"Thanks for this.  So a ""normal dose"" would be cleared from the body in 24 hours then? I'm on the start of my third day without it now (by coincidence due to travel) so I guess I'll know soon."
Nootropics,3d505k,trillskill,2,Tue Jul 14 13:44:28 2015 UTC,"So general rule of thumb is 5 half-lifes to remove things from your system. Because 2 grams is a high doseage it skews things a bit as shown above.  Thing is phenibut is not as strong as benzo's so you could not have any issues, especially if you have not been taking it for a long time at regular doseages."
Nootropics,3d505k,deckhouse,2,Tue Jul 14 20:07:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah I don't really understand the big deal with it dependence wise, but I've never had a problem not drinking alcohol either so that could be a factor."

Nootropics,3d505k,LazyBuhdaBelly,2,Tue Jul 14 12:23:50 2015 UTC,Some people don't get benzo withdrawals either. It's just a genetic thing it seems. Effexor may upregulate GABA-B receptors (most antidepressants do) and Curcumin and Nac might both be helping prevent tolerance/dependence. Curcumin especially but both can block epigenetic adaptations related to tolerance and dependence.
Nootropics,3d505k,BitcoinOperatedGirl,2,Tue Jul 14 02:11:25 2015 UTC,Interesting. NAC seems to be the Swiss Army Knife of supplements...so many benefits. Creatine is the similar similar in terms of multiple benefits and it's super cheap. If I could only pick two supplements these would be my two.
Nootropics,3d505k,jjBioTech,4,Tue Jul 14 12:19:19 2015 UTC,"Well it could make sense if you think about it as: Phenibut is GABA with a phenyl group on it, right? So if you have a GABA deficiency or some GABA abnormality the brain might not downregulate GABA receptors in response to its action. The drug's similar enough to the neurotransmitter that the high individual variability makes sense.  So yeah, you could be GABA Man."

Nootropics,3d505k,trillskill,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:12:59 2015 UTC,TLDR:  I seem to be immune to phenibut dependence and withdrawal despite regular use. Anyone else experience this?
Nootropics,3d505k,I_am_a_kitten_AMA,9,Mon Jul 13 16:01:02 2015 UTC,"You said you only started using this much recently. GABA downregulation is relatively slow, compared to dopamine downregulation, it takes longer to build a tolerance. So, tolerance could be creeping up on you very slowly. Some of the people who built very high tolerances built them up very slowly. After 4-6 weeks, they feel 2 grams isn't enough anymore, so they move up to 3. FWIW, 2 grams is already a lot. Not sure how much you weigh, but if I took 2 grams, I'd probably be quite incapacitated, past what I consider desirable even in a party setting. For daytime anxiolysis I'd aim for 500-700mg, and for a party I'd go for 1 to 1.25g.  A confounding factor is that you're already taking anxiolytic medication, both tianeptine and Effexor. This could be masking rebound anxiety, which is a common effect of GABAergic withdrawal. I've had a relatively mild withdrawal before, and well, it sent me into a manic episode. I felt euphoric, had loads of energy, no appetite. I felt great, until I realized that it was 6AM and I wasn't falling asleep anytime soon. Sleep deprivation crept upon me over several days, until I was completely unable to focus on anything. Insomnia and lack of appetite are two things you should definitely be watching out for.  Finally, it is possible that your GABAergic circuits don't downregulate as fast or as much as other people. Everyone's neurochemistry is unique. I've seen people who drink alcohol much more often than I do but seem to have much less tolerance, it hits them super hard every time. Just don't count on this, be somewhat careful. You probably don't need to use phenibut this often, so I'd encourage you not to. I'd also encourage you to never increase the dose. If you feel that it's lost some of its effectiveness, the appropriate response is to space out usage, not to increase dosage."

Before then, Usenet was largely restricted to colleges and universities. Every year in September, a large number of incoming freshmen would acquire access to Usenet for the first time, and would take some time to become accustomed to Usenet's standards of conduct and ""netiquette"". But, after a month or so, these new users would either learn to comply with the networks' social norms or simply tire of using the service. However, for the existing userbase, the influx of new users from September 1993 onwards was a new and endless manifestation of the phenomenon.

Nootropics,3d1ujq,Legend-Disc,2,Mon Jul 13 19:20:38 2015 UTC,"/r/steroids does pretty well with their policy of having a minimum period before being able to post new topics. They even have regular off-topic and ""ask anything"" threads that allow newbies to still interact and learn from the veterans. In addition, preventing newbies from posting new topics doesn't stop them from posting in threads; what it does do, however, is prevent noobs from posting irrelevant topics and derailing the subreddit.   To clarify, this kind of policy won't stop new users from interacting and learning. Instead, it will concentrate the amount of noise to particular threads instead of having the noise overtake the subreddit. New users can still post questions if they have any in the ""ask anything"" and off-topic threads, and with the minimum time, they'll be encouraged to read the FAQ and research before asking questions that might have already been answered. This teaches them the essential skill of researching to find answers for oneself as well as obtaining the ability to pick out good and bad sources of information. I know of no other way for subreddits to deal with large influxes of new members and keep their signal to noise ratio high, while allowing new users to simply post new threads willy nilly unless the moderators put in absurd amounts of effort to monitor the subreddit."

And unlike pizza, plenty of people don't react to certain racetams at all.  I find piracetam, more than any other racetam, increases membrane permeability, making it a good racetam to dose if you want to make just about any stack stronger and just about any drug kick in better--mix it with ALCAR and you're in BBB permeability heaven (or hell, depending on what's in your bloodstream).  Pramiracetam and Aniracetam seem like two sides to the same coin: Ani is very anxiolytic but still tunes you up to a higher level than baseline. Pramiracetam is very analytical and produces clear thinking with far less of a ""high"" than something like piracetam.  Faso and Colu both fit into similar categories. I prefer the effects of fasoracetam, of the two--it seems to boost working memory more than any of the others. I couldn't really figure out what was up with Colu, and will probably experiment a little more with it in the future.  Phenylpiracetam is like if Adderall and Piracetam had a baby; very speedy, prone to causing irritability, and rapidly producing tolerance.  That's all the time I have to discuss them right now.

I became more verbally fluent, motivation and confidence skyrocketed for my standards;   I had about 3 days of doses, and after that I thought: okay, now let's find the most effective racetam for me. I had anxiety issues, so when I found on the internet that aniracetam is supposedly better version of piracetam and kills off anxiety and improves creativity (I'm a musician), I thought bingo and bought 100g. What followed was that my shipment arrived, and then I've tried various different doses ranging from microdosing to megadosing and I'd always get shitty depression, anhedonia and amotivation from it, after a dose I'd just lay in bed having extreme brain fog.

I am trying a medium dose (3mg) in conjunction with 5mg Vyvance today at zero amphetamine tolerance to see how well it might work as an attenuator of stimulants. Yesterday it seemed to have the surprising effect of drastically increasing my endurance with anabolic exercise, but I have yet to confirm this with repeated trials.  Overall, at doses of around 5mg the drug is very sedating but in a very relaxed way. Doses closer to 2-3mg seems to be where its at for a more functional effect.

It's just that good all-in-one package.   Also because piracetam is a simple molecule, it has wide range of 'general' effects (like increasing amount of oxygen that gets to the brain, or helping hemispheres of the brain connect with each other - IIRC other noots don't do that). Usually, more 'complicated' a molecule is, the more 'defined' and specific effects it has, more selectivity."

More than that, and I get lethargic in the mornings.  I haven't seen any negative effects from using it in ~5mg doses nightly for over a week. There was a study (I can't find it right now but it's definitely there) using it in children under 14 for 3 months at doses of over 10mg per night without any deleterious effects, though. It's a very safe sleep-aid. Some of the subjects were tested years (two years, I think) after the experiment and had continued the regimen without insult.

Nootropics,3d4psg,ThirdHuman,3,Mon Jul 13 14:38:13 2015 UTC,"If your body has low-functioning MAOs, then cigarettes could be causing an antagonistic effect on your mood. Tobacco smoke has very low doses of the MAOIs harman and norharman. Perhaps they were chronically elevating your levels of neurotransmitters and producing a stress response that your body couldn't properly attenuate due to the lack of normal MAO activity.  The tobacco MAOIs can also just cause your mood to adopt a more extreme pattern of vacillation, if you aren't smoking constantly. How often did you smoke?"
Nootropics,3d4psg,Debonaire_Death,2,Mon Jul 13 22:08:53 2015 UTC,"Another factor is absorption rate.  Nicotine is absorbed into the blood stream far quicker from tobacco smoke than from vapor.

This is also what modulates the addictive power of cigarettes and other tobacco products -- without the MAO-I to potentiate and extend the secondary, minimal, transient dopaminergic kick from nicotine, as well as increase monoamine NT levels, nicotine alone is hardly habit-forming at all in comparison. In fact, nicotine is a nootropic itself.   I see no reason why you couldn't see a reduction in anxiety by switching to vaping, for a number of reasons. Besides the MAO-I aspect, vaping provides a much smoother curve of plasma nicotine levels, with a peak level (after an hour of vaping!) still ~50% lower than the level from smoking 1 cigarette, so those sustained lower nicotine levels from vaping, in contrast to the roller-coaster up-and-down nic delivery of smoking, could also be helping mitigate your anxiety. There's also the proven anxiety-inducing effects of high CO2 levels (and decreased oxygen levels) in your bloodstream from the smoke itself.

Maybe we all have the potential but not the environmental factors, yet chance dicates that more than a few people per generation would be considered genius if everyone had the potential. so idk about that.  btw I am extremely skeptical of bigfoot claims, flat earthers,hollow earthers, that hitler is still alive living in the hollow earth, 911 truthers, and a bunch of shit"
Nootropics,3d2nz4,AZNman1111,2,Tue Jul 14 00:51:43 2015 UTC,"TL;DR   We observed that in microglial pre-treatment with tianeptine (1-10uM) reduced the expression of microglial activation markers (CD40 and MHCII) and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Moreover, in adult animals subjected to prenatal stress (an animal model of depression) chronic tianeptine treatment inhibited microglial activation (decreased CD40 and CD68 expression) in both examined structures. In conclusion, our results show that tianeptine exerts anti-inflammatory properties suppressing microglial activation in both in vitro and in vivo experimental models.   With different methods it was determined that tianeptine reduces inflammation in the hippocampus and the frontal lobe. Recently, poor hippocampus function has been implicated in depression. This is such a fascinating article. Especially because tianeptine is thought to reduce activity in the amygdala, responsible for adrenaline rushes in the ""fight-or-flight"" response."

Does anyone have any idea if this mechanism of tianeptine (on microglia) would be mediated through its mu or delta o. agonism? I kind of hope it's not. ... I could be wrong, but I thought I remember reading some information about mu antagonism having microglia modulating and anti-neuroinflammatory effects, inhibiting cytokine production or release and having consequent neuroprotective and antidepressive benefits. ... Or at least, this literature was stating that low dose naltrexone had these immunological effects, but I can't recall for sure which of naltrexone's properties were said to be responsible for this. ... Anyway, maybe someone could help clarify.     (Btw if having trouble finding the abstract, just search the PDF document for ""tianeptine"" or go to page 28 in it.)"
Nootropics,3d2nz4,ROTAM,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:38:08 2015 UTC,"Just to clarify, microglia is a bit of a misnomer for these cells. Microglia are the resident macrophages of the central nervous system, which originate in the bone marrow (same as other macrophages). They are part of the immune system, as opposed to ""true"" glial cells, the macroglia, which are native to the central nervous system. Macroglia are the ones we refer to as ""supporting and nourishing"" the neurons. In that light, it seems to me the article is primarily saying that tianeptine has anti inflammatory properties in the CNS.   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microglia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroglia#Macroglia"

Nootropics,3d2udh,aleph32,3,Mon Jul 13 17:43:23 2015 UTC,"If you are going to separately measure each dose then there is no need for a filler.  (To use a capsule machine you would need a filler.)  Tianeptine is very hygroscopic.  One advantage of a filler is that it can preferentially absorb moisture.  Here is an excerpt from a PDF slide presentation I came across on a pharmacy site:   Hygroscopic powders are powders that can absorb moisture from the air and tend to get damp and clumpy. Deliquescent powders absorb so much moisture from the air, they can actually solubilize themselves and transform from a powder into a solution. Therefore, we must prevent this from occurring in our formulation. The first strategy is the same as for efflorescent powders, namely to store these powders in a tight container, preferably in an area of low humidity to limit access to moisture from the air. The second strategy would be to add an inert powder that would preferentially absorb any water or moisture from the air. Depending on the formulation, there may already be an ingredient present that can fulfill this function. Thus, if there is a large amount of bulk or diluting powders in the formulation, they will often preferentially absorb moisture and no other ingredients are needed. However, if that is not the case, then you can add a suitable inert, water insoluble powder. A commonly used example of such a powder is lactose. Lactose does not provide any therapeutic effect but can absorb the moisture first, and keep it away from the hygroscopic or deliquescent powder. Light magnesium oxide is also sometimes used for this purpose but has to be used in small amounts to avoid therapeutic effects.   EDIT: According to the Ceretropic page, tianeptine sulfate is not hygroscopic like the sodium salt form."

The best way to go about testing any new combinations is to research the purported interaction to the best of your ability, then take enough of one of the substances to achieve an active effect before incrementally adding small doses of the other substance, carefully waiting for and noting any change in effect. Obviously there are some combos, like caffeine/l-theanine, where such caution is unwarranted. It's something that needs to be judged on a case-by-case basis, and then only after you have independently tried both of the substances in question and are familiar with how your body reacts to them.  Also, keep in mind that drugs and supplements can change their effects when used in combination. A lot of people incredulously disdain of certain supplement blends because ""all of the doses are below active levels""... in many cases, substances don't need to be at their active dose for isolated use to exhibit an effect as part of a combination."
Nootropics,3czs6u,Debonaire_Death,3,Sun Jul 12 16:51:53 2015 UTC,Good response. One thing I'm not so sure about though: the idea that feeling unpleasantly overstimulated = excitotoxicity.
Nootropics,3czs6u,Debonaire_Death,3,Sun Jul 12 17:55:58 2015 UTC,"I experienced similar discomfort when I made the mistake of mixing unifiram and cannabis, a combination that has high risk of producing glutamatergic excitotoxicity.  Still, it's a very good issue to bring up. It's frustrating that there isn't an authoritative consensus on the physiological symptoms of excitotoxicity. I've experimented with drugs enough that I've developed my theories about certain sensations being correlated with excitotoxicity, but I'm only basing my conclusions off of untested evidence."

To be honest my field in CS/math so I really can't understand the abstract you linked to. I read tons of neuroscience/biochem research because I find it fascinating and have learned a ton but I am by no means as informed as a student of the field. unless you are - I don't see how you could draw any conclusions from that abstract.   The main points of the abstract appear to be:   In more than half of the tested cells, ICa was resistant to both piracetam and GVS-111. In the rest of the cells, ICa decreased 19 +/- 7% with 2 mM of piracetam and 39 +/- 14% with 2 microM of GVS-111. 4. IK(V) in almost all cells tested was resistant to piracetam at concentrations up to 2 mM. However, IK(V) in two-thirds of the cells was sensitive to GVS-111, being suppressed 49 +/- 18% with 1 microM GVS-111. 5. IK(Ca) appeared to be the most sensitive current of those studied to both piracetam and GVS-111.   and the conclusion:   Piracetam at 1 mM and GVS-111 at 0.1 microM decreased the amplitude of IK(Ca) in most of the cells examined by 49 +/- 19% and 69 +/- 24%, respectively. 6. The results suggest that piracetam and GVS-111 suppression of voltage-activated calcium and potassium currents of the neuronal membrane may regulate (both up and down) Ca2+ influx into neurons.   let me preface this by saying the only neuroscience/biochem I know is from my own personal research in my spare time - so I may be wrong. I actually drew the opposite conclusion; that is to say ICa was resistant to piracetam and its peptide analog GVS-111. furthermore, IKv decreased from the peptide analog. IF ICa is resistant and IKv decreased from piracetam and the peptide then how did you conclude these pathways are potentiated????   why are you under the impression that big pharma is the only game in  town? I am just starting grad school and my entire goal in life right now is becoming a prolific publisher (tryin to increase my air - douche number!

Also, acetylcholine production and utilization is rate-limited at several steps (i.e enzymatic production, uptake into neurons, etc) , so no, taking a bunch of choline will not necessarily increase acetycholine signaling if these processes are already saturated.

The reason it works well for some people is that it calms down their decision making process. It doesn't actually positively act on the memory forming areas of the brain as a nootropic should.   Modafinil Increases the Latency of Response in the Hayling Sentence Completion Test in Healthy Volunteers: A Randomised Controlled Trial   Principal Findings  Participants dosed with modafinil had significantly longer mean response latencies on the HSCT for both the response initiation and response inhibition compared to participants dosed with placebo. However, participants in both groups made a similar number of errors on each of these measures, indicating that modafinil did not enhance the accuracy of performance of the task relative to placebo.  Conclusions  This study demonstrated that administration of single 200 mg doses of modafinil to healthy individuals increased the latency of responses in the performance of the HSCT, a task that is highly sensitive to prefrontal executive function, without enhancing accuracy of performance. This finding may provide important clues to defining the limitations of modafinil as a putative cognitive enhancer."

From:  Antibody wipeout found to relieve chronic fatigue syndrome   “I was completely revitalised,” says Karen. “Suddenly, I could be sociable again. I would go to work, go home, eat dinner and feel restless.”  She was one of 18 people with CFS who reported improvements after taking rituximab as part of a small trial in Bergen, Norway  The latest study implicates the immune system, at least in some cases. Rituximab wipes out most of the body’s B-cells, which are the white blood cells that make antibodies.

Furthermore, GABA inhibited the rise in cytoplasmic Ca2+ of Beta-cells in response to 16.7 mM glucose.

Nootropics,3cxbcc,matznerd,2,Sat Jul 11 21:56:59 2015 UTC,"If you are looking at biology-related topic areas you may want to look into bio-engineering for the use of pharmaceuticals and other ingredients. Suntheanine for example, uses a biological process with enzymes that yield pure L-isomer theanine that is far superior to synthetically derived versions. Cheese production also owes a lot to genetic modification and biological engineering of enzymes. It would otherwise require the slaughter of massive amounts of baby cows to get the required rennet enzyme. With technologies like CRISPR on the horizon, the ability to cut-and-paste genes will likely lead to an even greater ability to harness the power of biology.  Suntheanine Patent:   The inventors made research to overcome the above-described problem and found that theanine was able to be synthesized at high yield through the use of glutaminase derived from microbes of one or more of Bacillus, mold and yeast, and an amount of by-product was exceedingly small. Thus, the inventors completed the invention basically. More specifically, the present invention is directed to a method of making theanine wherein glutaminase derived from microbes of one or more of Bacillus, mold and yeast is caused to act on glutamine and ethylamine derivative.  The invention provides an efficient novel method of making theanine and can realize simple industrially advantageous production. More specifically, a higher conversion rate to theanine was admitted through the use of glutaminase derived from microbes of one or more of Bacillus, mold and yeast, whereupon industrial production is realized.    You Can Thank Genetic Engineering For Your Delicious Cheese    But in the 1970s, America’s growing appetite for cheese collided with its mounting aversion to killing newborn cows. Anticipating a crisis of supply and demand, researchers turned to a then-unprecedented technology in food science: genetically modified organisms. The result was a genetically altered bacterium that produced cheesemaking enzymes in a beaker, instead of an animal’s stomach. This revolutionized the cheese industry. Today, the vast majority of cheese is made with enzymes produced not by baby animals, but genetically modified microbes.  By any measure, the use of GMOs in the production of cheese is among the greatest feats of modern food science."

Nootropics,3cxbcc,matznerd,2,Sat Jul 11 22:11:40 2015 UTC,"Glad to be of help! I am very interested in finding the most pure and nature-identical forms of the molecules I consume. Cognizin, the best and only free-base form of citicoline, also comes from enzymatic production:   II. Effect of the production process applied to the novel food  Citicoline is produced from orotic acid and choline chloride in an enzymatic process facilitated by inactivated Corynebacterium ammoniagenes and Escherichia coli. Cultured bacteria are inactivated by xylene before the enzymatic reaction is initiated with the addition of orotic acid and choline chloride. The enzymatic process is terminated by the addition of sulphuric acid (H2SO4) and heating to 60°C. Citicoline is isolated from the growth media in a series of extraction and purification steps resulting in a highly purified product.  III. History of the organism used as the source of the novel food  Orotic acid and choline chloride comprise the actual source of citicoline, with C. ammoniagenes and E. coli being the sources of the enzymatic process. Orotic acid is found in the milk of ruminants including cows, goats and sheep. Choline chloride is a member of the water-soluble B-vitamin family and is approved in the EU for use as a source of choline in dietetic foods (PARNUTS) including infant and follow-on formula.  IV. – VIII. GM Aspects  Though part of the enzymatic process originates in genetically modified (GM) E. coli, the final product does not fall within the scope of the GM Food and Feed Regulation EC No. 1829/2003 for a number of reasons. Firstly, xylene is added to the bacterial mix before the production of citicoline begins and, therefore, a viable GMO does not form part of the production process. Secondly, citicoline is purified from the growth media and not isolated or extracted from bacterial cells, while DNA from the GM E. coli is not detected in the final ingredient. This means the GM E. coli is considered to function as a processing aid in the production of citicoline. Finally, the E. coli enzymes are considered a processing aid as they are demonstrably absent from the final product"

Nootropics,3cvvnm,flare1028us,4,Sat Jul 11 23:57:14 2015 UTC,"PMC full-text here: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4245909/  Some relevant parts perhaps -     Ageing of the brain is marked by a major decrease in the number of new neurons generated in the DG. This decrease has been attributed both to a reduction of the NSC pool and to an increased state of quiescence of the remaining stem cells (Lugert et al., 2010; Encinas et al., 2011; Jaskelioff et al., 2011; Seib et al., 2013). The possibility to increase neurogenesis in ageing mice by activating the quiescent stem cell pool is currently the focus of intensive research. In this regard, it was recently shown that systemic factors from young animals can re-activate neurogenesis in aged mice (Katsimpardi et al., 2014). However, disruption of quiescence signals can lead to a short-lived increase in neurogenesis, followed by a sharp decrease caused by a loss of quiescent NSCs (Ehm et al., 2010; Mira et al., 2010; Song et al., 2012). Assessing precisely how factors and signals affect stem cell behavior will be vital to understand their long-term effects on adult neurogenesis. Lineage tracing and particularly clonal analysis of NSCs in the DG have begun to provide evidence of the great diversity of responses of adult NSCs to stimuli, which can affect both their proliferation and differentiation potentials (Bonaguidi et al., 2011; Dranovsky et al., 2011; Song et al., 2012).    Overall, we don't have the answer to that type of question. There are many different regions in the brain that express various factors differently, and respond to neurogenesis in a different way, it appears. Regarding BDNF and NGF increasing substances, I honestly don't know. I don't think they are as potent as ""systemic factors from young animals"", but it's hard to say. That's the problem with long-term questions, since so many things play a role and most of the NGF/BDNF increasing nootropics are not well enough researched to be fully understood mechanistically either. At least not by Western standards. I hope we can get some answers to those puzzling questions within the next couple of decades."

Pick one. Always reach past comfort zone, and always vary which comfort zone you are focusing on.  Train your will. A diet can do this. Breathing meditation. Maybe abstain from some behaviour of your choosing. Maybe a simple mental-emotional exercise such as smiling whenever you overhear someone complaining.

Some of the biohacking stuff, a la Tim Ferriss and Dave Asprey definitely apply to me, but those guys are salesmen at heart, so you really have to do your own research in this space.  I will list some of my activities in this space with the hopes of sparking some kind of discussion:   Brain Training - Chess, Counter Strike (I play with a very deliberate training routine daily), and just starting Dual N Back Functional Body movement - I have a very personalized stretching routine which I have pieced together from Yoga, Tai Chi, Crossfit etc. I feel that proper body movement aids cognition, as it becomes one less thing to commit high level brain function to. If your body just works well, then it makes your day easier. I also do light running. Supplements - I have experimented with many of the nootropics, and found little of substantial effectiveness. I have found the racetams to be potent anti-depressants however. I do take more nutritional supplements, like vitamin D and fish oil for example. Intellectual pursuits - I keep a notebook where I place my notes on neuroscience, computer science, machine learning and mathematics. This has become a very fun activity for me. At the end of my day, I'll sit on my computer and start reading research papers and dive through the lists of references. I keep it rather free form, and let my curiosity and intuition guide the selection of materials. I learn quite a lot, and I keep it all in the notebook so I can refresh the knowledge the next day. This has resulted in learning a considerable amount about the topics at hand with a relatively small time investment, which probably would have otherwise been spent playing video games. This also has made me begun to review math textbooks and whatnot, as I have become somewhat rusty on notation and the more technical aspects of these areas.  Also just the idea of keeping a notebook in general, is amazing. Your memory is fallible, so just write things down. Nearly all great men I have studied had a practice of writing. No Fap - I came to this one strictly from the idea of dopamine regulation. It seems very plausible that large dopamine spikes from porn have downstream effects on you for the rest of the day/week. I think occasional fap without porn or actual sex are ok, it seems unlikely our reproductive system would be inherently harmful to us. But porn definitely seems problematic.    Somethings I shave not gotten into deeply, but am looking to incorporate:   Neurofeedback training - I think the ability to willfully increase bloodflood to the prefrontal cortex would be highly beneficial. Sometimes I use an inversion table, and while hanging upside down the blood rushes to your head. I notice a remarkable clarity of thought while doing this, so I think this would be useful. Heart Rate variability training - I sometimes get social anxiety. Apparently this helps you control that.          I suppose both of the above are also side effects of good meditative practice.   Image Streaming - This is is a rather fringy idea, but I am going to give it a try anyway. http://www.winwenger.com/imstream.htm If it works, then great. It it's bullshit then at least I can share with others."

Now that I'm past my cave dwelling days I feel that I have a considerable advantage when playing sports that require these things and don't feel that I need to think very hard at all. I kinda just let my body play and it does it well.   I've cut out Porn as well. You can read and research on NoFap/YBOP/Articles for a long time. At first I tried to use the justifications that they use (""superpowers"") to persuade myself to stop. Then I came to a similar conclusion that the dopamine spikes were the issue. My last faps prior to quitting I recognized the intense euphoria I would find at the end of a session and the eminent lack of motivation and apathetic feels that plagued me afterwards.  In the end the decision that is making me stay off Porn is more so about self-control and meditation. I see my urges to succumb to fapping as a mental test and if I am in control of my fap urges then I am in control of my mind.

Things I'm currently working on or planning to soon:   Stoicism/CBT/nootropics for anxiety elimination and confidence Weightlifting 3 times a week for fitness and strength High intensity training like the 7 minute workout for aerobic fitness Brain training games, particularly Dual-N-Back for short term memory etc Cronometer.com for nutrition tracking Paleo/keto/slow carb diets for maintaining weight and reducing disease risk factors Sleep routine and a daylight lamp in the morning for resetting/maintaining a good sleep pattern Dopamine reduction through NoFap and cutting down on internet/TV/music/snacking/sugary foods/constant daydreaming At least 30 minutes of breathing meditation per day  Mindfulness meditation as I go about the day Getting into daily and weekly routines, and automating as much as possible, to reduce decision fatigue (see Superhuman by Habit - great book on habit formation and the importance of habits) Cold showers to build willpower and improve hair/skin Working at a standing desk rather than sitting Willpower training e.g. doing everything with your weaker hand for a week Reading about a variety of subjects, taking notes for future reference Watching interesting TED talks Using Anki (awesome, free spaced repetition software) for memorisation of university material and maintaining memories Minimalist lifestyle for less stress and easier cleaning etc Fasting periodically (5 days, 600 calories per day) Pomodoro technique for studying Making interesting smoothies with tons of vegetables, some fruit, coconut oil etc for extra nutrients Taking supplements made from superfoods like Spirulina, Lycopene, Curcumin etc Using To-do lists, calendars etc better for organisation (see Getting Things Done) Improving posture and practicing power posturing (see Amy Cuddy TED talk ) Improving allergies/eczema with supplements e.g. Spirulina, Nigella Sativa etc Reading books on conversational skills Thinking about joining a debate club to get better at public speaking"
Nootropics,3ctoa2,Euhn,3,Mon Jul 13 07:25:04 2015 UTC,How many of you have...   Abused drugs and experienced a residual and negative change as a result? Have social anxiety or have issues with emotional intelligence? Find motivation to do things like excercise (consistent reward for effort) but not so much for things like studying (very long term reward for lots of effort)?
Nootropics,3ctoa2,DaMan11,2,Mon Jul 13 20:47:18 2015 UTC,"(1) Nope.  (2) Before, but that was ~3 years ago. Gradual feedback improved my position.  (3) I've been improving. I did have strong difficulties getting myself to study, and of course still have some difficulty like other people. These have reduced as time has gone on and as I've learned to be more responsible and keep focus.  I know that there might be a correlation between ""edgy"" ideas and social maladjustment. I'm also aware that working on second-order or third-order skills instead of the skills directly can be seen as a form of avoidance. It's possible to approach these objectives from a non-narcissistic/non-compensating set of intentions, even though there might be co-morbidity between those mindsets and wanting to work on (n+1)-order/primarily instrumental goals.  I'm sorry if I'm making assumptions about your stance, but I'm trying to cover my bases. I'd much rather people make their points directly and I don't like it when people try to do lead-ins."
Nootropics,3ctoa2,Iron-willing,2,Mon Jul 13 21:39:20 2015 UTC,"The assumption is correct, and this was just a way to try to collect information without any biases that aren't already clearly expressed by answering these questions.

Nootropics,3ctoa2,liberated-cheese,2,Fri Jul 10 18:57:41 2015 UTC,"I'd like to consider myself to be an aspiring Ubermenschen. I am constantly striving to achieve the perfect mind/body and intelligently apply scientific advancements to achieve my goal.  I personally use nootropics, AAS, weight training, meditation (normal and extreme environments), and brain training games to pursue my goal.  I believe within the next century we will have transcended far beyond basic human capabilities in terms of intelligence/physical enhancements. I think technology will play a large role in this as well. Nootropics/Muscle growth are the building blocks for improving our base however I believe technology, specifically biological enhancements, will bring us far beyond base level.   If there are any Warhammer 40k fans out there, I incidentally base my goal somewhat on Space Marines. I think they represent what humanity will end up moving towards with less emphasis on strength and more emphasis on intelligence."

Nootropics,3ctoa2,NewToNoot,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:50:08 2015 UTC,"Right now I float about every 2 weeks. I haven't tried it on psychoactive substances yet. Float tanks are a short meditation retreat for me. It helps me be more awakened and more present. The biggest thing that it adds to me is that once you are so ""in"" the present, you find that time and circumstance are somewhat malleable. When you're not thinking all the time, you can use mental constructs and imagination in thought space more efficiently. You see the chain of causality more clearly as it arises. You can avoid lots of problems when you see them early as little things. You can achieve much bigger goals and dreams because you see the opportunities and steps toward that goal as tiny steps. Goals and problems get put together like legos. The more easily you are able to take ""you"" off like a shoe, the more easily you can see what the present moment is building out of legos and you can change it as you see fit.   Physically, you visual acuity seems to change too. I feel like I see things as more ""3D"" and my eyes seem to focus more widely, so that everything in the vision is much more crisp looking? I don't know how to explain some of it.   Being in the tank for 90 minutes is the equivalent of 5 hours of meditation to me. You go through all the things much faster and let go of all the thoughts much faster."

Nootropics,3ctoa2,caster,2,Sat Jul 11 19:09:28 2015 UTC,We're on the same boat. I'll just throw in one more idea: journaling.
Nootropics,3ctoa2,32363031323031,2,Mon Jul 13 13:21:59 2015 UTC,What benefits do you feel you get from journaling? What kind of things do you tend to write?
Nootropics,3ctoa2,hkongm,1 point,Mon Jul 13 13:51:40 2015 UTC,"Mostly it makes me more emotionally stable and grounded. Also I often feel lighter after journaling, like I don't have to keep juggling so many ideas in my head anymore. It clears my mind. The closest comparison I can think of is, it's like defragmenting your hard drive.  Most of the time I write things that bother me, or that I want to remember like self experimentation results. Also I use journaling to analyse my past mistakes, successes, and plan accordingly. These days I use it to form the habit of reflecting on the best thing that happened today, and the best thing to happen on the next day. Journaling has laways been a very versatile tool for me.  I highly encourage you to read the scienfitic litterature on the benefits of journaling. What got me started was this video from the Harvard positive psychology course."

Nootropics,3ctoa2,waterfallyo,4,Fri Jul 10 18:31:09 2015 UTC,"Although generally that's a compelling list, strength training routines seems like a significant outlier.  Sure, physical fitness for cognitive performance and general health and fitness is one thing. But ""hyper-efficient"" or comprehensive strength training does not seem like it fits into the puzzle. The demands of body building for muscle mass, weight lifting, etc. are entirely inconsistent with most of the other items on the list.  If you want to get huge muscles and lift cars, or run triathlons or whatever, there is clearly a large body of knowledge for making that happen. But it's quite a different area from the the kinds of brain biohacking that I think this subreddit is primarily interested in."
Nootropics,3ctoa2,know_your_path,2,Fri Jul 10 19:36:46 2015 UTC,"Strength training has profound effects on the brain due to all the signalling pathways it activates. cortisol, hgh, (nor)adrenaline, testosterone, igf1, mgf, lactate, insulin, irisin, hdl, creatinine, NO, interleukin-6 and a myriad of other signalling molecules go through the roof through training, promoting certain anabolic and regulatory processes in the brain."

Nootropics,3cw5uw,leyenda18,6,Sat Jul 11 07:34:25 2015 UTC,Piracetam used to make me into a social butterfly. I find it odd you find it instigating anti-social effects; but there's the testimony for inter-individual variation. May I ask what dose you've been using?
Nootropics,3cw5uw,Sherlockian_Holmes,1 point,Sat Jul 11 14:10:41 2015 UTC,"Same here!! I'm able to hold multiple conversations on piracetam and it also obliterates social anxiety when giving speeches when I up the dose to 9g+ and 2g of choline. But of course, depression tends to happen after that much choline"
Nootropics,3cw5uw,inmy325xi,14,Mon Jul 13 12:17:15 2015 UTC,You mean asocial not antisocial. Or does piracetam make you a sociopath?

Nootropics,3cw5uw,anomie89,4,Sun Jul 12 00:37:48 2015 UTC,It's odd but I get the very opposite from piracetam. Noopept/Phenylpiracetam makes me more anti social. It's interesting the way these things affect people so vastly different.
Nootropics,3cw5uw,wezbrook,6,Sat Jul 11 10:05:59 2015 UTC,"Fan Theory: I think it's dependent on whether or not the idea of being around others is exciting or relaxing to you.  Aside from anxiety some people just get amped up being around their friends but others just get chilled out by it.  I think it's our response to socializing that makes all the difference.  Example: My female friend always has someone around her 24/7, like constantly is doing something, even always having her boyfriend around her (and always wanting to have a boyfriend, never be single).  I've asked her and she says she doesn't like the feeling of being alone if she doesn't have to.  But I'm the opposite, I get uncomfortable around others or I'll feel stifled and like I'm really awkward.  Now lets say we both take 1mg or Xanax.  Do you think she'd react the same way I would?"

That's kind of a good thing, since I'm submissive to the point that I will heavily restrict myself if I think my actions might bother someone. I still had a lot of mental anxiety and I wasn't euphoric/hypomanic in any way; it just felt easier to push through my anxiety."
Nootropics,3cw5uw,odspot,3,Sat Jul 11 15:25:51 2015 UTC,I found myself a little more social when using piracetam. It made it easier to recall conversations and form sentences fluently. I guess that made me enjoy talking to people more.

From the examine link:    Bacopa monnieri can also be supplemented in a leaf or powder form.

On top of that, heavy consumption was not correlated with any increase in heart disease risk.   Another study showed that moderate coffee consumption was correlated with a decreased risk of stroke.  Coffee drinkers are also at a lower risk for liver cancer and other liver diseases.  Coffee and caffeine intake is also associated with a lower risk of elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT) activity in persons at high risk for liver injury.  Daily coffee consumption is also correlated with a substantially lower risk of type 2 diabetes.  Coffee and dietary caffeine intake is also associated with a significant decrease in risk for Parkinson's Disease, for both men and women.  Coffee consumption was also not associated with increased hypertension in women, while sugared or diet cola was.  Caffeine intake was also associated with a lower risk of cognitive decline.

Anxiety, but not the kind of crippling anxiety people commonly think of - the kind that pushes you to make changes in your life rather than run away from your problems. I found myself constantly having a to-do list that seemed overwhelming & I couldn't stop working on things. Introspection, I'm now working towards selling off most of my stuff because I realized I was happier back when everything I owned could fit into a single suitcase (The thought of being able to get up and go at a moments notice was liberating to say the least). I was constantly thinking about how things effected me and what I could do to make changes in my life for the better. My material goods lost their overall value to me. Photos and mementos didn't seem as valuable either because the memories were up in my head. Developed an interest in reading which I haven't had since back in highschool. (Read Flowers for Algernon, which I totally recommend if you're into Nootropics) Fictional books felt much easier to visualize & get involved in than they did before & I genuinely felt like reading was improving my life. Found myself asking a lot more questions about life, how stuff works etc and took a much more genuine interest in things with out constantly focusing whether a question I asked was dumb or not. Didn't drink or self medicate with any alcohol & in general felt like I didn't need all my usual supplements or Caffeine fix to get on with my day. Thinking about what my enemies next move would be in Team Fortress 2 felt much easier during the second week. I didn't adjust my daily play time & already had 1500 hours in-game so I can't imagine it being a placebo. Did a lot less comfort eating and had a much bigger interest in eating good food - cooking dinner for myself felt like a lot less of nuisance. Thinking ""outside the box"" seemed to come much easier. My brother whom I live with was a lot easier to communicate & bond with because I found myself thinking about how he was feeling during a conversation a lot more.   I would say that i'm still feeling the overall effects of those two weeks even today after ceasing microdosing and it has improved my life for the better.  Of course this is all subjective but I would love to see more studies done on microdosing psychedelics because i'm positive people will find some interesting results.

Nootropics,3ctu7y,BronusMaximus,1 point,Sat Jul 11 12:30:05 2015 UTC,"In my experience, 5mg of 4-ACO-DMT is slightly above what I would call a microdose (most people would experience some ""trippy"" effects at this dose). A standard microdose would be around 2 or 3mg I guess.  Also, I'm surprised you didn't experience any tolerance issues: tolerance is supposed to build up quite fast with this one, as with most tryptamines."
Nootropics,3ctu7y,Enywot,2,Sat Jul 11 15:30:02 2015 UTC,"I would be inclined to agree, in my original post I probably shouldn't have left out the fact that I already had a lot of experience with Tryptamines prior to starting. So I DID have a tolerance built up before even before beginning my ""microdosing"". 2-3mg once daily is much more in line with what people would consider doing. Tolerance buildup for me has always been near instantaneous with Tryptamines but has also returned to baseline quite quickly (2-4 weeks). 5mg twice daily (once when I woke up & again at dinner) wasn't even enough to induce even minor visual or auditory hallucinations. I've had mind blowing experiences in the past off 15mg where 30mg a week later caused nothing but a slightly floating feeling. If I had to do it again I would probably take a month off & do 2-3mg sublingually. It can be extremely hit or miss depending on tolerance & what you've eaten during the day. Less is more."

Rather the human brain functions optimally at a very specific set of optimal parameters (although we don't know exactly what those are yet), and some people are on one side of certain variables, while being on the other side in different ones.  Anxiety is a very good example. Some people are more anxious/neurotic and will see cognitive improvements from anxiolytics. Others are overly confident and may actually lose performance with anxiolytics.  Caffeine is a stimulant, which will improve some people's performance (likely most people; especially sleep deprived people). But that doesn't mean it will have that effect on everyone.  The objective is to get to the high point on the bell curve, not to go as far to the right on that graph as humanly possible."

I've never, ever seen anyone suggest super-dosing stimulants for results and I generally see a lot of recognition of ""ymmv"". The closest thing I see to being contrary to what you're suggesting is a strong (and very rational) skepticism for people who report incredibly unlikely things. Placebo is strong as hell. Given that this is more about theobromine (stimulant), this is less about your position on the curve and more about specific reactions to specific substances.  On the other hand, assuming that the usage of theobromine is somehow novel relative to simple caffeine usage, this is a pretty relevant topic to explore for people who have a poor reaction to caffeine. Exploring alternative stimulants is a good thing because they're going to fit people differently.  Your post just seems to be speaking more strongly of people who fail to acknowledge the benefits of depressing substances (as in anxiolytics, sedatives, etc.) in some people which is a bit unrelated to the topic at hand. This isn't about someone with a bad reaction to caffeine using a sedative, this is about someone with a bad reaction to caffeine using a different stimulant."

That, or people taking large doses to ""increase"" the effects.  There is a difference between a sedative and an anxiolytic. Sedatives are related to sleep (e.g. benzodiazepine, morphine), while anxiolytics are related to stress. As far as I know there are no nootropics that are out-and-out sedatives (melatonin?), but correct me if I am wrong.  On the arousal curve people have a specific threshold that is optimal. Overly stimulated people should take anxiolytics, insufficiently stimulated people should, I suppose, take stimulants like caffeine.  The type and amount should be geared towards reaching the optimal state rather than maximizing the amount of effect.  I do agree that /r/nootropics in general is very mature and responsible, and aware of the limited knowledge and variable results that are inherent to nootropics. But a lot of newer people are not."

Nootropics,3csjvi,GekkoPie,2,Fri Jul 10 12:47:17 2015 UTC,"""There is a consensus that it is necessary to increase the dosage gradually and at a sufficiently slow rate. Generally one starts with small daily doses of about 10 or 15mg, then one increases to 30mg 3-4 days later and then increases by 10mg every 3 to 5 days until one reaches the therapeutic dose, which varies from one person to another and is unpredictable. There does not seem to exist any correlation between weight and dose.  Most prescribers recommend not increasing too quickly, even if the drug is well tolerated. Some, however, use a faster increase of 20mg every 3-4 days during the first two weeks, and often the second fortnight, and then slow the progression after the first month to a the slower rate of increase of 10mg every 3 to 4 days or 20mg per week.  When side effects become too severe, it is advisable to remain at the same dosage or to reduce slightly the dose. The two options are available to the prescriber: if the adverse reaction improves rapidly one can increase dose; if it does not improve rapidly, it will be wise to return to the lower dose that did not cause the side effect. We can then try again to increase after one to two weeks if the dose is not sufficient (possibly using half-tablets). Some prescribers remain longer at certain dosages: 30mg, 60mg, 100mg, 150mg... But most see no real advantage in doing that.  Studies have shown that the average therapeutic dose is around 150mg/day and ranged from 30mg/day to 400mg/day. It is the clinical view and the feeling of the patient that must guide dose adjustment. The treatment is totally customized to the individual patient after the first two weeks of treatment in accordance with the patient’s response to therapy. There is no established ceiling dose as long as the patient tolerates the treatment.""

Six subjects with marginally elevated blood pressure in the range of 140/90 were assigned to take placebo for 10 days. After a one week washout period they then took vitamin C 2,000 mg. daily for 10 days. After one week of further washout the six were then given 650 mg. daily of garlic tablets for 10 days. After the last washout, garlic and vitamin C were then given another 10 days. The vitamin C apparently did not have any effect on blood pressure. The garlic did result in a lowering of systolic but not diastolic pressure. However when both vitamin C and garlic were given together mean systolic and diastolic pressures were reduced to 110-120 and 75-80. The blood pressure increased when the combined supplement was stopped. The authors of the study suggested that garlic and vitamin C increases production of nitric oxide by about 300% which positively affects the inner lining of blood vessel cell walls.

I also was able to control my emotions more, as I was more aware of them.  So I wouldnt get frustrated as easily, or be offended if someone was obviously taking a jab at me.

Most people don't add a small amount of vodka. 2-methyl-2-butanol smells sort of like mint and sort of like camphor. 1ml to 2ml equates to 1.5 shots of vodka. 2-methyl-2-butanol must only be placed in glass containers. Through it comes in certain special plastic containers. 2-methyl-2-butanol is a sedative hypnotic and it causes sleepiness, and also effects between ethanol and benzodiazepines, but sort of different and better. I find 2-methyl-2-butanol more enjoyable than ethanol. You can black out if you take too much(doses greater than 9ml). 2-methyl-2-butanol sometimes causes you to take a nap if you lay down and aren't doing anything. 2-methyl-2-butanol lasts longer than ethanol. 2-methyl-2-butanol can cause relaxation and sociability, and can interfere with coordination at higher doses.

I didn't read the whole article yet--just the synopsis and a bit of the intro--but a question that it immediately provokes is whether these same principles hold true if the test population is examined in late life, where age-related decline would be more pronounced than in midlife.  I think there has been more data on exercise being neuroprotective in aged populations than younger ones, though I'm admittedly a bit surprised this principle wasn't better reflected amid a midlife sampling.  I also wonder whether you could track intellectual improvements among those who had lower levels of fitness but attained higher levels during the course of the study.  We know at the very least that, even beyond the context of malnourishment due to nutrient insufficiency, diet certainly impacts intellect: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26083739 (consumption of trans fat linked to impaired memory performance in young adults, with a proposed causal mechanism).       Either way, it's good that people are being critical about some of our findings that generate sensationalist headlines.  I think this study was spurred by the fact that ""a longitudinal study has emerged showing a prospective association between physical fitness in young adulthood and later cognitive function in midlife.""

Also, what is neurotoxic about DMSO?

Nootropics,3cqwjw,Buzzardy,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:42:31 2015 UTC,"I take about a gram/day and haven't experienced problems at all with nose-bleeds.  Ginseng is seemingly mild.  There's no sudden rush, or anything like that.  What I've noticed is that smart people can only continue to be smart for short bursts of time.  In fact everyone works like this.  It's one reason why we have relatively short attention spans.  It's one reason why reading technical information loaded with terminology that we don't fully understand can make us loose focus.  The mind needs energy to handle cognitively loaded tasks.  Ginseng helps every cell in our body utilize glucose better.  I had a particularly bad time with that before taking it but now I almost feel like I have an unfair advantage.  It helps with EVERYTHING your body does because now you're able to draw from this deep well of energy.  The same goes for the cognitive aspect of it's effects.  Your brain (and the rest of your body for that matter) has two main power sources, oxygen and glucose.  Oxygen gets used up pretty quickly, then there's glucose.  There are other mechanisms, but those are the main ones.  Since Ginseng makes your cells -- particularly your brain cells -- more efficient at processing glucose, you can ""hang"" a lot longer under cognitive load.  When I say a lot longer, I really do mean a LOT longer.  Way longer than the average person.  So you can continue to be smart for extended periods of time while other people are diminished and depleted.  Even when you do get tired (which will ultimately happen), a quick 5 minute break is all it takes to be back to 100%.    Next you'll say ""what about caffeine?"". I love caffeine.  I don't consume very much of it anymore, but I LOVE caffeine.  It makes you FEEL like nothing can make you tired.  The reality is that you are tired even if you don't feel like it while under the influence of caffeine.  You're still using up that oxygen, you're still using up that glucose.  It's at LEAST a false sense of endurance and maybe even dangerous.  Another thing: You really need to ensure your dose of ginseng is spread out throughout the day.  Taking a gram all at once like I have will leave you feeling spacey and foggy believe it or not.  So there's two ways of handling that.  Either buy an extended release form (of which there is only one I'm aware of), or take your caplet, open it up, and add a little to your drink throughout the day.  Make a gram-ish last the whole day.  Also, what works for me is adding B12 and meditating.  I've also added thianine to great effect as well (and I might go back to that).  Combine all of this, and you'll find that you have a much cleaner more lively, longer lasting, higher quality focus and you can turn that focus on and off whenever you like.  I have another post on this as well with links backing up my assertions but I'm feeling lazy today so I may add it later.  Anyway, hopefully that helps somewhat."

Instead, I did my homework, and did some house chores that I had been procrastinating on for months. Like a well-adjusted person with normal self-control does when they have stuff to do.  Partly due to this, I went to a GP some time ago and flat out asked if I could have ADHD. The experience didn't go too well (they just said that my grades were too good and I couldn't have it if it wasn't identified as a kid), but after being evaluated by a psychologist instead, they said that my executive function and attention have some issues, although they didn't really say it had anything to do with any specific disorder. They just accepted me into a peer support group, because the evaluation was for some government-funded project to help youth with LDs to find jobs or study better. I somehow managed to get accepted in university, though, and can't even attend to that group because I'll need to move out, but I'm planning to ask them for a referral to a neurologist, or just explain the situation to my uni's healthcare services once I'm done with moving. All signs seem to point to the possibility that I just had minor brain problems all along, and managed to get by mostly due to being so preoccupied with compensating for them.  This does not mean that I'll give up exercising or calendars once I've got accommodations at school, or therapy or medication, of course. It just means that I might have a better chance at maintaining those habits then, as right now they are a huge struggle.  tl;dr I wouldn't be surprised if some others also turn to this stuff as a way of self-medicating a neurological problem they didn't even know they had, especially if they have a problem solving attitude, which can lead to a spiral of self-help, ""lifehacks"" and finally, brain boosters. But hey, at least it's more constructive than drinking your problems away."
Nootropics,3cniww,cryptograph,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:02:17 2015 UTC,"Thanks for sharing your story. I can see your point about many of those things, and as a matter of fact, I felt the same way for most of the time. However, I am positive that daily meditation is actually changing my brain in subtle ways which is allowing me to use my time more effectively and be more organized about the whole process.   It is still difficult to sit down for 30 minutes and study a tedious text, even though I might find it intrinsically interesting, because of the way it is presented. But meditation has taught me to stay with discomfort, and not to ""give up"" and go and look at reddit or browse for some immediate relief.   If I may ask, for how long did you practice mindfulness meditation, and what techniques did you use? There's a huge difference between actually meditating 30 minutes every day for a couple of months than there is from sparingly meditating 10 minutes 3 times a week. When I first started out, I had wished it worked faster too. I was getting more and more frustrated, but then I let go of the ""lust after results"" attitude and slowly got more and more into it.   As time progressed, my meditation deepened, and the awareness that came from it, increased not only my vigilance and my ability to organize, but also my ability to sustain effort toward some goal I'd set for myself.   I believe it is Russell Barkley (you can check him out on youtube) that say that people with executive system problems cannot sustain effort toward a goal; that is, they lack self-discipline and the necessary hedonic tone to carry out tasks for long-term benefits. I found the video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTuqqExgX3s  After my experience with meditation, I believe that meditation goes to the root of the issue. Self-discipline and sustaining effort, and thus affects everything else.   It's really mindboggling that something so simple can be so effective.   Just thought I'd let you know. And yes, I wholeheartidly agree, trying nootropics is far better than drinking yourself away."

I can attest to all the benefits reported in the literature -- increased focus, increased creativity, more compassion, and so on. Despite recognizing these benefits, it's often tough to make time for mindfulness. For the most part I've followed the instructions given by Sam Harris and Dan Harris (i.e. vipassana meditation). I like the simplicity of just focusing on the breath. Lately, however, I've being doing self-compassion meditation. There is evidence that this style of meditation is more effective than  mindfulness meditation:   Self-compassion is a better predictor than mindfulness of symptom severity and quality of life in mixed anxiety and depression."

There is evidence that this style of meditation is more effective than mindfulness meditation:   It certainly depends on your goal, but I am sure that for many people self-compassion meditation, which sounds a lot like metta-meditation (loving-kindness) can be extremely helpful in these times of increased negative self-view, and unrealistic standards of self."

Nootropics,3cniww,SpinCity07,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:33:21 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your response.  I started out from very short sessions (5min or less), which were about focusing on different parts of your body. It was a sample technique from the same radio show where I heard about mindfulness in the first place. I gradually increased the time to 10 minutes, and tried out different methods like focusing on breathing or visualizing numbers. The idea was to ease into it like I did with exercise (I used couch to 5k running plan for that). Changing the time and technique also helped bring a sense of advancing in a tangible way like with running. I still don't do it 30 minutes every day as 20 minutes already presents some problems (it can be hard to focus on a normal TV show episode that I enjoy, even). This is partly why I've sometimes turned to guided meditations or self hypnosis, because they are somewhat less difficult to focus on. Unfortunately, I don't know if they present similar benefits. Either way, I don't meditate nearly often enough at the moment, about once or twice a week. I've thought of luring myself into doing it more regularly by joining a meditation group, though. I've found studying with a friend easier, too, so it might help with that as well. It's a nice way of arranging a time and space for things, complete with positive peer pressure.  I obviously haven't gotten to the point where I can feel the effects as clearly as you do, but it helps me do calm down for a bit, which is good enough. There are some learning disabilities and mental illnesses running in my family, so it isn't that surprising if some of this is due to some inherited structural issue like dyslexia, and it's fine if meditation doesn't fix it, as long as it helps even a little bit. Picking a few habits like this and arranging my environment to be more supportive will all accumulate to help me function better overall. Demanding too much from one piece of this support structure would be foolish."

The idea was to ease into it like I did with exercise (I used couch to 5k running plan for that)   I generally suggest anapanasati (awareness of breath) in the beginning.

Changing the time and technique also helped bring a sense of advancing in a tangible way like with running. I still don't do it 30 minutes every day as 20 minutes already presents some problems (it can be hard to focus on a normal TV show episode that I enjoy, even).   Yeah, in my experience benefits don't really manifest before >20 minutes of practice - usually twice daily. I think it also depends on how difficult you find focusing to begin with. People that find focus easier may find it easier to stay for a longer time. For people that have ADHD or other disorders that hinder executive function, I suggest staying with the exercise for a longer duration of time because even during those 20 minutes, you'll spend a lot of time unfocused. If you go 30 minutes+ you'll have more ""tries"" to focus on your breath and you might reach points where you focused properly for 3-4 minutes compared with the 1 minute bursts before. Perhaps you know what I mean.    Unfortunately, I don't know if they present similar benefits. Either way, I don't meditate nearly often enough at the moment, about once or twice a week. I've thought of luring myself into doing it more regularly by joining a meditation group, though.    I usually think of self-hypnosis and guided meditations more as relaxation than meditation practice. Sure, relaxation is great if you're stressed out, but it probably won't have the same benefits as constantly trying to focus your attention on the breath over a specific duration of time.   A meditation group sounds great - it's extremely helpful to have someone (preferably more skilled) to lead the way, and also to inspire.

Something similar is actually one of the advantages of self hypnosis, as in most of the videos or mp3s, the induction/visualization part has a great deal of repetition, so even if you lose focus for a moment, it seldom breaks the flow.   But yeah, I agree that there's something about following someone's word that's more passive than self-directed effort towards something. While this form of externalization is crucial in my everyday life (like the arranging to meet a study buddy every now and then), flexing the muscle of intrinsic motivation will probably have more of the desired effects in the long run. And since meditation is largerly an internal thing, ""failing"" doesn't really present any real life losses. There's only progress to be made.  I'll look into the meditation group once I'm done moving out. The city's pretty far away, and doesn't have a huge online presence, but I found at least one Buddhist group that arranges several meditation meetings every week there, and is open to people of all religions. Seems promising.  Finally, thank you for your encouraging words, and for sharing your experience with the benefits of meditation.

Nootropics,3cniww,xStagief,4,Fri Jul 10 17:56:45 2015 UTC,"For me, its been one of self-acceptance. Why must I be better? Why do I need to be superhuman? A lot of it was coming from avoiding pain. Avoiding rejection mostly because to be rejected was something terrbly painful and would cause me to be alone. No pill could fix this. It could fuck me up for a few hours till I came down. A pill has no wisdom to give you. No different way of thinking about an issue. A pill is for a machine who wants to feel nothing because they are hurting and don't know how to deal with the pain. Meditation has shown me a new perspective of how to deal with the bad things and painful emotions in my life. To allow rather than put up walls that eventually come down and are very energy and time consuming. A pill would have never have done that. When it comes down to it, we are just emotional beings looking to have an emotional experience. There is nothing greater in life. However, with that comes intense emotions that can throw us into a shitty life situation. Meditation will release the struggle with that so you can still enjoy life and be with the negitive feeling we all feel from time to time."

I haven't begun meditating yet, but it's something that's been on my mind since I had a deeply spiritual experience after a mushrooms trip a month ago. I was able to deeply focus within and silence the ""ego"" as you call it. I highly recommend a solo-trip involving a healthy lifestyle a week prior and then fasting immediately before.   Anyway, thank you again and for the book recommendation."
Nootropics,3cniww,TravisH997,8,Thu Jul 9 17:08:45 2015 UTC,"The funny thing about psychedelics, having tried them many times, is that they are merely a peak through the veil. They show you what it's like on the ""other side"" so to speak; other side here referring to the side where the ego is silenced, as you aptly put it.   However, their use, while it can bring insights into awareness and show you what the meditative state is like, without cultivating that awareness, you will go back to old habits in no time.   This is why I personally find meditation far more valuable than any amount of psychedelics. I view them like tools and not ends in themselves. As Alan Watts so rightly says, ""When you get the message, hang up the phone."", because indeed, the ""message"" needs to be cultivated in order for it to be understood, processed and ultimately made part of one's every day life."
Nootropics,3cniww,Keninishna,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:26:47 2015 UTC,"I agree with what you said about psychedelics being a tool rather than the path and ""peeking through the veil"". However, I'm not sure I 100% agree with the Alan Watts quote. By no means are psychedelics the answer or the sustainable path to clarity, but they are such a powerful tool with so much insight to offer I couldn't see myself stoping after one particular trip. I've taken mushrooms almost  a dozen times and each experience has been distinctly unique; with friends it can be purely a fun time but alone it can allow one to gain new perspectives different or more complex than the last."
Nootropics,3cniww,TravisH997,4,Thu Jul 9 17:41:38 2015 UTC,"I don't disagree that they provide valuable experiences. I disagree that people should rely on them for genuine insight. True insight can come from meditation, and it stays with you because you worked for it. While insight can certainly be reaped from using psychedelics, it is often a fleeting one. I've used psychedelics a lot, so it is not like I am talking out of my hat here.  Of course your milleage may vary, and you may find that psychedelics are making you far better at being aware throughout the day and all the mental benefits that come from that; but in my experience, that's the afterglow honey-moon phase and IME it always ends."

Nootropics,3cniww,Keninishna,6,Thu Jul 9 17:50:33 2015 UTC,"Beginning any habit is difficult. Making it into a ritual could help ease into it.   For instance, at a select time a day where you know you won't be disturbed, go take a warm bath or drink a cup of green tea or something else you find relaxing, and then sit down in any position, as long as it involves a straight spine. Use a timer, either on your phone or a clock, and set it for 10 minutes. During those 10 minutes, simply watch your thoughts. Do not engage with them, just watch them. Like clouds in the sky flying by your sight.   Keep doing this for one week. Then proceed to changing the focus to your breath, and do another week of 10 minutes daily. After 2 weeks, you'll have established a very good habit already, and it will be easier. Now, increase the time to 15 minutes, and do this for a week or even two.   You'll know by then if you can increase the time because it will appear natural to you whether you ought to increase the time, or stay with the current time for a bit longer until you feel like you might want to try a longer time control.   As your meditation deepens, you'll notice that time speeds up, and 15 minutes of meditation feels like only 5. As your meditation deepens, the more pleasurable the state becomes, and you will start to look forward to your practice.   The more you practice, however bad quality the practice is (e.g. ""my focus is terrible!"") it is still good practice. In meditation you get points for being bad; because we are accepting of ourselves and we know that progress will come eventually anyway, as long as we keep practicing.   I hope that helps."

Nootropics,3cniww,Ktaostrophe,2,Fri Jul 10 06:46:56 2015 UTC,"Its a bit hard to explain but I'll give it a shot, basically schizophrenics have a fragmented thought processes so they have to always be aware of what they are thinking and then use tricks to get their mind to stay congruent with reality. With meditation well the way I learned it from the book of power of now is that you aren't identified with your mind so you can observe your own thought patterns and make changes that way in the present moment. It ends up that thinking about your own thoughts can just lead to some fragmented thought patterns and well you end up with competing ones at some point. I ended up being drastically different one second and normal the next, which just is really scary. The schizophrenics have to use this technique to deal with their own thought process but they also take anti-psychotics to help flatten out their mind so when they change its more seemless. This also makes them extremely perceptive to other people because they have to deal with major contrasts mentally all the time. So the schizos were pereceptive enough of my meta-cognitive feelings and would make up some story to express those feelings and then compare them with mine to guide me back to what is realistic. If you think about this stuff enough you end up kind of paranoid as a result because you can become a sociopath really quick. I dunno if that made sense but just my 2 cents."

However, people have been trying to broaden the meaning, and are apparently succeeding. Seems like every time I look at Wikipedia, the nootropic entry has become more and more vague. This subreddit as well has changed so soo much over the years.   I really don't like nootropics being associated with disorders. It's going to cause them to run into legal problems. Nootropics by definition aren't supposed to include anything with significant side effects. Changing that is another reason nootropics is going to lose its reputation.

After around three years of experimenting I can tell you its completely possible to keep to motivating effects of amfetamines while also having a clear head, its about getting the dosage right, and not just taking Memantine and think its going to solve all you're problems.  There are many pathways that lead to amfetamine tolerance such as, the NMDAr, nAChR a7, NOS production, Ca2+ pathways, A2Adregnic receptor, pain and inflammation pathways etc etc and I'm sure there more I haven't come across yet.  Meditations amazing, and so is that Sam Harris book, but theres no fucking way I could have treated all my problems sustainably and held a job with just that.  The fact you lasted 2 weeks on just Adderall without feeling like complete and utter shit shows that you're brain was in a pretty healthy state, it just sound like you didn't dose the Memantine correctly and you went a bit manic.  I have complete control over my amfetamine tolerance, 3 years in and I still get a huge motivation boosts from just 2.5mg dexamfetamine.  Yes nootropics are tools, and its going to take a lot of time and experience to be able to use them efficiently, but with enough effort they most definitely can grant you the ability to cure yourself.

Yes nootropics are tools, and its going to take a lot of time and experience to be able to use them efficiently, but with enough effort they most definitely can grant you the ability to cure yourself.

And if you're talking about hyperactive ADHD then the last thing you want is more motivation, you'll already have tons of that what you need is control over that motivation  What worked for me was identifying which pathways where causing my issues, and then preventing them being as active which gave my brain a chance to develop in the right direction.  Disidentification, through negation? so you want me to just ignore my issues and hope its cure its self? in all seriousness you're going to have to expand cause I really don't understand how this will help  I am free to do whatever I like within reason, I only ever take tiny amounts of any medication, I don't believe in fully medicating myself with high doses of medication, I just add small amounts of stimulation or antagonizing in the right places which helps my brain develop in the right direction.  I am able to be on or off medication and still be happy and enjoy life, the only thing I haven't managed to fix is my ADD, but I believe thats just my personilty, one that doesn't fit in very with society, it only an issue because I have to slave my ass off 9 - 5 everyday doing something I'm not interested in, and I don't have a choice about it, what am I supposed to do, run away and live in the woods? no I have to fit in, be a working member of society that doesn't understand how I learn.

As someone who has also benefited immensely from meditation, I would say it is not at all about ""ignoring your problems"". Most people, especially those on the more anxious side, are not aware of how often we worry about things that are irrelevant or outside of our control. Even if the issue IS relevant, often times people simply turn the same thought over and over in their head without realizing it.

Yes, amphetamines stimulate the executive centers of the brain, namely the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex while simultaneously raising hedonic tone through dopaminergic innervations in the mesolimbic tract. There is no question about this. There has been hundreds of studies showing this.    Disidentification, through negation? so you want me to just ignore my issues and hope its cure its self? in all seriousness you're going to have to expand cause I really don't understand how this will help   I do not think you understand what I am saying here. I am not saying ignore, I am saying that you hold the key to ""fix"" those things by yourself. We can argue about this all day long if you want to, but neither one of us will get much wiser. What works for one person need not necessarily work for another.    I am able to be on or off medication and still be happy and enjoy life, the only thing I haven't managed to fix is my ADD, but I believe thats just my personilty, one that doesn't fit in very with society, it only an issue because I have to slave my ass off 9 - 5 everyday doing something I'm not interested in, and I don't have a choice about it, what am I supposed to do, run away and live in the woods? no I have to fit in, be a working member of society that doesn't understand how I learn.   You say it's part of your personality. You say that this personality is not compatible with modern life. Well, sure, if you find the need to conform to the standards of modern life, and you cannot do so in a natural way without use of medication, then by all means. All I am saying is that it is not the only way. I know of several people that used several methods of meditation and various techniques to completely change their way of thinking that made them more effective, not less, at what they do. But they were willing to let go of past beliefs and actually try, for long durations of time with utmost discipline, the techniques that were prescribed. I digress: to each their own.    And I'm not so ignorant to think everyone can be cured this way, I believe my Anxiety and Depression where cultivated by being put through the piece of shit education system without a diagnosis for ADHD-PI, which is why I was able to correct it. I don't believe ADHP-PI can be fixed with meditation, I'm not broken, just misunderstood. It is completely possible to efficiently, sustainably but temporarily put a patch over it   That is your belief. I have mine. People can believe the narrative that they prefer, and they usually do.   I wish you all the best and continued success."

You speak about changes in the brain from meditation. Just like there are changes from drugs, there are changes from meditation, too. I refer you to: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1361002/  Also, note that the group of people investigated here ""[...] were not monks, but rather typical Western meditation practitioners who incorporate their practice into a daily routine involving career, family, friends and outside interests. Two participants were full-time meditation teachers, three were part-time yoga or meditation teachers and the rest meditated an average of once a day for 40 min, while pursuing traditional careers in fields such as healthcare and law"".     Magnetic resonance imaging was used to assess cortical thickness in 20 participants with extensive Insight meditation experience, which involves focused attention to internal experiences. Brain regions associated with attention, interoception and sensory processing were thicker in meditation participants than matched controls, including the prefrontal cortex and right anterior insula. Between-group differences in prefrontal cortical thickness were most pronounced in older participants, suggesting that meditation might offset age-related cortical thinning. Finally, the thickness of two regions correlated with meditation experience. These data provide the first structural evidence for experience-dependent cortical plasticity associated with meditation practice.    Also check out: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21034792    Areas associated with the default mode network (DMN) are substantially similar to those associated with meditation practice. However, no studies on DMN connectivity during resting states have been conducted on meditation practitioners. It was hypothesized that meditators would show heightened functional connectivity in areas of cortical midline activity. Thirty-five meditation practitioners and 33 healthy controls without meditation experience were included in this study. All subjects received 4.68-min resting state functional scanning runs. The posterior cingulate cortex and medial prefrontal cortex were chosen as seed regions for the DMN map. Meditation practitioners demonstrated greater functional connectivity within the DMN in the medial prefrontal cortex area (xyz=339-21) than did controls. These results suggest that the long-term practice of meditation may be associated with functional changes in regions related to internalized attention even when meditation is not being practiced.    And perhaps more important for the discussion regarding ADHD, taken from the following link: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4403871/    Studies of mindfulness in non-ADHD samples support its application to ADHD, particularly based on the purported impact of mindfulness training on attention regulation, executive functioning, and emotion regulation. At the intervention level, mindfulness meditation practices involve focusing attention on a particular object (e.g., one’s own breath) and returning to this object after becoming distracted. This is proposed to improve attentional control abilities (Keng, Smoski, & Robins, 2011). That is, this practice requires top-down regulation of attention and conflict detection, which can be thought of as a regulatory approach to attention that improves executive processes (Chiesa, Calati, & Serretti, 2011). Since poor attentional functioning is a core symptom cluster of ADHD (American Psychiatric Association, 2013) and executive functioning deficits in ADHD are common (Barkley, 1997; Boonstra, Oosterlaan, Sergeant, & Buitelaar, 2005; Hervey, Epstein, & Curry, 2004), any treatments that purportedly strengthen these processes seem appropriate for ADHD. While many studies have measured the impact of mindfulness training in experienced meditators (e.g., Brewer, Worhunsky, et al., 2011; Taylor et al., 2013), even brief training with meditation novices yields improvements in attention. For example, one study assessed the impact of five days (20 minutes per day) of meditation against relaxation (Tang et al., 2007). Post-treatment effects indicated that the meditation group performed significantly better on conflict detection during an attentional task than the relaxation group. Similar findings have been reported following four days of meditation training (20 minutes per day) on visuo-spatial processing, working memory, and executive functioning against an active treatment comparison group (Zeidan, Johnson, Diamond, David, & Goolkasian, 2010).  Neuroimaging studies suggest that mindfulness meditation engenders neuroplastic changes in brain areas associated with attentional functioning typically impaired in ADHD. For instance, Hölzel and colleagues (2011) discuss the role of the anterior cingulate cortex, which is involved with executive/attentional processes via detection of conflicting incompatible incoming information. Given that this region is also involved with attentional processing in ADHD (e.g., Cubillo, Halari, Smith, Taylor, & Rubia, 2012; Passarotti, Sweeney, & Pavuluri, 2010), it represents a potential target for mindfulness training in ADHD samples.  Studies in adult ADHD samples also provide promising preliminary support for mindfulness meditation training. In one within-subjects study, an eight-week group mindfulness program modified for ADHD patients, called the Mindful Awareness Practices (MAPs) for ADHD Program, was administered to a sample of adults (n = 24) and adolescents with ADHD (n = 8) (Zylowska et al., 2008). Pre- and post-treatment assessments revealed improvement in self-reported inattentive, hyperactive-impulsive, depressive, and anxious symptoms. In addition, among 12 different laboratory-based cognitive task variables, significant improvements emerged on two indices of conflict detection and two indices of set-shifting. Retention rates were high with the majority (78%) of participants completing the treatment. Participants reported significant practice outside of weekly sessions and overall high satisfaction with the treatment. Improvements in ADHD, anxiety, and depressive symptoms were sustained at the three-month follow up (Zylowska, Smalley, & Schwartz, 2009).  Overall, promising preliminary results have emerged across studies assessing mindfulness in adult ADHD samples. Particularly promising are approaches that aim to enhance ecological validity of outcome measures by incorporating ecological momentary assessment, and inclusion of electrophysiological measures to assess potential biomarkers. Limitations include small sample sizes, a lack of active treatment comparison groups, a lack of control for the effects of pharmacotherapy for ADHD, and long-term follow-up beyond three months for either most or all of the studies reviewed. In addition, some studies included additional treatment modalities not specific to mindfulness training interventions. Future studies are required to address limitations of these studies (summarized below in the Future Directions section). In sum, existing studies support the acceptability and feasibility, and preliminary effectiveness use of this approach in the treatment of ADHD in adulthood. We now provide a description of a mindfulness-based treatment for ADHD in adulthood.    I suggest you read the whole paper, because it is fascinating. To answer your possibly upcoming exclamation that some of the results were not significant; that's true, but you ought to remember that this sort of research is in its infancy.   Can you imagine the difference between being a patient that is dragged by your parents into a meditation room and asked to focus on an object every day for 30 minutes differs from a person that wishes to truly understand meditation and chooses to apply himself for two months with a daily regimen that fosters awareness, or a patient that actively seeks out an actual teacher who makes sure that the exercise chosen for the individual will reap the most benefits, based on the patient's individual temperament?  Add a good diet, exercise, stretching and resistance training, and you might find that ADHD is no longer a problem for you.    ""woh I'm a little quirky and energetic yeh its my ADHD guys"" can't fucking stand these people, you've never even experienced the lows, fuck off.   As someone who has tried to treat their ADHD for the past 8 years along with suicidal ideation at my lowest points... I abhor such a statement if you are indeed implying that I am one of those types."

So you start fearing and avoiding hard challenges while proving one's worth by overcoming the easy ones. And after that, believing in yourself is quite a difficult task without the help of various substances. However, intelligence isn't a fixed trait either. Sure there're studies of limits of improvement and diversity in terms of starting points(IQ etc.), but if you look e.g. to the blogs of professional grade mathematicians, then you'll find out their formula of success is ""99% effort + 1% talent"" and I think someone who voluntarily researches nootropics effects and basics of neurobiology isn't dumb enough to doubt about his 1%-thingy."

It wants you to quit. Knowing this, look for something in yourself that expresses a deeper wish for transcending yourself, so to speak.

However, I do not recommend guided meditations once you've developed the habit of meditation. Then one should practice with closed eyes and focusing on some object, or using one of the other forms of meditation that are well-known such as loving-kindness (metta-meditation) or vipassana meditation (insight-meditation) or anāpānasati (awareness of breath). There are many techniques, but stay with one for at least a couple of months and observe the changes.   Another good tip for beginners would simply be to observe their mind as an outsider. Do not focus on any object, simply sit or lie down and be aware of everything that passes through your mind. Observe, do not engage. After enough time done with this, one will notice that the amount of thoughts will start to calm down, and so will the breath. When reaching this point, more specific techniques can be employed."

You'll notice that when you keep meditating and you become proficient at it, your need for sleep decreases and your general wakefulness level increases.   In other words, like exercise, you gain time, you do not lose it from meditation practice.   Remember that 20 minutes (even less would suffice actually, but 20 min is a good time) twice daily (morning and night) for several years is way better than no meditation, and you will still see benefits. There is a time and place for everything, and meditation can be incorporated in every activity in your life. It's a state of being. Being completely in the moment.   The ""flow"" state that so many people talk about is actually just a lesser state of jhana (a very blissful meditative state characterized by one-pointedness), so it is certainly achieveable through mindfulness in daily activities.

However, that state is actually worse for your brain than alcohol itself (in fact majority of serious brain damage related to alcohol usage is caused by withdrawals and hangovers afaik) due to excitotoxicity, so it really should be avoided. Better to get some less neurotoxic stimulants if you need a boost like that.

The highest I've taken was 1.2gs and when that happened I started feeling dizzy and my vision became blurry (other symptoms of intoxication as well).  I think tossing in Adrafinil could cause an anxiety attack, especially if you usually drink caffeine with adderall.   The phenibut reduces the negative effects of adderall and usually will allow me to sleep eventually.

For me, at that dose(enough to make me tipsy), it lasts around 1.5-2 days at a good strength.   Adderall and phenibut should be good. I do phenibut + coffee and it is the best shit ever. I know phenibut improves dopamine concentrations a bit so maybe start a bit lower on the adderall? I'm not sure.   Phenibut + stimulant literally turns you into a zen god. Both GABA and dopamine turn down emotions and stress, while upping focus, executive function etc.  I haven't tried adderall + phenibut but I imagine it would be good.    It just isn't sustainable.

Nootropics,3cniq3,gzimmer,3,Thu Jul 9 12:08:19 2015 UTC,"Im right there with you up until the part about less bathroom breaks... I ended up going to the bathroom quite a bit more overall due to all the water I had to drink to stay properly hydrated while on the ephedrine. Really easy to become dehydrated while using ephedrine multiple times/doses a day.   Well worth the extra trips though, quite the amazing little drug when mixed with caffeine."

Though, if I take too much it can make me feel like what I can only imagine ADHD feels like. That is, unable to focus on any one thing for more than a few minutes and my thoughts are all over the place."
Nootropics,3cniq3,Siflyn,2,Thu Jul 9 13:54:34 2015 UTC,ephedrine>pseudoephedrine. You can buy ephedrine as asthma aid over the counter in most pharmacies. The amount you can buy is controlled to mitigate its use in methamphetamine production. 25mg is a normal dose but can be a bit edgey for a first dose so try 12mg first. EC stack is great for fatloss and motivation.

Nootropics,3cldzd,NotHyplon,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:12:45 2015 UTC,"Currently The Medicines Act would make modifinal importation from the EU into the uk without prescription illegal. However it does not include any wording other then UK\EU and so it is not illegal to import from outside of the EU. You could for example get in trouble if you imported 1000 of them to sell on.  Now the new law bans the importation of ANY psychoactive substance that is not medicine,alcohol, caffine or tobacco. In this context and based on the way UK law works with case law and what not it could basically be interupretted as:  Medicines = things that come under the medicines act. A legitimate prescription for modifinal coming in from the EU is fine, non legitimate is not. Because medicines from the rest of the world are not covered they are then caught by the new act as importation of a psychoactive substance."

So authors, journalists and others started piss taking and questioning the parameters of the law. That clause was silently dropped.

Opioids are excitatory and inhibitory in different areas of the brain.    EDIT: DId you have a siezure or not? Confused. You probably got a partial seizure in the hippocampus because of the phenibut + opioid excitatory potentiation in that location. Opioids are normally excitatory in the hippocampus.  And now when you go off of phenibut, the areas which normally are inhibited by opioids are getting rebound excitation. This could cause tinnitus. GABAB has a dual effect of potentiating opioids (through subjective experience of myself and others), and also of acting as an inhibitory neurotransmitter. So some areas of the brain are getting dual inhibition through phenibut.  You could possibly try low dose naltrexone to upregulate opioids, and you can just stay away from phenibut until a few years have past and you have quit opioids.  EDIT: This is just a theory, please don't  take it as fact. I am seeing other reports of baclofen actually reducing the effect of opioids. Your post actually didn't make too much sense so I just stringed together a possible explanation for what I thought you meant.  EDIT2: This is a long shot but GABAB is the main excitatory neurotransmitter in the pancreas, and causes insulin production. Tinnitus is associated with blood sugar dysfunction. Perhaps you can check out if you have diabetes when not on phenibut? It is possible that you are getting pancreas gaba withdrawals."

So it would stand to reason that having a high alcohol tolerance means having a downregulation of those receptors, of which, some of those are targeted by phenibut.  In saying that, even I don't feel much from 750mg. It's just a very subtle sense of relaxation, akin to having a beer or two. If you plan to experiment with phenibut doses, just be wary about it since it can take up to 4 hours to take effect and can sneak up on you."

The afterglow is amazing.  Just persevere for a little bit, I was taking 2g+ in the beginning and barely noticing effects, now it gets me errytime. I fkn love it, the only downsides are that it can actually be counter-productive for work as I find myself just chatting to people for ages or having 6 windows open in FB chat lol.  Anyone else have similar exp. with Pheni not working initially?"

It also makes my prostate sore as fuck. Feels so dirty.   Good luck. Empty stomach, 1500mg, wait 5 hours. the withdrawals are hell though. For some reason, tramadol will completely eliminate the entire withdrawals for the whole day. Found that out on accident.  I doubt it has a reverse tolerence, but who knows.

Nootropics,3clyco,34215527015,1 point,Thu Jul 9 03:50:04 2015 UTC,Since it works on GABA-B receptors it will only work on certain types of anxiety.  It could be that your anxiety responds better to a typical benzodiazepine or maybe another drug.  I would definitely use it more than once to test its efficacy if the first time you were underwhelmed.  But stop taking it if it's not doing anything.
Nootropics,3clyco,noginator,2,Thu Jul 9 08:16:40 2015 UTC,"My anxiety responds very well to drugs that work on GABA-A. GABA-B drugs also work well for my anxiety, but I require a lot higher dosage, and by that time they usually make me too nauseous/tired.  I initially bought Phenibut to help with my anxiety, but now I only take it to help me sleep."
Nootropics,3clyco,lastPharaoh37,1 point,Fri Jul 10 04:23:55 2015 UTC,"Diazepam (GABA-A) works wonders for my anxiety but I found that I require really high doses of GABA-B drugs (my go to is phenibut) to feel any positive effect, but when they do finally kick in it's near euphoric. Unfortunately I also experience the negative side effects associated with the higher doses.  I've experimented with phenibut doses over the past couple months, with at least a week in between dosing, and I require at least 3grams of it, sometimes more (~4 grams) if my anxiety is especially bad.  I think I am going to try the 'official' prescription guidelines to see if it works.  https://drugs-forum.com/forum/showthread.php?t=221041  I've read anecdotal stories of people using it daily for up to 6 weeks without major downsides."

I am usually a strong responder to substances though which is why its baffling to me. people talk about tolerance to weed but I never experienced this even when I smoked every freakin day. I don't anymore bcuz it just had such an effect on me - I became so clumsy tripping over my own words and all kinds of shit. so that is why I have come to expect that substances that affect others strongly will have similar affect on me.

It did seem to relieve much of my social anxiety, but during the peak (~5 hrs in) I could barely comprehend what i was trying to read, it was very difficult, even though I didn't feel very weird compared to being really drunk."

I don't have much anxiety...except when I smoke weed of course, so that may be why. I should conduct an experiment and smoke until I am anxious and take some phenibut in attempt to melt away that anxiety.

Nootropics,3cm8m4,bytivore,5,Thu Jul 9 00:24:14 2015 UTC,"The actual paper doesn't suggest anything about what should be recommended. It notes a trend toward decreasing effectiveness in CBT for depression, which doesn't imply it's ineffective. The authors list off many possible explanations for the data, and then the possible implications.   The guardian article is just a guy talking about possible explanations that he finds interesting.  Here's the summary of the implications from the paper itself:    The practical significance of this study is to heighten the awareness among practitioners and clinical researchers of the trends in modern psychotherapy. If the psychotherapy of today has a lower efficacy than that conducted 30 to 40 years ago, this threatens the validity of current comparative studies. If we compare the efficacy of a new psychotherapeutic approach with the current best standard, which, for example, may be CBT, we risk concluding that the newer approach is preferable even though it may have a weaker effect than the seminal CBT trials of the 1970s. Researchers conducting randomized placebo-controlled trials today, thus, risk keeping newer treatment approaches that are relatively better than the current best CBT. Yet, what is the benefit of doing so if the absolute change is minor or even negative compared to the seminal studies? The fact that individual cognitive therapy demonstrates a de clining temporal trend implies, however, that the possibility of significant improvement exists. Treatment outcomes may be improved, not only through technical variations or new additions, but also by considering better ways of integrating common, therapist, and patient-related factors. Further research and randomized trials that include measures of the four major variance components underpinning the therapy’s effects are recommended to determine the formula behind the optimal practice of CBT. All future clinical trials should be conducted according to a common standard that prescribes which information should be collected, at a minimum, in all psychotherapy studies."

Nootropics,3cm8m4,DeltruS,3,Thu Jul 9 00:57:00 2015 UTC,"Take it from someone who used CBT to cure social anxiety:  CBT has a certain brute force aspect to it that can't ever ""not work"", especially for anxiety. Once you identify your irrational thoughts and do exposure, you can't not reduce your anxiety. The brain only works a certain way. But I would recommend group CBT, as I've tried both solo and group therapy, and group was far more effective.  But it's not surprising that CBT is less effective for depression. Although the ""C"" (cognitive) -- changing your thoughts -- might be of some help, there is no ""B"" -- behavior -- that can help with depression. There's no ""face your fears"" for depression. So if you do CBT for depression, you're really only getting half of it.   But the good news is, depression is sometimes caused by behaviors that are being shaped by one or another anxiety disorder. If you use CBT to cure the anxiety, you can eventually fix the depression from the changes you make to your life afterwards. In my situation, I cured my social anxiety and now have more friends, therefore don't ever feel nearly as depressed."

The recommendation is to look at it in the context of psychology rather than psychiatry, as neither field is wrong by itself, and neither is completely ""right"" without the other to complement it regards to the efficacy of its treatments or the underlying philosophy of its approach for working with our minds. Goes back to the ol' Nature vs nurture argument - in reality it only makes sense to look at ourselves as conditioned by both.   Its like if you were morbidly obese and asked for a pill you could take to make you skinny, and someone instead recommended that you exercise and improve your diet. Its not that no pill exists that would aid in fat burning and help you lose fat, its that it might be healthier and more effective to attack the problem from a different angle.  Don't mistake the progression of psychotherapy, (with specific approaches and methods falling out of favor and evolving over time just as technology or medicine does), as evidence that ALL therapy is useless.  tl;dr: In other words, CBT falling out of favor amongst psychologists does not mean getting a prescription for 20mg of daily Adderall is the right way to deal with your procrastination problem."

Nootropics,3cm8m4,Coma-,1 point,Sat Jul 11 11:52:20 2015 UTC,"Apologies for assuming you were an American, but the problem is prevalent in pretty much all first world countries nowadays to varying degrees.  The HBO comment was a joke.  The over diagnosis problem stems from our culture, not the FDA itself.... after all, the FDA has to be a byproduct of our culture inherently. The problem, as I mentioned above, stems from our fallacy of pathologizing what is essentially perfectly normal, even healthy, and above all undeniably common human behavior. We forget that we didnt evolve to sit in a chair for 8 hours a day staring at a screen with unwavering focus, or that we really don't like spending hours on end concentrating our entire conscious perception on a single, and usually incredibly mundane and unexciting task or job. Furthermore, lacking the ability/willpower to ""force ones self"" to endure this sort of masochistic torture, does not mean there's something wrong with your brain. That would be like living in a culture where running was considered extremely important, and we started saying that people that didn't have the willpower to force themselves to get up and run 5 miles every day suffered from some sort of brain disease. Sure, adderall/ritalin HELPS us accomplish these feats, but that does not mean its unhealthy if we fail to do it constantly. On the contrary, obsessing about being able to run 5 miles / do hours of tedious work every is probably more indicative off a mental disease than simply not wanting to is. We're defining disease now as things that don't perfectly align with basically, the principle that productivity and making money are the sort of defining standards by which we judge healthy, and that anything that gets in the way of that, is a disease. We're pathologizing our inherent ""animal nature"" essentially.  I don't think its  immoral to sacrifice this part of yourself for the pursuit of making money and being successful, I would be a hypocrite if i did. I DO think its important to recognize that in truth, this IS what we are doing however, and we shouldn't pretend and try to rationalize that it is something that its not.  There are some well respected theories in evolutionary psychology in fact, that speculate the behavior we call ""ADD"" might actually be an evolutionary adaption itself, actually INCREASING our odds for survival as hunter gatherers. The modern day classroom is afterall, only thousands of years old, and Evolution works on MUCH larger timescales. The ""ADD"" phenotype and cognitive style/novel seeking, etc. can be clearly beneficial in a world where you would be walking around outside all day looking for something to eat so you wouldn't starve to death and constantly worrying that some animal wasn't about to attack you and eat you. Physiologicaly speaking, our bodies and brains are as they are as a result of millions of years of specilized evolution to an environment that was EXTREMELY different than how it is today.   TLDR: There is no evolutionary ""need"" to be able to sit in a chair and focus on something for hours straight, and not being able to do it does not mean you suffer from an actual disease.  I'm also not trying to defend CBT here, I'm addressing the dimishishment that psychological approaches to ""fulfilling our full cognitive potential"" takes on this sub, which you some perfectly illustrated by likening it to ""hippie extremism.""  I don't really care if you agree with the above or not, clear idiocy shouldn't be validated with argument."

The FDA is a byproduct of American culture; the same one that thinks overweight isnt a problem, so regarding medicine it is way different than European culture.   On the contrary, obsessing about being able to run 5 miles / do hours of tedious work every is probably more indicative off a mental disease than simply not wanting to is.   I disagree. Mental illnesses or symptoms are usually all 'adaptations', well not really adaptations, more changes from the norm in such a way that we can easily classify them. Obsessions are also a part of ADHD ( note from someone afflicted: ADHD is a hundred times more than the lack of focus, OCDish daydreams etc all included ).  Evolutionary Psychology is hardly science, they lack mathematical modelling and empiricism. Eating other humans without anyone in the group noticing could also increase our survivability, it is just guessing/talking whilst trying to appeal to 'common sense' logics. Short-term adaptions can be dramatic and very fast even in multi-cellulaf organism if thd selection-factors call for it.  TLDR: ADHD has only very little to do with sitting in a chair straight for hours or focusing for hours. EvoPsych is as good as a science as Psychology -> Lots of Bogus. But Psychology can rely on some empiricism at least.  I said hippie-extremism as a joke, although I must admit that the way you described ADHD sounds kinda like a hippie would do. Meditation is totally fine in my books, even ghough exercise is 100x times better. But CBT is just trash, maybe not for social-anxiety, but for real ADHD ( what you described is what we call hyperkinetic disorder over here which is like 5% of ADHD )."

Taking high amounts of 5-htp can reduce your body's natural production of serotonin in the least causing dependance. 5-htp can have interactions with maoi's and ssri's increasing this risk.  there's no real treatment except to reduce consumption of the drug causing it
Nootropics,3cl940,mackraslo,1 point,Thu Jul 9 10:27:25 2015 UTC,"I really doubt anhedonia is caused by SRRIs, anhedonia is caused by prolonged periods of stress, cortisol is useful in immediate situations e.g. if you're about to get hit by a car and you need to get the fuck out the way, but not when you've got a deadline in 3 weeks and you can't stop worrying about it, so now you're entering a prolonged period of stress > you're brain can't keep up with all this unneeded stimulation > receptors get burn't out (I suspect mainly dopamine receptors but as always I'm sure it varies, everythings interconnected etc) and are much less responsive to average levels of neurotransmitters, which is why you feel anhedonic. (it will probably take a lot longer than 3 weeks of high stress levels to burn you out, going through education with undianosed ADD is what cultivated my anhedonic depression, was probably seriously stressed from around age 13 - 18, fucking cunt teachers thinking the only way of motivating pupils is by stressing them out, but I managed to get out of it /w supplements, medications and spirituality.  SRRIs put the break on, reduce stress and help your brain get back to the non-anhedonic state, but at the same time they could just make you lethargic since if you're used to running primarily off cortisol reducing it will leave you doing seemingly doing nothing, but I can assure you an SSRIs are not the cause of anhedonia  SRRIs stimulate certain serotonin receptors like the 5HT2A, which then have downstream effects in D2 receptors, actually combating anhedonia  Perhaps SRRIs aren't working for you; Other options are Memantine, Semax, NSI-189 perhaps even a magic mushroom session once a month, pretty much you need to balance out glutamate/cortisol and let you're brain repair  Probably could have fixed myself a lot faster if I started doing regular exercise, but everythings a mammoth task when you're depressed"

It'll be bad to have one on your arm or leg of course but injecting into your mouth is an entirely different issue.   your mouth is the only orifice meant to eat from.Each time you eat you also provide food for bacteria inside your mouth.  Getting a injection site infection in the mouth can make it painful to eat or speak and in the least would require antibiotics.  my second point.. You don't need to inject into your mouth where it's difficult to see the injection site without a mirror.  you've got veins. they carry blood all over your body. if you inject intravenously the drug will almost immediately carry to your brain pending the interaction with the blood brain barrier.

Nootropics,3cluea,beastlymelon,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:08:36 2015 UTC,it's just unnecessary. I can't see myself trying this and i wince at the idea of someone doing it. there's little risk of getting a collapsed vein but I think you're safer learning about im or iv injection.  The tiniest needles that you can possibly buy are insulin needles. there's nothing that you can find thinner or smaller than a insulin needle.  I have a cold sore in my mouth rn and the biggest reason I'd have against injection in the mouth is infections.   you'll always have that risk whether or not you're injecting in the mouth but getting one in the mouth can be more painful and unpleasant and you can't quite get your mouth as sterile as your arm  injecting into your tongue can also cause nerve damage at the worst and if you have experience with post injection pain it's definitely going to hurt inside your tongue.
Nootropics,3cluea,nakedproof,1 point,Thu Jul 9 00:25:57 2015 UTC,"yes its definatly just an idea, something I'd need to do a lot of research into and get experiance in IM injections into before every attempting something as radical as injecting into the tounge, just an idea though.  so you doubt injection into the tounge would offer any greater brain bioavalibilty than anymother site of IM injection?"
Nootropics,3cluea,nakedproof,1 point,Thu Jul 9 00:41:48 2015 UTC,"yes I don't believe it'll offer prove more beneficial than injecting in different im sites. I'm not aware of the popularity of im injection for neuro peptides. It's more common for PED's like insulin and anabolic steroids. I know along those lines some peptides like mgf can offer more of a localized muscle growth effect in the injection area  Iv injection is the best of all for immediate effect and availability though I think for some peptides such as semax ,subcutaneous injection will still work as well ,and by far will be the easiest to grasp as i've had a past history of diabetes when i needed to use insulin and can speak with experience"

Nootropics,3cf9sd,dczx,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:52:26 2015 UTC,"The Myth of Sisyphus:       The Myth of Sisyphus is a philosophical essay by Albert Camus. It comprises about 119 pages and was published originally in 1942 in French as Le Mythe de Sisyphe; the English translation by Justin O'Brien followed in 1955.  In the essay, Camus introduces his philosophy of the absurd: man's futile search for meaning, unity, and clarity in the face of an unintelligible world devoid of God and eternal truths or values. Does the realization of the absurd require suicide? Camus answers: ""No. It requires revolt."" He then outlines several approaches to the absurd life. The final chapter compares the absurdity of man's life with the situation of Sisyphus, a figure of Greek mythology who was condemned to repeat forever the same meaningless task of pushing a boulder up a mountain, only to see it roll down again. The essay concludes, ""The struggle itself [...] is enough to fill a man's heart. One must imagine Sisyphus happy.""  The work can be seen in relation to other absurdist works by Camus: the novel The Stranger (1942), the plays The Misunderstanding (1942) and Caligula (1944), and especially the essay The Rebel (1951).

I don't see how asking me this has anything to do with my question about the immune stimulating effects of Selank.   If Selank works to reduce anxiety then it would stimulate the immune system of those who suffer from anxiety by reducing the immune suppressing chemicals that are caused by anxiety. But if I don't suffer from anxiety or stress then I don't produce those immune suppressing chemicals so would Selank actually benefit my immune system? That's what I'm trying to figure out.

That isn't just anxiety its ""anxiety-asthenic disorders"" so it helps when the anxiety is so bad it has effected immune function.   One considers a person to be asthenic when he/she suffers from asthenia, meaning they are experiencing a weakening in their overall state, even in the absence of the smallest effort and when their state doesn't improve, despite rest. In an asthenic person, another disease that can be responsible for this state must be researched. It is possible that the asthenia is not caused by a physical illness but rather a psychic disorder, even though the asthenic person doesn't have any associated psychological disorder: this is the case in depressive people, or those suffering from anxiety or personality disorders.   That being said in normal people. It will boost immune function, has anti-viral properties, boosts vocabulary, gives motivation,  and induces a calm wellbeing state (it will do all of these independently).

Nootropics,3cizod,AddMoreWeight,11,Wed Jul 8 07:43:27 2015 UTC,"Take a look at where we are today compared to just 2 years ago. Change has been happening this whole time. However, we still exist in a grey area, with varying levels of risk involved. We also have new players enter the market every day, just to try and capitalize on what they see as a market trend. You also have vendors using shady marketing tactics to try and reach more mainstream customers, which causes issues for how people see nootropics. There are also more and more people looking to abuse certain substances that many people need to feel normal, which brings more unwanted attention and risk. So it is no secret as to why some in the community want to keep things hush hush, and out of the spotlight. I am torn every day on how I feel about the situation.  So I think the discourse has lessened because the people who are in it for the advancement of our understanding of cognition are starting to pull back a bit on what they say. Also, it is a lot easier to make money on tried and true compounds, rather than trying to advance things; not to mention less risky. So as more and more vendors pop up trying to sell things to mainstream users, more and more new people come to the community to ask basic questions. That in turn annoys those more advanced people who are looking to discuss new knowledge or compounds.   But we are living in the future now. We have come a long way. Purity testing is now a major priority for all consumers, forcing vendors to address it. Novel compounds, and improvement on existing ones, are being released all the time. Labs are starting to see the potential in the nootropics market, and are making it easier to get them to take on new synthesis projects. Two years ago, did I think I would be able to walk into the next room, and run purity testing in a matter of minutes? Hell no. But now I can, and it is exciting as hell! So even if we could be doing better from an exchange of knowledge standpoint, there is no doubt we are advancing as a community.

Nootropics,3cizod,MisterYouAreSoDumb,4,Wed Jul 8 19:03:35 2015 UTC,"The food and drug laws in the US are a lot different than in Russia. Also, patent laws vary between countries. Even the laws in the US are vague enough to be interpreted in different ways by different agencies. But yes, people in Russia are more likely to have used things like Semax and Phenylpiracetam. We have Russian customers that tell us they just go down to the store and pickup tons of things OTC. They say the compounds are not really actively marketed, though. It's just a different mindset and environment than in the US.  The real issue is that self enhancement is a new concept for many people. Everyone is used to being told to take something by a doctor, solely for the treatment of a disease/disorder. The nootropic movement is more about personal freedom, and enhancement past baseline. Many people are attempting to treat aspects of themselves that they feel are lacking; like anxiety, depression, memory, brain fog, etc. But more and more, people are realizing that there is no such thing as a standard baseline. Everyone has something that could be improved; even if those things are not necessarily correlated with a diagnosable disease. I have a mast cell disorder, so I treat that with antihistamines. However, am also a poor methylator; which is not really a diagnosable disease. So I self-treat with trimethylglycine and methyl-B12 to correct that. When I brought my genetic testing results into my GP, and even my immunologist, they had absolutely no idea what I was talking about. So obviously they did not prescribe me methyl donors to help balance those genetic mutations. I had to research on my own, and try things out, to find what worked best for me. That is the essence of the nootropics movement at the present time. People are realizing that we have access to an immense amount of information now, which makes self-experimentation feasible; whether that experimentation is attempting to treat a perceived deficiency, or to enhance oneself past a baseline.  So there is certainly incentive to develop nootropics. I am attempting to do that now, and not only hope to make headway on making certain ones more mainstream, but also hopefully make the legal environment in the US more conducive to self-experimentation."

You and I using nootropics are the odd ones out, but people have been improving their own wellbeing above survival since the Mesopotamians. It's nothing new. Really, every time somebody buys a chocolate milkshake instead of a fruit salad, they're just getting extra pleasure by going above and beyond the need for just survival. When somebody takes nootropics instead of remaining sober or staying home and smoking weed all day, they're just increasing productivity above what is needed for survival. When someone exercises, or meditates, or reads, or makes love outside the purpose of procreation, they're just maximizing certain aspects of their lives above what is needed for survival.   You and I and all other nootropic users, we have different priorities than people out there who want to maximize other forms of pleasure. And as we have different priorities, we can't imagine that nootropics are going to change the world, not all 6 billion people. Maybe the medicine industry, but not the world. Everyone has different priorities, and none are inherently better or worse than anyone else.   Don't go around spreading the word. People that want to maximize their productivity will find nootropics, or other ways to maximize productivity. Everyone else isn't ready yet. Don't spread the word to people who don't want to hear.

In terms of cost effectiveness:  The sprays are slightly more expensive then the reconstituted solution (adding the cost of bac water and syringes) and NASA is slightly more expensive then NAS. Regular Semax is the same price as NAS since you need twice as much to have the same effect.  So in terms of cost effectiveness, choose whatever itteration gives you the best results and either go SubQ (if you don't find it a pain in the ass lol) if you really want the best value, or spray if you are not comfortable with sticking needles in your belly (it's rather painless but it gets old very fast)..."

Is this possibly working alongside everything else to give the boost of energy a more euphoric feeling, instead of anxious?  Also, I feel as though I should mention I'm currently taking an SNRI (selective norepinephrine uptake inhibitor), Cymbalta specifically, and while I've heard people caution against using 5-HTP with SSRI's, I don't know that any of the ingredients have a significant effect on norepinephrine production.

Nootropics,3cgvnx,Bankais,3,Thu Jul 9 01:15:15 2015 UTC,"Most, if not all of the  ""boost"" you felt came from the caffeine. 192 mg of the rest of the ingredients puts them all in incredibly small doses, meaning they would likely have little or no effect.  Additionally, you probably get enough of the various amino acids in the drink through your diet.   PowderCity is a reliable vendor that will have the majority of the other ingredients in the blend. They have extremely cheap Caffeine and Theanine caps that work very well for just about everyone.   You might want to check out r/StackAdvice for more personal recommendations."
Nootropics,3cgvnx,lastPharaoh37,3,Tue Jul 7 20:53:29 2015 UTC,"actually that may not be true. The standard dose for Yohimbe is very low and most ppl report that this is something that falls under the category of ""more is not better"" bcuz only the tiniest amount will work for hours and any more you'll be anxious up the ass. so that and the caffeine are likely the boosters. Definitely check out powdercity.com because you can find nearly all those ingredients there for exceptionally good prices. don't forget FEDORA code for 10% off too."
Nootropics,3cgvnx,sprinterglory,3,Tue Jul 7 21:19:06 2015 UTC,"I agree with this guy.  The most psychoactive substances in this concoction are going to be yohimbine, caffeine, and huperzine A, in that order.  5 mg of yohimbine is enough to get most people really going, and 15 mg will cause many to start having panic attacks.  Search for symptoms of excessive acetylcholine (SLUG syndrome, I think it's called) if you're curious about what too much huperzine A will do to you.  There isn't enough of the amino acids listed in the amounts supplied for them to make a significant difference, though technically many of the remaining ingredients could have psychoactive effects."

Here are some selected quotations:    In many mammals, high melatonin levels suppress fertility in the winter, and when levels drop, the springtime fertility cycle begins. In fact, melatonin was investigated as a contraceptive in the 1990s and is commonly used in certain livestock to control fertility. . . . Given that melatonin is a natural fertility suppressant, suprisingly, when used experimentally in women and men undergoing fertility treatments such as IVF, it has been shown to improve the viability of the embryos and the quality of the sperm, and low doses of melatonin can bring on an early fertility cycle in sheep. Melatonin’s anti-oxidant properties rather than the hormonal suppresing properties may be key here, particularly in women undergoing IVF who are also getting other strong hormonal treatments via shots. . . . Low levels may promote one fertility state while high levels another.  . . . Considering the pronounced effects of the pineal gland and melatonin on reproductive physiology in these nonhuman mammals, to assume they would not have some sexual effects in humans would…seem naive."

Nootropics,3cdxne,dz93,5,Tue Jul 7 23:45:24 2015 UTC,I re dose SEMAX every day but honestly I think it lasts a long time. I still feel it at night and it's one of those nootropics where the next morning you wake up and still feel it. I judge the efficacy remaining into the next day by how in the morning I will feel amazing despite an early awakening.
Nootropics,3cdxne,SocialT,2,Tue Jul 7 15:21:45 2015 UTC,How much do you take? What version and MOA?
Nootropics,3cdxne,socialstapler,3,Tue Jul 7 23:39:59 2015 UTC,"400mcg in the morning, usually 200-400mcg in the early afternoon. Depends on the day and situation.  It's regular SEMAX from Ceretropic, taking it intranasally with the nasal sprayer."
Nootropics,3cdxne,SocialT,5,Tue Jul 7 23:44:48 2015 UTC,"I recall reading an animal study recently showing a fairly quick elimination, and a long (24hour+) duration of action. The explanation for this given was as semax levels dropped it's metabolites continued to work. They also tested for levels of semax, then semax minus an amino acid on the n-terminus, then minus two, etc. Basically what I'm saying is don't be afraid to google scholar this one. Unlike alot of the noots we see, there is a slew of research on semax."
Nootropics,3cdxne,nacholunchable,2,Tue Jul 7 21:20:56 2015 UTC,"I corroborate what /u/nacholunchable says here.

Nootropics,3cdxne,sprinterglory,2,Wed Jul 8 06:02:56 2015 UTC,"Selank might work better for mood then Semax imo.  As for the budget, I would first try a little of both (semax and selank), maybe the nasal spray to avoid purchasing needles and crossing that Rubicon...  If you react well, you could try different itteration of whatever works best for you and switch to subQ since it is cheaper or cook your own nasal spray....(you're goddamn right!)  I was one of the early adopters of Semax (yeah bitches I said it lol) and it worked well enough in the original form, at least for 24 hours in my case. Is the price difference of the other version worth it? Well, I can use 200mcg of NASA and find it to be the equivalent of 500 mcg of regular Semax and it is not exactly twice the price so... Just use whatever itteration you like best."

Nootropics,3cbbzc,WillDHunt,3,Mon Jul 6 21:15:33 2015 UTC,"It's less about having a high school education and more about embracing a willingness to actually examine the study. I've said it in the past here, but do not trust abstracts.  I remember one particular study I read. The conclusion was that ""meat is highly dangerous"". The abstract dictated as such. The actual study just grouped people together by processed meat intake (not meat, just ""processed meat"" for which there was no definition) and then averaged all cause mortality by servings per week. Unsurprisingly, about 70% of the increase in mortality disappeared when the data excluded people who had below-median vegetable consumption. They then proceeded to demonstrate that much of the all-cause morality disappeared if you ignored the samples that were below-median and thus in an obvious risk group, but they only ever did this for one group at a time--they never narrowed the statistics down to ""only people who engage in a healthy level of sleep/vegetable consumption/exercise"" with mortality rate then being charted by processed meat consumption. The only ever compared ""Processed meat intake vs. above/below median X"", one at a time.  Of course, their conclusion was that ""meat is dangerous"" because no specific factor erased the entirety of the mortality increase. Nevermind the fact that the study pool was huge and that they had more than enough data to group people by exercise/vegetable consumption/etc, they just didn't bother.   After that, I never trusted an abstract again.  Edit: I should also note that they refused to disclose how different the means were (ie: what was the average of any given above-median group) which further damages comparison, as the ""meat group"" may have had an average that was closer to the population median than, say, the vegetarian group which may have had a significantly higher average.  If you want a more egregious example, go take a look at the Seralini study which was another excellent mismanagement of science. It doesn't even take a high school level of education to understand these studies, what it takes it's a conspiracy theorist's level of skepticism to dig through, read them and double-check major points."

Nootropics,3cbbzc,WillDHunt,1 point,Mon Jul 6 23:29:30 2015 UTC,"Sadly, while abstracts are not supposed to state conclusions they often do. This is part of the problem since it encourages people to fish for data without actually examining the studies, since it's assumed that the paper actually backs it up and that the data was proven as a matter of fact. What usually happens is that there's ""reason"" to believe that's the case and weaknesses in the data can generally be found, especially in softer sciences which sadly tends to include nootropics. It's terribly easy to mess up a study with things like sampling bias, weird conclusions or a lack of an adequate control group.   That said, to the credit of research in general(?) there seems to be a lot of aggressively pro-vegetarian ""scientists"" out there who are more interested in conclusions than data. I'm not sure why this is but by far the shoddiest studies I've ever read have come out of dietetics. I really have no idea why anybody would ever be so aggressively pro-vegetarian but there does seem to be a fair number of them.  Of course there might be some anti-vegetarian scientists out there too and I've just never seen their work, I couldn't say. As a rule, people do an excellent job of wearing their bias on their chest like it's something to be proud of."

Nootropics,3cb95w,sciencebzzt,19,Mon Jul 6 15:44:21 2015 UTC,"Clonidine is an interesting drug, but it isn't without downsides. Fatigue and general somnolence are common side effects, which aren't exactly conducive to nootropic goals. Also, it is an anti-hypertensive agent, so you're quickly going to run up against a dose ceiling where lightheadedness and other side effects start to creep in if you don't already have high blood pressure. You'll also experience some mild rebound effects, included elevated blood pressure, which means you'll want to taper off. This blood pressure counter-regulation also means you probably won't be able to use this acutely with much success.  Also, increased levels of growth hormone are popular among anti-aging groups, but not among life-extension groups. Elevated GH can theoretically have anti-apoptotic properties that encourage the growth of cancerous cells. Correlation is weak, but elevated GH probably isn't ideal if life extension is your goal.  Also, the study you linked showed decreased cortisol in patients with melancholic depression, which is a disorder characterized by elevated cortisol levels. Cortisol is a complex hormone, but the idea that you always want to lower cortisol is bro-science territory. Taking cortisol levels too low is counter-productive, and you don't want to have too little cortisol because you'll end up in bad shape (think chronic fatigue, atypical depression, etc.). That said, I don't know how clonidine effects cortisol in healthy (non depressed) humans.  But the biggest downside of the alpha2 adrenergic agonists (clonidine, guanfacine) for cognitive enhancement is the depression that they seem to bring on in many people. Depression shows up in a lot of the short-term studies as a side effect, but if you follow internet anecdotes a lot of people discontinue due to depressive symptoms developed over the course of several months."

Overall, it's a very effective drug for many indications, but I definitely would not mess with it if you don't need it, I dunno everyone is different. It's not gonna kill you or anything, but it is an incredibly potent drug.   Guanfacine would be much more favorable in terms of a nootropic, but it as well has many similar side effects.

It was a godsend, so afterward, I looked it up for general anxiety, and it seemed to do exactly what I wanted it to do.

I could take as much L-theanine and Caffeine as a body could handle but I felt no effects. I was back to my old self and it felt like I had went to heaven and came back. I think the reason the result in many nootropics users is very hit or miss with L-theanine is because it induces Hypomania[2] or at least Cyclothymia[3] . I have tried many nootropics to try to experience it again but to no avail. Just a warning for anyone who is noticing a drastic improvement from L-theanine: it will come to an end. Be prepared to come back to your old reality.   This is commonly referred to as a tolerance. I'm highly doubtful theanine would induce hypomania.

Part of my work involves a lot of tasting and analysis, and requires a lot of focus to think, asses, and improve our coffee.   I've been wary of building a tolerance as I've noticed a huge difference in how I feel during long cupping (tasting 15-20 coffees) and roasting days. Usually I will have a sharp and sudden unpleasant hit from the caffeine, and a few hours later a really awful crash with lots of anxious feelings and sporadic mind activity. It really became something I dreaded, although it is necessary for my work. My mind and body would begin telling me to quitt before I even began the day.   The calm feeling and focus I get from 400mg of L-Theanine during those long days consuming the equivalent of probably 5 cups of coffee within two hours has made a huge improvement.

I had a similar experience to what you delineated from piracetam, bacopa, and vinpocetine when I was taking them years ago.  But I think this is exception, not the rule. L-theanine is for most people mildly sedating. To start issuing warnings like a bunch of people are going to have manic episodes taking it is making a PSA out of a strange phenomenon.

Nootropics,3ccf30,rmcfar11,3,Fri Jul 10 00:48:48 2015 UTC,"You won't find effects like vyvanse in most nootropics. They are more subtle in nature. There's a reason that amphetamines are not just prescription-only, but also a federally controlled substance."
Nootropics,3ccf30,ultimo_burrito,3,Tue Jul 7 16:42:56 2015 UTC,"Agreed! Not on nootropics. Maybe research chemicals (isopropylphenidate for example, which has no toxic metabolites) since they share a similar structure with a different esther. But it is a completely dark territory, albeit, in my opinion, probably safer than popping black market pills, since at least you know what RC you are ingesting provided your vendor is reputable.  I'm disapointed but I haven't found a true alternative to ADHD medication in nootropics and frankly, the side effect profile from some of these substances seems worst than true medication. Phenylpiracetam for example, leaves me drained and crashed, noopept makes me irritable and Adrafinil interacts with the liver in a weird way....   Edit about safety of isopropylphenidate:  Importantly, it should be noted that IPH is ultimately metabolized to the same major albeit pharmacologically inactive (Patrick et al., 1981) metabolite as MPH, i.e., ritalinic acid, and hence IPH will not be subject to yielding any uncharacterized metabolites that might otherwise be a source of concern due to a potential to produce adverse effects and/or toxicities"

On that thought, the ability to rate one's experiences with a variety of nootropics (including the entire stack that was used at the time), coupled with 23andme/ubiome data, user info (age, ethnicity, etc.), could be really useful.

Nootropics,3c7nak,joosmeyer,3,Sun Jul 5 19:38:52 2015 UTC,"Great resource! Many props for putting in the time and effort to create this. A few things that could be cool to consider once you have a large, regular contributing userbase: - Perhaps an upvote/downvote system similar to reddit - Creating a supplement database. Users will be able to choose from existing supps or add new ones if they're not in the database yet, when they create their stack. People viewing the stacks will be able to click on the individual supps in the stack and be linked to the database containing more info - you could start by just having links to other resources like examine.com. Also you could allow users to link the original research papers for each supp.  All in all great resource and I'm sure it'll grow rapidly :) thanks again!"
Nootropics,3c7nak,enterloop,2,Mon Jul 6 07:49:56 2015 UTC,Thanks! We already use a own supplement database. That's how the auto suggestions work. Examine.com and Wikipedia.com is also  already integrated. You just have to click on the supplements to get more information. That's why we recommend to always use the suggested supplements if possible. Doesn't it work for you?

Nootropics,3c7nak,gilesdavis,3,Sun Jul 5 20:50:28 2015 UTC,Interesting stack. The reason why it takes a while to load the supplement suggestions is that they are loaded from the server by request. It would take a lot longer to load all supplements at once. It also depends on your connection and where you're located because our server is in Europe.

I'm not sure exactly what to do about that since it's up to the users, but maybe put a warning so people double check important information like the form/concentration of the supplement? I personally think it's really important for safety reasons and it might be worth requiring (or at least encouraging) people to add information like this when posting a stack."

Nootropics,3c9wj5,_MoreNowAgain_,1 point,Mon Jul 6 06:47:32 2015 UTC,"Never tried it, but I'll swear on my life that Silexan (sold as CalmAid) an oral lavender based formulation eliminates my general, social and performance anxiety, calms intrusive thoughts and promotes relaxation.  Inhaling the aroma from non-standardised lavender oil does have a slightly similar effect, as does a hot water extract of lavender flowers... but that tastes horrible (like turpentine).  I also make tea from ceylon cinnamon (cassia sucks for its coumarin content toxicity) for the general heath benefits, but can't say it has any easily perceptible effect on mood:  http://examine.com/supplements/Cinnamon/"

Nootropics,3c9wj5,_MoreNowAgain_,2,Mon Jul 6 06:59:52 2015 UTC,oral half-life is decent:   Oral ingestion of Lavender (80mg as Silexan) appears to result in an increase in serum Linalool with an apparent half-life of 4 hours following acute administration and 9 hours following 11 days of repeated oral ingestion   http://examine.com/supplements/Lavender/#summary2

Nootropics,3c8xxn,FabioFan,2,Tue Jul 7 06:29:44 2015 UTC,"Well, that USB mini fridge works using a peltier device. Its possible you could rig up a peltier device to a carrying case for glasses or something and use that. What I'd do is insulate the inside of the case except for the area where the cool part of the peltier device would be and then come up with a custom heat sink that would dissipate heat efficiently without worrying about maybe burning yourself. Technology hasn't come around to the point where we can make a portable cooling case that's also looks pretty. If I built one it would still be somewhat bulky and would have an ugly heat sink on the outside. But it'd work. You could just use a lithium ion battery to power it and use USB to charge. It would be a very simple and cheap design.   I'll be buying a peltier device soon and working on a prototype for a portable, cooled, peptide carrying case.  My goal is to make a case that has a display that'll give you battery percentage and temp from inside the case. That way you will always know if its being cooled effectively and won't be caught off guard with a dead battery."
