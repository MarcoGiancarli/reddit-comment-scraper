ecr_eu,3e6hf7,OptimalOatmeal,2,Wed Jul 22 09:47:10 2015 UTC,That FA Joy must be quite something to make it into you top 5 already. Have been hearing nothing bit praise myself but have yet to get my hands on some.

Ive not tried the original but worked off a clone posted on elr. These flavours are great, the vanilla custard being a great Base to work with pretty much anything. Use it from 2% to 8% depending on what you want from it.  My muffin Man recipe is:  FW Cinnamon roll 6%  FA Fuji apple 1.5%  CAP VC 2%  FA Joy 1%  Only recently started adding joy to mixes. It's supposed to taste like fairgrounds or something. Can use it as a stand alone flavour at 3-5%, at 1% it adds some body to the juice. It tastes like donuts, candy floss and pastry."

The ones I send new vapers to are good and don't do that shit... They spend way too much time on some customers and won't make any money on them, but those customers will probably return and pull in more customers."
ecr_eu,3e3syl,trstn,2,Tue Jul 21 21:31:06 2015 UTC,"For my B&M, if you're going for tanks/liquid, it's similar prices to online (e.g. Vampire Vape liquid is £4 for 10ml, the Subtank Nano I bought was £20). It's mods and coils where they make their money (such as £3 per Aerotank/Subtank coil, or 5 for £12.). I reckon what helps for my B&M is that it's based in an area that's cheap for rent. I'm not sure about the rest of the shops the company owns, but the majority of them are based in the North West/Scotland, so it's probably a similar situation."
ecr_eu,3e3syl,trstn,2,Tue Jul 21 21:12:47 2015 UTC,"Running a shop is damn expensive. I costed one up after we opened up online and, well, there's a good reason we're still online only ;)"

I was a reasonably heavyweight digital architect / department leader before vaping (I saw a chance to change my life and spend more time with family and leapt at it). Online I can make work but retail is a different animal completely.  My dream was something kind of like a jazz bar, but a vapeshop. Amazing coffee / drinks, live music every now and then.

Juice prices on the big brands are pretty much the same as the internet (one or two US ones are even a bit cheaper) as I guess the juice mark-up and volume they shift is enough to keep the prices competitive. Hardware, yes pricey, fuggedboutit though the bread and butter sales of this and prob a lot of B&Ms is starter kits to first-timer walk-ins and juice not higher end hardware. In hindsight I could have saved 20% on my ego starter compared with the internet but I don't begrudge them that for the hour of advice I got and the subsequent support.

We DO pose a threat, the EU Parliament did stop medical regulation because of us, in the the hidden fight between the EU Parliament and EU council/commission we lost a lot, also because of a lot of misinformation ,lobbying, and blackmail.

At first I thought it was just what everyone suffered but it probably isn't. I get red, itchy lumps in my elbow and knee joints when I vape above 50/50 pg.  Just getting a harsh throat hit is common with high pg and is actually appealing to a lot of us. Unfortunately this includes me, I'd love a strong throat hit but I just can't up my PG ratio or I'll get the lumps from hades. If a juice feeling harsh is all you get then I'd recommend just sticking to a higher vg ratio as you noted, there's really no drawbacks to it."

You have the same reaction to PG it sounds like, just more sensitive to it. I think it's an irritation of my throat and lungs rather than an allergy in my case, though actual allergy to PG is certainly a thing for some people with a bunch more unpleasant effects.

ecr_eu,3e2z3c,elgaars,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:52:32 2015 UTC,"I am somewhat new to the game as well. Started out with aspire premium kit (naut mini + 1000mah vv battery), moved on to istick30w and subtank mini. Just recently I started like seriously building my own coils (just twisted 28g) and that's where I found out there's much more to the juices. When comparing the nautilus mini on my istick and the vv battery, there is a slight improvement in vapor and flavor production when used on the istick. But yeah, the biggest improvement was my own built coils.   Oh and, I did rebuild one of those nautilus coils myself, felt a little improvement in the flavor too!"
ecr_eu,3e2z3c,trstn,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:01:14 2015 UTC,"How complicated do you want it?  I've been through a lot of equipment over the last three years in business and here are my go to setups that I tend to use the most and in my opinion deliver the best balance of flavour and vapour.   Aspire CF mod and subtank mini with stock OCC .5ohm coils.    Fantastic balance between the amount of vapour and the density of flavour. Your ego will put out about 3.2 volts of power whereas the CF mod is set at 4.2 volts. It's only 1 volt more but it makes a difference (it'll also fire subohm whilst your ego won't) and for me it means the just right power level going into the subtank. Airflow is mostly aimed at lung inhales but mouth to lung are feasible.   DNA40 Railbox and Squape R   The squape r is rebuildable and the dna40 let's me tweak power levels to customise the vape. I tend to use 1.1ohm spaced coil at about 20w.  The CF mod and subtank combo is as simple as your ego setup, is cheap, and it 'just works', variable stuff like isticks and dna devices can be hassle getting right so it depends what you prefer.  One word of warning, Loads of people will likely recommend the istick but I've seen as many posts from people saying that their istick broke for no reason as from people saying their istick is amazing, so do your research before you buy anything ;)"

ecr_eu,3e2z3c,DropKickRick,2,Tue Jul 21 16:55:30 2015 UTC,"Yes, flavour is mainly the atty, but you will need a good battery/mod to make full use of these.  Most people who start vaping go down  the same road as you do now. Take it from one who has, you will want to move up pretty soon, and putting more money in the ultra low end devices will only be lost money later on.  The cheapest I would go is a iStick 20w with a Nautilus Mini (for mouth to lung style vaping) else the subox kit is very good for dub ohm :)"

ecr_eu,3e1kjx,Eternal_Sunshine,10,Tue Jul 21 06:34:44 2015 UTC,"As I said in the last hangout for me it will be a game changer when they go balls deep into it and make a beginner setup only able to dial in the temp. A vision spinner style device with only temp control.   No more dry hit for beginners, consistent vaping experience, only thinking about ""how hot I want my vape to be?""  that would be a game changer I think."
ecr_eu,3e1kjx,Sangaren,5,Tue Jul 21 08:36:08 2015 UTC,"Ive been using it since it came out, and 100% converted since day 1.  temp control means I dont have to worry about dry hits on a dripper, ie I can fully relax when I vape"
ecr_eu,3e1kjx,VapeVideos,4,Tue Jul 21 08:46:39 2015 UTC,"For me, definitely.   Been using the SX Mini with Ni200 coils for 3 months and now I can't actually use traditional Kanthal coils any more as the flavours just taste burnt. Which pretty much puts the rest of my mod collection out of action.   Plus I've forgotten what a dry hit was.   I am in no doubt a 100% convert to TC."
ecr_eu,3e1kjx,borez,4,Tue Jul 21 09:51:41 2015 UTC,"For me it has. 90% of my dripping, which is most of my at home vaping is on a TC mod. Haven't put too much effort in getting it right on RTA's yet though if I hear /u/borez successtory I believe it is possible and the way forward for RTA's as well.   I don't really buy into the whole nickel sucks thing. It is a different vape yes but not worse than kanthal. Both have their pros and cons.   I still like to drip with a mech now and then but the vape of a TC mod I think dripper is just superior in usage and consistency.   Until there's TC with kanthal, which well then prove that nickel has little to do with how TC affects the vape, it won't become a staple as VW is now. I still believe the concept of VW is inferior to VV btw.   We also need starter kits that do TC. There are decent entry level tanks with organic cotton coils that are small enough to appeal to new vapers but only having VV/VW or no regulation puts their experience at risk.   Edit: this post and a day of drove me to give TC on my K4 another go. Twisted .20mm nickel - 3mm diameter working like a charm so far. This is the wire that's been giving me the best vape on drippers as well. Something about the small space in the coil Due to the wraps that just works like a charm."
ecr_eu,3e1kjx,sjugge,3,Tue Jul 21 12:45:46 2015 UTC,"I think its changing the game, but not completely changed (or yet at least)  From what I've used (Sig 75W TC with Lemo 2) its very good.  The premise of less / zero dry hits is a really good one and should tempt a few people into rebuilding more.   Excited to get a TC device coming in a few weeks so I can play with it more though."

ecr_eu,3e1kjx,Dumbgecko,2,Tue Jul 21 06:49:32 2015 UTC,"I've been trying Ti with a dna40 and its good, but I still trust my usual Kanthal setup more.

ecr_eu,3e1kjx,OptimalOatmeal,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:09:12 2015 UTC,"I have still to get TC right on a tank. Most tanks coming out these days are dual coil decks that are rather small. On a Kayfun I haven't succeeded yet, but haven't put too much effort in.  I'm also not a fan of stock coils since it makes me dependent on availability of the coils.   I'm using a DNA40 and (these days mostly) the SnowWolf 200w with drippers, almost exclusively the velocity. Going back to kanthal drippers feels rather sketchy now."
ecr_eu,3e1kjx,sjugge,2,Tue Jul 21 12:38:03 2015 UTC,my set up  mods : rdna 40 v2 (without atty lock) and sx mini mclass (firmware upgraded rta : taifun gt2 (authentic) rba : troy x1 and aeolus v2 (on the way)  as far as i tried yeah its good for flavor (cotton and the wire needs to be broken in as in gets in optimal condition) but unless i can get a stable 1 week coil without being wizard i am not gonna buy any more mods with tc.i dont mind using diffirent wires but i need to know if the coil wont get hot spots after i rewicked it.recoiling everyday would be a hassle. on gt 2 i get 1 week coil lifespan easy (i change the coil every week and rewick everyday) to be honest if nickel wouldnt be this fiddly and mods were stable i would completely turn into tc in a flash.
ecr_eu,3e1kjx,zvankli,3,Tue Jul 21 17:01:36 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately not. It hasn't had the same impact that the innovation from variable voltage to variable wattage has had in fine tuning your vape experience.   Temperature control can be brilliant, however it relies on a number of variables. The type of wire you're using will have a dramatic impact on the quality of vape you experience; you will not be able to achieve the 'warmth' you were accustomed to with Kanthal if you're using Ni200. I have, however, been impressed with Grade 1 Titanium. I also think you're more likely to see a benefit from TC if you're primarily a tank user; a lot of the benefits of TC are somewhat lost on RDAs.  The DNA 200 isn't really bringing anything new to the TC game that doesn't already exist in some form or other elsewhere. Being able to set a custom temperature coefficient based on the type of wire you're using is something the Dicodes and Geeco chips already allow you to do. The DNA's EScribe software makes it much easier/user friendly though."

ecr_eu,3e1kjx,nellocin,2,Tue Jul 21 11:04:26 2015 UTC,"I think you don't usually get dry hits with RDA's as when the wick is getting dry, you can taste it before getting a dry hit."

(sorry I had too!)  my advice is, just because you've moved in together, doesn't mean that you have to do everything together, make some time to do your own thing, either by yourself or friends, on that note don't forget your friends, I made the terrible mistake of kind of rejecting my friends once my partner moved in, and although I've made up with them now, it was a horrible experience to have no one to turn too if you wanted to talk about something you couldn't share with your SO.  Also, you will argue, sometimes big, sometimes small, but it happens! to every couple! take it with a pinch of salt!  good luck! it'll be a great experience!"
ecr_eu,3dx9ii,DogLif3,2,Mon Jul 20 09:39:03 2015 UTC,"Congratulations! Living together is all about communication, as has been stated already. Talk about things before they get muddled with more emotional weight than was originally there. Don't be selfish and don't let the other grow too selfish of your selflessness either.

The decision was a spur of the moment and, all in all, i do not regret this decision 3 years later, even though i sacrificed quite a lot of things to just be with her.  We communicated over Google translate for the first year because she didnt speak English and i didnt speak French. For two and a half years we slept on a dirty matress.  Well 6 months ago we finally moved to our own apartment and its awesome apart from the fact that we need to share our TV.   I'm sure you wont regret the decision. Despite small fights, living together is awesome and takes the relationship to a new level of comfort - and you might discover some new things about yourself as well.  For me, it was the fact that i'm a sleeptalker/sleepwalker. My girlfriend discovered that when i had a nightmare that there was an earthquake.  She woke up to a huge rumble just to see my naked, pale, bruised ass on the floor half-concious. Apparently, i had jumped off the bed to take cover from the debris. She was terrified, but the next morning we had a good laugh about that."

Do little things for her lots and you will be happy together. As someone said, flowers are good. I find the best way to a womans heart is to do shit. Do some laundry (don't fuck up her clothes in the process) or cook her some bacon if she's having a sleep in. Let her know you are thinking of her. And yea arguments are important. Don't think having an argument is a big thing or a relationship ender. The trick is to learn from the arguments and make things constructive."

Since she's moving in with you, make sure you make her feel like it's her place as well. Take decorating and furniture decisions together. It's tempting to just take a decision and change something in your place but keep in mind it's not only yours anymore.   Also, I hope you're already comfy with the natural noises that can occur. Get that stuff out of the way asap. Otherwise you'll be in a world of pain."

ecr_eu,3dx9ii,whateverisfree,2,Mon Jul 20 15:07:04 2015 UTC,"One of the biggest advices I can give you is following - Agree on furnishing early on. sit down and talk how you want your appartment/closet/house whatever to look and agree on a certain theme or whatever. If not, she'll most likely go out from time to time and buy stuff and you to, but you're buying completely different themed things and after a while your entire closet looks like a mess."

Just kidding, you gotta do it so you know why you're going through midlife crisis and who to blame when you do.  My second advice is set boundaries right. fucking. now. (if time machine available do it yesterday) She'll always be kicking the air when you try to draw the line, and so will you when she does the same, but passive aggressive wins, so you lost already. So keep in mind she'll be much sweeter to you now then 6 months in. This sounds a little /r/theredpill I know, but it has proven true to me time and again - set the rules and definitions within 24h of having sex for the first time. You can apply this metaphorically to your new situation. Or it may be too late already.  You'll both love it and hate it either way, so try to focus on the good stuff. Over and out."

You're going to be annoyed by things she does and vice versa. Just the smallest things can become irritating. Like leaving closet door open, or leaving empty milk cartridge in the fridge.   Of course these things doesn't appear instantly, it'll take time. You'll probably get this ""honeymoon"" phase all over again and everything will be awesome.  Good luck on moving together :) Remember to be really open about stuff and tell all the things that either one of you might have done that may cause some sort of drama later on.

She is a smoker, and I've been trying to convert her to vaping, but I face a problem. She is a skeptical, because she is a pharmaceutical and doesn't believe in using substances in conditions which haven't been thoroughly medically tested. I sense her curiosity, but her rationality keeps her from moving on.

France/Netherlands/maybe Germany has a few rather doable options, but often it ramps up the price like mad.  Or I just send some small stuff to new vapers.

Like watermelon? If you add (x) to the watermelon concentrate then it'll bring out the sweet/sour/umami/whatever notes. I'm talking about citric acid and the various sweeteners that are available.   Also, a general breakdown of which companies concentrates are known to be super strong. (I've made juices with 20% flavour before that were waaaaay too strong)  Great job doing this, thanks!"
ecr_eu,3dx3qo,Marmite50,2,Mon Jul 20 07:14:57 2015 UTC,"Ah I see, so you would like to know more about additives?  Also there is a rough recommended % thing kicking about somewhere for most of the common concentrates! I will definately include different strengths and the likes!"
ecr_eu,3dx3qo,Marmite50,1 point,Mon Jul 20 07:22:00 2015 UTC,That'd be great. Yeah the additives are what scare me a bit and I'm pretty sure they're why my juices don't taste 'premium'. A breakdown of them would be amazing thanks!

ecr_eu,3dx3qo,hapticsquid,1 point,Mon Jul 20 09:35:55 2015 UTC,Yeah thats the plan! I will hunt down cheapest options for UK mainly. But I will try and get as many EU vendors in as I can!
ecr_eu,3dx3qo,hapticsquid,2,Mon Jul 20 17:15:02 2015 UTC,"k.i.s.s springs to mind for the first installment, it's a minefield even when you are confident about your first order, you got the usual suspects lined up pg/vg/nic/flavors they arrive, and BOOM! you just throw everything including the kitchen sink at it waste all your supplies and give up as you didn't create that ""premium"" juice you thought you could manage.  It seems really complicated at first, and i'm sure thats what turns people off the most.  For me trial and error was such a learning curve, and as subjectivity is commonplace here i think we can all agree sometimes it's the simple recipes are often the best, we revisit them when we've had enough of those 12 flavor profile combo breakers. Try to put across its OK to be that guy who doesn't need everything from the get go, and learn how our pallets recognise the flavor profiles over a longer period of time to make a better judgement call on the next recipe.   I hope some of my ramblings may be useful to you in some way because as you know there are a slew of guides out there and i often think the simple ones are the best.   Edit: Forgot to mention how important safety is of course, and nicotine selection in pg/vg, benefits and overall quality of it ect harsh/peppery/colour/taste  :)"
ecr_eu,3dx3qo,Mrdirtypixel,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:14:39 2015 UTC,"I agree. It takes a lot of adjustment and obsession to crack it. But your right, its trial and error. First juice I made tasted like a bubblegum wet dog kind of thing, was horrendous!   Simple recipes are the best usually, look at mustard milk for example. Stupidly easy to do and incredibly tasty!  Safety will be covered quite comprehensively, especially around nicotine, safe storage, etc."
ecr_eu,3dx3qo,Lavalamb,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:24:39 2015 UTC,"For starting at small scale, quantities of ingredients, shelf life and the economics of how much to buy is the thing I'm most unsure about. What I mean is, I get through on average 30ml a week of juice, 50ml at a push, and then if I do some DIY that wouldn't be the only juice I consume, will still be buying the great juices I'll never be able to  replicate. What worries me most is I end up wasting money making more juice than I can get through and buying more raw Ingredients than I'll use up?"
ecr_eu,3dx3qo,Lavalamb,3,Mon Jul 20 07:32:35 2015 UTC,"Shelf life is an important one! Juice should be good for a while!  Buying can be quite a difficult one, it depends what you are doing! Buying pg/vg in largish quantities is not a worry, they dont really spoil. Investing in nicotine is a good idea also, just make sure to freeze it in amber glass bottles!  DIY can require a largish sum to start off, but the result is juice for pennies per ml.   In my opinion it is a good idea to look for recipes which you know for a fact you will like and will happily have a large quantity of. Make that as your ADV and just pick up the daft concentrate to play with.   Buy to make recipes, chances are you will have a lot left over after making it. And build up from there.  To get more to your point, if you know roughly how much you will consume and you have a good ADV then work it out on an online calculator a rough amount and just make that.  For example mixing up 100ml of mustard milk every two weeks, so you dont end up with a lot of wasted juice. The more you get into it, the less and less you will probably spend on your juice. Especially if you happen to stumple upon a clone!"
ecr_eu,3dx3qo,whateverisfree,1 point,Mon Jul 20 07:42:56 2015 UTC,"Great answer, thank you. tbh even 200ml a month of DIYed ADVs would be a craptonne of juice for my needs. But as you say, if it's costing pennies per ml after you get past the start-up cost then not worth worrying too much about failed experiments and a bit of waste :)"
ecr_eu,3dx3qo,Mrdirtypixel,1 point,Mon Jul 20 09:22:46 2015 UTC,"I have a large tub which has roughly over a litre of failures in there, I do try and vape them when I can but chances are they will be binned at some point.

ecr_eu,3dx3qo,trstn,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:19:13 2015 UTC,"I'd love to know about actual mixing techniques, do you just pour it all in and give it a good mixing. Do you use any equipment? Also steeping are there techniques that can be used to guarantee a good juice once steeped?"
ecr_eu,3dx3qo,trstn,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:39:57 2015 UTC,"I do it in a certain way, but thats because I am a creatue of habit. It doesnt REALLY make a difference. I always tend to add nic first just to get it out the way.   Chances are you will be heating up the liquid (hot bath) to make the juice a little less viscous for shaking, or using a stirrer, or a sonic cleaner, etc etc.  Steeping, everything is pretty much hype in my opinion. Nothing beats letting it sit in a dark cupboard like a kitchen cabinet and occasionally shaking it and letting the air out!"

ecr_eu,3dxf4g,sjugge,4,Mon Jul 20 10:41:28 2015 UTC,"Get started with reading the /r/diy_ejuice sidebar. Twice. Check the listing of top 10 concentrates and check the recipe threads.   Advised is to get started with a clone of a juice you like. Nana Cream is a solid clone and has a limited amount of ingredients. There are quite a few other recipes out there that are worth trying. There's also a few posts with notes a a whole lot of flavours. Look 'm up, people have already done a lot of legwork.   There's plenty of vendors that sell Base liquid where you can choose nic, PG and VG levels. I can recommend Cloud House Vapor and Pink Mule. I use the latter one for the bulk of my DIY purchases.   Cloud House Vapor also sells concentrates from MBV, these offer great one flavour diy juices. It allows you to get to terms with the process of mixing.   Get an account on e-liquid-recipes.com and poke around at the wealth of info there. You can find recipes by rating, flavours and find recipes based on your flavour stock.   As I said, start with tried and tested recipes or single pre-made flavour recipes before you dive off into the deep end. If you go out buying and mixing flavours at random, you'll likely get very frustrated."

ecr_eu,3dv9b4,JereHakala,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:48:55 2015 UTC,"I've only just started using  Ni200 in the last few weeks. I put a single coil 0.15ohm build on the Hastur this weekend and really surprised how well it's performing, a lovely vape and terrific flavour. I can recommend the Hastur if you want a flavour RDA for easy single coil Ni builds. So good that I don't want to go back to kanthal on it. I've got Joyetech's Ni200 0.3ohm coils in the Delta II. These are good, flavour maybe a little better than the stock kanthal but not much to choose between them. They need the temperature up at 450 to 500F to get good performance, it's a weak vape below that. Overall not much different to the kanthal coils tbh and in 6 months I've never had a dry hit from the Delta II on kanthal unless I accidentally vaped the tank dry. Nice to have TC on this tank and it works well but no big step forward."

ecr_eu,3dv9b4,SiSkEr,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:38:56 2015 UTC,I'm looking as well for a good tank for TC. What watts people managed to sustain @440°F? / 225°C ?  I have the cthulhu and the goblin RTA. I had more luck wicking the Cthulhu and get about ~25 watt sustained watts. What I mean with sustained watts is set power to max and temp to 440°F and the average watts that are displayed after the coil heated up. This is mostly limited by the wick I've found not airflow or coil. After a few days I have to rewick becaue the sustained power @440°F goes down to 18 watts and stuff which is too weak for me.   Another problem with tanks is space - I can't fit 3mm ID twisted wire into my Cthuhlu and 2mm ID twisted is already very cramped.  With drippers I had no problems. Magma and Derringer work well. With triple twisted NI200 32 AWG dual coil I can sustain ~40 watts on my derringer. But I'm somewhat tired of constantly having to redrip and would love to go back to tanks. But unable to hit anything above 30 watts @ 440°F.  I've heard that people vape the kanger subtank and the arctic at levels like 75 watts but I figure they effectively vape at very high temps like > 500°F which I hate. Or do big lung hits which I don't like either.

ecr_eu,3duv7l,Jimmith,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:07:18 2015 UTC,"I've found that SNG takes a while to age and come into its own. Rustic Melon used to be my ADV for a quite some time, I still have about 60ml sitting here which has now turned almost black from aging. It gets a lot stronger with time and seems to become less sweet.  White And Nerdy is in fact still one of my favorite juices from them, it's a very heavy menthol with fruit. Unfortunately they've discontinued it but CHV apparently struck a deal with them to keep it in the shop. I'll be ordering some of the concentrate soon because I'm nearly out and I want to ensure I have some stock ;)"

ecr_eu,3duv7l,SirRisc,2,Sun Jul 19 22:14:20 2015 UTC,Is the menthol overbearing? I found the Menthol to be quite strong in Thug Juice and that's as strong as I like menthol
ecr_eu,3duv7l,FarkMcBark,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:16:35 2015 UTC,"It's definitely a lot stronger, if Thug Juice is your maximum menthol tolerance W&N will probably be too heavy for you.

I DIY'd some their Pixie Dust a while back and it was a lovely mellow fruity tarty vape that I couldn't quite put my finger on. I let a mate try it and she thought it was a bit like refreshers sweets.  I could vape it all day long but it wasn't in stock with my last order.
ecr_eu,3du7ws,fluffton,2,Sun Jul 19 14:55:30 2015 UTC,Nice!  I've been thinking of doing this with the board of my Vamo (can't get that thing apart) or the MM360B board. What board are you using? The fact it shows amps is quite interesting.
ecr_eu,3du7ws,sjugge,2,Sun Jul 19 15:16:03 2015 UTC,I'm using a display not a full blown board. Wired in with a p channel mosfet.   The display I used is the modmeter and yes showing amperage is brilliant it's something I've wanted for a long long time.

ecr_eu,3du7ws,overachiever,2,Sun Jul 19 15:28:23 2015 UTC,You got any fuses in there and does the orange box check for shorts?
ecr_eu,3du7ws,Dumbgecko,2,Sun Jul 19 15:26:44 2015 UTC,"It displays resistance so if there's a short you'll know about it due to stupid low reading it also actively monitors this so if you have a dodgy connection you will see the resistance fluctuate a lot (tested with lemo because it's well known for making a shit connection). The screen has 10s cut out after firing. I noticed it doesn't cut out when no atty is attached so will have to keep an eye on that. But using it as a mod means you most likely won't even notice that issue. I only did because I made an ohm reader thing.   And no I don't have any fuses in there because I'm not fussed about them. could wire in a 15a fuse but there's not really much need for me to do so. The lowest I usually build is 0.3o which only pulls about 10a from my bats. And it's not like this is going to be used non stop all day everyday. The mosfet is rated to 75a, and my battery is rated to 20a so I'm really not worried about blowing anything up.   The screen itself has reverse polarity protection so if bat is inserted it won't kill the screen. That doesn't cover the whole circuit but the screen will be fine."

ecr_eu,3dv8se,Nice-MayMay,3,Sun Jul 19 22:47:08 2015 UTC,"The issue is the charger being used, but ""improper use of charger causes fire"" isn't as good an headline as ""ecig explodes"".  Because USB looks universal, everyone assumes it is, but it's not. I have four USB plugs here to hand, all with different outputs from 1 amps to 2.1 amps.  If I use the 2.1 amps with the wrong phone then the phone gets hot, if I use the 1 amps plug with the wrong phone it takes a f#cking age to charge.  But, the hot phone never explodes because it has a decent protection circuit. Cheap ecigs on the otherhand don't seem to have that and go boom because Li-Ion is actually a surprisingly dangerous battery technology. As seen with all the laptop explosions a few years ago and all the problems with the dreamliner last year. If you use it right, ace, but if you abuse it, boom :("
ecr_eu,3dv8se,trstn,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:02:09 2015 UTC,"You are completely incorrect regarding current. It's the load that dictates the amps drawn, not the source. Needless to say, USB power supplies are universal. If an ego charger is designed to draw 420mAh, it will make no difference if it's used with a 0.5A or 2A power brick. Ports are also coded and devices recognize them before drawing their maximum current.  In your phone example, the phone gets hot because batteries become hot when they're charged at nominal currents. 18650s become hot too when charged at 1A."
ecr_eu,3dv8se,ferongr,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:01:43 2015 UTC,"Hm, if that was the case then why are ecigs exploding when used with USB plugs that have too high an ampage output?  The phone that gets hot came with  1.1amp plug and doesn't get hot when charged with that, yet it does get hot when I use the 2.1 amp plug.  I'm quite happy to be wrong here, but the exploding ecigs seem to be due to over charging or charging too quickly."
ecr_eu,3dv8se,trstn,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:46:29 2015 UTC,"It gets hot with a higher amp brick because the phone detects the powerbrick's capabilities and charges the battery faster. More current equals more heat, both when charging and discharging cells. It's nothing to worry about.  Exploding ecigs are due to bad quality circuitry and/or assembly standards. A USB powerbrick cannot influence the current that will be drawn from it, in the same way a 20 amp battery will not produce more power on a 1.8Ohm coil compared to a 10 amp battery."

Things is, remember we are a very small minority with ecig users, so we can be 'safer' usering externally charged batteries and the likes but the majority are still going to be using microusb charging or with an ego charger.  If these chargers are unsafe and overheat, ignite, etc then that wont be the users fault. It would be who provided them with them."
ecr_eu,3dv8se,NovaVapes,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:30:38 2015 UTC,"Shouldnt the device just draw the correct amount of amps from the charger   Yes. Most people misunderstand how power supplies work. It's the same reason you can use a 800W PC power supply with components that do not need such power. And the same reason a 20amp battery will perform identically to a 10 amp battery with a high resistance atomizer.  It's the load resistance and the source's voltage that dictate the current. A source cannot ""push"" more current or violate Ohm's law (electric motors and things like that are a whole different thing but eh...)"
ecr_eu,3dtmoj,clockwisecarrot,5,Sun Jul 19 09:53:06 2015 UTC,"Nice that the publication has a TL/DR section to start, but going through the hole thing, there are some odd and noteworthy passages.    Two commercially available e-cigarettes (NJOY Bold and NJOY Menthol /red) were obtained ... containing 4.5% and 3.0% nicotine by volume, as specified by the manufacterer.   That's some high nic %   Cigarettes were smoked to eight puffs/cig. E-cigarettes were puffed for 30 min, equating to 60 puffs at an independent intense puffing regime, defined as a 80 mL puff drawn over 3 s with 30 s intervals, and using a square-wave puffing profile, to actuate the electronic device.    The amount and interval of puffs is actually pretty decent I think. Better than some questionable studies or even QC methods seen in China (pbusardo's video's). I don't think the square-wave puffing profile is very realistic compared to an actual human one but likely not to make that much of a difference.    A dose-dependent decrease in cell viability was seen following incremental hourly exposures to cigarette smoke for up to 6 h, resulting in reductions of around 90% at the highest dose. By contrast, the two e-cigarettes did not cause cytotoxic effects under any of the test conditions, despite a much larger puff volume and exposure frequency in the e-cigarette machine smoking regime ... and cell viability did not differ between products. Cell viability differed significantly after exposure to cigarette smoke and exposure to NJOY Bold or NJOY Menthol.   Yay!   This study confirms that a commercially available 3D, fully differentiated tissue model of primary human tracheobronchial epithelium can be used to test irritation from e-cigarette aerosols at the air–liquid interface, with use of a MTT cytotoxicity endpoint. EpiAirway™ tissues were apically assessed with known irritants. Furthermore, the cytotoxic effects were compared between cigarette smoke and e-cigarette aerosols.   The testing parameters seem decent, the lab setup as well. Seeing as they compared air as a main control and used analogs as control for ecigs, I'd say this is a study and method that deserves some attention.    Electronic cigarette cytotoxicity: No reduction was seen in tissue cell viability and the results for e-cigarette aerosol did not differ significantly from the untreated air controls, after 6 h of continuous exposure. The reductions seen in TEER with exposure to e-cigarette aerosols were not statistically different from those for the diluting air controls at 6 h, which demonstrates no effect on tissues. ... In combination with the QCM data, which demonstrates that e-cigarettes provided approximately 3.5 times more deposited mass than cigarette smoke, the absence of an irritant effect is reassuring.   Moar yay!   The authors report no conflicts of interest and are employees of British American Tobacco or contracted by British American Tobacco. Louise Neilson, David Thorne and Clive Meredith are employees of British American Tobacco. Courtney Mankus, Jason DeBay and George Jackson are employees of MatTek Corporation, USA. All work conducted was funded by British American Tobacco.    This is obviously reason to remain sceptical.   In closing of this biased selected passages of the study, a pic of the smoking machine."

ecr_eu,3dustl,grmacp,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:06:06 2015 UTC,If i remember rightly (its been a while!) The ce5 has larger air slots as opposed to the evod's smaller air holes and as such the draw on the evod is tighter. This can be compounded if you have a clone evod as they tend to have two instead of three airholes as well again reducing the airflow.  I hope its helpful!
ecr_eu,3dustl,Dumbgecko,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:10:48 2015 UTC,Cheers. The holes do look larger although I did have 3 on the kanger O ring. Silly question but would blocking one up do any harm? It does seem to improve when I cover one with a finger

ecr_eu,3dugj3,hapticsquid,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:48:54 2015 UTC,"I've been using mine for 6 months daily at work and really like it. It's taken quite a few knocks and still working fine, no significant issues, touch wood. It's a great choice for a simple, elegant device that gives a satisfying vape. Only frustration I've had with it is it's sometimes reluctant to come out of lock/power off on 5 clicks, I usually have to remove the tank to get it to unlock for some reason, go figure. Things to know:     Battery life is decent on the 2220mAh version. I wouldn't bother with the smaller Mini you aren't going to get a working day out of a charge.  It charges fast. The 1ohm CLR (rebuildable coils) are significantly better than the standard coils, they just wick a lot more consistently. There are 0.5ohm CLRs but not seen then on sale in EU. Same price as the standard coils so even if you aren't bothered about ever rebuilding a coil these are the ones to get (I don't bother rebuilding I only rewick). Pretty easy to rewick them so you will save money on coils too. The standard ones, I've never had a dry hit but they can be a bit inconsistent from draw to draw, sometimes a bit floody, sometimes a bit weak. It's an unregulated device so works like a mech in the sense that you will experience the drop off in voltage and power as the battery drains. Not a biggie in day-to-day use, I don't notice it much, and it gives you warning of it with fire button flashes. But worth knowing about if you're used to a regulated variable device.  The drip tips supplied are a bit shit, one chromed plastic and a rubbish clear plastic one that stains after a couple of weeks. I fits all my other drip tips fine though so not a thing to worry about."
ecr_eu,3dugj3,Dumbgecko,0,Sun Jul 19 16:39:11 2015 UTC,"What's a CLR coil? Can I not just get 0.5 Ohm coils? I'm looking for something easy and simple to maintain, it looks perfect for me. Also I don't understand the unregulated battery draining part can you elaborate? I'm not too savvy when it comes to regulated and unregulated devices."
ecr_eu,3dugj3,Dumbgecko,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:42:37 2015 UTC,If you go for the .5 coils your essentially taking a side step with a slightly different performing tank and what is basically a regulated mech. Have you tried the higher resistance coils in your current set up?   Might save taking the gamble buying a new set up that you may not get what you want from?

ecr_eu,3dugj3,goldfish_of_chaos,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:20:17 2015 UTC,No problem! It happens to all of us sooner or later
ecr_eu,3dugj3,goldfish_of_chaos,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:57:46 2015 UTC,"A regulated device will always maintain say 3.7v or whatever voltage/wattage you set until the battery is so low it can't maintain it any more. Unregulated just means it outputs at the voltage the battery can supply at it's charge level, so the power going to the coil will get progressively lower as the battery drains. This means that as the battery falls below 50% or so you will notice the vape becoming weaker, and a lot weaker as you get towards zero charge. Unlike a mech it will shut off automatically to stop you damaging the battery by discharging it too much, it also tells how much you've drained it with fire button flashes. In practice really aren't going to notice much until you're vaping the dregs out of the battery at the end of day.    The standard 0.5ohm coils are really fine. The CLR are the new rebuildable ones, cost the same, you can just throw them away if you don't want to ever rewick or re-coil them. imo they give a better vape than the original coils so if you have the choice, buy CLRs as spares. The 1ohm CLRs are pretty damn good even if you're used to the standard 0.5s, I'd recommend trying them if you get one."
ecr_eu,3dugj3,goldfish_of_chaos,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:58:15 2015 UTC,Any idea roughly how long the battery will last before it drains / dies or whatever?
ecr_eu,3dugj3,Unlucky_Narwhal,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:59:56 2015 UTC,"It's not the only device I vape during the day so hard to say accurately as I always recharge it long before it gets low. On 1ohm coils I guess I can get through maybe 2 tanks full (2.8ml) so at least 5ml of juice on one full battery charge. On 0.5 ohm coils maybe half that, so 1ish tanks of juice before the battery is done."
ecr_eu,3dugj3,trstn,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:05:16 2015 UTC,"I have used the ego one XL for a few months now. A full charge with 1ohm coils lasts me about 2 days.

ecr_eu,3drjl6,Knurlinger,3,Sat Jul 18 21:21:20 2015 UTC,"TLDR: This is a review in the form of an image.    Hey people! I'm back again with another visual review. This one was pretty challenging, but I had to draw it - Becouse it's simply my favorite juice ever.  For those who are unfamiliar with my reviews: This is an ongoing experiment for me. I try to visualize how a e-juice tastes with the use of imagery, colors and symbolism. The point of these reviews are not to be the most detailed reviews, but rather to communicate the flavour through my artwork and a few well chosen words.    I bought this juice from spiritusvapes.com and have recieved no compensation for this review.    If you have a juice that you feel warrants a visual review I would be happy to try it - But please note that since these reviews take a lot of time I will only do a visual review if the juice tickles my imagination.    As always, please tell me what you feel about my artwork, how this fits with your experience of this flavour - and share your tips for what juices I should try."

ecr_eu,3dts3p,Zylias2,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:29:08 2015 UTC,Me too. Maybe because I ordered SnG and MBV together. I actually cheated and checked my order ;)
ecr_eu,3dts3p,kingpool,2,Sun Jul 19 17:31:34 2015 UTC,I really like Hawk Sauce / Faux Hawk and Admiral berry Crunch as well. Didn't like Thug Juice though.  For me the ADV thing doesn't really work. I bought a boatload of Hawk Sauce but I get used to flavours in a way that I get selective olfactory fatique. Now Hawk Sauce tastes mostly like menthol and the fruit is very dampened. I'd rather suggest changing flavours early and often.

ecr_eu,3dmf5m,frahell,3,Fri Jul 17 13:39:59 2015 UTC,True. People are also speculating that another reason of this is pretty simple: You cannot put excise tax on liquids since its not tabacco or alcohol product. SO goverment cannot banefit from vapers.

Even if this were the case (regarding taxes and such), the business that is vaping would still contribute to the economy in form of jobs, rental, currency-flow and the revenue through postal services to mention a few pros. I will not go into a full rant, but I really can't (a bit biased here) understand the stand that governments are taking around the world.

There was a small boom, an excess of shitty liquids and cigalikes in traditional tobacco stores, and it vanished as quick as it came under the impression vaping was crap. There were some small, independent vaping stores out there too, but none was ambitious enough to provide good quality, instead choosing to relabel low grade Chinese stuff for quick money.

Delta II with 0.30ohm Ni200, at 480F (this tank needs to be up there for decent performance), I get at best one 25R battery per tank of juice, about 4ml.

Its such a hard thing as YMMV but i get to about 5-6ish when I need to pop in my spare battery.  I chain vape 30 mins before I walk into the office, chain vape it for another solid hour lunch. I also have a couple of 5 min breaks and the odd cheeky vape now and again in the office! as I leave I pop in the next batt which lasts me till the end of the day.

We're actually keen to expand our range, but we are increasingly distrustful of the premium e-liquids - there are very few which can show evidence of testing, which is one reason we are developing our own range with the help of vapers like you. We do have another new range of e-liquid coming in shortly, which has been fully tested.   The same goes with hardware, allowing only hardware that meets EU guidelines and that we are confident are safe limits us a bit. For example, some of our staff use and love Vapor Shark mods, but unfortunately they are not compliant with EU regulations."

ecr_eu,3dngxu,Unlucky_Narwhal,4,Fri Jul 17 18:25:00 2015 UTC,"I had a bitch about this a few weeks ago. Calling something ""The One X"" is like saying it's the ""ultimate"" version of something (xbox ONE, for example). Given it only goes up to 36 watts, has an internal battery, is a slightly ridiculous form factor device, it's a bit of a pisstake to try suggest any such thing. There are far more appropriate names for it.  Aside from the bad name, there are numerous faults with the device, in my opinion. Including those listed above, as well as the cheap ""chrome"" bits which look like they're made of that white plastic coated in plastic chrome coloured stuff. The buttons also look naff as hell.  For the price, it's a neat little box. For the level it actually competes with (iStick territory), it should do well, provided it doesn't start exploding.  Regardless, it will probably be a reasonable device, and regardless of how cheap it might look, I imagine if you have any issues UKEcigStore will soak up the brunt of the users complaints and replace it immediately. I doubt they would sabotage their reputation, and if they do so by creating a bad product, they certainly won't follow it up with poor service...  Having said the last bit, knowing the industry to date, they will probably sabotage their reputation with a bad product and bad service, but it'd definitely be the start of their demise."

ecr_eu,3dmufe,TakeAwayKnight,2,Fri Jul 17 15:36:06 2015 UTC,I had a similar problem when I was vaping stuff like the nautilus. I'd suggest a subohm tank. The arctic tank is a good option for huge vapor production. Plus you need a new battery device with plenty of watts(MVP 3.0 Pro for example). This setup will probably cost you around 80-90 bucks but it will be well worth it. If you're vaping 12-18 mg right now you should probably tune it down to 6 or 9 mg.
ecr_eu,3dmufe,Bahnhofsviertel,2,Fri Jul 17 16:23:04 2015 UTC,"My wife wanted a setup like that so she ended up with a Coolfire 4 and a Horizon Arctic. Great little setup I steal from her sometimes if my mod is left in another room.   Costing it, we've got them both in for £50 total with some discount codes flying around our twitter that will drop it to £42.50 which is crazy cheap for that setup.  Plus the horizon now has a TC coil available if OP wanted to go into Temp Control with a tank he knows in the future (we throw them in with every tank order too)"
ecr_eu,3dmufe,vapourdepot,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:28:07 2015 UTC,"The ohm's seem to be too high, I'm sure it's either 1.6 or 1.8? To get more vapor you need something like a kanger subtank, get a 0.5 ohm and put the nicotine down to 3"
ecr_eu,3dmufe,Zylias2,4,Fri Jul 17 15:37:45 2015 UTC,The resistance doesn't really have much to do with it as it's a regulated device...  It's more the fact that the tank uses skinny wire and isn't designed for high power vaping.  The 0.5Ω coils don't work on a mvp 20w as it doesn't fire under 1Ω.
ecr_eu,3dmufe,fluffton,2,Fri Jul 17 16:53:56 2015 UTC,"Would't work with the MVP 20w, it doesn't fire below 1 ohm.  His current coil comes out around 1.2 from what I can work out  Is it the throat hit you are missing OP?"
ecr_eu,3dmufe,vapourdepot,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:41:39 2015 UTC,"Is it the throat hit you are missing OP?   No it's more the amount of vapor/time to inhale, to get the effects I want, is what I am missing."
ecr_eu,3dmufe,goldfish_of_chaos,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:21:32 2015 UTC,Have you tried higher pg juice? I've never heard of any other effect people miss except for the throat hit. You should still have some at 30pg and at 18mg you should be off your tits on nicotine so it can't be that.
ecr_eu,3dmufe,trstn,2,Fri Jul 17 16:35:12 2015 UTC,High VG for bigger clouds ;) I'd try some Max VG juice for more vapour. 8 seconds is a check of a long pull to take though
ecr_eu,3dmufe,goldfish_of_chaos,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:05:47 2015 UTC,Yea i get that but I don't see how an extra 10-15% vg is going to make his vape better. If he wants big clouds then yes I agree.
ecr_eu,3dmufe,D-Juice,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:09:50 2015 UTC,"You probably need more power. Evolv reckon a cigarette puts out 30-40w - not everyone needs that much when vaping, and some prefer more, but it's a good benchmark if volume of vapour is important to you.  You won't get much more power through a Nautilus, so battery and tank upgrade probably required. The Subox Mini kit is a good budget option but I hesitate to recommend it because they've coated the inside of the tank in those kits, so I'd get a normal Subtank and try the new vertical VOCC coils in it. The Delta II andArctic tanks are also good. Lots of choices for a battery - depends a bit whether you want in-built or swappable batteries.  The kit you have has decent resale value, and would be an excellent way to start a friend off with vaping."
ecr_eu,3dmufe,irphunky,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:49:38 2015 UTC,If you want more vapor quicker your gonna need a lower ohm coil and something with a lot of airflow.  More airflow gives you the vapour increase and lower ohm coil will increase the production.
ecr_eu,3dmufe,Coaxed_Into_A_Snafu,1 point,Sat Jul 18 08:59:23 2015 UTC,"Maybe something wrong with the coils or the airflow. I've got the new Kanger VOCC coils in an Emow Mega and I couldn't possibly chain vape at 16w. Output is actually too much for me, even on 6mg juice. It's nice to blow decent clouds though!"
ecr_eu,3dm5u6,TCMStunner,4,Fri Jul 17 11:47:04 2015 UTC,"You're in luck! Squonking has been building up massively in popularity over the last few months. In terms of options available in the EU, Svapiamo produce some beautiful, handmade wooden squonk boxes; both mechanical and regulated. M-Vapes also sell handmade squonkers that are a lot more budget friendly.   If you're willing to order from China you'll have a lot more choice. The Geyscano has been positively reviewed, I'm not sure whether 50W will suit your needs, however.  In terms of mechanical squonkers, the Smokeless Owl, Kui and Reo are all good choices."

ecr_eu,3dlowy,Benjaarh,3,Fri Jul 17 07:42:30 2015 UTC,"I find that the thicker the wire I use, the longer it will last. Also using a spaced coil rather than a contact coil will tend to gunk up slower."

A spaced 26g in my Lemo lasted 4 months and then was only rebuilt because I felt like it.  Heavy gunking juice flavours are also a factor. I have a few (some of Elements range, Coval Area 51) that can blacken a coil horribly within a day and need to throw it away within a week as dry burns and the water tap aren't enough to get the crap off."

Creamy and dessert type flavours tend to gunk the coil quicker, so a dry burn a rewick will be needed every now and then.  Juices with citric acid will eat away at you coil, I have a diy juice that uses an amount of CA that will be found back in lots of recipes and juices. You'll taste it when it's time to re-coil these.   I tend to recoil at least once a weak. Re-wicking depends on juice/topper/taste."
ecr_eu,3dlowy,sjugge,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:57:05 2015 UTC,"Dr F recommends you never dry fire a coil, essentially you're forcing it to oxidise which is more likely to release nasties than a coil that has hasn't been dry fired."

Flying in the face of all marketing opinion at the time, the booth with the engineers did far better for the company.

We try to let our batches steep as much as we possibly can, but sometimes when the demand gets insane then it has to be fresh!  /u/Mrdirtypixel I highly recommend shotting strawberry milk in a cupboard for a few weeks. That juice BLOOMS after a steep!  Will see if I can make some improvements to the mixing process, already looking into some stuff.  Also, to note OCCs mute flavour in my opinion, I have been using the 0.5occ in my subtank plus and it really heavily tones down the flavour in my nanner bear.  Give the RTA a go, should be better. The juice should go a very dark ambery orange when done!"
ecr_eu,3djnbw,NovaVapes,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:01:05 2015 UTC,"Does it actually smell of strawberry etc? In no way suggesting it's happened to Nova before, but have heard of people forgetting to add the flavour concentrates to a batch :)"

ecr_eu,3djnbw,shinitso,1 point,Fri Jul 17 06:33:13 2015 UTC,Same thing happened to me. It was certainly very annoying because I ordered it when I was running out of juice. Had to order new juice straight away. Juices that need steeping should have a big red warning on the website.
ecr_eu,3djnbw,dubcroster,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:56:00 2015 UTC,"Give a week to steep, the juice changes quite a bit, try shaking the bottle too and leaving the cap and nipple off for a few hours let some air get in there and oxidize the nicotine and flavors it might help a bit."

ecr_eu,3djmt9,Zylias2,2,Thu Jul 16 20:21:57 2015 UTC,"I had this problem too. Most likely wicks - you can have a terrible coil and still get good vape as long as the wicking is sound.   Make sure youre cutting the cotton right. You want little strips slightly smaller than the inner width of the coil. Cut the cotton the right way, when you pull the strip it should't tear easily."

ecr_eu,3diyce,Jazzy9786,4,Thu Jul 16 17:24:53 2015 UTC,"Hello Sir. I am living in the southwest (Stavanger) so I'm afraid I can't comment on Oslo. But generally it seems that people are quite ok with it. I have not gotten any negative remarks as long as I have been vaping, but quite a few questions as people tend to be curious. Vaping is not that that widely spread here (but a lot of smokers as you pointed out), and I rarely meet a fellow vaper on the streets (may be more in Oslo as it is the most populated city).  As for laws regarding use.... Well there are none to be Frank. In Norway vaping does not go under what equates to the TPD here, vaping is regulated under medical law and does not state anything about use (expect the 18 year age requirement though). As there isn't any laws regarding use that affects vaping directly, it is actually legal to vape inside public places (which is kinda ironic with all the strict laws we have here), BUT more and more public places are banning it as of late. I know I saw a chart one time over which restaurants etc. that allowed vaping, I'll edit it in if I find it.  If you're here for a longer stay, Importing is regulated however and you can see the main points in this comment<--.  Hopefully this will be of some assistance to you. Just PM me or post here if there is something else I can help you with (hopefully I will be able to). '  EDIT: I forgot to say that as a general rule, you should assume it is not allowed to vape inside public places to avoid some potensial embarrasing situations- and I am by no means an expert at law, so I may be a little bit off on some points (allthough I'm quite certain I'm in the green ;)  EDIT 2: I found the map over places that allow vaping. I have not tested it out myself, so it may be wise to ask if you were to find yourself in one of the places with a green thumb on the map. Here it is: www.dampok.no"
ecr_eu,3diyce,frahell,2,Thu Jul 16 18:02:10 2015 UTC,Thanks for the info. I'm going to be here until Wednesday and I wanted to know about any regulations.

I find that the deck is quite spacious and building on it is a breeze- I only build simple coils mind you. I wanted to try it after seeing it mentioned by several redditors here as a top 5 RDA for them (/u/DumbGecko might have mentioned it on numerous occations which made me want to try it out) ;).

It sure helped me out earlier this week when I had to wrangle my order from /u/cloudhousevapor out of customs' greedy hands. It's funny how much less aggressive they get once you phone them up, quote the law and refer to which paragraph they can read in order to do their job correctly. I even got a ""thank you"" when I hung up the phone, which kinda stumped me :D."
ecr_eu,3diyce,frahell,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:42:29 2015 UTC,Really? What happened? And what did you tell them?
ecr_eu,3diyce,clncln,4,Thu Jul 16 21:00:54 2015 UTC,"I got a letter that stated that they withheld my package until I presented proof of purchase (which is fine and within their rights), but in addition to that they demanded that I'd pay VAT and prosessing-fees which is not applicable to that particular order. So I proceeded to call the number which where included in the letter, got in contact with a nice lady in the other end, presented the tracking/case number and then asked her if she was aware the they were in fact breaking the law by demanding me to pay VAT and fees on that order. She was adament that they were within their rights, which lit a fire under my ass.... I kept her on the line while quoting the law and telling her which paragraphs to look up, which she actually did to my amazement. She was a good sport about it, and actually thanked me. So I picked it up today at my local postoffice :).  TL;DR: Recieving a unfounded ""give us money""-letter from customs is a no-go."

ecr_eu,3diyce,clncln,1 point,Sun Jul 19 10:16:31 2015 UTC,"Jeg forklarer det litt bedre i denne kommentaren. Der referer jeg også til lovverket og paragraf angående import av legemiddel til privat bruk. Jeg skriver også om beløpsgrense som du kan lese mer om her. Håper dette er til hjelp.  Edit: Obs! En viktig ting som jeg ikke har nevnt tidligere: Tollvesenet kan kreve bevis/legeattest for at e-juice kan bli fortollet og videresendt til mottaker (har ikke hendt meg enda, men de har rett til det iht. lovverket)."

ecr_eu,3dibwi,whateverisfree,2,Thu Jul 16 16:38:30 2015 UTC,Check out the sidebar. There's good vendors that are much cheaper than that.

ecr_eu,3disbh,whateverisfree,2,Thu Jul 16 16:40:26 2015 UTC,"Well, ideally you have a tank that has replacement coils and a rebuildable deck. So subtank mini perhaps?"

ecr_eu,3disbh,hapticsquid,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:09:26 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately 'airy' generally means thirstier on juice and the sort of RTAs that are in their sweet spot at lower ohms and higher power than 30W (Goblin, Cthulhu...). For a budget solution and great flavour you should consider the original Lemo (not the 2 which went more towards the sub ohm market)...single coil only, works great at 0.8 to 1ohm and 20Wish. 'Airy' is going to depend what you are used to, it may be a little tighter than the iSubG (but don't know I've not tried it) but I don't like a tight draw and I still enjoy my Lemo a lot with the airflow set wide open, even with a Cthulhu and a load of drippers in my rotation. Love the flavour from it, really brings out things in some juices that I sometimes lose in higher heat builds. it's a nice easy relaxed vape that I still turn to for a change from all my lower ohm stuff. You can pick one up for £15 in UK so should be cheap options closer to home for you"
ecr_eu,3disbh,vapourdepot,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:16:37 2015 UTC,Thanks for the tip. I just might pick up the Lemo Drop instead. It seems to be at a better price point.
ecr_eu,3disbh,vapourdepot,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:48:13 2015 UTC,"HTH. i've not tried the Drop but it's basically just the same but with a shorter glass tank section and chimney and I've heard some say the flavour is a little better in the Drop. They look very smart in black particularly if you have a black mod. One more thing, not everyone likes the long narrow drip tip,  I switched mine for a black wide bore."

Tastes as good as it sounds.   Only downsides to this line are it's all 40pg and no option to change this ratio not a problem for most people but if you have pg sensitivity you may want to avoid it.

ecr_eu,3dhg8q,fluffton,3,Thu Jul 16 08:55:00 2015 UTC,"While they are a bit heavy on the PG side, I'll always have a soft spot for EasyVapes from my early days of vaping. Affordable, with a good variation of flavours. Their 'best known' one is Brandy Nut Bridge, which everyone describes differently. For me it's coffee and caramel with a splash of liqueur. I also really like Indo Tea, it's fresh and fruity, yet has a bit of spice. They're a Dutch company, and I linked to the English versions of the pages which unfortunately don't have a lot of reviews (or any, even :P). As I said, heavy on the PG, which I moved away from a bit since I moved on from the clearos, but I'll still fill up a tank with Brandy Nut Bridge every once in a while (stocked up on it when the sale of bottles >10ml got banned here), and just typing about Indo Tea makes me want to order a bottle, but I ordered so much juice in the last couple of weeks that I really shouldn't...  Edit: fixing some links, hopefully"
ecr_eu,3dhg8q,hmm_banang,3,Thu Jul 16 09:57:50 2015 UTC,"yea, He should do a high vg line.. I liked them when in started vaping but needed higher pg pretty soon.  pinging /u/easybizz"
ecr_eu,3dhg8q,vonck7,2,Thu Jul 16 15:01:34 2015 UTC,"You rang?? :)   Yes, high VG is a question I often get and one I fully understand. But I've kept our PG at 75% for multiple reasons.  First, high PG juice works in all products (including starter kits, cartomizers and older clearomizers).  Because Holland is fucked on big devices we need to take extra care of the customers that use small (often not as advanced) devices that don't handle high VG all that well. Because of the new law, we can't cater to high-end users anymore as a one stop shop (witch I get mad about every fucking day) so they have stopped being our target audience.  Second, it takes a lot of time, effort and money to keep the line going as it is (mainly because of the new laws). Repackaging every bottle with more expensive labels and instructions/warning manuals to comply with the new rules and 3 times the effort on filling because of the 10 ml limit has took a toll on us in a BIG way. Keeping as much of the line standardized is a mayor cost effective way of production.  We do appreciate the love we get from our regular/old customers (mostly high-end users now). They have stuck and struggled with us and see that we are fighting for them as well as ourselves. So we're trying our hardest to bring something to the table for them again, but now it's just a matter of staying alive que BeeGees in a dying market."

I taste mint, menthol, and some amount of creamy custardy stuff. I also taste bubblegum and fanta fruit twist.  At £13 for 20ml, it's by no definition cheap.

ecr_eu,3ddl0m,shelleyftw,2,Wed Jul 15 13:02:28 2015 UTC,"Great review and nice to see a fresh take on things.   My wife has a Amethyst (Pink) one she uses every day that gets dumped in her handbag.  Its survived without many marks at all, and the finish is still quite good on it. Its even had a tank full of liquid dumped on/in it a couple of times and came out with no issues.   I know there have been a handful of reports of auto-firing, but thankfully Innokin have been very forward in wanting to resolve it and I'm going to guess by the number sold this is a very very small quantity (but major props to them for dealing with it correctly!)  Maybe a quick wipe with something on the badge will brighten it up?"
ecr_eu,3ddl0m,vapourdepot,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:11:12 2015 UTC,"I have seen many people say that the finish is all good and no problems. But there has a been a couple of reports of the same issue.   I think personally it's down to it being in my pocket most of the time, so it's rubbing on the inside of the pocket.   Completely agree Innokin sorting out problem very quickly and being honest about everything. They are always wanting to improve their products and are really willing to listen to the public about their devices.   I have tried some Polish and other things.

ecr_eu,3ddl0m,fluffton,2,Fri Jul 17 11:19:21 2015 UTC,I've spent the last few months bringing my power levels down and I'm now happy vaping between 20-40w on either mech or regulated.  Recently picked up a cool fire and I'm really impressed with it. Usual top fit and finish I expect from innokin.   Seen a few cases of auto fire but they are very few and far between and innokin are on top of fixing the problem and sorting out their customers with issues.   The screen showing voltage and resistance to 0.00 is very nice as well as being able to check the actual voltage by pressing and holding the +/- buttons.   The slide switch on the bottom is also a much better lock than the click system. Sure you can click it off and the switch it off for total security but I leave the click lock unlocked and the switch on the bottom as a lock which has zero delay between being unlocked and being able to fire the coil.  Would be nice to have a bigger capacity but it still gets me through work twice before needing a charge. If it was all I used for a day I think it would just about last all day for me.   As for the changing wattage again I like this. I don't change power too often only when throwing on a new build so having it lock is handy for me.
ecr_eu,3ddl0m,XPostLinker,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:50:06 2015 UTC,"I like the + and - being locked. On other mods, I have found that it can change in my pocket and cause it set to stupidly high and the causing me to burn out the coil.   I like the battery, and because it auto shuts it's self off when it reaches full capacity it means I can get it it on charge over night."
ecr_eu,3ddl0m,Dumbgecko,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:15:56 2015 UTC,Yea I love this thing. Great little pocket friendly mod for beginner or advanced users. Inokin really hit the nail on the head with this one. :)

I'm thinking of either making them look a bit ""chibi"" to go with the small character theme, or just make them actual 8-bit. Then again, if I went for the latter, because most 8-bit stuff uses a simplistic colour palette, I'd be worried about falling into the copyright trap again."

But, most importantly, it'll also make sure you don't give vaping a bad name when you blow something/yourself up because you didn't know that you were doing something you shouldn't.    FWIW, I would recommend that you do not buy an iStick as they're known to have severe problems and eleaf have not responded in a respectable manner. This includes mine which was an authentic device.

For shame, eleaf. They seemed to have removed that, though, probably because it's totally false.  They seem to be heavily skewed towards 50w devices, however I've seen reports of 30w problems, too.

Sadly the only solutions i can propose are those that involve dicking around - i completely switched from OCC coils to an RBA, and if i really want to use OCC coils i rewick them myself.  I have the same RBA coil that came in with the Subtank unit, all i did was add the cotton and it works marvellous and i cant remember when was the last time i got a dry hit. I strongly encourage you try it.  I personally believe OCC coils for these units are just a waste of time as they are a complete hit or miss, and believe me i have went through two Subtank units and about 20 OCC coils and quite honestly there is more bullshit involved in buying tons of those and constantly changing them than with the RBA. I strongly reccommend you give it a whirl."

ecr_eu,3ddk09,blazemore,2,Wed Jul 15 16:05:54 2015 UTC,"Cut a sliver just wider than the coil. Pull it in half. Twist an end to pull it through. Tug it back and forward so there's a little resistance but not too much. Point the ends up and put the chimney on. Cut the wick ends level with the chimney. Poke the ends down so they cover the holes. Job done.   It may take a couple of goes to get the thickness of the wick right. Remember, not too tight because it'll expand when wet."
ecr_eu,3ddk09,Mrdirtypixel,2,Wed Jul 15 22:15:14 2015 UTC,"Cheers for that. I noticed they also had a little pictorial guide in the tiny booklet that came in the box too.   I ended up trying out the rba base a little earlier and I've still got it in now but I think I've messed up the cotton install as I got a couple of dry hits.   I've dropped down to 15w to see if it helps (was at 18w) but I think I just need to redo the cotton again as it feels like too tight a draw even with the air intake holes on their fullest open.   Was pretty painless installing it though, thanks for the help.   Just need to perfect that cotton wicking bit now."

I switched to the RBA and never looked back. Now I recently purchased a second tank and tried the 0.5 ohm OCC and it works like a dream with no tampering. Made sure it was fully soaked left in the tank and took a few pulls from it with firing and it's been fine.   I have it on the widest airflow and take direct to lung hits.

Definitely didn't expect  it to be as floral as it is, so my first puff of it took me a bit off guard.

ecr_eu,3dbv20,not_mr_Lebowski,7,Wed Jul 15 01:41:15 2015 UTC,"I would say the current 'top contenders' are:  Goblin Mini - Might not be suitable for your needs given the juice capacity (3ml). Bottom fill only. Very new to the market, but initial reports are quite promising). Has bottom airflow and doesn't allow you to access your build without draining your tank, unfortunately.   Billow 2 - Allows access to your coils without draining your tank. 22mm at the base, but 23 mm around the tank (as they wanted to keep the juice capacity at 5ml), 'bulge' might bother some. Wider airflow options over the original Billow.  Lemo 2 - If you want to stick to single coil only, this and the subtank (with the RBA section) are probably the best budget single coil RTAs on the market. Less juice capacity (3.8ml) than the original Lemo, but now has top fill. The airflow is now adjustable without unscrewing the atty.   Goliath V2 - Single and dual coil options (with the addition of an included 'plug'), compatible with stock Zephyrus coils as well as a dedicated RBA section, juice control (allowing access to your coil without draining the tank and sealing to prevent leakage). 5ml juice capacity.  Zephyrus - Marketed as a 'subohm' clearo, but has similar features to the Goliath V2 with the inclusion of an RBA section. Top-fill, wide airflow (especially on the RBA section). 5ml juice capacity.  Cthulhu - A fan favourite; great dual coil RTA. Top fill, 4ml juice capacity. A v2 is in the works.  Aspire Triton - According to Aspire's marketing spiel, this has the most versatile airflow control on the market. Top fill, includes an RBA section. 3.5ml capacity.   Hope this helps with your decision!"

When I'm working at home, RBAs are great, and cost saving, but sometimes if I'm on a shoot - I'll pull a 100 hour week, and really don't have time to rebuild. Be nice to have the best of both worlds.  I like the idea of being able to buy some extra RBA bases too, and then pre making them in downtime to have them on hand when times get busy."
ecr_eu,3dbv20,dnaq,2,Wed Jul 15 16:22:53 2015 UTC,"The Subtank is still an excellent choice, it's not quite as versatile as the Zephyrus or the Goliath v2 (with its single and dual coil modes) which also have RBA decks and OCCs. The RBA heads for the Subtank are widely available though (whilst I don't think you can buy spare RBA sections for the Zephyrus or the Goliath V2 yet).   If I was in your position, I'd probably go for the Goliath V2. It shares many similar features with the Subtank, but looks a little more 'substantial', and the RBA section has options for both single and dual coil. It also has juice flow control which might be useful for preventing leaks if you're traveling."

But.... You could get the 1.2ohm coils instead (or wrap higher in the rba). Flavour/nic will be the same and the clouds will be marginally smaller but.... you'll probably half your daily juice consumption."

ecr_eu,3d8o3s,frahell,6,Thu Jul 16 10:30:56 2015 UTC,"Not sure i can trust this review. I've got into the novavapes hype train and bought 3 juices: Rainbow Dust, Grahams Custard and Strawberry Milk. My vape setup is Subox mini kit with RBA vaping at around 20watts. My order got stuck in mail and i got it 2 weeks after ordering so i think steeping is not the issue.  First juice i tried was Rainbow Dust.   Taste: If you like your vape sweet, you'll probably like this juice. The inhale is overpowering blend of fruits with a very candylike character, very sweet but also very full bodied. The exhale is mix of sweet, soft and fruit. It does taste like rainbow sherbet, but it has a warmer character to it. Tasty, but a little too sweet for an all-day-vape!   My review: this juice had almost no taste. Seriously. You could barely feel anything.  Next one was Grahams Custard.   Taste: Grahams Custard... where do I begin? It's thick, it's creamy, it's bloody beautiful. The inhale is a thick and creamy mess of custard with a slight herbal note, that would be the Golden Grahams. Now personally I don't like to eat Golden Grahams, but this is a nice vape. It's very full and very moreish. The exhale is a sticky mess of custard and Golden Grahams that lingers on the tongue for quite a few minutes. Delicious!   My review: If i would try to create a juice that tastes like puke then this would probably the taste that i would come up with. Seriously. No amount of coffee will cover this taste.  I didn't even open the 3rd one.  The batch number was RB09 so it was not mentioned in the recall that they had.   Now I'm pretty sure that you guys will downvote me into oblivion for sharing my experience. I've bought the stuff together with a friend and he had similar impression, that these juices have no taste in them.   What am I doing wrong?"
ecr_eu,3d8o3s,frahell,5,Tue Jul 14 15:01:18 2015 UTC,It could be batch inconsistency or just personal taste? /u/novavapes may be able to help
ecr_eu,3d8o3s,NovaVapes,3,Tue Jul 14 15:10:47 2015 UTC,"So because you apparently had a bad experience, I'm not trustworthy?  Ever stop to think that taste is subjective? Or that it might have been your setup? Or that it may just be juice that isn't for you?"
ecr_eu,3d8o3s,sjugge,3,Tue Jul 14 15:18:17 2015 UTC,"Please don't take it personal. I'm just sharing my experience. My reply was not towards you, but rather towards /u/novavapes.   I've re-read this topic: https://www.reddit.com/r/ecr_eu/comments/3cc6y6/anyone_get_novavapes_tropical_glacier_today_also/ Could it happen, that RB09 batch was also affected?"
ecr_eu,3d8o3s,NovaVapes,4,Tue Jul 14 15:27:23 2015 UTC,"You literally start your comment with:     Not sure i can trust this review.     It would be hard to take that not a little personal I feel. That said, I think that there might be some sort of QC issue going on, because if anything I think that Rainbow Dust might just be a little too intense for its own good at times. So seeing it described as having almost no taste is the last thing I would expect. Haven't tried Grahams Custard yet, so I can't say if it could be described in shades of vomit, but it certainly doesn't smell like it. Hope you and /u/novavapes can get to the bottom of this."
ecr_eu,3d8o3s,NovaVapes,3,Tue Jul 14 18:02:18 2015 UTC,"There was a QC issue with RB10 RB11 and RB12 (i think) of tropical glacier, and we have had only a handful of issues with sour fruit crush.  Since the QC issue I have personally been overlooking all mixes again.  Batches RB01 - RB09 and RB13 onwards should as far as I am aware have no QC issues.  Rainbow dust is its own character... basically marmite. Love it or hate it, this point is orchistrated quite well in /u/MarlDaeSu's review.  Point in rainbow dust is a different vape, everyone has cereals, custards, milks, fruits, menthols, etc. Nice change, I couldnt personally vape it all day but I usually have a bottle with higher nic for them more stressfull periods!  Graham's custard wont ever taste or smell like vomit, thats kinda really REALLY far away from it's flavour!  If you tell me the batch number I should be able to pull a bottle of it out of somewhere and take a look, see if we are having the same experience and I can refer to the notes on that batch!"
ecr_eu,3d8o3s,NovaVapes,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:36:14 2015 UTC,"I personally have no issues with what I've tasted so far (except for the mintless Tropical Glacier, but a new bottle of that should be underway I hope ). My comment regarding QC issues was because I experienced Rainbow Dust as quite intense (not necessarily a bad thing), while /u/jarosan described it as having almost no taste. Taste is subjective and all, but that wide a divide seemed unlikely to me without something else going on. Maybe I'm wrong though. My whole samplepack is batch RB10, but as I said, no further issues so far. Reading the thread though, my only worry at this point is that I'll get the fresh bottle of Tropical Glacier in and it turns out my Sour Fruit Crush was a mislabeled Tropical Glacier all along, that would be just my luck :P."
ecr_eu,3d8o3s,Jimmith,5,Tue Jul 14 20:14:12 2015 UTC,Hi!  Very sorry about your bad experience with our juice! RB09 was not part of the recall and this is pretty much the first issue we have had with this batch as far as I am aware.   Would you be able to send the juices back so I can investigate further?

Now for what it's worth, everything I received was from batch RB10 which did have some issues but didn't ""taste like puke"". In fact Grahams Custard was quite tasty, and tasted a lot like Golden Grahams."

ecr_eu,3da1hq,VonBubenberg,3,Tue Jul 14 17:48:44 2015 UTC,"I see where you're coming from. You like the simplicity and discretion of the basic setup you have right now, and you want to keep it that way. I have an egrip and it's my favorite device. It's small, discreet and works great. I just ordered an OLED version too, knowing exactly the battery level is a plus. Make sure you get an RBA base since it makes the device 100 times better. The default coils suck (imo) but with this flavor and vapor are awesome. If you don't like building, coils like these are available. I use them and they're great and super convenient.   If you can get a 20w OLED version and it's cheaper than the 30w, get one, you can upgrade your 20w by clicking 30 times on the button while it's off. Also, there's a new base coming out that takes ego One coils and the ego One rebuildable head.  So very customizable, super good vape and very tiny; you'll love it. I haven't experienced any leaking with the RBA base, just make sure you don't use acidic/tank cracking juices as they'll eat through the insulator and break it, leading to leaking and shorting. If you have any questions still about the egrip, ask away :)"
ecr_eu,3da1hq,MolonColon,3,Tue Jul 14 18:11:37 2015 UTC,Thank you for your reply! I think that I'll order an eGrip OLED device plus the RBA base! How difficult is the cleaning process of said device? How frequently should I clean it?
ecr_eu,3da1hq,VonBubenberg_mobile,2,Tue Jul 14 19:12:28 2015 UTC,"You're welcome, I'm sure you'll love it! Cleaning is the tricky part. I keep my flavor profiles in the menthol/fruit range as to not have to much hassle, but you can clean it by squirting some water in the reservoir, plugging the holes with the index and thumb and shaking 3-4 times. Then just plug the hole at the base with some paper towel and put the device upright so the excess water can be absorbed after emptying. after 5-10 minutes you can screw in the base and put a new juice :) The RBA base is easier to clean, just take the cotton out and rinse it under the tap then dry.  Unless you use pungent juices or change flavors very often, you won't need to do this often. I normally do it once every two months, a routine cleaning."
ecr_eu,3da1hq,MolonColon,2,Tue Jul 14 19:20:56 2015 UTC,"Ok, sounds pretty straightforward. I am a fan of tobacco/menthol liquids :) thank you for your help! I'm going to compare the Kangertech Sunox with the eGrip, as far as you guys opinions go, both are good devices!"
ecr_eu,3da1hq,VonBubenberg_mobile,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:29:10 2015 UTC,"The subox is a very solid choice too, just not in the same league.

ecr_eu,3da1hq,MolonColon,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:50:16 2015 UTC,"Ok, I just ordered the eGrip and the RBA base from the exact site you linked. I'm really excited! What kind of brands for liquids can you recommend? Until now, I always bought them here: Click"

I've always been very fond of cloudhousevapor, usually I just order DIY concentrates to last me a couple months plus one or two bottles to try, awesome shop and a large choice. The RBA base works well even with 30/70VG juice so you have a large range to choose from. Another juice vendor I like is vapeboy, tropical disaster and peach republic are some of the best juices I ever got, as are the ones from Liquid Voyage, Peaches and Cream and StrawPearDew are my faves. Just look around the sub, there's a good list of vendors and everyone here will recommend their prefered vendors :)"

ecr_eu,3da1hq,MolonColon,2,Wed Jul 15 09:54:53 2015 UTC,"It's true that the current RBA base is a bit finicky and requires a bit of practice biut with the premade coils it's a piece of cake.

ecr_eu,3da1hq,EH-live,3,Tue Jul 14 18:56:45 2015 UTC,"For that budget you can get a really good device. The new Kangertech Subox kit should be a solid choice, as it includes the Kbox mini and Subtank mini. It has interchangeable battery, so you can easily change it to new one. It comes with 2 atomizer heads and RBA section so you can build your own coils. And you can use different atomizers on it."
ecr_eu,3da1hq,metans,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:13:30 2015 UTC,"Note: the newest design features a spring loaded pin so will work with pretty much every 510 threaded atomiser out there, the first gen of suboxes only has a fixed pin so you need to be certain that the positive contact pin on the atomiser is long enough to make contact. Not certain if the new version with spring loaded pin has been released yet."
ecr_eu,3da1hq,hmm_banang,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:00:44 2015 UTC,"I've been tempted to get an eGrip on multiple occasions, just such a slick device. And most of what I've read has been fairly positive, especially once people got the RBA base. Downsides I've seen is that it's a bit hard to clean, and the airflow control isn't great. Main reason I haven't bought one is that I quite like the modularity of my mech- and box mods and different atomizers. Another reason is that I like the ability to change batteries. With the amount of different things for different needs for vaping, it's sort of hard to recommend something without a bit more info, so for now I'll just say that the eGrip is solid as far as I know."

ecr_eu,3d9k32,crowdome,2,Tue Jul 14 15:48:02 2015 UTC,Juice drinking just depends on the build no? I'd go for another subtank (new one with updated RBA section) or a Cthulhu :)

ecr_eu,3d4y50,CitizenSmif,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:02:34 2015 UTC,"The concentrates are 10ml. If you have 100ml already, then you'd need 11ml of concentrate to mix at 10%.  I wouldn't put too much concern on a couple of percent though, throw 1 10ml bottle of any those (8-15% are the suggestions) into that 100ml and you'll be alright. I used to mix 70ml bottles of MBV which was supposed to be mixed 20% and it always came out fine if not a little weak"
ecr_eu,3d4y50,smallfaces,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:10:05 2015 UTC,Thank you. That actually makes a lot of sense

ecr_eu,3d4y50,itchyear,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:15:05 2015 UTC,"Thank you.   I ordered 2 10ml bottles. So even though I'll be adding them at 10%, they should still be alright?   I'm guessing adding 10ml will make my mix 75/25 vg/pg if it is 85/15 now?"
ecr_eu,3d4y50,iliketohideincloset,2,Mon Jul 13 19:43:45 2015 UTC,"Do you have two 100ml bottles? If so, yes. If I didn't have a bit of extra cash this month I'd have stretched them about that far myself. If you want to get it truer to the actual percentage advertised by Vapeboy then remove some of your PG/VG mix. I.E if you bought one that mixes at 15% then remove 35ml from your mix and add the 10ml concentrate. That'd be 75ml mixed at 15%.  Regarding the new ratio, not quite, not sure of the exact percentage (perhaps someone else will calculate?) but the PG ratio will be slightly higher."

ecr_eu,3d405c,Sidebard,2,Mon Jul 13 16:32:39 2015 UTC,"Hello there guys and gals,  I just wanted to tell you about a Vendor which proved to have excellent customer service: Liquid Schmiede from Germany. I mentioned that vendor before in a thread somewhere, its the one where you can either let your own juiced be mixed or buy other peoples recipes.  Anyway, here is the story: My first order I screwed up: I entered my old adress and the packet never had a chance to get delivered. When I got the message that after about 3 weeks the packet was back at their shop again, I was a bit annoyed with them.... until it turned out that I had given them the wrong shipping adress.  They were super nice about it and just sent it again to my correct adress.  When it finally got here I noticed that one juice, called Philberry, was just menthol w/o the strawberry flavour.  I just dropped them a note mentioning this, not expecting anything in return, just to give them a heads up that their mixing table system (can be found on youtube) might have some bug.  they reacted and said they'd send me the whole order again, cost free.  They sent it to the original adress...which was, of course, the wrong one. When I mentioned this, they said: no problem, when it gets delievered back to us we will send it again to your right adress.  Inbetween I made another purchase with them and asked wether my package had come back again. They said no, it seems it was lost. So they made that same order the third time and sent it out to my real adress, again completely free of charge. It arrived last week.  I can only imagine that they are a bit annoyed with me, but goddamn it, that was just awesome customer service and people should know about it.  I was a first time customer who made nothing but troubles but they came through for me big time.  anyway, give them a try, they seem to be really nice guys and Philberry and Philnana are really nice juices! Its also great if you wanna try your hand at combining flavourings before getting the actual ingredients :)"
ecr_eu,3d405c,sjugge,3,Mon Jul 13 16:57:28 2015 UTC,"I can only assume you moved after giving me your address. Well played.   /silyness   Never heard of said vendor but good to hear that there's a EU site that allows recipes being made. Do they support tools like ELR?  Anywhoo.

And people say I am not good with money, lol.   I am not sure what tools like ELR are, I am just an amateur at DIY stuff.   You can, say, choose blueberrys (high), strawberries (middle) and mint (low strentgh) and a choice of how ""rounded"" the taste should be (not sure what they do with rounding) and they'll mix a 10 ml bottle for 4 euros. I think they only do 50/40/10 ratios, but I am not sure. It's a nice way to play with flavorings w/o buying too much stuff guessing.  you can also see the top selling recipes of others and they carry the ""philgood"" liquid line (thats a prominent swiss/german youtuber/reviewer)."

But last week I'm fairly certain I mentioned that I'd gotten some juices from Toscana Mall and how it was my first time choosing max VG. Well, over the course of this week I've actually gone through right about 120ml (that's crazy for me...) and been enjoying it for the most part.  The only flavor I have some left of is called Banana Cream. And it's not even that I don't like it. Actually it has grown upon me. I didn't quite enjoy it in my iSub G, but it works quite nicely in my iClear 30S (this liquid is quite diluted with distilled water and therefore works very well in a clearomizer.)  I had quite the selection of flavors and all but one showed up. Unfortunately my Blueberry juice was not included for whatever reason. But TM stepped up and gave me a voucher for the amount I paid for that bottle so I might order another bottle of Energy Drink, which to me didn't taste so much like an energy drink, but rather a bubble gum called Hubba Bubba that I used to have on ocassion as a child. So that was a cool flavor in my humble opinion.  This week I ordered a lot of things. I ordered the tools I found necessary for rebuilding since I do have a dripper. I figured if I'm gonna be trying different juices might as well be doing it the right way, right? I've also ordered around 250ml of e-liquid from varying vendors. /u/vapourdepot being one of those. Looking forward to trying your pear flavor! :)  Spent quite a bit of money on vaping this week, but hopefully it'll all be worth it at the end of the day. Next month I'm planning to get myself some MBV concentrates and VG base from Cloud House Vapor. Looking forward to trying my luck with that stuff.   To me, vaping is about knocking a bad habit (for me it was snus more so than smoking, though I did both of them) and as I'm typing I'm doing neither of those, just vaping away.  Tomorrow I just might also get my first regulated box mod shipped to me, which I look forward to. Unfortunately it's just an iStick 30W, but everyone has to start somewhere and I am on quite the budget. Can't go spending 200€ on a Mini Class M or anything fancy like that. Though the 40WTC from Eleaf appeared 2 days after I put my order in on the sotre where I usually order things, so that was really unfortunate. But hey, maybe I'll be able to justify getting it down the road. Or hopefully an even better device! :)  That's enough of a wall. Sorry for the long post, just really excited about what has happened over the course of this week and what is to come over the course of this coming week. A great week to you all!"

I did, and now coming up two weeks later it's status is still undelivered. When I asked them if they had any more information - had their recent move in premises affected this, could it have simply not been logged, could they ask if they had any delivered mail at the post office or something - I was met with some of the coldest, disinterested and completely unsympathetic responses I've ever encountered in my life. Seems they're quite pleased with having sold off a faulty unit and it having gone missing without them having to actually replace it. I'm down a hundred and five quid now with the maximum claim for a lost item on Recorded Delivery being 50 quid (and I can only begin the process in another week or so). Not so much as a sympathetic ""we're sorry this happened to you"" and zero acknowledgement of the fact this only happened because they sent me a dud item.  Never again."

Granted, the loss was really Royal Mail's fault and not really anything to do with Grey Haze, but I'd have felt a lot better if I was met by anything other than a cold, disinterested ""we'll only talk to you once we've received it and signed for it."" Feels like I've already gotten better customer service from yourself acknowledging this post than I had from them!  I mean, there's going the extra mile, but then there's sitting on your ass at home; I've made the mistake of recommending them to a few people online after a made one hassle free RDA purchase from them..

Also, this may be applicable:   We make every effort to make sure your mail arrives safely, so we'll keep it for 18 days. After this, items will be returned to the sender's address on the external cover of the envelope or packet. Contact the sender of the item to see if it has been returned. Where no external return address is provided and the letter does not have a Printed Postage Impression or franking mark, the item will be forwarded to the National Returns Centre in Belfast and opened to identify a sender.

My experience was not as bad as yours but when i rang them to inquire about an order i had placed online (i hadn't received a conformation email and it was now more than 24 hours later) they were borderline rude to me on the phone and acted as if i didn't know anything and was a complete fool/time-waster for asking. In the B&M  in Nottingham the guy behind the counter hardly spoke to me and spent the entire time either talking on his mobile or texting someone. It just felt really awkward, as if i was annoying him simply by coming into the store on a Wednesday afternoon."

I've accidentally dropped it atleast 5 times from around 2 meters, and each time it's barely got a scratch. The rear panel has fallen off (I only rely on the magnets, I think I've lost the screws already) and the batteries have fallen out. Pop it all back together, works just fine after a year of every day use. Reminds me of the old Nokia 3310 :D"
ecr_eu,3d4cf9,pannamix,2,Mon Jul 13 17:04:50 2015 UTC,"The TC is giving me headaches - I can't seem to build anything on my Derringer or Mutation X with remotely the flavour I get from even my SubTank. And no matter what, it never really seems to like going over 1.5V.  You're right about the packaging and build quality though, it's a really nice little device. Battery life is a little on the short side, but it's about what you might expect from a 75W single battery TC device."

ecr_eu,3d4cf9,PM_ME_YOUR_POGS,2,Mon Jul 13 13:40:33 2015 UTC,"When you're firing, do you ever go above 1.5v? What settings do you run on? No issues with flavour at all?"
ecr_eu,3d4cf9,pannamix,1 point,Mon Jul 13 13:57:06 2015 UTC,"Yes my voltage jumps around quite a lot.   I run a 0.17ohm resistance locked nickel coil in a smok TCT. Voltage is generally from 1.1v to 3.7v. 50w at 200 degrees.   Flavour is fantastic, by far the best tank I've tried (I've tried the subtank, Atlantis, hercules, sigelei elite) and dark horse and mutation x v4 rda.   Are you locking the resistance of your coil? If it's reading high you need to press the resistance lock (down then power button) many times until it stops moving down. It occasionally goes up but keep trying.   My coil first read 0.34ohms but with repeated locking I got it down to 0.17ohms. I just tried it again and got it to 0.16"
ecr_eu,3d4cf9,crowdome,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:04:10 2015 UTC,"Interesting. I've never seen my voltage go above 1.5v so I'm confident that's the reason for no flavour - I wasn't sure if maybe it was supposed to stay super low due to the small resistance.  Most of my coils are reading somewhere between 0.1 and 0.14 ohms. I might give repeatedly locking it a go though, in case it's supposed to be smaller."
ecr_eu,3d4cf9,pannamix,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:08:18 2015 UTC,I just upped mine to 300 degrees at 50w and I'm seeing voltages in excess of 4.5v

ecr_eu,3d4cf9,pannamix,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:36:11 2015 UTC,"Yea it's a brilliant device but it is single battery, so if you're planning on running it at 70/75w my .2ohms would be to either get the sigelei 150w TC that's out soon or wait for the cloudmaker. Simply because they're dual battery so it'll last longer. I'm using a tank on this device and it'll last all day. (approx 12ml so far but haven't really had a long enough time to test it properly)"

I wondered does it show the battery in % or just in bars? does it do Titanium as well as nickel? and finally those double doors, are the magnets strong enough both sides?  EDIT: what about dimensions? seems kinda bulky compared to the IPV D2"
ecr_eu,3d4cf9,DoorsUK,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:52:27 2015 UTC,"It shows bars which is actually my only gripe with it. It only does nickel. Magnets are strong enough imo.

ecr_eu,3d4cf9,PM_ME_YOUR_POGS,2,Mon Jul 13 16:11:40 2015 UTC,"I'm honestly not sure if I'm just completely rubbish or I'm expecting way too much.. or maybe TC just isn't for me.  The best luck I've had yet was using it this morning - I got reasonable clouds, but only faint flavour. I honestly have no idea what I could possibly be doing wrong by this point - 10 wraps, 28g tempered nickel wrapped around a screw, evenly spaced, no overly long legs or close contacts, decent wicking that just touches the deck. Everything should be completely fine, but it always just seems like it's really, really muted in flavour; I knew it wasn't going to be as hot or dense as running my Mutation X with dual parallel kanthal coils at 75w but I really expected more than permanently sitting at 1.5v, weak flavour and double figures of ml's of wasted juice in saturating new wicks after trashing another coil."

ecr_eu,3d3vl3,deerfaced,3,Mon Jul 13 08:50:28 2015 UTC,"If your order from Flavour Lab was recent, I wouldn't let their shipping times put you off; German post has been on strike recently and there have been huge delays.   Kind Juice is another option if you're into the whole 'organic PG/VG/flavourings' idea. I tested their range recently, they all had a fairly accurate taste, but there was an odd astringency/bitterness to a number of them. I have a bottle of their 'Teacher's Pet', it's a very accurate tart apple flavour, an English garden variety, the type you're more likely to use for cooking than eating raw. They also have a range of NETs (Naturally Extracted Tobaccos) if tobacco flavours are your steeze.   I think a lot of this Organic PG/VG is snake oil to be completely honest though. Unless they're using flavours they've extracted themselves (as Flavour Lab does) then there will always be a small amount of PG/VG in the mix that is unlikely to be organic (unless the flavour manufacturer they are using bases their flavours in organic PG/VG themselves)."

ecr_eu,3d3pwt,Daemorth,3,Mon Jul 13 08:13:32 2015 UTC,"you stick the cutout into a random page of the book to hold it into place, a bookshop I used to order from years ago provided nearly identical ones.   Tho usually you'd have variations in the cutout position so that the bit that sticks out at the top still shows some text or a logo, so it advertises even if your book's closed. ft seems to have missed that opportunity.   Edit: Seems too perfect for this to be a coincidence."
ecr_eu,3d3pwt,Daemorth,1 point,Mon Jul 13 08:30:06 2015 UTC,"If they are in fact bookmarks, they did indeed missed an opportunity there. Now the question is, why the heck would FT make bookmarks? I mean... there's no link between bookmarks and vapegear. Except both are cheap I guess."
ecr_eu,3d3pwt,BOZGBOZG,2,Mon Jul 13 08:47:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah that was my first thought when I got one, but then I realised exactly why.  I received a couple of parcels that day, from amazon, ebay and ft. I had a book lying open, so promptly put in the bookmark to open my other parcels. The amazon box had a couple of big expensive looking flyers in it for wine and diapers. The ebay one had a business card  'please leave 5* feedback' one. They all went straight back in the box/envelope and into the bin. I still have the FT one.   Now, not many people will be seeing my bookmarks, but far as advertising goes, it's pretty effective. So long as it's even slightly useful you'll be a lot more likely to keep it."
ecr_eu,3d3pwt,Dumbgecko,2,Mon Jul 13 08:57:09 2015 UTC,"valid point. I'm a page folder myself so I don't really use bookmarks of any sort.  edit: I should explain a bit more before I end up empaled, pitchforked, burned and banned :p ... I have an extensive education in graphics, print, embellishment, hand crafting books as well as +10 years under my belt in the printing industry. I have quite a bit of respected for any form of valuable printwork. Especially books and vinyl, I do own a few that I regards and preserve as a treasure. But yeah, I do fold pages as a matter of bookmark. Only in books I own and know I will be keeping and only in paperbacks. It makes them my own, and because of the sub-par quality I think it is justified. I also think that bookmarks are potentially more of an evil than they should be; they kan damage edges of the paper, messing with strength and integrity of the paper, they can break the back of a book or even fade onto the paper or leave an imprint.

ecr_eu,3d3ux5,trstn,1 point,Mon Jul 13 09:21:22 2015 UTC,"No clue what the post guys are referring to.   My story short: Ordered multiple times liquids from shops with no problem, ordered lenola cream via kite in cloud and a shipping forwarder (Austrian Post) - so they want to know thoroughly what they forward.  First they declared it as ""Olive oil"" -> restricted, can not be transported.  I told them it is e-liquid + a blog post from the TSA that e-liquid is no problem in a plane. Their response was ""sorry, e-liquid has recently been forbidden for export, as well as everything with artifical flavors""   = WTF?"
ecr_eu,3d3ux5,Frisky_Frogs,1 point,Mon Jul 13 09:31:00 2015 UTC,Could it be an issue with the shipping t?  We've got a few hundred bottle order on the way from the US and there's been no questions so far.
ecr_eu,3d3ux5,tonyleeb,1 point,Mon Jul 13 09:34:32 2015 UTC,I am sure the shipping company (Austrian Post) is the problem. I have no clue what they are doing.  Ordering directly at a liquid shop = no problem Ordering via mail forwarder = not allowed for whatever reason.  edit: got another mail that they investigate this further and they said again that they just received an update about export restrictions...

ecr_eu,3czxjh,OhCmonMan,6,Sun Jul 12 08:32:30 2015 UTC,"When should you recycle your 18650 battery?  In the world of rechargeable batteries, the lithium ion type last longer than most. Most 18650 cells are rated for between 300 and 500 cycles. That means your cell can charge up to 4.2 volts, and discharge down to 2.5 - 2.8 volts, a maximum of 300 to 500 times without too much much loss in performance. When an 18650 cell nears the end of its life, the performance loss is sudden and fast.   You can read more about this here."

ecr_eu,3czxjh,Bahnhofsviertel,2,Mon Jul 13 14:23:17 2015 UTC,I've been asking myself the same thing. Just some thoughts:  I specifically bought the xtar-vc4-charger because it shows with how much mAh they have been charged. Unfortunately I still see not much difference in charging between my 1 1/4 year old VTC5 and my half yeah old Samsung 25R. They all still charge with about 2200 mAh. Apparently how much mAh you charge doesn't really related to how much energy they store. Maybe the additional energy is lost?   Ideally you'd have a joule or watt hour display in your mod. It would be easy to implement. It shows you precisely how much energy your batteries still store. So far only the SX350 J has that feature. The Whiteout OS will most likely get the same feature with the open source firmware.   So my guess is use them until they are just too crappy to use.
ecr_eu,3czxjh,FarkMcBark,1 point,Sun Jul 12 13:00:50 2015 UTC,I would look to replace batteries every 6 months.  I hit them hard so they need to be charged a lot. Sometimes 3 times a day.  I like to keep a pack of smurfs to switch to if I get a failure. Also useful if you use unregulated mods and sub ohm. No venting so far but I'd rather be covered should I do something stupid.

I'd never do it because I've never stolen in my life.   But there were times at certain booths that just had alllllll the juice lines laid out on the table, and only 2 members of staff swamped by all the customers, that I just thought ""jeez, it would be so easy to just put some of those in your pocket and walk off""   Most the crowd seemed like legit guys and gals though so hopefully that thought process wasn't going through to many heads, and people didn't do such things.

The problem to me seemed to be everything was just 'out' for anyone to pick up. I was at VapeJam as a potential buyer and the taste testing was mostly ""here's a mod, have a go"" and then they turned away to speak to someone else.  Maybe I just didn't project enough gravitas, but if that's the attention I got as someone getting ready to order a couple thousand bottles; I can't imagine what sort of 1 to 1 anyone else got and if you're handing a two hundred quid mod to someone and turning away you're kind of asking for it.

They're not enforcing imports, they know the current regulations are shaky.  the regulation is on ""in de handel brengen  in nederland"" / roughly translated ""bringing to onto the market"" and does not specifically mention import.

ecr_eu,3cwzp1,Dumbgecko,2,Sat Jul 11 16:52:17 2015 UTC,"You are right in that there are complex legal cases that involve this area, but they are quite early in the EU development regarding free movement of goods (See Van Gend en Loos, Keck, Cassis de Dijon and the recent cases of Commission v Italy regarding Motorcyle Trailers and Michaelson & Roos regarding watercraft on Swedish waterways). However, in this instance, it is not complex - the dutch are simply implementing an EU Directive ahead of schedule. They are perfectly within their rights to do this (see Ratti). It is not illegal assuming that local vape shops cannot sell larger then 10ml either. If this is not the case and you can sell larger than 10ml domestically but not import it, it means that the Directive has been incorrectly implemented. A juice vendor would have to complain to the commission first (I think its article 263 of the TFEU) and only after could they bring a case, but the issue of getting standing for such a case would be...difficult...to say the least.  EDIT: forgot to mention ""public health"" is one of the blanket immunities that states can use to justify their actions, even when regarding free trade and movement of individuals. Even if it was found in a court to be illegal for them to implement the Directive early (which would be VERY unlikely), then the dutch government can just claim it was for public health reasons. A good example of this is the case of Van Duyn v UK."

ecr_eu,3cwiwe,Dumbgecko,3,Sat Jul 11 11:14:34 2015 UTC,"Resistance changes the same in nickel as with kanthal.    Lower gauge = lower resistance More wraps = more resistance Dual coil = half the resistance of one coil   Due to the length of a nickel coil, I tend to not go under 2mm diameter. If you have room for it, 3mm diameter is quite warm and cloudy.   Resistance wise there seems little to no difference between normal (soft) and hardended wire. The later behaves a lot like kanthal.   I can't really speak of other wires, haven't played with any yet and I'm quite pleased with nickel so far.   Hope that helps in some way, lemme know if you need any more specific input."
ecr_eu,3cwiwe,sjugge,2,Sat Jul 11 11:37:15 2015 UTC,Thats brilliant thank you! So what would be an average diameter for nickel wire? For example I use .42mm kanthal in most my builds due to its flexibility of use.   One other thing is tempered wire as workable as kanthal or still easy to damage as normal nickel?
ecr_eu,3cwiwe,sjugge,3,Sat Jul 11 11:55:46 2015 UTC,"I used wire between .30 and .40mm. In Dual coil it becomes hard to reach minimal resistance with a lower gauge with 2mm diameter coils. Even if you get to the needed minimal resistance and can fit them, the length of the coil may prevent a completely saturated wick in the middle, causing slight scorching, gunck etc.   I'm trying something a bit different with 2 strand twisted .20mm nickel with a 3mm diameter.  Did 15 wraps, touching, on the velocity which fits great and come out to .10ohm. Because of the pattern of the twist, there is still some spacing which seems to make a difference in TC measuring and vapour production.   Tempered nickel is a lot like kanthal. Very springy, it still is like nickel to the touch, but handles more like kanthal."
ecr_eu,3cwiwe,Isacrificecows,1 point,Sat Jul 11 12:06:38 2015 UTC,"I just can't seem to get the resistance, with ni200 right, I've tried 10,12 and 14 wraps on a 3mm, and the lowest I'm getting is .25, I know about spacing and all that. And when I put my wick and juice on it's, sub par. Ideas?"
ecr_eu,3cwiwe,sjugge,2,Sat Jul 11 11:46:25 2015 UTC,"For drippers I'd recommend dual coils, I did a tutorial on this.   Watt setting doesn't really matter, just crancked it up to something a bit higher than what TC allows.  I usually have TC set between 210 and 225 degrees Celcius.

ecr_eu,3cwiwe,FarkMcBark,2,Sat Jul 11 21:42:06 2015 UTC,"Rayon is actually pretty simple. Just twist it really hard so that you can put it in the coil with little resistance, and then untwist it a bit when it's in the coil."

ecr_eu,3cxanh,Venterino,1 point,Sat Jul 11 21:07:53 2015 UTC,The ability to customize and get data off the board on your PC is one of the things that people are excited about - see busardo's preview
ecr_eu,3cxanh,hapticsquid,2,Sat Jul 11 22:01:01 2015 UTC,That is true! One 3s 1000mAh battery is as small as 18650 and has more capacity or at least same capacity.. and is easyer to use and even more simple to charge as evolv said :)
ecr_eu,3cxanh,dnaq,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:49:17 2015 UTC,Why do you feel lipos are a bad choice? Just curious.
ecr_eu,3cxanh,dnaq,1 point,Sun Jul 12 09:30:20 2015 UTC,"I guess because it is hard to make a change. One found in evic is crap because no extra cables to check individual cell state,but normal lipos or life batteries are excellent. I will maybe get a li fe battery because extremely low drop on them and are the most advanced for now."
ecr_eu,3cxanh,Dumbgecko,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:51:25 2015 UTC,"There's no reason for mods to have built in lipos (like the evic). Innokins new mod has interchangeable lipos (with a new custom connector) and there are standard connectors for lipos that RC people use.  What might be an issue is that there's no standardised form factor for lipos, but on the other hand it's not that hard to find lipos that match specific dimensions. Take a look at the 3s lipos they have on http://hobbyking.com and you'll see."
ecr_eu,3cxanh,dnaq,1 point,Mon Jul 13 06:36:21 2015 UTC,I would imagine its because LiPo packs vent explosively if damaged hope its helpful
ecr_eu,3cxanh,Dumbgecko,2,Mon Jul 13 05:40:29 2015 UTC,"That they do, but to be honest so do 18650s (but their casing is harder). We carry lipos every day in our pockets without issues and most people drop their cell phones at least a couple of times. A mod should be designed to protect the lipo so that it doesn't get punctured.  The mvp2 contains a lipo, and I haven't heard of any of those exploding"
ecr_eu,3cxanh,dnaq,2,Mon Jul 13 06:26:26 2015 UTC,"If your using the wrong chemistry batteries absolutely, by no means are any of our batteries to be treated without respect.  I think a lot of it is the perception and that the lipo packs we see used in mods are likely to be less resistant to shock etc then the phone cells we see these days. (Hobby kit against commercially available)  Considering the amount of QC issues we already see in vaping I dont fancy it myself  particularly!"
ecr_eu,3cxanh,sjugge,2,Mon Jul 13 06:36:36 2015 UTC,"I think a lot of it is the perception and that the lipo packs we see used in mods are likely to be less resistant to shock etc then the phone cells we see these days. (Hobby kit against commercially available)   I believe lot of the isticks of the world have been shipped with low quality lipos, but even then the issues with these devices have seldom been because of the actual lipo used.  But a lot of people are using lipos when flying quads and RC planes, and those take a drop from time to time without exploding. RC car people also crash all the time without their lipos exploding.  The huge safety issue with a 3s lipo is that it needs a good balance charger, overcharging/overdischarging lipo cells is a real issue. I think that's the big thing that the dna200 brings to the table, a well designed, small form factor balance charger."
ecr_eu,3cxanh,vapourdepot,1 point,Mon Jul 13 06:43:55 2015 UTC,"I think that as a charger for only 3s lipos without vaping it is still a good choice hahaah.

ecr_eu,3cwhi4,FarkMcBark,2,Sat Jul 11 15:32:45 2015 UTC,Ah thanks! An indeed it is lol. Unfortunately titanium isn't.  I only have a circular magnet but it looks like the force is a bit too much to be able to unspool easily. Also the wire can skip out on the side. Maybe your magnet is weaker and it works better?  I still think I'm going to go and get or 3D print the spool tamers because they are easier to spool up again.

I hope it will arrive before the end of the contest but if it doesn't then the winner will have to wait until it does.  The banner will go behind the logo on our site here: https://8bitvape.co.uk/ (where the grass and sky colours are) so you may want to take that into account. I might not use them if they look weird but if they look good then I will.  Erm I think that's everything for now..

My idea was using old school RPG characters doing vaping related stuff (hence why in both of them, the female character is holding a mod and tank, and has vapour coming out of her mouth, and in the second, the male is ""mixing""). Part of me likes the idea of the contrast between the two sides in the second version, yet at the same time, I also think the left hand side needs a little something more.  I know I will update when more ideas come to mind, but it's been a while since I've done something like this, so I do need to train up again.  Edit: Just done an update, with everything drawn from scratch, mostly to keep on the right side of copyright law.

ecr_eu,3crpy2,Dumbgecko,2,Fri Jul 10 06:43:13 2015 UTC,I wasn't aware you had a blog! You should link it in your reviews.
ecr_eu,3ct3dh,whateverisfree,2,Fri Jul 10 15:34:42 2015 UTC,"Rebuilding is incredibly cheap mate, few quid for a tank is the biggest expense. After that, you can get 10M of Kanthal for €3-5, some cotton (I use Simply Gentle Organic Cotton Balls which are incredibly cheap yet still provide good vape IMO), €5 for enough of those to last a couple of years. It's really inexpensive compared to using stock coils.  You don't /need/ an ohm meter, but they are useful. IDK what your battery is like, but check that is has short circuit protection. If it doesn't, you will need something to measure your coils (I'd recommend a cheap multimeter - can get one for €5 or so from ebay)."
ecr_eu,3ct3dh,XtrmJosh,2,Fri Jul 10 18:49:40 2015 UTC,"The thing I just found out is that I can at least rewick my Innokin coils, which would spare me a few euros here and there but I only had crappy cotton at home so it tasted like garbage. I tried it, but threw the coil head away. Tasted like unfamiliar chemicals, so I wasn't comfortable keeping it around.  But you're absolutely right. I actually have an RDA, the Caterpillar from Smok. It's not the best one out there, but it'd work. I'd really like an RTA down the line in order to have custom builds with me at work as well.  My current battery is an Ego One mini, so not the greatest. But I do have an iStick 30W on its way to me, so that'd read the resistance of the coil. From what I can gather, for right around 15€  I could throw together a set that would allow me to rebuild. That includes tools, kanthal and cotton. There's cheaper places as well, but that's what I found out in 5 minutes. I'll look into it over the weekend and perhaps place some orders.  Thanks for your reply and have a great weekend :)"
ecr_eu,3ct3dh,XtrmJosh,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:41:35 2015 UTC,"The rebuilding supplies (cotton and kanthal) you can buy enough to last over a year for under £10 (€14~), the tank itself probably costs the same. Compared to stock coils (probably 1 a week) costing £2 a time, that's £100 saving a year.  For a tank, you can probably get something very cheap (maybe £10 or so). A goblin clone is probably perfectly ideal, and costs around that. Only real issue is how long shipping takes with FastTech, but if you're willing to wait it's worth it.  https://www.fasttech.com/products/0/10013071/2202700-goblin-styled-rta-rebuildable-tank-atomizer  Things not so good are that it leaks a bit (through the bottom fill), and it's an odd building deck (not a single coil, sort of designed for quad coil, but most people build dual coils in it - I build quad coils). The Goblin is probably the ""de facto"" RBA right now, good flavour, good capacity, plentiful vape. Usual complaints are that it leaks and it's bottom fill. The Cthulhu has top fill, and is very similar. Fairly similar price, too...  https://www.fasttech.com/search?Cthulhu"

ecr_eu,3crnd8,kingpool,1 point,Fri Jul 10 06:37:22 2015 UTC,For how long should I steep SnG and MBV? Should I let air in?
ecr_eu,3crnd8,cloudhousevapor,2,Fri Jul 10 18:26:27 2015 UTC,"My personal favorite method (if you don't have a sonic mixer) is to open the bottle and squeeze it a few times to replace the air in the bottle. Then shake it like crazy. Do this a few times.   Now put it somewhere dark and warm, repeating the process every few days. Depending on the flavor you should give it 1-3 weeks of steep time. Less if you apply some heat and are good about shaking the bottle. The general rule is that the more complex the flavor the longer it needs to steep. Bakery flavors, Thug, Hawk, and tobaccos need the longest. Simple fruits the shortest steep time.   I hope this helps :)"

ecr_eu,3co936,Dumbgecko,2,Thu Jul 9 13:25:30 2015 UTC,"+1 on that. I think the subbox kit is hard to beat as a performance beginners setup. + he can rebuild it if he wants, i think. (it still comes with a RBA section, doesn't it?)"
ecr_eu,3co936,spoilerhead,2,Thu Jul 9 13:33:09 2015 UTC,It does come with the upgraded RBA section. My only hesitation in recommending one right now is that it's rumoured they will be releasing a version with a spring-loaded 510 shortly (has a fixed 510 currently).   Other than that I think it's the best starter kit on the market by a country mile.

ecr_eu,3co936,spoilerhead,2,Thu Jul 9 13:44:44 2015 UTC,This is the problem.   I showed him my iStick but he said it's too big.   He really wants a mech but doesn't seem to get how dangerous they can be without some experience first.     I honestly think a starter kit is the way to go as he only smokes socially.

ecr_eu,3co936,ganjadan,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:00:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah they take any 18650, I've got the CF subΩ myself with the integrated battery, a bit of a pain in the ass because you have to use an ego charger. Other than that, not too bad at all, with a subtank mini."
ecr_eu,3co936,ganjadan,2,Thu Jul 9 14:04:43 2015 UTC,Am I correct in thinking the CF sub is essentially a battery holder with a regulation circuit at the top?   thus I could take out my 18650 batteries when they die and recharge them using my nitecore?

I use a nitecore charger anyway so I just ripped mine out.   Sorta related to this, and purely curiosity, what would happen if you were to plug a charger into the micro usb without the board? Would it charge at all (albeit unevenly) or just not work at all? Don't wan't to test because I like my hands."

ecr_eu,3cotu6,PartTimeLegend,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:40:57 2015 UTC,"That doesn't look like a bad price at all, 100ml of PG can be about £3, a 200ml bottle of glycerol from boots is about £1.50... Buy the same amount in small bottles and it could cost up to £45!  Just a side question, you said you bought PG before but weren't sure about VG (or at least the different names for it...) had you been doing 100% PG mixes? Please tell me you had VG before and just didn't realise that Glycerol was an alternative name!  But... I'm kinda curious if you did 100% PG what on earth it vapes like!"

ecr_eu,3cljxc,downtide,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:54:39 2015 UTC,They are similar so you could probably substitute Bean with Gelato.    However the Vanilla Bean Ice Cream is way better than the Gelato.

ecr_eu,3cj4e5,DarkestFayth,5,Wed Jul 8 08:52:25 2015 UTC,"To play Devil's advocate on what seems to be the popular opinion in this thread so far, I think it's wise for all vendors in this industry to shoot for versatility in the products they carry.  As /u/sjugge has suggested, I think you should carry the hardware that you feel brings out the best in your juices; are you fond of a particular RDA, wicking material, wire? Stock what you use and what you have experience with, perhaps even give suggestions on types of builds/wicking technique alongside these products.   Juice is your bread and butter, you won't be able to compete with the the prices larger vendors can offer consumers, however where you can't compete in price, you can compete in service. One of my bugbears in this industry is how quickly the current technology becomes outdated. This means that vendors are having to constantly stay on top of what's currently ""in"" at the moment. More often than not this also means they have little to no knowledge of the products they are selling beyond what the manufacturer has listed on their spec sheets.   If you feel as though you can stay on top of the current technology, and when asked specifics by your customers about that hardware that goes beyond the remit of what the manufacturer has provided on their spec sheet, then by all means stock 'the latest and greatest'.    Looking at your current hardware selection, I would make a few specific recommendations.   Batteries: We've come a long way since AW IMRs, look into stocking batteries with higher amp drain limits. (Samsung 25r, 30Q, LG HE2, HE4, HG2, Sony VTC 4/5 are all good options).  Wicking material: Fibre Freaks (fondly known as ""elitist prick wick"" by /u/fluffton). I've been having great results with this stuff and have been using it exclusively for a few weeks now. It's basically proprietary rayon, however I've found that it wicks a little better and is more forgiving to flavour changes than standard Graham Rayon.   Perhaps you could get in contact with someone like Cottonman about becoming the first (I believe) distributor of his cotton in the EU?  Wire: With devices that are capable of pushing higher wattages becoming the norm (even in the 'low-end' sector of the market), and the trend for subohming, perhaps consider stocking something like UD's pre-spooled clapton wire?   At the moment you're currently only stocking kanthal, as temperature protection becomes more affordable the types of wire people need for that technology is becoming more popular. You should look into stocking Ni200 and Titanium wires.   Looking forward to seeing your concentrates! (Monday, it's set in stone now ;) )"
ecr_eu,3cj4e5,OptimalOatmeal,2,Wed Jul 8 10:43:09 2015 UTC,"Thank you very much for your extensive feedback - we tend to agree with each one of your recommendations. Having said that, visit our store in a week to see them implemented :)"

ecr_eu,3cj4e5,OptimalOatmeal,4,Wed Jul 8 12:42:28 2015 UTC,"Hi! My 2 cents: I dont really need every juice-seller to have mods, but what is always nice is the possibility to get juice, cotton and wire in one go."
ecr_eu,3cj4e5,Sidebard,5,Wed Jul 8 08:58:57 2015 UTC,A one stop shop is always a good idea but stocking the right things I can imagine is the headache.

ecr_eu,3cj4e5,Dumbgecko,3,Wed Jul 8 11:33:04 2015 UTC,"Juice sellers don't need to sell hardware unless you can bring something different to the game. People have the places where they buy there juice and where they buy hardware, they don't have to be the same place.  Selling only juice also gives a impression of more high quality as that's your only business. If you want to branch out, go more into diy goods."
ecr_eu,3cj4e5,Crompee01,3,Wed Jul 8 09:04:33 2015 UTC,"I think it's sensible to carry a smell selection of hardware things like a few starter kits a large range of different wire would be nice, kanthal, flat wire, titanium, nickle. different cotton options, dripping bottles, hex keys, screw drivers things like that. But its better to focus on one thing instead of trying to do everything, personally i would focus on producing more flavors of juice, maybe try something community driven, have a page on your website where people can post flavor ideas and have the option to vote on them, kinda like the Reddit system but with no down vote option, if a flavor gets so many votes within an allocated timeframe give it a go, try making it and see if its any good."

ecr_eu,3cj4e5,Monocaust,3,Wed Jul 8 11:12:15 2015 UTC,"imo no need to stock atties and mods, you won't be able to be competitive on this, but consumables like wicking material or batteries would be nice."
ecr_eu,3cj4e5,Llamatron2112,3,Wed Jul 8 11:12:58 2015 UTC,"Honestly, stay away from hardware unless you can get a great deal on purchasing them. Juices are easy to distance yourself from your competition on whereas hardware competition is based mostly on price.  Stocking a wide range of juices, diy concentrates and otherwise is a much better way of differing your stock from other similar stockists, even having a USP of suggested diy recipes or how to closely recreate your own juices using concentrates isn't a bad idea.   Generally though the vaping hardware market has a lot more barriers of entry than the juice and subsidiary product market does.  Either way, good luck in the future!"
ecr_eu,3cj4e5,dorsettangerine,3,Wed Jul 8 11:42:05 2015 UTC,"Going to go in and agree with what others have said. Wick, wire and batteries would be sufficient. Maybe some other little things, like ceramic tweezers, coilers etc.. The hardware business is a messy game."
ecr_eu,3cj4e5,ultralowlatency,3,Wed Jul 8 12:50:02 2015 UTC,"I'd say focus on what you're known for. Hardware is mostly universal, but your liquids are unique.

So you have to constantly research new trends, upcoming devices, ... and if you fail, you're stuck with possibly hundreds of unsellable devices."
ecr_eu,3cj4e5,spoilerhead,2,Wed Jul 8 09:11:28 2015 UTC,"I agree with the others here in that having rebuilding stuff would be handy (wick, wire etc) but apart from that stick to selling dat sweet sweet juice"

ecr_eu,3cj4e5,sjugge,2,Wed Jul 8 09:31:57 2015 UTC,"My friends who run B&Ms in Cardiff say that higher end authentic hardware is good for margins, but to me that seems like it only works for newcomers who don't know how/where to do the research for online prices.  I visit the B&Ms once a fortnight to try new juices and stock up on my 'treats' - premiums favourites to supplement and inspire my DIY.  I appreciate local businesses need margins to survive, but I'll never get gouged for marked up packets of 1m wire / 4 cotton pads, yet I don't mind paying for the juices. I'm led to believe Cuttwood and others enforce their RRP, so I hope they (you) do well with margins from wholesale prices.  TL;DR - get a wide range of popular juices and try to earn decent margins on higher end (popular) authentic hardware. Sigeleis / Tugboats / Velocities etc."
ecr_eu,3cj4e5,keee,2,Wed Jul 8 09:32:52 2015 UTC,Hi buddy. In my humble opinion focus on your juices! Your stuff is real premium juice and you already have a very good reputation!

ecr_eu,3cj4e5,ohwhatawittymoniker,2,Wed Jul 8 09:38:31 2015 UTC,"I think you should stick mainly to your core offer which is good juice. Do a bit of hardware but specialise rather than trying to do it all. A nice tight little range, things you like to use yourself. Maybe just some RDAs and tanks including a few that are a bit more unusual and hard to find elsewhere. Mods are difficult as for higher priced stuff the more people will shop around for the cheapest deal which means going to the vendors who can order bulk and get the best prices. Hard to compete with that.    Stocking wick and wire is also good, it's handy to be able to top on those when buying juice."
ecr_eu,3cj4e5,hapticsquid,2,Wed Jul 8 09:46:14 2015 UTC,"I think most people are right, it would be sensible to stock the little things (coils, wire, cotton etc) rather than actual hardware unless you can beat or match other vendor prices."

Obviously if you could make it even, then having both wouldn't be a problem, but I know that's hard in todays market."
ecr_eu,3cj4e5,Nobjockey666,2,Wed Jul 8 10:16:08 2015 UTC,"I think you should stick to the juices and possibly supply some wire/wick or supplies (o rings, screws, tweezers?)   You could also sell some pre built coils that you think make your juice taste the best?"

ecr_eu,3cj4e5,dark_banana,2,Wed Jul 8 10:37:04 2015 UTC,"Only juice is not a bad way to go, people always come for juice. If they can buy some extra coils, wicking material, wires, empty bottles,... as well as delicious juice, all in one shop, vapers will be very happy! The problem with this is coils. What tanks are relevant right now? How long will they be relevant? Maybe stay on the stuff that people always need, tools to rebuild coils."

Batteries, Mods, Rda's, Rta's, kanthal, wicking materials, etc. All that as well as you're eliquid lineup will make you guys a one stop shop and that'll make it easy for people to choose you over say another vendor who might not sell all they need."
ecr_eu,3cj4e5,ViralNation,2,Wed Jul 8 12:06:23 2015 UTC,"Basic consumable hardware like cotton, wire and batteries should always be available on juice supplies websites, it would make life a whole lot easier, and you'd get more of my money."

Like if I buy 30ml of e-liquid from you, I get this coupon/discountcode for item X from vendor X, and vice versa, if I buy product from that vendor, I get discount on some specific juice.   I see it as it would help both parties to grow bigger."

That first drag on a CE4, sitting on top of an Ego-T, filled with a 1.3mg US Blend from a local pseudo B&M. I tasted like a stale candy from grandma's drawer that clinged so hard onto the plastic that you just gave up on getting it of.  After pulling it hard for a couple of hours, I wasn't feeling to well. Not from a nicotine OD, but from (presumably) the plastic and glue coming from the CE4. I remember that time fondly, like it was yesterday, though it was just a year ago. It drove me to spent hours finding online vendors for higher nic juice. I sat there behind the window like a puppy waiting for it's owner, drawling and twitching, waiting for my first vapemail to arrive. Shortly after arrival the nic started buzzing trough me, I chucked my pack of tobacco and never looked back.  Happy freaking bday /r/ecr_eu!"

I wanted an e-cigarette, but I disliked the looks of them, and kept referring to them as oversized techno-flutes. Until I saw the pipe...  For a few months it became my obsession to try to make a pipe setup that worked. I had the SMOK E-Pipe II mod, and I tried out various attys to make it look really cool.  The first pipe build looked like this - then I got the mouthpiece, and it started looking really awesome.  In the end, I had two setups that looked awesome. They looked like this.  Now I don't use the pipe anymore. I got tired of switching batteries all the time (it runs on 18350 you know), and I became fond of the whole sub-ohm she-bang, but I still dream of getting myself a beautiful mechanical pipe mod, because they surely exist out there."

I'd cold turkeyed off tobacco for a week over Christmas, which I could keep up for a while I was away staying with family but now I was back home and the craving to smoke again was too much. I'd never vaped before, I walked in off the street knowing nothing at all about e-cigs. I was sceptical they would work but I was desperate to try anything. The guy in the B&M was a star, explained everything to me, after a lot of deliberation and trying different devices I decided on a Kanger Emow. First juice was Vampire Vapes Heisenberg (which I still like) and a bunch of cheap crappy tobacco flavours (most of them are still in the drawer). It worked. Damn, it worked. I've not smoked again since. I still thank the guy every time I go in the shop. Three months later, they sold me my first rebuildable, a Lemo, and all the tools and supplies."

I heard about vaping through a friend who's wife had started vaping because he had a degenerative lung condition and she didn't want to smoke around him. Here I am with a healthy pair of lungs that I'm slowly destroying for the sake of a stupid habit, I must research this vaping lark.  I did a bit of research on various vaping forums and concluded that a mini protank 2/ego starter kit from myepack was the way forward and the Dekang e-liquid that they sold looked delicious in their brown plastic bottles. Shall I go with Cherry or double menthol? Perhaps mixing them together could make things more interesting, I'm not as daft as I look!  So 18 month's later I'm DIYing my own juice and building my own coils on a subtank mini/istick combo. I can go hours without thinking about vaping so my end game is approaching and I'm looking at stopping on the day I started vaping completing a two year cycle on the 3rd of January 2016."

It didn't feel right at first, but I figured I owed it to him to make a try since he gave it to me for free (I only later learned about ""vaping it forward"") ..As it happened I made it through my first day without a smoke. And the second. And, to my surprise, the first week.   In fact I haven't had a single cigarette since my first puff of that ce4. Even if I recognise now how crappy that was, the small form factor and cheap price made it conceivable for me to use. I always keep a couple ce4 starter kits around to give to likely candidates now and tell them to feel free to ask me for help if they want move on. At least a couple have been able to drop cigs completely like me, and a few others have cut down the smoking with this as help.  Tldr: Random no-name ce4 and Libery flight Burley."

I had mentally prepared to stop smoking months beforehand but never actually committed. I had stopped smoking in the house, around my wife etc since we found out, but at work and when I was out I was still on the old rollies :)  I was sent out to buy more wipes & baby clothes (MASSIVELY underestimated!) and had the urge for a smoke all the way but resisted. Near the checkout was some fancy packaged disposable cigalike. I remembered hearing about them but never really gave them much thought. Decided it was worth a shot to kill the pangs for nicotine.  Wow.  From the first (considerably weak) throat hit, I knew I wouldn't smoke again. I got back, both our parents were there and I'm puffing away as I walk in, shocked faces not realising what I'm doing. ""oh my god this is amazing - why haven't I tried this sooner?!"".  I've felt the same way since: vaping is a superior nicotine delivery system to smoking. Granted it's turned into a hobby for me now (down from 18mg -> 3mg) and it's all about the juice flavours and kit experimentation, but the feeling still stands.  From off-brand single disposables, to Nicolite refillables, eGo pens and cartomisers and now to fully rebuildables with box mods and punchy batteries. Love it."

My GF  was constantly up in my face about starting to smoke again too, relegated me to the outside and still went on about how bad I smelt. My parents were not happy either about me starting again.  one day, 2 heavy smokers sat with these machines (Evods) in the smokers lounge in our office. they urged me to try it, which I relented to do, telling them that ""this will never work"".  I bought my own Evods the next week, after those guys dissuaded my fears that this ecig stuff is even more harmful than the real deal. Since then I am a happy camper. I do smoke from time to time, mostly when out drinking, but other than that this developed into a hobby for me which I wouldnt wanna miss.  My GF was initially happy, then read some crap articles about safety and health, and now I'm back on my balcony again to vape at home...yeah.   At least I can vape all I want in my office.

Also gurgling, spitting -first time I freaked out, thought having e-juice in my mouth was more dangerous than it really is- and bought a T2 two weeks later (for 25€!!!). I liked that atomizer. Like it so much I chainvaped it until I bought my MVP2.0 and Kayfun from Cloudhousevapor not too long after. Hence the first dry hit, 2 hours after reception. Tasted like sadness and ballsweat. I'll never forget the horrible, horrible taste and immense regret for putting the all metal sleeve on the kayfun. But that setup was a revelation for me. I learned so much in that short span. I learned flavors don't have to be limited to one thing and can be very complex. I learned I was in on vaping for a long time.   Now, after 2 mechs, 4 regulated, ~30 atomizers and a permanent reserve of 1L of e-juice, I want to get back to basics. I plan on giving away/selling most of my stuff and keeping the essentials (with backups, of course), and keep it smpl, focus on e-juice. One gauge wire, one type of wick, two RBAs tops, two tanks, etc. Hope I'll succeed, it's becoming overwhelming."

I remember sat on my granddads couch and him just whip out this silver stick, I had no idea what vaping was at the time and thought the only ecigs that you could buy was the ones with the light up ends that were a couple of quid in the corner shop.  I was smoking at the time, quite a lot, and had been doing for many years, he insisted I try some and I did. It tasted like pure shite. I had never tasted something so awful in my life, it was a cheaply made, mass produced Golden Virginia flavour, and it was enough to make my eyes water and cough up a lung (or both).  I thought to myself ""I'd never do that, seems stupid when you can just go outside and have a fag (cigarette) instead""  Oh how I was wrong, this was a couple of months later, I'd had an operation and had been bed bound for about 2 weeks, I could barely move and living with my parents I wasn't allowed to smoke in the house, I couldn't even think about the pain, all I wanted was to go downstairs and inhale the cancerous delights of a Sterling Superking (times were hard, sick pay was shit)  Fast forward a couple of days and I get this knock on the door and my granddad was stood there, silver stick in hand (I can't remember the exact name of the cig itself, it was just a basic EGO stick I think). He hands me it and says ""I know you'll be needing one of these, and gave me a quick run down on how it worked, press the middle button twice to change the strength, how there was a little drag counter at the bottom to count. (those were the days) and he bought be a 10ml bottle of tobacco flavoured liquid, which I gobbled up in about a day.  Skip forward another few weeks, and I was able to move, I went downstairs, tried to smoke, couldn't do it, been vaping ever since. Grandad gets fuming when I just blow huge clouds infront of the TV when he's trying to watch something.   He says getting me into it was the worst thing he's ever done, because even though I don't smoke anymore, I spend double on vaping!  Not much of a story, but definitely a memorable experience!

It seems so long ago, when I was but a 24 year old who smoked way too much and was suffering at the hands of the price of Amber Leaf. I went to meet my father one day, when he showed me a new purchase he'd made - a CE4 with some strawberry flavoured eliquid. I had dabbled occasionally in ecigs before, but nothing more than those E-Lites that looks like cigarettes and tasted absolutely disgusting. So I tried the one he brought along, and I was very surprised that it actually tasted of something nice, and that I actually felt like the nicotine in it was making me feel like I had had a cigarette already. I thought it was great, and what sealed the deal was that my dad had been smoking for over 20 years, and had managed to give up with this tiny little device. If he could do it then I could too.   A few nights later I was in the pub, and had a bit too much to drink. One of the side effects of this was chain smoking outside in the garden. I must have smoked about 15-20 cigarettes, much more than I would in one night. When I woke up, I felt like absolute crap, and everything smelled of smoke, my throat hurt like hell, and I decided enough was enough, I can't take this feeling anymore.  The next week, my very own Ego/CE4 arrived in the post, and I couldn't wait to get started. I began on 12mg, 70PG and almost immediately decided that 12 was a little too strong for me to use everyday. I stuck with it for a couple more days until ordering some 6mg, and stayed there for quite a long time (getting more and more towards max VG with every bottle). Everything was going great with this little device, until I found /r/electronic_cigarette and was suddenly introduced to a myriad of crazy batteries, atomisers, juices, the lot. Everything there seemed so much cooler, more advanced, and a great deal more expensive. I thought to myself ""Well, this stuff looks great, but I can't see myself spending all this money on this new gear, I just need to stop smoking."" Boy was I wrong. Over one year later, my desk is covered in RTAs, RDAs, wire, cotton, and a whole cupboard full of DIY juice making materials. I have had one cigarette since then, out of curiosity, and it was really, really terrible. I am all the happier for buying the first ecig. I didn't have it for long but it sent me on a path to a new hobby and I love it. Well, except those dry hits ;)"

My brain went into auto drive. I coughed my guts up for the next 5ish minutes. I had tears streaming down my face. All the while, my friend looked on, laughing like a lunatic! Then, as soon as I'd finished coughing, all I could taste was really nasty chemicals. I proceeded to rinse my mouth out and send my friend out to buy some half decent fruity juice, and so began my flavour chasing. I'm now on my fifth mod and eleventh tank/RDA, and still chasing those clouds and flavours and perfect kit. I'm always on the look out for new things, and have been helped massively by r/ecr_eu and it's amazing occupants. Happy birthday little sub, 1 year down and hopefully many more to come! And thanks to everyone here and those that put in all the hard work that makes this sub an amazing and fantastic place to be! WE LOVE YOU ECR_EU!!"
ecr_eu,3cj0e5,ganjadan,2,Wed Jul 8 13:27:16 2015 UTC,"Happy birthday ecr!   My first time vaping was a crappy 'ecig wizard' and originally I much preferred the idea of it than the actual execution, it made me dream of producing veritable clouds of vapour and never ending vapour streams.   Needless to say it didn't deliver, but it did lead me to moving on, from the subtank go the Cthulhu (thank you again ecr_eu you glorious bastards) to making my own liquids and rebuilding my Cthulhu with ease, its been a hell of a journey, and now I've been smoke free for what seems like forever.  Just thank you, the thing that stopped me smoking became my favourite hobby due to this sub.   Here's to thousands more clouds of fruity, pudding vapour!"
ecr_eu,3cj0e5,dorsettangerine,2,Wed Jul 8 14:23:47 2015 UTC,"Well my first time...6 months ago...it happened down a dark alley way, with a long cylindrical object....little did i know what i was putting in my mouth, little did i know that they came in different shapes and sizes, little did i know the end result could vary in flavour so much!  That was the day i lost ""it"" to an ego + evod and supercheap juice."
ecr_eu,3cj0e5,Sind3rs,2,Wed Jul 8 14:26:06 2015 UTC,"This was my first set up. As you can imagine it was pretty terrible and I upgraded quickly, but despite it not being very good it was good enough to convince me to continue vaping.   All I remember about my first dry hit was running to the bathroom to get water wondering what the fuck had just happened.   Thanks for the chance!"
ecr_eu,3cj0e5,seanvapes,2,Wed Jul 8 14:47:58 2015 UTC,"My first time was in the summer three years ago.  I was so nervous, trembling all over with sweet longing and anticipation, god; I'd waited so long for this.  When I first saw it I was amazed at the length and girth, I held it in my hands examining it and admiring its sleekness.  Once primed I took it into my mouth, I was still so nervous I had a lot to learn but I was an eager pupil. Pressing my lips around it exploring slowly at first but I couldn't hold myself back from taking it all in, it was so delicious, filling my mouth with its creamy flavour. It was so good, I needed more, I knew this was true love.  Am I doing this right, like 50 shades of Vape?  What really happened was my boyfriend got me a cheap cig-a-like to see if I liked the idea, which I did and then went off and ordered an ego starter kit with some amazing marshmallow liquid (I can't even remember the maker but damn it was nice) and went from there. Nearly three years smoke free though!"
ecr_eu,3cj0e5,apocalysecow,2,Wed Jul 8 15:05:49 2015 UTC,"My first time vaping was at a lan party. It was on a shitty ce4 with some 0mg vanilla juice, probably a shitty one at that. I didn't think much of it, due to the ce4 being quite crappy, like they all are. My first own setup was about 6 months later when I saw a riptrippers video (don't kill me) and was like OOOOHHH MY GAAAWWWD is this where they technology is atm? So I got myself an ego vv and an aerotank 2. I went to a shady kiosk and bought some cheap strawberry juice. My first dry hit was when I had just put the juice in the aerotank and didn't wait to take a drag. It was like satan farted burning gasoline down my throat. Now I'm vaping a hastur rda on an FT nemy clone and I couldn't be happier :)"

It was with a cig-alike (no idea about the resistance/voltage), with a ""tobacco"" flavoured juice in ""medium"" strenght (yeah, very informative, i know).  Shitty vape, no flavour, no vapour, shitty battery. I used it for about a week (dual-using) and put it aside after that (and it cost me some 70 or 80 EUR).   Took me 2 years to try again (with an eGo, which satisfied me), so that set-up was responsible for that delay..."

ecr_eu,3cj0e5,Yozie,2,Wed Jul 8 19:29:46 2015 UTC,"Started with an MVP2.0, which was hot shit at that point, and quickly added a couple of Evod VVs to the mix with protank 2 / minis as toppers. Never used the iClear that came with the MVP. This is pretty much the setup I used until the Evods started dying, and having started rebuilding the protank heads I figured I wanted a proper rebuildable, and something with a bit more power. The iStick30W was coming out and seemed to fix the biggest issues people had with the 20W so i got one of those, and a Lemo Drop because people seemed to like them and it fit the iStick well.    Shortly after that the drippers came in, but that's a story for another day, maybe for a different contest ;)."

I instantly got my 1st dry hit, and somehow managed to melt the thing within about a month while it was charging.  I then decided to do a bit of research lol."

ecr_eu,3cj0e5,EH-live,2,Wed Jul 8 21:12:25 2015 UTC,"I was lucky, I had a mentor who gave me a lot of advice and took the time to explain the basics and months later the advanced ideas behind DIY and mechs etc.  I had tried Gum, cigalikes and those fake ciggy inhalor things, they just make me feel sick and want a cigarette, all in the 6 months after having a heart attack at 39 largely blamed on Cigarettes.   But my first time with vaping i was really nervous about the whole spending £80 on untested kit, i dont know anyone IRL who did it and did not trust shops to tell me the truth. I got this scary heavy MVP 2.0 with iclear 16 kit, watched hours and hours of reviews  while i waited for delivery and bugged my mentor again and again whilst waiting nervously for the delivery.  It arrived, i even paid extra for a nautilus (which i never got to work even after i fixed dropping it lol), a bottle of 18mg RY4 which tasted like ass  and tugged away so hard on the thing i broke the plastic within a few days.  I kept with it, pushed through the massive nicotine rushes, the massive headache at first and had 1 rollup out of nervousness, the last one i ever had, over thinking about if it broke at work, spilt juice more than a few times, all this in the first few days.   Days after this i found i only needed a few tokes to feel fullfilled, I started to order some juice from a big name vendor recommended to me on the sidebar >> (but yet didnt know about this sub) via a direct link, Tried some fruity flavours, dropped down to 12 which my body was much happier about, I even found i could go 48 hours without vaping and not worry at all.  Since then i am a hobbyist as much as anything, i make my own juice, buy far too many shinys to admit to the wife (although she now is a full time vaper too !) and like many of you guys, i find i breathe normally, dont cough and after 11 months consider myself a very happy""ex-smoker"".  Most of all I am greateful to everyone who helps others get off the stinkies, you are the real good guys in this :)"

A couple of weeks later I bought my own, a simple ego battery with a Aspire ETS-BVC, I failed so many times with filling it I almost gave up before I even started.   Eventually got the hang of it, bought a VV/VW mod (Innokin iTaste 20W) a nautilus mini and some coils. That's where it all really took off, and I'm glad it did.   I really love vaping and everything about it, the community, the diversity and to have found a new hobby."

My first impression was that my throat was scratching. This was of course accompanied with a rather cool vape.  But what did I know then! That was the best week of my vaping and smoking time combined. Without the olfactory fatigue, without the vaper's tongue and only with the sense of taste returning to be thankful for, I kept trying out different FA juices and they all tasted so amazingly good. Sweet heaven, the nuances I was able to notice in the FA Maxx Blend... Then I realized my vape could be made warmer. It was all downhill from there. :)  Happy birthday ecreuers!"

ecr_eu,3cixhy,TFeldt,4,Wed Jul 8 07:13:24 2015 UTC,"While this is quite laughable I've been wondering about some things myself lately, namely the inadvertent effects of vaping. I know I'm PG intolerant, whenever I vape a juice with 60 or more PG I get these itchy, red lumps in my elbow joints and knee joints. They're not painful, just itchy. When I stop vaping PG they go away in less than a day. Easily solved, just don't vape anything with more PG than VG. Done.  But there's other crap that ""can happen""(tm). For instance, sometimes when refilling I get juice on my fingers. It happens. We know humans touch their face an insane amount of times every day, so inevitably I get some on my face. I've left my teenage years well behind but this bloody stuff gives me acne. Always in the same places to, namely where I stroke my beard/chin or rub my forehead. Where the nicotine will go, basically. Vaping has seriously improved my hand hygiene since I'm paranoid about leaving anything on them for this reason. Bloody washing my hands 8 times a day. And that solved it, no more nicotine induced acne.  Now, let's extrapolate what this Swire person said. Let's imagine he was refilling his device, he got some high PG crap on his fingers, he poked his ear and it was left there. Could this have happened then? Maybe, I have no idea. But that's not really the fault of vaping, is it? It's just an unintended consequence of not cleaning up. Same thing with people venting batteries in their mechs, not really a fault of vaping but it's related to it. To the 80% of the population that doesn't smoke or vape it's not just related to it, it is the fault of vaping.  Long story short; it's things like these that will cause us harm in the long run, even though our first reaction is to laugh it off I'm beginning to think we should address the issues."

I've been having the exact same symptoms as he described in one of his tweets but I'm highly sceptical that vaping has been the cause of it. There's always the chance that vaping has exacerbated it but I seriously doubt it. Does anyone have any more info? Sod it. I'm being lazy. I'll google-fu it. I usually use 70/80vg or higher, sometimes ""Max VG"" (I realise Max VG could mean any ratio) but my point is, I'm not exposed to very high levels of PG, although at 5-10mls per day, that is a fair amount, so would be interested to know what amount of PG could do this, if at all possible."

ecr_eu,3cixhy,branflakes92,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:08:48 2015 UTC,"So he says that PG is ototoxic, which this source also claims can be caused by ear drops containing PG entering the inner ear . However - ""For ear drops to cause ototoxicity they must enter the middle ear, and then the inner ear. Entry into the middle ear generally requires a perforation in the eardrum, either from an injury, or a tube placed for ventilation""  The article continues to say that PG is a common ingredient in ear drops, so it seems entirely plausible that PG did cause this hearing loss but was due to a pre-existing issue with his ear. With PG such a common ingredient in ear drops I think your average person doesn't have to worry.  This is still really good to know though. It's good to finally find out some actual bad shit that can happen through vaping."

ecr_eu,3cjmf0,Dumbgecko,2,Wed Jul 8 12:50:57 2015 UTC,+ the Stingray X has a locking ring and quite a bit of room in case you have a longish battery or want to add a fuse. Good stuff.

To give an idea, my other mechs are the 4nine (3six as well :p), Stingray X, Manhattan, Smok Fury-s and e-pipe."
ecr_eu,3cjmf0,Sind3rs,2,Wed Jul 8 15:51:24 2015 UTC,"Its quite difficult to misfire the smpl, especially with the 1:1 c-clip spring switch, i chuck mine in my coat pocket and never have a problem."
ecr_eu,3cjmf0,TheBadStick,2,Wed Jul 8 17:54:35 2015 UTC,"I have a smpl (v1) clone from FastTech and it's the only mech I still regularly use. It's tiny and the switch is awesome. The only downside is that it doesn't have an insulator to prevent shorts if it's fired with no Atty attached.   Out of interest, what nipple top batteries are you thinking of using in a mech? I can't think of any I would consider ""mech-safe"".  Edit: I should mention that I have a stingray-x as well. It doesn't look as garish in the flesh as pictures might suggest, but I rarely pick it up these days as I much prefer the recessed button on the smpl to a locking ring."
ecr_eu,3cjmf0,Krauzber,2,Wed Jul 8 18:34:20 2015 UTC,"The smpl is great, hasn't misfired once during 4 months of countinous use. Easy to fire, love the lockless design. The spring easily holds the weight of mod+atty without firing so it's pocket/bag friendly.   I only use flat top batteries, nipper will work too."
ecr_eu,3cjmf0,Dumbgecko,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:51:45 2015 UTC,"Hybrids across the board use flat top batteries.  i don't use a smpl myself I use a praxis clone instead, I really cant recommend it unfortunately as from what i have seen they are all pretty badly made (which is a really major shame because its would be a damn good bit of kit otherwise!) I like the clean look too so i can definitely understand that!  the other major option would be the wotofo phantom, it comes with both a top cap and hybrid top cap and from what i know should  be damn good, im looking at one myself!"

Worth it, you can grab it from /u/vapourdepot for pretty darn cheap and it is spot on, cant complain!  It is hybrid, positive of the battery touches the 510 directly, so make sure you have a portuding bit of the 510 for it to contact. I mainly use my dogex2 on it.   I feel much safer with the SMPL, the nemesis felt dated, the throw was awkward as shit and the locking ring was nackering.  The SMPL is just a simple switch, it is recessed so you have to get your finger in there to fire it. no fucking about with throw or anything, just simple screw in."

Their site has been like that for weeks too (and is still in total disarray).

ecr_eu,3cfe6x,OhCmonMan,3,Tue Jul 7 17:05:37 2015 UTC,"I never bought an authentic RDA in my life. Most vendors in Germany have either originals or clones. The authentics are mostly really expensive. I just don't have that money to blow on my vaping stuff. I have 11 RDA clones now. 2 are pretty much broken, so I don't use them. 3 need work done which I don't have the tools for, so I don't use them. I broke 1 by accident. The other 5 are in rotation, depending on what I like on that day. It took a long time of trial and error to find out what works for me and what doesn't. That is why I rather buy clones. I can totally imagine buying an authentic if I like the device, for example a Dark Horse or a Little Boy, but even then it would be a huge hassle to get it shipped here and even then I don't know if it performs that much better than the clones I already have.  The argument about supporting the developers is of course totally valid, but the prices are too damn high and the availability isn't always there.   Also, over the years I got the impression that the whole vaping industry is working with a huge markup on everything they sell. Gross generalization, but yeah..."
ecr_eu,3cfe6x,hapticsquid,2,Tue Jul 7 17:42:19 2015 UTC,"I bought a original v2 from greendogvaping in UK for £55 and a couple of quid for shipping. It's the most I've spent on an atomiser and up there with the most I've spent on a single bit of vape gear. Mine came the same way, just a ziplock baggy, though I did get a spare o-ring and some spare screws in mine so you've been short changed there, see if they'll send you some? At the time I was also pretty disappointed with how it arrived. Come on Flawless, I've shown you some love by buying your original, how about you show me some feels back with a nice little box and a certificate of authenticity or something? I figured it was because I got mine from a reseller. From Flawless direct, yeah they should make more effort, I'd feel let down too.    That said, on quality of manufacturing and materials it's by a long chalk the best made RDA of the half dozen I own and so IMO it was worth what I paid. I've got budget originals like the Hastur and the Holmes which are nice but my Tugboat v2 original looks and feels a cut above them...the weight, the finish, the perfect tightness of the tolerances. Worth 2.5 x Holmes RDAs at £21? Yeah I can live with that as I still feel good about buying it every time I pick it up and vape it. So for that I gave them a pass on not getting nice packaging that I admire once and then put it in the drawer.  How does it compare with the clone? I've wanted to look at them side by side."
ecr_eu,3cfe6x,hapticsquid,3,Tue Jul 7 16:35:55 2015 UTC,"The authentic is honestly better built, its a bit tighter fit and has a gold center post rather than stainless steel. The outside finish is cerakoted and looks rather nice on the SX as they match. That said, it would be hard to justify it has $70-80 USD better than the tobeco as in practical usage there would be no real difference.  The device itself is nice, but the entire experience has left a sour note in my mouth and I will not be re-ordering from flawless."
ecr_eu,3cfe6x,DarthRTFM,3,Tue Jul 7 17:54:26 2015 UTC,"I don't blame you for not going to Flawless again, I wouldn't either unless it was with a huge discount.  Functionally yeah an original RDA is going to be no different to the clone and that's the killer argument against them. It was my first experiment with buying a non-Chinese original and I don't regret it but I won't be doing it again. Budget originals and clones are good enough."
ecr_eu,3cfe6x,DJRIPPED,2,Tue Jul 7 18:03:01 2015 UTC,"100% agreed. I've bought several very expensive authentic mods and RDAs, and every damn time, they come in an envelope with minimal packing material, and little to no extras.   The first couple clones I purchased came with everyone's favorite blue screwdriver, extra rings, screws, a drip tip, and generally a nice cardboard or plastic box, for 1/10th the price.   The quality difference is rarely significant, and in performance they are identical (no, I don't give a damn about 0.001 voltage drop).   Needless to say, I've got a TON of little blue screwdrivers. =)"
ecr_eu,3cfe6x,SYEPCY,3,Tue Jul 7 22:52:15 2015 UTC,Flawless sucks don't let that discourage you from buying authentic. Please try again to support the manufacturer. Authentic companies are starting to go under and they are directly linked to Chinese cloners.

It's to cut down on costs in production which allowed them to slightly lower the cost to consumer.

ecr_eu,3cf2h8,TechnocratByNight,1 point,Tue Jul 7 12:22:29 2015 UTC,"I think the problem with smok TC is that it's not temperature control, it's actually temperature limiting. It won't stop dry hits, and it's not supposed to. Which is why it won't pass the dry cotton test. All it does is regulate the temperature you choose to vape at. That's it, no more no less."
ecr_eu,3cf2h8,ganjadan,2,Wed Jul 8 10:52:44 2015 UTC,"That's all good though the issue there is that when you fire it twice it re-reads the resistance. That's fine if you take one puff, if you take two in succession you're going to hit your coil with a lot more voltage than you're meant to."
ecr_eu,3cf2h8,ganjadan,1 point,Wed Jul 8 11:04:11 2015 UTC,"That did happen to me a couple of times when I first got the xpro matey plus, but since then I haven't been able to repeat the effect."

I will bang a different coil in later, I'll aim for a 0.15-0.2Ω. I'll let you know here if there's any change."
ecr_eu,3cf2h8,sjugge,2,Wed Jul 8 13:05:15 2015 UTC,That's really interesting. That's on a nickel coil as well?

ecr_eu,3cf2h8,ganjadan,3,Tue Jul 7 16:07:18 2015 UTC,One of the points of TC is not having dry hits. So an algorithm that assumes a wet wick would be rather useless to achieve this goal wouldn't you agree?
ecr_eu,3cf2h8,xhozt,-1,Tue Jul 7 16:28:47 2015 UTC,No its there to prevent it from getting dry...  Not start off dry
ecr_eu,3cf2h8,ganjadan,2,Tue Jul 7 18:46:19 2015 UTC,"I saw a video a little while ago that explained how it works, I think it was something to do with voltage spikes as the wick dries.

I'm sure you spent more money with the shenanigans than you would just ordering from an EU vendor.  PS: How is Namberjuice? What do you recommend?
ecr_eu,3cfbw8,MolonColon,1 point,Tue Jul 7 17:49:05 2015 UTC,"The time I ordered there was no indication when it will be in stock there. I thought it might take a few weeks more.  Pricewise it is a lot more expensive in Europe (I know, taxes, VAT a.s.o). I paid $40 for 120ml with the reddit coupon code. There are no 120ml bottles here, and 4x 17,49... is near twice the price. So ordering 120ml at KIC + shipping = close to ordering at chv. BUT I ordered at Cloudhousevapor too because they had 20 or 25% off. That was a reasonable good price then.  Have not tried all Namberjuices by now, only the Epiclouds doughnout pounder and the pineapple cake. Both taste very strong and intense - so nothing for me.

ecr_eu,3cddkh,keee,3,Tue Jul 7 01:08:20 2015 UTC,"I noticed the velocity can get quite warm, that said, it's not uncommen with higher gauge builds and higher wattages.   For instance, 6 wraps dual 28awg in a Derringer using a POM topcap on a cana... 3 pulls and it's overheated.   So I ordered some heatsinks on FT. This should help, it works great on the magma. For the top side of things, delrin drip tips FTW."
ecr_eu,3cddkh,sjugge,1 point,Tue Jul 7 07:45:44 2015 UTC,"I have also had this problem. The top of my aluminium box mod acts as a quite effective heat drain,pulling heat from the atty and heating up the box. I have been toying with the idea of making a delrin/teflon spacer, but I think it would break the 510's connection."
ecr_eu,3cddkh,gardvar,1 point,Tue Jul 7 07:02:54 2015 UTC,I've seen 510 extenders that allow you to mount the atty at a weird angle so I guess it's possible. goes fasttech hunting.  You just made me realise that it might be a purely external problem (the aluminium chassis of the IPV) - I'll do a test with the cover off today to see if the batteries actually get warm.

ecr_eu,3cccp7,AllRichC,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:00:50 2015 UTC,"Good review, the best way I can describe it is a creamy almond cuddle. The Strawberry is really subtle on this one (~30w), i've only had the one 15ml bottle of it last week. Sometimes the strawberry was there then sometimes it wasn't. Did you try having a toot at lower wattages? I found the strawberry being more pronounced at around 17w (1.2Ω Twisted 28 on my subtank mini) all be it a whispy-er smoke."
ecr_eu,3cefqw,DJRIPPED,3,Tue Jul 7 07:16:01 2015 UTC,"If your mod is doing any type of pre-heat / turbo / etc to quickly ramp up the heat then that might be an issue since it could greatly exceed your specified 13 watts for the first second or so.  The DNA 40 chip is quite accurate so as long as it's genuine then you should get 13 watts if you request 13 watts. But unregulated at 1.1 ohm on a fresh 4.2v battery is 16 watts and since that was fine I'm going to have to go with this being a wonky build or mesh roll.   There's also the chance that your previous box had an internal voltage drop, thus reducing the overall watts to below 13 watts but you didn't notice it. Now that you really are hitting 13+ watts your mesh roll isn't keeping up.  I've been working on my next mesh video, which will be mesh in drippers, for over a month now. When I say working I really mean slacking and putting it off. But the long and short of that video will be to use dual embedded wicks. A mesh roll inside the mesh roll. It enables the capillary action to play against each other greatly increasing wicking for scenarios where the negative pressure of the original genesis atomizers isn't present or is reduced. You might want to give that a shot."

ecr_eu,3cblha,burntoast333,5,Mon Jul 6 17:17:37 2015 UTC,"Great to see another Londoner here - Didn't realise there's a Liberty Flights shop in Fulham!  As /u/NovaVapes mentioned, you can get Vampire Vape concentrates so it's definitely worth getting some of those to try your hand at DIY (although their concentrates are quite pricey IMHO).  The problem with DIY is that there are so many different manufacturers to choose from so I'll attempt to give a quick run down of the most popular companies:   FlavourArt - Very potent concentrates with typical usage between 0.1 to 4%.  Highly recommend the Apple Fuji, Vienna Cream, Fresh Cream and Meringue.  I'd recommend picking them up from FA UK's site as they have a 6 flavour for £15 deal. TFA - Some good flavours but less potent than FA.  Typically usage is between 5 to 10% (apart from Cinnamon Red Hots and Banana Ripe which should be used at below 1%).  Since you mentioned you liked fruity vapes like Pinkman and Squid Ink, I'd recommend Strawberry Ripe and Banana Cream from these guys.  Chef's Vapour probably has the biggest selection of TFA in the UK. Capella - Some good flavours with typical usage between 2% and 10%.  Highly recommend the Vanilla Custard (since you liked Mum's Custard).  Go for the v2 if you're concerned about diketones but v1 tastes better.  Again Chef's Vapour is my go-to source for Capella. Inawera - Really realistic fruit concentrates that are quite potent (1 to 4%).  Highly recommend the raspberry concentrate if you like berries.  Again Chef's Vapour is my go-to source for Inawera."
ecr_eu,3cblha,overachiever,2,Mon Jul 6 19:00:22 2015 UTC,Great overview of the different manufactures! As some one who's planning on trying DIY soon this is really helpful.
ecr_eu,3cblha,Bahnhofsviertel,3,Mon Jul 6 23:11:55 2015 UTC,"I should mention there's a /r/diy_ejuice  Do use the sidebar and search function. Now al that will be overwhelming, the trick is to check their flavour top lists, there's also great recipe threads and flavour note threads. Top tip is to get ingredients that are 1) common and 2) used in top rated recipes, on ELR for instance.   ELR, e-liquid-recipes.com, is a great tool by /u/daath for your recipes, managing flavours and discovering flavours. It has a wealth of recipes, you can also find recipes you can make with the flavours in your stash.   My go to vendors for flavour, nic and base is pink-mule.com. Shipping is a bit steeper (pun intended) but the service, price and quality is top notch. Google for a coupon ;) I use Flaywer.de for flavours that I can't find on PM.   Cloudhousevapor.com also has concentrates and Base liquid which I found great for easy, one flavour, mixes. Nathan who runs CHV is also a top notch guy, you may see him around as /u/cloudhousevapor   Also, get a notepad. Take notes. Experiment. DIY is cheap, don't get discouraged if something doesn't taste well. I've been DIY-ing for over half a year and have maybe 5 recipes made that I love. I don't put a ton of time in it, but bit's OK to not make stellar recipes from the get-go. When you're stuck, try something different, mix some flavours you wouldn't expect to work. It just might, if not. Learn from it.  Take notes, and make sure you get to one or two ADV's quickly to make sure you can vape DIY while you learn the craft. That'll free up budget to invest into DIY instead of buying expensive juice."

ecr_eu,3cblha,goldfish_of_chaos,2,Tue Jul 7 06:20:07 2015 UTC,"You can get vamp vape Heisenberg & Pinkman concentrates.  Look on Chef's Vapour, Vapable, Justvape247... all good places for cons.   What I always recommend is for your first mix, use single concentrates. What I mean by that is it only needs one, heisenburg is a good example!  So grab some of that some silly rabbit cereal by The Flavour Apprentice / Perfumers Apprentice (one of my favourites) and you should be set to create a tasty juice!  You will be mixing to a percentage of flavouring in your bottle, you should find suggested % by googling about, for TFA I recommend 20% so that is 2ml for every 10ml or however you want to say it!  Any questions give me a shout :)  EDIT: Meant 20% for silly rabbit, % depends on concentrate. Some only require a low amount and some require higher!"
ecr_eu,3cblha,NovaVapes,2,Mon Jul 6 17:25:09 2015 UTC,20% for tfa? Manufacturer recommends 5-10% and I'd say 10 is even too much.

So the flavours would be: apple, a balance of both sweet and sharp/bitter apple depending on how sweet you want to take it. Fresh mint, has to be a fresh mint leaf taste. A big spike of fresh lime.  Raw cane sugar & white rum flavour.  Maybe a bit of cucumber if you're feeling cheeky.    Another one that works brilliantly as a drink and might as a vape is Pineapple Mojito: as above but pineapple juice instead of apple. never tried a pineapple flavour though, how natural do they taste?"

I wont try and facade away from the fact there seems to have been a mix up in QC at some point, not the first complaint we have receieved, I have not personally been there supervising the mix so I can't personally comment.  Let us know what we can do to set this right for you, I understand you are tired of waiting for juice, very sorry to hear that and that your online experiences with ourselves and other vendors hasn't been up to your expectation.  We do value our juice, and it should be up to the standard you expect every time, again I am incredibly sorry. Will make sure this is put right!"
ecr_eu,3cc6y6,NovaVapes,2,Mon Jul 6 22:41:37 2015 UTC,Got some earlier this week and same thing happened to me. In fact tropical glacier and sour fruit crush more or less tasted exactly the same except the sour fruit crush had menthol in it. Confusing.

Just as a general update, I have took tropical glacier off the store until we iron out the issue, it looks like to me there has been a small QC mishap and I am currently in the process of fixing it!  Tropical Glacier should become available at roughly 3PM UK time, currently vaping some of the batch no that has been having a small issue and can understand where all you are coming from with tropical glacier... THERES NO BLOODY MINT!  Currently speaking to our mixer, a very small mishap! He is being disciplined as we speak with a large chain and a phonebook.  Anyone with batch# RB11 please drop me a message with a picture of the batch number (just to confirm it, because our packaging assistant's handwriting is terrible! also side note: Going to start having batch no, VG/PG, nic printed)  Very sorry about this all guys, you have had the utmost patience and acceptance with all our mishaps and mistakes, and as a sub you are all incredibly welcoming and forgiving towards us vendors!   I do take full responsibility for what has happened, and we will do what we can to fix the issue, we are all incredibly sorry about this mistake and are currently ironing out ways to ensure it doesnt happen again!  RB10 and RB11 and currently up for recall, please follow the instructions above!"

It was actually switched with Sour Fruit Crush. I messaged them about it and they checked but saw no discrepancies in their logs... Might be the case with your bottles too."
ecr_eu,3cc6y6,vapourdepot,1 point,Mon Jul 6 19:59:15 2015 UTC,"Hmm, They are labelled correctly. There's no flavor to it . I thought I originally smelt candy-ish too sweet watermelon , but in actual fact it's just bland, I feel like of sick now after taking a couple of hits. I've smelt the bottle further and it's quite sickening the aroma.. I got it for the menthol, I'm extremely disappointed I hate waiting for juice lol because more often than not I run out before my order comes in and have to buy overpriced B&M stuff lol"

I think it's honeydew melon that I just can't vape, it just makes me feel sick every time. I've bought a few that I never knew had it in and each time I've just had to give it away and chalk it up to a certain flavour that just doesn't agree with me. I realise this isn't the problem you're having, just thought I'd share my experience with it!"
ecr_eu,3cc6y6,NovaVapes,2,Mon Jul 6 23:35:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah theres some melon in there, sorry to see that it wasn't agreeing with you! Guess this one boils down to the subjective taste thing!  Was there anything inherintly wrong with it? Or was it just a case of 'I dont like this juice'.   Unrelated, but we managed to get your replacements in the post today so you SHOULD receive it with todays post! some nice extras in there for you :D"

ecr_eu,3casdd,TheJackpot,2,Mon Jul 6 13:22:08 2015 UTC,Nice review and it's quite a nice addition to see a review of a cafe/store rather than just hardware / mods. I must remember to have a look when I'm visiting friends in Belfast.

ecr_eu,3casdd,hannibalateam,2,Mon Jul 6 18:01:17 2015 UTC,"I didn't really get much of a looksie at the hardware side of things, juice was definitely their focal point, but from the looks of their website they've got a reasonable selection of RDA's and RTA's available and a few mods, some exclusive stuff from Hellfire the Attysmith apparently, too.  Also, the most important product. Probably should have linked to the site in the main post but it wouldn't be right if I hadn't forgotten something, so I'll edit that in."
ecr_eu,3casdd,hannibalateam,2,Mon Jul 6 18:30:11 2015 UTC,"That's cool. Cheers for the laugh.

ecr_eu,3ca5xm,DarkestFayth,6,Mon Jul 6 08:30:23 2015 UTC,"Happy Birthday, /r/ecr_eu!  The consistent quality of the submissions on this sub is not only a testament to the caliber of our members, but also to our moderation team (who do all this foreground/background work pro bono).   One of the best things about this sub is that we have managed to maintain an almost entirely drama-free environment. People don't always agree on everything said, but it leads to discussion, and doesn't spiral into argument and vapid insults. This relatively small feat alone makes this sub such a pleasure to peruse and actively participate in.   At this point I would be remiss if I didn't point out just a few of the diligent members of our wonderful community.  /u/Eternal_Sunshine - For keeping us organised, creating threads which lead to interesting discussion and founding this community.  /u/Dumbgecko - For staying on top of vaping advocacy and keep us informed. Wednesday nights are forever brightened by his glorious bearded ramblings.   /u/ohwhatawittymoniker - For his whimsical juice reviews. Character assesment: A fine portrait of Joseph Ducreux.   /u/borez - For his 'The Week That Was In Vaping' submissions.   /u/Jimmith - For his iridescent artwork and tremendous visual reviews. He recently helped me personally by designing these business cards to hand out to vendors/people at expos.   /u/SirRisc - For his reviews and continued support in the Google Hangouts.  /u/fluffton - For being active and helpful on IRC (and for making mistakes on his hardware purchases - so I don't have to). Even if he doesn't know what an RDA is ;)  /u/sjugge - For his general PSAs, contribution in threads, and keeping us on top of the latest news/hardware. Always has his finger on the pulse.  /u/daath - For his work on e-Liquid Recipes - an invaluable tool for us DIYers.  /u/DarkestFayth - For her work in supporting the sub by creating and organising submissions like these, her general joie de vivre and bringing a healthy dose of levity to IRC.  And the many, many others who also deserve a mention!  And all of our sub vendors!  Namely:   /u/trstn (Spiritus Vapes)  /u/thechosenfewvapes (The Chosen Few)   /u/NovaVapes (Nova Vapes)  /u/vapourdepot (Vapour Depot)  /u/cloudhousevapor (Cloud House Vapor)   /u/langertony45 (Flavour Lab)   /u/Karmasutran (Liquid Voyage)  One thing that really distinguishes these guys from the vendors on other subs is that they all engage with the community outside of their work as businesses. It's such a breath of fresh air to see vendors that are interested in supporting the hobbyist community beyond simply selling their wares.   Apologies if this post comes across as a bit gushy or precious, but I really do appreciate the amount of work this community pours into this sub based around a hobby a hold so dearly.

To flourish you must take Riscs. If you strive to experience eternal sunshine you must have fayth that your career works out. Maybe you will find happiness in pets, and I'll tell you. Geckos make great pets, especially the dumb ones. Maybe the gecko eventually borez you. Then you can kill it with an iron hammer and get something with a little more fluffton. Like a sheep. Maybe then you will finally be happy. Conclusion, sheep = happiness.  Anyway thanks to everyone for making the first year of this subreddit so awesome. Cheers!"

ecr_eu,3cbjnh,hapticsquid,2,Mon Jul 6 17:14:48 2015 UTC,"The problem with that is we're not sure how good the TC will work on that mod, so it's better to hold off.  OP: I'm on the fence myself for the IPV4. I used to hate the looks, but the full black looks a lot better. The price is great. A few mishaps are always put in the spotlights, but the ones who have no issue aren't mentioned. So all in all, the IPV4 will be a solid device, if you're scared of the charge port, just remove it, there are tutorials out there. Or just wait a bit.

I've heard very good things about the yihi chipset, and joules makes a heck of a lot more sense to measure in since that's what we're ultimately using, but the dna40 impressed me more than I thought it would.  I'm also very happy that we're finally moving past the 18650s et alles, almost all of my own mobile (as in not pass-through mods) have used lipos. But that's a personal pet peeve that isn't directly related to your question. However, it is tangentially related since temperature limiting allows us to hit truly insane wattages fairly safely. More watts correlates to a direct need for more reliable power sources. Just rambling at this point but you get what I mean,"

ecr_eu,3capfq,xhozt,1 point,Mon Jul 6 19:48:45 2015 UTC,"I remember reading somewhere that the M80 TC is ""fake"" as in it just drops the wattage a certain amount bit by bit depending on the resistance when fired. This might be causing problems, I almost gave up with TC until I got an Invader Mini and an IPV4.  That aside, ceramic rods are a godsend. Fire the coils with the rods in, keeps them from warping if it gets too hot. If you're feeling adventurous Nickel claptons with kanthal inside are great, and way easier to work with once they're made and have a fairly high resistance for TC."
ecr_eu,3capfq,sjugge,1 point,Tue Jul 7 11:52:38 2015 UTC,"the M80 TC is ""fake"" as in it just drops the wattage a certain amount bit by bit    Sadly it's worse than that. The resistance is read when you push the fire button and it adjusts accordingly. The problem there is, if you want to use the mod again immediately to take another pull, it reads the resistance (which will be higher as the nickel is still warm) and then uses that as a base. So if I fire it till it gets to 420F and say, 1.1o resistance, if I fire it again it'll read 1.1o and then dump 6V of power into the coil burning the cotton to a cinder.  I'm going to invest in a proper TC unit and just keep the Smok M80 as a nice, cheap, 80W unit"
ecr_eu,3capfq,xhozt,1 point,Tue Jul 7 12:20:22 2015 UTC,It's a decent mod as a non-TC. Perfect size and power IMO. Just a shame that the TC was a failure because if it worked well I really wouldn't use anything else.
ecr_eu,3capfq,sjugge,1 point,Tue Jul 7 12:24:43 2015 UTC,Absolutely agree. I said further above I was going to return mine but I'm thinking about it and if I ignore the TC option then it's a decent 80W unit.

They don't leak down the needle after dripping either. Good for small RDA's or leaky bottom airflow RDA's that need precise dripping.

It's future proof enough to keep up with new atomizers for some time, and by the time I need to switch to something newer and flashier something else will have lasted my six month grace period and proven itself before I throw money at it."

Rated at 3000mAh and 20amps continuous.  I ran some tests with my sx mini, I get around 27k Joules w/ samsung 25r's and vtc5's, whereas the HG2's I'm hitting 32k/33k   Another interesting new battery is the Samsung 30Q, specced for 15A but seems to be able to easily handle 20A.

One of the neat things about the 350J is that it has a 'Joules counter' so you can see how many Joules you have put through your current battery.

Green Samsung 25r: -27,000 Joules  LG HG2: - 32,000 - 33,000 Joules  This seems to correspond with what other users have been experiencing with the HG2's.   I saw a test recently which compared the LG HG2 to the Samsung 30Q which suggested that the HG2 was a better choice if you weren't pushing the amp limits of the battery (in terms of battery life)."

I really rate Elements, great US premium juice at an OK price, by local B&M does them at £10 for 20ml.  Key Lime Cookie is wonderful, Strawberry Whip is one of the best strawberry-cream flavours I've tried. Watermelon Chill is a perfect summer vape.  I've only vaped the 80%VG ones in dripper so don't know how they'll be in a tank. Word of warning, they gunk coils and wicks really fast, have a look at them more often than you usually would."
ecr_eu,3c3ehl,ganjadan,3,Sat Jul 4 12:15:54 2015 UTC,It's weird how they managed to get the fizz taste in the lemonade. This juice has probably got me enjoying sub-ohm tanks.

ecr_eu,3c1dk5,borez,1 point,Fri Jul 3 22:09:56 2015 UTC,"yea, the TPD parts we're worried about wont be discussed in parlement.. The fight will probably be between shops and the ministry, many months after the law was passed.  We are in constructive talks with the anti-smoking organisations and they agree that it's insane that pipes and pipe-tobacco are less regulated than e-cigs. For the dutch: http://www.dampforum.nu/topic/26926-alliantie-nederland-rookvrij-longfonds-kwf-en-hartstichting/?p=638606"
ecr_eu,3c1dk5,borez,2,Fri Jul 3 22:28:33 2015 UTC,So how exactly are the planning to regulate a consistent nicotine dose? That is completely dependent on how many seconds you inhale. At 4 seconds the dose is different than at 6 seconds. Are they planning to have someone accompany vapers to make sure each and every one of us inhales for exactly the same amount of time? And not only does it depend on how many seconds you inhale but also the battery level. They can't stop a battery from depleting. I'm seeing some serious practical limitations to this consistent dose thing.

ecr_eu,3c229y,FarkMcBark,2,Sun Jul 5 04:51:44 2015 UTC,Hey.   We're awaiting confirmation about the clear kit. We will have the coloured kits for sale but I need one of the guys from cloudmaker to confirm about the clear before I can say for sure
ecr_eu,3c229y,vapourdepot,1 point,Sun Jul 5 06:17:28 2015 UTC,Thanks for the info on a Sunday! In any case the clear kit is only $4 extra from their own shop. I guess the cloudmaker guys are currently partying because of the 4th of July. BTW you should announce that you will be selling the whiteout on /r/cloudmaker  I guess 222.76 € isn't too bad a price if you consider shipping and VAT. BTW it would still be nice if you could offer € as a native currency :)  I'm very excited especially about the Whiteout OS. I want to help make the best mod firmware ever. So much potential.
ecr_eu,3c229y,FarkMcBark,1 point,Sun Jul 5 06:32:05 2015 UTC,"Totally. Im getting the DNA as soon as they come out, then will later switch out the chip to the Ares for Whiteout OS.   The price we have set is taking tax and duty in to account plus the 20% sales tax we have to pay to the tax man (jesus that's a lot of tax).  So although smog and cloudmaker will be cheaper, the people who dont like importing from the US have the piece of mind that they have no more tax or duty to pay if it's from us.   I think between cloudmaker themselves, smog dist and ourselves, we should be able to give the opportunity for any one to be able to get one :)  The Euros things... I'm working on it right now. So may be able to natively pay in euros or dollars sometime this morning :)"

I got roughly the same experience as you did, but I let it steep until a green tint fell into my juice and I got an orangey blackcurrant taste and the peppermint seemed to disappear, so when your juice gets that green tint, that's when you know its fully steeped"
ecr_eu,3c1xfu,wiener78,1 point,Sat Jul 4 09:44:21 2015 UTC,"Exactly, Nova themselves recommend allowing the juice to take on a green tint. I'm currently vaping their Sour Fruit Crush and will be buying another 30ml of Cobra Venom (and probably another undecided flavour) today!"
ecr_eu,3c1xfu,Zylias2,3,Sat Jul 4 10:56:08 2015 UTC,I'll say it now. Tropical Glacier is my joint favorite juice along with Thug Juice from MBV. Cobra Venom tasted better pre - steep for me I wasn't a fan of it after the full steep but it was still good if you know what I mean.  Tropical Glacier is beautiful I'm actually waiting for my order to come in. I see from your flair that you're Irish. As you know we get raped from International Shipping so NovaVapes is perfect for me.
ecr_eu,3c1xfu,hapticsquid,2,Sat Jul 4 11:37:46 2015 UTC,"I found that steeping juices, as you said above, definitely changes the flavour profiles, but I really liked the peppermint part of it so i likely won't steep the Cobra Venom at all. I've had mixed success with stepping personally. Some taste nicer, some taste nastier. I generally only steep now if my first reaction to a flavour is, ""hmmm, not quite right""."
ecr_eu,3c1xfu,NovaVapes,2,Sat Jul 4 16:40:22 2015 UTC,"Same here. I enjoyed it a lot both before and after it turned green, lovely juice, but I kind of missed the really smooth minty exhale which toned down some after it had steeped. Buying more soon, it's a great ADV."

The only thing that affects us is the lack of moderation tools which we've struggled with since the start, hence the IRC channels, and the mod Sub.   Going dark on a Niche sub isn't going to achieve any improvements on that anyway, so it's a far better choice that you've chosen to focus on important topics.

And it's fuel for the anti's IF harm is proven.   ecigs are a risk, but the alternative is smoking. Pure harm reduction.  DA is a risk but the alternative is to buy another flavor or reformulate the liquid. would a vaper back switch to cigs if there's no DA in the liquid? Not pure harm reduction.

But thankfully it stagnates over the topics which are so heavily complained about elsewhere, we're free from vendor spam and advertisments which has always been a key point for this sub since it's humble beginings.   Just keep doing what you're doing, and we'll head forward as always.  I've watched the Sub grow, taken part in everything I could, been invited to the mod team and watched over everything, and then sat in the background overviewing the sub as a whole and reading things but refraining from commenting.   I feel like I've gone full spectrum within this Sub, and it's a community I fell in love with and am still in love with, hopefully able to reintegrate comment wise and contribution wise some more.   I look forward to the future, and hope we can plan something as a community to counter the TPD together."

There's a nice mix of questions, reviews, how-to posts, articles and general chit chat as well as a decent input from some of our resident vendors without it becoming a vendors' sub. And I haven't seen a single cloud chasing video yet!  Obviously getting more people active on the sub would be a good thing but I actually think that activity is at quite a nice level in many ways. There's pretty much always a new thread (or old thread) that can be contributed to without there being 55 new threads and 4,000 new comments when I log in which I actually can find to be a off putting on bigger subs to be honest (though I guess that's very much a personal preference).

Sometimes you find yourself with a question that sometimes feels like it doesn't warrant a thread of its own, maybe because it's only a quick question or because you're worried it may have been asked before, so a newbie thread would be a great idea. Maybe a new one every month which remains stickied at the top of the sub?"

I haven't been around from inception, but by going through older threads and seeing things being handled the last months I'd say well done. But with a side note that you'll probably want to keep an eye out for scaling challenges. It makes it easier for things to fall through cracks and trolls thrive on that.   For the rest I thinks this sub is very civilised, while knowing when to unleash the funny and whit. Something global doesn't always get.

High VG liquids are really designed with rebuildable atomisers in mind.   Max vg can also be something of a misleading term and it relates to using the maximum amount to VG as a dilutant as such what you could have is a 50/50 juice called max vg due to the nic being PG based and the rest being flavourings and VG.  i would suggest checking out our IRC channel in the sidebar, the people there will be able to help answer your questions if you would like a fast answer"

ecr_eu,3c08v4,Dumbgecko,2,Fri Jul 3 19:56:24 2015 UTC,"Well, a lot of Max VG juices will use aqueous VG, so they won't be quite as viscous and 'pure' VG mixes"

ecr_eu,3c08v4,trstn,1 point,Sun Jul 5 16:11:25 2015 UTC,"Thanks, takes a lot of effort but I think I've found some great flavours.  Some of the bombies are thicker than others, I've used all of them in tanks without many issues but they definitely wick a little slower in the nautilus et al. No issues with subtanks for me though and so long as you don't hammer them they're fine in tanks that were aimed more at pg flavours.  Grizzly flavours definitely seem 'thinner' than bombies and again, fine in all tanks.   I have some Max VG here I'm just flavour testing from another brand and they're very viscous, wick OK but yeah, thick as anything so this definitely isnt AVG.  You should be fine with bombies and grizzly though :)"

I've been using it with the regular coils for 5 months and seldom had a dry hit unless I am really chain vaping it pretty hard, or when the coil head is done and ready to change. It has big juice slots (and adjustable), I use it fully open with 70%VG all day, no troubles.  Flavour sweet spot for me is 30-35W on kanthal 0.5ohm but it will keep up at higher watts. Flavour is great, busardo's comparison test rated it on par with the Subtank Mini.    Joyetech have just released Ni coil heads for it, I started using them this week with the Invader Mini and really like them, noiw I don't want to go back to the regular ones. A cooler vape than on kanthal (that's how it is with TC I'm told) but not a hint of a hot or dry hit and the flavour is a little better too.    Delta 2 does have its quirks: some say filling can be a little awkward but you get used to it, it doesn't bother me anymore. The airflow sometimes whistles if you don't have it fully open. The RBA head costs extra money and is a bit shit, don't bother with it. You should able to find one cheap now too.  Only place I've found the Ni coils in UK though is Joyetech's UK webstore."

Normally when I fill the juice channels with cotton and I fill up the tank I have to blow out a little bit of the excess juice through the airflow but I didn't get any of that with this. It's also wicking really well, haven't had a dry hit (not that I normally do anyway) and no leaking or anything as of yet. It was also quicker to do, no mess and less hassle.  The real test for me will be if the wicking keeps up in a few days. I find normally after two or three days1 I end up having to rewick due to dry hits.  This is how I used to wick my Kayfun and exactly how I would have wicked the Cthulhu if I hadn't done some research before getting it."

I saw a few people on ECR saying they had the same problem and said it might be because the cotton is getting gunked up and not wicking as effectively. Maybe less gunked up cotton in the juice channels will help wicking?

ecr_eu,3bxsy4,Sidebard,1 point,Sat Jul 4 02:30:56 2015 UTC,"I use a slightly modified version of Trevor Jones' Goblin wicking method (trim top parts of wick as much as possible after pushing plenty of cotton into juice channels) and haven't had any dry hits, leaks or issues chain vaping but I exclusively use 30PG/70VG blends. I've had leakage (quite major leakage as well) with 50/50 or below - I've come to the conclusion that given the fact you also get hardly any vapour from the Cthulhu with lower VG liquids that using high VG is best for the Cthulhu."
ecr_eu,3bxsy4,FarkMcBark,1 point,Sat Jul 4 11:11:54 2015 UTC,"So, I tried it, and my conclusion is that it is highly liquid dependent.  Flavour is not better (I dont consider possibility of chain vaping without getting worse flavour as better flavour) than with Ironhammers method.  With thicker Eliquid you might not get leakage or only a couple of drops after filling with this method - while you get none if you'd stuff the channels.  With 50/50 or even part ionized water there seems to be no way around some initial spillage. After that the situation also seems to be very fragile: after I thought it was safe and went with it outside where it was warm and it started running again.  So, my 2 cents: if you have problems with thicker liquids, maybe it helps. Personally I can only recommend Ironhammers wicking method which is also safe with thinner liquids."

ecr_eu,3bw8r4,Crompee01,3,Fri Jul 3 07:31:47 2015 UTC,"Skim reading it, main points I can see:  Eliquid can only be sold in a maximum size of 10mil and maximum strength of 20mg. Nothing about nicoteen in general, so diy'ing actual looks to be OK?  No colouring allowed in eliquid.  Only High Purity Ingredients allowed in eliquid, presume pharma grade?  Nicoteen is the only ingredient allowed in eliquid which is dangerous for humans. Trace amounts of random things are allowed if unavoidable.  Child resistant tops, tamper proof bottles and packaging cannot look like a food or drink product (to stop children drinking it).  Ensure the device can be refilled without leaking. Not sure what this means, hopefully nothing too bad but worded like all tanks could be banned?  Secretary if state can ban any product at a whim basically.  UK can stop us from buying products from abroad and even if they don't ban it, any company wishing to sell to the UK market needs to register what they wish to sell to secretary of state.   All ecig or eliquid vendors need to register with secretary of state and send reports on all products they sell and yearly updates. Not 100% sure on what all this means.  That's all I could find on a quick run through."
ecr_eu,3bw8r4,trstn,7,Thu Jul 2 21:08:04 2015 UTC,"It's not reasonable.  Leak proof attys means a sealed atomiser with a leak proof filling mechanism. If it opens then it can leak - the tpd means filling mechanisms like on gas lighters - NO atomiser on the market is tpd compliant.  Do you like drippers, because they're gone. Like tanks you can rebuild? Gone too.  The Max size of this as yet not designed magic atomiser will be 2ml.  Diy is also gone - how will you make liquids with 20mg nic base?  Pharma grade ingredients; how many pharma grade flavourings have you heard of? Flavours, gone.   MHRA will regulate flavours and devices, if I wanted to try and get my stock through accreditation I'm looking at a couple million pounds and that's assuming everything passes first go.  The tpd is the end of vaping as we know it. Literally. We MUST make the most of this last opportunity to stop it."
ecr_eu,3bw8r4,pannamix,1 point,Thu Jul 2 23:00:20 2015 UTC,"Lets not get ahead of ourselves and end up trying to stop legislation that isnt even proposed. You seem to be arguing for what we thought the legislation would be rather than what it is now we can look at it.  Leak Proof attys does not mean that it cant open to refill. It just cant leak once its sealed, thats why they're limiting the amount of nicoteen allowed in bottles to 20mg. The wording is ambiguous but i highly doubt there proposed changes bans basically everything.  There is no max size in the proposal that i saw?  DIY isnt gone, theres no changes into the base nicoteen strength from 72mg that i saw. Only Eliquid is capped at 20mg and 10mil.  It doesnt say pharma grade ingredients, only high quality. This probably does mean pharma grade nicoteen which it should be anyway and the only other stipulation is that only nicoteen can be harmful, so no flavourings with nasty stuff in.  All i can see as far as regulating flavours, is that you need to fill in paperwork detailing whats in your liquid. So to play devils advoate, are you selling eqliuid for the purposes of inhaling without even knowing whats in it? You won't need to pay for every juice to be tested, just everyone clubs together to pay for the flavourings to be tested, then you know whats in it.  Im for protesting this legislation but lets protest whats really in there, rather than protesting hyperbole stuff."
ecr_eu,3bw8r4,Frisky_Frogs,5,Fri Jul 3 14:12:58 2015 UTC,"I wish you were right, honestly, but you're dead wrong. Vaping is my livelihood, it feeds my children and I've done extensive research into what the TPD means for us and this proposed implementation isn't significantly different from the full TPD. To respond to two specific points...   Leak Proof attys does not mean that it cant open to refill.   Of course it does. Anything that opens can leak. Can you name a single atomiser that you have ever used that hasn't leaked on you at least once? Because I can't. A new proprietary filling mechanism will need to be designed and any atomiser not using it will not be legal.   All i can see as far as regulating flavours, is that you need to fill in paperwork detailing whats in your liquid.   And put them through emissions toxicology and cytotoxicity testing. Which is bound to be cheap isn't it? No, it's likely to be around £30,000 per variant (one flavour at one strength is one variant). If I wanted to get my stock through I'm looking at £2,400,000 and that's assuming I only wanted to have ONE strength in stock. (it also assumes they all passed first test, if they didn't then you can double or triple or quadruple or more that figure).  The data system to manage the information will have a total set-up cost of will be £30,000 and a recurring annual cost of £22,000.  Get it wrong or fail to keep things up to date or have any non-approved e-liquid in stock: two years in prison.  Let's forget everything except the testing regiment. How many vendors do you think can afford that? If you think it's anyone except big tobacco then you're crazy. EVERY vendor and juice maker in the UK will be shut down by this."

From the article:  ...the lowest quantity of an analyte that can be distinguished from the absence of the analyte is called the limit of detection (LOD). The lowest amount of an analyte which can be quantitatively determined with suitable precision and accuracy is known as the limit of quantification (LOQ).

ecr_eu,3bx383,overachiever,1 point,Fri Jul 3 09:20:36 2015 UTC,<LOD would mean they cannot detect it at all. LOQ means it is below the range where they can accurately determine how much was there. This will be a good bit higher than LOD.

ecr_eu,3bw9qx,SpunkingMonkey,4,Thu Jul 2 17:52:08 2015 UTC,"Relevant: /u/tfeldt's general and genius genny guidelines.   I would suggest using thinner kanthal and more wraps but that would be my move, based on guessing.   Edit: derp'd the link"
ecr_eu,3bw9qx,sjugge,3,Thu Jul 2 18:23:36 2015 UTC,"I'm quite partial to 0.4mm myself, partly for the flavour profile it provides but what sjugge said is correct. Try using a thinner wire and more wraps, particular gennies are very susceptible to different amounts of wraps. This is almost always directly related to how it handles its airflow. Some demand less than 5, some just won't work with less than 5. Experiment with the overall resistance as well, some gennies love 0.5, some perform better around 1.2.  Unfortunately I have zero experience with welding wire, I only use kanthal. Your problems might very well be related to the wire itself, but from what I've read it should work fine.  But in general, a decrease in flavour intensity means one out of three things. The airflow is not correctly guided to the coils, the wick is actually shorting even though you might not notice it or the wick isn't wicking fast enough (but if your wick goes dry you'd -definitely- notice it).  One last ditch idea, try some different juices. I've heard of these mythical ones that just don't work in gennies. But it being reduced to just a wisp of flavour seems unlikely."
ecr_eu,3bw9qx,TFeldt,2,Thu Jul 2 19:44:12 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply, as I just mentioned in my reply to sjugge I'm a touch limited on wire ATM till my next order comes in!   It's certainly not dry-hitting (ss mesh dry hits are pure evil..) But I will experiment with wraps and see if that can solve my issue.   In my experience ss 317l performs much like a lower res ka1, taste wise I feel they are very similar, so I'm fairly confident it's not too much of an issue? (I could be wrong though, gennies are a whole new ball game for me!)"

Praise be to him, for his shininess will light thy path.. or at least it will eventually. Mesh is commonly referred to as a black art as you just ""feel it"" eventually. It's always a pain when one first starts out but you'll get there, and it'll be glorious.  One final thing I forgot before. Make sure you pick your wire in accordance with your mesh. For 325 or lower you want to use 0.4mm or thicker. For 400 or higher you might want to go up to 0.3 or even 0.2mm for higher densities."
ecr_eu,3bw9qx,iprefervaping,1 point,Thu Jul 2 22:31:04 2015 UTC,I did originally try 0.21mm ka1 (I've run my wire collection dry ATM so am limited till my next order gets in!)

ecr_eu,3bw9qx,iprefervaping,3,Thu Jul 2 20:57:15 2015 UTC,Hello - I've been a genesis user for many years but haven't tried the Nextgen. Perhaps some of these general tips will help you though:  Generally genesis atomisers have a Goldilocks situation going on - everything must not be too tight or too loose.  So with the coil - it needs to be wrapped round the mesh where every part of the coil is touching the mesh but not too tight as this strangles the wick and for some reason gives it a tasteless vape. I suspect your coils may be too tight. Too loose and parts not touching the mesh and you get the acrid taste.  With the wick you have to make sure the wraps are enough to form a tube but not so much that you are adding many layers as then the liquid can't seep out through the layers onto the coils.  The wick also has to go in the wick hole is such a way that the wick is just touching the sides of the wick hole so there is only slight resistance pushing the wick into the wick hole otherwise it doesn't wick well.  Edit:  A further thing I've thought of - I use various kanthal gauges so use more or less wraps depending on what kanthal I have lying around and it doesn't make much of a difference for me how many wraps I have. What does make a difference though is how far apart the wraps are. I have to make sure the wraps are not touching but only about a mm apart.
ecr_eu,3bw9qx,dnaq,2,Thu Jul 2 19:59:15 2015 UTC,"I have to say I feel you may be bang on the money here.   Every build has had the wire very very tight on the wick.

I'd recommend twisting the 30 gauge wire, which you can either do with a drill if you have it, or if not using a coffee mug. Basically get a strand of the 30, loop it through the handle and hold it up with some pliers, and then spin it around until the wire breaks (Do this over something soft to avoid breaking the mug)  Then wrap it as normal, not sure what size rods you have to wrap it but 7  wraps around a 3mm rod will get you around 1.2 ohms.

ecr_eu,3bvahc,sjugge,2,Thu Jul 2 23:52:12 2015 UTC,"I tend to place mine as much in front of the airholes as possible. I think the velocity this means there's quite a bit of wick going down, but I've had no issues with that so far."

I have my coils level with the airhole about half way between post and air hole, with cotton packed left and right of them, and a clear air pathway only over and below the coil through to the drip tip, if that makes sense.  Having the coil closer to the posts will increase throathit, closer to the air hole will reduce it.  Similarly having the coil higher so that more air passes beneath than over will increase throat hit, a lower coil will reduce it.  Hope that helps :)"

ecr_eu,3bvahc,trstn,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:07:35 2015 UTC,"Oh definitely. You also have to keep in mind that the higher up or further out the coil the greater the chance of hitting the cap and getting a short (so be careful with mechs). It's a balancing act and every atomiser is different but in theory...   A high coil close to the post = maximum TH Low coil close to post = high medium TH (chance of spitting up the drip tip) High coil close to airhole = low medium TH (chance of spitting out of side) A low coil close to air hole = minimum TH   It's not going to be the same for every atomiser, but it seems to be at least a little bit consistent to me. Of course if you take something like the Squape R your choices are more limited.    Normal coil placement = good vape slightly too low coil placement = flooding through air hole slightly too high coil placement = dry hits   :)"
ecr_eu,3bvahc,TheBadStick,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:26:50 2015 UTC,"Your experience with the Squape seems similar to mine with the Zephyrus, but my problems are caused by trying to find the exact placement and quantity of cotton.

ecr_eu,3bwbj1,vapourdepot,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:24:49 2015 UTC,Sorry - I just realised the Cthulhu RTA doesn't have replaceable coil heads. The idea is I would rebuild several of the heads myself (as its for my brother who isn't as technical) and he could just switch them out when the coil dies.
ecr_eu,3bwbj1,vapourdepot,2,Thu Jul 2 18:30:45 2015 UTC,That's probably my fault for misunderstanding.   I don't think its that easy on most devices I've used - you either need to have a few spare RBA sections or some knowledge of re-building
ecr_eu,3bwbj1,vapourdepot,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:32:21 2015 UTC,I have no problem with rebuilding. I am a genesis atomiser user myself and have rebuilt coil heads for stardust clearomisers in the past. I just need a good tank atomiser where its easy to rebuild individual heads.

ecr_eu,3bwbj1,shirlyzhu,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:20:18 2015 UTC,I'm thinking something like an aspire nautilus - replaceable coil heads I can rebuild myself (around 1.5ohm) that is easily fillable.  For the battery I'm looking for something regulated like an eleaf - just a decently sized battery for out and about - doesn't have to have the option to change voltage.
ecr_eu,3bwbj1,metans,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:23:59 2015 UTC,"Ah, so you're not actually rebuilding the coils, just replacing them? That's cool, just wanted to be sure before I recommend something. /u/vapourdepot has recommended a good mod but the Cthulhu requires you to rebuild your own coils. The subtank mini is a regular recommendation for a tank with replacable coils but I'm not to familiar with the latest and greatest clearomisers. /u/vapourdepot sells them (and is trusted around these parts) so should point you in the right direction :-)"

ecr_eu,3bu5s8,vapourdepot,1 point,Fri Jul 3 04:16:58 2015 UTC,"Curious here, which version is everyone excited about?  I think I'll pick up the dna200 when they go on sale in the morning but the Ares OS sounds really interesting."
ecr_eu,3bu5s8,sjugge,1 point,Thu Jul 2 13:56:24 2015 UTC,"Judging by the sales on Smog Distribution and talk on various subreddits, I'd say that people are most excited about the DNA 200 version right now.   The SX version does seem to be quite popular as it's using the 350j which by now is a tried and tested chip - if I didn't already own an SX Mini M Class, the choice between the DNA 200 and SX models might be slightly more difficult. Purely because Yihi's SX350J provides guaranteed stability whilst the DNA 200, being in its infancy and Evolv's track record with the DNA40, does not.  In the end, if the DNA 200 does all that it purports to do, and does it well, then it will be a better, more functional chip. Another factor to consider is that the DNA 200 requires a minimum input voltage of 9 volts which means you are limited to either LiPos or a 3x18650 configuration. People are still wary about LiPo safety (despite the fact that practically everyone carries them around all day), and a box that can accommodate 3x18650 batteries is too large to be functional for most people.  I will be getting an ARES kit once they become available, although from what I've heard the software Evolv is providing with the DNA 200 also allows you to do a great deal of tinkering (Everything from adjusting preheat to setting a specific temperature coefficient based on the type of wire you are using to UI and 'personalisation' tweaks)."

ecr_eu,3buiov,Lavalamb,2,Thu Jul 2 13:42:38 2015 UTC,"Have been a subscriber for 4 months. At £35 a pop for at least 65 mls of what I would consider 'premium' juice you are usually getting 5 15ml bottles, and the cost of those individually is usually £8-£10 so you make a saving of £15 on average per box. The flavour preferences are pretty good and you can also attach additional notes to further narrow down those preferences as you find what you like. The random factor is double edged, sure you might not like every bottle you get, but if you don't have a good local BnM then whenever you buy juice online its always 'random' or based on good reviews by people who likely have completely different palettes to yourself. So far I have to say it's been a pleasant experience and has helped me find juices that I loved but would of never considered buying."
ecr_eu,3buiov,Daztastic,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:31:38 2015 UTC,I used it and wasn't overly thrilled with it.

ecr_eu,3briun,TFeldt,3,Wed Jul 1 20:52:42 2015 UTC,"Going to interject here, and Josh please don't think I'm trying to be an arse and correct you. Your summary is accurate, that is basically what the show contains. But there's history here that should be brought up.  Russ created the initial diacetyl and ap awareness by testing suicide bunny juices last year. He did this after contacting several different companies, all saying they would provide the information. When some didn't he picked one, a very popular one, suicide bunny. The related episodes are:  https://soundcloud.com/vp-live/is-suicide-bunny-chock-full-of-diacetyl-the-vapemania-dust-up?in=vp-live/sets/the-click-bang-archives  https://soundcloud.com/vp-live/suicide-bunny-e-liquids-test-positive?in=vp-live/sets/the-click-bang-archives  https://soundcloud.com/vp-live/suicide-bunny-e-liquid-tests-positive-again-in-new-lab-results-abolish-the-death-penalty?in=vp-live/sets/the-click-bang-archives  Five pawns was one of the companies that said they were doing the testing and would get back to Russ. They never did. Now we know why. What this episode of his show mainly focused on was how 5P knew what the result were but did nothing. They saw what went one with suicide bunny, yet they did nothing. They were tested by a third party and instead of doing something positive, they initiated legal action.  That's why he was so upset in this episode, they had so many chances to be the good guys and this is what 5P ultimately ended up doing."

ecr_eu,3bqco5,borez,12,Wed Jul 1 08:13:26 2015 UTC,"""The common argument for e-cigarettes is that they are an aid to smokers who wish to stop smoking.  ""This is not supported by the only scientifically-led investigation to date of this concept, which shows that e-cigarettes are not more effective than existing nicotine replacement therapies (gums, patches, etc) in helping individuals to stop smoking.    Damn that make me angry, it's blatant bullshit propaganda by big pharma as they're losing business to e-cigs. Thousands of people have quit smoking using e-cigarettes where other therapies failed. Quite a few of them here."
ecr_eu,3bqco5,JimmerUK,3,Wed Jul 1 08:13:55 2015 UTC,There are a tonne of studies which show that the majority of people who use traditional NRTs go back to smoking after a few months. The opposite is true of e-cigs.   Just because the authors of the advice aren't aware of the studies doesn't mean they don't exist.   I believe ASH has a great report and presentation on the effects of e-cigs in helping people give up. Worth a read.

ecr_eu,3bqlhk,jarosan,3,Wed Jul 1 10:23:19 2015 UTC,"I can relate to this because it sounds like me in the shop when I was first buying juice...I wanted tobacco flavour please, nothing at all sweet.    The thing with tobacco flavour in e-liquid is it isn't going to taste like the flavours you get from burning tobacco. It's more like the taste of the smell of a freshly opened packet of tobacco or a box of cigars. That can be nice or it can quite often be harsh when you heat it up on a coil (cheap tobacco liquids are particularly nasty), or just a bit bland and hollow and not very satisfying after a while vaping it.    That's why a lot of tobacco flavours get blended with other things so the tobacco is the base note - like the many RY4 variants and the two you've tried, and most of them are sweet. Manabush is good but they can be really sweet too - if you're getting one from that range then try Nokomis, the others are going to be too sweet for your friend I think. that one might be too. For a good and balanced non-sweet blend try www.bjuice.co.uk , Golden Child (golden virginia style base) and Father Gallon (dark tobacco base, kind of Drum dark blue). Also their Beetlejuice is incredible but it's a Perique tobacco which is a bit of an acquired taste, worth trying though. These blend in notes of spices, aromatics, things like little spikes of citrus or anise. None of the extra elements are dominant or sweet though. I really like them, vape them all day.  They do sampler packs.    I've also heard good things about SnG Roughrider (from Cloud House Vapor), have some on the way so not tried it yet.    El Toro from House of Liquids already mentioned is worth a try too."

This balances out the flavor muting you get from higher VG. If you really like strong flavors you can add more, but I find that it can throw off the flavors if you add too many."

ecr_eu,3bsfc0,maniacpsycho,7,Wed Jul 1 19:44:34 2015 UTC,Well I'm not sure if I would allow vaping if I owned a company either. Building or designating special sites costs lots of money. Some people might be annoyed. Some people might abuse it and fog out rooms.  I'm even annoyed if someone eats something smelling good at their desk. Even if I like the flavor but it's distracting.  I guess the most sensible policy would be to allow it as long as no one in the room objects to it.

They're all built to have large airflow to cool down even the lower ohm builds. With that said the Cthulhu is the only one I've dared take above 70W so far, the Goblin seems to heat up a fair bit quicker.  The Cthulhu has similar performance to a dripper really, especially in terms of juice consumption I'd even dare say it's a bit on the voracious side."

ecr_eu,3bp1dx,Dumbgecko,0,Wed Jul 1 16:58:53 2015 UTC,"The Little Boy RDA has fairly good airflow, but I'm not entirely sure you've grasped the concept of vaping. Why do you want to vape at 80 watts? Almost any tank should be able to handle it, dependant upon what coils you put in it. Vaping at higher wattage doesn't strictly mean better vape, and in reality if you want to vape at 80 watts, you'd probably want a hexa coil build or something otherwise you're gonna end up burning your wick out and dry hitting a lot, as well as burning off your liquid instead of vaporising it properly.  That's not to say 80 watts won't work on a single coil build, but to say that your build would need to be something special to handle it properly. People don't tend to buy an atty that can handle a certain wattage, but one that they can build as they see fit (aka fit a certain size of coil in, or wick in a certain way). To say that you want a tank that can handle at least 80 watts is a bit like saying you want a fridge that can hold at least 40 blocks of cheese. Your cheese could be various shapes and sizes, as could the fridge. You'll always be able to fit 40 blocks of cheese in the fridge, provided they are the right size. The mechanics are similar, anyway. What you're asking for isn't entirely rational."
ecr_eu,3bp1dx,vapourdepot,2,Wed Jul 1 00:08:25 2015 UTC,I've been vaping for 3 years now. But latest year I've been using dripper and to get lovely heat from it I used it at around 60-80 watts. I got bored with the overly complicated coils so I used basic dual coils in dark horse. I got bored to always filling the dripper and thought there are better tanks nowadays so I just want tank with same sensation as with dripper.  Edit. So that's 1 year without tanks. Sorry if I'm bit out of the loop.

ecr_eu,3bm9km,Dumbgecko,13,Tue Jun 30 10:43:44 2015 UTC,"So their own test results are lower but do contain diacetyl. But they haven't released any AP stats. If they're so sure it's safe, why not just release the numbers and let us make up our own minds if we want to vape their liquids or not?  ""Five Pawns does not feel there is any concern with diacetyl or AP in our e-liquids at current levels.  AP can be an important flavor enhancer for flavor profiles that are creamy in nature, and is used widely in the food and beverage industries.""  That pretty much made their stance crystal clear and will ensure I never touch another one of their bottles, test or no test. If other people don't care about diacetyl or AP, more power to you. I do care and it's an easily avoidable risk, or potential danger if you will, that I intend to stay well away from.  This just isn't how you do it. Issuing gag orders when someone posts something you don't like. You post evidence that proves their claim is false, then you sue them for damages. Removing third party tests from the internet and deleting facebook posts that mention them.. yeah."
ecr_eu,3bm9km,TFeldt,2,Tue Jun 30 11:55:19 2015 UTC,Is there a list somewhere of companies that use diacetyl and/or AP? I really enjoy some MBV flavours but I couldn't find anything about their stance on the subject. The Chosen Few (another company I enjoy) is very open about the subject and FlavourLab only uses natural extracts so MBV is the only company that I use where I'm not certain what's actually in it.

""That being said, when you buy from Mt Baker Vapor we use the highest quality, finest ingredients from right here in the US, which means we can make sure that they are all diacetyl free. While the studies discussed above do not substantiate a concern for utilizing diacetyl in e-juice, we choose not to purchase from suppliers that use it in their flavoring."" - http://blog.mtbakervapor.com/the-truth-about-diacetyl/  Unfortunately there isn't a list like this, and there really should be. Vaporshark made a big splash a while back by testing every juice they have in their inventory. That's probably the closest thing we have to a reference list along with the now removed c9v one. But it's very US centric since they're an american distributor, many of our juices over here aren't something they'd carry.  Unfortunately we're reduced to the simple option of not buying juices where the makers haven't had them tested and willingly offer the information."

ecr_eu,3bm9km,borez,6,Tue Jun 30 14:08:24 2015 UTC,"While making a valid point for how testing is done, there's a strong whif of bs throughout the article. They're trying to make decent points but some choices of phrasing and words leave quite a bit of room to bury the nasty. I'm also surprised this is the first I hear on their efforts on testing, but that may just be me.   I personally never tried 5P and my stance on that has not changed today."
ecr_eu,3bm9km,sjugge,4,Tue Jun 30 12:26:28 2015 UTC,"Agree. And 5P may well have a valid counter-argument here...but what staggers me is kicking off with the word 'fraudulent' to describe what C9 have done. Seriously? That a test methodology may or may not demonstrate something conclusively...one can and should argue reasonably about that based on evidence. But suggesting that a small UK vendor is manipulating test results or their presentation in some way because presumably they must have an axe to grind against 5P, and how very dare they disagree with this mighty US juice company? Come off it, what possible agenda could C9 have for that? They'd have more to gain by continuing to sell 5P regardless, or by not testing it at all (done, by the way at their own expense because they are concerned about customer safety in an industry that is still mostly self-regulated).  'Potentially misleading'...maybe, maybe not. 'Fraudulent'?....pffftt...  I haven't tried 5P. I wanted to but it's too pricey. If this is an example of their company culture, they can Foxtrot Oscar, they've lost a potential customer regardless of whether they are in the right here or not."
ecr_eu,3bm9km,hapticsquid,3,Tue Jun 30 15:04:13 2015 UTC,"Five Pawns, being a premium brand, would be a natural fit for C9V's product range. They've been testing all the juices they sell since 2011 via an independent accredited test lab. If people are seriously suggesting that they have something to gain by manipulating test results, they need to come up with a plausible reason not just for why they would want to do it, but how.  I've seen the lab test result PDF's, from a lab based in West Yorkshire. All the samples sent for test were ostensibly 3mg, but the nicotine content ranged from 1.8mg up to 3.7mg, which is WAY beyond the +/-9% range that ECITA recommend, and would have been reason enough to pull the entire range on its own. The VG/PG ratios were similarly variable. Given these discrepancies, I find levels of DA/AP totally believable.  The thing that got my goat was that 5P start by saying that there is no standardised way of testing, and that until there is, publishing results is ""reckless and liable"" - AND THEN PUBLISH THEIR OWN RESULTS!  The second utterly irresponsible thing in the 5P blog was that they claimed ""AP has not been linked to any health concerns"", which is just a plain lie. CDC say ""A recent NIOSH peer-reviewed publication documents that acute inhalation exposures to 2,3-pentanedione cause airway epithelial damage that is similar to diacetyl in laboratory studies (Hubbset al. 2012)""  This is irresponsible in the extreme, and is actively putting their customers health at risk for the sake of profit. Disgraceful.  I have no connection to C9V, and have never even bought from them."

ecr_eu,3bm9km,Limbeckx,8,Tue Jun 30 11:14:11 2015 UTC,"The problem is this. First they complain about there is no standard way to test.

Then they commence to put forward their own results eventhough there is no standard for doing the tests in the first place.   So it is ok for 5P to do a non standard test but not for C9V?

It definitely seems that the right thing to do is to issue a cease and desist, and that's what any company would do in the circumstances. If they decide to persue the case further and claim that false information was spread which is detrimental to their reputation, then there's something to start shouting about.  No idea what C9V have said on the issue as there isn't a whole lot published, but if there were mistakes in the testing procedure that might explain away something. If their testing truly demonstrates the results people claim (2.1mg/ml nic level in a 3mg/ml liquid), then someone really needs to take legal action against C9V for misselling goods. There are requirements to be accurate with descriptions of products, and that must be outside of those requirements.  IMO, though, fuck them all. DIY or GTFO :)"

If you're pushing the specs of the device, I wouldn't use it as a passthrough. The USB port, your adapter or outlet may not be able to supply the output the device will pull. Additionally you're adding a lot of failure points in the mix, which increases any and all risks.   I personally stopped charging any batteries except with my trusted chargers that have appropriate bits and pieces to hook up to the wall outlet. When I'm in a pinch I'll use an external battery to charge the battery while in the mod, but that's exceptional.  Additionally, I don't do passthrough unless I'm desperate.

First thou, I don't know where you got 35A. The chip outputs ""continous 16A, Peak 23A"" I don't see hot the device could output more than that.  Pros:   Big voltage span allows higher ohm coils. High quality reliable construction. Clean functional design. Beautiful machining, flush fits and good finish. No door issues (you might just have been unlucky).  TC works like a charm. Long warranty Affordable   Cons:   A little on the heavy blocky side, a little cumbersome to have as a ""out and about"" vape. I dropped mine and the chip cover flew of breaking my warranty seal. Atty not centered, not really a big issue, but it messes with my self diagnosed OCD ;P There is no overhang tho so that's good. last but NOT least. Changing temp in TC is a hassle! This, however is not on hcigar but on evolv. And something that I am hoping they fix soon. It should be changeable just the same way wattage is in regular mode."
ecr_eu,3bjv8h,gardvar,1 point,Mon Jun 29 22:55:51 2015 UTC,"Good point on the amperage output, 35a was left over from my IPV4 review template.. Must have missed that, I'll correct the review.  Indeed, 9V is a lot of headroom to play with if you build higher resistance coils.  I also agree changing temperature in TC is a hassle, also switching in and out of TC can be a bit temperamental, especially if you're running a low resistance non-TC build.  Thanks for your input!"

Not sure who the manufacturer of the clone is.  On the SMPL however isn't a Derringer, it's the Bambino by Jaybo, who I've heard was one of the designers of the Derringer. It's a 1:1 clone by SXK from FT available here: https://www.fasttech.com/products/0/10013298/2376400-bambino-atty-styled-mini-rda-rebuildable-dripping  However the outer ring, and top cap (bambino cap) is interchangeable with a 1:1 Derringer clones base. This is the Derringer I have, which is also SXK and it fits absolutely perfect. https://www.fasttech.com/products/3028/10012406/2178300  Although I mostly use it with the Bambinos base, I just swapped out the positive screw with a grub hex screw."

ecr_eu,3bjb0y,Terminal-Psychosis,1 point,Tue Jun 30 17:57:16 2015 UTC,There's a fair amount of 18650's that could handle that when using 3 batteries. Some even with 2 batteries.   But lipos (IIRC also what /u/vapourdepot mentioned) seem to be the way the DNA200 is going and I'm be no means knowledge on that topic. Yet.

ecr_eu,3bghzy,XtrmJosh,13,Mon Jun 29 00:46:32 2015 UTC,"Hi there!   Very interesting argument you have there, however I see that you kind of shroud it around exclusivity.. however I feel that this is not the case.  A lot of vendors are pretty small time, NovaVapes is just 3 of us, and as you can imagine our customer base and a lot of small time vendors customer bases will be rather small too.  We started with a few customers (think we only had about 15) when we decided to up our game and introduce ourselves to reddit. We had all been very active redditors up until that point, although the other two lads were lurkers... however when we looked for somewhere to 'kickstart' in a sense.  Exclusivity is not something we think of, our discount code reddit10 was implemented because at launch we had a discount of reddit15 to grab attention... it boiled down to laziness and recognition, it is a common discount code. I was using POTV for a long time on many sites until I had actually heard of POTV.   to quote you on the point of   ""Light internet users who don't know will end up paying more, while heavy internet users who do know will end up spending their time searching more vigerously for a better deal, since they know that it's out there.""  Well.. wouldnt that be a cause for an increased amount of advertising by vendors? Not in the sense of BUY EHOOKAH ESHISHA crap you see everywhere, but my actively becoming involved and therefore caring about different communities they are involved in? If people don't know about a discount code, make it publicly available... ours is kicking about everywhere and we get customers from outside reddit, in person and through word of mouth who will know our discount.   A discount code in a sense is a thank you to a community for having you, as the community gives a lot more to a vendor than a vendor could possibly give back. I can't really see how a discount code punishes users, when it gives them money off.   If a vendor is charging through the arse the vendor should be called out, it is literally our slogan 'why pay more for premium?', I agree there no need for it, I understand paying extra for something to help cover overhead and the likes in a store and every vendor ultimately needs to make some form of profit from it... but I agree paying over the odds isn't really acceptable.  I think 'buying from stores which are more honest and dignified in their dealings' is a good point to raise separately. On a seperate thread about vendors a user mentioned it should be like buying from a mate.   Shouldn't it just be a case of having good customer service and make it so you are actually dealing with a human? Someone who is passionate about their business and are more excited at people trying their product than the sale? Actually caring about screw ups and trying to give the consumer the best experience possible.  Very interesting post mate, I would love to hear your thoughts on the points I made. Sorry about formatting my phone is terrible!"
ecr_eu,3bghzy,NovaVapes,10,Mon Jun 29 01:19:06 2015 UTC,"I think you've totally missed the boat on this post, unfortunately. This really isn't an issue I have ever heard anyone ever complain about before, although the whole 'voucher' scheme has been particularly relevant in recent years as there has been more of a trend of consumers seeking value in their purchases (often to the detriment of quality, but that's an entirely different discussion).  Vendors use these codes as a marketing tool; if they see someone has made an order and have used the code 'reddit10' or 'POTV' then over time they can assess where the majority of their customers are coming from.   I think it's important to remember that most of these EU juice makers are small operations and as such have limited resources. If they see that most of the people using vouchers on their website are using the code 'reddit10' they can then make an informed decision on how best to allocate these limited resources i.e. If they find that most of their customer base is coming from a specific community then they can choose actively participate in said community in an effort to bolster sales.   This is a savvy business tactic, and I fully support it. Whilst some of the vendors on this sub post under account names linked to their businesses (/u/NovaVapes, /u/vapourdepot etc), you'll find that most of their posts are relevant to community discussion, rather than just shilling out their businesses.    Penalises customers who don't know. There are people out there who don't use the internet heavily, and simply don't know that these codes exist. These people are being punished for no good reason.   Customers aren't being ""punished"" or ""penalised"", this is a non-essential commodity, and the demand is very elastic. If they decided to purchase a product at 'full RRP' then evidently they've come to the conclusion that the product represents good value at 'full RRP'.    So, what I mean by this is that (this is purely an example, and might not be true) for instance POTV (Planet of the Vapes) has a discount code ""potv888"" for 888 vapour. 888 vapour has a link at the bottom of their page to POTV. I imagine this took place as a ""trade"" of sorts, and the idea is that in exchange for POTV sending some traffic to 888 vapour, 888 vapour sends some to POTV.   This isn't how it works, 888 vapour will be paying POTV to advertise on their website. The reason 888 vapour will be linking to POTV from their web-store will either be because it's a requirement of the advertisement contract they have in place with POTV, or because it adds legitimacy to their reputation as a reputable vendor. To add to this, as a consumer and a member of the 'hobbyist community', if I see a banner on a website like MyePack stating that they were POTV's vendor of the month/year, I'll know that I can trust them with my order. It's a symbiotic relationship.   Vouchers can also be seen as yet another form of added value. Does that glass bottle with a 'fancy' label your juice comes in make it taste better? No, but it makes you feel better about buying the product.   Your issue seems less specific to this industry, but to capitalism in general. The aim of a successful business is to make profit, in the grand scheme of things offering 'super exclusive discounts' to select customers is one of the least harmful things they can do as a business strategy."
ecr_eu,3bghzy,OptimalOatmeal,2,Mon Jun 29 06:37:12 2015 UTC,Well said :)
ecr_eu,3bghzy,hapticsquid,8,Mon Jun 29 10:18:34 2015 UTC,"Interesting thoughts on how discount codes come across and hopefully it will promote some good discussion.   When we joined the community, we were asked to create a discount code for reddit only, which we promptly did. Discount codes are something commonly found for most vendors (and having done this before for other things, we didn't have an issue).   A couple of our products have a MRSP which we cannot go below. Providing people with a discount code is a way to get around this price and offer it for the price we wanted to sell it at.   For us, we are a small team of 3 people who run everything and we have never made any money from the company personally. We cannot compete with the ""bigger"" vendors on price for a lot of products (they get products for cheaper by buying in a larger volume) so we price our products competitively for what we paid for them. By offering the products with a discount code, we can offer the community a product that is competitive (or better in price) then some other vendors.  I do not think this is a way for vendors to ""punish people"" that are not aware of discount codes, its a way for vendors to make a community feel that personal touch by getting a discount code for that site only.   I can think of plenty of sites that when you go to checkout and leave the page, you get a discount code popup or emailed to you. Would this be classed as poor practice?  I do agree with some of the points raised, but think you've missed some things a little."
ecr_eu,3bghzy,vapourdepot,2,Mon Jun 29 07:04:07 2015 UTC,"Rather than punishing people who don't know, what about it rewarding people who spend some time getting informed ? Also people who get informed often give advices to their relatives, and they'll most likely direct them to the sites they use (probably giving them the discount code). And finally people who are more involved in vaping will likely buy more items than people who are less involved, so it's not a bad idea to treat them like good customers."
ecr_eu,3bghzy,Llamatron2112,2,Mon Jun 29 02:16:43 2015 UTC,Its an interesting perspective!  Here we use the discount codes as part of our process to gauge a vendors sincerity in becoming part of the community.  We are in the process of writing our charter which includes the principles of how we manage our vendors and sets out the standards expected of our mod team improving the transparency of the sub and how we operate behind the scenes.  This coupled with some minor changes to how we manage our vendors should help the community that find our little corner of the Internet. I like to think we have an open and inclusive community.
ecr_eu,3bghzy,okarr,2,Mon Jun 29 05:35:03 2015 UTC,"places like reddit give you guranteed access to a customer base where as traditional advertising does not.   if you create a coupon for a particular subreddit you are guranteed to reach 100% of potential customers.   you should not see a direct and targetted discount code as the companies selling at the ""right"" price when you use the coupon. it is rather them paying in order to acquire a customer. this is just the same as them paying for online advertising. they always pay to acquire a sale / customer.   the fact that juice prices are inflated is another matter altogether. it is not the fault of coupons but rather the fact that all retailers have realized that you can get away with 1000% markups on juice. it is like drinks at a restaurant. they are the money maker in this business.   edit: just as an example. a coworker who is not into DIY always buys his juice at a specific shop. a few days ago they upped the price from €5 to €8 for his favourite liquid. he was livid and asked them why and they told him the cost to procude it has risen. that is bullshit. the ingredient market has been stable if not getting cheaper. with the changes looming in germany for 2016, a lot of places started selling their stock of bases at discounts to trigger hoarding behaviour. so in essence, his juice shop added another €3 on their best selling product. pure profit. now they class it as a premium liquid ... makes me glad i am mixing my own."
ecr_eu,3bghzy,hapticsquid,1 point,Mon Jun 29 09:31:30 2015 UTC,"Good point on the juice mark-up and I don't have a problem with paying the market price for what I'm getting as long as it's fair. For good original juices you also have to factor in the time someone spent developing it. Like the restuarant drinks example, all retail businesses need a higher margin money earner in their mix. The hardware market is so price competitive I can't believe any small vendor is making much of a living out of vaping hardware, you'd need to be shifting big volume. Prob most are happy just to cover their costs + a small profit."

It's not like you make a begrudging order thinking ""bloody terrible price I'm never ordering here again!"". There's a risk someone might think ""damnit I missed a discount, why didn't they tell me?"" - but how did they find out about that?  If I miss a discount after the fact, I put it down to not following them on Twitter / Facebook / Reddit soon enough. IMO community-oriented discounts exist to benefit both parties, and from my limited exposure & experience I'd say that's been working (I am now a more active member on this sub and various forums and I'm aware of a load more vendors).  In summary, yeah it might sting if you miss out on a deal, but thank you to all the vendors who support our online communities :)"

The 'Authoritarians in search of meaning' piece is a good find, putting e-cigs bans in the broader context of escalating regulation on people's behaviour.   The relative size/strength of the UK market is interesting, I hadn't appreciated that before; US adult population is about 6 times that of UK (38million versus 240million), but US e-cigarette sales are only 3.7 times higher than UK (£459m UK versus £1.7 billion US)."

ecr_eu,3bdy0j,deckartcain,3,Sun Jun 28 09:13:27 2015 UTC,"Having just recently come from the states, two major things. Marketing and vape shops. Just getting into vaping, I instantly learned of MBV, vapewild, and a few others while even my local German friends just tell me to try random local B&M juices here in Germany.  For vape stores, at least from my limited Bavarian exposure, definitely customer interaction and shop design. My favorite vape shop in Missoula, Montana had couches and a TV while having very good product positioning and knowledgeable, friendly staff. I've been to three shops here locally, and all of them I have had to pry answers and suggestions from them, even with a local friend asking in German. Considering the mark-up and profit from juices, you'd think they'd be willing to discuss what their crazy named juices are so I could decide whether to buy them."
ecr_eu,3bdy0j,Brotolemaeus,2,Sun Jun 28 18:01:40 2015 UTC,"I was in http://www.ecigroom.co.uk/ in London. While they are very small and no couches and TV, the staff is amazing, willing to help and friendly overall. I was pretty impressed with the service!"

ecr_eu,3bdy0j,ohwhatawittymoniker,2,Sun Jun 28 13:54:42 2015 UTC,I think our advocacy isn't up to standards because Europeans are more reserved than 'Muricans. Not really much we can do about it for now as the majority of vapers in Europe aren't actually aware (or don't want to be aware) of what regulations are coming to us.

ecr_eu,3bdy0j,smallfaces,3,Sun Jun 28 13:47:54 2015 UTC,"Marketing imho.  There are very few european ""premium"" juices I've seen. Maybe it's just me and I'm not looking - but most vendors seem to just have like 50+ flavour eliquids in their shops. That means of course they simply buy flavour concentrates from one of the five or so flavour manufactures and mix them without thinking. There is nothing per se wrong with that especially if you know which manufacturer made the flavours (e.g. flavourart) but it seems to be really hard to find specially selected good eliquids in europe.   I find it kind of ridiculous to import eliquid flavours from america. In terms of consumer products I far prefer european tastes. For example US chocolate vs european chocolate? Is that even a contest? :)"
ecr_eu,3bdy0j,FarkMcBark,2,Sun Jun 28 13:12:33 2015 UTC,"I disaggree. Yes, there are many crappy juices in EU, but there are many crappy juice in US too. But reddit don't talk about these.  EU has a lot of great juice makers (in random order): Vapeboy, Liquid Voyage, The Chosen Few, Flavour Lab, Vaponaute, BioFumo, etc. The list is very very long.  It is also worth noting that some EU juice do not use industry flavourings but make their own. As far as I know, Flavour Lab, Vaponaute and BioFumo create their own components. And I even know about one Polish company specializing in cheap budget juices which uses their own chemicals, their brands are Vogell and Easy To Vape. Have you ever heard about any US company which makes their own aromatic chemicals for budget juices? I haven't..."

ecr_eu,3bbs10,Krauzber,1 point,Sat Jun 27 22:13:49 2015 UTC,I knew I forgot something!  It vapes very well and produces better flavor and vapor compared to a regular contact coil imho.  Sweet spot for me is around 40 to 50 watts where the ramp up time is around a second and I get a nice thick flavorful cloud.  Any higher and the vape gets a little too warm for a large lung hit.
ecr_eu,3bbs10,Krauzber,2,Sat Jun 27 22:20:36 2015 UTC,Nice! Could you compare it to a twisted coil? Ever tried one?
ecr_eu,3bbs10,Krauzber,1 point,Sat Jun 27 22:50:34 2015 UTC,Takes longer to ramp up than contact coil with twisted kanthal but slightly more flavor and vapor since there's more surface area.

Praxis and derringer when im out and about, simply there is nothing smaller and more convenient. The derringer heating issues dont apply as i dont chain when im out and it runs beautifully! At my desk I use my modified smokeless owl and plume veil mostly as my plume had fatal spinny post syndrome and the owl rda is shit so with some minor percussive surgery the bottom feed plume veil was born. I like squonking while i work! Less mess/fuss Pottering around the house I normally use my cthulhu and praxis as its small(ish!) and a beautiful vape.

Really difficult to say which one is the best, it seems to vary from week to week... In no particular order:  Rose v2 (standard) - slightly fiddly build but very satisfying when it's done.  Squape r - Chuck it together and it just goes.  Kayfun v4 - fun to take apart and take care of, feels like a benchmark piece.  Ubertoot UTA2 - love the look of this with metal tank on a smok m80 out and about, starting to understand what the fuss is about.  Taifun GT-II - its a clone at the moment, hoping the authentic has the quality feel of the other pieces.  For power, a couple of sigelei mini 30w, istick 50w, smoke m80 and an ehpro spd a5.

At night I've swapped the DNA40 and Doge v2 combo for the Whiteout 200w and Velocity. Because dual nickel at. 05 ohm is very enjoyable and the velocity is so versatile that switching between clouds and flavour mode is a breeze, which is a nice plus after a long day.   Also in rotation is the Manhattan with a Derringer and a POM topcap. Mainly for the big hits along my after work drink and just after dinner.

ecr_eu,3baf22,SirRisc,5,Sat Jun 27 11:06:22 2015 UTC,Good list.     The ability to contact the vendor and get a human response.     For me that's the one that differentiates between the good and the really good.    What also differentiates top customer service isn't getting it perfect every time (though that's what you should aim for)...it's what a vendor does to make things right when something screws up. That more than the rest is what customers remember and will make them come back.
ecr_eu,3baf22,hapticsquid,2,Sat Jun 27 11:23:44 2015 UTC,"Hopefully what we did when we made a mistake with your velocity order's juice was what you are describing.

ecr_eu,3baf22,frahell,3,Sat Jun 27 10:37:35 2015 UTC,"Customer service is the main thing I always look for. Good juice can be found anywhere, but good service can be a nightmare to find. As someone who frequents B&M shops moreso than online, good service will result in me returning for further purchases.  Prices and quality run fairly close together. Good prices and good quality juice and equipment is essential, as well as knowledge of the products the vendor is carrying. There is nothing worse than being lectured to by a retailer who has no idea about what they're selling.  In short, good service, followed by good prices and quality equipment."
ecr_eu,3baf22,Dumbgecko,3,Sat Jun 27 10:17:42 2015 UTC,"I naturally return to a vendor if they carry a juice that I'm into at the time being. Currently I'm having quite the Gabriella/Ophelia/Lillith- addiction from TheChosenFew, so quite a bit of the budget are spent there ATM.  But aside from that there are another thing that really matters to me: Allthough it is a business and a numbers-game of course, I really appreciate the vendors that makes an extra effort to show that they care about the customers and the community. Not necessarily here on reddit, but through providing good customer service and (the thing that really gets me) the all important personal touch. And as some of you know, I'm a big fan of Cloudhousevapor for this very reason which in turn brings me back time and time again. I also want to mention Vapourdepot in this regard who I think walks a fine line between business and personal relations, and doing a good job at it.  And finally, the reviews and suggestions that originate from this subreddit generates it's fair share of buzz for many of the vendors - which I as a adventourus vaper appreciate a great deal :).  As a small disclaimer I want to say that I have not had a bad experience with any of the vendors that I have tried from the sidebar, or from a suggestion in a post. My stated opinion above is based on my experience and it does not suggest that any of the other vendors are doing anything wrong :)."

ecr_eu,3baf22,trstn,3,Sat Jun 27 18:56:33 2015 UTC,"I have recently bought juice from two different companies. One of them has up to 12 business days delivery, the other 10. That, to me, is just a touch too high. Unfortunately I blew my entire juice budget before checking the shipping times and so here I am - afraid of running out.   Basically what makes a great vendor to me consists of a couple of things, and it seems like most of the people in the thread would agree:   Quick shipping. This can be essential if someone is placing an order and just about to run out of juice or maybe their device broke or whatever else the case might be. I expect most companies to work with shipping companies that provide a maximum shipping time of 5 days within reasonable distances. Good prices. Price is a major influence on an initial purchase. Of course, quality can defeat this point if you know exactly what it is you're looking for and have the ability to pay a premium. But as someone on a tight vaping budget, I appreciate a good deal. Shipping is part of this. Most companies have free shipping if you order over a certain amount of money which makes more sense as shipping does cost the company some. But yeah, cheap yet reliable shipping alternatives exist. Quality Control. This goes for everything that we order. Are juices good? Are devices safe and good? If so, more power to you and I'll probably return for my next order. If not, it's likely a one-time deal and that's it. So far there's only one vendor I'll never make another purchase from. Won't disclaim names of any vendors publicly as I feel it would lead to controversy since I've seen others enjoy things from them and because of integrity. No need for name dropping unless deemed necessary. Customer service. This is integral for me as a beginner. Can I ask you a question and receive a human (any company who only has automated answers are automatically going to be on the no-go list) answer that is sufficient and informative? If so, that's what I'm looking for and you have my business. If not, then I suppose I'll move on.   It sounds hard to be a very good vendor when I think about it, but it should be doable. If business comes to you, make sure you get good people on the team to work alongside you."

ecr_eu,3baf22,Krauzber,2,Sat Jun 27 19:22:29 2015 UTC,"I return to vendors that provide fast shipping and have reasonable prices bonus points for having a wide selection.

What really doesnt figure in to my equations is freebies, its nice to have something extra but if my order has taken weeks to arrive an extra bottle or bits will make very little difference!

ecr_eu,3basz6,natima,2,Sat Jun 27 12:46:43 2015 UTC,"Afaik nichrome has a very very low TCR so no - temperature control simply won't work with nichrome.  You can find some graphs of the TCR of different wires here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uMdo8GWDAH_hDTa3etbTjLYLzX_1Rja_0Y15W7tL3_4/edit#  I would either get nickel or titanium wire from zivipf.com (even though it's a bit springy). Or order some resistherm or ""dicodes wire"" (or nife30). No matter what TC device you use you can also just adjust to taste. About 75% to 70% of the temp you'd set for nickel with ti or nife30."
ecr_eu,3basz6,FarkMcBark,1 point,Sat Jun 27 14:08:05 2015 UTC,"Titanium didn't test well on DNA40 in TC mode, IIRC it fires way beyond set temperature."
ecr_eu,3basz6,ImCuden,1 point,Sun Jun 28 17:16:04 2015 UTC,Yes it does because it has a different TCR (temperature coefficient of resistivity). But you can simply set the temperature to about ~75% of what you'd set for nickel and then adjust to taste. So it's not the titanium at fault (test well) but the DNA40 firmware. It could be implemented much better but it's certainly usable.

ecr_eu,3ba25f,Krauzber,1 point,Sat Jun 27 09:49:38 2015 UTC,What resistance?  At 25w i'm guessing at around 0.6ohm?  If it's any higher go for lower resistance to get more clouds.
ecr_eu,3ba25f,iPHAILZzz,1 point,Sat Jun 27 08:09:36 2015 UTC,Well die difference for me is mostly the throat hit. Both PG and VG dehydrate so a dry throat is normal. Maybe you react a bit more strongly to VG (which can happen. PG is usually the problem but everybody is different and maybe VG just dehydrates you more).
ecr_eu,3ba25f,Asyx,1 point,Sat Jun 27 09:45:12 2015 UTC,There might either be diminishing returns of visual cloud density from 20% more VG. But compare pure PG and pure VG there is a huge difference. The main difference is that VG is smoother. I vape 70/30 with no added water which is a good compromise between flavor / smoothness.

I wasn't trying to play down the damage done to you or anyone else affected, I'm just saying that blame should be put where it belongs.  I'm fairly sure reddit manages their own servers, but for the sake of argument let's say they don't and whatever admin their hosting provider employs screws up like this.

ecr_eu,3b6afl,keee,5,Fri Jun 26 12:21:32 2015 UTC,"I'm no stranger to hosting and it seems that their host made a major booboo. What follows is speculation ofcourse.   Caching is a way of optimisation, it happens on different layers from server, to source code, to served pages and even client-side.   What often happens is that a site is experienced as slow and the hosting company is asked to do something. Usually the opt to run Varnish.  Varnish caches a page when it is rendered and serves it from memory.   So let's say visitor one checks his account. The page is loaded with his info and stored on the server.  Vnow visitor two checks her account, varnish detects a request for a page it has in memory and serves that page. Visitor two now sees the details from visitor one.   Now, this behaviour is caused by Varnish but not really it's fault. Default config of it assumes you're serving static content, because other assumptions are impossible to make.  It is up to the hosting company to alter the config to a point where there is optimal usage of varnish without compromise to the security or experience of the visitor.   Sadly enough, not a lot of hosting companies are capable of doing proper varnish config. This I know for a fact. On top of that, it should never have made it to a live site. Things like this need to be tested on a dedicated, non-public version of the site. I northern point hosting companies fail to deliver by default since that's not making them money.   So if you're going to run an online shop, either take control if you know what you're doing. But really know what you're doing. Or pay someone to do it properly, someone to specialises in the software you're running and can think with you for the best solutions."

Looks like the app running the store caches a few surface bits of info to maintain performance, the hosting company cached that, so we ended up seeing those fragments.  No payment info exposed, a handful of people saw the wrong name / address / recent history for an hour. Everyone gets a 20% discount for the weekend.  GJ ChefsVapour!"

ecr_eu,3b6afl,overachiever,8,Fri Jun 26 12:31:29 2015 UTC,"Hi Fluffton,  If you're who I think you are then I have saw your email. Since it's not really question but a statement.. I'm not sure as to what I'm supposed to reply with?  We're currently working with our hosting provider to fix all highlighted issues. The passwords in plain text is a default method of Prestashop.. I had removed this functionality on our old server but when we moved web hosts, it got switched back on.. I did not know this at the time. The password reset system is currently, completely broken. I'm repairing this as we speak...   The security details that we leaked were extremely minimal.. Most, if not all people who saw this wouldn't have known what was going on. Let alone, to start taking sensitive details. The window for this was very small and it was mostly just first names. Not EVERYONE would have gone and viewed the account details since it was just really confusing. Also, not everyone would have been able to view different account details due to the security methods of Prestashop stepping in every so often and stopping them viewing certain pages. I know this because I tested it... Also, only the people who were live on the site would have had their details potentially shown.  For example... if 10 people went to the website, only those 10 people would have saw the names/address. And the only names and addresses that could have been shown were of ONLY those 10 people on the website.   We understand your frustration and we're deeply sorry about that. I've been working on these issues all day and plan to carry on until early hours or however long it takes to fix this. You're completely entitled to your own opinion but we don't appreciate the mass of negativity you're spreading around on this thread in the manor that you are doing so.   Thank you to everyone for your understanding,"

Unless you can find a good discount, Joyetech do a 15% or 20% promo code in their UK store from time to time.    I suggested similar to someone else here who asked the same question: if you're prepared to buy from China and wait about 10 days for shipping, try 3FVape who I haven't used but were recommended by another here and I think these can be trusted as genuine authentic. Prices are low there so you could trade up to the 2200mAh version (what I have) which I'd recommend as it's still a small stealthy device and the battery life is way way better.  Risk of course on buying there is that warranty return is likely to be a PITA at best should  anything go wrong with it. However for that price, the money saved could buy you a replacement battery if the worst happens later."

I've got a Sig 100 right now, but I've been so excited to try TC for such a long time the last bit of wait killed me. I did some research on the Snow Wolf, and the chip sounds very similar to what's expected/been seen on the Sig 75W TC and rumour has it the device was made by Sigelei and put out under the Snow Wolf brand as a sort of test run for their first whack at TC without harming their reputation. The price was right, the build quality looks solid and I've heard mostly good things about the standard operation of the device with kanthal and the temperature control (which is limited to 70W in case you didn't know, but that's still 2 watts higher than, say, the SX Mini). I think the biggest niggle I've read is the thing auto-locks itself after a few seconds and for some it's been a bit too short and a little annoying, also the side panel's are glass so, you know, you can't drop it.  If you can wait until Tuesday, I can give you my first impressions of the device, but just so you know, you're not the only impatient, excited kid at Christmas."

The airflow outlet is in the center of the chamber and raised. So you can put it on the side and the eliquid won't out. Will still leak upside down of course! Unfortunately the Ares isn't a good atty otherwise.  The new Hastur RDA looks rather leak proof, air inlet from the top. Condensation leaking or overdripping shouldn't be able to do anyhting. It probably will still leak on the side. It's cheap from vapourdepot.com (UK).  You could also check out the Marquis RDA but the clones on fasttech aren't the best.  All of these can still leak from condensation especially if you remove the cap and juices drips down the walls."
ecr_eu,3b4chy,FarkMcBark,1 point,Thu Jun 25 22:10:31 2015 UTC,Only had a couple of days with the Hastur but yes you'd have to try pretty hard to get it to leak at all. You'd have to leave it on its' side for a long time or turn it upside down.
ecr_eu,3b4chy,hapticsquid,2,Fri Jun 26 09:41:24 2015 UTC,The Velocity seems really good imo.  I've had mine for 3 days now and not had a single leak (except when I seriously over dripped). Plus it's a freaking great atty.!

I assume any dripper is gonna have the potential for leaking if you don't close off the holes but the mutation is pretty roomy inside, it's not like my big block where the juice practically runs off the wick and out the sides. It should be noted that because of the large airflow and chamber size the mutation is considered more a cloud chasing atty rather than one for flavour, but I personally think it's just as good as my Subtank flavour wise. They also have a v3 and v4 too. Got mine from Amazon actually, as I had a voucher to use up and thought I'd give it a shot. Cost about £17 and I think it's been a good buy."

Problem with drippers is they are designed to be easily refillable, so they have weak / unreliable seals, and they are designed such that the airflow leads directly into the coils, so there is a direct path for both air to get in or liquid to get out.  If you want dripper like performance, with minimal leaking, I'd suggest the goblin, but even that leaks. I put some plumbing tape on the fill screw of mine and it hasn't leaked since (the PTFE tape stuff you use on plastic water pipe connections)."

ecr_eu,3b1zj9,Eternal_Sunshine,13,Thu Jun 25 09:14:29 2015 UTC,"Its just the same as buying tesco cola. They aren't calling it coca cola, it tastes almost the same and it's much cheaper. If I want the real thing I'll pay top price for it but if I want it cheaper I'll buy a cheaper brand.  Everyone in theory clones juice as some other people have stated. At the start there was one person who made a custard, cereal, yogurt, cookie juice etc. as long as you let people know it's a clone it's fair game in my eyes."
ecr_eu,3b1zj9,goldfish_of_chaos,2,Thu Jun 25 09:55:57 2015 UTC,"And when you consider they're all using concentrates from the same 5-6 companies, just in different quantities, it's not as though they've gone out of their way to painstakingly extract it from the source material.  The mark up for some premium juice is ridiculous too, and that reflects in the wholesale price which by itself already has a minimum I've seen of 80% mark-up compared with the cost to manufacture."
ecr_eu,3b1zj9,Rivuzu,1 point,Thu Jun 25 15:36:01 2015 UTC,"If people are willing to pay for gourmet premium reserve juice, why not charge 80+% mark up."
ecr_eu,3b1zj9,goldfish_of_chaos,2,Thu Jun 25 16:04:40 2015 UTC,"That's not my argument.  Compare the cost of a ""clone"" liquid to buy vs an authentic, using all the same ingredients in all the same ways, it's pretty much impossible for the authentic to justify the giant mark-up attached.  And people pay it because it's all we've come to know from the business since inception.   Though ultimately, unless they're branding the bottles as identical to the company, it isn't a clone but an inspired likeness.  I can make a fantastic strawberries and cream liquid that tastes like Unicorn Milk, but so long as I don't call it that and brand it with Cuttwoods logos, it's not a clone."
ecr_eu,3b1zj9,Rivuzu,1 point,Thu Jun 25 16:09:34 2015 UTC,"In my eyes, most prices are fair. I mix a bit and most of the DIY community agrees that making a good clone of a premium juice is really difficult, some are considered close to impossible.  Finding the right proportions for a juice is not easy. Hell, finding the right amount for just one flavor can be difficult. To put that in perspective, some premium juices have 10+ flavors that need to be in the right proportions to each other. Then the juice needs to steep for a week before you know if it's any good. If a company spends that much time perfecting a juice I don't have a problem paying extra.  Markup for steeping on the other hand, that's just bogus. Any fool can steep juice for a long time."
ecr_eu,3b1zj9,gardvar,2,Thu Jun 25 18:01:48 2015 UTC,"This is a very controversial topic in the DIY community. I think it's very difficult to define a ""clone"" in this scenario. Is a clone something that has a a very similar flavour profile to another juice? Many of the custard juices you will try will taste almost identical, simply because the creators of these juices are using the same OTS flavourings/aromas.   I think the issue arises when a vendor sells an ejuice of a recipe they've found online, whether it be a recipe for a clone or something totally original, that they have not contributed to in any way. There are a number of 'big name' ejuice companies that have several eliquids across their ranges that are virtually identical in terms of their basic flavour profile. I think this is more a sign of savvy business practices than ""cloning""; first it was custards, then it was cereal, now we seem to be moving into yogurts.   Some of you may be aware of the infamous 'Cereal Killa' clone created by a user on /r/DIY_eJuice. Essentially he created a very accurate clone of an ejuice and later found that a number of vendors were selling the recipe (either as a clone of CK or as an original ejuice). This led to a great deal of drama and resulted in him deleting the original threads showing his progression, thoughts and recipe.   This is not an isolated indecent, far from it. Indeed I've even heard that vendors have been selling /u/fizzmustard's Nana' Cream clone as re-bottled 'wholesale discount', 'fell off the back of a lorry' original Nana' Cream.   I think most people would be surprised by the number of vendors selling ejuices of recipes they've simply plucked from a forum. Personally I think it's something you just have to accept will happen if you choose to share a recipe and it proves to be popular. Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery I suppose! (This doesn't mean that I support this practice.)"
ecr_eu,3b1zj9,OptimalOatmeal,3,Thu Jun 25 09:48:51 2015 UTC,"It's a case of overinflated egos. At the end of the day, very few people make their own flavours, so it's a case of adding different amounts of something someone else made to get a finished product. I'm going to post a recipe on /r/food for a sandwich and then go mental when people make the sandwich for themselves or a sandwich shop sells it.  If you don't want people to make or sell your juice, don't give them the recipe :)"

That said I've bought cloned liquids, I've cloned a few myself and really don't see the issue with cloned liquids.  If you have Nana Cream as an ADV for example, it can get very expensive very fast.

ecr_eu,3b1zj9,leshpack,3,Thu Jun 25 18:19:46 2015 UTC,"I personally am fine with it. As long as it isn't a clone in the sense of clone mods (ie same bottle, same label, could be confused for the original)  This is done all the time in other business sectors. If you look at soft drinks as an example, no one owns the ""cola"" flavour but you have coca-cola, pepsi, ubuntu cola, faygo cola to name a few. Which are all cola flavours with minor (or major depending on your tatste preferences) differences.  Taste trademark isn't a thing and has been actually granted to very few companies because there is no inherent way to claim ownership of a flavour combination as this article about pizza trademark attempting shows.  Yeah it may be a little bit shitty copying the recipe of another person and using it for profit, but it is something that has happened for years and unless company A has a trademark over a certain mixture, then company B is entirely fine to create the same mixture themselves and sell it on"

Legally, there's nothing you can do about it (unless they were infringing on a registered trade mark) since you cannot copyright a recipe. IANAL so don't quote me on it!  Morally, profiting on someone else's hard work is wrong imho and people who are simply copying recipes from various forums and selling them as-is should be ashamed of themselves.  This is a grey area though as I don't see any problems with getting inspirations from other recipes, putting your own spin on it and call it your own.  It's difficult to tell sometimes as well since juices from different vendors can have very similar flavour profiles e.g. there is a juice from a well liked European vendor that I found tastes very similar to the honey pearry clone on /r/DIY_eJuice - I don't think they copied that recipe though as there are other original juices in their line-up."
ecr_eu,3b1zj9,overachiever,3,Thu Jun 25 11:06:35 2015 UTC,"Simple, if IP or branding is also cloned then it's straight up wrong - same as with any cloning or counterfeit goods."

I personally have no problem with a DIY clone such as is on www.e-liquid-recipes.com as you know its definitley not the original.  As long as its clearly marked and the right permissions/credit given it can be acceptable but only in cases where the original company is screwing us (see five pawns for details). Companies such as vapecrafter have been making recipe based juices a while.  That said commercial clones of unknown recipies such as suicide bunny, five pawns, liquid voyage, the chosen few etc shouldn't be sold as a 1:1 clone as it's misleading and will lose the original companies business furthermore there is argument that the original recipe is interllectual property and as such cloners would be subject to legal cases including potential loss of business, interllectual property infringement and potentially reputational damage."

Cloning a juice I think should have the permission from the creator before being up for sale. For example if someone cracked Grahams Custard... DIY community can go nuts and use it for personal juice... however a commercial gain should result in permission from the original creator.

Would always recommend charging batteries externally, especially since the Subox is so new you never know how reliable the port is. For a small top up, fine, but I'd try to avoid it for a big charge if possible. If you don't have one, get one and you will be able to always have spare fresh batteries ready. Some of the Nitecore ones have a screen built in that shows you the exact voltage and you can charge pretty much any type of rechargeable batteries on them too."

ecr_eu,3b3xty,vynsun,1 point,Thu Jun 25 21:55:30 2015 UTC,"Have the same issue with my Cloupor Mini. I figure it's safer to use my nitecore charger for the batteries, anyway."
ecr_eu,3b3hsy,Lavalamb,2,Thu Jun 25 17:45:34 2015 UTC,"Triple strand twisted 26g kanthal, 9 wraps on a 2.5 mm Kuro coiler comes in at 0.5 ohms. Currently hand twisting my wire using a 'pen and clamp' method I saw online too!"
ecr_eu,3b3hsy,fluffton,3,Thu Jun 25 17:47:55 2015 UTC,Spin the weight is the best method for twisting with no drill.  Most people loop the wire through a mug handle and put a tin in the mug for extra weight.  I use a shackle.  Doesn't really matter what you use as a weight as long as it has a loop or hook and a bit of weight to it.   Much quicker and can get it as tight as a drill :)
ecr_eu,3b3hsy,AllRichC,1 point,Thu Jun 25 17:54:04 2015 UTC,"God, why did I never think of this, thanks very much. Twist All The Things!!!"
ecr_eu,3b3hsy,ferongr,1 point,Thu Jun 25 17:55:36 2015 UTC,I twist my wires using an allen key in a handheld drill and pliers. Results in very tight twist pitch (the same build with parallel wires at 0.6 ohm becomes 1 ohm) and a very nice result. It also takes less than a minute.
ecr_eu,3b3hsy,metans,1 point,Thu Jun 25 20:24:01 2015 UTC,Just this minute got a dirt cheap cordless electric screwdriver that does the business. Gonna be putting up some 4 strand twisted builds tomorrow hopefully.
ecr_eu,3b3hsy,Daztastic,1 point,Thu Jun 25 20:44:42 2015 UTC,How does it do for ramp up time? What sort of wattage can you run this at?
ecr_eu,3b3hsy,crowdome,1 point,Thu Jun 25 19:15:03 2015 UTC,"Ramp up time is pretty short, but noticeable, I'd say less than a second, like you push the button as you raise the mod to your lips and it's fine. I have been running it at 40 no issues. Made sure to have a short wick so that the juice can keep running in. Chain vaping at that wattage leads to the tank getting a tad warm but the vape is cool as a cucumber."

I'm not over keen on their flavours (I haven't tried the menthol one yet). However or 99p I thought it would be worth the try, which it was - the bubblegum one isn't horrible, I haven't tried the menthol one, and I didn't like the parma violet one, which I found has a revolting aftertaste."

Fair enough of course, but super annoying when the US brands don't care about em.  Your only option's going to be re-bottling it, but that could work in your favour if you do 10ml/17ml bottles because loads of people don't want to buy 180ml without trying it first."

ecr_eu,3b05w3,FarkMcBark,2,Thu Jun 25 14:30:07 2015 UTC,"Do I remember correctly that BLU are owned by big tobacco? If so, that might explain stuff like this... The big problem for tobacco companies is that vaping is a way to ease off the cigarettes. It's NRT and synthesis at the same time. It isn't, however, quite the same. It's about 50% less addictive in my experience, and should be fairly easy to quit. I get the impression that some companies are trying to find ways to make e-liquid more addictive by adding shit like taurine, caffiene, etc, without concern for the potential health impacts of taking taurine to the lung."
ecr_eu,3b05w3,XtrmJosh,1 point,Thu Jun 25 08:24:29 2015 UTC,I've ran out of the surplus of disposable e-cigs I had bought before I had a proper setup as they do really come in useful when being very discreet and came across this.  First I've heard of this. BLU is a fairly large cigalike company afaik so this seems even more strange. Would it do.. anything?  Also.. if anyone knows where to buy the cheapest disposable cigalikes possible let me know! (really cheap as I grudge spending money on this)
ecr_eu,3b05w3,sjugge,1 point,Wed Jun 24 22:24:36 2015 UTC,"To keep it discreet, I use the following setep:   Eleaf iKit. Haven't used the included tank yet.  Mini, single coil carto   The carto does hold a nice amount of juice for it's size, you'll need to drip to refill though. But the tank that comes with the kit is probably not that bad. You'll probably want to use lower VG juice anyway to keep it discreet and in a carto it's very enjoyable."

ecr_eu,3axufx,smallfaces,1 point,Wed Jun 24 11:56:28 2015 UTC,That 35a battery will be a 20a. 35a will probably be a pulse. Efest?

ecr_eu,3axufx,smallfaces,1 point,Wed Jun 24 14:35:43 2015 UTC,I didn't know there were 35a batteries. I thought the Samsung 25r was the best on the market
ecr_eu,3axufx,Sangaren,1 point,Wed Jun 24 13:46:54 2015 UTC,"Samsung 25R are a good battery no doubt, but some people prefer LG's some prefer Efest, its just down to personal preference and experience really.  However it has been known that there are alot of fake samsungs floating around now, re-wrapped with lower specs, which is why i tend to stick with other brands personally.  They state the batteries as 35A Pulse, not continuous."
ecr_eu,3axpvf,JackPux,2,Wed Jun 24 09:58:54 2015 UTC,"yes its ejuice. Its just to make sure the cotton is wet to avoid dry hits. You want to wet the cotton after its in the coil, cotton expands slightly when wet"

ecr_eu,3auq43,Krauzber,1 point,Wed Jun 24 09:43:53 2015 UTC,"Honestly very basic. Ko gen cut so it's pretty tight but movable in the 3mm coil. 0.4mm kanthal. I do cut it quite short though.   Using the bunny ears method I cut it directly at the top of the chimney. Even angling the scissor inwards so there's virtually no overhang.   Haven't had to pancake it or anything but I do expose the juice channels by moving the cotton back a bit.   Only other thing I can think of is that I always drip and then burn the cotton almost dry 3-4 times before attaching the tank. But I do that on all tanks not just the lemo. It helps the cotton align itself internally which can greatly help improve wicking. Also removes most,  but not all, of the cotton flavour profile."

I was genuinely surprised by the thread since dry hits is the very last thing I thought to associate with the lemo 2. Thus I got curious as to how people ran their lemos.

ecr_eu,3auq43,vapourdepot,1 point,Tue Jun 23 18:21:19 2015 UTC,The reason people say not to tight the glass is because the bottom o-ring will expand and sort of block the juice channels... the subtank o-ring is a bit stronger and it seems like is not expanding...

I sometimes use them to store batches of juice as well and fill one or two 20ml bottles with a serringe. I also have a bunch of 100ml bottles with a wide neck to make smaller batches, very easy to transfer with a serringe.   Base juice being used I have sitting in sauce bottles you can find in grocery stores. They hold close to 350ml, very handy for mixing by weight.  Mixed juice stays stored in larger bottles, often cleaned out bottles of my base. And transfer to smaller bottles as needed. Smaller bottles are constantly reused to refill.   Pink Mule has a nice range of all kinds of bottles and containers, though shipping will kill the price if you're only ordering for that.

Thanks, MM    Edit: or should I just wait to see if the 50w is sufficient with it? Thanks for the help vape guru's"
ecr_eu,3atao3,morphinememories,3,Tue Jun 23 10:40:27 2015 UTC,I would honestly wait until your tank turns up before changing your device.   I ran a Horizon Arctic (pretty much the same tank) on 50w for a long time before I upgraded.
ecr_eu,3atao3,vapourdepot,1 point,Tue Jun 23 10:48:40 2015 UTC,"Thank you I think i'll just do that and upgrade when or if I need more power, just trying to be a bit proactive with it. Good to hear you ran at 50w ok though. Thank you for your time VD"
ecr_eu,3atao3,morphinememories,1 point,Tue Jun 23 10:55:25 2015 UTC,"^ this. There isn't that much difference at 50~70w on the Starre cloud and flavour wise, other than a warmer vape."
ecr_eu,3atao3,ultralowlatency,2,Tue Jun 23 19:34:40 2015 UTC,the Sigelei 100W Plus is a solid choice. It's over the 70W you said so if that's an important thing to you then just ignore my ramblings. It's a bit taller than a credit card and about 2cm thick. I've used it since december and haven't had any problems. Only con is that you need a charger since it doesn't have integrated charging but the door is kept closed with magnets so it's really easy to open. It costs 100€ and is really simple to use.
ecr_eu,3atao3,Jused,1 point,Tue Jun 23 11:38:11 2015 UTC,Thanks I will look into this :) much appreciated

ecr_eu,3atao3,Krauzber,1 point,Tue Jun 23 10:54:21 2015 UTC,"I honestly can't think that you'll need more than 50w as long as you're using a tank, if you're going to drip and do fancy builds that's a whole different story.   30w is enough to feel satisfactory in the lemo 2 that i've got, although I mainly use my mech and leave the boxmod to my GF"
ecr_eu,3atao3,Jused,3,Wed Jun 24 18:12:53 2015 UTC,I've been thinking about buying the rDNA 40 for a while now since I never ended up buying the rDNA 30. I'm just not sure if temp control is worth the 100£ price tag. Also I haven't managed to find any info on whether or not the wireless charging supports 3rd party charging pads.
ecr_eu,3atao3,sjugge,1 point,Tue Jun 23 11:31:18 2015 UTC,"I'd be a bit hesitant to get an rDNA now, since the DNA200 is coming and it could be a gamble on which version of the DNA40 you'll be getting. Temp control is worth it, I'm not sure if the rDNA40 is...  re: 3rd party charging pads; I'd be sceptical or very cautious."
ecr_eu,3atao3,Jused,2,Tue Jun 23 13:45:33 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure that I wouldn't be getting the 200W version but I might wait and see if the prices for the rDNA 40 drop once DNA200 is released.  I wouldn't worry about 3rd party pads because I wouldn't be buying a cheapo one from China but I'd like to know if the charging system requires the VS pad
ecr_eu,3atao3,sjugge,1 point,Tue Jun 23 13:54:01 2015 UTC,There was quite a nice drop in price at vaporshark days before th  DNA200 news came out. It doesn't seem like retailers are following them (likely not able to). So picking one up from them directly may be your best chance price wise and also to get a fairly recent board.
ecr_eu,3atao3,Jused,2,Tue Jun 23 14:18:47 2015 UTC,It's $130 on Vaporshark's site so with tax it's gonna cost more than buying it from the UK

ecr_eu,3atao3,keee,3,Tue Jun 23 14:26:12 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the offer of assistance, I hope this is not too vague - appreciate any thoughts & input :)  I can't decide on my next VV/VW mod. Temperature control seems like such an obvious choice but the market appears to be quite fragmented with differing views on which tech to go for / which is reliable.  I have an iStick 50W and now I'm getting into fancy low ohm coil builds I'm feeling like I want to push up to 60-70W+.  I thought I was set on the Sig 150W, but then saw they have the 70W w/TC coming soon, and possibly a 150W w/TC as well? The 150W box mods are attractive for 'future proofing' my power demands, but they tend to not have TC (is that right?) - and I'm still not sure if that should be a hard requirement going forward.  The eVic VT seemed like a good move too. YiHi boxes, DNA boxes, all of the above - I'm not really bothered about the cost, I just can't get a grip on what's 'good' right now, and with the market moving so fast it's always going to feel like the wrong time to invest in anything.  Should I just sit tight for another month or two to see how the next/current wave of TC mods plays out? Is TC just a fad that is never going to be quite right and I should just go for the best power output mod (I get the feeling that the Sig 150W is the gold standard?).  Thanks again - this is just my feeling after a month or so of looking around, expect I've missed some decent devices and/or got the wrong idea about others - no offence or trolling intended!"
ecr_eu,3atao3,keee,2,Tue Jun 23 11:32:56 2015 UTC,I think I'm going to wait for the reviews of the Sig 75W and get one of those if things are positive.

ecr_eu,3ath3m,DanTheBib,3,Tue Jun 23 11:18:08 2015 UTC,"The subox set up sounds good for you. You can get stock coils for that. I'd suggest dropping your nicotine level as this device will pump out more vapour so you will consume more, thus meaning you will get a headache or uncomfortable head buzz. Also I'm not sure about your current device but I think the subtank is better for lung hits instead of mouth to lung drags like you would with a cigarette.   Edit: you will need to buy separate 18650 batteries for use with this mod. I'd suggest Samsung 25r batteries. Also a charger would be good. I use the nitecore I2, it charges two batteries at once.   Another choice for the mod would be the sigelei 30w, which is another compact mod. I have one of these for my pocket carry. It's not temperature control but is a good bit of kit."

ecr_eu,3ath3m,Krauzber,2,Wed Jun 24 17:55:17 2015 UTC,"It all depends, subtank mini is the obvious choice of clearo atm since it has the ability to use both rebuildable deck and store-bought coils. But I don't know how the airflow is when tightened down to mouth hits, some tanks feel really awkward when doing so.   So the subtank mini kit seems like the ideal choice atm, plus you will probably have to go down in nic concentration to 12mg when upgrading, the ET-S tanks and old and pretty shit in comparison."

ecr_eu,3atfmv,Hekuzilla,2,Tue Jun 23 10:58:51 2015 UTC,"Remember to get some nicotine (if required), or even easier get a base with nicotine added.  You should be aware that MBV concentrate is PG based, so mixing to 20% flavour concentration will result in 60/40 PG/VG in the finished product. This might affect what pg/vg ratio you choose for your base liquid. Similarly this will also lower the nicotine concentration in the final product.  20% is usually about right for MBV (in my experience) but i would recommend trying 10 or 15% first & see what you think.  EDIT: I recommend 'E-Juice Lab' (thanks /u/borez) for android (not sure about iOS apps), its easy to use, allows for recipes using premixed base, and instructs mixing based on volume, percentage, or weight. I also recommend a cheap set of digital scales (0.01 resolution) and measure by weight, so much easier than messing about with loads of syringes."
ecr_eu,3atfmv,manhattan4,1 point,Tue Jun 23 13:13:29 2015 UTC,"If you have the base with the nicotine-concentration you are vaping, then yes. Else you'd need some more nicotine-free base to dilute it.  And please make sure to leave some space in your bottles, not only to let the juice breath/steep, but also to add some flavoring or some more base.  Also never start with the whole percentage given, always start lower, at least 50% lower imho.   Mixing juice is not difficult, it just takes time. :)"
ecr_eu,3atfmv,Mundfein,1 point,Tue Jun 23 11:06:51 2015 UTC,Making your own base is as easy as taking 3 liquids and measuring them out into a bottle. Very simple.

I really would recommend using an app to help calculate mixes.   Just to check, is that the level of nicotine (16mg) you require? It's quite high, but not that unusual for someone who's just quit smoking. If you need to lower it you could buy some nicotine free base liquid to dilute it"
ecr_eu,3atfmv,manhattan4,1 point,Tue Jun 23 18:55:55 2015 UTC,i'm looking to get 6mg..
ecr_eu,3atfmv,manhattan4,1 point,Tue Jun 23 19:15:51 2015 UTC,"OK, then you will need to buy some more base with 0mg nicotine to dilute what you already have.  Based on a 20% flavour concentrate mix, you will need. 30% 20mg base, 50% 0mg base, 20% flavour concentrate. To mix 10ml of juice this would be 3ml 20mg base, 5ml 0mg base, 2ml concentrate.  This will give you 10ml of juice, at 20% flavour concentration, 6mg of nicotine.  I looked at the base you bought, I am assuming its 50/50 VG/PG but the atmoslab website doesnt exactly say.  Another thought, if you wanted to make this really easy for yourself. Buy 200ml of 0mg base & an empty 300ml bottle. Pour all of the base in the 300ml bottle (100ml @ 20mg & 200ml @ 0mg). You now have 300ml of juice at 6.6mg nicotine which will make future mixing far easier. Adding flavour concentrates when you mix each batch will bring the nicotine levels of the resulting juice down to around 5.5mg depending on how much concentration you use (based on 15-20%)"

ecr_eu,3aqttz,3verlong,5,Mon Jun 22 19:36:36 2015 UTC,"It's not just you, I noticed this as well. But it's not a big deal for me. I ordered 3mg at first and it does have a higher throat hit at 70% VG than I'm used to. It's not too strong for me though I actually kinda like it. They are smooth but at the same time have a bit of a ""bite"". Like fresh fruit is a tiny bit sour. I really love the juice!  The second order I got seemed smoother but I could be wrong and just got used to it.  It could either be a problem with the nicotine they used (I read somewhere that some shipment was delayed because of nicotine problems) OR if this is simply part of the flavour.  I really wish that IF there where problems with the nicotine (old / peppery nicotine?) that flavourlabs would come clean about it.  PS: Just to add maybe you can get 0mg from them and mix it down to 3mg. This might actually help some to go down in their nicotine level and still have a bit of throat hit."

ecr_eu,3aqttz,langertony45,5,Mon Jun 22 21:47:20 2015 UTC,"Hey, you've already to spoke to /u/beckico via e-mail but I want to reply, too. First off: I'm 99% sure it's not the nicotine. Maybe it's your build/atomizer or whatever, but I really doubt it's the nicotine. We use organic nicotine from Carolina Xtract, it's quite likely the best nicotine available, so low quality nicotine isn't the issue. It's still possible we simply added too much nicotine, but usually we triple check that. The next possibility is an allergy to our flavours, but that would be limited to one or maybe two liquids, and not all of them. Is 70VG or rather 30PG usually harsh for you? It could be an allergy or sensitivity. I would try what the others have said, give it a water bath (not too hot if you received plastic bottles) and air it out. I really hope that solves the problem, if not, please do get back at us (either here or e-mail)."

I get very minimal throat hit off any of these at 3mg 70VG at 0.4ohm in Cthulhu and drippers, a little more bite from Smash because of the dark berry flavours."

I was surprised because none of the reviewers mentions this. It's probably partially just individual taste and I personally have no problem with it and really like your eliquid and I think I got used to it now. I think it did NOT get better with steeping but now I don't notice it anymore. Did you change nicotine supplier or something?

We get a ridiculous number of customers through the door in a day so it's hard to chat sometimes or more accurately, hard to spot the enthusiasts who would appreciate being part of our chat, but we do our best. When the shop is empty it's just as likely we'll be discussing vape stuff as it is anything else.   For every 20 (just as important as any other) customers we get in that just want to buy a new coil for their ce5 and a bottle of menthol dekang liquid, we'll maybe get one or two proper ""enthusiast"" customers, and it's not always as easy to spot by what gear theyre using. Plenty of pretty casual users these days are rocking fairly high end setups so even if somebody whips out a bunch of high end kit that we don't sell, there's still no guarantee they have any interest in chatting to you about all the latest ecr drama or whatever mad shit pbusardo is reviewing or what crazy exotic RDA you've got sitting in your mailbox when you get home etc etc.   But all of us in there are hobbyists and enthusiasts through and through so stop in for a chat and we'll always be happy to chillout and talk about shit and give you a blast of whatever silly gear we are rocking on that particular day.   That was a pretty big reply. Basically our shop rules and you should visit again sometime anyway. The more the merrier. Even if you're just browsing.

You could try thinning that juice out but you'll also dilute the flavour so might get more of a throat hit than anything else."

I hate to sound like I haven't done my own research first, but have spent the past two hours reading through this sub, too much information!  I understand the liquid will lose flavour, but it's too strong now, and I don't want to throw it away. Some is 18mg, thats OK if I keep the voltage down, but some is 24mg, and that is just too much.  After a few days with the Nautilus, the ce4's taste horrific, so wouldn't really want to put it in them."
ecr_eu,3ard9t,keee,2,Mon Jun 22 22:15:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah it's a shocking difference, only moved over recently myself :)  My understanding is that the RDA chamber size and shape will affect the flavour, and the airflow will affect the cloud production (coils, wicking and the juice itself are also factors in both).  Plume Veil was supposed to be a nice combination of both so I went for that as my first and it's still my main RDA (use a Derringer and a Valhalla occasionally too).  Enjoy :D"

ecr_eu,3aof2j,OptimalOatmeal,1 point,Mon Jun 22 20:52:28 2015 UTC,Is there any science proving copper posts are bad for your health?
ecr_eu,3aof2j,Auxx,5,Mon Jun 22 05:17:24 2015 UTC,"There have been various studies on the impact of inhaling copper particles. The side-effects vary from ""respiratory irritation"" to ""chronic obstructive disease"", however the more severe symptoms were only observed in individuals who had a ""chronic exposure to copper dust and fumes"" in an industrial setting i.e. far more than you could ever inhale in a vaping scenario.   The real issue is whether or not you can trust the manufacturers making the units with ""copper"" center posts. The price of copper as a commodity is a great deal more than the price of brass, for instance. It would not surprise me to find out that these Chinese clone manufactuers are cutting corners by using brass in their centre posts, but claiming them to be copper. You see this all the time with insulators on clones; they claim to use PEEK, but use delrin or another thermoplastic instead. This only becomes an issue when your delrin insulators decide to melt at 175°C (vs PEEK's melting point of around 343°C).  Of course, if they are using brass, you can be almost certain it won't be naval brass (on a clone), which means it may contain an assortment of other goodies including lead, which you probably don't want to vape in any amount (lead is added to the alloy in order to improve machinability and atmospheric corrosion resistance). Naval brass is just an alloy of copper and zinc.   The real question is whether the temperature you're running your setup at, and the juice you are using etc... will cause a degradation in whatever material the posts are made out of (whether it be brass or copper) that could lead to poisoning.   This is largely just speculation on my part. Personally I choose to avoid any cloned RDA that has copper/brass posts that can possibly come into contact with your wicking material/eliquid. However I think it's something that consumers should make their own informed decision on. Much like the whole cyclical diketone debate; personally I don't avoid diacetyl/acetyl propiony, however I respect the decision of those that choose to do so.   Having said all this, one of the major benefits of vaping is harm reduction. If you choose to vape only the butteriest, popcorny liquids on your 100% Chinesium/brass RBAs, more power to you; it's still much safer than the alternative.

ecr_eu,3aof2j,gardvar,1 point,Mon Jun 22 09:15:48 2015 UTC,AFAIK copper is banned from anything food related etc. Only lined copper is allowed. Copper in vape devices is never lined! So I would avoid it at all costs.

You could try 3FVape from China, works out about £27, don't know about delivery options (not used them) but I bookmarked them when someone here said they'd used them and got delivery in 7-10 days I think.  They have the bigger Mega for a few $ more. Fasttech also have genuine eGo Ones (and cheap coils) but you will wait longer.   Slight caution on buying from them rather than a UK vendor obviously is that if anything goes wrong with it (battery most likely with any gear), warranty return could be a PITA at best.  But what you save could go towards a replacement batt if the worst happens. I've been using mine most days since January, it's pretty beat up now but working like a champ still, no problems at all. However I was reading a comment from a vendor here at the weekend saying they'd stopped selling them because of the number of returns of faulty batteries. I would recommend the eGo One unreservedly from my single experience, and had not heard of problems before this, but thought I ought to pass that on (sorry if it has put you off, anyway I'd buy one again, it's a great device)."

Balaton for summer - of course :) every year - kids love it. Winter is also quite lovey also but not for swimming. Since you like the water you should maybe hit the bathouses in Budapest - Rudas is my regular - mixed bathing only at the weekends and Szechenyi is mixed all the time and is total Gatsby with a robe and flipflops   Tokaji is worth visiting it if you like wine - tho there are many exceptional regions, Pecs is also worth a visit and Budapest night life is most lively in VI district - around Kazinczy Street particularly nice for watching people girls :)"

ecr_eu,3amigz,ohwhatawittymoniker,2,Mon Jun 22 06:06:36 2015 UTC,I struggle to support totally wicked as I feel they try to use the legal challenge to market their products.  They are rebranded and heavily marked up generic devices on the most part. With the publicity they can act like they are leading the market whilst overcharging their customers.
ecr_eu,3amigz,PartTimeLegend,3,Sun Jun 21 22:05:46 2015 UTC,I support them because they're standing up for themselves and the rest of the juice making community in a case that will set legal precedent for the whole of the industry. Whether you like their products or not you have to admire that from a company when no other juice manufacturer is doing this.    Plus the challenge website is completely separate from their online store. They could have quite easily linked the two together yet they chose not to.

ecr_eu,3amlaf,FarkMcBark,1 point,Sun Jun 21 22:16:20 2015 UTC,A note on the wicking: I noticed that as the wick gets gunked up the wicking capability decreases quite a bit (tops out at ~16 watt @ 460°F instead of the initial ~30 watt). I now tried to only put half the wick in the juice channels and put the rest of it UP (instead of on top of the juice channels). This helps with more throughput. Still have to see how well it holds up.  My only gripe is that taking it apart for rewicking is quite annoying because of the nut and I use pliers to do it. I hope they make a V2 where the top parts are all one (there are three parts that could be fused).
ecr_eu,3amlaf,Krauzber,1 point,Mon Jun 22 06:27:02 2015 UTC,"I made this a few days back and rewicked again today, took me no more than 15 minutes from take-a-part to vaping again.

Unicorn's Milk (CLONE)  10% TFA Strawberry Ripe  5% TFA Cheesecake (Graham Crust)  3% TFA Bav Cream  3% TFA Sweet Cream  2% TFA French Vanilla*   you can always substitute this for 2% Vanilla Custard   I personally don't think it's exactly like Cuttwood 's version but imo this is way better.  I pretty much Vape only this at the moment (waiting for 6 others to steep so I can see what they're like.  So far the Anti-Lag clone I've done is looking really promising).   Disclaimer: this recipe is not mine (except my substituting vanilla Custard for French Vanilla and I have no idea who created it otherwise I would attribute it to them.  All I can say is that they are a God amongst men and should be worshipped as such. :-)

A lot of RTAs have smaller chambers, more reduced airflow and a chimney that concentrates the flavour even more.  I think a common misconception is that drippers automatically give you better flavour, I've found that not being the case in most circumstances. Drippers are easier to build however, so for a lot of people it's simpler to put in a build that gives good flavour in one.  I get the best flavour from reduced chamber gennies and 14mm drippers (squonking atties)."

I would love to see some research - testing the same batch from flavouring, to mixing, then at various points along its lifetime 'steep' time. Its likely that even if the diketone levels are negligible at first mix stage, they could increase over time. This may also be why there is the disagreement about steepings' efficacy."

So heat the bottle again, maybe a bit more than before. Then shake it as hard as you can...and shake it just a little bit harder :)   Seriously, give it one more good try and if you still aren't happy with it I will replace the bottle for you."

ecr_eu,3aizvf,DogLif3,1 point,Sat Jun 20 18:12:17 2015 UTC,Hello.  Two of my Cloudhouse Vapor MBV liquids looked differently after I returned from holidays. Both of them are about two months old.   Is there a way to fix them?   I already tried to shake them but without success. One of them is a 100ml bottle so it would be pretty tough if I have to throw it away.
ecr_eu,3aizvf,patronix,2,Sat Jun 20 17:39:24 2015 UTC,Try putting them in a zip lock bag and then in worm water. Worming up the vg will thin it out a bit. Then shake the hell out of them .

HOWEVER, a 2mm coil that is atleast 2-3mm from the deck should provide better airflow, since the 3mm coils are usually a little restricting. Especially if the coil isnt far from the airhole.  Also, what nic level are you using? Compared to an EVOD or an aerotank the kayfun packs waaaay more of a punch, try upping your VG ratios or lowering your nic."

If you build a larger cloud style RDA, with a decent build and dial in the airflow correctly you can get really intense flavour.  That being said it all depends on the RDA being used, I try to really dial in and find the sweet spot for said device. Taking in to account: airflow options, chamber size, build deck and drip tip / chuff cap options."

The court cases argue that the Tobacco Products Directive (TPD) violates provisions of the European Treaty, The Treaty of Lisbon and restricts the flow of goods and services.  The report doesn’t state whether Suica is for or against the court cases, but she asked, “Dоеs the Commission consider these court proceedings to be an obstacle to the implementation of the tobacco directive, which should take effect in 2016?  And are there any other obstacles that could potentially endanger the implementation of the Tobacco Directive by the middle of 2016?”  The Commission in its reply stated that the court proceedings did not have a suspensive effect on the implementation, it did not see the court cases posing any obstacles to implementation and that all member states are still bound by the transposition deadline of May 2016.  The Commission it seems is determined that implementation will go ahead, as planned, and as such has published a detailed implementation plan, that is frequently updated as they work alongside member states and ‘stakeholders’.  One could argue that this determination is hubris on the part of the Commission, yet it appears that it is legally bound to press ahead with the law, even if this Directive is possibly revoked or changed in the very near future."

ecr_eu,3aftla,XtrmJosh,1 point,Fri Jun 19 20:12:14 2015 UTC,No leaking or anything. It has a childproof cap which wasn't correctly seated. When shaking it must have unscrewed itself.

ecr_eu,3afcye,bosshaug,4,Fri Jun 19 17:56:42 2015 UTC,"Hi there. I don't DIY myself, but several of the norwegian vendors have PG/VG and concentrate in stock and you can check some of them out in the sidebar. However, you will not be able to buy nicotine in Norway as it is not legal to sell/import for distribution, but it is fully legal to import as a private person for own use from within the EU. It will still be cheaper to buy everything from outside of Norway though IMO. There are many threads in this subreddit that refers to good vendors that have good deals on PG/VG and concentrate. To help out a little bit I know that Cloudhousevapor have premixed bases you can buy for a reasonable price. You just pick your preferred ratio and nic- level.  Finally, a little FYI: You do not have to buy from UK. You are allowed to purchase from any country within the EU. The old limit for avoiding tax/customs was 200 NOK. From January 2015 this limit is now 350 NOK including shipping (the shipping had no say before as long as the merchandice were under 200 NOK, but that's not the case anymore). Finally, you're allowed to import a month's worth of supply according to norwegian health law (Helseloven). Which means that they have limited us to legally import 350 ml at a time.    Might I suggest you try to use € for the time being when shopping online. The norwegian krone is awfully weak against £.    Hope this was any use to you and good luck sir :).  EDIT:  It seems as I have misquoted the law regarding importing by volume, and I apologize for that.   According to the regulations relating to the manufacture and import of medicines § 3-2, we are allowed to import 3 months worth of supplies, and not 1 month worth as I wrongfully stated earlier.  It does not say anything specific about how much the government regards as 3 months worth of supply:   ved forsendelse fra EØS-området, i løpet av en tremåneders periode, legemidler som samlet utgjør høyst tre måneders forbruk.   (^ when shipped from the EU , during a three-month period , medicines collected does not exceed three months' consumption .)  This can (as many of our laws) be interpeted in many ways. But to be on the safe side, just keep each order to a maximum of 200- 350 ml and you should be fine."

So, if I were to order a 500ml bottle of premixed base w/ nicotine from cloudhouse that would be illegal but if I were to order a couple 100ml bottles that would be ok?   Seriously cant thank you enough, awesome info here. Thanks again."

The issue with these dropper bottles is that I don't think the plastic at the top of the dropper creates a particularly good seal; so your nicotine will oxidise faster.

Until last week.   What I do is either take one of those old silicone drip tip covers (without a hole in it that came on CE4's etc) put it upside down and stuff it in the drip tip, creating a seal. Alternatively, if you have an old ego silicone stand, take the drip tip off you RTA (cthulhu and lemo tried and tested) put the RTA upside down in the silicon stand, again creating a vacuum.   Close you airflow off, then bottom fill your Cthulhu or side fill the Lemo 2.   Once filled, close your side or bottom fill depending on which RTA you have, turn to the correct side up (keeping the silicone stand or cover in place), open AFC, then remove the silicone. Put the drip tip back on if you removed it, put on device and give it a few good hits to make sure any flooding is cleared.   This has been working 100% of the time for me.   To top fill, you should be fine to do the same thing but find something to block the chimney hole.  PS This is Jonny, not Tony as he's rubbish"

Theoretically if you close the airflow and hold the top chimney there isn't any way for juice to go in the deck, but remember that the AFC isn't all that tight, you can't just barely close it off, you have to turn the ring 1/4 of a turn to make it seal decently."

ecr_eu,3a7rc0,Zylias2,5,Wed Jun 17 22:02:26 2015 UTC,"In short, no.  The long version: Generally it's hard work to attain and retain an audience as a reviewer unless your reviews are well produced and have a unique touch to them. Participating in discussions and the community in general, being on social media, giving advice and being knowledgeable, constant learning and being able to take critique are also part of the game. Getting an audience isn't as easy as just posting a link to your IG or blog, it's lazy and will simply take a lot more interaction to get noticed.  Why do we not allow such threads on the sub? Simple, it's the same reason we don't allow vendors to post without asking for permission and going through a couple of steps. Everyone and their dog (or cat) would start spamming their link and we'd end up with a sub that is unpleasant, unreadable, and without value.  Why not a weekly thread? Because it would be the same links getting posted every week, and it wouldn't be looked at after the second week, making it a useless thread. We've recently cut down on the weekly threads because they weren't being used, with the exception of the shoutout/handcheck thread. On that note, we (the moderators) are constantly having to remove posts that belong in that thread.  We do have a 5:1 rule that counts for everyone, and posting links to your reviews is acceptable if they have original content and if you follow that rule. Self-serving content is a big no-no. If the modteam notices that you are posting links just for the sake of getting views, we will remove the posts and issue a warning."
ecr_eu,3a63cs,governmentyard,7,Wed Jun 17 14:56:20 2015 UTC,"They seem to think they aren't bound by UK law or sale of goods act, which isn't the case.   The returning goods timetable  Within seven working days – no-fault returns of goods bought online. Buy goods online or by mail order or catalogue from an UK (or EU) based business, then the Distance Selling Regulations mean you have a NO FAULT right to return goods, provided you tell them within seven working days.  In other words, unlike buying in-store, you have a legal right to send goods back even if they are not faulty.  Within a month – return faulty goods for a full refund. If goods are faulty, whether bought in-store or online, you are entitled to a full refund provided you haven’t ‘accepted them’. In a nutshell, this means you have had time to inspect the goods and reject them.  How long this takes depends on the goods – after all, fully inspecting a brand new £3 million pound yacht may take longer than a 10p plastic whistle. However, as a very rough rule of thumb, ensure you get things back in under a month if you want a refund (the Government is proposing to clarify this rule to give a fixed 30 days to reject everything but perishable goods).  Beyond this, you are only usually entitled to a repair, replacement or partial refund.  Within six months – proving fault is easier. If you return goods before six months and the dispute went to court, it would be for the store to prove the goods weren’t faulty when you bought them.  After that, it’s for you to prove they were. So the burden of proof is far easier in under six months.  Within six years – the longest you have to claim fault. The English statute of limitations says you have six years to bring a claim (five in Scotland), so in effect, that’s the maximum time you have to take back faulty goods.   more info on MSE here: http://blog.moneysavingexpert.com/2013/10/22/how-long-do-you-have-to-take-faulty-goods-back/"

ecr_eu,3a63cs,Mundfein,3,Wed Jun 17 15:36:27 2015 UTC,I thought that it's required by law to have a 2 year warranty in Europe?
ecr_eu,3a63cs,TheGodfather_1992,2,Wed Jun 17 15:05:18 2015 UTC,"Not to belittle the UK, but they tend to sometimes brew their own laws.  But aside from that, yes. Throughout the EU there is a 2 year warranty for electronic devices.  My guess would be the Vendor tries to cheap out of the 2 years by only offering what he's getting from his source. I don't know if that's legal. Maybe the BBB would know."
ecr_eu,3a63cs,Mundfein,1 point,Wed Jun 17 15:31:56 2015 UTC,Our laws actually give you 6 years in which you can get a replacement/repair for faulty goods. So if you purchased a DNA40 device with a faulty screen (a known defect) you have until 2021.

Of course, if the shop has a thing saying it's a 3-6 month lifespan, you can't ""reasonably"" expect anything else."
ecr_eu,3a63cs,Unclefista,2,Wed Jun 17 15:26:47 2015 UTC,"If you can show that you can buy similar items that do the same job for less (not difficult with a VS) the item will be classed as high quality and you should expect a decent life, and they should judge in your favour."
ecr_eu,3a63cs,Unclefista,2,Wed Jun 17 17:34:23 2015 UTC,"Don't worry about it, unlike the US we have proper consumer laws (not hating, just saying). The UK version gives you ""at least"" 1 year warranty with the supplier whoever you bought it from, not the manufacturer).   It's the law. You can't opt out.

ecr_eu,3a5oeo,Nikem45,5,Wed Jun 17 12:46:41 2015 UTC,"My main advice. Buy a scale. Don't listen to people who use syringes, they are heathens :) seriously though, if you get a scale, you literally put your bottle on, turn it on, read how much nic to add, pour it in, press tare, read the next bit, pour, press tare. No need to buy or wash syringes. No need to wear gloves. No mess. Just gangster juice in half the time. Plus it's more accurate and easier to replicate.   You need 0.00g scales, like the ones you can buy in herb and funny looking vase shops. Bearing in mind, a 50ml bottle of juice will weight around 67g so you will want some that can measure to a fairly high amount. Mine are 500g Max, so I can mix just more than 400ml of juice in one bottle/batch."
ecr_eu,3a5oeo,goldfish_of_chaos,2,Wed Jun 17 14:23:56 2015 UTC,"Agree, I tried the syringe route when I first started, pain in the arse. Nearly gave in. The I discovered the weight method and it was like a revelation.   You make your own PG/VG/nic (VPG)  beforehand and it's even easier."

ecr_eu,3a6jig,vapourdepot,1 point,Wed Jun 17 17:22:37 2015 UTC,I don't really know if it was me that broke it.. Like I wasn't very forceful with it.. maybe I'll stick to pre-built coils lol
ecr_eu,3a6jig,vapourdepot,1 point,Wed Jun 17 17:35:01 2015 UTC,Can you post a pic of where it broke? It maybe a weak part of the RBA base

ecr_eu,3a6jig,metans,1 point,Wed Jun 17 17:50:54 2015 UTC,Is there any broken part left inside the screw hole? Cos the kit comes with spare screws doesn't it? Or do you mean the whole positive post sorta setup?
ecr_eu,3a6jig,AllRichC,1 point,Wed Jun 17 17:55:08 2015 UTC,Yes the whole positive post hold on let me get a photo

I take it it won't just 'pop' back on like its pressure fit or something? It's actually sheared apart yeah?  Also: is it a genuine product? Did you verify it with the QR code? I'm hoping this won't become the subox's ""problem"" and start happening to others... At least it's not auto firing though, eh?"
ecr_eu,3a6jig,AllRichC,1 point,Wed Jun 17 19:06:37 2015 UTC,Yup it's verified etc. I'm not sure what caused it I will try fix later
ecr_eu,3a6jig,vapourdepot,1 point,Wed Jun 17 19:36:17 2015 UTC,Sounds like the air flow pin at the bottom unscrewed itself. You can reattach it. The pin goes right the way through to the deck and you screw from the bottom. That's abit of a garbled instruction I know Phil Buesardo took one apart to show the insulators off find his review on the subtank mini.
ecr_eu,3a6jig,ganjadan,1 point,Wed Jun 17 17:58:07 2015 UTC,Tried pretty much everything. I don't think it's coming back on.. I'll try again later

ecr_eu,3a508n,Daztastic,1 point,Wed Jun 17 07:26:26 2015 UTC,I vape at 35J 232C which is around 449F with an Lemo RTA at 0.07ohms. Above that and the cotton starts to burn. So you're pretty much in the ballpark to be honest.   I presume the cooler vape is because of higher airflow on an RDA.
ecr_eu,3a508n,borez,1 point,Wed Jun 17 07:36:46 2015 UTC,I think so.  The Dark Horse is too airy for me to so I'm assuming it will be much warmer on something else.  Yet another new shiny to buy!  Thanks for the help.
ecr_eu,3a508n,deckartcain,1 point,Wed Jun 17 09:09:22 2015 UTC,You can get that thing shut down a lot. Look it up..
ecr_eu,3a508n,goldfish_of_chaos,1 point,Wed Jun 17 12:23:08 2015 UTC,I found the hobo best for tc as it has grub screws and you can turn the top cap to single low airflow   I don't think you are going to get the same vape on tc as kanthal. I missed the warmth too much so switched back to regular kanthal builds.
ecr_eu,3a508n,goldfish_of_chaos,1 point,Wed Jun 17 07:49:36 2015 UTC,Thanks for that.  I'll take a gander at the Hobo.  I'm slowly getting closer to the heat that I like -  40J 475F. I'm just not certain that I'm going too high or if it's OK to stay around there (or maybe just a tad higber) or if there's a better setting.
ecr_eu,3a508n,sjugge,2,Wed Jun 17 08:23:32 2015 UTC,I don't find changing the joules makes that much of a difference. I stuck around 210 degrees as I'm a fanny and don't want dry hits.
ecr_eu,3a508n,justjohn77,1 point,Wed Jun 17 08:25:31 2015 UTC,I assume you're talking Celsius? That works out to ~410F I think which feels too cool for me at the moment.  It may be that I just need to get used to it.  Time will tell I suppose.  Thanks for your input.

But it doesn't change the fact I'm still sceptical on using lipos. And since Evolv assumes it'll work with 3 18650's, I'll go for some SX and Ares OS goodness for starters."
ecr_eu,3a2t4t,sjugge,3,Tue Jun 16 20:13:19 2015 UTC,"Why skeptical about LiPo? I think they're superior, personally, but I'm happy we can offer both options.  I'm getting the DNA myself, but the Ares is really my baby of course. =P"

ecr_eu,3a2t4t,sjugge,2,Tue Jun 16 20:17:32 2015 UTC,"Well, I trust my 18650's I'm not sure if I can trust lipos as much. Especially since they seem to be a key player in some horror stories. Additionally I can carry extra 18650's around when away from an outlet for prolonged times. Admitted, I'll carry an external battery bank around at times that has lipos in it. But I paid good money for it be sure I'm as safe as I can be. Depending on the results of the board on 18650 and lipos, I'll may have to get into lipos anyway ;)  Additionally, I like the Ares concept. Finally something that peaks my interest to get more into arduino etc. On the other hand, I may bump into a lurning curve (as a self-taught techy guy) which I could be too lazy too tackle and it seems that Evolv may be lowering the threshold on that front. Though I have a feeling someone will do the same for the Ares OS (like puphpet is doing for vagrant for instance)."

I was one of the 3 comp winners so I'll stick a few thoughts in here.  Gabriella - totally agree with everything you say - this juice is just superb in every way.   Lilith - Not quite up to the heights of Gabby, but still delicious and worth buying again.  Ishmael - not a fan of artificial banana, so won't be buying more. Still decently vapeable, like a better version of MBV's Banana Nut Bread.  Ophelia - must have got a bad bottle. Virtually zero menthol, too harsh, nothing to recommend this at all. Will vape the bottle but only because I'm a cheapskate who only throws stuff away when it's literally unvapeable.  I also got a leaky bottle like that guy who did the video review. I know the labels are/were being upgraded, so I hope the bottles are too."

The only one that came close was StrawPearDew and the melon flavour in it specifically.  Edit: In an ideal world, I'd like to try both ranges again with their flavour percentages doubled."

ecr_eu,3a1y9w,TheGodfather_1992,2,Wed Jun 17 05:33:35 2015 UTC,"StrawPearDew as well as the other LiquidVoyage juices were very intense to me, I think more flavoring would make it harsh and unvapeable even.  Both the Goblin and ST Plus perform perfectly in terms of flavor for me. The Goblin has a 0.3ohm build wicked with rayon and the flavor is anything but subtle, even with Flavourlab which is more subtle.  I'd almost dare say you might be struggling with chronic olfactory fatigue, since you describe a few flavors I know are very intense."
ecr_eu,3a1y9w,hapticsquid,1 point,Tue Jun 16 18:21:13 2015 UTC,"ST: Twisted 0.35mm at 0.7 ohms and a normal 0.40mm at 0.6 ohms  Goblin: Dual twisted 0.35mm at 0.35 ohms and a dual normal 0.40mm at 0.4ohms  All builds used both cotton and rayon.   I should mention that I probably could have steeped them for longer - at most, they got about 10 days with a day of heat steeping them included. I tried both within the first few days and then again after the 7-10 day mark and while there was some change in flavour intensity, none of them really struck me as strong with the except of SPD which was still weaker than I like.  Vaper's tongue is a possibility but I was able to switch to some homemade juices that I know to be quite intense, one of which is almost too intense in the Goblin, and both were as I would expect them to taste. Swapping back to the LV and FL juices and there was no real difference.  I really just think that what is intense for you is very different for me. :)"

ecr_eu,3a1y9w,hapticsquid,2,Wed Jun 17 00:49:00 2015 UTC,"Do you like absinthe? Digby's Dr Jekyll is a monster of intense flavour. Creamy, complex and well balanced too.  Guaranteed to blow your socks off.    I think you'll like NovaVapes when they arrive. A ton of flavour in those.    Also some of Elements Dripper range  (US juice) - packed with big, clean, very natural tasting flavours at 80%VG. Closest comparison is what FlavourLab is doing but the flavours are generally more intense. Judging by the way they gunk-up coils faster than anything else I've tried they are using a crap tonne of flavouring in the other 20%."
ecr_eu,3a1y9w,Nikem45,2,Tue Jun 16 17:30:52 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply.  Both you and /u/SirRisc have mentioned US juices and in the same Hangout that I mentioned in my OP, there was some discussion about US vs EU juices and how US juices tend to much sweeter. And to be honest, I think that's probably more what I'm looking for. I don't want a juice that tastes like Coca-Cola, I want to basically vape Coca-Cola, if you get what I mean? I'll look into both though.  Another quick question considering you touched on coil gunk - how did you find FlavourLab's juices in terms of gunking up coils? I've been pretty sick the last few days so haven't been vaping much but I think I went through maybe 4-5 tanks of FL over the weekend on new coils and they looked like they were a month old when I re-wicked yesterday."
ecr_eu,3a1y9w,whyisitnotworking,3,Tue Jun 16 17:40:47 2015 UTC,"I haven't noticed any gunk buildup on my coils with Flavourlab, in fact I noticed less gunking with the FL juice in comparison with the other juices I've been vaping."
ecr_eu,3a1y9w,gardvar,1 point,Tue Jun 16 18:22:40 2015 UTC,Interesting. I re-wicked and cleaned yesterday morning so I'll see if it happens again. I had honestly expected the FL juices to be cleaner considering how they make their flavours.

I love all of the juices from their original series except for on the storm which did not fit my flavour profile at all. My favourite is Into the Wild. I'm not a big fan of their new Vaponaute 24 liquids though, but I know many disagree with me.  I also think that 5pawns flavours are quite intense, try castle long if you want to try something really good.  I've heard that the thenancara liquids are really packed with flavour as well, but I've never tried them, also Dr Stanley Clarkes snake oil is a really intense flavour (and one of my favourites as well)."

I have an Atlantis and while it's OK and it was really good when I started out, it really doesn't provide anything over other tanks. The coils are fuck expensive and don't perform wonderfully, or for very long, it doesn't hold much juice, and the flavour is pretty sub-par.  The only major draw of this tank is that you don't need to build coils like on the highly superior Cthulhu, but the Atlantis isn't even the best prebuilt coil head device, the subtank mini is.  Really hard to recommend: will have to see how this new tank performs..."

I order my base liquids from a german shop called avoria-liquids.de. unfortunately they don't have an english translation of their shop."

Are this bases good ?  I was looking at this one :  http://www.avoria-liquids.de/detail/index/sArticle/240/sCategory/11  I have one more question about that. There where you can choose Pg or vg, etc, there are is something i dont understand.  VPG(55,53,10) VPG(50,50) Velvet (80,20) ICE(90,10) VPG(65,35)"
ecr_eu,3a0ruk,iliketohideincloset,1 point,Tue Jun 16 09:56:01 2015 UTC,"You are welcome. They offer premixed base liquid in different strenght from 6mg up to 36mg. I prefer to order zero nic VG and zero nic PG and as well as 36mg PG and then mix the preffered vg/pg/nic ration on my own because I normally use 60vg/40pg at 3mg nic in my diy liquids. If you are looking for some pre-mixed 50/50 blend i can assure you that they are high quality. They as well carry some high vg dripper base which they offer in 3mg nic as well.   Cheapest would be getting vg/pg and nic seperately. I normally order 1l zero nic VG, 1l zero nic PG and 100ml 36mg PG for my diy."
ecr_eu,3a0ruk,iliketohideincloset,1 point,Tue Jun 16 10:01:16 2015 UTC,I will probably order base with nicotine already mixed in. Is 6mg of nicotine too much ? or why do you mix it to 3mg ?   ANd i still dont kow what that vpg means and velvet and ice.... ?  ANd whats the difference if you get for expample 100% VG or 80%VG mixed with 20% of water  Ok i think i did figure it out. VPG is a mix between VP and PG right ?
ecr_eu,3a0ruk,iliketohideincloset,1 point,Tue Jun 16 10:35:44 2015 UTC,VPG means that this is a pre-mixed vg/pg/nic base at your preffered nic ration. They carry 50vg/50pg or 45vg/65pg. Velvet is vg and water and ice is pg and water.  As i dropped my nic rate constantly because of the throat hit... I love the nicotine buzz of 3mg and can do lung inhales without coughing ;)  What base to buy depends on your hardware.. what vaping gear do you have?  Edit:    Propylenglykol (PG) Glycerin (VG) VPG 55/35/10 ( 55%PG / 35% VG / 10% H²o) VPG 65/35 ( 65%PG / 35%VG) VPG 50/50 ( 50%PG / 50%VG) ICE 90/10 ( 90%PG / 10%H²o) Velvet 80/20 ( 80%VG / 20%H²o)

ecr_eu,3a0ruk,needed_a_better_name,1 point,Tue Jun 16 12:05:51 2015 UTC,For the Subox i would suggest mixing 60vg and 40pg to avoid getting dry hits. The Subtank Mini is pretty much designed for direct lung inhales and produces a lot of vapor... depends on your liking but I guess 3mg or 6mg base should do the trick.  100% VG wont work without getting dry hits in Subtank Mini / Subox I guess.  As I only can speak for myself and don't want to get blamed afterwards... it's your decision. You have figure out what works best for you. I still use 50vg/50pg blends in my tanks and am totally fine with that.

Sorry that i ask so much question, but im new and dont know shit =)"
ecr_eu,3a0ruk,iliketohideincloset,1 point,Tue Jun 16 12:55:31 2015 UTC,Water is added to make them thinner. Most older clearomizers need thinner juice to work proper. Most newer tanks like those subohm tanks  can handle thicker liquids very well.  If you order 100ml 6mg and 100ml 0mg you will get 200ml of 3mg if you put them together.
ecr_eu,3a0ruk,nikitko,1 point,Tue Jun 16 13:11:08 2015 UTC,"I have ordered VPG(50,50) from them a whilte ago, can't complain, it's great. I have 1 liter of 0mg, 100ml of 32mg which give you around 3.2mg juice if mixed, but you can buy 3mg premixed from them as well which costs a bit more.  Try their Fresh Mafia Cream aroma too while you are there :)"

ecr_eu,39xnk9,overachiever,2,Mon Jun 15 19:07:38 2015 UTC,"Question to the DIYers and juice makers here, to help me understand this DA and AP thing. As I understand it, the flavourings that you can buy come from a narrow selection of companies. Does the flavouring manufacturer/vendor declare that they are DA and AP free? Or do you know that from another source? Just trying to understand how one might have some confidence that a juice with buttery/creamy flavourings is likely to DA or AP free (or contains only a low level), in the absence of getting the stuff tested in a lab.  Or do they all contain some? Sorry if this is a simplistic question."
ecr_eu,39xnk9,hapticsquid,2,Mon Jun 15 20:20:24 2015 UTC,Some like TFA do include MSDS information.  Not sure if any other vendors do this and some like Flavor West apparently lie about what's in their concentrates (there was a post about FW yogurt on global a few days ago).

The only insulation is a .5cm piece of plastic tape on the board and it can be placed wrong at the factory or knocked around later.  To check if you have the fault, measure your batteries with a multimeter after using them and if one has discharged more than the other, it's shorting. Also, the red LED above the charge port can come on if it's shorting as well.  It's an easy enough fix if you're comfortable digging around in there. Just have to clip 3 wires and cap them off with electrical tape or heat shrink tubing. Someone made instructions for it."

I ask you, sir, who the fuck should I give me damned money to?  So far as I'm aware, there isn't so much a fault with the device as a minor flaw. I don't know the details, so feel free to correct me where appropriate, but there seems to be some scenario where you can cause something on the PCB to short against the case. Presumably this scenario only occurs where the device itself suffers some form of irresponsible use, such as excessive pressure on the button or dropping the device onto hard surfaces. If that's the case, it's not a fault and it's something that a user can easily address by taking care of their device. As I said, I don't really know, I'm just guessing. I haven't heard of this issue before and pay very little attention to regulated devices (I'm a hybrid fanboy, what more can I say?)  Seriously, though, most devices have some sort of dangerous flaws.

As it is, however, they're marketing these things as safe and easy to use, while under normal and predictable conditions of usage they most clearly aren't.

ecr_eu,39wn1h,Natin_online,6,Mon Jun 15 12:07:30 2015 UTC,"Hey and welcome to Reddit and /r/ecr_eu  First off. I should point out a few things regarding safety. When rebuilding, make sure you have an ohm meter or a device that can measure the resistance of your coils. If not to know the resistance, then to check for shorts.  When using a mech mod, you're taking out all safety that regulated devices offer. Make sure your coil is not shorted, that your batteries can handle the amps they will be pushing and make sure your device can't auto fire.   Now I don't have a vapor giant RTA but going by what I do know and see, this is a typical Kayfun-like deck.  I usually use regulated devices these days but I do like to rock a mech as well. What you could expect is that the first 10 or so puffs may feel overpowered before after which the batteries voltage will gradually go down. This can be troublesome if your builds range isn't wide enough to handle the volts being discharged.  It should be able to handle 4.2 volts (fresh battery) but still perform around 3.7 / 3.8 volts (the normal discharge rate). I think that's why you don't hear a lot of mech and rta combo's. I really got my rta build down to an exact science so I know it'll work and I know when my battery needs to be swapped out. But it took me quite a while to get there. RDA'S are more forgiving and they are easier to re-wick in case something goes wrong.   So in short, a mech and RTA will work. But you may be confronted with a steeper learning curve. You may want to start out using the RTA on a regulated device until you get your builds right for straight battery voltage. And most importantly, until you know your builds are safe and stable throughout the day.   I'm sure if any of this info is incomplete or wrong, someone will be kind enough to jump in ;)"
ecr_eu,39wn1h,sjugge,5,Mon Jun 15 12:32:00 2015 UTC,"I second everything said above, with the added thought of voltage drop, which is where the voltage going to your coil is lowered by the total resistance of the actual device.     My mech tends to push around 3.6 on a  fresh battery, so I am effectively loosing around 0.6 V, Try using your regulated devices at around 3V to get a feel for how a mech will vape with that set up."
ecr_eu,39wn1h,SmooDiver87,2,Mon Jun 15 13:35:49 2015 UTC,Very valid point. It's something I tend to forget to take in account. But it is a very really thing. There's inline voltmeter that can shed a light on this if you want to get all the numbers. Though their accuracy is debatable.
ecr_eu,39wn1h,sjugge,2,Mon Jun 15 13:49:01 2015 UTC,"I've seen some rewievs of my mechanical, and there was one guy testing it out for voltage drop, excuse me, can't remember the number but after the test he pointed out that the voltage drop was realy small. After calculating he ended up with 0.04 of efective voltage drop. I looked it up."
ecr_eu,39wn1h,SmooDiver87,1 point,Wed Jun 17 23:58:21 2015 UTC,"Voltage drop will increase with the load on the battery, lower resistance pulls more amps from the battery, where the difference between the resistance of the  device and your coil is also smaller. Thus you produce a greater amount of amps and loose a significantly greater amount through the devices internal resistance.  my example was with an 0.2 ohm coil"
ecr_eu,39wn1h,Riddla26,2,Thu Jun 18 12:53:21 2015 UTC,"In addition, have a pre-formatted comment:  Hey, here's some helpful links.  Look up the amp limit of your battery here and plug those numbers into the calculator to know what ohm to aim for safely. NEVER EXCEED YOUR AMP LIMIT.  Then use this to plan / make it."
ecr_eu,39wn1h,sjugge,1 point,Mon Jun 15 15:40:08 2015 UTC,"Oh cool thanks for the link. Exactly what I was thinking about a day ago  Is there a place online where can I check my batteries c raitings. Have some vtc4's and 5's. Will check it out for sure.   Have a question if you don't mind.  At wich kind of level of baterie I should stop using it and recharge it? Depends on the battery, or should I just go to 3.2?  Cause I've red some posts, some say 3.6 cause the cell won't get damaged, some points out 3.5 and so on."
ecr_eu,39wn1h,SpunkingMonkey,1 point,Wed Jun 17 23:51:01 2015 UTC,I think I drained a battery once to 3.2 on a mech and performance was really bad. You'll probably notice something is off by the time you reach 3.6 volts. Which would be a good time required recharge.
ecr_eu,39y87f,Slovaper,5,Mon Jun 15 19:37:14 2015 UTC,Hey welcome! For diy its worth looking at the diy section on www.wikivapia.org theres some solid information there.  With coils its cheaper to make your own and its pretty easy :) you will need an ohm reader though.   With the subox have you picked up a battery?

I hope i picked up a good battery =).  About the coils, i know its cheaper to make it on your own from wire. But you get 50 premade coils for 2 $ from fasttech, so thats not expensive too + i dont need the ohm metter =). I just dont know what premade coils to pick from fastech, can you please provide me correct links. (or are those 2 links that i post in previous post correct ?).  About the eliquids, i will check the pages you provided and if i wont know something i will ask here =)  Ty for your help"
ecr_eu,39y87f,Krauzber,1 point,Tue Jun 16 08:00:07 2015 UTC,"The clone coils are probably not they way to go. Get some legitimate OCC kanger coils and some kanthal+cotton and start rebuilding as fast as you can, you wont be bound by the rebuildable section but it would serve you well to try out rebuilding since you have a rebuildable base with the Subtank Mini, yes?  50/50 vg/pg replicates the throathit from smoking well. A mix with more VG is less harsh but tastes less.  personally i would order a ready made 50/50 base with your choice of nic from www.pink-mule.com together with some flavors.  But as i said, do a quick read-up on rebuilding. Its really not hard at all once you get into it and provides better economy, flavor and performance.  Edit: Derp, read the post before you reply dumbass (me). Either of those pre-coiled coils from fasttech would work but provide a little bit of a different vape. i would still say just order kanthal and coil them yourself, but if you dont want to i would suggest getting 1*50 of each."

ecr_eu,39y87f,NovaVapes,1 point,Tue Jun 16 08:21:57 2015 UTC,"As long as you're not going subohm you wouldn't really need an ohm reader with a regulated mod imo.   28g/29g is a good choice to start out with and easily build 1ohm+ coils.  Muji is a nice cheap Japanese cotton to get you started.   You can wrap around anything really, as long as it's round :) I started out wrapping around the tiny screwdrivers that you get with mods/attys. Drill bits are a popular choice too, since you have different sizes."

I had my eye on the cloudmaker whiteout, it does look rather nice now they've gotten rid of the screws by the buttons http://imgur.com/faSnlyW but, to be honest, I only love box mods until I put an atty on top of them, then the form factor is ruined for me. Railbox will probably sate my desires for new tech for quite a while.  The only downer with it is drippers, which could work but I just don't think are quite right for it.

ecr_eu,39wkne,metans,1 point,Mon Jun 15 15:10:29 2015 UTC,"Where's the logo on your Subtank mini? It should start with the ""K"" of ""Kangertech"" about in line with the fire button. If it doesn't, then it's probably too loose and will let juice go into the chimney!  Source: found out the airflow section screws into the cage part a lot further than it originally seems!"
ecr_eu,39wkne,grmpfl,1 point,Mon Jun 15 16:20:44 2015 UTC,"i have that sometimes as well. the cotton has to fit pretty tight through the coil, and not too much cotton on the outside and free the juice channels.  works for me"
ecr_eu,39wkne,XtrmJosh,1 point,Mon Jun 15 19:19:08 2015 UTC,"This is a common wicking / coil building problem. Possible causes:   The gaps in your coil are either too small or too large. If you are aiming for a tight coil without gaps, make sure there are no gaps at all. If aiming for a loose coil with gaps, make sure those gaps are bigger than the thickness of your wire (as a general rule, applies to anything over .24mm kanthal, everything under should be .24mm gaps at least). You're not using enough cotton. This will effectively force juice to build up inside the coil, drawn up by the wick. When you fire, that juice boils off instead of vapourising, effectively spitting balls of very hot liquid into your mouth. It might not feel that hot, since they are small they cool quickly. You're using too much cotton. Using too much cotton has a similar effect to the above, but it causes liquid to sit on the outside of the coil instead of inside, in larger quantities than is appropriate. This, again, boils off and spits at you. Your wick isn't shaped appropriately. If you have a horizontal coil, and the wick comes out both ends, if the wick is ""pressed up"" against something at the point at which it exits either side of the coil, this will cause a buildup towards one end of the coil. That, in turn, means yet again boiling and spitting.   Honestly, as much as it's a bit of a tosspot thing to say, I'd strongly recommend watching a few videos to try better guage how much wick to use, how to space out coils, and how to position them within the deck."
ecr_eu,39trby,JMH71,5,Sun Jun 14 18:18:33 2015 UTC,"Nice review, I've been using the same OCC coil for over two weeks now and it's still good! I guess I don't vape as much as you as I only have to charge the battery overnight and even by that point it's probably only about halfway empty ;)  No paint issues with mine yet, I have had some minor leakage but I've found that the worst of it (and by worst I really do only mean like a small bit) has come from having the device led down, which I have to in my car, and sometimes a tiny smear can leave from the air flows - I found the airflow section needs to be screwed in TIGHT to the cage, and I mean tight because it goes so much further than you think. Basically, if the Kangertech logo is on the right of the Subtank when you screw it onto the kbox, it's not tight enough. It needs to be more like the Kangertech logo starts about in line with the fire button, and even then it might be able to go more but it daren't force it and break it. If the base is screwed in so the logo starts halfway round the front, I never get leakage. You'd think the logo should be on the front, I mean maybe mine was made wrong. Just thought that may be of some use to you.  edit: checked out a picture of it on a vendor website, the logo looks like it is meant to start around the middle of the Subtank apparently  edit edit: from the picture of your nice clean coil, it looks like your airflow section isn't screwed in to the tank far enough, it can go another half turn round from there - as it is I would say that the chimney isn't screwed into the top of your OCC enough so juice is leaking into the chimney, and going either up through the drip tip or right down through the centre of the coil and out of the airflow instead of being soaked up by the wick through the wick holes as it should be, try that out but nice and slow and I bet it'll solve the worst of your leaking problems!  I've had juice up the drip tip a couple of times, but mainly if I've had the thing upside down for a little bit, like if I'm taking too long refilling or something. Touch wood I've never had to swallow a load from it yet.  Drip tip - I thought the stock one got way too hot, I only ever have this this in the mid 20's and it got atomic real quick. I swapped it out for a 2puffs tip (you can also just make out the logo placement on the tank like I was talking about) and it's much better than the original. On the OCC it was fine, gets a touch warmer using the RBA section I've found. Oddly, I've got a 0.7 in that at the moment, I would have thought that would be a bit cooler if anything but hey-oh. Could be my juice, who knows.  But anyways, I'm really liking mine as I never had a box before, only a regulated tube which was weak, and a mech which was obviously very basic. Suck about the fixed 510 too, but I know my big block works on it just fine (it's actually better on here than on my Sir Lancelot I think) but strangely my Kanger Genitank Mega doesn't have a long enough positive pin to reach. What's up with that, Kanger?! It's your own damn brand!  Oh yeah and about the awkward pinkie placement? Try out my patented paranoid-I'll-drop-it grip!"

ecr_eu,39trby,metans,1 point,Sun Jun 14 19:41:39 2015 UTC,"Think it will help at least a bit, like I say I thought it was fully screwed in when the logo was on the side, but once I discovered it could turn more it just hasn't leaked at all yet. Give it a shot, and it should do you right!"
ecr_eu,39trby,Dumbgecko,3,Sun Jun 14 19:46:44 2015 UTC,"Well written and very down to earth, nice work! The gurgling Could be juice but the other possibility is condensation forming in the chimney"

ecr_eu,39trby,ganjadan,2,Sun Jun 14 19:32:07 2015 UTC,"When turning it upside down and there being a spot of juice on the desk, I think that must be condensation. I suffer greatly with condensation in the chimney and drip tip of my subtank mini and 25mm. So much so, I have to shove a paper towel in the drip tip and chimney a couple of times per day. My fix for leaky occ's is to screw the tank down just a little bit past finger tight, and on the 25mm one I also turned the bottom glass sealing o-ring upside down. 25mm hasn't leaked once since.

My one bottle of Pink Custard I think was all done in my Lemo at 1.2 ohm and 18W & tasted fine though that was just the tank I happened to be using, mostly I'm at around 0.5 in tanks and drippers. Graham's Custard however was very nice at 0.4 ohm & 45W in Cthulhu and Hellboy so could vary from juice to juice. I do see advice that custards and dairy flavours can taste cooked at too high power but tend to ignore it, maybe I shouldn't :/"

Heavy weight, good hand feel, temp control does pulse a bit, and it's odd to use at first since there isn't any mention how to use it in the manual. You have to set the wattage and the temp.  No issues on using mods with it so far, using the El Cabrone and the Mephisto.   Only complaints are cosmetic: the glass plates scratch and I don't think I can replace them (issue of you drop it), and they attract so many fingerprints. I cpuld get a screen protector, but it would have to be cut down to size.   The magnet battery door is nice, and i've had even hits on it so far, using 25Rs' and 30A Efests. Both married pairs. For temp control, I leave the wattage around 50w, temp at around 500, running dual 28g nickel coils. It has a really cool and smooth hit. I'm happy with it.

ecr_eu,39t650,sjugge,2,Mon Jun 15 18:54:32 2015 UTC,"Just a heads up. The board seems to assume nickel by default. As such it doesn't regulate the first 2 seconds or so when firing on a kanthal topper. My inline voltmeter tells me that 4.2 volt are being dumped until the board knows it's kanthal. After that it regulates as advertised. I have the feeling that when it auto-locks, it goes back to nickel mode.   Now, it's wonky behaviour ofcourse but for a mod for this price, I don't think we can expect Evolv or even Yihi quality. In the end, better to assume nickel than kanthal. Firing non-temp controled watts through nickel seriously sucks."

ecr_eu,39t650,sjugge,1 point,Tue Jun 16 21:44:05 2015 UTC,"Ah bugger. I hate it when vape mail doesn't arrive on the planned day.   The screen is a bit weird, but it's kind of a cool flaw I think. I think the board is on the limit of it's resources resulting in a wave-y refresh. It's like a camera is picking up another screen and the frame rates are out of wack.  Other than that, it's a heavy one. 300gr I think without batteries. So with batteries and a topper, you'll be pushing towards 500gr. Nice workout ;)  The finish and build quality is good. Not stellar but good for it's price.  The 510 should've been a bit more to the middle. 22mm toppers sit just slightly over where the corner is rounding. I really like the look and finish of it. Bit of a mix of heavy duty bad-ass (ss) and sleekness (glass).   I think I'll enjoy this one, albeit predominantly at home due to size, weight, glass. But that was the plan anyway. I think over time I may transplant another board in it. I haven't taken it apart yet but there seems to be ample room to work with.   No regrats so far on this one."
ecr_eu,39t650,martialartsaudiobook,2,Tue Jun 16 22:47:09 2015 UTC,"so i recieved mine at around 3pm this afternoon and been playing with it all evening. Honestly im loving it, dual claptons in a turbo rda, 100w is lovely, dense warm vapour which coming from an istick 50w i was pleasently surprised by. TC seems to work well, first attempt i got a dual nickle build working in the cthulhu and ran that sucker dry, no dry hits what so ever. No regrets what so ever"

A lot of people are looking at the Sigelei Mini which is 30watts (variable wattage). It takes a single 18650. If that's not enough power, there's the Sigelei 100w/100w+/150w which are all dual 18650 and range up to 150watts.  As for drippers; old faithful, the Tobeco Tugboat V2, is one of the best. Large drip well and flavour for days!  Personally, I have a Smok M80+ that goes with my Tugboat and my Royal Hunter.   The M80+ is 80watt capable but does not have removable 18650s. The Royal Hunter is a bit or a cloud chasing RDA, so maybe not for yourself."

Although i do tend to use it in regular wattage mode more than TC, im finding a battery can last me 1/2-3/4 of a day. (it all goes to shit when i get home after a day out though!)"
ecr_eu,39lqqw,cloudhousevapor,1 point,Sat Jun 13 01:41:50 2015 UTC,"Well all I can say is I've been using mine every day for a month, I work outdoors it gets dirty, dusty, wet, oily, bashed and had really no issues other than sometimes turning itself off if it gets jolted hard. I got mine from Gearbest for £38 delivered.    From what I read short battery life is an issue in TC mode though, I only use it with Kanthal atm. But prob not much different to any single 18650 mod in TC."
ecr_eu,39lqqw,hapticsquid,2,Fri Jun 12 17:17:32 2015 UTC,"You won't want to hear this, but I agree with /u/sovreign. I gladly spent a bit more to get reliable gear that'll last me. I have an SX Mini (sans TC) and this thing is solid as a rock. /u/borez will be able to give any input on the quality of the M class.   That being said, I'm hearing good things on the Snow Wolf 200w. I picked one up for €118, but it's still on the way so I can't recommend it just yet.  Also quite a bit of glass (?) so maybe not the one you're looking for right now."
ecr_eu,39lqqw,Bahnhofsviertel,2,Fri Jun 12 17:07:31 2015 UTC,I believe that the SX Mini is a great mod but I just can't afford it tbh. I'm doing a apprenticeship and I need to pay off my car so 50 bucks is so much money for me.   The Snow Wolf is way to large. I don't need 200w I rarely went over 30 on the iStick.
ecr_eu,39lqqw,Bahnhofsviertel,2,Fri Jun 12 17:09:30 2015 UTC,"Myeah. Budget, been there, done that. Let's see what we can come up with.   Paging /u/cloudhousevapor : what budget mod would you recommend here? I know you have some nice stock but not to have experience with. Any tried and tested that ticks all the boxes here?"
ecr_eu,39lqqw,ganjadan,5,Fri Jun 12 17:15:29 2015 UTC,"Well hello there! This is a bit of a tough question right now. There is so much new gear coming out that it is hard to keep up. I haven't had a chance to try the subox (although my supplier shipped them today!), so I can't recommend it without having tried it.   It you are looking for a solid device, at a low cost, and with a replaceable battery I would have to say the IPV Mini 2. The price is pretty great, and the size is fantastic. It is 70W, which is more than 90% of people out there will ever need. On top of that I have not had a single unit returned. Not one bad unit has shipped, which is more than I can say for any other piece of hardware I carry. It is my mod for going out into the world, since it is easy to pocket.   The only problem I have with it is the battery cap. Sometimes it is a bitch to line up right, so it can be difficult to screw on after more than a few beers.   Okay, let the IPV haters begin responding!"

ecr_eu,39lqqw,DropKickRick,1 point,Fri Jun 12 21:04:26 2015 UTC,Then go for the sigelei mini or the cloupor mini. Both are solid and have replaceable batteries. The cloupor mini is 30$ on fasttech(That's where I got mine). Around 50€ in german shops. Mine's running for 4 months without issues. I just never charge through usb.

The dual coil slots are exactly opposite one another, unlike how they appear in the image on the site. Maybe I lucked out, or maybe they have improved the design, but if misaligned air slots are the only thing holding you back then its worth a punt for £8.74. The Copper drip tip is nasty though, I've been using the black wide boor tip.  Avoid this Airek https://www.fasttech.com/product/2045801 it is junk - the centre post lifts when you attach the Atty and could easily cause a shorted battery.  If you're after a mini RDA, the Derringer https://www.fasttech.com/product/2106600 and Mini Haze  https://www.fasttech.com/product/2296901 are both good buys.

The Mini Haze is now in the rotation because it performs just as well. If anything I prefer it because it is less prone to leaking. To be honest, the samurai doesn't get much use.   Is that the Rem on the regulated mod? (HB40?) How is it? I’ve been considering picking one up. Just a bit concerned how much airflow it will have. I'm guessing there are no leaking issues with  that design?"
ecr_eu,39krcj,TheBadStick,2,Sat Jun 13 18:18:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's the REM. I'm really enjoying it so far. More airflow than the Derringer, albeit indirect airflow but its adjustable like the Rouge.  No option for a standard drip tip, the built in one is great though, plus the top cap stays very cool due to the top airflow.  Stupidly large juice wells, and no leaking. My only negative is the non adjustable 510.  Will grab a Haze mini at some point. :)  http://imgur.com/a/vYAt8"

ecr_eu,39knms,JamesMayes,5,Fri Jun 12 11:47:51 2015 UTC,"Hi there, are you completely new to vaping, have you tried any devices before? Would you prefer a cig-a-like/ego (i.e. tube) shaped device or would a box style suit you?    The Joyetech eGo One suggested below is a very good option as you can start on the 1.0ohm coils and move up to the 0.5ohm if you like lung inhaling (it comes with one of each). The Vampire Vapes link, you might be able to get 20% off that price too with code POTV20. You will need to buy a 1amp USB wall charger as I don't think this kit comes with one but they are cheap. Will leave you money left to buy some nice juice. I've been using an eGo One since January, I can answer questions about it if you're curious. EDIT: POTV20 at Vampire Vape is for DIY and juice. You can get 10% off hardware with POTV10.  Moving up in performance, a box mod and tank set-up is doable for under £60 all-in and delivered:    From Vapour Depot: Innokin Coolfire 4 £37 and iSub tank £16 for £53 less 10% discount for reddit10 and then delivery. Still some money left for juice! This sort of set-up gives you a lot more flexibility for the future than the eGo One but if you are a new vaper then bear in mind this is a sub-ohm tank. Also from Vapour Depot there's the very good MVP3 Pro starter kit but will put you about £5 over budget: £69 then 10% off and £1.50 delivery I think. myepack.co.uk has the Coolfire 4 for £33 so same prices as Vapour Depot with their discount and several tanks that would keep you within budget: Subtank Mini V2 (v good choice but might take you over on delivery charges) Isub G (glass version of that iSub above), Freemax Starre and others.    Hope that helps, come back with more questions! edit: I know vapour depot have both card and Paypal option, pretty sure myepack does too but a while since I ordered from them."
ecr_eu,39knms,hapticsquid,2,Fri Jun 12 12:42:29 2015 UTC,"I'm completely new to vaping, I've never vaped before - however I have quit smoking for around a year or so and I've noticed my cravings coming back when I get stressed, so I decided vaping would be the way to go (and it seems like getting into a hobby might be nice too).  I believe the box style would suit me better than a pen/tube style, if I upped my budget a little more would I be getting more value for the money I'm spending?   Also, for a 20/day smoker, how much liquid would I be using per day at maxiumum, this will also probably affect the size of the tank I'll need. Or will this vary on what I have/voltage/etc?  Thank you for your help."
ecr_eu,39knms,hapticsquid,4,Fri Jun 12 14:03:37 2015 UTC,"Well if you've quit for a year already (congratulations!) and are already  off nicotine, then how much you'll find you want/need to vape to keep you from going back to a cigarette is hard to answer. And if you're off nicotine, I wouldn't advise getting yourself hooked on it again.  Start on low nic (3mg, 6mg max) and see if 0mg might do it for you.   My other half for example, she quit an off-on 3 cig a day habit easily three months ago and probably vapes at most 8 to 10ml a month (not joking) of 3mg juice and now says she wants zero mg. She's not bothered about the nicotine and just keeps an ego device around to satisfy the occasional craving - for her it's more about the 'oral fix' of vaping than the nicotine consumption. Me, I quit a long term 20-a-day habit by vaping, started on about 2ml a day of 18mg then 12mg in an ego. Now down to 3mg and 6mg but I get through 5 to 10ml a day now as better devices with more power and lower resistance means more juice consumed and it feels and tastes great so I'm hitting on it much more.  I spend way more of my day vaping than I did smoking (feels like it anyway) because I enjoy it so much and it's become a hobby.    On gear...well certainly £50 - £60 should get you a set-up that ought to meet your needs for quite a while. If you are starting out I'd caution getting a sub-ohm tank as your first device, it can be a bit much for some people who haven't vaped before - they produce a lot of vapour and are intended for 'direct lung inhaling', filling your lungs direct (it's like hitting a bong is what I tell smokers who want a go) rather than 'mouth-to-lung' inhaling which is how many people are used to smoking cigarettes.  But you might love direct lung inhales from the start, everyone's different. Mouth-to-lung works best with a higher resistance atomiser 1 to 1.5 ohm. For that reason a good option would be the Subtank Mini which has the option of 1.2, 1.5 and 0.5 ohm pre-made coils which cover all the bases. All the other tanks mentioned will put you on 0.5ohm coils only. You can pair that Subtank with any of the variable mods mentioned, you don't have to go for the Subox pack though it is good value. Or the Coolfire 4 + Subtank Mini for example if you'd prefer not to have to have to buy extra batteries. Any of these will more than satisfy your needs, it's more down to what you like the looks of best really.    You can find great deals posted here but if you have a local vape shop it would be worth going to get some demos. They won't be as cheap as online but at least you can see and try some devices even if you buy elsewhere.   Edit: And seriously, if you try an ego pen and you think it could satisfy you, buy it and stick with that. No reason to get talked up to bigger and shinier gear if you don't need it."

ecr_eu,39knms,trstn,1 point,Sat Jun 13 00:46:13 2015 UTC,"I go through about 7-8ml per day, but that's probably on the high end.   Depending on how much you use your device (wattage, lower ohm coils) you may use more.   If you end up ordering from us I'll happily throw some juice in :)"
ecr_eu,39knms,kingpool,1 point,Fri Jun 12 14:35:35 2015 UTC,"Don't forget that you've not been a twenty a day smoker for a year, so you probably crave the act of smoking rather than the nicotine - I know that's how I felt when I'd quit.  Is suggest an mvp3 kit and some 6mg liquid, maybe even 0mg nic. That'll see you right for a long time and with it being low strength it'll just give you the release your after rather than lots of nicotine.  With juice you should probably aim for around 50/50 or 60/40 pg/vg. The pg will give a nice throat feel but if you get too high pg it'll probably feel overly harsh."
ecr_eu,39knms,vapourdepot,1 point,Sat Jun 13 00:45:03 2015 UTC,"I think I'll buy some 0mg liquid and some 6mg, I'll try the 0mg and see if I'm fine with that and I'll keep the 6mg as a spare I suppose.  Is it possible for you to link where I could get a mvp3 kit from & will this include a tank or will I have to buy that separate? If so, what tank do you recommend?"
ecr_eu,39knms,Dumbgecko,1 point,Sat Jun 13 05:43:18 2015 UTC,"Also, for a 20/day smoker, how much liquid would I be using per day at maxiumum, this will also probably affect the size of the tank I'll need.    I come from 25-30/day. When I started I used ca 5-7ml 18mg juice per day with ego pen kit. Now after 3 years it has stabilised at around 20ml per week (still 18mg, still ego pen kit). When I get new batch of juice I vape more per day. But in general if I order 20x20ml/18mg juice I know I have enough for at least 20 weeks.  You must consider that more advanced setups go through juice faster, so you may need more. Also you do not want to run out, EVER. So get more juice.   I ran out once when my government banned nic e-juice and it was awful to go back to analogs."

ecr_eu,39gzrc,shinitso,4,Thu Jun 11 17:31:59 2015 UTC,"Spot on review. I've tried 3 out of 4 of these and like them all. Need to get some Tropical Glacier in my next order.    Cobra Venom is just terrific, I never thought I could ADV this flavour profile but I've been proved wrong.    I have the original Grahams Custard and really enjoying it. I've been trying various custard juices from time to time, but generally finding I like the idea of them more than the reality, tbh. This is the only one other than Liquid Voyage Pink Custard I'd buy again. Really good in an RDA. If the new version is better then I'm definitely buying.    Strawberry Milk took a bit more time to get to like. First time, if I blind tasted this I'd have said 'Strawberry Muller Fruit Corner Yoghurt'. In the Holmes and the Tugboat when I first tried it there was an intense jammy strawberry flavour, almost too much so. The strawberry catches my throat in a dripper too, poss I am just a bit sensitive to that particular flavour. I prefer this one in the Cthulhu as it seems better balanced there than in a dripper, at least at 70VG 6mg. I'd like to give this a go again in a dripper at 3mg and 80 or max VG. Bottle is nearly gone, anyway :)    And I agree, just great value for money, there's a depth and balance in these that you don't expect to find in juices at this price."
ecr_eu,39gzrc,hapticsquid,2,Thu Jun 11 19:47:20 2015 UTC,Glad to see you are enjoying our juices!  I vape the strawberry milk at the standard 70/30 but it tends to sit in the zephyr so 3MG to tone down the harshness.   Thanks for the kind words :D

They started off by messing up my order and ignoring my email about it, and then when I tried the Graham Custard (after it had steeped for a week), it just tasted like a disgusting mouthful of butter. Hopefully more steeping will fix that and the Strawberry Milk will be better, but I'm not confident."

Witch's breath (tastes like honey and lemon Lockets)  Blueberry Custard (duh)  Bloody good (blood orange)  Pineapple (again, duh)  Fruit salad (what do I have to spell it out for you?)  They also do a line called ""Mystic vapour"" which is cheaper and comes in smaller bottles (I'm not a shill, honest, they're just the only shop I really went to!)  Blue ice (blueberry menthol) is probably my favourite one from that line but I haven't tried it since I upgraded from a 15w device so god knows what it tastes like at higher power. Hellfire is... Interesting. Chilli, anyone? I've still got most of a bottle left. Maybe I'll do a giveaway!  There's also a Victoria Sponge flavour that my wife's cousin had once, it was the fucking tits. I just cannot remember who the hell makes it. It was fairly pricey and the name was Mrs... Something.

It's the shop that i first went to about 2 years ago when i was quitting fags, and it was always my favourite after that, and it's now by a stroke of fortune, the place where i'm extremely happy to work. We have 8 different premium juice lines, all the hardware you could need or want, and a comfy little couch area where you can sit and rewick or drip and chill to your hearts content. We always have good tunes playing, and we spend a good portion of our time just chatting with regulars and customers about anything and everything.  Everyone that works there is a legit Vaper and definitely at the hobbyist level, and was so before they even started working there. Everybody there loves the community and is all about the vaping.  So yeah. Come see us. I won't be working there tomorrow (sat), but if you happen to stop in on sunday, i'll be the podgy ginger dude blowing the big clouds and chain-drinking energy drinks."

You can find there all kinds of kanthal and many rta's (clones only) Most of the liquids you find in Romania are pretty bad in my opinion, I wasted a lot of money on crap liquids, most people dyi here. There are the cosmic fog liquids which are very good but overpriced here. (26€/30ml) Apart from those I cannot recommend anything premade.  Here is a map of the shop's location:  http://vapez.ro/content/11-showroom  I hope you enjoy your stay in Bucharest, however long it is.  By the way, e-cigs are not illegal in Istanbul or Budapest. I've been there a few times. Hungary has a decent vape community but in turkey it's quite small."

ecr_eu,39gn2v,thechosenfewvapes,1 point,Thu Jun 11 16:46:36 2015 UTC,The two hours heat steep is equal to a few days of natural steeping. It most cases this ensures that by the time your liquids arrive they are fully steeped so we do recommend it.
ecr_eu,39gn2v,NovaVapes,1 point,Thu Jun 11 17:40:20 2015 UTC,"Interested in your heat steeping, what method do you use? Sonic cleaner, hot bath, etc?"

The first batch I tried was freaking awesome, it had the 2h steep. Second batch I got only recieved 1h of heat-steep due to time and the difference between the flavour right out of the pack was fairly big to be honest. The 2h are by far worth it unless you have a month or two to let them sit before trying and you feel that the extra money is a waste."

The ultrasonic cleaner is in fact a highly effective kitchen sink and cupboard rolled up in one so your logic stands to merit ;). It may not be an essential piece of hardware for most vapers, but I find that the time and hazzle saved on cleaning all my attys in one go more than juistifies the cost. A little bit of water, a drop of soap, press the ""on"" button and away we go :). I bought mine in a local store here in Norway, but you might find that Amazon is a good place to start."

ecr_eu,39g5bb,MarlDaeSu,2,Thu Jun 11 21:56:54 2015 UTC,"It will kill off some indeed, but not enough to kill an entire bacteria culture. The heat at the coils would be enough to kill most of them, but the chimney, the little nooks and nudges in a tank or the driptip won't get nearly as hot, and that's where they will thrive. Some of those little critters are very resistant to heat too actually."
ecr_eu,39g5bb,spoilerhead,2,Thu Jun 11 22:07:06 2015 UTC,I believe 70 Celsius is necessary to kill all pathogenic bacteria and up to over 100 for some fungi. Bear in mind the entire atty and air in the atty would need to be at this temp to sterilise it (so coil heat would not be enough)
ecr_eu,39g5bb,sjugge,3,Thu Jun 11 22:41:05 2015 UTC,I wash out my drip tips whenever they feel unclean. And whipe the tank with a wet towel when rewicking.  Otherwise no. PG is a great disinfectant :)

I havent done free weights for a long time so im doing a few weeks pre-conditioning with the machines.  The main goal is to loose some weight, then gain muscle.    I used to be into several martial arts and had the body of a Greek god.  However for several reasons (mainly laziness) I stopped training and kept eating like an athlete.   I plan on picking up Judo again soon alongside rock climbing and any other sports I can find in my area (no football, two left feet)."

Love a bit of free weights though, especially since I stopped smoking.   My cardio stamina had gone though the roof since I started vaping too, that's for sure.   High protein diet for me, 1.5g of protein per KG bodyweight. Light on the carbs. Have a couple of KG to lose though after having 3 months off due to a course of beta blockers they put me on for anxiety. Damn beta blockers caused more anxiety than they cured. Glad to see the back of that shit really.   Onwards and upwards ;)"
ecr_eu,399ymd,20Charactersisntenou,1 point,Wed Jun 10 11:01:23 2015 UTC,I've never heard of using beta blockers for anxiety.   You must have had a very high BP for them to go down that route.    I hope it helped anyways   Mui Thai is bloody excellent aswel. My old kickboxing gym used to have guest trainers come over; one time a Mui Thai gym came along and showed us some really cool stuff.    Most of it completely illegal in kickboxing but it will certainly land you style points in an actual fight.
ecr_eu,399ymd,FarkMcBark,2,Wed Jun 10 12:21:23 2015 UTC,"No problems with my BP at all, Propranolol is used a lot for anxiety as it calms you right down and stops the adrenaline serge you get with anxiety attacks.   Trouble is though you lose a ton of strength in the gym as your resting heart rate becomes around 50bpm so lifting weights just becomes an absolute chore. I really didn't like being on it at all.   I now have a lid on my anxiety though, it's much better.   I can imagine they showed you the spinning back fist etc. lethal technique that in the right hands."

Every hour you eat a portion of the food they send you (shakes, soups, cereal, crackers, cookies). It's rich in fiber so you hardly get hungry, it's varied enough and it's varied enough to not get annoyed. You don't need to count calories or cook anything it's very easy to prepare. It's a bit expensive but you don't have to buy any food. An hourly cycle keeps your blood sugar and insulin levels on a level so that you burn fat but don't start to get weak and go into ""energy conservation mode""."

Now I just need to combine the knowledge with food flavouring and 3D printing to make a food replicator :)  The amapur stuff has more variety compare to just shakes though.

It's really dark and potent and a coil killer though, so I guess not an ADV, but such a treat every now and then.  Discovery and PBB Cream are also really good. Discovery is pretty unique. PBB Cream smells just like the bottle of 5 Pawns Grandmaster I have (never vaped it because it's 6mg/mL) and I'm guessing it must be pretty close in flavor, but more reasonably priced.  The ones I just can't vape: Bucks, Lime Margerita (even though both sound right up my alley, bottles are still full...) and Trails, even though I think I'm gonna give this one another chance sometime.  These 3 and Strawberry Custard are all from their clouds range (90VG), which is not looking great thus far..."

ecr_eu,39a8n0,Sgt_Stinger,2,Wed Jun 10 11:42:08 2015 UTC,A really nice budget alternative is to go to your closest machine shop and ask if they have some 18-20 mm drillbit or endmill containers left over. These are generally thrown away anyway.  Perfect for storing individual batteries.

ecr_eu,39a8gs,Sind3rs,2,Wed Jun 10 13:56:35 2015 UTC,"Straighten them out. You don't want them curling round so they touch the inner part. If it's set up properly, the centre part of the coil should heat up from the centre and heat outwards in both directions. You can't really mess up in the wicking stage if it's set up correctly initially. Spend some time making sure it's heating properly. Make sure your screws in the post are tight and when you are firing the dry coil, if the resistance stays the same, give or take a few 10ths of an ohm. Once this is done, put your wick in so that when you pull the material through, you don't feel much pull."
ecr_eu,39a8gs,BOZGBOZG,1 point,Wed Jun 10 14:03:50 2015 UTC,Is there a very well detailed video to help me out?  Every time i have heated the coils up it heats from the centre out evenly.

ecr_eu,397rac,not_mr_Lebowski,1 point,Tue Jun 9 23:30:31 2015 UTC,"Is there any reason why you are running such a low ohm build at that wattage?  Im assuming its a regulated device, as 0.2 ohms on a  mech is going to be around 60-70W.   If this is the case you may get a more enjoyable vape by increasing your resistance a bit, depending on your device limitations, and then upping the voltage to get the same W.    This should give you much more surface area and a better heat flux; ultimately you will get  a much more satisfying vape.  My old istick always had a .5 ohm dual coil or single parallel coil in it;  at 5V you get 50W and its really good. My recommendation is to stick around 4-5V."

Luckily for the conservatives it benefited them that's why not many people had even heard about it to vote on it.

That would allow you to get more PG in your juice allowing for more of a throat hit. A Menthol flavor will provide you with a throat hit especially if you are using more PG!

Currently there is insufficient evidence to introduce a ban on the use of e-cigarettes in enclosed public spaces or workspaces. CANCER RESEARCH UK  At this time, we do not believe that a ban on the use of electronic cigarettes in enclosed spaces can be justified, based on the evidence currently available. BRITISH HEART FOUNDATION WALES  It may even have a negative impact upon current smokers who may otherwise have attempted to quit or harm reduce, potentially damaging rather than enhancing public health. ASH  Banning the use of electronic cigarettes in public places should be an evidence-based decision. We urge Assembly Members and Ministers looking at this proposal to call on experts and academics to present the latest research. E-cigarettes are relatively new and more work is urgently needed to fully understand their long term effects on health. ASH WALES.

Without fail. Give me a break already.  A recent hate/love relationship is with the lemo 2. Every time I clean it, dry it out, recoil and wick it the thing will work -perfectly- for the first 4-5 refills. Not a single leak, not a drop. Great flavour, zero dry hits. I was ready the kneel down before it and start worshipping the first time I used it. Then, after 4-5 refills, it starts leaking out the airflow controller. And it won't stop.

You get the kbox mini, a subtank mini, USB charging lead (I think?). You will need to buy 2x18650 batteries (Samsung 25r or Sony vtc4 are the best option) and optionally a charger (nitecore i2/d2, best option). Just my opinion."

The best kit for you would without a doubt be the subbox mini, and a Samsung 25r 18650 battery. That is all you will need to buy. The battery is removable but can be charged via usb so you dont need a 3 pin battery charger. I bought mine from puremist.co.uk and they will throw in a Samsung 25r for £5. Also shipping is free."

I would avoid anything with a fixed battery. Get a quality mod and replace the battery once a year or 300 cycles.  The only downside is the 50W limit. Though few people go above that even when they can. I personally don't like burning vapour.
ecr_eu,392h3i,Kerplunk_,1 point,Tue Jun 9 19:45:36 2015 UTC,"Just bought a Subbox Mini Kit from myepack and I'm happy with it. It has USB charging but you still need an 18650 battery to put in the device. It works well with just the USB charging but as others have recommended, it would be better to have two batteries (one as a spare in case one runs out) and an external charger.  Only gripe with the kit is that when cleaning the sub tank for the first time before use, some of the black coating (inside and outside) started to chip away and now it has stainless steel showing through already. This could be due to the way I cleaned it or just a fault of the tank, not sure yet."
ecr_eu,392h3i,Sind3rs,2,Mon Jun 8 21:10:17 2015 UTC,did you use an abrasive to clean the tank prior to use?

I was in the first wave of pre orders from there and I only ordered it like a week before I got it, so I don't think they have been swamped with orders.  As for battery charging, yes you can charge it via USB but I would recommend against it apart from if you just need to give it a quick top up or you intend to watch it like a hawk for a couple of hours. It's much better to use a separate charger (like a Nitecore D2 or D4, they're not that expensive) and have a bit more peace of mind that the automatic cut off is going to work properly when the battery is full rather than rely on a brand new box that is basically an unknown so far in terms of battery safety.  https://www.ukecigstore.com/kanger-subox-mini-kit.html"

No point suggesting that for him if it's going to fail after a month or so.   http://myepack.co.uk/itaste-mvp-v3.html  These are pretty sturdy devices.
ecr_eu,391hd2,goldfish_of_chaos,3,Mon Jun 8 16:13:20 2015 UTC,"I couldnt agree with this more,  an mvp20w or mvp3 + a nautilus mini would be superb!"
ecr_eu,391hd2,Sind3rs,1 point,Mon Jun 8 17:16:49 2015 UTC,"I would definitely recommend the Nautilus over the Genitank.  I used solely a Genitank for a couple of months and it's pretty clunky. It leaks, has a loose drip tip (certainly not an isolated issue from what I have read online) and personally for me does not perform as well as the Nautilus (not by far though.) Doesn't feel like a Kanger quality product to me."
ecr_eu,390tkh,JMH71,5,Mon Jun 8 12:37:50 2015 UTC,The bending adapter meant for the iStick20 and 30 actually fits the 50 as well so that's one way to avoid stripping the threads.
ecr_eu,390tkh,Asyx,3,Mon Jun 8 13:43:18 2015 UTC,I hope somebody comes up with something like a magnet 510. That would be amazing!
ecr_eu,390tkh,ganjadan,3,Mon Jun 8 12:56:43 2015 UTC,Or even just a headphone jack style...
ecr_eu,390tkh,ganjadan,2,Mon Jun 8 13:07:29 2015 UTC,"Or just a simple push, twist and click..."
ecr_eu,390tkh,leshpack,4,Mon Jun 8 13:05:32 2015 UTC,Yeah like a lightbulb (non screw light bulbs). Would be so much simpler. Just two pins that slot into two grooves with a spring loaded 510 to provide tension. No one will ever do it because it cant be backwards compatible though :(
ecr_eu,390tkh,ganjadan,2,Mon Jun 8 13:25:17 2015 UTC,Bayonet cap bulbs.
ecr_eu,390tkh,leshpack,2,Mon Jun 8 13:30:30 2015 UTC,"Yep, that's the type!"
ecr_eu,390tkh,ganjadan,1 point,Mon Jun 8 13:33:01 2015 UTC,"So simple, yet so difficult to implement. They would miss out on sales of mods to people who have stripped the threads. But they could always provide an ego/510 style adapter, except bayonet/510."
ecr_eu,390tkh,leshpack,2,Mon Jun 8 13:37:47 2015 UTC,Yeah you could make the bayonet slightly wider so that the 510 adapter can sit IN the bayonet hole such that the atty can still be flush with the mod. Would be nice to see someone doing that.
ecr_eu,390tkh,ganjadan,1 point,Mon Jun 8 13:44:49 2015 UTC,"Yes it would, definitely."
ecr_eu,390tkh,fluffton,1 point,Mon Jun 8 13:53:00 2015 UTC,"I can think of 2 ways off the top of my head.   make the design of new atties to work on the bayonet to be slightly smaller in diameter than the 510 screw threads. This is the worst way because it will mean smaller contact pins. Which for things like squonkers that are already trying to squeeze power and juice through the contact it wouldn't be a good solution. So let's move onto making the bayonet cap bigger than the 510 threads. Now we can have a nice big contact pin for better conductivity, and also meaning you could go bigger in size with holes for squonking. So how to put a normal 510 on this big bayonet hole? Simple make an adapter so a plate with the bayonets that has 510 threads. Done.   The Shado mech uses a bayonet connection in the switch it looks like a reliable alternative to threading. I've been saying it for ages so it's nice to see some steps towards it. :)  Edit: Probably should've read the hole post before making this comment"

ecr_eu,390tkh,hapticsquid,2,Mon Jun 8 15:23:26 2015 UTC,"This is the reason you should try and scoop the black gunk off of your 510 connections! Its basically small fragments of metal that act as sandpaper... a few weeks of that and you will have no 510 left..  I normally just use a slightly damp piece of kitchen roll to remove the gunk, blow dry and put back together.  (Extra plus! Your Ohm meter will work again!)"
ecr_eu,390tkh,ganjadan,2,Mon Jun 8 13:48:11 2015 UTC,"I'd expected this is the way my iStick 50 is most likely to fail rather than in a ball of auto-fire. Sympathy, anyway, it sucks. On the plus side, onwards and upwards to a better mod. Going now to guiltily clean every 510 thread I have, I don't do it often enough. Scary how much black crap comes off them."

I sent it back for replacement two weeks ago and I'm still waiting for the shop to actually replace it.

ecr_eu,38xtvl,cptrobn,4,Sun Jun 7 19:35:32 2015 UTC,"I own a Flash E Vapor (from now on called FeV) version 2, 3 and the VS (very slim = 17mm) versions. Today I only use drippers anymore, just like it more, but when I was using tanks these things were the best! The reason being the style of juiceflow, comming from above through wicks made out of cotton, stainless steel mesh or (back in the day) sillica. It works exceptionally well and it's not hard to get a good juiceflow. Still, the FeV is not a device for beginners, but it has a high end utility use. You can go 2 ohms, 1 ohms, 10 watts, 20 watts and here comes the suprise: It was the very first subohm tank in the German scene. I remember pulling clouds with 50 watts with no dry hits. The airflow ajustment works with screws; you have the airhole in which you can put either no or several different hollowed screws in it to regulate the airflow, pretty neat concept, although you need to carry the screws with you if you want to change the amount of airflow on the spot. That never was an issue for me though, since when I made a build on the FeV I just tried which screw fitted best for flavor and vapor and kept it in there. I even drilled out my FeV 2 for more airflow, making it a super subohm tank. All the airflow screws are of course included. The negative point is that it has not the best flavor. The build deck/coil-chamber is quite big, so it lacks flavor but also allows for some sick coils. You can also order a dripper cap for it which was my very first RDA.  Let's sum up:  Pro's: Well made out of stainless steel, brilliant juice feeding design with almost no dryhits, no matter how many watts you pull (tried till 50w), a lot of space to build on, easy to learn and easy to master how to build, good capacity with 5.5ml, the device gets cleaned before being shipped so no need to wash it before use, tons of options for making the regular device shorter or longer or dripper  Cons: Price! 120 euros for the regular device, each additional upgrade costs from 10 euro upwards, not the best in flavor, not a beginners device  Here are some links for you and since you're from Germany, they are in German (since there aren't that many good English reviews):  Just regular ""what is the FeV V3 and how does it work"": https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V727v1mYVuw  Also a ""how does it work"" review but with a subohm build: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgc7D_emgig  Where to get the FeV: http://www.flash-e-vapor.de/  Also the manufacturer is a great guy and you get a warranty (don't know if it's lifetime) but I once sent him my FeV V2 for cleaning and o-ring change and it was for free.   If you have any questions, feel free to ask"
ecr_eu,38xtvl,Deadmanonfire,2,Sun Jun 7 22:58:20 2015 UTC,"I'm aware that it's relatively unknown outside of Germany, but this thing is amazing. I own a lot of RTAs and this is hands down my favourite. You can build crazy stuff, almost like a dripper, it just has a tank on top of it. If you take the air screw out it's perfectly okay to do direct lung inhales. Many people over here mod it to shreds, drill a second air hole for dual coils, etc.  Also, the Hotcig clone is only like 25€ and has amazing quality.  Currently using it btw: http://i.imgur.com/vOtOnM0.jpg"

If you want to buy in Germany you'll have to invest a little more obviously. This is the cheapest one I could find: http://www.ecig-hardware.de/Coimbra-3-Flash-e-Vapor-V3-Clone  You'll also need a bit of SS mesh for feeding. I recommend this one: http://www.zivipf.com/epages/63862298.sf/de_DE/?ObjectPath=/Shops/63862298/Products/ESS200x100/SubProducts/ESS200x100-400  You'll only need 2 small stripes that basically last forever, but I haven't seen it cheaper anywhere in the same quality."

When I asked for a receipt and change they started giving us filthy looks too. I mean, I don't mind tipping at all, but I hate it when restaurants think they can decide the tip themselves by trying to fob you off with your change. Obviously I left the change anyway to make a point.   Apart from that it was beautiful. Thanks."
ecr_eu,38vrpt,DarkestFayth,7,Sun Jun 7 06:19:07 2015 UTC,Some new juice today. The original boom juice - custard flavour. Vaping in my subtank mini on a cloupor mini. It's pretty strong flavour for a plain custard. Nice but maybe not a long term ADV.  Back story - I had ran out of juice on Sat as i have been in hospital all week about 100 miles from home (Having to take care of my partner). I Google'd some local vape shops and found an epic little place with some really nice juices. They didn't have anything I knew from back home in stock. However they were epic and sorted me out with some bits he thought I would like. Big shout out to SMOK Shop in Norwich UK!

The big thing im impressed with how close they are with what they are supposed to taste of!  starburst tastes like you've smashed a mouthful of them in and works really well, ive only had a little try of that so far so im planning on a real crack at it this week as its a bit warmer and it strikes me as more of a summery vape but will explore that a bit more.  Jager is an abomination! Its exactly like drinking a jagerbomb which both gave me violent flashbacks and a huge appreciation for exactly how spot on it actually is! Its not my cup of tea personally due to reawoken memories but its definitely exactly what it says on the bottle!  The cookie dough is my wildcard right now its damn sweet and has definitely got that cookie dough taste but its kinda missing some body to it. I like it but just a touch of something and a little less sweetness would make it for me but to be honest thats more me being picky  I really have no idea with MT i cant nail it down at all!

ecr_eu,38v0ci,ganjadan,2,Sun Jun 7 13:23:00 2015 UTC,"I think the Atlantis 2 tank will get hotter as the coils will be the new ones, with cotton, and could also be the 0.2 or 0.3 coil that comes with the new tank.  The aspire sub ohm battery can read down to 0.2/0.3 I think, but the voltage does drop, therefore so to will the vape quality.  Might be worth looking at a vv/vw device, like the MVP 3.0 pro or something similar to run a coil that low, and to be able to experience the coils/juice at a different wattage. Finally, for juice I always visit vapeclub.co.uk and hit up Suckerpunch or Madrina ( by Suicide Bunny), any of the Space Jam juices are good too, but that's my personal preference! Good luck!  And enjoy!"

ecr_eu,38tiu9,ultralowlatency,3,Sat Jun 6 18:10:09 2015 UTC,I do suspect this might be the mod i end up with but still going to hang back for the new sig just in case! Nice review good work! Always nice to see the safety side highlighted!   It still seems strange thay p4y cant get their instruction books right!
ecr_eu,38tiu9,Dumbgecko,2,Sat Jun 6 18:17:06 2015 UTC,"The instruction manual, and quite a few other aspects of the device do feel rushed. Unfortuately it seems like early adopters of P4U devices are the beta testers. If you do go for this one then I can safely say you'll enjoy the chip.  However, the new Sig will probably be the better choice. :)  Thanks Gex!"
ecr_eu,38tiu9,Dumbgecko,2,Sat Jun 6 18:21:10 2015 UTC,Its definitely got me intrigued! I think i would have to get my hands on one to play with a little first before i made my mind up on it.
ecr_eu,38tiu9,fonix232,2,Sat Jun 6 18:30:55 2015 UTC,"Probably the safest option. I find myself reaching for the Sigelei 150 over the IPV4 for Kanthal builds, still experimenting between the DNA40 and IPV4 for TC."
ecr_eu,38tiu9,fonix232,1 point,Sat Jun 6 18:32:17 2015 UTC,"The instructions book went into printing when P4U did not have the latest YiHi chip - it was a different model, the one that went into the IPV 3 Li model. That one has the ""touch sensor"" firing mode, plus screen lock, but did not have temp control on the first run (hence the upgrade instructions in the manual).  I suppose they did not want to waste money and printed out manuals, so they shipped with it."
ecr_eu,38tiu9,fonix232,1 point,Sat Jun 6 23:01:42 2015 UTC,No mention of touch sensors in my IPV4 manual.
ecr_eu,38tiu9,MolonColon,2,Sun Jun 7 16:50:59 2015 UTC,"Mine has, and even the online one has. Point two of the second side (the one with the usage instructions and warranty info, not the one with the schematics):  ""2. Fire  Press the power button on the standby mode, the device will be activated. Keep pressing the button ""-"" and power button, the screen will show ""TOUCH OFF"" and the touch sense function is locked; keep pressing the button ""+"" and the power button, the screen will show ""TOUCH ON"" and the touch sense function is unlocked."""

ecr_eu,38tiu9,fonix232,2,Sun Jun 7 00:10:14 2015 UTC,Nice review! You space your coils after installing them?
ecr_eu,38su5f,nerwen26,2,Sat Jun 6 14:54:12 2015 UTC,Digby's do some damn good juices! Very much in the more mature flavour range
ecr_eu,38su5f,Dumbgecko,2,Sat Jun 6 15:07:44 2015 UTC,"Definitely going to get some of this, not bought any Digbys for a while but I really like their juices. I saw Martyn's video, he's a great reviewer but 25 mins talking about one juice was a bit much. He fell head over heels for Ringmaster. ""Hang on let's try this in another device....and in this one...yes it's still amazing let's have some more...."" :)"
ecr_eu,38su5f,hapticsquid,2,Sat Jun 6 16:13:39 2015 UTC,He works for digbys! Get him! ;)  I've been meaning to order some of their newer stuff. I like their juice and love their lab video on YouTube. That clean room is just lovely.
ecr_eu,38su5f,goldfish_of_chaos,2,Sat Jun 6 15:07:55 2015 UTC,"It's true, they're about to send me my millions for this promo post any day now! ;)  I got hooligan, oriental plunder and gunpowder as well, all very nice juices, but none of them hit the spot like ringmaster."

ecr_eu,38su5f,Dumbgecko,2,Sat Jun 6 15:44:28 2015 UTC,I am very hesitant about dessert flavours as I've tried a fair few previously and anything that has even a tendency of custard smells and tastes of feet/used socks to me. :p  Must be like that thing some people have with ginger tasting like soap I figure.
ecr_eu,38su5f,hapticsquid,1 point,Sat Jun 6 16:02:56 2015 UTC,This at day one tasted and felt like being tear gassed but after 4-6 weeks steeping was amazing stuff!
ecr_eu,38su5f,Dumbgecko,2,Sat Jun 6 16:15:25 2015 UTC,"Gah yes apple & bakery can do that. Have to say my bottle of A&C was ready and delicious on arrival though, had quite a lot from Digby's and not had to steep, good to know that's not always the case though."
ecr_eu,38su5f,goldfish_of_chaos,3,Sat Jun 6 16:20:21 2015 UTC,The cinnamon was so strong i can legitimately say it felt like the first few seconds of tear gas exposure i really suspect it was an unsteeped bottle but that said it was amazing stuff after a few weeks!
ecr_eu,38su5f,Dumbgecko,4,Sat Jun 6 16:23:00 2015 UTC,Experience with tear gas. I see you in a different light now sir.
ecr_eu,38su5f,destroy-demonocracy,2,Sat Jun 6 17:01:20 2015 UTC,I had a fair bit of experience with it for mostly legitimate reasons
ecr_eu,38su5f,casinocasino,1 point,Sat Jun 6 17:41:18 2015 UTC,I bought 30ml of Mum's Custard and found it totally unvapable :( each bottle (I bought 3x10ml) smells like some sort of earwax/paint-thinner/chemical.  So disappointed after all I heard about them.
ecr_eu,38su5f,qarpy,2,Sat Jun 6 21:15:57 2015 UTC,Sucks. :( I'd totally offer you a trade if custards didn't all taste and smell of feet to me.
ecr_eu,38st8y,cptrobn,2,Sat Jun 6 14:45:40 2015 UTC,"I didn't realise fixed 510 was still a thing. Spring loaded 510 is about £4, fuck that jazz"
ecr_eu,38st8y,goldfish_of_chaos,1 point,Sat Jun 6 15:09:47 2015 UTC,"I don't understand it either. The mod is well known that it will never break and stuff but hey, if they can't include a spring loaded pin for that price tag I'm out of there.  Do you know a good other mod with TC? I don't care if its a tube or a box but it should have a swappable (is this a real english word?) 18650 bat.   And it should be below 100€/75GBP"
ecr_eu,38st8y,goldfish_of_chaos,1 point,Sat Jun 6 15:18:04 2015 UTC,I'm not the guy to ask that. I make my own stuff for a fraction of the price that the regular market charges. You should make yourself one for £95. It's good as if anything goes wrong with it you can order replacement parts for a few quid
ecr_eu,38st8y,martialartsaudiobook,1 point,Sat Jun 6 15:30:06 2015 UTC,Take a look at a Heatvape Invader Mini or a KX-50D. Both use a Kangxin chip and they work pretty great with TC and without. You shouldn't compare the quality to a Dani though.
ecr_eu,38st8y,martialartsaudiobook,1 point,Sat Jun 6 19:58:44 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the recommendation, is TC really worth it?  I have a iStick 50 which lost a lot of its battery life over the 2 months of heavy usage now. The Sigelei 30W is still doing great, or should I just wait until TC is even more widespread?"
ecr_eu,38st8y,FarkMcBark,1 point,Sat Jun 6 20:24:28 2015 UTC,"Depends on how far along you are with your e-cig experience. I've been vaping for the better part of 3 years and by now I can ""taste"" when a coil is about to go dry. It's kind of gimmicky in that regard.   But we don't really know how important it's going to get in the future, as studies on harm reduction based on coil temperature are still ongoing.  I'd say if you don't really need a new mod right now, you don't have to get one. Mods that can do TC with Kanthal and other materials seem to be in the works."
ecr_eu,38st8y,smallfaces,0,Sat Jun 6 20:41:24 2015 UTC,"Best TC mod for that price imho is a 60W vaporflask clone. Dual 18650 is dope. I think it's from infinite SXK. It also has a ""nickel purity setting"" which lets you set the TCR (temperature coefficient of resistivity).  Not sure where to get it though. It's gone from fasttech.

ecr_eu,38st8y,mister_314,2,Sat Jun 6 16:20:14 2015 UTC,"It's a cheap easy thing that makes so much difference. Look at the istick 20w, shitty 510 and it got so much shit for it. Things like this kill a product."
ecr_eu,38st8y,metans,2,Sat Jun 6 16:31:03 2015 UTC,"thats just so that when they release the next sub-box with a decent 510 people who loved their original sub boxes will jump on them, as they have with the iStick 20 / 30. Or you can cheat and swap the top deck from a 30W onto a 20W, no more annoying over-hang when I put my KF on, all rdas/tanks work make a sound connection, no more constant worry about completely destroying what remained of the original paper mache strength threads!"
