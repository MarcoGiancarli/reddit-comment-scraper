Professors,3dxscn,stalling1,2,Mon Jul 20 12:22:31 2015 UTC,"I'm in Psychology, so we have a lot of people with an assessment skill set. I suspect it's an easier, and better respected, process in my department than many others.  We have a small committee (rotating membership; started about 6 years ago) that leads our assessment efforts. Much of what we assess comes top-down; we have some institutional learning objectives and some others from our accreditation body (Middle States). Others we have adopted ourselves, largely by drawing on relevant professional standards (i.e., American Psychological Association for us).    The committee designs the assessment process, drawing on existing archival or institutional data whenever possible. Results are used internally, but we wouldn't go to as much trouble as we do if the data wasn't required at a higher level in the institution.  As to usefulness, I think we do get some value out of the process. The biggest benefits emerged early on; we recognized some gaps in the curriculum and some unfair/inconsistent practices that we hadn't previously understood. For example, teaching about diversity is one of our learning objectives, and we noticed some big differences in how diversity was incorporated (or not) in certain courses or by certain faculty."

Professors,3dxscn,LKang,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:47:28 2015 UTC,"I have helped with this, but do not know all the details. We have a very extensive outcomes system. At the end of every course we have to give a score for every outcome, every semester. We also are encouraged to add verbiage on changes we will make to improve each outcome score.  There is then a matrix of what scores feed from course outcomes into the program level outcomes. Although the scores feed in automatically, we then have to add verbiage to address program outcomes in our program review. I believe this is done every two years?"

Professors,3dle35,ProfAbroad,2,Fri Jul 17 05:37:30 2015 UTC,i added some context after you replied. I very much appreciate your answer.   edit: What kind of difficulties? Cynical is good.
Professors,3dle35,evenfalsethings,4,Fri Jul 17 05:38:25 2015 UTC,"It's totally normal to say that to a prof. After all, not many outside the profession are going to have much idea about how (or whether!) to encourage you.   When my undergrads tell me they want to be profs, I generally smile and tell them to come by the office to talk about it sometime--same thing I do whenever a student tells me he/she wants to go into a career path that I know something about. One not so surprising thing I've noticed is that the majority of undergrads & early grad students don't really know what they're saying. The iceberg analogy really applies--they only see a small part of what being a prof entails because most of it is outside the classroom.   One thing I recommend grad students do is follow the job market beginning years before they plan to graduate (it's not too early to start scouting in your first year). Find 2-4 good sources of job postings for your discipline and then every week or two take a look at all the posted ads. Get a sense for how many there are, for how many are TT, for how many are in your specialization, for how many are at schools you think you'd want to work at, and how many are in places you'd want to live (for the next 10-30 years). Do that all throughout the year so you get an understanding of the job market. Also find stats on how many PhDs your field graduates each year so you understand the competition you face. Take a look online at CVs for newish assistant profs at some of the schools you think you'd want to work for--that way you get some sense for how tough the competition is. Then ask yourself why you really want to be a prof. If it's for reasons that other jobs can satisfy (probably with better salary), explore those options too.   Someone saying he/she wants to be a prof is making a naive statement in most cases, especially in the present climate. The odds are short, the challenges many, and the competition fierce. In my experience, that knowledge makes a lot of people back away quickly (I see a lot of undergrads especially who think it'll be easy--you just ""go to school a few more years, get a PhD, and then you're set""). But anyone who backs off just at the thought of the challenge probably would not have persevered. It's a fantastic profession (if you're not stuck in the circle of hell that adjuncts endure), but it really requires a certain degree of stubbornness & irrationality--and luck!--to succeed."
Professors,3dle35,socdoc216,1 point,Fri Jul 17 09:38:52 2015 UTC,"Stubbornness and irrationality you say? Alright, man! You're speaking my language.   That was seriously a great response. I will take your advice and keep an eye on the market. Thanks so much."
Professors,3dle35,remnbibi,3,Fri Jul 17 10:01:24 2015 UTC,"The question is certainly a reasonable one.  However, academia has changed dramatically from when I entered it.  For example, it used to be that having a publication out of grad school was considered quite an accomplishment that potential employers saw a quite a positive.  Now one must often have multiple publications/conference presentations to even reach the semi-final pool of applicants that is devised by a search committee.  I recently chaired a search committee in which we received over 200 applications for 2 positions.  Granted, it was a nightmare for the search committee, but imagine all the hopeful (and highly qualified) applicants we had to turn down.  It's important for you to know this before making up your mind about pursuing a Ph.D. because it means even if you are highly qualified, experienced, intelligent, and have a sparkling personality--you might not get a tenure track job.  However, if you do decide to pursue a Ph.D. make certain you have a backup plan to deal with the worse case scenario.  Adjunct teaching for any length of time (unfortunately) too often means you will never be seriously considered for a tenure track position."
Professors,3dle35,neofaust,2,Fri Jul 17 20:17:45 2015 UTC,"That is great inside information. Thanks so much. One thing though. Can you elaborate on this part: Adjunct teaching for any length of time (unfortunately) too often means you will never be seriously considered for a tenure track position.  What does that mean exactly? I'm afraid I don't understand how you become an Adjunct prof to begin with, and why it would hinder you from TT."
Professors,3dle35,ProfAbroad,2,Sat Jul 18 03:49:59 2015 UTC,"I teach Humanities at a college that is mostly about teaching, instead of research or publishing. Full time professors have 6 classes, and tenure professors have 5. All are expected to also serve on committees and do service to the college. You are encouraged to publish, and they fund trips for you to go to conferences or present papers. But, my school focuses more on teaching.  You might want to look at community colleges, or colleges that used to be community colleges but were part of the wave of 2 year colleges converting to 4 year colleges by adding a few bachelors degree programs. If you look at a community college, you can get your foot in the door as an adjunct, but don't expect to make a living as an adjunct. You only need a masters degree to start teaching at a community college. Play your cards right, serve on a few committees, and get your name out there in your school's community. I know many tenure track, tenure, and full time professors who started out as adjuncts. At our college, internal service is mandatory, and valued over external efforts. That being said, if you do publish, or present a paper at a conference, you get brownie points.  I think that having a Masters in Middle Eastern Studies opens up a lot of opportunities for you outside of teaching. Most Humanities programs have just enough sections of Asian or Middle Eastern Humanities to require one--maybe two professors. My advice to you is to make yourself valuable by being able to teach a wide range of Humanities, and be ready to teach Freshmen. Depending upon the state you live in, Humanities courses are still a requirement. Most Humanities professors in 2 year or 4 year colleges are expected to be able to teach the core courses. And then you can specialize.  Be prepared to network, as you would at any other job. Get a job as an adjunct, and get your face out there. Make yourself valuable. I would also suggest that you look at getting certified to teach in middle school or high school. It's much easier to get a job there, especially at a private school. You can teach a wide range of subjects and get teaching experience. You will also make contacts.  That being said, there are a lot of people after these teaching jobs, and few jobs. You will be competing with people who have more experience than you do. You won't just walk out with your diploma and have people beating down your door, unless you publish some master work. Also, if you can prove that you can bring money to the college from grants, that helps you."
Professors,3dle35,ProfAbroad,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:45:41 2015 UTC,"Thanks for that! I knew that I could teach at a CC with a Master's. I was sort of counting on that as back-up actually.   I live in Texas, so I am pretty sure Humanities are still a requirement.   That's a great idea about becoming the specialist at my school, making myself valuable. I think my professor, when I was an undergrad, did that. She taught Islamic Civ at my small, 4 year school because no one else was doing it. We also had a prof come over from UCLA to teach Medieval Studies. I'd be happy to teach freshmen; middle school and high school not so much.   Thanks for your advice. Really great info."

If you are a student then you should discuss the great things the applicant did for you in the capacity as a teacher, mentor, and advisor. If you worked as a research or teaching assistant you could also discuss your experience there. It would not really make sense for you to discuss the person's research or administrative work if you have no personal experience there. Write what you know.  The best letters will have real examples and stories to support your claims. Instead of ""she is a great teacher"" you write about a specific time she took extra office hours to explains concept or used a unique simulation/active learning technique to help you learn the material. Stories and examples will go a long way to help the candidate.   Generally there is no format. Usually the content includes your evaluation plus how long and in what capacity you know the applicant (known her for 2 years taking 4 courses)"
Professors,3d20op,ProfAbroad,2,Mon Jul 13 00:30:48 2015 UTC,"Writing letters is always tough especially when you know so much is on the line. I have only done this once so take this with a grain of salt --   Important thing is that your letter is genuine (so try to avoid cliches and exaggerations).   Before you start writing, make a list of things that are important to you in a mentor, important to the institution, and important to the community.  Also, try to complete sentences like these in order to find things to write about: - She impacted my education/development by ___ - She impacted my peers & colleagues by ____  - She adds value to the university community and culture by __   Highlight the 'items' from your list that were exemplified by this faculty mentor.  This will essentially provide the outline of your letter. Tell a story and give examples of how this professor succeeded in those 'items'.   If there are things you can quantify, definitely include those.   The committee will know that you're providing a student's perspective, so use the letter to celebrate the this faculty mentor's strengths within the student's scope.   Length wise, I'd say at least 5 paragraphs. Opening paragraph, closing paragraph, and 3 paragraphs highlighting a strength (or a set of strengths) per paragraph.   Be sure to print it and sign it by hand (in case you need to send an electronic copy)."

Professors,3d23s7,Rejected101,2,Sun Jul 12 22:18:56 2015 UTC,"Honestly, faculty and deans have basically zero involvement or influence on the transfer or application process at most universities, so you're not going to get much help here.

If don't mind replying, I was also wondering whether or not going to the dean would make any difference as the dean is the dean. Same question I guess for the director of the program. Would they need to be consulted-- would the admission committee consult them about that kind of decision. Especially if the quota of students has already been reached?"
Professors,3d23s7,galileosmiddlefinger,3,Wed Jul 15 02:41:49 2015 UTC,"I thought that professors sometimes sat in on the committee to help make decisions.

I was also wondering whether or not going to the dean would make any difference as the dean is the dean.    No, they aren't involved either, they will not interfere on your behalf, and they will probably resent being bothered.

This isn't a case that you can escalate until you get a satisfactory resolution - these people don't owe you anything, and if you aren't a strong applicant, you aren't getting in regardless of how many people you speak with.

I have seen so many life plans shattered with last minute inconsideration that I would advise you to not necessarily lose hope yet.  Your GPA sounds fine.

Note, there is a glut of PhDs in the market right now so having a PhD is no guarantee of landing a tenure-track job. Unfortunately, most doctoral students think they will ""beat the odds"".

I soul strongly advise against it unless you can GUARANTEE that you will have little to no student loans upon graduation. So basically you need to secure a full ride scholarship. Also don't forget that being a professor is more about publishing research articles and books rather than teaching, at least from your employer's POV, so make sure you enjoy writing and revising articles.

Professors,3cwomz,galileosmiddlefinger,2,Sat Jul 11 14:56:48 2015 UTC,"People are interpreting your question in different ways. The answer to the more straightforward question is yes, if you want to teach in any field, you absolutely need a PhD.   The more contentious question is whether or not it makes sense to pursue a career in academia at all. There are a lot of bitter people in this sub who haven't been able to find tenure-track work. That is a huge risk, even in ""in-demand"" areas like accounting; academia is only viable if you can find a permanent, stable position with reasonable salary and benefits. You must be very good at what you do, and that's not just teaching - you have to be a strong scholar who publishes a lot, you have to be willing to work long hours serving the institution and your profession, and you have to be willing to go wherever the job is, which is inevitably not going to be where you want to live. Weakness in one of those areas and/or being unable/unwilling to leave your current location will doom you in academia.   Think hard about whether or not you're OK with those terms before you move forward with a PhD. If you do, be sure that you get some internship experience and practical skills in graduate school as an escape route if academia doesn't pan out."
Professors,3cwomz,FGF10,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:55:30 2015 UTC,"Absolutely.  If you want to be a full-time professor, you almost certainly need a terminal degree.  There are very few exceptions to that rule.  For most subjects, the PhD (or some analogue such as the Ed.D or DBA) serves as the terminal degree. If you are going to teach a subject to people, I strongly believe that you need a comprehensive understanding of that subject.  A doctorate will almost certainly ensure that you have the understanding, context, and knowledge of a subject to transmit accurate information to the next generation of learners.  For most accrediting bodies 18 hours of graduate coursework is sufficient to teach a subject; but I really think a doctorate helps."

I believe that too many individuals go into academia with something to prove and have a desire to feel they are superior to others--thus they seek to have their ego fed by lording their advanced education over everyone.  I was the most naive grad student as I believed intelligence and the capacity to think critically was a prerequisite for obtaining a Ph.D.--but having met so many professors who have little intellectual capacity, well, let's just say I now know I was wrong.  Having to deal with university  administrators is 10 times worse--outsized egos based on a lot of nothing.  I realize now that I was wrong to place academia and academics on twin pedestals, and that perhaps had I had more realistic expectations I might not now be considering leaving academia, but the truth is working in high ed sucks as much as any other job in which the egos of one's colleagues seem to take precedence over being genuine and decent human beings."
Professors,3csxce,savdec449,8,Fri Jul 10 14:47:20 2015 UTC,"Are adjunct positions intended to be full course loads? Are there 'full time' adjunct positions intended to be long term? Are there Chairs out there hiring adjuncts to exploit them, or are they offering the best they can to try and help these folks?   When I was having difficulty finding a position, the chair of the program from which I graduated offered to give me 4 courses as an adjunct. But it was to bridge the gap.   Every time I read one of these stories about adjuncts, there seems to be a commonality of unwillingness to move (the linked story included). Getting a TT academic position requires geographic flexibility. It just seems like a football coach complaining about the lack of jobs when they're not looking outside of their town. You won't get a job with the Patriots if you won't leave Orlando. I understand that there are compelling reasons not to pull up roots, but let's own that decision and its consequences.   Am I wrong? (Honest question)"
Professors,3csxce,clinical_psyence,7,Sat Jul 11 00:08:51 2015 UTC,"I agree. I was given the option to teach as an adjunct where I got my Phd in he event I didn't land a job. When I applied for jobs I looked everywhere in the world where I could physically live. Meaning any English speaking country.  I did get a TT job outside the U.S. with much better pay than in the U.S. at a pretty comfortable location.  My friends who graduated with me all wanted to stay in the general area of the U.S.  ALL of them, I do mean ALL of them got adjunct positions. Not one of my cohorts got a TT job. Eventually many found TT jobs but it took a number of years during which they were all adjuncts."
Professors,3csxce,ProfAbroad,5,Sat Jul 11 02:59:21 2015 UTC,"If adjuncts pay and conditions are greatly improved there are going to be far fewer of them. No way around that.   I generally agree with you that we need to sort of de-Walmartify the academic labor market. Having 3-4 part time employees to do the work of 1 full time employee is good for administration and bad for academic workers. Even if TT lines don't increase in the near future, a department replacing 4-10 part time faculty (who often have no/low medical & retirement benefits, poor institutional support, and no near-time job security) with 1-3 full time, non-TT faculty (who have medical & retirement, appropriate institutional resources, and reasonable expectation of near-time job security) is a major improvement for the workforce in general. Yes, there will be a lot of competition for those jobs (probably more competition than the typical adjunct position since the # of jobs is reduced), but the jobs would actually be worth competing for. Some people will be squeezed out of academia, but those who remain will generally have a job they can live on. The trouble is that solution generally has worse financials for administrations than the current adjunct market that can cover the same number of course sections with lower salary and ~no outlay for benefits."
Professors,3csxce,evenfalsethings,3,Fri Jul 10 16:40:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah, to hell with people that work as hard as you do and get paid half. That's a fair approach. This sort of blatant disregard and contempt for part time faculty is why so many of them remain part time. People brand them over time and they remain stuck in perpetual limbo in the field they want to work in.  And the idea that there are plenty of jobs to go round otherwise is such a sham. Step off your soapbox for a minute and try and remember that, despite how they affect your department, they're still people with aspirations. And they have every right to be frustrated that they can't find jobs doing what they love.  That said, I don't really disagree with you. They're not forced to work this way. But the idea of having a PhD and slinging coffee because nepotism and individuals with ""exotic"" educations and credits are keeping you from a job is pretty terrifying, pretty oppressive.   TL;DR: The system is overloaded and unfair. It's not anyone's place to say who should have to suck it up. It's reasonable to give those who are working themselves to death with unfair compensation some recognition and sympathy."
Professors,3csxce,dbosse311,2,Fri Jul 10 21:08:33 2015 UTC,"Yeah, to hell with people that work as hard as you do and get paid half.    I think adjuncts have to be careful about language like this when trying to appeal to FT faculty. We have one job component in common - teaching. (Many of you do a shit-ton of that one part, but it's still just the one part.) You aren't expected to do all of the other things that FT faculty have to do, like publish scholarship, secure grants, work with formal advisees, engage in professional service for the institution and profession, or build/maintain connections in the community or industry to facilitate consulting or student placements. I think adjuncts should be paid better for teaching, but you have to be careful about drawing a false equivalence about what we do when you argue for better conditions. This isn't a case of equal pay for equal work, and those arguments can actually turn FT faculty against you."
Professors,3csxce,galileosmiddlefinger,1 point,Fri Jul 10 22:29:10 2015 UTC,"You make some fair points. And I agree that drawing false parallels is wrong. But many adjuncts who hope for any chance of obtaining full time work are still expected to participate in most of those activities without any compensation. And if they don't, they're overlooked for those who will work themselves to exhaustion for free.  You're also assuming that many institutions require these functions of full time faculty. However, at my place of work we have sub-administrative faculty in positions focused solely on community outreach, grant writing, advisement, and other ancillary tasks that a great number of full timers at other schools are asked to do. That means the majority of our full time faculty only do ""one"" job. (Another fallacy, considering many who teach end up advising, sitting on committees, and publishing research, regardless of institutional requirements.)  I don't understand, in any capacity, what it is that turns full time faculty against others who hope to be considered peers and colleagues. I wish it were as simple as conversational oversight, but I highly doubt it is so simple. It seems an inexplicable inflation of ego is often involved, in my (very) limited experience."
Professors,3csxce,dbosse311,2,Wed Jul 15 02:17:15 2015 UTC,"A lot of these dynamics are discipline and institution-specific, which is why people always come to these conversations about adjunct faculty with very different experiences and perspectives. I've taught at four colleges and universities, three as adjunct and currently as a tenured full professor.   As a FT person, I see a lot of adjuncts who are held back by either (a) an inability or unwillingness to publish at a level required to be competitive for tenure-track jobs and/or (b) an inability or unwillingness to relocate to wherever job openings may emerge. FT faculty tend to have little sympathy for those issues; we all survived the ""publish or perish"" guillotine to get tenure, and most of us uprooted our lives to relocate away from friends and family for a tenure-track shot.   Those experiences do harden you. I think that's a large part of why many FT faculty view adjuncts with a sentiment like, ""you deserve better, but you aren't an equal."" I don't think that's inflated ego the way you describe it, but rather a sense of unfairness...it's a reaction to the fact adjuncts want ""equality"" without making the same sacrifices that we made. (The bigger question is why we have to make those sacrifices in the first place, but that's a whole other rant.)  I don't mean any of this to disparage what you do, or to downplay the importance of teaching at all. I'm just trying to write out the thought process as best I can to shed some light on how I've seen people react."

Professors,3cqj1b,neofaust,2,Thu Jul 9 23:38:45 2015 UTC,"So what was the increase in the NUMBER of workers getting earning more than before?   I don't understand the question, can you rephrase? And I don't think it's apples to oranges. The cost of education vs the amount the average worker earns is a directly relevant comparison. What else would you look at?"
Professors,3cqj1b,paithanq,1 point,Fri Jul 10 01:31:05 2015 UTC,"Well, I think the point here (in the article) is that a larger and larger percentage of Americans can't afford to send their kids to college, and, simultaneously, a growing number of colleges are cranking up their tuition prices (the profit of which is going to the administration). Do we agree on that, i.e., that this is the main issue being discussed in the article?   To the number of workers who's pay has increased, I think we all know the answer to that one. The top 10% of income earners have had a marked increase since the 80s, the lower 90% have had little to none. I'm still unclear as to the relevance of that factor to the larger issue, at least insofar as you're describing it"

All this means is that a very large number of colleges were charging just under $50K and now their charging just over $50K.   Think of the following scenario. Tuitions were increasing at a rate of .005% per year for the last 50 years, and 3 years ago 2 schools cost over $50,000, and 48 schools cost $49,900. This would generate the exact same statistic, and the message would be that school tuition is increasing much, much slower than wages.  I know that tuition growth is outpacing wages, and that I know that journalists frame statistics in a way to sound dramatic, but this is just insulting."

All of these schools have substantial needs based scholarships. Plus, there are excellent state universities, but there is always a subtle snobbery about state schools.  This article started implying that the only way to increase your SES was to attend one of these mega expensive schools.  Instead these articles should be focusing on telling people how to find good deals on higher education,  but demonizing the rich is easier.   What we as a country should be more concerned about is the dwindling state support for publics.  They should remain a good an affordable option for college."

Professors,3cn8ui,cashton713,8,Thu Jul 9 05:40:47 2015 UTC,"It's part of the job. Do not take it personally or let it eat at you. Do what you can, if anything, to pre-empt plagiarism through assignment design, next time around.  In the meantime I recommend working with your school's office that handles these things. At my school, I fill out a form describing the plagiarism, attach the evidence, and present it to the student, who signs it. It then goes a central place. If the student has done this before or does it a lot, we now know, because there is a file. Consequences can be adjusted to fit whether this is the first or third time the student has been caught.  It might be tricky to prove that students 1 & 2 both plagiarized the same source. There are cases where students swipe each other's work.  If turnitin or Googling key phrases fails to uncover the source, try Googling the prompt or key parts of it."
Professors,3cn8ui,RegionalPublic,3,Thu Jul 9 12:13:41 2015 UTC,"OP, this is fantastic advice. If your institution has an office of student/academic integrity, go to them ASAP--in fact, you may technically be obligated to do so no matter what, since as a third party the office is working to resolve the situation to help the student as well as you (just in case a situation turns out not to be plagiarism).  The advice about assignment design is also great; if it's possible one or both of these students found some external document that already addresses your prompt, how might you revise or entirely overhaul that assignment in the future to avoid this sort of potential issue?  Finally, I'll add: no matter what, don't take it personally. Yeah, it sucks, and it feels like your relationship with these students is altered. But for these students, your class is just one of many they're taking, and there are innumerable variables in their lives that may drive them to try and take unethical shortcuts with their classes. You don't have to put up with it, and shouldn't!, but you also shouldn't feel like it has anything to do with you specifically."

Professors,3cn8ui,RegionalPublic,4,Thu Jul 9 13:42:32 2015 UTC,"I'm am probably softer on this than I should be, but if this is the first draft on an early assignment, I would council the students first before filing academic dishonesty paperwork.  I would use this as a teachable moment.  You may even want to take some extra time out of your next class to talk about plagiarism again.  If they did this on the final draft paper, especially after receiving feedback, I would think differently."
Professors,3cn8ui,blindingspeed80,3,Thu Jul 9 14:47:51 2015 UTC,"This is the approach I'm taking. I figure that for many students, this is their first college class (it's very developmental comp.), so I want to give them an opportunity to fix their mistakes. If it shows up in final drafts, there will definitely be consequences."
Professors,3cn8ui,jeff0,2,Thu Jul 9 22:21:40 2015 UTC,"This is sane. Talk to your comp director, who should be an old pro at your school's procedures, and then share this information when you speak with the plagiarizers.

Professors,3cn8ui,Peity,6,Thu Jul 9 23:08:51 2015 UTC,"I see it about 2-3 times every semester. Typically, I'll invite the student for a meeting and play dumb, asking them to explain some critical portion of their submission, then when they are unable to explain that, I broaden my questions to less sophisticated portions of their bullshit solution, and so on until they begin their own theatrics, at which point I'll present my evidence to them (a vast majority of the time, putting some brief, interesting, and representative portion of the submission into Google gets me all I need; look for 4-5 word phrases that appear to be more sophisticated than the average level of the submission) and describe the sanction. So far, I've had rote copying from publisher's solution sets (even though the problems had been modified so that the solution set is wrong), copying from online repositories (github and such), cobbling together wild argumentative quilts from various forums, and more recently friends and relatives completing the students' work for them. The meeting is really critical, because it lets me be lenient to those who show a full grasp of the submitted work, and merciless to those who have no clue.   Once, after I've presented my evidence, a student sat silent, still, and unresponsive for about 15 minutes... staring at me... that's as close to a ""good story"" as I can get."

The most important thing I do is to make my expectations and teh consequences clear in every class I teach.  I remind them and give them a quiz on what constitutes plagiarism.  So, everyone has the opportunity at least, to ask questions about it, and make sure they understand it.  After that, I have no mercy.  If I find it, they fail, period.  I run every single essay through software that helps me find plagiarism, though most of the time, I just find it while grading.

Professors,3ayoz6,neofaust,13,Wed Jun 24 15:51:52 2015 UTC,"15 credit hours a year? Most of the full time faculty at my school teach 9-15 per semester. Many teaching schools do 15 or more per semester. This, and faculty are expected to publish, sit on committees, and do a million other things that adjuncts don't have to do. I absolutely think adjuncts should be paid more and have more professionalization, but you get no sympathy from me over 15 credits over a whole year."
Professors,3ayoz6,doyouneedacookie,3,Thu Jun 25 02:00:48 2015 UTC,"Yep, that is instantly where this guy lost me.  Most professional adjuncts I know teach anywhere from 36 to 54 credit hours a year (usually 2 classes max at any one school and up to 3 schools in a semester).  I know one that only teaches 18 hr/yr, but she has another .5 FTE job with the university (I guess much like the guy in the article doing other part-time jobs).  Adjuncting was never meant to be a full time job.  It was meant to let people that have jobs but certain expertise come in and teach a class.  This allowed me to have a psychiatrist come in an teach my psychopharmacology class and give tons of practical examples.  This allowed a neurosurgeon come in to teach a functional anatomy class (I am a neuroscience PhD).  In another program I worked with, it allowed the head of the state's department of health to teach a class on healthcare policy.  This is adjuncting done right.  Not what this guy is doing."
Professors,3ayoz6,manova,2,Thu Jun 25 13:09:52 2015 UTC,My thoughts too. When I graduated from grad school I had the option of staying on at my institution to be an adjunct. I noped right out of there and started applying for all sorts of full time teaching jobs. I got one at a different university as a nontenure track prof (I have an MA). If I hadn't gotten that job I would be teaching ESL in the public schools.

Professors,3ayoz6,manova,18,Thu Jun 25 00:10:04 2015 UTC,"I'm sick of all these fucking whiners. If you don't like making peanuts, then find another job. The same is true for any line of work. If you don't like making minimum wage at Mcdonalds or Walmart, go to trade school and get a better job. If you don't like roofing, get your papers and become a plumber. Why do these so called academics feel such a sense of entitlement that society owes them just because they have graduate degrees.   This woman, like many adjuncts, has a master's degree. If she doesn't like making shit wages as an adjunct, she should join a law firm. No one is forcing these people to get low status degrees and then work forever as  temp instructors. Nor does she deserve to be paid like a full professor because (a) she never got a PhD and (b) does a fraction of the work a real professor does.

Professors,3ayoz6,mrs_sugarlips,2,Thu Jun 25 13:23:40 2015 UTC,"No, if I want to be a freelance artist but cannot get any clients, I do not deserve a living wage, I need to find a new job.  If he cannot find enough work as a part time contract worker, he needs to find a new job, which he showed he was capable of.  He has a job in retail (and he had another part time job with the USPS), but he thinks the retail job is beneath him because he thinks he is a college professor (I love how he basically said he is keeping it real by working with the people).  He is also not working full time at his college job.  15 semester hours, so basically, 2 classes in the fall and spring and 1 in the summer.  That is, at best, a .4 FTE of a college instructor.   So if I work at Kohl's 16 hours a week, I deserve a living wage?  And that is being generous.  As someone that has taught college for 15 years, 2 classes are really more like 10 hrs (.25 FTE) of work a week (3 hrs lecture X 2 + 2 hrs office hours (which nobody visits so you use that time to grade/prep) + another 2 hrs for grading/prep).   This is a guy with a law degree that is choosing to live in poverty."
Professors,3ayoz6,mrs_sugarlips,3,Thu Jun 25 13:36:19 2015 UTC,"Not sure why you're getting downvoted here. To be honest, I'm kind of shocked by the overall ""pick yourselves up by the bootstraps"" bourgie-ish talk in this thread; this is one of the last subs I would expect to see it in."
Professors,3ayoz6,Tatta_Tatta,2,Thu Jun 25 14:53:50 2015 UTC,"Thanks. To be honest, the right-leaning tendency of this entire sub has made me want to trash this subreddit on multiple occasions.

Professors,3ayoz6,VetMichael,0,Wed Jul 1 14:45:39 2015 UTC,"It pays very well as a part-time job, which is exactly what it is. At my school, the adjucts for chemistry make $3,500 per course (7 hours of contact/week). They aren't required to do research, go to meetings, or even hold office hours. If they want, they can get worksheets and exams to use from professors. Add on about 3 hours of week grading and 15 weeks a semester, that comes to $23/hour. I can't think of any other part time job except maybe private music instruction or tutoring that pays anywhere near that much.   That doesn't mean some bad universities don't exploit these people, but if that's the case there is nothing stopping people from leaving to go work at a school that treats them better. They have nothing to gain or lose by staying. They have no tenure, no benefits, and no strings attached like the full-time people do."

Like all jobs, some places are better than others. My university treats adjuncts well and doesn't exploit them. That's been my experience.

Professors,3arxno,hftdrive55,4,Tue Jun 23 03:29:42 2015 UTC,I think it's become more common for calculus professor to ban calculators because so many of them have symbolic manipulation functionality now that they can easily differentiate and integrate with little understanding of the actual processes.

Professors,3arxno,FGF10,-4,Tue Jun 23 17:52:44 2015 UTC,"To me, not being able to use a calculator on a test is like typing a paper on a typewriter instead of a computer or Microsoft Word. Microsoft word has spell checks and can fix grammatical errors. My concern was cross multiplying or solving 255, or doing factorials. I am already slow on tests, I don't need more things to slow me down further. If you don't want to use calculators anymore then might as well use a trig table like our ancestors hundreds of years ago."

Considering that you are working a 30 hour a week job, you are not able to give it total dedication. Also, the human brain needs time to assimilate new information (via sleep in particular), so you need to be working more than 3 times as hard as you would for a normal course. You say you don't want to learn in the hardest way possible, but you essentially chose a very hard way."
Professors,3arxno,FGF10,14,Tue Jun 23 03:24:40 2015 UTC,"First of all yikes at your subtle(-ish?) racism.    Second, calculus is HARD!  Calc. I and II are considered the most difficult 100-level courses offered on most campuses.  You chose to condense a four (sometimes five) hour course into a summer term.  Not only that, but calculus is a fundamental component of chemical engineering.  If you can't do the ""hardest questions"" in calc. I, then calc. II is going to wreck your life (esp. if it's sequences and series like it is at many schools).  Those hardest questions are also going to be a big part of rate laws and thermo. in your chemistry education.

Your mistake was taking calc in the summer. Calc is such that you shouldn't really need a calculator. We weren't allowed to use ours, and I didn't miss it, especially because we were expected to keep irrational numbers in fraction/root/etc form. If you're studying Chemical Engineering you better put your big boy pants on and get ready for a whole lot more classes that are just as hard and harder than this one."

They are cautious enough to listen very closely to instruction, and are so eager that they don't mind doing work that other trainees might find tedious.

There are lots of ways to learn advanced stats once you have the basics down. HLM and SEM are big in my field. Survival anaysis can also be quite useful. Also, meta analysis can be fruitful.  If your school doesn't offer the courses you want, and you don't feel like you can get the jist of what you need via books or online videos, you can always take short classes through e.g., Statistical Horizons, CARMA, or Stats Camp. I've taken a handful of courses this way and usually find them helpful.  But, the more basic thing to reflect on is what are you trying to study and understand. From there, think about the statistical tools that might help answer the  question (and perhaps consult with others if you're unsure). You can certainly publish in reputed journals using some pretty basic statistics, like OLS or logistic regression."

It's at least not part of the narrative in the cover letter (which is what I was really concerned about).   I'm teleconferencing with my chair tomorrow so I'll mention it then.   Thanks for the advice."
Professors,39dilv,Namemedickles,1 point,Thu Jun 11 12:39:58 2015 UTC,"Most everyone else would disagree with me here. But, I don't think she should. If your wife is the best candidate she should win. She should not (and if I were her I would not even want this) receive special treatment simply because her husband is being hired in another department. I believe this to be an unethical way of highlighting your application and obtaining a job. Now, people might fire back with ""there are inside candidates all the time"" and I get that. I understand that it happens, I just think it's unethical and trying to acquire the job that way is not something I condone. If I were your wife, I would not want to feel like I just got the job because someone pulled some strings for my husband the professor. If I were your wife, I would find it to be insulting and would rather get the job because I deserved it."
Professors,39dilv,sighing_sage,13,Thu Jun 11 04:32:11 2015 UTC,"Part of being ""the best candidate"" might be that she and her husband would both be happy members of the university community and therefore more likely to stick around and contribute. Spousal hires can be good for employer and employees alike. I agree with the other comment that OP should mention it to the chair."
Professors,39dilv,NighthawkFoo,1 point,Thu Jun 11 04:39:47 2015 UTC,"Especially if they are in completely separate schools within the university.  If they don't have any professional interaction, then it's perfectly fine."
Professors,39dilv,Namemedickles,0,Sun Jun 21 11:50:40 2015 UTC,"Haha, like I said most will disagree with me on this issue. You can look at your argument both ways though. They could look at it as, if the husband fails, she might leave with him. Or, they might look at it a different way altogether. Perhaps they are concerned that if they get a divorce, she might not want to stay working at the same university her ex husband is a professor at. And since he's the one on the tenure track I doubt he would be the one to leave. There are lots of ways to look at this situation, not just the one you described.   So being a member of a happy university community is not a default best candidate and therefore that perspective does not discount my ethical concerns."
Professors,39dilv,sighing_sage,2,Thu Jun 11 04:48:15 2015 UTC,True. It's just happened to be my experience to see the opposite. One university I used to work at was vehemently against spousal hires and we ended up losing a very good person (and the chance to hire his very talented wife) because of this policy.
Professors,39dilv,Namemedickles,1 point,Thu Jun 11 05:01:09 2015 UTC,"One university I used to work at was vehemently against spousal hires    Wow, I don't even go that far. I think it's unethical to pull strings but damn if it just happens that the spouse was a good candidate then that's great. How does that policy even work? I mean, it probably wouldn't be that hard to figure out but I don't think an applicant is obligated to mention that their spouse recently acquired a position. Was this a departmental policy that didn't want to hire two married professors or was it university wide? University wide seems weirdly impractical."

I'm thinking it's more of a scare tactic. In my department, we constantly have people pregnant and having babies (at RATHER inconvenient times) and we deal with it. I managed to have my kids during the summer because I didn't want to deal with starting or stopping in the middle of the semester -- and I'm lucky I was able to do that. I am an extreme workaholic and got a lot of stuff under review right before the births, and I prepped for anything I would need after the births well in advance.

The whole article is all over the place, but her argument seems to be that we should distinguish sexual misconduct from ""the fumblings of fallible human beings"" based on whether or not it harms the community. I thought she was building to the point that she shouldn't penalize the student because, although her attire was disruptive, it didn't meet the standard of harming those around her. However, that whole thread got dropped by the last few paragraphs and there isn't a clear statement of what she ultimately decided, or how that decision fits with her reasoning."

This form of instruction turns a course—something once understood to be a mix of scripted and improvised performance under the control of a professor—into an ownable piece of intellectual property that can be administratively inspected and altered.   I don't know if I have properly appreciated this aspect.  We have a review of online courses which was initially prompted by older faculty that assumed that online courses were of poor quality.  Of course this has caused all typed of problems.  But to the point, this past year, a friend of mine had an online lecture that told the story of McDonald's hiring a popular pop star in Egypt when it moved into the market.  Evidently they did not know about his song ""I hate Israel"".  The lecture was a cautionary tail for international business.  However, the power point that said ""I hate Israel"" got flagged and she had to explain this multiple times to multiple people."

You aren't doing students any favors by giving them glowing recommendations for positions where they are likely to fail. Although less important, this also reflects poorly on you and your institution - these employers may be less likely to trust your recommendation or your students in the future.  If I have reservations about recommending someone, I always just lay them out for the student and let them decide how to proceed. Here's a redacted/edited email blurb I've used:  I can certainly be a reference for you. I have a lot of good things to say about you based on your performance in (courses), but I want to be clear that I have to give my honest appraisal about your developmental needs too, if I'm asked. For you, those needs concern your (observed deficiency). If a recruiter asked about your (deficiency), I would have to say (whatever you would honestly say). I think you have the potential to grow in this area (and I'll definitely say that too!) but I have to give an honest appraisal of where you stand today. Are you comfortable with all of that? If so, I'm happy to be a reference for you."
Professors,37xwx8,galileosmiddlefinger,1 point,Sun May 31 13:22:25 2015 UTC,That was a great way to handle the situation.  I have struggled with this issue as well and really like the way you handle it.
Professors,37xwx8,volcanogirl33,3,Sun May 31 14:47:12 2015 UTC,"You risk violating federal law and the student's FERPA rights by openly discussing a student's known (documented) disability with anyone other than the student or authorized persons granted permission by the student (e.g., student disability services staff). This information (a documented disability) is considered part of a student's confidential educational record. I'd agree that it would be a good idea to discuss your concerns with the student and ask for permission to discuss his or her disability if you feel it is of great importance. Otherwise, be honest that you don't feel comfortable providing the recommendation. I would urge you to contact your school's office of disability services to clarify federal law and any rules or guidelines mandated by the school regarding student privacy."
Professors,37xwx8,philrj,2,Sun May 31 21:20:33 2015 UTC,I'm not in the USA so the laws are different. But I am curious about this. So if I talk about some issue in a recommendation that the student might have that makes it difficult for them to perform their job that would violate U.S. federal law?  What if the difficulty was not made known to me in any official channel or documentation but only by my observation? Would that still be a violation of the law?
Professors,37xwx8,galileosmiddlefinger,1 point,Sun May 31 21:49:12 2015 UTC,"/u/philrj is correct that you can't disclose a student's disability, but you can absolutely disclose your own behavioral observations. For example, I can't say that a student suffers from an anxiety disorder, but I can say that presentations are challenging for her and that she needs development in that area. Her disability status is privileged information, but your own global judgments of her strengths and weaknesses are not.   As a related example, if I'm hiring people to unload trucks and an applicant comes in wearing a back brace, I can't directly inquire about his medical history or disability status in the US. That would violate the Americans with Disabilities Act. However, I can legally ask a question like, ""This job requires you to lift and carry 30kg boxes for several hours per day. Is there any reason that you could not perform this duty?"" That question can be posed and answered without requiring anyone to divulge their disability. Likewise, a recruiter can legally ask me about a student's organizational skills, and I can answer in a way that is truthful without stating that I know she struggles with ADHD. Basically, it's all fine as long as both parties keep the medical diagnosis out of the conversation."

They know they risks they are incurring by taking a chance (at least with me). I've never had a student who literally didn't understand that copying and pasting someone else's work was cheating. Also, their cry for help should come BEFORE attempting the assignment. I really think college should raise the bar, not lower it to accommodate people who shouldn't be there in the first place.

I spend time in my first year classes having students discuss what constitutes cheating in order to find out what their understanding is outside of a situation in which they are caught. In that classroom discussion, they clearly understand what cheating is, and that saying ""oh, I got my buddy to do the essay because I was in a time crunch and I had no idea he was a plagiarist"" is not an excuse. Time after time, AFTER they are caught, I still hear these excuses. Then I say ""but in class when we talked about cheating, you said..."" Yes, there's a gap between their professed understanding in these situations, but the reason for it is not that they don't know. It's that they are trying to get out of the punishment."

You will then be required to read and respond to that classmate's initial discussion post for the previous day"" I'm not sure how I could have been any more explicit.  I'm speculating that the rest of the class followed this one student's flawed understanding because she was the first person to write a response to another student's post (based on time stamps) and the next person to do the same thing replied about half an hour after she did with the rest of the class following suit over the next five hours. I believe that the second person who posted a reply saw that she'd done so, thought that maybe instructions had changed or just hadn't paid attention to my instructions either and thought that he needed to reply before the deadline (for the original post, not the reply which they have until the end of the week to complete) to get credit and then this created a sort of domino effect of everyone seeing their peers replying and thinking that they needed to do the same."

It was worth it, but I was still willing to go back to K-12 if I couldn't land a full-time position at the college level. My motivation was to advance my career by working full-time, and finally making all my schooling worth it financially (at least to me). I also am now qualified to teach ESL, something I wasn't qualified to do before.  I personally would do the full-time teaching gig and get my Master's on the side.

Also, the job market for EN Lit is quite bleak and will be given to those with PhDs because there are several unemployed.   Now, if you are going for MA in Rhetoric/Composition, I would encourage that decision. The job marketing is thriving, and I know of several schools, typically junior colleges or bottom tier community 4-yr colleges, that will hire full-time lecturers and provide them with benefits. If you specialize in ESL, that will increase your marketability.   Now, adjunct world is HELL. The lowest I've been paid is $1200 per class for Fall semester and without any benefits. I would ultimately recommend a PhD in R/C for any long-term college teaching career. Of course, teaching at the college level is quite different from secondary. Even at some bottom tier institutions, you will be required to publish 2, perhaps, articles a year. One thing to keep in mind is something  a colleague informed me: 60-30-10. 60% teaching, 30% research, and 10% personal life."

That's a dream job for a lot of people with graduate degrees in English at this point.  If what you really want is a teaching focussed academic career, your best bet is community college, and the students there are just like your regular high school students 2 years later. The pay for school teaching is at least as good."
Professors,375d1f,Unicormfarts,0,Mon May 25 07:32:23 2015 UTC,"Thank you to everyone who read this and posted their insights.  I've decided to go for the MA in Composition and since the GA money comes out of a state-funded grant, I jumped at the chance. I will graduate with a TESOL certificate in addition to the composition MA.  I am thinking that ultimately, I would like to teach ESL classes or run an international student/ESL center. While I love literature, I realized how much the English learners I taught really shaped my passion for teaching, and those are the students I ultimately want to serve. I think my desire to teach college aged students comes from this experience I had when I was an undergrad and met a master's student from China studying opera through a conversation partners program set up by the university. I think it was so powerful because I realized that she was just as homesick as I was on my first trip abroad, and she also had to write papers and give presentations in a language she was still learning. I suppose I want to give these students as much of an opportunity to succeed because the odds are already stacked against them."
Professors,370g6i,jeff0,10,Sat May 23 18:35:27 2015 UTC,"I teach at a community college. With an open matriculation policy, I have a wide range of students. Here's what I've found:  Test anxiety is sky-high. I don't know what their k-12 teachers did to them, but they are terrified and defensive when it comes to taking tests.  This also relates to cheating. Most of my blue-collar students don't cheat. But, if they get desperate, they will.  Start learning their names and give them some respect on the first day. That will go a long way towards solving any ""pissing contest"" problems. For example, I teach a lot of pre-law enforcement students. If I can show some interest and ask questions about their area of expertise--what do you learn in ""skills class""? or even hunting or sports questions--they are much more likely to respect my area of expertise.  Don't expect a high-vocabulary level or a lot of background knowledge but don't shy away from it either. This is especially true with international students. Just get used to giving two or three synonyms when using jargon.  And, finally, don't over-generalize. I have many students who come from higher socio-economic class than myself. And, if you equate $ to economic class--you're going to find out that bounty hunters and private detectives out-earn most professors.  tl:dr- once they trust you to not treat them poorly, they can relax and focus on learning."
Professors,370g6i,MrsTiggyWiggy,4,Sat May 23 19:48:41 2015 UTC,"Test anxiety is definitely a problem for my students, but I'm not certain what to do about it.  Cheating has been too, particularly because some of the vocational programs are very high-stakes (students can be kicked out for failing a single class). I had a bit more success dealing with cheating this past semester than I did in the fall, simply because I was more vigilant early on in the semester, and more clear about what constituted cheating.  Engaging my students more on a personal level has been a goal for me, but it's something I struggle with. You've given me some food for thought in that regard.   don't over-generalize   I probably should have said low-income or blue-collar. I expect many of my students will be soon out-earning me with a two-year vocational degree... and many of them were out-earning me previous to college.  Thanks for your insights!"
Professors,370g6i,MrsTiggyWiggy,3,Sat May 23 20:34:46 2015 UTC,"I just mention the over-generalization because it's something I did. I assumed my students came from similar backgrounds to my own--underclass, first-generation, etc...   But I have a lot of students who come from money, who have educated parents, and make/or will make more than I do. So, I had to learn not to make assumptions."
Professors,370g6i,Namemedickles,2,Sat May 23 21:02:21 2015 UTC,"What sort of changes should I consider making with the goal of more effectively educating a less privileged demographic?   Well, I would supply them with the best study skills and advice I could based on their performance in the early stages of the course. I would not however, dial down the rigor. If they are not prepared for college level work, then that will (and should) be reflected in their grades. It is unfair to the students who are prepared to let low quality work slide by with a higher letter grade. We are not in the business of shelling out unqualified people into the workforce."
Professors,370g6i,bitchwithacapital_C,1 point,Wed Jun 3 00:42:50 2015 UTC,"Just that you're thinking about it already makes a difference. When students say something in class about their life experience you're less likely to react with bewilderment which is great! I would also add that you should make explicit why doing well in school IN GENERAL translates to marketable skills. I tell my students that when a future employer sees a high GPA on their transcript they interpret that to mean the student can focus, has the ability to learn new things, can perform under pressure, etc. Many low income students don't see the point in learning about things seemingly unrelated to their future careers so you need to make it super explicit."

Ok, maybe not ""yell.""   Back it off just a little bit from ""yell.""  The students should feel shock and awe. The guilty ones (plus those harboring similar attitudes) will hear it, and the innocents will be unscathed.  The dean should repeat the performance every year for the incoming students.   It takes an authority figure to handle this, not a single prof's voice.  The dean can't solve every little problem, but this isn't a little problem.

I was trying to cheer up my favorite professor one day (he's a dear friend now) when he told me that his students didn't know how to think (political science theory class). I said, ""they don't even know how to take notes. Thinking is WAY out of their league.  But you could teach them!"" he looked at me, completely horrified, and it didn't cheer him up at all.   Students have no idea what's important or how things fit together and they don't want to waste one second on something that isn't going to be on the test. Even if it is going to be on the test, if they think it doesn't somehow translate into a job, they won't care about it for longer than it takes to barf it out on an essay.

Professors,36nskh,Powdurrrr,6,Wed May 20 19:00:45 2015 UTC,"I can't really comment about going the teacher route, but here are some thoughts about becoming a professor.   The job market is overcrowded.  There are hundreds of applicants for each opening, meaning that statistically, you should be applying to hundreds of jobs in order to get an offer.  Beginning a PhD with the goal of getting a job at a specific institution is simply not feasible - so many things would have to go right in order for this to work out.  McMaster is also a well-ranked institution, so expect the number and quality of applicants to be even higher. I went through this process a couple of years ago and had interviews in places as far-spread as Massachusetts, Texas, Utah, Kansas, and Alaska. Most professor positions are focused on research, while teaching is seen as an afterthought.  This is changing to an extent - there are more and more small colleges that are offering engineering programs (this is where I am at), and large universities are slowly adding teaching faculty positions (sometimes called lecturer positions).  But the vast majority of a professor's energy at large universities (where most engineering professor jobs are) is directed towards research, including writing grants to secure funding, supervising grad students and postdocs, and publishing results in peer-reviewed journals.  Professor vs. teacher is really an apples-to-oranges comparison. Professors at most schools are not on contract over the summer.  This does not mean that you get the summers off, at least not if you want to keep your job.  For research-focused positions, the level of productivity that is expected is simply too high to take a quarter of each year off.  For teaching-focused positions, this is your chance to get other stuff done - research, course development, grant-writing, etc., because during the school year you simply won't have time with all of the energy that gets poured into class preparation, advising, grading, and everything else for 6-8 classes per year. All things considered, I'd much rather be a professor than a teacher.  I don't have much tolerance for students who aren't serious about their learning, and in college I'm not expected to put up with immature teenage behavior.  I have much more freedom to teach what I want to teach, when I want to teach it.  I can to some extent set my own schedule.  The pay is much better, and the workload is comparable."

When I train psychotherapists, a rule of thumb is that if your client cries, you're probably doing your job.

Professors,36nn1p,CgStv,-5,Wed May 20 20:35:25 2015 UTC,"First of all, thanks for taking the time to edit your post to add some additional sarcasm and incivility to your earlier points. It definitely helps to make your case.   Secondly, you are a professor? And you leave ""in the middle of class, every class"", to use the bathroom? Have your students ever complained about this disruption to the class?"
Professors,36nn1p,Uneje,6,Thu May 21 14:17:28 2015 UTC,"You're welcome.   As for the questions: I no longer run lectures; not every course, but have every class; no, we take a 5 minute break when appropriate.  Happy pooping!  Edit: And here I am again editing to add incivility! Simply because someone disagrees with you doesn't make them uncivil. For example, I never once called you a cantankerous old asshole. That would, certainly, be uncivil!"
Professors,36nn1p,Xen_a,4,Thu May 21 15:45:44 2015 UTC,"In addition to what everybody else mentioned already, students might have your class back to back across campus and not really have time to use the bathroom before class without risking being late."
Professors,36nn1p,CarolinaSwtness,3,Thu May 21 12:04:59 2015 UTC,"I've noticed that this especially seems to bother relatively new teachers and those who are taking themselves a bit too seriously (these groups are often one and the same - and that's ok, we've all been there). Still, we all get annoyed at stuff like this from time to time. When we are in the middle of explaining the best example of the most fascinating thing EVER, we can't fathom how someone could tear themselves away from our genius. And that's when we need the reality check. Our students are people. Adult people. With lives. They have other stuff going on outside of ancient philosophies or mathematical equations or whatever. Those are the things WE choose to focus on in our own lives. They're just trying to get a degree and your class is just one tiny bit of that puzzle. In many schools, your students are not only worrying about classes, but have the added stresses of families and jobs. They're paying us for a service. I always figure it's just my job to provide it, not to police their every move and measure their dedication through time spent in-chair. Let the people pee."
Professors,36nn1p,Jobediah,3,Sun May 24 08:30:13 2015 UTC,"Honestly, this happens quite a bit in my classes after lunch. I'm okay with it. My rule is you can't get up and leave while a student or group is giving a formal presentation; however, you may come and go as needed as we transition between speakers or when I'm presenting. I do get annoyed on exam days, but can't figure out how to say ""you can't go to the restroom"" when my students are adults. I understand your frustration, truly. Protect yourself by NOT asking if accommodations are needed. Students must volunteer that information. It's a legal issue.  And kudos to you for asking for advice and avoiding the knee jerk reaction."
Professors,36nn1p,Quant_Liz_Lemon,-5,Thu May 21 04:04:48 2015 UTC,"You could either make an announcement at the beginning of class asking everyone to please not come and go during class (unless it's an emergency) because it is distracting to students and you. Or you could email individual students and ask if there is a medical reason they are behaving the way they are. Informing them that of course you will accommodate their needs, but also informing them that you are concerned about distractions."
Professors,36nn1p,Jobediah,13,Wed May 20 20:25:02 2015 UTC,"Or you could email individual students and ask if there is a medical reason they are behaving the way they are.   Woah! That's a terrible idea, and is likely to get OP in trouble with the administration."
Professors,36nn1p,Quant_Liz_Lemon,-6,Thu May 21 02:06:16 2015 UTC,Not sure why you consider this crossing a line. As professors we are constantly accomodating students with all manner of health and mental issues. It's our job to understand their needs and help them get help if they need it.
Professors,36nn1p,Jobediah,11,Thu May 21 02:28:52 2015 UTC,"True, but I think that emailing students to ask if they have a medical condition is problematic. You're pressuring them to reveal a diagnosis that they didn't offer to reveal. If a student has a means of coping with said issue by leaving class, then the specifics aren't needed."
Professors,36nn1p,Quant_Liz_Lemon,0,Thu May 21 03:25:51 2015 UTC,"Agreed, specifics aren't needed. But if someone repeatedly disrupted my class, I would absolutely ask them if they have a reason. If the answer is yes, then the next question is whether they have documentation and why haven't I been informed? If the answer is no, then you ask them to change their behavior. Students need to inform professors in advance of these kinds of things so we can accommodate it properly. If the student has a problem that is disrupting class they need to be advised at the very least to see disability services so the proper professionals can help them and that office will help the student navigate and make sure the student informs the instructor of what kinds of situations to expect and they typically come with paperwork in hand that informs us of the accommodations. Again no details are shared with the instructor unless the student wishes to share them. But the students need documentation and the instructor needs to be informed. This is standard and appropriate professional conduct to help and protect students and class learning environments. It's not willy nilly prying into student's personal lives."
Professors,36nn1p,CgStv,3,Thu May 21 04:07:29 2015 UTC,"True. I think my concern is that within the context of OP's complaint, this would be extreme as I really doubt that bathroom breaks are as disruptive as OP feels that they are."
Professors,36nn1p,Jobediah,9,Thu May 21 13:12:40 2015 UTC,For the same reason you cannot simply email students asking if they suffer from mental/physical disability (barring some evidence of self harm or posing a danger to others).  Very inappropriate.
Professors,36nn1p,BusterTheChihuahua,-3,Thu May 21 03:27:08 2015 UTC,I think you are applying the wrong moral barometer here. This is not accosting a disabled stranger on the subway demanding to know what their disability is and humiliating them publicly. This is privately asking if there is a reason (not what exactly it is) they are acting inappropriately in your class that can be explained by a condition that they should have documentation for and should have notified you about and helping them manage their condition appropriately for a classroom learning environment (or) mentoring someone who does not have a condition but is acting inappropriately to get their shit together.
Professors,36nn1p,mwbysw,-2,Thu May 21 12:44:46 2015 UTC,I find it very weird as well. It's a fairly recent phenomenon: the last three to four years I've notice the exact same thing. And it's twenty minutes into an eighty-minute class....and they're gone for ten minutes. WTH?! I'm an old lady with a post-menopausal bladder. If I can hold it; you can hold it.
Professors,36kpxf,coldgator,8,Wed May 20 02:29:33 2015 UTC,"I try to glean something constructive to work on (be more organized, more grade feedback throughout the semester, etc.) for the next semester. Whatever I find, I'll make a list of two or three small goals for the next semester.  Most of the time though, I don't find anything specific to change from students' complaints. Most of the time student complaints are from students who got a bad grade because they didn't meet the expectations of the course and they're trying to blame it on someone else. If I can't find a legitimate complaint, then I disregard it.  It's tough sometimes, because some complaints can be pretty personal...I don't have any advice for that other than try and have some thick skin. If your department chair isn't worried then you shouldn't be either."
Professors,36kpxf,justamathnerd,6,Wed May 20 02:41:49 2015 UTC,"I wish I could figure that out, too. I can have 50 good reviews and that one bad one hangs on for weeks following me around. I'm also a chair, though, and I always tell my faculty that one bad review doesn't mean much. There's always going to be one with a chip on his/her shoulder, it's unavoidable. See if there's anything worth learning from it; if not, consider that this person might have his/her own issues and it may have nothing to do with you.  And if you figure out a good technique, share with the rest of us."
Professors,36kpxf,doyouneedacookie,2,Wed May 20 02:59:56 2015 UTC,"I once read that good faculty read all the good comments, but get hung up on the one bad comment. On the other hand, the bad ones skim the copious bad comments and latch onto the one or two good comments to rationalize their bad teaching."
Professors,36kpxf,BusterTheChihuahua,6,Sat May 23 02:20:08 2015 UTC,"Other comments have done well to address your professional response, but rude comments reach into your personal space.  This may sound silly- take a mental shower. Hear me out because this works incredibly well for my own experience. You know you're a good teacher because you do x, y, and z. I bet you do everything you can to help your students learn and succeed.   Student comments or any offhand complaint can stick to you and follow you around; as you said you can't shake the comment. Just imagine you're in the shower scrubbing all that negative energy off of you and feel that shining teacher come out again. Use the mental shower to restore your mental image of yourself as someone who does a good job. Wash all their frustration down the drain and remember why you teach. I think our mental tools are part of what makes us capable of doing the job and this is just another one. Feel better and remember ""everyone's a critic."""

Professors,36kpxf,SolidRambo,3,Thu May 21 02:28:15 2015 UTC,"There's an Aziz Ansari standup special I watched recently where he says something along the lines of ""some people are just douchebags. I'm sure there are a handful of you who, if we were in ANY other situation than you paying me lots of money to talk to you for an hour, I would want nothing to do with you.""  I apply that some sentiment to class. No matter how good of an instructor you are, how organized you are, etc., there is probably always going to be at least ONE student who doesn't like you. Consider the comment, but don't let it bring you down too much. I know if doesn't feel good to receive an anonymous comment that denigrates either you as a person or your ability to instruct, but if it's one or two people complaining, versus everybody else giving you good reviews, who cares? It's far more realistic that it's on them, not you."
Professors,36kpxf,ProfAbroad,1 point,Wed May 20 16:50:00 2015 UTC,I was going to say something similar though I was favoring a different word. No matter what you do some people will not like you. Some people will just want to push your buttons. Some people are just assholes. That extends to some of the students as well. I wouldn't think about it much and just know that some people are just jerks.
Professors,36kpxf,VetMichael,3,Wed May 20 21:34:01 2015 UTC,"I get those every so often and it used to bother me terribly; was I showing favoritism? Was I disorganized? Was I rude to people? In the end, you will always get one student (or sometimes two) who, for whatever reason, will slash and burn their way through your review and there's nothing you can do about those kinds of people. It is nearly impossible to anticipate what will set someone off and what will keep them happy, especially when those reviews are in their hands.  I've taken a more holistic approach to the entire 'review' process by excluding one really bad and one really good and looking for the message from the in-between. If they are overwhelmingly positive, I'm heading in the right direction. If not, I obviously need to adjust my pedagogy.  I have other reasons for believing that student reviews as part of your yearly review are objectionable at least (and useless at worst), especially if you are teaching a difficult subject or one that students in general don't have an interest in or are able to grasp easily. I'm glad to say, however, that the comments will - in general - recede from your mind over time and you will (through repeated irritation) develop a thicker skin in this student-as-customer environment."
Professors,36kpxf,DearSci3nce,2,Wed May 20 14:16:49 2015 UTC,"I used to get really upset with those rude, unhelpful comments, and they still sting a bit. But now when I read those comments, I tend to feel immense pity.  A student who writes those kind of comments is probably both socially inept and entitled - a dangerous combination. At some point, his or her attitude is going to be directed at someone in a position of power without the protection of anonymity, and it will bite him/her on the ass. I tend to think there kinds of students are probably constantly on the verge of ruining their lives by directing their snark outward. So essentially I tend to think, ""This is step one in your path to failure and misery. I hope you correct your path before it ruins you.""  I also tend to think students who are writing rude comments like that are also pretty unhappy people. Can you imagine living in a world where your university professors are ""so inept that [they are] ruining the university's reputation"" and is ""clearly not good at [their] job[s] and it's unclear why the department is continuing to let [them] teach when [they're] so bad at it.""  Real comments, and I am very good at my job. So if those students are looking through poop-colored glasses, I can't imagine how generally unpleasant life is for them. That's sad."
Professors,36kpxf,invisible760,1 point,Sun May 24 15:11:03 2015 UTC,"Tenure?  In all seriousness, you need to remember it's a numbers game.  Not every student belongs in that class,  wanted to take the class, and/or has the ability to grasp your message."
Professors,36k4lp,proflem,7,Tue May 19 23:48:15 2015 UTC,"Wait, someone got offended because you said someone else was good at their job? I don't get it. If the dean got mad at you for saying there were ""compensation challenges"" to a candidate, I'd understand that, but talking up a colleague? That doesn't seem like a reason to go around badmouthing you. McHubrisDick sounds like a nut."
Professors,36k4lp,coldgator,4,Wed May 20 02:17:13 2015 UTC,"Sorry I wasn't clear - we were interviewing a candidate for Dean, not another faculty position. The dean candidate asked about unique challenges they might face. I shared my $.02.   yeah. McHurbrisDick sucks."
Professors,36k4lp,ProfAbroad,4,Wed May 20 02:37:05 2015 UTC,"Well I can actually understand how your colleagues must feel. If this person actually becomes the new dean than you have already started to provide some frame to the dean about them.  Personally I would have chosen to talk about other challenges and not tried to single out anyone. Not until after the dean got the job and asked your opinion on a specific person.  A dean is going to face a number of challenges and not all come from faculty incompetence. In my experience, the biggest challenges come from other administrators.   Clearly your colleagues have been a bit childish and cannot express themselves in a way that avoided playground language. That's unfortunate as well.  If you want to get along with your colleagues it's best not to talk about them to other people, especially the dean. Generally in small departments things get back to people."
Professors,36k4lp,Ltlflwr,2,Wed May 20 13:49:19 2015 UTC,I can't speak to how normal this is but it has happened to me as well. We brought in a candidate from Europe. Myself and another colleagues took the candidate out to dinner after the interview. This is standard procedures for interviews. Anyways it is a Friday night and we are at a fancy restaurant and at the end we were offered free cordials on the house. I think nothing of it; we are all adults. I returned the next week and I get called in by my chair and she starts questioning me as to why I was doing shots with the candidate. So yep...the he said she said bullshit happens where I work.

Professors,3626vt,kairoschris,0,Sat May 16 16:35:19 2015 UTC,My only point is that there are different types of profs and since it sounds as though you are relatively new I would suggest that those who don't feel the need to set up boundaries on what is a pretty simple task will probably find the field more rewarding.  The moment you turn your job into menial tasks and focus on the number of minutes it takes to send emails is the moment you turn it into a job and a paycheck (where the rewards are extrinsic and not intrinsic).
Professors,362h0x,adjunctforhire,3,Fri May 15 15:18:43 2015 UTC,"When a department gets a new TT line, it's usually expected to ""bring in fresh new blood"".

If you can rally other faculty to your cause, before you go talk with him, so that he hears about it, you may grease a few gears for him to support you.  If they all think you're REALLY going to leave, that may change the environment.  I've known some really shitty chairs and some really good ones who will fight for good faculty.

Honest-to-god, a rigid syllabus with crystal clear due dates is the secret to success. And, apparently, not every online professor has mastered this.   After that, you can play with any technology you want (or not). I regularly change what I'm doing.

My adviser lived several hours from his wife while in grad school (they were married at the time) and even lived months away from his wife and newborn while conducting research abroad. Right now I have a professor who is spending the summer in Alaska with her husband and son after teaching all year at a southern university.

Professors,35kk5w,annerevenant,14,Mon May 11 06:30:20 2015 UTC,"This is pretty normal for me as a prof, and I don't give an inch (unless I legitimately screwed something up.)  I suspect that if you have 3 or 4 students coming to you to get a bump and you give it to one or two of them, you're opening the door for more students to come complaining.  I'd rather be completely by the book than bending the rules here and there.   Also, if you look at it from the student's perspective, I'm surprised that more don't come asking for grade bumps.  The student has nothing to lose by asking, so it might be a pain for us, but it's extremely low risk (and low effort) for a potentially high reward for them - I also suspect it works at least some of the time."
Professors,35kk5w,attractivetb,1 point,Mon May 11 06:53:02 2015 UTC,"I definitely had a student ask me why I didn't include an essay they emailed into their final grade (although I ask them to submit things on blackboard, and not by email.) When they forwarded it to me and I was able to locate it in another folder I put in a grade change, since it was my fault. I have yet to bump anyone's grade that asked unless I've done something wrong which is why I'm so baffled by the high number this semester. I never considered the low risk/high reward side to the argument or that it actually works.

On the other hand, if your institution has a culture of begging for higher grades working, then it probably won't stop it.   You just need to learn to be comfortable saying no. Here's a phrase you need to learn: ""In fairness to all students..."""

Professors,35kk5w,Unicormfarts,2,Mon May 11 20:15:40 2015 UTC,I definitely use that all the time. So much so that one of my students left an evaluation that I was unhelpful and if you asked a question all I would do was tell you to look in the syllabus.

Professors,35kk5w,Unicormfarts,2,Mon May 11 22:29:41 2015 UTC,"I know my department doesn't allow students to beg for higher grades, we also don't put up with plagiarism, and have more than once kicked students out of our program for doing so. I'm wondering if other gen eds at the university are letting students get away with it. One of these students scored low As/High Bs on all assignments but missed a pop quiz (we only meet once a week, they never explained why they missed) and two online assignments (of which there were only 11, the 3 lowest were dropped so they only had to complete 7 for the semester.) When I look at it that way, I can't justify a 4 point curve because they had the potential to be a good student, especially when other students did their work. I definitely emailed him last night explaining that I couldn't justify giving him a bump and not others. I'll be sure to put that phrase into my rotation."
Professors,35kk5w,NighthawkFoo,1 point,Mon May 11 22:28:35 2015 UTC,"If students are used to being given a bump for asking, that can definitely be an issue, although sometimes ""my other professor"" is an imaginary phantom.  The math issue might be that if a missed score is a 0, the student might think it is an F with some points assigned to it. There's an online grade calculator one of my students used once that assumes an F is like 45% or something. She calculated her grade using this when she had 3 missed assignments that were zeros, and assumed she would get a C- overall instead of a D, or similar."
Professors,35kk5w,simoncolumbus,1 point,Mon May 11 23:29:52 2015 UTC,"I just figured a general lack of understanding how percentages work was at fault, I never realized they might assume they'd get partial credit. Now that I think about it, I remember a friend who was a BSE student tell me the schools she shadowed and interned at were not allowed to give zeros. Even for missed assignments, they had to give them a 45%. Students might be used to this precedent and are blindsided when they get zeros."

Professors,35kk5w,SolidRambo,2,Mon May 11 07:06:45 2015 UTC,I definitely thing other departments that teach gen eds are more lax on students. Which is unfortunate because they get to our department and then complain that we're unfair. I'm sorry that I didn't give you a D instead of failing you for plagiarism but you realize I could have you expelled from the university right?

Just this term I had a student with a 75% average ask me for a B after final grades were submitted because he 'didn't feel a C represented his effort level in the course'. A lot of students seem to have a big disconnect between 'amount of effort put forth' and 'demonstrated success in achieving learning objectives' or 'doing what the syllabus tells you needs to happen to succeed in a course'. Just because a student spends a lot of time studying for an exam or writing a paper doesn't mean they deserve a good grade. If they're spacing out on assignments or skipping class and missing quizzes, I'm generally not sympathetic at all-- that's a problem entirely of their own making."
Professors,35kk5w,VetMichael,1 point,Mon May 11 15:04:43 2015 UTC,"This is what I'm dealing with. The problem is that my most recent student (that prompted this midnight post) makes mid-to-low As and high Bs on all assignments but failed to complete some, which resulted in the loss of a letter grade for the course. Part of me wants to be sympathetic because they're a ""good"" student but the other part thinks that if they wanted an A they should have come to all classes (which were only once a week) and complete online assignments (in total, they only had to do 7 for the entire semester.) When I think about it that way, I can't justify just giving them an A for scoring well on the work they did do. Thank you for taking the time to write back.

In fact, I have a colleague who has already gotten 3 of them this semester, so it's not surprising. When I was a TA I definitely received more of these requests, and I guess it's probably because I was younger and they saw me as somebody they could relate to more, or as somebody who they thought they could push around due to being new.  Don't give an inch. Just say something along the lines of ""Sorry about the outcome, but the grading policy is clearly outlined in the syllabus. If I were to bump your grade up, it would be unfair to the students who received the higher grade according to the policy, as well as to the other students who received the same grade as you but did not receive a grade boost.""  That essentially is empathizing with them, but not giving into their bullshit. They generally understand at that point and drop it. If they continue to e-mail you after that just ignore it because they've already received a more than adequate answer. Or if they're crazy and show up at your office to bother you, just keep repeating what you said in the e-mail (this has happened to me before, it was really awkward because it lasted like 5 minutes of me saying the same thing and then he stood in my office door silent for nearly an entire minute before walking off without a word)."

Professors,35bjru,Gee10,3,Fri May 8 19:05:48 2015 UTC,"I use Evernote extensively. I love it because it ""plays nice"" with so many other technologies. I have a pretty involved organization system and I won't bore you with the details (plus, I really need to get to bed). But, to be very quick, the major ways that I use it are:    As a quick way to get research ideas down. I have a Evernote notebook set aside for research ideas. If I'm at my PC, I'll jot the idea into Evernote via their Desktop app. More often, however, I'm out and about when inspiration strikes (or, more often than not, silly ideas that go nowhere). Since it takes a few extra seconds to open the native Evernote iPhone or iPad app and get to the appropriate folder, I instead use an app called ""Note."" The app integrates with Evernote and is programed to save all notes to my Research Idea notebook. The benefit of this app over the native Evernote app is that clicking it immediately opens a blank note. I jot the idea, click save, and it goes to the appropriate folder. I'm somewhat of a goldfish when it comes to attention span, so it's important that I can jot ideas really quickly. As a way to aggregate relevant journal articles and teaching materials. I have notebooks set aside for interesting or relevant articles and teaching materials. Sometimes, I manually copy and paste relevant things to notes in these folders. However, I use a IFTTT, Feedly and Google Chrome plug-ins to automate this process as much as possible. Without going into the details, I have it set up so that I click a button and have relevant web  materials sent to particular folders. I've used this system for a while and have built a massive library of relevant things. I revisit it often. As a footnote, I link article notes to research idea notes if there is a relevant connection.  I don't use it to write the actual manuscripts that I prepare for journal submission but I use it heavily to organize the progression of my ideas, data cleaning and organization, and analysis code. Thus, Evernote is the backbone for all of my research projects, even though I write the actual manuscripts in Word (or Google Sheets). To organize my research projects, I have a ""Stack"" (i.e., collection of notebooks) for Active research projects and another Stack for Inactive research projects. The Stacks are filled with notebooks pertaining to particular projects (Inactive refers to projects that were published, rejected or, for whatever reason, just never really worked out).  The notebooks contain a progression of diagrams and brainstorming materials. They also contain diaries on data cleaning and organization (if I return to a data project, I can never remember where I left things) and analysis code. I have various rules that help to keep thing tidy and organized but I don't want to kill you with details.

There are two people in the world, those who love, love, love Evernote and those who have not gotten over the hump of adoption.  Push forward.  There are so many ways to channel information into Evernote so it becomes an ancillary short term memory and so you can think about something new rather than doing the old school repeating the information over and over in your head so you remember it."

There was a thread about 3 weeks ago about some professor who thought about dating a PhD student but ultimately decided against it. I mentioned in that topic that I believe it's unethical and more likely than not will just wind up fucking you over due to the inherent asymmetrical power dynamic of the relationship.   What I did not post, but somebody else did, is that it is artificial to act as though we do not find anybody we come in contact with at the University attractive. There are going to be a bunch of people in the classroom every semester, you're probably going to find at least one of them attractive; you see them for 3 hours every week. If you weren't a professor and were just some random person who went to a fairly crowded place, say a grocery store, you'd still probably encounter at least one person you found attractive. I don't think anybody, regardless of their profession, should feel guilty or wrong for finding somebody aesthetically pleasing. I, and probably most others, don't simply flip a professor/whatever your job is switch and immediately become asexual.   What might be a bit off, in my opinion, is the obsession/crushes part. At the end of the day, you're in charge with giving them knowledge and again, there is that power dynamic. I think you just have to remind yourself of the responsibility and power dynamic actively because you don't want feelings to impact grading, which can be achieved through blind grading and whatnot. Similarly, even though I'm younger, their budding intellect and development is definitely lagging in comparison to somebody I would want to date or hook-up with if I were single (also, big part of this as well is that I really love my wife and have no desire to ruin something great). If you're single, maybe try dating? If you're with somebody and having sex, you're probably not going to be thinking as much about crushing on students."
Professors,34uefk,amightypirate,16,Fri May 8 18:13:39 2015 UTC,"gentle reminder that upvote and downvote buttons are not ""agree and disagree"" buttons  There's a whole load of needless shaming here and TBH it's depressing to see a group of intelligent people engage in discourse so unprofessionally. So, I'm happy to fall on a sword if there is one to fall on.  The OP clearly stated that there is no intention to act so the comments about ""leave the children alone"" are incredibly ignorant (not to mention basically illiterate). I would also question your professional conduct if you truly think of your students as children.  I think OP voiced an opinion we can agree on, none of us wants a relationship with an undergrad under our tutelage (though, undergrads are adults and I think any two adults can enter in any relationship they want as long as the ethical issues we are discussing are not barring a relationship). But, being biologically male, I can understand the call of nature that seems to be largely ignored in this comment thread. I can understand why those urges put you in a difficult position when it's your students, and I admire you for voicing it given the flack you are getting from people I don't believe to be in a position to properly comment on the experience. Testosterone is a hell of a chemical.  I don't see anything wrong with what you're doing at the moment. I agree with /u/invisiblecows' comment that it would probably be best to try to compartmentalise your students to a professional relationship mentally, but I don't agree with the rest of their comments, and I'm not certain this person has experienced male attraction from the way they are talking. I think the obsessive crushing you are discussing is not something you can simply switch off and the comment that you do not, therefore, respect your students is fallacious, given that you qualify your comment with ""there is no question in my mind about acting on any attraction to students"". I have had this experience of crushing on someone who I enormously respect. These are two separate issues in the male mind and if you don't understand that comment then you are not qualified to answer the OP's concerns.  Continue ensuring you are being fair and not making the students uncomfortable. If you find for any reason that you are not being fair, then you have reason to consult someone.   To be a bit more personal, I imagine you would probably find these urges would move away from your students if they were satisfied more fully elsewhere."

Somebody feels something I don't: therefore it must be creepy and immoral.  But it has nothing to do with morality; it just pure luck. If you work with people of gender A and age group B, but are attracted exclusively to people of gender C age group D - good for you. You are lucky, but it doesn't necessarily makes you a more respectful and moral person. If there's some overlap, well, it makes your life a tiny bit harder, but, again, it doesn't make you immoral.

I've taught sections before where literally 75% of the students in the room eventually went on to a doctoral program (PhD, MD, JD) - if you're lucky enough to teach students like that, you know they aren't repugnant children. Rather, they are smart, motivated, and frequently interesting adults. I wouldn't ever get involved with a student for a million other reasons, but it's easy to wind up in a position like OP's if your students are closer to intellectual peers than hopeless sheep.    Imho OP most likely has unresolved sexual issues.   That's totally unsubstantiated and not at all constructive. At worst, it's merely unprofessional and a minor inconvenience to his teaching effectiveness based on the awkwardness he describes. This is a vanilla crush - it's sad that he doesn't have anyone else, but he's not acting on his attraction. He's also showing the self-awareness to monitor his behavior and correct for bias.

You need to set those very clearly in your mind and get up the will-power to keep them clear.   I don't think you're terribly creepy. That said, if this is something you're struggling with, why not go talk to someone? There's no shame in seeking someone safe to talk to and it's much better than trying to deal with this sort of thing alone if it's going to eat you up inside or if you think a time might come where you do cross a line. Make sure it's someone whom you can trust - I'd really recommend a therapist so that nothing can come back and bite you in unexpected ways.   I'm a 25-year-old grad student teaching on my own for the first time this year and have Freshman English classes usually with half women. I tell myself every once in a while to not stare or think too long about any of them, but my will to resist mostly comes from paying attention to what they say and write, realizing how much younger they are not in age but in maturity level - I would never risk my entire life over something stupid like a short-term affair and I really could never see myself dating any of them, even long after they've been my student (which is still a no-no, at least where I am) simply because we'd have so little in common in terms of outlook and life experiences. It probably helps that they all think I'm in my thirties too though  Hope any of this helped.

I still think of them as ""kids"" in my mind and that sort of kills any physical attraction I might have for them. In addition, their intellect isn't really on par with someone I'd be even remotely attracted to, so not only does their age kill it for me, but their lack of life/educational experience kills it as well.   Anyway, my best advice would be to avoid excessive contact if you ever feel like you might be slipping on your self-control. Also, try to think of your career and how it might decline as a result of this obsession and if you ever acted on it.   I've had a colleague who seemed to be getting a little close with a student and I sorta just laid out how it looked from an outside perspective (staying late, going to lunch...etc) .

I think that it's one thing to notice that one of your students is attractive, but quite another to obsess and fantasize the way you're describing. It's a whole other ballpark to have this happen once or twice a year.   These are teenagers. You're an adult. More importantly, they trust you and are there to learn from you, not to be sexually objectified. I think the obsessive crushing you're describing shows a profound lack of respect for your students and the education they expect you to provide.  Deal with this. If you can't change your attitude toward your students, then get professional help.  Edit: a word."

A student comes to your classroom for education, not sexual objectification. A student-professor relationship depends on mutual respect, and sexual objectification undermines that completely.  If you want to crush on college-aged girls, go to a party or bar. Get that bullshit out of your classroom, or get out of the profession."

Also, OP says the sexual fantasies are ""rare,"" but once or twice a year is not rare.

Professors,34uefk,professorcrappycar,3,Tue May 5 01:24:45 2015 UTC,"Imho, crushing is normal, it can happen to everybody. Obsessing (or rather - letting oneself being carried away by it) is psychologically unhealthy in the sense that it can become a habit; and that would be bad.  Long before college professors were invented, priests had very similar problems with their congregations. Origen (a saint heretic) have castrated himself over it: he just couldn't stand the fact that his feelings would stand between him and his vocation. Similarly, ascetic writings from 5-8 centuries have stories of priests who prayed so fervently to God to relief them from this annoying interference that God would send an angel to ""spiritually castrate"" them. The very appearance of these stories shows that people had this cognitive dissonance between their vocation and their ""hormones"" for centuries, and obsessed about it (except that back then they wouldn't write on reddit, but composed apocrypha instead). So unfortunately the problem itself (developing crushes that interfere with professional obligations) is perfectly ""normal"", in a sense that it is almost unavoidable.  And yet most people somehow manage to survive and function without going to the extremes, you know. My guess is that it's mostly humbleness and self-discipline. Don't blame yourself, but also don't let this style of thinking become pervasive. You know by now that it always goes away, and mentally you understand the stupidity of this all. So just relax, and wait until it passes. Don't act on it even mentally. And it will be OK. (Edit: links)"
Professors,34uefk,MrsTiggyWiggy,2,Wed May 6 00:42:05 2015 UTC,"And another thing: I totally hear you on getting lost in self-introspection every time you talk to an attractive student. But think of it: it's the same with extremely unattractive students probably, isn't it? There are probably students whom you like (even though you realize that it's only because you share certain character traits), and students that annoy you. There are students whom it is hard not to judge based on their behavior and their appearance. There are students that ask questions that are silly, and there are some with weird mannerisms. Yet our responsibility is to teach them all, and not to act on our subconscious judgement calls.   And it feels weird sometimes, because every now and then I think: am I being TOO nice to this student just because I don't like them, and I know it, and I am trying to compensate for it right now? And am I maybe too harsh on this one, just because I like them, and don't want it to show?  But my guess is that this awkwardness is OK. It's our responsibility to keep it for ourselves and not make their life harder. Same goes for beautiful ladies: it's not their fault that they are pretty, and their life is harder, in its own way, because of that. There are studies showing that beautiful young women have harder times being hired at certain types of jobs. They are judged based on their appearance, and not always in their favor. Either way, it's our responsibility to make our classes and offices a safe place. Even at the cost of our own awkwardness. Think of it as some payment, some suffering you have to pay with, to make their life better (I'm being very Judeo-Christian right now, I know)."

This shifted students away from history and led to budget cuts in the department. And it is not the higher salary tenure-track or tenured professors who get cut, it is we full-time-yet-still-adjunct professors who are feeling the brunt by not getting our contracts for next year, hearing ambiguous answers from administration when it comes to classes next year, and being left in the dark until the last minute when our grades are already in and our students are blithely unaware that we are being sacrificed at the altar of the 'business model' university. At the same time, our university went Div I NCAA and the 'athletics director' makes more money than any 3 tenured professors combined, the new president makes a 7 figure salary, and the administration has added all kinds of 'directors' and 'assistant deans' to a multitude of departments all the while crying that state funding has been cut and so departments will be budgeted on a business-like ""performance based"" system. Our department budget is 1/4 what it was 3 years ago.  Yes, the system is broken. Yes, we adjuncts need to organize. Yes, we need to bring the system to its knees. The problem is two-fold, though; a) we love our students and our teaching way more than we should and b) most of us who make it through the yearly culling are too scared and sheepish to even entertain the idea of unionizing. I know, I've tried.  I feel for you, both because it seems your students will be losing a dedicated, passionate teacher and because I know that it is a matter of time before it happens to me, too.  I wish you well and will keep my fingers crossed for you. Hell, crossed for all of us 'adjuncts.'  EDIT: Also, I want to take to task other professors who shrug and say ""shit happens"" and act like it is a small tragedy and a shame, but that it is par for the course. it does not have to be, but your compliance allows it to be so. If you stood shoulder-to-shoulder with your non-tenured brethren, it would be a different story - adjuncts would not make nearly-starvation wages and be faced with cyclical unemployement all for the sake of preserving the status quo. You all don't even see it, do you: in the 1970s, only about 20% of lecturers were ""adjunct"" and now 70% are. How soon until you all feel the pinch as we non-tenured professors do? Do you honestly think that, if things remain unchallenged, that you'll be safe on your shrinking iceberg of tenure? How about when tenured professor Baby Boomers retire? Do you think you'll get the nice corner office with a tenured position and sabbaticals? Or do you think it more likely that administrators will replace those tenured professors with adjuncts to save money as more cuts come down the pike? In business, this is called ""downsizing"" ""right-sizing"". And if we're treating universities as a business now, then you all better put your own irons in the fire right away, too.

OK, I'll bite. I don't think organizing is how you fix your problem. Our growing dependence on adjuncts and constriction of humanities departments are driven by much larger issues. The reduction in public funding for higher ed means that we have to squeeze students for more and more tuition just to keep up with inflation. Greater squeeze on students means that institutions have to compete more fiercely for them, and they do so by investing in expensive, non-core features that attract students, like fancy dorms and amenities. The cost of building and maintaining this infrastructure, and hiring administrators to keep it running, only pushes higher ed further into the hole. Effectively, universities are racing each other to the bottom with a business model that runs at a greater and greater loss every year.  The other consequence of leaning so heavily on student tuition is a generation of students who are intensely paranoid about minimizing debt and getting a good return on investment. They focus on majors and programs with good job prospects and a better ROI. Everyone here knows that the humanities teaches important, generalizable skills, but the simple truth is that you have more entry-level job options with a vocational-type major that teaches technical skills. When students flock away from your courses, institutions will obviously move faculty lines and course offerings toward what they want instead.  The only way this idiocy ends is if the students marching out of universities in huge numbers turn into responsible adults who advocate for sensible public funding of higher education. If you want to improve our situation, it starts with converting students into adults who vote and recognize that paying minor taxes is better than creating an entire generation that is severely in debt just for the chance of getting a good enough job to pay those debts. I have zero faith in the efficacy of organized labor in higher ed at this point; you're squeezing blood from a stone. This is a zero-sum game where anything you gain is paid for by your students with a tuition and fee hike."
Professors,34khy6,galileosmiddlefinger,6,Sat May 2 15:53:21 2015 UTC,"While I understand your position, there are a few things we need to get straight. Regardless of the marketability of technical (STEM) degrees, the fact remains that most credible critiques of higher education highlight the ludicrous amounts of money paid to administrators, administrative bloat, rabid desire to be an NCAA participant, and 'spa amenities' for students to make the parents feel like they're sending the kids off to a gigantic summer camp. See:  US News & World Report Why does College Cost So Much?  AAUP Losing Focus: The Annual Report on the State of the Profession  New York Times The Real Reason College Costs So Much  Forbes College Costs Out of Control  Huffington Post Why College Costs So Much  In general these critiques level pretty much the same accusation; the ""amenities"" and ""administration"" costs have far, far outpaced the cost of instruction. For example, Steve Oldland in the Forbes article sums it up pretty well by quoting a Goldwater Institute study which found that ""universities in recent years have vastly expanded their administrative bureaucracies, while in some cases actually shrinking the number of professors."" A sentiment echoed by Paul Campos in the New York Times ""According to the Department of Education data, administrative positions at colleges and universities grew by 60 percent between 1993 and 2009, which Bloomberg reported was 10 times the rate of growth of tenured faculty positions.""   Additionally, I take issue with the assumption that students enter college with ROI on the brain. The truth is, they don't, or at least very few do. As THIS ARTICLE int he Chronicle of Higher Education makes clear, students rarely if ever sit down and consider ROI when entering college. Instead they change majors, move around, and basically find the discipline that fits. What's really aggravating is that policy woks and administrators would have you believe that Humanities are being kept on life support because nobody wants a humanities degree, which simply is not true. The Department of Education's statistics note that in 2012 - 2013, Humanities and Social Science degrees totaled over 30% of the degrees earned by graduates while math, natural sciences, and computer degrees turned out a paltry 16% combined.  So, if humanities degrees remain popular, ROI policy rhetoric is unreliable, and administration costs outpace instruction costs 10 to 1, why do we as professors just shake our heads and say ""what a shame"" instead of doing anything about it? In my opinion, it is fear. There's the fear that speaking up will get you canned - as the OP sort of alludes to in his/her first post. There's also the fear in tenured professors that if they stick their necks out for adjuncts, there will be less salary all around or their status will be compromised by sharing power. Of course, not all tenured and tenure track professors sit back and watch their colleagues make literal poverty wages, but many, many do. And they don't see the adjuncts as 'colleagues' let alone brethren. In many ways, academia is as Socially Darwinistic as an Ayn Rand novel.  So the answer is to organize, to shut the system down and to overhaul it so that people who work damn hard like me, you, and OP, don't get the shaft whenever a new administrator is hired or needs a raise. And we can't wait for students to do it; they have their own lives and concerns - we need to save ourselves, not wait for a Messiah."

I totally agree and said as much in my first post. We're throwing money into non-core amenities and staff to lure students, and it's not sustainable.    Additionally, I take issue with the assumption that students enter college with ROI on the brain.    The Chronicle article is paywalled so I don't know the details, but there is an explosion of interest in calculating the value of a college degree. Outlets like the NY Times, USN&WR, and Forbes regularly publish popular articles on considering the value of a college education. Although it's anecdotal, I've seen my own freshmen change post-recession to become acutely concerned about job prospects and probable debt/income in a way that they never were before. I teach pretty high-ability students and they might not be typical in that respect, but at least some, if not most, students are thinking about this now when few were before. I think this change is good in some respects (e.g., they are very aware of traps like for-profit institutions) and sad in others (e.g., many options are ruled out by default before they are fully explored).   The Department of Education's statistics note that in 2012 - 2013, Humanities and Social Science degrees totaled over 30% of the degrees earned by graduates while math, natural sciences, and computer degrees turned out a paltry 16% combined.   The DoE statistics are messier than they look at first glance. Take a look at this article by Nate Silver. You're absolutely right that the supposed vast decline in humanities degrees is greatly overstated. However, you're not acknowledging the much stronger growth in more vocationally-focused areas, especially business, health sciences, and criminal justice. When there is a (very slight) down-trend in the humanities, but strong demand elsewhere, the humanities are going to suffer relative to those other areas.    So the answer is to organize, to shut the system down and to overhaul it   I pay my union fees on the regular and get to watch my reps get the shit kicked out of them by the state every contract cycle. We've held out before and gone well over a year without a contract; we've held televised protests, walk-outs, all of that stuff. At the end, the state hands down an unfunded mandate to the university to raise salaries by some feeble amount that doesn't even match CoL increases. The administration then panics and yanks up tuition by another couple percent, and we grumble back to our offices until the next round. Honestly, I've never seen organized labor that was worthwhile in higher ed, and I just have far less faith in it than you evidently do."

Professors,34khy6,volcanogirl33,7,Sat May 2 01:42:23 2015 UTC,Have you had this verified by the administration?  If the dean doesn't know about it maybe your colleague was mistaken.

I feel for you, I did this for 3 years after getting my phd, and can only endorse what others have said, which is that you need more irons in the fires to make sure you've always got adjunct work somewhere and to give you options to choose the best work for you (if it's broken you may as well arrange the pieces in your benefit as much as possible).  Having said that, I don't think this is evidence of a broken system, it's evidence of the system doing what it's supposed to do. Your school has decided to offer less lit classes and has used its flexible workers to make an adjustment without having to sack somebody. Think of it from the other side, how would you feel if they'd given you a (non tenure) teaching job and then had to turn around and give you notice? At least in this scenario you are a little less blindsided.  But anyway, time to go and find some more work elsewhere, keep those irons in the fire!"

The promise is that you get to make your own hours, but the reality is that is all day, everyday. The promise is the freedom to travel and learn, but the reality is re-applying for your job security every year (adjuncts) or every five years (tenure-track folks applying for grants). And we're all brainwashed to believe that it's so good, and it's our dream job, that it can be hard to let go.  I am married to a fabulous man who I am deeply in love with. But he is not my soulmate - there is no such thing. If I hadn't have met him, I would probably still be married right now because the human race would not survive if every person couldn't find at least a few people to procreate with. We have been indoctrinated to think of academia like our soulmate, but there is no such thing. There are dozens of jobs that you would be great at, that require your skills and abilities, and that you will genuinely enjoy. You just need to give yourself permission to go find them.  BTW - I quit my tenure-track teaching position last week, and I am stoked about it.

I'm not sure if that's fair. You also said   Our core curriculum has resulted in less classes in literature, so that more elective classes can be added to the business and science departments.    That isn't necessarily the result of horrible money-grubbing policies. There is some supply and demand at play here no? Surely the business and science programs aren't making this change to degree plans on a whim. I doubt that a biology or chemistry degree is losing much more than one or two lit classes as a result of this change. And was your contract not for 9 month cycles? Is this not a risk you signed up for?"
Professors,34khy6,DearSci3nce,5,Sat May 2 08:59:22 2015 UTC,"That risk would be fine if it was being used as it was intended, as a stepping stone to a more permanent place in the department.

And then:   But something like 70 percent of university teachers are adjuncts now, we've become disposable teachers.   Those two sentences are in direct contradiction with one another. The second one is true. The point of the adjunct position is not to serve as a stepping stone to a permanent position, that's what a tenure track position is. The whole point of an adjunct position is to fill temporary and disposable positions. Nobody likes being just an adjunct, but there isn't some panel of university system overlords that got together and decided to use adjuncts positions to screw people over. They are what they are, just like any other temp position. You should use the position to make a bit of money while you search for a more permanent position, and you shouldn't just assume one will open up at the university that gave you a temp job.    And the science and business departments are not the ones forming the core curriculum standards, this is a university wide retraction of what are being seen as non-essential classes.   So, the business and science programs had no say, no voice in the matter? And what classes are these exactly? Did your university require more English lit courses than other competitors?"
Professors,34khy6,DearSci3nce,3,Sat May 2 16:09:49 2015 UTC,"If seventy percent of college professors are adjuncts, does that sound temporary to you?   I've worked as an adjunct in a department with fifty professors in it, that's temporary. This position I was one of six teachers in the department, three of whom are close to retirement. It's not out of line to believe that the administration would at least be aware and possibly give me warning that I wasn't going to be re-hired.  Not sure exactly why you need me to feel worse about my situation by implying I should have known better."
Professors,34khy6,Namemedickles,-3,Sat May 2 19:03:55 2015 UTC,"If seventy percent of college professors are adjuncts, does that sound temporary to you?   How is that relevant? A part-time job is a part-time job even if millions of people are doing it. If you aren't contracted as full-time permanent faculty then yes that sounds temporary to me.  See the dictionary definition:   An adjunct professor is someone who is hired by a college to teach but isn't a full member of the faculty.    This is just what adjunct positions are.   Not sure exactly why you need me to feel worse about my situation by implying I should have known better.   I don't want you to feel worse. I feel bad for you and it sucks. But I think it is important, especially for readers who aren't as familiar with how it works, to point out that this is the nature of the job. This is what an adjunct is. If you want a full-time tenure track position in academia, that can be tough, and the adjunct positions lack job security. That's just the way it is."

Professors,34khy6,Lamech,2,Sun May 3 18:47:43 2015 UTC,"Academia more generally. There are a few permanent positions. To keep those positions, you need to earn (collect data), but there's not time for PIs to collect their own data. They need grad students... they literally need them to keep being PIs. But the pyramid doesn't need the grad students, they just need PIs, of which there are very few positions. Part of that system means there are adjuncts just sitting around, wait for opportunities to work. They were trained, but there is no room for them at the top of the pyramid, is there? So the system takes advantage.   It's a pyramid scheme. As a PI, you need to keep recruiting graduate students, despite the fact that you know the majority won't make it to your position. If you trained only the grad students you knew would be PIs, you wouldn't be a PI very long, would you?  Now imagine a system that actually trains only a small proportion more graduate students than they need PIs. I'm talking 10-20%, rather than 60-70%. Could that really sustain the system, as it exists now, that needs 70% of courses taught by non-faculty?"

Professors,34j0cw,Namemedickles,2,Fri May 1 16:03:27 2015 UTC,"Well, I don't know if it's really the same amount of effort. By cooperating and googling, three or four students can greatly reduce the individual effort that each would apply had they not cheated."

I knew the equipment better than the professor teaching the class. The department didn't like giving us a big load.

The first time out I said I applied to 30 places and only had 10 real applications because the other 20 were not matches and I knew it.

Accepted a time-limited TT SLAC position (negotiated to a 1.5 week decision window) and declined the remaining on-campus interview invitations.   It's indicative of how good the computer science market is this year (especially for education-minded candidates like myself).  One thing I didn't anticipate is the sharking of the SLAC hiring process.  Where the usual computer science R1 faculty hiring timeline looks like:   Jan-Feb: phone interviews Feb-March: on-sites March-April: offers   Many SLACs put out their calls much earlier, even making offers pre-Christmas, in order to preempt the R1s and each other.

Professors,3435jo,BusterTheChihuahua,2,Tue Apr 28 00:13:11 2015 UTC,"What ApolloGT said: Know the institution as much as you can from their website. For example, if they are open admission, work that into the conversation--e.g., ""Since you are an open admission institution, I think it's important that students are given a great deal of support blahblahblah.""  Also, look at the calendar for the descriptions of courses you're likely to be assigned, so you can speak intelligently about how you would teach the courses. Make up a quick course outline for the course you'd likely be assigned--e.g., first-year general science.  I've been on many, many search committees, and the most impressive candidates are those who've done their research on the institution. Any candidate can speak eloquently about her/himself and his/her research or specialty, but very few bother to research the institution itself.  Even though it's lame, you'll get asked about your weaknesses, so be sure to have a handy (but not conspicuously handy) story about a personal teaching failure that you turned around into an incredible (or mild) success.  As far as salaries, with the colleges and teaching universities where I live, faculty have a union, so you get put on a scale based on your education and experience, so there's no negotiation (unless you challenge the years of experience they gleaned from your CV, but that would come much later in the hiring process).  The best piece of advice I ever received when I went to my very first interview over twenty years ago: do the preparation/research beforehand and then, in the interview be yourself. It worked."

How do you make the subjects interesting/relevant etc. to that type of student? (relevant here can include ways that these classes can lead to employment, if whoever is interviewing you seems to be pushing in that direction, but it could include all sorts of other issues as well). Maybe also how does your research reflect those issues or how can your research be relevant to and used in courses for that type of student body. Or they could ask about specific topics you would cover within those biology/ecology courses and ask how you cover them for those types of students.

The person I got my job over actually started bitching about having to teach early classes, they immediately threw her CV into the trash. Try not to make a bunch of excuses for shortcomings and failures. Don't dwell on them. Try to be as personable as possible. A lot of what they might hire you on (not so much at a research school, but a teaching school) will be based upon how ""likable"" you are. This is evaluated during the non-interview times (when they take you out to eat, when you are ""hanging out""). Make some lighthearted jokes, talk about your family/friends.  Do not discuss anything political, ever. Even if they try to pull you into it, don't do it."
Professors,33un34,bamaproud,11,Sat Apr 25 20:05:11 2015 UTC,"I am sorry to read of your struggles and I hope you are able to find help. I think teaching is a delicate matter and of course as humans sometimes we falter. When we falter sometimes that can negatively effect students. However, I think when we fail one of the best thing you can do is promise to yourself that you will never make that same mistake again. You can't go back and change the past but you can prevent it from ever happening again.   As to your students...it seems fairly unethical of the college to tell students you are being fired. I don't think they can do that.    As for the job market, you are technically not being fired. You are a contract employee and they are choosing to not renew your contract. There are many reasons why adjuncts are not renewed. As long as you have strong recommendations, which you should if you are a good teachers, then you should do fine in looking for new jobs."
Professors,33un34,Ltlflwr,4,Sat Apr 25 21:04:08 2015 UTC,I hate that some of them feel like they didn't learn. I have great lesson plans involving a variety of media and really fun activities. But I dropped the ball. It sucks for them. And me.  Now he may not be telling them I got fired. He will likely just discuss options for them since the student that made the complaint mentioned feeling they need to retake the class. I honestly have no clue what exactly will be said. Though I have one outspoken student who I could see telling me everything without prompting.  So I don't necessarily have to say I'd been fired? Would it be unethical to simply say if asked about the job that my contract was not renewed? I suppose I would have to elaborate if asked about reasons.
Professors,33un34,Ltlflwr,1 point,Sat Apr 25 21:12:15 2015 UTC,"I don't think they would ask unless it came up with your references. I've been on a couple search committees and we never ask unless the candidate is not getting tenure and that's why they are let go.  As for the student, I think it shows what a great teacher you are that you care but don't fret too much. Some students are just mean. You may have provided lots of ways for the student to learn and they could still blame it on you.  Ultimately, YOUR health is important and that's what you should focus on. Stop beating yourself up and find some small ways to get yourself back together. Once you do this, the rest will fall in place. :-)"
Professors,33un34,Magnificats,2,Sun Apr 26 12:23:58 2015 UTC,"Thanks. :) I tried but I know there was probably more I could have done. I wanted to and planned to but just didn't.

Professors,33un34,MrsTiggyWiggy,6,Sun Apr 26 16:17:26 2015 UTC,"I have been an adjunct for 23 years (off and on, sometimes with another full time job) and I have never had another school ask why I was no longer at another institution. Apply for other adjunct positions for Fall right now. Also, at the schools I have taught for I am required to find a sub and am docked for the day if I miss, watch out for that in the future. Another thing, dispute the student's accusations, show what material was covered when and how. I know it is not easy but don't let the student and the chair bully you. Good luck."

It is a relief to hear nobody has asked you about your previous institutions! I don't know that I'm being bullied necessarily but I really do think I covered our requirements. I did have to cancel a group project but it was a supplement. It was not the sole assignment addressing the concept. I'm not sure how it was that I taught there for several years and was never made aware of the necessary form for absences. You would think I would have heard about it somehow, especially considering there was one semester maybe three years ago when there was a huge snow storm and on the first day school resumed, many teachers were unable to make it."
Professors,33un34,jessicay,3,Sat Apr 25 21:26:22 2015 UTC,/u/magnificats is right. I've interviewed many adjuncts and we never ask why they left a school. It's assumed that enrollment was down and the class was canceled.

Professors,33un34,jessicay,3,Sat Apr 25 21:54:00 2015 UTC,"I'm tenured, have been at my school for several years, and there are regularly forms and policies referenced that I 1. have never previously heard of and 2. can find no evidence of in our policy archive. It's absolutely infuriating. I've previously worked for institutions that actually had their shit together, but I suspect my current environment is more common. All this to say, OP, there's a good chance this phantom form they wanted you to fill out isn't in regular use or everyone thought it was someone else's responsibility to tell you about it, or nobody ever gave serious thought to how to facilitate administrative functions for adjuncts. I'm going to recommend that you not blame yourself at all for that. Also, this sucks, I'm sorry, and I wish you very well."
Professors,33un34,MrsTiggyWiggy,1 point,Sun Apr 26 00:37:29 2015 UTC,Thanks... I don't know that I ever knew about the form. Maybe it's buried in the depths of our employee handbook. I'm really not sure. It's true I suppose that I should have come to them with my struggles.

Professors,33un34,BusterTheChihuahua,6,Sun Apr 26 00:54:56 2015 UTC,"Really sorry about everything going on and hope you're able to find some peace (and happiness!) as you find closure.  To that end, your questions:  1) As another poster said, know that many students are going to be sympathetic. Beyond that, honestly, who gives a shit? You're not going to see these people again.   2) As others have said, no adjunct positions are going to ask how one of your previous engagements ended.  3) This is the hardest one, of course. And I guess... I don't know if it helps to think of this way, but did you really lose your dream job? You're an adjunct whose job has you so strung out that you're stressed, you don't have health insurance, you have to work multiple jobs to pay rent and bills, and you don't feel job security... is that a dream job?  The context of my saying this is that I taught for 8 years, first as an adjunct then as a full-time lecturer. Teaching was, in a very real way, my dream job... but at some point I just felt ""done."" Done with the lack of job security. Done with the never-ending grading and student emails. Done with the lack of career advancement. So I left. It's been maybe 9 months now and I love my non-teaching job. So I just want to tell you that this so-called dream might not be the worst-ever thing to lose. You deserve a position that pays you, gives you health insurance, etc.  Aside from that answer, I would just say that your students and colleagues will move on, and quickly. Think back to your own college courses, probably freshman college courses. How much do you remember about your instructors? So even if this feels like a huge deal to you, this is a small deal to your students and colleagues, as they have SO much else going on and distracting them (especially gearing up to finals week!).  So for now, then, practice some self-forgiveness. Apply for jobs, seek medical help (as others have said, options are available for people without insurance), and spend time with loved ones who will support you in the ways you need."

When I need you to find a form for me, or submit my travel reimbursement, or get a student enrolled in an independent study, do you, you know, actually do it? The bad office staff I've had just wouldn't. You'd have to hound them, e-mail them, call them six, eight, ten times, while you're waiting on what amounts to a $3k loan to the university because they haven't paid you back for those conference plane tickets yet.  Prompt, efficient, unfailing execution in handling the normal, expected, day-to-day stuff is 90% of it. The office staff at my current university are like this -- if you write them to get it done, it's happening, and I can immediately forget about it, because I trust them. That's worth a whole, whole lot."

I submitted everything on time and was the winner of my school's evaluation. The department staff member did not submit my papers to the state competition on time and I was disqualified from the competition.  My faculty advisor spent several days on the phone trying to get me back in due to the ""clerical"" error but was unsuccessful.  Now, it is true that we don't know if I would have won and the chances were in fact quite small that I would have.  Still, this was completely unacceptable and pissed everyone off who was involved.  This just echoes  the other posts. Just do the job well."
Professors,33ocee,idahogirl4,6,Fri Apr 24 04:02:51 2015 UTC,"We also moved to online evals a few years ago. We get about 75% participation by releasing grades late for students who don't complete them. I don't much like all the stock that's put into them by promotion committees, but mine are good so I'll push for a change after tenure!"
Professors,33ocee,AerosolHubris,3,Fri Apr 24 10:23:16 2015 UTC,"I am curious how other institutions do SCEs. We do paper format. We had huge issues with low participation when they were online.  What does your institution do? Do you have a set time that you give them?  We get ours around midterm, but we can have them completed any time before the end of the semester."
Professors,33ocee,evenfalsethings,6,Fri Apr 24 04:17:37 2015 UTC,"We moved to online SCE's ~4-5 semesters ago. Students get ~3-4 weeks to complete the online evals, with email reminders every 2-3 days until they're complete or until the last day of class closes the eval period.   Officially, our target response rate is 75 or 80%. In practice, 20-30% is typical. Two semesters ago, the Accountability folks decided that the problem was that the evals asked too many questions. Our new eval only asks ~5 questions (was the course organized, was graded work fair, did the prof provide feedback, did the prof use a teaching style that worked for you, were you satisfied with the prof's out of class availability, & a space for comments). It seems like completion rate has gone down since the shortening (not to mention losing out on potentially worthwhile feedback). So, our online evals are basically shit. I miss the paper evals."
Professors,33ocee,RhinestoneTaco,3,Fri Apr 24 09:12:13 2015 UTC,"Ours are online and non-mandatory. I have one day in class toward the end of the semester where I ask that they all bring in a laptop or tablet (If it's not in a room with a computer) and I bring in a large box of cookies.  As they come into the room with the computer, I give them a cookie. I then explain the importance of evals, and that I really do read them. Then I ask that they all log onto the eval system and do the eval as I step out of the room. I encourage them to get another cookie when they are done."

But, they just overhauled the system so that it's more user-friendly and the questionnaire itself is a lot more student-friendly, with more open-ended questions about how they thought things went vs. a bland likert written mostly in educational theory terms. I'm interested to see how it turns out."
Professors,33ocee,silly_walks_,2,Fri Apr 24 14:22:03 2015 UTC,"We do both an online, university wide, multiple choice evaluation and an in-class, department specific (English), narrative evaluation.   The multiple choice evaluations are somewhat helpful, because they ask specific questions students almost never think to ask themselves (How well does this instructor respect diversity? How did the workload in this class compare to others?). The narrative evaluations, however, are so much more helpful.   Still, I'm always more interested in secondary assessment than self-reporting."

My SO is an economics prof, and while he was on the tenure-track he was assigned by his department to accomplish and essentially impossible set of objectives. They didn't teach very much math in that degree, ridiculously enough, nor writing skills. Recognizing that this was a problem, they tried to fix the whole program by having my partner cram both of those objectives into his courses, while changing nothing else in the program. So basically he got a shit assignment because he was the new guy in the department. Unsurprisingly, students hated it, and he got consistently bad evaluations for all the years where he was stuck with this ridiculous assignment. Eventually, realizing that this was going to kill him in his tenure evaluation, he just deviated from the assignment entirely, and made the course much more similar to what the students had experienced in other courses during their degree. Unsurprisingly, his teaching evaluations improved dramatically. But as far as the Dean was concerned, it seemed like my SO finally figured out how to teach."
Professors,33ocee,HeavilyBearded,1 point,Fri Apr 24 15:30:07 2015 UTC,"As a Master's student this is absolutely terrifying to read. Im located in Ohio, but the thought that this idea could be spreading around really scares me. I think there are a few questions that the article addresses very well. First, do students see what we are trying to do and do they have a full understanding to truly evaluate what we do. Also, are these even credible ways to evaluate instructors, wouldn't something like observation from senior faculty be more useful and representative of course goals? I think it's scary that we, those of us in the United States, live in a country where there seems to be some war on educators. People act as though they are purchasing an education by entering higher education when they're truly just getting an opportunity to become educated."
Professors,33nh1p,justwanderedin,8,Thu Apr 23 23:20:58 2015 UTC,I'm not sure what you are teaching but perhaps you could record a lecture and post it to YouTube to make up for the class lost? Combine that with extra office hours and a study session to help them prepare for exams.  You don't want to disadvantage the students but you certainly want to take the interview.

I can tell you that if you aren't all in, the committee will hire one of the other candidates. Like the previous commenter stated, find something easy for the 3 classes to do while you are away. However, spend most of your time getting geared up for your day of interviews and putting on the smile. Because of you don't, someone else will. Don't be so tight either...loosen up, laugh, make easy jokes. Have ideas and ask questions if the committee asks for them. Talk to the students whenever you have downtime and show them that you would basically live in the department. It's ok to share about your personal life but the committee can't ask you about those things unless they are a private institution. Find engaging ways to bring students into your demo presentation. Do these things and no doubt you will be considered."

Alternatively, you could throw together a practice exam to offer through your CMS instead of class. If you have a Tutorial Services type department, you could ask them to come in and teach a session on effective studying methods. If there's a course-related film or exhibition or play or something going on, you could offer that with a reflection paper or something for last-minute extra credit. If they're doing a paper, require them all to go to the writing centre or to the library for a research consultation.  TL;DR: Take the interview!"

The fact that you're even asking this question is an indicator that you need to focus on your future career and not your present job.

Professors,33oc1g,idahogirl4,4,Fri Apr 24 04:59:45 2015 UTC,"The best approach is to ask your professor.  If I assigned a 20 page paper, I would be happy with 18.  My main goal would be to ensure that the assignment guidelines were met material wise. I would also expect detail and explanation. If it is original research, it is harder to attach a specific page length. If it is a report, it is a bit easier.  I do not deduct huge amounts for length. It really depends.  As you know, grading can be a bit subjective."
Professors,33oc1g,punctuation-marks,6,Fri Apr 24 05:18:52 2015 UTC,"I'd rather have something that thoroughly covered the material than something filled with fluff for a few paragraphs. If something is shorter than the requirements, it better be great."

Professors,33oc1g,foreverlots,3,Fri Apr 24 05:01:00 2015 UTC,"If I assign a 20 page paper it's because I want a paper that has the level of thought and complexity and research that goes into a paper of that length. This means that if a paper has all those things and is well done, I'm not overly concerned if it exactly fits the required 20 pages. I would think a good student could achieve that in 18, maybe even 17 pages. But if it gets much shorter than that then it is a different type of paper, with less development and complexity than I was looking for, and so I would count off. In other words, the assigned page count (for me at least) is more of a guide for the level of paper I expect rather than just a random number, like a hoop to jump through to qualify."
Professors,33oc1g,SolidRambo,3,Fri Apr 24 06:04:59 2015 UTC,"Our policy is +/- 10% of wordcount. If it's below word count, you better be concise and still writing a good analysis with lots of depth."
Professors,33oc1g,Caddy15,2,Fri Apr 24 11:35:16 2015 UTC,"I really don't like word/page counts. I generally give a suggested page count but stress that if they feel they can be succinct while managing to cover everything, that's fine. Similarly, if they feel the need to expand, that's fine as well. This generally applies to larger research papers, if I'm asking for a 2-3 page paper I would be more inclined to deduct points because it's really not too difficult to sit down and write 1,000 words about something.  To be honest if you think your paper is really good and 18 pages just turn it in, and if you don't achieve your desired grade just discuss it with your professor afterwards."

It's my experience that when one students complains about how unfair multiple instructors are, it usually isn't the faculty members' fault."
Professors,338o1w,FGF10,-1,Mon Apr 20 19:02:55 2015 UTC,I don't see multiple complaints or even a complaint. Perhaps I phrased my question in a way that unintentionally demonstrated bias. Those are the only issues I ever heard of in the largest department. I'm really just curious about whether or not appeals ever succeed. The institution I attended first simply told us that we could appeal but that we'd never succeed.
Professors,338o1w,ProfAbroad,3,Mon Apr 20 20:30:03 2015 UTC,"If you can't see a complaint in how you've phrased this question, you should make another post complaining about your rhetoric instructor's inefficacy.    Didn't we also previously have a conversation about your problem with various survey course instructors teaching in too much depth on a single topic for your liking?"
Professors,338o1w,ProfAbroad,1 point,Tue Apr 21 01:45:10 2015 UTC,"It's not that I'm trying to attack anymore. I makes no sense really to post a question that says, ""My advisor was the greatest advisor anyone could ask for. Would you like to hear why?"" My undergraduate experience was actually quite excellent. Most of my issues arose from the administration losing paperwork, ect. I simply want answers from real professor on issues that I've always been curious about."
Professors,338o1w,Unicormfarts,5,Tue Apr 21 14:30:41 2015 UTC,Faculty have a great deal of discretion and freedom in assigning grades. Students often get their grades changed by talking directly to the professor. If you have to go to a formal review process than there has to be a clear and blatant bias or discriminatory practice by the professor I think for someone to force the professor to change a grade. The student would have to present overwhelming evidence to that.  Students should always just talk to the professor first to come to an agreeable solution to problems. Only in cases of specific discrimination should they go to a formal appeal.
Professors,338o1w,Unicormfarts,2,Mon Apr 20 22:56:58 2015 UTC,"That seems like it would be very difficult to prove discrimination. In most cases though, professor aren't discriminatory, so there's not really an issue."
Professors,331h47,prof_throwaway_2,7,Sat Apr 18 16:28:41 2015 UTC,"I'm tenured at a decidedly unprestigious institution in a department that is regularly denigrated by the the administration. I'm staying. I get to live in a pretty great place, my salary is comfortable, and I have the freedom and autonomy to do pretty much whatever I want to do. I work on research projects with colleagues in much more supportive and prestigious institutions, I publish and present in most of the same venues, and I'm usually able to tamp down the compulsion to apologize for my limited pedigree. I'm still the only one of my cohort to get any tenure-track job. I did try the market last season and got several offers, but my current position is still better."

For me, it would have to be denial or loss of tenure status, my family's displeasure of our location, or a serious illness that requires me to move. Other than that, there are goods and bads everywhere, so it doesn't matter much. In my experience the higher ranking and larger departments have more infighting and political battles than smaller places but it could just be my experience.   When is it bad to move? When it's about your ego."
Professors,331h47,MrsTiggyWiggy,4,Sun Apr 19 05:16:12 2015 UTC,"I'm writing as someone who happily settled into a non-prestigious position. I trained at an R1 with a well-known advisor and took a job in a city I love at a community college. I have been very happy.  I think you should consider how important your research is to the world. If your research is making the world better, you should protect it and continue it. If your research is only good for adding to your CV, well...I would also say that there's no harm in that. It's seems low-risk to me for you to just start shopping around and seeing what else is out there.  tl;dr - I'm happy with my small patch of green but I don't see why you can't look around at greener climes."
Professors,331h47,bitchwithacapital_C,2,Sat Apr 18 17:26:55 2015 UTC,"From what I understand it would be best to wait until tenure to apply to other jobs. That way if you start looking and people know you're looking it won't come back on you during the tenure process. I guess it really depends on how far from it you are.   In addition I do think you should question whether the grass just seems greener. All departments have their issues and can work against your work, so you have to be careful about thinking that if you move elsewhere you'll get more done. If there's one thing I've learned about academics is that we make horrible managers and yet we run entire departments and schools with no training on how to do it!"
Professors,331h47,shateredsoul,2,Sat Apr 18 22:05:24 2015 UTC,"That's a tough question. I'm still a graduate student, but have a few colleagues who have started at R1s. There life is research. I understand to some this is a dream. Doing what you love, but the level of work is really unhealthy in a few cases (notice the divorce rates among those we call prestigious!). I've seen professors who are now older, prestigious, but outside of their department they don't have much in terms of a social or even family life.  It sounds like you're at an institution where you can do the work you want, you have some sort of life balance (I'm guessing from your comment on fam happiness), but the facilities and support is non-existent. The way I see it, the decision isn't only about prestige, it's about quality of life."

Professors,32ybeg,evenfalsethings,6,Fri Apr 17 19:55:14 2015 UTC,"No, you're not missing something. It's just that I like to see my students achieve and it sucks to see them not do it. Even worse when they fail.  edit: spelling"
Professors,32ybeg,evenfalsethings,3,Fri Apr 17 19:58:10 2015 UTC,"Hm. I think we have slightly different approaches.   I like to see my students meet their own goals and I like to see their efforts pay off, but I am not emotionally attached to their letter grades. I don't think I could do my job effectively if I were. My job includes setting reasonable performance standards, selecting appropriate target material, helping students meet or exceed expectations in accordance with their goals, and fairly & impartially assigning marks based on the intersection of #1 & #3; it definitely does not include caring more about their grades than they do.   I hate to make a parenting analogy here, but, to me, not failing students who have earned it is very similar to how some parents go out of their way to avoid enforcing appropriate consequences for their children's behavior out of some need to feel like the friendly/cool/relaxed/whatever parent (or fear of being resented, or whatever other reason)."
Professors,32ybeg,NighthawkFoo,1 point,Fri Apr 17 20:14:40 2015 UTC,"I agree.  You shouldn't delight in failing students, but you should be fully prepared to give them the grade they deserve."

Professors,32ybeg,simoncolumbus,2,Fri Apr 17 20:06:53 2015 UTC,"I guess how you feel about this, and how others here will react, depends heavily on the environment you teach in.   I teach in a small, selective programme in which such behaviour would have all kinds of alarm bells ringing. I'd either be the student's mentor myself, or if not, I'd discuss this with their's - most likely, the mentor would ask the student to come in for a meeting. If there's further cause for concern, I'd also inform the student counsellor (which I'd have to do anyway if the student is missing mandatory classes). If the student does not react to email (and doesn't show up for class), there isn't much we could do, though.   At my alma mater, which is residential, the student counsellor might have contacted the resident assistants to get in touch with the student at their place; though that's rare (usually only when students are known to have a history of mental illness, perhaps also drug use)."
Professors,32ybeg,amightypirate,2,Fri Apr 17 20:09:39 2015 UTC,"It's better to think of it this way:  You are not failing him. He has failed.  You sound like a passionate and caring teacher and your students and your institution are lucky to have you. But you can't do the work for them. The student doesn't attend, doesn't engage but most importantly he cannot code. If you passed him you would literally be certifying his ability, and that would be false."
Professors,32ybeg,Rtalbert235,1 point,Mon Apr 20 14:19:24 2015 UTC,"The instinct to reach out to this student is good. But ultimately we have to realize that university students are adults, and we need to treat them as such -- and that there is a limit to what we can do for them in terms of their education. Education that isn't attained by the free choice of the student is no education at all.   If you've given plenty of opportunities to succeed and made yourself reasonably available for help, and the student has simply chosen not to do the work to a sufficiently high level of quality, then you've done your part; give the student the grade he's earned.   It would be interesting to know if there is a back story here, maybe some personal problems the student is working through that would make it hard to do the work but the student for good reason is not forthcoming about that. At this stage of the game you can't do much about such situations but maybe next time, if a student starts showing these behaviors, you could discreetly ask whether everything is OK."

The rest just never 'showed up'. I went so far as to give them a retest opportunity after asking a colleague to review the test to ensure it was appropriately rigorous (it was). They had one week to prepare. They failed the same test TWICE.  This is my third time teaching the course and I had normal distribution the first two times. I've made some changes to the course to make it a bit easier after some student feedback last semester. If students fail to show mastery of the material, that's that. Don't feel bad for assigning the appropriate letter to their level of knowledge and effort."

I'm teaching an undergraduate course that I've never taught before this coming Fall. I've selected the texts, but that's about it at the current moment.  I should have my final grades in by May 1st. The month of May will be a mix of short breaks and focusing on getting a publication out the door. In June I plan to construct the syllabus, get prepped 2/3rds through. July will be about re-vamping previously taught courses, turning my attention to a different publication and relaxing here and there. In August the plan is to slowly ease back into things , go over all my material and ~maybe~ finishing up this new course (though chances are most of the finishing up will come on a teaching off day when my wife is at work).   This is only really applicable to Fall and I guess 2015. If I were teaching a new course in the Spring it would probably be substantively different/stressful."
Professors,32t0r0,SolidRambo,1 point,Sat Apr 18 01:49:34 2015 UTC,"High level conceptual planning, for example overarching learning goals for the course and big ideas about what I want students to do: Maybe a month out from the start of the semester.   Low level ""rubber meets the road"" planning, for example setting up the syllabus and the Blackboard site: Usually like a week out. I like to get all the course structures and grading system down on paper and then take a few days to live with it in my head before I make it official.   And I am still tweaking right up until the top of the hour of the first class.   EDIT: One exception would be special seminar classes that require lots of advanced planning. For example I teach a cryptography and privacy class and I like to have guest speakers come in; some of those folks have to be contacted at least a year in advance because their schedules are so busy. That course is taught every other year and whenever I come across a news article I want to include in the next iteration, I clip it into Evernote, so in that sense I am continuously planning for the course."

Professors,32g4lr,mathhelpguy,14,Mon Apr 13 16:48:27 2015 UTC,"Congrats! If you change your testing procedures, consider letting students know why; that you suspected cheating and found evidence.  This will let them know you are on to them.  Otherwise, you might be seen as an ignorant push-over."

Professors,32g4lr,sunflowerfly,9,Wed Apr 15 02:39:14 2015 UTC,"Students like to take screenshots of the questions.  5 attempts is quite a lot for exams, so you are giving them many opportunities to see the questions.  Between the 3 of them, that's 15 looks at the test. Also, are you giving them the opportunity to pause the test and return later?  This could also be a major contributing factor."
Professors,32g4lr,Namemedickles,11,Mon Apr 13 16:28:35 2015 UTC,"I agree but what's confusing me is that all three would get 100% on the first attempt. They weren't using multiple attempts, ever.

Professors,32h6xk,flunkinaj,4,Mon Apr 13 19:45:57 2015 UTC,I'm not sure what you are teaching or what kinds of discussion you are looking for. I'm also not sure what you've tried in class. The easiest technique is to give them a question and ask them to discuss it it groups for 5-10 minutes and write an answer. Then come back to the main class and ask them to report what their groups discussed. The questions you give them are important though. They need to facilitate discussion by allowing alternate views and maybe even a little controversy or debate. I often also simplify and relate the material to their lives to increase discussion. Rather than discuss the India-Pakistan relations I start by having them discuss the college football rivalries.
Professors,32h6xk,ProfAbroad,1 point,Mon Apr 13 21:22:49 2015 UTC,"I really like the emphasis on relating discussion (alternate views, controversy, and debate), into a group based approach. I am nearing the end of the semester, just frustrated with what I saw this semester. I teach mostly entrepreneurship based courses, so I feel like it should be something students would want to be engaged in. I'll take a few of these practices and use them in the future, and let you know how they work! Thanks so much for the input."
Professors,32h6xk,Trillian42,3,Tue Apr 14 17:20:57 2015 UTC,"As ProfAbroad said, without knowing what you teach, this may be hard to answer. In addition to group work, one way to handle those 1v1 emails may be to have students write questions on notecards (either anonymously or not), collect them and answer them in a variety of ways. You could respond to them collectively in class the next day (particularly if a lot of students have similar questions), pose the questions to the class and ask them to brainstorm answers, assign the questions to groups and have them research and report the answers back to the class in some kind of presentation, or set them up as discussion questions in your LMS and then require participation.  Another activity would be to have students prepare and present on class material. You could even have groups develop activities for the other students to practice skills (perhaps with your guidance on best practices for interactive and fair activities).   Students often like feeling recognized and involved in their own learning."
Professors,32h6xk,Trillian42,1 point,Mon Apr 13 22:44:20 2015 UTC,"I will try 'asking for content' approach. I think this is a good way to get a discussion ignited. I am thinking about using twitter instead of the LMS, (like I said above it really sucks & i don't want to have to force my students to use it). Have you ever tried something, a third party app, for a discussion board?   I do believe getting the students to feel recognized in their learning is key. Students are humans too, that's how I learn best, or are motivated to learn best."
Professors,32h6xk,Trillian42,2,Tue Apr 14 17:23:46 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, I have not tried other discussion boards.

Professors,32h6xk,hftdrive55,2,Tue Apr 14 17:31:18 2015 UTC,"Well, I can't speak for all universities, but I don't think mine does, especially since students are often mostly connected to and familiar with tech anyway. Maybe check with the head of your department? I don't know if you're in the US, but the only risk I can think of with using outside tech may be potential student privacy violations. Maybe research FERPA and ask your department what they suggest. Just be careful what gets posted publicly about your students."
Professors,32h6xk,jewel_ofthenile,2,Tue Apr 14 17:47:09 2015 UTC,I feed them content (podcasts) with possible discussion questions and then a short follow up quiz (for credit) on our LMS before they come to classtime. I agree that LMS discussions are tricky.
Professors,32h6xk,idahogirl4,1 point,Tue Apr 14 03:34:04 2015 UTC,"I agree, the LMS discussion is tricky. I asked /u/Trillian42 about using third party apps/websites for discussion.

Some semesters were very active conversation and most years not so much.  Like every other method, it depends on the dynamics of the class.

I was surprised at how many of us admitted to crushes on students.  It's really tough to spend so much time with students, and to be encouraged to form these strong bonds with them, but have to artificially force ourselves to halt any romantic feelings we might have.

Thanks for the Slate article. I didn't really like the author's tone, and I can't say I agree with her, but she says a lot that makes sense. (In particular, the whole concept of ""unwanted sexual advances"" is such bullshit that it should be forever banished.)  Btw, the student in question is a first year PhD student.

As academics, we are exceedingly rare and, if we wish to partner with someone with similar interests, backgrounds, methodologies, and values, our pickings are quite limited.   So, were I in your position, I would be thinking of this situation as a choice between my professional and and personal lives--struggling with the answer because, of course, the fantasy solution is to have both in one."
Professors,326vy1,critropolitan,2,Sat Apr 11 02:45:32 2015 UTC,"I agree with you. In the original thread, someone told me that my being ""desperate"" was no excuse. I don't know if I'd call myself ""desperate,"" but the fact is that I seem to be attracted to a fairly small fraction of the population, and this seems to have a lot to do with the same personality traits that turned me into an academic."
Professors,326vy1,kairoschris,2,Sun Apr 12 04:00:48 2015 UTC,"Its not a choice between professional and personal lives.  In your professional life, you are duty bound not to have a sexual relationship with someone whom you hold power over, who is not a social equal, who is in a vulnerable position to you, and where such a relationship would undercut the ability of other similar situated people (students) to trust you.  In your personal life, you shouldn't want a sexual relationship with someone who doesn't stand in relations of social equality to you, whose volition is compromised by her* position of vulnerability and precarity.    This is a case where your personal and professional lives are in alignment, unless you're a lecherous narcissist.    *yeah, I don't know the gender/sexual orientation of the OP but I know most creepy preditory professors are straight men."
Professors,326vy1,pentad67,2,Sat Apr 11 04:37:51 2015 UTC,"If he was predatory, he would have just done it. In fact the act of seeking advice before doing something that could have caused one or both of them professional damage indicates that his intentions are in no way nefarious.   What is predatory is the way you have attacked someone who was simply seeking advice in a grey area, which is exactly what the OP is in. Most university harassment/fraternization policies do not prohibit faculty members who socialize with or date students not under their direct supervision or influence. Still the OP still felt iffy about proceeding and asked for help.  He has done nothing to warrant your extreme reaction to his plea."
Professors,326vy1,Namemedickles,1 point,Sun Apr 12 05:14:50 2015 UTC,"I know most creepy preditory professors are straight men.   As the gender balance of professors becomes more equal, this will presumably change."

If anything were to ever happen with a breakup you are likely to be fucked, due to the inherent power dynamic of a student/professor relationship, even if you don't teach/advise/etc. her. You could still be a dissertation chair, committee member, comprehensive exam grader, etc. that could mess up your career and create a bias claim. You stated ""at this time;"" that could change. See: http://www.tallahassee.com/story/news/2015/03/04/fired-criminology-professor-coming-fsu/24382803/  In that instance, a student filed a lawsuit. While obviously some of the stuff she alleges may not be true or overstated, there is no way she won't win due to the power dynamic.  Maybe I'm being too critical, but I think it is not a risk worth taking for career reasons (notwithstanding the ethical reasons that people have largely already covered)."

If she is comfortable and self-possessed enough to engage in a relationship with you, then that's between the two of you.    BUT...there are some things that are NOT between the two of you.  For instance: You are going to get a reputation for being sketchy.  Some people will think that you are predatory.  Your colleagues may be wary of allowing you to interact with students in the future.  Do you have tenure yet?  If so, then the age difference makes this even sketchier.  If not, this is likely going to affect your tenure review process when it becomes known (and it absolutely will become known.)    It's going to affect her, too.  She's younger and just starting out in her career, so she might not have the perspective yet to understand how.  Other graduate students will judge her very harshly.  If she's an above average graduate student who is productive, then others will (unfairly) credit her success to banging PIs.  If she is average to below-average and still finishes, they will assert that she squeaked through by banging PIs.  Other faculty members will be hesitant to interact with her.  When she applies for postdoctoral or faculty positions, if her past is discovered, those rumors will play into the hiring decision.    Some of these judgments are fair, most are unfair.  But they are real and will affect both you.  You already have some success in your career.  Is it fair of you to engage in behavior with her that might sabotage her career before it even begins?  These are the discussions you need to have with yourself and her before pursuing this."

Professors,31ygmn,ryanpsych,1 point,Fri Apr 10 18:55:20 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the thoughtful reply. First, I don't really care all that much what people think of me. I care what I think of me. And I'd like to think that the people who know me and respect me now would not lose respect for me over something like this, but who knows. I'm so manifestly not a womanizer or anything like that, that the idea of having that sort of a reputation just seems far-fetched to me.  As a side remark, I am recently tenured (and honestly, if I weren't, I wouldn't even be asking this question), and there is a rather large age gap, but I believe I can pass the X/2+7 rule (or I'm close to it).  You make an excellent point about potential damage to her and her career. Even for peer couples, there are assholes who tend to credit a woman's successes to her husband/boyfriend. I can definitely see harsh judgment from other grad students, but I don't see as much of a problem with actual researchers or experts, because my expertise is nearly useless in her chosen research area."
Professors,31ygmn,FGF10,9,Fri Apr 10 02:54:24 2015 UTC,"You kinda/sorta/almost had me ambivalent about this topic until this response.  It shows a frightening lack of insight.  As I said, I totally agree that you have the legal, regulatory, and perhaps moral right to carry on a relationship with whomever you choose.  But some points that stick out to me:  You say, ""I am recently tenured (and honestly, if I weren't, I wouldn't even be asking this question)..."".  The implication that I draw is that you realize this would negatively affect your career were you not already tenured, and would not risk that.  Yet you are surprisingly cavalier regarding the potential effects to her career.  The distinction you draw between these career pitfalls for you both seems arbitrary.  ""Even for peer couples, there are assholes who tend to credit a woman's successes to her husband/boyfriend.""  Without knowing your field, I can't comment extensively on this.  Comparing a peer relationship, where the best the partner could do is offer insight and assistance, to a faculty/student relationship where the faculty member could (and most might assume would) use their position to administratively benefit the student seems an inequitable comparison.  Beyond that, the statement smacks of pandering.    ""I can definitely see harsh judgement from other grad students...I don't see as much of a problem with actual researchers or experts.""  Eh?  Her fellow grad. students will presumably be ""actual researchers"" and ""experts"" very soon, assuming your department is doing its job correctly.  This reputation will hound her during the most important part of her career when she develops a foundation of expertise in her field, and connects with lifelong peers in her discipline.    ""...the idea of having that sort of reputation just seems far-fetched to me.""  If the idea was so far-fetched, then I'm not sure I understand why you sought our counsel in the first place.  Surely you are familiar with the professor-who-sleeps-with-students trope.  It's practically a cliche.  If you sleep with this student, you will develop this reputation.  It's 100% guaranteed that some portion of your colleagues, students, and administrators will interpret the situation in that way.  It might be a minority...but it is inevitable.    One final note that gives me pause: in your entire three paragraph response, you only refer to her once (and obliquely in that instance).  Now, perhaps it's psychologism on my part...but I can't help but read a little further into that.  Good luck with whatever the two of you choose to do.  I honestly hope it works out for both of you.  Please be careful though.  My grad. school is currently in the midst of a very public, very embarrassing sexual harassment suit, and it's brought the neuroscience graduate program to its knees."
Professors,31ygmn,ryanpsych,1 point,Fri Apr 10 03:34:38 2015 UTC,"Well, someone might choose not to do something either because it's stupid, or because it's just ""wrong"" (in the ethical sense). With respect to the tenure issue, I was simply acknowledging that if it's stupid enough, then there's no need to consider whether or not it's wrong.  And just to reiterate: I am mainly seeking counsel on the ethical question (on which the community answer seems slightly divided). I am happy to receive insights on to what it extent it's just a really bad idea, but that wasn't what I was seeking.  As for what's good or bad for her, it's interesting because it's sort of related to my original question (and your original answer): Are we just adults who are responsible for deciding what's in our respective overall best interests? Or is it part of my professional responsibility to shelter her from making bad decisions?  (Without attempting a point-by-point rebuttal, I'll just say that I don't think it would be quite as awful for her as you make it out to be, but on the other hand, I accept that my judgment may be clouded.)"

You are technically her superior, as has been pointed out below, but furthermore, you might give the appearance of impropriety which is often enough to cause problems for her and probably for you.   Additionally, think about what might happen if this relationship you intend turns sour; lots of people think ""aw, that won't happen. So-and-so is very cool/enlightened/sweet/etc."" but it can happen. One big argument, one relationship snag, one dose of disillusionment and BANG! instant bad break up. If it does go sour, either you or she can cause trouble for both of you through petty vindictiveness, envy, or who knows what.  If you really are attracted to her, and she to you, then wait until she has finished her degree and is no longer in your department...hell, no longer in your school, in my opinion...and then see what happens."

If you really think this woman could be one of the loves of your life, your future wife, then that's one thing.  If you feel less certain of where it might go, then that is more of an indication to steer clear.  All of the issues I have encountered from situations like you describe have been from more causal relationships or ones that involved infidelity.  On the other hand, I had a colleague marry a student in her program without incident.  He was her student, but he transferred to another lab.  Because they were serious and because junior colleagues marry senior ones all the time, little more was said about the issue.   Once the student you are interested in is ABD, I think a lot of issues will be off the table.  If she is the woman of your dreams (and you are the man of hers), then you can wait until she advances to candidacy.

Try group projects, long-form essays (10 pages or so), research projects that take them into the field, a class wiki, maybe even handing over responsibility for teaching a specific lesson to several groups. Make them work harder, diversify their experience, and dig deeper. When I've done that, I discover just how much of the information they're absorbing, as opposed to simply regurgitating for a test."

It compares submissions to books, articles, websites, and documents already submitted into the TurnItIn system (so you can be sure that students aren't recycling friends' responses from previous semesters).  It also highlights the matching portions and provides the other document, which makes filing any honor court documents really easy.  If your school has an online submission program (e.g. Blackboard), you can probably have it auto-check submissions without you or the students having to do anything extra.  There have been debates on here before about using TurnItIn, but I've found that it works well as long as you actually look over any questionable reports to see how closely matches line up."

It takes longer to grade but it's worth it I think."
Professors,31w7i1,Rhizobium,4,Wed Apr 8 23:23:44 2015 UTC,"You're stuck with multiple-choice, since your teaching load and university support are creating a situation where you can't use essay questions.  There's a nasty way to write multiple-choice questions that make them way harder though.  If I were to ask a multiple-choice question about your post I could try:  What sort of classes does MrsTiggyWiggy teach? A) Small seminars. B) Honors courses. C) Large survey classes. D) Graduate-level courses.    And that's pretty straightforward.  Or I could give a weird-ass modified true-false question like this:  Which of the following statements are true regarding MrsTiggyWiggy's classes? A) All of her classes are graduate-student level. B) She is concerned that too many students are failing. C) Her exams consist of multiple-choice questions. D) She has not seen any learning or growth in her students.    The second multiple-choice question covers way more material than the first, and many more students will get it wrong.  I'm not a fan of this approach, since a former colleague I didn't like introduced me to it.  But if you want to make your exams harder it does the job."

Professors,31otsy,Redpuppies,35,Mon Apr 6 23:57:02 2015 UTC,"I would suggest starting by acknowledging that your professor is probably correct.  Although there may be a small error from the professor in one or two places for the most part teachers do have experience and know what they are talking about . Second, I suggest acknowledging that good writing is hard work.  It may take an inexperienced writer months or years more to make something as good as an experienced writer. The fact that you put your heart and soul into the writing does not make it good. It is good that you cared about the assignment and worked hard. What a lot of students forget is that if you didn't work so hard you would have done even worse most likely. So your effort does give benefit.  Third, I suggest you go through every comment and try to understand it. Try to fix it and make it better. Start with the meta. Look at any comments that discuss overall structure and organization first. Don't worry about spelling or grammar issues at his point. Then as you go through the revisions, move to more detailed comments.  Finally, after having done all that take the original rough draft with all the comments from the professor and your revised essay to the professor's office hours. Bring with you a list of any comments you found difficult to understand or that you are struggling to improve. Tell your professor that you tried to address all the comments but you have some questions and you would like some additional assistance. Tell them you have a new draft of the paper that tried to fix the problems based on the comments. If you do not have enough time in office hours ask for a separate appointment time to continue the discussion and to get extra help."
Professors,31otsy,ProfAbroad,8,Tue Apr 7 00:21:50 2015 UTC,"I would like to chime in and add that all rough drafts suck in some way, that's why we call them rough.  We edit and revise the paper again and again until we manage to get our point across in a clear and concise manner.  Even professional authors revise their work over and over, it's part of the writing process.  I know comments on drafts can sometimes hit a nerve but they will generally help make your paper better.  Try not to take them personally."
Professors,31otsy,volcanogirl33,3,Tue Apr 7 03:09:27 2015 UTC,This is very true. I actually show students some of my work in progress so they know that not everything starts good. I sometimes go through tens of versions of something depending on the complexity of the article.
Professors,31otsy,ProfAbroad,7,Tue Apr 7 03:17:55 2015 UTC,"I will mostly echo /u/ProfAbroad's comments. Good writing is hard work, but not all hard work results in good writing (just as more words doesn't mean it's better than fewer words).  I would expect the professor to discuss with you the goals of the assignment (even if you're familiar with them) and his/her justification for assessing your work as not achieving those goals or performing the kind of work that it was expected to.  Hopefully, you'll get some insight into the goal-oriented writing process so that you can improve in the future by more clearly anticipating the audience's expectations for your argument."
Professors,31otsy,herennius,2,Tue Apr 7 01:21:13 2015 UTC,"Might you take it to the Writing Center at your school BEFORE you go to the prof.   Then you will get face-to-face feedback from a person, and that will have to be more helpful (you will have give & take).  And, ask the writing center people if you should go to the prof. They might point out that it is rough (and kynda a mess), or they might tell you that particular prof has not got their meds adjusted just right, so you might wait until they are in a better state of mind, or say ""you are right, this is good, talk to the prof"".  And, either way, you can say to the prof ""here is some of the feedback that I got from the writing center"", which can't hurt."

Professors,31otsy,coldgator,4,Wed Apr 15 19:19:55 2015 UTC,I wouldn't recommend typing out the comments. That's an unusual thing to do and may make it seem like you're trying to argue a point/document the comments instead of honestly looking for feedback.
Professors,31otsy,arrrrr_won,1 point,Tue Apr 7 00:19:34 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind: providing helpful and high-quality feedback is itself a skill, and even excellent writers are not necessarily good at crafting a critique. Certainly, I've thought ""this paper is a mess!"", but actually writing that down is unnecessary and distracting. Yet, in the string of reading paper after paper, some people will start penning their internal monologue, rather than directing the writer to the areas that need clarification/improvement/whatever.  Try not to let it discourage you. As others have said, identify any areas where you are still unclear as to what is wanted, and for those comments you can address, look through each and try to address the issue, starting with the general and moving to the specific. Good luck!"

Professors,31jcml,blindingspeed80,9,Mon Apr 6 00:22:01 2015 UTC,"But also much of the public funding seems to go toward supporting loans rather than to the school directly, so the argument that state funding is dropping remains correct/accurate rather than a fairy tale, as the author implies."
Professors,31ka0e,coldgator,7,Sun Apr 5 22:19:08 2015 UTC,"One thing I've done that works quite well is to apologize. Whether you did anything wrong or not humbling yourself and apologizing to people who think you did something wrong always works for me. They walk away feeling great. They may think that they can control you.  You walk away knowing that you solved the problem for yourself and that you are actually in greater control of the social relationship even if they have more administrative power. Others will make their own judgment about the right and wrong of the situation anyway, and you will look more mature and senior for taking this step. So if this senior faculty is offended, go speak with them and apologize for overstepping. It has to be done right without throwing anyone else under the bus or making excuses. Again this works for me but as with all politics YMMV."

You've clearly allied yourself with the chair, which might be a problem if the changes that the chair has instituted are not popular. There is a reason why people do not typically wade into department leadership and politics until they are post-tenure: changing things will invariably piss off people who have something invested in the status quo. If those people have some determination in whether or not you get tenure (and that isn't clear in your post), then you need to step back, apologize, and strive to be apolitical for now. This is especially true if your department doesn't typically invest much decision-making authority in pre-tenure faculty."

First of all, reviewing your notes for 20 minutes after each class will prevent you from forgetting a lot of what you just learned. Studying needs to be strategic, spaced out, and not last-minute. Set up regular times in your schedule for studying, as if studying was a job or class you had to go to. Don't just reread your notes--create practice exams for yourself and take them without looking at your notes. Then score them and do them again (all items, not just the ones you missed). This is not just an opinion, it's the science of how to study efficiently. I second the idea of visiting the university counseling center. They are very familiar with this type of issue and are probably cheap or free. Studying is probably harder for you now that you're having all this anxiety about it, so you can think of visiting the counseling center as a step towards more efficient studying!"

Professors,31en54,VetMichael,6,Sat Apr 4 10:19:19 2015 UTC,"I have had three different helicopter parents over the past seven years and my response evolved dramatically from the first to the third.  First parent, i tried to work with them, informing them, and keeping them ""in the loop"" regarding their special snowflake baby girl/boy. It was a complete disaster. The parent was in constant contact with me via email and phone calls to my office. The parent questioned every academic plan the student and I worked out. And, in the end, the parent made promises the student never fulfilled. The result was that the student failed his/her was through four majors before disappearing with a term's worth of financial aid student loans.  By the third one (less than a year ago), I explained to them that I cannot discuss their child's academic performance, goals, or my advising with them. The student is an adult and, since he/she is in college, is capable of making their own decisions in close consultation with education experts (me). Since all students receive grade assessments at the midterm, I am made aware of their performance in each class, especially if the student is performing poorly. This allows me to contact the student and adjust their learning expectations, advise them on a variety of aides and programs to help them succeed, and in general help them find their way in what may be a difficult class. If the parent would like to discuss these decisions with anyone, they should bring it up with the student as I am barred from discussing personal details with anyone other than the student.   It usually shuts them up and makes them go away."
Professors,31en54,amishius,5,Sat Apr 4 15:04:10 2015 UTC,"Yes to FERPA but also I think this speaks to the generally large problem that's going on in academia right now, namely that the degree is a commodity for which people are paying a lot and borrowing against their future earnings to finance. The education isn't the thing and therefore, like a car or other big ticket item, people expect it to just work. If you bought a new car, were making payments, and then transmission blew, you'd probably be pretty irate, right? That's how we've come to view degrees in this country. The process is useless and it's all about outcomes.  Your student is perfectly capable of making a decision but they aren't in college for themselves: they are in college for their parents and for their community. I think many students at the moment care a lot about their futures but could not care less about the process of getting to that future. They know they are out a lot of money and that the only thing anyone will ever look at is a diploma. Commodification."

After she had been missing for like 3 weeks, I asked the girl she sat next to if she knew why this person wasn't coming to class, and there was, of course, a horrible silence broken only by an audible gasp.  What I did in the moment was apologize profusely to everyone and tell them I had no idea, but it was horribly awkward, and I am super glad it happened at the end of class, not the beginning.  Admin eventually just removed the student from my class list, but no official person ever let me know what happened. I complained at length to my faculty union and suggested they needed a clear policy in place.  My suggestion is to keep pushing for some support and information. Make it clear the situation does affect you in the classroom. If you have a union or faculty association, go and get someone on your side."
Professors,31122b,Unicormfarts,9,Wed Apr 1 17:00:35 2015 UTC,"I'm a professor and also an expert in sexual assault. I regularly (though thankfully not all that frequently) have students disclose sexual assault because they know it's my area of expertise.   It is not appropriate to tell anyone else about her situation, even an adviser, without her permission. She may have asked for discretion. Many trauma victims just want normalcy and not to talk about it with everyone. The best thing you can do for her is treat her normally and with respect. If she wants/needs to talk to you, she will.  It may be hard to understand, but she needs to feel control right now. She needs to feel like she can trust people. She does not need people discussing her story or sharing it with faculty. She is probably feeling a great deal of shame and this is only exacerbated when people in power know about her situation and share it. For her, it is probably mortifying that any professors might know.  Remember this isn't about you - she has experienced real trauma and it should be about whatever she needs."

Of course, the situation is slightly different--I was assaulted by a student, but very few people that I worked with knew about the incident. I imagine that since my union rep has requested that I not have direct contact with anyone at the school (including administration, since that's who I initially reported it to) that some of my colleagues, including one person I co-teach with, are feeling totally left out of the loop.   Perhaps the lack of information was based on the incident itself, who the victim reported it to, school policy, etc. etc. It's also possible that since you were the assailant's academic adviser that they were waiting until further legal action had been taken to inform you of the incident. It does feel shady, and I would be upset if this happened to one of my students and I hadn't been informed...but I would probably just ask them directly if there was any legal reason that you were kept in the dark.   Honestly, and I apologize if this sounds cold, but I would just keep the class moving forward--if it comes up, you can be honest and let them know that you are aware of the incident, but can't discuss it in class for privacy reasons. I think that if you want to express to the victim that you only just found out about the incident, that might be okay, but I would frame it in terms of ""I'm sorry that you don't feel comfortable in my class; I am willing to do what I can to make sure that the course is accessible to you for the remainder of the semester as long as everyone is on the same page.""  Hope that helps. This has to be an incredibly taxing situation for everyone involved... no one prepares you for this kind of stuff when you become a teacher."
Professors,31122b,set_phrases_to_stun,2,Wed Apr 1 16:23:09 2015 UTC,"Not a sexual assault case, but a sexual harassment case--and some of the harassment occurred in my classroom during class time!!! I unfortunately was unaware of it, because I (wrongly) assumed the two students involved were on friendly terms, and that was why they were whispering in class.   When the victim finally told me what had been going on for several weeks, I was appalled. I could not understand why she hadn't told me in the first place. I mean, if the unwelcome behavior is occurring in my classroom while I am there, you would think the student would want to let me know...but apparently she felt too timid.  I immediately reported the behavior to our Student Services department. When I spoke with them, they told me they were already aware of the situation, because the victim had told her RA, who told them. I felt indignant that they hadn't told me anything, especially since this involved a situation in my classroom.   I still wish somebody (preferably the victim) would have told me sooner, but I think I understand why administration would not want to inform me. For these sensitive kinds of situations, I think admin is doing their best to keep the situation contained to protect the victim (and maybe also to protect themselves).  It doesn't feel right not to know, and maybe it isn't right. But from a legal and professional perspective, I think admin sees it as how things need to be done. Even though the students are in our classrooms, we are technically completely uninvolved in the matter at hand.   I spoke with the victim again after our initial conversation, and offered to be a third party witness for her if she wanted to confront the aggressor to tell him to back off. However, she chose to change seats in the classroom instead. It wasn't the outcome I hoped for, but I have to respect her wishes.   What happened to your student is horrible, and I am so sorry. I know that my situation is not nearly as extreme as yours, so I understand if you think it doesn't apply to your situation.   Like someone else said, you can talk to administration and just ask why you weren't informed. When I asked, I phrased it as something like, ""What do you think I should do to help this student?"" As for the student, she probably doesn't want people at school to know. If she tells you about the incident, or if she is aware that you know about it, talk to her directly and ask what you can do to help.   Hope it works out for you and your class. Sorry you have to go through something like this. Teaching can be rough."

It could be helpful to revise your rubric for the next class you teach and giving students access to it beforehand.  Alternatively, some instructors have students help develop the rubric (partially or fully) so that they're more invested in what's being evaluated and how."
Professors,30i7zn,herennius,8,Fri Mar 27 16:39:18 2015 UTC,"I like the idea of getting students involved.   I teach in the quantitative sciences, so it's more problem-solving (and less essay-writing). In my first tutorial of the year, I run a little game with the students: I give them two (anonymized) student answers to a question from a previous exam and let them ""play TA"". I simply tell them to grade the answers out of 10 points, however they wish.   The key to making this work is to carefully choose the two samples. One is absolutely awful - it's clear the student has no idea what to do and not much has been written down. The second looks awful: bad handwriting, disjointed calculations scribbled all over the place, etc. Both samples have an incorrect final answer, but the second sample, despite its terrible appearance, is actually quite close to being right (the student has made one tiny technical error in one of their equations, but it is difficult to spot because of the mess).   Every year, the students give both failing (or close to failing) grades. It's only when I point out that the second student made only one small error that they realize how important other factors were in developing their own rubric (like, being able to follow along with the solution steps).   Needless to say, it's a very eye-opening exercise for most first-year students. At the very least, it makes them appreciate how much work grading can be!"
Professors,30i7zn,SingletOxygen,2,Fri Mar 27 20:13:25 2015 UTC,That's brilliant. I'm going to think about how I might be able to adapt this to my essay courses.
Professors,30i7zn,esDragon,8,Sat Mar 28 03:57:53 2015 UTC,"Came here to say this. Unless your grade is entirely based on Scantron results (yes/no binaries) there is going to be some element of subjectivity in your assessment of the grade. Young students these days are not used to that sort of educational environment; they're products of No Child Left Behind and high-stakes standardized testing, as well as classes where heavy student loads and disempowered teachers results in complex content being avoided (except perhaps AP courses). My personal philosophy is that students will need to discard those old notions sooner or later, so my class is a perfect place to start. I try to limit subjectivity, but since I teach composition, there's only so much I can do."
Professors,30i7zn,HawaiianBrian,7,Fri Mar 27 18:01:31 2015 UTC,"Marking written work IS subjective - it's just not arbitrary. I tried to think what I would do in this situation:  ""Ok, so it looks like a lot of people think my rubric was confusing. Can someone please be more specific? Given an example of what is confusing.""  If they find something, explain how and when you covered that. Because you did.  But they probably won't, because the true problem is that they lack metacognitive skills. You should tell them that. ""Imagine you're in a dance competition on an alien planet. The aliens have described in excruciating detail what is involved in the dance you need to do - your limbs can't be touching the ground at any point, and your butt needs to be fluidly rotating while you gently spin around on the floor. When you're arms are lower than your legs, you need to being looking rightward, but only for one second, etc. etc. You think you understand, and you think you're doing what they're doing, but the aliens disagree. It's a subjective evaluation, but it's not arbitrary. The aliens are very familiar with this dance, and you've never seen it before, let alone done it before, so you suck. But you're so unfamiliar with the dance, you don't even know you suck.""  The truth is, students don't have the writing skills necessary to recognize why and how they are poor writers, so they think they are good writers. But they are so inexperienced, they can't possibly be good writers.  Educators are the aliens - we have enough experience to tell who is doing the dance well, and who is doing it poorly. The instructions seem vague because students don't have the tools to understand how all these pieces fit together, which is why you are creating opportunities for them to practice.   My guess is that your rubric is fine, but students are suffering from the Dunning-Kruger Effect. Here is another exercise: ask students if they agree that the average student is around 70%. If they agree, ask them how many think their assignment was above average? (all of them) And how many of them think they scored lower than they should have? (most of them) If you do this in an anonymous survey, you can present the data in class.   All of those things can't be true. Statistically, half of the students will be below average (that's the very definition of the average). If the average actually turned out to be around 70%, then it's statistically impossible for most people to have scored lower than they should have.   It's shite metacognition, folks. Accept it, and improve."
Professors,30i7zn,kellyellyellable,0,Fri Mar 27 20:47:27 2015 UTC,"True, but the majority of the population can't be above average, and the average I'm talking about is the population average.   Assuming the class is large enough, it would probably to be normally distributed. But I suppose that is my own biased thinking - I'm always teaching classes large enough that I can assume a normal distribution."
Professors,30i7zn,kellyellyellable,2,Fri Mar 27 20:57:28 2015 UTC,There is no good pedagogical reason to assume any prior distribution of grades.
Professors,30i7zn,bubbleberry1,0,Fri Mar 27 21:08:44 2015 UTC,"Nope, just a statistical one.  Most variables that can vary continuously in the population do so in a normal distribution, where x = mean, and divides the population in half (50% below, 50% above). A large enough sample from a non-normal distribution will also be normally distributed. It's just how statistics work.  So if you consider the George Carlin quote, ""think of how stupid the average person is, and realize half of them are stupider than that"" is completely accurate."
Professors,30i7zn,kellyellyellable,6,Fri Mar 27 23:56:21 2015 UTC,"Sorry but no. That is just a preposterous statement. No, most variables are not normally distributed. Where did you get that notion? Just off the top of my head,  here are some social variables that are not normally distributed:  age, income, wealth, educational attainment, occupational prestige, popularity or fame... Should I go on? Even in the natural world it is wrong to assume variables are normally distributed. That is why we have many different types of distributions (eg,  binomial, exponential)  instead of assuming that one size fits all.   You are also wrong about a sample being normally distributed. It is not the sample but the sampling distribution of the mean that is normally distributed. That's actually how statistics works. By the way, I teach statistics.   The mean is not always the middle of the distribution,  so no that is not completely accurate. Carlin is using average to refer to the median, but only sometimes is the mean equal to the median.   Even if some variables are normally distributed that doesn't mean that another variable should be normally distributed. This is just wrongheaded thinking.  This whole discussion is about grade distributions. Since grades are a valuable resource perhaps we should impose a distribution that resembles how other valuable things are distributed in society such as income,  which as I mentioned is definitely not normally distributed. By imposing this a priori on our grades,  we should be giving most students a F and only one or two students an A in any class. That makes as much sense as assuming that grades should be normally distributed.   There is actually an interesting history of the normal distribution and how it comes out of biology, where the mean is thought to represent the natural essence of a biological trait and deviations (errors) from the mean were thought to represent sub optimal environmental conditions. Eliot Sober has a good discussion of this in his article ""Population Thinking""  (on mobile, can't find Pdf at the moment)   Now I'm not saying that normal distributions do not exist or aren't important to study. In particular non biased measurement error can be approximately normal under many circumstances. But it is just wrong to think that everything's normal, and even more wrong to assume that things should be normally distributed. That is imposing a normative judgment based on statistical presuppositions instead of a comprehensive theoretical understanding of the phenomenon being studied."
Professors,30i7zn,bubbleberry1,9,Mon Mar 30 13:33:50 2015 UTC,"It sounds like the student in question was rankled by a grade lower than he was accustomed to. It also sounds like your conversation after class resolved this, and that the student tried to smooth over his challenging behavior - I'd let that part go.  It may matter what course/assignment are in question here. Generally speaking, I try to construct my assignment guidelines (first-year composition) on two levels: explicit detail for the rare student who actually reads the entire document, and within that I bold a few words that relay the core requirements of the assignment for the skimmers. When I assess and offer feedback, I make sure I stick to those bold points - that covers 99% of my grading situations and I don't seem to get much push back.  I combine that with ample opportunity to discuss the assignment both in-class or individually before it is due and I feel like I cover my bases well. Your moment of rabble rabble! may have been a few students hoping to capitalize on a moment of doubt."
Professors,30i7zn,CrexisNX,5,Mon Mar 30 15:07:03 2015 UTC,"I tell students at the start of the year that if they want to talk to me about grading, they need to submit a written justification of at least a couple of paragraphs by email. It needs to specify exactly why they believe that the grade they receive is unfair, and they need to provide a convincing argument with specific facts and examples from the text to back it up.   This has several upshots.   First, it cuts down on the number of random opportunistic complaints significantly.   Second, it makes the student really think through their own assignment rather than just coming to me and pointing at paragraph after paragraph asking ""Couldn't you give me an extra half grade here? Well then, what about here?""   Third, it gives me time to reflect on how to respond so I'm not put on the spot.   Fourth, it takes it outside of the classroom so that students don't fall into the mass hysteria they are susceptible to (given the pack of rabid dogs that they can become).   I've never had a student question my rubric, and if they did I'd tell them that I grade comparatively -- the rubric I use is one I develop after reading everyone's work; if they want to ace the assignment or essay, the best they can do is (a) work harder and smarter than the majority of their peer (which is usually not difficult for those who are already motivated to excel) and (b) check with me before the work is due so I can give them feedback specific to their own learning style and skill set."
Professors,30i7zn,esDragon,4,Fri Mar 27 17:01:49 2015 UTC,"Agreed on all points.  A few other benefits of limiting grading discussions to email:   It creates a paper trail which gives the instructor the ability to (a) compare a student's earlier claims with his/her more recent claims, and (b) document that the instructor was nothing but professional during the interaction, thereby protecting the instructor in case the student escalates and appeals to the dept chair.  It allows an instructor to keep a text file of common responses to common complaints. I'd much rather paste something into an email response than spend time hearing out this student's passionate description about how he has a 3.9 GPA and if she gets a B in this course she's going to lose her scholarship and how he totally worked hard to study for the exam."
Professors,30i7zn,zombie_dbaseIV,3,Sat Mar 28 03:56:36 2015 UTC,"I agree the rubric has to be available at the start. Also, have some coworkers take a look at it to see if it appropriate for the assignment. Reading a paper is going to be subjective, but a good rubric can help alleviate some of the potential problems. Whenever someone wants to discuss a grade or challenge a grade make sure you do it in private. I know some profs who have gotten in trouble mentioning a grade in front of others. Also, be willing to change if the student makes a valid argument, but make sure it's applied equally to everyone."

Professors,30i7zn,nomadofthehills,2,Fri Mar 27 19:20:42 2015 UTC,I think students need to learn that they will be judged subjectively for the rest of their lives. Every job they hold will be evaluated by someone with their own set of values about what should or should not be evaluated.  Fairness is not about subjectivity or objectivity. Fairness is about treating all students the same. It's about measurement reliability. If two students turned in exactly the same essay they should get the same results theoretically (not including any issues with cheating or copying of course).  Students need to learn the reality of this world that at some point they are going to be evaluated subjectively. The point is that you or their future evaluator is an expert or accomplished in the field.
Professors,30i7zn,ProfAbroad,1 point,Sat Mar 28 02:02:10 2015 UTC,"When I give back papers, I tell the students that if they are not happy with their grade, they should look at the papers of two or three students (who have done outstanding work) and compare their paper to the great papers. I ask the best students if they would show their papers to other students and they say they would.  I also allow students who have an F to rewrite their papers to reflect the directions in the syllabus as well as the rubric.  This works well for me."
Professors,30i7zn,Allergic_to_Grains,1 point,Sat Mar 28 03:56:40 2015 UTC,"I am almost always surprised when students dare question a grade given to them. In law school most profs either   A) maintain a super simple metric (50%recitations + 50% score in the written exams) grade a recitation on the spot and have their student assistants upload it by the end of every midterm/ final. So there's no chance to contest since its routinely uploaded   B) Recheck the paper by writing every instance why the answer is wrong, and even some would mark it lower than the original grade   And C) they remind the student that if they really deserved that grade they wouldn't be in that position in the first place"

The teaching load at a CC (I'm guessing) is pretty high, which will make it difficult to write and publish. However, adjuncts are also often overworked, so I'm not sure how it compares.

Professors,302p6h,Poobiedog,1 point,Tue Mar 24 02:29:16 2015 UTC,"I know that some community college professors are able to publish still. It's a very different process though - there isn't a lot of money available and there's not a big emphasis churning out work and so most of the published work I've seen come out of community colleges is about theory of education, studies on students/student outcomes, etc. There isn't a lot of field-specific research, but it is possible."

Professors,302p6h,slowlyslipping,5,Wed Mar 25 11:46:11 2015 UTC,"The answer is probably field dependent but in my field (a physical science) I would say yes it would hurt your chances in a tenure track job search at a research oriented school because recent research record and promise of future research is the most important component in those hiring decisions. A research oriented postdoc would be better. But, if you are interested in TT jobs at SLACs, CC teaching may help your chances."

Faculty definitely want to see signs of good teaching.   What will hurt is each year that you are out of grad school and not in a TT position, because the great teaching experience you are gaining will not come close to outweighing a lack of scholarship. What that means is that you should probably spend most of your time at a CC producing research, even if that unfortunately means letting some of the teaching slide, though not enough to generate bad reviews. This is definitely not an ideal, but I think it is realistic."

The top schools won't care and may even wonder why you couldn't do better than a CC. I am not saying I agree!  If you really want a full time, tenure track position, find a good mentor to help you get to a school with which you'd be happy. It's all political and highly competitive these days.

Second, as much as your work time allows be available to answer questions and help students. Students often spend a lot of time asking questions to TA more than the professor.  Finally, if your professor agrees to pay you for it, ask if you can organize a review session before he final exam. Just ask students to bring their questions and help them answer them. It's good experience for you and he student will be grateful. One important note is that you should NOT look at the exam before you do this session so you are not tempted to act unethically."

Professors,2zxx4w,GhotiStyx,1 point,Sun Mar 22 21:40:20 2015 UTC,"Fully.  The book assigned is poorly written (even our professor has admitted this on multiple occasions), and online forums are not always helpful."
Professors,2zxx4w,GhotiStyx,30,Sun Mar 22 21:46:30 2015 UTC,Then it is perfectly reasonable for him/her to hold students accountable for information in the reading.  To expect all topics covered be dealt with in 3 hrs of class per week underestimates how much material a course should actually cover.  The point of college is that you learn how to learn and teach yourself: the professor is just a tour guide of the more interesting and relevant parts.
Professors,2zxx4w,naruhina84,10,Sun Mar 22 21:53:27 2015 UTC,"If the textbook isn't very good, then you will have to locate some better sources.  It is more than likely not the only textbook that has been written on the subject, meaning there may be textbooks in the library covering that material.  Look at what the book is covering and then find that same topic covered better somewhere else.  The librarians can help you find sources if you are having difficulty doing so.  Your school should subscribe to online research databases that will have a variety of digital sources, ranging from encyclopedia articles to scholarly books and articles."
Professors,2zxx4w,pentad67,8,Mon Mar 23 00:04:43 2015 UTC,"When material in the reading is unclear to you, you should definitely ask the professor. Just because he is not going over it in class does not mean that he is unwilling to answer a question from a student who has put in some effort to understand it. If he can't answer fully in class, then go to office hours and ask there. Like /u/GhotiStyx says, the professor is there to help, like a tour guide, and will usually go out of his way to explain things to you, but ultimately you are responsible for learning the material. If you don't use the professor as a resource, that's your lack of initiative and only affects you. It doesn't affect the professor."
Professors,2zxx4w,sunflowerfly,18,Mon Mar 23 00:26:43 2015 UTC,"Yes. I do it on purpose, and tell the students to expect it. I cover major concepts in class, no need to cover minor points or definitions."
Professors,2zxx4w,mrfurious,13,Sun Mar 22 22:18:44 2015 UTC,"It used to be the norm for the material covered in lectures to be just the tip of the iceberg, and both exams and homework required knowledge gained from the reading, or even library reading. But current standards probably require a balance, based on what students are expected to do in other courses. If lectures are only tangentially related to homework and exams, that's unreasonable. If they touch on a subset of the knowledge required to do homework and exams and there isn't enough time to cover all of it, that's probably reasonable. However, it would be unreasonable for the professor to refuse to help on the homework in office hours or over email. So you should try that!"
Professors,2zxx4w,Rtalbert235,14,Sun Mar 22 22:31:48 2015 UTC,"Yes, because homework is not there just to rehearse what you discuss in class but also to develop ideas further, or explore new related ideas. Not only reasonable but good pedagogical practice."
Professors,2zxx4w,Deradius,14,Sun Mar 22 23:56:39 2015 UTC,The fact that you even have to ask this question strongly suggests that you and many others are woefully underprepared for college.  This wouldn't be so bad were it not for the fact that professors are also woefully underprepared for you.  I think we are seeing the result of the continuing trend of grade inflation now...  People aren't even aware that being asked to learn material that didn't come out of the professor's mouth is appropriate.  Some of my high school teachers would have been aghast had I asked something like this.
Professors,2zxx4w,deltalitprof,6,Mon Mar 23 04:21:14 2015 UTC,I just gave a midterm in which students were required to explore themes I have not discussed in class in reading material that I have discussed in class. This is not unusual for me to do.

I will say that every quote from that student paints him as a self-aggrandizing, obnoxious asshole looking to stir up controversy for the sake of controversy.   Many of the points mentioned in the article are completely valid topics of discussion. Whether they were appropriate for the specific discussion at hand and whether he expressed these points in a calm, non-inflammatory manner (not demonstrated in any of the quotes from him) is far more important in determining whether his contribution to discussion was appropriate or just cause for the multiple warnings he received before being removed from the discussions.  Edit: upon request for an interview, he responded    Before I interview with you, you must agree to make ""nigger"" be the first word in your article.   According to reason.com  http://reason.com/blog/2015/03/19/male-students-non-pc-views-on-rape-stati  If that is true (and I assume the student would have raised hell if it wasn't), then there is little doubt in my mind that he behaved inappropriately in class and is trying to wrap it in the flag.  Edit 2: in his own petition, he quotes the professor's email, which mentions that other students were made uncomfortable by his comments outside of class as well as on Facebook, as well as during discussion. In his own response, he completely minimizes the psychological damage non-penetrative forced sexual contact can create. He also suggests that women don't fear victim-blaming when reporting these types of assaults. He ended by saying ""see you in conference"" which, though not relevant to the sexual assault discussion, is a completely dickish move.  The statistics often quoted are flawed. For this giant clusterfuck to have happened, he had to have done more than bring up the errors in those statistics as part of a professional discussion. The entire petition paints a picture of a well-educated, intelligent young man who is choosing to raise hell over his own mistake by wrapping it in the flag and playing the martyr.  https://www.change.org/p/reed-college-restore-jeremiah-josias-luther-george-true-to-his-humanities-110-conference-2  Read for yourself and form your own opinion.  Edit 3: holy fuck.   According to Savery, True had made other unsettling contributions to the conference this semester, including a comment about Theocritus that “lower class people didn’t have the ability to create art” and a comment about how “we shouldn’t blame the people who were responsible for the Holocaust… because they didn’t know any better.” Maude-Griffin says that True’s behavior started out only “a little bit patronizing” and then escalated from there over the course of the semester. “As soon as we started discussing Aristotle he said how did not believe that people who were drunk could not be held responsible for their actions, and similarly (in his line of logic), that racists could not be blamed for their actions because they had ‘never been taught otherwise,’” Maude-Griffin recalls. The week after True’s Theocritus comment about social class and artistic capability, Maude-Griffin says that True “began the class abruptly and loudly in an angry tone, reading the Honor Principle stating how no student should face a hostile environment, and demanding an apology of only female members of the class despite the equally strong reaction by the male ones.”  In a statement about his own character, True says, “I believe that I am an emotionally capable, intellectually gifted, cutting wit, hell of a person. I believe I have experienced more trauma and suffering and pain in my life than many of these, well frankly, middle class white girls at Reed could ever know in their lives.”   Both from http://www.mediaite.com/online/this-story-about-reed-college-kid-banned-for-challenging-rape-stats-just-got-really-weird/  I started this out by saying we couldn't know without having been there. The more research I do, the more convinced I am that there isn't a grey area here. Everything this kid has said, both quoted by others and posted by him is combative and stubborn to the point of willful ignorance. Damn."

For example, saying that people who hold oppressive views and grew up in a culture that propagated these views shouldn't be blamed isn't a super outlandish opinion. Not taking into account the distress of what he may term ""not real rape"" shouldn't be grounds for banning in and of itself either.   But, as you say, it's probable that he was just upset at the liberal environment of Reed and started trying to provoke other students. It's also possible that he got super offended his perceived censorship and his anger about the supposed injustice caused him to lash out.  ETA: I didn't notice this is from 3 weeks ago..."
Professors,2zt4rv,BrachiumPontis,2,Thu Apr 2 16:56:20 2015 UTC,"I agree that a calm discussion about the difference between rape and sexual harassment, though it might have made people slightly uncomfortable, shouldn't warrant what happened.

Professors,2zt4rv,VetMichael,6,Thu Apr 2 18:51:49 2015 UTC,"As a facilitator in some oft-times contentious discussions (I once had to call a break to a seminar in which an Israeli-exchange student and a Palestinian-American got into it during a class on the Modern Middle East, for example) I had two or three thoughts here:  First, there is no direct mention of the particular incident which led to the ban. What did he say or do in class that is not reported in the article? It doesn't seem to revolve around discussions of logic vs. emotion, so what is it?  Second, the discussions can suddenly spiral out of control with emotions running high suddenly (see my example above) and it is important to know if the professor spoke to the student first and then sought a way of moving forward before 'banning' the student. If this is a pattern of just-below-the-surface hostility, then the professor was well and truly justified. If it was an out-of-left-field comment, then perhaps the professor over-reacted. We just don't know all the facts.  Finally, this is not about repressing ""free speech"" at all. The student was not removed from the class, he wasn't kicked out of the college, he didn't have his grade lowered, and indeed will be allowed to complete the course with one-on-one discussions with the professor; I think the cries of the college prepressing this student's ""freedom of speech"" are logically fallacious at best or maybe a way to shut down real dialogue. Just because you have the right to say what you want (i.e. free speech) doesn't mean that someone can't preclude you from a group, a discussion, or a debate. That's their right of free association. No law was passed saying ""you can't discuss rape in such-and-such a way,"" so his free speech was not infringed. To borrow a phrase from the Big Lebowski meme ""You're not wrong, man, you're just an asshole"" - which seems appropriate here, since he styles himself as a person who studies ""How to annoy people"" and refers to others who don't share his beliefs as ""sheep."""
Professors,2zt4rv,VetMichael,3,Sat Mar 21 20:03:10 2015 UTC,"It seems like the problem is with his attitude. The original article notes that his peers engaged his comments in an intellectually responsible fashion in class.

The only reason I'd kick someone out of a discussion would be from either being rude or disruptive. Having an unpopular opinion/argument isn't rude.

The thought I continue having, though, is that this faculty member was supposed to be facilitating conversation.  He should never have allowed the rhetoric to descend to a level where people felt uncomfortable.  With the limited information that everybody seems to agree on, it appears that a weak-willed faculty member allowed a discussion-based course to get away from him, and it descended to such toxic levels that the only remedy left was to exclude a student (who may well have been a negative presence in the discussion)."

Reed deserves to be trolled, and True likely deserves the banhammer like any other troll.  Personally I wouldn't kick him out of class for writing papers taking offensive positions. But if he was actively disruptive in class even after being talked to, then yes."
Professors,2zt4rv,simoncolumbus,3,Sun Mar 22 03:22:20 2015 UTC,"I don't agree that Reed deserves to be trolled. Do the students deserve to have this guy pushing all their buttons just because he can? Freedom of speech doesn't (or rather shouldn't) mean the right to make others feel unsafe.   I do agree that I'd remove him from the class. If anyone acted like this in my class, I'd do what I could to get them off the roster entirely. I'm a little surprised the prof let him stay in the class."
Professors,2zt4rv,GhotiStyx,1 point,Sun Mar 22 05:13:03 2015 UTC,"I don't agree that Reed deserves to be trolled.   You need to spend more time with Reed students/alumni.  And yes, people do need to have their uncritically held views challenged in college—college shouldn't be preaching to the choir.  Unless he was engaging in explicit threats or personal attacks, free speech doesn't make for an unsafe environment.  But classrooms do not need to cater to a disruptive asshole.  Being contrarian and provocative is one thing; being disruptive to the point of undermining the ability of the professor to teach the course material is another."

Professors,2zjzos,specter3s,3,Thu Mar 19 04:58:37 2015 UTC,"My understanding is that AWP is indeed mostly for creative and literary writing teachers and programs. It won't be useful for getting a handle on how the Composition field works.  If you are teaching English Comp, or FYC, I think you really should spend time getting familiar with the Comp field (which would mean NCTE's journals).    I'm a little bit confused on why you're saying the NCTE's journals haven't been helpful to you. There are a bunch of journals the NCTE publishes, and they've been publishing them for decades.  You'll get access to all of that as a member, and you probably already have access to all of these journals through your institution.  Also, the CCC Conference (sometimes just called the ""4 Cs"") is sort of the biggest annual event in the entire field of Composition (and is going on right now actually), so that's really one of the cornerstones of the comp field.  Maybe I'm misunderstanding your question? What kinds of things are you HOPING or EXPECTING to find in the NCTE's journals?  I can point you to some articles you might find interesting... in the 1990s, there were a bunch of things published and talked about regarding the debate over teaching and reading fiction/literature in FYC for example.  All of that said, if you actually do want to enter the creative writing side of things, there's no harm in being part of BOTH the NCTE and AWP.  You should feed your interests and passions and pursue the career that you want.  But to answer what I think is your basic question: no, I don't think AWP will be very helpful in navigating the scholarship or entering the composition field itself."

Professors,2ynbij,bitchwithacapital_C,7,Wed Mar 11 04:59:29 2015 UTC,"This is what is meant by ""academic freedom."" A prof can design a class how they see fit. Sometimes the bias is more obvious, such as in your example. Other times professors will cut out material (say completely skip certain chapters out of the textbook) because they don't think their expertise is strong enough to teach or they don't like to teach it. Tenured faculty at bigger universities (where research is more valued) will likely just teach however they want since they have job security already."
Professors,2ynbij,kairoschris,3,Wed Mar 11 08:56:56 2015 UTC,"I completely understand professors avoiding certain topics if they'd rather leave them to someone else. I'm all for academic freedom, but I feel like in courses where you're supposed to cover a broad range of topics, such narrowness defeats the purpose of survey courses."
Professors,2ynbij,FGF10,-1,Wed Mar 11 13:01:50 2015 UTC,"You're clearly not ""all for academic freedom"" since you seem to think you know how to design a course curriculum and how to execute that plan better than an educated scholar...  For the record, unless you have designed a curriculum, you have no idea what the purpose of the course in that curriculum actually is. Courses in the curriculum of a major are puzzle pieces. The purpose they serve in the program may not be what you, as a non-designer of that curriculum, assume them to be."
Professors,2ynbij,FGF10,2,Mon Mar 16 04:49:07 2015 UTC,"Shouldn't the syllabus and course description detail what exactly the course is over, especially if half the course covers a specific topic?   The last time I checked I was under the impression that students didn't go to college to attend thrilling lectures derived from professorial bias. Students attend colleges theoretically to be educated. It logically follows that when selecting courses, especially courses that involve a broad topic, a student should be able to reasonably rely that the topic will be discussed in depth. Macroeconomics vs Applied Economics. Southern Lit vs Tennessee Williams. Chemistry vs Organic Chemistry. Criminal procedure vs evidence.   What you are suggesting by ""academic freedom"" is a zero accountability system in which professors can choose to teach how and what they want without a nod given to the needs of the students. That's what the reasearch aspect involves: deepening of a speciality."
Professors,2ynbij,FGF10,5,Mon Mar 16 16:12:40 2015 UTC,"I'm not trying to be shady, but it seems like you've asked this question (and have replied to responses) in such a way that you want us to confirm your own belief that your professors are teaching incorrectly by providing a deeper understanding of selected topics rather than superficial overviews of entire disciplines.  Perhaps by focusing on Tennessee Williams, your Southern American lit. professor was trying to show you how to critique an author's entire oeuvre instead of just the highlight reel.  Maybe your geology professor was trying to sell the graduate school experience by explaining how his experience at CalTech shaped his teaching philosophy (or maybe he's a name-dropping douche who is an ineffective teacher because of conceit rather than his insistence on teaching selected topics).    I agree with the other comments on this thread...the whole point of academic freedom is that no two sections of a course will be the same because each faculty member's perspective on the field is different.  I teach biology.  My background is in cell and molecular biology, and my colleague's is nutritional biology.  We both teach an intro. course for majors.  I teach only the basics of metabolism, but I really drill them on molecular biology of the cell.  He flips it.  Both classes get a nice overview of biology...and better yet?  They learn how to ask and answer questions relevant to their future work.  The kids that miss out on metabolism in my class learn enough about scientific inquiry to look it up and learn it for themselves should metabolism be an important part of their future interests."
Professors,2ynbij,BewareTheSphere,-1,Wed Mar 11 22:19:24 2015 UTC,"I feel like in hard sciences it's a little more helpful when professors divide topics like that. No one class can cover everything about a topic. My complaint about my geology professor wasn't necessarily is Cal Tech experiences but how everything related back to Karst. ""Slightly acidic rainwater dissolves calcite in the limestone which creates holes ect.""   I think that a lot can be learned from anecdotes about personal experience, especially in less theoretical classes. I took a Utopian/Dystopian literature class, English 4950 it was, and the professor himself planned the syllabus and selected the works. Everything was on topic. The texts were balanced in both authorship and time period. He taught what he wanted to and very effectively.   I had some truly amazing professors. In a Shakespeare course I expect Shakespeare, naturally. My second British Literature course covered the 17th century forward. My professor was a Percy Shelley scholar. When we covered the two Shelley selections we had we discussed them in immense detail, surely like you discuss inquiry, and then moved on.   In my examples, there's a treasury of southern lit from the 1650s till now. We read authors from 1920-1960, with Tennessee Williams taking up half the semester and consuming our final paper. We spent the first week discussing the characteristics of southern lit and the 3/4 worshipping Williams. The professor simply wanted to cover him."
Professors,2ynbij,FGF10,2,Wed Mar 11 22:50:17 2015 UTC,"I think you make valid points.  It seems like you're a lit. major.  I have a degree in lit. as well...so I'm totally aware of how strong biases can appear in upper division lit. classes.  My Victorian lit. professor also taught a children's lit. class and had a minor obsession with Harry Potter, and would shoehorn it into many of our discussions of Victorian poetry.  It was very jarring.    Do you think you would have benefited more, though, in your Southern lit. course if your professor had opted to focus less on a single author and devote a week to, say, Simms?  Or more antebellum literature?  You seem to be aware of this literature, and that you missed it.  You have seen your professor (ostensibly a Southern Gothic scholar) dissect the work of a noted author.  You have context for and understanding of the unique timbre of Southern American literature.  Could you not simply research the topic yourself to gain a better understanding?  This sounds to me like it was a 3000- or 4000-level class.  If this professor was, in fact, an expert in Southern Gothic...wouldn't you prefer to hear everything he/she had to say about the author with whom he/she was most familiar?    As a biologist, if I could talk to Dr. Francis Crick about science...I wouldn't want to hear him give a generalized lecture about biology.  I would want to hear him talk about something he knew very well and for which he felt great affection.  I can see how at the undergraduate level this subjective focusing on particular topics might make you feel as if you were missing out on something; but the most memorable professors I had are those who taught me how to learn, instead of specific information about a specific topic.  But that's a totally subjective point as well, I suppose."
Professors,2ynbij,simoncolumbus,-1,Wed Mar 11 23:04:53 2015 UTC,"Well, how our English program worked, and I'm not sure if this is a universal system, required a course in American Lit, 2 Brit Lit, Lit Criticism. After that, you had to take electives in each subject. The  you had to pick four miscellaneous English electives plus a grammar. There were not many electives offered in American Lit. We had 2 Southern Lit scholars, both of whom were the only American Lit professors, who taught Southern Lit. One essentially followed chronologically the development of Southern Lit. Mine loved Williams. Periodically, a Tennessee Williams elective was added, but it wasn't offered every semester.   My professor very well may have been the preeminent Williams scholar. He was friends with the family. He wrote hundreds of articles and even a few books on the subject. But, we read a slew of short stories and even watched a few short films, but there wasnt great depth. Because a professor likes a subject doesn't make it worthwhile to a class taking a survey elective.   As I stated earlier my school offered specific electives, Shakespeare, Williams, Byron, ect. A romantics course shouldn't focus solely on Byron, but a class devoted to Byron should. If my professor wanted to go in depth he should've organized the course as to demonstrate Willaims place in Southern Lit but not make an excuse to discuss him.  I would also add that if the professor you mentioned were to teach a course and focus on one subject, the class could built around the subject. Whereas my professor gave us a syllabus for a Southern Lit course that was Tennessee Williams heavy and then spent 2.5 months on the subject."
Professors,2ynbij,at1stsite,3,Thu Mar 12 01:27:44 2015 UTC,"""A romantics course shouldn't focus solely on Byron, but a class devoted to Byron should.""   You state this as if there is a tablet with this chiseled across its surface somewhere.  I think the point that many of us are trying to make is that there are myriad approaches to assembling a course.  No one pedagogy reigns supreme over the others.  If your professor covered Tennessee Williams for half of your Southern lit. course, and did so poorly...then it's the ""poorly"" part that is most troubling."
Professors,2ynbij,BewareTheSphere,0,Thu Mar 12 02:23:39 2015 UTC,"My main concern is that if a class is designated broadly then the class should be conducted broadly. If the class is designated narrowly, it should be conducted narrowly. If a math professor teaches a class called Special Operations of Numbers and covers complex polar coordinates and high faluting calculus concepts that seems fair to me. If the same professor were to teach Opertions of Imaginary Numbers and spend half the class relating Euler's Law to i, I think there would be an issue.  Covering a special topic in greater detail is not an issue, but building a class around a single topic in a course defined as a survey course. Having my professor teach Williams in the depth that he did presupposes that Williams is not only the most pertinent Southern Author but also the most important for teaching the details about Southern Lit. The same amount of time could have been spent on O'Connor or even better so on finding the best illustrations of certain concepts in individual works.   In the Lit Crit course I mentioned, we were taught how to criticize but were then expected to criticize based on a specific ideology (primary second wave Feminism).   As I stated before a class on Williams should be all Williams. Should a class on Impressionism be centered on Monet, using the artists around Monet merely as a frame? A student would be better served havin a wide breadth of instruction on specifics of the genre."
Professors,2ymm78,Congleton_Sandback,13,Wed Mar 11 01:15:13 2015 UTC,"I have a different approach to this. I think that the students deserve to be able to review their exams whenever and for however long they want... So I just give them back permanently. Sure, some will share exams next semester, but I just tweak the questions a little to mess up anyone who tries to study off an old exam.  I believe that exams count as a large portion of a student's grade and I don't think that it is fair to make any part of their grade a black box. The exam represents the results of their hard work and they deserve to know how they performed. That's just my opinion though and in my defense, I'm relatively new to the teaching game.  To deal with time constraints I hand back the exams and go over the biggest problem questions in class. Then, I tell the students to discuss any individual questions with ,e during office hours. That sets a firm time limit and I've never had anyone take more than a few minutes."

However, your policy could be that if he wants a regrade, he doesn't get to pick and choose which questions you regrade: You will give an entire regrade and his score may be higher or lower than the initial grade because you will go over everything with a fine tooth comb to make sure it is 200% accurate, because you already went through it once and made sure it was 100% accurate.

Tell him you're willing to go over in detail the top 3-5 (or whatever amount you have time for) questions he felt he had the most trouble with.   Or, if the answers can be found in a textbook, you can suggest he refer to relevant parts of it first to see if he can find out what he did wrong before he comes and talks to you.  Or, you can simply set a time limit and be firm. He can have your undivided attention for no more than 30 minutes. After time is up, that's it, the discussion is over. This would allow him to set his own priorities for the meeting.  Or, is there a tutoring center on campus that could help with this? I teach at one at my university, and I often help students figure out professors' feedback.  Good luck. These kinds of students can be difficult."

Professors,2ymm78,AStudyInScarlet,2,Wed Mar 11 21:43:41 2015 UTC,"Understood. Thanks for the feedback. I wrote the student and he was surprisingly understanding.

Professors,2yby7d,anyhopeleft,5,Sun Mar 8 12:22:20 2015 UTC,"I am not interested in students with perfect records, I am interested in students who can do good research.  I don't pay much attention to their grades, scores or even their academic background to some extent, not compared to their maturity and ability to do good work.    That said, I would be wary of taking a student with mental health problems because graduate school can be extremely stressful and isolating.  As a result, the amount of support these students can need from me and the other members of my lab can take away from everyone's productivity and poison the well of group moral.   Thus, it's a risk I take for my own career and everyone else I employ and mentor, and I am not sure if it's fair."
Professors,2yby7d,zazzlekdazzle,2,Sun Mar 8 14:29:56 2015 UTC,"Thanks for responding! The mental health issue was quite short-lived. It just took a bit of time to get used to the long term lifestyle change associated with my diagnosis which doesn't affect my performance as long as everything is under control though I'm still faced with a difficult learning environment.   Do you have any advice for how to go about submitting my applications? Would an admissions committee be open to making an exception for an otherwise good student/researcher who realized their misstep? I know I can get a letter from the lab I will be working for, but right now I haven't been there long enough for them to give a good comprehensive evaluation."
Professors,2yby7d,zazzlekdazzle,2,Sun Mar 8 15:21:11 2015 UTC,"Find the people you want to work with and communicate with them first and directly.  Tell each one you are interested in working with him/her and why.  Be detailed and be apprised of their work.  Try talk to them in person if you can, or at least on the phone.  If he/she is impressed with you, he/she will support your application in the admissions process, which means more than anything as long as your GRE scores are good.  I strongly caution you about the stresses of grad school, though.  Which is not to say you should not go, but that you should be sure you have adequate support while you are there.  Your short-lived problems may reemerge in this extremely stressful situation, that manages to take everyone down a little and for a short while at least."
Professors,2yby7d,tympestkaiser,4,Sun Mar 8 15:24:54 2015 UTC,"I've read your account many times over. I see quite a few hedges when discussing your academic performance (e.g. good GPA, in my opinion) and staying on top of course work (got caught up when I needed to--if your study habits are appropriate for the workload, there is no getting behind to catch up from).  Then taking a year off (to try some things that didn't work out). Then describing difficulties in grad school as the shortcomings of the school(s) to prepare you. Then an illness that takes a lifetime to manage which will put additional challenges on your time and coping mechanisms. As another poster has mentioned, graduate school is a lonely process and takes a ton of self-motivation.    In short, in golf there is a saying ""Play the ball where it lies."" I've applied it to my own life many times. It is important to take a look at your strengths and weaknesses as objectively as possible. If you required tutoring and struggled in your first year of grad school, the likelihood of those struggles continuing is very high. It sounds like the time in the hospital compounded an already difficult experience.  If you want to pursue graduate school, it may be best to take some remedial courses (my program calls them deficiencies) to help put some additional tools in your tool box. This may mean retaking a semester or so of senior-level courses). It can be embarrassing to contemplate, but going back to the basics to build on your knowledge base can really be beneficial in the long run.  The pace of graduate school is quite fast, and only gets faster. Another thing to consider is to take fewer classes at once. Switching schools is not likely to solve the entirety of your difficulties, in my opinion."
Professors,2yby7d,tympestkaiser,1 point,Sun Mar 8 15:04:37 2015 UTC,"Thanks. To get rid of a few ambiguities:  -My gpa was 3.5/4. (I thought this was good but idk now.)  -I took a year off to try some things and have time to put my applications together vs trying to rush through them while simultaneously handling my senior year coursework. I willingly left the post I had. -I should add that I completely switched fields (which was my bad and explained my lack of background). My degree was definitely preparation enough for me do well if I had continued in the same area. -Taking fewer classes was not an option to still be considered a student and receive aid.  I agree that grad school should not be a cakewalk. However, the institution does not provide (despite my asking) access to courses from previous years and the lack of organization and resources online and elsewhere leaves me unable to just find the courses on my own and audit them.  I'm using everything from books, courses from other universities to classmates, and I have no shame in needing a more basic course. I'm ready to recognize that maybe I wasn't ready for it this time which was exaggerated by the health problem, but what could I do to be able to start somewhere else without relying on my undergrad professors?"

I'm a dumb ass stranger on the Internet. Sounds a lot like the kinds of BS you find in a ton of schools, in combination with the pitfalls that come with starting fresh anywhere and having to learn their own bureaucracies/systems. I have a PhD. It took me a lot of time. I suffered it through the loss of my dad, having and raising two kids, and barely scraping by, not always knowing where the rent check would come from. There were some tough times and I even have an F on my record for one semester  I just flat out could not finish when the stresses snowed me under. Perseverance and motivation can overcome a whole lot of obstacles. You're in the best position to assess the best way forward. My point was to simply not be hesitant about acknowledging where you may need some additional support work. A step back might help in the way forward, especially if there was a total program change. Personally, I'm not a fan of auditing courses simply because there are no stakes (nothing to lose) and you have lesser opportunities to get feedback. Thus the suggestion to enroll in those courses.   I sincerely wish you the best. Regarding whether I would work with a student with s rocky past, that doesn't mean much to me. Work ethic, work history, and interpersonal dynamics are more important. However, having a rocky record myself as I've mentioned, I can say sometimes you won't even get in the door. It depends on the specifics of the position and the person hiring."

Professors,2xp78d,HotInTheStacks,5,Mon Mar 2 19:29:55 2015 UTC,"I found this advice on this website  ""Think about how long it will take students to complete the exam. When students are under time pressure, they may make mistakes that have nothing to do with the extent of their learning. Thus, unless your goal is to assess how students perform under time pressure, it is important to design exams that can be reasonably completed in the time allotted. One way to determine how long an exam will take students to complete is to take it yourself and allow students triple the time it took you – or reduce the length or difficulty of the exam.""  I think this sounds pretty reasonable from my experience. Also, since this is open-book, expect students to take longer on each question compared to closed-book, as students will need time to look up concepts in the text. Hopefully that helps at least give you a guideline."
Professors,2xp78d,Trillian42,4,Mon Mar 2 21:38:05 2015 UTC,"It will depend by field... the ""triple time"" estimate is one I quickly learned was not nearly adequate.  I teach mathematics.  I work through the exam at a controlled pace, including reading all the questions completely before starting.  Ideally I complete the exam in 1/10 the total time, but 1/8 is acceptable.  I consider 1/6 to be the absolute longest, and that assumes there are a few problems which are easy but tedious, so they're sucking up disproportionate time.  I guess my point is: see what other people in your field do, and adjust your next exam according to how this one goes."
Professors,2xp78d,Spetzo,2,Tue Mar 3 00:35:54 2015 UTC,"I multiple my test questions by 1.5 and that is the time for the test. So, 30 questions get 45 minutes.

Professors,2xhdxy,ampanmdagaba,2,Mon Mar 2 00:55:24 2015 UTC,"Pretty much anything is superior to traditional lecture. lecture can be more entertaining if the teacher is charismatic and fun, but it does not make it more efficient. By now it is pretty much proven. The only valid reason to have a lecture at all is when you improvise and didn't have time to prepare notes.  Make them work in class intead of listen to you. There are dosens of types of work they can do. My favorite book about it is ""Teaching waht you don't know"" by Therese Huston, but there are lots of good books about it. I try to combine activities orchestrated by me with more open-ended types of activity that originate from students, and that you only facilitate. An example of the first is to use socratic dialog and intermittent group work to make them solve some non-trivial question, followint the steps of the giants. For example, ""discover"" a law in ecology, or decipher a neural circuit, or converge on some important evolutionary concept. An open-ended one could be taking their questions (from the homework reading reflections), and throwing them back to students, for them to solve in groups. Then gathering answers, discussing their merits, converging on some syntesis. It works so much better than a lecture; incomparably better."
Professors,2xhdxy,sunflowerfly,1 point,Mon Mar 2 01:58:06 2015 UTC,"I know of an instructor that successfully flipped A&P.   She found other college professors online videos, and requires students watch them prior to class.   She also requires a hand written (for retention) spiral notebook. In the first class they leave several pages for an index, then number the rest. Each chapter they must explain all the major topics in their own words in this notebook. If it is a simple topic they must at least list it, with a brief description, and a page number in the book. As they walk into class she checks each one and stamps them if complete. If they are gone they must email a picture of the completed chapter by the due date (start of class) to get the stamp upon return. At the end of the semester she counts the stamps for grading.  That frees up a lot of class time for more hands on learning. They even sing and act out the silly songs people have made as memory aids.   She claims it is working well."

Professors,2xhdxy,raygungoespew,1 point,Mon Mar 2 00:52:12 2015 UTC,I think that the ability to cover some of the more basic/algorithmic content in videos outside of class is a plus because you can then use class time to focus on applying that basic knowledge to unique and interesting problems.

Professors,2xbiew,ampanmdagaba,14,Fri Feb 27 04:40:00 2015 UTC,"Two things that really seem to help break the blank-eyed, high-school brainwashed, stares are: 1) Physical, hands-on, small group projects 2) Swearing at/around them. Material projects in small groups make them communicate to figure out problems. The intimacy leads to better conversations. 3 to 4 people per group. Swearing, while fun to get the shock reaction, actually makes you seem human. Freshmen still see teachers as these inhuman, saint-esque, robots. They forget the person on stage are real people, too. Connect with them. Be ""real"", ask them what they ""like"", talk about it. Try to talk to each student, individually, even in a full lecture hall. They will begin to shrug off the terror of being outed; ""Oh no! People might think I actually <i>like</i> school!"" It also helps to remind them how much it costs, in real dollars, to come to class. For a State school, it is around $25-$35 per contact hour, for each class. It puts things into perspective. Cheers!"
Professors,2xbiew,A_Lictor_BLOR,3,Fri Feb 27 11:41:18 2015 UTC,"I don't like swearing per se, but I like the general direction in which you are going. Thanks! I'll think about it. The labs we've started to have recently seem to help a lot; probably because of this hands-on corporal aspect you describe."
Professors,2xbiew,theoldentimes,3,Fri Feb 27 23:45:38 2015 UTC,There's some way to achieve that 'intimacy' though. Swearing can be awkward - though I do try I to include it as much as possible.
Professors,2xbiew,theoldentimes,10,Sat Feb 28 12:20:16 2015 UTC,"If you're (i) getting good feedback and (ii) feeling like you are covering the material you want to, I wouldn't worry about changing your tactics too much. First year first semester can be tough teaching - the students aren't sure what to expect, they probably aren't used to the amount of independence that most forms of post-18 education demand, and they are almost certainly in a brand-new social environment.    Sometimes it does get too much, though. My method is often to try to start a conversation that's not necessarily covering the material we need to, but, will help prepare us for it. For teaching literature, that might we're talking about a common issue or topic that they're likely to have clear opinions about already; then we go and look into the text, keeping those ideas in mind, and seeing where the writing contradicts us or gives us something new.    That means, at the least, the class is getting used to sharing their voices, and that does often lead into fuller expressions of their opinions about texts (in which they might be a lot less sure of what's the right thing to say - which is understandable)."

Professors,2xbiew,theoldentimes,7,Fri Feb 27 23:45:52 2015 UTC,"I agree. I should add, too, you can't really compare freshmen and juniors for a few reasons. 1) The previous poster mentioned maturity and world experience. Those are biggies. The freshmen just need a little time to cook.  Many aren't yet appreciating what a precious opportunity college is or how tough it is to make your way in the world without the degree. They aren't fully independent yet, in many cases, so they haven't seen how crappy life can get, nor do they have many successful friends to judge themselves by. They aren't thinking about their investing in the future by focusing on studies.   2) The statistics are that only about half of all people who start a four year degree actually finish. Most of those who don't finish don't make it past being freshmen. The juniors are going to be a higher motivated and invested set of folks.  They also have more college experience--more knowledge about what it takes to be successful after making their ways through classes.   3) Finally, and this is not an exhaustive list but just my thoughts at 1am on reddit, but finally, juniors tend to be more likely to be majors in your field or at least minors. Freshmen are often just in a class because it is required for something. The junior level will get you the more interested students. If you can tap into that freshmen diversity, though, you can get some really cool conversations.   4) and lastly, (did I mention it is 1am), every class is different. I have been teaching college/uni 15 years and never had two alike. Some have 50% who can't shut up and some are just could hear a pin drop kind of classes.   Anyhow--hang in there. Enjoy the experience.   And get to know their names. And use them. Best advice I ever got for developing rapport. Take roll, every class, by calling out names. Even in big classes.  This will help you learn who they are. When they know you know that, they are more likely to develop some personal accountability to you."

Professors,2xbiew,nashife,2,Fri Feb 27 23:43:24 2015 UTC,It sounds like you're doing a good job. The students report feeling comfortable and productive. That's wonderful!  It just takes freshmen time to get their bearings.  edit: for freshman typo...although is it freshperson?...
Professors,2wymdb,J-HeyKid22,1 point,Tue Feb 24 05:47:24 2015 UTC,An honest question from an outsider: when would you have a temptation to write it in the margin of a paper?
Professors,2wymdb,ampanmdagaba,1 point,Tue Feb 24 14:42:01 2015 UTC,"I give comments about phrasing when the student's phrasing (i.e., sentence structure) is awkward (as in not idiomatic), not saying what I know they mean to say (based on context or asking the student), or not grammatical. I teach ESL, so I see these problems all the time, though I don't give this feedback as snarkily (?) as Archer."
Professors,2wymdb,Trillian42,1 point,Wed Feb 25 01:27:03 2015 UTC,"I see. So it's not about the clash of generational subcultures, it's more about the original meaning of this word. Thanks!"

Professors,2wmgla,RhinestoneTaco,9,Sat Feb 21 03:56:12 2015 UTC,"Just reading your post is triggering my anxiety. Very similar situation here, but in the second year. So far, not much is helping me, so sorry I can't offer more there. I just want to say, I feel ya. In trying to work through why I feel this way, I'm finding it's because in academia everything is based on how smart your colleagues and students perceive you to be. In my previous job, (also journalism) I never worried about if I appeared smart enough. I just did my job and was good at it. But now, anything that might give others the idea that I don't know something I should sinks me into panic, depression or both."
Professors,2wmgla,sharkbeagle,6,Sat Feb 21 04:45:14 2015 UTC,"I had a version of what you're describing while writing my dissertation. It was bad. In that case, the only thing that helped was a prescription for valium. (The psychiatrist I saw was pretty cool about realizing it was acute anxiety, brought on by my situation, that would eventually be resolved, so he didn't mind giving me something to fix those times when I was so broken.)   I think I had a lesser version of this when I first got a tenure track gig. Unfortunately, my solution was to basically work 100 hour weeks, a good chunk of that time spent just stressing about and not accomplishing anything. It faded eventually on its own, but not until I'd been there probably two years. I don't recommend that way of dealing. I'd go see someone if you can. (And I wouldn't rule out something like mindfulness meditation if you're not into dealing with the acute moments with medication.)"
Professors,2wmgla,firepile,3,Sat Feb 21 04:34:43 2015 UTC,"So much anxiety. I had a mini breakdown when I was writing my dissertation. Went on anti-depressants (anxiety targeted ones), which exacerbated my insomnia. Added ambien to the mix. Stopped taking the drugs. Anxiety and depression returned. Went back on the meds and added Ritalin to the mix for concentration issues. Got slightly better. Stopped taking the meds and am back in a funk and probably will be leaving academia.   I love teaching. Everything else that goes along with it fills me with dread and angst. I've just come to the place where I've decided that this isn't really for me. Which is a shitty realization to come to when you're in a massive amount of student loan debt for a Ph.D. that you're contemplating not using anymore..."
Professors,2wmgla,kairoschris,3,Sat Feb 21 06:23:44 2015 UTC,"It sounds like you're already aware of this but I wanted to point out that anxiety does become classically conditioned to environment. You may need to change where your computer is placed, work in a different room, or change location. Even if you deal with the overarching anxiety, a place can still trigger those feelings."
Professors,2wmgla,MrsTiggyWiggy,2,Sat Feb 21 17:04:36 2015 UTC,"Maybe you can reframe this. If you have anxiety over your research output or quality, you might be focusing too much on other people's potential, future opinions of your work. Is the point of this research so you can present at a conference, or get published, or get tenure, or gain the respect of your peers?... The real purpose of research, and the reason institutions fund such activities, should be to contribute to the body of knowledge in a field. Maybe try to focus more on the incremental additions you're contributing to your field, and less on your fear of others judging you. That way, it's more of an obligation to the advancement of your subject and to future generations of learner/scholars, and less of a measurement of your own quality.  The advice about mindfulness meditation, and about changing your environment or location, are also good."
Professors,2wmgla,stalling1,2,Sat Feb 21 20:24:14 2015 UTC,"Dear RhinestoneTaco and everyone who replied: Thank you. Good lord, thank you. I used to think it was just me, and no one ever talks about it.  My first year I thought I was going to lose it. I have struggled with generalized anxiety (sounds like what you're describing) on-and-off since grad school. My first year was so tough, and my generalized anxiety was augmented with panic attacks once a week (just before I would teach stats to 500 students who fucking hated my guts for a variety of fuck-ups that were due to my inexperience in teaching).   If you have coverage, go see a professional. After 9 months of struggling alone (actually, after 9 months of leaning on my SO too much for support but still keeping much of my anxiety to myself) I went to see a wonderful clinical psychologist who specialized in cognitive behavioral therapy. FYI, dear scholar, CBT has been empirically been shown to be very effect for anxiety and depression.  I actually started with Mind Over Mood and Feeling Good (for real, I went into a store and bought those two books... at the same time...), which really did help. But after engaging in CBT on my own, I decided that I wanted more guidance. CBT has really changed my approach to things that cause me anxiety, and has been astronomically effective.  I saw my clinical psychologist for about 6 months, and I had perhaps 10 sessions in that time. The last session was a year and a half ago, and I haven't felt that sick, counter-productive worry in almost 2 years. During my treatment, I developed a lot of cognitive skills that help me quiet the anxiety. I still feel anxiety sometimes, but if it gets counterproductive I do a CBT worksheet and it helps.   Obviously, you're not alone in dealing with anxiety. It never occurred to me that it would be widespread, but 20% of the population is dealing with clinical anxiety at any given moment. I suspect academics have a proportionately higher rate of anxiety."
Professors,2wmgla,DearSci3nce,1 point,Mon Mar 2 00:45:12 2015 UTC,"Hey, I think there should be professional psychiatrists who could help you. A friend of mine (also a prof) went to a shrink, sees them, I think, about once a month, or every other month, and is totally happy and relaxed now. A huge difference compared to how they used to be. So it may help.  I don't go to a shrink (come from a background that rejects shrinks, and I'm not sure I'll ever be able to overcome this). But I rely on tons of various tricks to keep the anxiety at bay.  One is to sleep enough (or at least try to), and to control caffeine consumption (which is very hard).  Another is not to think about work before going to bed, or in other situations like that, when you cannot work, and cannot write. In the first half of the day, if not at work, I allow myself to think about one aspect of work at a time. But you need to really control your thoughts, and  not let them wander all over the place. Anxiety is triggered when you are trying to think about 40 deadlines and partially exclusive targets at the same time. Don't let your mind do it.  Instead, use something like a basic ""Getting things done"" technique. Think of your to-do items. Prioritize them. Then EXPEL them from your mind, except one only. Etc.  Another thing - celebrate little things. Don't forget to reinforce yourself for your achievements. It's very easy to forget, as the process is so exhausting. But you should do it.  Another thing that I do, but it may sound silly to you; I often imagine that I'm a different person than I actually am. I have a set of 2-3 characters, including an artsy girl who is really into creative suffering, a chronically stoned dude with dreads, etc. And when I feel that anxiety builds up, I try to behave as these characters would. If I'm still in a good mood, the dude works. If I'm more tired, I have to switch the girl on. But they don't care, and they remind me that I can afford not to care as well.  Meditation helps a lot as well, except that I don't quite meditate. Too lazy for that I guess. But I do breathing exercises, they help a lot to keep the anxiety at bay.  And exercising. Physical exhaustion helps A LOT. Part of where mental exhaustion comes from is a disconnect between the ""fight or flight"" reaction your brain tries to generate, and the inability of the body to actually find something to fight. Or to flight from. If you fight and flight every now and then; 1-2 times a week maybe, it could make a real difference.  And to reiterate: think of visiting a shrink."
Professors,2wmgla,ampanmdagaba,1 point,Fri Feb 27 04:53:18 2015 UTC,"I experience this constantly. I've just accepted it as part of the job, part of being a scholar, and assume we all experience it. Just like musicians, no matter how good they are, probably still experience  stage fright before a show, I always have to shake off anxiety before writing, lecturing, or engaging really anything in the service of a credible academic. I assume this is a natural consequence of doing something you actually give a shit about.   Academia is incredibly difficult. Mastering your given field is a huge challenge, but no more challenging than learning to navigate the political apparatus of professional academia and the uniquely surreal social structure within it. We so often embody and reflect the subjects we study that it's difficult to draw a line between us and the material we convey. That, and we're constantly challenged over most everything we say and do, and the material that we're working with is constantly changing and growing.   I know this probably reads like series of bland platitudes, and perhaps it is, but if you take anything away from what I've said, let it be this: this is challenging work, not only intellectually, but emotionally. Don't underestimate that dynamic.   I encourage finding daily rituals that are comfortable and familiar. Eat in the same place, have a favorite mug, pic something you see on the way to or from work to watch grow and change. Find something to do with your hands, like carpentry or art, and channel your anxiety into it.   Good luck, and thanks for taking the time to share with the rest of us and give us the opportunity to reflect on this element of our profession.   EDIT - because reasons."
Professors,2wmgla,neofaust,1 point,Sun Feb 22 22:53:18 2015 UTC,Let me tell you a story about giving up. I have tried 5 consecutive times to peel all of the skin off of a small child with a potato peeler without killing them. None of them made it through the entire process without dying long before I have finished. I have tried reducing the amount of torture before I skin them but that doesn't work. I have considered an anesthetic to slow the blood flow but if I put them under that would take away all the pleasure I derive from the screams. But I won't give up! And neither should you!
Professors,2weqyt,neofaust,2,Thu Feb 19 07:34:57 2015 UTC,"Just curious because I have no idea how this works:  Are pageviews counted any time someone looks at any comment thread in the sub (such as me coming here to this page directly from my front page), or is it only counting visits to the actual /r/Professors sub page?"
Professors,2weqyt,waywardminer,2,Thu Feb 19 15:01:55 2015 UTC,"Here's the blurb reddit has about it on the actual tool:  Below are the traffic statistics for your subreddit. Each graph represents one of the following over the interval specified.  pageviews are all hits to /r/Professors, including both listing pages and comment pages. uniques are the total number of unique visitors (determined by a combination of their IP address and User Agent string) that generate the above pageviews. This is independent of whether or not they are signed in. subscriptions is the number of new subscriptions that have been generated in a given day. This number is less accurate than the first two metrics, as, though we can track new subscriptions, we have no way to track unsubscriptions. Note: there are a couple of places outside of your subreddit where someone can click ""subscribe"", so it is possible (though unlikely) that the subscription count can exceed the unique count on a given day."
Professors,2wdc06,DrGarebearPHD,5,Wed Feb 18 23:39:55 2015 UTC,"I'm surprised no one has suggested the most natural setting for multi-disciplinary work: the liberal arts college. These institutions focus on providing a broad education and are typically more centered on teaching than research.  But even at a liberal arts college (if you can be so picky and fortunate to restrict your eventual job search to SLAC's only), you'll almost definitely need a doctorate for a chance at a tenure track position. And doctorates, representing the culmination of mastery in an area, are almost exclusively offered in single fields. Plus they take 3 to 6 years to finish, after the 6-7 years of undergrad and masters study.  I would recommend selecting one area to focus on, and majoring in that, while minoring in a field of related interest. Diversity of specialties are nice, but remember that positions are typically offered by individual departments looking to fill particular teaching and/or research needs. That said, there is a lot of overlap among the three subjects you listed, so there should be a lot of opportunity for exploring all these areas regardless of where you specialize.  Lastly, for what it's worth, I've never heard of a University Professor rank, nor a specialism. Maybe they're at select universities?"
Professors,2wdc06,stalling1,3,Thu Feb 19 02:34:43 2015 UTC,"If your research areas overlap, you can have appointments in multiple departments.  For instance, it would not be odd to see a professor of biology and chemistry, or chemistry and physics, biology and psychology, computer science and psychology/cognitive science, history and philosophy, etc.  We have a professor of art history and anthropology.  Basically, you have to be able to justify to multiple departments that you are qualified for a faculty appointment.  This is usually through a combination of your degree and research area."

From what I understand, cc's really like folks that can teach a couple subjects.   Another possibility since you like history is to wrap the subject up into a history class.  Religious history is pretty common.  I'm a historian that likes criminal justice stuff, so a few years ago I created a ""history of crime and criminal justice in the us"" class."
Professors,2wdc06,expostfacto-saurus,1 point,Thu Feb 19 00:25:39 2015 UTC,Oh ok thank you very much. I was told that a good way to teach multiple subjects is to blend them with subjects like history so this helps even more thanks!
Professors,2wdc06,sunflowerfly,1 point,Thu Feb 19 00:49:33 2015 UTC,"No problem.  The really cool thing with history is the ability to jump in different directions.

Once I get enough knowledge on the subject and get approval from the department, I can create a history of medicine course."

Professors,2wdc06,expostfacto-saurus,3,Sat Mar 14 15:45:09 2015 UTC,"It's often called a University Professor and is a rank above full Professor. It indicates that you contribute significantly to multiple disciplines across the university.

Good luck obtaining that rank."

Professors,2vnx0s,invisiblecows,6,Thu Feb 12 18:21:22 2015 UTC,Do this but also give them the rubric before they take the test. They should know exactly how they will be graded before they so the assignment so they can prepare what you are testing. If you are surprising students with the grading system it's going to cause a lot of problems.
Professors,2vnx0s,ProfAbroad,6,Thu Feb 12 20:31:55 2015 UTC,"Giving feedback beyond what they lost points is critical. Identify problem areas, missing information and confusing writing or unclear writing. Correct the wrong bits. All this is ridiculously time consuming and involves teaching writing as well as whatever your content is. But we probably agree that it's worth it. And my students respect it because they learn and generally they see their their grades go up on every exam."
Professors,2vnx0s,Jobediah,3,Fri Feb 13 00:23:23 2015 UTC,"Done and done. I have an assignment document with a description of the assignment, good example of a complete assignment (for the shorter ones), and a detailed marking rubric that is filled out and returned with the student. I just got my teaching evals back, and at least one student felt my one-page, 6 components x 3 level descriptions was ""vague"". wtf."
Professors,2vnx0s,invisiblecows,9,Fri Feb 13 03:12:59 2015 UTC,"I think that's always going to be the case. You will never be able to convince 100% of your students that your standards are clear and fair-- there will always be one person who is angry because she didn't get an A, one person who resents you for requiring him to do things that he finds challenging, and / or one person who just doesn't like your face. That's teaching.  I think the important thing is to have a system that most reasonable people would deem appropriately clear and fair. From there, you can use the broader trends in your student feedback to refine your process, but you'll always have to ignore the outliers who just want to complain."
Professors,2vnx0s,jitterfish,2,Fri Feb 13 14:10:39 2015 UTC,Have you tried having students grade a piece of work with a rubric? I do it at the start of the semester as a class exercise. It not only teaches them a bit about the standards expected but they can see how when the rubric is applied even by different people a similar mark results.
Professors,2vnx0s,jitterfish,1 point,Fri Feb 13 23:28:27 2015 UTC,"I have.  Technically, I am doing everything right - confirmed by the fact that I haven't yet seen a suggestion that I am not doing in all the comments on this post. I was essentially checking that there is not something I am missing, but there isn't.   So convincing students that my exams and assignments are fair is more a matter of my ability to sell the assignments & tests, and less about the actual fairness of them. I will have to think about this more. And maybe write a paper about it :)"
Professors,2vnx0s,jitterfish,1 point,Sat Feb 21 11:48:33 2015 UTC,Not sure how feasible but is there any room for co-constructing assignments with your students?
Professors,2vnx0s,SolidRambo,1 point,Sun Feb 22 19:09:23 2015 UTC,"Not really. I provide students with assignment documents that are a few pages long – one page for the basic description, one page for an example assignment (for short, low-stakes assignments), and one page for the rubric. They take me days to construct - it usually takes me a day or two just to create the marking rubric, although now that I've done it a bunch I am faster at it. I need time outside of the regular term to do this.  However, I have thought about doing a focus group at the end of the semester to have students come together and create an assignment, which I think gets at your goal in co-construction.   The variety of assignments that students are exposed to means that they actually bring a lot of knowledge about assignment design to the table, and discussion with other students might help to make clear the constraints instructors are dealing with (you can never please anyone), while coming up with a ""least-offense"" interesting way to meet learning objectives.   This is on my ""potential to-do list"", but along with everyone else, I am just so busy!"

Then I sit in my office and nobody shows up. Thankfully most of my students give me great evaluations, but when I received a comment last semester about the arbitrary guidelines for the written assignments I was definitely aboard the wtf train."
Professors,2vnx0s,AuntieChiChi,6,Sun Feb 22 23:14:32 2015 UTC,"Talk to them about the distinction between ""arbitrary"" and ""best professional judgment"". You are using the latter; the students think there's no difference.   You can also talk about how all grading is based on best professional judgment, even the stuff they think is black and white. The objective items on an exam have the illusion of objectivity, and perhaps the answers themselves are objective but the grading certainly is not.   If you give a memorization question worth, say, 10 points, and the student gets part of it wrong, how much do you take off? No points? 10 points? 5 points? Or what? How do you decide? For that matter, how does one decide to put such items on an exam at all? And how do you decide how much the exams count toward the semester grade? Answer: You use your best professional judgment. The entire concept of grading and its use in certifying student success in the university is predicated on individuals' best professional judgment, and students need to be aware of that.   Coming clean with students about your use of best professional judgment, and how it differs from assessment based on arbitrariness (or worse, based on bias and prejudice) is IMO one of those things you have to talk about on the first day of class and regularly thereafter."
Professors,2vnx0s,king_polly,2,Tue Feb 17 16:27:48 2015 UTC,"I've heard this before, and when I tried it last semester it actually made things worse. I got the impression that my ""coming cleaning"" speech was seen as defensive, which set of their concerns. As in, ""why is she being so defensive? I wonder what's wrong with her marking and assignments?""   I suspect the coming clean business interacts with age and gender. While I'm 35 years old, I look much younger, and I'm a lady, so my students already tend to distrust me for those reasons alone. I also sometimes get the impression that the more I try to explain, the more information they have an opportunity to misunderstand and argue against.

Professors,2vnx0s,MrsTiggyWiggy,3,Thu Feb 12 19:34:56 2015 UTC,"Do peer evals too.  Have them each grade a few papers using the very rubric you use so they can begin to understand how the rubric grading system works.  You could do it with discussing forums or a smaller essay at first.  One option could be to give them a writing assignment during class that they get 15 minutes to complete, then pass out the rubrics and have then trade papers and grade someone else's.  Then have them trade again and grade another one.  Then you could have a sample essay (maybe that you wrote) and grade that one together as a class.   Compare scores and if your rubric is clearly written, you shouldn't see too much variation in the scores and they should understand the process better."

"" In the next assignment my group put random sentences into the paper and weren't called out on it, so in our case the grades for our 10 page write ups were just skim and scan grades.

Professors,2vdb67,ProfAbroad,3,Tue Feb 10 04:27:26 2015 UTC,As others have mentioned you are being evaluated constantly. Part of that is whether the faculty feel like they can work with you. I've seen quite a few candidates completely lose out because of an offhand remark that was totally stupid to say.  Getting the interview means thy think you are qualified on paper. Now show them that you are a nice person and qualified in front of them. Show that you can fit in to the culture of that department and you are not going to cause trouble.  Also be aware that sometimes you need to shut up. Especially so in the dinner when you might have a good chance to ask questions about the department. So listen as much as possible and make sure you actually want to work there.

Professors,2vdb67,zxo,2,Tue Feb 10 04:27:06 2015 UTC,"First, off... congrats and good luck!  Secondly. I think you're overthinking this all over the place, to be honest. The key word for my response is: ""Comfort.""   There's no code or guideline, so you might want to take an option or two, but you can be basic here. Start with this simple code: be comfortable! Start there and build outward. By default, I'd aim for business casual, in whatever configuration is comfortable to you. If it's cold, I, personally, would do a shirt, tie, sweater (as a male). Typically, slacks. I'd consider having a jacket, but only if it's comfortable and necessary. I'd be surprised if they took you to a place that requires you to dress better than that unless they're really flush; and if you hit a comfortable but nice biz-casual, you'll look pretty good if you go somewhere that's very casual.  If you drink alcohol, you could certainly get some and it would be fine. If you are concerned, don't do more than about a glass. If you don't think you want to drink, don't. No big deal. Just say ""You know, I'd rather not, flying always makes me a bit tired"" or something along those lines.   Again, good luck!!"

Everyone is waiting to see how this whole program turns out. My tenure will be based on teaching excellence. The only problem with that is that the research-based faculty in my department have no idea what that looks like, and the university seems to think that means student evaluations :(("

Before the evaluations are handed out, do an overview of everything the students learned in order to show them how far they've come, tell them you enjoyed being their professor, thank them, and say you'd love to see any of them in your future classes.   As long as you can deliver it convincingly, it invokes the reciprocity norm."
Professors,2vd3q4,MrsTiggyWiggy,3,Tue Feb 10 21:59:27 2015 UTC,"The evals are on on-line in a 5 week window, and participation is self-selecting. The results tend to be bimodal - the students who are motivated to complete them either really, really like you, or really, really hate you. It makes them harder to influence, and every time a student asks for special treatment and I say no, I wonder if it's motivating enough for him/her to complete the evals to my determent...  But I get great evals for content, enthusiasm, stimulating interest... I get poor evaluations for my exams and assignments. I make students write, and a theme in my evals is always ""great course, but marking on assignments and exams was so subjective.""   Uh, yeah, it was, but it wasn't arbitrary. Students don't see the difference, and unless they're being marked on rote memorization, they don't trust that I/TAs can tell the difference between a student who can write a good argument and a student who can't (a bit of Dunning-Kruger at work).  My exams are aligned with learning outcomes as well as lecture activities, and items test higher levels from Bloom's taxonomy. I also use item analysis to determine if exam questions have predictive value (ie. do students who do well on the exam also do well on each individual question? If the answer is no, then it's a bad question). I know my exams are fair, but students think because I'm asking them to do something other than regurgitate an answer, that it's impossible to tell the difference.  And my research-based colleagues literally don't even know what I'm talking about (alignment? Learning outcomes? Item analysis? Bloom's Taxonomy?), forget the students. My exams are fair, my assignments stimulate critical thinking and help develop metacognitive skills, but I will never score high on those items in the SEQ.   I honestly think my department would be happier if I switched to all MCQ, or ask students to draw cartoons, because it would increase those scores. However, it would be at the expense of actual learning to satisfy SEQ scores. No thanks."

I have been doing a lot of research on this very issue. when you look at the linguistic studies, there are certain words that pop up for male professors which have no equivalent for female professors. It boils down to a bias that men are professors, and women are teachers. Men are most often perceived as successful professors just for being knowledgeable or funny. Professors are male, wear jackets with elbow patches and chose their job. Teachers (women) are supposed to be warm and caring and more female. What is viewed as humor in a male professor can be seen as sarcasm or crassness in a female professor, because there is a bias that the female professor is being bitchy. Type in words like moody, and you will see that it's mostly a word that shows up for female professors. There are other studies where students took online courses and were told their professor was of the opposite gender. Both professors taught the same course. When students thought the professor was a female (although it was actually a male) their bias was evident."

The fact that some rail lines are valuable and worthy of our investment doesn't mean that every rail line is similarly worthy.  Rather than saying ""everyone needs to teach more classes"" though, what we should do is have more teaching-track jobs. Something with a 3/3 teaching load, no research expectations, and similar job security to tenure (these might even be tenure-track jobs). Expecting every professor to be a researcher results in a lot of lousy research, and the need to give people like you 5/5 teaching loads (and I assume very mediocre pay) to pick up the slack."

Professors,2umv8l,bl1y,0,Wed Feb 4 01:21:34 2015 UTC,"I was just basing it off of what my tenured professors actually teach, which is typically 2/2 or 2/1. A teaching-only position would obviously be more than that, but I think 4/4 might be too much and start compromising the teaching. Of course a lot depends on class size and subject matter. A 100 person lecture with 2 TAs and a scantron final is going to be very different from a 20 person senior seminar with a 20 page final paper, which is again very different from a 20 person freshman comp class with 4 short papers and 1 12-page paper.

But to suggest that teaching loads should be increased across the board, at the expense of research duties just because some of that research, when published, may not be earth-shattering, is a ridiculous argument to make.  Faculty who are engaging in research need:   Security to make sure that they can pursue lines of research that may not be politically safe Time during the week/semester to pursue that research, which means not filling their calendar with teaching/course prep/assignment evaluation/etc. Time across semesters to engage in long-term research projects that may not come to fruition as quickly as short-sighted critics might expect Understanding from colleagues that some research projects fizzle out, fail, or otherwise end in unexpected ways, requiring further time to get going on new iterations of those projects or turning to entirely new ones   However, at the same time, in posts within this thread, you've leveled criticisms against your own faculty for not publishing often enough for your liking. If the 50/40/10 split of research (publication)/teaching/service is already a significant constraint on faculty output, expecting the vast majority of faculty to shift to a 30/60/10 relationship will inevitably mean that the development of innovating and challenging scholarship in affected fields will retard significantly."

That's not at all the argument I made. My argument is that we should increase teaching loads, at the expense of research duties for professors whose research, when published, is at best of marginal value. Professors who are doing important research and producing meaningful scholarship would be able to keep a lower teaching load.   However, at the same time, in posts within this thread, you've leveled criticisms against your own faculty for not publishing often enough for your liking.   Yes. If you're teaching a 2/2 load, and go a decade without publishing, that's a problem. Instead of a 50/40/10 split, they've got something like a 10/40/10. I think reasonable accommodations should be made for projects taking longer than expected, hitting dead ends, and the unpredictability of the publication market. But at the same time I don't think we should take the attitude that any amount of publication of any quality on any subject fulfills half your professorial responsibilities. Just imagine if the same standard applied to teaching duties.   expecting the vast majority of faculty to shift to a 30/60/10 relationship will inevitably mean that the development of innovating and challenging scholarship in affected fields will retard significantly.   Again, I said I'd rather see fewer publications, but of higher quality. I think a 4-5 year time frame to produce some meaningful results is pretty fair. Even with a 3/3 load you will have time to do some research and writing, plus the summers, and maybe for a semester or two you get a reduced workload if you're at a point where your research demands it. That probably isn't going to slow down innovative and challenging scholarship very much. In fact, it might help it. Departments that have a strong publish-or-perish attitude encourage professors to get out work that isn't fully digested -- that work isn't innovative or challenging."

At least in the humanities, it would make sense to increase teaching loads to 3/3, while taking a quality-over-quantity approach to publishing. We really don't need professors publishing papers every one or two years that are read by half a dozen people and cited in exactly zero subsequent works. Academia would be better served by these professors taking on a couple extra classes and maybe publishing only once every four or five years, but doing something substantial with their writing.  The program I'm in right now (creative writing MFA) we have a professor with a 1/1 teaching load who hasn't published a short story in at least 2 years, and his last novel was a decade ago. Another professor with a 2/2 teaching load had her last novel in 2008, and the last short story was well before that. We have another professor who has published some work recently, but is only teaching 1 class this semester (he was on leave in the Fall). Meanwhile, the department's budget is being gutted; the lit journal budget is being slashed, MFA scholarships have dropped by nearly half, and the department head gets shot down when he wants to give some adjuncts a couple hundred more dollars. Something is obviously messed up here.  Down in the basement though, the non-tenure track (but still full time) professors teaching freshman comp have a 3/3 teaching load, and some of them still manage to publish.

Something is obviously messed up here.   Totally. If you want to go the cost-effectiveness route, I would look to those administrative units & departments that suck up tuition-related revenues.

They're getting by in shitty situations, but the solution should not be to make it more shitty for others--we should be making it better for those in awful circumstances (e.g., hiring more full-time instructors rather than churning through the meat grinder of TAs in order to justify continuing particular graduate programs)."
Professors,2umv8l,bl1y,-2,Tue Feb 3 15:33:03 2015 UTC,"Of course, part of the point of tenure is to provide faculty the opportunity to explore research projects that may or may not become significant. Expecting someone's output to be 100% earth-shattering is literally the worst approach to take.   There is a middle ground between 100% earth-shattering and entirely irrelevant even to other professors in the same field. That's why I said quality over quantity.   They're getting by in shitty situations, but the solution should not be to make it more shitty for others   A 3/3 teaching load is hardly ""shitty."" It's full time work. If you're teaching a 2/1 load and publishing garbage every other year, then you're basically just working a part-time job, and that's fine, but you should be getting a part-time salary for it, not $80-100k."
Professors,2umv8l,herennius,6,Tue Feb 3 15:41:07 2015 UTC,"And what I am suggesting is that you cannot fully anticipate what will be earth-shattering or ""entirely irrelevant"" until it is put out there in the world. (If it's really that irrelevant, it likely won't get published in a credible journal anyway.)  I did not say a 3/3 load in and of itself was shitty. I said that a 3/3 load taught by non-tenure-track instructors was shitty, because they are teaching, attempting to publish, and doing so with no job security.  For TT faculty, teaching & research obligations are also offset by (potentially overwhelming) service obligations--directing theses/dissertations, administrating programs, etc. If you want to keep making the argument that a reduced teaching load has no offset duties, that's fine, but I think you're likely missing part of the picture."
Professors,2umv8l,bl1y,-4,Tue Feb 3 15:48:15 2015 UTC,"I said that a 3/3 load taught by non-tenure-track instructors was shitty, because they are teaching, attempting to publish, and doing so with no job security.   Full time non-tenure track faculty still have better job security than the rest of workforce outside of academia. They're under contract for a term of years, have academic freedom, and can only be fired for cause. That's a whole lot better than being an at-will employee. Sure, they're not guaranteed a job for life, but the only people outside of academia who get this perk are Supreme Court justices.   If it's really that irrelevant, it likely won't get published in a credible journal anyway.   Perhaps you've never heard of the Sokal Hoax."
Professors,2umv8l,bl1y,6,Tue Feb 3 15:54:21 2015 UTC,"Many states have reduced or outright eliminated multi-year contracts and as a result NTT instructors do not experience the privileges you've outlined regarding being fired for cause. This may be true for some institutions but it is sadly not representative of the situation for most.   Re: credible publication--please pay attention to my use of the qualifier ""likely."""

Professors,2ugufv,bl1y,2,Mon Feb 2 14:48:20 2015 UTC,I have done everything in my power to work toward that goal   Can you expand a bit on this? What were you doing that helped you to get onto TT? And any idea what things which seemed useful at first turned out to be complete wastes of time?
Professors,2ugufv,bl1y,3,Mon Feb 2 14:56:26 2015 UTC,"I think the best thing I did in the past two years or so was gain teaching experience that allowed me to design an entire course.  I transitioned from being a TA to being an actual instructor in charge of the direction of the course.  This was important for the SLACs I was applying to because they wanted to see that I could develop and implement an entire course from start to finish.  I also started mentoring undergraduate students directly on independent research projects.  So, I'm not saying that TA experience doesn't help a candidate, but if you can, try to gain some experience as an instructor or lecturer for a course.  You'll be in charge more and will be able to show that you can develop curriculum, write exams, and manage problems that arise with student performance & grades, etc.   What worked for me this year was being a visiting assistant professor (VAP).  I took a huge gamble by accepting this position and I wasn't sure if it would be a dead end or lead to a tenure track position.  I got lucky and it's been the latter.  If you go this route, do know that it can be risky and you could end up being a VAP for awhile.  But I went into this year knowing I would devote all of my energy to being the best teacher I could be (ie. many late nights prepping my courses).  I also focused my efforts on starting up an independent research program for undergraduates.  It's been a ton of work but it's also been a lot of fun.  I've viewed this year as a trial run for a TT position and I can honestly say that I want to keep doing what I'm doing for a long time to come.  It's hard for me to say what might have been a complete waste of time.  I'm not really sure if there is anything on my CV that a committee would have viewed negatively.  I've volunteered at museums and for outreach organizations.  I'm not sure if any of these helped my candidacy, but personally I like doing these things, so I keep making them a priority even if they may not be important to a search committee.  Not sure if I answered your questions, but let me know if you have more.  I'm happy to provide advice in the context of what worked for me."
Professors,2ugufv,bl1y,1 point,Mon Feb 2 19:48:13 2015 UTC,Did you do much publishing? Conventions/panels/etc?
Professors,2ugufv,ZeboTheClown,2,Mon Feb 2 23:15:00 2015 UTC,"I have a couple of papers and have presented posters at national conferences.  This year I also did an oral presentation at a regional conference.  These things matter a lot for the top tier SLACs that want their faculty to lead research projects and bring in funding.  I tried to target SLACs that prioritize teaching, so I think my (weaker) publication record was less of a concern.  It was never mentioned at my interview.  I didn't get interviews at any of the top 20 SLACs I applied to this year, likely because of my lack of publications.  In previous years, I have interviewed on-campus for VAP positions at a lot of the top SLACs, so they do tend to prioritize teaching experience over publications/research experience for their temp positions.  I have a reference who always mentions that I have a paper in progress, and which should be published within the year.  That may help some, but I'm not sure how much weight that has in the grand scheme of things."
Professors,2ugufv,vestycakes,1 point,Tue Feb 3 00:14:23 2015 UTC,"Poster presentations seem so odd to me. (I have a friend getting an econ PhD who talks about them.) I'm only used to panels where you read papers and have a Q&A.  I could see the publication history not being much of a big deal for a VAP, since they (at least the ones I've seen) are meant to give you time to do your research so you can qualify for TT."
Professors,2ugufv,ChargerEcon,1 point,Tue Feb 3 03:14:12 2015 UTC,"Depends on the field. What you describe seems like a thematic poster session to me.  At my conferences, poster presentations are often higher quality than the slide presentations. The only reason they're poster presentations is because there wasn't enough similar research to form a slide session"

Anyone can say they're passionate about teaching but truly passionate people can show you. Back everything up with an assignment, discussion, or activity that can demonstrate what you're talking about. Good luck!"
Professors,2udo0s,bitchwithacapital_C,5,Sun Feb 1 07:15:57 2015 UTC,This.  And if you don't have much teaching experience be very specific about what you would do in a class.  There are several resources out there that talk about best practices in your discipline.  These are great places to start and then interpret into how you actual use/will use those practices to be an effective instructor.
Professors,2udo0s,kaosmonkey,1 point,Sun Feb 1 13:00:35 2015 UTC,"Maybe that's where I'm running into trouble. This portfolio has two sections for innovative teaching practices, so I'm trying to focus on who I am as a teacher."
Professors,2udo0s,ampanmdagaba,1 point,Sun Feb 1 17:00:32 2015 UTC,"Still use examples. Even if you covered methodology, use examples to show what you mean. Show, don't tell.  First go through big questions in your head. Why would you teach somebody? What's the meaning of it? Why would they come to you, and not just watch khan academy? What can you do? What you should do? What you want to do? How do you know that it is a right thing?  And once you feel some answers arising, nail them down with very specific examples. Maybe pick one class, and use it to illustrate why you think this is what means to be a good teacher."
Professors,2udo0s,cashton713,3,Mon Feb 2 02:57:19 2015 UTC,"I had a class in grad school that spent some time on teaching philosophies. They're really difficult to write, in part because you are writing about yourself in a fairly impersonal medium. You definitely need to focus on your approach to teaching and your thoughts on it, but it needs to sound professional (not overly emotional/sappy).   Also, consider that it needs to convey specific details about your own ideas/experience. Usually if you find that you're getting sappy, you're probably headed in a somewhat clichéd direction. Everyone ""feels passionate"" about teaching, we all care deeply about student success, etc. What makes you unique in terms of your understanding of the role teachers play in education? What specifically informs your ideas about teaching?   I hope this helps. I've written and rewritten mine, and I still don't feel great about it (that being said, I've managed to land several teaching positions with it, so something's working). It's a really tough piece to write, but it's not impossible!   Lastly, sorry if this is formatted poorly. I'm on mobile and not entirely sure how to make it look right."
Professors,2udo0s,bl1y,1 point,Sun Feb 1 06:32:08 2015 UTC,"I wrote one recently after taking a composition pedagogy course (nothing but philosophy of teaching!), so I may be able to help you out.  One thing you'll want to think about is your theory of how students learn and just what is going on in the classroom. Do you see yourself as delivering information to them (typical lecture style)? Or, do you believe that teaching is better done by allowing students to engage with concepts and discover new things organically (known affectionately as ""hide the ball"")?  Here's a quickie example (obviously overly casual): I teach freshman composition, and the class is a traditional seminar style, based more around group discussion than me lecturing. This is for two reasons. First, composition is largely a skill set rather than a knowledge set. You get skills by doing, and talking in class (specifically, communicating your ideas to others, and understanding and responding to their ideas) is very close to the skill of writing. If I were to lecture the entire time, then the experience of class would be utterly disconnected from their experience of doing the work of the class (the essays). Second, I want students to be exposed to a variety of points of view. Not diversity for diversity's sake, but because it's useful to examine an issues with several different approaches. When a student goes to write an essay, he'll need to consider what questions a reader will have, or objections they'll raise. These can be hard to imagine, especially for a beginning writer. However, if week after week, that student hears other students' approaches, and here's them raise issues he wouldn't have thought of, then when he sits down to write he is able to recall their approaches, and look at his own writing through their lens.  Feel free to hit me up with any questions. In general, what you need to be doing is looking at not just what you think works, but why you think that works."
Professors,2udo0s,bl1y,1 point,Sun Feb 1 14:27:19 2015 UTC,Thanks. I think I'm struggling with how many examples to include. I'm limited to one page and there are entire sections devoted to innovative teaching practices.
Professors,2udo0s,bl1y,2,Sun Feb 1 17:02:42 2015 UTC,"It's hard to know exactly what to do, since this is for a competition, and not a job application. If this were for a job, I'd say not to focus much on innovative teaching practices. It's a teaching philosophy, not a sample class."
Professors,2udo0s,bl1y,1 point,Sun Feb 1 17:10:40 2015 UTC,"It's a 20 page portfolio and we're required to include outcomes, approach to teaching and learning, and innovative teaching practices for each of two classes, in addition to a CV and teaching philosophy. There's a workshop on teaching portfolios this week. I guess I'll go to that and hope they have some insight on this specific portfolio."
Professors,2udo0s,ampanmdagaba,2,Sun Feb 1 17:31:27 2015 UTC,"In that case, try to make sure you're keeping in mind the different roles each item is supposed to play. Your teaching philosophy should briefly make a connection to your assignments and practices, but leave most of that explanation to the documents dedicated to those practices.  Basically explain the philosophy, and then you can cap it off with ""These principles come into play in XYZ technique, discussed on QPR page."""
Professors,2udo0s,ampanmdagaba,1 point,Sun Feb 1 17:35:33 2015 UTC,"That's the current plan. Of course, the remaining space needs to speak to me as a teacher... and I'm completely failing at my ""respect and compassion for students"" blurb not sounding incredibly saccharine.

Professors,2udo0s,ampanmdagaba,1 point,Sun Feb 1 17:38:26 2015 UTC,"terrible student who only became less terrible when I had to teach things to my classmates   Recognize that learning-through-teaching, and the bad-student-reformed-now-teacher narratives are both common.

Given how easy it is to save a copy of a webpage now, it might be time to create a new standard for web sources. It wouldn't be particularly hard to require students to save them and e-mail in a copy of all their web sources.  A lot of libraries also, I presume, have scanners that double as pdf faxes, so you could likewise have students copy relevant pages from hard copy books. This would certainly eliminate my favorite mode of cheating: Get the only copy from the library, make up quotations that fit what you need, and don't return the book until you get your grade back.  Edit: When I was on a law journal, we had to make a hard copy of every source any article we published referenced and keep them all on file. So, it's not like this isn't done. It sucked for us, but it's easier for an author who already has the source there in front of him."

Professors,2tp4qc,sharethelight,1 point,Mon Jan 26 18:01:29 2015 UTC,"The foreign degrees isn't an issue if she has her degrees evaluated by a degree and a credential evaluation agency here within the US. I would recommend  having her get her degree evaluated by a member of the National Association of Credential Evaluation Services (NACES), which is accepted by many colleges and government agencies here's one that I would recommend  https://www.fis-web.com/.    Depending on the State that you live in, most community colleges require a  minimum of a masters degree in the discipline being taught. So she wouldn't be very likely to be hired to teach history at the community college, whereas K-12 would be more likely.  If she wants to go the K-12 route, it would be advisable to have her complete her teaching credential in the state that you live in.  She shouldn't discount community college is she's interested in it, qualified to teach it, and has excellent communication skills.  You can't worry about competing with PhDs, you or she needs to focus on herself rather than worrying about naysayers and people with PhDs.  I know a lot of people with a BA and BSc that are far superior community colleges educators than some PhDs.  Yes, it is possible to teach at a community college with a bachelors degree, but that is typically common in vocational or CTE disciplines where experience and an undergraduate degree is acceptable like: respiratory therapy, flight traffic control, welding, HVAC, culinary arts, and a few more. This also varies from state to state."
Professors,2tp4qc,sharethelight,2,Fri Feb 13 15:01:00 2015 UTC,thanks for the advice. we were trying to find something that wouldn't require much more investment in time/education (like a teaching cert) because we will probably be moving in a year when i start my MS work.  She liked the CC idea because she's not big on dealing with kids (and moreso parents).  I think we'll be looking at staff positions and i've employed a resume specialst to help polish that up.

Professors,2tnqye,shateredsoul,3,Sun Jan 25 22:45:28 2015 UTC,"Congratulations! First, does your startup money expire? If not, you may want to wait until you are collecting data in the field to buy some of that equipment, since it becomes obsolete so fast. As for the fridge and couch, it depends on what the norm at your university is. Some places don't allow things like fridges, microwaves, etc. in individual offices because of energy use policies. If you will have undergrad RAs, will they get course credit for working in your lab? If so, assigning them an individual project and holding regular lab meetings is a good way to keep them on track."
Professors,2tnqye,coldgator,1 point,Mon Jan 26 02:07:51 2015 UTC,"Thanks! Some of the money does expire, I was thinking the same thing. I might just stick to the bare essentials at the start. I do have to look into whether the department offers credit for RA positions. I was planning to do weekly lab meetings either way.   I didn't even know some universities had energy use policies. Maybe I'll place it in the lab so RAs can use it too."
Professors,2tnqye,DearSci3nce,1 point,Mon Jan 26 06:29:30 2015 UTC,"I have a similar position, and if you have a heavy teaching load I would wait until after the 1st semester to find volunteer undergrad RAs. My experience was that I took on 2 RAs to help me set up, but they required so much attention and guidance it took me twice as long. In hindsight, I would have used all my ""spare time"" in the first semester to set-up, and then recruited some keeners from my 1st semester courses to be volunteer RAs in the 2nd semester.  In terms of collecting data, it depends what you're doing and your skills set. I find E-Prime to be undergrad-friendly, but it's not super-flexible. Matlab & Python are more flexible - and Python is free! - but they are not undergrad-friendly, and you would be doing most of the programming (assuming you program at all). This is time-consuming and not tenable long-term. See if your department has a site-license for anything."
Professors,2tnqye,MrsTiggyWiggy,1 point,Mon Jan 26 20:37:25 2015 UTC,Thanks for the advice! I was just thinking of how much of a time drain it would be to find RAs while trying to focus on teaching. I think I might just start of focusing on my teaching first semester and going out to different schools and centers to start establishing relationships.
Professors,2td9gy,deltalitprof,8,Fri Jan 23 03:55:57 2015 UTC,Online surveys and students get their grades a week earlier if they complete them. However this means the deadline for completing them is several weeks before the end of the semester.
Professors,2td9gy,coldgator,1 point,Fri Jan 23 04:21:49 2015 UTC,"That sounds like the absolute worst way of doing evals. Holding grades hostage, and giving out the evals too early to get a meaningful eval."

Professors,2td9gy,coldgator,3,Sat Jan 24 21:06:37 2015 UTC,"I don't know of any place that has evals after final grades are in.  What would be useful though is a sort of exit eval given to graduating students. Ask them for comments about their best and worst experiences. You'd get better info if students have had more classes, especially ones that are meant to build on earlier prereqs."
Professors,2td9gy,bl1y,4,Sat Jan 24 21:13:43 2015 UTC,"Online only and accounting for 8% of our total annual evaluation. We get a 4% response rate and use the statistically useless data anyway because... maybe the math department missed that meeting, I don't know."
Professors,2td9gy,UsedToHaveKarma,3,Fri Jan 23 04:14:34 2015 UTC,"My institution (SLAC) does online evaluations with the option for professors to add their own questions. A few years back, when they switched over to online from paper evals, the school provided incentives for the students to complete them, including improved eligibility for housing/parking lotteries.  That year, I am told that over 80% of students participated.  More recently, the response has been about 50%, which we are trying to improve upon."
Professors,2td9gy,zxo,2,Fri Jan 23 04:47:41 2015 UTC,"At both my alma mater (R1) and current institution of employment (Teaching-intensive) we use scantrons with comment sections. As a student, I believed that the comments were transcribed, but soon found out that doesn't happen. Neither university records the comments; both only record the quantitative data."
Professors,2td9gy,irwtgoastsyd,2,Fri Jan 23 04:01:24 2015 UTC,"We do online ones and lots of people have <40% response rates. I tend to have very high response rates (90%+) because I a) give them time in class to do them at the end of the semester and b) explain to my students how much they impact my tenure decision. We get quantitative and qualitative data, and my dean does read the qualitative.  I think the biggest benefit to students would be to make sure all the ratings are public so they know other students will get to read the reviews as well. This currently doesn't happen at my institution. Incentives like releasing grades earlier or raffles are also good (have seen these boost numbers some at previous institutions I was at as a student)."
Professors,2td9gy,at1stsite,2,Fri Jan 23 05:34:59 2015 UTC,"Is there a reason that you can't flat out require them? At my university it is common for profs to classify the course evaluation as participation points, or if they are feeling generous even offer up some extra credit. Our system is set up so that we can see who has filled out the evaluations but the responses are still anonymous. Even if you can't see who has filled them out you could offer 5 points of EC to everyone if > 90% of the class fills them out, or something along those lines."
Professors,2td9gy,digshake,2,Fri Jan 23 05:51:18 2015 UTC,My school is investigating some company that supposedly has ways of getting high response rates. We currently do paper except for our online courses. I think the response rate varies quite a bit and is obviously higher in person (maybe 50%?). They recently had the online students blocked from their course material until they completed them. From what I understand the students were pretty pissed. I like the idea of making them public. Students are using Rate My Professor anyway.
Professors,2td9gy,bitchwithacapital_C,2,Fri Jan 23 06:24:39 2015 UTC,"We do scantrons in class about two weeks before the end of the semester. It's administered by either the TA or students in the class. I've always had every student in the class complete it but occasionally a student or two are absent that day (so, 95-100% response rate). There is a comment box on the form as well. A few weeks after the end of the semester (after final grades are submitted), I get a scanned copy of all the responses and a summary of the aggregate scores."
Professors,2td9gy,IAMAgentlemanrly,2,Fri Jan 23 06:41:01 2015 UTC,"At my school of 18,000 the professors hand out scantron sheets with questions and the back side is for commentary and then leaves the room.

Professors,2td9gy,pentad67,1 point,Wed Jan 28 00:44:12 2015 UTC,"We still do the pencil and paper ones. I think they might be recorded electronically now instead of requiring so many staff hours, but I'm not positive.

Professors,2td9gy,runningQ,1 point,Fri Jan 23 09:32:01 2015 UTC,"The most effective method I've ever seen was at ITT Tech. They publish a list to the Dean every week with percentages of students having completed the survey and the names of students who had not. If a class was below the target the Dean would email the list to the instructor, who could then tell the students ""hey, please complete this.""  But no one could see the actual survey until after the semester was over.   If you're doing online survey's it's also important to have a scheduled class session in the lab. Then the instructor can just end 10 min early and have the students fill out the survey then. If you don't walk them to a computer, it won't get done."
Professors,2td9gy,bl1y,1 point,Fri Jan 23 17:31:21 2015 UTC,We use a mix of scantron and narrative forms. Response rate is basically the same as attendance.
Professors,2td9gy,BrashMagician,1 point,Fri Jan 23 17:52:41 2015 UTC,"Ours are done online (one via Qualtrics and one via a module in our LMS). The single greatest influence on the completion rate is whether faculty give students class time to do them (and perhaps mention their importance) or just say ""please do this at some point."" In the earlier scenario we regularly see 80-95% completion. In the latter I think the response is usually low enough (<50%) that it isn't statistically valid."
Professors,2td9gy,threw_away5,1 point,Fri Jan 23 21:25:27 2015 UTC,"We do pen and pencil forms in class, so there is a 100% response rate if the students are all attending class that day.

Basically all the questions come from my extensive notes that I discuss in class. Notes come from random, interesting, and reputable sources of information about various topics.   Now-a-days there is so much free material online that it subscribing to a text and spending $200 for it seems unwarranted."
Professors,2td6iy,runningQ,2,Fri Jan 23 03:45:20 2015 UTC,"I teach at a community college. Most of my students will be transferring. I know that advisors on other campuses use the textbook to judge the quality of the class. For example, I know that our local university checks to see if the textbook is written by someone in the field with a PhD.   This is probably not your situation. However, do you have any sense that making the textbook optional affects the transferability of your course?  Because I like this option."
Professors,2td6iy,runningQ,2,Fri Jan 23 15:46:23 2015 UTC,"What state do you teach in?  I can't imagine faculty looking at the text to judge a courses suitability since different faculty members may use different books. Transferability is based on the course (objectives) and not the class.  Here in CA we submit our courses to the Cal State and they evaluate it for transfer. It rarely even goes to the faculty member over there, it's done at the registrar. UCs have their own system, but it's still not based on the book.  BTW, if this course is taken by enough students you can call the publisher and negotiate. We teach technology and my Dept. Head has gotten great rates on all our books. I don't think we have any general tech courses with a book over $100, and that's with the online key.  You can also ask them about doing a custom book, the price per page is usually cheaper and you can take out chapters that you don't cover."
Professors,2td6iy,digshake,2,Fri Jan 23 17:37:58 2015 UTC,"I'm in Minnesota. It's not faculty judging the class; it's transfer advisors. That's the issue. They have a standardized protocol that includes looking at the textbook.  I currently have a textbook that's $120 so I felt o.k. about the book. But I blew my stack the other day because our librarians are suddenly afraid to put textbooks on reserve for fear of competing with our bookstore. So students who are really broke don't have that option anymore. grrr.... Now, I don't even want to deal with the bookstore."
Professors,2td6iy,Allergic_to_Grains,3,Fri Jan 23 18:02:23 2015 UTC,"Don't you guys have transfer agreements with local universities?  The librarian issue should be easy to solve, just keep emailing up the chain until it's not worth someone's time to argue with you. Point out that Harvard has course books on reserve. State that it might endanger your accreditation (it won't, but they don't know that). And finally talk about how it undermines the institutional mission.   Eventually you'll hit a VP who'd rather not have that conversation, and they certainly don't want to make a statement in email that implies that they don't support students. They'll agree with you just to go on with their day. It's a monstrous pain in the ass, but that's the solution."
Professors,2td6iy,Allergic_to_Grains,2,Fri Jan 23 18:25:23 2015 UTC,"I second the suggestion to use an open textbook if you can find one that is appropriate.  I prefer to go without a text if possible. I find that a large portion of my students simply won't read it anyway and while some of this may be due to laziness, I believe a large part of it has to do with different people having different learning styles. Some things to keep in mind if you do decide to go this route:   You have to provide something for them to read. Hopefully you can pull from free online sources but if not then write something yourself (preferably not just the powerpoint slides). Some students just learn better from reading than from listening. Encourage your students to take notes. Writing things down goes a long way towards learning material. This will also help fill the gap of having reading material as they can always go back and read their notes. Give them lots of practice problems. Some students will buy the textbook just for the practice problems, so this is another gap that needs to be filled. I like to have them work on practice problems in class and then send them home with another set of practice problems to work on.   As another commenter suggested, keeping the textbook optional is also a good move. That way people who want something tangible to learn from can get one but people who don't learn that way don't feel obligated to spend money just to carry around a book that they won't use."
Professors,2td6iy,Allergic_to_Grains,2,Fri Jan 23 05:45:45 2015 UTC,"I don't know why but I have been oddly blessed with students who read and take notes. It's a mystery to me; if I could bottle it, I would.  I do like that optional textbook idea; it would be easy to supplement it with free readings that were assigned so everyone was on the same page."
Professors,2td6iy,Allergic_to_Grains,1 point,Fri Jan 23 15:51:33 2015 UTC,I get my students to read the material by giving a quiz on the readings every week. They cannot pass the class if they do poorly on the quizzes.

Professors,2taito,UsedToHaveKarma,2,Thu Jan 22 16:37:22 2015 UTC,"3 hour lectures. The first time, I'm collecting and making ancillary materials (visuals, videos, related music and art, handouts, diagrams, whatever), outlining, writing, and designing. On repeat delivery, I just check things over to refresh my memory, update if necessary, and check that stuff is working."
Professors,2taito,bl1y,5,Thu Jan 22 18:24:09 2015 UTC,"It depends on a lot more variables than just whether or not you've given the lecture before.  Are you going to stand and talk without break, or will you be calling on students, soliciting questions, etc?  How well do you know the material you're going to be discussing?  How important is it for you to hit specific points of information? (For instance, if you're in a history lecture, you may need very specific data in your lecture. In a literature class, you may just need any discussion of the text with very few specifics.)  How tight are you time constraints? If you don't get to everything, can you pick up in the next class? If time runs short, do you have material to pad out the class with?  I'll have a class coming up discussing whether a burrito is a sandwich. I suspect it'll take about 10-20 minutes to prep for an hour and fifteen minute class. But, the class is discussion based, not lecture, so I just need a few ideas to spark conversation."
Professors,2taito,VonPapen54,2,Thu Jan 22 15:24:04 2015 UTC,"I agree, there are many other variables to consider.  When I first started teaching I used to over-prep, fearing that if a student asked an obscure question I couldn't answer my credibility would be done for (which of course isn't the case).  I've taught my classes several times now, so I usually take 10-15 minutes to look through my lecture notes before class.  However, when I first started creating my class or planning lectures, it depended on how much I knew already knew about the topic, and how much extra research or planning I needed."
Professors,2taito,bl1y,3,Thu Jan 22 16:36:45 2015 UTC,"if a student asked an obscure question I couldn't answer my credibility would be done for   Oh Jesus. Don't we all have that fear? Students ask me about MLA citations, and hell if I know. I just have to tell them to look them up."
Professors,2taito,bl1y,2,Thu Jan 22 16:47:52 2015 UTC,"Totally, good point.  I teach large sections of second year courses, so discussion-based isn't a huge option. I can work it in, but these are more activities that come up perhaps twice in a 3 hour lecture. When I stand and lecture, I do use the Socratic method, but more as in, ""Why might this happen?"", get a one-sentence answer, and then take it from there. I am doing most of the talking. I also teach science courses, including some physiology, which requires diagrams of cells & anatomy as well as graphs, so slides are not optional.  So make the assumption that you are teaching a STEM class of around 200 students, with little discussion, and they are 3 hours each. Could you make an estimate for how much time you would spend prepping if you're teaching it for the first time, or teaching it for the second or third time?"
Professors,2taito,Rhizobium,3,Thu Jan 22 16:42:23 2015 UTC,"One remaining variable will be what sort of material you're working from. Is your lecture following a chapter in a text book? If not, can you find a text book to serve as the outline? That will cut your time down by a lot.  Starting completely from scratch, I'd predict around 10-20 hours of prep time, including a read through of the lecture to look at timing.  As for the second time, if you've got a good script/outline/whatever, it could take as little as half an hour to review your notes."
Professors,2taito,digshake,3,Thu Jan 22 16:54:48 2015 UTC,"1) I've put in five to ten hours of prep per hour of lecture for new subjects in the past.  So based on your criteria, fifteen to thirty hours.  2) For classes I've taught three times or more, it's closer to ten minutes prep per hour of lecture.  Thirty minutes, based on your criteria."
Professors,2taito,Allergic_to_Grains,3,Thu Jan 22 21:46:23 2015 UTC,"Thank you! I keep hearing this 1-3hr of prep/hr of lecture, and I keep thinking, for real? Like really really? That can't be right.   I can't do less than six hours prep per hour of lecture. I'm good at my job - I teach well and it's evidence-based teaching - but I don't know what/how other people are doing this so fast."
Professors,2taito,Allergic_to_Grains,3,Thu Jan 22 22:36:10 2015 UTC,"Its usually 2 hours of prep per 1 hour of lecture time for me, though that time probably doesn't include the amount of time I spend thinking about things and planning it out in my head before the actual prep takes place.  Other factors can increase / reduce this time significantly. I'm a big fan of sprinkling practice questions throughout my lectures because not only do the students benefit from the practice and enjoy the break from me talking at them, coming up with the problems is generally very quick and easy, and the time I devote to the problems is flexible - I can have them fill up a lot or a little time as needed.  The prepwork itself is a three step process. Select a topic and gather materials, turn those materials into an outline, augment the outline with additional notes / talking points. My outlines generally become my powerpoint slides, as I don't like my slides to be too dense, which saves me a ton of time.  I save all of my annotated slides so that if I ever teach the course again I can refer back to them. Even if I decide to tweak the slides or redo my annotations, I can typically have 3 hours of stuff ready in 30 minutes to an hour.  Hope this helps!"
Professors,2taito,mindiloohoo,2,Fri Jan 23 05:29:27 2015 UTC,"For the first time it takes me about six hours to prepare for a three hour class.

Professors,2t8o45,bl1y,3,Thu Jan 22 02:33:23 2015 UTC,"This would seem to be the most important part (sorry for the caps, it's in the original):   (b) (I) WHEN COURSE ASSIGNMENTS ARE AVAILABLE, EACH COLLEGE SHALL PERMIT FACULTY MEMBERS TO TEACH UP TO A FULL-TIME WORKLOAD, WITH PREFERENCE GIVEN FIRST TO FACULTY MEMBERS WHO WERE HIRED ON A FULL-TIME BASIS PRIOR TO THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THIS SECTION, AND SECOND TO FACULTY ON THE BASIS OF SENIORITY.   I know a big problem for a lot of adjuncts is getting enough courses to teach in order to pay their bills, so being able to work full time at a single school is great. That said, I wonder how it will actually affect compensation. If you were teaching two classes at $3k a pop, and get to have a 3/3 teaching load, you might still be at $3k each, no? At least you get benefits though."
Professors,2t8o45,bl1y,1 point,Thu Jan 22 03:10:11 2015 UTC,"One of the schools I work at has a 3 tier payment system based off seniority that seems to navigate the issue you point out fairly well. That is to say, using your example, you get paid a (more or less) flat rate per credit hours taught that does not fluctuate, regardless of how much you're teaching. I could only assume it would play out similarly with this proposal (if it passes) as well.    Another interesting wrinkle is the Obama free-community college thing. If that came to pass, then there would be a hella high enrollment. Hard to say, but I've been watching the legislation in Colorado for a few years now, and I've seen a number of bills of this sort step to the plate, each time getting a little more traction. Again, hard to say, but from where I'm sitting, it looks like we're at the beginning of one of those 'era-defining' chapters where education is gonna get a serious make-over (for better or worse)."
Professors,2t8o45,UsedToHaveKarma,2,Thu Jan 22 03:40:44 2015 UTC,"I don't know if the free community college thing (if it even passes) would really increase enrollment that much. I just looked up tuition at Montgomery Community College (Maryland) and it's $158 per credit. On the one hand, that's hella cheap. On the other hand, people without even community college education might not easily be able to scrape together $500 for a class.  If anything increases enrollment, I think it'd be the President taking out some of the stigma of community colleges.  I remember when I was graduating from high school (2002), a lot of people planned to do 1-2 years in community college to get their gen ed requirement out of the way cheaply, and then transfer to a big state four year university. And that's when state tuition at a 4 year school was only about $4k a year. Despite tuition soaring, it doesn't seem like many people are taking advantage of a year in CC, and I suspect it's because so much more emphasis has been placed on prestige and credentialism.  Edit: Accidentally gave the price for Montgomery County Community College in PA. Montgomery College in Maryland is $180 per credit."

Professors,2t8o45,b-minus,2,Thu Jan 22 03:03:37 2015 UTC,"Is this going to force CO university/colleges to cut back on their offerings because they can't afford to hire that many people full time? That's the definite worry to a bill like this. As an adjunct, it's easy to see why this would be a great thing for us... but what is it going to do to school's budgets?"
Professors,2t8o45,b-minus,2,Thu Jan 22 13:35:45 2015 UTC,"This is very similar (perhaps even identical) to a bill that was introduced in Colorado last year (which did not pass). Simply put, it would bankrupt the Colorado Community College System and wind up hurting more people than it helps. Colorado ranks pretty low in higher education funding, in part due to laws that make it difficult for the state to generate/increase tax revenue. Sure, the state is bringing in a lot of money from marijuana legalization, but education has not seen a dime of that money yet, and when it does, it will mostly benefit K-12. Additionally, the community colleges in the state have been seeing significant declines in enrollment (in some cases 20-25%) in the last couple of years, putting further strains on budgets. We certainly need to figure out a way to more fairly compensate adjuncts, but I am not sure if this bill is the answer."
Professors,2t8o45,TypeAskee,2,Sun Jan 25 16:40:46 2015 UTC,"I also feel the need to add that there is a distinct difference between ""regular faculty"" and ""adjunct faculty,"" not in level of education or quality of teaching, but in scope of roles and responsibilities. In Colorado, regular faculty workload is literally measured as 70% teaching and 30% service. ""Teaching"" includes everything from teaching classes to other teaching-related activities such as curriculum development, assessment, training and mentoring other faculty, contributing to your field through publications or conference presentations, etc. Service includes duties such as serving on committees, membership in campus governance (faculty senate, etc.), community outreach, etc. In short, regular faculty have a lot more responsibilities than adjuncts do. If we define all faculty the same way and compensate them strictly on how many courses they teach, we will create inequities in compensation compared to actual workload and responsibilities. Either that, or regular faculty will have to stop performing their other duties and schools will need to hire more administrators."
Professors,2t8o45,TypeAskee,1 point,Sun Jan 25 17:24:25 2015 UTC,"Also, as far as the marijuana legalization goes, I looked it up and Colorado is hugely in debt, so I'm guessing that there is some money headed that direction too."

If you aren't getting anywhere, then imply (but don't outright lie) that you have been in contact with the dean regarding academic fraud.  Also imply that a confession will lead to more measured consequences.  I've broken a couple of students using this little ploy.  If they fess up, then refer them to your dean.  If they don't break, then you've been beaten.  The thing is, stuff like this bothers me only a little.  Some people are always going to find a way to cheat.  You can't catch them all.

If they can't retell their essay and stress their main points, they get a zero on this essay. I don't want to spend my time and my soul on punishing cheaters; I just want to make it scary enough (upfront!) to discourage potential cheaters from cheating.  The thing is, there are many shades of help. Some people go to perfectly legal, official writing tutors on campus with a half-written essay. Some people are non-native speakers that get help from a friend, but still ""own"" the essay as a work.

The ""author"" under ""properties"" was even a different name, but the student said he used a friend's computer. The difference between the student's in-class writing and even his previous out-of-class essays was profound. However, the dean said it wasn't proof enough.   I have colleagues who just fail these essays, but I just can't bring myself to fail them without the support of the dean.

Doing so puts his/her neck on the line when ultimately its based on your suspicions (whether valid or not). By asking for their support, you're not taking responsibility for failing the student, and asking that they give you administrative cover.   This can work to your advantage though: Just give the student no credit for that test. If you have good reason, and let your chair know, the dean will also not intervene or push that hard on the student's behalf. If they do, the benefit is that'll bring all the evidence against the student forward.   The fact is that you're a trained, experienced, competent professional, and people trust your opinion.

If no proof exists, the dean will not allow the charge, as I mentioned above.   I'm sure it's most if not all schools' policy. There's a high burden of proof on yours and the Dean's part, unfortunately, and students can do a lot in terms of academic dishonesty before ever reaching that burden. Everyone's aware of that, and so I think there's an informal understanding that gives instructors the leeway in responding to academic dishonesty through penalties like failing specific papers. I'm sure what's understood 'informally' can vary a lot from school to school, though, so YMMV.  I actually find this to a better course of action, however, because it provides an opportunity to a student to be disciplined without actually taking it another level with much severer consequences. If they accept responsibility, and take the hit, and not do it again at least for your course, it's accomplished it's purpose. If they don't accept, it moves up the chain anyway.   I definitely empathize with your situation. I wish deans enforced academic integrity more. That's my 2 cents."

And I trudged along at grad school and then worked at various adjunct positions and then suddenly, inexplicably, I WAS that person. And decades later, I still love it.   There's this moment in Talking Funny where Jerry Seinfeld talks about what inspired him to become a comedian, and it reminds me of what inspired me to be a professor:  JS: Really success wasn’t my objective; it was just I wanted to be one of “those guys”. If I could be one of those guys, I win everything. … Once I stepped on the first time, that’s it, I’m now one of these guys, I’m just gonna keep doing this.  RG:  And is that because you wanted to hang out with comedians or…  CK: You wanted that to be your identity, you wanted to be one of those people. Yeah, I started in Boston and there were these comedians and they were like Olympus, this group of guys, and I wanted to be one them. And I didn’t care if I sucked at it.  JS: That’s right.

Professors,2sbeu5,ShannonOh,2,Wed Jan 14 00:58:09 2015 UTC,"Hahah I like that it is existential.   Yes, I spoke to a couple of newly starting Assistant profs. at my university. They were both quite pessimistic about the way things were, but I think they were hoping that things would get better when they were at the next step (the lure).   However, I did get a feel that they were significantly less oriented towards general science curiosity (reading, learning new techniques, etc.) than I am, and were more interested in attaining academic heights in their fields (all power to them).  For me there is no question of quitting the PhD, I love the project I am working on and things are working well. I am just concerned about being in a rat-race where after a lot of struggle and winning you're still a rat, and it may not be as satisfying as one may have imagined."
Professors,2sbeu5,ShannonOh,3,Wed Jan 14 01:50:23 2015 UTC,"One decision aid is to consider your alternatives. Prof may not be ideal, but is there anything better? If you do anything that could translate to marketing or OB, go work at a business school where you don't have to chase funding at the same level.  A prof once told me that there are scholars and there are publishers, and rarely the two are found in one person."
Professors,2sbeu5,ShannonOh,1 point,Wed Jan 14 01:53:21 2015 UTC,"Wow that quote was scary and useful at the same time.  I spoke to a business assist. prof., and he highly recommended I apply to business schools. That is definitely and option, but I'll be shooting blind because I haven't taken any classes in the business dept., nor do I know the climate and culture in those places.  Perhaps someone from Business can pitch in?"

Professors,2sbeu5,Poobiedog,3,Wed Jan 14 06:49:07 2015 UTC,"I graduated from biz school and start as an assistant professor (r1) this summer. I work with some folks who came over from psych. Happy to chat. There are lots of openings at biz schools but there are hurdles if your phd is in psych. One benefit is intellectual diversity in the department: I work with sociologists, psychologists, and economists, and they have different perspectives on common problems. The pay is great (eg, I will start at 177). There are serious downsides, though. And, yes, many people still read narrowly and stay in line with prevailing  publishing norms. There is a lot to pressure to publish in a select set of journals and these journals are interested in a limited set of outcomes. Ironically, I feel like I could be more of a scholar if I went for an r2."
Professors,2sbeu5,FGF10,1 point,Wed Jan 14 05:06:58 2015 UTC,thanks for offering to chat  I'm sure others would be curious to hear about the hurdles as well.
Professors,2sbeu5,Namemedickles,3,Wed Jan 14 06:57:20 2015 UTC,"The major hurdle you'll face pertains to the journals in which you publish. Business schools are very particular about this (and it annoys me). Given your background, r1 research business schools will want you to publish in: ASQ, AMJ, OS, MS, or PP and JAP. The latter two -- Personnel Psychology and Journal of Applied Psychology -- are probably best suited to your work but I have no idea if you try to publish there. There is more flexibility at r2 schools but less than you'd think.  Another hurdle pertains to your professors' networks. There are lots of jobs but also lots of candidates and professors' networks at the hiring school can give you a serious edge. Compared to students coming out of business schools, my guess is that your advisors and mentors have comparatively few connections throughout business schools.   Yet another hurdle pertains to your teaching capabilities out of the gate. It's true that schools emphasize research over teaching, but they want people who can come in and teach management related classes off the bat. People may worry that you can't and so it will be harder to stand out of the pile.  In your PM you asked if there were downsides to my pay being so high.   I don't think there are inherent personal downsides to starting in the high 100s. It's a private school so my colleagues won't know what I earn and vice versa. I didn't pursue my degree for the money. Indeed, I was ignorant about salaries and rising demand for business professors when I started my doctoral degree (I started right after undergrad). If there are personal downsides, it's more a function of school and the associated expectations.    Philosophically, I do think there are broader sociological downsides associated with my pay. Business schools pay well because: 1) We're marketable in the private sector, so schools have to compete against high-paying companies; 2) Lots of people are enrolling in MBA programs, which brings in a lot of funding. More and more schools want to have a decent business school so demand for professors goes up further (and our pay in turn).   There are pressing issues for science (e.g., global warming; understanding where we came from and our place in the universe; understanding how social institutions create and perpetuate inequality and how to ameliorate it). However, the knowledge that we produce is not inherently more useful than other disciplines. My concern, as a spectator, is that demand for business school professors will lure bright people away from fields that are equally or more intellectually rigorous and important but less secure and often lower paying."
Professors,2sbeu5,gcheliotis,1 point,Wed Jan 14 14:42:08 2015 UTC,"Thank you for that very elaborate response. I'm sure it'll be helpful to many redditors in the future as well.  Do you feel as though you could at least potentially find time to read work unrelated to your field and upgrade your science skills like learn programming, if you wanted to? I ask because I assume a higher pay implies higher  level of sacrifices and demands. In that case business schools wouldn't solve the issue for me.   But from your mentioned points seems like business schools might actually be well suited for me. Thanks again."
Professors,2s9d3l,FGF10,4,Tue Jan 13 07:23:56 2015 UTC,"/u/silverdae is right.  The easiest thing is to pick some overarching topic and then pick a paper a week to read.  If you need a ""syllabus"" for the class, then it is just your list of readings.  Either have the student write a weekly summary/reflection or write a final review paper on the overarching topic for the end of the semester.  You could go back and forth with the veterinarian doing a basic science paper one week and a clinically applied paper the next.  You should easily be able to spend an hour each week going over a paper in depth and talking about the background.  As for the student being prepared, I would model what you would expect the first week.  You lead the discussion of the article.  The next week, let the student lead, but with lots of leading/prompting questions.  Ween off until the student sounds like a grad student talking at a journal club."
Professors,2s9d3l,manova,3,Tue Jan 13 15:58:47 2015 UTC,"Do a literature review.  Say each week they read a paper and summarize it, then the two of you discuss it."
Professors,2s9d3l,silverdae,1 point,Tue Jan 13 15:00:02 2015 UTC,"Does your school have a relevant colloquium or seminar series? You could have the student attend the seminars, write summaries, discuss, etc. Perhaps pair that with some independent literature review."

If the publication is such that you can change the affiliation (hell, even stuff that you've already had accepted that you're waiting on proofs for), then it's legit.  I'm a brand new TT Ast Prof at an R1, and I was told this by literally everyone I asked, including dean-level folks and my dept. chair."
Professors,2s87g3,runplato,2,Tue Jan 13 01:31:40 2015 UTC,"Thanks. It's interesting that you and secret_tiger101 have different views on this. It might be a UK thing. My degree and job are in the US. I was worried about this in part because a UK-based professor told a third-party co-author (on a separate paper, a few years ago) that she had to use her old affiliation for a forthcoming pub. She was annoyed about it because she was in a similar position -- starting the tenure climb at a new job. By contrast, my advisor told me I could put my new uni, and that it wasn't a big deal. He's an old guy and I'm not sure he's up-to-date with the norms."

Professors,2s87g3,manova,2,Tue Jan 13 04:18:36 2015 UTC,"My degree and job are also US.  I think it's not surprising that it varies by location -- since a lot of this is about granting ""credit"" to people who were funding you and whatnot. (Cf. the practice in Asia where you'll list as an author people who are just directors of your research group, or deans of your school/unit/etc., just because they're paying some bills for you.) I'd be shocked, though, if you got any flak for putting your new affiliation on anything that you had the opportunity to change after you heard about your position.  (Aside because I don't think it's been said yet: CONGRATS. This is a Good Problem To Have(TM).)"

Professors,2s87g3,dewgazi,3,Tue Jan 13 04:37:35 2015 UTC,"I would put the new university.  Truth is, it is playing the tenure game.  I slow rolled several papers while I was interviewing for jobs so that they all hit in my first semester of my job.  This gave me a 5 paper buffer in my first year.  Since there were co-authors from my previous job, the old affiliation was still on the paper.  I just went and looked at those papers.  It seems I was not consistent.  One paper was a collaboration that had nothing to do with my old lab.  I only have my new job listed.  In the 4 that came out of my old lab, I listed both affiliations, old a new.  On the two where I was first author, one, I have a note where the work was done (e.g. manova a,b and in notes, b institution where work was performed).  On my other first author, I did not indicate anything.  On the other two where I am a middle author, I just have both affiliations."
Professors,2s87g3,redbnr22,4,Tue Jan 13 16:30:47 2015 UTC,"From my experience in the UK I would put the old employer, as that was where the research was undertaken. Can you not just put two affiliations?  Or affiliation, old uni. But contact details new uni..."

Professors,2s87g3,BehemothTheCat,3,Tue Jan 13 19:36:31 2015 UTC,Put the uni next to your name where the work was done.   Your new uni information should be given as your corresponding author section.

Professors,2s34em,neofaust,12,Sun Jan 11 19:45:43 2015 UTC,"Fair warning: I have not read the actual announcement from Pres. Obama, only followed some of the media reports about it, and we know how accurate those can be sometimes. So I understand I could be getting something wrong.   With that:    First of all, there's no way this becomes reality with a Republican-controlled Congress, so this is all purely, um, academic.  I'd rather see the money be put into improvements in K-12 education, which would prepare students to go to college (community or otherwise), graduate at a higher rate and in less time, and therefore save students a lot more than the cost of two years of CC.  For that matter, I'd also like to see the money be spent on improvements in public preschool. IIRC there are studies that show that preschool has a major impact on future academic success, and again that leads to improved preparation for college further down the road, including those who do not choose to attend community colleges.  I fear this would have a serious, negative impact on four-year institutions like mine, who already are seeing increasing numbers of first-year students opt to take the first two years of their coursework at a CC and then transfer in. I teach at a 4-year public university and we are doing the best with what we have, but money is tight. I am OK with the concept of competing for students, and with the concept of market forces at work in higher ed, but paying for students to attend CC for two years would really hit us hard. I would imagine a lot of instructors would be laid off, and I think the ones who would be first to go are the adjuncts and part-time people who already have it bad enough. I was discussing this with a friend who teaches at a private SLAC and he really thinks that this plan might cause a lot of SLACs to go out of business. (And again, maybe if the market can't support expensive SLACs, then so be it -- but then why should the government make things easier by providing free CC tuition?)  I'm sort of at a loss to understand what problem this solves. Is it the problem of affordability? In that case, why not provide Americans with something that has more portability, like a $10K interest-free loan that can be used at any public institution, CC or otherwise and paid back over 10 years? Is granting free CC tuition the best solution to this problem? Has Obama even thought in these terms?    Aside: That figure of $10K comes from the fact that the average annual in-state tuition to attend CC in my state (Michigan) is a little over $5,000. (source)   One thing I do like about all this is that it opens the door for more people to become educated in skilled trades, training in which is one of the great services that community colleges provide. However I haven't heard any specific mention of skilled trades in a description of the program itself. That could be ignorance on my part, but if an explicit mention of skilled trades isn't being made, why not?   TL;DR The money would be better spent on fortifying public preschool and K-12 education; there could be serious unintended (?) consequences for 4-year institutions; and aside from opening up skilled trades to more people it's difficult to see how this doesn't cause more issues than it solves."
Professors,2s34em,Rtalbert235,6,Mon Jan 12 03:04:59 2015 UTC,"As a CC adjunct, I say ""yes, please"" as it would force CC to fill their vacant full-time positions and add more staff. Not that I don't agree with what you say about the state of K-12 public education and I agree that with the current state of congress, it won't happen."
Professors,2s34em,Magnificats,3,Mon Jan 12 09:59:41 2015 UTC,This was my thought too. More college students means more jobs teaching college students which means i might finally find a tenture-track job.

Professors,2s34em,Magnificats,3,Mon Jan 12 21:15:21 2015 UTC,"I agree with everything said here and would add in the caveat of emphasis on trade schools in highschool. I attended highschool in Central Florida where trade school weren't available and only one ""tech"" school per county (ended up taking a 90 minute bus ride to and from school).

And then, at least in my case, you also don't quite believe them, and get a paranoid conspiracy theory arising in your head that they only tell you they liked the class because they hope it will improve your attitude to them. And that maybe you'll give them a better grade. While actually they don't care, and just hate the class.  And then you enter this internal struggle where one half of your mind tells you ""You should believe in people! They told you they liked the class! So it must be true!"", and another half says ""But remember that class when they accidentally played a youtube video with sound, and then rolled their eyes. They hate the class! They are just politicking"". And then the third half shouts: ""Shut up you both, just carry on with your teaching load, it will be OK, you can't make everybody happy!"".  And then every time you meet this student, you feel confused, and you try to overcompensate for that by being extra nice. But you also have this voice at the back of your head that tells you that maybe you don't actually sound nice, but sound creepy and condescending, mocking almost. Because if they like the class and you are nice, then it is fine; but if they hate the class and have a clue that you know it, then you are being mocking right now...  tldr: I'm not sure I can read their body language."

If it comes to it, I make a ridiculous face or a silly noise or something like that as a sort of check.

Professors,2rnqvw,AerosolHubris,6,Thu Jan 8 00:00:28 2015 UTC,"Just about every semester a similar group sends out spam email to our faculty letting us know days they'll be on campus and offering to buy our unwanted textbooks (they often specifically mention teacher's editions, and sometimes mention a plan to provide the books at low low costs for undergrads). It's against our uni policy to sell the books, it's against the publisher's agreement that comes with pretty much all desk copies these days to sell the books, and it's shady as hell all around. Per admin directive, our default is for anyone who actually sees these people on campus to notify campus police to have them removed."

A lot of negative attitude probably comes down to ""it's not you; it's them"".  I teach a variety of classes, including some required first year Gen Ed classes, and the Gen Ed students are often the toughest audience. They don't want to take the class, and you're the face of authority, so even though it's not your fault, they focus their dislike on the whole experience on the prof.  There are lots of things you can do to improve your evals, but you can't make all your students like you.

The Torment of Teaching Evaluations has some great evidence-based tips as well. A study titled ""Fudging the Numbers""  makes a convincing case for handing out chocolate during evaluations.   There will always be students who resent having to do college-level work, and will punish you for it on the evaluations.

Professors,2rnlyc,invisiblecows,3,Tue Jan 13 18:07:20 2015 UTC,"I also teach Communications. I often reflect that I'm kind of like a stand-up comedian with all the right moves and yet saddled with terrible, terrible material. There are, let's face it, limited ways to make communications interesting to students who aren't (in my case) specifically going to school for a Comm degree.   At any rate, for every class, some students are just not going to buy in. Sometimes they constitute a large portion of a given class; sometimes, toxic feelings within a small group manages to infect a larger portion of the class. My solution to this is simple: lecture to the people in your class who have bought in. Lecture as if you're in front of a bunch of people who think you are brilliant and funny. Don't ignore feedback, but don't let it poison your style, either.   As far as assignments go, remember that in even the best classes, there's only going to be a few people who are actually enthusiastic for homework. I don't care if they don't like the assignments, but God help them if their lack of enthusiasm translates into shoddy work. University is not Happy Fun Time, and you're not always supposed to enjoy actual work.  This brings me to my next point concerning marking. As for getting assignments back on time - screw them. No, really: marking English/Comm assignments takes a long time, if you're going to do it right. I'll take a long as I like to mark their assignments (within reason, of course) and if they don't like it, let them take math or science or some other damn course where a Scantron machine does all the work. This is especially true if, as an adjunct, you aren't even getting paid to mark. You also need to take your time because, in a class with satisfaction issues, you need to make sure that every mark you give or don't give is fully justified.   Yes, word concerning you might have gotten around, but keep in mind that most students are willing to form their own judgement of you based on what you do in the classroom. Do your thing; focusing on the teaching; don't fret about marking."

Professors,2rfpgp,galileosmiddlefinger,3,Mon Jan 5 23:59:39 2015 UTC,"The thing is most professors are completely unaware of how they are coming across. So s/he doesn't necessarily realize that they are taking up so much time with discussions that aren't necessary. I used to have an entire lab meeting where the first 20-30 minutes were completely useless but showing up late was frowned upon. I just sat through it and made to-do lists until things picked up. On the other hand, it could be that your professor doesn't get a lot of social interactions outside of the lab and enjoys these chats immensely. Point being - professors have so many quirks that are usually not worked out like they are in other jobs (because you are your own boss for most of your career and getting tenure just relies you be good at ONE thing and everything else can be a combination of oddities). And as someone who depends on them for so much it's just something you have to learn to deal with as best you can.

One of the senior colleagues in my department literally talks in circles, moving through a discussion and then looping around repeatedly to make the same points. We junior folks just have a tacit agreement to rescue each other whenever possible with distractions or reminding each other of fake meetings that we need to leave to attend."
Professors,2rbx1t,DearSci3nce,17,Sun Jan 4 20:49:40 2015 UTC,"I'm in a similar boat as you, except a lot of my students camp out in my office to just chat about personal, non-school stuff.  To remedy this, I put a sign up sheet on my door.  Students sign up for blocks of time.  At the end of the time they've signed up for, I politely but firmly remind them that their time is up.  This works esp. well if you have students scheduling back-to-back, cause you can just say that the next student is due. I also have an ""almost anytime by appointment"" statement in my syllabi about meetings.  If a student emails to request an appointment outside of office hours, I ask them to very explicitly explain A) What the meeting is to be about, and B) Why they can't come during my normal 8-10 hours of office hours.  Often I can fix the problem via email.  Otherwise, about half the time I can remind them that sports, clubs, dining hall hours, and nap times are not valid excuses to meet outside of my office hours.  One other thing - this sounds dickish, but when students try to show off in front of me, I just don't respond.  I let them talk about whatever they're trying to impress me with as long as they want, without any response or validation.  The trick is, you have to be excellent at deciding whether a student is genuinely trying to engage you or if they're just boasting or sucking up.  Once they realize you aren't buying in to their bullshit, they'll stop sucking up all your time.  Really, you just have to be kind of a hard ass.    EDIT: I use 10 minutes increments on my sign up sheet...I would say 80% of all class-related questions can be remedied in 10 minutes or less."

Professors,2rbx1t,FGF10,2,Sun Jan 4 23:22:06 2015 UTC,100% my favorite answer.
Professors,2rbx1t,jfoutz,5,Mon Jan 5 01:32:27 2015 UTC,"Def. for office hours.  I usually start out with a subtle conversational cue. For example, if I'm working with a student who has signed up for 1:00pm to 1:20pm, at 1:18/1:19pm (you know, close to the end), I'll say, ""Okay, we've got two more minutes...are there any last-minute topics we needed to cover in our remaining time?""    If that doesn't work, then you're dealing with a student who isn't respecting the schedule you've laid out, which - to my mind - gives me permission to be more firm.  A minute after their time ends, I am more likely to say, ""Okay, we've gone over our time.  If you still have questions, check the sign up sheet outside to schedule additional time.""  If Amar is being a real pain in your ass, get an egg timer and be done with it.  The needs of some maladjusted, vain, needy, and/or struggling students shouldn't preclude you from fulfilling your responsibilities to their classmates.  It can be jarring to students, especially if they are accustomed to unfettered access to their professors, but it works if you can be firm about your expectations."

Professors,2rbx1t,mephistoA,1 point,Mon Jan 5 16:33:34 2015 UTC,"I tend to wind up the conversation by asking if I have answered their question.

Professors,2rbx1t,mail124,5,Mon Jan 5 04:03:52 2015 UTC,How do you get students to come? All of my students rush at the last minute (before a report or exam). How can I get them to come weeks before that stuff is due?
Professors,2rbx1t,mrshemingway,3,Sun Jan 4 21:47:39 2015 UTC,"I think part of it is that I have so many students. Two percent of 700 students is still 14 students who potentially want to meet with me every week x 30mins each, and that's a full day of meetings every week.  However, I will admit that it is partly my own fault... I have recently changed the way I use TA hours. I don't have enough hours to have TAs come to lecture, which is critical when about 30% of lecture material is from outside of the textbook. I used to tell students to go to the TA office hours or come to my office hours with questions, but then I would get students complaining that the TAs couldn't answer their questions. Waste of time for everyone.  So now I budget all of their time toward the assignments. Then I tell students that if they have questions about the material they should come to my office hours, but if they have questions about the assignments, they should see their TAs.   What is annoying is that I didn't expect this consequence because no one went to the TAs' office hours when they DID try to answer content questions!!!!  I really think students assume that if there are TA office hours, they shouldn't bother the prof. If students know TAs might not be helpful, they might decide they just won't go. Eliminate regular TA office hours, and suddenly students see going to the prof as a real & valuable  option. Just speculation.  EDIT: I also work at a school that is very prestigious and very competitive school. Students at my school do everything that they SHOULD do: review notes every night, make new notes, keep up with readings, go meet their profs, go meet their TAs, ask questions in class, answer questions in class (I never hear crickets when I post a question in a 250 per lecture theatre), get volunteer experience, get research experience, etc. I mean, not all of them, but enough of them to sap 7-14 hours from me every week."
Professors,2rbx1t,zazzlekdazzle,7,Sun Jan 4 22:06:34 2015 UTC,"omg, don't ask your TA's to come to your lecture. you are wasting their time. just give them your notes."
Professors,2rbx1t,mephistoA,4,Mon Jan 5 11:15:49 2015 UTC,"One thought based on your comment is that you could try asking your TAs to schedule office hours at the same time as yours. Then the TAs triage questions, sending ones they can't answer into your office. (Or conduct impromptu study sessions of several students arrive with the same issue.)  Something I've done with TAs is ask them to be the first line of communication by email: they're responsible for answering questions & minor administrative matters by email, setting meetings with students when they can help, and only then forwarding the rest to me for response or appointments. It makes for a more distant relationship between me and the students in some ways, but I still see them in class, and it's helpful triage for large courses with difficult content.   Another commenter mentioned this, but I'll reiterate: you don't have to refuse meetings with students. You just have to block out the weekly times that you're unavailable for other reasons. If some of those reasons are ""working alone on project X,"" so be it. You'll just schedule around those conflicts. But that'll be less important because you've already booked the time you need for your own work."
Professors,2rbx1t,paithanq,1 point,Mon Jan 5 02:36:46 2015 UTC,"Make 15min appointments. It's enough for students who are missing some concept but attended class, or to get to know students who want to discuss careers (and get a LOR from you). It is not your job to act as private tutor for those who don't attend class.    Definitely can't stress this enough. Many students don't know how to use office hours effectively, or don't even know how to express themselves when asking for help. I teach college ESL and always encourage students to come to my office for extra explanations, but the few students who did show up were expecting me to give the answer. Hell, some even expected me to correct their essays before handing them it, or proofreading their oral presentations a few hours before class. I've been limiting appoints to 15-20 minutes per person, and it's for the best (for me AND for the students)."
Professors,2rbx1t,VetMichael,2,Sun Jan 4 22:08:46 2015 UTC,"I think there are three issues here.  (1) Setting realistic boundaries.  I do think you can refuse to meet with students. What if a student wanted to meet at the same time as another student who already had an appointment?  What if a student wanted to meet when you had a dentist appointment or after the time you already leave for the day?  What if it was while you were teaching another class or had scheduled a conference call with a co-author of the book you are working on?   The point is, there are just times when you are not and can not be available to the student, and I imagine in these circumstances you say that you can't make it at his/her desired time, but you offer other times.  I think this is one way to deal with the outside of office hours overwhelm.  Set aside times that are for your other work, times for your office hours, and times where you are flexible to see students who can't make office hours.    (2) Using a teachable moment.  I hate that term, but I do think it works here.  One way to look at it is that you aren't really doing these students any favors by letting them comd in and talking your ear off in a meandering way.  A great skill to have as a professional in any field is the ability to meet with colleagues (junior, senior, or peers) and be able to communicate in a way that is clear, concise, and assertive. Demanding, whining, whimpering, or meandering talk are all bad habits best broken at the beginning of their professional career, which is now for them.   You can use this as a way to rein in their blabbing by telling them directly.  Of course you need to be tactful and kind, not to mention direct and assertive yourself in delivering this message.    (3) Getting the chair on your side of the issue.  If your chair is part of the problem, you can alert him/her to the depth of issue in the guise of asking advice on how to manage it.  You might  actually get some good advice, and it's a good way to let him or her know what is really going on in a non-confrontational way.  Plus, people are much more likely to be helpful when they feel you are respecting their experience and authority by asking their advice."
Professors,2rbx1t,Namemedickles,1 point,Mon Jan 5 06:46:10 2015 UTC,"All good points. I will add:   I can't refuse to meet with a student, but I can definitely set the schedule. I might try making these extra appointments at 8am. Students at my school think 9am is a really early class... it's super-weird, I've taught at 3 other schools, and 8am wasn't taboo the way it is here. Do you really need to meet with me? 8am, asshole. Good point. I'm good at being concise, I'm bad at being assertive. My chair is the fucking worst. I would not ask for advice, because it would be something along the lines of, ""why don't you try scheduling office hours every day, and see how that works? You're in on Sundays, right? I bet students would love that."" And then when I DON'T do that, it would be awkward. I ask my chair for as little advice as possible for exactly that reason - in the past it's resulted in mountains of work."
Professors,2rbx1t,Russiophile,2,Sun Jan 4 23:30:23 2015 UTC,"here are some tips:  make office hours by appointment only, then only the people who need help will make an appointment.   always make it like you are very busy, give them only 1 or 2 possibilities to meet. then offer to resolve their problems via email.   when all else fails, and you do have to meet, say that you have a meeting before, and always show up late. this will deter future meetings."

There are occasionally ethics issues that come up about accepting gifts; it can be awkward to be the recipient if he/she has to refuse.

There is no way they would want to leave that setting - even adding a new commute 3X a week for a local exchange would take time from their day that they don't have to spare.

Professors,2p2xxq,lawdy_lawd,7,Fri Dec 12 14:42:07 2014 UTC,"I just got off the job market(!) -- i.e., I just landed a TT job (business/econ; R1).   I'm lucky to have landed my top choice school but it was an intense experience and I wish I did a few things different in hindsight.   Here's my advice (no particular order -- just as it pops into my head):    Start preparing your job market materials (e.g., CV, cover letter templates; research statement; teaching statement if you think it'll be required) early. In my field, there is a summer conference where preliminary interviews are held. I was trying to get manuscripts submitted and R&Rs returned. Preoccupied by these things for most of the summer, I was scrambling last minute to compose a cover letter.  I think the initial version of my cover letter was pretty raw. My materials got better as the job season progressed. Still, I would have benefited if I started working on it earlier. I cringe when I read my original cover letter.  My advisor stressed to me that my cover letter should strongly convey my identity as a scholar -- and (in my field, at least) distinguish me from my advisor. For major research institutions, it's important that you're leading new directions, rather than riding along as a co-author. This may vary by field and the type of job you're after. I had articles in elite journals where I was a third author and R&Rs in elite journals where I was first or jointly first author. I played up the R&R work (even though the papers may be rejected, in the end) to a much greater extent than the 3rd author work because frankly, it was my own. It defined/set apart my identity.  Lots of stuff happens behind the scenes and there are myriad idiosyncratic things that play into committee interview decisions (not least of which is your advisors' personal networks). Don't be surprised/offended if you don't hear from a school for which you're very qualified. I sent out, gosh, ~60-70 applications to R1 and R2-type schools. I applied very broadly. There were certain schools for which I felt well or over qualified but I never heard a peep. There were other schools I applied to as an after thought, thinking I was a bad fit or wholly unqualified for the job. I received 7 job talk offers across a range of these schools. Some I would have predicted, perhaps, but others not. As the other posted said, apply broadly.  I sent semi-personalized cover letters to each school. By this I mean I had a paragraph I tweaked to make it relevant to the school/ department/ faculty members. I have a colleague out of UC Berkeley who said he simply did a mail merge with no personalization whatsoever. He ended up at a fantastic place (with zero publications at the time).  Still, I think my advice would be to add some personalization. Someone with experience on a hiring committee could better speak to this. I also wrote much more unique cover letters for different disciplines (again, I applied broadly) -- e.g., I applied to sociology programs and my cover letter incorporated popular sociology theories; I applied to strategy programs and I referenced how my work contributed to theory on organizational strategy. This may be idiosyncratic but perhaps there are useful analogues for your field.  Keep a folder on your computer and then within that folder subfolders for the different schools. At least, that's what I did. It helped me remember what I said to particular schools when they contacted me. For example, I may have said ""I'm ver familiar with research by [FACULTY MEMBER AT SCHOOL]"" and then described (or BS'd) some synergies between our work. It's good to keep an easily accessible record of what you said, to whom.   OH! This is a big one. I should have had this higher: I created a job dashboard in Google Docs. The dashboard listed all openings in my field, deadlines, and a host of other useful information. I filled this out as I progressed through job market season and it helped a lot. I shared the Google Doc with my letter writers so they could keep track of upcoming deadlines, contact people and so on. Helped a lot.  The job talk is a big deal (in my field). Start practicing (publicly) early on. I did a practice job talk at my school and it was a disaster.    Finally, the job market is pretty stressful. Find space to unwind and be with family (if possible). Try to schedule breaks between job talks if you get several (they're exhausting).   Again, some of this may be idiosyncratic to my field, but I hope it helps you. Please feel free to PM me if you have specific questions.   I wish you the very best, stranger."

Seriously, the more organized you are in your job market materials, the better. The only other thing I would recommend is keeping a zip file with your job market materials (cv, teaching statement, research statement, pubs, transcript, etc) saved on your phone. That way, when you're at a conference or whatever, you can quickly and easily and your materials to people you meet and maybe pick up more interviews."

I too used different letter writers based on their relevance to the opening (whether they knew faculty at the school or were most likely to be known by faculty on hiring committee). I was solicited for the job I accepted -- ie strongly encouraged to apply from the hiring chair -- because a professor sent a private email to her saying whatever he said. Networks are so, so important."
Professors,2p2xxq,Poobiedog,3,Tue Dec 23 06:08:07 2014 UTC,"Nothing mind-blowing, but here are a couple of very short tips:   Run your application materials by those who have sat on hiring committees.  For the love of god, make a strong, professional, personalized cover letter. I'm on a hiring committee for the first time and flabbergasted at the quality of many cover letters.   Apply very broadly... even to places you think you might not like. I now teach at an institution I almost didn't send an application to (largely due to location).

Basically, you need to demonstrate that you can write clearly and will continue to do so, that you can teach clearly and will generate majors (which helps the department get more funding), and that you're a person that your colleagues will want to go have lunch with."

The interface is not flashy, but is simple and fairly intuitive. It also presents a log of your actions, which may help accelerate the learning curve for individuals who want to learn the language to perform more complex analyses.   I've recommended PSPP to students and have tested it in a statistics lab course. Our department is considering adopting it for the computer labs & undergrad courses. As a software for lower level classes, I think it's fine. The software has come a long way the last couple of years, but it's still a bit limited for actual research use: the graphing capabilities are poor (but SPSS's aren't very good to begin with either) and some complex and/or modern analyses aren't currently supported. But those weaknesses should change in time and the software is fine for basic stuff (descriptive statistics, t-tests, simple ANOVA). Getting faculty to adopt a new stats software is quite difficult, but PSPP is largely compatible with SPSS (notable exception is that SPSS's newish output files aren't supported). Even so, I'd recommend at least giving the R commander gui a shot first."

Professors,2oiqwe,galileosmiddlefinger,1 point,Sun Dec 7 05:22:34 2014 UTC,"Not useless at all, provided that the professor can attest to some of your qualities and abilities that are relevant to the job or grad program you are targeting. People outside of your discipline can still comment on things like your conscientiousness, ability to work with others, writing or presenting skill, leadership, etc. that recruiters and selection committees want to know.   The most important issue to consider is whether or not the professor knows you well. Good letters are characterized by stories about you so that the professor can show, not tell, about your qualities. A letter that just rattles off adjectives about you is pretty forgettable, but one that provides concrete examples of your performance will stick with the reader.   It's also worth noting that you typically need 2-4 references, and most students simply aren't going to have that many deep relationships with faculty in their major. It's pretty typical for at least some of a student's letter-writers to be from outside of the discipline, so don't look at this as a deficiency in your materials."

If you're in their class for the first time, have never really contributed to class, and/or barely know them, you put them in a weird or awkward position. Most professors want students to succeed, flourish, and seek advice. But there are many students who feel that they can randomly select any particular professor, and that is simply not true. I've had a couple of students do this to me, and I've gotten to the point that I say ""sorry, but I don't know you very well."" This response usually elicits a nod, but occasionally, they get upset or pissed off.  Also, be sure that you ask that professor sometime when they are not super busy (i.e. not midterms or near finals) with class work. Also, be considerate when you remind them; always do so in person and try to gently remind them. Remember they are buried under work of many kinds that you don't normally see: tenure, publishing, presenting, grading, advising, committees, searches, study abroad programs, and so on."
Professors,2oiqwe,Mouse_genome,1 point,Sun Dec 7 18:46:59 2014 UTC,"With at least one month's notice but after the guidelines are posted and/or letter submission process is open (for those that are online). If the letters are required between now and mid-Feb, I'd suggest asking as soon as possible, since holidays, exams and semester changes can add a lot of extra busy days.  If the professor knows who you are by name, sending an email will work as well as in person (sometimes better, since you have the chance to plan it all out, your professor won't be in a rush to anywhere else, and you can provide clickable links or attachments). If you do ask in person, send a follow up email anyways, as even if a professor is happy to provide you a reference, they're unlikely to remember all of the specifics.   Personally, I'd skip the forced compliment - it can be awkward and seem disingenuous, particularly if followed immediately by your request for a favour. This may depend on your existing relationship though."
Professors,2obqbg,GrahamsCrackers,23,Fri Dec 5 02:40:51 2014 UTC,"This is a really tough situation.  First, I think the 'lost assignment' thing is crap. You gave him an easy way to recoup that grade and he didn't follow up. Too bad on him.  Second, the test is a lot harder. I like the idea of asking him to name some of the test questions, but depending on what kind of exam this was, that might not make sense (too easy to say 'you asked about <broad topic area>' or too hard to expect him to repeat a specific math problem). For the test, I might suggest this: Emphasize that you double-checked your records and the tests you have and it is not there, and that your TA never encountered the test either. Then say that you believe the most fair way to handle this is for him to retake the test. OR you could just have his final exam count as double. With this option, yeah it sucks if he already took the test, but it's not going to really disrupt his grade. If he lied and DIDN'T really take the other test, it doesn't really give him an advantage over other students since it's not like he got to pick to drop his lowest grade or something by knowing ahead of time that this would be the solution.  Please let us know what you decide to do and how it panned out later by submitting an update!"
Professors,2obqbg,at1stsite,20,Fri Dec 5 03:23:18 2014 UTC,"He's a liar. Ridiculous coincidence. You have 150 students, and you just happened to lose his test and his assignment, and no one else's? And he was unable to replace the supposedly missing assignment. Yes, it is possible to lose things (though most professors who have been teaching for years and years have never lost an exam), but losing exactly one exam is extremely unlikely.  The tricky part is that although it's clear to me that he's a liar, it's hard to prove it. The easiest thing thing would be to just offer to excuse the missing test (i.e. not count it in his grade). This may sound like a terrible remedy for losing a test, but you'll find that he'll happily accept this arrangement (since he never took it to begin with). And although this would be letting him get away with it, my experience is that the students who pull these kinds of stunts invariably flunk the final exam anyway. Also, you're justified in penalizing him for the missing assignment, since he didn't uphold his promise to resubmit.  Btw, in the future you can avoid this problem by counting the number of students who take the exam and the number of exams you collect. I always do this."
Professors,2obqbg,InSearchOfGoodPun,12,Fri Dec 5 03:56:05 2014 UTC,"Ah, yesssss.... I get that ""I swear I sent it!!"" declaration all the time. That's easy - just ask the student to show you his ""sent"" folder in his email to verify he sent it and by the correct date... That's easy enough - he can show you right there in your office on your computer.   About the exam... If he took the test with all the other students and his test paper was with their and was the only one to get lost, I would call BS on that. Plus he took it 4 weeks into the semester and is now - in finals week - taking care of this. Ah... Sorry it's BS.... He's not doing well and trying to manipulate you into letting you pull up his grade.  Depending on how generous you're feeling, you can have him retake the test but set an appointment within the next few days and when it's convenient for you... And for the paper... Asking him to show you his ""sent"" folder in his email will take care of that right away - if it's actually in his sent folder, you can actually print the original assignment and grade that.  Students come up with all sorts of excuses and stories especially right around this time - finals week. You can be nice about it - I used to be - but it's setting yourself up to be walked all over and creating more work and strife for yourself  Lesson learned... In the future, put something in your syllabus about any grade discrepancies (e.g. missing assignments or test grades) are to be cleared up (and it's the responsibility of the student to do so) within a reasonable (week? Two week?) time frame and no exceptions will be made. It's better to be a hardass on the syllabus and then make exceptions at your own discretion then to be a softy and then have to deal with students trying to play you like a fiddle."

Professors,2obqbg,BrachiumPontis,11,Fri Dec 5 02:54:33 2014 UTC,"UPDATE: (I'm not sure where to put updates, so I'll put it here...still learning the protocol.) Well, this situation has panned out much differently than I thought it was going to. When this student asked to meet with me, his email merely said, ""Can I meet with you during office hours?"" and now I realize I immediately jumped to the conclusion that it was about his missing test. He spoke to me after class today and I found out that the reason he actually emailed me was to find out if he could make up a different test the rest of the class took on Wednesday. He just assumed that the answer would be yes. He stopped me after class to let me know that my office hours weren't going to work for him and could I meet with him Monday at noon because that's what works for him. He also submitted an assignment today that was supposed to describe a particular event on campus (dates of the event and link for the event's site provided on the syllabus) and included a paragraph about how he called his coach to have him figure out when and where the event was.  Well, needless to say, I'm no longer worried that I lost his test. Not one bit. But I'm definitely going to come up with some sort of insurance policy to protect myself and the students if this situation comes up again...counting students and tests, signing in, something like that.

It could be true that he is lying (he most likely is, with the details provided). But, one time a professor lost one of my tests, and he refused to believe that I submitted it. I also had perfect attendance, was never late to class, participated, and was never disruptive. Needless to say, I aced every other test, paper, and final, finished the class with an A, and told him at the end of the semester what he did was unjust, and he apologized and claimed he may have been wrong in his decision making. If a professor makes a mistake, the student should be able to have a strong base to prove it to him. The professor later wrote me a wonderful letter of recommendation. (He was very strict and hard-headed, but he admired my persistence)."
Professors,2obqbg,DearSci3nce,1 point,Sun Dec 7 16:07:57 2014 UTC,"Seriously, the amount of time I spend trying to thwart these kinds of douchebags, who comprise about 1% of the student body, is truly infuriating.  However, I do have a checklist for exams. Students don't sign it – I find that disrupting – but the TA checks ID that's on the desk & adds a check to their name. If a student forgets their ID, they have to come see me and I take a picture of them with my phone, then they have to bring ID to office hours :D  Count the exams, before, during & after. Make sure everything adds up every time. This will also help curb exam theft. If an exam disappeared from a sitting, would you know? You should.  If you can, have students submit assignments via the online management system. It can be a pain to set up, and it can be hard to transition to computer-based marking (although I think that's the way things are going so you might as well get with the program now... and young TAs are already on-board anyway), but it is sooo worth it to avoid arguing with students about what and when they submitted."
Professors,2obqbg,HippityLongEars,9,Sun Jan 4 18:05:12 2015 UTC,"It doesn't matter if he is a liar; it's not worth the he-said she-said if you don't have any status at your school.

If he aces the test, cool."
Professors,2obqbg,jccalhoun,4,Fri Dec 5 05:41:52 2014 UTC,"Exactly. Let's assume you did lose the test. What would you do? I would apologize and have the student take the test again. Since you can't prove he is lying, you can't just give him a zero, so having him take the test over is really the only option I see."
Professors,2obqbg,digshake,5,Fri Dec 5 16:40:20 2014 UTC,"So much depends on the details. How much time passed from when you received the tests to when you graded them? Did they go through anyone else's hands besides yours? I assume you've already retraced where the exam could have been lost and done some searching for it, though hopefully there aren't too many places where it could be.  The fact that it wasn't even graded is a bit suspicious. Exams don't get shuffled around much until it's time to grade them. While I have lost graded exams from time to time, I have never lost an ungraded exam because I usually keep them all together.  Can anyone vouch that the student was at the exam (preferably a TA or proctor)? Do you have any electronic evidence that you could check to see if the assignment was sent in (email, dropbox, etc.)?  Unfortunately the only person who can really make the decision on whether these items were truly lost is you. Best of luck."
Professors,2obqbg,justamathnerd,3,Fri Dec 5 02:59:34 2014 UTC,"If this were me, I'd be extremely suspicious. It's very hard to lose an exam until late in the process for me. Everything stays together until they get graded, and then they immediately go in the gradebook. If a student's test is separate from the main stack, it's because they took it in the testing center on campus (which they must arrange with me beforehand) or they were not there the day I handed everything back (which is still after grades have been recorded).   If you're confident that your grading process doesn't leave any room for tests to ""wander off"" like that, then be very careful...make sure he can prove that he was actually there. The fact that he hasn't sent in a make-up assignment (when he apparently had a finished copy saved ready to do) yet doesn't help his case.  I've only had one case where something like this happened, and it turned out that the test got moved to another class's grading (the piles were momentarily on top of each other), and so I found it quickly and easily.   Talk it through with your TA and make sure you're on the same page about what happens, whatever your decision. If you've got a halfway decent relationship with your department head, you could probably let them know so that the student doesn't have a chance to go to them and catch them off guard."
Professors,2obqbg,Unicormfarts,3,Fri Dec 5 03:26:42 2014 UTC,"To quote House: everybody lies. The test is possible you lost, but if he was telling the truth about the assignment he would have emailed it to you as soon as you asked.  I once had a student who swore she handed an assignment in ""in the office"" until I asked her to come and show me where in the sign-in book her name was. Then she was like ""they must have forgotten to ask me to sign"". Yeah, right.  Easiest way to check is to ask him what his answer was for a couple of questions on the test. Slightly less easy, give him a make-up test. That's more work for you since you have to invent new questions, but if he took the first test, then he should be able to take a variation on it. I wouldn't let him take the same test again, since he could have got hold of a copy."
Professors,2obqbg,invisiblecows,3,Fri Dec 5 03:26:50 2014 UTC,"He's lying.  I normally give students the benefit of the doubt, but the fact that he never re-submitted the missing assignment is a major red flag. Even more damning is the fact that he never even mentioned the missing assignment after you gave him a chance to resubmit.  Tell him you double-checked for his test and it isn't there, so zero. Also, aforementioned assignment is still missing, so zero there too. Try again next semester. Copy your department chair on the whole thing. Stand your ground."

Professors,2obqbg,SolidRambo,1 point,Fri Dec 5 14:47:56 2014 UTC,"He's more likely than not lying. I had similar things happen on two occasions, and I'm only a PhD candidate who has been teaching for a year.   First time around I gave back an assignment after the first test. At the end of it this girl says her assignment is not there. Kind of sensing that she's lying because it's a 40 person class and I have no recollection of her ever coming to class, I say just re-submit it ASAP, but if I don't get it soon it won't be graded. She never sent it, never followed up.  The second time this happened with a different student. He did essentially the same thing, but sent me the paper at the end of the night rather than in the late morning/afternoon (9am class, took til about 9pm to send it). Looking at the properties of the document, it was created that day. So when I received it via e-mail, I asked why that is and that unless there is some sort of convincing explanation, I would not grade it. He never responded.  So honestly you're covered with the assignment. You can figure out if he's lying or not.  But as a few others mentioned, it's pretty hard to do anything about the test. I'm on board with letting him take a make-up test because you can't prove he wasn't there unless there was a sign in sheet or some sort of proof. Like somebody else said, too, chances are this person probably is going to do shitty in the class anyway. He probably won't earn an F in the course, but he will probably get a shitty grade. While it sucks if he is lying (he probably is) and gets to take a make-up, you're kind of stuck.  At the very least you've got an experience that will help you in the future. And honestly I think next semester I'm going to do a sign in sheet just because of this topic."

Just have the student go back and find the original document that he says that he submitted and send it again. Then, check to see the date on which the file was created. For a Word document, here's how you do that. For a PDF, you can use Adobe Reader to do the same thing by opening the file and going to File and then Properties and it will show the creation date.   If the date on which the file was created is past the deadline, then the student is out of luck. Actually more than out of luck -- the student is probably committing academic dishonesty and not only loses credit on the assignment but will need to be reported as well. On the other hand if the assignment was created before the deadline, then it's a legit assignment and you just accept it and grade it.   As for the test, that's tougher because you need an attendance roster to prove that the student wasn't there in the testing period. I've had a situation before where one test paper was accidentally moved into a pile of waste paper that I took to the department's recycle bin, and I had to go dumpster-dive to get it out, so it can happen. Not sure what to tell you about all that, other than try not to let the student's status -- being on the football team, etc. -- bias your thinking.

Professors,2o1bfj,bad_jew,5,Wed Dec 3 12:43:36 2014 UTC,"A bit of background on me real quick : I'm an American Adjunct Mathematics professor with about a year of experience at this point.   When it comes to student's attendance, I tell them on Day 1 that I don't care if they're there or not, but that they will do better if they are in attendance. Furthermore, I've been known to give unannounced quizzes (generally open note, I'm not sadistic) which factors in and are not makeup-able. I've been teaching classes on the smaller side (around 40 students registered), so I generally have an idea who shows up and who doesn't. So when it comes time for them to complain about their grade or want extra credit, I know exactly who it is that hasn't put the effort in to be there.   I've found that if they want good grades, they'll show up. If they don't care as much, then they won't. There have been instances as well of students who are just really smart and don't need to attend class. They submit all the homework on time and ace the exams because they can study from home. Being someone that skipped classes frequently myself on days that I was sure that I didn't need the information, I can understand.   As far as the lesson planning and whatnot, I hear you. But then again, I feel the same frustration when you spend all that time and half of your class (that still shows up) fails the exam anyway. There are going to be people that don't show up and there are going to be people that don't get it... not much you can do about that, unless they put the time in, spend time in your office hours, etc. And by that time, you know who they are.   One of the most important things that I've realized over the course of the year that I've been teaching is that you have to start treating them like adults, because nothing up until then has prepared them for the real world. In industry, if you're not succeeding, because you're never showing up or never turning in work, or not trying hard enough, you fail/get fired and you have to do something else. So no, I don't feel bad when they get an F in my class (when they don't show up/put in effort). Maybe they'll learn from the experience.   As someone that had a very rough year in school once (my 'freshman' year in college was actually my junior year in terms of credits) and failed everything, I can tell you that nothing was as influential in getting me to start paying attention and taking responsibility for my actions.   Finally, take heart in the fact that the people who do show up generally either want to learn or want a good grade. Either way, enjoy sharing your knowledge with them, because they're going to get more out of it than all the people who don't show up."

If you want students to show up you have to somehow incorporate attendance into the grade. But this can be more than just grading attendance.

Professors,2o1wto,paithanq,2,Tue Dec 2 20:21:13 2014 UTC,Does it have to be a pencil?  I use a green pen.
Professors,2o1wto,paithanq,2,Tue Dec 2 20:35:50 2014 UTC,"I use green pen myself - Flair Felt Tip is my favorite - but every once in a while I'll write something snarky or sarcastic and want to take it back (that's when I know it's time to stop grading for the day), thus, I'd like to use pencil."
Professors,2o1wto,donasay,1 point,Tue Dec 2 20:58:54 2014 UTC,"I like to use a mechanical pencil, but more important then the brand is the size of the lead in the pencil. Whenever I find a pentel quicker clicker with .9mm lead I buy it since they are rare and elusive in the most stores. The thick lead makes writing just feel smoother."
Professors,2nz9np,mpr113,6,Mon Dec 1 21:30:20 2014 UTC,"Now that I realize I'm not going to pass, can I do something for extra credit?  ""You wouldn't need extra credit if you had bothered to do the regular credit."""
Professors,2nz9np,digitalosiris,3,Tue Dec 2 04:30:58 2014 UTC,"I used to be that way... and then I mastered ""NO"".  Works very well.  Nope, nuh-uh, nada, not gonna happen.    Everything is laid out in the syllabus, the course calendar tells them on which day what homework / assignments will be required and the day that assignment will be due.  Further, the syllabus states that any University approved excuses must be presented to me on the day they return to class.   Show up in my office during the week of finals with an excuse from 5 weeks ago?  Too bad.    Makes my life much easier."
Professors,2nz9np,Russiophile,3,Mon Dec 1 22:06:40 2014 UTC,"I'm all about ""NO."" I warn them at the beginning of the semester, have the university appropriate excuses, course calendar, etc. in my syllabus. I think it's part of the reason I get so frustrated because I get the second ""you're not being fair!"" e-mail... in which I still say no.  Any advice?"
Professors,2nz9np,Kardlonoc,1 point,Mon Dec 1 22:30:56 2014 UTC,Does your boss care if you fail them?
Professors,2nz9np,Kardlonoc,2,Tue Dec 2 04:58:38 2014 UTC,Not really. I mostly teach intro courses so it's a lot of freshmen...and it's fall so most are right out of high school. Somewhat expected I guess?
Professors,2nz9np,ProfAbroad,1 point,Tue Dec 2 17:14:01 2014 UTC,"Yes it is. But generally students have this attitude if they complain, whine, keep talking to professors they will get what they want. The crybabies of the world in fact, do get what they want but with much chagrin, and you certainly don't need to enable it.   Its not baby high school time anymore. You aren't going to hold their hand, and pat them on the back telling them its all better. If they can't hack a intro course on their own they won't be able to pass a junior level course or above when they pick their major.  As a teacher I think you should always offer a way out. The only student who should fail is the student who quits. But you aren't obliged to do so."
Professors,2nz9np,UsedToHaveKarma,1 point,Tue Dec 2 22:41:53 2014 UTC,"I had a couple of particularly persistent students. I sent them a stern no email for the third or forth time and cc'd the deans office. I sent an email to the dean to explain why. I'm at a smaller uni and friendly with the deans so they don't mind. The idea is just to show that you are in the right by bringing in higher authority, and they should be quiet and stop complaining. They did stop complaining. Their behavior was seriously bordering on harassment imo and this was the easiest way to shut them up."
Professors,2nz9np,Russiophile,2,Thu Dec 11 01:55:24 2014 UTC,I'm envious your institution codifies permitted excuses.

Professors,2nz9np,nezumipi,1 point,Tue Dec 2 13:35:12 2014 UTC,"I've done something similar to this in previous semesters. I allowed them to turn in assignments up to 2 days late with a small penalty for each day it was late. I stressed that a few points knocked off is better than no points. Few students actually used this, so I removed it from my courses."

Professors,2nz9np,JamesRussels,2,Mon Dec 1 23:29:42 2014 UTC,"In my lower-level survey classes, I allow a moderate amount of extra credit to all students.  By having it, I avoid a lot of the whining.  However, I make it incredibly difficult and intensive, so that hardly any of the whiners take advantage of it.  Specifically, students can write me a 3 - 5 page scientific paper with citations for which they will earn 0 - 3 points of extra credit, depending on paper quality.  They can do multiple papers for a maximum of 10 points.    Thus far, the only students who have ever used it are the high achievers who were a point or two below the next letter grade up."
Professors,2nscvu,kingpolly1,26,Sat Nov 29 21:15:50 2014 UTC,I'd give adjuncts  A: A wage they could live off of.  B: The option to be full time non-tenure teachers.
Professors,2nscvu,themetz,6,Sat Nov 29 23:02:22 2014 UTC,"Same.  While adjunct aren't responsible for going to faculty meetings, they do some solid work for the institution.  A friend of mine was adjuncting for a while at a community college.  He was teaching six courses a semester and still getting adjunct pay.  For full time faculty there, five classes was a full load.  So he was teaching OVER full time and making about 18,000 a year."
Professors,2nscvu,expostfacto-saurus,1 point,Sat Nov 29 23:35:35 2014 UTC,"Been there for 6 years, still barely above the poverty line."
Professors,2nscvu,themetz,1 point,Sat Nov 29 23:54:55 2014 UTC,So a course prep instructor can make as 1/2 as much in two days as a prof may make in a year teaching a full course load? That is dedication to one's field.
Professors,2nscvu,andropogon09,1 point,Sat Nov 29 23:57:03 2014 UTC,"Sorry to sidetrack this, but at what school do full time faculty teach 5 courses a semester?"
Professors,2nscvu,expostfacto-saurus,1 point,Sun Dec 7 00:01:52 2014 UTC,Community college
Professors,2nscvu,Namemedickles,1 point,Sun Dec 7 01:11:14 2014 UTC,Not only community college but a lot of smaller state universities have similar course loads especially during times when the department cannot afford to hire new profs.
Professors,2nscvu,themetz,1 point,Mon Dec 8 04:20:03 2014 UTC,"A: A wage they could live off of.   http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/most-university-undergrads-now-taught-by-poorly-paid-part-timers-1.2756024  So is that basically accurate? ^    B: The option to be full time non-tenure teachers.   I am currently an undergrad and would really enjoy if the lower level courses were taught by dedicated instructors instead of exhausted tenured professors. While yes there is prestige in being taught by the head of the physics department, he is not needed to teach a room of 200 undergrads Physics I."
Professors,2nscvu,countercat,1 point,Sun Nov 30 00:09:40 2014 UTC,"In my department, the majority of undergrad classes are taught by adjuncts. I am so impressed with the enthusiasm they bring to the classroom!"
Professors,2nscvu,Unicormfarts,12,Sun Nov 30 00:14:26 2014 UTC,Cut the number of administrators and use the money saved to lower tuition for students.
Professors,2nscvu,stoic9,4,Sun Nov 30 01:53:26 2014 UTC,"We just had a hilarious suggestion of merging 2 departments to save on one Chair's salary. From the Dean who has 3 Assistant Deans. ""Cut administrators"" does not mean the same thing to him as it does to us."
Professors,2nscvu,paithanq,2,Sun Nov 30 19:43:01 2014 UTC,"Professional discretionary judgement in course design and class management. Last three places I taught were ""by the book"" and in readable pict bound:  we were given a syllabus, handbook, and told not to change anything. The one size fits all approach was a disaster for both teachers and students. For example, quizzes that tested students on material not covered in the course, papers with grading rubrics evaluating students on areas not covered in the instructions, letting students enroll concurrently with courses and those courses' prerequisites. Easy fixes if one has control over course design, pace, material, etc.  But otherwise a horrible situation."
Professors,2nscvu,stoic9,1 point,Sun Nov 30 05:55:30 2014 UTC,Were you not also given lecture notes?
Professors,2nscvu,Namemedickles,3,Sun Nov 30 18:17:15 2014 UTC,"Mandatory topics, yes. And yes, deviating from them are grounds for dismissal. As in, you will cover X,Y,Z topics on this day.  There is also enough busy work that adding to the course is not easy."
Professors,2nscvu,stoic9,1 point,Mon Dec 1 21:52:26 2014 UTC,"God that sounds horrible. Was this community college or 4 year university? Even the Part time graduate instructors here (They have an MS and are working on their PhD) are hired to teach intro undergrad courses and have nearly complete freedom in course design. There are a few mandatory requirements such as, they have to have a final exam (only tenured professors can get rid of finals) but for the most part we can do whatever we want as long as it isn't too ridiculous."
Professors,2nscvu,DearSci3nce,1 point,Mon Dec 8 04:29:09 2014 UTC,It was a for-profit outfit.
Professors,2nscvu,jamiethecoles,1 point,Tue Dec 9 02:03:01 2014 UTC,"It sounds like a nightmare, but my department is at the other extreme. Everyone does whatever they want, every course is different with every new iteration, and if there are different sections taught by different people, they are functionally different courses.   The result? Students have heard about the same 5 topics in 10 different courses. They are essentially taking the same course 10X.   But if you teach upper-year courses, you have no idea what the students know coming in. Even if they have the same pre-reqs, they probably have vastly different background knowledge (although they all know the ""top 5"" inside out and backwards). So you have to re-teach the stuff they should know, just in case they don't."
Professors,2nscvu,andropogon09,1 point,Sun Jan 4 21:34:58 2015 UTC,"Human Resources / Administration nonsense. I'd do it by having contracted staff (NO variable hours aka 0 hours contracts) so that there would be less semester by semester admin on staff side.  This, I would hope, will have a cost saving benefit, which will knock on to the students either saving them money on tuition fees or providing them the best possible resources."

Professors,2nq8oa,LannaBan,9,Sat Nov 29 03:58:04 2014 UTC,It would be awkward.
Professors,2nq8oa,themetz,4,Sat Nov 29 04:07:31 2014 UTC,"As another undergrad, and specifically coming from a place where I've met all my professors and become close with quite a few of them, I don't know a single professor in my department that would be comfortable with this. It does feel a little bribe-y, but you also run the risk of things like not knowing any allergies, if they have diabetes, their favorite tastes, maybe they don't like sweet things. It's just an all around shaky plan.  Just go to them, honestly say everything that's been going on, and hope that your previous work is good enough to redeem you. You never know what hard work and honesty will do for you. I was in the hospital the day one term paper was due. It was a 20 pg critical theory essay and I missed turning it in! I emailed the prof explaining and even offered proof and his exact words were, ""You've given me no reason to disbelieve you. Turn it in through email when you get back to your laptop and get well soon.""  So, honesty and no cupcakes is your best policy. Also, look into melatonin :) Good luck!"
Professors,2nq8oa,Izzi_Skyy,3,Sat Nov 29 05:17:24 2014 UTC,"I don't think bribing would be appropriate. I would recommend going to your tutor with a plan of action to make up the work, if it's even possible at this point. And seek medical help if your sleeping problems are a medical issue."
Professors,2nq8oa,Trillian42,1 point,Sat Nov 29 04:15:56 2014 UTC,"There is no work to make up. We're graded solely on coursework, and I'm all set in that department. But, I see your point. Thanks."
Professors,2nq8oa,biznatch11,2,Sat Nov 29 04:17:55 2014 UTC,I agree with the other posts it wouldn't be a good idea.  If you want to bake cupcakes do it when the class/semester is finished and everything is already graded so it's clear that it's a thank you gift.
Professors,2nq8oa,coldgator,1 point,Sat Nov 29 08:14:19 2014 UTC,It makes me uncomfortable when students give me any type of gift. The only exception might be if it is for writing a recommendation letter AFTER I have written the letter.

Professors,2msa20,Dr_Pizzas,6,Wed Nov 19 17:01:33 2014 UTC,"I'm just curious. Do you all remember being assigned group projects? And they went well? That surprises me because that isn't my experience. My sample size of one tells me that invariably in any group one student will wind up doing more/most of the work, and one student will get away with free riding and doing little to nothing. Even letting groups self select doesn't overcome this problem because in any class at the university level there are not pre-established friend groups to take advantage of.   Of course that doesn't help you now. One work around would be to have students rate each other's performance and tell them that that will factor into their grade. It'll force them to resolve their own shit and will penalize the free rider appropriately."
Professors,2msa20,soyunamariposa,3,Fri Nov 21 22:34:16 2014 UTC,"I realize it is too late for this particular situation, but stuff like this is exactly why I refrain from assigning students to groups. If I assign group projects in my course (which I do often), I always leave it up to the students to determine their groups. If problems like this arise then I have every right to tell them to work it out on their own, since they are responsible for forming the group."
Professors,2msa20,digshake,3,Thu Nov 20 16:57:58 2014 UTC,"I hated group projects for this very reason, and rarely do them.  But if I do, I create private groups in our LMS where all work must be done and I have access.  This way, I can see all interaction, monitor time spent in the group, and mediate any issues.  The students also seem to have more motivation to do their share since I'm part of the groups process, so to speak. :)"
Professors,2msa20,Profkristi,2,Sun Nov 23 15:07:42 2014 UTC,"Another point is that sometimes tone cannot be conveyed well over email.  Time permitting, perhaps invite the group to your office to discuss these issues in person. That way, if L had misinterpreted the tone/purpose of H's email, that can be cleared up. And if not, at least they will have the chance to work it out in person and L will be taken to task for not finishing his part of the project.  Or, you could just restate the guidelines/requirements/deadline and state it's their responsibility to work it out on their own and leave it at that."
Professors,2msa20,Trillian42,2,Thu Nov 20 01:39:15 2014 UTC,"I've had similar problems a couple of times in the past. I usually just tell them that their grades are connected, and unless one feels like they need to escalate their grievances, they need to get it done.   You can't make them get along, all you can do is expect that they will get the work done as assigned. Have any of the others in the group said anything?   I doubt these two will be able to impact the evals much, and as long as you are trying to hold everyone to the same standard the other students will make up for it."
Professors,2msa20,working_and_whatnot,1 point,Wed Nov 19 21:42:49 2014 UTC,"Now that the project is likely over, I'd recommend implementing in your future group projects some sort of contract system (student-generated, who will contribute what), along with 1-3 intermediate deadlines before the final project turn in. I've had some success with those tactics."
Professors,2mq5zc,princess_tourmaline,7,Wed Nov 19 01:36:20 2014 UTC,"I'm not sure I can always tell, but it hasn't really been awkward so long as the student doesn't deliberately cross any boundaries - so long as they are not outright hitting on me, I just ignore it since I'm not 100% certain, and, even if I was, it would be relatively harmless.  It's not uncommon at all though to have a crush on a professor, so it should not be a problem if you don't act on it.  Just be super professional and everything will be fine."
Professors,2mq5zc,naruhina84,2,Wed Nov 19 02:34:44 2014 UTC,"Trust me, professor is married (let alone the boundaries of a proper student-teacher dynamic), there will be no acting on anything.  Not to mention, I'm super interested in this professor's area of research and will probably be relying on a letter of recommendation, so this person's impression of me needs to be really good and I need to be seen as professional.  Anyway, I think the reason I feel as awkward as I do is that I'm afraid it's super obvious.  But, if it's usually not obvious for other professors to catch on to and it's not awkward from the professor's point of view (as long as nothing inappropriate occurs), I think I can probably relax a little bit.  Thank you for the input!"
Professors,2mq5zc,naruhina84,2,Wed Nov 19 02:54:43 2014 UTC,"Yep, things will most likely be okay.  Even if he/she does currently think you have a crush on them, they will probably think they imagined the whole thing if you try to act as normal as possible."
Professors,2mq5zc,gcheliotis,1 point,Wed Nov 19 07:07:05 2014 UTC,"We can usually tell. But never for sure, as each student and each professor are different individuals and have different ways of conveying feelings and thoughts. So I wouldn't worry too much about it. Just respect that line. I can't help but feel a little flattered when a student seems to be taken with me, but I hate it when students cross the line and get flirty or try to influence my judgment. It's better for all to keep our thoughts to ourselves. What may or may not still show through doesn't really matter."
Professors,2mq5zc,herennius,9,Mon Dec 1 19:35:19 2014 UTC,"I will repost here what I've said elsewhere (https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/2g5ub7/big_crush_on_literature_instructor_small_question/):   It's generally pretty obvious.  Also, if you want me to be serious, I don't think I've even considered finding an undergraduate student attractive since my first or second semester teaching introductory composition when I was a graduate TA pursuing my master's degree. The quality of most students' writing just kills the fantasy that a student might have it enough together mentally to be considered a dateable person.  I don't mean for the above to come across as personal, but there is just a little psychological shift that happens."
Professors,2mq5zc,GhotiStyx,2,Wed Nov 19 03:44:42 2014 UTC,"I liked believing it was not so obvious...haha, but thank you, nonetheless."
Professors,2mq5zc,parkervoice,2,Wed Nov 19 04:07:53 2014 UTC,"I'm not sure any student has ever had a crush on me.  If so, I was completely oblivious.  Not all of us think its ""generally pretty obvious""."
Professors,2mq5zc,parkervoice,1 point,Wed Nov 19 04:34:59 2014 UTC,"It's usually somewhat obvious, but it's easy to understand and look past. It's when the student starts acting creepy or inappropriate that it becomes worrisome. Your crush will likely fade, but hopefully your interest in the subject will remain."
Professors,2mq5zc,cuntasticallywet,1 point,Wed Nov 19 05:46:13 2014 UTC,"Interest in the general area has existed for years, but the class is a new realm of the field to which I hadn't been previously introduced.  It's much more focused on math and has more potential for interdisciplinary studies/projects than other parts of the field that I've seen.  So, I have no doubt the interest will stick."
Professors,2mpcv0,LakeRat,4,Tue Nov 18 21:26:32 2014 UTC,"Not to burst your bubble but there are PHDs with many years of experience in and out of the classroom waiting in the wings for full time positions. Along with that, there seems to be a hiring moratorium these days.   My advice is to teach what you love where you are most comfortable but to keep it as a part time or evening job."
Professors,2mpcv0,themetz,1 point,Tue Nov 18 22:23:17 2014 UTC,"I appreciate the advice.  Since I'm looking at community college or smaller regional state schools in smaller cities I'm hoping that the bar is a little lower and I can slide in with an MS, several years of successful adjunct experience, and a good amount of real-world industry experience.  For example, the regional university I'm looking at has around 8 full-time faculty members in my department.  2 of the 8 do not have their PHD.  The community college I'm looking at has around 20 full time faculty members in my department and I'd say less than half of them have PHDs."
Professors,2mpcv0,themetz,2,Tue Nov 18 23:11:06 2014 UTC,"I wish you the best of luck!   I would say that a hiring committee would look for what you did for your department while you were and adjunct.   I know adjuncts that merely come to class, put in their 3 hours a week, grade papers, and think nothing more about their job. Then I know adjuncts who attend every department meeting even though they are not expected to, volunteer for committees, design new courses, and even help design new majors and minors with senior faculty. All without compensation. Where ever you end up, make a big name for yourself.   I'd think diploma mill schools would not offer that opportunity since their curriculum is so top-down."

Professors,2m6trz,RhinestoneTaco,7,Thu Nov 13 16:01:14 2014 UTC,"I like it! Another benefit is that you'd get to work with the same classmates throughout the school term, which the Team Based Learning people recommend."

My classes are about 30, so this works well, plus it's fun and breaks the ice and gets people moving so when the group work starts, the students are revved up and ready to go! :)"

Professors,2m6rmk,cluelessapplicant,2,Thu Nov 13 15:40:13 2014 UTC,"I consider a research statement to be more past focused, explaining what you've done and how it fits together, with some explanation of what you would do in the future, whereas I consider a research plan to be primarily focused on what you will do in the future, with some reference to your past work as it sets the framework for your plans.  I suspect that many search committees aren't thinking that deeply about which term they use, so they may not see it that way.  There's nothing wrong with contacting the institute and asking whether they're looking for a more past-focused or future-focused document."

Professors,2lzryx,invisiblecows,3,Wed Nov 12 13:20:21 2014 UTC,"I used to give students printouts of journal articles and have them practice writing MLA citations in class. They could then swap citations with a partner and check each other's work.  To deal with in-text citation and avoiding plagiarism, I would bring examples of paragraphs that used sources incorrectly (too much direct quotation, failure to use quotation marks, failure to cite when paraphrasing from a source, etc) and ask students to explain what was wrong with each one."

Professors,2lpec8,carpecras,6,Sat Nov 8 21:09:04 2014 UTC,"Sounds like a tough situation.  I hope you are not mistaking their laziness as disrespect.  I ask because you don't seem to have any evidence that they are actually disrespectful.  I also ask because I once made that mistake: I found a few students in the back laughing during class and assumed disrespect.  I later learned that they mostly liked me.  I would suggest do nothing until you face a situation of clear disrespect.  Be firm if and when that happens.  ""I am uncomfortable with that behavior; do you want to express in a different form"", etc.  Carry on teaching, focussing on the subject and on helping them learn to the best you can.    I've usually been very open about my limitations in class.  When I don't know then answer, I say it, loud and clear.  This has, as far as I can tell, has had only positive results.  Of course, not every teacher seems to feel the same."
Professors,2lpec8,NotFromMumbai,7,Sat Nov 8 23:33:47 2014 UTC,"Sorry, I was a bit vague for the sake of (attempted) brevity. Here are a couple of examples. It's a very small class, and so in general I wouldn't say it's blatant disrespect, more passive aggressive stuff.  Students are welcome to ask questions, of course, but sometimes the questions seem to be more of a challenge. For example, they'll ask, I'll respond/correct them, and then they'll continue challenging me, as if they don't trust my answer or think it's subjective/my opinion. Again, if this is coming from a place of trying to understand the issue better, I'm fine with that, but it sounds more like they are trying to assert themselves as an authority. In these situations I try to point out what is faulty with their line of thinking without just saying ""You're wrong.""  I am not afraid to say ""I don't know,"" and actually in my last class there was a question about the distinction between two similar concepts that I was not 100% on (not my area of expertise or hugely relevant to the material), but I did say definitively that they were part of the same thing. One student said, no they're completely different. I asked her to explain her thinking, which proved to be faulty and I corrected her on that but said I'd also get more info.   I got a better definition and when I posted this on a class website two of her cohorts immediately posted to say ""see, so-and-so was right!"" In no way was she right, and I want to correct the two students who are saying this but I don't want it to seem like I'm just trying to prove that I'm right or make a big deal of the other student being wrong! I feel like this was an attempt on the part of the two students to undermine my authority with the class and prove that I don't know what I'm talking about.   Another student told me in a one-on-one meeting that she didn't like a recent guest speaker because she ""outranked"" him in her job (this was perceived) and because he was young. (BTW, this was a huge red flag to me.) I pointed out that he provided insight into a particular topic that was relevant to the lesson that class. She repeated that she just didn't think there was anything she could learn from him.  Our class is in the evening and my students think it's acceptable to groan when I keep them until the end of the scheduled class time (I have pointed out that they're paying for that time) and they have been critical of my lectures (which include visuals and opportunities for participation and discussion), saying that because the class is late at night I should include more activities into class to ""keep them awake and interested.""  Am I blowing these situations out of proportion? Not handling them as assertively as I could in the moment?  These are grad students. I have always come into class with the idea that we're all adults so I'm going to treat them like adults and give them the respect I expect from them. I am really passionate about the subject and earnestly want to help them learn. I think that's why this bothers me so much."
Professors,2lpec8,GhotiStyx,5,Sun Nov 9 00:17:45 2014 UTC,"She repeated that she just didn't think there was anything she could learn from him.   This would be a huge red flag for me.  It's a level of arrogance that will guarantee ignorance.  I've been a professor since the mid 1990's, and just this week I asked one of my graduate students to teach me a statistical technique that she's more familiar with than I am."
Professors,2lpec8,NotFromMumbai,3,Sun Nov 9 07:39:17 2014 UTC,"Thanks for the details.  They help.  Recently I taught similar classes: in the evenings, for people who work, etc.  We used an online forum for students to post questions, comment, etc.  They could choose to be anonymous.  Some of the comments were outrightly nasty. :-(    In fact, even among other teachers, the general feeling is that students in these classes are not as respectful as, say, undergraduates.  So I can understand.  It is a difficult situation, certainly.  The online post that ""so-and-so was right"" is clearly out of line.  I would may ignore it a couple of times, but if a student is repeatedly disrespectful I would do something.  I, personally, would let the administration talk to them.  That tells students that it is not they-vs-you, but they-vs-the institution.  It also helps if the administration looks at your course/instructor evaluations.  But if the administration isn't helpful, or if you would like to handle it yourself, go ahead and assert yourself directly.  I don't feel you are blowing anything out of proportion.  Also, pretty sure, a large group of ""quiet"" students appreciate the effort you are making."
Professors,2lpec8,YourFavoriteBandSux,12,Sun Nov 9 01:31:18 2014 UTC,"Never ignore it the first time; that sets a precedent. You can get nicer/softer as the semester goes on, but you can't get tougher if you start soft."
Professors,2lpec8,NotFromMumbai,1 point,Sun Nov 9 01:40:55 2014 UTC,"You have a point, I suppose.  But somehow I don't quite follow or recommend that philosophy.

Professors,2lpec8,GhotiStyx,5,Sun Nov 9 01:59:09 2014 UTC,"your favorite band is right on target.  An old mentor of mine said ""come in like a lion and go out like a lamb"".  I have an entire speech about what a nasty piece of work I am the first day of class, and encourage people to drop my class and take another with less of an asshole.  Turns out I'm a big softie, but it's WAY easier to come in hard and soften up.  If you come in soft then have to tighten up, people will feel betrayed and have a much more negative opinion."
Professors,2lpec8,NotFromMumbai,1 point,Sun Nov 9 07:42:33 2014 UTC,"Forgive me, but sounds like playing a game with the students.  Why not be genuine and transparent from day one?"
Professors,2lpec8,GhotiStyx,4,Sun Nov 9 16:39:02 2014 UTC,"Very fair question.  Because it doesn't work.  You have a choice: interact with the world the way it is, and use proven approaches and techniques to ensure success for yourself and you students, or interact with the world the way you think it SHOULD be and be consistently frustrated and disappointed.  It's not the major tone of my interactions, but a technique I use.  I've changed what I do in the classroom: not who I am."
Professors,2lpec8,NotFromMumbai,1 point,Sun Nov 9 16:51:34 2014 UTC,"Sounds logical.  Thanks for the clear reply.  I, however, have had a different experience.  Maybe I've just been lucky with the students I've had.  (Although, as I said elsewhere, I've had some students being nasty to me in an anonymous online forum.  And also in teacher evaluations.)  I'm sure if I start feeling constantly frustrated and disappointed I'll change my approach to teaching as well.  But it hasn't happened so far in the 10 years I've been teaching."
Professors,2lpec8,esDragon,1 point,Sun Nov 9 18:48:19 2014 UTC,"Would you mind sharing your speech ( or the gist of it)? I've been wanting to do something like this for years, but I can't come up with a palatable way to go about it."
Professors,2lpec8,YourFavoriteBandSux,2,Sun Nov 9 20:01:58 2014 UTC,"All I'm saying is, set the precedent early that it's your classroom."
Professors,2lpec8,NotFromMumbai,3,Sun Nov 9 04:12:49 2014 UTC,"Thanks, NotFromMumbai. The validation is great to hear.  I'm going to directly email the two students who posted ""so-and-so was right,"" but I'm having trouble articulating why it's inappropriate even though I clearly feel it is!   Any suggestions?"
Professors,2lpec8,schistkicker,5,Sun Nov 9 02:03:04 2014 UTC,"Frankly, I won't email them.  Emails tend to be impersonal and prone to misinterpretation when matters are delicate.  I would meet with them privately, ask them if they had any concerns about the class, and then say I was uncomfortable with their postings, and sort of encourage them to talk about it.  Hopefully they will express what they were feeling as well as realize why their expression was out of line.  That said, these are very dependent on individual personalities.  You should obviously handle it the way you feel most comfortable.  Good luck."
Professors,2lpec8,at1stsite,2,Sun Nov 9 02:30:52 2014 UTC,Thanks for the advice. I really appreciate it.
Professors,2lpec8,Kardlonoc,2,Sun Nov 9 02:37:09 2014 UTC,"We used an online forum for students to post questions, comment, etc. They could choose to be anonymous. Some of the comments were outrightly nasty. :-(  In fact, even among other teachers, the general feeling is that students in these classes are not as respectful as, say, undergraduates.   This is one reason why I always put a line somewhere in all of my syllabi that reads something like ""only dialogue and discussion that promotes mutual respect will be tolerated"". It gives me something to point to when it comes time to crack down on bad attitudes, which fortunately hasn't happened too often."
Professors,2lpec8,Namemedickles,7,Sun Nov 9 20:29:11 2014 UTC,"Ugh. First, let me say I'm sorry you're dealing with this. I am also a younger, female professor who teaches grad students. This semester, I had a small group (but males) who treated me similarly.  I think this is pretty much a ""you can't win them all over"" situation. I've reflected on what I could have or should have done differently, and I'm pretty sure there wasn't anything that would have really made much of a difference. The vast majority of my students evaluate me very highly on competence, teaching style, approachability, etc. I've actually found that my older students (40+) are the most respectful and accepting of me in spite of my youth, and the few who have ever given me trouble with this are younger students who (correctly) perceive I'm only a few years off from them or the same age.  The ""so and so was right"" comments were out of line. I would make a point to say ""I want make sure you truly understand the relationships between these concepts: no, so and so was not right in asserting <blah> because <reality>. Feel free to email me directly if you're still confused about blahblah concepts' relationship and need further explanations.""  I HATE when they complain about having to stay until the end of class or heaven forbid it goes over by 2 minutes because of high quality discussion one time. They're acting unprofessionally. I don't think you're going to move the dial on this kind of childish behavior without a pretty direct confrontation, and it's of course still not guaranteed to do anything. One idea might be to call their group in for a meeting presumably about their project and address their unprofessionalism. ""The way you've conducted yourselves in class and online have been lacking in professionalism and tact, and I wanted to be sure to give you this feedback b/c I'd hate to see it be a stumbling block for you in the future of your careers. For example, <example>. While I think I understand your intentions/concerns behind this, there are better ways to handle this that are (less combative, help your view be heard and accepted more readily, can get your point across while maintaining a professional manner, whatever), such as (suggestion)."" Like I said, it's up to you whether you think it's worth it or not at this point. And you might influence one, two, or NONE of them as a result. My heart goes out to you."
Professors,2lpec8,maineblackbear,4,Sun Nov 9 01:59:01 2014 UTC,"THANK YOU! Those sample responses are exactly what I needed to hear. Glad I'm not alone, and to hear that sometimes there's just nothing you can do."
Professors,2lpec8,Inertbert,-1,Sun Nov 9 02:11:40 2014 UTC,"Students are welcome to ask questions, of course, but sometimes the questions seem to be more of a challenge.

Your own opinion will be considered wrong.""  ""No more questions. Save your questions until after class, we have to continue now.""  ""No. Look it up yourself.""  Despite trying to have a doting grandparent style of teaching, sometimes you need to be really direct even if its a male trait. Other teachers sort of laugh when I tell a student ""No."" with a short explanation, but really its the easiest way to get going.   Students love simplicity. Short answers like ""No."" or ""Yes."" makes gives them less opportunists to question things.    I got a better definition and when I posted this on a class website two of her cohorts immediately posted to say ""see, so-and-so was right!""

If you're an adjunct your are probably teaching a course that is a requirement rather than one they are interested in. Its unfortunate but how teaching is.   But listen to your students. Do they have a break? If they are getting tired make them stand up and walk around.   Try and plan activities within the boundaries of the course, try to get them engaged. You can hand out candy for prizes for instance.    These are grad students. I have always come into class with the idea that we're all adults so I'm going to treat them like adults and give them the respect I expect from them. I am really passionate about the subject and earnestly want to help them learn. I think that's why this bothers me so much.  These are grad students. I have always come into class with the idea that we're all adults so I'm going to treat them like adults and give them the respect I expect from them.   I treat children like adults until they they stop acting like such. I have the same standard with adults as well.  You need to flip this around as well. Don't try and earn their respect, they should be earning your respect.  You are god almighty in that classroom.   As a final word, adults think being taught things are cute more or less, especially many who teach themselves. Ultimately instead of a teacher you should act like a boss. No in terms of punishment, but outlying what needs to be done."

Professors,2lpec8,gcheliotis,9,Tue Nov 11 05:55:17 2014 UTC,"Scare them.  Seriously.  I have had similar issues and I am 5-3.  The only thing that works is to demonstrate that without you they get nothing. Grade them very very hard--explain how their answers while fine are not nuanced.  Explain that you had higher hopes for them and you are disappointed with them for not getting it.  Explain it, pedantically if necessary.  You have to be the alpha here.  Don't be angry (that will feed their impression by making them think you are defensive).  Be disappointed in their lack of necessities.    This statement by you is what made me think this: (these same students seem to think that their MA degree guarantees them a mid-level job in the field with no meaningful professional experience) -academic laziness--they came up with one answer (not a very good one...) and they dig their heels in and refuse to think any further...  sounds lazy, sounds entitled and you are the alpha dog.  scare 'em.  be disappointed in their lack of intellectual acumen.  Try to make them understand that that they are not all that.  As a professor once said to me in grad school when I was getting arrogant-- ""Just remember, maineblackbear, all of my friends have doctorates.  All of them."""
Professors,2lpec8,Unicormfarts,10,Sat Nov 8 21:49:07 2014 UTC,"That sounds pretty harsh.  What field is this that has such antagonistic relationships?  I have a colleague who is a young and diminutive female who addresses this by being very formal with her students.  Try developing a stricter format of in class communication, such as calling your students by their title and last name and having explicit times in your agenda for when they are allowed to talk and ask questions.    I don't teach at a high level, but I've had students who clearly lacked any respect for my position.  On the very rare occasions that I need to address my student's conduct, my go-to line is typically to tell them that they are welcome to return on a day that they are willing to participate in a productive and respectful manner.  Once you ask one student to leave, its amazing how well the rest of the semester goes."
Professors,2lpec8,schistkicker,3,Sat Nov 8 22:31:27 2014 UTC,"the strategy i laid out above I have resorted to exactly twice in my career.  most of the time, i never have to think about this; but twice i have gotten 1/3 of the way into a semester and thought- sheesh-- what is up with this particular class?  I have resorted to the above both times as a way to re-start the relationship where the students have to come down to earth.  I hear what you are saying, inertbert, and at the beginning of a semester, sure it makes sense.  I try to be a lot more informal though and perhaps it is my informality that has led to those circumstances.  I start out (as a doctor) telling people to call me by my first name, etc., and that informality has been a benefit most of the time.  But I am a man.    I have never had to tell a student to leave, though I have wanted to.  The two times I had to resort to ""expressing disappointment"" were both successful."

Here is an online pedagogy mooc you can browse to get started:  https://learn.canvas.net/courses/45  and  https://www.mooc-list.com/course/online-pedagogy-canvasnet  And here's one which addresses video lecture maximization (though for moocs, you can adapts it for smaller classes easily):  https://onlinelearninginsights.wordpress.com/tag/mooc-pedagogy/  Finally, I would like to allay your fears; if you are a good professor in person you will be a good professor online. If you have a passion for being the one who helps students have that ""aha!"" moment, you'll do fine. The trick is to never be complacent and always learn from your online classes - what methods work and what doesn't - and to approach the class in a way that honors the kinds of students you have in it; are they non-traditional students? Part of a nursing program? are they freshmen or sophomores? These little tidbits of information can help you scale and specialize your lectures towards your audience's interests and goals and provide a more holistic learning experience for the term."

I do consider myself to be a good professor and I do enjoy it immensely when a student starts to grasp a particularly difficult concept.  The class has a variety of students in it, some are freshman, some are non-traditional, some are going for the nursing program, some for dental hygiene, PTA, OTA, PA, etc, etc. I will say that the vast majority, though, are going into some health related field, and I do certainly throw in various tidbits. For example, I discuss certain medical conditions. I do a segment for each organ system entitled ""WHEN THINGS GO WRONG!"" They find these particularly interesting."
Professors,2li89j,Gahmuret,2,Fri Nov 7 23:56:43 2014 UTC,"Will the whole course be online or will there also be an in-person component? If the latter, you can look into creating a ""flipped classroom"" where all the lecture materials are online and the in-class sessions are just for practice (what you'd normally assign for homework). I'm doing that this term with a remedial writing class and it's pretty successful so far. I don't have any specific resources for how to make a flipped classroom; I just made sure my online lecture materials are short, easy to read, and included multiple modes of presenting the info (pictures, text, and videos)."

There is a lab portion to the course, as well, but there is no guarantee that I will be the instructor for it. Also, since lab and lecture are structured differently, I am not sure the flipped classroom portion would work.  I'm thinking of recording my lectures and letting them download them for easy viewing, in addition to the pictures, text and videos."

I accept any out of class assignments late (and allow make-ups for quizzes and tests) without a doctor's note--as long it's within 1 week of the assignment date. I only ask them whether the absence should be excused. If they say it's excused, then I ask for proof and there's no penalty. If they say it's unexcused, they take the standard late penalty (a flat rate whether it's 1 hour, 1 day, or 1 week late). It cuts down on people leaking in my classes and has also really cut down on some of the more unpleasant student interactions (e.g., no more time wasted dealing with obvious nonsense excuses & overly emotional pleas to make exceptions to course policies)."

But if I give my students tools they can use to engage in effective studying, some of them will actually use those tools.  I give out answer keys for the multiple choice questions, but not the essay questions.  I am willing to clarify parts of the essay questions for students, but I won't give them an answer they can regurgitate on an exam.  Doing this would negate the practice testing benefit.

I also tell them that I'd be happy to go over their solutions during office hours and they can also try out their answers to see if they work the way they are supposed to.   I've had a few discussions, and a few people come to my office, which is great, but I've had far more people ask me to post the answer key and/or complain when I explain why I won't do that. They don't seem to think that I am trying to help them."
Professors,2kp1aq,Cnp113,2,Thu Oct 30 03:10:58 2014 UTC,"I'm lucky enough to have two teaching assistants this semester that do an exam review. They make up test questions (with some test question generating resources), and I proofread them before the review.   The students seem to like it, and my teaching assistants are pretty good at picking out important material. I am not allowed to show them my exams or quizzes. The review is not mandatory since they do it Sunday evening but 2/3 of the class shows typically.   Also- I give 4 exams and make the first exam worth 10 % so they see the format and can make up a bad grade in later tests.   I also have in class group case studies, where I walk around to ensure the students understand the critical thinking behind the content. And some other content so my material is not based solely on exams.   This is actually the first year the students have not asked for a break down of the exam. I have never provided this in the past so perhaps my reputation proceeded me. I have never given prior year exams, nor been asked to provide them.   Maybe it's cultural in your discipline?"
Professors,2kp1aq,tweakism,1 point,Thu Oct 30 03:40:53 2014 UTC,"It's very stressful to know you're going to be given an exam, but not have much idea of the format or difficulty.  When professors give me a sample exam, with questions of similar difficulty, in the format of the real exam, it allows me to be confident that I have the material down and will do well on the exam.  When the format of the sample diverges greatly from the actual exam, it feels like a betrayal."
Professors,2kp1aq,fempiricist,1 point,Wed Oct 29 22:43:09 2014 UTC,"But if that is the case are you truly learning the material, or are you learning how to do well on the exam? In other words: did you do well because of the extra practice reinforced the concepts, or did you do well because you were more familiar with a particular type of question?  The concepts I cover on my exams are mostly the same, though things do get added and removed every semester, and I'm sure to tell my students about this. Previous semesters are also taught by other instructors who have different styles and expectations from me. I will never write an exam like someone else does, nor would I want to."
Professors,2kp1aq,SingletOxygen,1 point,Thu Oct 30 03:14:49 2014 UTC,"Maybe they feel entitled because a lot of major exams have practice material beforehand these days.  SATs, GREs, MCAS (I'm from MA), etc.  All major exams you practice for, including board exams for licensures.    I definitely think that class exams are not on the same level as these, and thus none of my exams are worth more than 20% (so is class preparation and participation), so in no way are the exams in my class the final say.  They are at most, learning opportunities and motivation for studying.  But, just saying, major summative assessments are expected to have practice associated while preparing."
Professors,2ko8l4,machtesh,7,Wed Oct 29 13:29:56 2014 UTC,What features would this offer over using due date notifications within blackboard or whatever system an institution already uses? Does it have a mobile app or something?
Professors,2ko8l4,JamesRussels,0,Wed Oct 29 13:48:14 2014 UTC,"Yes, the student app is 100% mobile, iOS and Android. The teacher admin side is web but responsive.  WhatsDue is also a to-do list so students can swipe off assignments as they complete them.  You can check out our interface at www.whatsdueapp.com"
Professors,2ko8l4,JamesRussels,5,Wed Oct 29 14:00:18 2014 UTC,I'll take a look. I don't mean to be a nay-sayer but many of the integrated classroom platforms already offered by institutions offer these things. The real differentiator between your product and Blackboard is that you have a mobile app (I presume that works very well). This would be excellent for someone teaching at an institution that doesn't already offer a student interaction platform like WebCourses or Blackboard.  There are three main criticisms I have of the Blackboard system we use now:  -Blackboard is bloated with features I would never use -User actions take too many clicks to complete -Interface is slow and clunky  The webcourses platform fixes most of these for me (though still relatively slow). I hope your product can do these things.   Oh and Blackboard does have a mobile app but it sucks :D  Edit: I checked out your interface and it does look very slick. I might give this a try since most of my students check their phone more than anything else in life.
Professors,2ko8l4,fempiricist,3,Wed Oct 29 14:21:09 2014 UTC,"I'd try it if the user interface was as slick for professors as for students.  Blackboard, like JamesRussels says, is clunky and inconvenient. I also use my phone and iPad as much as my students, so integration on our side would be a major plus.    However, integrating new technology (while I am totally fine with) seems to send my students over the edge.  It's a tough course to start with, and they have trouble learning the clicker system, wiki, and Blackboard all at the same time."
Professors,2ko8l4,fempiricist,0,Thu Oct 30 01:01:34 2014 UTC,"Thanks for the vote of confidence!  The professor admin panel is incredibly simple. Login takes just a few seconds with either email or Facebook. Adding a course or an assignment takes just 10 seconds. And that's it, really! Nothing for you to learn.   You bring up a good point that using multiple technologies is annoying, but I think WhatsDue is different. The beauty of it is that ALL it does is tell you what's due. That's it. There's no file upload or submitting assignments that would make the app ""heavy"" and harder to use. It just sits on your phone until you need to know when something is due. In the near future, there will be reminders of due dates and push notifications when an assignment is added, changed, or deleted."
Professors,2ko8l4,kairoschris,1 point,Thu Oct 30 04:12:08 2014 UTC,"That sounds pretty great.  Maybe I'd be willing to try it next semester, or over the summer."

Professors,2ke0mc,EarlGreyPlease,3,Sun Oct 26 18:40:21 2014 UTC,"One option comes to mind: you could find a research lab's website online, learn about the type of research and contact the PI to get involved. Find a lab doing topics you are interested in, and ask about a research assistantship.  From a university perspective, that is the first thought that popped into my head. There may be better opportunities in private industry."
Professors,2ke0mc,fempiricist,2,Wed Oct 29 03:13:56 2014 UTC,Thanks for the advice. I'll definitely check that.

I'm 33 and a few years ago decided that I wanted to change my field. I'm currently pursuing my second masters, and I haven't regretted my decision for one moment  You are only 27, and age is just a number that signifies the number of times you have gone around the sun. Immerse yourself into something you really want to do and you will find a way.   Good luck!!!  Edit: you can apply to universities in other countries if that is an option."
Professors,2kb8io,gussssy,5,Sat Oct 25 20:07:21 2014 UTC,"Without reading your particular contract, all I can do is guess (which is probably why you aren't getting too many responses - literally, no one can know).  So, here's my guess:  Obviously, you're not a slave.  Unless there's a very unusual and particular piece of your contract that says you'll suffer X consequence for not finishing your term, then it's likely all that will happen are some very annoyed administrators.  It's probably just not worth their time or money to sue over something like this.  However, by doing this, you are essentially leaving academia and related fields for the foreseeable future.  No one would hire someone who left midstream.  I know you say you hate teaching and want to leave, but if you want to enter a related field, there might be some socio-professional network overlap.  I'd think long and hard about this - are you sure you can't just finish?  It's only one more semester.  Then, you walk away with a good reference and no possible legal issues."
Professors,2kdc3o,Callcutta1,6,Sun Oct 26 14:19:07 2014 UTC,"Did you mean to write weekends? I'm a PhD candidate and I teach full classes. I'm very good about getting back to students, even on weekends, but a lot of professors will wait til Monday to respond. It really varies by instructor depending on how much they care about teaching and mentorship. If you meant to write weekdays, then they SHOULD respond within 24 hours (but that's just how I personally feel)"
Professors,2kdc3o,bigboatfear,6,Sun Oct 26 14:38:36 2014 UTC,"I let many emails wait over the weekend before replying and I care plenty about teaching and mentoring. There is serious value in modeling some semblance of work-life balance for students who are entering the workforce, if you simply make it clear when you will and won't respond to emails. Students also need to learn that they can't whip off a last-minute email and expect an immediate reply with what they need. There is such a thing as being too accommodating if you give students unrealistic expectations about how they can procrastinate and ignore others' boundaries as working adults."
Professors,2kdc3o,galileosmiddlefinger,-4,Mon Oct 27 12:25:35 2014 UTC,I wrote on a Saturday evening . I guess i should just wait until Monday then
Professors,2kdc3o,transethnic-midget,5,Sun Oct 26 14:41:20 2014 UTC,"Wait until Tuesday. The countdown starts Monday morning, 9am."
Professors,2kdc3o,fempiricist,7,Sun Oct 26 22:46:45 2014 UTC,"Professors will be more likely to respond faster to emails that 1. show respect and 2. do not have grammatical errors. Just judging by the way you've written this comment, I would be unlikely to respond until 2 days later.  If you don't show linguistic competence or positive respectful attitude, I would get frustrated at the deterioration of societal expectations, and generally upset at youth.  I wouldn't emotionally trust myself to respond in a decent way until I've calmed down.  And, we don't put things in writing that we might regret later. End result: it takes time for some professors to respond to poorly articulated emails.    Maybe this is just me.  I've always emailed professors with respect and grammatical correctness, so I wouldn't know first hand if others react the way I do.  I can only generalize."
Professors,2kdc3o,kairoschris,4,Thu Oct 30 01:08:08 2014 UTC,I agree. Not so much on the grammar thing but respect is a big one for me. Students who don't show respect or try to make their problems your problems (i.e. I procrastinated and waited to the last minute--answer me now!!!) definitely rub me the wrong way and those emails have to wait until I simmer down.

You want to do a good job as a teacher, but if your program does not require you to get outside feedback, don't solicit it."
Professors,2k7dl4,croak_monsieur,1 point,Fri Oct 24 18:15:12 2014 UTC,Interesting. My program does require it and it's a major part of the review process.
Professors,2k7dl4,croak_monsieur,1 point,Fri Oct 24 22:12:34 2014 UTC,I didn't realize that you were in an education doctoral program. I can see how this would be a much more central part of your training than it was of mine.
Professors,2k7dl4,in_question,1 point,Sat Oct 25 02:58:11 2014 UTC,"Well, it's not the doctoral program reviewing my teaching. It is my department chair, and has nothing to do with my doctorate."
Professors,2k7dl4,in_question,2,Wed Oct 29 03:07:19 2014 UTC,"I think that if you start a lecture with objectives.... you have bought into trash pedagogy, and i do agree that you seem to be over-managed.  How to manage?  realize that you only have one goal... finish your degree.  Everything else is in service to that, teaching, service, etc. all are about finishing.  Do it professionally, but if it is not directly related to finishing, do it minimally."
Professors,2k7dl4,zombie_dbaseIV,2,Fri Oct 24 16:49:41 2014 UTC,"Thanks, this helps.  As for the objectives, one of my master's degrees is in education, and my doctoral degree is also. It's totally fine by me if you don't appreciate the pedagogy but I definitely see the value, and seem to know more about the theory than any of my peers or superiors. That's one of the reasons they hired me. It just kills me that now she is critiquing my objectives without understanding the deliberation I put into them."
Professors,2k7dl4,in_question,2,Fri Oct 24 22:15:20 2014 UTC,"yes, remember the key is that... universities do not use pedagogy, because we are not teaching children.    in short, if you showed me a list of objectives, i'd think you were teaching children, and not teaching university."
Professors,2k7dl4,zombie_dbaseIV,1 point,Sat Oct 25 02:41:14 2014 UTC,"What?  At my large university, pressures from a variety of accreditation bodies have prompted everyone to adopt the ""learning objective"" philosophy. It's very common out there, and it's not limited to children."

Professors,2jr7gm,sometimesperhaps,6,Mon Oct 20 04:07:16 2014 UTC,"I teach composition at a community college, and one thing that has helped me is grading during individual conferences (ie they have to be there while I grade their papers and talk through what is done well and how to fix areas that need improvement).  They like the individual attention, and it forces them to actually listen to the comments (which often go unread through traditional grading) and think about the paper.  The conferences end up being 10-15 minutes long, and I cancel a class period to do them (it takes longer than the class period, but not any longer than it would take you to grade the papers at home).  I can't say that I have a good work/life balance, but grading in person has made a big difference in my overall well-being.  I also use a lot of pop culture examples and try to make each class as humorous and entertaining as possible - as shows like The Daily Show demonstrate, people tend to learn information better when its delivered in a way that is fun (or as fun as composition can be).  Usually that ends up making it a lot more fun for me too.  I haven't used it in a while, but they love playing classroom Jeopardy games as well.  I wish I had great advice on getting students to behave and take responsibility for themselves, but that is an area I sometimes struggle with myself.  You probably know how much of a disciplinarian you are willing to be - I do my best to be as kind and polite as possible while still making it clear that I will not tolerate disrespectful or disruptive behavior.  ""Barking"" at you is completely unproductive - the students who are doing that need to know that when they behave that way, they are taking time and energy away from the rest of the class.    Feel empowered to do what is reasonable to get class back on track - you deserve for things to go well, and so do your good students who are actually there to learn.  It's all too easy to let them creep into your head and make you feel like you aren't doing as well as you really are.  If you need more objective feedback, try talking to a supportive colleague about what you are doing in class.  Teachers are allowed to make mistakes in class, and they can actually end up being teachable, humanizing moments if played off well.  What works for me is laughing off any mistakes and then correcting them before moving on.  I hope that helps a little!"
Professors,2jr7gm,naruhina84,6,Mon Oct 20 06:20:30 2014 UTC,"It does help; thanks so much for your suggestions and insights. The ""grading live"" thing is a pretty cool idea... made me think it might be interesting to do something like live stream critiques from my office or something like that. Then, they'd have a recording too, to ""rewatch"" my commentary.   I do think I need to start being a bit more stern, in general - in many aspects of my life.  Thanks again. :)"
Professors,2jr7gm,superdooperred,6,Mon Oct 20 19:48:25 2014 UTC,As a student who values their professors who give a damn; thank you for your effort.

Professors,2jr7gm,yugenfire,6,Tue Oct 21 08:30:45 2014 UTC,"Look at it from their viewpoint.  A lot of students, especially at the community college where I teach, see completion of a college degree as a hoop they have to jump through to not be pulverized by the meat grinder of the modern economy.  They hated K-12 education, and now they're faced with something even more academically demanding, which they have to pay for.  And to be honest, a lot of them aren't going to make it.  How could they not be resentful?  The first step to being happy with your work is to understand that most of the douchiness you're experiencing isn't about you.  Accept that there are some problems with people you just can't fix with fifty minutes and a PowerPoint presentation.  Focus on the incremental improvements you're making to your courses each semester, and on the small percentage of students who are into learning.  Also, find a personal project or something else to obsess about besides the job."
Professors,2jr7gm,Soop3rStar,3,Mon Oct 20 20:51:19 2014 UTC,"This is a really interesting point of view to consider... even if I find it rather sad. As I mentioned prior, I think I walked into a lot of this with rose tinted glasses. It is statistically unrealistic to think that they're all going to make it to the finish line... but I really do hate to think that way. I guess this is just something I'm going to need to come to terms with, for the sake of my sanity, if nothing else. I really appreciate your thoughts on this perspective.  This is probably going to sound rather naive, but when I first started teaching (elsewhere), there was just so much emphasis on student success and reach out for at risk students. It really lead me to think that the success of our students is a part of our job. I love teaching, but I don't love coaching people who don't want to be here. I really do, however, want to see them succeed. Again, maybe my expectations just need a reality check.   It is refreshing, however, to hear someone say it's not necessarily ""just me"".  A personal project sounds like a great idea. My mind definitely needs something else, especially as of late. Thanks so much for your thoughts."
Professors,2jr7gm,croak_monsieur,5,Mon Oct 20 21:18:57 2014 UTC,"You should be proud of your achievements, nothing turns out the way we envisioned it, but I can say after 15 years of teaching college, it is not you. Colleges have been using the ""business model"" as a way to expand, and although it is good for some departments, it is horrible for others and horrible for the faculty and the students that do care. Education is not a service industry, it is a complex and difficult exchange between a ""master"" in a field and ""students"" that need or desire knowledge. I have never held more than three students per semester, and hold means, captivate, encourage or help in some way. I still care after a long time and I think it is because I know that I do my best. That is all you can do. You will, in a lifetime of teaching, probably come in contact with several thousand students. If you hold 10% that is huge, I am still in contact with many of my students and to see them care and achieve and be happy makes it all worth it. Fads come and go and this particular group in college are a giant bummer because they are so preoccupied with themselves, that will fade over the next 5 years. Hang in there.  I have a spouse and a kid and I manage a life outside of teaching, it is doable. I guess my advice is this, listen to your body and take the breaks you need to keep your energy. It sounds like you are introverted, which means you need to keep to yourself to get recharged. There are plenty of people who like introverts or are them, sounds like you outgrew some of your friends, sucks, but be true to yourself. Keep up the good work, the world needs people who care for more than themselves and remember that your job is not just to teach your students a topic, it's to help them navigate this world as citizens and decent people."
Professors,2jr7gm,naruhina84,5,Mon Oct 20 13:32:25 2014 UTC,"15 years, wow! That's wonderful - and I'm glad to hear it's not ""just me"".   When I really stop and ""count"", in my head, the three student count here actually sounds about correct. I typically have a small hand full that really ""want it""; these students really show promise, and I just get the feeling that they're going to go very far. I guess it's crazy to think that every student is going to come around... I just have a hard time understanding why someone would even bother showing up to a college class if they don't care. It seems like such a waste of time and money. I suppose ""don't care"" is a little harsh, but when your work is consistently poor and the visible effort is so minimal... I don't know how else to describe that.   On a happy note, I think you're right. I think I could use some recharge time, both mentally and physically. Thanks so much for your insights here.

Professors,2jr7gm,facecudds,4,Mon Oct 20 19:56:22 2014 UTC,"This is off topic of your question because I am a student, not a professor to give you advice. However, in my criminology course I did extra research on my professor, read his published work and realized he's actually a very smart and critical thinker. I'm not majoring in criminology so this ultimately does nothing for me.. (I've been given advice to read professors papers to land a job)  But just because I'm not majoring in the course doesn't mean I can't offer a compliment to his hard work. So today after writing my midterm, I grew the balls to let him know I am honored to be his student for the latter... I realize my peers are quite apathetic and sometimes the professor, too, needs recognition for their hard work.  And so I said to you, thank you for your hard work. :) you deserve the recognition.

Professors,2jmg1s,Dr_Pizzas,7,Sat Oct 18 17:57:21 2014 UTC,"What do you mean by extra? How many response options were you planning? 4? 5? Honestly, I have trouble making up 4 wrong but reasonable answer choices most of the time for a MC test, so I usually do 4 answer options. I definitely have some ?'s that have none/all of the above as an answer option. I also use 'all of the following are_____ EXCEPT:' questions. 50 MC ?'s is definitely a small enough number for a 90 min. time frame. I have 27 MC with 5 short answer AND an essay in a 50 min. session. Unless you're having them do lots of math calculations or something for these MC ?'s, they'll all be done within an hour and most done within 30 min. No study guide. Esp. because you're reviewing the class beforehand. My personal philosophy is that I cover everything I really want them to know in class and then I test them on everything I really want them to know. Which means I don't have time nor want to bother putting in some question from the book on a topic I didn't think was worth the time to cover in class. But just about everything we discuss in class makes it into my exams in one form or another. If you adhere to this philosophy as well, just tell them to study their notes because that's where the questions come from. I don't curve, but that's never been a problem for me (b/c I test them on what I covered and they know that, I almost always have a handful of students that make a perfect score. A handful always fail too, but that's the way it goes.) I think curving is inappropriate if you know what you want them to master and test them appropriately. Whoever meets mastery should get the grade they earned. If they didn't meet mastery, well they didn't meet it.   And it doesn't matter how fair you are, someone in a group that large will complain. Shake it off and keep on keeping on."
Professors,2jmg1s,at1stsite,4,Sat Oct 18 19:16:16 2014 UTC,"I disagree with #3, particularly since OP sounds like a new professor who needs to be careful about teaching evaluations. I give hard exams, and early in my career I caught a lot of complaints on my course evaluations about being unfair, difficult, etc. So, I started putting together what are basically the most useless review sheets for my exams: a long list of questions, organized by lecture, that simply covers the entirety of what I taught during the period covered by the exam. The review sheet gives them no guidance whatsoever on what to study or what to ignore, and the questions are written broadly enough that I can test on whatever content I want and point back to the review sheet afterwards to say that I told them to study it. Assembling one of these takes maybe 30 minutes. Despite giving them no objective benefit, students are extremely pleased to have the review sheet and feel that the same testing process is much more fair because I was considerate and gave them prep resources. It is absolutely nothing more than a procedural fairness manipulation, yet it almost completely suppressed the exam complaints on my evaluations."
Professors,2jmg1s,galileosmiddlefinger,2,Sun Oct 19 14:00:02 2014 UTC,"Sure, you can do the useless review sheet, but that still takes time. If you never gave them any direction at the beginning of the course, this might be a good idea for the first test. These are jrs and not freshman, though, so I think it's overcoddling (personal ethic on how I'll treat young adults almost about to start their careers).  Instead, I tell them exactly what they should study (all the notes from class, and I've clarified from the get go the importance of notes, speak very slowly when they need to write a key point down - repeating myself several times until everyone's got it), and they know the test format as well (MC, short answer, essay). I actually ask them to report how fair they think the test is at the end of the test (1 to 5 scale), along with how hard they think it is (1 to 5 scale). The average fairness is always 4.5+."

Use these sparingly. And avoid ""A and B but not C""/""A and C but not B"" options completely. Seriously. Generally, 4 options is just fine and 5 max. Four choices with 3 good distractors is a great standard that will help you better see what your students misunderstand while adequately differentiating student performance (assuming you have an appropriate spread of item difficulties).    Less chance of guessing should mean a more accurate test, right?   Adding answer choices doesn't lessen the chance of guessing, just reduces the chances of any randomly guessed response being correct. The tradeoff is that you give the student more sand to sift and run the risk of increasing construct irrelevant variance as you add to the complexity of the options (e.g., with ""A, B, and D, but not C"")   How many questions is too many?   Depends on the course content, the number of chapters covered, etc. Try making a test blueprint so that you 1) keep your unit objectives in focus and 2) make sure to map questions to objectives with appropriate weighting. Don't fall into the trap of trying to make most/all of the items clever/challenging.    How much information do you give students before the exam?    As much as they want, short of the actual questions (and sometimes I give a few of those anyway, if they're important essays). I think of exams as both assessment tools and teaching tools, so I have no interest in making them play guessing games about what material will be covered in what proportion/depth. I figure it's part of my job to clearly identify for them the things that they should know, then test them on their ability to learn those things. Having them guess at what's important enough to study is both pointless and unfair--they don't have years of experience and expertise in the subject domain, so they're not qualified to judge and would only be guessing at my choices.    Would you curve the exam if the students bomb?   I've never curved an exam and can't imagine I ever will. Curving the exam either 1) admits it was unfairly constructed, 2) admits the material was poorly taught, or 3) sends the message that the students aren't judged against an objective criterion but rather against the performance of their peers (#3 is palatable especially if it's a true curve and not just ""everyone gets 20 points free!"", but I prefer criteron-referenced tests in my courses). Regardless, I think giving points for poor performance promotes poor performance in the future. Like /u/fgf10 said, as an alternative, you could have students do test corrections so that any supplemental points would be earned by demonstrating learning."
Professors,2jmg1s,evenfalsethings,3,Sun Oct 19 02:24:06 2014 UTC,"There is lots of good advice in other responses. I have a few bits of advice to add.   Avoid questions from textbook publishers. They're usually terrible. Well, that's my field. YMMV.   When writing foil answers, consider how someone might answer if they've never taken your class. You don't want the jokers who didn't pay attention or do the readings to guess lots of questions correctly just based on contextual clues.    After the exam, evaluate how well your students do on each question. If you can identify poor questions, you can win friends with students while still being on the side of the angels by telling students you're giving everyone credit for that question because there must have been something accidentally misleading or tricky about it.   Keep a record of the well-performing questions for future recycling. You can build a personal test bank."
Professors,2jmg1s,zombie_dbaseIV,2,Sun Oct 19 04:39:55 2014 UTC,"I always include these.  I also include a red herring answer that's plausible, but that a good working knowledge of the topic would preclude.  Crafting a good multiple choice question should measure knowledge, not recall.  I budget time this way: Thirty seconds per matching question.  One minute per multiple choice, true/false, or fill in the blank question.  Five minutes for short response (five sentences or less), ten minutes for essay (six sentences or more).  I'm also fairly lenient on letting students come to my office with me to finish the exam if that is possible. I give out study guides to appease my freshmen and sophomores, but in reality the study guide is just the lecture slides typed out in a hierarchical bullet list.  Junior and senior-level courses receive no study guide.  I do provide a detailed description of the exam format a week ahead of time.  This includes time limits, quantity and format of questions.  If the exam covers multiple chapters/units, I give them a rough idea of how much each chapter is represented. This topic was covered really well in a recent post.  I utilize the method employed by /u/manova: I take the highest score and add enough points to make it a 100, and follow suit for all of the others.  If the highest score is a real outlier, I will go to the next highest score and do the same thing.  I feel like the smartest normal person (not some freak genius) should be able to ace my exams.   If you fuck up the exam and make it too hard, and the whole class bombs it, just tell them they can correct the exams for partial credit (anywhere from 1/10th to 1/4 of the points they missed can be recovered).  This is a good technique to help them focus on the material they goofed, instead of just looking at their scores and forgetting the material ever existed.  If you're really enterprising, you can ask them to correct the mistakes in a long form, essay-style format."
Professors,2jmg1s,FGF10,2,Sat Oct 18 19:53:52 2014 UTC,How do you manage the point recovery if your students become aware of it? When I was an undergrad I was always looking for ways to game the system. If I got a B and could do something to get a B+ I would do it.

Professors,2jd0tq,trululul,21,Wed Oct 15 22:24:06 2014 UTC,"I taught freshman English for 5 years. Students actively loathed having to take the class, especially if they had previously failed it and were on their second or third go-around.  I usually addressed the issue on the first day of class and led a brainstorm / discussion session over ways to find value in the course. I asked questions like ""What do you want to get out of this course? What could you accomplish this semester that would make you feel that this course was a good use of your time?"" Near the end of this first class, I would compile their comments into a massive ""goals list"" and upload them to the CMS. This was usually a very successful strategy. Students seemed to appreciate the honest dialogue, and I would revisit the conversation throughout the semester to remind them of the goals they had established for themselves.  To deal with the attendance problem, I established an attendance policy and took roll every day. This wasn't popular, of course, but I would rather be an effective instructor than a popular one. Students are more likely to pass if they attend, so I required them to do so."

Professors,2jd0tq,McDoof,6,Tue Nov 11 06:11:11 2014 UTC,"I used to teach a public speaking course. I think it may top the list of the most hated freshman requirement! :) I agree with the previous poster that making the content more personal can help. I did this by having them do short speeches they may actually have to do in real life (like asking their parents for money, or informing a friend about a new club or something that they should check out) and have the students anonymously provide the speaker feedback such as ""This argument may have convinced me more"" or ""If you changed your tone you might be more convincing"".   Personally I always felt as an undergrad that I didn't care so much if the class content was boring as long as the professor seemed to be passionate about it. I always tried to pump myself up before class so I had energy while teaching and I would keep my lectures fresh by adding current news or examples each semester. For some reason my student have always liked it when I use personal stories as examples as well. Something about revealing my own faults invited them to take me more seriously and see me as someone they didn't mind coming to chat with in office hours or listen when I had something valuable to say.   Those are just a few things that worked for me! I'm sure it really depends on the class you teach and sometimes it really is just an incompatible group of students that you are stuck with for the semester."

It becomes a challenge for me to try to find contexts they appreciate and recognize the value of learning about culture and communication.    Fortunately, I'm not yet the perpetually bored professor recycling lecture notes I've been using for a dozen semesters.  My own enthusiasm for the topic seems to convince the students there might be some value in the courses. Works for me, but after reading the other posts, I see I'm fortunate.

Having been denied such security, I can tell you that it is both incredibly stressful (having neared a nervous breakdown myself)  and totally not worth the worrying at the same time. While you are in it, you obsess about papers, conferences, sympisia, talks, publication, cliques, office politics, teaching, reviewing, grading, writing and revising....and you cannot see the forest for all the trees people put in your way. I wish I could offer you and your SO a silver bullet to take his mind off of the dangly carrot they call tenure, but I can't. Trying to distract him might make him resent you or thank you. Trying to be supportive might make you silent where he needs you to speak up for him.   As others have pointed out, being denied tenure is not uncommon and there may be other institutions which will be glad to have him. Also, tenure might not be all that it is cracked up to be and while it seems like the logical conclusion of his academic life, it might not be the best one for him.   Good luck and my thoughts are with you and him."
Professors,2j3p7r,VetMichael,2,Mon Oct 13 15:50:26 2014 UTC,"Is this normal?    Most everyone worries about not getting tenure. If they decide he's done his job well enough, they'll give him a permanent job. If not -- even if it's not quite good enough -- they'll fire him. It's a weird promotion model, right?  The tenure process is typically nerve wracking for the young professor.    How common is it for someone not to get tenure?     It certainly happens. We all know people who didn't get it. Some universities deny tenure more often than others, so it's very difficult to make a comment on his situation.    Perhaps your underlying question is whether he's correct when he says he's unlikely to get tenure. He knows his own performance in publication, teaching, and social impact in the department (""collegiality""). Plus, he knows the history of his department, including the performance of peers who have been denied tenure. So, he's in an excellent position to evaluate his odds. However, with so much at stake, it's sometimes hard to be clear-headed about evaluating those odds. I have found that even rock stars who are practically a lock for tenure get worried when their tenure review comes around.    What are some things I can do to help him?    It's very kind of you to be thinking about this!  I'm reluctant to say much here because I know almost nothing about him or how serious his stress is, but I'll tell you this: when I was going up for tenure, one thing that helped me get through the stress was to realize that even if I didn't get tenure, I would still be okay. I considered what my prospects would be if I had to go back onto the job market, and I could see that I would always have a place in the industry. Fully accepting that a tenure rejection would not be the end of my career helped reduce my stress. Said differently, what helped me was having a way forward even if I was denied tenure.   Another thing that helped me was setting an hourly chime on my phone. When it went off, I would pause my work and take a minute or so to clear my head and meditate. Then I would pray -- not about tenure necessarily but about connecting better with God. That helped me a lot.   The tenure review may be a uniquely academic tradition, but intense stress is a common human problem. As his SO, you can have a big influence on his stress!  Good for you for being willing to help him."

You'll move to another school and life will go on.  We will figure it out.""  Knowing that I have a partner who would help me, support me, and love me makes all the difference in my mindset and prevents the nervous breakdown!  He also told me one time, ""You know what?  Tenure isn't real.  You know what's real?  Playing Legos with our 7 year old.  He's never even asked me what I do all day for a job.  He doesn't give a damn what I do all day at work or where I do it.  He just wants me to play Legos with him.  That's real.""    Really put it in perspective for me."
Professors,2j3p7r,InvisibleManiac,2,Thu Oct 16 01:41:29 2014 UTC,"Most professors do not have tenure, and that's not good.  No more than one-third of all college and university faculty members are tenured. The reason? More and more colleges are relying on part-time or temporary nontenure-track faculty to teach undergraduates --- part-timers constituted about 38 percent of the professoriate in 1987 and grew to 43 percent in 1992.   http://www.nea.org/home/33067.htm  The bad news? It is very common to not get tenure.   The good news? While generally getting tenure is always a good thing, how much it matters REALLY matters can vary wildly from institution to institution, and sometimes even from department to department. Your mileage may vary. A lot of it comes down to where you want to work, how you want to work, what you're willing to work for, and who you're willing to work with. Not getting tenure might or might not be a complete deal breaker for everyone, but sit down together and figure out if it really is, and if it is, have a contingency for that.   What can you do to help? Talk. Listen. Understand. Help him understand that it's not necessarily any judgement on them or their performance. It might not matter how good of a job he does, there simply might not be any tenured positions available. His department may love him, but the University may say no to the department. The Department, and University may both love him, and the State Budget Office may still say no. It's tough to not take things like that personally, but sometimes fates are tied to budget decisions hundreds of miles away. Point is, there are large economic forces and trends working their way through higher education, and it almost certainly isn't a judgement of his ability, talent, or dedication if he doesn't get it.   Best of luck!"

Professors,2ix1pn,silverdae,12,Sat Oct 11 03:23:29 2014 UTC,"Adding a percentage of points back for correcting their test is probably the best way because you make them work for it, but I agree with you, it is a pain in the ass with 65 students.  On the other hand, not all of them will do the extra work.  It is also okay that they did not miss the same questions.  Re-working the test is an individual exercise that allows the student to find out what they did wrong.  I have done this in the past, though rarely.    What I usually do is take the top grade, bring it up to 100 and add that many points to everyone's grade.  If there was a clear outlier, I go to the next highest score and just give that one person a grade over 100.  If several people do really well, then I announce to the class that it was possible to ace the test because several people did.   If I add points, I always do it with a caveat.  I recognize that there may have been questions that were poorly worded or confusing.  By adding points, I am giving the student those points in advance.  If I curve, I will not entertain arguments about how many points I took off for whatever reason.  I took 5 points off for your essay, but you think I should have only taken 2 off, fine, I already did that, in fact, I already gave you 5 points.  I will only discuss their test if I made a math error in calculating their grade or I marked something wrong on a non-subjective question (multiple choice, matching, etc.).  If the student wants to argue points with me, I tell them that I will first take away the curve and then we can start talking about their essay answers.  This eliminates 95% of angry student questions following exams (I also go over every exam in class so that the content aspect is well covered).  When I first started, I would not curve tests and then curve their final grade.  I now curve the test and leave their final grade alone.  This is bad to admit, but I do this for the teaching evals.  When students have bad grades on the exams, they feel bad and they take it out on the evals.  They fill out the evals before they see their final grade which may end up being a letter grade higher than their exams.  On the other hand, when they have better grades on their initial exams, they tend to be kinder on the evals.  Now here is the really bad part.  Let's say that because of the curves, the class GPA is too high.  Since the students complete their evals before the final, I may choose to not curve the final to bring the student's grades back in line with expectations."

Professors,2ix1pn,Deradius,5,Sun Oct 12 02:57:12 2014 UTC,"First, and to perhaps state the obvious, if the mean comes out to something around a 70% or higher, things are fine and I wouldn't worry.  However, if the mean is significantly below 70% I might think about making an adjustment.  You have a couple of options.  Easy Option -  Calculate the number of points missed for each exam.  (Just do 100 - (test score) for each student to get the points missed.)  Multiply the number of points missed by something less than one.  (0.90.  0.80.  0.70.  Experiment until the grade distribution looks the way you want.)  This has an advantage over the 'round the highest up to 100' method, because it helps students with the lowest grades disproportionately more than it helps students with the highest grades.    Example:  Let's say you choose a cofactor of .80.  Jimbo scored a 90.  He missed 10 points.  After the adjustment (10 * 0.80), he missed 8 points.  So now he has a 92.  Gomer scored a 50.  He missed 50 points.  After the adjustment (50 * .80), he missed 40 points.  So he now has a 60.  Jimbo only gets 2 points added, which is fine, he didn't need them.  Gomer gets 10.    This drags the whole lower tail of the distribution up.    Time Consuming Option  Do an item analysis.  This page has a good explanation of how to do it.  Items that most students missed, or that don't discriminate well between high scorers or low scorers, should be tossed out with credit given to all students.  Toss out questions beginning with the absolute worst (almost everyone missed it and it doesn't tell you who studied vs. who didn't) and moving up until you get a distribution you like.  This will tell you something about how you write tests, and will also tell you something about how much your students learned.  It's good, but it eats up a lot of time on the back end of the grading process."
Professors,2ix1pn,I_want_hard_work,2,Sat Oct 11 10:30:58 2014 UTC,Both of these options sound really good.
Professors,2ix1pn,thegapinglotus,5,Sat Oct 11 19:44:30 2014 UTC,"Yes, I have definitely curved exams after too many people failed. I simply tell then that apparently the exam was too hard and that to even things out a bit and not ruin their GPAs I am choosing to curve the exam. I let them know I'm doing them a favor, while expressing slight disappointment because they obviously did not study."
Professors,2ix1pn,mwbysw,3,Sat Oct 11 05:42:56 2014 UTC,"I'm in the humanities, not STEM, but this has happened to me with quizzes before.

Professors,2ix1pn,BLB99,3,Sat Oct 11 05:51:18 2014 UTC,"I don't technically curve, but if the grades are lower than I like and I feel like the exam was too difficult I will just ""throw out"" some questions and give everyone credit for them, which boosts all of the grades."
Professors,2ix1pn,BLB99,1 point,Sat Oct 11 06:04:03 2014 UTC,"I like this idea... but how do you deal with the 1%, the top, exceptional kids?  Do you just let them have a great grade?"
Professors,2ix1pn,YourFavoriteBandSux,2,Sat Oct 11 06:32:31 2014 UTC,"Basically, yes.  I usually only have 1 or 2 students that do exceptionally well on an exam.  After I drop some questions this will typically put them at 100% or maybe even a point or two above 100%, but I don't have a problem with this considering they are probably going to get an A in the class anyway.  I think this is a good middle ground between curving and not curving and it gives you the professor a lot of discretion concerning what the exam scores look like."

It's well written and includes digressions when appropriate.   Hopefully that will be of some help to weigh your options. Lately I have been holding off on curving until the end of the semester, and choose a grading scale that fits the class. This is common at my university. Most students hate this method for its opacity."

Professors,2il46m,starryophonic,10,Tue Oct 7 19:13:16 2014 UTC,"For assignments and exams that I return to students with my feedback, I keep a text file with common comments that I can copy and paste into the documents. Grading becomes choosing comment 4, comment 12, and a modified version of comment 2.   This increases my efficiency not only this semester but next time. Plus, my comments are better worded (uzing wurds moar bettar) because I've honed the comments over time."
Professors,2il46m,zombie_dbaseIV,5,Tue Oct 7 21:23:03 2014 UTC,"If you're doing marginalia, cut down on marginalia.  Very few students are going to read them all anyway.  If you're writing a letter at the end, focus on just one or two main points to keep it quick.  For something that takes a while to explain in writing, ask a student to meet with you in person.  If possible, for the last paper, see if you can get away with only returning comments to students who request comments (e.g., make the paper due the last day of class and then ask students to bring in an SASE if they want comments).  It took me a while to stop feeling guilty about this, but I learned that of 50-something students every term, only 5-10 actually wanted those last comments.  I think, ultimately, if they couldn't change their grade, they just didn't care if it took even minimal effort on their part."

Professors,2il46m,herennius,2,Tue Oct 7 19:38:27 2014 UTC,"I use a standard rubric that everyone who teaches this class is required to use. I think at first it was time consuming simply because I'm new to teaching and needed to figure out how each paper met the criteria. Now that I've had a few assignments, I'm much better at identifying where a student lies in each category in a pretty quick manner, and I'm sure I'll get even faster over time, but I was just wondering if anyone had any tips."
Professors,2il46m,herennius,2,Tue Oct 7 19:41:25 2014 UTC,"I hear you--it's just difficult to offer tips when I only have a general sense of what you're doing in your grading process.  It sounds like you've got a decent handle on things, so I can only suggest advice like ""Don't take more than X minutes per paper"" and ""If there are multiple instances of the same issue throughout the paper, only mark the first one and comment for the student that the issue appears repeatedly and s/he should attend to that concern for future assignments."""
Professors,2il46m,andimac,3,Tue Oct 7 19:47:05 2014 UTC,"I used to use macros in Word for comments. It worked pretty well, since I used the same comments over and over again, and it was easier then copy/pasting."
Professors,2il46m,b-minus,2,Wed Oct 8 00:06:11 2014 UTC,"All of the advice in here is sound so far. Have a detailed rubric for each assignment. The explanations on the rubric will cut down on the need for extensive comments on particular issues. For writing-intensive courses, it might also be a good idea to use an online platform like Pearson's MyWritingLab or McGraw Hill's Connect Composition. With these programs, you can build in rubrics, save your common comments for later use, etc. They also integrate completely with whatever LMS you are using so your grades can be imported straight into your grade book. Failing that (as that would likely have to be a department-wide adoption), most LMS platforms these days have built-in electronic grading options (rubrics, commenting features, etc.). Play around in whatever platform you are using to see what functions it has.  Additionally, work on finding a balance to your level of commenting. As others have noted, you may think you are doing students a favor by extensively commenting on their essays, but it is quite possible that students are not even reading all of your comments. It's not necessarily because they do not want to; students can sometimes be overwhelmed by the amount of feedback and simply shut down. There is such a thing as commenting too much.  The more experience you have, the more you will learn what's best for you and your students."

Throw them into the air down the staircase.  They should separate in the air along a normal distribution.  Assign descending letter grades to the stairs and record them.

I will be more than happy to meet with anyone at a later time to talk.""  I feel that ignoring it only works to isolate other students who might be depressed or even suicidal themselves.  Just THIS semester, I've had 2 students come to me with suicidal thoughts and I've not only kept in close touch with them, but referred them immediately to our counseling services.  For so many of our college students, their classes and fellow students are the most important thing in their lives...they do build up comraderie and need things like this addressed to validate their own importance in your college community.

Especially, but not necessarily, if the institution you're at now is significantly different than where you got your doctorate (e.g., R1 to SLAC, ivy to public, etc). It does get better with time.   Also, I have found that when an institution requires you to teach in an area that is not part of your primary or even secondary focus within your field, it is much easier to feel down about your abilities as you prep to teach it the first time around.

What I thought were great experiential projects turned out to be less than mediocre. It was a mess. But there were great days, too.  Don't judge yourself too harshly. Every single first year teacher on the planet goes through this. Wait until the end of the semester when you can read your student evaluations. You will see that you were much more effective than you thought.   SEEK SUPPORT from other professors in your department. This will show them that you are not afraid to admit your shortcomings and that you strive to improve your teaching. They will really be impressed by this.

I have a faculty mentor who thinks very highly of me but I'm afraid he just hasn't realized how much of a disappointment I am. He knows the mistakes I've made and is always supportive, but he doesn't know what I think of myself. I always try to keep my self-deprecating thoughts to...you know, myself.

Professors,2iblyv,coldgator,11,Sun Oct 5 01:11:04 2014 UTC,"You need to give them full credit. Part of the informed consent is informing them that they don't have to participate and are doing it voluntarily. If you are holding credit over them as an incentive they are not voluntarily participating.   When in doubt go back to the documents you submitted to the university IRB. The details should be spelled out in the humans subject section of your research proposal. Any time you give compensation (whether money or course credit) to research participants your research proposal gets an extra level of scrutiny by the board.  If in doubt e-mail your IRB coordinator, they will bring this up for discussion at the meeting and give you guidance on what to do. The IRB at your institution may be different from the one where I work, but generally they are very helpful despite the hatred heaped upon them by some researchers.  *Source: I was on the IRB for a year."
Professors,2iblyv,donasay,4,Sun Oct 5 04:34:21 2014 UTC,Absolutely this. IRBs should prohibit students from receiving any incentive for participating in clinical trials led by their instructors/professors as this can be viewed as undue influence (students being hesitant in declining participation with fear of retribution). In fact  I don't believe they should participate at all for the same reason.   Now this can be countered if a neutral third party is used to handle the consenting process and data collection so that the professor is not aware of who is participating OR if a viable alternative is given for those students who decline in the case of class credit given.

At most universities that use this kind of system, students get a penalty for signing up for an experiment but not showing up at all.

Professors,2iblyv,ZeldaZing,2,Sun Oct 5 03:18:42 2014 UTC,I would talk to your IRB or department chair. I've never done a research project where the compensation was student credit (as in a full credit... maybe some points). Usually there's something about a prorate but I don't think that can work here.  Also is it considered incentive or compensation?
Professors,2iblyv,zombie_dbaseIV,1 point,Sun Oct 5 04:31:22 2014 UTC,"I guess it's considered incentive, they're required to earn a certain amount of credits or else they get an incomplete in the course (which is just a regular intro course with other assignments that constitute the grade), but they have to participate in several studies to earn all the required credits."
Professors,2iblyv,ZeldaZing,3,Sun Oct 5 13:44:23 2014 UTC,"I agree with the principle that students should not be coerced into research. However in the event that there are alternative ways of earning the same amount of credit, there is no coercion. If they read the informed consent but then decide not to participate, they should receive no penalty, but also no credit.   On a related note, the NRC has recently revised their recommendations regarding IRB review of social sciences research. The new interpretations is that IRB review is not necessary for much of our research. APS also published an editorial recently describing these changes."

Some people, however, aren't interested in the course and I don't want those people in my classroom. Best case scenario they are taking up space, worst case scenario they are causing a distraction for the students who do want to be there.  I tell my students on the first day that if they don't want to pay attention in class then they should stay home. They are adults now, they can make their own decisions.

Professors,2i0zsn,digshake,11,Wed Oct 1 22:51:48 2014 UTC,"I feel like this is pretty common.  You don't mention whether this course is early in their education (freshmen/sophomores) or later (juniors/seniors).  I am a biologist, and my intro. course and sophomore A&P course always have extremely high rates of absences.  Not coincidentally, these classes are among the most failed at my university.  Paradoxically, my most difficult classes (cell biology, molecular biology, and biochemistry) are the best-attended and have the lowest rates of failure.  It's a self-selection mechanism.  If a student can't be bothered to attend their intro. to thermodynamics course and do the requisite work, then the rest of the program isn't going to be any more alluring to them.  My advice is to emphasize that attendance directly correlates with grades, and then move on.  The onus is on you to make the course enriching and informative, not entertaining.  STEM fields in particular require timely dedication to coursework.  Honestly?  I specifically do not count attendance in my classes because I would rather have a half-filled auditorium than a full auditorium with 30 kids texting or listening to music distracting the students who care enough to take notes and participate."
Professors,2i0zsn,FGF10,2,Wed Oct 1 22:28:19 2014 UTC,"I totally agree with FGF10, but you can actually have the self-selection mechanism working for you... But this will only work if the students can decide to take your course or not and if the students are informed about what you do. And you will have to suffer the first year when you will apply this strategy...  Here is the process: 1) you say you don't mind if they don't show up. Indeed, as u/digshake explains bad students that are forced to attend waste everybody's time. 2) you make sure (a) your course is useful and relevant with regards to the way you evaluate the students (in my case, it's project based, meaning that what I teach is relevant and useful for completing those projects successfully). And that (b) the project (or exam) is relevant for the student's expected career. This will make the students willing to succeed willing to attend your class. 3) (and here is the trick), you make your course more demanding than anybody else teaching the same topic.  Mechanically, over time, you will have less lazy/weak/free-rider students. They will be informed by the other students that ""if you want to pass easily, don't take OP's course"". In contrast, you will only have driven/hard-working students, and you will be able to raise the expectations of your course, and in parallel the usefulness of the teaching you provide... This will be a virtuous circle based on self-selection..."

If the students don't want to get up and come to class, don't want to do homework, and don't want to participate in class, they will eventually fail at life.  It's your job to teach them how to figure out thermodynamics, not to make it fun at 8 am.  Maybe they will come to class more when they are taking it for the second time because they failed this semester."
Professors,2i0zsn,themetz,4,Thu Oct 16 02:07:15 2014 UTC,"I have mainly freshman in my courses. I want to get them in the habit of attending all of their class sessions so I:   Clearly state in my syllabus if attendance is required or not. Spell out the consequences of missing class. For my once a week classes in a 16 week semester, I allow 3 absences, the 4th will result in a full letter grade drop of the final grade, and the 5th will result in an F for the semester.  Give quizzes in class that cannot be made up. For instance, I give 10 quizzes that are worth 2% of the final grade over the semester. It's no big deal to miss one or two, but missing a lot adds up quickly.  Do lab work each class. This cannot be made up except during the ONE designated make-up day at the end of the semester, so missing more than one lab is unwise. Do NOT go outside of your stated office hours to accommodate students who ask to make up in-class work that they should have been in class to do in the first place. It's not your problem. Let them know that you get paid whether they pass the class or not. There's a nicer way to put it, but you know what I mean."

If it is a mix of people, not your fault either, it is just they are probably unconsciously alternating sleeping in.  :)  I have a feeling your 65% is a bit misleading though.  It sounds like you have a high percentage of absences, but if your class has 20 students, 6 are missing on a regular basis and 14 are usually there."

I'd probably include first generation students and low-income students, too.  If you have any experience working with (particularly mentoring) people who don't fit the typical mold of your discipline, then you should highlight that in your letter of intent.   (2) seems pretty self-explanatory to me (and I'm assuming the bracketed aside is yours). They expect you to bring in research money. If you know that it would require significant equipment purchases, then you should be ready to talk about what those are (and definitely negotiate money for it in your start-up package, should you get an offer). It should be a huge warning sign to you if they expect you to bring in funding without first having the necessary equipment."

If you worked on a grant or co-authored a grant, that's a very good thing to highlight.  My favorite encryption algorythm is the ""women and minorities are especially encouraged to apply.""  It may was well read ""No Irish."""
Professors,2hmblx,GhotiStyx,5,Sat Sep 27 18:14:03 2014 UTC,"""women and minorities are especially encouraged to apply.""   Always reads to me as ""we have to say this.""  Because they do.  As to the grants part, I understand they want faculty members to get grants, but what kind of research program can these schools really expect to build?  They don't have modern facilities, graduate students, or postdocs.  You can't apply for an NIH R01 at schools like this, or any of the other ""big"" grants.   For almost any researcher who does something other that strictly analytical theory (even computational work requires computational facilities these days), what can they really expect?  Do they want hobby labs so their students can apply to grad school with something on their CV or do they expect actual impactful research?    Most of the faculty at this type of school seems to publish, if at all, is very small journals for local societies like the Journal of the Wisconsin Botanitcal Garden.  I am all for teaching over research (or research over teaching), I just want to understand what they really expect given what they can offer."

Professors,2hce05,theregoesjulie,6,Wed Sep 24 16:44:03 2014 UTC,"Not quite a seasoned vet, but here's what I would say:  Best piece of advice? Follow the directions.  I'll repeat myself, because you probably didn't catch that. FOLLOW THE F&@#$¥© DIRECTIONS!  Too many people send in applications for jobs with a cover letter or personal statement far longer than the 1000 words that we ask for (we got one that was 10 pages long last year).  You know what that says to me? You can't read and follow directions, which means you're going to be a really annoying colleague who's probably going to get in trouble or worse, get the department in trouble.  Your application goes straight into the trash.  Aside from that, here's a list of things you could do to increase your chances:  1a) Personalize your cover letter for each school you apply to.  No, this doesn't mean that you write an entirely unique letter from the ground up for each school, but you should at least mention the school's name in the letter and the person to whom you are writing to (Dear Dr. Jones, not Dear Hiring Committee Chair).  You should also try to find out what classes they need taught for the upcoming year and mention that, while you interested in teaching a variety of classes, you are particularly interested in teaching those classes.  To find those, take a look at what courses are listed as TBA for the professor for the upcoming Fall semester if possible.  If you can't find that information, try to guess which ones are least popular and sign up for those.  Odds are, you'll be able to figure it out.  1b)  Related - personalize your teaching philosophy to be in line with the school's mission statement.  Again, you want to show that you know what you're getting into and that you are excited about the opportunity and that you would be a great fit for them.  2) Acknowledge that you have been tremendously fortunate to have worked with Dr. X, Dr. Y, and Dr. Z throughout your graduate school career.  Gaining employment with University Alpha would allow you to continue learning more from its esteemed colleagues as well because your research interests align closely with theirs (spin it somehow if need be).  3) Get business cards if you don't already have them and bring at least 100 of them to the job fair/professional conferences you will attend.  Make it your goal to run out of business cards without just shoving them in peoples faces.  This means talking to them in a friendly manner (actively listening, etc) and getting them interested in you.  4) When you are at the conference, have a zip file of all of your application materials saved on your phone.  Be ready to email them to people that you meet at a moment's notice.  A quick note like, ""Dear so and so, I really enjoyed talking to you tonight and would love to continue it.  You mentioned that you were hiring this upcoming year and I would love to be considered for the position.  I've attached a zip folder containing my CV, teaching philosophy, statement of research, teaching evaluations, etc for your review. Should you require any additional materials, please let me know and I will get them to you right away.""  5) This should go without saying, but if you happen to bump into someone from a school you applied to and haven't heard back from, don't mention it to them.  You were probably rejected.  6) Set aside several (4+) hours per day to work on this.  Do this every day.  Applying to jobs is now your job.  You should be nearing completion of your dissertation, so now the really fun work begins.  Use the McDonald's test when selecting schools to apply to.  Would you rather work there or at McDonald's?  If the answer is there, apply.  If the answer is McDonald's, reconsider what you've been working on for the last 5 years :-P  Your goal is to maximize the number of offers you get.  You won't get offers if you don't apply, so apply and apply early.  7) Have a personal website.  Make it professional looking and buy an actual domain (they're cheap, don't worry).  I made mine in Blogger in 45 minutes and bought the domain name on GoDaddy for $35 for 3 years.  And I have ZERO web skills.  I think that about does it.  Note that this doesn't mean that you will get a job.  They're still tough to come by.  But if you do these things, you'll set yourself up very nicely come interview time."
Professors,2hce05,ChargerEcon,2,Wed Sep 24 21:15:18 2014 UTC,"This is quite comprehensive - thank you so much for your suggestions! Some of these are particularly clever (e.g., having a zip file ready for conferences). I guess the real question is, how picky do I have a right to be about the location? Probably not too picky.."
Professors,2hce05,ChargerEcon,4,Wed Sep 24 22:17:33 2014 UTC,"My advice on that would be this:  You haven't earned the right to be picky yet. Apply to every job you are qualified for because, trust me, for people like you and I, the worst tenure track academic job is better than the best private sector job (adjunct is perhaps different). If/when you start getting offers (not on-campus interviews, offers. Go to every on-campus interview you get), then you can be picky.   You want to do everything in your power to get A job. Once you have that locked down, then you can start trying to get the perfect job.   EDIT:  Sorry if I'm sounding harsh or anything - I really don't mean to.  It's just that I've seen a lot of very bright people make such silly mistakes when it comes to the job market like limiting themselves to a specific region/state.  Obviously, if you have a significant other and they absolutely refuse to move to, say, Minnesota, then you shouldn't bother applying to schools in Minnesota unless you're willing to do a long distance relationship.  In general, though, you're going to be lucky to get a job, period, unless you're coming from a top-tier program and have a solid publication/teaching record.  The job market for academics is very challenging.  I don't usually like articles from Slate, but this one is shockingly accurate:  http://www.slate.com/articles/life/education/2014/09/how_do_professors_get_hired_the_academic_job_search_explained.html?wpsrc=sh_all_dt_tw_bot  EDIT II:  Last edit, I promise.  The final piece of advice I would give is this - you're not done with the job market until your contract with the school is signed, sealed, and delivered AND the HR department has officially processed it and put it in their system. Once all of this is done, then you can relax and celebrate your new job.  I wish you nothing but luck.  PM me or post here if you have any other questions and I'll do my best to answer them."

Professors,2h027s,_wellthereyougo_,3,Sun Sep 21 03:56:14 2014 UTC,"Writing teacher here. I've been seeing more and more research about and praising the use of multimodality in classrooms. Not so much that it's better for student learning, but that it enhances student learning, especially when it comes to understanding purpose, audience, and developing multimedia presentations. Now, I don't mean to say that we should do away with having our students read scholarly articles (I assign my FRESHMEN scholarly articles to read, for crying out loud), but I do believe a good mixture of written and multimodal work can go a long way. It's important for our students to be able to talk about how they learn, just as it's important to be able to write about how they learn.   With that said, I have to add that the first time I tried to do a writing class fully online, it went horribly. My mentality at the time was that—since I was teaching one online and one off—if my offline course met every day for 1.5 hours (summer course) then that meant my online class had to get on Blackboard for at least 1.5 hours every day. Seems reasonable, but it just wasn't realistic to teach the same course the same way on- and offline. I've since then had to make modifications to how I teach online. I wouldn't go as far to say it's been dumbed down. It's still tough. But I have made my students do collaborative projects involving creating videos and websites (etc.) and showcasing them to ideal audiences. They still write researched argumentative essays and peer review their work. They still read (and discuss) scholarly articles. But it's a different class from the one I teach in person.  My advise to you would be to stick to your guns but be open to creating meaningful learning opportunities for your students. Here's how I see it: Yes, there are things you can do in a classroom that you can't do online. But there are also things you can do online that you can't do in a classroom. Writing-heavy classes (as opposed to reading-heavy and quiz/exam-heavy) are extremely challenging to pull off online, but with the right approaches, I believe we can make them work.

Professors,2gif6t,HM_D,4,Tue Nov 11 19:34:49 2014 UTC,"This sort of response makes me a little uncomfortable. So, here are some obvious things: students need to pass classes to get credentials that they need for work later in life; they also often need to work while students to pay tuition (and get things like food). As a result, they may end up taking a class that they aren't particularly interested in, at a time that conflicts with things that are a higher priority. It doesn't seem at all unreasonable to try to get away with doing both the class and the job. Mentioning the vacation may be a bit much, but on the other hand I don't know many students (or professors) who have never missed a class due to voluntary travel during the term.  Slightly-full disclosure: I was certainly worse than this when I was a student, and still don't think there was an easy way around it. Actually, when taking the class that I'm teaching this term, I managed to make it to exactly 1 of the 39 lectures. The class was a mandatory methods class (as it is where I'm teaching it now), the only section that didn't conflict with other methods classes was in the evenings, and the classes conflicted with my part-time job. Of course this wasn't great, but there wasn't really an easy way around it: delaying the course would have delayed my degree by a year, and it would have been very difficult to replace my part-time job with something similarly well-paying, especially on only the 2 weeks notice or so that I had. I  Sorry for the longer and more serious post on a light-hearted thread, but this attitude has always bothered me. The university is a gate-keeper to lots of important credentials; I think it is ok that some students just want to get the credentials. My attitude is probably colored by the fact that I'm at a `research-oriented' university and teaching mostly engineers; so, classes aren't the biggest part of my job and the students take many mandatory classes with very good textbooks. I can imagine this being more annoying if your job is focused on teaching, or if you are teaching material that is harder to get out of a combination of textbooks and dorm-room experimentation."
Professors,2gif6t,invisiblecows,2,Tue Sep 16 05:12:27 2014 UTC,"Thank you for the thoughtful response.   Although I understand that people have lives and responsibilities outside of class, what bothered me was her assumption that it would be okay to turn up 30 minutes late every day. It was a very small class (under 10 students) and I had already sent out the syllabus which stated that all tests would be at the start of class. Had she asked if it would be possible to leave early, I probably could have been more accommodating.  Additionally, I know it's a stretch to keep students' attention for three hours, so I try to cover the denser material first thing.  She was still argumentative after being told that she risked failing the course that way, and wanted to just drop the course if it didn't work out. Her telling me about her planned vacation, and then not showing up to the first class at all, left the impression that she was not a serious student, and in any event I couldn't have accommodated her even if I wanted to. Also, the class was an elective, and there were many others offered at various times.  Anyway, I would never just assume that a professor would be okay with me turning up late to every class. It wasn't even a request, but an advisory. That's just unacceptable, in my opinion."
Professors,2gif6t,72ChevyMalibu,1 point,Tue Sep 16 11:55:56 2014 UTC,"Thanks for answering - this makes a lot of sense. As you could probably tell, I have a bit of a chip on my shoulder on this issue, and it is nice to hear the other side. It is much easier to get this on the internet than in my own department - I'm relatively new to the department, and this seems like the type of thing that could easily turn into a somewhat emotional disagreement.  It was interesting to me that both you and invisiblecows below wrote that the main sin was assuming that it was ok to be tardy or absent. May I ask what subjects you teach?"
Professors,2gif6t,weasel85,1 point,Tue Sep 16 13:20:23 2014 UTC,"So, here are some obvious things: students need to pass classes to get credentials that they need for work later in life; they also often need to work while students to pay tuition (and get things like food). As a result, they may end up taking a class that they aren't particularly interested in, at a time that conflicts with things that are a higher priority. It doesn't seem at all unreasonable to try to get away with doing both the class and the job.   I get that, but it's worth pointing out that scheduling classes is now easier than it has ever been. My last institution had daytime, evening AND online options for core courses, and I still had students complain that it was hard for them to get to class because of their work schedules.  I definitely understand how hard it is to juggle school and work, but there comes a point where you just have to use the resources available to you and find a way to make it work. I worked throughout both my BA and my MA, and I always found a way to get to classes on time. Sure, I asked for an occasional break when work was crazy, but I certainly never would have just assumed that a prof would be okay with regular tardiness."
Professors,2gif6t,Greyrat,2,Tue Sep 16 20:16:13 2014 UTC,Had a student tell me on the day Spring started that she would be gone for Spring Break and then would be gone the second week after that with her family to Disney World. I was flabbergasted to say that she was taking two weeks if from school.
Professors,2g7wdq,dogandcatinlove,26,Fri Sep 12 17:48:18 2014 UTC,"As a lecturer myself, I can sympathize with you. The first few years, if a student goofed off in class or fell asleep during lecture I went on and ignored them. I didn't say anything because I didn't want to open a rift if I didn't have to.  That all changed Thursday. I had one pair of lovebirds who constantly chatted in the back of class and I would pause to look directly at them. They'd quiet down, but soon resumed chatting away making kissy-faces at each other. It irked me but I moved past it, not wanting to make it a thing. But then she began to talk over me. I could hear her while I was lecturing to the class. To make matters worse, a couple of frat bro.s were throwing little wads of paper at each other like in high school. Something in me snapped. I looked at the couple and asked loudly ""Are we interrupting? Do you need to take the conversation outside?"" The couple had the awareness to look embarrassed. As for the guys I looked at them both and, full of the fury and indignity of the moment, I said ""Gentlemen. Leave.""  I really wanted to say more. But later on, after class and in my office hours I sent an announcement to class outlining what I considered basic classroom courtesy and behavioral expectations, outlining that I had never thought I would have to do so. I braced for a call or email from the chair or dean about student complaints.  Instead, I received apologies as well as several emails from students who lauded my throwing people out of the classroom.  TL;DR - Stand up for yourself; you won't be disappointed."

Professors,2g7wdq,Thelonious_Cube,1 point,Fri Sep 12 21:10:52 2014 UTC,I have discreetly confronted a couple people and it actually turned out well. But I'm not sure how I look to the rest of the class when I don't address an issue publicly and immediately. I've never been the type to call people out. I think I sound snooty when I try it.
Professors,2g7wdq,BusterTheChihuahua,23,Sat Sep 13 03:01:13 2014 UTC,"I've taught at a university for close to twenty-five years. The good news is that it's one of those professions where women gain more authority as they age. It was WAY harder to manage the things you mention back when I was fresh out of grad school. Over the years, it's become less and less of an issue, and now that I'm an older woman, I can be as nice as pie and they're still a little afraid of me. I think it's because if I'm not smiling like a maniac, I look pissed off. To be honest, I'm NEVER pissed off--it's just that bitch wrinkle between my brows. Anyway, a few really practical tips:  1) Dress seriously. I know, I know. BUT this made a huge difference to how students behaved around me. When I first started, I would dress in jeans and big sweaters. An older woman prof told me to power dress, and I did: heals and jackets (with shoulder pads) help. Black helps even more (especially if you're giving back papers and midterms). I also started wearing reading glasses (though I didn't need them--I just had them perched down at the end of my nose or pushed up on the top of my head). I know this is all terrible (and I am a feminist), but it worked. I don't have to do any of that now because I'm old and look serious even when I'm being playful.  2) When you are lecturing walk up and down the aisles, and if a student is talking to his/her neighbour, just walk toward them as you're lecturing. If they notice keep eye contact and keep moving toward them. If they don't make eye contact and keep talking to their friend, keep lecturing as you move toward them and once you get to their desk, stop and put your hand on their desk and say, ""Sorry--could you two stop talking? I'm finding it very distracting"" in a very casual way. Then just keep lecturing and walking down the aisle. Again, I don't have to do that any longer because I look scary.   3) Be a bit of a loose cannon--I don't mean you should ever lose your cool. But if a student is doing something distracting, you can just stop and say, ""Dave, sorry--can you stop doing that (opening and closing binder rings, chatting to neighbour, etc.)--it's just really distracting."" Again, say it very casually and move on.   4) Another way to put them a bit off balance is to ask specific students to answer a question. If you are giving a lecture and stop and ask a question related to the reading and then don't wait for someone to put up a hand, but ask a specific student, EVERYONE will suddenly be on alert because they don't want to look foolish if you single them out. If I have a chatting duo, I'll do this. However, for the first couple of questions, I'll ask students I KNOW will give a brilliant answer. Then, for the third question, I'll ask one of the chronic chatters. It's kind of diabolical.  5) During student presentations, it's REALLY important that other students don't chat because it makes the student presenters very nervous, so I always give the please-be-respectful-of-your-classmates talk, and then I stand right behind/beside any student who might be likely to offend. They don't talk because they know you're behind them, but they don't know where.  6) If your university has online companion sites, request one. Have students submit their assignments online and return them online. Weirdly, this creates a bit of a disconnect between you and the crappy mark. Plus, you don't get the crowd mentality thing happening when you return a bunch of crappy papers/midterms/exams to a class and they all start agitating. Finally, if they receive a crappy mark online and have that flash of anger, it's not in class and it won't be automatically directed to you.  Sorry, this was a bit long, but your post took me back!  Edited to say one more thing: if you don't know the answer to a question, just say, ""Y'know...That's a really good question. I'm not actually sure. I'll check and get back to you."" And then do get back to them. I remember being blown away as a student the first time I heard a prof say this, and I really respected the prof. I do that myself."

I guess I'm not terrible at the whole thing. I never have students texting or on Facebook and I am stern if they aren't reigning it in at the beginning of class or after a discussion break. I suppose I've just been feeling insure because some of the behaviors are new for me. It's like I'm wearing clothes just a size too big and it doesn't fit just right.

Professors,2g7wdq,zombie_dbaseIV,12,Sat Sep 13 16:03:24 2014 UTC,"It is common for new profs to feel like an impostor (impostor syndrome). When you've learned a TON about a narrow topic, one of the side effects is that you realize (a) just how deep knowledge can go and (b) there is a lot you don't know about things that are even slightly away from your specialty.   When teaching, just remember that you know plenty enough to teach a class on something that is in your field but not squarely in your wheelhouse.  Ignore any feelings of impostor syndrome in the classroom; such feelings aren't fair representations of your true level of expertise.   Being kind, engaging, and even forgiving is not the opposite of having good classroom management. I'm a nice guy in the classroom as long as you don't try to attack me. I try to be very fair with students, but I don't put up with any crap.  You're the boss, not them."

Professors,2g7wdq,digshake,10,Sat Sep 13 03:52:45 2014 UTC,"Add to this that I am a young female professor and I'm like, three feet tall. I don't exactly exude authority.    I'm only a grad student but my PI from first year was shorter than five feet and a young Asian woman who probably weighed 100 lbs soaking wet.  She commanded her classroom and was undeniably in charge 100% of the time.  This was a 30-40 person graduate engineering class for clarification.  Usually these come with some egos.  Two things I learned from watching her which might be helpful:  -If anyone started carrying on a conversation, she'd stop talking.  She didn't say anything, she didn't have to.  Silence is very powerful when used correctly.  It's incredibly uncomfortable to realize everyone in the class is looking at you waiting for you to shut up.  As an instructor, this turns the power of the class in your favor against the chatty student.  On the very rare occasion this happened multiple times, she'd simply ask the student if they had questions about the material and to please save any other discussions for after class.   On top of that, I'm teaching some topics that I honestly don't know well at all. No one else knows that because I can fake confidence like nobody's business.   -Absorb and deflect questions that you don't know.  I did this when TAing as well as watching her do it and it separates good lectures from bad ones.  If someone asks you about the material and you don't know an exact answer, don't spend five minutes fumbling around about a response.  Answer the best you can to your knowledge and then try to move on.  If they have follow-up questions or it wasn't completely answered, tell them that you will look into it and ask that they send you a reminder email so you can give them a more thorough answer.    Good students hate, and I mean absolutely hate watching a class get derailed by questions that are convoluted or have little bearing on the material.  There will usually be ""that guy"" in every class who asks at least one of these every day.  If you learn to control them, you (again) get the power of the rest of the classroom on your side.  Additionally, you will not get a follow-up email 9 times out of 10.  This means that the question obviously is not important enough to warrant one, so why feel bad that you couldn't answer it?  That's all I got.  Edit: Just wanted to quickly clarify that my PI was a super friendly person.  She was really nice and understanding... until you started to mess with her classroom management."

Professors,2g7wdq,GhotiStyx,8,Sat Sep 13 12:28:18 2014 UTC,"Couple tips I've learned:  Eventually, with enough practice, exuding authority will make you feel good. It is a part of your job. Consider it this way: if a student is misbehaving in class then they aren't your main priority, the other students are. Those other students are also probably hoping that you'll chastise or kick out the misbehaving students and when you do so, it will greatly improve their opinion of you and your relationship with them. It is really a win/win situation.  In terms of not knowing material well, I would imagine almost every teacher has experienced this feeling, I know that I have. I'm only a few years into my career, but I view such classes as an exciting challenge, not a ticking time bomb. I get to learn more material, which I love to do, and I find that since the content is fresh in my mind I'm a better teacher.  For more on the latter topic I highly recommend the book Teaching What You Don't Know by Therese Huston."

And Zombie_dbaseIV is right on target: EVERYONE goes through the Impostor Syndrome when they're starting out.  Mine lasted for years.  The advice I give to new profs in my department (which was given to me by my department chair when I was first starting) is ""Come in like a lion and go out like a lamb"".  I probably overdo it a bit by having my ""I'm a complete asshole"" talk while going over the syllabus, naming myself the ""Nanna Killer"" during exam time, and talk about how they would have to come in with their severed head tucked in to their arm in order to make up a missed exam.  It gets some chuckles, but it sets the hardass tone.  Between you and me, I'm a complete pushover, but if you start the semester strict and a little distant, then warm up as the semester progresses, they have a much more positive attitude towards you and behave well.  If you start as a softie then tighten up because they're taking advantage of the situation, they they'll think you've betrayed some imagined freindship or ""coolness"" factor, and have negative reactions.  Just think of them as dogs: if you establish yourself as alpha on the front end, they'll become relaxed and cuddly.

Professors,2g7wdq,AuntieChiChi,4,Sun Sep 14 18:07:40 2014 UTC,"I’d have to agree with what everyone else has said. At first I wasn't so sure about how to manage a classroom, but I can tell you from experience that the more you teach, the easier and more natural classroom management becomes.   The first day when I go over the syllabus I purposely dress in my most professional attire and act very formal and strict (this was advice given to me by another professor years ago). As time goes on, I warm up more and become more approachable, laid back, and toss in relevant jokes to get them laughing. I’ve found this gives them the impression that I expect respect and for them to pay attention, but at the same time the classroom is a place for open discussion and a positive learning environment.  I do make a point the first day to mention that if I see people talking, on their cell phones, or another form of misbehavior that I will stop lecture. As mentioned by someone else in this thread, this tends to shift the focus onto them and they often feel embarrassed/uncomfortable while others are annoyed. If the students continue to engage in the behavior, I take appropriate action. For example, if students are continually talking, I’ll tell one of them to move across the room to another seat. After a few times of stopping lecture and/or taking action if needed, I’ve noticed that students realize I’m serious. I haven’t really had behavioral issues past the first few weeks of the semester.   As for questions you may not know the answer to, answer it to the best of your ability. If I’m not sure about something, I’ll tell them I’m not sure or don’t quite remember and I’ll look up information to see what I can find. Then I actually do it. Often, after some researching I can find an answer and I’ll bring it up at the start of the next class. Students really appreciate this; I’ve seen positive feedback about this on several student evaluations.  Don’t worry, you’ll be just fine."
Professors,2g7wdq,AuntieChiChi,5,Fri Sep 12 22:46:03 2014 UTC,"Something that helps me with classroom management and when I worry too much about being liked by the students is to remind myself that it is better to be respected than to be liked.

Professors,2g7wdq,_neutrino,2,Sat Sep 13 01:00:12 2014 UTC,I definitely agree. But I'm not sure how to earn respect from some if these students. It's not innate.

Professors,2g7wdq,CarolinaSwtness,3,Sat Sep 13 03:24:20 2014 UTC,"I think respect comes at least in part from being able to shut down side conversations and that sort of thing.  If you're struggling at some moment, ask yourself:  ""what is more important right now, that these students who are having this side conversation in the middle of my lecture LIKE me, or that they RESPECT me""  But you're right, respect is certainly not innate.  Many students come to class now feeling very entitled.  That they should get an A just because they are paying for the class.  And some will figure out that they can manipulate you, and some are very good at manipulation, and you'll never catch on, and those students will never respect you.  But for most students, respect is earned by sticking to your guns (something I'm not always the best at!) rather than being the ""cool"" professor."

It's hard to strike a balance between being organized and flexible without looking fickle or being too rigid. I need to change a couple policies as it stands, and that can really muck up the classroom climate. But once I have a good policy in place, I do stick to it.

Asking a student to write an evaluation might be evidence that the school takes teaching seriously.  As long as they're looking at other measures, such has peer observations, it might be quite a useful thing.  It's very unlikely that a student letter would be decisive, but it can add to the committee's understanding of the professor's teaching.  Some of the alternatives, like looking only at student evaluation scores or ignoring teaching and making a decision based on a research record, are worse.  I agree that asking a student to evaluate a professor in terms of a vision statement is pretty silly, but deans (and provosts) do love their vision statements.  My advice would simply be to describe what the professor does well, and if there are clear areas for improvement, what they might be.  Your're not really being asked to decide whether or not the professor gets tenure.  Let the committee worry about the vision crap."

As a student, it is your primary responsibility to evaluate this professor's ability to mentor you.    In the classroom: How does this professor perform in the classroom?  Did your class(es) with the professor leave you feeling enriched?  Were you confident in the professor's knowledge of the course material?  Was the professor open to questions, and did she/he facilitate discussion when appropriate?  Does the professor mention recent advances in the research germane to the course?  Is the professor respectful of students in class?  Any discussion of your professor's classroom abilities should extend far beyond ""easy"" or ""difficult.""   In their office Does the professor actively invite students to her/his office?  Does the professor engage you outside of the classroom when appropriate?  Does she/he suggest potential ""next steps"" for you and your fellow students career-wise?  Overall, do you feel like your professor cares about you and your future?   Beyond your experience on campus Do you know any previous students who worked with the professor?  If so, did the professor take an active role in writing letters of recommendation?  Did the professor help guide them towards graduate school/professional school/a specific field of work?  Does the professor seem knowledgeable or at least supportive of your futures outside of academia?     It's good that you are taking this seriously, as your testimony can alter the academic landscape of your school for several decades!  Remember that at many institutes of higher learning, tenure essentially guarantees a lifelong appointment as a professor.  You should carefully weigh all of the information you have about the professor, and carefully state things as factually as possible."

How structured is your syllabus? Do you have a routine or format for each class meeting? It's early in the semester and they are testing you.  Have the students submitted graded assignments yet?   You need strong structure and balls of steel to get things back on track. It is your playground, your rules. Watch Amy Cuddy's TedTalk on nonverbal communication. Sometimes you do have to fake it until you make it.    People underestimate how hard it can be to teach college classes, especially the first time out. Don't worry about being likable or funny. Your goal is to be respected and meet learning objectives.  Set the tone and follow through. Have a clear goal for each class and structure the class meeting around that goal.   If they aren't doing the work, give them zeros. No matter what, do NOT waiver from what your syllabus policies say. Make a note of what you want to change for future semesters."
Professors,2g2iy9,CarolinaSwtness,4,Thu Sep 11 03:53:19 2014 UTC,"Fifth-year full-time lecturer at a writing program here. 29-year-old male who finally decided to start growing a beard (not that that's an option for you). I did one year as a TA before that, my background being in Creative Writing and Literature. I'm lucky enough to have a very supportive writing program who had all TAs meet at least every other week to discuss what was going on in our classes and help when we ran into issues like yours. I know that doesn't really help, but I've been in plenty of classes much like the ones you are describing.  First off, I'd like to reiterate what /u/CarolinaSwtness said in her comment, in my own words. You have to remember that we are the weirdos actually interested in education and self-betterment. It's not rare that a student, fresh out of high school, doesn't have this quality or at the very least developed this quality. For a lot of these students, FYC (first-year comp) is a huge wake-up call, usually righting (no pun) all the misconceptions they have about what a good essay is or what writing really is. A lot of them end up feeling like everything is so different and that tends to cause what's going on in your course.  I'm not familiar with the curriculum you're covering, but what's worked very well for me is a lot of group work. Have them all read a scholarly article for class and bring it with them. From there, build discussion questions and assign one to each group. Have them refer to the article to answer said question and teach the class that specific concept. Yeah, it sounds like they're doing your work for them, but I don't think that's the case. I've found that a lot of students, especially freshmen, want to know that their opinions are valuable, too. I mean, think about it. So many of them have spent the last 12 years being told to locate answers that match their teachers', not create their own answers and support them. Also, any learning retention pyramid will show you that teaching others is the best way to retain information, so that's the way to go. Do peer review with them, have them bring dry-erase markers and answer their questions on the board. Have other groups respond to their responses to give each other feedback. And you, don't just sit in the front and have them do this work. And don't hover over them either. Pull up a chair and sit with them. Help them figure it out. You may not get to work with every group in one class session, but you can sit with a different group during the next activity, so it's okay.  I would also be happy to answer any questions you have over PM. I've been doing this a little while, and I want to say that fact that you're worrying about this is a good sign that you should be doing this. I've met a lot of teachers who have gone rogue and just done a complete disservice to FYC students, having them write poetry without really teaching any of it instead of giving them opportunities to write academically. They did not care that their classes were falling apart, lasted 20 minutes out of a scheduled hour-and-a-half, and students eventually stopped showing up. You seem to really give a shit about this, and that means you're doing what you should be doing.  Keep your head up. It'll get better."
Professors,2g2iy9,_wellthereyougo_,2,Thu Sep 11 05:48:05 2014 UTC,"Wow, u/_wellthereyougo-, this is wonderful! I am so pleased by the responses I've received thus far; I am truly grateful. I am heading for the bed though, so I will give you a proper response with some fresh eyes in the morning. I just want you to know your message was received and that I really appreciate it!"
Professors,2g2iy9,_wellthereyougo_,2,Thu Sep 11 05:55:06 2014 UTC,"u/_wellthereyougo_ I have to thank you! I tried out your idea with the readings in both of my classes and it was a success! Heartiest thanks for this! It significantly improved my week and overall confidence in the classroom.  And thank you for your kind words. I do feel like caring is a big step in the right direction, but so is execution; I am slowly getting there with the latter. And thank you, I have my head up and I am hopeful! And I will definitely take you up on a PM. You take care :)"
Professors,2g2iy9,vestycakes,1 point,Sat Sep 13 21:30:42 2014 UTC,"Very glad to hear that. Remember to let them do the work. If there are other TAs or other faculty you get along with, you should consider investing in IF-AT cards (link below). What I do with these is build quizzes for the readings with questions that require the students to really discuss and argue about the article to arrive at the best answer, which is ultimately what we want. I let them do these in groups and with the open text. This way those who did not read let the entire group down.  Poor man's version of this:  I'll try my best to explain this. Picture the standard multiple-choice quiz with four choices, four questions. You line up 16 post-it notes on the front desk:  1A 1B 1C 1D  2A 2B 2C 2D  And so on. The best answer for each question has a light check mark behind that post-it note. Students work on the quiz in groups and then send a member to check behind a post-it once his/her group agrees on one. If the check mark is there, they can move on to the next question. Otherwise, that group loses on half credit for that question and gets one more attempt at the three remaining choices.  This, of course, requires more supervision from your part.  Anywho, I like these because while I don't normally like to give quizzes as a punishment for not reading—you know, the kinds with questions like, Who dies in chapter 7?—these quizzes force them to discuss the parts of tough readings I want them to make sense of.  Keep at it. And thanks for the gold.  Here's the link:  http://www.epsteineducation.com/home/order/default.aspx"
Professors,2g2iy9,CarolinaSwtness,5,Mon Sep 15 00:55:01 2014 UTC,"Young female freshman comp teacher here.  There have to be consequences for everything. Nobody did the reading? Pop quiz. They'll start soon enough.  I find it helpful to break up the class day into smaller activities.  Do a journal entry for ten minutes,  brief notes, lecture/discussion,  anf a group activity.  It appeals to a variety of learning styles and if they're constantly being asked to do something different,  they won't have time to slack off."
Professors,2g2iy9,CarolinaSwtness,1 point,Thu Sep 11 18:55:11 2014 UTC,"u/vestycakes, I had them start off with a focused free write. It seemed like it gave them the chance to get in the right mental space for class and they were all much more chatty and more inclined to participate. Thanks for this great advice. I do try my hardest to avoid too much lecture and I try not to use the same format every day. All of these suggestions help me to keep the variety going."
Professors,2g2iy9,Eliza08,3,Sat Sep 13 21:32:24 2014 UTC,"Also, realize that your students aren't you. You're good at the academic game. Most of those in your classroom don't have the drive and experience you do (yet). They are learning all the things we had to learn as students, and some will be less motivated. I was halfway through my first semester when I realized that not every student cares, and not every student who cares will earn an A. That's not on me as the teacher. Once I realized that, it took a load off my shoulders. It also boosted my confidence because I learned that I am really good at something, so that's why I have been trusted with a class of my own!   Edit: Holy crap, Batman! My first gold. Thank you for finding value in my contribution!"
Professors,2fzur5,kingpolly1,10,Wed Sep 10 11:06:35 2014 UTC,Absolutely. Until it's grade grubbing time at least.
Professors,2fzur5,working_and_whatnot,3,Wed Sep 10 16:24:52 2014 UTC,"I usually have a couple students who are very concerned with when my posted office hours are at the beginning of the term. They're never the ones who actually show up.  The ones who do show up do so at random times, almost never during office hours."
Professors,2fzur5,cdskip,3,Wed Sep 10 13:10:32 2014 UTC,"Yes and no. I'll go the entire semester without seeing the majority of my class in office hours. I'll have several students who are regulars that I get to know pretty well.  Then I have campers: people who come to every office hours session without fail to sit in my office and work on homework. I enjoy being available to my students, and office hours are one of the most enjoyable parts of the job, but I will encourage students of this type to leave after a certain point. I want them to become independent in their studies and I believe this type of behavior does more harm than good."
Professors,2fzur5,digshake,3,Wed Sep 10 13:55:20 2014 UTC,"Yes, thank god. Not because I don't want them to come, but because I've gotten so used to them not coming, that I get a lot of work done during those times--if they started showing up, I'd have to stay at work a lot longer."
Professors,2fzur5,coldgator,2,Thu Sep 11 01:36:23 2014 UTC,"Yes, though I am almost always around and have an open-door policy (I just keep office hours religiously, i.e. I WILL be there), so there's less pressure on them to rush and find me during specified times.  Having said that, I'll occasionally have a student who wants to schedule a time with me and I'll ask ""can you make it during office hours?"" and they'll typically say yes.  If they can't, I'll do another time with them.  Edit: typo."
Professors,2fzur5,Gee10,1 point,Wed Sep 10 12:46:20 2014 UTC,"That's exactly what I do too. If my door is open and a student needs help, they're welcome to come in at any time. I try to get them in during office hours but sometimes my hours conflict with their classes.   This is my first semester teaching at a college though, so I'm not sure if the open door policy is good in the long run..."
Professors,2fzur5,weasel85,1 point,Fri Sep 12 22:43:56 2014 UTC,"Why wouldn't it be? I feel like if they want to pop in and you're busy, you just tell them you can't see them and make an appointment. Works for me, anyway!"
Professors,2fzur5,Gee10,1 point,Sat Sep 13 01:31:37 2014 UTC,Yep
Professors,2fzur5,Quant_Liz_Lemon,1 point,Wed Sep 10 14:44:53 2014 UTC,"A horribly anachronistic notion...I host virtual office hours over Skype.  Best part, pants are optional.  At their best, traditional office hours = lesson plan time."
Professors,2g01ey,Gee10,4,Wed Sep 10 12:48:33 2014 UTC,"I've done similar things, yes. It works okay if all of the students take it seriously, but some inevitably will use the shared documents to make jokes to each other. This may derail the class a bit if you're not careful. There's also an issue if the students haven't used Google Docs before--they may type over each other or accidentally delete things other students have written.   There are definitely benefits to doing this, but just keep in mind there may be problems as well."
Professors,2g01ey,RPShep,1 point,Wed Sep 10 13:45:47 2014 UTC,"Whenever I have used Google Docs collaboratively like this, it has slowed down to a crawl. Does anyone else experience this? If not it may be a bandwidth problem on my end.  I have used Google docs to create a data repository and have them, as a class, process all of the data using their own formulae, but unfortunately I had a student who was very sure of themselves, and deleted a lot of the correct work that other students had done. I think this needs a lot of policing.  I love this idea, but maybe not for a WHOLE class. Maybe between small groups?"
Professors,2g01ey,amightypirate,1 point,Wed Sep 10 14:22:48 2014 UTC,"Maybe have the class nominate a small handful of [good] students who will take it seriously. Have them be the official transcribers. Make sure they're the only people with document editing privileges. Set the rest of the class to ""view only"" mode.   Now, here's the issue. Why would already-good students volunteer to help the rest of the class, their competition, out in this manner?   I don't have a good solution to this, but perhaps give the students chosen to transcribe an automatic/guaranteed 100% in the ""participation"" section of grading (if you have that), regardless of how vocal they were in class???   However, I really think if a live/collaborative note-taking system like this is to be used, it should be student-initiated and student-run with 0 professorial oversight."
Professors,2g01ey,GVSU__Nate,1 point,Wed Sep 10 15:28:29 2014 UTC,"I tried it a few tImes a while ago, I found students fell into two camps - one set wouldn't edit it because they didn't feel confident / feel they had anything to add and the other camp didn't take it seriously, or we're easily led off track."
Professors,2g01ey,Wormella,1 point,Wed Sep 10 20:15:09 2014 UTC,"I'm currently using this approach. However, as one of their assignments, students are required to sign up for x number of classes to be the class scribe. I have at least two assigned scribes per class.   Anyone else can edit, but I find that very few do (outside the scribes)."
Professors,2g01ey,undercs,1 point,Wed Sep 10 23:01:15 2014 UTC,"This is probably way more than you want, but there are products that are made for interactive and shared note-taking.  This one does that and much more: http://www.dyknow.com/educational-software-products/interactive-learning-software/  - unfortunately, it is not free, but when I interned with them they did give a free demo."
Professors,2g01ey,marisa_exter,1 point,Thu Sep 11 02:20:20 2014 UTC,Tried it once or twice as a student. I imagine you'll get a few active people (maybe more at first cause it's new and interesting) and lots of lazy people riding coat tales relying on others loosing the active involvement that comes with taking notes.
Professors,2fyee4,coldgator,3,Tue Sep 9 23:27:43 2014 UTC,"I may be wrong, but my spidey-sense tells me that if a major part of their business is to cold-call people from conference listings, this might be a vanity press."
Professors,2fyee4,Zaungast,2,Tue Sep 9 23:47:32 2014 UTC,"When I received an email from a (foreign) vanity press, it wasn't as detailed or well-written as this one. However, I think it's potentially suspect, as I've received emails from vanity journals who troll through conference programs and email everyone."
Professors,2fyee4,localglocal,1 point,Wed Sep 10 11:04:18 2014 UTC,You're right--I found out today that other people in my department got the same email. Thanks!
Professors,2fry3a,coldgator,8,Mon Sep 8 03:15:13 2014 UTC,"In my experience, students fresh out of high school are used to having personal as well as professional relationships with their teachers. They had high school teachers who served as mentors and confidantes, so when they have something to vent about, they take it to their professors instead of to the counseling center.  Let her know that you're concerned about her, explain that you don't feel equipped to offer advice because you're not a counselor, and refer her to mental health services on your campus."
Professors,2fry3a,invisiblecows,4,Mon Sep 8 19:10:41 2014 UTC,Can you give an example?
Professors,2fry3a,nickhinojosa,2,Mon Sep 8 03:58:11 2014 UTC,"Yeah, it kind of depends on what she is telling you."
Professors,2fry3a,working_and_whatnot,4,Mon Sep 8 19:24:11 2014 UTC,She's thinking of you as a friend.  There isn't a way without being rude explaining to her that you aren't.
Professors,2fry3a,AlphaShifter,3,Mon Sep 8 16:28:29 2014 UTC,Can you recommend she speak to your campus' counseling services if she feels she needs to vent/share? Maybe explain the boundaries between a professional space and a personal space. She'll need to know that once she gets out into the workforce. I would sit her down and praise her for the work she's done but request to keep your relationship professional.
Professors,2fry3a,Trillian42,3,Mon Sep 8 17:48:45 2014 UTC,"Maybe something like ""I enjoy working with you, but the workplace isn't really an appropriate place to discuss these things."" Then encourage her to discuss them with a friend or therapist?"
Professors,2fry3a,BrachiumPontis,1 point,Mon Sep 8 14:48:44 2014 UTC,Recommend the counseling center and the amazing services it offers.
Professors,2fry3a,sirziggy,2,Mon Oct 13 04:02:25 2014 UTC,This.
Professors,2ffcwf,HumeCat,1 point,Thu Sep 4 04:25:17 2014 UTC,"I don't think you're being ignored, I just don't think anybody has a clue.  Would you be a civilian contractor?  I've taught military and police classes: the military classes are light years better: higher IQ's and less attitude.  As far as the requirements go, the millitary are sticklers for rules, so if they specify a Ph.D., they mean it.  Other than that, if MA's are good, then it's a great full-time gig with federal benefits and mostly motivated students!"
Professors,2evkak,susannahnesmith,7,Fri Aug 29 00:55:43 2014 UTC,"Have you tried giving students questions or prompts to discuss in pairs or groups of three? It's often easier for shy students to talk in small groups with just their peers, rather than addressing the teacher in front of the whole class. You can then use the small group discussions to transition into a class discussion. (E.g. ""what did you think about this, group A? How about you, group B?"")  You could also try giving them some kind of informal writing assignment, like a minute paper, at the beginning of class. Sometimes it's easier for students to voice their thoughts if they've had a chance to write them down first."
Professors,2evkak,invisiblecows,1 point,Fri Aug 29 02:07:33 2014 UTC,"Good thoughts. I've done in-class writing assignments, and that has its own pitfalls in journalism classes - because they are so accustomed to trying to turn in a perfect essay, they get pretty stressed with those assignments. But I want to do more of them, to get them accustomed to what they will have to do in the ""real"" journalism world.   I may try in-class exercises that I don't monitor/help with. Maybe working with their peers, without me ""watching"" will help them gain confidence.   Thanks for the thoughts. S"
Professors,2evkak,invisiblecows,3,Fri Aug 29 02:46:50 2014 UTC,"You might be interested in reading some of Peter Elbow's essays. Most of them are about teaching composition, but you could probably apply some of the same principles to journalism. His essay on freewriting is easily found through a Google search, and it is useful if you're dealing with aggressive self-editors. He also has many good ideas for engaging students who are shy or lacking confidence.  Good luck!"
Professors,2evkak,mwbysw,1 point,Fri Aug 29 02:53:22 2014 UTC,Thanks! Googling now.
Professors,2evkak,UsedToHaveKarma,1 point,Fri Aug 29 13:36:41 2014 UTC,Great ideas! I've used these exact ideas in my small ESL/English classes.
Professors,2evkak,RhinestoneTaco,3,Mon Sep 1 00:44:43 2014 UTC,Try asking a discussion question and asking everyone to free write a response for 2 minutes then asking people to answer. It's much more comfortable for many students to quietly/independently think about the topic then to respond out loud once they have notes in front of them. I use this a lot at the beginning of courses while students are still getting comfortable with our classroom community.
Professors,2evkak,Namemedickles,1 point,Fri Aug 29 15:08:29 2014 UTC,"Yep, I'm going to try that. Thanks."
Professors,2ersvy,sleuthwood,8,Wed Aug 27 23:15:21 2014 UTC,"Sounds like a great idea and, like you said, it gives the students a little variety. As an added bonus, some might not even realize the message of a song, so summarizing/analyzing might be an eye opener."
Professors,2ersvy,theoutlaw11,3,Wed Aug 27 23:36:46 2014 UTC,Hooray! Thank you. I think I'll go ahead with it then.
Professors,2ersvy,in_question,4,Thu Aug 28 00:09:25 2014 UTC,"I don't think it would be too hard, but I would give them an example of what you want.  Be sure you give them an example that would be a C in your grading scheme and then go through it and say what could be fixed, but that to get an A it would need to be completely different.  First years frequently need reminded that they are all the students who received A's in high school and thus... the work they did to get that A, is now a C."
Professors,2ersvy,Ltlflwr,1 point,Thu Aug 28 13:55:42 2014 UTC,"I have students deconstruct songs and movies for historical accuracy. They love it. If you worry about it being too difficult provide an example, let them work in groups, and be specific on what you want. I also give possible questions they can ask about the artifacts they are working with."
Professors,2ersvy,dunaan,1 point,Thu Aug 28 01:22:54 2014 UTC,"I recall a first year English lit class long ago when I was a bright eyed freshman that had us write a paper analyzing a music video, so I think you'd be just fine including an analysis of lyrics. We loved the music video assignment as freshmen by the way"
Professors,2ersvy,BusterTheChihuahua,1 point,Thu Aug 28 02:01:50 2014 UTC,"Yes! Whenever I have students analyze a poem, I have them paraphrase it first. I've done this with songs as well. I've had some success with Beck's ""Debra"": https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL_9zWmDcjs and M. Ward's ""I'll be yr Bird"": https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nOzVfefA7Q Mind you, they were a bit grossed out by ""Debra."""
Professors,2eqd9g,jccalhoun,5,Wed Aug 27 15:26:37 2014 UTC,"It happened to me twice. It's worse when you have to cover the expense for a campus interview and you never hear back. What a scam. I think it is unprofessional, and I also think it indicates a lack of respect."
Professors,2eqd9g,working_and_whatnot,1 point,Wed Aug 27 16:42:07 2014 UTC,We never make a candidate pay out of pocket for an on-campus interview! and my university is pretty cheap compared to many others...
Professors,2eqd9g,Thegymgyrl,4,Wed Sep 24 23:12:00 2014 UTC,"I had 7 campus visits this spring--still haven't heard from two, and started the job I accepted this week (those two schools also have begun classes). It is insultingly rude for candidates not to be notified post-interview, but these were also the two schools who were overall the poorest hosts anyway; it seems their failure to notify is just another of their institutional incompetences. Sorry, OP. It's a little like dating--you wouldn't want to hook up with someone who stands you up and you wouldn't want to work for a campus that can't manage basic decency."
Professors,2eqd9g,UsedToHaveKarma,3,Wed Aug 27 20:51:28 2014 UTC,Sorry to hear but I will say that this is just as common in private industry. Keep your head up and realize that a school is out there looking for you!!!
Professors,2eqd9g,72ChevyMalibu,2,Thu Aug 28 02:01:34 2014 UTC,"I cannot speak to how widespread it is, but it has happened to me more times than I care to remember. I head to a campus for a NTT position, interview, and when asked when my dissertation will be defended the climate gets noticeably cooler after I answer ""I'm not doing a dissertation. I have a Master's degree and needed to stop going to school to take care of my family. I have extensive practice teaching at university level through both my TAships as well as adjuncting at [insert directional state college here]...""  And am never contacted again. I am working (well, adjuncting so I'm working a LOT of hours for not a lot of pay or benefits), but basically they forget about me once they know I don't know the secret handshake to the club. I hope this isn't happening to you, though."

Professors,2eqd9g,BusterTheChihuahua,2,Wed Aug 27 16:13:37 2014 UTC,Wow--that's SO rude. I cannot believe they didn't pay your expenses for a tenure-track job.
Professors,2eqd9g,zxo,1 point,Thu Aug 28 04:48:09 2014 UTC,3/10 schools I interviewed on campus at never bothered to contact me back. It's unfortunately fairly common.
Professors,2eqd9g,BusterTheChihuahua,1 point,Thu Aug 28 03:08:53 2014 UTC,"Yeah, they don't call.  On the plus side, sometimes they take an insanely long time to call. For my first job, I interviewed at the end of May and got a call to teach two courses at the end of July."
Professors,2eqd9g,b-minus,1 point,Thu Aug 28 04:47:15 2014 UTC,Thanks for the positive comments! I'm doing some adjunct teaching now while I restart this year's job search.

I think part of it is they'd have to field about 150 people (or however many applied) asking ""Why didn't I get the job?""  It is often an HR decision, I would guess.  Don't sweat it.  You could always contact the head of the search committee directly and ask what the status was."

Professors,2ear4e,yousurename,3,Fri Aug 22 18:14:25 2014 UTC,"This isn't 100% your situation, but similar. I have my PhD and I got a job soon after in a different department as a staff member at our campus' learning center. There have only been advantages for me. As a grad student, I was treated as a colleague and I still am as a staff member, so that didn't change for the worse. In fact, I feel a bit more respected now among faculty because I am now in a professional role. Also, I work with students in a teaching/advising capacity and it helps immensely that I have a strong familiarity with the campus and its resources, having been a grad student here. I also already know the area, so there wasn't a major culture shock or transitional period. Of course, you have to decide if the new position is the right one for you. And only you know your relationships with your former professors/advisers. Good luck!"
Professors,2ear4e,Trillian42,2,Fri Aug 22 19:12:55 2014 UTC,"I adjunct at the school where I got my MA. No complaints. I befriended most of the faculty while I was earning my degree, and we easily slid into colleagues. One certain advantage is I'm already familiar with all the resources on campus, the politics of the administration, and so on. I'd say go for it."
Professors,2ear4e,neofaust,2,Fri Aug 22 22:25:36 2014 UTC,"I'm a senior lecturer in the UK in the same place I did my undergrad, I did do my MA elsewhere, but most of my colleagues are also alumni from my course - it was a relatively niche thing at the time, most of them stayed at the university to do their postgrad. So my tutor  became my boss and I finally got to see what was behind all the exciting 'Staff Only' doors (nothing, sadly).  It was wierd for about a year (I've been there 8 now) but it's great to be able to connect with students. It sounds like a great opportunity but only you know the answer to if you you'd want to work there."

Professors,2ear4e,ChargerEcon,2,Sat Aug 23 00:15:27 2014 UTC,Thanks for the comments. I should have specified this is a tenure track position. The advertised pay for the position is a bit less than what I'm making now but in a city with a slightly lower cost of living and better job options for my partner. I'm assuming financially we would probably just about break even.

Not quite the short time you mentioned, and it was a little weird at first to transition from mentor to colleague with my former professors. And to some extent, they will likely always seem more like my mentors. But they seem proud that I am there. It's been a year now, and still going well."
Professors,2dy01j,enabeller,3,Tue Aug 19 02:15:25 2014 UTC,"We do it all the time. There are lots of methods to try, depending on your field and the type of material they are reading. One I like is to break the class into say five groups (our classes are <25 so this makes sense). Assign one group responsibility for leading discussion on a given day; they meet outside of class, prep some notes, questions, etc. in advance. On discussion day you break the class into the groups and one member of the group that is ""on"" joins each group to lead the discussion; the faculty member floats around to observe or join in as needed.  Another approach is to use the same groups for full-class discussion. The group in charge meets/preps outside of class and on discussion day you simply turn the classroom over to them, making them responsible for leading discussion for a given period of time.  At our institution students are asked to do this sort of thing from the first semester onward, so there's a lot of experience with discussion in various forms. If your students aren't already good at discussion in general it may be worthwhile to dedicate some class time to talking about what makes a good contribution, how to get ""quiet"" people to participate, how to shut up a blabbermouth, and other discussion strategies. Then model it for them-- we sometimes use fishbowl discussions to do that with first year students, i.e. putting ~12 students in the middle of the room and the rest of the class around them, taking notes on the discussion (not the content, but the practice) after which there is a meta-discussion about, well, the discussion.  In any case, I think you're correct to assume that having to lead discussion will increase their investment in the reading. I always tell my students to call on anyone who doesn't voluntarily contribute. It's also important to provide feedback to the leaders, perhaps even grading them, so they can see you take it seriously and they have some opportunity to improve.  The key, I think, is making sure you model and review good discussion techniques before you ask them to lead one-- especially if this approach is uncommon in your department or school. One of the hardest things for new discussion leaders to learn is to accept silence (while people are thinking) and not to answer their own questions."

Professors,2dh7x1,donasay,4,Wed Aug 13 21:48:25 2014 UTC,As part of having someone else grade it is best if you give that person 3 anonymized papers to grade. This way the person grading has a basis for comparison between students. Also this helps ensure the grader doesn't give higher grades to your child based on the one paper they get obviously being from your kid. Also this will help you ensure the grade they give is similar to the grade you would give since you can compare the grades on the other two papers to the grades you would give.

I even wrote software to help with the administrative burden that it can be. I'm also a game designer, so I teach that along with programming.  When I play games in class, it's to demonstrate the system. Like ""Let's play High Society and talk about auction mechanics."" I think Gloom is a great storytelling game, I've played it with people that aren't good improvisers and it still holds up. One game you might want to look into is Dixit, it's like Apples to Apples but with images. You can always mod the games to get what you want out of it.  In my game design class, I've traditionally had ""game review/journal"" assignments but they definitely end up sounding like paid advertisements. The next time I teach the course, I think I'm going to go in the direction of a Well Played format. I can tell you that in my experience, students love talking about video games. Almost everyone plays them. Board games are a learned passion. You have to assign it for them to play it. Some will end up loving it.  I also have debates in class. I use a deck from The Meta Game. I've tried giving them time to develop an argument as well as just playing the game. I prefer just playing the game. When we use the game specific decks, you run across your mentioned Issue 3. All of my students play video games, but the types that they play are different. You get some that play FPS and only FPS. Others are all about Candy Crush.

I often see thermodynamics taught the same way a lot of language courses are. You start with a lot of seemingly arbitrary rules -- Energy leaving the system is negative, energy coming in is positive ... cp=cv+R ... The internal energy can be transformed to the Gibbs energy by a legendre transform in pressure and temperature.... These things don't mean much when you hear them for the first time, and it takes a really long time to physically appreciate what the statements are saying, and a student has to really be enterprising and motivating to get to that point (other lazier ones will just memorize for the test and not learn any thermodynamics!). I wish my teachers had started with physical examples for each statement, and then discussed the energy of that particular system, and then pseudo-derived the rules from those systems. That would have been much more engaging than sitting through the rules first, and applications second."

Professors,2c94sa,coldgator,5,Thu Jul 31 22:04:16 2014 UTC,Snacks. A candy dish for visitors. A sweater. A mirror that fits in your desk drawer. Magnets. Nice Kleenex. A portfolio that a notepad slips into to take to meetings.
Professors,2c94sa,CommentSense,5,Thu Jul 31 23:27:59 2014 UTC,The kleenex come in handy around finals week. Oh the joys of teaching stats!
Professors,2c94sa,SnowblindAlbino,4,Fri Aug 1 00:51:48 2014 UTC,"This is actually important-- I've had students cry many, many times for all manner of reasons (death in the family, pregnant/got someone pregnant, mental illness, breakup, etc.) that have nothing to do with academics. Plus all those sick students who insist on coming in to get assignments when they should be in bed.  Add hand sanitizer to the list!"
Professors,2c94sa,CommentSense,3,Fri Aug 1 03:35:40 2014 UTC,"True. Every semester I get at least one or two students with very serious personal problems that affect their academic performance. It's a stark reminder that behind the homework, quizzes, and grades are real people with real problems and so many other responsibilities beyond the campus walls.   I really do sympathize with them, I just wish I was better at knowing what to say to comfort them."
Professors,2c94sa,SnowblindAlbino,1 point,Fri Aug 1 06:13:24 2014 UTC,"I love all these ideas. :D Oddly enough, I collect magnets haha...I don't have anywhere to put them but my white board. I think I'll need to get a filing cabinet eventually."
Professors,2c94sa,SnowblindAlbino,2,Fri Aug 1 03:16:46 2014 UTC,Mine (I have six) are covered with magnets. My students get them for me when they travel.
Professors,2c94sa,SnowblindAlbino,4,Fri Aug 1 03:36:12 2014 UTC,"What do I have? About 3,500 books and five packed filing cabinets (I'm a historian). Mementos from trips, things my students have sent me from around the world, photos of family, a couch for naps, a lava lamp, an 8-track player (and tapes), and a collection of stuff animals representing native fauna of the American West (bison, caribou, wolf, snowy owl, Smokey the Bear, beaver, etc.). Plus a bunch of Historical Artifacts (tm) that I find interesting/amusing and my students find odd. A nice rug over the ugly carpet. Several lamps so I don't have to use the ugly overhead lights. Large framed photos of Western landscapes. A 20"" TV and DVD player (I teach with film a lot). And a 1962 Western Bell rotary dial phone; I put the touch-tone phone that came with the place into a storage closet back in the 1990s.  This sounds pretty cluttered, but it's all basically on three walls of floor-to-ceiling oak shelves, with the fourth wall being my desk and filing cabs. Works for me."
Professors,2c94sa,ZeboTheClown,4,Fri Aug 1 03:31:41 2014 UTC,Your office sounds awesome! I want to make mine more welcoming since I'm going to be advising as well. Having an office with personality would help.
Professors,2c94sa,SnowblindAlbino,4,Fri Aug 1 17:13:44 2014 UTC,"Be sure to put stuff on your door if it's allowed; mine is covered and I often find students reading it all while wait for me, or just passing by. I put stuff in my windows too.  I figure if I'm going to spend 60 hours/week there sometimes I want it to be both comfortable and reflective of my personality/interests."
Professors,2c94sa,kairoschris,2,Sat Aug 2 03:19:58 2014 UTC,What would happen if you got caught taking a nap? I realize that academic jobs have a lot more flexibility and that's not something you'd get fired over. But let's say you took a nap over lunch and you were heard snoring. How do you think that would go over?  I love naps. But I am afraid to take them.
Professors,2c94sa,Wormella,6,Fri Aug 1 06:31:08 2014 UTC,"Happen? Nothing at all, other than I'd wake up I guess. Quite a few of us take naps in our offices. Faculty are professionals and control their own work schedules, at least outside of class. It would never be an issue on our campus if someone were known to be napping-- in fact, I've seen people put up ""Do not disturb: napping"" signs a couple of times!"
Professors,2c94sa,sbcreighton,3,Sat Aug 2 03:21:24 2014 UTC,I basically brought my books. Everything else was supplied by my department.
Professors,2c94sa,SnowblindAlbino,3,Thu Jul 31 22:05:51 2014 UTC,"I don't even buy books any more, just order them into the library..."
Professors,2c94sa,cdb3492,3,Thu Jul 31 22:18:34 2014 UTC,I've gotten a world map and put push pins in all the different places I've been. Good conversation starter because students always ask about it.
Professors,2c94sa,Ltlflwr,1 point,Fri Aug 1 13:55:55 2014 UTC,Neat! I haven't traveled much but it would be fun for students to be able to show where they're from.
Professors,2c94sa,annerevenant,3,Fri Aug 1 17:14:30 2014 UTC,Why have to do anything? My campus is not so uptight as to get someone upset over a nap. Fact I take naps in my office on a regular basis probably once a week.
Professors,2c94sa,Gee10,3,Fri Aug 1 15:53:48 2014 UTC,"Mini fridge! Bought it off a departing student for 30$. Best decision ever. I bring in iced tea/coffee and store it. Also, you can bring in multiple meals and keep them fresh. My other must have is a fan. I'm in a windowless dungeon, and a small fan is able to get the musty smell out."
Professors,2brl11,skysunguy,10,Sat Jul 26 07:55:17 2014 UTC,"I've been teaching post-secondary humanities classes for twenty-five years. Over those two dozen years, I've had (at most) half a dozen students ask me questions related to my marital status, political views, or religion.   Students care very little about your personal life/views/etc.--you'll actually be surprised at how little they are interested in your life. What they want to do is tell you about themselves. It's quite a different dynamic from the 70s/80s/90s."
Professors,2brl11,BusterTheChihuahua,3,Sat Jul 26 08:25:11 2014 UTC,Good feedback. Thank you. I'm in my mid 40's so I don't quite remember if these issues came up in classes while I was in school during the 80's and early 90's. I certainly never asked these questions myself.
Professors,2brl11,neofaust,7,Sat Jul 26 08:27:10 2014 UTC,"I think u/busterthechihuahua has given you some solid advice here. I've had a similar experience, the only exception being when I teach about religion. In classes such as that, I invariably get numerous inquiries into my personal religious views. I always use these moments to deflect into a discussion about the importance of double-blind peer review research and re-direct the question to that topic  ""Do you know how double-blind peer review works?""  [whatever conversation comes out of that]  ""So, in research, the researcher's personal identity should, in almost all cases, be inconsequential on the data they are producing. So to with teaching. If you can determine a bias of some sort, in research or your teacher's presentation, then there's something wrong. If you can't, then the author's personal bias are inconsequential""  In short - it's none of the student's business unless I'm being unfair."
Professors,2brl11,invisiblecows,5,Sat Jul 26 15:08:37 2014 UTC,"I have actually had a very different experience. I have had lots of students who were weirdly curious about my personal life and asked uncomfortable questions. (""Are you married? Do you have kids? Where do you live?"" etc.) I have also had one full-on stalker student, whom I had to report to the dean and the police because he wouldn't stop following me around campus. I am a small, baby-faced woman, so that might be my problem.  Depending on the ""vibe"" you put off and the maturity level of your students, you might get some inappropriate questions, so it's good to be prepared. My solution is to keep the class focused on the material and busy with relevant discussions and activities, and to immediately redirect if a student wants to pry. I usually say something like, ""I don't think that's relevant to this particular discussion. Why don't we talk about....""  And dress professionally. That helps a lot."
Professors,2brl11,RhinestoneTaco,2,Sat Jul 26 15:22:20 2014 UTC,"What they want to do is tell you about themselves.   Which, for me at least, tends to lead to some really good discussion if you can latch onto/build on that.   Especially at the freshman level, I think a lot of students can be pleasantly surprised when they find out that a teacher actually cares what they have to say/contribute."
Professors,2brl11,SnowblindAlbino,3,Mon Jul 28 20:24:51 2014 UTC,"What happens and what is ""appropriate"" will vary a lot from school to school and person to person. I've been teaching humanities courses (primarily history) for 25+ years like /u/BusterTheChihuahua but my experiences have been significantly different. Most of my career has been spent at an SLAC where my classes are always <25 and often ~15 or so...as a result I get to know my students quite well. They come to our home for dinner, I take them traveling (to conferences, field trips, etc.), and generally end up spending a lot of time with many of them outside of class.  Like most of the others responding, I would not answer personal questions in class but would deflect them. However, I am happy to answer them outside of class and often end up in personal discussions with my students in a variety of settings ranging from formal appointments in my office to sitting around campfires late at night. If we're discussing politics, religion, family, sexuality, whatever, it's only natural for them to be curious about my beliefs and I have no problem answering them frankly. I do so, in part, because I tend to have fairly conservative and fairly religious students; I am a socialist-leaning atheist and I think it's good for them to hear from people who may hold beliefs different from there own.    Re marital status and such, since my spouse also works at the same school it's not hard for our students to figure out what's up-- especially once we invite them to dinner.  What has been amusing at times, however, is that we have different last names so some students we have in common do not realize we are a couple...until they see us together, come to visit, etc. It creates some amusing reactions sometimes.  I'd note, of course, that not all of my colleagues feel the same way about these issues. I'm just generally an open and outspoken person on campus, so it's in my nature to be frank in response to such questions. Some of my colleagues, by contrast, maintain a sharp divide between their personal and professional lives. I think that's fine, and believe it's good for our students to realize that ""faculty"" are not monolithic either in their beliefs or their willingness to discuss them.  All that said, I would agree that these discussions do not belong in the classroom and it must of course be clear to students that professional ethics mandate one's personal beliefs not be applied when grading or otherwise evaluating students."
Professors,2brl11,dogandcatinlove,3,Sun Jul 27 02:09:07 2014 UTC,"I think there's something to be said for being able to relate to your students. I'm a new assistant professor but I have some experience as an instructor and was a GTA all through my doc. My students liked that I was approachable. I didn't go into great detail about my personal life, but they knew that I was engaged, had pets, and liked to exercise. When appropriate I would tell them little anecdotes about my life. They felt comfortable opening up to me, which translated to a very interactive classroom. Students don't speak up if they're afraid of the repercussions of a wrong answer. Building rapport and trust leads to a better experience for everyone."
Professors,2brl11,blue_pez,3,Sun Jul 27 02:53:02 2014 UTC,"You will have a better experience if students can relate to you in some way. If you don't want to talk about those things, is there something else about you that you can use to turn yourself into a real human for them?"
Professors,2brl11,cdb3492,3,Sun Jul 27 03:19:46 2014 UTC,"I usually answer any questions my students have about me. It is humanizing, and can be an excellent way to build rapport. I also think it's a good exercise in a humanities course. If you're teaching a stance on an issue and a student accuses you of being biased in evaluation then you need to have a stellar response. I think that kind of thinking is what makes a good instructor great."
Professors,2brl11,GoldFisherman,1 point,Sun Jul 27 03:50:34 2014 UTC,"Pertaining to what Buster said, I give my students a student questionnaire to fill out the first day.

If they ask outside class, in private, then I'm usually upfront but tactful about it, unless it's a workplace-inappropriate question, then I let them know about that. They will quickly learn those boundaries. Also, ""I don't discuss that, because I don't want any of my students to feel uncomfortable around me."""
Professors,2brl11,Unicormfarts,1 point,Sat Jul 26 23:22:27 2014 UTC,"I actually started giving students the opportunity to ask me questions on the first day of class, as a get to know you exercise. I have an unusual accent for the place where I live, and usually they are curious about it, so that gives them a chance to ask. After we do introductions/icebreaker, I go around the class and ask students 1 or 2 questions, and give them the opportunity to ask me a question.  I haven't had anything inappropriate and it does help to set the tone of ""it's fine to ask stuff""."

Professors,2bn069,azriel38,2,Sun Aug 3 19:58:46 2014 UTC,"I've loved Trello too. Definitely a fantastic help, with checklists for clearly defined tasks. www.trello.com"
Professors,2bbjvv,zouave1,2,Mon Jul 21 19:03:35 2014 UTC,"That's a really complicated question. It depends on the kind of media- if you school has some kind of online learning management software then that's your best bet (you get a one stop shop effect). If it's multimedia, you have a host of options. Could you provide some more specific detail about what you hope to do?"
Professors,2bbjvv,cdb3492,2,Tue Jul 22 00:50:23 2014 UTC,"Sure. Basically I'm trying to find a place to easily house and share all the relevant media (e.g., videos, pictures, gifs, text quotes, and so on) I come across while surfing the web (I deal mainly in sociology and political economy). Thus, I'd prefer it to be something that could follow me from different institutions. I mainly use it as a place to keep materials for teaching, but I like having the ability to have everything accessible so that my students can peruse it on their own time according to their own interests (e.g. feminism, Marx, capitalism, historiography, etc.)."
Professors,2bbjvv,cdb3492,1 point,Tue Jul 22 13:57:58 2014 UTC,I know several people that use tmblr for that.   A few online educators at my institution seem to be fans of Diigo.   You could also set up a blog or wiki-type site to keep all of the content clustered around those areas you mention.
Professors,2bbjvv,amightypirate,2,Tue Jul 22 20:01:40 2014 UTC,Showbie is a good tool for any form of classroom dissemination if you don't already have some form of virtual learning environment established.  If you have you will probably be asked to use that for course material even if it is truly the worst option.
Professors,2bbjvv,RhinestoneTaco,2,Thu Jul 24 01:14:37 2014 UTC,"Storify isn't bad for making little complete packages for things.  Otherwise, for what it sounds like you are doing, Tumblr works just fine, honestly."
Professors,2bbjvv,azriel38,2,Mon Jul 28 20:20:52 2014 UTC,Http://sitedrop.com is a presentation tool for Dropbox that works very well. You could use that and the OS for tagging. Giving you a lot more control and keeping your files local.

Professors,2ba6nz,hello_kitteh,18,Mon Jul 21 09:42:43 2014 UTC,"I received word from the administration that one of my students died. It was very early into the semester--just a couple weeks--and there were 55 students. I did announce that I had received word that sadly one of their fellow classmates had died. I told them I did not know any additional information (which was true), but that my thoughts were with his friends and family. I said that I didn't know if any other students knew him, but that they should be aware of the campus resources to help them through this difficult time.   It was maybe one minute of talk, but it was the respectful thing to do."
Professors,2ba6nz,localglocal,11,Mon Jul 21 17:02:10 2014 UTC,"Agreed. In a small class it might make sense, because the students would know each other well. But an 80-person class is too anonymous."
Professors,2ba6nz,HawaiianBrian,9,Mon Jul 21 10:18:38 2014 UTC,"On our campus all student deaths are officially announced to the community by the provost's office, usually with info on the memorial. That's been true everywhere I've worked, campus size ranging from 2,000 to 40,000 students. Odds are that everyone knows already.  If for some reason people weren't informed I would mention this in class only if it was a small seminar (<15 or so) where people were interacting daily and knew each other well. For a class of your size it seems like it would only be disruptive, especially if there's already been an official notice made to the community."
Professors,2ba6nz,SnowblindAlbino,4,Mon Jul 21 14:44:15 2014 UTC,"Thanks everyone for your feedback.  There hasn't been anything official from the university (I'm at a very large school), but the news seems to be making its way through Facebook pretty quickly.  Since the class is pretty big, I was leaning toward not saying anything, and I'll stick with that.  I'll make sure to have the counseling center info on hand in case any students approach me about it, but I won't make an announcement."
Professors,2ba6nz,cdb3492,2,Mon Jul 21 15:55:30 2014 UTC,"I don't think it would help much for a class that size. We had a grad student die in an accident, and that was announced in classes as it was a bit more traumatic for the faculty and other students."
Professors,2ba6nz,coldgator,1 point,Mon Jul 21 16:26:25 2014 UTC,"I would only bring it up if a student brings it up within earshot of other students (which is what happened in my class, in the classroom).

Professors,2ba6nz,JamesRussels,1 point,Mon Jul 21 16:20:18 2014 UTC,"No, I wouldn't take it upon yourself to announce it unless someone brings it up. I had a similar situation where one of my colleagues committed suicide and a few of his students were in my class. They kept asking where he was and I wasn't sure of what to say.

Professors,2aypvc,digshake,3,Thu Jul 17 16:08:09 2014 UTC,"We co-teach all the time here at the UofT.  Here are some tips.   Set up a repository for sharing assignments: git, svn, whatever both of you can agree on. Agree on a website layout and make sure you both can edit the website.  Is one of you in charge of making changes? Will one of you do autotesting? Will one of you manage the TAs, or will you share?  You might take turns organizing the grading sessions, but if you alternate, you should agree on some grading standards. Lay out the term.  When do you do Boolean expressions?  Loops before functions?  When do you do file IO?  Are you doing recursion? Agree on a programming style.  It doesn't matter which one; if your co-instructor has strong feelings, go with it.  Just pick one and stick with it, for the sake of the students.  If there's a language standard, like Python's PEP8, I recommend just using it. Agree on documentation standards.  What goes into a function comment?  How do you specify preconditions?  Do you document exceptions?  What will the students be graded on? Come up with lecture examples to share with each other.  This can be a big time saver and make the course more consistent. Prepare your assignments before the term starts. If you don't have time to do that, prepare sketches of ideas, and agree on the timing during the term. If you can, prepare tests in advance.  If you don't have time, at least agree on the content of the tests -- what topics need to be covered?  What topics would you like to cover? Schedule a weekly meeting, starting at least several weeks before the start of the term, to work all this out.  Keep the meetings going through the term just to keep synchronized.   Good luck!"
Professors,2aypvc,ProfGries,1 point,Thu Jul 17 20:23:05 2014 UTC,"This is great, but I'm really looking for advice on the co-teaching aspect. The course schedule and material is already done, it is all ready to go.   Some of the questions that you ask here are exactly what I am seeking help for. Should we divide things up on the task level or should each of us do half of each task? I don't know the answer to this but I feel like it will have a big impact on how the semester plays out. How do we agree on standards? Saying I should back off if he feels strongly isn't good enough...what if I feel strongly too?  I'm looking for past experiences here. I've already come up with plenty of the questions you posed, I am looking for answers."
Professors,2aypvc,ProfGries,1 point,Fri Jul 18 12:44:10 2014 UTC,"Ah, I see.  For style, with any luck, you'll have only minor differences.  If there's a standard that's close to what one or both of you wants, I'd go with it -- point the students to it and they'll buy into it more as important issue.  (Unless one of you can find a published study showing a particular style is empirically better -- more readable, easier to write -- I don't think it's worth an argument.)  For tasks, as long as you get along with the other person, just try to make sure that you're working roughly the same amount.  Divvy up the assignments.  Whoever creates an assignment should do the whole thing: draft handout, solution, starter code, any unit testing, and marking scheme.  The other person proofreads and gives suggestions.  The author also answers discussion board questions, runs any TA meetings about the assignment, and manages the grade recording and posting and the regrade request.  It's reasonable but not necessary to tell the students who is in charge of an assignment.  (It's important for both of you to read everything, though, because you'll both be expected to be experts.)  Share any midterms and final exams: agree on a list of midterm topics and final exam topics and divide them up.  Then agree on deadlines for when you'll have stuff ready -- for example, create two questions each a week and you'll be done in a month.  (Don't be shy about looking at old exams for inspiration.)  It's important to have a frank discussion if one of you is making the other one do all the work or not meeting the deadlines."
Professors,2aypvc,UsedToHaveKarma,2,Sat Jul 19 02:37:15 2014 UTC,"I co-teach a course but the distribution of work is not and is not meant to be equal, so my experience may not be too helpful to you. I am the lead faculty on it. I developed and teach the course as a whole. My colleague developed and teaches three weeks of the 16 week term, including lecture, in-class activity, readings, and individual conferences with each student. I wrote and mark the assignment that assesses learning from my colleague's unit (the results of which I share, but my colleague is an observer only for that part). We've been doing it for several years now, tweak it every term or two, but are quite satisfied with the arrangement. Happy to answer any further concerns if you think my response would be helpful!"
Professors,2aypvc,SnowblindAlbino,2,Thu Jul 17 17:12:00 2014 UTC,"What exactly defines ""co-teaching"" at your school? Does this mean two separate sections of the same course, with shared readings/assignments? Or that you'll alternate days/weeks with the same group of students in a single large class? Or that you'll both be there every day, speaking together? In turn? Who develops the syllabus, picks readings, designs assignments, grades, etc?  There are endless variations on this theme. At my school our classes are never larger than 30 so the only time we'd work together is when we are team teaching, usually a course that is interdisciplinary-- like bioinformatics, for which we might have a math/CS person and a biologist in the room together, or an area studies course (say a course on China) for which we might have a historian and an economist team teach.  In our case, the two faculty team teaching develop the course together and are generally both there all the time. In some cases they take turns speaking, in others both are ""on stage"" all the time. It's great fun but a hell of a lot of work coordinating with another person."
Professors,2aypvc,SnowblindAlbino,1 point,Thu Jul 17 20:25:46 2014 UTC,"Part of the problem is that it isn't really defined. The two of us have been assigned to the class as a whole, how we split it up is up to us.   I really feel like the division of labor could make or break the course. Should one person do all of the lectures and the other do all of the office hours / grading? Or should we split those tasks down the middle? What happens when one of us makes a judgement call that a student doesn't like so they go ask the other person instead? Can we prevent stuff like that from happening?"
Professors,2aypvc,susannahnesmith,1 point,Fri Jul 18 12:38:33 2014 UTC,"Like any relationship it's all about communication. Your instincts are right to deal with this now-- you should simply sit down with your colleague and have this conversation. Make a list of tasks and questions, and work through it together.  In my experience the best way to do this is to have both instructors there for every class session, and to divide time ""in charge"" roughly equally. If you do not, the students will perceive one of you to be in charge and one's perspectives/material to be more important. It's not unreasonable to divide the grading load in half though, and assign 50% of the class to each instructor-- that way you can maintain continuity over the semester and get to know each student's abilities in a bit more depth. It is critical, though, that you apply exactly the same standards to the grading...if students decide one instructor is ""easier"" or ""more fair"" than the other that can really screw up the dynamics and cause resentment.  Did you ever TA a course with multiple TAs? I did, and we always had meetings before and during grading periods so we could align our expectations and results. Do that at a minimum. But you'll first need to determine how class time will be divided and of course how you will actually teach the class. Lecture? Group discussion? Simulations? Likely some mix, but again, be sure one instructor doesn't get to lead all the ""fun"" stuff while the other turns into the boring lecturer.  Balance is key, both to be fair to each of you but also to manage student expectations/responses to having two different faculty in the classroom."

Professors,2auszv,Etcetera-Etc-Etc,3,Wed Jul 16 13:15:17 2014 UTC,"We've done this several times, usually internationally. In those cases we have a formal agreement (contract) signed that provides the visiting faculty member with an office, library/network access, and sometimes housing in exchange for teaching a single class or giving a series of lectures. These arrangements are often paid for by the visiting scholars's home university or government, sometimes by our university or foundation grants.  While I haven't done this for a friend on sabbatical, we certainly could do so based on precedent...if there was no expectation of them doing any work (or receiving compensation) it would be relatively easy. I'd just have to offer departmental sponsorship and convince the administration that it was worth giving up office space for a semester. That could probably be done based on the expectation of a public talk or two."
Professors,2asvz5,zazzlekdazzle,7,Tue Jul 15 21:55:44 2014 UTC,"As someone who interviewed at 4 SLACs this past year and will begin at a SLAC this fall, I am surprised at the impression you are receiving from your colleagues.   First, some brief background. When I interviewed, I had lots of TA and mentoring experience, but very little lecturing experience. At each school, I gave a research talk, but did not give a demonstration of my teaching ability. We talked a lot about research, maybe even more so than teaching during the interviews. I received multiple offers, and I believe that my research success was one of the primary reasons.   HOWEVER...  Teaching evaluations are weighed heavily for tenure. If you are a mediocre teacher, you do not get tenure. That was clear everywhere. I cannot simply walk up to the front of the room everyday with PowerPoint slides, give a talk, and go home. Each school I saw was experimenting with different classroom arrangements, flipped classrooms, etc. You have to know what you are doing and give a shit or you're not going to stick around. Availability to students was critical. Mentoring students was critical. So I think that once you look at how courses are taught and how tenure is weighed, you'll see a much heavier emphasis on teaching than the impression you received. Maybe it's business as usual for professors who have been there a awhile, but in comparison with my R1 graduate school.. it was night and day.   And now for the 64000 question... because it's the question I found myself trying to answer:   I love teaching, I love mentoring, and I love undergrads. I want those things count for something. I don't want to be visited by a department chair and told that I need to minimize my effort in teaching. But I also don't want my research persona to disappear. I want enough resources and support to stay relevant in my field.   SLACs were perfect for me. Teaching matters, but my course load is reduced (slightly) to prevent it from consuming my life. I'm provided internal funds to attend conferences during the year, pre-tenure sabbatical, and additional funds to hire students during the summer. There is a culture of undergrads working on research with professors, and a culture of professors staying active in their field of research. Those resources do not exist at many liberal arts schools.   For me, it was about balance. Do I get $64,000?"

I'm provided internal funds to attend conferences during the year, pre-tenure sabbatical, and additional funds to hire students during the summer.    I don't have $64K for you, but I think you may be a fairly rare candidate given the number of offers/interviews you had and the release time you received. Top 25 schools (which often have 2/2 loads or frequent chances at research release or pre-tenure sabbatical) tend to fit with your experience, but not the majority of the other 450+ SLACs in the US.  At mine, for example, we are on a 3/3 load, there are no pre-tenure sabbaticals, and nobody gets research releases-- but we're still expected to publish for tenure and promotion (one book or four articles is usually enough for tenure though).  That said, our interviews are different as well: they last three days and about about 50% teaching, including not only a full class but meetings specifically on teaching and at least one meal with students in which teaching is the main topic. For perspective, we're not top-25 but are paid in the 70-75th percentile AAUP and have a national recruiting market.  Those things aside, I absolutely agree with your statements on the importance of teaching for tenure and promotion. For our T&P process, excellence in teaching is required first and foremost, while one can earn tenure or promotion simply be ""meeting the standard"" in scholarship, which is something well below ""excellence"" as our committee understands the teaching load places significant restrictions on research time. Unlike the schools at which you interviewed, however, we are very direct about this in the interview process."

My program is fairly teaching centric in that grad students are often allowed to design and teach their own upper division courses. Many students in the program have ample opportunity to prepare a formidable teaching dossier, and these candidates still have a tough time at SLACs. From what I've observed, these schools do place more emphasis on teaching.   That being said, outlier programs are not at all uncommon. Department philosophies/needs differ and often change. It may be good to explore more schools. Perhaps you could go through some of SLAC  job advertisements in your field and get a sense from those?"

Many students in the program have ample opportunity to prepare a formidable teaching dossier, and these candidates still have a tough time at SLACs.   As a veteran of SLAC search committees stretching back to the late 1980s, I can tell you that this is a change that was long in coming. Even 15 years ago it was relatively uncommon for new Ph.D.s to have taught more than one or two courses independently; most had only been TAs. Since the late 1990s that has changed though; today 100% of the candidates that make it onto our short lists (the 20 we'd pull from a pool of 250-300 applicants) have experience as instructor-of-record and most of those we actually bring to campus have extensive teaching experience. (I chaired a search two years ago in which the finalists all had at least a year of full-time teaching experience at an SLAC, for example.) Some of this is the market-- people are spending more time as visiting assistants or in teaching post-docs --but it's also due to graduate programs realizing that there are jobs at SLACs and that we're not going to hire people without relevant, independent teaching experience."

They're more oriented towards practice-oriented faculty — people with lots of business experience who then use the DBA to get a handle on the theory. It's not like you'll be laughed out of the room if you were applying for a TT job with a DBA instead of a PhD, but you'd really need to establish your research skills with some really good publications. Not that you wouldn't have to do that with a PhD either."

Also depends what kind of university you want to end up at. Too many variables to answer succinctly. 3) Varies widely. Data should be available somewhere.

Professors,2a2bc1,Djatha,1 point,Tue Jul 8 14:28:58 2014 UTC,"1) Depends on the subject and school, but if you're studying full-time, a two-year research master should be doable in two years. PhDs can go fast, for example if it is an extension on your research master, but it is not uncommon to need a year extra than planned.  2) Depends, as usual. Most often you'd do one or two post doc positions and become a adjunct professor before becoming a full professor  3) Look it up  4) Doubtful. Most ""universities"" in the USA are not good. The top schools, however, are the best. Unless you can do a PhD at a top school, I'd advice against going to the USA.   In some countries, for example the Netherlands, PhD students are employees of the universities and get a reasonable salary. That makes it a very good place to do a PhD.  5) I've done research in three (totally) different fields. I liked them all, and never ran out of ideas. Of course, once you've set upon a scientific career, you'll find that interesting ideas that get you funding are harder to come by.  By the way, doing research is fun, but the higher up the chain the more bureaucracy, administration, and organizational shit you have to put on with.

Professors,29rnbx,ampanmdagaba,14,Thu Jul 3 19:56:17 2014 UTC,"I'd tell them basically what you wrote here: that graduate school isn't for the faint-hearted or casual student, it will require a 100% investment of their time, energy, and talents for five years, and that based on what you've seen of them as undergraduates you don't think they are well suited to that particular challenge.  Invite them to discuss it with you, lay out their own arguments for graduate school, offer your counters, and see how they respond. If they are insistent still and you are firmly against them applying, tell them you can't provide a letter of recommendation. If you are not totally opposed but feel lukewarm about their prospects, offer to write them a draft letter to review before they decide to submit or not; that way you can give them a ""this student is nice but not really focused or committed"" letter that may make the point for you.  In my department we've universally agreed to discourage all of our majors from applying to graduate school while still in college. They are much better off doing something else first, be that working, volunteering, an internship, travel abroad, whatever-- we've found that students who apply 1-3 years after the BA/BS are much more successful because they are more mature, more focused, and more realistic about both their personal abilities and their own ambitions. We've also found that encouraging them to step back for a year or two dramatically reduces the number of students who are applying to graduate school simply because their friends are...a lot of marginal ones never come back to ask for letters because they found others paths.  Ultimately, I think it is a professional duty to provide both a realistic portrayal of graduate school and a frank assessment of our students' abilities. Don't sugar coat either of them-- it's not doing them any favors in the end."
Professors,29rnbx,SnowblindAlbino,4,Thu Jul 3 20:29:27 2014 UTC,"Your department sounds like they have students' best interests at heart. I went straight from undergrad to a PhD program in Mathematics and ended up dropping out. After a 5 year break I went back and was far more successful.

Professors,29rnbx,AerosolHubris,3,Thu Jul 3 22:12:17 2014 UTC,"It definitely did affect my momentum.

Professors,29rnbx,SnowblindAlbino,4,Thu Jul 3 22:44:06 2014 UTC,"And one more follow-up question: would your approach change in any way if they are a minority? I am blessed to be surrounded by people who virtually all happen to belong to at least one minority group, which certainly makes casual conversations at lunch interesting and provocative, but which at times makes it even harder to provide constructive feedback. I don't want them to remember me as the guy who tried to crush their dreams.  Sorry, it is probably a somewhat silly question to ask, as a properly shaped conversation would work for every student, regardless of their background. But I am acutely aware of how painful communication mistakes may be for minority students. The stakes for them are higher."
Professors,29rnbx,SnowblindAlbino,6,Thu Jul 3 22:23:24 2014 UTC,"First, I think this is an important consideration because statistics simply show that fewer minorities have traditionally been in the academic hierarchy and therefore it is LESS likely that your minority students have had exposure to what it takes to do a PhD/be a PI than your non-minority students. So educating students on the whole process and requirements is good and esp. important for them.  Also, the earlier you have these conversations with them, the earlier they have a chance to 'turn it around' and buckle down to show they can focus and do the work. So I'd start inviting students who are interested in graduate school to come talk to you at, I don't know, the middle or end of sophomore year. (This applies to all of them.)  Finally, keep in mind that not everyone WANTS to be a big PI at an R1. Some of the students that can 'maybe get a postdoc' might end up enjoying working outside of academia with their PhDs or finding a liberal arts school that's more teaching focused. (Like SnowblindAlbino and myself.) :) Don't discourage them too soon if you do think they've got the tools to do the PhD work. But definitely do if there's pretty clear there's no chance of them doing well enough on the GREs or doing good research."

Shielding a minority student of any kind (ethnic, racial, religious, disability, etc.) from the truth about their performance won't help anything...at best it would simply put off the problem until they are in a job and their employer becomes the critic. I think it's important to approach each situation appropriately but soft-selling someone on their obvious limitations just isn't going to help them advance toward their goals. If the main concern is helping them progress you'd probably be better off being frank but couching it in terms of alternatives or ways to improve-- like ""Well, I don't think you're really going to be competitive with a Ph.D. application now but let's talk about how you might change that over the next few years...."""

It's an easy thing to say in the heat of the moment, but during a carefully designed conversation, it's hard to utter. So probably I should indeed, as you suggest, stage this as a role-playing game. To tell them that I'll now play a ""cynical guy"", and invite them to argue against me. It could totally work!  I am a bit surprised by your mentioning of a recommendation letter that says ""this student is nice but not really focused or committed"". But you wouldn't actually write a letter like that, or would you? I always assumed that letters of recommendation are not supposed to be constructive; that all bad things are hinted at by omission, and only good things are actually included. Isn't it the case? Or are you suggesting this ""draft letter"" only as a ""formative feedback"" tool?  On discouraging majors from applying while in college: but would not it damage the momentum of those who actually can fare well in academia?  Volunteering is still more expensive than being a graduate student, and finding a paid position in anything research-related may be hard, at least in the life sciences.

Or are you suggesting this ""draft letter"" only as a ""formative feedback"" tool?   Right; I wouldn't send such a letter but I might draft one for the student. The worst letters I've ever sent (when a student insisted) were simply very short, omitting almost everything.   On discouraging majors from applying while in college: but would not it damage the momentum of those who actually can fare well in academia?   I don't think so. Most 22 year olds, in my opinion, are not really mature enough for graduate school. Obviously many of them can succeed, but in my experience those who are a year or two older and have some post-college experience under their belts often do much better. Perhaps more importantly, the majority of students I work with end up going to grad school in different fields than their undergraduate majors when they wait a while-- they go into the world, learn more about themselves, more about their options, and end up pursuing degrees (and careers) in things they may not even have known about while in college. Rather than inhibiting momentum, I think of it as a time for growth and insurance against hasty decisions or burnout.  Students needn't land a job in their field or a coveted internship. I've had many students teach abroad, join Peace Corps, or even take an entry-level job in some unrelated field for a year. It gives them time to think, explore, and to refine their grad school search vs. rushing it through during the senior year when they should be focusing on their education."

It is somewhat hard for me to admit, as I went to grad school very early, and people always tend to defend their choices, and correct their memories in the hindsight... But probably you are right. Grad school should essentially be treated as a job, not as a school. Only those people have a chance to succeed in academia who treat grad-school as their first postdoc, and their postdoc as their first faculty assignment... Which makes mental maturity so important.

(We're residential, have no part-time students, no non-traditional students, etc. so that's actually true for us.)  Graduate school is, in my mind, like a promotion to a much higher level job. Now the students are no longer simply consuming knowledge, but they are asked to produce it as well (through research). Developmentally 22 year olds are just not typically in as good a position to do that well, with focus and determination, as are 25-year-olds with some life experience under their belts.  Of course these are generalizations, but the pattern certainly held true for my grad classmates as well as for the many alumni I've sent off to grad school since the late 1990s."

But the class was designed that way, because students go from me to another, harder class, with a professor who is very open about wanting to make sure the average grade is a C.   I'd talk to my supervisor and see if the numbers seem normal for that class, or if perhaps some EC needs added in to buffer.   Other than that, echoing with someone else said, if an item analysis is obtainable (Here we just get them from the Scantron dungeon), look at that and see if there were any questions with a large majority getting it wrong, then 1. See again if the wording used by the textbook was all wonky, as textbook materials are want to be at times, or 2. If the kids flat-out dropped the ball.   If it's the latter, it gives you an opportunity to go over some of those questions in class so students get on the right track of thinking like you."

I teach a similar pre-nursing class that should be a cakewalk and my class average has always been between 50-60%. This wrecks a lot of nursing students' dreams (they need a C), but it is what it is. Most of the students aren't prepared for high school, let alone college material."

This should be a wake-up call that they actually have to, ya know, study and learn material. You're doing us all a service by getting rid of incompetent and/or lazy students who were going to be in charge of people's lives.  Now, for the students who are distressed about failing: tell them you're happy to meet with them (during your office hours) to personally look at their note taking and study strategies to give them pointers on how to be more successful in learning the material. Then the onus is clearly on them to show up and you can help the ones who are serious about it."

The best part about this approach is that you really do help the ones who care and the ones who don't have no leg to stand on when they fail the class. Also, the whiners may realize/show how they have NO notes... and this is a good wake-up call for them without you being the bad guy who has to tell them directly how ridiculous it is that they took no notes but expected to pass the test."

I agre with /u/Spetzo that you should check with your colleagues to see if this is on par.

I have students attempting to take three four-week courses, work full-time, and maintain family/social lives too, all at the same time. It's not possible. I explain, every term, the time expectations for coursework--approx. 35 hrs/week for each four week course in this case, but, if my stats hold, 70% of my summer students will withdraw or fail this summer too.

It had the same amount of in-class time as a normal-term course, because it met five days a week.  Of course you worry that it's not long enough for the material to really sink in, but the flip side of that is that I know the students were at least spending some time on the material every day.  During the normal schedule, there is a 5-day gap between Wednesday-Monday or Thursday-Tuesday, and the students who don't study can forget an awful lot...  Granted: six weeks is 50% longer than four!"

I scared off about half the initial class most of whom shouldn't have been there (our dept. refuses to implement prereqs no matter how difficult the courses is).

It's a 75-seat class in the summer, capped at 280 in the fall and spring, and I had a whopping 21 students register.   That has now dropped to 18 due to the difficulty of the course.  The small setting for what is normally a pretty big lecture class has allowed me to do a lot more interactive work with them, a lot more discussion and small groups compared to what I can normally do. It's a writing-based class, so that added dialogue in the lecture helps before they go off and get graded for their work in lab.    All in all, I cannot complain."
Professors,28bdvw,RhinestoneTaco,1 point,Wed Jun 18 03:09:55 2014 UTC,"My summer class isn't going as well as I'd hoped, though this could be my fault for setting too high of a bar...  I'm teaching a 400 level economics course and the subject is fairly advanced.  I didn't think the students would like having 2.5 hours of lecture 3x per week, so I tried splitting the class up into two ""classes,"" with half of each class being me lecturing and the other half being them discussing the readings.  A typical day looks like this:  7-7:30 - I lecture to them on the first set of readings 7:30-8:15 - They discuss the first set of readings 8:15-8:30 - break 8:30-9 - I lecture to them on the second set of readings 9-9:40 - They discuss the second set of readings.  Two different students are assigned to be discussion leaders, one for each part.  Grades are based on weekly homeworks, their performance as discussion leader, and class participation.  What I've found is that at least half the class doesn't do the readings at all (which are in the neighborhood of 40 pages/week).  This, obviously, impacts the quality of the discussion immensely.  Some students will openly admit that they didn't do the readings during the discussion and then point out a problem that was explicitly identified and discussed at length in the text, and which I briefly covered during my ""lecture.""  Other students show up and say nothing at all during class, so their participation grade is going to be low.  In short, I just don't know what to do.  I know that a lot of students are going to get low grades simply because they don't talk and they're going to complain about this.  Any advice when it comes to doing the final grades?"
Professors,28bdvw,ChargerEcon,1 point,Thu Jun 19 15:37:52 2014 UTC,"Is participation a make or break part of the grade? Would failing it drop someone drop a whole letter grade? If half of the class is not doing the reading, the discussion is likely of limited value. Many students who do complete the readings may feel a bit out of place with peers who have not completed the readings and thus be reluctant to speak for fear of putting their peers in an uncomfortable position or seeming like a know it all. I was that person once, especially in history courses. I had things worth contributing, but most of the class did not do the reading and I didn't want half of them just staring at me and going ""huh?"" It gives one a sinking feeling of ""did I just say something really stupid?"" Classmates also don't like that person because it make their laziness look bad and said person will definitely hear about it from them.  Especially in class, people do not want to be the odd person out. Assigning a person to lead the discussion also somewhat limits the scope of discussion to what they know and if the assigned person has not done the reading the discussion is unlikely to be successful. Discussions succeed when everyone is eager and interested. At least half the class is not and unfortunately that compromises it for the other half of the class.   40 pages a week is nothing. Had more in high school classes. I am very much of the view that those who do not do the assigned reading (especially that little) are not in it for the learning and don't care about the subject. It should accordingly be reflected in their mark.   How about a happy compromise which will somewhat satisfy everyone except those who did not do the readings? Have a midterm/final exam which is somewhat based on the general details and theories covered in the readings. Weight the discussions lightly. Students who both read and actively participated will do the best. Students who only read but did not participate will have slightly lower marks, but still high enough to keep them happy. Students who did not read will suffer the most, as they should. Then when the students with low marks come to class, you can just say ""you didn't read the material you were supposed to. What did you expect?"" instead of dealing with the various reasons that students will develop for not participating, especially ones developed about a group where not everyone read."
Professors,28bdvw,ChargerEcon,2,Fri Jun 20 04:59:43 2014 UTC,"Sorry for the delay in responding   It's a senior level elective class, basically designed for students that want to go to graduate school.  The topic of the class is basically, ""what IS economics, how do we DO economics, and what can we say and NOT SAY with economics?  So... it's by no means a light class.  My impression going in was that only students who were intrinsically interested would take the class BUT that I could weed out the ones that weren't on the first day by discussing my expectations.  And I did get a lot of people who weren't interested in doing any work drop after the first day.  But a lot of people stayed in that, frankly, shouldn't have.  Anyway, ended up with a decent grade distribution and everyone got grades that I thought they deserved, so... it seemed to have worked in the end.

Professors,27hfy2,Trillian42,2,Fri Jun 20 04:26:35 2014 UTC,"As an undergrad, I was a research assistant for 3 professors over the years, so this is a perfectly reasonable thing to do. Find a professor whose research interests you and send them an email to set up an appointment to talk about research opportunities. In the email, be brief in introducing yourself and why you're interested in working with them. During the appointment, come prepared to talk about any previous experience you have in doing research and how much you're willing to commit to the professor's project (e.g., 10 hours a week? 20?). Doing research is a great point to include on grad school applications. These professors can also be possible references for you too. Don't be hurt if you get rejections and always have some  backup professors in mind just in case. A rejection probably doesn't mean anything personal; it may just mean they don't have a project going on, don't have the money to pay you, and/or they already have enough undergrads working for them. Always be polite and concise in your communication. I should add that sometimes you can get units for doing research, depending on your university policy. I got paid when I was an assistant, so sometimes that's a possibility too. Compensation would be something to bring up during that initial face-to-face meeting. or you could just flat-out volunteer for the experience."

Professors,27hfy2,galileosmiddlefinger,2,Sun Jun 8 08:28:44 2014 UTC,"Just as a preliminary comment, make sure that you understand the dire state of doctoral studies in the humanities before you commit to this track, especially if you aspire to a career as a professor.  You are looking at a roughly 6-8 year commitment (if you work hard!) to finish at a time when well under half of literature PhDs are finding tenure-track jobs. Think carefully about whether or not you truly want a career in this area - would you be just as happy doing something else and reading and writing in your spare time? Read this article and follow the links embedded in it to get a good sense of where things stand right now and how to prepare yourself for the likely outcome of a life outside of academia.  I would encourage you to first reach out to some faculty with 20th century scholarship interests who are better potential mentors. Someone this mean and unpredictable might leave you without a solid recommendation or otherwise fail to acknowledge your contributions, even if he does take you on. As an undergraduate, you don't need a research project that offers perfect topic fit with your scholarship interests; you just need the opportunity to learn generalizable research skills that make you a more credible applicant.  That said, if you don't have other options, one upside to a cranky research mentor is that most people aren't willing to work with them. You might get some traction with a carefully-worded inquiry about supporting him with his scholarship. (You should NOT expect to get paid to help with Literature research, so just take that notion off the table right now.) Be very specific about the legwork you have done and what ideas/projects you find interesting; make it clear that you tailored this request to him and that your interests strongly align. Send him an email and then follow up a few days later in person, either in class or at his office hours. You might get rudely shot down - hitting students is not OK and this guy sounds like a piece of work - but it's not like he can treat you any worse, right?"

It suggests that you aren't fully committed to the scholarship and development that you're asking me to provide for you. Just like in a job interview, it's tacky to bring up compensation before we've come to an agreement about your work in the lab. Leave it to the faculty member to initiate that part of the conversation.   That said, most social sciences faculty will not have the grant money to pay UG researchers. If they have money, it's usually dog-eared for existing grad assistants. Getting picked up and paid as a UG assistant is pretty uncommon."

The biggest issue I can foresee is if it's a prereq for other classes, which might set you a little off-track, though I'm sure it still wouldn't be that difficult to get back on since you still have 2 years to go.

I struggled during my first years but I worked hard and got my head on right.  If you look at my [insert major] classes, I made all A's except only one B.  This is where I found my passion, blah, blah, blah.  You can sell anything in an interview.   The other way to keep it off their radar is to have something else to talk about.  Do a co-op or an internship or get a part-time job in your field.  Work with a faculty member doing research.  Do something.  Do not just go through college and only take classes.  You need to have a product when you apply for jobs.  Give a talk at an academic conference, write a phone app, put together a teaching portfolio, publish a collection of short stories, whatever your field is, just have something where you can show a future employer that you have skills and the motivation to complete a difficult task.   As for how you recover...you just recover.  Figure out what went wrong and don't do it again.  Why were you under-prepared?  Were to taking too many classes?  Did you take too many time-demanding courses at the same time?  Were you working extra hours at a part-time job?  Were you too involved in a relationship?  Did you spend too much time playing around?  Etc., etc.  Figure it out and let this be a lesson for how not to play the game of college.  Use the resources the college gives you.  Who gives a damn if you go to tutoring?  You are paying a crap load of money for that service so you might as well use it.  Better someone make a snarky comment about you going than you get kicked out of college.  This is not the time to be prideful.  This is the time to figure out your problem and fix it."
Professors,27fsyn,manova,4,Fri Jun 6 05:45:52 2014 UTC,"You do know that your transcript means next to nothing in the job market, right? In terms of landing a job, a degree is very useful but what is more useful is your ability to demonstrate why they should hire you over everyone else with good, equal, or better GPA. If you have other activities; leadership through campus organizations, study abroad [actually means a lot to international companies], language skills, and (best of all) a desire to be part of the organization, you'll get a LOT more job offers than if you just walked in with your diploma and a really good GPA. Not saying that a good GPA isn't considered, but it is at the end of the day a relatively minor factor."

Professors,27fsyn,dunaan,2,Fri Jun 6 15:58:05 2014 UTC,"I have to agree with the majority here..lighten up a little. You don't define ""terrible GPA."" If your GPA is truly abysmal, GPA<2.0, perhaps, then you really should do some reflection and figure out why. If by ""terrible GPA"" you mean 2<GPA<3 then you should still reflect on why, but also look at what else you might be doing. Are you in any leadership role on campus? By leadership role, I mean, are you the president, vp, or hold any other office? Do you volunteer? Do you work part- or full-time? How are you spending time outside of class, in other words? Many successful people have had crappy GPAs and it is mostly due to being involved in other positive activities, like volunteering, learning how to program, web design, getting a start-up off the ground. Employers are really interested in how you problem-solve, how you apply yourself, how you think through challenges. However, if your spending your time outside of class trying to achieve the next badge in Call of Duty, I'm not sure that will go far helping you gain employment."
Professors,27bpwc,Professor_IR,6,Wed Jun 4 21:10:05 2014 UTC,"Generally speaking, this is good advice. The few counters I'd offer are mostly minor:  1) Don't wait until May/June to start preparing your file; if you are going on the market in the fall start in January. You'll need to request letters from faculty and if you do that in the summer you may well miss some of the early deadlines.  2) Ignore this advice entirely: ""...you should not be rewriting your letter and customizing it to any great extent for every job you apply for.""  From my long experience on SLAC search committees, this is actually mandatory. Most of my colleagues read the cover letter first for each file, and often reject candidates based on that alone; the ones who don't even bother to write in our institution's name, much less specifically address the details of the job ad and our department, are among the first ones tossed. Your cover letter must be customized to the position and should specifically address the job ad, your qualifications, and explain why you want our job. We are looking to cut the pool and generic cover letters are among the first to go.  3) The article is from an R1 perspective. Anyone looking at teaching schools (SLAC, CC, some comprehensives) needs to prepare a teaching demonstration and practice it in front of real people. That is almost always the determining factor in our hires, and lots of people with excellent files and strong research credentials get tossed due to poor teaching demonstrations. Know the teaching culture of each place you interview and adjust accordingly; on our campus, for example, the 60 minute lecture died out about 20 years ago. Candidates who come in an simply talk at our students are dropped immediately.  Overall this column offers good advice. Just keep in mind it's from an R1 perspective, so some of that advice will not serve you well if you are applying to teaching schools."

I'm not sure that most student's understand the science behind spaced repetition, but I think in general people understand that if you practice something, then walk away,then come back to it and practice again you retain more. You will have to distinguish yourself from Quizlet, which is free, by emphasizing the learning factor to potential users (think how Lumosity has convinced people they are necessary). Also, I would suggest doing annual or semester-long pricing, rather than monthly. I do a lot of usability testing. If you need someone to take a look, let me know."

Yes, people management and project workflow, specific to the university lab. For example, undergraduate students - they join for a year at most. An enormous turnover. How to train them quickly so that they are productive. Software that would help manage a lab of 20 people. My experience is that email is overwhelming, weekly meetings are a huge time sink, tasks are constantly forgotten, ignored, and misunderstood by students, and tools like Microsoft Project are rather useless.

Second: He could conceivably get another postdoc, but he isn't ready for a professorship (which is where pubs really matter).  I don't see how he can blame a dead professor on him not publishing -- how does he not have a dissertation?  You can't get a PhD without one?  TLDR; tell him to go find another postdoc -- there are plenty out there.  Make sure he focuses on publishing."

He did not expect to get scooped by the postdoc he had worked with.    Your point about not renewing vs. firing is well made and point taken.  They only had a verbal agreement for the long term plan.  But with my own people, when it is getting close to the time for them to leave, I make sure they have something to wrap up and go with.  I do know the reason why the postdoc is not being renewed, and I should have seen it coming.  That PI just doesn't like people to do things their own way.  He has never had a postdoc move on to a faculty position anywhere outside of the developing world. The postdoc's way to manage the situation was to do it the PI's way but also try things a few other ways and do some innovation on his own time.  I can see the logic of that, but of course it was counter productive in the end because the failures of his own ideas made him look bad and when they worked better than the PI's the PI was shown-up.  Ironically, I think this makes the postdoc a bad postdoc but a good scientist."

I've lost a few colleagues that way over the years; we're on a ladder system and the administration simply will not negotiate salaries. Everyone is paid the same at the same rank/years of service, so making a deal with an individual would undermine the system.   I also know several people who got $$ offers, tried to negotiate and failed, and then decided to stay anyway. Of course, unlike some of the schools others are posting from here, we've never had a year without a raise...the worst I got was 1.5% in 2009, and I've gotten 5-6% more than a few times over the years."
Professors,25wqap,SnowblindAlbino,7,Mon May 19 05:41:45 2014 UTC,"Start with your supervisor so it isn’t seen as going above their head.    That depends on the school.

Professors,25wqap,SnowblindAlbino,5,Mon May 19 05:22:32 2014 UTC,You should still tell your Chair.  Its bad form to side-step them in any case whether or not they can make a decision.
Professors,25wqap,geogle,4,Mon May 19 05:44:45 2014 UTC,"That depends on circumstance. If there's a chance you might not leave, it may well be better for the chair not to know that you're on the market at all. This depends, of course, on institutional culture and the dean/chair relationship, but I've seen chairs in this situation set out to make life miserable for someone who got an outside offer-- there's always the possibility of the chair taking the situation as ""Oh, so we're not good enough for you?""  In departments where the chair rotates around, it is often common practice for chairs to be left out of personnel decisions (retirements, resignations, contract bargaining) entirely as they have no role in the matter and it's best to keep some things private."
Professors,25wqap,SnowblindAlbino,3,Mon May 19 13:36:06 2014 UTC,"This is fair.  My experience here is limited to a position with a semi-non-rotating Chair.  It has been my understanding and interpretation however that the person in the Chair position should be fighting to make the department the best it can be, and a part of that should be in fighting as your advocate to retain you (should this be for the greater good of the department).   Of course, it also might be that the resources necessary to keep you outweigh their interest in you.  If this is the case, be very prepared to leave.  I've never interviewed elsewhere where that wasn't the intention.  Also, keep in mind that the sign that you are being attracted by other schools is something that a forward-looking Chair or Dean should view positively, in and of itself, about your academic worth."

I don't interpret it as asking you to lie to your students (""suuuure that 1.7 will get you into XYZ Dream School..."").  Rather, I see it as a blanket policy to prevent people from letting their own biases (or even good or bad moods, or fondness for or loathing of a particular students's sense of humor, or whatever) get in the way of letting the students make their own decisions.  I also see it, as others have suggested, as pretty much requiring that you gve students as much information as you can so that they can make that decision responsibly.   Walking the line between encouraging students to aspire to something better (most of my students are also first-generation college attendees) and discouraging them from sinking their time and money into something that just isn't feasible for them is tough; this policy actually seems as though it might help with that. A professor's words can often carry much more weight for a student than we realize (even if it seems at times that no one is listening); asking them to take some responsibility for thinking and judging for themselves seems like part of the educational process.   I also don't think the policy necessitates a lack of candor: you can tell them, when they ask, that you're not allowed to say, and suggest that this is because your opinion is ultimately not the one that matters, and use that as a spring-board to redirect the conversation to their aptitude and GPA in relation to the requirements for grad school in your field.  Or maybe I've just been drinking the kool-aid."

You know that their chances of survival are not great (say, 20%), but on the other hand, do you want to play God and pretend that you can guess now whether they will respond to a treatment or not? Do you want to make them to give up, if they can actually beat the odds? Just because you don't have full information about them, and just because you can not really see the future? And also because whatever you say to them will change this future in some way or another?  Sharing statistics is a great idea. But they should ultimately judge for themselves.

Professors,25pctq,GhotiStyx,5,Sun Jun 8 14:15:28 2014 UTC,"My guess is that the rationale is that it will lead some students to drop out of the major.  That means fewer students taking upper-level and elective courses, which means less political power within the college/university and potentially a shrinking of the department size.  It's a sad reality that the economics of things plays so directly into academic decisions, but that's where we seem to be these days.  You're right to be concerned that you're doing harm to students, and it's no better (possibly worse) if the rationale is consistent with what I've suggested. I agree with the suggestion to provide as much information as you can to help your students make an informed decision on their own.  This helps the students while minimizing the potential political repercussions to you for ""harming"" the department via shrinking course enrollments."

Professors,25pctq,kingpolly1,7,Sun May 18 05:13:32 2014 UTC,"That's some bullshit. I would just tell the students that it's ""unofficial"" advice and ask them to kindly keep it quiet. I don't think there's anything unethical about violating a stupid policy.  With that said, you should also be clear that your opinion is not the be all end all, and it's really just one person's opinion. Advise them to seek other opinions (but not from your colleagues I suppose). Also remember to be vigilant about your unconscious biases."

Professors,25ikoy,Intothehoriz,2,Wed May 14 05:22:08 2014 UTC,"I imagine that depends entirely on the school, the field, and the instructor. I'm a historian at an SLAC, so for one data point I can tell you that my 100-level history courses do not follow the traditional ""survey"" model or have a midterm/final. By contrast, our intro courses are topical and grades are based on papers and discussion.   Generally speaking over the last ten years I've assigned somewhere between 6-10 books plus a stack of articles and primary sources (about 75 pages of reading per class meeting, unless it's a novel in which case there's be twice that). Writing assignments would include a series of 3-page (1,000 word) critical analysis papers that ask the students to use both primary and secondary sources, longer response papers on 2-3 novels (1,500-2,000 words each), and a 10-12 page research paper. I also have them do pre-discussion papers for most class meetings (one page, 300-400 words) unless something else is due, and occasionally toss in a primary source project that requires a couple of pages of writing as well. In a semester that's probably in the 35-40 page range, not counting quizzes and little writing things that might come up off the syllabus.  But my classes are all <25 and our students are expected to write a lot because that's what historians do. If they took an intro course in economics, for example, the same students might well not write anything at all...quizzes and exams make up most of the grades in their 100-level classes."

Professors,25ikoy,idip31,1 point,Thu Jun 26 06:17:47 2014 UTC,"In introductory biology at a small private university I just have 4 exams and a final worth twice as much as an exam. They can drop one exam. My exams are 4 questions per page times 4 pages and the can skip one question. They fill 4 solid pages with teeny tiny little words and figures.   In Research Methods I assign lots of 1-page response papers to journal article readings. And they do a popular press article (2-3 pages), a primary literature paper with methods and results (10 pages or so), and a grant proposal (5 pages).  My facvorites are the one-page responses because there's nowhere to hide. Either you have an idea and you can set it up, develop it, and wrap it up or you got BS/nothing. The students learn quickly how to make a point and get lots of practice. I've adapted them for just about every purpose. It ensures they collect their thoughts and they can see them. After class discussions I have them spend five minutes on the back writing an updated response and they talk about how they changed their minds since they wrote the paper and what they learned. Metacognition like that reinforces learning and makes them appreciate and understand what is going on."
Professors,25ikoy,Jobediah,1 point,Wed May 14 15:16:16 2014 UTC,"I teach courses in composition, rhetoric, and professional writing.  An introductory composition course at my school would have roughly 25-30 pages of final-draft major assignment work, along with at least that amount in low-stakes minor assignment & in-class activity writing over the course of the semester. This does not count the 'rough draft' versions of the major assignments, all of which would get submitted for peer and instructor feedback before the final due date for each assignment.  In terms of the content of the major assignments, there would likely be a sequence of connected subject matter but distinct genres. For example, a research proposal might lead into a literature review of a topic in a given academic discipline. This in turn leads to an exploratory 'fieldwork' paper (collecting data from interviews or surveys), followed up by a critical essay connecting the fieldwork data to the conversation covered in the lit review.  An alternative approach might look at conversations in different arenas--covering a topic through a 'popular' lens, analysing that topic critically from one or two sources, and then making an argument about the topic with the aid of more numerous/diverse source material."
Professors,25be38,kingpolly1,6,Sun May 11 23:32:01 2014 UTC,"There is a lot of obvious stuff to look for: somone articulate, curious, focused, interested, with good grades and recs, so I am going to mention a few of the other things I look for.  This is going to sound like an odd answer but it works for me: check their writing. Although I am a scientist and you would think that writing is a red herring, I find that it is the most revealing of how sophisticated the student is intellectually and how disciplined they can be as a scholar.  Doing well on tests and lab reports tends to only reflect a certain puzzle-solving skill that is not necessarily equivalent to a talent for scientific inquiry, where clean-cut, correct answers are rare and there are no defined periods for finding them.  The other thing I look for is life experience.  At another job, I had undergraduate and graduate students from multiple institutions in the area, one was a premiere level R1, one was a top tier R1 (one level down), and then there were a variety of local schools that catered mostly to a commuter population and had many ""mature"" students.  It came clear pretty fast that the ""mature"" students were the ones who had the capacity for good research and had a good work ethic.  The premiere-level students were often so over-committed and often dove into research without thinking about the time and intellectual commitment necessary.  The mature students had already had other lives and knew why they were in school, why the wanted to be scientists, and what they were will to do to get there.  I found that the ranking of college a an undergraduate went to correlated a lot more closely with their socioeconomic background and that puzzle-solving ability than true intellectual promise."

What has changed is how I react to poor performance. Early in my career as a teacher, I would get very upset when students wouldn't put in the work or were struggling; I oftentimes doubted whether I had sufficiently motivated or guided them. I attribute that to naivete and anxiety, and as I got more experience, I definitely became more removed from student outcomes and hardened a bit. That's definitely an asset when dealing with bullshit and laziness - I will fail a poor performer and go home to sleep like a baby these days - but I have to be more careful that I don't dismiss and ignore poor performance among students who need help. It's a tricky balance for sure."

Agreed. At a small school like mine (classes always <25, often seminars of 15 or so) I can usually tell if a student is actually struggling or just slacking off. I will work my ass off to help a struggling student, but I have no respect at all for slackers. In fact, I someone relish the D/F students who just don't turn stuff in or make such a mockery of assignments that I can fail them easily. They make grading so much quicker, as I don't feel any need to waste my time writing much in the way of comments on their papers either.  When I was new I thought, for some reason, that there was a way to take the D/F screwoff student and engage them. Now I don't bother, because it's become clear to me that there are some students who are not in college to learn, but mostly to party, and because mommy/daddy are paying their bills they just don't care what happens in class. I'd honestly rather they flunk out so they aren't taking up space in my classroom...luckily I only encounter one of those students every so often."

Professors,255zr8,invisiblecows,3,Fri May 9 23:38:11 2014 UTC,"Yes, I agree. The students bring in grading expectations that they learned from high school, and they're not willing to adapt to the higher standards of college-level work. They have also adopted the consumer mentality that you can always get what you want if you're willing to raise enough of a stink. The student who always scraped by in high school by doing the minimum work required absolutely loses his mind when he gets an F for performing at the same level in college. And of course, because I teach English and the standards are subjective, it's easy for students to complain that I ""grade hard"" and am ""impossible to please."" I have become more lenient just because I don't want to have to deal with students pitching fits in my office and blasting me in evaluations.  It's at the point where I don't really feel that I can fail anyone except for plagiarism or incomplete work. If a student turns in a paper that is absolute crap but still meets the required word count and is at least somewhat related to the original prompt, I feel like I have to slap a D on it."

Professors,255zr8,justamathnerd,2,Wed May 14 05:07:20 2014 UTC,"I've been teaching 20+ years, the first five at an R1 and the rest at an SLAC. My standards have gone up fairly consistently over that time, during which access to information has become dramatically more efficient so I expect more in return. At the upper bound, I've seen our senior theses grow from perhaps 25-30 pages on average to 50-55 pages during that time, mostly because we've strengthened our curriculum in research methods and writing, so the final products are much better.  At the lower end, I stopped giving exams years ago and instead push my students to write quite a bit more...typically 35-40 pages of formal writing for a 100 level course (I'm in history), so several 5-page papers, a 12-15 page research paper, and some short assignments.  20 years ago I did the typical quizzes/midterm/final thing.  The other thing that has shifted is my overall grading philosophy. Years ago I did everything with points and used a strict 60/70/80/90 scale. Since then I've shifted to just giving letter grades, which is more subjective. The distribution has changed as well; originally I looked for a traditional bell curve but for years now I've ended up with about 5-8% in the A/A- range, perhaps 50% in the B range, and the balance mostly in the high Cs. I guess that's still a bell, but it has a very high peak-- this is because I stopped giving exams, give students feedback on draft papers, and as a result the overall quality of their work has increased. I hold the line at the upper bound, though, because I think an A grade should still mean ""superior"" and most students can't/won't meet that standard.  I should note that I'm at a $$$ private SLAC, so our students are generally from the top 10% of their high school classes, all live on campus, and they will do whatever we ask in terms of assignment. It's not Ivy by any means, but in general I can't complain about our students. As as result my standards have crept up over time because I want to push them to do better than they were asked to do in high school."

Rather than 100-300 students in an entry level history class I have 25...which means lots more time to grade papers and work with students individually.  A 500 word ""paper,"" as you mention, is what we'd consider among the ""other miscellaneous assignments"" in a course...I might ask them to do that sort of thing as prep for any given class meeting and would not consider that part of the ""formal"" graded writing for the class.  But schools like ours are known for emphasizing writing...that's part of what we're selling for the high $$$ price tag, and obviously not everyone can or wants to attend a school with a $50K sticker price."

It will make them strive for excellence knowing that it is a competition and best of all, you don't have to mark it. The real world value is on one's resume. The students can say that they competed in and led a team for John Doe's Management Competition.   2) Use clickers to present situations to your students and then have them vote on which one of several options they would pick to handle said situation.   3) 100 people is still small enough to have meaningful discussions and debates. Once they have selected clicker questions, call upon them to depend their choices.   4) Have fun with the powerpoint (or whatever presentation format you use).

It was a 100+ student introductory level class, so even basic questions to check comprehension worked well.

Professors,254kih,VetMichael,4,Mon May 12 16:01:13 2014 UTC,"Hi; I was in your position a year ago so here's what I would suggest - BTW, I'm envious that you get a TA...I never even got a grader or any kind of help. One caveat; the set-up will take a bit of work and may not be as easy to do at your institution (see below).  Flip the Class - put your weekly or bi-weekly lectures online and keep that as required homework due before the students walk in the door on the day of class. The idea is that when sitting in a huge classroom, there are so many other students, distractions, and reasons not to pay attention that most students just won't get anything out of lecture. Canned, online lectures hosted by Moodle, Blackboard, or even YouTube speak directly to the student (at least in their perception) and will have a better chance of sticking.  mini-quizes every class day My university has a slew of iPads for class use which can be reserved ahead of time. I put a quick, three- to five-question quiz on Blackboard which cover the lecture topics. This is how I take attendance, gauge class 'participation' and ensure that the students are watching the lecture for homework. Because the quizes do so much work, they're worth a small, but significant, percent of the grade in a term. Beauty of it is, even students who are sick that day can still take the quiz online. These questions should only take 10 or so minutes of your class time, and is a good way to allow you time to set up step 3.  Class discussions can work in large class sizes You might want to pre-assign groups (I had five in mine) so it minimizes the awkward stares and weird shuffle students do. You'll notice that I haven't mentioned the textbook at all yet; this is where it comes in to play. After the students have gotten into their groups (say 20 or so), you discuss the topics that will be covered in the book just a little bit - general concepts and ideas; in my History class, things like the roots of the materials revolutions, or the establishment of the Abbasid Caliphate, or the underlying principles which caused the Great Depression. Then you assign each group a different aspect of the lesson - for example, one group would look at the move from Damascus to Baghdad under the Abbasid Caliphate, while another looks at the Abbasid reliance on Mamluk Turks instead of tribal Arabs and Persians, and a third will look at the judicial reforms under a certain Caliph, etc.  Move from group to group spend about ten minutes per group asking questions, providing cryptic insight or perspective, or otherwise prompting them to dig deeper into the topic. Then move on. Give each groups equal attention and vary the groups you go to so group 1 doesn't always get your attention first or group 5 feels like a red-headed step child all the time. Prompting discussion and answering general questions to facilitate further investigation is key here: In one class, I played the part of the intelligence director for a class on terrorism & revolution, offering insight and clues as the teams worked to decide what threats were 'real' and which were to be downgraded. The point was to discuss and discover (in a very personal way) some of the concepts and complications involved in the subject.  Essay Midterms and Finals skip the multiple guess questions and go straight for the jugular with the essay. First, they've already had weeks of multiple choice, so there's no point in beating that dead horse. Second, the essays will allow them to show you that they've been doing the work in class; sometimes, some students are content to sit back and just let others do the day-to-day work (it's human nature, I guess) and the students who did the work will shine while those who loafed or floated through the classes will flounder. One warning, however, keep the essay to a manageable length for you to be able to grade. Since the mini-quizes are autograded, this is really the only time you'll have to wrangle with grading in the term. I set a ceiling of three to four paragraphs per student. On one hand, the students will feel like it was a breeze and on the other hand, you'll keep them from rambling on and on.  My results were better than I expected; I was making a lot of this up as I went along - formatting, quiz length, midterm and final format, etc - the first term, but learned quickly from my mistakes and successes to offer a much better class the next term. And I think that's the key for you; don't be overly worried to get ""five star"" ratings from your students right out of the gate, as you probably won't. instead, focus on improvement, pedagogy, and quality exercises. Once you feel good about what you have in store for them, invite your chair to sit in on a class and participate, so he or she gets an idea of what the class is all about (and can put the complaints/comments/praise in context) as well as offer them a chance for mentoring.  Hope it works out for you and please let me think of the format if you do try it."
Professors,254kih,Trillian42,2,Fri May 9 17:55:35 2014 UTC,"I agree completely on the short quizzes at the start of class. I did a variation of this for a class I taught: several random pop quizzes throughout the term. I knew when they would be, but the students did not. This really kept them on their toes and really kept them up to date on the homework (especially when they all inevitably bombed the first one, as they didn't take the idea of a ""pop quiz"" seriously). It was a little extra work to grade, but definitely worth it."

Then the next hour could be spent like you describe, in groups of about 5. I have some fun, interesting, and challenging group activities in mind which would probably require some write-ups. I am glad to hear that this format could work.  I was going to do multiple choice exams, but I think I may do a mixture. Grading 200 short essays twice a term is probably not THAT horrible.

Virtually all of them are top 10% of their high school classes, they have solid ACT/SAT scores, and generally impressive admission files. These are the prototypical ""college prep track"" kids who have been on a trajectory toward college since grade school.  But while they may be prepared on paper, we find that a growing percentage are not prepared in reality. What the lack primarily is self-discipline and study skills. Even the 4.0 high school student may never have been asked to do any real work; they are great at taking objective tests for which they've studies for months, but terrible at writing basic essays or digesting an article for discussion. American high schools are failing to prepare even their brightest students for college.  What we do is hammer them in the first semester, sort of like boot camp, in hope of shocking them into the realization that their high school work ethic and habits won't work in college. Then we figure out which students are really in need of intervention (which is typically a small group, maybe 5%) and reach out to those students. We connect them with the writing center, math center, academic advising, counseling, and lots of one-on-one time with faculty advisors. I have bent over backward to help poorly prepared students learn to be successful in my courses, and am generally able to at least get them to C level.   But we do lose some, and institutionally have agreed that some students we admit simply cannot/will not be successful in our setting. Those students we try to counsel into a smart transfer, to a community college or public comprehensive, where they can get remedial courses if necessary and the expectations are perhaps a bit different. But yes, they need to be told-- in a way that doesn't say ""Wow, you are a terrible student and shouldn't be here at all!"" but instead says something like ""We don't seem like the best fit for you, perhaps I can help you explore your options."" I've actually seen some students transfer out for a year or three semesters, then come back in and do quite well.  What we can't do, at least at my SLAC, is heavy remedial work or simply fail out large numbers of students as neither approach is compatible with our mission or culture."

I figure I can either try to teach as much as I can, or just not have students."
Professors,253uxn,InSearchOfGoodPun,2,Fri May 9 05:35:57 2014 UTC,"It depends on the course and when it's taught. I teach at a community college (math, astronomy, and physics since Jan. 2012), so the preparation of students can vary widely within a course and between different sections of the same course, as well as between higher-level and lower-level courses.  First, there's a definite distinction between evening students and daytime students. My evening students tend to be older returning students. As such, they are definitely more motivated, mature, and willing to actually ask questions when they don't understand something.  My daytime students tend to be younger, fresh out of high school, and a worrying number of them are there not because they want to learn or have a real interest in the material, but because that's what came next. This is obviously not true for all of them, but a sizable minority skip classes when they feel like it, fail to turn in homework, and don't ask questions, then complain that they don't understand a topic. They're also the most likely to whine about their grade at the end of the semester.  Then, of course, there's differences between lower-level and upper-level classes. Lower-level classes are pretty hit and miss, and are especially prone to the evening/daytime distinction. I've taught Algebra II and not had to fail a single student; I've taught Algebra II and failed five or six out of twenty. I do notice that students in their mid-twenties and above tend to comprehend (and remember) the material better than students just out of high school; I attribute this to the increased focus on standardized testing and falling standards in high school math and science.   Upper-level classes are a little less so, but I've taught calculus I and II (which I would consider upper-level for a community college) and been dismayed by some of the students' ability to do even basic algebra. I've had students in Calc I who didn't know how to multiply binomials, factor polynomials, or even use the quadratic formula. These do tend to be younger students as well. The only course I taught where I didn't have this problem was a summer session of Calc II (which also remains my favorite class I've taught).   When a student is obviously unprepared for a course, I will try to work with the student to bring them up to speed. Sometimes it's easy; in physics, a quick review of the quadratic formula and basic trigonometry can work wonders. In calculus, sometimes they just need a refresher on solving polynomials and factoring. Other times, it's a lost cause; I've advised them to withdraw from the class and take some remedial math first. There's not much else I can do; encouraging them to come to office hours and ask questions when they don't understand something is it.   Since I teach math and science, I don't deal with a lot of writing assignments (mostly lab reports), though when I teach a gen-ed astronomy course, I like to throw in a term paper that requires them to do actual research on current topics in astronomy. The quality of these papers varies widely. I've had well-written, properly-cited papers that are a joy to read and grade written by students who are interested in the topic (or able to fake it for the course), and I've had utter messes that are a grammatical nightmare and are factually wrong on a very fundamental level. Again, there's a big divide between older students and younger students here, and again, it doesn't make younger students look good.   There are of course exceptions to the division (current high school students taking advanced courses at the college are the usual ones), but as a general rule, my younger students tend to be more unprepared, worse at writing, less motivated, and more entitled than my older students."

Professors,252usl,kingpolly1,15,Thu May 8 22:13:18 2014 UTC,"What an absurd waste of time and energy...  I just teach.  It's pretty simple.  I have a set of standards I want my students to achieve, and when exam time rolls around, they know how to do what I want them to or they fail.    I don't like giving low grades, but it is a highly effective means of communication."
Professors,252usl,Deradius,4,Thu May 8 22:51:48 2014 UTC,"My first exam is almost always the hardest (not because I go out of my way to make it the hardest, but some of the hardest/new concepts come first, and if you understand those, the rest of the class should be easier).  Most of the F students will drop while the rest of the class starts to actually do the readings and pay attention.  I can usually see a notable increase in the quality of discussion and questions following the first exam."
Professors,252usl,manova,2,Fri May 9 00:49:02 2014 UTC,"I do not like gotcha-teaching, and unfortunately it seems pretty common.  Part of the problem IMO is the selection into academia: the majority of people who have become professors have been on that track for a long time and sincerely don't understand the students who seem unengaged—regardless of whether that's the case or not.  Set policies and make exams that you think are fair to a decent student, and provide opportunities to boost grades. The exceptional students will take advantage or won't need them; the unengaged probably won't but it gives you some insurance if they suddenly show up at the end of the semester asking why their grade is low.   The thing is, most students at that age are still learning about the world and it's up to you to show them why what you're teaching is interesting and worth learning about. Some students won't put in an effort no matter what—smart students, not-so-smart students, at bad schools and at top-rate schools. That's fine—they won't excel. But there are plenty of students who don't go to office hours and don't do well on everything who still get a lot out of the class, and you do a disservice to all of them when you make an effort to weed them out."
Professors,252usl,soapydansk,1 point,Mon May 12 16:10:45 2014 UTC,"My class sizes are set ahead of time - there's absolutely no payoff to trying to get rid of people: I love what I do, and I want them to love it too!  If they work hard, they get good grades, if not, they don't.  My students are adults who are there to learn as much as they want to learn.  Trying to teach only to a select few seems like laziness and narcissism."
