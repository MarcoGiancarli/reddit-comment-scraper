I noticed that the players in the video using Flying Meta were using other body types rather than the van and perhaps I jumped to a conclusion that they do have the same stats, but for such good players to not use vans (if they do not share weight/stats) would be silly considering the noticeable and obvious hitbox difference that the body types portray. It is strictly theory on my end and if anyone would correct me I would love it, because I personally love this game and would very much appreciate knowing more about the game."

NLSSCircleJerk,3auwab,Lucky1291,6,Tue Jun 23 22:13:22 2015 UTC,has nl ever officially cancelled a series?
NLSSCircleJerk,3auwab,Freeman720,6,Wed Jun 24 01:32:33 2015 UTC,"I think xcom long war would be the closest, because he just got beat down (Believe he states that in one of the later videos of that series)"
NLSSCircleJerk,3auwab,Lucky1291,12,Wed Jun 24 02:50:03 2015 UTC,"It's a shame, really. I've moved from enjoying his youtube content to watching his livestream. Watching Issac and Nuclear Throne almost exclusively has just become a bore.  I can't tell what the issue is on why he gives up on series' but he also states things like not playing dark souls 3, or his lack luster DS 2 run through. A shame considering I found him through Dank Souls. Mind you, I'm just one guy, and I find him a great personality, I just wish he'd expand himself into other avenues."
NLSSCircleJerk,3auwab,Svarthofthi,5,Wed Jun 24 08:02:51 2015 UTC,"I can understand him not doing a DS3 playthrough on YT (well at least not a blind one) because the comments tend to always seem to just be telling him how to play, or mad because he did something wrong. So I can understand why he wouldn't want to. I wish he'd branch out as well, I've gone back to just watching livestreams myself or his older series I hadn't watched yet because rebirth is just stale for me now because it's been 2 a day, and now he never loses"
NLSSCircleJerk,3auwab,Lucky1291,5,Wed Jun 24 13:06:55 2015 UTC,"If it were me I suppose I would be more concerned with youtube metrics as opposed to commentators. His other series seemed to me at least somewhat popular. I know that I, personally, get excited to see him playing something interesting like Invisible, Inc, or Dark Souls 2.  It is sort of difficult to come away from him talking about commentators affecting his gaming choice without it as far as I can tell not giving views. Although, in practice, he admitted playing the EU4 series even though it was a low view count, which I am very thankful for because I love that game and its a bit of difference.  It is coming off as a bit over-sensitive to me. Mind you, I understand that these things can have a negative effect on you if you constantly subject yourself to it. Hence why TB doesn't allow for comments. However, NL may be opposed to disabling comments because he may be interested in getting in touch with his audience.  In any case, I hope we see some change. I can't speak for anyone but myself, but I've all but stopped watching his YT uploads and it bums me out a little."
NLSSCircleJerk,3auwab,Svarthofthi,2,Wed Jun 24 13:21:54 2015 UTC,"Ya, I think he's to the point where most games he would play would do quite well, as you said even EU4 continues (which I've been catching up on since I stopped watching Isaac). And ya I'm surprised he hasn't disabled comments yet either. I'm hoping he'll lose his Isaac streak and he'll stop focusing so much on it because that has (at least from my view) become such a huge focus that he puts off recording other series because he's only playing isaac (he notes this in his last NT video)"
NLSSCircleJerk,3auwab,Lucky1291,2,Wed Jun 24 13:27:23 2015 UTC,"Well at least there is some cause for hope then. I'm not overly concerned with his preoccupation with Issac, it seems to me that he craves a good streak to be considered up there in leagues with snaps and cobalt. If that is the case, he deserves it, he's a good player considering he's trying to be entertaining as well."
NLSSCircleJerk,3auwab,Svarthofthi,1 point,Wed Jun 24 13:33:42 2015 UTC,"That honestly what I'm kinda hoping for too, not that I want to see him lose the streak but that he admitted several times that he would play more Isaac instead of taking a break and record other stuff. I really wish he kept the Invisible Inc. series going since the campaign is pretty short it could have been a cool 20 or so episode series that ended on a good note."

NLSSCircleJerk,3ann7f,kefka40,6,Mon Jun 22 01:32:32 2015 UTC,"Thanks, appreciate the feedback."

NLSSCircleJerk,3ann7f,Speznuts,9,Mon Jun 22 00:18:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I've been considering that too. I think that's a viable option if the votes are pretty close. Thanks for the idea!"
NLSSCircleJerk,3ann7f,dallen,4,Mon Jun 22 00:19:48 2015 UTC,"Hey NL, silly idea here but what if you just streamed indefinitely?"
NLSSCircleJerk,3ann7f,StrykarZee,3,Tue Jun 23 12:27:05 2015 UTC,I'd vote for alternating if that were an option. I like the new idea but it would suck if multi-player games were out completely.
NLSSCircleJerk,3ann7f,Lord_Malvern,1 point,Mon Jun 22 02:13:50 2015 UTC,"I'm all for the rotating biweekly thing, but I don't know which one to vote to try and make the poll more even. :p"
NLSSCircleJerk,3ann7f,ChocoROID,7,Tue Jun 23 01:42:14 2015 UTC,"The solo sub stream seems like it could be interesting, there's some weird shit out there that I'm sure would be fun to watch NL play. At the same time, getting too weird risks the Sunday Stream coming off as a clone of Vinesauce's streams."
NLSSCircleJerk,3ann7f,coffeehouse11,8,Mon Jun 22 00:23:08 2015 UTC,"I think I'd be okay whatever he did/played, I'm here for the stream of consciousness style of commentary where NL can just talk and talk. But I completely agree that something weird could ruin it like the Cons said. There would have to be a balance between chaos and intrigue.  By that I mean, people ARE going to vote for utter crap and the novelty might catch on now and then, and it could make for some intersting conversation.  On the other hand, I'd hate for NL to be playing something he genuinely does not enjoy, I'm sure we would not enjoy that either, but I'm quite confident that even if the subscribers voted for the chaos of something truly odd now and then, that they would understand if our friendly neighborhood lion skipped to the next game on the docket if what was being played made a bad video."
NLSSCircleJerk,3ann7f,ChocoROID,6,Mon Jun 22 00:41:41 2015 UTC,"I think that there will have to be some room for me to make an executive decision, yeah. If people are voting for wacky stuff that is also terrible, I think I need to be able to axe it before it gets monotonous, and I think people would understand that.    I also like this idea because it opens up the potential for sort of new types of content. Of course this could lead to more Geoguessr, Nuclear Throne, XCOM, etc. but it could also be an opportunity for people to vote something onto the docket that turns into sort of a weekly Let's Play. That will have to be addressed if it seems popular enough, though."
NLSSCircleJerk,3ann7f,Chrismas95,5,Mon Jun 22 00:50:26 2015 UTC,"speaking of XCOM, there's a twitch streamer by the name of Lollash who streams a lot of Long War and one thing he does is do a lottery for a name in chat (though his lottery is weighted by a bot, don't know the details), and then allows that user to choose their upgrades as they level up.  If you ended up doing XCOM on the sub stream you could maybe use that as a jumping off point for how to include the subs."
NLSSCircleJerk,3ann7f,Chrismas95,3,Mon Jun 22 03:34:42 2015 UTC,I love the idea of a lottery that allows subs the chance to influence the game personally. Not sure how it would work with certain games but there would need to be ground rules that would probably complicate things.
NLSSCircleJerk,3ann7f,Japlex,5,Mon Jun 22 05:59:53 2015 UTC,"This seems like a great idea to put variety in the Subscriber streams. Not having enough suitable multiplayer games to play with subscribers has ALWAYS been a problem, and the CS:GO and TF2 sub streams probably alienated people who weren't interested in FPSs (I liked them personally, but I digress). Having a vote every week not only means variety, but it gives everyone a chance to be included. I'll be honest, I never even tried to get in on sub stream games because I knew the effort would be futile. I'm sure I'm not the only one, either, so a poll is something easy that every subscriber can actually participate in.  As for the cons, the staleness factor is going to have to be addressed. While it seems kinda ironic considering the NLSS itself follows a usually predicable pattern, I feel like the sub streams should have variety. So, to prevent people from voting for the same game over and over again, it might be good to redact the game from the voting if it was already played recently. And I definitely agree that you'll need to be able to veto a game. While you're flexible with all of your Let's Look Ats, playing a game that you find a drag for that long would be fun for no one. Maybe have people suggest games in the Circle Jerk, pick out ones that are mentioned a lot/you know that you won't hate, then throw them all in a poll for subs? I also suggest, to make sure people don't just give up if a game has a heavy lead, to play both the first and second place games for 1.5 hours each per week. That way it doesn't get stale with one game for three straight hours, but is still a long enough time to have a fun time with both. Maybe even use the bi-weekly idea.  However this works, I at least hope you try out the voting idea. Some people might not agree with it in words, but they might come around to it after seeing it in practice and vice versa."
NLSSCircleJerk,3ann7f,Misioslaw,2,Mon Jun 22 01:13:27 2015 UTC,I also forgot to mention: It'd be nice if you uploaded the Sunday stream VODs to Youtube as well. I was never really sure why they haven't been in the first place; I always end up watching the VOD on Twitch or end up forgetting as a result.
NLSSCircleJerk,3ann7f,pigsnoutman,6,Mon Jun 22 05:33:25 2015 UTC,JUST DO IT!
NLSSCircleJerk,3ann7f,mustflow,3,Mon Jun 22 01:25:44 2015 UTC,Asking on behalf of people from different time-zones:  Would you upload the VOD to Youtube as you SOMETIMES do with NLSS?
NLSSCircleJerk,3ann7f,mustflow,9,Mon Jun 22 06:15:29 2015 UTC,"The reason I don't upload the sub stream to YouTube right now is because I'm not super proud of the content. It's fun but I don't necessarily want to advertise it (it is readily available to watch on Twitch, of course). If the revised sub stream works better, I would be totally up for uploading it to YouTube."
NLSSCircleJerk,3ann7f,RockLeeSmile,3,Mon Jun 22 06:24:14 2015 UTC,"Not directly relevant, but could you publicise the sub stream a bit better. I only found out about it via twitch past broadcasts. The twitch page doesn't include a start time, it only says Sunday."
NLSSCircleJerk,3ann7f,EpicTacoProject,3,Mon Jun 22 07:12:19 2015 UTC,"Wow! Such scum! Breaking the jerk. Kappa.  But in all seriousness, if you go ahead with sub-chosen games I think you really should institute a policy about sub-games not being able to be games played on the NLSS that week. Because as I see it there are two options here, both quite unproductive: a) subs are mostly people who enjoy your ""main"" content which is Isaac and will often vote for it, like you've mentioned, b) whichever game was hot that week a lot of people would voraciously want more of it to the point of it getting stale itself. Say - when you're into Brawlhala, Gungeon, Duck Game and so on, people predominantly want to see more of those and I think it would hurt variety greatly, even if those games are engaging to watch.  So, I think no game played on the NLSS that week is a good rule for you to keep in mind. Also, more Geoguessr is always great in my book.  Cheers."
NLSSCircleJerk,3ann7f,Juaneiro,3,Mon Jun 22 08:11:28 2015 UTC,"I think something like this is fair. I'm also somewhat partial to the idea of a sub-voted Let's Play that gets 3 hours of showtime a week or something, but then you do run the risk of just having no variety for 2 months while you finish up Fallout: New Vegas or whatever is voted in. It's a delicate tightrope.    The feedback we have gotten is definitely that more variety is good. People clamor for old favorites but nobody complains about giving a new game a shot on the docket either, so I'd be looking to bring that balance to the sub streams too."
NLSSCircleJerk,3ann7f,NightmaresInNeurosis,2,Mon Jun 22 08:16:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the Sub-Play(wait, that doesn't sound right) can be cool. But you'd be wise to reserve some veto power from the start or you'll get undoubtedly drowned in all the Lost Planets and Demon Crests of the world. :)"

NLSSCircleJerk,3ann7f,Steihl,2,Mon Jun 22 09:54:22 2015 UTC,If the Let's Play thing happens you could just do that game for 1/1.5 hours of the stream and use the rest of the stream for other games.
NLSSCircleJerk,3ann7f,Gnome_Warfare,1 point,Mon Jun 22 13:16:14 2015 UTC,"How about also giving past sunday games some form of negative weight?  As in not taking them out of the equation but giving them a penalty for each sunday stream they've been on (for example, -50 votes per previous sunday stream it's been on, the specific penalty would have to be worked out to make sense) I'm one of the guys who skips the first hour of every NLSS because I'm just sick of isaac, and I can see the same thing happening if sundays just became geoguessr days or something like that."
NLSSCircleJerk,3ann7f,SynecdocheNZ,1 point,Tue Jun 23 05:42:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that seems fair. Obviously a balance needs to be struck. If one game is consistently winning with 51% of the vote, it's not fair that the slim minority constantly gets shafted."
NLSSCircleJerk,3ann7f,MalusandValus,3,Tue Jun 23 06:22:43 2015 UTC,"Regular Cobalt hype \o/  As for the Sunday streams, personally I'm cool with whatever is easiest for you. Randoms are unreliable, it's an unfortunate truth, and that's a big problem with sub streams. If you feel that solo streaming with a crowdsourced game choice is more reliable then I'm cool with that.  Now back to your regularly scheduled circlejerk: RIP Josh, Bloodborne and Invisible Inc where, 69 can't make this shit up, etc."
NLSSCircleJerk,3ann7f,PetrolOrchid,2,Mon Jun 22 13:43:19 2015 UTC,"Even as a subscriber I don't really watch the Sub stream cause its a bit boring, frankly.  Would be great to see some games that you are not doing series of on the youtube channel or don't play on normal NLSS cause its got no multiplayer.   Don't feel you should feel obligated to give further perks to subs as it is a choice."
NLSSCircleJerk,3ann7f,ChronosPlays,2,Mon Jun 22 02:56:19 2015 UTC,I was one of your first subscribers way back when you first partnered on Twitch. About six or seven months ago I canceled my sub because I just felt like I wasn't getting much out of it. I would definitely re-sub and stay subbed if the new format you suggested rolled out.
NLSSCircleJerk,3ann7f,NerdyOrDirty,2,Mon Jun 22 03:06:47 2015 UTC,I like the idea of a solo stream
NLSSCircleJerk,3ann7f,chunkosauruswrex,2,Mon Jun 22 09:16:57 2015 UTC,"I like the idea of having a portion or all of the 3 hr solo stream as being a long-running type game, like Fallout. Not unlike your XCOM series that lasted a while. This would differentiate it to the NLSS type games where they generally take up an hour and don't require continuity."
NLSSCircleJerk,3ann7f,BanjoKazoople,2,Mon Jun 22 11:33:31 2015 UTC,"I think the Solo streams are probably the most enjoyable thing to watch, and amallways excited when they happen, with the inane questions about the capitals of different countries and sandwiches of different cultures.  I think you'd have to be a bit careful with your polls though so that you'd actually end up playing something engaging rather than 3 hours of Katawa Shoujo every weekend.  I think another potential idea, though maybe a bit far-fetched and almost certaintly wouldn't work, would be to play a game with large choice elements in Dialogue (such as the Witcher, Mass Effect, Telltale's Games) and let subs decide on the choices you make through strawpolls."
NLSSCircleJerk,3ann7f,oatsandwheat,2,Mon Jun 22 14:12:39 2015 UTC,"Gotta say, I've been a subscriber for a long time, yet I never even tried playing with you, but still watched every Sunday. The Sub-streams are much more cozy, with a much more civil chat and nice and fun chat interaction that's basically never possible during the NLSS.  All this to say, I am in favour of your idea."
NLSSCircleJerk,3ann7f,Alex_walsh,2,Mon Jun 22 19:13:08 2015 UTC,"I like the idea of the solo stream. Solo streams, at least for me, are more enjoyable due to how you interact with the audience. And the fact you are pitching this as like a majority voted LP, it will be interesting to see how it goes. (Dark Souls, Xcom, Geoguessr, Fallout you know those are going to be mass voted for)   And while playing in a sub streams are fun, its just extremely rare these days to get into a game that holds less than 20 people. So at the very least it would be nice for a change up."
NLSSCircleJerk,3ann7f,coffeehouse11,2,Tue Jun 23 01:14:00 2015 UTC,"I'm really interested in that alternative. The original format for the subscriber stream kind of lost its luster for me, but a new way of doing it (haha ""doing it"") sounds awesome.  Also, Cobalt was the guy that joined the stream a little while back and played Isaac with you guys, right? I feel like a ding-dong for asking that, but I genuinely can't remember if that's who it was. I liked him though."
NLSSCircleJerk,3ann7f,Zeomaster,3,Mon Jun 22 00:35:32 2015 UTC,"Yep, that's Cobalt! He's a prolific Isaac streamer on Twitch."
NLSSCircleJerk,3ann7f,poiuytrewqazxcvbnml,0,Mon Jun 22 00:40:47 2015 UTC,NL you should definitely invite cobalt back. Up until he had technical issues he was a really good guest and I think a lot of people really enjoyed having him.

I personally would be down with watching you play games we chose, I just don't think it would work that well when put into practice"
