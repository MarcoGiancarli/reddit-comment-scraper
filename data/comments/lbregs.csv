lbregs,3dw2nm,_dabnation_,2,Mon Jul 20 00:51:19 2015 UTC,Thank you! I like it because it doesn't take away from the design on the box. It's also pretty tight so I don't have to double wrap.
lbregs,3dw2nm,_dabnation_,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:19:03 2015 UTC,Dude. . I never even considered no double wrapping. Makes this idea that much more awesome.
lbregs,3dw2nm,hellagnar,2,Mon Jul 20 04:27:50 2015 UTC,"Question, what is the purpose of the rubber band? Doesn't the click lock lid keep the lid in place well enough?"
lbregs,3dw2nm,ThePurpleHayes,2,Mon Jul 20 19:44:15 2015 UTC,"It's meant to keep it even tighter. Sometimes the click lock lid fails, I've even tried the trick were you put the battery on the metal part to melt the lid a bit. Still a bit loose so these help out a lot."

lbregs,3du106,Koalakoalakoalaaa,3,Sun Jul 19 13:36:48 2015 UTC,"Batteries, especially newish ones, will get quite hot during charging. Your friend's batts are probably just a little more worn down. As long as yours aren't getting hot enough to melt the plastic on the charger, you should be ok.  As for power adapter options, there's really only one as far as I know, and it's amazing. It's available from the magic flight website, and it's a great  investment if you're using your box at home a lot. If you already have a good tabletop vape though, you may be better off putting that money toward a finishing grinder and some tree to break it in with."
lbregs,3du106,TraceurZer0,4,Sun Jul 19 14:24:00 2015 UTC,"Thank you! I just wanted some peace at mind with it and to call it a day.   Ah i'm sorry I wasn't aware! I do vape mostly at home. Looking at it, I have a walnut MFLB. So even if I get an adaptor I will be spending the additional twenty for matching wood as well. It may not be as controllable, but I can get extra batts for 10 bucks and have a set always charged. Reasonable alternative?    Do you feel a nice grinder can be a replacement for the finishing grinder or do you still feel that it makes that extra difference?   Thank you for your help! I'm sorry if my questions seem silly!"
lbregs,3du106,TraceurZer0,2,Sun Jul 19 14:39:58 2015 UTC,"Spare batteries are always nice, but if you've got the cash the Power Adapter is worth the investment. It, too, has the amazing Magic Flight lifetime warranty, so you'll have one for life, even if it gets eaten by zombie koalas.  A good grinder will get you by just fine, but it's tough to match the finishing grinder's super fine results. Ultimately, though, I would say that the finishing grinder is a nice, but not strictly necessary accessory to pick up if/when you've got the extra money to burn."
lbregs,3du106,ADHDABE,3,Sun Jul 19 14:54:31 2015 UTC,"Thank you! I think it's something I may look into a little down the road then for my MFLB. That is one thing I really love about my MFLB- the warranty. Also, from what i've seen they have excellent customer service. I'm still new to MFLB but I love mine! Even if she gets eaten by koala zombies i'm set.   Thus far, i've had zero issues with my bud I use for vaping. However, I think I may drop the money and get the grinder. I'm gonna look at it. Thank you for the suggestion.   Final Question - Ever used a wooden stem? Yay nay?   Thank you so much for your help!!"

lbregs,3du106,thesturg,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:13:07 2015 UTC,"I have a cherry normal stem and,a walnut dart stem, but I mostly end up using my box ""native"" (without a stem.) I'd recommend hitting yours native until you're familiar enough with your box that drawing becomes reflexive. The stems tend to shoot the vapor straight to the back of your throat, making it a bit harder to judge the temperature.   The dart stems are pretty nice though, they feel better in your mouth than the regular stems imo, and they look pretty groovy."
lbregs,3du106,faizician,2,Sun Jul 19 16:17:19 2015 UTC,"When i first began i hit it native and with a stem to learn what I prefer. Most of the time, I think i like the stem bette now that i can hit it. At first, native was easier however and i do kinda like the natural feel.   May I ask what color you MFLB is? I'm curious as to how mixing woods look. Mine is walnut."
lbregs,3du106,iamgr3m,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:53:09 2015 UTC,"My box is a standard maple one. Mixing woods looks fine in my opinion, but wood color and grain vary enough from piece to piece that if that sort of thing is important to you finding a local head shop that sells the accessories might not be a bad idea. That way you can choose a specific one that matches your box."
lbregs,3du106,Traiectensium,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:40:18 2015 UTC,"I may look at cherry dart stem on walnut box.   None of my headshops sell them that i've seen aleast.

lbregs,3da6sy,bad_ass_motha_fucka,9,Tue Jul 14 19:55:45 2015 UTC,"in b4 someone says ""You're not smoking, you're vaping!"" ;)  Too much? I don't know... I think it's different for different people. Personally, I used to smoke/vape daily; I'm more of a weekend warrior now.  I don't think 1 to 2 trenches a day is too much as long as it's not negatively impacting your life. And I'll easily do 3 or 4 on a Saturday or Sunday!  An eighth a week isn't too bad, as long as you can afford it!. If I could afford it, I'd probably consume like a quarter a day on certain days! I know some people do like an eighth a day, no real biggie.   I am to the point where, with the mflb and how crazy well it conserves weed, my wife and I can make an eighth last like 3 weeks to a month (just vaping on the weekends... maybe a day or two during the week if work isn't too crazy).  Sorry... getting long winded here... Overall, I think whatever works for you, works for you! Experiment with different amounts/frequencies and settle on the one that serves you best!"

lbregs,3da6sy,LoneCookie,3,Sat Jul 18 23:19:41 2015 UTC,Sounds like you have your routine and you stick to it. I have a similar pattern. more like 1 a day on the week and 3-4 a day on the weekend.  I don't see that as excessive. I get £10 a g deals so I get 2g roughly lasting a week with the above describe usage.  It's certainly not excessive unless you have problems in your life caused by your use. I can't tell you that you're not vaping too much. Only you can judge that.
lbregs,3da6sy,Ressotami,2,Tue Jul 14 21:09:24 2015 UTC,"I can get about 5-6 decent 7-8 second pulls off that one trench,    Are you talking a full trench? Cause that seems really low to me. How dark is the bud when you get done vaping it?"

lbregs,3d3pyb,JesseBotwin,3,Mon Jul 13 23:44:42 2015 UTC,"I meant it for the OP, but you mentioned how it would be bad for the hands. I figured it would be worth a shot to try out the whip and remove the ring, as it would only cost a few bucks total.   Then she would just have to hold the whip and leave it on the table. I dunno if it would help, but it would be worth a try. I know someone personally with arthritis, were they have to use a straw because holding a glass is too hard for them. I figured the whip is sort of like a straw."

lbregs,3cqcsx,theaxolotlgod,3,Fri Jul 10 02:32:31 2015 UTC,"[6]  I've found that certain sativa strains (when used in moderation with respect to your own tolerance) provide a mental clarity/focus that's similar to the effects of the stimulants (although to a lesser degree). Instead of making everything shity like stimulants do you ideally will feel like you're not on them (cuz duh you aren't) but still are able to get things done.   I believe that there is a potential for any person to have their own ""best"" strain. If you're medical go try various strains and find what works for you. The strain that works the best for me is girl scout cookies. I would recommend staying  well above 60/40 S/I. I've found that the best window is between 65-75 S. Once you hit the 80s and higher the effects aren't well balanced.   If you can get different phenotypes try all of them.  Once you find a strain you need to set aside some time to learn your tolerance. Once you figure out how much you need to get to what point you're golden."

lbregs,3bhp4t,GrossItsYouAgain,4,Mon Jun 29 08:49:08 2015 UTC,"It seems like a terrible idea to me tbh.   Firstly, you would need to ensure that your stem is made from glass and not acrylic (magic flight sells both).  Secondly, due to the nature of microwave heating, I would imagine you'd end up destroying a lot of the cannabinoids. The microwave heats by exciting the atoms (from the inside out basically), and this would most likely break bonds and destroy molecules. I could be wrong though, it could be a brilliant way of harvesting. Give it a go (as long as your stem is made of glass) 😃.   If I were you I'd stand the stem up vertically on some parchment paper and blast it with a hair dryer (carefully if it's an acrylic stem), which will cause the oil to run down and collect at the bottom."
lbregs,3bhp4t,Herbalist33,2,Mon Jun 29 09:32:19 2015 UTC,"I agree with you. I think microwave heating might work (try it... for science!), but I'm guessing it's gonna be hard to control the temp and not lose product.   I think the hairdryer idea is a good one!"
lbregs,3bhp4t,ForScale,1 point,Mon Jun 29 12:51:21 2015 UTC,"You know the ABV containers magic flight sell, can they be used for the oil?  As they do sell them with the replacement screens?"
lbregs,3bhp4t,Bathingintacos,3,Mon Jun 29 09:40:21 2015 UTC,"You can use the ABV containers but you'll be much happier with an ""oilslick"" or ""no-goo"" containers, look it up. It might cost a bit more, but with those containers you never lose a drop of oil like you would in the plastic ABV containers, where a lot of the oil sticks to the bottom. And then it's tempting to scrape it off and you get little bits of plastic with the oil..."
lbregs,3bhp4t,defsubsucks,1 point,Mon Jun 29 13:00:26 2015 UTC,I don't think a hair dryer would put out enough heat. Probably would need to use a heat gun..
lbregs,3bhp4t,slo_rider,1 point,Mon Jun 29 17:29:27 2015 UTC,I wouldn't use the microwave to try to harvest the oil.   Microwaves (the appliance) work due to how microwaves (the electromagnetic waves) interact with water molecules in whatever you're heating. There shouldn't be a lot of water molecules in the oil in your stem so you might just be doing nothing by putting the stem in the microwave.   You could try using the vertical stem method idea with any other heating method (I believe I read using a hair drier ITT) because they just apply heat to the stem (microwaves don't work this way).   Hope this helped!

lbregs,3bdbzl,happyself,1 point,Fri Jul 3 20:53:27 2015 UTC,I had a hard time doing it the first time I tried back when I still had a glass stem.  The one thing I did differently this time was heat up the stem before pushing the nug through.  I just held the stem over some boiling water for a minute or so and then the nug slid right through!  You could use a hairdryer too; that would probably work even better.

lbregs,3aznzu,FusionNebula,7,Wed Jun 24 20:07:25 2015 UTC,"One of my favorite aspects of using the MFLB is that it's so easy to control my dose.   Should I span out my tokes? Take one toke every 10-15 minutes instead of everything at once?   Definitely! It takes a few minutes to really feel the full effect of every hit you take, so taking slightly longer breaks between them would definitely help out. Also, spending some time actually doing things between hits will help you realize that you might be higher after 3-4 hits than it first seems. With the MFLB, you can also take smaller hits by drawing less and more quickly to really titrate your dose.   How come can a trench (0.1-0.2g) of weed get me this high? I usually smoked a whole joint of 1G and felt superb, how can 5 tokes from a small trench kill my ass?   Vaping is much, much more efficient than smoking. When vaping, you get to inhale a much higher percentage of the available THC in the material than you would with smoking, so you end up needing a much smaller amount to get as high.   Also, how is your memory guys? Do any of you feel a decline in cognitive function after smoking more often with portable vapes and such? Does cannabis affect your daily functioning?   I haven't noticed any unusual negative consequences of using my MFLB daily, sometimes grogginess and haziness carries over to the next morning but that's pretty usual for weed in general.  As for your sleepiness during the high, it might just be down to the weed you've got. An indica strain might couchlock you much more than a sativa or hybrid.  A lot of people seem to testify that vaping gives a much 'cleaner' high than smoking. What this means is that some of the effects you're looking for are slightly different when vaping, so the metric you're using to gauge how high you are might not be 'calibrated', so to speak. You might be looking for an effect you're used to after smoking the amount you consider comfortable that doesn't really show itself as prominently with the MFLB, and vaping more, when in reality you're pretty dang high and vaping more brings you to a couchlock state.  I'm sorry that I'm speculating so much, but that's all the things I can think of! Just trying to brainstorm some answers and hope to bring you closer to some solutions. I hope it helps!"
lbregs,3aznzu,Beremat,2,Wed Jun 24 22:26:31 2015 UTC,"Excellent response, I agree that the haziness is minute"
lbregs,3aznzu,Wispofnothing,2,Wed Jun 24 23:02:20 2015 UTC,"spending some time actually doing things between hits will help you realize that you might be higher after 3-4 hits than it first seems.   Good point. I am used smoking weed the old way (joints), where you would just take it all down and wait for the effects.    Vaping is much, much more efficient than smoking.    Sure, but I read an article (http://www.medicaljane.com/2014/07/15/massachusetts-lab-investigates-how-to-dose-yourself-when-vaporizing-cannabis/), where they concluded that you get aproximately ~0.3mg of THC per hit, if I got that correctly. Wouldn't that still make me need to take at least 10 hits to get to 3mg+? How many mg does it in reality take to get high as fuck [7+].   No problem, you brainstorm away! I want to learn as much as I can about this thing :D"
lbregs,3aznzu,Bristlebot,2,Thu Jun 25 07:59:37 2015 UTC,"Ok, to start off-  If you're unhappy with your results, don't be turned away! There are limitless combinations of ways to use the box. Like /u/Beremat recommended, spacing out the hits is always a good option. Also, try packing your trench with a little less than you normally do, that way if you take 2 hits and feel OK, taking a 3rd won't knock you out :)  Also, your headaches might be able to be helped! Try taking slower but cooler draws, with more time in between each one. I find that if I go too hard too fast I will experience a slight pressure in my head. The sleepiness may be a factor resulting from a number of sources, one of course being the weed you're using. Also, if you're hitting the box at a higher temperature, that could also be a reason. It's 99% probably your cannabis though :)  The haziness, at least from my experience, isn't becuase of the vaporisation but rather the weed. I notice sometimes that in the morning to mid day I might be a little groggy, but nothing to be alarmed over. It's natural, it happens.  Have fun, and let me know if I can help with any other things!! :D"
lbregs,3aznzu,Beremat,2,Thu Jun 25 00:23:05 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, I forgot, packing smaller trenches is also a really great idea to help control your dose! It won't harm the box or anything, just be aware that the weed will warm up and combust quicker, too."

My Android is not the top model phone and as a result it is slow and unpredictable from time to time.

lbregs,3af10p,Ressotami,2,Sat Jun 20 08:54:33 2015 UTC,Not that I don't love smoking every now and again. But the burned taste always makes me cringe. Once you've had that green taste out of the box. It's so hard to smoke knowing that you're gonna get an ashy taste rather than the true herby goodness.   Happiness is a full trench and a freshly charged glyph.  I highly recommend the PA set on the lowest setting. You can hold the button in for a long time and it won't combust.  What it will do is make your flavour really last.  It's a great way to start off. Then once the flavour fades you can start to crank it up.

lbregs,3aftjo,mflbninja,6,Sat Jun 20 23:01:36 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry to hear it was all lost. My personal stance is that unless you cannot use the Launch Box, you should. It is the best long-term investment you could ever make in a vaporizer. It will last forever as long as you keep it safe, and give you the kind of hit you want every time. It does take more attention to use but you said you did not mind the learning curve, so I think getting perfect clouds from the LB will become second nature to you if it hasn't already.  As for using it with friends, have you ever tried stacking hits into a third lung or large bong? Yes, this does effectively make you the hit loader, but it ensures a giant hit for everyone without any teaching or breakage risk. Plus if you've never tried that before, it's awesome. You can see the vapor as it's forming, which is one form of temperature regulation that allows you to get exactly the consistency you want - the other is using native mode, feeling the temperature after it expands in a cooling chamber formed by the mouth.  But only you need to know this, since with a third lung you now have a manual Volcano. Stack those hits in there 10 at a time for a good third lung hit, or up it to 20 to increase smoothness or potency depending on how hot you're running it. Just keep dealing them out until your friends call it quits, and they'll be looking on your wooden toy block in a whole new light."

However my uses for all three are different.   My pax is for when I'm out and about and need to be stealthy.   My mflb is my go too. I like turning the pa low and sucking a trench or two allllllll night.   My plenty is for when I want those hits that feel like a bong hit. The plenty is an awesome vape. Efficient as fuck and never combusts. I've heard from people who have the crafty and the plenty and the say they hit the same.   My point is they are all great vapes. Choose where your moolah goes by whichever situation you want to achieve when you administer.   Ps. Look into the mighty if you are leaning in that direction as I hear the battery life on the crafty can be poor for large sessions.   Pps. The crafty is bookmarked for when my pax packs in."

lbregs,3aftjo,sgtsuicide82,1 point,Fri Jun 19 21:43:49 2015 UTC,"Hey, don't know if you're still watching this post, but thought I'd weigh in. Daily MFLB user turned Pax as of 3 months ago. I used batteries solely, and would run as little herb as would cover the bottom of the MFLB through a homemade water pipe many many times daily. I loved the versatility of the flight, and still do. I use the box now when I'm looking for a really small amount of medication, or if I want to absorb it slowly. I use the pax almost always nowadays, and mind you the PAX 1. I use two rolled up pipe screens (actually it's mesh for vaporizer I ordered on Amazon) and pack as little herb as will cover the screen. Vape on medium, as high temp makes it harder to clean. It always hits like a truck even native, I have adapted a water pipe and use that 80% of the time for thick and smooth clouds from even a pinch of herb. The pax noticeably uses more herb, not much but I notice it especially with small doses. I suspect this is the heat up and cool down time. To me the pax is like a joint, in how it hits and how it uses so much herb and how it smells up the entire room just hearing up. The MFLB is instant and way more efficient because of it. The MFLB is kind of a bitch to get heated up enough to roast a trench within 15 minutes though with batteries. The pax will also break if you don't clean it. Run a pipe cleaner through it and ISO soak the mouth piece and oven screen every 10 loads or so and you will be golden. The pax is super durable and performs like a champ daily for me, while the flight batteries leave me sipping wisps of vapor all day. Still, every morning I have 4 charged flight batteries and the fully charged pax and that setup seems to be working the best. My honest opinion, two totally different vapes"

lbregs,3aagfq,mflb_feeling_free,2,Thu Jun 18 14:46:10 2015 UTC,i vape hybrids and the mflb has been working great for me
lbregs,3aagfq,SeraldoBabalu,1 point,Thu Jun 18 15:29:11 2015 UTC,"Do you ever get a body high, a lot of people say you can only get a head high b/c the mflb temps are too low."
lbregs,3aagfq,SeraldoBabalu,6,Thu Jun 18 15:34:13 2015 UTC,i get both. i start chatting like crazy then about 1-2 hours later i start getting sleepy depending on the strain.
lbregs,3aagfq,SeraldoBabalu,1 point,Thu Jun 18 15:36:48 2015 UTC,Is this off of one trench? Also how many trenches do you vape thru week/day?
lbregs,3aagfq,ExPwN,1 point,Thu Jun 18 15:38:04 2015 UTC,one trench will last me 2 sessions and i probably go through 3 trenches in a week.. i use a pax when i'm out and use the mflb when i'm home so it might be why i don't use my lauchbox as much as many other ents. also sprinkle in a joint here and there.
lbregs,3aagfq,ExPwN,1 point,Thu Jun 18 15:45:02 2015 UTC,Would you say you have a high or medium tolerance? And how high would you get off of half a trench on the 1-10 scale?
lbregs,3aagfq,SeraldoBabalu,1 point,Thu Jun 18 15:48:01 2015 UTC,I can answer this for me. Off one full trench I can get from a 5-9 depending on a lot of different factors. Half a trench can get me anywhere from a 4-7. I have a pretty average tolerance from smoking/vaping daily
lbregs,3aagfq,ForScale,1 point,Thu Jun 18 18:38:33 2015 UTC,"Im a daily vaper just like you, yet a full trench only gets me to a 3. I guess it is my technique. Do you use a power adapter?"
lbregs,3aagfq,ForScale,1 point,Thu Jun 18 19:58:34 2015 UTC,I have one but I don't use it that frequently unless I'm revaping AVB. Have you tried the 666 method?
lbregs,3aagfq,SP120K,1 point,Fri Jun 19 01:39:53 2015 UTC,Why don't you use it that frequently? Mobility I assume. And yes I've tried it one before.
lbregs,3aagfq,SP120K,1 point,Fri Jun 19 04:37:29 2015 UTC,I'm a medium tolerance if I had to guess. I can get to the point where I feel like there's bits of time missing from about 10-12 good hits from the box.
lbregs,3aagfq,SP120K,3,Thu Jun 18 19:06:46 2015 UTC,"Dude... mflb can combust weed. It should be able to handle any dry, finely ground weed you throw in there.  If you're really trying to get it all... just take it to black. Don't combust it, but vape it till it's dark brown/black. It's what I usually do and I never give consideration to indica/sativa. And it all gets me good and stoned!"
lbregs,3aagfq,WoodyWeedpecker,2,Thu Jun 18 16:38:21 2015 UTC,"Awesome, I'm just gonna get what strains I like and vape it dark. Do you still utilize your avb even when you vape it really dark?"
lbregs,3aagfq,WoodyWeedpecker,1 point,Thu Jun 18 17:01:49 2015 UTC,"Sounds like a plan!  Yep, I throw it in a bag and it just gets mixed in with all the other AVB. Overall the whole of the stuff is a brown color. Kind of looks like dark, finely ground tobacco. I've use it to make edibles, fill bowls/joints, and to make oil/wax. Does the trick!"
lbregs,3aagfq,ForScale,1 point,Thu Jun 18 17:19:33 2015 UTC,what I did was made capsules with my ABV.. take a couple of those and call it a DAY!
lbregs,3aagfq,ForScale,1 point,Fri Jun 19 00:00:02 2015 UTC,Damn that is getting me really excited of the possibilities. Where do you get these capsules.
lbregs,3aagfq,SP120K,1 point,Fri Jun 19 04:40:20 2015 UTC,I think you can buy them but I use the emptied out capsules from my Valerian root extract capsules. The Valerian root powder I just make into a tea so I'm left with the capsules.
lbregs,3aagfq,happyself,1 point,Fri Jun 19 18:04:30 2015 UTC,Alright thanks.
lbregs,3aagfq,ForScale,2,Fri Jun 19 23:45:48 2015 UTC,The MFLB can combust if you're not careful on your draw rate and speed. So wouldn't it be safe to say you can release the full profile of CBDs. I feel mainly a head high but body high is there too especially when I'm on the darker end of a trench and use a fresh Glyph battery. You control the temp.
lbregs,3aagfq,KurroTheCat,2,Thu Jun 18 15:58:51 2015 UTC,What are the best batteries to buy? I have stock batts.
lbregs,3a8e1s,GeeBeats,6,Thu Jun 18 01:10:03 2015 UTC,The grind isn't too fine until it falls through the screen.. If that happens I'd like to know how
lbregs,3a8e1s,Groosed,3,Thu Jun 18 13:06:12 2015 UTC,Looks fine to me.
lbregs,3a8e1s,ForScale,2,Thu Jun 18 12:57:50 2015 UTC,Just right :) how did you achieve such a fine grind?
lbregs,3a8e1s,grasbergerm,3,Thu Jun 18 04:20:07 2015 UTC,"Finishing grinder, most likely. Excellent accessory for the MFLB!"
lbregs,3a8e1s,cavefishes,1 point,Thu Jun 18 06:57:53 2015 UTC,I take half a tea ball and a wine cork and push/grind it though the screen.  It is a horrible possess but it works for me and I'm happy with the results
lbregs,3a8e1s,slo_rider,1 point,Thu Jun 18 21:54:59 2015 UTC,"Dude, get the finishing grinder if you have $30. It adds such a nice touch to the box."

lbregs,3a6ig6,Arcade_City,1 point,Wed Jun 17 18:50:16 2015 UTC,Pushing your bud through a mesh kitchen strainer with a cork is the easiest way to get this fine of a grind. It all looks like kief every time.
lbregs,3a6ig6,Arcade_City,1 point,Thu Jun 18 02:16:23 2015 UTC,Like just rub it through with a wine cork?
lbregs,3a6ig6,Arcade_City,1 point,Thu Jun 18 15:59:39 2015 UTC,"Yup. I got it from an older post on r/mflb and it works miracles. Just as fine as the finishing grinder (actually maybe a bit more). It works better if you already grind or at least break up the bud beforehand, then dump it into the strainer and push it through. After a few minutes of doing this all that will be left in the strainer will be pieces of stem, the rest will be like powder."

I know you get it all the time, but you guys rock. Please, keep up the awesomeness.  PS, I'm writing a comprehensive guide to the Launch Box and Muad-Dib with the help of the reddit community. It is in the editing and proofreading stage now and I expect it to be finished within a few months. I hope to use it to combat the misinformation that seems to spread especially about the LB when people become frustrated when they don't know how to use it. The Flight Guide is a good start, but I hope this supplementary guide can get the wheels turning in people's heads about how great the LB truly is."

There's only so much we can fit into our Flight Guide before it becomes overwhelming for the average user, so it's great to see a comprehensive addendum in the works. Keep us posted, and a sincere thank you for the effort you and the community have put into it.

lbregs,39xlx2,rlaitinen,3,Tue Jun 16 02:20:06 2015 UTC,"All of my (admittedly few) dealings with him have been fine. Personally, I think it's impressive what he does. Whereas in most subs the mods and regulars get frustrated by the newb rush of asking the same questions, here we have a sub just for that phenomena. One which was started by and is maintained solely by one person, who not only doesn't discourage new lb owners from asking the same questions, but asks them to make multiple posts. Which is actually pretty smart because then they're more easily searchable.    For a sub that ""is a help and information sub geared towards new users"", I think I_Submit_This does a fine job. I think that his quirks are more than offset by the fact he keeps a clean sub that is very on point and keeps all of the ""Will the Warrenty Cover..."" posts from cluttering up r/lbregs"

lbregs,39xlx2,Ressotami,4,Tue Jun 16 03:21:41 2015 UTC,This whole thread is awesome. Thanks to OP and everyone who voiced their concerns. Thanks also to Ol' Dude and the regulars of /r/mflb for explaining the dynamics of the situation in a totally civil and cool way. Let this stand as a positive example of how to use this sub to clear misunderstandings as well as just be more free and post what ya want. Would upvote thread twice if possible and tempted to sticky it.
lbregs,39xlx2,I_Submit_This,8,Wed Jun 17 00:52:02 2015 UTC,"I think that the sort of person who vocally decides not to purchase a MFLB because of a reddit user was probably not going to buy one anyway.   I mean seriously. Why would the mood or tone of a reddit user change your mind about a functional object? It doesn't make sense. People who say it have a personal grudge against I_S_T and are trying to make out that their grudge is losing Magic Flight money in the hopes that the company act to curtail ""lost revenue"". It's basically a lot of noise with the goal of getting I_S_T removed. It's all a bit of a witch hunt if you ask me.  But let's be honest. If the behaviour of a user on a sub-reddit makes you despise a physical product....you're judging on the wrong criteria. Letting personal issues cloud your judgement. The behaviour of reddit mods in no way affects the MFLB as a vape.   As for a vote on the rules. It isn't going to happen because the rules that the community would vote for are far too loose for the sub. I can see it now. ""We want off topic posts allowed"" ""We want memes and glamour shots"". LBregs was created to fill that niche and it's doing pretty well at the job. I do however think that one day we might get a fellow mod with I_S_T. It would really help if the mod decisions weren't unilateral. I think the perception is that if one person makes all the decisions, you can fall prey to personal bias or just a personal dislike.  When the mods here delete something, we often start a mod thread to discuss the removal and check that we agree. This really helps with the checks and balances of the sub and I can guarantee that any big decisions made on this sub have passed with a majority mod vote."
lbregs,39xlx2,mflbninja,-1,Mon Jun 15 19:43:25 2015 UTC,"Why would the mood or tone of a reddit user change your mind about a functional object?   If you're new and you ask a simple question about something and get totally reamed out by some asshole, you're going to stop considering that product. It's human nature. Go to a perfectly good restaurant 3 times and just have the bad luck to get the shitty waitress that got fired 5 minutes after you left and you will probably never go back there.   edit: you can say they're basing their decision on the wrong criteria, but that's an overly logical assessment. Most people make decisions based on emotions, this has been proven by science. (you can google source, but it was posted on reddit about a year ago too.) When IST goes around pissing everyone off he is hurting sales, because none of those people will feel good about MF anything because of that experience.   Sadly, now, myself included. Flowermate is the new sub $100 recommendation."

lbregs,39xlx2,Ressotami,2,Wed Jun 17 21:59:20 2015 UTC,"But that's exactly the point. /r/MFLB isn't supposed to allow glamour shots or those kind of posts. It's a strictly informational sub. So unless you're going to post information (i.e. where to buy one) then it's just a front page full of grinder pics.   The rules are strict but clearly posted. How can it be considered a reaming if you post, willfully ignoring rules, and you have your post edited, removed or moved by a mod? It happens all over the web on ANY internet forum and people get upset all the time there as well. It doesn't make it somehow the rise of the third reich.   You can argue that the rule should be changed but arguably the quality of submissions on the sub would drop dramatically. It was never meant to be competing with /r/trees and to be honest. I don't know if I want it to be another /r/trees. I kinda like it the way it is.  So either follow the rules on the internet board that you chose to subscribe to....or don't and unsubscribe or get posts deleted. This is not new on the internet. It has always been this way."

Nothing to do with glamour shots there.   They're not ""clearly posted"". You can say ""authorized distributor"" but that is a meaningless statement unless there's a list of ""authorized distributors"". Which there is not.

lbregs,39xlx2,ADHDABE,1 point,Wed Jun 17 22:13:55 2015 UTC,"Well you can enjoy the solution then. Here it is, in the form of a subreddit. It's a democratically-run sandbox for all kinds of fun. It's essentially the polar opposite of /r/mflb, except that both subs are centered around the Launch Box. If you don't like that sub and the way it is moderated, this place is here for you.  So why don't you just set up camp here and be happy? /r/mflb is a place where neophytes to the way of the Launch Box can ask their painfully repetitive questions. We just happen to be so lucky to have a place where all that shit is excluded.  So let's kick back and enjoy it eh? Look at this gallery of wonderful submissions. You didn't even have to sort through questions to find it, you're already looking at it when you load the sub. All those annoying inquiries that could have been solved with a search, gone without issue.  Regarding the way people are responded to in /r/mflb, the fact is that no one is going to use the search bar, they want to post questions instead. IST is there to give quick answers and direct people where they should be. We should be grateful he so readily takes on this arduous, humdrum task when we have the privilege of moderating such a laid-back, fun subreddit. And we are."

lbregs,39xlx2,Ressotami,-2,Mon Jun 15 17:03:48 2015 UTC,"this one  As long as it's official Magic Flight gear I want people to be able to get it at the best price possible. Now, if they decide to pay a bit more to buy from a store with superb customer service or something that is a choice they should have to make. I just want them to have the CHOICE!  If I wanna link to Massdrop or Ebay or some random Website that got a 1k stock and is selling really good kits, like Puffitup, I should be able to."
lbregs,39xlx2,mflbninja,6,Tue Jun 16 02:35:26 2015 UTC,Mass drop are not getting their kits from Magic Flight. They are below MSRP and Magic Flight have said that sellers that fall into this category may not be eligible for a warranty.   You can still warranty through massdrop usually but I think the rule makes sense as people expect a warranty direct from magic flight.  It would be wrong to post links that might lead to warranty complications further down the line due to bad information.
lbregs,39xlx2,Ressotami,-2,Tue Jun 16 05:45:16 2015 UTC,"Another commenter provided sauce.  I didn't know that before, I figured the only place you even could get that many MF products was from MF. So I guess Massdrop isn't an official distributor.  However, in that SAME post Magic Flight says: ""As long as your Launch Box has a serial number and you communicate with us with truth and integrity, your Launch Box will be covered under our lifetime functional warranty regardless of where you acquired it.""  So that is really what I think we should be focusing on."

lbregs,39xlx2,I_Submit_This,2,Mon Jun 15 17:44:02 2015 UTC,"Which is not, AT ALL, what I said. Nor is anything even close to that anywhere in the post.  Why do you think this is in lbregs? The seasoned users of that sub? It should be obvious.  Look, dictatorships are bad. Can we agree on that?  Everyone and their mom shouldn't make rules for the sub. But the rules shouldn't exist if they're hurting the community. The community should be able to get stupid harmful rules removed."

Without specifics you're suggesting a complete over haul which is unrealistic and unreasonable. The rules exist as they are because it is an informative sub. As the only listed reddit in the mflb instruction manual, it has a special role. MF has discussions with IST and if they were unhappy with how it was run I doubt they would send every person who reads the book there. Heck it's even listed on their site. Without stating your grievance you're basically telling MF that they don't know what's best for them."

lbregs,39xlx2,loopbedoop,4,Tue Jun 16 02:41:47 2015 UTC,"But if the rules don't change, having more mods will only make the rules more enforced.

I only say this because unless they issue a statement any ""statement"" claimed by any person could be called into question.   Understand I'm simply playing the devil's advocate."

You said you contacted them about it, what? the mod situation on the sub? What did you contact them saying? What was the general idea of what they replied back? What sort of indication were they giving?  I only ask because Magic Flight have historically been quite fond of I_S_T flying solo.

lbregs,39v3pp,dormvaped,3,Mon Jun 15 01:21:43 2015 UTC,"The thing about a vaporizer, which it seems like you understand, is that it mainly releases the THC from the herb. This results in more of a head high for most people, even with more indica heavy strains.   However, one of the greatest things about the MFLB is the fact that it generates AVB, which is essentially decarbed bud. This means it is packed full of the CBD's that give people a body high and might be a solution for your pain problems. I highly recommend doing a search for AVB on r/mflb to see if you can find a good way to dose it medically. I know /u/I_Submit_This (the admin of mflb) does a lot of things with AVB, I'm sure he could help you out more with this topic.   Good luck with your ailments friend, I hope you can find some relief soon."
lbregs,39v3pp,EnderGraff,1 point,Mon Jun 15 01:42:39 2015 UTC,"I'm a huge HUGE fan of AVB! I used it every two weeks when my consumption was up at school, though I never could get the dose right and I always ended up, for lack of a better phrase, 'fucked up'. It was not a manageable bake, honestly, but I was medicated, that's for sure. I can't really afford to be going through that much herb though, and since I've been home I've been running out herb fairly frequently so I can't save AVB very well. Honestly, that would be the best option though. That, or if I could manage it, just straight up edibles. Those are my favorite method of medicating. I used medicate liberally, however- I have found the recreational benefits are great as well ;)"

Stacking hits helps prevent combustion problem if you do it properly, and delivers hits like a full-size desktop vaporizer.  Also, ABV is really good for pain relief, as it's loaded with CBD. Experiment with it, because I'd say 2 in 4 people get significantly higher from eating it, 1 in 4 gets significantly higher from smoking it, and 1 in 4 feel about equal effects."

I aim to keep my tolerance down. ;)  I have been smoking daily in 30+ years so my brain is pretty familiar with the effect, so even with small dosages it knows how to react. :D  I made the transition to vaping and the MFLB 4-5 months back and never looked back. Right now I'm vaping 1 gram a week which gives me 15-20 small trench loads (0.07-0.04 g per trench). The trench on the photo is the second of the day and therefore a little smaller than the first one. Just needed a little extra buzz.  Last year I couldn't grow, so I have been living on frozen goods from 2012 and 2013. During the last month the jars have been very close to empty, so the Launch Box has really been a life saver for me.  In a couple of weeks I'll start to harvest and I bet trench size will slowly grow again, but I can't really see them getting over much more than 0.1 grams, as I also try to keep tolerance rather low in the good times."

lbregs,39alna,I_Submit_This,5,Wed Jun 10 13:18:31 2015 UTC,"Ah jeez guys. scratches head  All right then, here's the problem with below-MSRP pricing. The problem is that your lifetime warranty is placed under excessive risk - in other words, your claim may or may not be honored at Magic-Flight's discretion, whereas with a full-priced purchase you know that your warranty really is for life.  Right now this sub's traffic is such that this type of thing can be discussed, because it still functions as a sort of lounge for the regulars of /r/mflb, which is the namesake of this sub and the initial reason for its creation. Indeed it is to this day a way for for the experts to get together and be known.  However, it was not long after I started the sub before I asked the populace at the time what the sub should shape up to be, and the answer was quite solid: a ""looser"" version of /r/mflb which allowed to be seen those posts that do not meet the criteria for the type of informational post normally seen there.  A big reason /r/mflb is under the kind of moderation IST doles out is protection of the consumer and the company. Though it is likely a warranty claim would still be honored today even if it was bought below MSRP, provided it is honest and written with good intentions, there's no telling what they could do tomorrow.  I personally am interested in protecting the consumer and company, as well. So if it becomes clear to me that, for example, warranties are being placed in excessive risk because people went into it without knowing the details, I will vote in the direction of more rules.  This sub is run democratically, though, so no changes would happen without a majority vote from the other moderators - which I thought might also be a good experiment, besides the fact that I am unable to show the dedication IST does to /r/mflb.  I hope accusations of corruption over a few well-deserved gifts are put to rest, and we can all realize that he is acting in the best interest of the sub. Let's all take a deep breath and chill out right about now. It's free to post on reddit, and if it is removed by a mod, you can have it back up in under a minute, with a handy copy-paste and an edit or two.  It's been a good ride so far and now with the support of /r/mflb we will be seeing new traffic. We need the two subs to support each other, and to refer Q&A posts in here to /r/mflb, and in there, refer photo- and story-sharing posts back here. Show a little love and let the good times roll.

As an added tip, wrapping your box in a clear plastic bag and pushing the stem through the bag in the right place will make your box splash proof at the expense of looking rather silly.  Means you can handle with wet hands without worrying. Obviously battery can be engaged with no problems through the bag and as long as it is clear, you can also monitor the colour of your trench."

Good flavour (really woody and smooth)  Matching colour (Or mix and match)  Wedged end so it sits in boxes that are usually quite loose with glass.  Cons:  I think a bit pricey Less reclaim available as the wood absorbs some and gets sticky.   More difficult to cleanly harvest.  Less (no) reclaim visible as wood is opaque.  The wide end means you cannot connect a whip to the other end. I know this is the mouth piece, but normal stems work as couplers and joiners too. This wooden stem needs to be used as a mouthpiece."

lbregs,38yn7w,Ressotami,1 point,Wed Jun 10 17:54:50 2015 UTC,i dipped and stirred my stem in a hot latte. I felt a little high but didn't get me past a [2]. Maybe I should wait for more of a buildup? what method do you suggest to consume it? concentrate tray?
lbregs,38yn7w,anon99161,2,Wed Jun 10 18:49:28 2015 UTC,"I gave you my most effective way - smoked on a bowl of green.   Crumble your herb and then blob the oil on top. It will melt down into the herb and you'll be able to smoke the bowl with a massive extra punch.  Concentrate trays are a more healthy way of consuming the oil as it is vaporisation without the smoke. But let's be honest. With the reclaimed oil. inhaling will always out-rank eating in terms of sudden onset and efficiency.  When you eat it, you get a much longer peak but a slower onset and it takes more to have a pronounced effect. If you have the oil to fund this method, it's great. But if you are trying to make a little  tiny re-claim blob go the extra mile, then you need to probably hit a concentrate tray or just straight smoke it on a bowl. It will allow you to feel it at least.  You can drink or eat a whole stem of oil and be disappointed with the results. The best experience I have had with drinking/eating have been when I made milk with all my stems, whips and glass pieces from my set up. That was a great day. But when I drink a stem on its own.....I don't feel it is worth it."
lbregs,38yn7w,Ressotami,1 point,Wed Jun 10 18:54:11 2015 UTC,"Wow, thanks for the detailed methods. I began cleaning my stem with a cue tip and iso and throwing it away (don't get sad I_submit_this), since I didn't like the taste and I barley got high from it. In my mind, it was less of a hassle just throwing it away because I felt that the benefits (taste, high) were over glorified. However, I have never smoked it in a bowl. I smoke with friends, and vape usually with my roommate. Ill try your method and save up my honey oil and smoke it and make a post about in in this sub :). Thanks."
lbregs,38yn7w,anon99161,2,Wed Jun 10 19:25:53 2015 UTC,"Dab it! Get a torch and dabbing rig - about $50 can get you a good nail and glass. Or purchase the Muad-Dib from the Connoisseurs Club for $119, and enjoy ease of use, style, and accessory compatibility. There's a $5 solution as well, involving a torch and an ""incense burner"" from certain convenience stores - these are meth pipes indeed.

lbregs,38v21s,frommaplesteeze,4,Sun Jun 7 04:04:44 2015 UTC,Sick I'm buying some Spider-Man stickers tomorrow
lbregs,38v21s,mflbninja,3,Sun Jun 7 05:07:13 2015 UTC,Here's the full lineup: http://i.imgur.com/6VUMaaV.jpg
lbregs,38v21s,TheAtomicOwl,6,Sun Jun 7 06:39:25 2015 UTC,Holy shit that hulk face [7]
lbregs,38v21s,I_Submit_This,2,Sun Jun 7 15:17:09 2015 UTC,That Wolverine face too. Way too friendly.
lbregs,38v21s,I_Submit_This,3,Wed Jun 10 20:43:48 2015 UTC,Is... Is that stem black?
lbregs,38v21s,I_Submit_This,2,Sun Jun 7 21:54:29 2015 UTC,Black with honey ....
lbregs,38v21s,I_Submit_This,5,Sun Jun 7 22:28:24 2015 UTC,big difference between pic 1 and pic 2.
lbregs,38v21s,TheAtomicOwl,2,Sun Jun 7 23:48:53 2015 UTC,Ya I've been doing good with patience
lbregs,38v21s,CausersOfThis,2,Sun Jun 7 23:54:37 2015 UTC,"what's the interval in between, and how much of what went through in that time."
lbregs,38v21s,TheAtomicOwl,2,Mon Jun 8 02:49:32 2015 UTC,The initial pic was taken on 4/3 and the second was 6/6 so we're talking just over 2 months.  Not really sure the amount but I'd guess around 25g.
lbregs,38v21s,I_Submit_This,1 point,Mon Jun 8 05:58:59 2015 UTC,one more Q ... real Quick ... how sticky was that ickie-stickie?
lbregs,38v21s,TheAtomicOwl,2,Mon Jun 8 06:00:54 2015 UTC,"Well, there was some dabs mixed in there but mostly just middle of the road beesters... some girl scout cookies and sour diesel too"
lbregs,38v21s,I_Submit_This,3,Mon Jun 8 06:03:05 2015 UTC,"thanks. this is good reference info for others, and i wouldn't object (at all), if you made a submission about this. nothing much more than the pics and what you just told me ... just give it a good, easily searched title.  ~8^)      EDIT: WHOOPSIE!! ... just realized this was lbregs.   ~8^)    ... you could also post that submission over at r/mflb. LOL"
lbregs,38v21s,TheAtomicOwl,3,Mon Jun 8 06:07:02 2015 UTC,That's amazing. Unless your tolerance is like 100x mine aren't you going to be wrecked for days? Also does it not taste foul of oil?
lbregs,38v21s,TheAtomicOwl,3,Mon Jun 8 00:58:25 2015 UTC,"FOUL of oil?! Kind sir or ma'am, that oil is quite delish, and smells hella dank. There is nothing ""foul"" with regards to the oil of which we speak."
lbregs,38v21s,I_Submit_This,2,Mon Jun 8 05:02:41 2015 UTC,"They call it honey for a reason ;)  Tastes so sweet, and the added slight draw resistance from the reduction in diameter of the stem is an advantage to me personally, that's why I'm hesitant to harvest.  I have some good concentrates as of now so I mean, I'll be wrecked, but maybe not for days."
lbregs,38v21s,TheAtomicOwl,1 point,Mon Jun 8 05:53:45 2015 UTC,"I split my two stems between three people. One was bad the other only used maybe 2 weeks. I had a 9 hour high then a fast crash. Roommate who has been a stoner for 3-4 years (I've only vaped since September) was a good[10] for about ten hours. My girlfriend figured out no more edibles. Didn't feel it more than a buzz, crashed 5 hours later, slept for 15 hours.  Pictures of how weak they were compared to OP in my post history. If you feel like rooting around in it."
lbregs,38v21s,I_Submit_This,1 point,Mon Jun 8 06:04:12 2015 UTC,Pictures of how weak they were compared to OP in my post history   be a GGG and post that link ... you know when it was posted.
lbregs,38v3cm,Bristlebot,2,Sun Jun 7 02:09:18 2015 UTC,"It looks like the stem was removed from a whip. The whips have a shorter glass stem, and they are easy to remove from the whip tubing."
lbregs,38v3cm,maxeeman111,2,Sun Jun 7 06:09:54 2015 UTC,"Actually, back when I first got my box i was shaking it after a hit and the stem fell out and broke into two pieces, what you see here is the shorter piece. I actually kind of like this size better since I still get the functionality of the stem (to a point) but it hides better!"
lbregs,38v3cm,beanieboy11,1 point,Sun Jun 7 17:12:38 2015 UTC,What did you do to your stem
lbregs,38v3cm,IAmAMustardAMA,1 point,Sun Jun 7 05:53:55 2015 UTC,I love using vaping as an excuse to be outside. It makes it so much more of a rewarding experience!
lbregs,38v3cm,Ressotami,2,Sun Jun 7 17:34:37 2015 UTC,remember dude.....herbs grow outside....  It's like....  you're taking.....  them home....  Don't you want them to go home Mustard?
lbregs,38v3cm,I_Submit_This,1 point,Mon Jun 8 16:26:29 2015 UTC,"why do you need an ""excuse"" just to go outside?"
lbregs,38v3cm,IAmAMustardAMA,3,Sun Jun 7 23:51:14 2015 UTC,"I guess ""excuse"" was a poor choice of words, but it gets me up and going!"
lbregs,38v3cm,I_Submit_This,2,Mon Jun 8 00:31:31 2015 UTC,"whatever gets you outside, is a good thing.  ~8^)"
lbregs,38t8ws,CombustionGFX,5,Sat Jun 6 16:52:38 2015 UTC,"Should give you a lil buzzy buzz. Whenever mines empty I sometimes just push in the battery to see if I'll get anything and some vapor appears, I think from oil under the screen"
lbregs,38t8ws,IAmAMustardAMA,6,Sat Jun 6 16:59:30 2015 UTC,"Yeah i'm pretty buzzed right now, probably the same after 2 - 3 hits. I used a fresh batt so my box is literally so hot it could burn you!!"
lbregs,38t8ws,ForScale,1 point,Sat Jun 6 17:03:56 2015 UTC,Should work!
lbregs,38t8ws,Moreburrtitos22,1 point,Sat Jun 6 21:42:35 2015 UTC,Try hitting it upside down
lbregs,38t8ws,ParsInterarticularis,9,Sun Jun 7 00:28:13 2015 UTC,"All that blood rushing to the head has to help, right? .... :)"
lbregs,38t8ws,Moreburrtitos22,1 point,Sun Jun 7 04:30:34 2015 UTC,I meant the box but yeah I bet you'll feel it a little more if you invert yourself too
lbregs,38t8ws,heeltoehero92,1 point,Sun Jun 7 09:15:51 2015 UTC,Directions unclear: hit the box whilst upside down. It broke.
lbregs,38t8ws,unique_username_384,1 point,Mon Jun 22 04:51:48 2015 UTC,"If you have a power adaptor, turn it up to 100%, let the box get stupidly hot and draw slowly through either a whip, or a bubbler.  I probably do this about once every half ounce and the sheer amount of vapour is impressive. Holding the box upside down helps."
lbregs,38t8ws,skrew_,2,Sun Jun 7 14:31:42 2015 UTC,"yes...i periodically do this to burnoff/clean from the excess buildup, and it smokes heavily (with lid open) but your right I could just as easily close the lid and inhale through the water setup i have (orbiter, ufo, and bong)"
lbregs,38t8ws,imflb,1 point,Sun Jun 7 07:58:17 2015 UTC,"Add some green tea leaves into your box, you'll get a nice little calming buzz from the green tea and maybe some left of resin will evap too :)"
lbregs,38p1zd,gtni,7,Fri Jun 5 17:39:36 2015 UTC,dude! ... that coffee's H.O.T ... you're exhaling steam!
lbregs,38p1zd,I_Submit_This,2,Fri Jun 5 17:59:07 2015 UTC,I look forward to your comments everytime
lbregs,38p1zd,Ressotami,2,Mon Jun 8 04:11:13 2015 UTC,"Out of interest, How is the box positioned in the top? Is the width enough for you to squeeze and engage the battery through the cup?"
lbregs,38p1zd,_cLeOdIs_,8,Fri Jun 5 19:50:36 2015 UTC,"The box isn't in there. He's drinking the coffee through the stem to ingest the oil that has built up on it, I believe"
lbregs,38p1zd,Ressotami,3,Fri Jun 5 21:40:16 2015 UTC,Oh......I kinda saw this as a stealth mod. Hiding the box in the cup.
lbregs,38p1zd,Moon_Mist,2,Fri Jun 5 22:26:14 2015 UTC,Yea I was picturing something like this
lbregs,38p1zd,I_Submit_This,2,Sat Jun 6 05:26:05 2015 UTC,"hopefully this is not your pic ... batt caps should always be on when not in use, or charging."
lbregs,38p1zd,ItsMeKupo,1 point,Sat Jun 6 06:58:10 2015 UTC,"This is poorly designed. Something like this in a jumbo cup would be much more convenient, and would allow the trench to be horizontal and not vertical, which is much more optimal.   Image is not mine, just had it saved for a while :)"
lbregs,38p1zd,Ressotami,2,Sat Jun 6 10:24:29 2015 UTC,Love the whip through the ice water idea.  If you rooted it through a short section of stainless steel pipe you'd have some great thermal contact for extra cooling.
lbregs,38p1zd,ItsMeKupo,1 point,Sat Jun 6 10:33:31 2015 UTC,"I was thinking about some sort of heatsink, like aluminium with thin 'fans' protruding. Seemed a bit too complicated and really unnecessary, but was an interesting idea. A friend did this exact setup, and he had no trouble with how hot it was through the whip. Kinda inconvenient to take the MFLB out and replace the ice/water though ;)"
lbregs,38p1zd,vaportender,1 point,Sat Jun 6 11:26:39 2015 UTC,I've seen these cup setups and always wondered how one would engage the battery...
lbregs,38p1zd,arthurblakey,1 point,Sat Jun 6 12:30:02 2015 UTC,Why is it so important to put the caps on when the batteries aren't in use?
lbregs,38p1zd,oaschbeidl,3,Sat Jun 6 10:32:39 2015 UTC,"If you don't, they are very easy to short."
lbregs,38p1zd,HellCatOG,2,Sat Jun 6 11:21:21 2015 UTC,"I've also had a quarter in my pocket and put an uncapped battery in my pocket. Felt a hot sensation when I was driving and reached into my pocket, burned my hand pulling out the battery that was very hot. I think I even had a small part of the glyph design burned into skin for a couple days. Not pleasant."
lbregs,38p1zd,mflbninja,2,Sat Jun 6 14:15:11 2015 UTC,Glyphs: they make a handy surprise branding iron!

lbregs,38lyrj,I_Submit_This,0,Mon Jun 8 04:12:05 2015 UTC,"not other than dropping one full charge cycle, from the ~500 cycles NiMH batts get in a charger, without getting a full charge."

lbregs,38lyrj,I_Submit_This,5,Sat Jun 6 21:54:14 2015 UTC,maybe invest ina Patience Adapter.
lbregs,38lyrj,PCGA,4,Fri Jun 5 02:46:59 2015 UTC,Maybe I like the portability?
lbregs,38lyrj,IAmAMustardAMA,3,Fri Jun 5 04:03:05 2015 UTC,"... just sayin' my friend. portability is good.    what types of NiMHs do you use, and what ""type"" of mobile do you usually do?"
lbregs,38lyrj,I_Submit_This,5,Fri Jun 5 04:06:01 2015 UTC,"Man, people are so hostile towards you. A PA's a really good suggestion, perfect for those times when you just wanna have a quick vape. I keep mine next to my bed!"
lbregs,38lyrj,Mobile_Version,1 point,Fri Jun 5 13:48:22 2015 UTC,Do you feel like a second charger is worth it? Just wondering cause I too have 4 batteries and don't really want a PA because of the price and because I rarely use mine at home
lbregs,38lyrj,I_Submit_This,1 point,Sat Jun 6 17:01:29 2015 UTC,"instead of 2, go for a 4 (or more), cell NiMH reconditioning charger. there are others that aren't so expensive if you search with appropriate keywords."

lbregs,38kuet,mfb0fh,2,Thu Jun 4 21:35:01 2015 UTC,"it looks like very close-grained, dense wood right there, and the drill may not have been sharp enough to cut without a lot of friction.    i'm sure MFLB would at least compensate you in some way for the lack of finish uniformity.    drop 'em a line."
lbregs,38kuet,I_Submit_This,1 point,Thu Jun 4 21:41:30 2015 UTC,Thank you /u/I_Submit_This I'll be sure to let MF know about it. There is also a similar mark where the battery hole is!

lbregs,38dsfh,I_Submit_This,2,Wed Jun 3 19:55:45 2015 UTC,The MFLB is probably the best vaporizer to use small quantities of weed when you're dankrupt but just seek a light buzz [4-5].  You can throw in 0.01g and still get something.  When you clean your grinders you can find a tons of trichomes but this on the contrary makes for some of the best trench sending you straight to a [9] if you find enough.

lbregs,38d01b,marijuana_stabber,2,Fri Jun 5 13:20:46 2015 UTC,the straw is just sort of pushed in there but to make the hole I burned it too small and while it was still hot pushed the straw through to make it a really tight fit

Drivers are recruited from Dispensaries and Cooperatives, so they are all legal certificate or card holding individuals. No illegality in fee transactions as all that will be set up through the App via ""donations"" for the service which covers company costs and drivers fees and yes the product... Plus Add on App button at the bottom ""Munchie Wish List"" Customer types in a quick suggestion for any muchies they want and a Max amount to spend. And if the driver happens to be close to a fast food drive through or mini mart they will run in and pick up something, and that would just be a dude picking up munchies for you and you pay them back when they get there.. and of course Tips... I dunno probably over thinking this.. There are of course already delivery services, but this more of an independent contractor thing i'm thinking about."

lbregs,37sejz,xSlappy-,2,Sat May 30 01:01:20 2015 UTC,"Exactly this. Also the upshot of having such fantastic customer service is that you basically have a base of the most valuable marketing money can buy: word of mouth. For all the money you can spend nothing can quite match the efficacy of a recommendation from someone you know, especially a fellow ent. The folks over at Magic Flight are incredibly smart and we as customers benefit greatly from this kind of strategy."
lbregs,37sejz,LegoSpaceship,4,Sat May 30 04:17:45 2015 UTC,That's the retail value not the manufacturing value.

lbregs,37hoi9,SP120K,3,Wed May 27 19:48:13 2015 UTC,You try engaging battery/PA while shaking till globe is full of vapor the draw it all in one hit?
lbregs,37hoi9,rodneyb74,5,Wed May 27 22:08:26 2015 UTC,"Interesting idea, though I have the orbiter bubbler, so normally that fills up with vapor.  I think you might run into issues with no airflow to cool down, so I guess you'd be relying on the shaking to cool it down.  One other thing I haven't tried is putting a whole gram or more of herb in, which should let it go much longer between refills, always toasting just the bottom portion and then remixing."
lbregs,37hoi9,beerandabike,2,Wed May 27 22:26:25 2015 UTC,That thing looks really awesome! You should sell them.

I am already proficient at stacking hits, which roasts the herb evenly with no combustion and without the need for accessories. Shaking four or more times during the hit would make this impractical due to the size, yet it is my preferred method for achieving large clouds with the MFLB, so the accessory is incompatible with me, at least."

The dart shape makes it easier to draw from than the glass stem, it cools the vapor a little better than the glass stem, it doesn't get hot on your lips the way the glass stem sometimes does, you never have to worry about it breaking, and of course it looks great.

Typically lung set up (2 liter bottle and a bag) I dropped a wadded up ball of tape inside the bag after I fished making it and made a pull with some folded tape. Then I lashed the handle around the ball at the bottom of the bag for strongest hold.   The cap with the socket is for weed and red cap is hooked up to my box with the whip. The best way for me to hit it is to hold my box with my right hand while engaging the battery and shaking it every few seconds. I hold the bottle in my left hand and pull the handle on the bag with my teeth. Fill it up and breath in all the goodness. Just did a test of both. One hit weed one hit with the box. I'm already climbing high as fuck. Gotta love it

Here's an extract from /u/mflbninja guide (link to full below):   To break it down step by step, what you do is:   Breathe in and out. Engage the power. Wait a second. Take a very short hit, then shake thoroughly. Repeat the last step 5-10 times or until your lungs are almost full. Disengage the power and draw for a second or two to cool the unit. Take a short breath of air to cap off the hit and avoid irritating your throat. Hold for about 5 seconds, then exhale.    link: http://www.reddit.com/r/mflb/comments/1w577s/mflbninjas_guide_first_edition_stacking/"

lbregs,36oiqz,hungboy88,3,Thu May 21 10:01:46 2015 UTC,"I've been using the ""Lucky"" Method and it has been clearing trenches much quicker that I had been before. I call it the lucky method because you hold the battery in for 7 seconds, draw for 7 seconds with the battery, and then draw for 7 seconds after the battery is disengaged. It is really great for new people on the box as it is clear and direct. I will sometimes double or triple the time on my draw with the battery engaged if i want bigger hits.   It might also be important that I usually have pretty sticky weed and i don't typically let it dry or anything out of personal preference. This method gets your box pretty hot and may combust if you aren't careful."

lbregs,36k14a,sirecoke,2,Wed May 20 19:47:44 2015 UTC,"Of course, honestly it wasn't professional grade, I put 3 tablespoon of regular vegetable oil in a pan and added all the AVB I had, the 3 tablespoons were just enough to drench it all.  I cranke the heat up to medium-high, you dont want the oil to be bubbling up and all. Just gentle heat, for about 20 mins. Then I added that oil to a pancake mix ( a readymade one, literally only had to add one egg and 3 tablespoon of oil so that s where I popped the AVB in)  If I were to redo it, and when I save up enoguh AVB again I might add in the saved trichomes from 2-3g from my 3 part grinder. The brownies themselves tasted really good, what I mean by that is first and foremost a chocolate taste and a slight tinge of green, you can definitely feel there is something ^ Took about 1 hour to kick in and stayed at a strong buzz [9]-[10] for 2 hours then came back down to [7] for the next 3 hours, ate 3 slices and went back up [10] faster this time and stayed up there fore 3-4 hours that time. and then today finished them sharing it with a group of friends and had a damn good time without having to spark up at all."

lbregs,35xyle,ForScale,-3,Thu May 14 17:23:42 2015 UTC,"sub wars   Not really, it just so happens that there's a sub with people in it that could help support me in answering the waves of incoming replies, so I called them to the thread while asking them not to vote, as that would be vote brigading. /u/I_Submit_This was kind enough to sticky the mflb thread. A few people including /u/Ressotami and /u/gtni were very helpful in the vaporents thread.   you don't use your Box   My problem is that although it produces a seemingly innocent vapor hit, with little throat irritation, I can always count on my throat closing up about a minute later, and at least three puffs on my inhaler. Not so with my other vapes. It's probably because of the conduction vapor. It's painfully ironic that I should have this problem, but the thing is not many people have severe asthma like I do, so it's a very rare problem and doesn't apply to the majority of people. I will continue to support it because it's still a great device for a lot of people.   you're leaving reddit   Well, yeah. I don't want to announce that I'm leaving though. It's more like, I'll be less and less able to use reddit as the rest of my life takes me over. It might happen sooner or later, but I'm sure there'll be some kind of commotion happening that'll allow me to make a quiet exit stage right.

Seems they don't like IST over there though; people asking if they can finally ban him. And... now that I think about it... someone the other day, here in /r/lbregs, said they had a rough time or bad day involving IST over in vaporents. They were venting here about him/it and I told them to keep it civil. They kindly obliged and explained the frustration.  What the hell goes on over there?! Jeez...   It's painfully ironic that I should have this problem   Ha. Yep.   but I'm sure there'll be some kind of commotion happening that'll allow me to make a quiet exit stage right.   Hmm...

It's usually when someone has given up on it and is moving on to another vaporizer that we get flak for saying anything. Their minds are made up, why are we even talking? Because the information is wrong, that's why... but oh well.  As for leaving, I don't know if I'll ever leave altogether. It's just that I know someday I will indeed have to cut back, and you guys on the mod team will probably have to take my place more or less, maybe even hire on another mod. It's not a huge deal, and I don't wanna make it one, it's just how it goes. But what I want to do is make sure I get my contribution in before I leave. And it isn't happening yet, I'm still here for the time being!"
lbregs,35xyle,mflbninja,2,Thu May 14 19:07:02 2015 UTC,Coolio!
lbregs,35xyle,ForScale,6,Thu May 14 19:30:28 2015 UTC,"Honestly I don't see myself purchasing another vaporizer unless I ever lose it, sell it to a friend, or want to further maintain it by making sure that there's absolutely no risk of anyone combusting herb in it. I totally understand where mflbninja is coming from and why he want to defend MFLB against some people in r/vaporents, but sometimes it's futile trying to convince people whose minds have been lop set already on their own opinions. However I don't see a point in trying to force anything down anyone's throats, there was no need to create an argument even if it was initially just supposed to be a civil discussion.   I've used multiple vaporizers and of course they're all different and have their own advantages. When I was in the market for a vaporizer I did plenty of research before deciding which to purchase. I was mainly concerned with price, which is why my first vaporizer was a Snoop Dogg G-Pen off of eBay. I used a steel mesh screen and even a ceramic screen with it because I heard that people kept combusting instead by accident. Then the coil got a bit messed up so I purchased a replacement and once I put it on, the battery went haywire and wouldn't stop heating the coil. I tried letting it die and then charging it again and giving it another go but nothing changed. That's when I went back to searching for a vaporizer. Among the first few choices I had were the DaVinci Ascent, Pax 2, and the Arizer Extreme Q, and the MFLB.   Number one reason for such a purchase was portability, so I ditched the Extreme Q. I've used it a few times as two of my housemates had it in college. A couple of times the session lasted for a while with 3+ people but the heat up time took a while and the weed didn't last as long (I'm not sure what the temperature was set at).  I used The Pax 2 a couple times before and it worked really well, I liked it, but the price was a bit too high at the time.  The limited 10 year warranty was definitely nothing to scoff at, realistically I don't know when I'd stop vaporizing.   I have yet to use The DaVinci Ascent but I heard mixed things about it. The limited 2 year warranty was a little off putting as well.   Another reason for purchasing a vaporizer was to cut down on costs of consuming weed and limiting further weed related purchases, so a lifetime warranty was definitely a huge plus.   One of my housemates had an MFLB and I only remembered my experience with it after I had purchased it and taken my first hit. He had one of the earlier models, the lid was a bit loose and he had lost his brush, but the box was in perfect condition otherwise. It looked like he never ever combusted in it and he had originally bought it sometime in his high school years. He offered me a hit one day when I had been drinking for a while and had already taken a few bong rips, but he explained it clearly and I took a great native hit. The taste was strong and  liked it especially compared to the taste of combustion.   When I saw the MFLB I believe it was one of the few vaporizers with a lifetime warranty. Along with the fact that it's handmade in America and shipping takes less than two weeks I was seriously considering buying it. Then I did more research around reddit as well and found an awesome price on a MFLB combo kit including the finishing grinder and Power Adapter 2.0. These products also have a lifetime warranty and I found that to be very useful. I did see the Orbiter at the time but I wanted to hold it off until I was back to my college house. With the lifetime warranty on the glass on purchases before 2015 I knew I had to buy that soon.   As for vaporizers that came out after my purchase, the Grasshopper has caught my attention because of its affordable price, solid build structure, great heating capability, and lifetime warranty. It's also a very sleek looking vaporizer that people might easily mistake for just a pen. Firefly also comes to mind but it's much less stealthy. The Crafty and Mighty are a bit too bulky for me, but I mainly travel with my MFLB and keep it in a case anyway so that might not be a problem until u decide to vape at a park. I would most likely purchase the Grasshopper if I were to ever misplace my MFLB, but I'd still buy just the box from the Connoisseur's Club.   There's just that feeling when I'm cleaning my MFLB, I want to maintain it and keep it looking pristine. I feel like I'm painting on a tiny canvas every time I use the brush, especially on a fresh box. I've just received my third box in one year and I really want to keep this new box looking brand new.   Many people seem to have an issue with the learning curve of the MFLB, but I enjoy it, I've even managed to get all my friends who smoke to try it multiple times with multiple different methods and only two of them combusted in the box and it wasn't even that bad. My friend with the Pax 2 told me that besides the learning curve and having to shake the box after every draw, I'd want to get new batteries for it, but the current Magic Flight Glyph batteries are working perfectly.   I don't have a problem with the vapor and neither do my friends. My girlfriend might cough once in a while but that's eliminated with the Orbiter. She enjoys using her bowl or smoking a blunt more than anything else, so another vaporizer wouldn't change that. I don't agree with forcing one method of consumption or product upon anyone and I like to keep an open mind about it. I'd try to teach my friends the sipping method and adjusting heat with their draw rate but many of them stay consistent to what they always do. Whenever I vape I use multiple methods including the stacking, sipping, 666, long and slow, and even with a tiny bit of water in my mouth. I like learning the different methods and do so whenever I vape by myself. I believe the MFLB is as good of a personal portable vaporizer as the rest when combined with good technique, maintenance, and patience. Of course it's also not for everyone at the same time, out of all the 20+ people I've shown it to and let them hit it, only one expressed disappointment and said they've tried a better vaporizer. But, she was a dumb drunk bitch who kept holding down the button regardless of what I told her, and kept drawing too fast so the trench never even heated up even as she stopped to talk to her friend while holding down the button. I had it hooked up to the Orbiter so I assume she thought it was working akin to an Arizer Extreme Q though so that could also be my fault...   tldr; MFLB is an excellent personal portable vaporizer when combined with good technique, proper maintenance, patience, and willingness to learn. I believe it is up to par with more modern portable vaporizers that have built in heat management."
lbregs,35xyle,Nova-Bombed92,3,Thu May 14 16:01:25 2015 UTC,"Nice write up!  I'm still in the honeymoon phase with my MFLB so I can speak to the same POV, but, FWIW, in my experience, water curing the bud first eliminates 90% of the cough inducing effect and harshness of the vapor."
lbregs,35xyle,happyself,0,Thu May 14 14:07:11 2015 UTC,"Hahahaaa!!! Excellent writeup. Had me laughing out loud toward the end.  You might be onto something with the ""last show of loyalty"". I'm not planning on stickin' around here forever, and I want to do something before I gotta go. And I don't know what I mean exactly by ""go"", it might just mean ""use reddit a lot less"". Regardless, this battle was one half of my swan song, the ""tough love"" portion for /r/vaporents because I know they love a good fight. The other is yet to come, a gift for /r/mflb and /r/lbregs (and no, it's not another battle), which I've been working on for close to a year and is currently in beta. I'm thinking once that's over I'll probably fade into obscurity and/or get on with the rest of my life which has been patiently waiting for me to git offa that reddit.  I want to ask about your throat irritation. This was actually a phase that I went through while I was still able to use it. There are ways around the irritation such as reshaping your mouth, taking smaller hits etc. My problem is that although it produces a seemingly innocent vapor hit, with little throat irritation indeed, I can always count on my throat closing up about a minute later, and at least three puffs on my inhaler. Not so with my other vapes. So if we're going to name a syndrome after me, it should probably be for people who strictly cannot use their Launch Box, rather than inclusive of people who choose not to. I didn't coin the term though, so it's just a suggestion.  And one more thing... I am technically not the inventor of the stacking technique. Supposedly it was common knowledge on the FC forums long before I introduced it to reddit, even though I didn't find out about it through FC but on my own. You can call me the inventor if you want to, but I'm technically not. I don't want to take credit from, uh, someone on FC. :p  Thanks again for the funny and insightful post."

lbregs,35jq7r,aurora135,1 point,Tue May 12 22:12:49 2015 UTC,"When I got the hang of stacking hits, the Launch Box became a beast. I had a particularly hot battery at the time, new and freshly charged, and a nice fresh trench of good bud as well, so it only took four hits-in-one to make a nice cloud, and about four of those had me looking at the little device in a new way."
lbregs,35jq7r,mflbninja,1 point,Mon May 11 17:17:56 2015 UTC,"Enjoy your Solo, recently bought a session vape myself (flowermate v5.0s) and I have to say....It's in the drawer and my launch box is in my lap.  Why?  Because I don't wanna switch it on and bake an oven.....I want to light it up toke by toke. Make it last all evening.  The biggest flaw I've found about the flower mate is I switch it on, hit and and forget about it. Coming back only 5 minutes later to find it's gone on standby and cooked the load.  When I do that with my launch box...the trench is still bright green ;-)   That alone is why I can never retire my launch box."
lbregs,35jq7r,Ressotami,1 point,Mon May 11 19:44:54 2015 UTC,Luckily the solo has an auto shutoff and is convection and not conduction or I'd rather rob ably have the same issues. Recently broke the kid so I'll probably warranty this specific box but I'll always keep a launch box around if I just want a hit or two.

lbregs,35jq7r,I_Submit_This,2,Mon May 11 01:59:12 2015 UTC,TARS is the name of my vape. I named it after one of the robots for Interstellar since it's previous incarnation was named after the monolith from 2001. It's been my only piece for so long and I've perfected my use of it to the point that it feels like an extension of myself sometimes. I'll always have it around but I've been appreciating everything this little box has given me before upgrading.

lbregs,357qm8,its0nLikeDonkeyKong,1 point,Fri May 8 00:45:10 2015 UTC,"Hi, I hope IST explained it to you well enough. The first sub people encounter is /r/mflb, and it's best if that sub is the help desk and another sub is reserved for the miscellany. That's because when you're in need of an answer, you're not going to want to have to find the Q&A sub first, whereas if you're just posting a photo then it shouldn't devastate you to have your submission removed and redirected.  I wouldn't get too hung up on the subscriber count if I were you. The vast majority of these users have left reddit or switched accounts, while the subscribership of this sub is largely active, as this sub is newer. We have a big mention on the sidebar of /r/mflb and IST is referring people here on the regular. It's like the two subs are one, except there's now a sorting system in place.  I know you've been on this tirade for a long time now. I don't think your issues with IST have very much to do at all with his official business. If they did you wouldn't try to be so abusive. Maybe he reminds you of another stubborn ol' dude in your life? Or perhaps it's just the fact that he's so stubborn that challenges you to try to change him.

I don't know how people don't understand that /r/mflb is the official help forum for mflb. It's referred to in the instruction booklet. Not every sub on reddit necessarily has the same chatroom-esque image board format. There are plenty that have very strict rules. /r/mflb is one of those subs. It's a help forum, and frankly it would be difficult to find information with casual posts all over the place. /r/lbregs is now referred to in the sidebar on /r/mflb. Why are you people not happy? This is juvenile. If someone posts a casual post in /r/mflb, IST refers them here, and I guarantee that person then posts in here. The split subs are not hurting the community in any way.

Not the mflb subreddit!   Oooo scary!   Ohh I don't think you understand. I meant it as everyone in mflb is pretty much there to just answer customer questions and not to post content other customers might be interested in.   Not a real rep. Weird how you wanted to take advantage of how I said it to swing your big stick around. You know that's not what I meant but made it that way so you could vaguely threaten me? Nah it sounds way too silly for IST to threaten to tell mommy on me! Misunderstanding on my end now!  But yeah not a real rep DUH it was meant to compare the users as reps since all the subreddit unfortunately is is a place where new customers can ask questions and old ones act as reps since all they can do is answer or promote tips and tricks!

I'm not sure why some people go longer. Ethanol is a pretty damn good solvent...pulls it out pretty readily. Then I just filter and use. I have to test each batch but  2mls is a pretty good 4-5  hour dose usually. That's me...I've shared and one girl started at 1ml and went all the way down to 1/4ml.

lbregs,357llk,seekere,2,Thu May 7 19:45:42 2015 UTC,It's not an acrylic stem by any chance right? Those aren't supposed to be soaked in ISO.  Assuming it's glass... What container did you soak it in? Made of glass or something else?
lbregs,357llk,defsubsucks,1 point,Thu May 7 20:17:46 2015 UTC,Turns out it was acrylic. Didn't know it reacted with ISO. pretty cool haha. it cracked a bit internally but no holes formed. I guess i could still use it.
lbregs,357llk,defsubsucks,2,Thu May 7 20:23:51 2015 UTC,"It's probably pretty brittle now and could crack open easily... I once had a paper-towel soaked with ISO inside an acrylic stem, giving it a back'n'forth clean, and it just cracked along the stem and broke into two pieces. This wasn't the stem's first exposure to ISO so it was already weak, but just the pressure of the paper-towel rubbing it from inside managed to break it.  Have you tried glass stems? Personally I like it more than the acrylic."
lbregs,357llk,defsubsucks,2,Thu May 7 20:30:23 2015 UTC,Where could I get one aside from ordering it online? I'm coming home from college soon and don't want to order from the internet.

The box is fucking insane. 2 nights ago i got high off a 0.13g STEM, and i used it shittily as well. It was just broken up by hand. I mean, i wasnt super baked or anything but enough to fall asleep super quick and it relieved pain.  Then yesterday i tapped as much kief/really finely ground weed out of my grinder as i could, it was a few little specs and used the stem from the night before and same result as the night before.  Not to mention, 3 medium sized hits of normal bud got me higher then an entire bowl  smoking (the bowl i use is small, but still).  All that, and you get honey oil and AVB...."

lbregs,355ih3,I_Submit_This,2,Thu May 7 11:53:04 2015 UTC,"Thanks for sharing Resso! I know it seems somewhat ironic since I founded this sub and I'm writing a five-part guide to the Launch Box and Muad-Dib, but I have stopped using the Launch Box. But it's not because it's an inferior vaporizer or anything! Rather, I have severe asthma that it likes to irritate every time I use it. I've tested this for two months straight and the bottom line is my lungs can no longer tolerate the type of vapor the Launch Box produces.  My other vaporizers have never caused an asthma attack. I have an Underdog log vape as my home unit for power bong rips, and a more recent purchase, the Mighty by Storz & Bickel. Both don't even come close to making my throat close up like the MFLB; to the company's credit however my Muad-Dib has never caused an attack, even with massive amounts of oil.  If your lungs aren't as picky as mine are and you can use the Launch Box, I think it is truly the greatest portable-personal vape money can buy. And if you're at a party and you don't mind spending a minute to do some work, you can load gigantic hits for your friends using a vessel of some kind - a large bong or a third lung will work, and it goes well with the stacking technique. So it's not so anti-social after all! :p"
lbregs,355ih3,mflbninja,1 point,Thu May 7 18:07:38 2015 UTC,"I completely agree with you mate. I just got an Alfa yest, for pretty much the same reasons- I've given up combustion, but when friends that I normally smoke js with pop round now, they have no interest in giving the launchbox or lotus (or e-nano) a go. So I wanted something which you can turn on and pass around, and actually get high easily from.  So I was debating between the Alfa for £120, or paying the extra 80 and getting a Crafty (prices are from vapefiend.co.uk).  Although I was very tempted by the crafty, and still am really, I decided to go with the Alfa because of battery life etc, and also the money that I've saved can get me a Delta Box from magic flight for my 30th birthday present to myself 😉.  So the Alfa is cool, I can't seem to produce the clouds that reviews I've read on FC claim, but I'm sure it's something to do with the way I pack it. But the effect is definitley there, one whole load in the Alfa is similar in effect to blazing a j (imo). I'd say on average the bowl holds around a mflb-trench worth  of herb without packing, but you could fit at least double that if you wanted to.  But yea, I still find myself using my mflb more than any of my vapes, especially for daytime. And the efficiency of the mflb is by far the best. And for perspective, I own:  Mflb Vaponic (really good taste, and great vape once you learn how to use it) Lotus Enano And now the Alfa.  I'm also eagerly awaiting a grasshopper to hop through my door, but alas the waiting got to me which is why I pulled the trigger on the Alfa.  ...still kinda wishing I went for the crafty, but seeing as I havnt tried one yet, at least I don't know what I'm missing."

lbregs,355ih3,LikelyEatingTacoBell,1 point,Thu May 7 22:24:48 2015 UTC,It works great for solo sessions.  You can put any   amount of herb in it and it comes out very uniform brown.  But after the sesh I'm just not as high as the same amount in an mflb.
lbregs,355ih3,Nova-Bombed92,1 point,Sat May 9 09:32:47 2015 UTC,"I only vaped a trench and two hits last night and I don't think I've gotten that high in quite some time. Had some Master Yoda and Bruce Banner, barely got into the Master Yoda. I like to take my time with the MFLB but when you speed things up a bit, and try to go through that trench as quickly as you can, it can get you really high especially off a new box with the P. A 2.0 or some fresh batteries.   I want to wait and see how the vaporizer market grows in the coming years. If I ever want a session convection vaporizer with friends I'll have to do some more research on what I want. I heard the Mighty and Crafty are pretty good but expensive as well."

This tastes good, will stay good for quite some time, and got me a VERY good nights sleep.  Otherwise what I normally do is put 2-3 gs abv in with coconut oil in the slow cooker, as above, and then add in some high% cocoa dark chocolate, then let it set, break into squares and give them to colleagues in work for various ailments (high blood pressure, insomnia and back pain. Again, 2 or 3 chunks of this choc will give me a good nights sleep."

Truely a great human - have some gold :)  How much coconut oil and chocolate do you add for the AVB chocolate? I'm going to give it a try, it sounds great."
lbregs,34y79l,Herbalist33,8,Tue May 5 17:00:11 2015 UTC,"Wow! Thanks for the gold my friend! i never quite knew what gold really was, but now I do!! Much appreciated!  Right well as for the chocolate, (il try to write a guide soon with pics and links), basically I get a small mason jar or similar and put maybe a tablespoon or two of raw (preferably organic) coconut oil in, and put the jar in the slow cooker. Allow the coconut oil to melt, and in the meantime you can powder up the AVB in a mortar and pestle.  I basically aim to have just enough oil to saturate and cover the avb by a mm or two. When making chocolate it's important not to use too much oil, as it will cause the chocolate to be quite messy at room temperature- not ideal for transporting to colleagues etc.  So il add the powdered avb, lately I've been using about 2.5 to 3gs, and stir it in, adding more coconut oil if it's needed. Then il leave it in the slow cooker on low, with the lid on, for maybe 45 min, stirring every 10 min or so. Keep an eye to make sure it's not bubbling too much etc.   Then il add a whole bar (100grams I believe, but il check next time I go to the shop), of broken up, high cocoa (~70%) dark chocolate. Mix this in and allow to melt, stirring throughout. Once it's in a nice melted state and its been thoroughly mixed in, il pour it into a rectangular mold (mould? I'm high), and put in the fridge to set. The addition of the coconut oil not only helps in dispersing the cannabinoids evenly throughout the chocolate, but it also makes it taste like a Bounty (uk chocolate bar made with coconut).  Il cut it into fairly regular sized squares so that it's easy for my colleagues to dose- none of them use recreationally, they all have just been open to the idea of giving it a go, and I thought, as its avb, it's a bit less risky than giving them full blown fresh herb edibles (or a joint), as in its shouldn't be too overpowering, because a lot of the thc and cannabinoids have been Vaped off/ converted to cbn. It's always a worry getting someone to try herb for the first time, because you don't want to overwhelm them, as it will really put them off trying again, even if cannabis can really help their ailments. Edibles are especially hard to judge in my opinion.  So far like I said, one of my colleagues in work has been suffering from high blood pressure, and I pointed him in the direction of some studies from granny storms list, and explained to him my understanding of how cannabis works, and he was interested in trying.  So as I had a couple gs of avb saved from my magic flight, I gave the chocolate a go, and gave it to him (I tried it myself first to judge potency, which is very difficult considering I'm an everyday partaker, and he had never tried afaik). Next time I saw him when I started my shifts (about a week later) I asked him 'how his blood pressure was' (wink wink), and he replied it was REALLY a good. Talking to him later, he told me that yea, his blood pressure had returned to normal- he'd been eating a couple of squares of the chocolate each night, sleeping well, and yea, feeling pretty good all in all. So I made a couple more batches, experimenting with strength, settling on around 3gs avb to a bar of chocolate.   I unfortunately fell off the wagon (as in started combusting again) at Xmas, and was in that sorry state for a few months, so didn't really have any avb to play with, meaning my colleague didn't have any chocolate for that period. I havnt tried using fresh herb, as I can't really afford it myself, and wouldn't feel right charging for it, it feels wrong for some reason. If they wanted to source the herb themselves if be happy to make it up for them, but whatever. Anyway, saw him a few weeks ago, and asked how h is blood pressure was, and he said it was high again.  Anyway, I've managed to claw my way out of combustion again about a month ago, and as soon as I'd saved up ~5gs, I made that shot of honey for me, and a bar of chocolate for the guy in work, and another guy who's been suffering back pain, but also gout (which I'm interested in seeing whether it helps with, as there's not alot of info, but as its a form of arthritis, perhaps there's a chance). I saw my blood pressure colleague in work a few days ago, after he had the chocolate about 10days ago, and he said his blood pressure is really good again- even he's surprised how clearly it seems to help, but he thinks it's great.   Incidentally, for the blood pressure guy (and myself), I also made a tincture which I ran probably around 5gs through, which he found really good, but rinsed through it REALLY quicky, whereas I still have half my dropper bottle left. I currently have 3.5gs avb in ~100ml 85% vodka in a jar in the freezer, and once I have another 3.5gs saved up il filter the tincture and add the new avb, and probably repeat again until around 10gs have gone through it. Hopefully it will be some potent shit (and I'm hoping it will help another guy in work who's been suffering really bad with stress, and having time off over it etc; I'm sure it's more than a cannabis tincture can solve, but perhaps it can help take the edge off).  Anyway, this has gone on WAAAAYYYY too long now, I'm really baked right now from a mix of my mflb through the orbiter, and hitting the vaponic with a load of 'finishing grinder' ground herb.   Thanks again /u/I mflb , you the man/woman/child/astronaut!!! Peace and love, and il try to write a how to with photos next time I have enough avb to make chocolate!! Any more questions, I'm happy to answer, but I'm not much of an expert (although do read up of weed ALOT Lol)"

lbregs,34y79l,ForScale,-1,Tue May 5 19:20:35 2015 UTC,"ISO evaps cleanly, without purging to levels far, far below the LD50 for ingestion.    it takes ounces, ingested quickly, in liquid form, before harmful levels are reached.    when used as rubbing alcohol, you'll absorb much more through the skin than you ever would, vaping it, smoking it, or introducing it into edibles.    i make my whole plant edible hash oil using ISO with no problems. it's safer than butane, and cheaper than both butane and any ethanol."
lbregs,34y79l,I_Submit_This,2,Tue May 5 19:41:42 2015 UTC,"I hear ya... but for my own peace of mind, I use ethanol... just in case!"

lbregs,34y79l,I_Submit_This,4,Tue May 5 21:07:38 2015 UTC,"I make ABV cannabutter. Not to be lazy but I literally look up ""abv cannabutter"" on Google every time I do it... so that's how I do it. :p  A couple notes: I do most of the filtering in a dedicated French press I bought at Wal-Mart for $20, which takes the hand burning out of the equation. After it sets in the fridge, I take the resulting brick, flip it on its side, and scrape off the residue-laden butter from the bottom with a butter knife; then I melt and refilter the residue butter and it usually comes out well.  Edit because also: I use a slow cooker on low for 24 hours, stirring every hour if I can, but at least every 3 or 4 hours."
lbregs,34y79l,OfGiraffesAndMen,3,Tue May 5 17:04:13 2015 UTC,I've only made edibles once using my AVB and I made the cannabutter but left the actual AVB in (no filtering) - it gave it a....ummm...... textured feel haha
lbregs,34y79l,RANDOMLY_YELLS,3,Tue May 5 17:20:17 2015 UTC,"My brother and I use it to make Lon Lon Milk. We cook the abv in a crock pot with soy milk (lactose intolerant) on low for a few hours. Then we use cheese cloth to sift out the dregs and seal it in mason jars. Goes great in coffee, tea, milkshakes, and makes a damn fine White Russian. Although, I guess it's more of a Green Russian..."
lbregs,34y79l,I_Submit_This,3,Tue May 5 20:09:16 2015 UTC,Does the milk have a herby taste to it? and what's your rough measurments?
lbregs,34y79l,RANDOMLY_YELLS,3,Tue May 5 20:32:53 2015 UTC,"Yeah it has a definite weed taste on its own, but it's easy to cover up when you mix it into something.  We usually end up putting all the abv and keif from a quarter of bud, and cook it in a half gallon of milk and we cook it on low for around 3-4 hours."
lbregs,34y79l,I_Submit_This,4,Tue May 5 20:52:11 2015 UTC,"when used in an edible, that kief should be decarbed first for best effect.    when extracting/infusing into a lipid, the cannabinoids become enveloped in the lipid and cannot fully decarb. dry heat decarbing before extraction will yield the most effective edible.    a lot of the THC especially, will remain in it's acidic form, THC-A ... which is not psychoactive, though still has medicinal benefits."
lbregs,34y79l,OfGiraffesAndMen,1 point,Tue May 5 22:10:50 2015 UTC,Huh I always thought the crock was decarbing it enough. Thanks for the tip! I'll keep that in mind next time.
lbregs,34y79l,beerandabike,3,Wed May 6 02:12:56 2015 UTC,"Out of curiosity, does the smell stick with the crock pot? I want to do this (or something similar) with my abv but I don't want to taint my usual crock pot usage."
lbregs,34y79l,OfGiraffesAndMen,3,Tue May 5 22:14:11 2015 UTC,"ever cook anything garlicky in it? does it continue to smell of garlic?    crockpots are usually glazed ceramic (for the thermal mass), though some are glass, and i have a variable heat slow cooker that can go high enough to deep-fry, thats teflon coated aluminum ... no problemo.    ... but i admit that my nasal cannabinoid detectors are maxed out 24/7."

lbregs,34y79l,Binary_Systems,2,Wed May 6 02:14:34 2015 UTC,That Green Russian sounds like a fantastic idea! My favorite thing to do on nights that I have off the next day is have a few puffs on the old box and a glass or three of bourbon on the rocks. Herb and good alcohol together give me such nice mellow mood (in moderation of course!!!). And I used to LOVE White Russians. I think I know what I'm doing with my first ever stem harvest.

lbregs,34w9wg,throwitawayfool2,5,Tue May 5 02:08:06 2015 UTC,"I don't honestly remember if I found this guy from randomly searching Youtube or if someone else linked me to it, but a few months ago I discovered Sneaky Pete's video reviews and enjoyed how in-depth he goes into each one.  Today he posted a video review of the MFLB, one that's been in the works for a month or two.  He does a good job of going over all the aspects of the unit, various methods to try using, and he even touches on the various accessories as well.    If you have the time, I'd suggest looking at all 4 videos he's made for the MFLB and Maud-Dib.  He basically got sent the entire assortment of Magic-Flight products from the beginning so he was starting out with the Orbiter and PA from day 1, which is almost the opposite of how the rest of us built up our collections and makes for an interesting point of view.  I do like that he actively uses each unit for at least a month before making the review too. Feels more authentic that way.  Anyway, in chronological order:   Maud-Dib unboxing and first impressions MFLB unboxing and first impressions Maud-Dib extended review MFLB extended review (topic link)"

lbregs,34w9wg,I_Submit_This,-1,Thu May 7 17:32:56 2015 UTC,"by tamping you're restricting good airflow through your herb, but more impotantly, packing kills the Ir heating in the interior of the load, resulting in uneven roasting."

lbregs,34og4r,herooftime94,6,Sun May 3 14:45:19 2015 UTC,"I can take a stab at it. I've never personally had a problem with you, but these are my observations from being active on both subreddits and seeing people's reactions.  It's because people are sometimes a little bitter about your mod habits at /r/MFLB. You run a tight ship and you keep the place in line, but you can be a little too direct in your approach to doing so and it comes off as crass and rude. And it's completely understandable when you take into consideration the amount of shit you have to sift through to keep the subreddit in a usable shape for beginners. But when people see you commenting, they downvote you because they associate you with the interactions they see and experience on /r/mflb, no matter what the context is. (see /u/karmanaut after the Bad Luck Brian AMA)  The one thing I can recommend is just keep a positive demeanor no matter what people are saying to you. Be polite, poignant, and helpful. You're a great mod who people give a bad rap, so show them you're personable and compassionate so they know that their mod is the right person to run a subreddit with a great and helpful community.  Also, this is just a personal gripe of mine, but your strange use of ellipses and lack of capitals in comments can be strange to read and can also change the context of how your comments are read. Just something to consider! I hope you read and understand that any sort of criticism, constructive or not, is meant with the best of intention."

First off, you said it's an unwarranted downvote, we agree, but can't change the fact that it happened. However there's a guy following you just to downvote you, like you have a fan who spends their time down voting you.   You get the up votes for your good content, people love your information and your posts that read, ""Search this sub for..."" are excellent. /r/MFLB is one of the best subreddits for NEW content, and that's because of how you run it. Some people just want to see more of the same posts, and the dank memes. But that's where lbregs and trees provide content, with multireddits people can get the mix they want.  While there may be no need to downvote you, someone is still taking the time to do it, giving you that reputation and creating memories of I_Submit_This as the mod who runs a tight ship that not everyone agrees with. Revel in it, you do a good job, but no one can please everyone. Somehow you got the vocal minority after you. But because of it everyone on reddit knows who you are and that my friend, is legacy."

To be honest, it was difficult to hold the bubbler, the mflb, and work the PA battery at the same time. I'd recommend leaving this for smoking and make something like a mason jar bubbler for the mflb if you want one for it."

lbregs,34fzet,I_Submit_This,1 point,Fri May 1 05:37:27 2015 UTC,Hits wise its the same. The only fallback is that the glass stem is much easier to see vapor accumulate in the chamber.

lbregs,34cz6n,imitation_crabs,16,Thu Apr 30 03:48:17 2015 UTC,"Usually the suspicious behavior isn't as noticeable as the suspicious attitude (shifty eyes and look of up to no good). What I mean by that is people in general are very self centered... We think about ourselves more than others. If you walk by a person who's slapping one hand in to the other 2-3 times you won't thinking anything of it. If you walk by a person who is looking around with a worried demeanor, you WILL notice or think about that. And... As I was saying in the beginning, we think people are constantly checking out what we're doing, but in reality most people don't give a crap. I'm talking about complete strangers that is.  So what I'm saying, flip your trench with comfort, no one knows what you're doing nor do they care. I promise, most of us here who stealth vape in public do this.  Case in point - I took this quick picture amongst many people. No one even glanced at me http://m.imgur.com/O2aFo6P"
lbregs,34cz6n,beerandabike,9,Thu Apr 30 13:44:26 2015 UTC,"This guy gets it.  Confidence is key.  Simply tapping one hand against another, with our without an object, is not going to likely give rise to reasonable suspicion (at least at this point in history as an officer's experience with the technique and use of an mflb is likely limited and he will, at a hearing, have to specify and articulate why that gesture gave rise to his suspicion of illegal activity; no experience with mflb technique = no specific and articulable suspiction).  Shiftiness and quickly trying to hide something from an onlooker - also known as a furtive gesture - is much more likely to give rise to a reasonable suspicion of criminal activity.  Also, I try to keep my battery and launch box in separate pockets or at least unconnected in a single pcket.  The reason for this is that assuming an officer has reasonable suspicion to stop and frisk you, the frisk is justified by officer safety and is supposed to be limited to a sweep for weapons and, if the item feels like a weapon, the officer may be justified in removing it from your pocket - then the contraband, which is now plainly visible, will get you arrested.  Now, ask yourself, which feels more like a weapon -an mflb with battery inserted or a the mflb with the battery separated?  I hope the answer is obvious.  If it doesnt feel like a weapon, the officer may only remove if based on ""plain touch"" the officer can tell it is illegal.  I'm not sure an officer would be able to explain to a judge that a box and a battery plainly felt like a weapon.  All of this doesnt stop an officer from violating your rights and arresting you, but it gives you a shot at challenging the search and ""getting off"" because the mflb is excluded from evidence. No mflb = no contrband = no adjudication of guilt.  None of this is guaranteed but its about giving yourself the best chance of success in the event of a police encounter.  Also, if the officer asks you what he feels in your pocket - say nothing or "" I have no weapons on my person.""  Consult with an attorney in your jurisdiction before relying on any of this information."

lbregs,341x1z,Moreburrtitos22,3,Mon Apr 27 18:15:36 2015 UTC,The trench isn't that flimsy. I have no problem using this bad boy on it. I wouldn't put any dabber near my MFLB screw all that noise.
lbregs,341x1z,I_Submit_This,2,Mon Apr 27 22:32:42 2015 UTC,And regular dabber would require to much force/rubbing it on the trench and WILL break through it. Use a pointed dabber and gently slide the flat side up the side of the trench so the trench itself scrapes off the dab
lbregs,341x1z,I_Submit_This,4,Mon Apr 27 22:57:08 2015 UTC,That's how I use this thing. It's the same principle behind the loading spoon.

lbregs,341x1z,Moreburrtitos22,3,Mon Apr 27 23:40:17 2015 UTC,It's not a knife though. It looks sharper than it is. The tip was ground down by the crafter.
lbregs,341x1z,I_Submit_This,0,Mon Apr 27 23:09:50 2015 UTC,but it's still pointy and hard. not good when [stoopit].
lbregs,341x1z,Moreburrtitos22,4,Mon Apr 27 23:17:05 2015 UTC,I have been using the same tactical knife I use to cut paracord for 5 months as a dabber in my MD trench. Not once have I ever cut or stabbed through the trench. It's not that delicate if your not stupid with it
lbregs,341x1z,I_Submit_This,3,Mon Apr 27 22:55:11 2015 UTC,Just to clarify. My dabber is not a knife but made by a dude who makes custom knives.
lbregs,341x1z,mflbninja,-1,Mon Apr 27 23:11:19 2015 UTC,... until you are [that stupid].
lbregs,341x1z,TehFuckDoIKnow,3,Mon Apr 27 22:59:42 2015 UTC,I think there's a little confusion here you don't actually stick the point right into it. You take the knife/ dabber and let it rest flat on the side of the trench so it's just the dab touching the screen and then you rub the dab onto the screen in an upwards motion so that the dab kinda just slides onto the screen from the side of the dabber so only the flat side of the knife is touching the flat side of the screen so it isn't plopped or poked into it just rubbed onto it.
lbregs,341x1z,mflbninja,-1,Mon Apr 27 23:05:44 2015 UTC,it.is.sharper.than.an.elbow
lbregs,341x1z,I_Submit_This,2,Mon Apr 27 23:17:56 2015 UTC,What does an elbow have to do with this? You can't dab off an elbow(well you could but that shit would hurt) and it most certainly won't fit in a launch box I'm pretty sure the loading spoon they gave us with it is sharper than an elbow considering I could stab a person with the loading spoon but not an elbow
lbregs,341x1z,I_Submit_This,-1,Mon Apr 27 23:25:47 2015 UTC,that's my point ... even a pointy elbow will not fit in an MFLB ... thus it is the sharpest thing i will put in any MFLB trench.
lbregs,341x1z,Aracubus,2,Mon Apr 27 23:28:18 2015 UTC,"I agree, it is generally not a good idea to use a sharp object in a Magic-Flight vaporizer. This especially goes true for the Launch Box whose mesh cannot be replaced by the user.  However, I think this is an exception for two reasons. The first is that the M-D trenches are indeed replaceable by the user. The second is that using the flat side of a sharp knife, for example, is probably fine for people who are coordinated enough. I have never been so stoned that I broke my LB or M-D screens - I would wager lack of information breaks many more."

lbregs,33s4a9,Moon_Mist,3,Sat Apr 25 03:36:31 2015 UTC,"Explanation: Okay so I've been interested in doing a Cannabis infused alcohol, not just a tincture but something similar to like a spirit that you see with fruit in it but instead whole cannabis. I know in modern times this is called Green Dragon, but I looked up an old stoner cook book and saw that if the bud is put in green its called Green Dragon and if it is put in decarboxylated its called Golden Dragon. Most recipes I saw used ground up bud but like I said I wanted to experiment with whole bud. What I used is clear (yes it was clear not that golden color even though it says Old smoky) moonshine 100 proof. And I decarboxylated 1/4 of White Widow @ 245F for 60mins. The weight was prior to decarboxylation. Then I simply added it to the moonshine and it has sat for a week to date. After a week I experimented by taking 22ml (half a shot) off the very top no stirring or mixing of product. After 5 minutes I was sitting a solid couch lock indica [5] and so far have been cruising at that for about half an hour. Since I used White Widow I can't decide if I should call it ""White Lightning Widow"" or ""White Widow Lightning"".... ""Widow Lightning""? Heres a beautiful pic from above showing the bud at the bottom and a bright light shining from below."
lbregs,33s4a9,luceowolf,2,Sat Apr 25 02:23:06 2015 UTC,This is fantastic. I am impressed that after only a week it has become so potent. I wonder if it gets stronger the longer you leave it.

If It can get to where a shot can get me pretty goofy overall then I will consider it a success.. Just drop a shot into can of pop, lemonade or Tea and I'll have a quick sesh to go.And that will yield me a about 17 single use servings per 750ml.

These stylish and handy little clips are fashioned from wooden scraps that may otherwise have been discarded – yet another example of creation out of destruction – life out of death, so to speak. When coiled using Whip Clips, our Whips even resemble Ouroboros, as ends are connected to create circular and lemniscate forms.    Hand-carved, sanded and coated with beeswax, our Whip Clips feature a laser-etched coil design on one side and our signature Magic-Flight glyph on the other. Whether they are coiling your Water Pipe Whips for use with our Orbiter, or simply coiling a standard Draw Whip to accompany your Launch Box or Muad-dib, our new Whip Clips are ideal for a tidier, more aesthetically-pleasing vaping experience.    Although they are not yet available for stand-alone purchase, we currently offer them as an add-on option with the purchase of an Orbiter, a 2 ft. Draw Whip, or a 3 ft. Draw Whip. Check out our new Whip Clips today and make them part of your cyclical life experience.     http://blog.magic-flight.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/WC-ouroboros__cropped_20150409_165326.jpg    http://blog.magic-flight.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/orbiterwhipclipcombo.jpg    definitely cool  ... might work well for the way i'm set up, but i guess we'll hafta wait for a stand-alone option."

I love the mflb, but using the finishing grinder (which I feel is necessary to get optimal usage) is very tedious and cumbersome. I hate the extra step required to use my mflb everytime and if it was in the form of a 3 piece grinder I could do all of that ahead of time. I find myself using my mflb less and less and sometimes even smoking instead because of the extra hassle everytime I have to use it. I tried grinding up all of my herb with the finishing grinder ahead of time, but it was just a huge messy pain. As a result of this hassle I've been on the lookout for a replacement vaporizer that's more convenient. If this issue is solved I can halt my search and happily continue using your product. I have to say the grasshopper vape due to release in may looks very promising, but I love what your company stands for and the customer service of magic flight a great deal."""

I'll admit it's messy, but I'm usually working over a clean countertop and I can scrape and recover whatever goes astray. I actually use the Finishing Grinder to grind up my weed for my other vapes as well.

I can literally give a few tips and sit back and relax while they learn the device.  Before, with my main box, i HATED doing this because it meant hours of stress as I watched like a hawk for signs of combustion etc. After all, who wants to show your mates your box and come away from the experience with a blackened trench?   I have found that this way, i have actually given more back to the community. I have let a lot more people have a go and convinced a lot more to get their own. I have also loaned it out for weeks at a time to people who wanted. Again, stress free as I can rest easy that it is not my main box.  If you are like me and can't bear to let someone else combust in your box (even by accident) consider turning one over to be a loaner box. It makes you a lot friendlier and more forgiving on people who are using it for the first time.  It's also not ""final"" in any sense, you still own the box, you can still warranty it and you can still sell it later if you like.

If it comes out in a huge pile of oil you can consume that however you like. If the stem is still a bit dirty, you can push another balled paper through to get it cleaner. This paper can be vaped or smoked without too much worry, it is designed for it. However, the oil will clog an MFLB screen if you get oil on the trench.

lbregs,334lrt,I_Submit_This,5,Sun Apr 19 16:35:55 2015 UTC,"just an FYI ... kief is not green, it's blondish. what you have is kief + finely ground plant matter. do you use a coin in your grinder?    a coin is too flat, heavy and big, and will grind plant matter through the screen and dilute the kief. i keep three brass BBs in each chamber, they help loosen the kief, but because of shape and contact area, they don't grind against the screen. i use brass because it's non-magnetic and won't attach to the lid magnet in the top chamber.    depending on the size of the pass-through holes in your grinder, BBs may be too small. you can get differing sizes of plastic beads at any craft store.      http://www.imgur.com/ktBaBb6.jpeg    http://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/1bydtt/100_pure_canadian_keif/c9b8wbi"

lbregs,32ya04,mflbninja,3,Fri Apr 17 19:04:49 2015 UTC,"I don't think there's enough emphasis on not bending the lid wire. It will lose its strength over time anyway, but if it's bent on purpose it will drastically accelerate the process. Otherwise looks great, thanks for sharing!"
lbregs,32ya04,mflbninja,3,Fri Apr 17 21:56:18 2015 UTC,"I've found that it is hard to bend the pin using this method. If the lid is used as the lever, the plastic will deform and/or break before the pin moves. That being said it would not be this way if you tried to help the lid move by lifting the pin."
lbregs,32ya04,Ressotami,3,Sat Apr 18 00:31:08 2015 UTC,"I am pretty sure any time you bend the lid wire it loses strength. But perhaps you can lift it gently enough so that it remains tolerable. I think it's clear you're not bending the wire in the instructions, but if it were me I would have included a warning, just in case someone thinks they can take pliers to it. :p"
lbregs,32ya04,EnderGraff,2,Sat Apr 18 00:58:07 2015 UTC,Cheers for the xpost! This is a really helpful guide to anyone who is looking to replace or laser etch their lid.
lbregs,32ya04,mflbninja,-1,Fri Apr 17 21:05:14 2015 UTC,"What I normally do to remove my lid is slide a pen cap over the metal clip and bend it upwards, giving the lid enough leeway to wiggle free. To put it back on, just slide the lid back into place and then use the bottom of a table or something to put pressure on the base of the metal clip, bending it back into place."
lbregs,32ya04,EnderGraff,3,Fri Apr 17 21:39:33 2015 UTC,"Nooooope. Don't do this. If you bend this lid wire even once, it will lose its strength and ability to hold the lid on over time."
lbregs,32ya04,mflbninja,2,Fri Apr 17 21:53:52 2015 UTC,Noted. Thanks for the heads up.
lbregs,32ya04,bowlfortwo,1 point,Fri Apr 17 22:51:22 2015 UTC,"Saul goodman. I can never avoid getting to where I need some kind of rubber band around it, but one time I bent the thing on purpose and about three days later it didn't have any strength left at all. I stack hits which means more shaking, so a secure lid is important to me - losing herb and diverting airflow are no fun at all. I asked recently  in /r/mflb if the monocle lid of the Muad-Dib, which they now sell on a modified Launch Box, is more durable in this regard."

That's how I found Sneaky Pete's reviews which I find represent the Maud-Dib quite well.  However, before I click the ""filter"" button, this one video  (fast-forwarded to the 5-minute mark where they actually start hitting it) always appears at the top of the search results and the thumbnail alone makes me cringe.

I don't know why r/MFLB is only for questions regarding the MFLB, but not for showing how/why/where/when/ or who with you enjoy the MFLB.

lbregs,32a8vx,ForScale,2,Sun Apr 12 18:51:03 2015 UTC,"IST has told us that it is among the first things he will do once he acquires a machine other than the Nook tablet he's currently on, which for some reason limits his ability to change the /r/mflb sidebar."
lbregs,32a8vx,throwitawayfool2,3,Sun Apr 12 19:54:54 2015 UTC,"Hmm... I wonder how posting posts and comments and doing mod related activities is possible, yet making an easy change to the sidebar is not..."
lbregs,32a8vx,ForScale,2,Sun Apr 12 22:48:39 2015 UTC,"I know it's fun to hate on I_S_T, but in this case I can see it legitimately being an issue.  Mobile browsers don't always render Javascript and CSS correctly, especially a locked-down Nook.  Eh, I like to give people the benefit of the doubt if possible.  I've got my problems with I_S_T but I don't think this is one of them."
lbregs,32a8vx,throwitawayfool2,2,Mon Apr 13 01:59:50 2015 UTC,"I just find it odd that the system would operate that way. Changing the content in the sidebar doesn't require any coding or behind the scenes type of stuff... just clicking links and fields, typing, and clicking a button to save it... pretty much the same as commenting."
lbregs,32a8vx,ForScale,3,Mon Apr 13 03:01:37 2015 UTC,"I have no personal experience with the Reddit moderating system so you're probably right and I'm talking out of my ass.  If it's the same as commenting, then yeah a Nook should be able to handle that no problem.  In that sense, it could simply be a delay tactic by I_S_T; I wouldn't put it past him to delay modifying the sidebar for no good reason; it's kinda expected of him at this point.  By the way, I recognize your name and how you often provide really helpful advice in vaporizer-related threads.  Thanks for that man; Reddit needs more people like you! :D"
lbregs,32a8vx,throwitawayfool2,1 point,Mon Apr 13 04:10:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I don't know... I was just curious. I'm no expert, but I do know that changing the text/links in the sidebar is pretty easy/nothing out of the ordinary.  Thanks, man! Glad to have you over here in /r/lbregs!"
lbregs,3297ds,flamingjoints,2,Sat Apr 11 18:47:32 2015 UTC,The hempwick on your box seems like an inefficient choice. Why do you have it on there?
lbregs,3297ds,tokoum,2,Sat Apr 11 20:14:21 2015 UTC,Isn't a good choice. Out of rubber bands and just needed it to stay closed. It'll take me forever to finish this trench so I won't have to worry for a  while xD
lbregs,3297ds,tokoum,2,Sat Apr 11 20:22:47 2015 UTC,Oh right on. I forgot that some boxes don't stay shut reliably.
lbregs,3297ds,Foul_Actually,2,Sat Apr 11 20:40:04 2015 UTC,"It does, I just like it locked shut. When it's banded it's a lot more secure. It's not fun to have the box open and bud fall out."

lbregs,328fhm,iiaii,5,Sat Apr 11 14:45:15 2015 UTC,Mflb is the only vape worth a damn imo
lbregs,328fhm,SP120K,5,Sat Apr 11 19:46:06 2015 UTC,"I have a cloud v phantom, a mflb, a pax, and a crafty and I have to say the pax is at the bottom of my list. Pax is a good beginners vape but it's so over priced and uses so much bud. Imo the mflb is better than all of them except the crafty but the crafty was also 4 times the price of the mflb"
lbregs,328fhm,Moreburrtitos22,2,Sat Apr 11 19:43:27 2015 UTC,"I hear really good things about the crafty/mighty, although I'm very interested in the Grasshopper. The MFLB is the only vape I've actually owned, but I've never had the need to buy anything else over the years."
lbregs,328fhm,compoundbreak791,3,Sat Apr 11 20:34:38 2015 UTC,Really people all doubt the mflb and don't spend enough time trying to figure it out. Mastering the mflb makes it the best vape there is because it is the smallest one there is and it's the cheapest. It just takes around 1 month of constant use to get it perfect. Had mine for 4 years and still use it daily
lbregs,328fhm,Moreburrtitos22,2,Sat Apr 11 21:30:00 2015 UTC,"Absolutely correct. People in /r/vaporents don't want to hear it, but the Launch Box is the only vape anyone ever really needs. With its lifetime warranty, it'll be with you for much longer too."
lbregs,328fhm,mflbninja,3,Sat Apr 11 23:13:28 2015 UTC,Yeah I feel like they have big wallets over there lol. $119 for life? Thank you Magic Flight.

lbregs,328fhm,mflbninja,1 point,Sat Apr 11 20:02:12 2015 UTC,"I have an MFLB. I also have a Pax. MFLB blows the Pax out of the water in every way except in simplicity of use, being inconspicuous in public, and having a charged battery.   I agree with the ""use the mflb for a month and you'll see it'd the best vape."" So true. Pass it off to a friend though and you might have combustion in your box.   Pretty much the whole thing is A.) Are you vaping to conserve? Get the mflb. B.) Are you vaping with buddies/in public often? Get the Pax."
lbregs,328fhm,_dabnation_,2,Sat Apr 11 23:23:07 2015 UTC,Dude I've had it for 4 years and I still combust it on occasion when I get a little too lifted but nothing a little iso can't fix.
lbregs,328fhm,Moreburrtitos22,2,Sat Apr 11 23:28:25 2015 UTC,"Mmmm true dat, true dat. I combust once in a while too. The only difference is when a friend combusts, they panic and try to put it out via drawing faster though the straw."
lbregs,328fhm,_dabnation_,2,Sat Apr 11 23:32:37 2015 UTC,Ik man I just tell my friends if they see smoke just dump it out as fast as they can
lbregs,328fhm,Moreburrtitos22,1 point,Sun Apr 12 00:17:25 2015 UTC,"I haven't used the Pax in over a year. I should sell it but I just charged it up and let a friend borrow it. Two excellent things about the MFLB are the lack of smell (the pax reeks!) and the speed of heat (the pax takes FOREVER). These are two critical factors if you are trying to do a quick, stealthy hit. I'd have to wait and eternity for the PAX ;-)"
lbregs,328fhm,KnightWarden,1 point,Sun Apr 12 00:38:41 2015 UTC,"Love this pic. Take that, mflb haters"
lbregs,328fhm,RavingGerbil,1 point,Mon Apr 13 03:29:02 2015 UTC,Please don't hurt me. This is my first time here. The pax is awesome when it comes to capping it and putting it in your pocket. The Mflb is dope for sitting and toking.  I have not love both and accept that there are different applications for both. The pax stays in my pocket the Mflb stays in my room. I pax during the day and Mflb during the night. They are both sick vaporizers with different use cases. Can we stop the pax hate? This seems like the console/pc debate but with weed stuff.
lbregs,328fhm,RavingGerbil,1 point,Sat Apr 18 06:30:46 2015 UTC,"Actually, it wasn't a hate post at all. Just my opinion on using both. I posted my reasons why. I hear you on the portability. However, I use a sucrets box for the MFLB and it's not too bad. The pax reeked so much I had to put it in a small case. That made it a bit bulkier. Again, that's just my situation."

lbregs,320c1w,FlyingDane,2,Thu Apr 9 15:44:38 2015 UTC,First a small trench of some sweet tasting guerilla grown Royal Dane to get in the groove. Then out in the heather covered Gallows Hills (Galgebakkerne v. Ry for the Danes) searching for male vipers (Vipera berus).  In early spring vipers can be found in the morning sun warming up their bodies to ripe their sperm. We found at least 12 different specimens that morning. A few of them still cold enough to let us get close enough to photograph them.
lbregs,320c1w,I_Submit_This,2,Thu Apr 9 15:45:15 2015 UTC,inB4     to ripe their sperm.   with what ... IDK ... but i was here with it FIRST!!! DAMMIT.
lbregs,320c1w,beerandabike,1 point,Thu Apr 9 16:10:42 2015 UTC,"He he. As my initial comment probably shows English is just a secondary language for me, but as you all  probably know snakes are ectothermic or cold blooded. So after a looog cold winter their tiny viper balls are absolutely deep frozen. The warmth  from the sun helps them ripen (maturing?) their sperm, just like it helps with all other body functions like digesting food etc.   In July you can find the female vipers sun bathing when they are riping (maturing?) their eggs. Same story but less giggleable word. ;)"
lbregs,320c1w,ADHDABE,5,Thu Apr 9 17:23:35 2015 UTC,"Bwahahaha tiny viper balls! There's been a few times this past winter that I had tiny viper balls, glad spring is here finally!"

lbregs,320c1w,SP120K,1 point,Thu Apr 9 18:15:03 2015 UTC,Some sandy hills in central Denmark. The hills are mainly covered by heather and sporadic small trees. This viper was basking on some old oak leaves taking cover from birds under the small branches of the oak.

I always let the build-up get to a point where I determine it to be enough and I scrape what I can reach with my straightened pen spring and dabber and then with the rest I just clean it with ISO and no salt, then pour out the ISO and let evap. Did it last night and I got close to a half gram of dabs just from ""dirty"" glass.   Key point: if you vape or dab through a piece, the residue is very potent and should be reclaimed!!"

But I believe if you're sure you are in control of how much you take, you can drive indeed. Consider the warning on certain medicines: they tell you not to drive or operate heavy machinery, until you are aware of how the substance affects you. Valium and Percocet are some strong pharms, but they both have thresholds beneath which it's safe to drive even in rush hour traffic. Likewise, if you are certain about the potency of your edibles and you take only enough, it should be just as safe."

With just kief it clumps together and makes that hard to accomplish. By putting stems in the trench you give the kief something to bond to when it warms up that isn't itself, the surface of the stems. This helps improve the surface area of the kief and you get the added bonus of being able to vape the stems at the same time."

Then, after that, if you still have any questions ask again.   For the next while you're going to be adjusting your technique. Also, a joint for me is usually a gram or more. The trench holds ~.25g so if you're trying to compare it to a joint, vape 4 trenches and get back to me. Let me know how you're feeling. Also, when you are vaping, how dark are you getting your bud?"

Make sure to shake it/knock it around between hits.  And, you probably already know, but you don't hit it like a bowl or joint.  You kind of take little hits and hold em in.  But everybody seems to have their own technique that works best for them.  Just experiment and see what works for you!

lbregs,30nycf,ForScale,2,Sun Mar 29 05:24:20 2015 UTC,"Basically, I made a bubbler. I just put my lips over the mouth of the bottle and inhale while engaging the PA. Works beautifully.   Edit: Apparently the functionality is kinda vague, so I made a diagram. First. This picture is the same as the above picture, just drawn out on snapchat. Second. As I inhale from the mouth of the bottle (purple), the vacuum draws vapor through the whip from the MFLB (red). The vapor's only path to go is down the tube, into the water, then out to my lungs. I basically put the down stem and draw stem in the same hole while still keeping functionality."

When I was in my teens and 20s (back in the 1970s-1980s), I played ultimate frisbee and also mainly just tossed a frisbee around, at a time that disc golf wasn't even a thing around where I live.  The cool thing about disc golf is that while in stick golf, I've always played with more focus on the shot I just screwed up, and there was a lot of tension and stress, in disc golf, there's more of a ""hmm, that wasn't a good throw!"" without there being any downside.  Go find it and throw it again. And you really enjoy the great throw a lot more.  It's really helped me enjoy stick golf more, with the newfound attitude.  The other thing, except for the jerks who leave empty beercans all over the course, for the most part, I've never met an asshole or jerk playing disc golf but at a stick golf course, the assholes and jerks are in more plentiful supply!  One of the similarities between the two games, with the well struck ball or the well thrown disc, time seems to go into slow motion as your eyes track the ball/disc in flight, very pleasurable part of the games, that have you coming back for more."

lbregs,2zxxs7,aurora135,3,Sun Mar 22 21:43:09 2015 UTC,Its primarily because its discreet. Also cools vapor.

lbregs,2zxxs7,3bun,2,Mon Mar 23 00:13:54 2015 UTC,"This just gave me an idea, could you hit the box backwards through the air intake? Granted its not as big as the stem hole but doesit work?"
lbregs,2zxxs7,FlamingAssCactus,3,Mon Mar 23 15:56:03 2015 UTC,"If you like getting particulate plant matter in your mouth, it's a swell idea."
lbregs,2zxxs7,wean_fean,1 point,Tue Mar 24 20:50:23 2015 UTC,Yes. But its wasteful as you can't without mods that will block other air intakes on the back.
lbregs,2zxxs7,MorganTreemann,1 point,Mon Mar 23 18:04:04 2015 UTC,well the other hole isn't the normal intake and just goes to the battery. I'm sure you could get some vapor through but it probably wouldn't make the best vortex so maybe not as efficient.

That thing on my stem is simply a pen cap to keep lint, dust, and bugs out of it. I made a stupidly simple guide if you wanna check it out :)"
lbregs,2zrnva,9delta9,1 point,Sat Mar 21 05:20:40 2015 UTC,"oh thats cool, good way to keep lint out.  I still like that kozy idea though :)"
lbregs,2zpl3m,thatonephotoshopguy,39,Fri Mar 20 15:53:21 2015 UTC,Yep... He's the one and only mod over there and he's said time and time again that he's not gonna change anything.  That's why we've got this place!
lbregs,2zpl3m,ForScale,19,Fri Mar 20 16:12:31 2015 UTC,"That's pretty much why lbregs was created. /r/mflb is more Q&A, wiki, forum etc whatever you want to call it, to help out new people, because the MFLB isn't the most simple thing at first. But now we have this one, for those of us who are far gone from the beginner stages of flight!"
lbregs,2zpl3m,IAmAMustardAMA,1 point,Fri Mar 20 16:38:35 2015 UTC,"People are directed to the search and sidebar because most questions have been asked and answered already. Posts are deleted because of rule violations and the like. His ""hiatus"", wherein he continued to shadow-mod from time to time, was due to problems related to his health and money situation - pretty much the polar opposite of the cruise he was rumored to have gone on."
lbregs,2zpl3m,mflbninja,4,Fri Mar 20 17:06:44 2015 UTC,"I deleted my above comment because I went into more detail below.  Why should people have to search for answers or look at wikis? Why can't the community help each other out and build a strong sub? If the users don't want to help newbies, then down votes would show that. He doesn't give a choice because it's ""his sub"" which is against the very idea of reddit.   Edit: I didn't realize this was you. I read a lot of your posts this AM and it seems you are starting to side with him."
lbregs,2zpl3m,ProbablyImpossible,7,Fri Mar 20 17:13:44 2015 UTC,I don't get this attitude at all. I think it is incredibly annoying in any kind of discussion where someone posts a question that they themselves could have found with 1 minute of searching. I am pretty sure that the reason people should have to search for answers and look at wikis is because that is the best way to learn things. Questions should be for things that can not easily be answered by the normal means (searching and reading) and require specialized knowledge.
lbregs,2zpl3m,ProbablyImpossible,8,Fri Mar 20 17:16:18 2015 UTC,"Again , his erasing of posts isn't even my main problem. I couldn't care less. It's how he responds to subscribers questioning him , and his general attitude towards everyone he comments on."
lbregs,2zpl3m,choochtown,9,Sat Mar 21 02:10:47 2015 UTC,Gahd.  I am so done with r/MFLB.  Disappearing comments and threads preemptively kills all attempts at discussion.  Fuck that noise.  It might as well be a static wiki.    Jumping to r/lbregs.
lbregs,2zpl3m,tlex42,7,Sat Mar 21 03:40:14 2015 UTC,"As someone who is new to reddit and /r/mflb, I have mixed feelings.  I believe that the content rules and posting rules make sense for the sub.  What I am annoyed by is that IST enforces the ""civility"" clause too much.  It makes for a difficult conversation when half of it disappears.  It also seems that he has zero tolerance for negativity around Magic Flight or its products, which means that we can't really complain about anything there.    I like the idea of a community that is friendly and welcoming.  I even feel that way to a large extent about /r/mflb.  I am glad, however, that this sub here exists."
lbregs,2zpl3m,frigginwizard,19,Sat Mar 21 20:08:03 2015 UTC,"If you want an MFLB wiki, thats basically what /r/mflb is, if you dont, dont go there. Stop thinking of it as a community, and start thinking of it as a website. Because this kind of stuff doesnt change anything."
lbregs,2zpl3m,_omelet_,26,Sat Mar 21 00:24:12 2015 UTC,"Then he should moderate a wiki. Reddit is a forum, there is interaction and a sense of community here. He does the largest mflb sub a disservice by treating it like a wiki."
lbregs,2zpl3m,Ressotami,10,Fri Mar 20 16:07:41 2015 UTC,You are describing how things ought to be in your opinion. There are no rules that subreddits must be run one way or another. As long as they do not breach the Reddit TOS then they can be run as relaxed or as oppressive as the mod team wish.  /r/MFLB has strict rules which are enforced. We can argue all day about whether that is right or not but that is how things are.  He does a disservice to those that want a picture/stories/off topic MFLB sub. Yes I agree. He does. But that has never been the remit of MFLB. It's always been an informational sub for newbies and perhaps you have just grown out of that a little bit.  You are now a regular so why not enjoy your more off topic posting in the correct forum? That's what we're here for ;-)
lbregs,2zpl3m,frigginwizard,7,Fri Mar 20 16:41:36 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying its ideal, just that it is the way it is, and throwing a stink about it has only led to it getting worse, not better. Like it or not, if someone is the only mod of a subreddit, it is essentially theirs. Reddit allows them to run the sub however they want as long as they dont break the reddit rules, and he doesnt."
lbregs,2zpl3m,PsychoKiller-fafafa,5,Fri Mar 20 17:09:19 2015 UTC,"People. You need to understand that /r/MFLB is actually promoted by magic flight as a place people can go with questions. Just because you don't want the rules to be the way they are doesn't mean they should change for you. Like another user here said, its like a forum. Like it or not, this is the way things should probably stay. It is a great resource for quick Q&A with the experienced community."
lbregs,2zpl3m,2b2s2f2g,7,Fri Mar 20 16:54:06 2015 UTC,"The guy that runs it does not work for them though. They would also ""promote"" it if it was a properly run sub with few moderators for a good system of checks and balances."
lbregs,2zpl3m,defsubsucks,8,Sat Mar 21 08:06:17 2015 UTC,"Why are people getting so butthurt over this... Even though that sub is named /r/mflb, it's only for Q&A or discussion about the box. Anything else should go in this sub, which you should promote not out of spite but because this is where those posts belong.  You posted to the wrong sub, the mod deleted it and let you know (or you already know) where you should post that content to. Why do people feel like they're getting fucked over or being told their content is bad, it's not, it just belongs in a different sub..."
lbregs,2zpl3m,ProbablyImpossible,8,Sat Mar 21 15:43:11 2015 UTC,"Reddit is a community and forum. Why does the opinion of 1 power thirsty man matter more than the 20,000+ subscribers? He should let up votes and down votes dictate content, not his narrow views on acceptable and irrelevant. It's a huge shame the way he runs it, and apparently Magic Flight promotes the sub. It should be welcoming and warm. He creates a place where fun is impossible. He takes his mod position WAY too seriously and the sub suffers for it. He did not create /r/MFLB. He has been mod there for 2 (?) years now, and it's gone severely downhill in that time. He is childish, condescending, and often a complete ass to subscribers. I don't get how MF allows their company to be associated with such a place."
lbregs,2zpl3m,ForScale,7,Fri Mar 20 16:41:26 2015 UTC,"Hey!  Yep, I agree with you!  I don't think a one person mod ""team"" is a good thing...  it's a dictatorship.  Personally, I've always found the voting/democracy aspect of reddit to be one of its coolest/most powerful features.  It's kind of lost when there's just one person running the show.  But... it is what it is... I got tired of trying to understand the purpose of the rules over there and quibbling over there merit.  Glad we have this place now!"
lbregs,2zpl3m,ProbablyImpossible,5,Fri Mar 20 17:13:32 2015 UTC,"For sure. He's unwilling to take on new mods who don't agree with his mod style. It won't change, and that's fine."
lbregs,2zpl3m,ForScale,4,Fri Mar 20 17:24:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah, as long as I've been subbed over there...  It's only been him.  I've never seen call outs for additional mods or anything either... at least not that I can recall... and definitely not ones that produced additional mods; still just him.  And I used to try to discuss the rules with him, but he's made it pretty clear that he's not going to change anything over there.  Unfortunate, but it is what it is, I suppose."
lbregs,2zpl3m,ProbablyImpossible,7,Fri Mar 20 17:29:15 2015 UTC,"Oh, he's explained his sole mod-ship before. I'm paraphrasing, but it went something to the tune of - ""I've looked into adding additional mods but have not found anyone who has the same morals and ideas for this sub as me. Feel free to apply with me."" Basically he doesn't want to share his power, and won't allow another old to undermine him."
lbregs,2zpl3m,_omelet_,4,Fri Mar 20 17:40:22 2015 UTC,"I mean, its hard to tell if there have been calls for mods and rule changes when he practices pretty serious censorship."
lbregs,2zpl3m,ForScale,4,Fri Mar 20 17:51:32 2015 UTC,This is true.
lbregs,2zpl3m,defsubsucks,8,Fri Mar 20 23:26:15 2015 UTC,"It's like people are fighting over the name of the sub in which they post... It sounds to me like you want /r/mflb to allow the same type of posts as /r/lbregs. So why don't you post them in /r/lbregs? Because you'll get less karma? If that's the case maybe try /r/vaporents or /r/trees... Otherwise maybe just try to help make /r/lbregs be more like whatever it is that you like so much about /r/mflb other than its name...  Another option you have is taking this up to MF, this isn't their official forum and IST isn't an employee, but they support the sub and direct customers there. This is exactly why it should be run the way it is IMHO, but tell your side to MF and maybe they can reason with IST or also direct to /r/lbregs or whatever will make people happy."
lbregs,2zpl3m,ProbablyImpossible,7,Sat Mar 21 18:10:51 2015 UTC,"Here's my position. I don't post content, ever. I up vote/down vote as I please and sometimes chime in if I REALLY feel I have something to add. I love reddit because of it's content and sense of community. To have a company direct their customers, likely first time vapers, to a sub that's in the condition that /r/MFLB is in is wrong. They should be able to expect a warm welcome, helpful information, and to maybe make a new friend or 2. With his mod style, none of that is possible. IST should create his own sub/wiki and be a dictator there. He has taken the ""official"" Magic Flight sub and turned it into Joffrey's throne room. That's EXACTLY how he acts.    Ps- if you have ever interacted with IST you'd know there is no ""reasoning"" with him. He is set in his stubborn ways. I assume this website is the majority of his real life."
lbregs,2zpl3m,defsubsucks,3,Fri Mar 20 17:29:16 2015 UTC,"Actually, my first post ever was on /r/mflb (I was a lurker), and he deleted one of my first comments on that sub. The reason was that I suggested a ""mod"" I made on my box to someone else, but that mod could interfere with proper box operation if you're not aware of the risk.   So he deleted my post and PMed my why. I then edited my post with proper precautions, messaged him, and he approved my message comment. We then exchanged pleasantries in PM and I had 0 problems with him since.  I get where you're coming from with the ""hostile modding"" feel, it can make a bad impression on a new user. Maybe I just don't see most of these post you guys refer to (admittedly I don't look at the ""new"" page, just frontpage), because all I notice is him saying ""this has been asked before, search this sub for this keyword"", or ""this isn't the place for pictures of your box, try lbregs"", and things of that nature.  Imagine how much harder his work would be if he let the same 30 questions be asked over and over again. Every time it's answered, 2 out of 10 people will give misinformation without realizing, just trying to help. Then someone new comes along and reads the misinformation thinking it's legit. Only later the regulars come and correct the information. It can cause problems for new people. I've seen people recommend the craziest shit there before getting deleted.   Not to mention that 90% of the posts will be the same questions."
lbregs,2zpl3m,ProbablyImpossible,13,Fri Mar 20 17:35:56 2015 UTC,"Frankly, I don't really care how he mods to be honest. He can erase whatever he wants and it wouldn't matter to me. It's the way he responds to criticism, and the posts he makes. He sounds like a bitter old man lecturing his class."
lbregs,2zpl3m,Ressotami,-2,Fri Mar 20 17:50:01 2015 UTC,Exactly right. And it's a shame you are being downvoted because what you have said is very sensible.  I get stuff deleted quite often from /r/trees. Why? Because random photos and crap belongs in /r/see. I sometimes forget this and have to re-post. Does this annoy me? No. I posted in a forum that is not tolerant of that content and so it gets removed.  You guys have gotta let this go. Pictures and stories go here. Q and A and MFLB discussion go in MFLB. It seems really simple to me...
lbregs,2zpl3m,2b2s2f2g,7,Fri Mar 20 18:09:55 2015 UTC,"You're saying ""just follow the rules, guys!"".  We're saying the rules are stupid, and need changing.   That's why it seems simple to you."
lbregs,2zpl3m,defsubsucks,-3,Fri Mar 20 17:12:06 2015 UTC,"Why do you feel the need to change the rules, rather than post here on lbregs where everything you want to post and read is allowed?"
lbregs,2zpl3m,Dcomplex,1 point,Sat Mar 21 15:49:34 2015 UTC,So go elsewhere.   The mod does a great job and has created a distinct and valuable resource.   There are plenty of other places where you can wander off topic let's make sure we keep this subreddit the way it is.
lbregs,2zpl3m,TheEvilGerman,1 point,Sat Mar 21 16:42:59 2015 UTC,There sure is a very light circle jerk going on in here. Im afraid to comment.
lbregs,2zpl3m,Moon_Mist,8,Fri Mar 20 21:16:27 2015 UTC,I think there's a bit of pent up frustration. There hasn't really been a place for these kind of posts for a while.
lbregs,2zpl3m,burberry_diaper,2,Fri Mar 20 22:22:31 2015 UTC,It's like they're just jerking the tip.

lbregs,2zs2fg,9delta9,8,Sat Mar 21 04:52:43 2015 UTC,"I noticed this too after I had my first box warrantied. I'm pretty sure it's due to the lack of oil buildup on and beneath the trench that accumulates with time. Because the mesh's pores are completely clear, it causes better airflow through the Box."
lbregs,2zs2fg,wisebeardedman,4,Sat Mar 21 06:40:53 2015 UTC,"Dart stems add some class I want to get one. Congrats with the hotter, better box too!"
lbregs,2zs2fg,SP120K,6,Sat Mar 21 05:13:14 2015 UTC,"It's nicer than I expected, the bigger surface area at the end is more easier to use than the glass stem. indubitably."
lbregs,2zs2fg,Moon_Mist,3,Sat Mar 21 06:02:54 2015 UTC,"I'd agree with /u/wisebeardedman. I also notice when I do a really deep cleaning on the box, it tends to hit stronger for a while too. I'd imagine a new box is even a stronger difference."
lbregs,2zpr1n,9delta9,2,Fri Mar 20 16:39:14 2015 UTC,"A few posts were deleted from /r/mflb as per the 'no massdrop ever!!11' rule, so i'm posting it here for those who might be interested in the deal (keep in mind it doesn't ship for about 20 days)."
lbregs,2zpr1n,throwitawayfool2,2,Fri Mar 20 16:42:27 2015 UTC,"Thanks for posting.  Since the drop is limited to 40 units, they're about to sell out.  Anyone seeing this, grab one quick!  I'm still not quite sure what the ""official"" stance is on MassDrop warrantees now that MFLB doesn't want anyone selling below the MSRP, but since the glass wouldn't have been covered in 2015 anyway I'm fine with that possible trade-off for the $25 savings."
lbregs,2zq7ni,mflbninja,6,Fri Mar 20 18:46:20 2015 UTC,"I agree with the other commenters. Thanks for your efforts, enjoy the break and take a step back."

The pics I posted of the walnut MFLB last night had a trench full after grinding with the FG.  It's certainly a premium grinder but nicely fits exactly on top of the trench so you can grind as much as you need with no spillage."

lbregs,2zo6l3,rvgreen,1 point,Fri Mar 20 23:37:22 2015 UTC,"It can be used with solid nugs broken up by hand, but not well.  I'd highly recommend using a normal grinder first."
lbregs,2zo6l3,throwitawayfool2,1 point,Sat Mar 21 04:09:29 2015 UTC,my stuff is quite dry already so it crumbles easily into the FG and works fine.
lbregs,2zo6l3,9delta9,1 point,Sat Mar 21 04:43:16 2015 UTC,Oh god yes
lbregs,2zo6l3,96GMC4x4,1 point,Fri Mar 20 12:42:39 2015 UTC,The FG does significantly improve the quality of your material and is well worth it.   I found it was a good step up in quality and when you consider the price generally paid for weed - it makes sound financial sense to maximise the benefits of each trench.

lbregs,2zoz6y,Vitus_VIII,6,Fri Mar 20 12:53:11 2015 UTC,And the toilet bowl was...full
lbregs,2zoz6y,9delta9,6,Fri Mar 20 13:11:28 2015 UTC,"given that, yeah.. RIP the reclaim.  You're building for a new day now!    btw is there much difference in effect between reclaim and say, a teaspoon of ABV?  Aside from not having to injest the plant material.."
lbregs,2zoz6y,tlex42,2,Fri Mar 20 14:41:21 2015 UTC,My reclaim is much stronger than abv by volume lol. A pea sized amount of reclaim in my coffee and I'm buzzing for hours like 1.5g of my abv. It all depends on how you vape though
lbregs,2zoz6y,mflbninja,3,Fri Mar 20 14:45:17 2015 UTC,"True.  Ideally your reclaim would be about... umm.. 16 times as strong?  I am assuming starting with about 20% THC weed, and vaping it to about 5% THC ABV.  Reclaim is about 80% THC.  These numbers are completely made up, but they sound good."

lbregs,2zoz6y,Moon_Mist,2,Fri Mar 20 12:40:16 2015 UTC,Personally I wouldn't have given it a second thought. A lot of work and love went into that honey oil.    I would have used it and then felt slightly bad about myself... until the high kicked in.

lbregs,2zrik9,burberry_diaper,8,Sat Mar 21 01:21:02 2015 UTC,MFLBGate?   I dont think this is the case by the way.  He's retired on a fixed income I understand. MF is helping him out with some free gear so he doesnt have to worry about buying the latest products and to say thanks for IST's hours and hours of Mod'ing.  Being a medicinal user I'm sure he's got some useful feedback for them on the beta gear.  Like him or not you cant say he doesn't keep an eye on his sub multiple times a day.

lbregs,2zmjzg,Moon_Mist,2,Thu Mar 19 21:44:29 2015 UTC,Haha I've broken mine multiple times
lbregs,2zlatu,mflbninja,10,Thu Mar 19 15:10:02 2015 UTC,I prefer separate because I see the MFLB sub as an unofficial Web forum for the MFLB. Mainly because it's linked in the guide.
lbregs,2zlatu,ADHDABE,3,Thu Mar 19 15:58:25 2015 UTC,"I have a feeling that what you said is IST's reasoning for such strict moderation. I know for a fact that MFLB is in contact with him, so I'm sure they want it more informational for new users and persuasive for potential users."
lbregs,2zlatu,wisebeardedman,3,Thu Mar 19 16:06:04 2015 UTC,Completely agree with both of you
lbregs,2zlatu,beerandabike,7,Thu Mar 19 17:04:01 2015 UTC,"Thanks for posting this, mflbninja. I think you have some really great ideas in here. It seems that the direction we are headed in right now is two separate subs, but I can see that working out. /r/mflb will be mainly questions regarding operation of the LB and /r/lbregs will be for passion, creativity, and love surrounding our use of the Box through art, pictures, and of course text posts. One thing I might suggest is having stickied mega threads every few days for specific ""photo shoots"", like one for traveling with the LB, what type of bud currently being used in the LB, creative alterations to the LB, etc. Maybe even have some of them be friendly contests. However I know the mods are people too and can't devote a ton of time, so this is merely a suggestion :)"
lbregs,2zlatu,wisebeardedman,3,Thu Mar 19 15:37:00 2015 UTC,I think you're onto something! I like the mini contests ideas. Over in /r/diy_ejuice/ one of the mods (or maybe just well know guy) would run monthly contests based around a certain flavor. Like you mentioned it could be fun as a community to have a photo contest over certain aspects such as how to use your mflb on the go or something of the sort.
lbregs,2zlatu,beerandabike,5,Thu Mar 19 16:05:01 2015 UTC,"First of all like others have said, props for opening this up for discussion. I agree with your pro/con list, and to me it looks like the cons outweigh the pros. If someone wants a combined sub, why not use a multireddit really? You get to see both subs in one page. Only when you want to submit a post, you need to stop and think which sub to submit to, and it's really not that hard...  This way /r/mflb stays the informative quick Q&A community it is and /r/lbregs remains the hangout of the users, and if someone wants to, they can view them all in one page. Sounds like a win-win-win to me, and that's the best option in Dunder Miffiln's conflict resolution folder."
lbregs,2zlatu,defsubsucks,5,Thu Mar 19 16:26:00 2015 UTC,"Quite frankly, /r/mflb scares me due to the sticky attitude that is required there. I love how laid back this sub is, it's a safe haven for all MFLB enthusiasts."
lbregs,2zlatu,MorganTreemann,2,Thu Mar 19 17:24:19 2015 UTC,I think I've said it before... I'm gonna say it again...  Love the username!
lbregs,2zlatu,ForScale,4,Fri Mar 20 12:46:35 2015 UTC,"Just my two cents for only a 3 month old mflb user: /r/mflb/ was a very great place for me to learn about the product before buying it, making a very informed purchase decision, and I know it'll be a very good place to refer to for troubleshooting and a sub that I still browse to see if anyone's posted any neat hacks or tips they've come across.  I the  stumbled upon this sub and immediately subscribed because I know I'll want to shoot the shit with other LB'ers about out MF products. Also being a photographer I like making images with my new love of a product and here's a perfect place to share that with others who (hopefully) enjoy my pictures.  Could I get more eyes on my posts over there? Sure, yea. But I know over there is for a certain reason that works very well and here is just an equally great place for other reasons such as stories, pictures, etc.  I love to break/bend rules, believe me, but I also like how MF directly lists /r/mflb/ in their guide to go to for extra knowledge and support on using their devices. Let's just help the masses come over here and be... Regulars."
lbregs,2zlatu,beerandabike,3,Thu Mar 19 16:02:08 2015 UTC,"I'm resigned to the fact that there isn't going to be any change, but I would like to contest the cons. /r/keto has a great system for tagging and photo management, they also have a steady stream of newbies who need a lot of guidance - this is managed through a really great FAQ, sidebar, and helpful users. They also have five times the suscribers that /r/mflb has and there doesn't seem to be a moderation issue. I don't actually know what you mean by gallery, I searched and nothing came up? I'm a visual artist and would really enjoy a dedicated gallery for custom jobs, art and photos."
lbregs,2zlatu,reaperteddy,1 point,Thu Mar 19 21:21:19 2015 UTC,"The sub is the ever-expanding gallery. That's why it's awesome, literally no search is needed - just come here and start scrolling. As for mod issues..."
lbregs,2zlatu,reaperteddy,2,Fri Mar 20 01:36:47 2015 UTC,So you think more users means more text posts? I don't really get it.
lbregs,2zlatu,reaperteddy,1 point,Fri Mar 20 02:56:40 2015 UTC,"Hmm, maybe we're misunderstanding each other. What I'm saying is that /r/lbregs is itself a dedicated gallery of photos and stories, with the occasional meta thread. The posts typically end up being over 90% photos, so that's why I call it a gallery. When a bunch are lined up next to each other it's a sight to behold."
lbregs,2zlatu,isded12floz,2,Fri Mar 20 03:29:37 2015 UTC,"Ohhh. I use RES with images enabled so everything always looks picture heavy to me, even in subs with few picture posts they really stand out."

lbregs,2zjhay,Lmt_P,3,Thu Mar 19 22:02:46 2015 UTC,I think you did a disservice to your opportunity to grow by defending ist a little too heavily in that thread. He (like that awful sub) has innumerable flaws that you glossed over or ignored completely.

lbregs,2zgoz3,beerandabike,1 point,Wed Mar 18 13:10:07 2015 UTC,Looks like you have taped your battery? Does this not interfere with the battery connection ring within the box?
lbregs,2zgoz3,Ressotami,3,Wed Mar 18 17:23:11 2015 UTC,"It's just a narrow strip of electrical tape. I put the battery in positive side in to measure length and then put the tape about 1mm up from that to take account for the battery pushing in. Doesn't interfere at all except when I put the battery in backwards for travel, but then it doesn't matter since I don't want to make any kind of connection anyhow. I do this to keep track of which battery is which charge-wise.  In the picture the battery is actually backwards, but shhh that's behind the scenes info.  Edit: P.S. Good on you for asking questions hahaha!"
lbregs,2zgoz3,Ressotami,3,Wed Mar 18 17:26:46 2015 UTC,Nice idea! It's always a pain to track them otherwise.   Magic Flight would do well to make battery caps in a variety of colours. I'd buy a pack.

lbregs,2zaoj7,beerandabike,2,Tue Mar 17 00:30:33 2015 UTC,"My dog died a few days ago, but before he got sick he pulled me around on a bungee harness on my bike. He wasn't powerful enough to do it on his own, so I pedaled too, but he made it noticeably easier at times. We were a team, riding the trails and sidewalks of the suburbs, to his delight every single time. He was quieter than a gas motor with less air pollution, not as finicky as an electric motor, and came with a personality - a talking car if you will.  And the bungee harness made it easy, though it was also possible to do it by riding one-handed, the other one around a long ass leash attached to his collar. He pulled me by his neck and didn't even mind, though I had to get him the harness after hearing him cough a few times during the ride. The harness made it so I could almost forget about the dog. Even though I never will."
lbregs,2zaoj7,mflbninja,2,Tue Mar 17 17:34:50 2015 UTC,"Really sorry to hear that! Sounds like he was a really solid, loyal and great friend. I used to have a chihuahua who was also a super good friend, but of course she wasn't big enough to lead the pack like that let alone even keep up. I would take her out on hikes though. I'm sure it was a strange sight for people to see me hiking with a chihuahua, but she kept up and enjoyed the outings all the time.  I'm glad that this picture made you think of the good times though!"
lbregs,2zaoj7,mflbninja,2,Tue Mar 17 21:24:58 2015 UTC,"Definitely was a great friend and I loved him. It's just too bad they have to have such short lives; but I hope I was able to make his life better while he was around. Thanks for posting this, it did make me think of the good times, of which there were plenty to be had.  Some of my favorite times were when we took him on vacation, to the beach and to this resort town. We would take him out so he could do his business and all he could do was check out the other dogs' markings. And on the beach his sole interest was scaring up the birds - though I did manage to keep him back but it wasn't easy. :p"

Because the FG works with a cheese-grater like action, you need to have your herb BONE dry for maximum effect or it gets all clogged with oils and kief.

I got my walnut MD for $119 from the Connoisseurs' Club.  That said, I have already converted two old warranty boxes into dab boxes simply by making a cut through about 2/3 the length of the trench. Then only the corner heats up, and it's hot. I wouldn't recommend doing that these days when the replaceable trenches are around, but it was fun all the same."
lbregs,2xdrv6,Ressotami,4,Fri Feb 27 19:16:01 2015 UTC,"It's interesting to note that they must prepare to replace every flagship product they introduce, even their fancy artisan Boxes."
lbregs,2xdrv6,mflbninja,2,Fri Feb 27 19:53:27 2015 UTC,I guess in this case....it just means making a few more than anticipated.  It's well known that the artisan boxes don't stay in stock forever. I still don't know if the Thrive will be replaced as I only submitted that one today. Waiting to see if they have one still to send me. If not then I am allowed to choose another different  walnut artisan of the same value. (Luckily the Thrive is expensive so I would have a big choice)  It also got me wondering. Will a critical mass ever be reached where replacements outnumber new purchases? Will this affect the company? Will they ever need to change their warranty practice?  And then I started to do the maths and I worked out that If they can make a new box for $5 which doesn't seem totally unreasonable....then I would need to warranty the box approx 20 times for them to lose money.  Sounds like the business model is pretty sound...I can't see them losing money at all.
lbregs,2xdrv6,bunnykittyhamster,1 point,Fri Feb 27 20:01:39 2015 UTC,"Still, companies need to make money, not do free repairs and build new boxes that are going out as free replacements, right?"
lbregs,2xdrv6,bunnykittyhamster,2,Fri Feb 27 20:19:10 2015 UTC,I suppose that depends almost entirely on your margins.  The margins the company makes on the box are quite high. But so is the quality of the product and the breadth of the warranty conditions.  But still....it'll be a cold day in hell when I warranty my maple for the 10th time let alone the 20th. I'm currently on number 2. And this is 4 years now.   I think Magic Flight can be comfortable in those numbers and I bet they know it too ;-)
lbregs,2xdrv6,marymurrah,2,Fri Feb 27 20:55:03 2015 UTC,It is. Wouldn't it make more sense to make all boxes like the MD with bigger inserts for herb and the existing ones for concentrates?
lbregs,2xdrv6,bunnykittyhamster,3,Fri Feb 27 20:17:42 2015 UTC,"oh, so they could pop out and be replaced?"
lbregs,2xdrv6,Moreburrtitos22,1 point,Fri Feb 27 21:07:06 2015 UTC,"On the user's end, yes. Instead of having to discard (good) wood when the screen gets damaged. Don't know enough about the company / numbers to say anything useful. Though user replaceable screens seems pretty cool."
lbregs,2xdrv6,Moreburrtitos22,3,Sat Feb 28 01:55:39 2015 UTC,"If you think about it, it wouldn't work the same. There would be air gaps that herb would fall into and you would get herb in the air path. It needs to be tightly sealed with the rubber gasket. This doesn't matter for the MD because wax or oil doesn't tornado or flutter around like finely ground herb does."

Zebrawood and a walnut Rocktopus MFLB, pine and our new walnut MF whip adapter (I replaced the acrylic tubes ends with glass stems), a DHgate D020 water pipe 18mm, 18mm to 14mm adapter, a Baked Brothers Y adapter in 14mm, and off camera are two PA adapters.  You need a hand to use both PA's, but it can be solo'd. Hitting two trenches at once is tricky. You need to go a bit faster to get proper air flow control. Once you find that sweet spot, this setup packs a punch.  This is expensive, excessive, and over the top. That being said, it is quite fun and will be great in our next group smoke out."

I put mine on the right for the sake of comparison. The differences are interesting. No click lock or rubber gasket, and the airflow channel by the metal cover pin is different. And no, although the designs are different, his is not a fake. The aphorism is laser etched perfectly and an older five-digit serial is there (as opposed to the eight-digit serial on mine.)"

The heat will help you shake it off the trench. I have this problem too even with the FG, so it's not the grind. I think it's because your herb isn't dry enough. But, still dank. 😏"

In making it plastic you're establishing an identity that is separate, so that in the future people will recognize it's design on Reddit.

lbregs,2vpnqx,bicycle,1 point,Fri Feb 13 15:14:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah totally have, but that's just being high .^"
lbregs,2vpnqx,Linnaeusc,4,Fri Feb 13 20:40:10 2015 UTC,"Yes! I honestly think its easier. I have mad social anxiety and when I'm stoned I can get my thoughts out, maybe a little wordier than normal but at least I'm participating.I have more moments wondering if what I said was stupid when I'm not stoned than when I am."
lbregs,2vpnqx,daisypiggy,5,Fri Feb 13 12:05:41 2015 UTC,"THIS. SO MUCH THIS.  Honestly, when I'm stoned at least I'm talking and yeah, sure I may come off a little wacky or wordy but I'm enjoying myself. Living with anxiety is cow titties, man.  or  I get so stoned I just smile at everyone and insist on how good the day is."
lbregs,2vpnqx,bunnykittyhamster,1 point,Fri Feb 13 15:12:51 2015 UTC,"Thanks for that, so recognisable!  Actually, don't feel bad about the wordiness. I've been on Lexapro until now for about 2 years and it gave me the exact same advantage. Ask your doctor for Sour D? ;)"
lbregs,2vpnqx,Linnaeusc,1 point,Mon Feb 23 19:40:23 2015 UTC,"Sour D is an excellent strain but I acctually prefer a hybrid. A pure Sativa is too much upper for me I think because I'm already a really uplifted and energetic person. Pure Indica makes me too sleepy so it's all about that balance. I've had a lot of success with a few different blueberry strains. I use Orange Kush for a lot of my body aches and it's a great indica that doesn't leave you super zoned out, mostly happy and joyful with some body relaxation, especially vaped :)."
lbregs,2vpnqx,mrrobopuppy,2,Tue Feb 24 13:21:14 2015 UTC,"Yep, but it took a while to build up my tolerance to take an entire trench."
lbregs,2vpnqx,ADHDABE,2,Fri Feb 13 04:00:19 2015 UTC,"I have a crazy tolerance  1 trench, 5 trenches same difference"
lbregs,2vpnqx,iGilles,2,Fri Feb 13 08:00:41 2015 UTC,With difficulty. I also can't do homework or whatever. I know loads of people here like to go to work baked or work for school baked but I really can't. I really don't think as well and I really only ever want to get baked when I can relax.
lbregs,2vpnqx,2742027,2,Fri Feb 13 11:53:47 2015 UTC,"Hell yeah. My morning routine before heading to work; wake up, toilet, depending on new trench or not hit the orbiter, shower, orbiter again, cycle for 15 mins enjoying the morning coldness and angry people (you should see their faces when they see me enjoying the thing they loath at that moment), get to work and talk with colleagues, put on earbuds and just do my work.   I heard they like my energy in the morning. Only if they knew I am HAF..  Oh and always sativa in the morning like PowerPlant. Get's me turned up."
lbregs,2vpnqx,BrogueTrader40k,2,Fri Feb 13 14:43:52 2015 UTC,I go back to work vaped. Totally love talking to customers after that.
lbregs,2vpnqx,OK_Eric,1 point,Fri Feb 13 08:14:00 2015 UTC,"Yep.. I think it mainly has to do with your tolerance or just overall experience (with the ganj) with how it effects you. Once you realize it's all good, you'll be good socially."
lbregs,2vpnqx,mflbach,1 point,Fri Feb 13 01:54:48 2015 UTC,"Well, a whoooole trench vaped down is a lot to me, but I have vaped and talked to the owner of the house I' renting (an old strict, but cozy woman that does not allow even alcohol, and even less drugs). And the flow in the conversation is no problem. I know I'm baked but also that is cool haha."

lbregs,2vf8i0,compoundbreak791,1 point,Wed Feb 11 12:10:04 2015 UTC,Simple and elegant. I think it was a great commercial.
lbregs,2vf69w,ADHDABE,10,Tue Feb 10 14:57:12 2015 UTC,Did they happen to notice the sub dedicated to their product is run by a crazy person?
lbregs,2vf69w,Elturiel,2,Tue Feb 10 20:44:09 2015 UTC,"I wish someone could contact MF and let them know of the situation, but I'm not sure if it would accomplish anything. You'd think they would have a little more control over the subreddit since they advertise it on their pamphlets."
lbregs,2vf69w,OK_Eric,2,Wed Feb 11 04:12:12 2015 UTC,I know that's what I've always thought. They are so free spirited and their sub is run by a karma reaping weirdo who removes posts if they aren't something he can just copypasta his weird shit onto to get karma.
lbregs,2vf69w,Elturiel,4,Wed Feb 11 04:40:53 2015 UTC,"I actually used to wonder why he got downvoted so much when it seemed like he was just trying to be helpful. Then I had the audacity to point out his hypocrisy in regards to technique, so I got banned. Now I realize that he isnt downvoted for the information in his posts, he's downvoted because people dont like him."
lbregs,2vf69w,frigginwizard,-2,Wed Feb 11 21:52:06 2015 UTC,"that is neither how, nor why, you were given a temporary ban, which 90% of folk get on my sub.    your temporary one week ban still has about 5 days to go, despite your claiming you don't want it."
lbregs,2vf69w,I_Submit_This,2,Wed Feb 11 22:35:13 2015 UTC,I'm not gonna lie the link rule gets me killed 90% of the time but you guys have to remember. The MFLB reddit is kinda noob focused and the rules are designed to help them as much as possible.  Is it frustrating? Yes at times but it's to keep the place orderly for the noobs.
lbregs,2vf69w,I_Submit_This,2,Thu Feb 12 17:37:57 2015 UTC,Well spoken! This sub is here if people want to hang loose. It's kind of a side lobby next to the bustling warehouse.
lbregs,2vf69w,Elturiel,-3,Thu Feb 12 20:54:26 2015 UTC,karma reaping weirdo ...     that's a new one. LOL
lbregs,2vf69w,I_Submit_This,2,Wed Feb 11 14:59:21 2015 UTC,"No, actually, it's not. It may be new to you, but it has DEFINETLY been typed/said plenty of times."
lbregs,2vf69w,Elturiel,-3,Wed Feb 11 19:43:38 2015 UTC,"well, you're the first person to say it to my face. LOL    what i know i have related is that internet numbers mean absolutely nothing. which is why those who trash talk about me and not to me, and my everpresent DV posse ... just make me smile with their self-serving, egocentric, childish ways.    where, may i ask, is my karma out of line?"
lbregs,2vf69w,I_Submit_This,2,Wed Feb 11 20:08:21 2015 UTC,"If it means so little to you, why bother responding? I don't want to be mean, and my goal isn't to make you feel bad (which you are obviously thick-skinned enough to handle it), but I really don't like the sub and reading your copypastas seriously irritates me to no end. But hey, nobody is forcing me to look there, so I shouldn't bitch too much."
lbregs,2vf69w,Elturiel,-3,Wed Feb 11 20:17:03 2015 UTC,"the copypastas are there to help the constant flow of new users to the sub for the quickest way to find answers ... and for archival searches, for those that do do lurker research.    we may be 20k+ strong, but probably only have ~1000 actually active ... and those are comprised of constantly rolling newer users. folk subscribe, but rarely unsubscribe.    and no one is subject to banning without me PMing and trying to work the rules out if needed ... except for outright trolls ... and bots. i don't like bots in my sub."
lbregs,2vf69w,I_Submit_This,3,Wed Feb 11 20:48:43 2015 UTC,i don't like bots in my sub.   I don't like the way you act/talk as though you own the sub.
lbregs,2vf69w,I_Submit_This,-2,Wed Feb 11 22:12:37 2015 UTC,"reddit owns it, i just run it the way i choose, as top mod.    please read other comments in his thread. this thread has been hijacked too much already."
lbregs,2vf69w,OK_Eric,3,Wed Feb 11 22:28:03 2015 UTC,"sorry ... did you not read my post, above? MFLB and i are on very good terms, and we are in touch frequently, we consider each other support for each other ... which is why we're included in their advertising, manual, site ... and blog."
lbregs,2vf69w,I_Submit_This,4,Wed Feb 11 14:58:10 2015 UTC,"It's not that, I mean no offense to you but it's just your style sends off bad vibes quite often on the sub from what I sense. You also seem kind of spoiled with only having yourself as a mod. I know you spend all day on the sub moderating, and that's great, it's what a subreddit needs, but at the same time having multiple people with different thinking styles on the mod team is a good thing."
lbregs,2vf69w,Elturiel,0,Wed Feb 11 18:19:51 2015 UTC,"MFLB is happy, the vendors are happy, and i am now very happy with the way the sub is running ... and 90% of current, active readers are happy as well.    very little will be changing in my sub anytime soon."
lbregs,2vf69w,I_Submit_This,4,Wed Feb 11 20:02:43 2015 UTC,my sub.
lbregs,2vf69w,Elturiel,-1,Wed Feb 11 22:45:38 2015 UTC,yes.
lbregs,2vf69w,mflbninja,5,Wed Feb 11 22:47:22 2015 UTC,"Ugh that attitude just ruins it for me. The whole militaristic style of things just seems anti mflb to me. Whatever tho, I've read the ""guide the hitstacking and kiefcharging"" (hah) about 11,000 times now so the sub isn't really of much use to me."
lbregs,2vf69w,I_Submit_This,2,Wed Feb 11 22:56:14 2015 UTC,"Thanks for finding my guide useful. I'm working on a second version and have been getting a lot of good time in on it lately. It's going to be a little longer, for instance ""kiefcharging"" is replaced by a section about grinding in different consistencies. I am excited to be done with it and release it soon as I've been hyping it up for a while now, lol."
lbregs,2vf69w,Elturiel,0,Thu Feb 12 08:20:27 2015 UTC,"which is exactly why the sub stays the same, as i explained about the constant influx of new subscribers, mixed in with the old who are moving on, or who have but haven't unsubscribed.    if you have a problem in a year, you know you can come back and find basically the same sub you left. sitting here waiting to offer the same quality of support. and another reason i most often do only temporary bans."
lbregs,2vf69w,OK_Eric,1 point,Wed Feb 11 23:10:03 2015 UTC,K.
lbregs,2vf69w,I_Submit_This,2,Wed Feb 11 23:35:58 2015 UTC,"I was 90% sure that would be your reply. Just the way you call it ""my sub"" comes off as shitty to me and others (it would be nothing without the users). Again, no offense, I don't want to be banned from mflb because I've been part of it for a long time, we just have a disagreement that we can live with I suppose."
lbregs,2vf69w,OK_Eric,-1,Wed Feb 11 20:12:25 2015 UTC,"i can live with it, just so long as it stays out of the r/mflb open forum. and what most folk don't understand is that subreddits are run as the top mod wants it run, under reddiquette.  submissions and comments are voted on, but do not ""run"" the sub. so yes, it is ""my sub"", and it is running exactly the way i have always wanted it to run. i have auditioned others for moderator, but none yet have had my direction in mind, or the patience and perseverance for a mod that the type of sub like r/mflb is, requires."
lbregs,2vf69w,I_Submit_This,3,Wed Feb 11 20:22:54 2015 UTC,"Fair enough, just to clear the air I too am a firm believer of reddiquette. Please don't think I'm going (or have been) to downvote all your posts or anything, that's just petty BS and something I wouldn't do."
lbregs,2vf69w,OK_Eric,1 point,Wed Feb 11 20:46:29 2015 UTC,"i like having civil conversations about why i do what i do. hopefully others will read, and partially understand why ... without those worthless DVs. which i really do like to see, 'cause it lets me know my posse is still reading.    have a good day my friend."
lbregs,2vf69w,OK_Eric,3,Wed Feb 11 20:54:03 2015 UTC,"Haha that's a good way to look at it, you too man have a good day!"

lbregs,2vf69w,I_Submit_This,-3,Thu Feb 12 16:37:38 2015 UTC,u/That_Crazy_Person and MFLB are on frequent flier frquencies of communication.
lbregs,2vf69w,mflbninja,2,Thu Feb 12 16:42:43 2015 UTC,"Just want to say, well handled as usual. I'm sorry you're being downvoted and abused here. Maybe people forget that /r/lbregs (this sub) and its mod team are 100% allied with /r/mflb and its mod team, which has been discussed amongst us and is unanimous. Your copypasta, as well as any/all comments you damn well feel like posting, are welcome here.  Frankly I'm disgusted with what's happened in this thread and I'm a hair's breadth from pulling an IST on it, if you know what I mean. It sure would look a lot better without all the confrontational bullshit that actually belongs in PM. Definitely some immaturity here, which breaks rule #1.  This sub, which is but a mere photo gallery and casual MFLB chat area, lame and tame as can be, will not be repurposed into a hunting ground for moderators of other subs that people don't agree with. You could have taken care of it by messaging /u/I_Submit_This, but you didn't. This breaks rule #1a.  Because seriously, come ON. Drop the issue, use a tissue and move on with your life. Like IST says, your being pissed off doesn't make his modship of /r/mflb any less fitting. It's a high traffic Q&A sub with many repetitive questions. He's on all the time to clean house and make it pretty and his work is vastly underappreciated.  Put yourself in his shoes, remember there's a human at the other end of the username, and stop stinkin' up the sub with this angry mob horseshit.  PM. OK?  Thanks everyone."
lbregs,2vf69w,Elturiel,0,Wed Feb 11 01:59:36 2015 UTC,"thank you, i try to keep it civil now, but i'm sorry when it is brought to other subs. but also, i just get sucked into these convos ... i neednto just truly take the higher road of just not replying anywhere about anything about r/mflb rules, the sub, any mod there, or u/IST.    report when needed, and roll on by. i'm done with the drama ... everywhere. i'm sorry for it here, and apalled by most of it at vaporents. but ... i still scroll r/trees and help folk over there via PM.

Also, from what I hear Incognito windows operate within RAM only, so they should be slightly faster with no HD access getting in the way.  What I like to do with work computers is visit each frequented website's homepage just once, then quit out. That way at least that much is in the history and it types the rest for me every time, such as reddit.com so I can type /r/lbregs after it. Everything else is done seekritly."

As a little tip, if you keep the battery in an inside pocket nearer your skin, it will stay warm until you need it and you will get more power on those chilly days.  Once the box is being used, you tend to get a bit of warmth coming off the battery anyway as it experiences some ohmic heating. But for those first few hits, this tip can be helpful."

lbregs,2sobz5,mflbninja,5,Fri Jan 16 22:23:39 2015 UTC,"Cool, except I hope you're not trying to reclaim the oil from your Orbiter. Any smoking will ruin this reclaimed oil. I also hope you're not trying to vaporize for a clean taste through your Orbiter, since smoking through it just once will give it a nasty resin taste next time you vape, and it's tough to clean it out."
lbregs,2sobz5,mflbninja,2,Sat Jan 17 01:31:05 2015 UTC,I don't use it that often for vaping. I feel like it will get a lot more use this way. So now I have a nice little bong that I don't care about breaking when I feel like smoking.

EDIT  Why this is actually pretty great:  *It's expandable.  You can use two jars and throw in the PA.  Three jars (two for herbs, one for the Box and batteries/brush/grinder)  *Less air means less smell.  If you were to put that same amount of herb in that tin without the glass, it would reek.  Glass is non-porous and the small size of the jars helps limit any more escape of that dank smell because there is simply less air available to act as a carrier.  *It can be padded.  Unless you go really crazy and throw this baby, nothing is gonna break or get wet.  The whole thing is double air-tight and water-tight.  Great for camping, hiking, trips.  *It fits into a backpack and with some extra room for clothes, snacks, water, etc."

I'm NOT talking about enriched uranium. You can touch unenriched uranium for minutes at a time without absorbing very much radiation. Not that you'd really want to... It is still slightly radioactive. But Radiation isn't as scary as people make it seem. You absorb some all the time by simply existing. Bananas emit radiation because of the radioactive potassium in them, which you eat by the way.  Using a small amount of uranium in glassmaking essentially makes the glass glow green. It's pretty cool. Here is an example : http://www.phaidon.com/resource/c1high.jpg  That would be safe to have in a large room. It is still slightly radioactive, but only slightly.  A uranium glass MFLB stem wouldn't technically be dangerous, but I feel like a hypocrite saying that, because I wouldn't use one more than once or twice tops."

I figured it would ultimately be a better experience. I'm in love with my set up though. I wish I had discovered this forever ago. I like my PA at about 60%. It's been easy to get a decent technique down since I can easily and precisely control the temp. I am excited for you to get yours!

lbregs,2q2aap,Ressotami,2,Mon Dec 22 19:07:58 2014 UTC,"MAYBE ... your MD is the old dark stained version, which they no longer make. they will automatically ""upgrade"" you to the newer, much nicer version, which is now the standard, stock, black stained version they sell.    generally, they don't allow upgrades on warranty claims, but, since you basically are upgrading, and they're the same price ... can't hurt to ask.  it might be an inventory/tracking/serial number type of thing that there's no easy way to circumvent, but the worst they can say is ""sorry, no can do that."""
lbregs,2q2aap,mflbninja,2,Mon Dec 22 19:48:35 2014 UTC,I think this is covered.  A damaged cover can mean the airflow is affected.

lbregs,2p1pcj,Ressotami,3,Sat Dec 13 11:36:20 2014 UTC,"E-nails already exist as stated. They are not cheap but remember that they are not designed to be replaced. They should last years if properly looked after and used.  Something like the Maud dib uses a very thin, fragile screen because the power output of the PA 2.0 is not actually that huge. You need to run that current through a very thin wire to achieve dabbing temperatures.  To combat the fragility of the screen, Magic flight have made their Maud Dib screens replacable. A really good idea if you ask me.  But if you're talking about somehow hacking a copper nail for use with the PA 2.0. I'm afraid it won't provide enough power to heat up that nail enough. The operation of the Maud Dib and Magic Flight box rely on their incredibly thin trench and screen design.  To get a thick piece of copper up to temperature through resistive heating requires a bit more oomph than the PA2.0 can provide. This comes with inherent dangers of higher voltage and current and e-nails are usually grounded and insulated for this reason.  Don't let me put you off trying, but bear in mind that companies have spent money on this idea already and the different fruits of that research are already on sale. On the one hand you have quite heavy duty e-nails that use mains power which are highly insulated due to safety. On the other hand you have lower voltage devices that need very thin wires or screens to work with that smaller power.  I can't see a way of bridging those two technologies. You cannot heat up a big chunk of copper with a 24v DC supply. The physics of it present difficulties.  If you want to experiment, do so with safe voltages and currents. Buy a selection of different gauge wires and do some tinkering. You should get a thin wire to glow red hot just by touching each end to the + and - of a PA 2.0 and pressing the button. Perhaps wrapping that wire in a coil around an inert ceramic bead?   Post it here for science!"

I'm taking an electrical engineering class at my university next semester, or probably the one after because all of the lab sessions are full for this one. If we ever have to do a project, it will be this. I was really baked last night, and tried to think of a way it could work. I was thinking possibly just a ceramic nail that was wrapped in copper mesh on the tip (while it being grounded and connected to the PA inputs of course), because I know just a pure copper nail wouldn't work because of the physics. I'm going to think about it some more. Thanks for the input!"

They just asked us if we had any stuff, we all showed what we had and they were ok with it. Here in Portugal, most of the times if you're not an asshole to the cops and you have small amounts, they'll be ok with you. Then they found my Maud Dib and asked what was it.... I was so nervous thinking ""they will take it from me..."" and they were just curious about it, I had do show them how to use it and they were like ""wow really nice, at least you're not harming your lungs, do you guys have any questions about drugs ?"".

lbregs,2oea7k,g1z3rd83,2,Sat Dec 6 01:39:39 2014 UTC,I saw a post someone made where they had both the orbiter and the ufo connected simultaneously!
lbregs,2oea7k,darkved,2,Sat Jan 3 12:34:27 2015 UTC,"Got mine a week ago.  I like the U.F.O a lot. For one, it's cheaper than the orbiter. Also, there is no glass to break. The downside is there are essential pieces that can be lost quite easily. I was surprised by the small size (got the larger 4"" one), but it works very well and seals itself without having to be pressed down.    It's a nice bubbler and gives smooth hits, but the ridged whip can be a pain. If you aren't careful/are super baked and vaping with frients, you will probably knock this around a bit because the whip can't twist or swivel.   The hits are mondo smooth and the ganja doesn't darken for a while because of how much air passes through the mflb while you take a long drag. When I vape, I use my PA (which I HIGHLY recommend) and turn up the heat because the U.F.O. cools down a hit to the point where you can just keep taking a hit.   Overall, I recommend this for the fun and novelty of it. Personally, I think the PA 2.0 is the only real upgrade that overhauls the experience of using the mflb. My accessories include the finishing grinder, PA 2.0, and U.F.O., and I need to say that this combo is pretty great :)"

lbregs,2nqkb8,zaaaac,4,Sat Nov 29 06:19:32 2014 UTC,Na the PA is harder to make because it includes handcrafted wood. Btw I love my Glyph got 4x and they seem to be really strong can get to a [10] :)
lbregs,2nqkb8,Camellia_sinensis,2,Mon Dec 1 18:34:38 2014 UTC,"Oh yeah, I can get to a [10] off 2-3 trenches with the glyphs. I have 2, each battery lasts 2 trenches. So basically 4 would be able to get me so high I would no longer be able to use the device ;). But the PA can get a lot hotter, and finish trenches quicker. Even quicker when paired with a orbiter. Here's how long it takes to finish trenches for me:   MFLB + glyph = 5-6 hits/trench MFLB + PA = ~4 hits/trench MFLB + WPA/Orbiter = 2-3 hits/trench   Speed is only a minor complaint, but the major advantages of the PA come with the regulated current, being able to get hotter (esp. if you use concentrates), and not having to recharge.  I also find I hit the box for a longer period of time with the PA compared to glyphs, but I'm sure that's suggestive. I just love playing with the heat settings, I finish off hits cooler than when I started the hit."
lbregs,2nqkb8,Nazie12,2,Mon Dec 1 18:59:13 2014 UTC,5-6 hits per trench?  I think you're losing out on a lot of other cannabinoids. I can easily get 30-40 hits from a trench before it's really kicked.  Hmm.

lbregs,2nqkb8,defsubsucks,2,Tue Dec 2 15:00:34 2014 UTC,"I agree it's the best accessory, but it also costs $60 or so which would make the kit 50% more expensive. One of the things that draw people to this vape is the low price.  Well they can just add another kit that includes the PA, so people would have the option."
lbregs,2nqkb8,defsubsucks,1 point,Sat Nov 29 15:02:00 2014 UTC,"My point of the post was to say that it most probably doesn't cost $60 to actually make. Disclaimer: I don't know. But it seems like a battery charger, two batteries, and battery caps are harder to make and seem like they take more resources than the PA. The PA is extremely simple in design and actual materials. Which do you think costs more to actually make?  You know damn well they're charging $79 because they can. They probably cost less than $20 to make. I'll still buy it for $55, but still, it should have come included."
lbregs,2nqkb8,defsubsucks,11,Sat Nov 29 15:28:34 2014 UTC,"What people don't seem to realize is you're not only paying for their materials and work, you're also paying for their extensive R&D, customer support and lifetime no-questions-asked warranty.  A huge deal of research went into making the LB (engineers and physicists, not some stoner kid in woodshop class). I don't know how much R&D had to be made for the PA, but I'm sure there's a reason for that price.  I bought my first box over 5 years ago, and a while later the PA 1.0. Since then I had two LB replacements and two PA replacements. I definitely feel like I'm getting my money's worth (and I actually bought another LB since), and probably still would if I didn't have to use the warranty."
lbregs,2nqkb8,Herbalist33,2,Sat Nov 29 15:43:35 2014 UTC,"Very good points. The reason for making the post was to glorify the design as well, and not including items in bundles seems kind of restricting the box's use as a desktop unit rather than a portable unit, when really it could have been both for the $119 they are charging it for. They could have made a MFLB-portable bundle with the batteries and a MFLB-desktop bundle with the PA, and they could have had them as the same price, with the charger/batteries as extras. I'm just saying I'd much rather have a PA out the box kinda. I'm stoned."
lbregs,2nqkb8,Herbalist33,2,Sat Nov 29 16:39:06 2014 UTC,"Yeah I agree, adding a desktop-kit would be nice. I've never used the batteries at home (or in the car) since I got the PA. Still keeping batteries in case of powerouts, though ;)"
lbregs,2nqkb8,Ressotami,2,Sat Nov 29 16:43:13 2014 UTC,"Yeah, the batteries I have became so shitty so quickly, I dread the day I find myself in a situation without a 120V plug. But it was a clever move on Magic-Flight's part to get it kinda wrong the first time and improve upon it rather than have it right the first time and have something which is more of a hassle be viewed as an ""upgrade"". I kinda see what they did now, it's a good marketing move.  That is, of course, if the prototypes for the PA were available around 2009 :P"
lbregs,2nqkb8,TeenDrinks,2,Sat Nov 29 16:45:51 2014 UTC,"I highly doubt it was a marketing move, I think it was just the natural course of things. They wanted to break into the portable vaporizer market which started blooming around that time, so for that a PA wasn't as important. Also, the batteries already existed in the market so they could focus on creating the LB to work with those and not having to also worry about creating a PA.  It seems more sensible to me to first make their product working perfectly with existing batteries and release the LB quickly, then create a PA in-house to work with the existing box."
lbregs,2nqkb8,drumsloveme,2,Sat Nov 29 17:17:45 2014 UTC,"Are you sure you havnt shorted those batteries? I only ask, because I'm forever hearing of other people's batteries dying after the first month or two, and mine are going just as strong as when I first got them (4 months regular usage).  Every time I see one of those battery posts, I always wonder whether that person has accidentally touched the positive terminal to something metal (coins in your pocket, another battery etc.)  Also, not cleaning the screen can impact on the flow of the current, causing inefficient heating, which would be quite noticeable when using batteries- have you cleaned the screen with ISO?"
lbregs,2nqkb8,LiamBMX,1 point,Sun Nov 30 13:05:19 2014 UTC,"They slowly started sucking after two months of heavy use. I am pretty sure I didn't short them, I keep the caps on the batteries at all times.  Also, thank you for the advice, I really need to reclean the box. I have found the area around the copper posts and near the bottom of the trench to become slightly gunky or discolored. I never have cleaned with ISO, but I have cleaned. I should get some ISO."
lbregs,2nqkb8,ssonti,2,Sun Nov 30 14:43:05 2014 UTC,"Ah no problem mate! And yea, I would defo give it a good hot ISO clean:  Use the pa to heat up the empty box good and proper, then dip a q-tip in some ISO, hold the box upside down, and lightly brush the trench with the q-tip. Heat up the trench again to evaporate any remaining ISO. Repeat this as many times as you like, or until no more gunk/black stuff comes off on the q-tip. Try not to get any ISO on the wood.  Give this a go, and I reckon you'll be blown away by the change in vapour production- first time I did this was after about 6 weeks of average use, and man, it was like having a brand new box again!!  Good luck mate!"

lbregs,2mwjma,treeserpent,1 point,Thu Nov 20 19:27:02 2014 UTC,"At some point last winter, I fell into a slump brought on by the lack of structure in my life. I stopped drawing entirely, while for most of my life I had been drawing daily. Days flowed together and I kept getting more depressed from my inability to focus. Suddenly a year had gone by and I realised with a jolt that I had achieved nothing.   I started sitting outside every morning with my pipe, a notebook, and a pen. For a while I just wrote and wrote until all of the distracting thoughts got out of my head. I still couldn't bring myself to draw. While high, I worked through the aversion, and realised I couldn't draw because I was holding myself to a standard that I no longer felt I could meet.   In August I started scribbling little bits here in there in my notebook, still too afraid to re-enter my sketchbook. Days were getting cooler and I realised I wouldn't be able to sit outside much longer, so I went down to the water while the sun was up with my sketchbook, a pen, and my pipe, determined to coax out the sleeping artisan. I first scribbled the trees and the rocks and the landscape around me. Next I drew the best likeness of myself I could with some personal symbols. Once the sun went down I drew dark nature in the dark. I filled many pages in my sketchbook and didn't leave until my hands started going numb. I went home feeling like myself again for the first time in year.   Later, flipping through, I noticed that the arrangement of my hair and ash in this drawing resemble a logo which I've since come to recognise..."

Even a new, full-powered battery, as incredible as it is for bud, will get drained and deteriorated quite fast, most likely (in my opinion/reasoning).   Also keep in mind that my perspective is coming from my experience of using the trays only for hash, and I had to hold the PA for quite a time at mid-high / high power to get the vaporization to happen dramatically. I have no experience with concentrates other than this hash, so I don't know if they'd vape more easily or anything, and I have no MD experience.  Good luck with your endeavor!"

And if they do discontinue the trays I'm sure their fanbase will respond.  My advice is to lend him the Muad-Dib. Yes I know it sounds crazy, but if he dabs more than he does herb, he will definitely appreciate it. Which one do you have? I have the new one where the screen is user-replaceable. There's a fin on either side of the screen that clips onto the electrodes.  If you don't want to do that, then lend him the trays. In my experience you don't need both at once. I carry my trays as a backup in case the M-D doesn't work. In other news I'm pretty excited to be getting some oil tomorrow. Got some new glass to try it with. :)"

lbregs,2lfa4o,Lezemotu,2,Thu Nov 6 03:33:29 2014 UTC,"I've read The Effective Choice and The Tiny Book of Essential Wisdom - I just finished it yesterday actually. So all I've got left to start and finish is An Immanent Metaphysics.   Basically, it's very heavy material - there were quite a few things I just couldn't understand. I'm sure if I put my head into those few pages for several days, I'd get it, but I didn't have the motivation to get that involved.  Some of his philosophies are a little ""out-there,"" but he has a lot of great essential truths to contemplate. I should warn you that it's similar to reading a textbook, so it's not going to be an easy read like with a typical novel or chapter book.  Basically, I got caught up in it because my licenses and certifications are in metaphysics. I'm a Licensed & Certified Past Life Regressionist, which is a type of hypnotherapist that focuses on trauma in past lives in order to regain health and normalcy in the present life. So I'm a type of metaphysical hypnotherapist.   I also work as a professional psychic as well. So, you can see why these books on metaphysics were extremely interesting to me. They may not be as engaging to others, and some of Landry's philosophies are erroneous, but they're definitely worth taking a look at - especially for the price - very affordable! I would recommend reading The Essential Choice first, as it's an easier read, and then go over An Immanent Metaphysics afterward. I'm working on the latter right now and it's a tougher read than the prior. The Tiny Book of Essential Wisdom could be bought at any time. It's just a bunch of aphorisms - you could read and contemplate one each day, or speed through the whole thing ;)  Anyway, good luck to you! I hope they bring you as much awesome contemplation and wisdom as they've brought me :D"

Maybe this'll help you, I'd say about 5 eu a g would be fair, as you're not going to be certain of its strenght etc. But 5 eu for a 4 hr long heavy high isn't expensive too.

Until you get a better solution such as the Finishing Grinder, you can empty the trench into your hand, crumble the slightly toasted herb with your fingers, then empty it back in for a finer overall grind. You can repeat as necessary after you've hit it some more, but don't get it too fine or it'll start making its way through the screen - not pretty. I got really fast at this before getting my FG, which took the work out of the situation entirely. Edit for spelling"

Other than the batteries, it case holds everything you need inside a air-tight, smellproof box.   I typically carry the batteries and charger separately because    they take up a lot of area inside sealed containers Keeping them in there can make them have a slight weed smell, which has to be out in the open while charging.

Where the fuck is it, if you don't mind my asking?  Some university administrations are particularly partisan, so they like to have reporting numbers.  The local pres of our shit-on-a-shingle psudeoversity was such a bigwig Republican senator retiree type that he just canned everryone he knew was even slightly left of center. I imagine smoking a J over there is a major fucking protest. At my university it would have drawn a sigh. And that is only an hour away.  People are fucking stupid.

It's actually a cigar box my uncle gave me as a teenager!  It smelled amazing when I first got it. Never had a great use for it until I got my MFLB in March. I used to use metal tea containers from Teavana and other places. They're great. I still use them in case I need to be entirely smell-proof. But, I work at a health food store now and buy a good amount of Solgar supplements. The bottles are perfect. Just about airtight and amber to keep out light.   So I've finally thinned out the essentials and I've started keeping two strains when I can. My ""herbalist"" recommended doing that in order to rotate the strains to keep tolerance a little lower. It seems to work nicely and it's nice to think, ""Hm, what should I vape tonight?"" It's amazing having choices!   EDIT  I'll add too that all of this is still I've collected over time and I only buy a quarter a month usually. But recently I got new bud before the old ran out so rotating strains has become a new option for me serendipitously!"

lbregs,2k7tmo,compoundbreak791,3,Sat Oct 25 00:39:01 2014 UTC,"That's a pretty good grind and will give you great results with your box.  Of course, some people (I'm thinking a certain well known mod) will vape in order to produce both a vape high and also, high quality ABV that is still packed with cannabinoids.  If you really want to make good use of your ABV, then a fine grind is not necessary as the larger particles will preserve more cannabinoids in them. It's dependent on your usage style.  Personally, I will often use a course grind and save the ABV while it is still green. I have a couple of containers of this stuff and it's still very potent. If ever I find myself short of bud, I can re-vape this stuff and it's very effective and still quite tasty."

I realized I was doing this a year or so ago, so I just started vaping my herb more. I mean, why only partially use your herb?   My goal now is to use it enough that vaping it again yields little to no result, but I still can use the AVB for brownies!"
lbregs,2k7tmo,Hrel,2,Fri Oct 24 22:08:41 2014 UTC,"because I prefer to vape lightly most days to achieve a clean, functional high.  As soon as i start vaping browner, the stone of those other canabinoids starts to dominate and I end up drowsy and useless.  That's why I love the box so much, It allows you to tune your high according to your needs. Something you just can't achieve by lighting up a bong."

I admit the screen has changed colors since then but I had just recently twisted the brush in the screen and blew air like you mentioned prior to the photo. When I engage the power adapter, it doesn't smoke but does gets red hot and glows. I already had to warranty a Maud-Dib before for the reason you're mentioning and I've taken the proper precautions to avoid it based on my past experience. It may be the photo that makes it look like that, but I noticed half of my screen being a different color than the other half before I had to warranty my first Maud-Dib."

I had noticed that it has been exactly eight months since I received my magic-flight launch box and decided to take some pictures. I included a few other pictures as well. It's still going strong and I've used it everyday since.
lbregs,2k6tvx,mflbninja,5,Fri Oct 24 12:10:47 2014 UTC,"I couldn't agree more. I have a source of BHO and thus have no need to collect condensed vapor in the form of honey oil. Meanwhile, when it's not connected to my rig (which collects oil, lol), my Launch Box is without stem. You're right, whips and stems serve mainly to detach the user from the temperature of the trench. That is unless it's a rig you can use to measure by sight - that means you can see the vapor and adjust your draw rate and other variables to get it just the way you want it. But I never use just the stem or whip.  People who have a hard time getting vapor in native mode could be running it too cool. But how do you get it hotter without burning your tongue? The answer is to redirect the vapor jet so it doesn't hit your tongue directly, but rather it gets a chance to expand and cool before you feel it. That way you can run it hotter, but not too hot."

(Note to anyone considering butane or hexane extraction, please do all extraction and solvent evaporation outside, away from spark, flame, or lit cigs/joints. Doing this in your kitchen with the window open is not enough - it may explode and cause all kinds of misery.)"
lbregs,2k6tvx,DrGooch,2,Fri Oct 24 19:44:34 2014 UTC,"BHO solvent-types are very selective in what they extract ... mostly cannabinoids, and some terpenes. such extremely volitile solvents also do not decarb, at all. ISO doesnt either, but you can easily decarb the oil after it's processed, actually as part of the process.    in many ways, ISO is a different kind of solvent extraction. it isn't very selective. hence it is usually very dark green from the concentrated chlorophyl, but ALL the Cs, Ts & Fs are in there, concentrated, as well. which is why its called whole plant hemp oil."

If you use a lot of concentrates then it's a great option. Will also mean you won't have to mess with different batteries or chargers.  You can use the same kit with your box as you would with the MD.  Edit: Forgot to mention that you can use the concentrate trays as well if you want to spend a whole lot less and keep using the one device.

There are cheaper ways to achieve the right grind, but they take a lot more work than the finishing grinder."
lbregs,2junee,Hrel,3,Tue Oct 21 17:01:59 2014 UTC,Seconded. I consider the finishing grinder and the box itself to be a single system. It's a must-buy...
lbregs,2junee,oldtreefarms,1 point,Tue Oct 21 19:09:17 2014 UTC,I have the finishing grinder but I find it takes way too long to finish grinding up enough for a trench. It takes much longer than having a regular grinder which with a few turns and I'm done. You also have to push down as you grind to get it all through.
lbregs,2junee,serenefiendninja,1 point,Tue Oct 21 20:34:54 2014 UTC,"/; that's very strange. I mean, the material you put in the finishing grinder should already be ground up in a 4 piece grinder already, maybe you aren't doing that?  Take that ground herb, push down on the lid while the FG is on the MFLB, turn a couple times, done. Shake and turn to get it all out. (I hate that part, honestly, they should remove those open areas under the metal sheet.)  It shouldn't take a long time or be difficult, yes you do need to press down on it, that's how it grinds.  As the wood wears from use you can use a nail file to sand out the grooves on the lid again, I've only done this once over the last year to keep the grooves strong."
lbregs,2junee,Hrel,1 point,Tue Oct 21 20:44:13 2014 UTC,I don't have a grinder other than the finishing grinder but what I do is just break it up with my fingers or scissors as small as I can and then put it in the finishing grinder. It might just be me but I feel it takes me a bit too long grind a trench. I'll try filing down the the grooves on the lid though. It is going to be a year in a few months.
lbregs,2junee,serenefiendninja,0,Tue Oct 21 20:48:48 2014 UTC,"Dude, grinders are cheap.   The reason it takes you longer is because you break it up with your fingers, the finishing grinder is specifically designed to work with already ground herb. It's a ""finishing"" grinder. As in, finishing the grind."
lbregs,2junee,Hrel,0,Tue Oct 21 21:15:48 2014 UTC,"I hate to correct you but it's actually not for finishing the grind after it's already been ground. ""Finishing"" is a term they borrowed from woodworking, which means taking your product to a presentable level. It can be used with nugs or grind, but with nugs you may notice a finer texture as less herb is allowed to fall through the grate. And yes it takes a while, but the consistency is optimal, and if you're grinding before every trench then you can be assured it will be as tasty as possible every time. Of course pregrinding en masse into a pill bottle is more convenient."

lbregs,2jrxy7,mflbninja,1 point,Sun Oct 26 10:42:59 2014 UTC,"I wrote a guide that explains it in detail, but to sum it up you just shake several times during a long hit with the power still engaged the whole time."

lbregs,2jrxy7,mflbninja,3,Mon Oct 20 12:05:10 2014 UTC,"I used to just use the whole sipping method, it worked but when I hit the solo it was a completely different experience. At the time the mflb was my only chance of vaporising so when I used the solo it was seriously like a different ball game!  So one day I read about the stacking method and I thought I'll give it a go. I fell in love!  I instantly starting using that instead of my solo.  I wanted to buy the PA and everything!  If anyone is thinking about buying a new vape, make sure you try different methods, some might work for you, some might  not but don't spend £130+ on a new vaporiser to only regret it like I do!"
lbregs,2jrxy7,oldtreefarms,6,Mon Oct 20 12:21:23 2014 UTC,"Wonderful thread. Thank you for making my morning. I see at least 3 or 4 people on /r/vaporents weekly, complaining that the MFLB didn't work and now they need a new vape. I try and get them all to try different techniques, especially stacking. Typically I am downvoted or told to go away, but it's for those few people that are wowed by their Box's newfound potential that I continue. Maybe I should direct them to this thread. Thanks for posting this."
lbregs,2jrxy7,mflbninja,3,Mon Oct 20 18:02:13 2014 UTC,"Well thankyou! If it wasn't for your thread I wouldn't have found that method!  But it seriously is great, I think some people try sipping and stuff and it works for them, some it just doesn't!  For me it worked, but I could get higher with the solo with less effort and also more even abv.  But when I tried stacking I could get just as high and still hit it the next day and the abv was just as even!"

At first I was worried that I was damaging the O-ring in the Incredibowl with the MFLB stem but it doesn't seem to have harmed anything.  They're on Massdrop occasionally which is where I got mine.  $35 is a decent amount for such a sturdy piece, and I find myself using it a lot more than any of my glass pipes (when smoking and not vaping, that is)  Do you have the quick release trigger?  I didn't buy it, and it is sometimes difficult to use with the MFLB (I actually use the draw whip which makes it easier).  The folks at Massdrop said that the quick release trigger didn't really fit right or work all that well, but then I checked later and a few other folks loved it.  Just curious if you have an opinion on it."
lbregs,2jh4ey,throwitawayfool2,4,Fri Oct 17 03:53:30 2014 UTC,What exactly does it do? Sorry if it's a stupid question I've just never seen one before
lbregs,2jh4ey,agentbarron,2,Fri Oct 17 04:02:26 2014 UTC,"The incredibowl is basically a very durable pipe with a fun ""carb"" method.  To let in fresh air, you pull the bowl portion away from you which opens up 9 holes and kinda blasts the smoke/vapor right into your lungs.  This is the MassDrop page where I bought mine from, maybe the description there might be better than mine.  It originally comes with a small glass bowl that slides right into an O-ring in the mouthpiece.  You can take out the glass bowl and insert an MFLB stem - it's the perfect size and slides right in.  In this way, the Incredibowl sorta performs the function of a third lung, although with much less capacity.  You can either let the vapor build up slowly in it and then open the carb to suck it all in, or just hit the box normally and use it as a way to visually see all the vapor you're inhaling.  I myself do the latter usually.  Best part is, even though it doesn't have the same lifetime warranty that the bigger model has, it's still an incredibly strong and durable product, and it all comes apart easily so cleaning is simple with some ISO alcohol.  Well worth it if you can get it for less than the normal price of ~$50 (?)  Here's a video of someone using the two together.  I'm not sure how he gets quite that much visible vapor, but that's the gist of it.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QI5_fSdCgas"

That's good to hear about the o-ring, I was worried about how snug that fit was myself.  I bought mine off of Massdrop as well, and funnily enough, had completely forgotten that I had ordered it in the first place when it showed up. It's been great for a piece to use while out hiking or in the outdoors in general, where my clumsy self has broken many a glass piece (and a MFLB as well).  I didn't get the quick release trigger, simply because everyone online said that it was more effort than it was worth. Maybe they'll improve it in a future iteration, who knows.  All I know is that mine is awesome, and makes for a great companion piece to the MFLB. I actually find myself using it more than I use my WPW even at this point."

I live in an environment where I must keep my vaping a secret in my room, so I can't afford the bubbling noise of an actual bong or the Orbiter.

If you guys like the album, or the idea of posting albums, I'd be cool with doing an ""Album of the Week"" type thing. It wouldn't have to be a sticky, I'd just post like normal and people could look for it if they want. I listen to a lot of new music (and old stuff thats new to me :P ) every week, I always feel like sharing new favorites with other people. If thats something you guys would be into, just let me know.

Pretty much puffed on the Launch Box the whole time, while taking a break every now and then to dab on my brand new walnut Muad-Dib. It rained a lot, but we set up a tarp and had a camper van to sleep in, so it didn't ruin much. Even walked around a little when it was nicer. Recommend to everyone. :)  Oh yeah and sorry about the resolution, damn thing was set to 640x480. You get the gist though. I'll have it set to 420 megapixels next time."

lbregs,2j0dui,mobiuszeroone,1 point,Sun Oct 12 17:30:47 2014 UTC,Yeah it can be hit/miss depending on how much you toast your bud in the mflb. If it's still brownish light green it works for me.

lbregs,2imf6q,ClarendonL,2,Wed Oct 8 13:08:24 2014 UTC,"I use it to cool the vapour so it's less tickly on my throat. It also allows you to see into the box whilst vaping, very useful for introducing new folk to the box."
lbregs,2imf6q,timbermill,1 point,Wed Oct 8 15:02:55 2014 UTC,"Personally I find a whip alone to be the least useful attachment. It completely disconnects you from temperature detection and (usually) blocks any vapor visualization from occurring as well, leaving you to rely on a timed hit. Not to mention it accomplishes the same thing as the stem - reducing the diameter of the vapor jet, leading to more irritation. I find whips are useful more as a means than an end, such as to shuttle vapor to a device you can use to see and measure with."
lbregs,2imf6q,mflbninja,2,Wed Oct 8 18:54:09 2014 UTC,"Nose vaping.   It gets you super stony and you can gauge temperature by smell. I'm not even. It sounds stupid but it's so good.   Long story short, there are some cannabinoids that are metabolized right by the brain without needing to go through the liver first. So those can more easily enter the brain!"
lbregs,2imf6q,mflbninja,2,Thu Oct 9 06:21:14 2014 UTC,"Whoa dude, you're like, insufflating your vapor, man. :p I'll give it a try sometime when I'm less stuffy."

If you inhale gently through your nose with the box you can get major head rushes and get very stoned (I alternate between mouth and nose hits). Stem seshes are just normal hits with the glass draw stem.

lbregs,2i16j4,oldtreefarms,2,Thu Oct 2 23:24:10 2014 UTC,"It's technically not a grinder, it's more a shaver. It shaves your herb into a very fine consistency, almost powder, so it vapes much more quickly and evenly and easily -- it boosts, in particular, the infrared heating qualities of the MFLB.

lbregs,2hxl7p,mflbninja,2,Tue Sep 30 22:09:21 2014 UTC,"Stems reduce the diameter of the vapor jet leading to increased throat irritation. I find native mode far superior. Experiment tonight with different ways of making an air chamber in your mouth so the vapor can expand and bounce around instead of going straight to your lungs. I've found making more of an ""O"" shape while hitting it can facilitate this."
lbregs,2hxl7p,mflbninja,1 point,Tue Sep 30 23:49:13 2014 UTC,Before I got my first broken stem replaced I hit my Launch Box native and I have to agree that the temperature control you get is superior. Missing out on all that honey oil though.
lbregs,2hxl7p,Ressotami,1 point,Wed Oct 1 01:34:38 2014 UTC,That's because it's going directly into your body. But I guess if this is your only source of oil then more power to you!
lbregs,2hxl7p,mflb_convert,2,Wed Oct 1 01:54:19 2014 UTC,"I like to think of it as enforced saving. I don't think many people notice any difference in high due to condensed vapor. But boy does it hit hard when its all saved up.  Same for pennies. Stick em in a jar and you're not exactly going to go hungry. But after a year, you got yourself some cash for what seems like free!  I estimate that less than 5% of the THC in a particular session is condensed within the stem and box. So I can't really see an advantage in going native simply for the sake of the 5%."

lbregs,2hu0cg,oldtreefarms,1 point,Mon Sep 29 22:40:00 2014 UTC,"I needed a tray, like a Kind Tray, but for my specific stuff, and we mostly vape flowers and are MFLB users. Kind trays are pricey, but very nice. If you find one that suits you perfect, great. But for me, I had to make something.  So, there are a number of ways to get creative here.  But, I got the Seville Classics Bamboo Drawer Organizer Boxes for like $22.  To hold it all, I got the Lipper International Bamboo Solid Tray, which seems currently unavailable but there are dozens of alternate options. My tray cost $35. Just make sure to check the dimensions on your bottom tray.  Pick up some rubber drawer liners at Lowe's or Wally world or something. I used flat, solid ones inside my smaller boxes and the perforated sort for the bottom of the large tray. It looks pretty nice. You have to get the thin Scotch double sided tape to adhere your cut drawer liners in there.  If you have an Orbiter -- and trust me, you should have! -- then you can leave the Orb in its box as shown when vaping, and just move the box around if necessary; this has turned out to be a great feature because since we started doing this, we have had zero Orb water spills! The box holds things fairly well.  Anyway, I set this up last week and after one week, I'm still happy with it and everyone thinks it's quite impressive. Hope it inspires someone else!"

lbregs,2hjq98,DandySandMan,1 point,Fri Sep 26 18:00:57 2014 UTC,You've got yourself a great combo there ;-)   I recommend starting on the lowest PA setting for a few hits (for flavour) and end up finishing the trench at about 75% with some fairly quick drawing/shaking.   Also.....Your wooden shorty stem is awesome. What wood is it?
lbregs,2hjq98,Ressotami,1 point,Fri Sep 26 18:54:13 2014 UTC,The stem is made from a wooden dowel with a hole drilled through it.

lbregs,2hjq98,Tashizzlet,1 point,Fri Sep 26 22:43:15 2014 UTC,Just a quick question: is it normal if my PA doesn't work when I immediately set the temperature at around 75%? I have to put it at 60% and slowly work my way up.
lbregs,2hjq98,RenSxSan,1 point,Sat Sep 27 09:21:04 2014 UTC,It is a known fault and warranty covered. The PA is fine but the power supply that plugs into the wall is to blame.  You can either warranty it through Magic Flight. or  I simply found a power adapter from an old external hard drive that was the same voltage and polarity and fixed the problem myself.

lbregs,2hgph7,Herbalist33,1 point,Thu Sep 25 20:29:43 2014 UTC,"Ok, so I got my mflb in July, and it has helped me to completely stop smoking tobacco and herb, and solely vape herbs. That's got a lot to say for it already, as I've been trying to quit smoking for years, but I've smoked joints daily for over10 years.  Since I bought my box, I've slowly acquired the finishing grinder, then the pa2, and finally the orbiter and concentrate trays, despite resisting each purchase initially, I keep end up caving in and order them 😉. I love everything mflb do!! Amazing company!!  I live in the uk, so the orbiter (and concentrate trays and free samples of 2 of mflb's herbal blends!!) ended up costing me around £70 I believe, including shipping and customs charges... A bit of a sting, but the lifetime glass warranty makes up for it.  So I ordered the orbiter 10 days ago on the dot, and It arrived today. Luckily for me, I had my first go at making qwiso using about 1.5g herb, and also cleaning 2 grinders and a couple jars with a good coating of trichs with the ISO... It turned out really well for a first go, although there's definitely still some plant material left behind:  http://imgur.com/oPJcmNe  It's smelled amazing when I was scraping it up, and it's been curing in a jar for about a week.  Well, as I said in the title, I hooked up the mflb with pa2 to the orbiter, with literally a smidge of qwiso on the unscreened tray, set the pa to about 70, and holy ****, definitely the heaviest hit I've had from the mflb!!! The qwiso tastes and hits amazing.  Also just vaping normal herb is do much more harder hitting with the orbiter... Or should I say it's easier and quicker to get baked with the orbiter... You could get the same effects without, but you'd have to hit it more times etc...  I've only just really started to recover, so I think it's time to stop typing, and hit that qwiso again😃.  Tl;dr- the orbiter is definitely a game changer, and if you're going to get one, order the concentrate trays at the same time. Even if you don't have access to concentrates, you can make some easily if you have access to herbs, and they are definitely worth it, and definitely economical!!! 😃😃😃  See you when I get back from space, friends"

My hits are indeed a lot better and dense, but the trench can be finished a lot earlier opposed to having a standard grind. My understanding is that the finishing grinder makes for more surface area of the bud and makes for better vapor production, hence why my trenches finish faster."

lbregs,2h3ksa,mflbninja,1 point,Mon Sep 22 05:34:28 2014 UTC,I try and stack the most fat hits and then lay back on my bed immediately after I finish the draw and hold it in as long as I can. The worst feeling is taking a big hit only to still see vapor when you exhale.
lbregs,2h3ksa,compoundbreak791,3,Mon Sep 22 13:50:36 2014 UTC,"A little exhale never killed anyone. If weed is a rare commodity where you live that's one thing, but I live where the herb is plentiful, and time efficiency is thus more of a factor to me than herbal efficiency. Plus I've heard that ghosting your hit in such a way is no more effective for getting you higher than holding it in for less than 10 seconds - Magic-Flight says 5, but I think there's a difference if you go for 10. But past that, not really!"

These days I recommend about 4 or 5 per breath. You can even cut it down to 3, or even 2 if your throat can take it and if you're not burning. That should take a lot of work out of the situation.  I myself have a convection vaporizer as well as my MFLB. It is a log vaporizer, called the Underdog. It creates beautifully large hits with less effort in comparison.

lbregs,2ggquk,oldtreefarms,4,Mon Sep 15 15:13:30 2014 UTC,The maud-dib through the orbiter is excellent. There is no learning with it just draw it through. I was in a similar position and ended up with both eventually. My wife hates when I get the bong out ( she will happily smoke a J ) I enjoy the high the bong gives. The maud-dib is a taste sensation. Both kinda different beasts.
lbregs,2ggquk,funkimon1,2,Mon Sep 15 16:32:23 2014 UTC,"Hopefully you haven't made a purchase yet. In case you haven't seen, the Maud-dib has just been updated."

Does the oil build up at that end of the trench affect the airflow? Is that end of the trench blocked up or does the mesh still have little holes clear in it?

lbregs,2fpi5r,HypnotizeNLP,2,Sun Sep 7 19:02:29 2014 UTC,"Well it's the weekend. It's Saturday afternoon (18:38) and I just vaped. I'm at a solid [5] from a half a trench. I wasn't able to make it the full Mon-Fri. I think my  ""dependency?addiction?"" is heavier than I thought. I was able to do mon, tues, wed, with no use, then broke in Thursday and vaped around noon. I had no class, no work, I was bored and couldn't stand not being high. I budged and took out my stash. Friday I was able to refrain again. I'm not sure if this is actually bad or not.

lbregs,2fm6ao,Randyyy30,4,Sat Sep 6 10:06:08 2014 UTC,Please get the PA. It changes the whole experience. Batteries will be solely for special situations without a plug.
lbregs,2fm6ao,Permanent10,3,Sat Sep 6 11:48:01 2014 UTC,"True. Agreed.  However, it really does help to have, and keep, fresh good batteries.  I got Powerex's with their super expensive charger, and it makes a huge difference. Those batteries kick.  A good draw stem actually helps. I really like the new wooden ones."
lbregs,2fm6ao,Astronautoker,1 point,Sat Sep 6 12:24:01 2014 UTC,"Yes! I have the same setup, but I have the walnut box and stem. I use it the same way, wooden stem and battery for mobile, and orbiter+PA for stationary. Although I don't always use my orbiter, most of the time i leave the wooden stem on. I like to think the the resin has built up quite a bit and sealed the wooden stem to the box."
lbregs,2fm6ao,Randyyy30,2,Sun Sep 7 18:52:44 2014 UTC,"Frankly, the whole setup is game changing.  I feel like the MFLB vapor rig setup is frankly the only way to consume cannabis now.  The box vaporizes herb with the power adapter perfectly. It delivers consistent power to the trench without drop-off, producing a relatively predictable vaporization result which you can adjust two ways: with draw, or by tweaking the rheostat on the adapter.   The rheostat is a little wheel which essentially sets the heat level.   It's like driving a manual car: yes, you have work to do. But you have total control of burn rate, draw rate, thickness of your hits, how milky they are, etc.  As a piece of glass, the orbiter is frankly sublime. Because it's filtering vapor, the hit is literally so mild it's unreal. The water doesn't even brown. It pulls smooth and quite cool, especially once you get the hang of it. And, who else has glass with a full lifetime warranty?!?!?!  It's little, but it's beautiful.  This is the only way for the connoisseur to consume cannabis, in my opinion."

lbregs,2fm6ao,sentkent,2,Sat Sep 6 13:08:03 2014 UTC,How do you like the dart stem? Will Orbiter glass bought in 2015 and thereafter not be on a lifetime warranty?
lbregs,2fm6ao,I_Submit_This,1 point,Sat Sep 6 16:08:57 2014 UTC,"I actually used the dart stem for a trench last night. I like it a lot. Mine came with a glass stem and it broke when I was shaking a trench. My wife's was what I was using...The dart stem has the benefit of feeling more natural, more flavorful. At home I'll use the Orbiter for sure, but mobile, it'll be dart stem no doubt. I love it.  Edit: I don't know about the Orbiter warranty, I don't know why it would go away though. Call them? Maybe someone else knows. I do know it's the only thing that is warrantied which doesn't have a serial number. I believe they use your boxes, but I saved my receipt anyway. It's so nice to such a wonderful, beautiful little piece like this with a lifetime warranty."
lbregs,2fm6ao,mflb_convert,1 point,Sat Sep 6 18:04:03 2014 UTC,"Okay, I guess nobody knows about the warranty yet because the website says if you buy it in 2014 you get a lifetime warranty on the glass.

lbregs,2f4obl,DandySandMan,5,Mon Sep 1 01:08:10 2014 UTC,"The herb is all going to one side. Looks like some vapor is forming but it will only ever be at half efficiency at best. You need some tubing to interface into the bong. Of course there are the M-F whips but you can also go for something cheaper. 1/4"" tubing is compatible with the LB, but I always tape it to my stem anyway, so the size doesn't matter much in the end.  Polyethylene tubing is cheap ($.35/ft at my local hardware store) and resistant to solvents, but is kind of stiff and hard to work with. Silicone tubing can also be found (probably around the aquariums at the pet store) which is more floppy. Poly remains my favorite - I just twist it back in line when it gives me lip, and ISO extraction is the most thorough way to get reclaim and leaves you with a brand new whip. Don't use polyvinyl tubing even though it looks cooler - if you try to clean it with ISO it will cloud and crack. And don't just throw out your tubing when it gets dirty, save it and eliminate that much more plastic waste. Well, that's what I think, anyway. :p"

lbregs,2exqgv,sentkent,1 point,Fri Aug 29 17:57:24 2014 UTC,It's just maple stained with food safe dye so it would be fairly easy for Magic-Flight to achieve a launch box with the same colouring. I'm lucky enough to get waxes and concentrates when I do her in Cleveland.
lbregs,2exqgv,mflbninja,2,Fri Aug 29 23:02:59 2014 UTC,"One would think it's easy, but in order to accomplish large scale manufacturing, they have to set all of their machines up in a certain way, and evidently it's a monumental pain in the ass to do this. Perhaps they'll go ahead with an india ink stained Launch Box if enough people make their wishes clear."

lbregs,2elmoc,LearninThatPython,2,Wed Aug 27 01:49:35 2014 UTC,"Another way to get a good milky hit is as follows:  Start with a fresh, or mostly fresh, trench. Set the PA to about 60%. Cook it for five onethousandths of a second. Begin a moderate inhale. Crank the PA up to 100%. Increase your inhale slowly as the PA heats that trench. After a couple seconds pull the power, the whip to the box and shake like hell while you're clearing the orbiter.  Takes two hands and you have to hold the draw whip in your mouth, but you can get some hella hits pretty easily.  If you do it with trenches that are cooked a little more, they'll combust in my experience...  I don't do this often anymore I find that at 50 - 60%, I get great vapor on short hits with not a lot of wasted exhale."

I absolutely love it, everything about it is exactly the way I want it. I also included a couple bonus pictures too of some stuff you guys may/not be interested in. Enjoy!   EDIT: More posts coming real soon!"
lbregs,2d99u7,G1Z3R83,2,Mon Aug 11 18:34:49 2014 UTC,That's one beautiful box right there! My favorite part of the thrive box is the unique cut on the lid.
lbregs,2d99u7,mflb_convert,2,Mon Aug 11 19:15:14 2014 UTC,One of my favorite parts of the box is that. It really stands out of all the other kits they have :)
lbregs,2d99u7,compoundbreak791,2,Mon Aug 11 21:17:53 2014 UTC,That is a really sweet box. Thanks for the pics.
lbregs,2d99u7,marymurrah,2,Mon Aug 11 20:41:35 2014 UTC,My pleasure! Part of me purchasing this box is sharing the beauty and uniqueness with others.
lbregs,2d99u7,Nova-Bombed92,2,Mon Aug 11 21:18:38 2014 UTC,Sick box dude. I really wanted the walnut one but can't justify the purchase. That box will have so much character by the time you own it for a few years.
lbregs,2d99u7,Nova-Bombed92,1 point,Mon Aug 11 21:09:17 2014 UTC,I wonder how long MFLB plans on keeping the design? With the lifetime warranty aren't they basically planning to always have this design in stock?
lbregs,2d99u7,ForScale,1 point,Tue Aug 12 04:07:07 2014 UTC,Nothing is confirmed yet. If it is never restocked and this was all they are ever going to sell then they will give a launch box of equal value

I saw someone who was using a fairly large size battery pack to run a PA 2.0 The whole lot fitted in a rucksack and he said that it lasted him all week. If I recall, the battery pack was 12,000mAh or something close so it was basically like 5 or 6 glyphs."

lbregs,2d4tbx,offermeanadventure,8,Sun Aug 10 07:52:32 2014 UTC,"I've observed a few different styles of use in my time...  1) The forget-me-now.  We've all been there. a freshly packed box, perhaps you added some kief to the top. That charger is showing solid green and you're good to go.  Two or Three hits, it's slowly hitting you. You pop the box in your lap while you click a few reddit links.   Hours later you stand up and your box tumbles to the floor. What the fuck!? I forgot all about that! Holy Shit! Is that the time???  You've zoned out for ages and your box remains practically untouched. The old forget-me-now.   If anyone can help me with a cure for the forgettyness....please share.   2) The It's not working  You crack out your gadget from your pocket at a party. It draws attention from a few friends. Some have seen one before. Others want to have a try.   You patiently explain its use. You pass it to your most trusted friend for the first go and he confidently proclaims it isn't working. You smile politely and accept the tirade of abuse from your friends knowing the inevitable is coming. The box continues round the circle....greeted each time with disappointment and such predictable lines as ""My dabbing rig hits way harder than this shit. Dude get yourself a volcano!""  Precisely 20 minutes later your friends are drooling zombies and you tuck your box back into your pocket. THat'll do box. That'll do.  3) The desperado.  Time are tough for this hombre......Your stocks have been depleted by the harsh and long winter and there is narry a crumb to stoke your vape with.  This calls for the desperado....  Brush in hand you begin to sweep. The corners of your tin, the threads of your grinder, the nooks and crannys of your rolling tray. A pile slowly grows over time. But it has an addictive quality....you can always find more.  You begin to sort through your AVB container for the crumbs that are on the greener side of brown. After much work you have a trench. It looks like shit but as is so often the case with these.....It blows you the fuck out of the water.  Vape on desperado....we've all been there."

lbregs,2d4tbx,mflbninja,2,Mon Aug 11 22:43:44 2014 UTC,"I use the PA 2.0 with my mason jar bubbler or The Orbiter. I prefer to do long, lung filling, draws on the jar and the orbiter. Using water filters is great because my throat gets irritated really easily with the glass stem or native.   I haven't smoked since the day I got my MFLB (~2 months).  Last night I hit it with a battery and glass stem and was reminded at how much easier the setup was. Insert battery and you are good to go. I ordered 4 more batteries over the weekend so I am going to try to master native mode in the next month.  On any given day I vape about a trench to a trench and a half a day. Trench and a half usually happens if I have the whole day off and I plan on cleaning or gardening while thinking about space. I take 3 day T breaks when a trench and a half isn't enough to keep me at a [7] for the entire day (usually one break every 2 weeks).   I will make more animated gifs today of my daily routine (after I get off work in 8 hours)."
lbregs,2d4tbx,compoundbreak791,1 point,Sun Aug 10 14:42:02 2014 UTC,I go through about 3-4 trenches a day. 0.4 grams a day exactly to help budget how much herb I go through. I no longer smoke unless it's a special occasion and strictly use my flight box and maud-dib.
lbregs,2d4tbx,mooseman923,1 point,Mon Aug 11 21:38:56 2014 UTC,"Well, I've just bought mine. Of course, If can find a hook up,  I'll probably do a trench once or twice a week."
lbregs,2d4tbx,s0nsh1n3,1 point,Sun Aug 31 02:34:42 2014 UTC,I vape a part of a tench (enough to get me to [7] or [8]) at night after I've finished everything for the day. During the summer it keeps the depression away and during the school year it serves as a reward for finishing my homework and also a stress reliever. I'm an engineering student so it's nice to have something to reward myself with after hours of work.   Occasionally I'll use it during the day with friends or out skating or biking or hiking

lbregs,2d4ecg,mflb_convert,5,Sun Aug 31 16:26:16 2014 UTC,"I introduce my box to a group with a third lung. It's perfect for the situation and everyone has a blast.  I don't have an Orbiter yet, I'm planning on getting one before Christmas for the warranty, but I wouldn't use it in a group setting. People could still combust with the Orbiter, short of you setting up the hit for them, and then some people could be offended by that, since you aren't trusting them.  In my opinion, the third lung is definitely the way to go in a large group setting."
lbregs,2d4ecg,mflbninja,1 point,Sun Aug 10 04:15:26 2014 UTC,Do you use a home made 3rd lung? Are there 3rd lungs that work with the MFLB that are available for purchase?
lbregs,2d4ecg,mflb_convert,3,Sun Aug 10 14:46:02 2014 UTC,"Third lungs are homemade. There are none for sale that I'm aware of. The good news is that it's actually easier to make a third lung for vaporizing than it is for smoking. With smoking, the temperature of the bowlpiece on top can get so high that it melts the cap. With vaporizing, you just insert the MFLB stem into a hole in the cap and put glue, packing, and/or tape around it.  Look up directions on how to make a third lung. When you do, make sure to put tape over the sharp edge on the bottom of the bottle, so it doesn't cut the bag while in use."
lbregs,2d4ecg,yotter,2,Sun Aug 10 18:11:59 2014 UTC,"Yeah, it is really easy to make a third lung, and also really inexpensive. I highly recommend making one."
lbregs,2d4ecg,Dindalu,5,Sun Aug 10 19:30:50 2014 UTC,"If I don't have my PA and bubbler, I'll teach them to hit it native using the sipping technique, and that's always been pretty successful. I think using it native gives a better indication of temp, and as a result, you're less likely to combust (IMO).  Although, if I do have my PA and bubbler, I'll stack some hits and offer them that (no one has been offended). It's easier doing that in a big group (say of 7), as it's a slightly harder technique to have to teach to so many. But, in a group of 3-4, then I'll teach them.  I think if you have a PA, the MFLB is fine in a group setting, batteries are ok, but the PA just works better in that situation."
lbregs,2d4ecg,Dindalu,2,Sun Aug 10 09:07:02 2014 UTC,I remember your previous post about naming your box Groot. I thought it was a dumb name until I saw The Guardians. Groot is an AWESOME name. That character was the bomb!  Introducing my friends to the MFLB with the Orbiter made my friends think I had a vaping problem. We all tried it and my friends either combusted the trench or drew too quickly. I decided not to share the MFLB with friends unless they already vape or I have a 3rd lung. WIth a a 3rd lung it is almost impossible for someone to inhale incorrectly.
lbregs,2d0nz4,mflbninja,4,Fri Aug 8 21:30:53 2014 UTC,"I think we're small enough to rely on downvotes to drown out the irrelevant posts, but if this doesn't work I'm totally open to removing them as long as it isn't totalitarian."
lbregs,2d0nz4,mrrobopuppy,3,Fri Aug 8 22:56:29 2014 UTC,"I agree with this. The rules can remain open and downvotes will take care of any unwanted posts. However, as the sub gets bigger and finds it own groove, new rules might need to be made."
lbregs,2d0nz4,mflb_convert,6,Sat Aug 9 01:41:37 2014 UTC,"Is it me, or are a majority of the posts on /r/mflb right now just pictures without any comments by the submitter?  Is /u/I_Submit_This just on break right now, or are the rules changing? Because if the rules are changing, then that would make this sub not as relevant anymore.  But if the rules aren't changing, and /u/I_Submit_This is just taking a break, then maybe we should make more of an effort to get the people posting just pictures on /r/mflb to post on here? If half the people that just posted pictures over there posted here instead, we would have a great sub. I just don't know if us pushing this sub too much would get annoying to others."

lbregs,2d0nz4,I_Submit_This,2,Wed Aug 13 12:45:26 2014 UTC,"Awesome :) glad to see you are back. I actually really enjoy the no picture without a relevant text post rule, because it helps to keep /r/mflb more informative. It's better for new users that go to the sub to see a lot of posts regarding how the box works, instead of just seeing a lot of pictures with no relevant text. I think having /r/mflb stay strictly an informational sub is best for the community.  And don't worry, no one would spam /r/mflb Most of us here love that sub. It's great."

lbregs,2d0nz4,daisypiggy,1 point,Thu Aug 14 01:22:42 2014 UTC,Did it occur to you that you could be on the mod team of this sub instead? To me it looks as if you copied our idea and now you're here trying to steal the wind out of our sails.
lbregs,2d0nz4,daisypiggy,2,Thu Aug 14 01:33:45 2014 UTC,"Honestly I didn't know lbregs existed when I made the sub. If anything I'm ""stealing the wind"" from getoutandvapes mod but we're chill. So, grab your pitchfork?"
lbregs,2d0nz4,ForScale,5,Thu Aug 14 01:49:28 2014 UTC,"Your sub says it's been around for 17 days. It looks like I told you about /r/lbregs after that, indeed. Regardless of this, it's clear which sub is more firmly established - we have a mod team and over 250 subbed. Wouldn't you like to be a part of this project instead of trying to fire up competition? We're pretty chill too, I just get defensive sometimes. :p  I anxiously await your reply. If you accept the offer for modship, there will be a 30 day evaluation period as with all new applicants. I think your proactive attitude is just what this sub needs. It's like I was saying, we should join forces! (I edited this comment a few times, and I swear this is the last time, lol. But the offer stands.)"
lbregs,2d0nz4,mflb_convert,4,Thu Aug 14 01:57:11 2014 UTC,"Wow, modship?! Definitely not what I expected when I entered this thread lol  I would love to help the mflb community in any way I can. This sub is great and I’m excited to help it grow! I’ve got 30 days to prove myself, let’s get crackin’!"
lbregs,2d0nz4,I_Submit_This,1 point,Thu Aug 14 12:59:12 2014 UTC,"All right, awesome. There's just one condition though. I'm going to need you to forget about /r/flightlaunchers. As far as I'm concerned, any promotion to that sub is in direct competition to this sub. If you don't want to completely abandon it, you can also repurpose it so it's less like this sub - for example changing the rules to allow for only pictures with an MFLB in it would be good enough. I just don't like the idea of an identical twin needlessly siphoning off subscribers when we could be working together on one project.  So, if you can sufficiently abandon or repurpose your sub, and prove your maturity and readiness for modship in these coming 30 days, I will personally approve you - though you will need the approval of the entire mod team to get in. It sounds a little more difficult than it is, but all you have to do is forget about the other sub and act maturely for 30 days and you will be a mod here.  You can help your chances by promoting /r/lbregs - just comment in threads on other subs where it's helpful for people to know about this one (most common example: posting an MFLB pic or story in /r/mflb, /r/vaporents or /r/trees without intending to start a discussion), and don't over-saturate or promote where you know people aren't going to like it. This is optional, but doesn't hurt.  Congratulations and good luck!"

Anywho... Just read through the comments here... and I checked out your sub!  Figured I'd throw in my $.02:  First off, the pic in the sub you created is awesome!  Makes me feel good just looking at it!  Well done!  :)  Secondly, over here in /r/lbregs, we have a few mods (myself being one) that are decently active.  And we're growing quite nicely with 250+ subscribers now!  With that many subscribers, I think we do need some more mods here.  And reading through your comments and looking at the space you created with your sub over there, I can say that I definitely think it'd be cool to have you on our mod team here!  You could even keep your sub going and cross post to and from it.  ""Have your people get with our people...""  :)  But yeah, anyway, just wanted to chime in and say that I think it'd be cool to have you as part of the team over here in /r/lbregs.    Take care!

lbregs,2bzy4i,Ressotami,1 point,Thu Jul 31 16:00:06 2014 UTC,"A faster way to stop the combustion I've found is as soon as you notice it start to combust ,quickly and with a somewhat firm amount of force tap the mflb against your palm and it will stop almost instantly. Little bit quicker and less messy than emptying the contents..   Might work better for you might not, but it's worth a shot."

lbregs,2bvidq,RenSxSan,1 point,Tue Jul 29 19:43:44 2014 UTC,I like to use my AVB for edibles and I feel it's more effective when brown. I usually notice when I'm about to be out a few days ahead of time and prepare by trying to buy before I run out. This time I was out for a couple hours.

lbregs,2bp9bg,mflbninja,1 point,Fri Jul 25 20:32:59 2014 UTC,"That's cool you're bisexual! Honestly I find it hard to understand the reason behind bias toward a whole gender. Is it the result of cognitive dissonance?  You play guitar and mini-bow-guitar, eh? Which one are you better at? How long? What kind of music usually?"
lbregs,2bp9bg,21TQKIFD48,1 point,Sat Jul 26 22:15:59 2014 UTC,Eh I mean I believe sexuality is very fluid. I can feel myself gaining and losing attractions to both genders independent of any rational explanation. Some months I will be more attracted to men over women and vice versa. But the ability to love both is always there.   I've been a violinist for 10 years and a guitarist for 8. I'm also a composer. I'm working to be involved in arts management after I graduate but right now I'm wondering if grad school is the best route for me or not.
lbregs,2bp9bg,mflbninja,1 point,Sun Jul 27 02:15:16 2014 UTC,"Cool. So you didn't say what kind of music. I'm assuming classical or neo-classical at this point? Is that what you compose, typically?"
lbregs,2bp9bg,mflb_convert,1 point,Sun Jul 27 03:25:58 2014 UTC,"I don't know, I'd say that ""I don't want to"" is a pretty valid reason. I can't say I don't have any dissonance, but I think I'm happiest trying to do what I like, instead of trying to like what I don't.  As for valid reasons for other people not to have sex with an entire gender, I've never heard one."

lbregs,2bkhy6,ForScale,3,Thu Jul 24 12:46:07 2014 UTC,Spalting is when a wood's color is changed by fungus. It creates gorgeous patterns with veins or blocks of different colors. I love me some spalted maple guitars!

lbregs,2aswan,ForScale,2,Tue Jul 15 21:58:42 2014 UTC,How did you make it? Just use alcohol? How did the oil turn out?
lbregs,2aswan,JokersSmile,3,Tue Jul 15 22:14:45 2014 UTC,"Hey!  Yep, I used alcohol; Everclear, to be exact.  I just soak the AVB/weed/stems in the Everclear, all in a Ziploc bag.  Then pour the mixture through a coffee filter and in to a glass pan (the one in the pic).  I evaporate out the Everclear and I'm left with the oil/wax!  Turned out pretty well as far as my do-it-yourself extractions go!  Definitely gets you very, very stoned!  :)  *evaporate"
lbregs,2aswan,JokersSmile,2,Tue Jul 15 23:06:05 2014 UTC,I boil out the Everclear    What do you mean when you say boil. How do you boil a pyrex baking pan like that. just tossed it in the oven?  Sorry for the questions. Just super interested in trying it.
lbregs,2aswan,JokersSmile,5,Tue Jul 15 23:18:05 2014 UTC,"No worries!  Feel free to ask whatever!  WARNING:  DO NOT BURN DOWN YOUR HOME!!!  ALCOHOL IS EXTREMELY FLAMMABLE!!!  By boil, I mean I set my stove top burner on a VERY LOW setting and then I set the Pyrex pan full of the mixture right on the burner.  I open windows and turn on a fan and watch it.  It's done when the alcohol is gone and just streaks of brown/amber goo are left.  Gotta watch it very closely near the end as to not boil out the good stuff!  Probably takes about 30 or 40 mins depending on how much is in there.  WARNING:  DO NOT BURN DOWN YOUR HOME!!!  ALCOHOL IS EXTREMELY FLAMMABLE!!!  And you can definitely just let it sit open with a fan blowing in the room for a day or two.  The alcohol will eventually evaporate out and you wont have to mess with heat.  Heat is kind of dangerous; not bad if you're careful.  And I think heat changes the color and consistency of the final product too.  And sorry for the overkill on the warning, but better safe than sorry for anyone reading."
lbregs,2aswan,mjmassacre,2,Tue Jul 15 23:37:14 2014 UTC,One more question. Then I'm done. Did you use a gas or electric stovetop? I'd imagine that an electric would be safer then a gas stovetop.
lbregs,2aswan,mjmassacre,3,Wed Jul 16 00:09:04 2014 UTC,"I used gas.  And, yeah, I'm with you.  I'm guessing electric would be far safer than open flame.    But really, I've run the process probably 5 or 6 times now.  I've never even once had any issues.    I just don't want anyone suing me or anything like that!  ;)"
lbregs,2aswan,marymurrah,1 point,Wed Jul 16 02:51:40 2014 UTC,Actually both are bad if it heats up too fast. Pyrex likes to explode when heated rapidly and all that. I used a griddle because slow heating and better control of said heat.

lbregs,2aqkst,LegalizeGayPot,14,Tue Jul 15 05:07:36 2014 UTC,"I'll start off voting with my opinion: it should pretty much stay the way it is. I mean, I made it this way, so it's pretty much already how I want it. If I made it in a way contrary to how I wanted it, then that would be rather silly. :p For reference, the way it is right now is a free-for-all sub with minimal rules, meant as a satellite sub to /r/mflb that accepts people who want to hang out and post whatever. This means that any post from meaningless photos of MFLBs on people's desktops to harsh opinions about the conditions of /r/mflb is currently AOK with the mod team."
lbregs,2aqkst,marymurrah,2,Tue Jul 15 05:17:31 2014 UTC,I also like how it is right now. Having lots of guidelines and rules we have to follow is what ends up killing subs
lbregs,2aqkst,marymurrah,2,Tue Jul 15 07:25:20 2014 UTC,"Yeah. To be honest it's also a lot of work for the mod team. The less we have to enforce, the better.

lbregs,2aqkst,ForScale,4,Tue Jul 15 14:41:49 2014 UTC,"The flip-side to freedom is that people are free to make mistakes. The question becomes, how long do you let this mistake-making go on while other people suffer their consequences? These other people didn't do anything to deserve the harsh results of said fuckups. Shouldn't the people committing these fuckups be stopped somehow? Shouldn't there be some kind of regulation?  Here we draw the line on ""civility""... but is it civil to call someone a dick or a pedo? I'm afraid to call out any more of your name-calling because of the long process we go through to convert your posts into something acceptable. I wish you would realize that these little words you use are entirely childish and are very ineffective in an argument.  I pointed you to the thesaurus yesterday because I thought ""your pathetic subreddit"" sounded more effective than ""your shithole subreddit"". The way you put it made me think, ""yeah, OK kid. Keep yelling and being angry, no one cares."" If you spend a minute or two to go over what you post before posting it, you can catch stuff like this and make corrections, and I promise you'll make more waves than the way you're doing it now."
lbregs,2aqkst,marymurrah,3,Tue Jul 15 19:46:22 2014 UTC,"Seriously? I mean, we're gonna argue civility in light of a childish ban I received? I absolutely have the right to describe him in the very colorful language that I use.  I'm calling it as I see it, using crude metaphors and similes, because why should I respect IST? After he posts inappropriate comments about breasts, yet bans people for lesser offenses?   I get it, he's your friend.  But he's an uncivil dictator, and MANY people have been calling him a dick.  Yes, I may have been the first to coin the term ""MFLB Pedo"" but really, I couldn't find a better word for someone who entraps new users with his ""AUTHORITAH"" and then bans older members who realize that his tricks are just shit.    BTW- that ""long process"" took very little time, let's be real. It's not like I posted my comments and then walked away.  I'd like to assert that I aim to be transparent and never edit my comments, but did so at your request.  I don't see how that was a painful process for either of us, since in the end your requests were met.  I thought it was one of the easiest interactions with a mod, ever. You called me out on an issue, and gave a fair opportunity for me to comply.  Here I am, defending my uncivil words because let's be real, I was pissed and tired of playing 'civil' with IST.  And you know what? You haven't banned me for being uncivil or voicing my dissent against civility.  You're a great mod.     The flip-side to freedom is that people are free to make mistakes. The question becomes, how long do you let this mistake-making go on while other people suffer their consequences? These other people didn't do anything to deserve the harsh results of said fuckups. Shouldn't the people committing these fuckups be stopped somehow? Shouldn't there be some kind of regulation?   People are RARELY free to make mistakes in IST's sub.  I get it, he likes his rules.  But preemptively warning people? How is that a free subreddit? How long do you let someone harass and spam people trying to enjoy the community? How long do you just 'sit back' and let IST continuing banning long time members? Shouldn't there be some kind of regulation, like oh I don't know, another mod?   You're defending a 'friend' who won't take advice from ""his subjects"" or you.  You had to create a whole OTHER subreddit, effectively dividing the community due to his actions.  Some friend/mod he is."
lbregs,2aqkst,ForScale,0,Wed Jul 16 02:21:35 2014 UTC,"You don't have a right to be uncivil and break rules here in this sub because you feel you were treated uncivilly in another one - that is skewed logic.  I'm going to put it to you straight so we can all stop wasting time: No one cares that you were banned from /r/mflb. If you want to hang out in here, you can, but you have to follow the rules, or you can add this sub to your ban repertoire as well. I don't like that you're calling people pedophiles who have not wronged children sexually. I find your behavior uncivil, which is a violation of the very first rule of this subreddit. Therefore I say, from now on if you want to disrespect someone in here, you do so in a civil manner - you find another word. And for fuck's sake make it a good one. If you can't find your words, increase your vocabulary. Don't bring your childish schoolyard insults in here.  If you're old enough to consume cannabis, you're old enough to read jokes about titties, and you're also old enough to think objectively about things, thereby realizing that /r/mflb is not what you want it to be, and never will be, and IST is a wonderful moderator for that sub - frequent, efficient, concise, experienced, helpful, one could go on. The sub is geared for new people, and he does a good job. This sub is for hanging out, and thus it is by its very nature different from /r/mflb. So why not just set up camp here and stop complaining?  About friends, I didn't say he was my friend - you gotta meet me in real life for a chance at friend status. What I was referring to was this subreddit. /u/I_Submit_This is a friend to /r/lbregs due to his extensive skill with the MFLB in case people have questions, and his experience with moderating, in case we have questions. And yes, he is always free to paste relevant information from his library of txt files - what you call ""spam"", which really isn't. If you don't like it, you have the power to downvote.  I've seen IST moderate and it doesn't mirror what you're telling me. He removes posts because they break the rules. When someone messages him about that privately, he's happy to explain. He doesn't suck up to people, because he doesn't need to, and if he did it would probably get tiring. But that doesn't mean he acts unfairly. People don't like his attitude, but it's just because he doesn't want to hold your hand, he'd rather you do more to help yourself. He points people to the search function instead of providing answers - that's because it's easier, and the answers are in there, and people should really search before posting.  He has a certain moderation style, and if you don't like it, you don't have to be there - you can be here. Just get over yourself and stop bitching about it so much, because no one cares how newbie-land is run anyway. We have this sub, so why don't you start doing things to make it better, rather than worse, in here? If /r/lbregs is so much better than /r/mflb, why don't we lead by example?"
lbregs,2aqkst,marymurrah,2,Wed Jul 16 04:51:37 2014 UTC,"Not for nothing, but:  my thread has zero downvotes. In fact, it's more popular than this post.  I think maybe, out there in the great vast internet, quite possibly, someone cares about the unjust ban.  Quite possibly more people ""care"" about that ban than they do about this post.  I'm not trying to dissect each upvote and downvote, just pointing out the numerical facts.  As a victim of sexual assault while underage, I don't see the use of 'pedo' the same way you do. Again, not going to argue who is right or wrong, just stating that I don't give a crap if people throw that word around as an insult.   Jokes about titties have to be relevant to the conversation. I'm not going to root through IST's post history, but there have been times when he's posted macros saying something along the lines of ""BUT TITS?"".  Not exactly funny or relevant, and that's my gripe. It's OK for him to goof off and post off color comments, but the second anyone else does, boom, banhammer. PS, you're talking to a bi woman. Tits are kinda my thing.  I encourage you to monitor IST's moderation more if you so please. Who is even to know how many posts he removes and how quickly he bans people? You're not exactly privvy to that information unless you are watching the post get removed in real time.  and I've seen it, and I've also seen downvotes in double digits for IST's spam.  I'm still calling it spam, because it is.  Yes, his jail scale guide and other reposted comments are great sometimes.  But pointing people to the search bar gets old after a while, and downvotes reflect that the community is getting a little tired of his spam.  That might be his style, but why is his style reigning over what the community wants?   It didn't have to be newbie land.  I'll say it again: its a shame MFLB promotes that sub because it is trapped by a mod who refuses to let the community grow and make decisions for itself. MFLB promotes it as a support community, yet IST expects newcomers to figure it out on their own, face his inconsistent moderation, or leave with a bad taste in their mouths.   btw- I think it's funny that you don't care if IST kisses up to anyone, yet you were kissing his ass on my thread. :)  also: http://www.reddit.com/r/lbregs/comments/2amn1y/meta_voices_of_choice/cixodly choice is good"
lbregs,2aqkst,I_Submit_This,3,Wed Jul 16 05:21:17 2014 UTC,"Hey!  Just throwing in my 2 cents...  I agree with you... I don't particularly enjoy IST's modding style.  I have my issues with the rules over there.  It's why I'm not over there too much anymore.  And I'm sorry you were treated unfairly over there.  But I'm thinking we should just know how that place operates and move on...  We have a place to be more free and less harassed now.    I don't think it's good to get stuck on anger.  So I'm thinking we should just let it go from here, knowing how /r/mflb and IST are...  and just focus on the positive in this sub.  Always choose on the basis of love, you know?  ;)  What do you think?  You saw my oil post, right?  Ever consumed the wonderful substance that is cannabis wax/oil?"

My brother and I made BHO in our attic with a 14g extraction tube borrowed from our dude, a can of Vector, a pyrex dish, a keurig to heat water, a sheet pan, and a TON of fans. It came out amazing. It was my first experience, but I think it was especially good because we did it really well.  I've made 'hash' from soaking grinders in ISO and throwing in stems and some shake.  Strained through cheesecloth onto a plate and cooled in front of a fan for a few hours.  When fully dried, I would wet my finger ever so slightly with water, and rubbed the dried deliciousness off the plate.  It ends up as a silly putty type hash.  I let it dry in a sticky proof container until bubbles rise out of the hash.  It pulls apart easily, doesn't stick to fingers, and flattens out easily to a disc that's perfect for throwing in a bowl.  I've used it almost like a glass screen! It absolutely does not belong in the launch box though.  I don't call it a wax because it is dark opaque brown.  Not a pure concentrate whatsoever, and I'm looking for concentrate alternatives now"

Did I mention my ISO hash has been exclusively made in dorms? hahaha!  I would like to get access to professional grade concentrates.

lbregs,2aqkst,ForScale,2,Fri Jul 18 14:51:59 2014 UTC,"I'm not trying to dissect every vote either, but I upvoted your thread.  I'm sorry about your experience when you were younger, and I acknowledge that you don't care if people use that word as an insult, but I do care and I find it uncivil, and in here that means it breaks the rules, and you won't be doing it without negative consequences. That pretty much holds true for anything else posted in /r/lbregs that is deemed too immature to remain visible by one or more members of its mod team.  I don't think what you're saying about IST's policy of fun-having is true at all. I have been allowed to goof off and joke around on multiple occasions in /r/mflb. Maybe it's because I don't have to be childish to have fun? Just a guess. As for IST, I roll my eyes when he talks about inserting and removing the battery in an erotic manner, or when he makes other lame sexual jokes, but it doesn't piss me off enough to complain about it. Let the old man have a laugh, I say.  I'll watch him as I've always watched him. I scan his profile from time to time because it's interesting to see how /r/mflb is being moderated. I can't see it much if he just deletes a post without making a reply, but he has said before that he only uses that power to remove actual spam and posts that are obviously and utterly useless.  You claim to be a member of the /r/mflb community - a regular, one might call you. Yet, you don't seem to realize its shape. It really is a haven for new MFLB users. For this purpose it is perfect and in need of no changing. It's people like you and me who demand changes that can't be fulfilled, and who must create our own communities. It was simply realizing that there was no place for people who would be regulars of /r/mflb to hang out that was the birth of this subreddit.  I didn't kiss anyone's ass. I'm just not ready to jump on your IST-hating bandwagon right away. A guy like me needs hard evidence and I just don't see it right now."
lbregs,2aqkst,reykjaham,2,Wed Jul 16 06:11:52 2014 UTC,"but he has said before that he only uses that power to remove actual spam and posts that are obviously and utterly useless   uh-huh, sure. My post wasn't spam, I was criticizing his spam, and then I was banned.  But sure, we can go with what you said.  Why does /r/MFLB have to be for newcomers only? MFLB does not advertise the sub as a newbies hangout.  There are ways to moderate a group to cater to long time users and newcomers.  /r/neopets does a great job of answering questions repeatedly, welcoming newcomers, supporting veterans, and keeping the community lighthearted.  IST drops the ball on a lot, compared to the mod team over at /r/neopets.  Perhaps additional mods would help the community over there, but clearly that will never happen as long as IST reigns.   I'm on the IST hating bandwagon because I don't see how his attitude on controlling the sub is anywhere NEAR the MFLB philosophies of choice and freedom.  That's hard enough evidence for me."
lbregs,2aqkst,marymurrah,1 point,Wed Jul 16 23:30:15 2014 UTC,"Hey!  Yeah, I don't know...  I don't like it either, but why get your blood pressure up over it?  It's not worth it.    I think we should just recognize that /r/mflb is going to be run the way that IST wants it to be run.  He's kind of a dictator over there, sure...  He's the only active mod and thus can do as he pleases.  And us knowing that is what brought us (or at least me) over to this sub.   It's more free over here, which I like.    As I've said, I think we should just hang out over here and not waste our time trying to understand why IST does things the way he does.    It just causes stress I don't need.  So I'm just gonna hang out over here in /r/lbregs and have a good time instead of worrying about some other mod's questionable moderation style."

All the time- they enjoy the sub as long as they stay on IST's good side.  Do you see IST here at this sub? No, because he knows he's hated here for his style, his approach, and his tyrant attitude.

lbregs,2aqkst,Ressotami,3,Wed Jul 16 19:48:21 2014 UTC,"Eh, part of me hopes that IST would read the criticisms against him and take them to heart. But that will never happen.  However, I think it's important for people to be able to air their grievances because it's something that frustrates A LOT of us, and it's important to refocus how we want the community to be.  It just so happens that we can understand what we want from mods via our collective opinions of how IST is a horrible mod."

And like ninja said, I guess there is a sub for buying and selling of weed related items on reddit.  The whole /r/entexchange thing.  I've never used it, but it seems legit.

lbregs,2amn1y,ForScale,2,Tue Jul 15 02:38:26 2014 UTC,I don't think paraphernalia should be sold on reddit simply because there is no way to verify ages.

It's one of the top subreddits that I post in but lately the moderatorship of i-submit-this has just really been getting on my nerves. marymurrah posted this badass 3D printed case that is extremely unique to the mflb (custom designed in CAD software). One of the first posts on there is this moderator warning that if anything cost related (something someone interested in the case would be curious about) is posted that it'll be deleted.  Here's what he posted on that thread:   ""allowing it, and with a comment is my ""seal of approval"".""   Just so shitty to talk like that IMO.  Anyway, I don't mean to be negative. I'm actually happy to have found this subreddit /r/lbregs because it seems like exactly where I'd be a better fit."
lbregs,2amn1y,throwitawayfool2,3,Mon Jul 14 01:59:23 2014 UTC,"Welcome. We're glad you like the sub. Please know that we (typically) observe the rules of /r/trees. That means no sales are allowed in here, either. /r/entexchange is where you'll want to go. You can post a link to your entexchange post if you want to, but if the mods come across a direct sale in this sub, we'll remove it.  Please remember that reddit mods have lives too. Accordingly, sometimes we must choose between abbreviating what we want to say, or taking the time to add a sugar coating. Sometimes we don't have time for the second option. But the risk we take when abbreviating our messages is that from time to time people misunderstand what we're trying to say - if the risk is taken, it is up to the moderator to explain to these people in better detail when they have time.  It doesn't help either that people take themselves really, really seriously on here. Sometimes when a mod removes a post, the poster reacts as if their magnum opus has been incinerated before their eyes and they'll need a few years to rewrite it, but it typically takes a lot more time for them to get over themselves than the 15-30 seconds it would take to hit the back button, copy, hit forward, paste, edit, and resubmit.  A message to everyone: you may cross paths with the mods of this sub on less-than-joyous terms. I hope that when you do, you'll realize that sometimes rules are a good thing, and we're just doing the best we can to keep it groovy in here. Also, regarding IST I would like to quote a recent post of mine:   Please know that complaints regarding the moderation style of /u/I_Submit_This and other /r/mflb mods are allowed in /r/lbregs, as long as they follow the rules of the sub (especially civility); but such complaints are not supported by this sub or its mod team. We consider /r/mflb our ally, though it is distinct from /r/lbregs; and IST our friend, though his moderation style is distinct from ours.  The two subs will continue to exist peacefully, side-by-side. We will not be invading /r/mflb except as we have been doing already, to help out newbies with their questions, chat about stuff here and there, and tell non-informational posters about /r/lbregs. After all, we are the regulars of /r/mflb. :)"
lbregs,2amn1y,I_Submit_This,5,Mon Jul 14 21:27:05 2014 UTC,"It doesn't help either that people take themselves really, really seriously on here.    Oh, like IST does?

I was just pointing out that sometimes people overreact when their posts are removed for violating the rules, but it's never such a huge deal to begin with because at the end of the day, it's no skin off of anyone's back to have to repost something on reddit.  My second quote was misunderstood. We consider him a friend, but would you follow your friend off of a bridge? Similarly, is IST an authority in this sub, just because we consider him a friend? No, but just like you he is welcome here until rules are violated. That's all I'm saying."
lbregs,2amn1y,ForScale,2,Tue Jul 15 00:17:28 2014 UTC,"I was stating my position because I really don't want IST to read your ""people are too serious here"" comment and walk away feeling smug.  I know you were saying that people can flip out over nothing.  I'm saying IST flips out over nothing, and I'm kinda rightfully pissed because I've been a member of the /r/mflb community for quite some time.  I'm not asking for him to be banned here, just venting about how much of an asshole he is as a moderator sometimes."
lbregs,2amn1y,ForScale,6,Tue Jul 15 00:58:30 2014 UTC,"TL;DR I sympathize with I_S_T but I agree that he needs to take a step back and take another look at things sometimes.  The thing for me is that I sorta understand where he's coming from.  Years ago when I was in middle/high school I was made a global moderator of a fairly active Zelda fan forum.  As the administration team, we eventually became worried about the direction the forum was going -- as it gained popularity, it became less about Zelda stuff and more about general life stuff that we thought ""wasn't the main focus of the forum"" so to speak.    So we tightened up the rules, tried to moderate behavior way too much, even coded up a custom 3-strike warning system to try to show ""Hey we're being lenient with our discipline!""  But in the end, we generally became known as assholes.  Especially this one particular admin who was ruthless with the editing and deletion powers, who I'm strongly reminded of when I see I_S_T.  Anyway, the point is that we went way too far, which led to a split in the forum where a portion of users branched off to their own forum without us ""Nazi mods"", much like /r/lbregs here.  Eventually the admins backed off and just let the community have fun without being dictators about it, and the place was fun again.  So I get where he's coming from, as I once had that mentality as well.  The difference is that I was a silly teenager at the time, thinking I knew better than everyone else on how ""my domain"" should be managed.  He's in his 50s and should have outgrown that mentality long ago.  When you micro-manage to the level he does, it just sucks all the fun out of the place.  But he's convinced himself that his way is the right way.  A few weeks ago he attempted to ask the community what they think about how things could be improved and stickied it for a while, and a lot of the suggestions were basically ""ease up on censoring our posts all the time.""  In response, he made those ""Post anything you want today!"" threads but you could only post what you wanted in that specific thread and the day of the week it was posted was randomly chosen by him as well. It wasn't really what people were asking for at all, but that was his attempt to say, ""Look, I gave you what you guys wanted and it sucked!  I was right!"" and that reinforced his opinion that he's doing things The Right Way (tm).  I'm rambling, my apologies.  I'll add a tl'dr to the top of the post."

Why don't you post warnings on every post? Why couldn't you be relaxed like you are on other posts? Who knows. Thirdly, you get uppity at ANYONE who says anything against you.   You're like a MFLB pyramid scheme, only caring about catering to the newbies, and banning those who speak out.     It's disappointing that MFLB prints /r/mflb on their products packaging.  Box owners clearly want more than a community for repeat Q&As which are constantly polluted with your, let's be real here, your spam.

But the downside is that when you take a break, or go dankrupt. You can really suffer with your sleep. In the first few nights after a sudden break. I barely get an hour of unbroken sleep. When I do sleep, I have incredibly vivid and easy to remember dreams. It's strange but not always enjoyable if you want to get some shut eye and you are staring at the ceiling."

The best I've done is roasted a trench in three gloriously stacked bong rips. I was going to start the fourth but decided it was too far gone to be worth it.  Actually I remember hearing about a guy and his girlfriend who worked together using a technique similar to stacking with a gravity bong in their sink, leading to a ""full extraction"". I've often wondered if a machine could be built to automate stacking into a third lung of some kind. It'd be kind of like a cheaper Volcano that you could rip the actual vape part out of and take with you if need be.  If anyone is interested in a guide on stacking, I wrote one a while ago.

lbregs,28mgve,mrrobopuppy,4,Fri Jun 20 14:06:29 2014 UTC,"Yes it is wasted vapor, but if you're pulling clouds there are several reasons it isn't as bad as you think.   With the amount of bud you're actually using per draw, this is almost a negligible amount of thc being lost If you are exhaling clouds, that means there was simply too much concentrated thc for your body to absorb all of it. Sure you could hold it in for a little longer, but you likely won't get much more out of it and will just get light headed If you have enough excess thc to make a visible cloud, then you got more than enough out of a draw that, while some is wasted, it is a sign that you are absorbing as much as you possibly can.    Again, some is being wasted but it is a negligible amount. If you can see clouds all it means is you're getting enough thc that your body can't take it all in. Which can be a good sign if you're looking to get as ripped as possible."

lbregs,28mgve,mflbninja,2,Fri Jun 20 23:58:33 2014 UTC,"I did this for a while and I don't anymore. It makes me sneeze a lot. Maybe it's because I have a lot of allergies, I don't know, but I get where I need to be plenty fast without doing the nose trick.  As for wasted vapor, I believe there's a perfect exhale, and it varies from person to person, but it should never exceed a certain point, because at this point it becomes wasteful. No one should go for thick, milky vapor clouds, because that pretty much requires the weed to either be instantly vaporized all at once, or a lot of weed to be vaporized partially, and either way uses up way more herb than necessary. I personally think the perfect exhale is as sparse as can be while still undeniably visible on all corners of the cloud."
lbregs,28mgve,Jewfag_Cuntpuncher,1 point,Sun Jun 22 20:41:58 2014 UTC,If I exhale a big cloud I always exhale about 50% and then inhale deeply again and try again.

Nevertheless here I am, tapping out a post on my phone, because, my friends, tonight is a wonderful night.  When you master the Launch Box, other vaporizers become mere novelties. Bold words, I know, but when the disadvantages perceived through lack of technique fall away, its advantages (supreme portability, instant on/off, warranty etc) make this little vape tower over the others.  I think you've mastered the Launch Box when you can get exactly the kind of hit you want on every attempt, provided it's not a spent trench; and you can do it native mode, with a charged Glyph battery (the one they provide). Believe it or not, for all the advice I've been spouting around since I wandered into this joint, it took me until tonight to actually reach this point. But now that I have, feels good man!  The trick to mastering the LB is trying all the different techniques and deciding on which one is best for you. But it's also important to try mixtures of techniques. I had been promoting the stacking technique, outlined in the guide i wrote a while ago. Though it was great for my water pipe setup because I could see the incoming vapor, I found it was unreliable for native mode and didn't get a chance to heat up when I went based on timing alone.  Tonight I tried mixing stacking and temperature detection in native mode. I basically took five hits in the same breath, shaking thoroughly between each one while the battery was still in. But during each hit, I made sure it stayed around the same warm-hot temperature with flow control, similar to M-F's official long-draw technique.  The result? My dream from the very beginning when I got this thing - the hits I wanted, with no burning, every single time. These things are enormous! Stacking little hits is one thing, stacking these long draws is another. Five of those equals a very powerful hit. Just trust me right now, ok? So powerful. Never underestimate the power of this vaporizer!  I would also like to use this opportunity to hype up my upcoming new video demonstrating how to stack hits. I'm almost finished recording, and when I'm done, you know it'll be here. And I might as well extend an invitation to anyone interested in hanging out with like-minded Launch Box fans in the new sub I created, /r/lbregs - which means the regulars of (/r/mflb. Thanks for being here, and...) Thanks for reading!  Update: Good morning all. Happy Dad's day! Damn, I was messed up last night. The MFLB has not left my side since then, and the battery is lasting a lot longer too. It's like someone flipped a switch and all of the sudden it's the best vape ever made. Right now I am considering selling my newly-acquired Underdog log vape to one of my relatives. Why keep it around if I already have something that does the job every time?  People get frustrated when the Launch Box doesn't work, and even more frustrated when someone tells them it's their technique that needs to change, not their vape. This is the turning point. They either take time to get their technique down, or they go to /r/vaporents and complain about it, and are greeted warmly by others who couldn't get it either. ""Yeah,"" they say, ""it's the fact that you have a Launch Box that's the problem. It's just a weak vape in comparison. It only produces little whispy hits."" Nope... ur doin it rong. :)  Speaking of which, I'll try to be on today to answer questions about stacking and other techniques to get gigantic clouds from the Launch Box, native mode with battery, if anyone has any."

I find that by leaving The oil it starts to drain into the stem and produces very quick stem build up.  Easier to harvest from the stem anyway.

lbregs,284lb0,bluntsapalooza,2,Sat Jun 14 15:07:16 2014 UTC,"I don't see any harm in soaking the wood in water and letting it dry completely on a flat surface so that it doesn't warp. But tea, or milk, is going to soak into the wood. That is not good  Edit: ISO might be good but I wasn't saying you should soak it in water, it can still warp it (same with iso) but at least the sugars and other stuff like proteins and what nots in milk/tea/coffee are going to soak into the wood and you don't wanna do that"
lbregs,284lb0,Adam_and_Pikachu,1 point,Sat Jun 14 18:29:27 2014 UTC,I'm guessing ISO would soak into the wood and you'd taste it in your stem for quite some time.

lbregs,284lb0,ForScale,2,Mon Jun 16 12:47:41 2014 UTC,"Hey!  Now, I haven't done this myself, but I read somewhere that you can use a straightened out paperclip or a bobby pin or safety pin or something of that nature to CAREFULLY scrape underneath the trench to reclaim that wonderful goo down there.  The only thing you'd have to be careful of, or the only thing that I see, would be to not damage the screen.  The gap between the goo buildup and the bottom of the screen isn't very big, so just be careful to not let your tool bump in to the screen whilst scraping.

That always used to bother me and I would often find myself in a negative thought cycle blaming myself for harming my own body.   I don't smoke cigarettes and by using my launch box, I can enjoy myself and not have to worry about harming my lungs as much.  I realise this applies to any vape but it goes hand in hand with the other nice features of a launch box.   Riding a bike? Taking a bong along seems bulky and unhealthy. Slipping a MFLB into a pocket is about as simple as it gets and you can stop on a trail for no more than 10 seconds to take a hit. Other vapes leave you waiting longer as they heat up. Other vapes can get left on in your pocket and leave you out of battery when you need it.   The simplicity of the MFLB lends itself well to certain kinds of activities. Stealth is awesome."

lbregs,27xyjs,mflbninja,1 point,Thu Jun 12 23:55:41 2014 UTC,"To be quite honest with you, I like it because it's very simple and straightforward. Kind of like coding a website in a text editor instead of a website design application. It takes a little more work but you get a better result in the end. Now of course everyone who enjoys stealth is going to enjoy that aspect of the MFLB. But I rather like that you can use a technique like stacking hits, or even just hit it normally and take lots of small ones rather than a few large ones, and it will get you a nice, evenly-cooked result.  I can't get my Underdog to vape as evenly as my MFLB quite yet, still working on it but I'm definitely better at my Launch Box at this point when it comes to the herbs ending up all the same color. The UD is definitely easier to use when it comes to getting a large hit. But it leaves behind some noticeable greens which I then have to stir. When I stack hits with the LB into my bong, I'm shaking the entire thing around the whole time, so every bit of the herb is getting vaporized consistently. I guess it's not a huge aspect, but I found it interesting and kind of a novelty reason to use the MFLB, even if it's replaced for regular home use by other vapes."

Point is, they have voted it in before, and they are not able to get orbiters because they are not selling them anywhere but on the Magic Flight website.

lbregs,27qivm,Adam_and_Pikachu,3,Mon Jun 9 22:29:36 2014 UTC,"Well I think you under-estimate the power adaptor as ""just a plug in battery"". Which admittedly it is. However there is slightly more to it than that.  Firstly, with the PA you can reach higher temperatures and that adds to the control you have over those higher temperature cannabinoids. The control dial allows you to lower or raise the temperature of the box as you please. This is nice to have.  Secondly, Whereas a battery voltage will drop off as it discharges, the PA stays steady. At the end of a battery sesh, your light will dim, your box will cool and just when you want to hit the box hard for a final hot pull. You're getting weak and cool hits. With the PA, you can crank it up so that the final pull is a hot one and you liberate the CBD for a nice body stone as you finish the trench.  Thirdly, NiMH battery technology is a mature technology, however it still suffers from the same problem of newer battery chemistry. Namely, that the battery itself will deteriorate over use. Your six batteries will be fine now, but in a years time you will need to replace some of them, probably ALL of them. And that's a similar cost to a PA right there.  Forthly, it allows you to do extended cleaning sessions and keep the screen hot while you wash it, without having to give one of your precious batts a hard time.  So on the whole, with no ongoing battery replacement costs, customisable temperature and power, and NO deterioration of vapor production during a session. Without a doubt, the PA is my number one accessory to have.  I spent roughly the same cost as the PA on battery replacements in two years. So having owned the PA for coming up on a year, It is already half way to paying for itself. That's without the other benefits.  Get one.  EDIT: The grinder is an expensive way to get your bud to a fine powder, the box already has a built in feature. Put your roughly ground up bud in the chamber, Take 3 or 4 hits. This will dry your bud to a crisp. Now empty the trench into your palm and pinch it back into the trench. As you do so, the now dry bud will crumble to a powder. A powder finer than that provided by the finishing grinder. I'm not saying the grinder isn't awesome and pretty looking, but there are other, free ways to achieve the same result."
lbregs,27qivm,Ressotami,1 point,Tue Jun 10 18:27:49 2014 UTC,"Dont get me wrong the PA is lovely, and i love it. But for me being able to see my hits was game changing. I dont really have a sense of smell, i can hardly smell weed even when its burning. Long story short for me the orbiter was better because i was able to see my hits and really see what was going on, instead of rellying on taste and smell, which 70% of taste is smell or something like that. Basically i have trouble hitting the box alone after the first few hits"

Gives you the perfect consistency every time, and is very nicely designed (it fits over the trench, so your herbs fall straight in, so there's no mess).  2, for me, would be the PA. I must admit when I first got it, I did combust one or two times. But, once I got used to it, it's just as easy to use as batteries. And like you said, if you're using it with a bong/the Orbiter, it really is a must...Also, I did have to warranty the PA, but that was handled superbly by MFLB's customer service.  Personally, I can't see myself dropping (roughly) £50 (+shipping) on the Orbiter. It's far too easy to hook up the MFLB to a pre-existing bong for super cheap, which I have done."

lbregs,26z60g,itsanact,2,Wed Jun 4 14:14:11 2014 UTC,"Hello Everyone!  Today I share with you my 2 launch boxes that I still own. The one on the left is my current 9 month old box, still in very good condition. The other is my 2 year old veteran box. It is no longer usable and I'm sorry about the dumb sharpie'd designs, I got bored one night and sharpie'd it.. I also included a picture of my three current stems. They are all glass 2 are the normal size and the third is a broken stem that I recovered by sanding down the sharp edges. Personally the shorter stem is my favorite with the launch box, like it just feels better. Anyways, enjoy! Feel free to comment below showing off your box along with stating the age of it. Lets see those pretty boxes!"

lbregs,26z28d,lilclark326,1 point,Sun Jun 1 13:19:28 2014 UTC,Cool!  Thanks for your response!    I am incredibly tempted to get the trays...  May very well be my next purchase!  Thanks!!
lbregs,26z28d,Freakthro,1 point,Sun Jun 1 15:15:49 2014 UTC,"This is definiteky what I wanted to see, someone whos done all of them. I just found out my guy has wax and have been thinking about the concentrate trays ever since. For the record everyone, if you already have a box and need/want something for concentrates, the trays appear to be your cheapest option at 18 dollars while apparently still working quite well"
lbregs,26z28d,Ressotami,2,Sat Jun 7 19:33:51 2014 UTC,"The trays do the job. They are awesome and not really expensive at all.   But as for dabbing straight off the screen, here is my take:  You will damage your screen cosmetically. It will leave a mark and it may or may not ever come off or look good as new.  However, functionally, the box will get hot and function as it always has, with perhaps a slightly reduced conduction of heat to the herb itself if the carbon residue is acting as an insulator. Most people report a little drop in function due to the residue. Some don't report any at all.  But it is at your own risk and magic flight can choose whether or not they want to cover any damage you might cause."

lbregs,26ut3a,rasmn,2,Fri May 30 13:00:51 2014 UTC,"I can't speak for the orbiter per say, but my bong lets me take much hotter and bigger hits than I would normally. Plus I just enjoy milking it up."
lbregs,26ut3a,s0nsh1n3,1 point,Fri May 30 18:56:54 2014 UTC,"You can visually see the hits forming while easily watching the box. The orbiter (or any bong really) allows you to basically 'store your hit' in the bong. Meaning mid 'hit' youc dan can take breaths, change battery etc. then when the orbiter is full you pull out the stem and inhale it all.   One way it's nice is for example, my gf can't hit the box for shot. so I take the hits for her, but let her clear the chamber."
