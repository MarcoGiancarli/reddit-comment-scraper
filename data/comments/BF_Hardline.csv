BF_Hardline,3e26fm,Systepup,4,Tue Jul 21 16:59:29 2015 UTC,"Still a viable weapon to me, perhaps it was not having attachments or just you?   It's pretty bad without any attachments. I think it does like 25 max damage and drops sooner than the M416, M16, and AKM....so maybe it is bad. I stick to the battle rifles"
BF_Hardline,3e26fm,RTViper62,3,Tue Jul 21 12:08:40 2015 UTC,"i just checked, it has 20dmg and falls off at 15m already... so basically anything that is a little further out is a 6+ hit kill."

BF_Hardline,3e26fm,nerdz0r,4,Tue Jul 21 15:53:17 2015 UTC,"Not only is the RO933 just terrible, it's one of the worst starting guns for a class in a shooter I can remember.  It's probably not helping new players get into the game.  The best guns are just so amazingly better that you can't really compete when you just start out.  The only good thing about the situation is that you can just avoid using the class entirely and just raise cash with any other class until you can buy a good Operator weapon."

BF_Hardline,3e26fm,gardenlevel,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:02:22 2015 UTC,A lot of the freebies suck. It's hard to get started unless you run with your squad. Maybe that's the point? Encourage new players to stick together and once they get better guns they'll still work together?  Or maybe it's just a crappy gun.
BF_Hardline,3e26fm,zuulbe,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:27:30 2015 UTC,the 870 magnum is a pretty powerful starter weapon.

BF_Hardline,3e26fm,DarthPneumono,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:30:00 2015 UTC,"Besides the fact that it's pretty easy to get other guns in Hardline anyway, the RO993 has some advantages over most of the other assault rifles, namely fire rate and accuracy. It kicks pretty gently (which is good for new players) and doesn't really have that much spread. The low damage is there to compensate for the great accuracy."
BF_Hardline,3e26fm,Tezla55,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:40:53 2015 UTC,"gave it another spin today... with my standard attachment layout (ACOG, Heavy Barrel, Angled Grip) it was a lot more playable and i managed to get better K/Ds with it... but ultimately you have to play a lot more careful and you will get a lot more assists because you often won't do enough damage fast enough to get the kill shot."

BF_Hardline,3e3ojc,Krab45,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:29:00 2015 UTC,"I play on Xbox One. I purchased the Ultimate Edition of Hardline that includes Premium when it came out. I played through the single player and personally loved the story, gameplay, and cinematics. Multiplayer for me is great. I love mostly all of the weapons because I am a huge SMG guy, and the SMG's in Hardline are some of my favorites of any Battlefield/CoD game. There aren't any maps I dislike, and with the recent release of the Criminal Activity DLC, the maps just got better IMO. The game modes are unique and fun, and I never have a problem finding servers to play on on Xbox. My only complaint is that I would love a bigger selection of guns in this game, but hopefully the DLC packs will take care of that. They did add a few new weapons in the first DLC pack btw. I am a huge fan of this game, one of my favorite BF games besides Bad Company 2 and BF4. This game fixed some problems that BF4 had. If I had one word to describe this game, it would be ""unique"", and I'm using that word in the most complementary way possible. Just the theme of the game with the mechanics of Battlefield. Really fun. Sorry for my fanboy review of this game lol just wanted to shed a little light on my thoughts of it. Hope it helps you and makes you feel the same about it!"

I also own BF Hardline for Xbox One and PS4 and think PS4 is actually the best of the 3 platforms for Hardline. With the exception of horrid lag every once in a while, I actually prefer the PS4 over my PC for BFH because of the server variety.  For example, there are TONS of people always playing Conquest Small on console, but 0 populated servers on PC. Same goes for the new Bounty Hunter game mode; at most 1 populated server on PC, but lots on console."

BF_Hardline,3due1x,MisterBreeze,2,Mon Jul 20 01:27:54 2015 UTC,Okay? Auto-aim is a thing that is only really for consoles. I'm saying that it's not on PC and that consequently on PC it's harder to pull off shit like this.
BF_Hardline,3due1x,R4W_Squirrel,-10,Mon Jul 20 01:33:16 2015 UTC,What?
BF_Hardline,3due1x,MisterBreeze,6,Mon Jul 20 01:44:31 2015 UTC,"Um.   What does plenty of aim assist mean?  Consoles have some aim assist seeing as it's a harder to aim  So you're just showing a clip where the game does all the work for you?

BF_Hardline,3du51k,vuralantidis,5,Sun Jul 19 14:24:06 2015 UTC,"Hardline is my first FPS in a couple years and my k/d ratio is still suffering from learning to aim again. I've pulled from a .5 up to a .7 and climbing. It took a lot of work, and climbing out of the deficit is tough.  Conquest, heist and blood money all have the advantage of distracting other players with an objective. At least a little bit. I played a lot of TDM early on thinking I would have more opportunities to kill, but instead it turned in to more chances to die. Now that I'm decent I play it again sometime, it's a great place to get a lot of kills to fix my bad k/d history.  Here's my advice: play one of the three types listed above. Like all BF games, play with your squad. You may not get as many kills as going solo, but you'll die less too. Play as operator. Being able to drop health kits after a close call will keep your k/d ratio down. Stick to one weapon until you really feel like you've mastered it."
BF_Hardline,3du51k,gardenlevel,2,Sun Jul 19 15:50:37 2015 UTC,"What this guy said.  I'd stay away from TDM. I personally love Blood Money. It's fun and fast paced, but spread out enough where you won't constantly die (like in Heist or TDM).  Be careful of where you spawn. You can easily spawn into combat and insta die if you're not paying attention.   Start out with operator like OP said. M416 for Criminals and M16A4 for Cops. Use a health pack and either gas mask (my favorite, especially for close quarters) or Revive/Defribulator. And a knife for melee."
BF_Hardline,3du51k,snipe320,3,Sun Jul 19 17:40:41 2015 UTC,you should not worry about the KDR in a battlefield game.

BF_Hardline,3droo3,BrawlerAce,2,Sat Jul 18 21:55:06 2015 UTC,"According to the comments, it was caused by running over pickups/c4/similar and starting a reload at the same time. Basically the reload animation shown is false and you can still shoot."
BF_Hardline,3droo3,Troy_Davis,3,Sun Jul 19 14:37:29 2015 UTC,I remember people trying to use the reload bug as a reason to hate this game as if it was exclusive hardline.
BF_Hardline,3droo3,ZeroBANG,0,Sun Jul 19 12:32:00 2015 UTC,"well there was an additional reload bug in Hardline that happened way more often...   10 seconds in: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkPiV_fs1KA    the reload times simply didn't match up with the animations and the number in the corner did not update as fast as you visually connected the new magazine, which made you throw a medbag or swap weapons the moment you see the new magazine being connected and think the reload is done... welp you bring your weapon back up and it still has the old amount of bullets because you pressed the next button too early.    that was very annoying.    it was fixed with the patch by cutting down reload times, now for all i can tell it doesn't happen anymore, only grip i have left is that the M16A3 has some odd delay AFTER the reload animation where you can't aim/fire for a second, makes it feel sluggish. You really do not want your weapons in a shooter like this to feel sluggish or react in unreliable ways."

BF_Hardline,3dt3lq,drewsview,5,Sun Jul 19 04:50:40 2015 UTC,"I'm going to guess you play on PC?  The TTK is too quick on PC because recoil compensation is much easier moving a mouse with your whole hand rather than an analog stick with your thumb.  A few youtubers have noticed this and they said they felt the game played better on PS4 and XB1 because outside of CQB situations you do have time to react and either fire back or get to cover.    What this basically leads to is the game playing very differently on each platform.  The PC player will take the gun that can do the most damage per second in a given class, put a muzzle break and stubby to minimize the random spread and just compensate the recoil, on console I actually see a LOT of variation in weapons now (the only guns I don't get see very often are the R0933, HK51 and the Stakeout) and I have to figure that a lot of players gravitate to the weapon they are the most accurate with over what might technically be the quickest to kill.  I think BFH needs to copy the BF4 approach with spread increase and decrease, the M416 has almost the same ROF as the AEK in BF4 but unlike in BF4 with a heavy barrel/muzzle brake and stubby grip the M416 stays laser accurate when you hold down the trigger where the AEK will send bullets all over the place.  As you said the quick TTK is fun if the weapons take some skill (I find the AKM and the BR's to be an absolute blast) and I think the spread system with BF4 would fix this game right up.  The guns would still kill you quickly if you line up an accurate shot and get a good burst on target, but if you just start spraying and try to walk your gun on target your bullets will be flying all over the place."
BF_Hardline,3dt3lq,bimm3ric,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:02:13 2015 UTC,"truth. im on PS4, and i find the TTK is almost perfect since it is harder to control, as mentioned. sure there are times where you get insta-killed. but i cant complain too much when i insta-drop people on the other end as well. fun game on console no doubt."
BF_Hardline,3dt3lq,SkimSTi,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:53:06 2015 UTC,"One of the things we were begging for is seperate PC profile from console so that PC could get higher recoil in weapons.

BF_Hardline,3dt3lq,nova311,1 point,Mon Jul 20 09:53:55 2015 UTC,"speak only for yourself...    i got sick and tired of BF4's damage model, being the first to shoot, being on target and then the guy you are shooting clearly starts firing hist first shot after you... and you die with him having 4hp left.    These Situations never felt consistent or like the other guy was a better player, it always feels like the Netcode and Damage Model team up to say FU!    In Hardline, i shoot first, i hit, it dies (unless the enemy has one of the instakill weapons, like K10, Shotguns or Knockout and manages to hit me while i'm shooting, so there is still balance and a chance to fight back). The window to fight back / react is just a bit smaller... you know, like in BF4 Hardcore mode that so many people seem to prefer. In BF4 i hate Hardcore, i want my minimap, i want my UI stuff, i want 3D spotting... i am fine with Hardcores' damage model and shorter TTK. In Hardline i get exactly that, weapons that actually kill and the UI is not turned off.  CoD... i don't see what this has to do with CoD? I'm not avoiding CoD because of its damage model, far from it, i'd love to have CoD be a good game. I avoid it because it usually comes with Peer 2 Peer and Console type Matchmaking instead of Dedicated Servers with custom rules and player sizes. Titanfall i actually tried to play (the Mechs were a strong lure, but the CoD roots of the developer showed in the Server System) the 5vs5 matchmaking just annoyed the hell out of me. Somebody drops out after the match starts, too bad, nobody else is coming to replace him. Match ends, nope you can't just start the next round, lets go to the lobby again for 3 minutes to wait for a replacement guy (and see 3 others hop in and out while you wait). In Battlefield i can just keep playing and the Server doesn't care if there are 64 or 16 players on it, it lets me play and that is what i'm here for, not to sit around in stupid lobbies waiting for people to press buttons."
BF_Hardline,3dt3lq,ZeroBANG,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:30:48 2015 UTC,"ttk is fine, as i've said. Just some extra recoil would be nice so there is skill involved. those guns are lasers"
BF_Hardline,3dt3lq,wda_exodus,0,Tue Jul 21 14:28:38 2015 UTC,"Seriously bro, you just read my mind and I couldn't say it any better.  I like the TTK where it is.  I think the recoil feels better and if you master it, you're golden in this game.  I'm happy guns have recoil in HL as opposed to BF4 where virtually every gun feels the same in relation to class and recoil is non-existent."
BF_Hardline,3dt3lq,Hunter1207,-4,Tue Jul 21 13:12:56 2015 UTC,LMAO    Yet you gave us the most casual game in the history of the series   didn't play a lot of BF4 did you
BF_Hardline,3dt3lq,Hunter1207,4,Sun Jul 19 08:17:59 2015 UTC,"I have about 800h in BF4 and still play it. Yes it is quite casual, but nowhere near as bad as hardline in that respect. The skill gap is wider in bf4 and allows for players to set themselves apart in a meaningful way. In hardline there are no gun battles, you just kill or die rarely knowing who it was that was shooting you"
BF_Hardline,3dt3lq,wda_exodus,-4,Sun Jul 19 08:29:22 2015 UTC,"Just seems like you are a bad infantry player to me. You just need better positioning and awareness in Hardline (And good aim + reflexes obviously help). BF4 is full of shit like the MBT LAW and other self-guided bullshit weapons, active protection etc etc - things that take absolutely no skill. Things like the SRAW, that are actually somewhat hard to use, get nerfed, aircraft got nerfed (in comparison to BF3), etc etc."
BF_Hardline,3dt3lq,wda_exodus,3,Sun Jul 19 12:53:22 2015 UTC,"you would be seriously mistaken, I'm usually thousands of points ahead of the everyone in any given server, that doesn't mean its enjoyable, the weapons are so easy"
BF_Hardline,3dt3lq,wda_exodus,-1,Sun Jul 19 14:34:48 2015 UTC,"LOL, there is no skill gap in BF4, at least in gunplay.  Every gun handles the same except ROF.  I can play any AR and do well.  Same goes for any LMG, DMR, etc.  They all handle the same respective to class and all have no recoil.  Someone who hasn't played HL before that played BF4 will be shocked at the amount of recoil the guns have.  I remember the 1st time I shot the M416 and thought MY GOD, this thing kicks like a mule."

However, I don't use Enforcer, I'm more of the mechanic type. Still, I don't have a hard time finding games for CA in quick match. Just has to be the right time of day. Overall, I recommend Criminal Activity, and I'm excited for the next DLC."

BF_Hardline,3dqmdc,TheJaggedSpoon,1 point,Sun Jul 19 07:13:11 2015 UTC,What platform? There's always CA servers up on XB1
BF_Hardline,3dqmdc,Troy_Davis,2,Sun Jul 19 12:33:52 2015 UTC,"Yes.  The four new maps are easily the best in the game. The new weapons, while all for the Enforcer only, are really fun to use.   Bounty Hunter is a great gametype and I have zero problems finding a match for it BUT it is hard to find matches on other gametypes.  It's honestly great DLC if you enjoy Hardline, just not many servers are using it."

I have know idea what these 2 geniuses are on about what would be the ""cons"" of the dlc? Lol. I'm also on Xbox one the server browser is broken as of right now but I have no problem finding a server (on conquest large) through quick match whenever I jump on to play."

BF_Hardline,3dqmdc,inked18,0,Sun Jul 19 07:19:29 2015 UTC,"New weapons and stuff you can use anytime is okay, fun but not game changing except for the tactical toolkit making picking up money very fast in blood money.  The real reason to consider the DLC is the new maps. New game mode is fine but nothing to get very excited about. Maps are a mixed bag but I think most agree that Backwoods is a fun map and a nice change of pace from the rest of them.  The real question is then, can you actually play on the new maps, are there enough people/servers to make that happen? Mostly for now, yes. You might need to use the server browser and maybe you have to settle for an all maps vs dlc only or the other way around but you can play them. Conquest and blood money seem well populated, heist is usually doable, not so sure about dlc hotwire (only one of the maps supports it) or other modes like rescue."

The maps are great but half the time i can't find a single server with more than 2 people on it running the DLC. It's good but like i say, there's just not enough people playing it for you to really appreciate it."
BF_Hardline,3dqmdc,Xsjadoful,0,Mon Jul 20 12:30:46 2015 UTC,"Really? Because mostly everyone else has sad that they can find servers, and when I looked I found many populated servers."

BF_Hardline,3dowsx,gardenlevel,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:30:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I finally got my Knockout last night. I was really bad at sniping (still not great) but practice helped so much. I thought sniping badly over and over would continue the cycle, but nope! Be sure to stay with either scout elite OR r7000/AWM though. Bullet drop and muzzle velocity are very different on scout elite and it's harder to learn both gun styles"
BF_Hardline,3dowsx,Rhawk100,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:03:34 2015 UTC,"Obviously decking yourself out properly is first priority. I recommend Scout and equip yourself with Cameras and Tripmines.   A few areas on most any map that are good to hold down for the opportunity to snipe the headshots. I find yet again TDM to be my best chance at getting headshot kills enough to earn coins.   Place Cameras down on either side of you too allow you to hear the beeping sound when they spot an enemy. Have tripmines near you to help thwart rushers. Do not make them obvious if possible.   My favorite TDM map for sniper headshots are 'Riptide', 'Derailed', and 'Bank Job'. A close fourth would be 'Everglades' and hang on the outskirts of the map hitting the corner camping areas for enemy team.   Good luck.  Edit: don't forget you can dial in your scope for the manner in which you aim. I tend to go 200m myself for all distances up to 200m. But will move to 300m at times if really far. After 300m I tend to simply try adjusting aim instead of using zero scope as much.  Biggest thing I forgot. Many people having difficulty getting headshots might simply need to actually bring their scope down to x6 versus the x8 or larger scopes."
BF_Hardline,3dowsx,BillyHoWCR,1 point,Sat Jul 18 05:38:14 2015 UTC,Me personally I rock AWM with magnum rounds and I switch between 8x 14x zoom. Make sure you get used to dialing in the correct distance instead of adjusting your aim for drop. The rest is practice. Using maps where snipers frequent are best as you can counter snipe easily. Magnum rounds decrease bullet drop and increase bullet velocity which is why I say use them. Awm is so accurate so far out lol
BF_Hardline,3dowsx,JcApocalypse,0,Sat Jul 18 07:29:48 2015 UTC,Also I recommend blood money as there's two 3 possible places for people to be and 3 possible locations for you to snipe at and avoid.
BF_Hardline,3dowsx,JcApocalypse,1 point,Sat Jul 18 07:30:46 2015 UTC,"play Downtown, get on one of the roofs (there are elevators in 3 buildings that go to the top, you can use helicopter and use zipline to get to a few other places.), shoot people on the other roofs or people on the ground, if possible high ticket servers = more opportunity to stack up marksman points and get coins.    play Derailed, get to the chopper, fly on top of the big Crane, set up your tent and fireplace. if anybody is already up there, switch squads until you are in the same team and spawn on them, they re-spawn on you, you re-spawn on them if one of you gets killed.    took me 2 afternoons this way, made me feel dirty... but i got the knockout now and never need to touch a sniper again...    ...just please, when you get the knockout, don't use it on me? k? ... that thing is a beast!  ...and don't bother using the AWM with a straight pull bolt, since the patch the animation is massively bugged."
BF_Hardline,3dowsx,ZeroBANG,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:53:28 2015 UTC,"I feel the need to say this every time this comes up: Just so you know, you don't need a 250m or greater headshot. You only need headshots that add up to 250m. Getting five 50 meter headshots is just as good."

If not regular rounds, make .338 rounds able to pierce CAT and SUV rounds.  At this point, only thing professionals have to destro vehicles is trip mines and 1 grenade. Maybe make it so that .338 rounds can shoot through the glass or maybe break the glass, at the very least. At least that promotes teamwork."

Actually it does it sees to be a new one introduced in Frostbite after BF4, the new Dragon Age game has the same behaviour re: cutscenes and complex animations, which the devs there explained (and I personally got to confirm when I tried out the 60 FPS in cutscenes thing for Inquisition and got treated to a dragon flying sideways without the wings flapping and out of frame most of the time) as being due to complex animations outright breaking past 30 FPS, and I've noticed some animations in that game outside of cutscenes also play at 30hz no matter what.

You can't effectively use it on just any map, unless of course you equip a supressor.  Heavy barrel is more satisfying though.  Stubby grip works best imo, but some may need the extra reduction in recoil provided by the angled grip.  All in all, one of my favorite guns to use"

BF_Hardline,3dkr2j,HAOLEpride,2,Fri Jul 17 02:34:37 2015 UTC,In same line playing 'RESCUE' or 'CROSSHAIR' with a 100% Rep Perk can earn you a Tier 4 level rather quickly. Just don't die. (Not too difficult)

If you are on defending side rush to their spawn and catch 2/5 players 90% of the time the rest can be killed by your team. I went 23-0 last night on rescue and i got tier 4 by round 3. People are not too bright whilst playing this game so use that to your advantage

BF_Hardline,3dkr2j,Guild_me_bitches,3,Fri Jul 17 18:40:55 2015 UTC,I had that happen but it's pretty easy to avoid them. Once they kill you just drive around on the other side of the map till they realize your not coming there way. Or I normal smash the L1 (spot button) and if I catch any breaching charges in the road I usually bailout before I hit them.

BF_Hardline,3df0tv,NvaderGir,12,Wed Jul 15 19:29:50 2015 UTC,"All of these sound like fun modes, but Pure Hotwire and Gunfight would be the ones I look forward to the most.  King of the Hill is a bit too similar to Blood Money IMHO - a central objective that needs to be dominated.   Fracas should be renamed Brawl."
BF_Hardline,3df0tv,posts_while_naked,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:01:20 2015 UTC,"I'm in total agreement with you, but Pure Hotwire just sounds amazing. It would just be car chases and gunfights, like one big long epic car chase scene from a movie (but with lots more cars!). It would put more emphasis on actual driving too! Trying to ram and run people off the road, pit maneuvers! Man that just sounds glorious.  Honestly everything else is great too, why not have more options? Even King of the Hill while being similar to Blood Money for the central control point would be fun.  But what about expanding on King of the Hill with some kind of rotating central point, between the 5 conquest points that are already coded into the game. Just figure out how the single hill point would rotate between the 5 points (randomly) and that could create some dynamic gameplay."
BF_Hardline,3df0tv,rydogg707,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:35:25 2015 UTC,"Yup, it's amazing when you get a round or two of Hotwire where people actually drive cars and have chases going - a mode that guarantees this would be golden. It's so disappointing that many believe Hotwire is ""one team camps, one team drives"".  Rotating points sounds good, better than the dev's suggestion. I'd go with that. In fact, the different modes are something that Hardline really does well in comparison to BF4."
BF_Hardline,3df0tv,posts_while_naked,5,Thu Jul 16 19:27:25 2015 UTC,"pure hotwire sounds like a neat idea... if the object of hotwire was to get car to car action, that would ultimately solve all the problems with the mode and make it strictly car to car gun fights. sounds more enjoyable than its current state."
BF_Hardline,3df0tv,SkimSTi,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:28:48 2015 UTC,It would make it more about the driving! Just huge long car chases!
BF_Hardline,3df0tv,rydogg707,2,Thu Jul 16 18:36:55 2015 UTC,yes and no... you can still kill people with your primary super fast car to car. but at least you wont get breached randomly or RPGd out of nowhere.
BF_Hardline,3df0tv,SkimSTi,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:12:09 2015 UTC,"Exactly right. Which is why I think we'd have less people standing around trying to shoot cars. With no explosives to try and take a car out, it would pull the focus back to just driving."
BF_Hardline,3df0tv,rydogg707,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:28:13 2015 UTC,precisely. hopefully this mode change happens.
BF_Hardline,3df0tv,SkimSTi,5,Thu Jul 16 20:55:07 2015 UTC,TBH all those sound awesome.
BF_Hardline,3df0tv,Slaytaniccc,5,Wed Jul 15 20:21:55 2015 UTC,Megahealth sounds great since it makes nades and explosives less effectoce aswell.

BF_Hardline,3df0tv,DANNYonPC,2,Wed Jul 15 20:03:17 2015 UTC,Gunfight sounds fun.

BF_Hardline,3df0tv,Time_Itself,2,Wed Jul 15 19:36:33 2015 UTC,"I wonder how a no primaries mode would work. I guess that would be Gunfight but with gadgets. What's the motivation for taking out gadgets? A no grenades mode would make the shield better.  Highjack, AI armored truck drives around map, is claimed conquest style and will follow a lead car once captured on normal roads around the map."
BF_Hardline,3df0tv,nova311,2,Wed Jul 15 21:03:50 2015 UTC,"All of these sounds awesome af. Although I have one question, is this CTE stuff available on consoles(New to BF)? And I also would like to see a Gunfight tasers only kinda like CoD's One In The Chamber."
BF_Hardline,3df0tv,FalconiiLV,3,Thu Jul 16 00:34:10 2015 UTC,CTE is the Community Test Environment. It is currently PC-only and available only to Premium members. It may later come to consoles but there are legal and financial considerations with consoles that make it more difficult. You can find out more on the CTE Battlelog.
BF_Hardline,3df0tv,nova311,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:24:45 2015 UTC,"Too bad, this could've sold Premium for me."
BF_Hardline,3df0tv,BrawlerAce,2,Thu Jul 16 18:12:15 2015 UTC,"Gunfight, to be honest, sounds the most interesting to me. I think this, if used as one of the more major modes, would really make Hardline feel like a cops vs. robbers shooter because it's a lot more authentic to be fighting with handguns than with modern military equipment like rocket launchers and machine guns. Pure Hotwire also sounds like a great idea, to make Hotwire the mode it was supposed to be. Mega health might encourage some of the PC community to come back, which is very good of course seeing as BFH's PC community is dead, at least in America."
BF_Hardline,3df0tv,Lourdes_Humongous,2,Thu Jul 16 02:05:56 2015 UTC,This thread from yesterday has alot of good suggestions- https://www.reddit.com/r/BF_Hardline/comments/3dau3v/what_gamemode_do_you_want_to_see_in_the_upcoming/
BF_Hardline,3df0tv,Muffknutscher,2,Thu Jul 16 03:18:48 2015 UTC,What about a Gunmaster mod for BFH? And KOTH mod is great. Love to play this on ARMA.
BF_Hardline,3df0tv,FalconiiLV,2,Thu Jul 16 10:21:30 2015 UTC,"BF3 Gunmaster was great. They just added it to BF4 and it's... not great. This is because of the way they implemented it (my opinion). It's just the TDM maps and TDM spawn system in a new game mode. This means that you are running from the edges of the map to a central place to fight. Players who already have the upper hand in terms of guns just mow down the cannon fodder running in. To do it right you need maps designed for Gunmaster with a spawn system to match. Do it right and I'd be all for it, too."
BF_Hardline,3df0tv,CrossBones3129,2,Thu Jul 16 16:30:25 2015 UTC,I'd rather them fixing the game and fixing the dlc for ps4 premium users being able to download then worry about a fuckin king of the hill game.

BF_Hardline,3df0tv,CrossBones3129,1 point,Sat Jul 18 12:08:15 2015 UTC,You got the ultimate edition?
BF_Hardline,3df0tv,SkacikPL,0,Sat Jul 18 14:12:23 2015 UTC,"Really what's the point.  If it's CTE only - there's like 20 people who are more or less active in BFH CTE.  If it's meant to be released one day - mostly pointless on PC, with the limited playerbase nobody plays other modes than conquest/hotwire and bloodmoney.  Sometimes TDM servers get populated and that's that."
BF_Hardline,3df0tv,BillyHoWCR,2,Wed Jul 15 23:11:13 2015 UTC,"The entire point is to gauge interest in the CTE, and get feedback on what people would want with servers like those. Lot of people would populate it if KOTH was on there.  As for PC playerbase, that's not really related, because if they made it to the retail version, they would be released on all versions of the game -- not just PC. The problem with how many people are playing on PC is a separate issue. It sucks, but who knows, maybe people would populate the game again with the addition of these type of modes."
BF_Hardline,3df0tv,BillyHoWCR,-1,Wed Jul 15 23:46:01 2015 UTC,"Issue is, currently a method to gauge interest is not readily available to this game as this subreddit is poorly populated and does not come close to representing the player base.   And CTE is less so populated and never reflects console base... well because it is PC play.  So as is taught in business, if you use a focus group that is not actually representative of your wanted and active user base then you are being counter productive."
BF_Hardline,3df0tv,KITTvsKARR,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:33:44 2015 UTC,"Uhh okay.. So in your point of view, what would you suggest?"
BF_Hardline,3df0tv,FalconiiLV,-1,Thu Jul 16 03:45:26 2015 UTC,"I would suggest they not seriously think of using a PC focus base to make changes for their current console community game.   I would also suggest they figure a way to do a CTE for console users. (making CTE available to console users by having them play on PC is not representative of the user and experience)  Currently PC users are not interested in BFH. So having a CTE to help determine what might grab their attention is a good idea. But it would need to be populated and used extensively for any true data to be earned from it. And even then that data does not correlate to console users, so to say that these ideas are going to then be made across all platforms with just a PC user base as sampling is incredulous in a business standing.   Do I think that it is even possible to get a focus group perspective from console users on BFH? Yes, but not in the way where it is done via hands on CTE play... unless again, said play was on their console and not PC.  The only option other then CTE that could work with console is similar to what Microsoft does (though they even miss out on how they word their choices in survey), they created ""Xbox Live Rewards"". And they use it to gauge interest based on periodic surveys that focus on an area of work.  They populate the site and get survey feedback by rewarding participation with MS points to be used on their console. DICE/EA/Visceral could do similar with rewarding of BFH Gold Battlepacks and or in game currency. It is effective. And it can be implemented within already currently running Battlelog. (Though Uprise is poorly managing that)  Just seeing currently the business management side of the house isn't knowledgeable enough to properly survey customers in a way that will get them accurate data.  Hoping this changes soon though?"
BF_Hardline,3df0tv,FalconiiLV,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:22:27 2015 UTC,So they're considering what was banned for many years (pistol only/restricted weapons) and tank superiority with people.
BF_Hardline,3df0tv,B-Live,2,Wed Jul 15 20:49:30 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure pistol only/restricted weapons servers have been allowed for years now. There were lots of them in BF3 and BF4 at least. In any case I think it's great that they are looking for ways to attract interest.
BF_Hardline,3df0tv,loki993,2,Wed Jul 15 22:36:17 2015 UTC,"And you wouldn't be banned for using them, it would just be disabled when trying to equip. I would really like seeing more servers like this! Especially pistols only"
BF_Hardline,3df0tv,Tyruz,2,Wed Jul 15 22:41:50 2015 UTC,"By the way, the current pistols-only servers can't restrict the primary weapon. Instead, they kick you if you kill someone with a restricted weapon. Sometimes you get a warning, sometimes not.  I think you would have to have several violations before you got banned. A pistols-only game mode by Visceral would not (I assume) have the primary weapon slot enabled, thereby eliminating these issues."

Im just stating facts..why do I spend more money on a game that no one is playing...to play a test version of that game that even less people are playing. It doesn't make sense.   I really do think though that a lot more people would start playing CTE, me included, If they made it available to non premium users."
BF_Hardline,3df0tv,CurbedEnthusiasm,-3,Thu Jul 16 17:20:56 2015 UTC,"Down votes can start now on my post, no need to read further.  If the ideas are kept with DLC then I have no issue. But putting the modes into Vanilla maps and I will be gone myself. (not that I am sure anyone cares.ha)  The dilution of players in Hardline is already starting to happen with CA DLC and I understand and accept the fact it will happen more when future DLC comes out. But when these types of gameplay variants pop-up that segregate the player base then I will take a pass.  Won't be as much issue at all on PS4 and XOne as they have a large enough player base to withstand the dilution. But PS3 and x360 then it is going to fall the way of 'Rescue' and 'Crosshair' where you will find many modes being near impossible to find actively played.   Analogy time: give 10 kids a ball and you got the promise of some team oriented play. Give 10 kids each a different kind of ball... and some will want to play baseball, some football, others tennis, etc. and everybody is going to want to play with their favorite games and the likely chance you are going to get to play a team oriented game...?   More is better when you have multiple players to participate... but lessen the player base and more equals issues."

BF_Hardline,3de74e,Helixfury,2,Wed Jul 15 19:33:08 2015 UTC,BF4  The Master Chief Collection  Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare  Call of Duty: Ghosts  Destiny  Farcry  Borderlands: The Pre Sequel  Borderlands 2  Titanfall  Wolfenstein  Wolfenstein The new Order  Metro 2033  Metro Last Light  Evolve  and parts of GTA V  These are all of the FPS games on Xbox One
BF_Hardline,3de74e,AgathaCrispy,2,Wed Jul 15 19:46:13 2015 UTC,"I meant games with online multiplayer, since that is what the discussion was about. Yes, it wasn't the only FPS available when it released, but it is one of the relative few available with online multiplayer. PC has probably hundreds of multiplayer FPS for Hardline to compete with. On XBONE and PS4, there were what... 8 or 9? Huge difference, and one that has contributed to the lack of adoption on PC. That, and people feeling like it is  a 'BF4 DLC.'"
BF_Hardline,3de74e,nastylep,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:55:26 2015 UTC,"Well Borderlands, GTAV, and Destiny can't be compared here. I'd say Farcry can't either.   Titanfall was a joke.

The single player missions are really fun also.  It's a bit easier to kill people than in BF4, and there are also more kill trades which is kind of annoying.  If you're on XB1 or PS4 pick it up.  The PC player base is pretty much gone from what I've been seeing.  I'm on XB1.  The only issue I have is the server browser, it doesn't list any servers at all since the latest update, but I can join quick matches with no problem.  I saw a screen grab from yesterday and there were 600 on console, 15k on XB1, 18k on PS4.  XB1 has plenty of people online."

Invisible walls all over the place, little spots in uncap that you can fit into and kill from, hit registration, etc. This game is so borked it's not funny. The absolute best thing in this game is the taser.  Once I complete the last Syndicate I am done. (one more 4 times rep as mechanic) I am going back to BF4.  Or maybe, you know, go outside...."

BF_Hardline,3de74e,EndoveProduct,2,Fri Jul 17 10:50:15 2015 UTC,"Depends on alot of things. If you like the Battlefield games, you'll get a kick out of this one. It's generally a quicker game, tons of new and fun modes, with future DLC that seems to be trying new things, mostly related to Cops and Robbers though. Alot of fun.  If you're more into single player. Single player in this game is surprisingly VERY good. I didnt expect it to be, but I have no major issue with the single player.

BF_Hardline,3ddd8a,AMidgetAndAClub,3,Wed Jul 15 21:43:26 2015 UTC,This is why I like this game as well over BF4.  I personally am just not into vehicles.  I am pretty horrible at it though.  They need to fix the spawn system in TDM and bring in a domination mode and I would be loving this game a lot more.
BF_Hardline,3ddd8a,XboxWigger,5,Wed Jul 15 14:49:23 2015 UTC,"If you're not into vehicle gameplay, then I'm not sure Battlefield is the FPS franchise you should be playing."
BF_Hardline,3ddd8a,pickapart21,3,Wed Jul 15 16:51:22 2015 UTC,There is nothing wrong with enjoying the gunplay in the Battlefield series.
BF_Hardline,3ddd8a,NvaderGir,2,Wed Jul 15 23:50:41 2015 UTC,"Some people are more into ""soft"" rock-paper-scissors vehicle gameplay like in Hardline. Main BF series is based on ""hard"" vehicle matchups that give you more power to dominate.  A helicopter is much more powerful in BF4 with its rockets, splash damage etc. Tanks are tanks, invulnerable to small arms. I like Hardline precisely because vehicles, while fun and still present, are not as dominant on the battlefield."
BF_Hardline,3ddd8a,posts_while_naked,2,Thu Jul 16 03:23:36 2015 UTC,Plus I think it helps infantry combat since there isn't rpg's available for your class.  Having to equip a vehicle with an armory or run to a location on a map helps with thinning out rocket spamming.
BF_Hardline,3ddd8a,mylilponyranger,2,Fri Jul 17 14:52:51 2015 UTC,There's nothing wrong with not being a fan of the vehicle play but a fan of the gun play. After all the small arms are even more important in BF than the vehicles no?
BF_Hardline,3ddd8a,brontesaur,-2,Thu Jul 16 07:13:33 2015 UTC,"Gametime for hardline?  yes and no, While its great to bring new players to the game, look at what it did to BF4, so many cheaters :/"

I can upload video of games where these things happen but it's my point of view and the push for packages usually ends with me dead and not able to clearly see what happens. I suspect it has something to do with how the point is deactivated as problems usually become apparent with the phrase ""I'm headed to the other drop point"" from the chopper pilot."
BF_Hardline,3ddu5x,TheActualPegasus,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:22:50 2015 UTC,"I've had it happen on both PS4, and Xbox One, and I barely play any Heist.  Also, reproducibility isn't really required to fix it. The logic for the game type probably isn't terribly complicated. It might be simple enough and obvious what the bug is if they just glance at the code and think about the ways it could break."
BF_Hardline,3ddu5x,BillyHoWCR,1 point,Fri Jul 17 08:28:27 2015 UTC,"I haven't had that issue but I have had the issue many times lately in Heist where as Police it will get near end of round with maybe a few minutes left and suddenly nobody can spawn once they die. And this makes it so that as long as one Criminal guy stays alive then he can walk slowly to the extraction point uncontested.  Note it actually causes both sides to not be able to respawn... but it favors criminal side more as usually you have a criminal guy or two hanging back and police side the thought of dying is less damning when this is not occurring, so when it does occur it is too late as you are dead already when you realize it."
BF_Hardline,3ddu5x,BillyHoWCR,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:13:38 2015 UTC,I've had that unable to respawn bug happen to me once too. It was only a 6v6. I wonder if that has anything to do with it.

BF_Hardline,3dav7h,BillyHoWCR,0,Wed Jul 15 02:40:31 2015 UTC,That is the way it should be but for some reason it was changed for Hardline? Currently needing to stay alive as the last member of your squad has little to no purpose.
BF_Hardline,3dav7h,FalconiiLV,3,Wed Jul 15 03:28:33 2015 UTC,"No, thanks. I'd hate for my Reputation tier to be determined by randoms. I accepted the ""Bro Bar"" mechanics in BF4 but Hardline's is better IMHO."
BF_Hardline,3dav7h,BillyHoWCR,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:42:34 2015 UTC,"Except the only difference is BF4 concept allows an added life variable that BFH does not. I am not talking on removing the perks (I think that was a thing in BF4 when squad all died?), simply talking that if you die and your squad still has an active person alive then your Tier progression would not be lost.  Currently not many are able to use the Tier progression past 2 or 3. But allowing squad survival to save progression towards Tier would make at least that 'Last man in squad' pop up to have some meaning and actually help some make it to Tier 4 now."

That's the part I'm referring to and the part I don't like. If the squad wiped, your perks ALL reset to zero and you start over. That's the part that is left to random pubs in BF4 if you don't have a squad of friends to play with."

This is the key point that is lost on many. As they see the BF4 Tier system and think that the BFH system works the same with squads. (I believe it should be changed to do so, as currently BFH squad affiliation is next to no purpose, as currently when the 'last in squad' pop-up appears it mean absolutely nothing to how I play... because it has no effect if I die.)  Obviously doing everything from start to finish is the best option as it requires only a total of 6000 points to reach Tier 4. Each death restarts the counter for next Tier and thus adds the required amount of points.   I would recommend anyone that is attempting to Reach Tier 4 simply take more pause in their play once reaching Tier 3. Because at that point any death will earn a minimum 3000 point addition to their earning process."

BF_Hardline,3dau3v,DANNYonPC,3,Tue Jul 14 21:02:04 2015 UTC,I'd like to see something different to previous battlefields. Maybe some asymmetrical multiplayer or modes which encourage non-lethal take downs much more.  EDIt: Maybe some sort of hooligans/demonstrators with baseball bats and molotovs VS police with riot shields and tasers. Hooligans/demonstrators have to wreck certain buildings and the police have to arrest them. The number of players doesn't necessarily have to been equal if this could help with balancing.
BF_Hardline,3dau3v,coldape,2,Tue Jul 14 21:15:58 2015 UTC,Like BF2's roots with conquest assault (is also in BF3 on some maps)
BF_Hardline,3dau3v,Bro-LoElCunado,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:19:08 2015 UTC,"Anything unique like /u/coldape mentions would be fantastic. I'm a big fan of the classic modes like King of the Hill and CTF as well. My favourite mode would have to be Rush though which Heist is pretty much the equivalent.  In the end, though, the unfortunate and pessimistic reality for these new modes in a small Oceania player-base means that no-one will get a chance to experience them often, much like happened in BF4 too."
BF_Hardline,3dau3v,Funkeren,2,Tue Jul 14 21:44:49 2015 UTC,"I only played rush in bf4, and I would love to see it in hardline. Heist is good, but its really not the same. Most of the time its about getting the pack of money in a car or heli and get the heck out. Rush is more action in 1 point oriented, push foward as a team etc."
BF_Hardline,3dau3v,Bro-LoElCunado,1 point,Wed Jul 15 08:43:50 2015 UTC,Rush was the perfect mode in Bad Company 2. I struggled to find any servers with Rush in BF4. The DLC maps were horribly tuned for Rush too :(
BF_Hardline,3dau3v,EliteDangerous,2,Wed Jul 15 08:56:34 2015 UTC,"I think you could do a rush mode but you would have to change the dynamic, criminals take down a defended ATM, then the criminals have to get away with the cops spawning behind the criminals instead of ahead of them. Effectively the cops would have to chase the criminals like NFS Hot Pursuit.  I think they have a game mode like this planned for one of the expansion packs."
BF_Hardline,3dau3v,EliteDangerous,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:00:39 2015 UTC,"Two base defend and destroy.   For the criminals it could be defending drug operations, money printing presses, computer hacking labs.  For the police it could be surveillance systems, weapon depots, evidence lockers.  Maybe have one bomb on the map that you need to move to a spot in either base, plant it and detonate it."

BF_Hardline,3dau3v,SupersonicJaymz,1 point,Wed Jul 15 08:45:15 2015 UTC,"Anything that encourages PTFO and reduces camping RPG spammers. Hotwire that increases points for teamplay like criminal convoys, police roadblocks (and not cops driving around the same cars as the criminals). And where are the bystanders? Seriously, GTA has loads of NPCs. It would be nice to see a mode I call ""Next to Die"". Titanfall's Marked for Death except combined with Hotwire (more mobile targets). I like the nonfatal and melee ideas and think some more outfit and weapon customizations to improve visual diversity would be nice. AND WE WANT TO DRIVE THE TRACTOR TRAILER COMMAND CENTER! Or at least a modified tanker with a cargo box on the back that you can shoot out of like the Mobile Command Center. Having fun. Cops and Robbers. Great game!"
BF_Hardline,3dau3v,JasonKesler,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:25:16 2015 UTC,"Every squad for itself. 4 squads of 4 players each. To respawn, your squadmates must lay down a respawn marker, and it must be actioned by a team mate for 20 seconds (two teammates for 10 seconds, etc.) for each player to be respawned. The whole squad respawns in a random location together once all squadmates have been eliminated.  Maybe a King of the Hill version along the same lines."

It just felt like it had been shoe horned into BF4.  Rush modes on maps designed for rush and I'd be a happy man.
BF_Hardline,3dau3v,SkimSTi,1 point,Wed Jul 15 12:58:36 2015 UTC,I want to see in hardline RUSH because the can made it with an Computer and the mission for the criminals are to hack the computer datas from the police!

I love BF4 as much as the next guy, but I HAVE to be in the mood for it, otherwise I get frustrated really easily. This is usually why I used to just go on Metro or Locker, because it's mindless fun. BFH as a whole feels like mindless fun all the time, and that's why I love it so much.  I don't really have any other games, except GTA where I can just switch my brain off, and mess around. Also, Rescue is able to provide that strategic side to Hardline if I ever need it, and I tend to have a lot of fun on that.  Like others have said also, it being more infantry focused. Vehicles are good, but going out and getting mauled by a Tank is not my idea of fun. I like being on my feet, I'm better at taking people down in an infantry situation than having all these other distractions to watch out for too. If I position myself well on this game, I've been on a few crazy streaks before.  Not much downtime between games also, it seems very seamless on this game, and I don't feel like I'm the menus a lot."

This. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKFvroDhXfU  Holding down the top corner of the roof... this is one of the few areas where you can dominate if you're constantly checking the interior, glass roof, and the two outside perimeters. The amount of kills you can achieve here is insane but what makes it so much fun is that eventually half the team begins parachuting down and you're defending ""your"" area from all angles with guns blazing. No other map has a spot quite like this and its also just as fun taking it over when you find an enemy doing the same thing."
BF_Hardline,3d92iy,skillfactor,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:35:10 2015 UTC,Holding down the top corner of the roof... this is one of the few areas where you can dominate   I find that the easiest area to get campers out of. Grenades alone can take out that area. Not understanding the domination aspect of it with the ease of being able to eliminate anyone trying to hold it down?   Though I do like me some TDM downtown. Where by far the best place to hold down would be the highest rooftop. Enabling best access to all other areas of the map. And by far the hardest area to route out a team holding it down.
BF_Hardline,3d92iy,BillyHoWCR,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:57:34 2015 UTC,"Grenades are easy to maneuver around. The area is just big enough to avoid them without dying. I agree the highest rooftop is also fun but enemies are usually running routes closer to the spot I like. A good player can rake in 70+ kills a match (default server settings) from just that one area and never worry about whoever is camping way way way up top. If you're hanging out on the skyscrapers instead, then you also miss out on the epic parachute action as enemies are dropping in like clay targets from above haha"

BF_Hardline,3d92iy,BillyHoWCR,2,Tue Jul 14 16:31:02 2015 UTC,"Honestly, the thing i like the most is the 32v32 team action. This isn't specific to Hardline, i know. But i've never played BF on PC nor have i played BF3/4. So this is my first experience with 64-person lobbies.   Additionally i like that the game is slightly more infantry-focused than previous titles. For people, like me, who aren't very good with vehicles (or just don't like spending too much time in them), it's fun not having to worry about getting killed by enemy vehicles all the time.    I like the gun-variety. Again, probably not as good as previous titles, but i feel like there's enough for me to enjoy.   I also think that Blood Money and Heist are two pretty cool game-modes. A bit chaotic on some maps, but generally they're fun to play."

I myself currently am enjoying the smaller game modes when I find them. 'Rescue',  'Crosshair', though truthfully difficult when playing with a random squad against an organized squad... but still fun none the less.   Am enjoying the first to 5 wins competitive aspect and the quick multiple games that they have.   Though I do get the 'not again' moments when a VIP will go all 'Leeroy Jenkins' on our squad and think he can charge ahead of his team. (more often then not leading to an instant death) ha"

BF_Hardline,3d9ise,XboxWigger,3,Tue Jul 14 15:39:12 2015 UTC,"I'm going to be the negative Nancy, and tell you not to play TDM, it's a broken mess in its current state. 64 players is too much for the spawn system, with the constant spawn camping, spawn insta-deaths, and spawning with someone behind/in front of you, you'll be better off playing blood money, or heist if you actually like to live longer than 10 seconds."
BF_Hardline,3d9ise,xCapTainDuLah,2,Tue Jul 14 19:12:41 2015 UTC,Stay on the edges of TDM maps. Don't rush into the middle of the map or into a group of enemies.  Take your time and try to move and stay behind some sort of cover when firing. Pay attention to the mini map and spot people so they appear on your team mates maps. Headphones are helpful as they give you audible clues as to where enemies are moving and shooting. Figure out which class and weapons you enjoy and are effective with and the licenses will come quickly. Don't forget to use the gadgets!  BF is a much different game then COD. Running around like a mad man and flopping onto the ground when you see an enemy won't work. Slow down and learn the game mechanics. The BF4 is a great series once you master it.
BF_Hardline,3d9ise,ElementR,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:29:10 2015 UTC,"Basically everything he just said. Though remember... ""Running around like a mad man and flopping onto the ground when you see an enemy won't work"" is true, also true is that playing too safe can be equally as damning in TDM.   The most important thing I could add is to learn the maps, learn them to the point of knowing where tendencies are going to tell you where the enemy are going to be coming from next.   After awhile you will have at times a near ESP of where an enemy is going to appear on map to confront you. (though that doesn't always mean you will be able to confront them with equal pre-determined outcome of winning.ha)   Looking at the map as said above is your friend. And those who can use start button to look at full map instead of staring at the leaderboards will find their effectiveness in combat even more so.   I am far from being a great player, average at best. But I find people can worry about me on the battlefield more then not when I get my roll on and really want to hurt others in game. ;)"

BF_Hardline,3d9ise,xGRNxiCool,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:49:57 2015 UTC,"Up until about a week ago i only played a few games of TDM because i had a similar problem to yours. I thought it was a poorly designed/chosen game-type for a game like Hardline. But i gave it another try about a week ago, and it's all i've been playing since. Previously, coming from a CoD background myself, i tried to treat BF like CoD. I'd try to run-and-gun, and generally that meant i'd get 1 kill (2 if i was lucky) and then die.    Then i started using my head and i started playing a bit more passively. I'm not telling you to stand/sit in one spot the entire match, but keep movement to a minimum. You don't need to go looking for action when there are 32 enemy players. Action will happen all around you. Generally i found that if i stuck to a confined area i'd see a lot more action than i would if i was to run around looking for it.    Try to stay out of the center of the map. Stay on the outlines, and pick people off. Be aware of your mini-map (pretty basic and obvious advice for any FPS, really). Just take your time and realise that there are 64 players on a pretty small map. Enemies will spawn behind you, next to you, and on top of you. Try not to get pissed off at this.   Once you get the hang of things in TDM, i think it's one of the easiest ways to boost your KD."

I got my Heist portion of the 'Elite Player Syndicate Assignment' when it was required to get 30,000 per game mode.   Playing Heist, on Criminal side, as Hacker, against another enemy Hacker, with your team hopefully forced to take the match to near full time will give you best chance at getting most points possible.  I earned 18K+ during a 2XP weekend to get my needed point total. (the 2XP pushed my total over 30K previously needed) So without a 2XP weekend it is still possible to earn 10k+ fairly easy playing as Hacker as stated above."

It not a problem with BF it's a problem with Xbox. For some reason, when your Xbox hibernates it messes up some functions of the game. I remember when The Witcher 3 just came out, when you resumed your gaming session after your Xbox went into auto-standby, you were not able to save the game.

BF_Hardline,3d7jlx,TheActualPegasus,0,Tue Jul 14 03:28:35 2015 UTC,If you are on PS3 or x360 then there is no option in game to choose Mission Tab. It is only available to PS4/XOne/PC players while in game.   Use of the PC link I submitted is the only way for old console players to claim reward and view progress. Link is now inserted into each community mission news post on Battlelog incase you can't find it on your Battlelog on PC. (which PS3 and x360 users don't even have tab on PC Battlelog outside of game)  An XOne and/or PS4 player would have to assist you if you are trying to locate tab in game? As I do not play this game on those systems.  Hope that helps?  Note: I had requested Mods here on the subreddit to add a quick link to the right side of the page for users but have gotten no response on the issue. It would assist those on x360 and PS3 at least in having a place they know said link exists all the time.

The only fix by them as I mentioned before was them adding the link itself to all Community Mission notices. I have commented many times on their poor coding skills along with logistic handling of data on Battlelog.

BF_Hardline,3d5pdk,SkimSTi,6,Mon Jul 13 18:58:52 2015 UTC,"It's not the player counts, the game is just bad.    One reason is the TTK.  The TTK is very fast and when you combine that with the accuracy that a player has with a mouse, you often die instantly if the enemy sees you first.  Because of that ""instant death"" most of the skill is sucked out of weapon handling.  That means it plays like COD more than a Battlefield game.    Add on horrible weapon imbalance with K10 and shotguns that have a longer range than necessary and the game doesn't reward skill the way other Battlefield games do.  The nuance like managing recoil, burst firing, understanding your weapon are gone -- instead it plays like a bad COD clone."

BF_Hardline,3d5pdk,fugazied,9,Fri Jul 17 15:08:49 2015 UTC,One issue is that guns have very little recoil in this game compared to other BF titles. On console it isn't that big of a difference. On pc it is easier to control recoil than on console so essentially there is no recoil at all. A Visceral dev said they want to create different recoil for pc players but he/she wasn't sure if the EA/Visceral heads would be down.
BF_Hardline,3d5pdk,FROGxDELIVER,6,Mon Jul 13 19:31:56 2015 UTC,They sucked most of the skill out of the game and turned it into a COD clone with insta-deaths.
BF_Hardline,3d5pdk,fugazied,3,Tue Jul 14 07:54:49 2015 UTC,"Well it has to do with the recoil in a way, but I think it more points to the lower TTK. The low TTK isn't necesarrily a bad thing, however with Battlefield's inherantly BAD netcode, the lower TTK makes gunfights on pc much shorter. But the mouse and keyboard definately makes it easier to get those headshots with the lower recoil on most guns which I guess is why people want them to increase the recoil for pc... But if they were to fix anything major it should be the netcode, but that is always something they haven't quite been able to get right :/ it's always on the lower end when it comes to the tic/refresh rate on battlefield servers..."
BF_Hardline,3d5pdk,DAGam3r,2,Mon Jul 13 20:03:12 2015 UTC,"Low TTK is also an issues because of BF map design.  A map that has lanes can have a fast TTK because the skill contest still occurs (peeking and aiming).  When you can be shot from 20 angles while running between flags and you instantly die (without a chance to return fire), the skill contest is gone.  Great for casual gamers, bad for skill contests."
BF_Hardline,3d5pdk,DAGam3r,4,Tue Jul 14 07:56:48 2015 UTC,"I have to agree. The combination of the TTK mixed with hit registration/netcode/damage funneling/whatever problems are my biggest issue with the game(on PC). When it takes longer to ADS than it does to be killed in a heads up gunfight, it's a problem, IMO. I'd like to come back to the game, but the gunfights aren't that fun as it sits. Maybe someday..."

BF_Hardline,3d5pdk,FROGxDELIVER,2,Mon Jul 13 22:33:28 2015 UTC,Fast TTK exacerbated by damage from multiple shots being delivered in a single frame leading to a seemingly instant kill.
BF_Hardline,3d5pdk,DAGam3r,0,Mon Jul 13 22:37:39 2015 UTC,"you either love it or hate it. i like it because it brings a hardcore game mode feel with all the benefits like minimap etc from regular mode. its realistic. i imagine if you even get hit by ONE bullet in real life, you are going to go down instantly (cant say from experience) i personally enjoy the faster time to kill. really brings up the skill level of reaction time. you have to be on point or you will simply lose the battle. to me thats a challenge compared to BF4. i enjoy that."

Real life doesn't really factor in, as far as I'm concerned. We'll have to agree to disagree on it bringing up the skill level. Glad you enjoy it, though."
BF_Hardline,3d5pdk,Zergonaplate,3,Mon Jul 13 23:14:15 2015 UTC,"I haven't played for a few weeks and checked servers last night, quite a few less players than before. I love the game on PC but it seems to have crossed the line where I won't be able to get full games in the mode I want anymore. I do hope they do a free week/month or something to bring people back, but I think the chances are slim. I don't think I'll get it on the consoles just for the extra players though, so unless something changes my time with Hardline is pretty much over."
BF_Hardline,3d5pdk,DarthPneumono,2,Mon Jul 13 22:12:30 2015 UTC,No plays on PC anymore. Especially with hundreds of other FPS games that have a bigger community.   Dumbest business move to release a FPS game to compete with BF4. When us PC gamers are going to stick with a game that has alot of servers and tons of features in it.
BF_Hardline,3d5pdk,SkimSTi,3,Tue Jul 14 17:36:45 2015 UTC,"It's not so much that the game is bad. It's just that there's a lot more competition on the PC, and because it is generally regarded as one of the worse BF games, PC players are just going to the other games they have available. This means the player base has shrunk considerably, and that makes the experience worse for those that stay, so they leave too, making it worse and so on."
BF_Hardline,3d5pdk,logicalwayswins,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:11:19 2015 UTC,I don't know. I heard a lot of people on PS4 prefer bf4. Person ally the last bf game I played was bf 3 back to karkand back on the 360. I like hardline a lot more.
BF_Hardline,3d5pdk,Pancakewagon26,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:24:59 2015 UTC,"But it's not just competition in the Battlefield series, it's about every single other shooter (and other games) available. CS:GO of course takes a huge chunk, along with a bunch of more indie type things like Dirty Bomb, and more realistic sims like ARMA. It splits the number of users up even further."
BF_Hardline,3d5pdk,markamoose,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:23:27 2015 UTC,"from my observations, on console, it seems to be pretty 50/50 to me. Handfuls prefer hardline, other handfuls prefer BF4... 2 completely different types of games, in my opinion, so it just depends what you enjoy. i personally never liked vehicle/jet/chopper gameplay. so i mainly stayed infantry on BF4. now with hardline, im going up against mainly infantry, and i love that. HL > BF4 is my vote."
BF_Hardline,3d5ft0,FalconiiLV,6,Mon Jul 13 17:49:55 2015 UTC,"The only one that honestly sucks is the LE Motorcycle helmet. 100 Hotwire takedown coins, really? That's multiples of three to get a single coin. So three takedowns is one coin and five takedowns... is still one coin. Not sure how many of you are familiar with Hotwire but games are rarely close and the only map that really makes takedowns easier is Downtown. Otherwise the game almost always devolves into a campfest and is impossible to get the coins. You're either losing and getting camped or winning going against a team losing, getting camped.  IMO it should have been 100 takedowns and not 100 coins. Compare the motorcycle helmet against the rabbit mask and it's easy to see a huge discrepancy."
BF_Hardline,3d5ft0,tyler2k,3,Mon Jul 13 17:57:24 2015 UTC,I agree completely. I have 5 takedown coins done and don't see myself trying to complete the rest of this assignment.
BF_Hardline,3d5ft0,BillyHoWCR,0,Mon Jul 13 18:36:51 2015 UTC,"I have x66 HOTWIRE TAKEDOWN COINS, they are fairly easy to get if you try. Simply Sabotage Hotwire Vehicles and then ready your RPG in the trunk.   If you focus only on this coin then you should be able to knock them out in a week or so? I got my current coin count simply through regular gameplay, had I dedicated my time to just destroying cars while playing Hotwire then it would have been I am sure a lot quicker to acquire x100?  You can easily get x2 coins per game if you actually dedicate yourself to taking down vehicles and not driving in them. More so if you get on a good run? So that would be 50 games of Hotwire. Not too many if you ask me? I can sometimes get 30 games a night in."
BF_Hardline,3d5ft0,BillyHoWCR,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:40:45 2015 UTC,"I suppose you are right. Run Mechanic and sabotage or Enforcer and C4 then get an RPG in every car. I don't really want to be ""that guy"" but what choice is there? I know it's part of Hotwire but I feel dirty focusing solely on blowing up vehicles."

BF_Hardline,3d5ft0,coldape,3,Tue Jul 14 02:06:05 2015 UTC,They're stupid requirements and they encourage people to sell out their teams and ignore objectives. Of course that applies to a lot of the assignments in Battlefield games.
BF_Hardline,3d5ft0,BillyHoWCR,3,Mon Jul 13 18:01:53 2015 UTC,I think they're quite good fun.
BF_Hardline,3d5ft0,coldape,2,Mon Jul 13 19:51:18 2015 UTC,"(I don't see TDM as viable for melee kills but perhaps I'm wrong)   In my opinion TDM is one of the best choices for melee kills. Discussion was started on the subject here a few days ago: What mode is best for melee coins?  By far the easiest should be:   25 sledge hammer kills 25 baseball bat kills 50 knife kills   The others aren't impossible but will take some effort.   I myself don't think assignments should be a walk in the park, nor do I think should they be able to be completed in a single sit down. They should be challenging enough that all assignments should take you about a month of regular play in my eyes to complete. That is in my opinion an actual challenge and worthy assignment.   I am still working on Syndicate assignments and enjoying the time/dedication required to do them."
BF_Hardline,3d5ft0,Mayor_S,2,Mon Jul 13 18:21:37 2015 UTC,I've managed to do the ones mentioned but that is how i like to play(see vid pix n mix and hotchpotch) but even I was suprised how much they need you to do for each assignment.

Pulled out grenade and thought I would mess around a little with the kill. Got lucky and got a clean kill. I thought at best I would get away with a few shots in my back as I exited, but knew he wouldn't be able to react quick enough to get away from the blast himself.   I am wondering if he actually even saw me leave the elevator as the door closed behind? ha  I always like to pause in elevators just for this type of situation.

BF_Hardline,3d3vv5,nightbass,0,Mon Jul 13 17:24:46 2015 UTC,I second that. DLC is real fun. It is worth the money. Yes right now not too many people on PC but there are always servers in EU where you can play. You just don't have choice from 20 servers at the moment.   I hope players will slowly jump in and expand our community so we can share the fun with them.

(the later dlcs, the first free one was still OK to find lobbies). maybe it was just me. always seems DLCs and add ons are tougher because people dont want to spend extra money for more."

Comparing apples to apples, FAL vs SG510, the FAL has a faster traveling bullet, further min range, further max range, and higher RoF. The major benefit of the SG510 is the larger clip size, the recoil otherwise is negligible because how much faster the FAL recovers than the SG."

I have got my moneys worth out of the game so far, and like i have said before im happy with hardline but just wish communication was a lot better than it is now between visceral and the player base"
BF_Hardline,3cw943,Djbboy,2,Sat Jul 11 20:09:28 2015 UTC,"Completely agree. Love this game quite a lot but going into a month without being able to access the content i paid for, is pretty pathetic. Been 3 apparent fixes put in place, all with the same outcome. Really cant believe its been dragged out this long."
BF_Hardline,3cw943,frumpypump,2,Sun Jul 12 12:15:00 2015 UTC,"I contacted Sony and ea and eventually after being 'escalated' and 'escalated' by Sony I have received a refund £110 into my psn wallet, it is possible but it does take persistence and it's Sony who owe you the refund as it's their store the game was purchased from.( if that is where you got it). I hope everyone who has had this issue does this.I really wanted this game to be great like the open beta but it has failed  big in so many ways."

BF_Hardline,3cw943,Gamer9131,-6,Mon Jul 13 11:28:43 2015 UTC,Worst supported game you've ever owned? Did you play BF4?
BF_Hardline,3cw943,zebbidy,1 point,Sat Jul 11 14:20:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah i have around 400ish hours in bf4. It was pretty bad at the start, but after 1st year they started to listen to the community and they have always replied to emails and tweets where visceral dont reply what so ever."
BF_Hardline,3cw943,Gamer9131,-2,Sat Jul 11 14:34:28 2015 UTC,"So when DICE doesn't communicate for a year it's fine, but when Visceral doesn't for one month (even though they have said they are fixing it) it isn't?"
BF_Hardline,3cw943,zebbidy,1 point,Sat Jul 11 19:01:34 2015 UTC,"Did you not read what i posted. I said they did reply to emails and tweets.mind you bf4 was a rushed release  and ea did say support for bf4 was lacking in the first year.  When bf4 was kind of crap for a start look at the people who play it now, i wonder if the same will happen to bfh?"
BF_Hardline,3cw943,Gamer9131,-1,Sat Jul 11 19:24:53 2015 UTC,It will. Do you honestly think support will just stop?
BF_Hardline,3cw943,zebbidy,1 point,Sat Jul 11 19:53:12 2015 UTC,Where did you pick up that nugget of info from? I have never said anything like i believe the support will stop.

Unfortunately, I can't really comment more on it.  Have you tried restoring your licenses on PS4 to see if that resolves it? Go to Settings -> PSN Account Management -> Restore Licenses. I don't know if it will fix it for you, but it may be worth a shot."
BF_Hardline,3cw943,zebbidy,1 point,Sat Jul 11 18:24:33 2015 UTC,I appreciate you replying to this thread. Like i have said i really like this game but i preordered ultimate edition on ps4 and like many others cant access CA. I just wanted to let you guys know not to ignore us the whole time. Let us know how things are going to keep people in the picture. As ignoring is makes people go a bit spazz and worry that the support is non existing. Even if its just a weekly update on the matter. Hope you guys get it sorted out soon. I still have faith in you
BF_Hardline,3cw943,zebbidy,1 point,Sat Jul 11 19:32:14 2015 UTC,"As with our convos we have a few weeks back, its been the same all the way through. Pretty tough man. No one replies via twitter anymore and even battlefield twitter ignores messages about it. I created a new twitter account just to test the theory. Had been asking about it from my main account for ages.   Created new account, but when tweeted left out the exact issue, and they replied almost instantly. Told them it was about the PS4 issue, they never replied again haha.."

BF_Hardline,3cw943,Djbboy,1 point,Sun Jul 12 12:02:40 2015 UTC,No worries. Its just a shame it never fixed it for you
BF_Hardline,3cw943,godisevol,0,Sun Jul 12 13:20:04 2015 UTC,Not sure an error message is something you should be seeing in such situation? What was the error message you received?
BF_Hardline,3cw943,BillyHoWCR,0,Sun Jul 12 06:45:40 2015 UTC,In case you are too caught up in self-confirmation : NP-39443-8 which supposedly means 'maintenance' even though PSN is up and running according to Sony.
BF_Hardline,3cw943,godisevol,1 point,Sun Jul 12 11:14:20 2015 UTC,NP-39443-8   Did you mean NP-34993-8? That appears to be the code that represents PSN is undergoing maintenance.   I have not found the error code NP-39443-8. https://support.us.playstation.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/5111/~/ps4%3A-error-codes
BF_Hardline,3cw943,fletch420man,0,Sun Jul 12 11:43:17 2015 UTC,"Yes, I appear to have mixed up the numbers!  Still: according to the Playstation site PSN is up and running without anything down for maintenance/due to problems with the network so that is out of the question.  This is another ongoing issue which sony hasn't deemed important enough to address yet as I am seeing threads dating back to the PS3 ..."
BF_Hardline,3cw943,BillyHoWCR,2,Sun Jul 12 11:48:50 2015 UTC,"So if you consistently get this NP-34993-8 error when trying to restore your license then possibly the issue is more Sony related then not?   Especially seeing that it only is effecting those with the Ultimate Edition on PS4? (from what I have seen)  Here is a current thread that I am looking at now: Restoring Licenses Error ""NP-34993-8"" 22 pages worth of conversation, only on page 5 so far.  It appears people are mentioning multiple PS4 systems and/or sharing with other users? As I think another user referenced in some way?   Have you ever setup the share feature with a friend? I would look at that being the primary issue of cause and go from there.   If I see anything more on the subject that actually has anyone resolving their issue then I will post back.   (and don't worry... this won't prevent me from answering your other posts with their respective due...) ;)"
BF_Hardline,3cw943,BillyHoWCR,2,Sun Jul 12 12:04:32 2015 UTC,When i spoke to EA support directly and told them that same code they even said it was wierd cause that code states that things are offline or down or something. But she was like i can see for a fact that things are online and fine.  Me myself have this same issue and i have never used the share feature or anything of the sort. Have deleted the game 6 or more times and probably downloaded the DLC about 10-15 times.  Its been tough to really understand and i get the impression that its making no sense to EA or Sony..
BF_Hardline,3cw943,CrossBones3129,1 point,Sun Jul 12 12:21:28 2015 UTC,"When i spoke to EA support directly and told them that same code they even said it was wierd cause that code states that things are offline or down or something.

Me myself have this same issue and i have never used the share feature or anything of the sort. Have deleted the game 6 or more times and probably downloaded the DLC about 10-15 times.   Do you have more then one PSN system? PS3 and PS4 maybe?    Its been tough to really understand and i get the impression that its making no sense to EA or Sony..   From looking at this issue fresh it does not appear to be an EA issue as much as a Sony issue. Especially if everyone that has the Ultimate Edition has tried to Restore License and has came across this error? So the thing to do would be to make a post to anyone having this issue... and instead of attacking the Devs, simply request if all have same issue of License Restoring? And if it does show that all users are having same issue then we can at least determine it is a PSN issue and not a game issue. As the game should not be causing systems to not be able to update their Licenses. And past reports on Sony side show the error to be on their end and not games end."
BF_Hardline,3cw943,Covertxof,2,Sun Jul 12 12:34:42 2015 UTC,"No i meant EA directly like i said. Sony direct pretty much did nothing to help in anyway at all. They took into account everything i said and said they know about the issue and are working with the Devs to fix the issue. Been, as i said in another post, almost 4 weeks.  I dont have another system. So this is ruled out.  Whether its an EA issue or Sony issue thats not really my concern. I have spoken to all of them directly and they all point the finger at each other pretty quickly. EA has by far been the best at trying to help solve this issue. They have given us 3 different fixes but every time its delete game and download again, we have fixed it. Only to face the exact same issue. Im in direct contact with EA almost on a daily basis with this.  To explain it all a little better for you, this issue is only affecting European users that happened to pre-order the ultimate edition. Each of these people who have stated this problem all fell under this area. American based users apparently dont have this issue at all. Restoring the licenses causes the same error on all our machines, re-downloading the game and content still presents the same issue with the game unable to detect the content.  Its frustrating. I have escalated the issue to Sony direct, and i requested a refund. They said i would get one within 7-10 days. After 7 days they email back saying that EA have pushed out a fix and that its ok. I go home, test this ""fix"" only to have same issue. I got back to Sony as say nope, issue still remains. They turn around to me and say, we will reopen and escalate this case again, and issue you a refund in another 7-10 days.... Useless."
BF_Hardline,3cw943,Covertxof,1 point,Sun Jul 12 12:54:18 2015 UTC,Isn't that your default answer to everything? Why even bother commenting at all.
BF_Hardline,3cw943,BillyHoWCR,-1,Sun Jul 12 05:30:15 2015 UTC,Wait... a DEv finally comes in to reply and you attack him for replying? Maybe you want to tell him to STFU too? ha You are crazy son.
BF_Hardline,3cw943,BillyHoWCR,2,Sun Jul 12 06:32:41 2015 UTC,He came in to say he can't comment. Which is the only thing he ever says.
BF_Hardline,3cw943,nightbass,2,Sun Jul 12 06:35:13 2015 UTC,But to be fair there's not much more to comment about this shitbox of a game. Anyone involved with the making of this title should be fucking embarrassed for themselves- it's a level of fail not often achieved.
BF_Hardline,3cw943,doodies_,-2,Sun Jul 12 21:05:41 2015 UTC,"He came in to say they are working on the issue with Sony and that it has been slow and frustrating. And then says that he can't comment on that portion of it any more than that.   And then he gives some personal advice in trying to find him a fix and you jump on him for even replying at all. Really who is the one wrong in this post? Not the Dev who actually replied for sure.   And OP replies that he gets an error message when trying to 'Restore Licenses'. So then the next step to this trouble shooting would be in asking what the error message was?   Again, complaining and praying are not going to get anyone anyplace. Try to pay attention and listen to people trying to assist with an issue. It is a lot more constructive then simply barking at a tree."

(though respectfully so, because he has given no cause not too address him as such)   I have also addressed some issues I have seen in game. The only difference between how I address issues and you and your hate squad is that I don't call for the heads of anyone involved in the making of the game and then sit idly bye without try to hunt my own resolution to issues.

If people are having issues with game then going to a subreddit dedicated to the fans of the game is really not the place to do it. Best bet is to go to the source. Where most people do little to help themselves. This guy for instance has not even tried to get his money back. So why does his rant about issue (which again... YES he does have a true issue) need to be brought to this subreddit in the manner it was? He wasn't asking what he could do. He wasn't requesting assistance. He was simply ranting that he still can't play and can't get a refund even without trying.   Try looking at the issues for what they really are.  You know why your type hates me? Because I don't back down from your trollings. You want to come in and post continuous garbage about how you hate the game and don't want anyone to challenge you on it.

BF_Hardline,3cw943,BillyHoWCR,0,Sun Jul 12 07:45:51 2015 UTC,It's just funny that games continue to come out broken because people preorder and then they get butthurt when the game doesn't work properly. Maybe preorderers will finally learn. Lol

I don't need to hear about it all game long in chat, though.  The reason people say ""no skill"" and stuff is because usually the person claiming there's a hacker is someone who's not very good at the game.  Because you'd have to not be very good to think that the only way someone can go 6:1 or whatever is hacking."

BF_Hardline,3cysq8,lonely-day,3,Sun Jul 12 00:33:15 2015 UTC,I think the only problem with that is how hard it is to avoid ambushes with these vehicles. You have predetermined routes and if the cops didn't need to drive all it would be is bombs everywhere.  I think the game would literally go nowhere. I think if it was kinda more like heist where both teams had destinations that would make more sense. Maybe have the vehicles have to be driven for a bit first then they can be removed from the board. Each car could be worth x amount if saved/stolen plus the hot wire points.
BF_Hardline,3cysq8,protothrowaway,1 point,Sun Jul 12 00:53:45 2015 UTC,I like the way you think. What if the made the maps bigger?
BF_Hardline,3cysq8,protothrowaway,2,Sun Jul 12 01:03:05 2015 UTC,Still set routes essentially with bottlenecks and ideal ambush spots. If they added way more routes like alleys and parking lots and made the car more capable of not crashing into the smallest things then maybe bigger maps. I still think if only one team needed to concentrate on cars it would become impossible for that team to win since the vehicles in this game may as well just be giant targets.
BF_Hardline,3cysq8,nastylep,2,Sun Jul 12 01:08:40 2015 UTC,True.
BF_Hardline,3cysq8,wda_exodus,2,Sun Jul 12 01:48:44 2015 UTC,"I think the real problem is how easy it is to take down cars (laser trip mines, the equivalent of claymores... really?) combined with it being a game mode centered around their dogshit vehicle physics. It seems like a mini game to me."

BF_Hardline,3cxakp,rydogg707,3,Sat Jul 11 16:29:30 2015 UTC,"Use server browser, and keyword custom search. That's how I have to find my CA Blood money rooms, always empty servers no matter which settings I try. Search ""CA Blood"" or ""Team Deathmatch"" for what you want."

BF_Hardline,3cxakp,FuryofYuri,3,Sat Jul 11 18:25:48 2015 UTC,Fine a game yourself. Get friends to join on you. As they join on you they join your squad. Switch teams as necessary.
BF_Hardline,3cxakp,FuryofYuri,1 point,Sat Jul 11 18:33:34 2015 UTC,"That's the problem we had when we tried to do that, no switching sides. Every server would put us on opposite teams and switching teams was grayed out. We would even join servers that had like 50/64 to make sure there would have been room to switch sides if we got put on opposite teams.  Are there a lot of official servers that that restrict switching teams and we need to find a server that allows team switching? (we've only been playing since Wednesday... still new to hardline)"
BF_Hardline,3cxakp,FuryofYuri,2,Sat Jul 11 18:48:46 2015 UTC,"When you die, press R1 (In the menu where you change loadout). To the right is a tab called Team, under that is an option to switch teams, (R3 on ps4) always, never grayed out. Only the start menu gets grayed out sometimes."

(gun feels weak)...  i get outgunned by a lot of things. so i put the gun away for now... UZI (post patch) def one of my fav SMGs. great gun.
BF_Hardline,3cx2c3,SkimSTi,2,Mon Jul 13 16:48:00 2015 UTC,"I too did the grind for the ARM, when you use it you sort of have to change your play style and stay back more. This gun is a monster at medium to long range and in the right hands, dominant at close quarters. Soooo basically don't run and gun with this weapon"
BF_Hardline,3cx2c3,UselessAnus,1 point,Tue Jul 14 05:02:28 2015 UTC,"I love this gun. It will outgun anything but snipers at medium and long range. That being said, if you are good at doing headshots you will often outgun snipers too."

BF_Hardline,3cw3dd,Calitron303,1 point,Sat Jul 11 10:59:05 2015 UTC,"i think BF4 has the best solution here - you know how you died, because the camera zooms in on the guy who shot you, right in the moment you die. the ""killer-cam"" in BFH is not as useful, and also kinda broken, cause when the guy who shot you stands with his back against a wall (which they often do), it only shows you that wall from the other side."

I am not a COD player so I really focused off of it based off of the Sniper Elite, and Halo games. And I was watching a replay of one of my games where I got the final kill and it just ended.

BF_Hardline,3ct73b,BillyHoWCR,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:03:10 2015 UTC,I am leaning now towards the idea my Heist matches aren't reflecting my Grenade kills on cops? As I think my TDM kill today did reflect to move it from 19 to 20? (when I was looking at getting my Spa-12 kills I got one by chance)  Will have to play some more TDM to see if it updates further? And then play some more Heist to see if it again reflects no update?  Update: went back and reviewed other games played last night and had another TDM game that did not reflect Grenade kills on the cops. So the idea it is game mode oriented doesn't appear to fly?  Update to the update: tried many more modes and servers and no luck. Then went in and completed  another tick on the Hotwire Portion of the Assignment and then went back into TDM and it started ticking off again. So possibly if it gets stuck for people then try and get one of the other portions of the Assignment to update and then go back to Grenades? Just a thought.

BF_Hardline,3cqvlw,MyEasyButton,2,Fri Jul 10 02:23:12 2015 UTC,"Yep... sometimes it can get to the point where you can't even finish your medal count before it switches to next game. Maybe at least add a minimum 10 seconds between rounds?   And the idea to browse awards would be nice.   And they need a more detailed breakdown on Battlelog for the stats reports. As example Heist this game (yes I know... below average showing, not the point) shows my best weapon was knife with 1 kill. When I know for a fact my SMG had a few more kills then that.   They go into so much to add all these leaderboards and Division comparisons and such... when most of us really just want to know how we did in the last game we played. And zero place in game to do that... while Battlelog reports are a joke. Bring back at least the BF3 Battlelog reports."
BF_Hardline,3cqvlw,rippedsteel,1 point,Fri Jul 10 12:15:12 2015 UTC,"Agreed on the better BLog game reports. I would like to see an accuracy breakdown via weapons. I don't remember if BF3 BLog had it, but BF3stats did, and I miss it.  Right now I see my overall accuracy for the game, but if I'm on the SUV minigun, I might be like 5%. If I'm throwing a ton of molotovs, I might be like 50%. I want to know my gun accuracy within a particular game. Even if they just did my top weapon only, that would be better.   For now, I'm just watching the weapon stats page to see if I'm going up for particular weapons. It helps me determine if I'm getting better with it, or not. I'm definitely not one of those players who can pull 18-25% on every primary they try (let alone one). ;-)"

If you could easily look up that stuff in the same way when you weren't in a game, it wouldn't feel like you need to stare at it so long.  I actually agree that I want to see more of that info.

To an extent, I am sympathetic towards them, because I too don't feel like I've gotten my money's worth from HL, although I acknowledge that it was completely my choice to buy the game at launch, essentially gambling with my hard earned money on a whim that this game would be great. I'd say it's a alright game, but nothing exceptional. I put in my ~100 hours and just grew more and more tired and frustrated with the game. I expected that I'd be able to get as much fun and enjoyment out of HL as I had and still have from BF4, but I was sorely disappointed in that aspect. If I could go back, I would not purchase the game at all, instead invent that $120 into other games I want this year (MGS5, BO3, and Battlefront are going to be my big and probably only 3 games this year.)  It's a shame that things have turned out this way. The community shows absolute hatred towards HL and the devs have seemingly given up and abandoned the community and game as much as they can for now. If nothing else I hope this can be a learning experience for future BF titles."
BF_Hardline,3ctckb,loki993,1 point,Sat Jul 11 16:02:34 2015 UTC,"2 reasons I think. First places like this are alwasy usually negative places....people complain a lot louder than they priase.

Some people,actually like the game and want to see it succeed, which is getting more and more obvious that its just not going to on PC."
BF_Hardline,3ctckb,Skidnuts,-2,Thu Jul 16 12:50:59 2015 UTC,"Well said!

I agree that the ""look at bfhstats.com for the tenth time this week"" posts are useless, however you can't make a reasonable criticism or new idea on this sub without people calling you a ""little bitch"". When people started to criticize the original K-10 Visceral agreed it was OP, but those who commented on the K-10 were called ""whiners"" and other names. This sub has become a sub of extremes; the sub is now haters vs. fanboys looking to stroke their ego via internet points. It is like North Korea. You are either a defector or a loyalist."

BF_Hardline,3ctckb,BillyHoWCR,-3,Sat Jul 11 01:36:46 2015 UTC,"I don't see that.   I don't see those posting OP weapon this and OP weapon that as being necessarily BFH haters. Until they decide to  back up their comments with ""I hate this game I am going back to BF4"", or ""Screw you Visceral I want a refund"", or of course as you mentioned the 'This game is dead"" posts.   People can comment on things they think can be changed and/or ideas they would like to see implemented. But when they do so in the manner of ""This could actually save Hotwire.."" when the game mode doesn't need saved. Well that leads to at least a strong hate association more then not. With not necessarily a complete hate of the game but enough hate in areas of the game that it is all they emphasize.   Even the guy that recently made a good idea of ""mobster expansion"" did so with the idea that he had to submit it along with an ""I am not getting Premium because..."" lead in.  Haters are strong.. and so many really are people that have put little time into the game. And they keep coming back and posting their hate. Even after they have claimed they are leaving BFH to go back to BF4. So why are you still posting in BFH subreddit? And why do any of them think we care that they are leaving? Those that do care they are leaving likely shouldn't be in the subreddit in the first place.  When we get a moderator that makes a post in trying to get this subreddit back in line with fans then you know issues are present."
BF_Hardline,3ctckb,cutlerf,0,Fri Jul 10 18:58:54 2015 UTC,well said. totally agree. hence the reason for my post.
BF_Hardline,3ctckb,BillyHoWCR,-2,Fri Jul 10 19:03:09 2015 UTC,I understand your feelings in the post... but I do see that posting often can just bait further contempt of the subject.   As you can see the haters coming in to balance their view of the situation already. They got to show us that they hate the game and will reflect it in downvotes and cries of simply not being the issue in this subreddit.  So best when we see them forgetting to hate... we don't remind them that they aren't hating? ha

Which the issue is with haters... those that themselves don't care to discuss anything and simply are here to hate on the game, his post was nothing like that.   The issue you bring up is outside the issue he is trying to discuss. There aren't just two sides on the forum. There are those that enjoy the game and still think some weapons need balancing and some other issues need worked on. Even I think the data collection award system is abysmal with the fact of so many nuances messing up the awards criteria. But I don't then come on and say 'this game sucks', 'Visceral should be hung from the rafter and I won't play another game of theirs again'.

I am just pointing out that a lot of people also complain about bringing up the issues such as weapon balance and the data collection award system that you bring up. BF4 was a mess and the BF4 and BF4 CTE subreddits actually were able to give a lot of feedback on what the community wanted. For example, the ""triage"" revive system came from a reddit post that DICE saw. Again, I agree there is a lot of hate, but when people simply want to put in their two cents they are also met with hate."
BF_Hardline,3ctckb,BillyHoWCR,1 point,Sat Jul 11 04:25:01 2015 UTC,"but when people simply want to put in their two cents they are also met with hate.   And this is the only point really contested by me, as I don't see the issue in OPs post as being directed towards that demographic?   Though it as a separate demographic 'I want the game to be made for me specifically' is also an equally prolific occurrence on this forum as I have hinted at in some of my posts.   And those aren't necessarily ""If you don't like my opinion fuck off. This is not a place for discussion."" types of situation but more so people really just little different then BF4/BF3 ranters of past who simply think they have a better way of making a game. And many of those posters do turn into the hater core where they eventually say... I am going back to BF4 because of TTK, OP weapons, game modes suck, this is COD, etc.   BF4 CTE subreddits actually were able to give a lot of feedback on what the community wanted.   And on note CTE subreddits are created for constructive feedback directly of CTE. While game subreddits are for those who ""play the game"" to interact and discuss game. Not rant and feed the subreddit with a barrage of... I don't like this game posts.   Suggestions for change are always welcome I think until a person suggesting them can't deal with someone that disagrees with suggested change. At that point is usually when it gets into the OP thinking they have a right to voice opinion without anyone being able to question the workability of said request.   tl;dr - OP I think is focusing on the direct game haters and not those that enjoy the game and simply post suggestions for change without actually hating on the game itself."

I think I was hoping that it was in the disabled category and was still going to blow up at some point. 20 health might be too much though, and hopping into it probably makes it so it's not going to count as an enemy vehicle kill anyway, so I was probably screwed on that front.  My whole hope going into that was that he'd stay in, I'd blow it up (and myself for that matter, giving up the flawless round). But I can't complain about getting a funny little clip out of the deal."

I sometimes do this when I am thinking of grenading an area that enemy are approaching but when they don't approach I simply put it away.

BF_Hardline,3cl66r,BillyHoWCR,1 point,Thu Jul 9 23:20:16 2015 UTC,My KD is only like 1.1... I care very little about KD. Especially in game modes where it doesn't matter as much as ensuring an area is clear. I am more the suicide bomber type of the squad where I jump in and deal major damage and the rest of the team mops up the left overs. ;)  Though my longest killstreak I think is 18 (I don't use vehicles hardly at all) and I recently had a nice 12-0 streak going in a 'Rescue' game until I switched over to Professional class and ended up with a poor 15-4 showing.   This game is all about fun for me. I think my deaths are for the most part because I try to make a moment out of kills instead of just killing people... when I can that is. :)
BF_Hardline,3cl66r,SkimSTi,1 point,Fri Jul 10 11:25:18 2015 UTC,"i am the same way, i always PTFO but i still like holding a decent KD while playing the game. i got you beat at 20 on streak (infantry - i dont use vehicles either)"

I find less teamwork is happening in TDM so better chance for me to get an enemy 1 on 1.   I also found Growhouse was the most prolific Melee map for me, where I can actually pull off 4 or more a round. Not sure if it the availability of levels where I jump down to kill someone or the fact it is a night map?   I haven't worked towards getting melee coins, just seem to let them happen naturally if they do... but need 15 more for the bounty so maybe I will work towards it next?  I do have a lot of melee raw video I want to toss into a montage, but am procrastinating so much on it. My favorite thing is to jump from above and melee enemy before they know what is happening. ;)  Edit: Added point, if you are not working on interrogation coins then arm yourself with a blade. Making sure the melee is not interrupted as easy due to the quicker takedowns."
BF_Hardline,3cn049,BillyHoWCR,1 point,Thu Jul 9 04:43:13 2015 UTC,I agree with TDM on grow house because I played two games on grow house and the first game I got 7 melee kills and the second I got 5 so it's definitely a good map to choose
BF_Hardline,3cn049,Codebreaker09,2,Fri Jul 10 12:26:31 2015 UTC,I know right? I simply noticed it by chance. It is like it is so natural to get multiple melee kills on that map for some reason.

BF_Hardline,3cn049,xPh1l25x,2,Thu Jul 9 08:48:17 2015 UTC,"Conquest large. Lot of players, lot of distractions. You'll almost always find a few snipers sitting somewhere on the edge of the map unaware of anything that's going on around them. Chances are they're also the type of players who'll go back to the exact same spot a few times. When i was getting the Ballistic Shield kills for one of the DLC helms it took me 3 or 4 games to get all 25 just by bashing clueless snipers in conquest."

I had to do a knife only rescue game and i killed everyone on two rounds due to help from my mates spotting people for me. But like others have said tdm is easy as long as you dont have enemies spawing around you whilst going for the kills. Riptide seems to be my best map for knife kills
BF_Hardline,3cn049,zebbidy,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:49:49 2015 UTC,Thanks. Riptide is the hardest map for me. People popping up everywhere. I'll keep trying.
BF_Hardline,3cn049,BillyHoWCR,1 point,Fri Jul 10 02:46:25 2015 UTC,Riptide is good in that you have a large majority of players spawning on the beaches. In these instances often you can simply get behind them as they are usually looking center of map and not behind them.  Though if the other team has Hacker or a lot of cameras then it can be difficult to get to those Snipers before they see you first.

BF_Hardline,3cl36d,FalconiiLV,2,Wed Jul 8 19:17:44 2015 UTC,"I had a hell of a time even getting defibrillator kills yesterday, had two zaps in a row that didn't deal lethal damage. So between the charge time, the range of the zap, the slow movement speed relative to your target, and the chance of not even killing your opponent it's super frustrating.  Also while we're on the subject, I already finished off my shield kills but what's the deal with the shield's damage? I've done everything between a one-shot to about 10 damage a hit. The damage is so incredibly inconsistent that unless you're teaming up, you're just outright dead in almost every situation. I've hit headshots that do a ton of damage, I've had headshots that deal next to nothing. So that's not the secret either."
BF_Hardline,3cl36d,tyler2k,1 point,Wed Jul 8 22:03:52 2015 UTC,"Bleh, I haven't started on shield kills. Any advice for the best way to go about it?"
BF_Hardline,3cl36d,tyler2k,3,Wed Jul 8 22:30:53 2015 UTC,"The best advice I can give is to have a plan. Either have it equipped ready to rock or look for future victims by playing stealthily. I say that because there's two really frustrating parts about using the shield in a ""micromanage"" sense.  1) You cannot quickly pull out the shield, there's about two good seconds before your shield can be used defensively. Combined with the incredibly low TTK In Hardline, you're basically dead if you're unprepared.  2) You cannot quickly put away your shield and cannot vault with it out. That means if you have to exfil ASAP you have a better chance fighting to the death. Why? Because if your shield is out and quickly try to vault soon after switching, your character will do a dolphin flop and have to wait to recover before you can shoot. So not only do you not get over that wall but you go prone like an idiot in the line of fire"

BF_Hardline,3cl36d,coldape,2,Wed Jul 8 22:31:38 2015 UTC,Range was the issue for me. I am not sure if it has to do with an in game stat or just a different look to the gadget/animation but I needed to be closer for it to hit.

BF_Hardline,3ckui0,Codebreaker09,2,Wed Jul 8 18:18:51 2015 UTC,Are you saying you can't find any servers at all or that you can't find populated servers?  Clear your search criteria and start from there.   Then do not choose maps in your search criteria. And try selecting 'All' for player count. If that doesn't give you anything then try and unclick 'All' and try each of the other choices individually. Eventually you should find populated servers popping up.   At that point you can then choose region to focus servers on your area.

We already have friend finder friday (or something to that effect...?) don't know if that is hitting anyone's button much?  I think the biggest issue with meet and play is the variety of players across so many platforms. Obviously me being an x360 player I am not going to be attracted to events on XOne. (though it and PS4 are the most populated)   I think weekly topic discussion (moderated) would be nice. Less of the 'I hate EA/DICE/Visceral/the World' type discussions, and more fan based discussions? As subreddits are meant for fanbased activity. It has been discussed by a few video posters that we could have a regular weekly clip submission where we could then combine redditor clips into a single video? Though each had been forgotten before any action could be taken on any implementation.    on this thought even have a weekly/monthly submission of Top 5 plays? And it too could be themed? Note: from submitters... and not grabbed from non-contributed sources (i.e. don't just submit something you found on Youtube from someone else's top 5 play list.) Users can submit videos and we can then have a moderator choose the top 5? (someone that is at least objective in their choices?) Of course feedback for each video can be submitted and used to base decision of Top 5?  I think we could have a few sticky posts. One being a monthly themed favorite screen grab post. Where players can simply submitt links to their recent screen captures. Themed based on humor. WTF, heroic poses, etc? Or not themed at all?  We could even have an organized play together day if we can coordinate redditors in groups based off of systems and such? Where we can come to an agreement each week what game types we will play that week and where to meet up?     I like the idea of getting regular users together and do things constructive instead of poisoning the subreddit with thoughts of 'why the game is lost and everyone should join the hate train on it is a very good idea'.   tl;dr - Hopefully some other specific ideas will be put forward and this idea of redditors in this subreddit getting together in a positive manner doesn't simply get pushed to the way side."

All the same I would rather they gave the maps away for free and gave people who have bought premium a free DLC game of their choice to say sorry (kind of like UBI did with people who bought the AC Unity season pass).  It would get player numbers back up and it would mean more mixed DLC/Vanilla servers.  I think season passes are bad for gamers to be honest."

This idea is I think interesting and even possible?

Coming forward with this idea, which is an awesome idea, with a more positive or even neutral attitude may help it spread around quicker. With that being said, hate and bashing can spread like wild fire. Good or bad who knows.  Nonetheless, Visceral planned the DLCs way before the game was released, but if Visceral followed BF4's trend that would be nice. Such as releasing free maps and modes (eg. gangster mode) after the DLC calendar has ended. I think it would be very, very smart of EA to continue this trend."

BF_Hardline,3cia1x,nightbass,1 point,Wed Jul 8 06:20:09 2015 UTC,Not for me or anyone I play with actually.. I play all the time on PS4 and it plays a TON better patch. No frame rate drops and the netcode is actually better than what's currently in BF4 (not CTE). I had real bad lag issues before the patch and thought it was my connection acting up but apparently the last patch fixed it for me.
BF_Hardline,3cia1x,ipawilzon,1 point,Wed Jul 8 23:32:06 2015 UTC,"yea, def not as smooth after patch. when i see PC gameplay videos its smoooooooth as heck. oh well... while its not quite as pleasing on the PS4, we have the numbers to enjoy the game. so its give and take."

I never really had fps drops pre or post patch in HL unless it's when the big levolutions occur. The netcode is great and it plays smoother than BF4 does for me. When I go back and play BF4 now, I can notice the difference in the netcode immediately and found myself pretty frustrated as I actually think its last patch actually broke gameplay with all the dumb changes the majority of the community didn't ask for."

BF_Hardline,3ci5k7,EthnicDracula,4,Wed Jul 8 03:43:54 2015 UTC,After the patch the syndicate didn't seem that hard if you try. The Rep 4 is the worst part but if you use any type of rep boost it goes by quick.

I had 0 coins before the update even when I tried to get them (didn't try THAT hard knowing the update was coming). After the update I got the 15 coins from just having the shield on my back on The Block. The tier 4 is much easier to get with the new Tactical Toolkit perk on blood money.

BF_Hardline,3cht7m,SIR_VELOCIRAPTOR,0,Wed Jul 8 05:21:57 2015 UTC,I probably suck.   Not necessarily... you might just not be focusing enough on the survival aspect of Tier leveling? The hardest part is being able to earn said money without your death ending it's progression.   So think of game play where you find you earn a lot of money and tend to die less (many people have different favored gameplay to achieve this) and then use the proper class boost that allows the earning of money in that category to compound itself.   Play to your skill base when possible. If you find you just don't have the skill to stay alive and earn the needed money then you will need to focus on the ability to increase your skill to achieve it.   Good luck.  Note: and getting into a match where even a random Hacker is present on your side and you being on a full squad can earn you a few Tier level assists just for being at the right place at the right time. I know when I play Hacker I usually can Hack now 3~4 squads full Tier 4.
BF_Hardline,3cht7m,BillyHoWCR,11,Wed Jul 8 06:01:19 2015 UTC,Just play the game and do well in it. It's not that hard anymore.

BF_Hardline,3cht7m,MSP930,2,Wed Jul 8 01:39:15 2015 UTC,"I have all 4 syndicates, and got most of them in Blood Money. I used boosts for all classes except enforcer, the tactical gloves made it pretty damn easy. Here's my advice:   Play Blood Money Try to get squad leader and set objectives, A good squad can make all the difference. A full squad works better too. Use Rep boosts Try to get a hacker to help Don't die! On tier 4 I would often get 50% and then hang back at the vault. Getting the deposit assists is huge. The caveat to that is if you have a team who insists on hitting your vault really hard it can be a death trap.   If you're on PS4 I can help you by playing in your squad or playing as hacker.  Edit: fixed formatting now that I'm off my phone, can also see your flair. Maybe find an xbone player to help as hacker?"
BF_Hardline,3cht7m,gardenlevel,2,Wed Jul 8 03:54:12 2015 UTC,On tier 4 I would often get 50% and then hang back at the vault.   Biggest thing right there... Tier 4 is when you go at playing more defensive. Tier 1~3 can be gotten easy enough even if you die and have to start over a few times after each Tier. But Tier 4 is when you need to focus on staying alive to earn it.

I used a 50% Rep Boost and rotated between the A and D flags trying my best to stay alive as long as possible. Rep 1 - 3 was easy to get. Usually i'd have them within the first 5 or so minutes, then Rep 4 took a while longer. The reason i found Downtown to work so well was because the distance between A and D is pretty short, and both flags are fairly easy to solo cap. Getting Rep 4 10 times probably took me 15 or so games. It's not 100% consistent, but it's the most consistent method i have found.  Also, picking up a kill here and there along the way helps out, putting down ammo, med packs, Reviving teammates, etc. along the way will speed things up. But i never went out of my way to do these things. As much as BF is a team game, i find that the Syndicates kind of make you play very selfish if you're not one of the super-good players."

BF_Hardline,3cgp0u,SkimSTi,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:39:43 2015 UTC,Wait... Hardline has been the most glitch free release in a long time. How can you claim it is broken compared to BF4 release and other games?   Yes I too hate day 1 patch situations and such in todays age of gaming... but Hardline has basically fell to the positive side of that issue.  Yes the recent patch and DLC has brought new netcode variance and yes some things need to be worked to make it more user friendly to users... as the search settings seem to take a long time to connect. But the drivel on Hardline costing 400€ (is that like $440) is kind of out there isn't it?
BF_Hardline,3cgp0u,BillyHoWCR,1 point,Wed Jul 8 06:14:41 2015 UTC,"I was hinting at a console for 400€, not the game. Only games I've purchased glitch free were forza horizon 2 and destiny... The rest I had issues with and I still have issues with bf hardline even though I don't have the dlc. Can't find a server in server browser... Lag was present from day one and it's still there. Have no clue why since they've found the workaround for net code issues."
BF_Hardline,3cgp0u,TheComebackDude,1 point,Wed Jul 8 06:47:10 2015 UTC,"I was hinting at a console for 400€, not the game.   Well that is a bit disingenuous to put your purchase of your console onto the back of Hardline as a game isn't it?    and I still have issues with bf hardline even though I don't have the dlc. Can't find a server in server browser...    I am assuming you are XOne with the games you mentioned? And the idea that you can't find a game in server browser is hopefully not hinting that no populated servers are present? As we know it is populated.  It has already been mentioned that previous to patch little issue with server browser was found and yes patch has reported to cause an issue with searching and having certain restrictive search criteria present. This is something that is surely being looked into but hardly game breaking as work around has been identified how to do searches to allow the servers populated to show. Annoying yes... but not game breaking in the point that the game is still glitch free for the most part.    Lag was present from day one and it's still there.   Lag really is not something you can place fully on the server side. I say this because my and many others experience less of this then is claimed to be present in game. Yes larger population servers can result in greater lag issues that I myself might not experience being on x360 and smaller game lobbies? But with millions of players around the world a lot of it really is on client side.   I see obvious lag situations across many titles due to my proximity to servers I play on and personal internet connectivity that is near dial up quality. But even then I find Hardline to be less lagfested then other titles I have played. People since first playing multiplayer games online have complained about lag. It will be an issue we will never not stop complaining about. But Hardline is simply not the lag rampant game that many make it out to be. (at least on my system... to be fair)  Hope you find your other games are enough to keep you gaming...? But spending your time in a fan subreddit doesn't do anything to resolve any issues you might be having when discussion is not fairly brought forth and instead regresses into simply trying to detour any discussion into a rant of how bad you hate the game.   tl;dr - try maybe discussing instead on lambasting for the sake of drawing attention to the negative feelings you have towards the game and others?"
BF_Hardline,3cgp0u,BillyHoWCR,1 point,Wed Jul 8 07:19:11 2015 UTC,"Reasonable post written in a good manner. I got both consoles when they came out on day one, so actually I didn't buy them for hardline. Every game since release has been broken on consoles, reason for my frustration. Lag is not completely on server side, but here's a quick description of my internet at home 300/100 mbit pure fiber from wall outlet to provider. I have 7-18 ms ping at any given moment, not a notch over 18. My xbox reports speeds up to 95 mbit and ps4 up to 40. Ps4 hardwired xbox on 5ghz wireless. So the lag is not on my end. I only choose servers near me. Rubberbanding is solely on side of devs."
BF_Hardline,3cgp0u,TheComebackDude,1 point,Wed Jul 8 08:04:59 2015 UTC,"Rubberbanding is solely on side of devs.   Simply to highlight this point off the start. This is never the case from my experience. Though servers can influence greatly the scenario of Rubberbanding, issue being on the side of servers (Devs as you put it) is not accurate to state it is ever solely server side.   As I and others have mentioned... speed is always a good thing to have but not the focus of issues when it comes to data transfer. Did you mention latency? I saw ping mentioned and in the majority of cases, the ping rate is equivalent to the effective latency between your home PC and the Internet. This is not always the case, congestion and network throttling sometimes means that your system might have very low latency when connecting to something as simple as a search engine but high latency when connecting to mutiplayer games. I will assume your latency is not an issue too?   You mention Rubberbanding and this is an issue where it occurs  when latency is relatively high and synchronization is off between clients and server. If this is happening to everyone in game then the likely scenario is connection issue near server side. If it is happening with only a few players or one then it is likely an issue closer to client side. Does not even need to be as close as router or system itself... it can be lag created between ISP and server location.   It is near impossible to surmise where your issue of lag is being sourced... but if it is large enough to cause rubberbanding (which really is huge lag) then it is a good amount of lag. As small lag usually only consists of frame rate appearance and or shot identification errors. (being shot while having reached cover already) I myself with near dial up service and playing across the world rarely see such rubberbanding in games. So from simply a trouble shooting aspect... if my connection and others isn't as effected as yours then problem is more likely client side focused more then not?  But again... you mention xbox but don't specify XOne or x360? So being able to correlate my experience closer to yours might not be as relatable if we play on different systems? There might in fact be some issue with servers on XOne or PS4 that are effecting masses that I am not aware of?   tl;dr - sorry this appeared longer then what I originally intended... most of my discussions do.ha So much going on between connections... having sweet internet connection doesn't mean it still is not a client side issue.. too much going on in the background that can cause issue for a client where others will see no such issue."

BF_Hardline,3cgih9,BillyHoWCR,0,Wed Jul 8 06:19:26 2015 UTC,"Only thing id like to see would be maybe a SLIGHT NERF to the professional side arms, like the tech9 and mac10.   I would have to disagree with you on this idea. I use Mac-10 a lot simply because it is the only way to survive when using a sniper rifle and being confronted at close range. (I rarely touch Tech 9 yet... but few times I have it is similar to Mac-10 but maybe slightly weaker at close range?)   Mac-10 has abysmal control where it is near impossible to be effective with it outside of the 10 meter range. and you run through a clip like nothing with a very poor reload rate. Yes... it is very deadly at close range... but can be bested by any single shot kill weapon at that range. And if by chance you do miss an enemy during a confrontation then be prepared to die. ha  Yes very powerful at close range. Yes very very very poor at any other range. Big pro to use it close range... very big negative to try and use it otherwise.   ive been happy since the last patch. honestly, just have to use the strengths to the weapons. if you use them in the wrong situations, you will be punished for it. and most people that complain about weapon balance, IMO, don't know how to play the weapons to their advantages.   I would have to agree with you on this. Most people call for nerfs of weapons simply don't know how to combat against situations they face.

BF_Hardline,3cgih9,SkimSTi,3,Wed Jul 8 06:28:34 2015 UTC,seems like i get shanked by mac10s even at mid ranges..... maybe its just me. haha
BF_Hardline,3cgih9,BillyHoWCR,0,Wed Jul 8 15:07:03 2015 UTC,Have you ran with Mac-10? Try it and see how much it kicks... mid range shots with it are near impossible. If you are getting killed mid range with them then I would have to account it to just very bad luck for you and extremely good luck with user. ha

BF_Hardline,3cgih9,BillyHoWCR,0,Wed Jul 8 15:30:28 2015 UTC,"I simply like running with the laser tripmines on many game modes. And of course I had to work on each of the Class Syndicate Assignments so I had to get it done.   Mac-10 is a very good close quarter gun... and I have over 1,200 kills with it alone. But experience with it shows me that mid range is just not a viable option at all. You have to use it to really understand how daunting it is to control. And how easy it is to spit out all your bullets before even getting a bullet on your enemy at mid range."
BF_Hardline,3cgih9,Cramer02,2,Wed Jul 8 15:38:56 2015 UTC,"Thanks for clarifying and bringing some understanding to this topic, man. i should have tried it before i knock it..."
BF_Hardline,3cgih9,SkimSTi,2,Wed Jul 8 15:43:08 2015 UTC,No issue... I always try and check out guns that I tend to see on the other end of my kill screens. ha   People tend to think something is OP when they get killed with a weapon a lot. But usually after playing with said weapon and not being able to go all OP on everyone else people realize it really isn't as OP as originally thought.
BF_Hardline,3cgih9,Cramer02,1 point,Wed Jul 8 15:46:43 2015 UTC,Every things pretty balanced now even on PC like /u/SkimSTi said tech9 & mac10 can be a bit op but its only really annoying when you die a few times repeatedly by them.   K10 isnt as OP anymore but still a really good close quarters gun not as many people using it now to be honest at least not on PC. Also if you play hardcore the health got dropped to 60%.  Currently my favourite weapon is the M1A1 and even though i got no sights or attachments it still puts up a fight with the rest of the guns.  Give it a go the new patch and dlc combined really got me back into Hardline hopefully it will do the same for you.
BF_Hardline,3cgih9,SkimSTi,2,Tue Jul 7 20:57:01 2015 UTC,"agreed, wasnt crazy about the new m1a1 at first, but after getting used to it, it is quite fun to use in all situations. just hate tracking moving targets at mid+ range with those damn irons...."

BF_Hardline,3cetya,SkimSTi,-2,Tue Jul 7 22:49:34 2015 UTC,"I had the same problem with BF4. After 6 months of the game being out, I started getting this. Eventually after everyone complaining, they sorted it.   I'll be selling this game and going back to BF4 if it carries on. DICE servers really are shit.   My internet is 90mbs down 20mbs up.Wired to PS4 too and I have no other problems in other games at the moment."
BF_Hardline,3cetya,BillyHoWCR,2,Tue Jul 7 12:20:57 2015 UTC,"My internet is only 1.9mb/s down and .47mb/s up, and I do not have the same issue as you.   Anyone thinking speed has anything to do with this issue might not understand much about the situation at all?  Yes the netcode for Hardline is poor. And yes the servers are lacking and certain servers in some regions are worse then others. Especially when it comes to certain rented servers I have played on, where I can specifically identify when a server will go down. In those cases though it kicks all players.   You can have your PC running perfectly well and even have multiple devices working just fine off of your router. Even likely have some multiplayer games that show zero issue as you are experiencing with Hardline. But that still does not make it as much a host issue as it is likely your connection issue. Especially when it comes down to the fact the experience is not rampant across all player base.   Yes since patch the server browser and connection time is abysmal due to some of the changes they made. Though these changes have reduced issues with other aspects of the netcode when actually in game.   But getting back to your issue... as many people who have blazing internet speeds have found out... speed means little in such matters and should be forgotten immediately as any factor.   Latency and consistency actually has the biggest factor when it comes to the issues we see with most multiplayer games. And more so with games that are more demanding with their netcode and data flow.   So many factors from the player side router/ISP that are much more likely candidates for why you are seeing issues with your particular disconnections. Especially when I myself playing from the other side of the world in most cases when in game... am not being kicked mid game. And you might notice the amount of players that complain of such things are very much in the minority.   So question is... why are you and a few others seeing such particular issues when everyone else is not?   And that is the dilemma. As even I usually have to go to my friends houses when trouble shooting their issues. So trying to resolve your issue from the internet would be near remarkable a feat. Especially without proper motivation on both ends to come to a true resolution.   but again, my answer of resetting your router until you find an address that is cooperative is the most effective solution to the vast majority of people with similar issue. It might not solve your issue or even everyone's but it will resolve most.   Question for you... have you even attempted to do so or did you just dismiss the idea? If you have how many times have you reset and have you documented the addresses' pushed down to your router each time?   tl;dr - your speed means nothing. Don't claim it is all server side and nothing can be done at your end, especially when the issue is not being seen by everyone in mass. Good luck."
BF_Hardline,3cetya,BillyHoWCR,0,Tue Jul 7 14:28:18 2015 UTC,"I shouldn't have to. I have no problem with any other games. It's definitely DICE. I have had the same problem with all their games. About 6 months into the game and I always start getting these issues. I will give it a go tonight though to see if it makes a difference but in previous times, it hasn't. Fingers crossed.   Thanks for your help."
BF_Hardline,3cetya,BillyHoWCR,2,Tue Jul 7 14:31:17 2015 UTC,I shouldn't have to.   If you want a true resolution then yes you simply will. If you don't want a resolution then no... you shouldn't have to because you don't care to actually get a resolution.   Hopefully it will resolve it and you fall into the majority of issues that can be resolved in such a fashion. Just be sure to give it a chance on a few different addresses... I usually go through as many as 10~15 if I am troubleshooting an issue.   And if it does resolve your issue then we can have the conversation on why it is possibly happening and what steps you can do to hopefully lessen the frequency in the future. Good luck.  Note: be sure to give the router enough time to locate a new address for you instead of possibly cycling the same one into your tests. (meaning give it a minute of off time) And obviously make sure other devices aren't interfering with your test.

BF_Hardline,3cduyk,SkimSTi,2,Tue Jul 7 18:53:36 2015 UTC,Both as already got licences on everything I like to play with.

BF_Hardline,3cduyk,TheRealSnoFlake,0,Tue Jul 7 06:01:45 2015 UTC,"Currently Criminal due to the need to kill 50 Cops with grenade for an Assignment.   But unless it is Assignment related choice on my part then it doesn't matter too much in TDM. But obviously Rescue has a different Game play completely with Cops and Criminals having totally different game play. So in that mode I prefer to be Cop for the most part, as defending can be hit or miss depending on your teammates... but Cop I can always have a chance by simply killing all the Criminals myself.   Spawn locations do sometimes favor Cops or Criminals depending on some game modes but not to the point to make me prefer one over the other.   And weapons don't factor into my decision either as I tend to use what is given to me until it is broke. ha"
BF_Hardline,3cduyk,BillyHoWCR,3,Tue Jul 7 03:58:59 2015 UTC,people really do hate you on this sub.. always downvoted...... haha. which is ridiculous for something that is totally opinion based like the question in this thread. its not like you are giving false information.
BF_Hardline,3cduyk,SkimSTi,0,Tue Jul 7 23:03:15 2015 UTC,I really do have some trolls that login and see a comment of mine and then go through my recent posts to downvote each post that they can.   Usually users who have been in discussion with me and were upset that they couldn't change my opinion to meet theirs.  I can often literally be logged in and watch every single post get downvoted in succession. It is just funny that they feel they are accomplishing something.   The downvoters seem to be more active in downvoting then do upvoters in their support of information that might be more factual? I try to at least assist those that I think are getting downvoted for voicing logical positive opinions and give them an upvote for encouragement.   But I myself care little about the karma as it isn't like it is a bitcoin or anything. Can't even buy me some McD fries with it. ;)

BF_Hardline,3cfde4,DANNYonPC,5,Tue Jul 7 14:05:24 2015 UTC,"Being a long time BF player I agree with you.  I bought hardline when it was on sale a few weeks ago and so far I enjoy it. Of course it isn't at the level of BF4 but that is why I play it.  To experience new gameplay and just have fun.  I am not a hardcore player so the feel of BFHL is right up my alley. The campaign is on point and tells a good story IMHO. The multiplayer has its moments, I still do not plan on buying premium until it is cheaper... I think people have set the standard too high and expect hardline to be some sort of elite cops and robbers simulation.  I think the game is good for just going out and having a good time doing what you want to do. I was in a match recently and the players were all arguing about how hotwire game mode was ""supposed"" to be played. One person said that everyone in the match was playing it like a round of conquest just camping the vehicles to blow up. Another player said players should be able to play the game however they feel with fun being the primary reason for playing a game. I agree with fun being my reason, sometimes I like to snipe. And other times I like to ambush as an enforcer with breaching charges..  TL;DR Just play and have a good time."

I don't have an issue finding a game mode I enjoy on pretty much any new quality game for about a year. It took less than 2 months before I couldn't find heist servers. I really don't like any other game mode on this particular game so BFH pretty much died right after for me because of that. Sure I can play on the German server you show in your picture except I'll have over 200 ping unlike your 30. Now I check every once in awhile to see if I get lucky.
BF_Hardline,3cfde4,Enjoy_it,0,Tue Jul 7 17:54:34 2015 UTC,"You're wrong on servers.   I don't believe he is talking on the subject of specific game types. Numerous posts have been made of people making claim that there are absolutely zero servers, and some other posts saying they can find only one or 2. Saying it is near impossible to find any game.  PC obviously has the roughest time... but on console (even my lowly x360) we have plenty of variety to choose from. The idea there are no servers is just not accurate."

BF_Hardline,3cfde4,klonkish,6,Tue Jul 7 14:35:13 2015 UTC,"You have to take into account BF4 is at the end of its life cycle so it will have more content since all the DLCs have been released and it has been patched more.   Its more expensive because its a newer game, most people only buy premium for the bundled DLC and the other features are just a bonus ( although they have yet to be developed which is shit imo).   Finally yeah the support is shit i cant argue with that."

BF_Hardline,3cfde4,Open_Man_Hole,-2,Thu Jul 9 04:49:59 2015 UTC,"In October 2014, nearly a full year after the official release with major updates still being put out, DICE LA producer David Sirland said the company acknowledged that the release of Battlefield 4 ""absolutely"" damaged the trust of the franchise's fanbase.[97] Sirland said that the shaky release of Battlefield 4 caused the company to reevaluate their release model, and plan on being more transparent and offer earlier beta tests with future installments, namely (at the time) with 2015's Battlefield Hardline. Sirland also said: ""We still probably have a lot of players who won't trust us to deliver a stable launch or a stable game. I don't want to say anything because I want to do. I want them to look at what we're doing and what we are going to do and that would be my answer. I think we have to do things to get them to trust us, not say things to get them to trust us. Show by doing.""   Thus Hardline was released and was acclaimed for being the most bug free release game in a long time. Apparently... maybe the idea of focusing on less bugs instead focusing on just shoving DLC to the market too soon might have been a good thing?"
BF_Hardline,3cfde4,BillyHoWCR,-1,Tue Jul 7 17:12:38 2015 UTC,And look at the players currently playing Hardline.  Apparently... maybe the idea of focusing on less bugs instead focusing on just shoving DLC to the market too soon might have been a bad thing?
BF_Hardline,3cfde4,klonkish,-2,Tue Jul 7 17:35:30 2015 UTC,As we have said many times before... and will be forced to say many times again in the future. Sales do not dictate that a game is good or bad... as many great games sold poorly and many bad games sold very well. In fact BF4 was one of the most bug ridden pieces of garbage when it came out and it didn't effect sales in the least. (obviously now it is far better then it's release)  When a company has to shut down all it's other current projects being worked just to fix a game they released with massive issues... and it still sells well? People have a very poor sense of what really matters in games.   People hated on Hardline before it even reached the market. Hate for it was beyond what we ever seen with other titles.
BF_Hardline,3cfde4,BillyHoWCR,0,Tue Jul 7 17:54:19 2015 UTC,"But who's talking about sales, apart from you?  I'm talking about active players.  Battlefield 4 had a lot more than Hardline."
BF_Hardline,3cfde4,klonkish,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:24:22 2015 UTC,Well pretty much you gotta buy the game before you can be an active player.   And we just discussed that BF4 had more sales (players) the Hardline even with it being total crap when released.
BF_Hardline,3cfde4,BillyHoWCR,-7,Tue Jul 7 18:28:45 2015 UTC,Yes and no  Where BFH is way more focused towards one thing (infantry) BF4 tries to do WAAAY too much and adds tons of retarded fucking bullshit.

BF_Hardline,3cfde4,NvaderGir,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:34:37 2015 UTC,"Most console players aren't aware of the Subreddit, and the only ones that do are PC players... so you see the connection as to why there are so many posts against the game.  In the long run, Hardline will be a really fun game, but it's okay to make criticisms against the game as long as they're fair. Right now finding a US server with Criminal Activity (that doesn't have a fuckton of tickets...) is really difficult. I love Rescue, but I don't know why people find 10v10+ servers so enjoyable, but those are the only ones being seeded! It isn't to do with theme, or anything like that, just the fact BF4 is still being updated. No one has a reason to jump to the other game yet, hopefully matchmaking will be enough reason for people to hop on."

You can play conquest or deathmatch anywhere (other games). Boring.   I think the ""blah blah PC is milsim"" argument is silly because BF4 is not a milsim by a stretch.  It's military arcade and such realizations pushes me more toward Hardline.  I was turned off early in Hardline beta when you had things such as Chinese optics, and RPGs as default weapons in a cops and robbers game.  But they fixed those things and won me over.  The TTK took serious adjustment for me but I did just that; I adjusted.   I don't even play BF4 anymore.  And now you can even carry a DMR secondary in your pocket in bf4 because lawlz."

BF_Hardline,3cf3xc,Dylan_Upshall,2,Tue Jul 7 21:14:26 2015 UTC,"Yep 'game-plays' or as I call them 'watch me play' videos don't do well on reddit. I think mainly due to reddit discouraging self promotion and many of the videos being designed for little more then that.  Reddit in my experience focuses more on accomplishment videos, as we saw with his previous video getting more positive attention due to the high kill count. And humor, WTF, and such. And of course the choreographed audio/video mash-ups that oddly gets redditers hard?   A finicky bunch for sure... I would say for anyone to continue what they are doing but listen to some (not all) opinions on videos. Change anything they fill they can compromise on and might actually be more to what others are seeking? But never listen to the masses of reddit... we are rarely in agreement and you tend to not gain followers simply by changing things to their liking, you more often can loose followers who already enjoy your content.   His video might have simply gotten better feedback on reddit with a more appropriate lead in via the title? But you never know?"

It's worth noting that my personal favorite shooter of all time is still Black Ops II, so YMMV based on your preferences. The addition of Bounty Hunter is pretty cool too, but I wish they'd allow that game mode on all maps. I'm quite pleased with my purchase.  Conquest on Black Friday is a lot of fun if you enjoy lots of kills/deaths. Bounty Hunter on Backwoods is fantastic, collecting tags requires a lot of tactical risk/reward decision making."

I feel like everyone who bitchs about this game doesn't get the point of it. Visceral did so many things right with this game. Things that pissed me off in other games. The unlock progression for one.  The fact that the new guns in the DLC aren't kept behind an assignment wall, where non completionist and casual players can get them.  Everybody likes to compare it to BF4 because it has the name Battlefield in it. I think thats unfair. It needs to be taken for what it is. A silly fun time running around shooting dudes. The game doesn't take itself seriously. I don't know why everyone else wants to. I tried to go back to BF4 when the AN94 came out ""my all time favorite gun in BF3"" but just couldn't get back into it. It feels bloated and old.   Its Hardline all summer then onto Battlefront...Which should piss off the BF community because early reports say its even less deep and more arcady..."

BF_Hardline,3catxd,thurst0n,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:02:00 2015 UTC,"The comments should inform Visceral about why players left, why they didn't enjoy the game.  The drop off has been EXTREME with this game, particularly on PC.  Visceral/EA can either listen to the player base or keep churning bad games out.  I don't know if I should even call Hardline bad.  If 8-10 key decisions went another way (TTK, Armored Insert, Weapon Balance, RPGs in Hotwire, Player counts on maps etc.) then it would have been a playable (even ""good"") game.    The people who made those decisions ensured the game would die quickly.  I mean seriously they KNEW RPGs in Hotwire was a crap decision, they were told that but did nothing, perhaps because noobs could get kills with RPGs who the hell knows."
BF_Hardline,3catxd,fugazied,0,Mon Jul 6 22:59:48 2015 UTC,"well the thing i wrote got downvoted with not one comment telling me why ( <3 reddit ) ... whatever!    point was not to demotivate, but to inform.    i still play it every day on PC and have fun with the remaining 2000-3000 players that are playing it. But i REALLY wouldn't mind if EA / Visceral would do something ...anything, to get player numbers back up. By now it isn't even a PC exclusive problem anymore, by the time the next DLC/Patch arrives the Consoles will look pretty empty too if the downwards trend keeps going like that (and i see no reason why it would stop now...).    Instead every single move they make seems to either backfire or its just complete backwards logic... i could go on a rant now how much they messed up every opportunity for some good PR, but i spare you the rant."
BF_Hardline,3catxd,thurst0n,1 point,Mon Jul 6 19:46:03 2015 UTC,"I don't know what they can really do.  The reason many of my friends didn't pick it up in the first place is because they didn't want to pay 60 bucks for what they feel is or should have been a BF4 DLC.  The reason many of my friends, who did get it, stopped playing is because it lost its initial new game appeal(hotwire gets boring. Maps really arent very good. Spawns are trash) and also because their other friends never got it and were likely playing bf4.   These aren't new ideas or anything just reiterating.   What I now want to ask you, is what specifically should the developers and/or publisher do at this point to convince people who didn't buy it in the first place to buy it? And what should they do to bring people back?  Your ideas don't have to be new but if you can broaden awareness or explain things better than others you will have accomplished something instead of just spewing more QQ."
BF_Hardline,3catxd,fugazied,5,Mon Jul 6 20:18:40 2015 UTC,"...well OK.   drop 2 Weeks Early Access from ""Premium"" DLC's, we need people on those empty servers, no one cares for 2 Weeks Early Access. AFAIK that was only a tactic from DICE to gate access a bit so not everyone would download it at the same time... BFH clearly does not need to make sure that the masses get good DL speeds, this is pure PR shenanigans now and helps no one anymore.   mainly i want them to STOP messing up, the Launch was OK but releasing so close to GTA5 did hurt the PC sales and PR a lot. Releasing the first DLC in the middle of the E3 Hype completely took any attention from Hardline away, even the usual Battlefield Youtubers skipped Hardline coverage in favor of Star Wars Battlefront Trailer analyses stuff... giving Access to CTE just 2 days before the DLC launched effectively sabotaged ANY possible Feedback or influence the community could have given, this was just so the Youtubers could record some footage early. Then they even fail at pushing the DLC live without problems (why did it work on CTE but not the Live Servers?!). And the latest facepalm is that they now want to DELAY the PC release of the DLC because we need to keep our 2 Weeks Early Access for Premium intact... so the PC DLC will be released to non-premiums after the Consoles? How is THAT helping anyone? Oh yeah and lets not forget the Gun Bench, they could have at least gained some traction with the remaining playerbase if they had this one worked out by now but instead they push it back to the very last DLC, that only gives me the impression that they don't even know what to do with it. So yes... i think to simply stop fucking up every single thing that could produce some positive PR would be a good Start.   Communication, i have not heard a single word from any of the Devs since the launch Hype. DICE has a subreddit for their CTE... that is the kind of communication and player involvement i want to see... i don't think it makes sense here, but at least give us some signs of LIFE. The DLC is out, i got NO idea what is next for Hardline? Are they working on any patches? Do they need feedback from CTE for something? What is the next DLC going to include? Can we maybe give some input on what NOT to do (like ...NOT to do another cookie cutter TDM mode with Coins? stolen from CoD...).   REACT to Feedback. for example People were extremely unhappy with the Pre-Order Weapons, this surely did cost them Sales at Launch. How about releasing those 3 Guns to everyone else. This would also be a first step to respond to the people that say this game has too few Weapons. A few more (free) Weapon DLCs would not hurt either to interest people again (or just increase the Weapon Output in the upcomming DLCs). We wanted RPG's and C4 gone from Hotwire, they reduced the 2 RPGs in the trunk to one... i don't feel like that helped at all, do you?   Weapon Balance I don't claim that i know much about weapon balance in Battlefield games, i hate the numbers stuff. I certainly don't agree with any of the NERF Crybabies. But i feel that Weapons are balanced around the in-game purchase price, which is complete and utter nonsense for a Battlefield game and reduces the amount of effective Weapons to about half of what the game has in variety, which is already less than half of what BF4 had. I don't say nerf the ""god guns"" i say BUFF all the crappy guns to acceptable levels, there is no excuse for the starter guns to be that pointless.   On the Publisher End... well i suggested to make a bundle with Battlefield 3, 4 and Hardline + all Premiums at a reasonable price the other week. Instead they now made a bundle of BF4 and Hardline STANDARD Editions for so much money that they made fun of it today on the BF4 reddit because it isn't cheaper than the solo games. Personally i'd also say, put it on STEAM. OH NOES you can't even think that! I know that won't happen but 3 of 4 PC Games today are sold on Steam and people still have high resistance against Origin, just google for Origin vs. Steam Polls or pay attention on News Sites comment sections and you'll see it. And if not Steam than GMG or G2A or whatever other platforms are out there -> presenting your game on more digital storefronts = more people buying, that is a PR thing too and it is the Publishers Job to get people to buy the game. And the last thing is of course a major price drop, the game is still to expensive for most to even consider it and the low player numbers are no secret either, this game already belongs in the bargain bin. Lower price = more sales, simple economics. The people who are OK with spending $120 on this game have already done it.     ...well you asked for my laundry list. This is it. If i got a bit too negative in parts, that is just because i'm frustrated with how badly EA handled all of the PR. I still have fun with the game, despite all odds, but it pains me to see them mess up every single thing that is possible to mess up, the EA PR Team has shown gross incompetence with handling this game. I'm not even blaming Visceral, they don't decide the pricing or what goes into the Pre Order DLC... or when to release the game or the DLC.    If i blame Visceral for anything it is the Cops & Robbers theme, i think if DICE had given them BF2143 (to counter Titanfall and CoD Advanced Warfare) or a Bad Company 3, maybe even a WW2 Battlefield (which i personally wouldn't care for, but the BF4 community seems to be very interested in another WW2 game) we could be looking at a complete different situation right now, but it is what it is now and the above is all i can think of to salvage the sinking boat."

They were told about that in the closed betas.  The Youtubers told them the RPGs destroyed the mode.  If they had listened, the mode could have played as advertised -- car chases and people shooting at each other from cars.  That part of Hotwire is incredibly fun.    Instead it plays out with people doing loops on a remote part of the map because they are afraid of the camping trolls with RPGs and C4.   Being a PTFO player who gets instantly killed by a troll with an RPG is not fun, it is rage inducing.    Did visceral want to design the game for low-skill trolls who spend the round camping one part of the road waiting for an easy kill?  The producer or whoever made decisions like that ensured the game would fail.  It's all on them.  DICE did the same thing with UCAVs in Battlefield 4.  Designing gadgets and game mechanics to suit low skill players and trolls instead of making the game BALANCED."

BF_Hardline,3ca1o3,PraeteritaCautus,-2,Mon Jul 6 15:26:30 2015 UTC,I see it as just as much boosting as if they went to a No-Kill server  Explain yourselves on Why you think it isn't.   I'm all ears to hear Opinions on this
BF_Hardline,3ca1o3,nova311,2,Mon Jul 6 07:28:32 2015 UTC,"Having a friend play hacker and then upgrade their friends squad is only boosting insofar as using a party is boosting; the advantage gained is retained by the group with access - the friends benefit from the upgrades just as they benefit from the coordination that comes with spoken communication.  To refer to the scenario as boosting, overlooks a critical point; friends will prefer friends, it is why they are considered friends. They would be boosting only their friends squad, primarily to benefit their friends as much as possible, but also because you likely won't use the upgrade often enough to move on to another squad once your friends have Tier 4.  If we consider ""Boosting"" to be absolutely anything that affords an advantage, then savior coins are boosting because you've helped a teammates k/d, assist coins are boosting because you have helped a teammates k/d, chatting is boosting because you might tell a teammate where they are thus helping their performance, recommending a gun is boosting if they then do better with that gun, playing with them at all is boosting given if your friends are competent players playing together wil, increase your chances of winning.  The only people who consider it boosting, are salty because they don't have friends to play with a d cannot then fathom the concept."
BF_Hardline,3ca1o3,PraeteritaCautus,-1,Mon Jul 6 12:53:48 2015 UTC,"I've been getting all my Tier 4s alone and seeing that other people get it from a friendly hacker is pretty saddening. Although I had friendly hacker moments by pure luck, I still think it's boosting if done intentionally."
BF_Hardline,3ca1o3,ZeroBANG,3,Mon Jul 6 09:42:09 2015 UTC,"I know right, how dare other people have friends... My, it's almost like you've just said hackers shouldn't be able to help their friends, even when they'd be hacking anyway - what, are they not allowed to play with friends anymore?"
BF_Hardline,3ca1o3,PraeteritaCautus,0,Mon Jul 6 13:01:17 2015 UTC,"It's not that, I just want others to see assignments as it is, a challenge. And not be considered as a chore that can be done easily with a helping hand."

BF_Hardline,3c8u4v,BillyHoWCR,2,Mon Jul 6 04:32:36 2015 UTC,"@ the 23:20 point likely the Sniper saw friendly color behind the enemy as he was approaching and misidentified him. Happens to me a lot when an enemy gets between me and a friendly and it appears he has a blue or green tag over his head. Annoying as hell.   Video was interesting... commentary was entertaining enough to keep my attention and gameplay was active and good enough to make me feel as if I wasn't just watching an average gameplay that has no reason to be highlighted for others to want to watch. (other video posters should know if they fall into that category... but most don't)  I feel I have seen some of his videos before maybe? Voice sounded familiar. Not sure many will give any credit due to use of K10 and AI but doesn't phase me as much, as I am so over the idea that guns and/or gadgets are OP.   Good video.  Edit: and I give you much cred at about the 27 minute mark where you say something to the effect... ""I am just going in..."" and then proceed to run by all the guys being timid on the stairs and clear the room. And the guy t-bagging his own guy (that you killed just previously) at the 28:30 point.

I get desktop issues after use too.  I guess I'll just wait for the real thing and trust it works.   So in hardline when you launch do you see the battlelog webpage on the shield?"
BF_Hardline,3c7g0q,BillyHoWCR,2,Sun Jul 5 16:25:51 2015 UTC,"It used to be 30,000 points but since patch they have reduced the amount to 10,000 points each. (though narrative was not properly changed)  As for why you earned the points in game and then it appeared to be taken away... well this could be for a few reasons? But my assumptions are that it is an issue with data in game and data on Battlelog. Sometimes Battlelog will not update until awhile after game activity and then it will update later as you are playing. Though other times in game data shows that something has been completed when it actually hasn't (Enforcer Syndicate Assignment as example has issue with this for many) where in game will give a false completion but battlelog will still show a need for completing.   I don't know your gamertag (or PSN ID) so haven't been able to verify what your battlelog shows and possibly discern a cause when viewing game history. But hopefully it has resolved itself for you after a few games played?   If so then let us know so we can keep it in mind if others also have similar issue.  Good luck.  Edit: ok... did a quick search and was able to locate your info (won't post your name here as you might not want it shared?) and it looks like in fact it does now reflect on Battlelog that your BloodMoney portion of Assignment has been complete. Elites Syndicate Assignment so it looks like the only remaining portions to complete are Heist (last time played you earned 4,850) and then get your 'Multiple Kill Bonus of 500 or higher'."

BF_Hardline,3c3odd,FalconiiLV,7,Tue Jul 7 07:17:47 2015 UTC,Its quiet because there is no PC community. BF: Hardline comes off as a mod to BF4. Nothing really pulling people to the game. Worst part is that EA/Visceral is going to lose the opportunity to sell when Battlefront drops.
BF_Hardline,3c3odd,SilverbackRekt,3,Sat Jul 4 22:43:20 2015 UTC,Battlefront looks waaaaaay too dumbed down for me. You think Hardline brought out the COD kiddies? Just wait.   I'll probably buy it anyway. <sigh>

BF_Hardline,3c3odd,packer126,0,Sat Jul 4 14:36:14 2015 UTC,Because entitled BF4 players think the game should have been an expansion except it is more different from bf4 than bf3 is from bf4. Just because it has less guns which is bullshit.
BF_Hardline,3c3odd,Troy_Davis,10,Sat Jul 4 20:16:56 2015 UTC,"Or the game is simply not engaging enough to keep its existing player numbers never mind actually grow.  Look at the stats for hardline and even the console players are dropping massively in numbers with only a 20k peak on the PS4 and 12k on the Xbone in the last 24 hours when a couple of months ago that was 80,000 players peak for each new console.  With the massive drop in people actually playing the game its understandable that fan forums will be much quieter too.  If it was purely ""entitled"" Battlefield 4 players not buying the game in the first place then Hardline would still have a decent population of players who did go and buy it in the first place. The fact that even those people are jumping ship to other games is a clear indication that the game has far more problems than ""entitled"" BF4 players."
BF_Hardline,3c3odd,fletch420man,5,Sat Jul 4 20:36:55 2015 UTC,I think there is less players because there is just too many games out there for people to invest all there time in one game. Now there is so many first person online shooters its hard to play only one. I was talking about entitled bf4 players because all they do is circlejerk in this subreddit. I enjoyed bf4 but I enjoy Hardline more. Do I go out of my way to go the bf4 subreddit and say everything that's wrong with it? No but that's what people do here and its annoying.
BF_Hardline,3c3odd,packer126,5,Sat Jul 4 20:43:45 2015 UTC,You're getting down voted...because you said you prefer hardline...(wait for it) on the hardline subreddit.
BF_Hardline,3c3odd,fletch420man,4,Sat Jul 4 23:54:28 2015 UTC,Like I said there are more bf4 people on this subreddit than bfh players. That's why I said entitled. I was salty maybe it was off mark but its how I feel.
BF_Hardline,3c3odd,packer126,2,Sun Jul 5 01:27:12 2015 UTC,I don't even get why it has to be a competition between which is better or which people prefer.  I enjoy both games and spend many hours on them.
BF_Hardline,3c3odd,innerpenguin,2,Sun Jul 5 16:51:52 2015 UTC,"Because for those of us that have played the entire 10+year franchise- there is an unwritten ""expectation"" (for lack of better word) for the ""community"" to take up each new release and in return the ""community"" get to generally expect a better product, and of course there is some push and pull to that whcih has loosely held this unwritten contract together over the years. And since as a class we have the ability to determine the games success or failure we also hold some sway. This is the first time everything has gone completely bad. bf4 was a tough launch but we got thru it and dice got beat up badly but got their shit together, visceral on the other hand just quit (apparently), which drove most of us back to BF4, which for me at least was a first. So it was hard man not just to have wasted a measly 60bucks, it was the failure of many years of contiguous gaming together that dies a little too. Cheers"

BF_Hardline,3c3odd,MidgetHunterxR,0,Sun Jul 5 19:38:14 2015 UTC,That's because the game was shit they had to get moving lest risk their whole fan base. There really isn't any broken parts of Hardline that I can think of and I have put a lot of time in bfh.

You won't find any sub to sub jumping around as you suggest. My sub activity is dedicated to the game I am playing which is BFH.   But maybe taking a very quick look at your own comments might explain why you have such a hard time communicating with others?   I don't have any friends, so i don't spend any time reading/sending messages, or sending/receiving invites. So for someone like me the Xbox One is perfect. I don't get frustrated or agitated over those problems. But if you're not a loner loser like me, then PS4 is probably better.

While you seem to think that the issue is others aren't seeing it for what it is?   You are trolling as you usually do and once again just finding something to hate on. Could be the issue you are having is your ability not to be able to make frieds and communicate with others?

BF_Hardline,3c3ysd,BillyHoWCR,0,Sat Jul 4 16:11:19 2015 UTC,An easy way would to find a No Kill server   Really... first idea is to recommend boosting? Is it that difficult to at least try and assist without instructing people to boost assignments?
BF_Hardline,3c3ysd,isamudragon,-3,Sat Jul 4 16:54:26 2015 UTC,"I named an EASY way. Common sense tells him to use the grappling hook & zipline frequently.  You don't have to like that method, but it is just as valid as the one you did. Only difference is that it is frowned upon by elitists like you.  Seeing as OP said they do not normally use those gadgets, why not boost those 2 items and get back to the gameplay style they enjoy?"
BF_Hardline,3c3ysd,BillyHoWCR,3,Sat Jul 4 19:04:30 2015 UTC,You are missing the point.
BF_Hardline,3c3ysd,isamudragon,-3,Sat Jul 4 19:06:37 2015 UTC,I thought the point of a GAME was to have fun? So what point did I miss?

Edit: and on your previous remark on ""Common sense tells him to use the grappling hook & zipline frequently.""... well that too simplifies the premise behind the issue and offers no tips to earning said coins needed while doing so without having to reduce yourself to not even playing the game."
BF_Hardline,3c3ysd,isamudragon,-1,Sun Jul 5 03:43:06 2015 UTC,"So 20mins TOPs doing boosting on a weapon that they had NO reason to use, then going back to their PREFERRED gameplay is not a viable option how?  They get the dumb challenge done then go back to fun gameplay. How is it missing the point again?  Is it because it doesn't follow your elitist method of getting it done?"

If it were cheating why the hell hasn't Viseral, EA, or Dice taken those servers down?   Give you a hint its not cheating.  How is it any different from a Pistol-Only, Knife-Only or a No-Sniper server?  Does someone boosting for a challenge take away ANYTHING away from you having fun. And don't give me that ""It cheapens my experience,"" crap.  I guarantee you most of the people that got the 4-tier parts of Syndicate Assignments boosted, why? Because it was seen as a stupid part of the mission.  How is it fun to be forced to use weapons or equipment that you a) never use, or b) hate using, to get a mission done?  You like to do things one way, I'm cool with that, but don't dump on me because I don't do things YOUR way.   90% of the missions I've done have been done through NORMAL gameplay. Give you a hint for the boring grinding crap, I'll boost, then go back to having fun on a normal server. So where was the counter to my idea to fun you mentioned?

BF_Hardline,3c3ysd,BillyHoWCR,1 point,Sun Jul 5 04:53:00 2015 UTC,"I guarantee you most of the people that got the 4-tier parts of Syndicate Assignments boosted, why?   No... because the easiest way to get the tier 4 was having a person in Hacker role upgrade you to Tier 4. I never went in a single 'no kill server' to get said achievements. And when I did find myself in a server where people took upon themselves to not kill each other... guess what, I played the game as it was designed to be played. And people died. ;)  And you still miss the point of all this... just because Visceral or Dice have been negligent in enforcing any standards doesn't make it right to boost. And Boosting is directly counter to ""having fun"".  The assignments are made to give you something to work towards and to teach you how to utilize specific aspects of the game. NOTHING about telling someone to BOOST assignments because it is easy... is ever considered constructive advise.   When you learn that then come back and give good advice... until then myself and others will reflect your opinion with the disdain it deserves.   You are now claiming that BOOSTING isn't cheating. Well... sorry but we don't buy it.   Does it effect me...? Not so much... but the point in giving people advice is to give them the advice that will assist them without pushing them into the idea that cheating/boosting is the easiest and best method."

The good thing is that they are not in the single player part, so there's still hope. I mean, they've shown them, and they are not in single player, bound to come as DLC, right ? RIGHT !???  Linkylink  edit: I made a post about them a while back, that I deleted bc I had it all wrong. Here's a couple of suggestions from that post :  ""I was hoping we'd get propeller planes. Maybe some souped up stunt planes like in Red Bull Air Race, with a couple of gatlings mounted on the wings. That could perhaps re-introduce two-seater planes, with different weapons for each seat, also making for some tactical insertions behind enemy lines, perhaps only ""passenger"" could eject. Open cockpit, climb on a wing !? Another thought was that there could be some actual visual mini destruction of the wings or propeller, making it harder to steer. Lastly, I think it would make the slow cruising speed more realistic than a jet.""  ""Probably wouldn't make sense that police had anything else but choppers. But the baddies could totally have rigged something up (propeller) for a spectacular heist ! I'd be okay with them being less effective than a jet, now that anti-air are pick-ups.""  ""Really though. I wouldn't mind if the prop planes flew just as fast as helicopters, but had guns & less health.""  ""And the second seat can have those old timey bombs with handles!""  ""I think they'd make more sense as prop planes as well. Hopefully the prop is a massive spinning death blade and not just fluff"""

BF_Hardline,3bz4vv,Slaytaniccc,2,Fri Jul 3 09:24:48 2015 UTC,I just unlocked the sawed off shotgun yesterday on PS4 and only used it long enough to get the 25 kills needed for the Menz in the Hood trophy. However I found it best to use the single shot when an enemy was back on to me. If it didn't kill them (because of range or a badly aimed shot on my part) I would shoot again usually killing them before or while they were turning around. I always shot both barrels when encountering a enemy face to face. I only played Blood Money as the money pile area in each map is always a great kill zone. Don't forget to buy the limited attachments for the gun as they make it better.   It took almost 40 hours to unlock the gun and get the final online trophy. I may jump online every now and then as I only discovered Hotwire late in playing and thought it was fun and different for a shooter online mode. I will not be buying any of the DLC as I'd rather Battlefield 4 which I do have premium bought for.

Big companies like MS and EA have departments of staff who just work BBB complaints.(advocacy department)  Its their job to talk to the highest level of complaints and issues.  If the biz does not satisfy you within the allotted time they could lose their ratings, if they can not prove that they tried everything in their power to satisfy your issue. They will call you and send letters, but have to try and make it right. You do not have to do anything more then keep a good record of who you talk to and what is going on and what is said, if its legal to record then do it, but give notice at start of call.

They made absolutely no promises as to what form they will take or when they will be released. You bought something based completely off your own assumption which had essentially no basis. And now you feel slighted for making a stupid consumer decision  This kind of attitude is what allows developers and publisher to put out mediocre content knowing that people like you will simply lap it up without question.
BF_Hardline,3bu0sf,legaleagle214,2,Thu Jul 2 14:47:37 2015 UTC,"Not discounting people who have legitimate problems running the game, I'm one of the lucky few that isn't hitching out from Punkbuster I guess.    I don't understand the obsession with ""Gunbench"" as it'll never be the feature that many people imagine it to be.  From the moment I heard about it I figured it would just allow you to twirl the gun around on the screen and apply the existing weapon textures to it, show you some very basic stats like how many kills you have with it and that's about it.    It's never going to be some super awesome weapon tuner feature because this game is tied to xbox360 and ps3 which are probably already at or is very close to pushing their memory capacity as it is.   Everything has to have parity across all platforms, including ""Gunbench""  Many have buyers regret but it's a bit of a stretch to call it a missing ""promised"" feature."

BF_Hardline,3bu0sf,Kiw1Fruit,1 point,Sun Jul 5 13:28:00 2015 UTC,"To be honest I just used the gunbench as an excuse to get premium refunded (it initially worked for many of us). That said, if I purchase premium based on a set of features I expect it to be there on day one unless explicitly mentioned (aka the DLC content).   Judging by your name you are somewhat an expert in this area. Wouldn't you agree that developers have been shitting on consumers long enough with crapping releases which do not live up to consumer exceptions? Would you agree that there should be better standards around what is considered a stable product?"
BF_Hardline,3bu0sf,TehDarkArchon,6,Fri Jul 3 11:38:14 2015 UTC,"As far as the premium features are concerned, I don't think we could make a case about them in regards to when they're being released, as that information was never fully disclosed to us. It's our fault for putting our trust in them and expecting the content to be released in a timely manner. The fact that a lot of this content is being released near the end of the game's life cycle, especially when it's already dead and dying on pretty much all platforms, is obviously pure idiocy, but there's nothing we can really do.  Now in terms of the DLC being unplayable due to low player count, I feel like that's an absolutely viable reason to demand a refund. As individual players, we have no control over how many people play the game and when they play it. Basically, I feel that it's not our problem that we don't have enough people playing the game, and they shouldn't be able to keep our $50 for content that's unplayable."

BF_Hardline,3bu0sf,thurst0n,2,Thu Jul 2 17:06:17 2015 UTC,"They used to have a lot more respect than they do now.  My understanding is that the US laws don't protect much besides things like blatant bait and switches. We consider advertising as an invitation to negotiate not as a promise for a specific good or service.   But obviously seeing an add on TV for lets say a chair and going to the store to buy it and finding out its a different chair and deciding then how to proceed (ask for discount, buy it anyway, not buy it, etc) is much different than buying digital media online, that's always changing and being developed.  It's an interesting gray area since clearly the original laws were not written for digital products.  Anyways, ya, the way I see it, sending a complaint to the BBB is sort of like telling grandma how shitty EA is."
BF_Hardline,3bu0sf,BumpyRocketFrog,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:19:12 2015 UTC,"I havent studied US Law but in the UK it is similar but with much stronger post-contractual obligations on the seller, particularly if they are a business.  Adverts are considered invitations to treat and are not an offer to contract but may be used to pursue breach of contract claims after offer and acceptance of the contract takes place.  Items sold have to be 'As Described' no matter what and be 'of satisfactory quality' with consideration to be made as to whether the goods are new or second hand.  In the UK if you make a claim in the small claims court and win - costs are paid by the losing party so for something like this often a letter or two reminding them of this will get your money back.  In this case I suspect OP would have no chance of getting his money back with the game but premium would be doable.  Edit: If anyone from the UK is here www.adviceguide.co.uk is the central citizens advice knowledgebase for basically any civil rights information you may ever need. It is ridiculously useful.

A movie works if it plays but interactive media is different."
BF_Hardline,3bu0sf,Bluenite0100,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:31:17 2015 UTC,"That in respect of OP's case would likely be whether in the gun bench was advertised with a specific date of delivery, correct me if I'm wrong but it was advertised as being part of premium but with no specific date given to it.   OP would argue that the advertising implied it would be available for the duration of the premium period and I think he has good grounds for this. I certainly would be pissed off if I had bought premium.   Of course this would only matter if it actually went to court. In which case it is likely, given that EA have a pit of lawyers somewhere, that there is wording in the licence that OP would have probably clicked through when he bought premium.   In there UK such agreements are held valid but don't override their AD & SQ rights in the contract.   'As described' is more of an objective qualification. Does it contain the promised DLC? This is where his argument lies. Im not going to look on Lexis Nexis now but any previous similar case law in his favour would help but it would be quote unlikely that it would ever get this far given the value of the goods involved.   'Satisfactory Quality' would likely cover the quality of the items delivered. Did the maps/DLC function? OP may be able to argue here that one go the qualities of the gun bench is its availability in game and that when it is not available for the majority of the life of the game it is not of satisfactory quality.   Well IANLAL (work it out) but hope thats mostly still right. Moved into Freelance Web Development ... much better :)"

The game plays fine for a few minutes, then cpu usage spikes, game freezes for 2-5 seconds, back to normal. This happens every couple of minutes. Supposedly fixed in the first patch, but was not for me and others. Best $40 I ever spent on a game, can't play it and there's usually 3 servers full at any one time."

But seriously, Gun Bench is the one most anticipated feature of the whole Premium program and it is the LAST thing they will do? WTF?    I think they have no idea what to actually do with it and just threw it out as a marketing thing because some of our well known YouTubers were talking about the Gun Bench from Medal of Honor and how cool that was... i bet you they did it with a ""lets figure this one out later""-mentality and still have no idea how to actually make it better than what BF4 already has in place.    But i also have to say, despite all the letdowns, despite the pathetic player numbers on PC, i still have fun with the game, i just wish more people had fun with it and wouldn't just blindly hate on it. It is an OK game, not as awesome as BF3 or 4, certainly not worth the money EA is asking, but there is no need to blindly hate on it."
BF_Hardline,3bu0sf,cutter89locater,2,Thu Jul 2 23:56:57 2015 UTC,"iirc they never said when it'll be avaliable, just that you'll get access to the gun bench with premium. None of the features really had a set date from what I remember."
BF_Hardline,3bu0sf,TheComebackDude,2,Fri Jul 3 02:54:32 2015 UTC,It makes me laugh to see they are the exact same with customer service since BF2.  EA is like the Mr.Burns of the gaming industry.
BF_Hardline,3bu0sf,cutter89locater,2,Fri Jul 3 16:18:49 2015 UTC,"I've bought the game, because it looked really good and after that o've bought premium, because the game is actually amazing. Your shitposting is pretty good, but come on, people cant be that stupid."
BF_Hardline,3bu0sf,AMidgetAndAClub,3,Mon Jul 6 11:10:36 2015 UTC,Another reason not to trust video game publisher these days. We're not protected by regular consumer protection legislation or rights. Don't pay for premium until things are released.

They will continue to push out dates forever, no ones getting shit back either, just that visceral fucked this franchise- or possibly saved it pending your view. Cause one thing should be clear for everyone- next studio that makes a BF title better not expect jackshit for preorders- game will launch complete or fail on arrival (or shortly thereafter) like this sad mess."
BF_Hardline,3bu0sf,GavinET,-4,Fri Jul 3 14:35:22 2015 UTC,I think there were literally 100's of post with 'DON'T PREORDER' before the game came out.  You lie in the bed you made.
BF_Hardline,3bu0sf,scarystuff,3,Thu Jul 2 08:13:13 2015 UTC,"This doesn't really apply to Hardline though, becaus they game was fine at release. It worked and had pretty much all the promised features. As he says in the thread, there is no way he could have foreseen that a promised premium feature would be released a year after release.

It is not an issue at my friends place and he lives within 10 miles of my house.  Is there anyway to fix this server problem?

Had he started healing first and died like that you wouldn't have gotten credit.

BF_Hardline,3bqjb6,TheBeardedMarxist,3,Wed Jul 1 18:43:10 2015 UTC,I assumed it was a customization environment where you can create your own gun camo or paint designs. Maybe even red dot sight colors and reticules. Like cars in Forza 3.  I can't imagine it being anything else.
BF_Hardline,3bqjb6,comicbookbeard,4,Wed Jul 1 20:18:15 2015 UTC,"Agreed buddy!  Let's look at it from a few view points.   Stock market: --Would you buy a stock tending like this?  As a customer: The dangled bonus item that distinguished itself apart from others is not accessible/available for a year and a half. (But you took payment) --Would you buy a car for its convertible roof, but not get roof for year and half.   As a company: --Would you acquire/buyout/merge with another company that was trending down like this, pay full price now, but can't access it for a year and a half?  No to all.

If you don't fit the return policies standards, then it won't work. But I did express my frustrations at releasing a major selling point of a feature that i wanted close to release. They said they would forward that message to the devs to try and get a 2015 release. Since we already have modders doing the exact same thing on private servers. So WTF is Visceral doing, for their version to take so long."
BF_Hardline,3bqjb6,comicbookbeard,3,Wed Jul 1 17:49:44 2015 UTC,Try again. Myself and the people I play with (4 in total) were all able to get refunds on the ultimate editions we purchased. This was just the past week.

BF_Hardline,3bqjb6,tyler2k,7,Wed Jul 1 18:02:00 2015 UTC,"If you think the gun bench coming out Q1 2016 is a joke, what about the other ""features""?  Legendary status, aka deleting a row or two from the database is now considered a feature? Wow.  Enhanced competitive play? Good luck with that on PC. The game is already dead, who's going to be around to even compete?  I should also note that this seems like a pretty clear case of false advertising. I don't recall any of these 4 features being tied to the individual DLCs previously.  I encourage everyone who purchased premium to ask for a refund and go buy yourself a game worth playing. I was able to get a refund by simply talking to someone on EA Chat. Show EA/DICE/Visceral that we wont put up with this shit and get your money back."
BF_Hardline,3bqjb6,micahwave,12,Thu Jul 2 00:46:32 2015 UTC,"I'm having a hard time even believing this. The last expansion is probably going to be the least played DLC of all time as it's competiting with the likes of rainbow six, battlefront, black ops 3, fallout 4, destiny's expansion, and many other games, but they expect people to come back and play an already dying game because of some extra customization features? They should be releasing these now, not later when the playerbase is already dead."

Maybe coming with them as the first dlc would've worked out. My squad is basically rescue only and we are finally seeing the mode start to die on PS4. It did surprisingly well until the dlc came out. Now the small community is split between 2 map pools and that will be the death of the mode. The next dlc will be the nail in the coffin.

Visceral went from being well liked to being on par with the scummiest of EA reps.

I have had no problem getting on servers and enjoying the game. Gun balance is not a concern of mine. Definitely don't care for a gun bench. Why would I want to customize my reticles? If I wanted a childish feature such as that I would go play some COD. Give me more maps to keep me entertained and I am good to go.

Everytime I go to play hardline, into my very first game there's always a point when the game suddenly gets all the graphics loaded or something and you can tell because the game will do a split second pause midgame , this is the point that will either cause your game to freeze or if you make it past this your good for the day or as long as you don't ""quit"" BFHardline. The same thing would happen in BF4 , you would see the surroundings (grass, little details) all around you getting loaded up whenever a game would start, then there a split second when everything is loaded and the game kicks into full gear. I'm sure alot of people have noticed this.....but on BF4 soon as you get past this point your good...but it occured way less than it does on hardline.

BF_Hardline,3bmzxt,P__A,1 point,Tue Jun 30 16:18:25 2015 UTC,"The only difference between the two (AFAIK) is the inclusion of Premium. If you're going to play on PC, it is possible to get Premium cheaper than $50, in which case I I'd quickly shop around before making the leap. Of course it was a no-brainer to skip Ultimate before but now that the first DLC is out, obviously it's been made a little trickier."
BF_Hardline,3bmzxt,frumpypump,1 point,Tue Jun 30 15:16:06 2015 UTC,"What platform are you on? Ultimate on PS4 doesn't work at the moment so you would only get vanilla maps and dlc guns, as everyone can use the dlc guns weather you have premium or not, just pick your loadout on battlelog and you should be able to use them ingame.

Hardline does seem to be a stop gap until battlefront is released at the end of this year though. Two updates in 3 months isn't fast enough for the amount of problems the game has imo, gun balance, netcode, and map design along with communication from devs are the main reasons I've lost faith in the game, and I REALLY loved this game on release."

I recommend selecting a 'boost' that increases your rep and then searching the servers for 'hotwire' lobby that doesn't alow killing and that has less than 15 people in. Find a car and then drive around the map, if you put ammo or first aid on your bonnet you'll get some extra points when a squad mate joins.   Once I found this out I unlocked the relevant syndicate assignments no problem (takes 5-15 minutes per match, obviously depending on how big your boost increase is. Then you just have to play ten matches)   There's other ways as well, for instance blood money is ideal since they introduced the tactical tool kit on the enforcer class, you pick up money so fast your rep goes through the roof, bonus if you have a hacker.   Anyway, try what I suggested and just ask if you are still struggling."

BF_Hardline,3bhy8d,JamesTrendall,3,Thu Jul 2 21:56:20 2015 UTC,Click reset on filter settings > scroll down to the bottom of the page until no more servers load > sort by players > look for the handcuffs / CA logo  Searching is bugged out and messes up all the time so if your finding no servers reset the filter.  Also change Free slots too All i got about 2 pages of servers for EU/NA
BF_Hardline,3bhy8d,Cramer02,1 point,Fri Jul 3 00:19:21 2015 UTC,The only filters I have on are for North America and Criminal Activity. When I shut off North America there were 4 servers total all with 130+ ping

GMG says they don't allow refunds on codes which they have distributed and Origin won't give me a refund because I didn't buy Premium directly through them (which makes sense).  EA Support told me that the only codes that they have for Premium are for PC; they don't have any PS4 or Xbone codes to distribute because those are sold only through other retailers."

BF_Hardline,3bi2xh,sniperwhg,3,Mon Jun 29 14:33:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah the double barrel shotgun is basically an anus destroyer at close range. I honestly thought it'd be more novelty than anything due to 2 shot capacity and 10year reload time, but honestly that gun has the ability to obliterate anything at close range. If you unload both barrels up close on a vehicle you can 1hit kill it. Or atleast put it to 10hp."
BF_Hardline,3bi2xh,helpmymotherboard,2,Mon Jun 29 20:21:25 2015 UTC,Wow. I got nearly 700 kills with it and only really use it on CQ maps so never really used it on vehcile maps. I'll try it on a vehicle tonight :)

I just used the Battelog on my app and bought the new guns and attachments without paying for any DLC/Premium. But from what I've heard and what /u/P33KAJ3W just mentioned, the maps are worth it themselves.   Forgot to mention the Enforcer perk (can't remember name) that let's you use objectives faster. Definitely buy that ASAP! I always play blood money, and can get fully loaded on the money pile/enemy fault by myself in under 10 secs.

BF_Hardline,3bi4jr,rev_me_bro,4,Mon Jun 29 23:21:36 2015 UTC,FYI: You seem to be able to purchase the dlc weapons (using in game cash) on battlelog using a PC even if you don't have criminal activity (they are then available on which ever platform you use). Not sure if this is on purpose to encourage people to play or simply a mistake.  Thought this may be useful when deciding if you should purchase the dlc.  EDIT:Typing error

The fact that they didn't regroup and bring in some extra talent to sort the game out it what doomed them. I mean fuck their launch was marginally better than bf4's clusterfuck, but where DICE took their lumps and got out there and started working right away visceral just watched as the playerbase bailed on their broken product- I mean fuck the game didn't see any  changese for 5 weeks when there were issues warranting a patch the first week. I'm gonna stop now.....but it is goddamn sad......"
BF_Hardline,3bhw4h,fletch420man,12,Mon Jun 29 16:49:42 2015 UTC,People associate the Battlefield franchise with large scale military warzones - not cops and robbers. It just didn't appeal to the larger fanbase that traditional Battlefield's do. I think Hardline would have been a roaring success if it had of been a $30 dollar expansion for BF4. Doing that wouldn't have split the community either. I guess it was just poorly devised from the start.
BF_Hardline,3bhw4h,ohyou123,7,Mon Jun 29 11:33:11 2015 UTC,"It seems like a complete cash grabbing, rush job to me. My personal guess would be that EA noticed the particularly weak iteration in the CoD cycle (CoDAW), and sought to acquire some of their playerbase & market share.  After playing the beta, I think (could be wrong here) a lot of people, myself included, seemed perfectly content to pay $60 for this game, based on the promise of what was to come.   However, I think the game failed because   while the beta was promising, it masked a lot of the problems surrounding this game (shit spawn points, horrendous driving physics, etc). This was compounded by the complete lack of weapon balance, leading to players being able to count the amount of guns worth using on one hand. The fact that Visceral had little to no experience with multi player games was painfully evident.  Lack of guns in general More lazy physics like incendiary grenades clipping through walls.  Shotgun Lag  Horrible post-launch upkeep & development. How did it take so long make minor balancing changes? Gun Bench? Lack of any tangible premium benefits, leading to an even saltier view and more distrust of the developers & producers."
BF_Hardline,3bhw4h,nastylep,2,Mon Jun 29 16:48:28 2015 UTC,"I am disappointed with Visceral, but I'm not giving up on them. It took a year for BF4 to become playable, which just goes to show that while its easy to just abandon a game, any game can be saved if the developer is commited to do so. I hope Visceral will do the right thing."
BF_Hardline,3bhw4h,Typical_Ratheist,1 point,Mon Jun 29 21:10:16 2015 UTC,It did take a year for BF4 but another group of devs took over...DICE LA. This was what made the huge difference. Not sure the same will happen for Hardline.

I've been playing the series since BF2's launch and I personally think the last good game was BF3. Now everything is about gadgets and perks and not even really about class synergy anymore.

Lack of updates and how delayed (and ineffective) the first one was just compounds everything and pissed me off.
BF_Hardline,3bhw4h,IHaveNoFiya,3,Mon Jun 29 16:11:45 2015 UTC,"but you should consider that some people don't like it because it is simply not a very good game.   I do, but where they are wrong is when they say ""it is simply not a very good game."" That is their opinion, nothing more. That's what it is in a lot of cases when it comes to people critiquing games. The problem is some players can't look past their own views; therefore, those with differing opinions are wrong/stupid.   Many players will agree that Hardline was much more playable from day one that BF4 ever was and people waited a whole year for that game to be fixed so I don't want to hear complaints about slow patches or anything like that because as is Hardline is still light years ahead of where BF4 was at this point in its release.   Read through this. There might be some changes you have not considered that overall were welcomed with open arms by the community."

BF_Hardline,3bhw4h,dungeonmstr,4,Mon Jun 29 16:33:27 2015 UTC,"I'm not going to force myself to find the fun. I don't like it so I don't play it.  And it isn't any one gun which has upset me, just the lack of overall balance. But that's just scratching the surface of the problems with this game in my opinion.  Anyway, I'm not someone who has a problem with people enjoying HL. My point is that the answer to ""why isn't it popular?"" isn't limited to ""it's not a proper Battlefield""."
BF_Hardline,3bhw4h,IHaveNoFiya,1 point,Mon Jun 29 16:46:30 2015 UTC,"But it is popular. No, not on the scale of BF4 but again that is also because a lot of people never gave it a chance. Again tunnel vision. There are people that still say Hardline is nothing more than a $60 BF4 mod when in fact it is a vastly different game and many improvements were made to the gameplay.   You don't like it and that's your choice to make but don't try to make it out as if the game is more or less dead because you don't enjoy it. I have a friend, yes this is only one opinion, but he loved BF4; however, he actually enjoys Hardline a lot more than BF4.   It all comes down to differing opinions, period."

Every round is very chaotic. The game is not prepared for more than 32p but the majority of the servers are 64p.  Every round is TDM. I mean, Conquest is TDM with flags, Blood Money is TDM with money, etc etc etc... This is why i used the ""Origin warranty"" to ask for a refund. I'm glad about the choice I made."
BF_Hardline,3bhw4h,coldape,0,Mon Jun 29 18:11:18 2015 UTC,I think if they had removed the word Battlefield from the title people would have accepted it for the game it is much more. However it probably would have sold less if they had done this.   I think BF4 is a better (more impressive) game but I'm currently having much more fun playing BFH

BF_Hardline,3bhw4h,arron77,1 point,Mon Jun 29 15:19:25 2015 UTC,I enjoy Hardline. On BF4 you spend the entire time trying not get crippled by tanks since the only busy servers are conquest large.   The classes are more balanced and useful.  Grappling hook/zipline make the game more interesting overall.

NOPE. you will drop. people need to learn the faster reaction time needed and quit bitching about how effed up the game is...... in my humble opinion, its the player, not the game. learn the TTK, learn how to kill faster, learn how not run around like an idiot. learn to use cover... its not the game....... its you.  let the hate comments begin, i dont give a shit."

I've only ever used the Sony App to login to my account. Would seem odd if my account was ""hacked"" and someone decided to buy battlefield premium or season pass, or whatever it's called.

BF_Hardline,3bfkld,SourceWebMD,3,Mon Jun 29 18:03:21 2015 UTC,"How I did it for all 4 classes solo is hotwire. It's a bit boring but it works well.   Apply a 100% reputation boost (or if you don't have one, objective boost works too). Join hotwire. Just find a car and drive around and try your hardest not to die. Driving in circles near your team's base works best. If you notice enemies converging on your path, get away ASAP. Rinse/repeat.   Also, every time you die, it will reset your progress to the next tier.   Or, if you have a friend, have them play hacker and just have them apply upgrades to your squad."
BF_Hardline,3bfkld,phonicmu1202,4,Mon Jun 29 18:13:32 2015 UTC,"If you look under the boosts there is a small progress bar. It's not super accurate, but it give you some idea. It resets every time you die.  Here are a couple tips: first, get squad leader of a full squad and set objectives. Second, when you hit tier 3, be super cautious. If you're playing blood money hang back and defend the vault until you hit 4. Enlist a hacker, if you can plan ahead of time they can save the upgrade for when you hit 3. I often get 1 and 2 in such quick succession it seems a waste to use it until later."
BF_Hardline,3bfkld,Bro-LoElCunado,3,Mon Jun 29 19:14:34 2015 UTC,Thank your for the tips. I mainly play CQL but I'm going to have to find a strategy that let's me hit all 4 reps fast.
BF_Hardline,3bfkld,phonicmu1202,3,Sun Jun 28 21:33:34 2015 UTC,Bloodmoney or Hotwire are your best chance. In blood money using the tactical gloves on the enforcer class I pretty much get my 4 tier by my second or third life 95% of the time since the update.

All I did was play Rescue and Crosshair. With the last patch you get additional points each round you win, so I usually had Rep 3 by halftime.   I don't know if this is a glitch or what, but instead of resetting the perks after halftime, getting a single kill (or even a 25pt bonus) gave me back all the perks from the first half, so just playing a little more would get me the fourth tier rep. I'm pretty good at Swat-Mix (KD ~5.5) but regardless, you should be able to do it this way with some 50% or 100% boosts."

BF_Hardline,3bfkld,richm1975,1 point,Sun Jun 28 21:20:04 2015 UTC,"I managed to unlock the FMG9 yesterday in just a few hours. I have found 2 methods that work the best for me. The first one is probably the most common, and that's Hotwire. Most people will usually suggest a server that has very few players in 4 or 6 or whatever and then you just grab an objective car and drive around. I found it faster to just find a full lobby, get a good driver, and sit inside and chill. As a mechanic it's even better because you can repair the car as you go along. It took me about 12 games to get all 10 4th Reps unlocked.  The other option is to find a Downtown 24/7 Conquest server. Rotate between A and D flag. They're usually easy to solo cap, and if you win a few gunfights here and there you should have 4th Rep 15mins into the game. Alternatively you could add the E flag to your rotation as well. This is the method i used to unlock the ARM and i'll probably do something similar for the Double Barrel.   And of course. having a 50% or 100% boost cn only help."

BF_Hardline,3bfgi8,nitromane,3,Sun Jun 28 21:59:06 2015 UTC,I've always loved the ARM even though it had a very slow ttk because it gave you the opportunity to kill lots of players without reloading (killing 5 with one clip). In the latest patch it received a big buff which increases the damage of each bullet.
BF_Hardline,3bfgi8,coldape,2,Sun Jun 28 19:37:40 2015 UTC,"On PC at least, the AK, M16 and M416 are controllable enough at range to be better than the ARM at range."

BF_Hardline,3bfgi8,yosoytupadre,1 point,Mon Jun 29 04:25:50 2015 UTC,"It does the same damage, only various is that m16a3 has a faster bullet velocity  and higher RPM, the ARM has a much lower recoil in every direction as well as lower spread  than the M16a3, as well as 20 more bullets in magazine. So what you are looking at is ARM is more accurate per shot than then the m16a3, but m16a3 can get more bullets out faster, but doesn't really matter how fast you can shoot bullets out if the other person can peg you in the head twice before you can even  get a couple hit markers."
BF_Hardline,3bfgi8,Bilwald,1 point,Mon Jun 29 07:16:21 2015 UTC,"I am not disputing that, I was simply pointing out that regardless of skill the ARM is more accurate than the M416 and m16A3. I have stated in my post that yes if you are met in 1v1 scernario in close range the m16a3 and the m416 will win every time if the players have the similar skill level. What I was pointing out the same is true with them ARM if players with the similar skill level the ARM will beat out m416 and m16a3 every time in a long distance battle; While in medium range its a even fight"
BF_Hardline,3bfgi8,maxcatz34,1 point,Mon Jun 29 07:21:12 2015 UTC,When I finally unlocked it was a little underwhelmed with the ARM's performance. After watching a recent video and reading your post maybe I will give it another shot.

BF_Hardline,3bgyna,GregoryGoose,1 point,Mon Jun 29 20:34:47 2015 UTC,"Honest Q -- are there flank routes though on Black Friday? To get from, say, B to D, while bypassing C? I've played it a handful of times on CQ LG, and I'm either on the receiving end or giving end of getting pinned, usually down to 1 flag. There doesn't appear to be any side corridors that I've found during the games I've played, that aren't already guarded by an enemy squad, like Metro.  I guess I'm a bit lazy as I could load up an empty map and look for them myself, but I thought I would ask.  :-)  Thanks."

BF_Hardline,3bgyna,JonnyIndica,1 point,Mon Jun 29 23:14:23 2015 UTC,"""Early access"" is just a sale slogan, the purpose of ""premium"" is to drive higher sales at a point when a customer is more likely to buy additional product. Gamers are far less likely to purchase dlc at the end of a games cycle than at the beginning, and that is whah premium is gunning for. The ""extra"" bang for your buck with with premium isn't product but just access. But all of this is irrelevant as my main point with premium is the effect the package has on the customer base."

Plus bf4 is getting new free maps eventually."

The maps had enough variety in game play so I never felt I was playing the same map w/ a different skin. That is my issue w/ BFHL. If there was one map w/ a central camping point that would be fine. I would hate that map, but there are always maps a gamer doesn't play well on. To have almost every single map have the same game play though is lazy and frustrating."

Visceral hasn't fixed some major issues, why should i continue to support a company that can't even support a product i already bought?   I hate COD, however there are at least semi-frequent updates. I feel like Viseral/EA don't care about their community and are content w/ huge issues."
BF_Hardline,3bgyna,Slaytaniccc,2,Mon Jun 29 04:55:55 2015 UTC,"CoD is semi-frequently updated with pay-to-win content. Can't really even call that content. How long did it take them to nerf the BAL and then after that nerf the AMS1? Few weeks in between. I don't see Hardline having similar issues to that though. Guns are, for the most part, balanced. And even if they aren't, there's a lot of gun variety. You don't keep getting killed by the same 2 weapons. CoD had map glitches that took months to fix. Months. Some of them still exist on old consoles, and AW has been out for how long now?   Welcome to the new era of gaming people. This is how things are going to be for a very long time, until people start using their heads. Stop pre-ordering, stop buying content you can't have immediately. You're essentially paying them up front for a product you have no idea about. At the end of the day, you only have yourself to blame. Doesn't matter how reputable of a company it is, it's still a business and it's about making money. And if they can cut corners to save a few pennies, you can bet your ass they will."

BF_Hardline,3bgyna,WCR-jv27,1 point,Wed Jul 1 09:18:34 2015 UTC,"Much different story on Console. I guess since recoil is easier to control on PC you'll see more M416/M16A3, but on Console they have a lot more kick than some of the other guns, which probably makes them a bit harder to use for the average player."
BF_Hardline,3bgyna,RICExTANK,0,Wed Jul 1 10:52:21 2015 UTC,"So because you had bad luck, it's not pay-to-win? Fairly terrible logic. It's still pay-to-win. You are allowed to spend money to have a chance at getting a better (or the best) weapon. Whether it's a gamble or not is irrelevant. The fact that a micro-transaction has the ability to give you the upper-hand is pretty much the definition of pay-to-win."

BF_Hardline,3bgab4,cutlerf,-3,Sun Jun 28 23:48:46 2015 UTC,Maybe a bit of exaggeration but I'm just saying how they shoot extremely fast and might as well be fully auto considering how people use them
BF_Hardline,3bgab4,Troy_Davis,4,Sun Jun 28 23:59:56 2015 UTC,No?  Have you used a DMR? They're pretty well balanced.
BF_Hardline,3bgab4,partypete1337,2,Mon Jun 29 11:29:01 2015 UTC,I can't hit shit with them. Fire a whole clip with sights on 'em (or so I think) and only land a few. I wouldn't say they need a buff at all. Takes some getting used to.
BF_Hardline,3bgab4,FalconiiLV,2,Mon Jun 29 19:18:51 2015 UTC,"The spread increase per shot is pretty bad on DMRs. If you fire them as fast as you can pull the trigger they are pretty inaccurate. Shoot them at about two shots per second, though, and they are pretty deadly."
BF_Hardline,3bgab4,SilverbackRekt,-5,Mon Jun 29 22:01:08 2015 UTC,All I'm saying is that being constantly sprayed by a dmr is annoying especially with all of the suppression they do
BF_Hardline,3bgab4,SilverbackRekt,2,Mon Jun 29 07:08:08 2015 UTC,No because they have heavy recoil. If you don't take controlled accurate shots you are going to be garbage with them.
BF_Hardline,3bgab4,dewey2100,0,Mon Jun 29 07:36:54 2015 UTC,Then why do I constantly get killed by people unloading them as fast as they can
BF_Hardline,3bgab4,xGRNxiCool,2,Sun Jun 28 23:58:32 2015 UTC,Dunno. I mainly role with DMR's but up close when I have an AR they usually can't beat me. And not being rude but maybe you just need to play more and increase your skill.
BF_Hardline,3bgab4,xGRNxiCool,-1,Mon Jun 29 00:01:50 2015 UTC,Oh no I agree but I'm not talking about up close I seriously get killed from long range and they still shoot the gun as fast as they can and I get suppressed so its pretty tough to shoot back
BF_Hardline,3bgab4,brollyssj4,4,Mon Jun 29 00:17:26 2015 UTC,"If its long range, they aren't shooting as fast as they can.  They are taking pot shots at you once their reticule has come back from recoil.  Maybe you should try out the DMRs and see for yourself."
BF_Hardline,3bgab4,IAmTheFatman666,-1,Mon Jun 29 00:20:14 2015 UTC,Yeah but they hit me with a high percentage of those shots and the shots that don't hit me suppress me like they're coming from a 50 cal

BF_Hardline,3bgab4,Denman20,3,Mon Jun 29 21:32:31 2015 UTC,Well what about counter sniping them with that SA58? Single fire and you can unload on them as fast you can? Switch over to full when you run 'n gun. Unlimited ammo as enforcer. That's what I do at least. And you have very little recoil with that BR while the DMR has a lot.
BF_Hardline,3bgab4,RedTerror98,1 point,Mon Jun 29 21:38:50 2015 UTC,"lol its annoying YES ... but that does not make it ""over powered"" my friend."
BF_Hardline,3bgab4,RedTerror98,-3,Mon Jun 29 21:45:51 2015 UTC,I just think DMR' s shouldn't be able to use a frickin sniper scope.
BF_Hardline,3bgab4,BarelyRegal1,3,Wed Jul 1 13:11:09 2015 UTC,"The SR25 a.k.a M110 is a sniper weapon system. Don't take away the scope options from guns that were meant to have them. They should just put in some actual DMRs maybe.   There's a reason a lot of organizations are using Semi-Automatic weapon systems as they're long range rifles, faster follow up shots with groupings that are very tight. The game portrays the weapons in their true nature. Faster velocity and less drop on the Bolt rifles works great.   I think the answer here is to reduce suppression from the semi-auto rifles being as though players can spam the general area and keep the target suppressed with little effort."
BF_Hardline,3bdj4c,Slaytaniccc,-8,Sun Jun 28 04:58:06 2015 UTC,"What is seriously annoying is the fact the video is only 28 seconds long but for some reason you want to show us 14 seconds of it being simply you waiting to spawn?

BF_Hardline,3beh3p,wda_exodus,3,Sun Jun 28 13:54:53 2015 UTC,"Did the Gamechanger program really improve battlefield hardline? And will it improve SW Battlefront or any future titles?   I think this program isn't that great, developers need to develop their own game with their own mindset and listen after the launch of the game. Otherwise you get a real mess. Yes, they give some valid feedback. But it's not like you don't get feedback from an alpha or beta phase. These youtubers are only there to sell their game, look at levelcap. ""OMG best battlefield ever ""... in the end, just an average title in the series.  Next to that you see that developers don't like honest and fair opinions about their game. Look at the discussion between Matimi0 and Zachulon."
BF_Hardline,3beh3p,Driezzz,4,Sun Jun 28 15:15:03 2015 UTC,"The ""Gamechanger"" program was just a massive publicity stunt. The only thing changed was the Survivalist gadget nerf (did Visceral really not know that a self revive mechanic in an FPS was a bad idea?).  According to Visceral, Hardline was in development since early 2012. That's over 3 years, and look at the end product:   Completely nonsensical weapon balance Completely nonsensical vehicle balance No class balance Sub par ""netcode"" Sub par destruction, almost to the point of nonexistence Awful map design Game modes open to major exploitation (Hotwire) No ""all out warfare"" Unfinished gamemodes (Rescue)   Gamechangers did fuck all. Why do you think none of the Youtubers play Hardline anymore?"
BF_Hardline,3beh3p,1randomguy,2,Sun Jun 28 15:35:08 2015 UTC,"Well, first of all, it appears you are directly comparing Hardline to BF4.  All out warfare?  While Hardline isn't a war game, it provides plenty of action.  The maps aren't bad.  I actually like most of them.  The patch turned down the burn rate on Hotwire.  Also, what does it matter?  Boosters are going to boost regardless.  I don't understand what you mean by class balance.  I personally play a bit of everything, depending on mode.  And yes the gamechangers did a lot.  Trust me, many of the functions and fixes in the game were recommended or thought of by them."
BF_Hardline,3beh3p,rev_me_bro,2,Sun Jun 28 19:17:27 2015 UTC,Why do you think none of the Youtubers play Hardline anymore?   Because most YouTubers are on PC. With recoil as easy as it is with a mouse the TTK in Hardline is blazing fast so most of the PC community (YouTubers) left Hardline in frustration.
BF_Hardline,3beh3p,MayonnaisePacket,4,Tue Jun 30 03:43:15 2015 UTC,"I don't really see that big of a gun unbalance, i mean sure there are some guns that maybe marginal better than others but you are going to see that in every game. As for class unbalance I have no idea what the hell you are talking about there."
BF_Hardline,3beh3p,tyler2k,2,Sun Jun 28 18:15:32 2015 UTC,"Yeah, actually the Class Balance is pretty good. I wonder if OP is saying that the weapon balance cascades into being an issue for classes.  IMO: Mechanic > Professional > Enforcer > Operator > Mechanic  What's really interesting is how the dynamic in the game can change, especially when one class is heavily favored over another.  Lots of .300 Knockouts => Mechanic with Armor => Operator/Enforcers with AP or Professionals with Magnums  Is one such example. The only problem is newer players still can't feel the dynamic change so they pretty much just stick with one class and just ride it out when they need to learn to be ahead of the curve and punish it. Actually if you compare it to BF4 or even pretty much any BF game before it, there was no real dynamic so to speak. Everything was just... static. The only real dynamic was use AA if they're attacking by air or AT if by ground. In BF4 the only real dynamic counter was Air Burst but was so good in pretty much , it could pretty much be used in any situation and be successful."

Not the case in BF4.   Not saying Hardline doesnt feel good as it does feel awesome in some ways compared to BF4, and I also agree firmly devs need to do there job and not ask us for help. Some of the stuff we could do but most of it we will never understand. They know this stuff better than anyone, or so they should. Hardline feels great to play though, I feel like the only difference is the tick rate at this point and like you said having multiple triple digit pings in the server."

That's partly because maps are smaller and don't have to same detail, causing Hardline to run smoother.  Also, when stating Hardline was one step ahead of BF4, that's in terms of netcode patch progression."

BF_Hardline,3bcqj0,Driezzz,2,Sun Jun 28 17:31:47 2015 UTC,"BF3's patch notes were just a list of our videos (which we took offline). I think this time around it's just 3 of them but I haven't had time to really test all 20 since the last patch, too busy cutting together footage for the next 5. That's what takes the longest, is just figuring out how you want to show people something in a humorous way with only 3 minutes to do it. We found this hole in the first 45 minutes of playing the DLC. A couple days later we found other ways, but this one felt like the most obvious method at the time and the easiest to patch. We like to scale up the complexity as we go. So the first ""periscope gun"" was available to anyone, just by firing an underslung shotgun and switching back quickly. But it was patched twice and so the complexity escalated until our last method involved placing a spawn beacon, dying inside a vehicle, spawning on the beacon and hitting the enter vehicle button at the same time, getting out and sending yourself into a short free fall, and then placing a mortar. That's when the videos get really fun, once you get past episode 50 and it isn't as simple as finding a giant fucking hole in the map.  The most complicated one I have in the cue right now is how to place a floating spawn beacon in the sky, sort of like how our floating zipline is, but with completely different steps."

BF_Hardline,3bbgwb,jonah63,-1,Sat Jun 27 18:24:34 2015 UTC,yes i don't know if i used it in previous bf titles if it is turned on by default or if the even added it then yes but when you consider BFH isn't traditional sniper friendly anyway (ie no maps that are massive with super long headshot's) most of the kills you get with the class are going to be in the 30m to 100m range so it's helpful in those instances. Since they are also not tracking long headshots in Hardline. LOOK for yourself on battellog and bfhstats.com they are not recorded so what can you brag about when they aren't even recorded in the game
BF_Hardline,3bcrzb,Bananas_Npyjamas,6,Sun Jun 28 00:08:18 2015 UTC,"Being good or bad is really subjective.

BF_Hardline,3bap7t,BillyHoWCR,1 point,Sat Jun 27 12:00:45 2015 UTC,It would also bring people back who stopped due its ''cod like'' TTK
BF_Hardline,3bap7t,fugazied,2,Sat Jun 27 12:10:39 2015 UTC,"I left the game because of the COD-like TTK.  It allows for spray-and-pray, rewards camping, punishes PTFO and removes a lot of the skill from gunfights.    Fast TTK is great for maps with lanes (CS:GO) because the skill contest still happens, not for open map shooters where you can get shot from nearly any angle.  In that case it removes many aspects of the skill contest (who has better aim, better burst firing, better recoil control etc).  That being said, fixing the TTK wouldn't bring me back.  The game is dead on PC."
BF_Hardline,3bap7t,DAGam3r,3,Mon Jun 29 02:36:20 2015 UTC,I'd definitely check that out. I'm one of those on PC who lost interest because of the lightning fast TTK/TTD.
BF_Hardline,3bap7t,BillyHoWCR,3,Sat Jun 27 19:23:43 2015 UTC,What makes you think it would bring anyone back? Sounds more like wishful thinking then anything.   The simple fact it would cause yet another divide among players in game is reason enough to count it out.
BF_Hardline,3bap7t,BillyHoWCR,0,Sat Jun 27 12:44:48 2015 UTC,Many people on PC just quit because you die almost instantly  Don't forget its a lot easier to aim accurate and control recoil here.

I only say this because ive been switching back and forth from hardline to BF4 and the ttk is almost the same, but recoil in bf4 makes it harder and the netcode in bf4 also prevents you from getting what is called the ""peak advantage"", meaning if you are aimed down towards a door per say, they wont have the advantage when coming through it like they did in newly released BF4 and Hardline now."

BF_Hardline,3b8i7o,YoFace-,9,Fri Jun 26 21:03:19 2015 UTC,"NO, with ZERO deaths? highly unlikely being infantry.  edit: would be interested to see your gameplay if you are going 100+/0 on an infantry game without cheating."

BF_Hardline,3b8i7o,SkimSTi,-1,Fri Jun 26 22:17:57 2015 UTC,No but its the same thing. If I could take as much damage as a chopper and fly away to repair I could easily go 100 and 0. Its bot impossible by any means. In bf3 I could go 70-0 on noshar and I was nowhere close to the best.

BF_Hardline,3b6ojd,DarthPneumono,5,Fri Jun 26 16:19:31 2015 UTC,"Forgetting the Titanfall Season Pass, are we? That boosted the number of players by a lot and ""saved"" the game."
BF_Hardline,3b6ojd,cobrareaper,2,Fri Jun 26 18:55:32 2015 UTC,"See you say that, but more often than not the DLC playlists were empty, and people buying the Season Pass were getting it for 10 or 15 bucks. And besides, that was Respawn's call, not EA's. They're not an EA studio."
BF_Hardline,3b6ojd,DarthPneumono,3,Fri Jun 26 21:18:30 2015 UTC,"Shit, forgot Respawn wasn't owned by EA. Still though, it did bump Titanfall's popularity up. Maybe EA can learn a thing or two from Respawn's decision. They have proved that they are willing to somewhat listen to their customers (On the House games, great customer service, game discounts, etc.). From their recent behavior it looks like they still value the PC platform (whereas a lot of other companies would just not develop a new game for PC if the old one didn't sell well on that system). Just being hopeful."
BF_Hardline,3b6ojd,cobrareaper,1 point,Fri Jun 26 21:38:07 2015 UTC,"It seems to me EA is doing the bare minimum to not have people hate them. Giving away old and by name unprofitable games is a great way to have people overlook the shit they do. Discounts on games is one thing, but they stand to make more money by doing that, especially with things like Battlefield, where the game is only a fraction of the real cost of playing. Everything is calculated to make money (as it should be, they're a business) but there comes a point where people need to stop buying in if they want to see any change."
BF_Hardline,3b6ojd,DarthPneumono,-1,Fri Jun 26 21:43:46 2015 UTC,"Well actually getting people to stop buying their games is near impossible. Even if everyone on all of the gaming subs stopped buying EA's games, the impact would be very small since the gaming subs make up a fraction of Battlefield's community. I too wish that EA would change for the better (they've taken steps; it's not a big change yet but at least they're acknowledging their mistakes), but that time won't come soon even if we boycotted them."
BF_Hardline,3b6ojd,cobrareaper,0,Fri Jun 26 21:47:03 2015 UTC,"Oh I'm well aware.

It's annoying as hell, but people don't know how to not buy stuff, even when it's shit."
BF_Hardline,3b6ojd,DarthPneumono,2,Fri Jun 26 22:42:23 2015 UTC,That game was almost dead on every system. Hardline is dead on one.
BF_Hardline,3b6ojd,CraziBoi94,2,Sat Jun 27 22:41:36 2015 UTC,EA gave away BF3 for free and that's probably responsible for why I play Battlefield. They also give away free games on Origin roughly every 3 months.
BF_Hardline,3b6ojd,postbroadcast,4,Fri Jun 26 17:15:30 2015 UTC,DLC for Garden warfare was free and GW2 will do the same
BF_Hardline,3b6ojd,haXona,0,Fri Jun 26 17:52:55 2015 UTC,Yes but you'll notice that in every case it's either an old game or (in the case of BF3) something specifically calculated to make them more money (by getting people interested in BF4). No way in hell they'll give out $50 bucks worth of DLC for a game that's less than 6 months old that's already been a financial disaster for them. They have no reason or obligation to.
BF_Hardline,3b6ojd,DarthPneumono,18,Fri Jun 26 17:26:07 2015 UTC,"But what about the premium players,"
BF_Hardline,3b6ojd,DANNYonPC,16,Fri Jun 26 12:25:36 2015 UTC,"i agree with you, and i don't even have premium. i think there is a fine line between justified bitterness about these problems and 'weaseling' visceral. some people might be crossing that line. visceral is a business, not our friends. so treat it like any other business transaction: if you don't like the services they provide, don't give them your money in the future. at this point, it's a sunk cost. take it as a lesson learned and move on like you would if you got scammed by a car shop. if you feel you got ripped off by the mechanic, never go back there again - but you're not going to get your money back and you're not entitled to anything. it's the risk of having good faith and doing business."
BF_Hardline,3b6ojd,fanciestmango,1 point,Fri Jun 26 13:54:33 2015 UTC,Your opinion is quite valid for closed transactions- but thesse guys want us to pay more to keep playing and you as a player base should be wanting players to come and if the only way to draw players to their shitbox of a game is to give it away you should be happy as you might get a few hundred people back to play this game. These games are about ongoing purchases and ongoing involvement which is more of a relationship that must be maintained across a large distribution of players (customers) - lest the whole shit fall apart (like this shitbox).
BF_Hardline,3b6ojd,fletch420man,3,Fri Jun 26 17:20:06 2015 UTC,"Which is exactly why the base game should be kept inexpensive and Premium the same cost. It lowers the entry barrier and would get people who wouldn't try the game otherwise. Once you get people who constantly just hear that the game is shit to try it out and realize it's actually pretty good, that's when you hook, line, and sinker into picking up Premium. You can't sell premium without the base game purchased."
BF_Hardline,3b6ojd,tyler2k,2,Fri Jun 26 17:42:58 2015 UTC,"No problem man but I disagree completely, No new players are coming for this game, the only chance you have is to try and draw some players back that already blew money on the base game. And additionally the game is not that good, the balance is shit, there are broken mechanics galore along with a slew of things one could bitch about, sure it has some fun qualities (more like a coin op game from yesteryear), but not much to hold a player base. I understand you want to try and hold onto some value for YOUR purchase, but unless they incentivize those of us that feel ripped of with this release the PC player base will be so low by winter the game could be shutdown, but only on PC as it is holding it's own on soles, but sole folks say that's due to lack of titles- we shall see. Cheers man."
BF_Hardline,3b6ojd,fletch420man,5,Fri Jun 26 17:52:13 2015 UTC,"I would be happy with everyone getting the maps free (maybe only people who own the base game up to this date) and premium can have the other features like guns, gadgets and the so-called gun-bench. All I know is that so far on the new maps, I keep seeing the same players. And come 2am in Europe it's back to vanilla maps."
BF_Hardline,3b6ojd,galaxion,1 point,Fri Jun 26 15:29:25 2015 UTC,I would be ok with the first DLC to go for free but after that my premium is worthless since the main reason behind it is the DLC bundle.

BF_Hardline,3b6ojd,redroverdover,1 point,Sat Jun 27 20:38:17 2015 UTC,"Premium gets its value out of the DLC, all other features are just nice extra's   (Considering premium is 50 and all maps together is 60 4x15)"
BF_Hardline,3b6ojd,DANNYonPC,3,Fri Jun 26 15:31:06 2015 UTC,"Maybe I'm just being selfish to a point, but when the player base for DLC dies, these maps will not be played again. That makes me very sad and disappointed."
BF_Hardline,3b6ojd,galaxion,2,Fri Jun 26 15:33:24 2015 UTC,"I think PS4 players are still having issues with their DLC not working, so I'll be interested to see what Visceral does with that. As a non-premium player, I can still purchase and use the new guns. I could see how Premium players are frustrated with this particular DLC but as you said, there will be a few more maps and probably more guns/premium events down the road."

BF_Hardline,3b6ojd,thehappycloud,1 point,Fri Jun 26 20:11:01 2015 UTC,Fuck fair. Stop being so short sighted. Premium for HL is worth nothing right now. You made an investment and it failed. So now to revive the game you give it away for free. That is how investments work. To give yourself value you need to drum up interest.

BF_Hardline,3b6ojd,godisevol,1 point,Sun Jun 28 00:28:41 2015 UTC,"Nope, it was Comcast and for all of the shit people give EA they really aren't that bad. That's mainly gamers being angry about a stupid video game. EA is not worse than Bank of America, who fund far right wings militias in South America and have been for decades. EA is not worse than Haliburton, who are war profiteers.  EA isn't at fault here. It's Visceral; just like it was DICE's fault when BF4 was a fuck up. Not an EA apologist, as I really don't care, but Visceral fucked up and dropped customer support of their product.   All of that being said, I wouldn't mind if they gave away Premium as long as us suckers who paid for it are compensated with a voucher for a title of equal value."

BF_Hardline,3b6ojd,fletch420man,1 point,Fri Jun 26 19:34:59 2015 UTC,It wouldn't anger me. I'd rather have more players and a chance that the game would survive beyond the first DLC.
BF_Hardline,3b6ojd,Jamezlap,-1,Fri Jun 26 20:34:38 2015 UTC,Good point!  Although jumping on premium and paying up front for maps for this game may have been a bad decision anyways.
BF_Hardline,3b6ojd,RTViper62,1 point,Fri Jun 26 19:50:18 2015 UTC,agreed
BF_Hardline,3b6ojd,IlyichValken,0,Sun Jun 28 00:33:55 2015 UTC,"They should definitely give the DLC away for free and here is why:  THey have a pretty close to dead game.  Selling DLC will just recoup some money. Giving away the DLC will revive the game and help bring in new players. I would argue they should do ALL DLC for free this entire year to build a player base.   The problem with games nowadays is they expect to follow the same exact model of release game sell DLC bit by bit without really caring about whether it will help the player base grow or not.  In the long run, its better if they get more played hooked on HL over the summer for free than do this paid DLC because come fall ZERO people will be playing it and there will be no need for a HL2.   So if they want it to ever have a chance, they need to bite the bullet. So because that wont happen, RIP HL. There is no reason to invest any more money in this game as a player if they won't invest in us AS players."

BF_Hardline,3b870d,guaponese,3,Fri Jun 26 19:22:28 2015 UTC,"both have +/-'s...  SG510 feels a little weaker, but is a little bit easier to control. FAL is the opposite. strong and difficult to control... both are great when used in the right situations. both can be horrible when used incorrectly. the answer of which one is 'better' is going to be opinion based. what works for X person won't work for Y person. that being said, i like the FAL better."
BF_Hardline,3b870d,SkimSTi,2,Fri Jun 26 19:49:34 2015 UTC,I can't argue with SkimSTi's logic but for me it's simpler: The FAL is easily the better gun (my opinion).
BF_Hardline,3b870d,FalconiiLV,2,Fri Jun 26 20:36:21 2015 UTC,"Like the other posters in the thread, currently saving for the 10 million but when I picked up the FAL in the field, got a pretty good 5.8 KPM with it.

BF_Hardline,3b870d,tyler2k,3,Fri Jun 26 21:41:37 2015 UTC,PC - easier on recoil control with a mouse... i am on console and its fairly difficult. lol. or i just suck...
BF_Hardline,3b870d,SkimSTi,2,Fri Jun 26 21:51:53 2015 UTC,"Not just that, its ADS spread is the lowest in its class and its recoil decrease is also the best in class. The gun is just damn accurate, especially in bursts. Combined with its ROF and damage potential, of the BRs in general, the gun is stupid good.  Since you're on console you could probably get away with L/R taping to quickly kill anything."
BF_Hardline,3b870d,tyler2k,2,Fri Jun 26 22:04:45 2015 UTC,"i use all techniques pending the situation. auto, burst, tap, and even single shot in extreme cases. either way, even on console, once you learn to control the recoil its a damn beast (FAL)."

BF_Hardline,3b870d,SkimSTi,2,Fri Jun 26 21:12:30 2015 UTC,What about the FAL vs the SA-58 OSW? Aren't they suppose to be very similar guns?
BF_Hardline,3b870d,Typical_Ratheist,1 point,Fri Jun 26 21:54:25 2015 UTC,"pretty similar if i recall correctly. but the 58 still feels more controllable to me, especially at range. again im on console.

BF_Hardline,3b42lc,galaxion,6,Fri Jun 26 03:14:22 2015 UTC,Things like this for DLC purchasers makes this game even more unfair. It's a real shame it's further unbalancing the game and in my favourite mode too.  I have been using this toolkit and I've noticed players on regular maps commenting that I should be taking more money - Little do they realised I've just fully loaded in 3-4 seconds.  This is another case of 'WTF were they thinking?!'
BF_Hardline,3b42lc,galaxion,2,Fri Jun 26 03:11:18 2015 UTC,"The Toolkit and AP ammo really make me wonder if this DLC is definitively pay-to-win, or just dangerously close/badly thought out.

BF_Hardline,3b42lc,K-26,4,Fri Jun 26 06:42:07 2015 UTC,That thing seems like an unneeded addition to Hardline that's going to completely screw up the balance of Blood Money.
BF_Hardline,3b42lc,Typical_Ratheist,2,Fri Jun 26 01:27:51 2015 UTC,Its fine as you need to sacrifice one gadget slot. Its bad as it is premium only. They can balance it by making it slightly slower yet not beyond any usability (BF4 style).
BF_Hardline,3b42lc,nightbass,4,Sat Jun 27 13:43:06 2015 UTC,What is the tactical toolkit? Is it CA only?
BF_Hardline,3b42lc,LegitCyborg,3,Thu Jun 25 20:34:11 2015 UTC,Special gloves for enforcer that makes it faster to take money or plant charges in heist etc.

Meanwhile the other team has captured 1/2-3/4s of the objectives and now they are going around killing..or guarding objectives.  I get stuck with the team that loses..

BF_Hardline,3b4dx9,OneShot77Kills,3,Thu Jun 25 21:40:07 2015 UTC,"Actually the Syndicate weapons all fit a specific niche (except for the 300 who's niche is to just one-shot things evidently). The double barreled is an all-in melee weapon, you either win or you lose. The ARM is a high capacity AR that's highly controllable allowing for strong flanks. The FMG9 is an all-around performing SMG that doesn't suffer at range like the faster ROF SMGs. The 300 Knockout is an OHK weapon with poor bullet speed, making it more of a shotgun than a sniper.  IMO the only one that's remotely OP is the Knockout because as long as you know how to adjust range, it still can be used as a sniper rifle. It's a shame the only class that can prevent the OHK is the Mechanic but at the same time with most of the SMGs, it's a melee range class anyway, so once again it covers a niche."
BF_Hardline,3b4dx9,tyler2k,0,Thu Jun 25 21:51:40 2015 UTC,"I think the double barrel's OHK range does not reflect what it normally does in games, its so far that as long as you dont miss hard everything in that direction will die. The ARM is the only one I see as balanced, the FMG9 outclasses every other smg just look at everyone who has it, they only use that."
BF_Hardline,3b4dx9,tyler2k,3,Thu Jun 25 22:05:03 2015 UTC,"I tried using the Double Barrel when I unlocked it originally thinking it was easy mode and it wasn't as easy as I thought it was going to be. At about 10m I'd ADS and not hit OHks, maybe I just don't know how to use it but I will be leveling it to at least 500 for the new mask and I hope to get a better grasp on it, but so far what I've used of it has been painful.  While the FMG9 is really good, it definitely doesn't outclass all the other SMGs, the K10 is still incredibly strong and the MPX is still decent. What it does well is that it's readily available to the Criminals and doesn't have any glaring weaknesses. I literally only see K10 and MPX on PC, although it's obviously possible this is not the case on consoles."
BF_Hardline,3b4dx9,Nikotiiniko,3,Thu Jun 25 22:24:29 2015 UTC,"The double barrel is really only usable in rescue. You'd get much more use out of any other shotgun in other modes. 2 shots is way too few for single shotting and double shotting obviously only kills one guy. Which is fine in rescue as you usually face only 1 enemy at a time but it just doesn't work in heist etc. But it does work amazingly in rescue, I'll give you that. It's the close range king. Even K10 and Mac 10 weep when facing the double banger.  How is the FMG9 better than other smgs? It has the lowest damage out of all smgs. The closest one is P90 with 8 more damage and 50 less rounds per minute. It's a middle level smg imo. Not great, not bad.  Knockout is very situational. The OHK range is 50 meters, which is long, but I find it pretty difficult to use even at that range. The suppressor makes the bullets drop like rocks and they fly so slow you have to lead running targets by a lot. The worst sniper beyond 50 meters. I would say this is also best suited for rescue as the maps are very small and you generally need to kill single targets.  ARM is balanced.  Mac 10 is OP imo.  Beagle is great but balanced. Outclasses the other enfo sidearms, especially with the idiotic patch.  Jury is the worst side arm.  G18 is pretty good. Outclasses other operator sidearms, especially with the idiotic patch."

BF_Hardline,3b4dx9,fanciestmango,1 point,Fri Jun 26 23:01:06 2015 UTC,"i disagree. as 'top tier' weapons that take a good amount of effort/time to unlock, they should have a little more 'oomph' to them than the basic purchasable weapons. the .300 knockout does what it does -- we all know that; i really like the ARM, especially with the 50 round mag; the double-barrel shotgun is a wrecking machine, at least in my experience; and the fmg-9 is crisp and powerful. to me, all these weapons do what they are supposed to do, which makes them balanced in my opinion."
BF_Hardline,3b4dx9,FalconiiLV,2,Thu Jun 25 21:48:18 2015 UTC,"You just said that they are all better than the other weapons? Isnt that the definition of ""unbalanced""?"
BF_Hardline,3b4dx9,fanciestmango,2,Thu Jun 25 22:00:23 2015 UTC,"They are better in some ways, worse in other ways. That makes them balanced. Using the double-barrel, as an example: It can wreck things if you fire both barrels at once. However, if you miss your target you are dead because it takes an atrociously long time to reload it. Knockout is good up close but suffers a bit at range due to the low muzzle velocity and bullet drop. Etc, etc."
BF_Hardline,3b4dx9,SkimSTi,1 point,Thu Jun 25 23:03:44 2015 UTC,"yes, they are better -- but that is the balance. if they were the same as the base weapons, then the effort to get them would be disproportionate to their effectiveness. in turn, that would make them unbalanced."

BF_Hardline,3b36oe,jrlionheart00,1 point,Thu Jun 25 16:54:37 2015 UTC,"I bought Battlefield hardline a few weeks ago after playing the beta. I am really enjoying it, because it is nice change of pace from bf4, especially since I've hated the last 2 call of duty games.  It depends on the type of game you like. Bf4 has the obvious large maps, vehicles, war like battlegrounds; where hardline is a battlefield/call of duty mix. It's very fast paced, vehicles are pretty useless (imo), but the unique game modes are a lot of fun."
BF_Hardline,3b36oe,CodCutter0526,1 point,Thu Jun 25 16:49:33 2015 UTC,"You'll get a wide variety of opinions. The PC population is pretty low on Hardline, unfortunately. You probably have 10 times more people playing BF4. However, not many of those are playing the BF4 DLC maps.  I went to the BF4 server browser and searched for DLC-only in North America. I came up with 5 populated servers, two of which are running Metro meat grinders. I get about the same number of servers searching Hardline. Granted, it's a weekday morning so numbers are expected to be low at this time of day.  I like Hardline. It is different in many ways, but it still has the same engine and game mechanics as BF4. If Hardline does die on PC I'll play more BF4 but for now I'm playing Hardline."
BF_Hardline,3b36oe,FalconiiLV,1 point,Thu Jun 25 16:56:32 2015 UTC,"Get premium for bf4 for all the dlc. At this point it's a way better value with tons of guns, maps, and assignments. Also it's usually heavily discounted if you find the right place. Also hardline gets stale very quick with just the base game. There just isnt that much content."

The game is dead on PC, and it's nothing like a true Battlefield game anyway. You'll get bored of the 3 viable weapons and the maps within a few weeks on Hardline. BF4 is much more replayable and enjoyable."
BF_Hardline,3ayqtj,SilverbackRekt,27,Wed Jun 24 16:04:43 2015 UTC,How about stealing squad leader? I'm amazed at how many people don't use it to mark objectives. It's free points for everyone. Even on Blood Money I usually start off with a leader not using it. Pick one of the 3 damn objectives and you're bound to get some bonus points eventually.
BF_Hardline,3ayqtj,gardenlevel,7,Wed Jun 24 19:44:00 2015 UTC,"forgot about this one! this is def note worthy. i always play a good leader. and its friggin rare that people actually lead on this game. out of a hundred games, id say mayyybe 2-3 times there is a leader that actually gives legit orders and makes the squad some points."
BF_Hardline,3ayqtj,SkimSTi,3,Wed Jun 24 20:18:27 2015 UTC,"This is a huge one. On a related note, the only thing I don't like about being the squad leader is that it is too easy to set an objective when just trying to spot enemies. I would like to see it changed so you have to be ADS and pointing right at the objective to set it. Others may disagree..."
BF_Hardline,3ayqtj,FalconiiLV,3,Wed Jun 24 23:43:45 2015 UTC,In bf4 there was a setting that only allowed you to set objectives with the quick chat menu so you don't accidentally change it. I forgot until now about it I'll check when I get home if it is in BFH.  Edit: I wasn't able to find the option. :(

BF_Hardline,3ayqtj,brittonberkan,6,Wed Jun 24 23:27:10 2015 UTC,One of the most enjoyable games I have ever played.  I don't get all the hate and I never will.  I avoided the game at first but thankfully I grabbed a copy a month after release and I have never looked back.    All of my buddies joined me in the mayhem and have been having a blast as well.  I honestly can't wait until we get a true successor to 1942 with ships and all but I think Visceral did a decent job!
BF_Hardline,3ayqtj,staticthreat,12,Thu Jun 25 09:12:03 2015 UTC,that just about sums it up. They did well with the game in my opinion. All of these things you mentioned make it enjoyable. the gun audio is also awesome! i still think the UZI is my fav sounding weapon (followed by the HCAR at a close 2nd - thud thud thud thud)
BF_Hardline,3ayqtj,SkimSTi,5,Wed Jun 24 16:36:51 2015 UTC,HCAR is my most used weapon. At range it kills in 3-4 shots. Has heavy recoil so I use canted ironsights for close quarters and it usually kills in 2-3 shots up close.
BF_Hardline,3ayqtj,SkimSTi,2,Wed Jun 24 16:55:05 2015 UTC,yeaaa man. i weapon licensed it as soon as they fixed the absurd recoil. fun gun to use for sure. havent used it in awhile though since im working on WLing a few others now.
BF_Hardline,3ayqtj,SkimSTi,3,Wed Jun 24 16:56:48 2015 UTC,"great post btw, need more shit like this in here. sucks to always read about the same 3 complaints all day, every day."
BF_Hardline,3ayqtj,ToeTacTic,2,Wed Jun 24 16:57:26 2015 UTC,How do you get the weaopn license for guns and what do you do with the license?
BF_Hardline,3ayqtj,SkimSTi,3,Wed Jun 24 17:37:05 2015 UTC,1250 kills for each gun. they let you use them on cops and criminal sides instead of just one side.
BF_Hardline,3ayqtj,DAROCK2300,2,Wed Jun 24 17:41:46 2015 UTC,"Doesn't this defeat the purpose of - ""Faction sided weapons"" Makes the game feel like you're actually playing against another enemy that's uniquely different than you."""
BF_Hardline,3ayqtj,SkimSTi,2,Thu Jun 25 03:19:28 2015 UTC,"in a way, sure, but it takes quite a long time to grind out 1250 kills (and i feel its good to leave the number high, many complain it should be 500 or so, which is stupid IMO). the reward for grinding out that many kills is being able to use it as much as you want. good reward."
BF_Hardline,3ayqtj,P33KAJ3W,2,Thu Jun 25 16:41:04 2015 UTC,ARM sounds makes me happy.
BF_Hardline,3ayqtj,PoppaDR3W,9,Thu Jun 25 16:46:42 2015 UTC,"I love the game. It's a nice mix of close quarters action and long range. I dislike a few things like the way the vehicles feel and how the fire sometimes kills yoy despite not standing in flames, but the game overall is pretty damn good. It feels good, the game modes are fun and addictive, the idea of cops versus criminals is a fresh idea, etc."

Downtown LA looks like downtown!   I also like the reduced vehicle combat. There are enough things to mess around with, but action is mostly dude-on-dude.

BF_Hardline,3ayqtj,BigToeHamster,6,Thu Jun 25 02:28:45 2015 UTC,Smoke has certain physics to it. If you throw a smoke grenade and a helicopter flies over it the smoke goes away. I thought this was the coolest thing in the game even though it barely matters.

BF_Hardline,3ayqtj,DarkISO,5,Wed Jun 24 18:25:52 2015 UTC,"I've been loving hardline recently. The new patch is great. The movement and gunplay feels much tighter than BF4. The close quarters combat is excellent, and the different gadgets/guns/reps for each class makes for interesting team play. Hotwire is also a ton of fun and different from typical conquest. Heist and blood money are great modes as well that promote team play. I stopped playing for 1-2 months but gave it another chance after the last patch, and I've been LOVING this game recently. Might even buy premium at the moment. It's a nice breath of fresh air and fast gameplay.    It really disappoints me to see so much negative, hateful words towards Visceral from the PC player base. I am a PC player as well. If you don't like the game, don't play it!! No reason to shit on the devs for not catering to every fucking little thing you want. They put the money, time, and resources into this game. This community acts like entitled selfish pricks quite often, and it's sad to see.

BF_Hardline,3ayqtj,DANNYonPC,2,Thu Jun 25 04:39:52 2015 UTC,"Something I personally disagree with is being able to use the interact key to take ammo/health from fellow Assault/Support players.  Many people see it as a benefit, but Battlefield has always been about teamwork. Being able to take it yourself kind of takes away the teamwork. Sure, they still have to be there, but that's it; you aren't relying on teammates to continuously help and support you. I hope this is something that only stays in some of the spinoff games.  Anyways, it's a shame that this game received so much hate. I thought the 2nd beta was a huge improvement over the 1st beta and I was planning to pick it up a few months after release so that I could try it without as many bugs, with better balancing, and for less money ($60 was a little overboard). Unfortunately, it seems the game is pretty much dead on PC, and only 2 months after release. I heard there are like 2 full servers, one of which is running The Block on 64 players. Is that true?"

It has turned the tide in so many blood money matches by simply driving to the enemy's vault and having wave after wave of teammates hit it.   Not having launchers as part of your load out was a huge plus for me. Prevents flying from catering solely to the elite.   Love the ability to pick my perks, just wish there were more choices.

The maps have personality in the sense that they actually feel like they can exist (planes fly overhead, there's basically NPC vehicles that make the world feel more populated, birds in the world, etc.) while the BF4 world feels secluded and more like an actual map. The weapon imbalance, despite how much I hate it, does make the guns feel unique. For instance, I'd play MP5k totally differently than the FMG9."

The whole time BF4 wasn't working properly, I was unhappy, and it was a coin toss between playing COD:Ghosts or Battlefield 4. (I play on Xone. It was seriously between those two choices)  I enjoyed the Battlefield community better than Battlefield 4 itself. And COD's community is a bunch of raunchy bastards. And Ghosts was horrible.  So I stuck with BF4 and the community rather than the game itself. Battlefield 4 was my first Battlefield title, comming from COD (which I now can't stand) and have since purchased BF3 BF:BC2 (and BF2 on my PC before it sadly soon after crashed.)  So, I already had the Battlefield Community (a breath of fresh air from COD's), and a polished Battlefield 4, which I hear is getting a vehicle pollish in the CTE here soon. So although they're still polishing things with BF4. They game could have been released in the state that it's currently in, and the community would have accepted it as fine.   Battlefield Hardline... it had a stable release, which is nice. Yes they had some innovative ideas, but none of that inovation matters if the netcode and hit registration causes 1/3 of the player base to abandon the game (PC players) And I feel like I'm walking into a time portal when playing Hardline... with bad hit registration and netcode (I understand its improved, but it doesn't compete with the state BF4 is currently in).  Not only that, the problems with BF4 created a new form of update development with the use of a CTE. Which lead to the creation of DICE LA. (Which seems to be the most competent out of the three companies working on the Battlefield franchise).  But regardless of Hardline's stable release, none of that is relivant if technical issues arrise with a subsiquent update that causes instability for many which causes your platform to crash while playing the game. That's what I'd consider to be ""going backward"".  People, even I, were expecting more out of the gun ballance. And instead of getting closer to a well rounded ballance, (as Dice LA hase managed to do with each ballance update) because what we see in this most recent update is a weapon ballance that's WORSE than the release's ballance.   MarbleDuck on youtube has a video series explaining this stuff far better than I could. Not only that, he suggested a mathematical equasion that Viceral could work with in order to ballance the weapons in Hardline. I've tinkered with the equasion on paper and I tend to agree with each and every point MarbleDuck makes in that video series. Yet Viceral snubbed him off and has continued to ballance the weapons based on arbitrary feeling... as weapons are typically ballanced that way with campaign oriented games... NOT multiplayer games.  As a result, I find my experience with Hardline to be less than fulfilling, knowing all the while I can pop in Battlefield 4 and have a much better polished experience.  I look forward to Hardline's development. I wish it was ballanced on release, but unless Viceral follows some sort of model they're not going to ever ballance these guns.  (By model, I mean the same meathod as other online development techniques. Specifically towards gun ballance needing to be based on some type of mathematicad equasion. Other companies in other industies follow a universal model. At fast food joints you know where to order upon entering through the door and the layout tends to be universal so that you know exactly where to fill and refill your drink, where the restroom is and where the lobby is, as it's usually a wide open room for ordering, drinks, and sitting. If a retail (not corporate) McDonalds chain popped up and they designed their buildings where the drinks are near the door in its own room, ordering requires you looking through several rooms to find the place and the lobby was in a room behind the kitchen intsead of in front, then that chain wouldn't get much business. There's an established model THERE. And there's an established model HERE with weapon ballance).  And I also don't have to deal with as many little kids playing BF4. Nothing wrong with kids playing Battlefield, but I swear to god... for some reason every time I play Hardline some little kid tells me to stop ""cussing""... as if they can tell me how I can speak in my own house... (Not that this point has anything to do with Viceral. Just the experience.) So I find myself switching squads or teams more often on Hardline when compared to BF4.  Hope that clears things up a bit. I hope you understand I'm being civil, but there's really no reason to praise a product that is yet again ""faulty until further nottice""."

If you can't get headshots with Scout then .300 is going to be less useful to you with the slow rounds. The point of the Assignment is to teach you to use Sniper weapons.
BF_Hardline,3b3y5x,Troy_Davis,2,Fri Jun 26 04:15:10 2015 UTC,"And what about the dozen or so people I would see just spinning in their deadzone on Hotwire. Those people just magically rack up points for spinning? Boosting is all around. If boosting was such an issue, go complain to makers of the game to figure out ways to not allow boosting. I boost because I can and want to for certain unlocks. I play normal, I just needed help with headshots. Jesus what a backlash."
BF_Hardline,3b3y5x,B-Live,1 point,Fri Jun 26 13:32:24 2015 UTC,"And what about the dozen or so people I would see just spinning in their deadzone on Hotwire.   Deadzones on Hotwire are just that... zones where you die easy. Hotwire vehicles can only last so long in the area. Even ramming into a vehicle in the deadzone can cause it to not be able to make it out of the deadzone and blow up. People do not spin in the deadzones. Just doesn't happen, and if it was a thing it would be so easy to destroy said vehicles.   Hotwire maps are not that large. Killing hotwire vehicles is already an easy task. and the fact any hotwire cars being driven to avoid being killed is actually part of the gameplay, not a boosting method.  Stop trying to justify your boosting... it is just making you look that much more ignorant.   And what does any of that have to do with the fact sniping portion of the assignment is meant to teach you to be a better sniper?    Edit: or are you talking of players using the Hotwire glitch (which has since been patched) where you could kill your self and then sit in spawn to earn points? As we know that has been identified by Devs as cheating and removed with the patch. What does another way of boosting have anything to do with accepting your way of boosting? They are all wrong."

BF_Hardline,3b3y5x,iDesolate,2,Thu Jun 25 21:11:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah I'm late to the post but figured i would throw my 2 cents in. If you play conquest on dustbowl go up on either of the hillsides and snipe, each flag is between 200 and 300 meters away. so dial in the scope to 200 or 300 meters, if you get someone on the opposite hill (which will eventually happen) its about 550 meters so set the scope to 500 meters and aim a few of reticles above the target. If youre base is furthest away from the water tower and you are on the hill its about 450 meters. If you scope over the flag markers it will give you the distance to the flag so if it says 300 meter that gives you a good starting point instead of guessing the distance."
BF_Hardline,3b3y5x,iDesolate,2,Thu Jul 2 19:29:33 2015 UTC,"Once again, you don't have to get a 250m headshot. You only need to get headshots that add up to 250m."

They even showed on the pc I didn't order deluxe....gamestop employees for ya) anyways. Yes my friend and I both have the regular edition his browser works mine nothing...

The announcement of those features were what you can expect from Premium, they gave a big heads up on what we'll be getting in the future DLC updates. People are wanting all these features within the first couple months..  And yeah I'm sure they would love to say ""Expect it soon"" but if a problem comes up and have to keep working on it, people would be upset.

BF_Hardline,3b0gyj,rippedsteel,2,Wed Jun 24 23:50:14 2015 UTC,There was a rumor before BF4 was released that it would not only have dynamic weather but it would be real time. Most if not all BF4 maps are real places and the idea was that if it was raining there it would rain on the map. I don't think this was ever implemented though. Although I don't think BFH maps are real places many have obvious locations. Everglades comes to mind. It would be cool if they could integrate real time weather.
BF_Hardline,3b0gyj,cutlerf,1 point,Thu Jun 25 00:56:40 2015 UTC,Or just get the dlc working for everybody  before anything else
BF_Hardline,3b0gyj,zebbidy,1 point,Thu Jun 25 21:06:15 2015 UTC,Frostbite has serious problem with dynamic lights. Most of the lightning is statically mapped. This means that every setting yould need to be manually recreated. This means that it is impossible if you take into account how long it takes to even change few numbers -  weapon balance for example.

I've become really food with the chopper recently and it's really all I intend to play now, it's pretty annoying that there's few maps with an AA spawn, and then some of those only have ONE.

BF_Hardline,3aywpj,tyler2k,1 point,Wed Jun 24 21:29:16 2015 UTC,"Play Hotwire with at least a 50% rep boost, preferably use the Coupe as it's quick to accelerate and turn, not to mention a smaller target against RPGs. Also in my experience, Criminals have the safest Hotwire routes, so if possible play on their side.  Last trick I'd suggest is to use cameras and place the as well as they will also provide a small boost to your rep. Final piece of advice is that once you hit T4, especially if you're using a 100/200% rep boost, is to leave the server or change your class. It'll preserve your boost and still award the completion once the match ends."

However, the weapon changes are pretty weird. The L85A2 spread increase nerf is crazy. I don't necessarily blame Visceral. DICE has been working on gun balance for years. Also, many guns in BF4 were in BF3 and other BF titles so they have been working on specific gun's balance for a while. I just hope that similarly to the netcode DICE can help Visceral with gun balance.   Edit: forgot to mention this video was posted recently."

The major change this patch is that cameras now take priority over pretty much everything, making them easier to obtain.

BF_Hardline,3atsfn,BillyHoWCR,2,Tue Jun 23 13:41:13 2015 UTC,I just checked your Battlelog and it does not even show your PRE-REQUIREMENTS being complete on Battlelog. http://i.imgur.com/CrnShhl.png  Is it possible that your issue is not that the AWARD REQUIREMENTS are showing ??? in error but that your  PRE-REQUIREMENTS are showing completed in error in game?  Have you completed the  PRE-REQUIREMENTS?   Enforcer Assignment 2 10 Enforcer Specific Guns And/or Gadgets Purchased Unlock Enforcer Gold Service Star 1   If you have them complete... (and it looks to me like you do) then likely what you need to do is go into your game and play a few games and then check again afterwards. I had a similar issue with Battlelog not updating correctly after I earned my ELITE PLAYER SYNDICATE but in my case it showed portions complete on each part of Battlelog but others not. And I didn't get my unlocks. (your case seems a bit more premature in missing just the pre-requirement stuff)... what I found was log out of everything. Log back in and play a few games. See if it doesn't update for you?   Looks like you completed the final part of your pre-requirements about 4 hours prior to your post here. Possibly the log off and back on to play will hopefully resolve the issue?  Please relay back to us if it does in fact resolve your issue? (in case anyone else might experience something similar in the future)

BF_Hardline,3atsfn,BillyHoWCR,1 point,Tue Jun 23 13:47:28 2015 UTC,Yep... and Google should show you:  PRE-REQUIREMENTS   Enforcer Assignment 2 10 Enforcer Specific Guns And/or Gadgets Purchased Unlock Enforcer Gold Service Star 1   And then you should see the AWARD REQUIREMENTS as most every other player does that has worked towards Syndicate Assignments.
BF_Hardline,3atsfn,BillyHoWCR,-2,Tue Jun 23 16:05:13 2015 UTC,Yep... whom ever is supposed to work this aspect of the game is very bad at coding.   Has had issues on and off since game came out. And sometimes it just shows the description of the requirements but the quantity portion is just glitched out.   This happened pre-patch and still sometimes post patch. Where I will be looking at it just fine... but then scroll through the awards and soon it starts glitching out.
BF_Hardline,3atsfn,Visceral_TO,8,Tue Jun 23 16:26:54 2015 UTC,"It's not a bug, the requirements for the Syndicate Assignments are supposed to be hidden. They will appear as you fulfill the requirements."

You should be able to see the AWARD REQUIREMENTS just as the rest of us are seeing them. Either that or the rest of us should not be seeing them and we have all been seeing them wrong since game release and still currently compared to your screen."
BF_Hardline,3atsfn,Visceral_TO,-1,Tue Jun 23 15:11:45 2015 UTC,"The glitch I was talking about was when the quantity of the requirements don't show up at all. As seen here: https://imgur.com/a/L2Qqm  And unless things have changed then you are incorrect in this specific aspect of his too. As when you unlock the PRE-REQUIREMENTS then the AWARD REQUIREMENTS are then shown. Has always been the case. And even still so if you look at this image of my own Syndicate Assignment for CRIMINAL SYNDICATE where I have the PRE-REQUIREMENTS unlocked and it now shows the AWARD REQUIREMENTS. http://i.imgur.com/5LCorfY.png  And yes in game it shows me the same. So either mine is incorrect or his is, and seeing that mine has been the norm since game launch then his is likely in err.  Edit: and note that prior to yesterday when playing with my son. The Hotwire and Grenade portion of the requirements showed zero too."
BF_Hardline,3atsfn,BillyHoWCR,5,Tue Jun 23 15:15:02 2015 UTC,"I was pointing out how it was in OPs post, that is how it is supposed to be. The quantities not showing up for you is definitely a bug.  Both the prerequisites and the requirements are supposed to be hidden until you fulfill those requirements, you can kinda see it in action on picture 8 of your album. Looking at it at a glance though, it looks like all of the requirements are showing up after fulfilling the first one, rather than one by one like the prerequisites.  Also, this is only the case for Syndicate assignments. Requirements for the others should always show."

The vast majority of players will simply download origin and redeem their key via that. Selling on steam does not do anything to make the game better. I think it might increase sales by 1 or 2% but that is already pushing it. I'm not saying people won't prefer it to be on steam. It's just that origin isnt that big of a deal to make people not buy it altoghether.  Adding the fact that releasing on steam will DESTROY the origin platform and will be the same as admitting defeat."
BF_Hardline,3aydyr,FalconiiLV,2,Wed Jun 24 15:19:03 2015 UTC,For the most part I agree. However I know several people who flat out refuse to use Origin. It may be illogical but they stick to their convictions.

BF_Hardline,3aydyr,INFsleeper,-2,Wed Jun 24 15:55:33 2015 UTC,"50%? you got a source for that claim?    as for Steam vs. Origin. lets just google some poll results, shall we? because whatever i say are just fanboy words, right...    2013 - IGN Board: 150 Votes for Steam, 12 for Origin 2013 - Steam Unpowered (is this an ANTI Steam site?): Valve (1139 votes) vs. EA (79 votes) 2011 - Escapist Poll - ""Long live the king of distribution!

BF_Hardline,3augvw,megustoman,7,Tue Jun 23 16:37:10 2015 UTC,"It has the biggest community on all the platforms (by far), I'd hold off on Premium though - to be honest I'm still more inclined to play BF4 than Hardline which isn't to say Hardline isn't fun (it is) but it depends on my mood and whether I want the large scale of BF4 or the smaller tighter fights found in Hardline."

I'd say Hardline is worth it for sure, but it's so easy to pick up at Redbox if you've never played.

I would wager a decent sum on the community falling apart come November, as several new games will be emerging and drawing from the Hardline playerbase quite heavily. The game in enjoyable, but for those of us with 300+ hours, the new content just can't come quick enough. Obviously you wouldn't really have this problem for some time yet.  On premium... Maybe? I would just buy the individual packs, really, as chances are you will move on before they are all released; premium is pretty much for those so keen on new content that they are willing to spend more for early access (I'm assuming you wouldn't buy all packs individually)."

I don't play it consistently(day to day basis) but still enjoy it, the DLC offered new incentive to keep playing and grinding through new challenges for a pretty cool reward.

I bought both of the Destiny DLC's bundled; I wouldn't have bought the second had I bought the first individually, as by the time the second DLC dropped, I had zero interest in Destiny.   You are making the assumption that some DLC for a game will bring people back; if this were true, the question wouldn't be asked, as premium is a no-brainer for anyone who intends to buy all of the DLC.   Frankly, we have Battlefront coming out, Rainbow Six coming out, etc.   Hardline isn't an amazing enough game to keep its community, it isn't amazing enough for 4 new maps and some weapons for one class to systematically bring people back. Depending on their release schedule, there is a good chance you won't bother playing some of the DLC, and if you won't play it, why pay for it?"
BF_Hardline,3augvw,PraeteritaCautus,5,Wed Jun 24 20:25:32 2015 UTC,"The PlayStation 4 community is thriving.The game play is intense and addictive. if you have the money to spare premium is well worth it, the new maps are awesome. Ignore all these idiots yelling about gun balance and TTK and all that crap, Hardline is a flat-out shit load of fun to play, and that's all that really matters. Go get it and jump in the fun with the rest of us!"

BF_Hardline,3augvw,BarryMcCackiner,1 point,Tue Jun 23 23:17:40 2015 UTC,"agree with all the above. i actually like the low TTK and prefer it to the BF4 TTk. its a good balance between hardcore/regular modes. cuz it feels kinda like a hardcore game type (choose your game), but has the minimap benefits etc of regular mode. if that makes sense."
BF_Hardline,3augvw,SkimSTi,5,Tue Jun 23 23:20:08 2015 UTC,I would say buy hardline. But i cant say the same for premium. Just not worth the pricetag. If you gameshare or it goes on sell then thats another story but Visceral is doing a good job regardless of what other people may say.
BF_Hardline,3augvw,vgdomination,2,Tue Jun 23 17:35:19 2015 UTC,"I can still find decent servers in BC2 on the PS3, that should mean something."
BF_Hardline,3augvw,HexNiCoTiNe,0,Tue Jun 23 18:52:39 2015 UTC,Just buy base game. Premium is dead
BF_Hardline,3augvw,gho0strec0n,-2,Wed Jun 24 18:20:06 2015 UTC,Would not recommend. The player base is good on PS4 but the player base is steadily dropping and the peak is lower than BF4.  BF4 http://bf4stats.com/  BFH http://bfhstats.com/  The game also has balance issues but the more concerning part is the developers are still not able to balance the game properly after a few months  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgS4dU8szrY&feature=em-uploademail  This guy explains this well. Visceral does not have the experience to balance this game even with its limited amount of weapons.   In the end it's your choice to buy it but make sure you won't regret it later. I would definitely hold out on premium.
BF_Hardline,3augvw,qerunt1246,2,Wed Jun 24 00:02:16 2015 UTC,"The weapon balance isnt even that bad. Every class has OP weapons and weapons that suck. Medics are good medium to long range with quick reloads for the most part and a variety of different weapons that all offer different aspects. Engineer is a monster up close but awful anywhere else. Enforcer battle rifles are very powerful but slow rate of fire and small magazines. Professionals have 1 hit kill snipers and machine pistols for when things get hairy. I dont get where this unbalanced gun talk is coming from. Mac 10 is rediculous up close but what other guns are really that bad within there intended ranges? The balance is nice imo. Its gadgets like inserts that need adjusting and not a pay to win solution (tracer rounds). I see more variety in class selection and weapon selection than any other battlefield ive played and there are way less weapons. Not one gun except the scout elite 2 shot spam bothers me when i get killed. It seems to me that people just dont want to adapt to certain situations and keep fighting say assault rifles medium range with smgs. There is an answer for everything in this game. The different damage models of weapons keeps the game interesting. Although i agree enforcer sidearms and the spread on some weapons is stupid compared to other, there is also a lot less recoil in this game compared to other battlefield titles"
BF_Hardline,3awmat,DLyon27,4,Wed Jun 24 02:22:41 2015 UTC,"There is an automatic update, about 1gb for the base game. The DLC itself it a separate 3.7gb which you get by start-clicking hardline and going to the manage content tab. Once you have the DLC downloaded you need to find a server running it, and currently the server search is broken so make sure you have it set to show all maps and all game modes and you should see a few of the servers along with the rest. If you try searching for anything specific you probably won't find anything."

BF_Hardline,3aw1yz,ZeroBANG,1 point,Wed Jun 24 00:19:33 2015 UTC,"PC playerbase is getting smaller and smaller.   actually it seems pretty stable at 3600 ish players per day for a while now.    i followed the numbers a bit and i can tell the console numbers are dwindling as well... Xbox One started at over 50000 players and is down to 15000 now. PS4 started at over 80000 players and is down to 26000-ish now.    PC started with only 30000-ish players. In the time that PC lost 27k-ish players Xbox One lost 35k+ and PS4 lost over 50k players. (and the consoles did not have a GTA5 being released that dropped the numbers by 10000 in a week)    If that trend continues (the DLC seems to have slowed the fall momentarily, but didn't increase any numbers, thx to releasing it in the middle of E3 Trailer HYPE and releasing it in a broken state), all in all, by the time of the next DLC i predict that consoles may very well be struggling too.    Visceral really needs to pull out a game changer or Hardline will go where Medal of Honor already is."

BF3 and 4 are cheaper choices and way superior in every single way. If you already got those 2 and only want MORE Battlefield, then go ahead. If you don't have them yet, buy those 2 instead.    also keep in mind it is only 5 more months until Star Wars Battlefront.

Am wondering if this is a Premium only mission seeing that they are the only ones able to get the CA DLC currently?   Or are the Premium players actually working the entire mission for everyone to be able to collect?   Guess we will find out when it is complete and see if non-Premium players are able to collect the reward?  Oddly enough this mission doesn't have the same blurb that others did about playing the game mode/activity prior to collecting?

BF_Hardline,3atp2j,Resin_Smoker,4,Tue Jun 23 12:48:23 2015 UTC,I loved battlefield 4 and put in about 400 hours from its beginning. That being said I'm loving the feel of hardline. I've put in about 220 hours so far and the best parts I would say are:  1) lower time to kill 2) quicker movement 3) fast paced gameplay 4) more close quarters engagements 6) fast vehicles 7) new gamemodes like bloodmoney are awesome.   I'd say the game is much more fast paced and reaction time based. But realistic it is not. Bf4 was much more realistic.
BF_Hardline,3atp2j,SourceWebMD,2,Tue Jun 23 16:01:15 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry, but eating 7 bullets, turning around and headshotting me with a fucking Intervention with bullets whizzing past your head and then running off like nothing happened is by no means realistic. Setting wise BF4 is more realistic, gameplay wise - no way in hell."
BF_Hardline,3atp2j,megusta505,2,Tue Jun 23 16:31:09 2015 UTC,I mean it's obviously not ARMA but it's realistic enough to be a casual fun fps console shooter.
BF_Hardline,3atp2j,SourceWebMD,0,Tue Jun 23 16:47:16 2015 UTC,"How anyone could have anything positive to say about the vehicle mechanics in this game is pretty baffling to me.  Bloodmoney is good, but the other new gamemodes like Rescue or Crosshair are more or less unplayable, too."
BF_Hardline,3atp2j,nastylep,1 point,Tue Jun 23 17:01:44 2015 UTC,The vehicle mechanics are a little wonky at times but I have a lot of fun driving.

Kind of hated Hardline at first, because it was so different, but now that i have invested 230 hrs into the game i really enjoy it.   to the comment about it not being realistic, i feel with the lower TTK, it is a bit more realistic... pop your head out and you're done. it is much harder to escape bullet fire once you start getting hit. i personally like that. have to be more conscious of your surroundings and movements."
BF_Hardline,3atp2j,SkimSTi,2,Tue Jun 23 16:09:31 2015 UTC,"Bf hardline is 100% console game, if u didnt like bf4 because of that reason dont even try bf hardline.  Keep on playing bf3 you are not missing on anything, futher more i suggest you keep an eye on venice unleashed: http://veniceunleashed.net/  Its gonna make bf3 x10 time better."
BF_Hardline,3atp2j,olitae,4,Tue Jun 23 18:21:49 2015 UTC,"It's weird, you'd think BF4 was the greatest game ever for how much it's praised and how much shit BFH gets... all by the same people who wanted Dice to pay them for the ""bad"" BF4 launch."
BF_Hardline,3atp2j,Troy_Davis,4,Tue Jun 23 13:33:08 2015 UTC,"BF4 was from a technical point of view horrible at launch, but was relatively solid from a design/balance point of view. BFH is pretty much the inverse of that.  BF4 has since massively improved the technical side and continued to tweak the balance side of things (sometimes getting it wrong). So as it stands now it is a pretty solid title. BFH has sadly not shown much of an improvement in the areas where it is lacking.   That is probably why people praise BF4 so much. In addition BFH doesn't have the luxury of time to improve as the player count is tanking rapidly."
BF_Hardline,3atp2j,elfez,1 point,Tue Jun 23 16:40:20 2015 UTC,spot on- you can throw lack of game support in there too-
BF_Hardline,3atp2j,fletch420man,1 point,Tue Jun 23 22:31:05 2015 UTC,Exactly.  BF4 was a great game with a terrible infrastructure to support it at launch.  Hardline's problems are the opposite.

BF_Hardline,3asmv2,KITTvsKARR,-1,Tue Jun 23 17:24:57 2015 UTC,You know different Dice studios made BF3 and 4 right? Stockholm and then LA  Never said they were doing bad. A game is boring when all weapons are balanced anyways. You are repeating what I said with all due respect.
BF_Hardline,3asmv2,DarthPneumono,2,Tue Jun 23 09:04:07 2015 UTC,"Actually not true, 4 was also made in Sweden, then offloaded to DICE LA to take care of the the Stockholm branch could start on battlefront."

BF_Hardline,3asmv2,pp3001,3,Tue Jun 23 17:26:44 2015 UTC,Does it though?   Bf4 had a terrible start and was bugged for a long time.   When LA took over they started the CTE and listened to the customer base.   The maps in bf3 that people loved in the final expansion were made by LA.  It's going to be unpopular to say but it does seem like LA want to take more care over their projects than Sweden.  Would we still be getting more patches and maps if it was still at Sweden? ?
BF_Hardline,3asmv2,Troy_Davis,1 point,Tue Jun 23 19:23:30 2015 UTC,"True, but I figure the DICE subsidiaries have at least more communication (and they do share people) than Visceral and DICE LA did."

I think visceral did really well considering the circumstances they were under and the awful launch of BF4 that preceded Hardline and I still think they show motivation and passion to the game, which is awesome. I love to see that. I like how they interact with the community but sometimes its a bad thing too"
BF_Hardline,3asmv2,iDesolate,1 point,Tue Jun 23 17:22:53 2015 UTC,The problem was partly EA not giving them time and partly them not being familiar with this type of game. There's a lot of little balance issues that could have been easily fixed before launch (and definitely since) that just weren't. Visceral just isn't doing enough to keep the game going. One patch so far? Delayed DLC because it broke literally everything? That's not on EA anymore.
BF_Hardline,3asmv2,ElHugexx,-1,Tue Jun 23 20:24:56 2015 UTC,I like it alot too and i couldnt agree with you more. Theres more behind the scenes than we know though. Publishers are always pushing developers to do and release things they dont want to do. Cant say no to your boss. We'll probably never know why but yeah these changes should have came with the day 1 release. Its the same engine so i have no idea why they couldnt make this happen or still havnt. We have to keep in mind that Visceral is also new to this and they are busting there asses or so it seems. Theres a lot of pressure on them.
BF_Hardline,3asmv2,cadgers,5,Tue Jun 23 05:43:00 2015 UTC,PC has a lot more mature users that arent big on change or cartoony fps games.   You can't tell from the in-game chat though.

BF_Hardline,3ar9nh,Ipad207,8,Mon Jun 22 21:33:30 2015 UTC,"Learning the maps is the easiest way to get better. Get a feel for the flow, learn popular camping spots, learn the shortcuts to getting around quickly. That covers probably 80% of the game since the gunplay has been made easier."

BF_Hardline,3ar9nh,RuthlessDickTater,5,Mon Jun 22 23:04:45 2015 UTC,I want to learn how to fly a helicopter without getting in people's ways
BF_Hardline,3ar9nh,RuthlessDickTater,6,Mon Jun 22 23:06:50 2015 UTC,"I want to learn how to fly a helicopter without getting in people's ways   God bless you OP. I wish there were more players like you, haha.  Like others have said, go to server browser and find empty servers (or even 10 people) and practice flying helos there.  What guns / classes are your ""go-tos""? Hell, what optics do you use on your guns? That might help with recommendations.  If you want to survive more, follow your teammates. I don't mean like a shadow, but if you're going around a corner let them go first and be the meat shields. It's easier to get a kill when there's 2-3 of you shooting at 1-2 guys than if it was just yourself."
BF_Hardline,3ar9nh,SkimSTi,2,Tue Jun 23 02:22:38 2015 UTC,I know its not the same game at all but I used to play black ops 2 and I killed it with a shotgun. Do you think I should try a shotgun in bfh as well then? I really just took what ever gun the game gave me I'm only rank 3.
BF_Hardline,3ar9nh,SkimSTi,1 point,Tue Jun 23 02:28:43 2015 UTC,"Oh, if you're only a rank 3, don't worry about it! You still have to get acclimated to the flow of the maps and the guns themselves.  If you like shotguns, try a shotgun! The 870 (default shotgun) is good. I've heard good things about the SPAS-12, but thats a criminal gun only.  If you want to stick with Enforcer, the SA-58 OSW battle rifle for criminals is awesome. Try the Scar-H for cops. Always equip an ammo box and your teammates will thank you.  If you want to use SMGs, try out the mechanic class. I like to use the sat. phone (tactical insertion) and armored insert (lowers bullet damage to chest).  If you want ARs, Operator is the way to go. I can get myself killed using it trying to revive people, so I usually stick to the other classes.  The professional (sniper) class is fun, if you want a high damage semi-auto rifle try out the SOCOM-16 or the Saiga .308 (cops / criminals). Fire as fast as you can pull the trigger. Add a red dot sight or 3x/4x scope and you can kill in a hurry."
BF_Hardline,3ar9nh,TheNation55,2,Tue Jun 23 02:45:41 2015 UTC,"ok that i support. haha.   otherwise, when playing, just stick to the outsides of the map. if you avoid running through the middle of the map you have a greater chance of staying alive since itll be harder to get shot in the back."

BF_Hardline,3ar9nh,vgdomination,4,Tue Jun 23 23:08:58 2015 UTC,"Battlefield games seem to have a bit of a learning curve for newcomers. More thought should go into your decision when you play. Just running and gunning will get you a few kills, but your game will really improve when you can give yourself a reason for every move you make. For example, rather than sprinting away after getting a kill, stay put because maybe that player you killed had a buddy following behind him. Thinking this way has really helped me transition to the Battlefield series and I'm loving it. Best of luck! Practice is key!"

BF_Hardline,3ar9nh,BillyHoWCR,2,Mon Jun 22 21:58:32 2015 UTC,"no. train yourself to think of it like real war instead of a video game. corner check, not blindly running around corners (at least if you are in enemy areas) and every time you reload ALWAYS glance at the minimap to see if you can get an idea of your enemies whereabouts.  you die so fast in this game.......... the more realistic you treat it, usually, the better the outcome. what i mean is you have to be a little more defensive in this game. be ready before your enemy. dont run straight into a herd of guys.... take the longer way around and flank. usually works pretty well.  i have a few highlight videos (3-4 min each) on my youtube channel that i dont want to spam on here, if you wanna go check out my style of play to give you a better idea, but as i mentioned, its not going to instantly make you a better player.  youtube search: skimsti"
BF_Hardline,3ar9nh,TermWerker,2,Mon Jun 22 22:13:21 2015 UTC,That's a good plan. I'll do this tonight
BF_Hardline,3ar9nh,skillfactor,2,Mon Jun 22 22:38:51 2015 UTC,I want to second his suggestion.  Slowing down and sort of letting the action come to you instead of blindly running into it will usually provide better results.  Don't worry so much about the objective if you are playing in Blood Money or Conquest or whatever you are playing.  Just try not to die and stay sort of close to your teammates.
BF_Hardline,3ar9nh,brollyssj4,2,Tue Jun 23 00:09:19 2015 UTC,Practice makes perfect man. Its all about muscle memory. We all sucked at one time or still do. Its just a matter of persistence and map knowledge
BF_Hardline,3ar9nh,zombieapathy,2,Tue Jun 23 05:40:50 2015 UTC,"A main element to Hardline is just learning how to stay alive; and by that, I mean learning the little tricks that make you harder to hit, will buy you half a second, or even just knowing when you should bail instead of going Rambo and trying to bite off more than you can chew.  The main thing to do, is keep moving; Hardline is a game where if you stop for a few seconds, chances are someone will find you, and likely be placed directly behind your person. The only time you should stand still, is when taking money from a money pile, and even then should your goal be a good K/D it is advisable to stop collecting money before you have $10m in order to do a parameter check before taking more money.  If you just look after yourself, the kills will come; if you're desperate for kills, you're going to make stupid decisions that end with you being teabagged."

BF_Hardline,3aq27t,tyler2k,2,Mon Jun 22 21:28:48 2015 UTC,Exactly. There's always tons of full servers to choose from. The game is awesome since the patch. The new map in the woods is absolutely superb!
BF_Hardline,3aq27t,nfoneo,4,Tue Jun 23 14:50:27 2015 UTC,"What's insane is how the ""Custom"" filter is handled, any change throws it off the main list. It's funny because they're the smallest changes that have no real impact on gameplay. For instance, the most popular NA Hotwire server just dumps the full mag when reloading, that's it.  Actually what I'd like to see is Custom become default until the game gets more popular and add some type of note that tells the player exactly what has changed. Because honestly I'm getting sick of this, ""why are there only 2-3 servers?"" daily circle jerk and I'm sure when new players first load up the game run into the same issue and either can't join, because they're full, or just get immediately turned off from the lack of servers."

On console it's relatively high but server search usually only yields one or two results simply because its broken.

BF_Hardline,3aq27t,Corbinworks,1 point,Mon Jun 22 17:10:44 2015 UTC,"It's going better on consoles but i wouldn't say it's going strong. It's been eclipsed by BF4 on every platform, but the PC has been hit the hardest."
BF_Hardline,3aq27t,Epikz1,1 point,Mon Jun 22 17:14:05 2015 UTC,"But the broken server search is killing it fast. If you want to get a criminal activity map on console the situation resembles PC. It isn't true, but the effect is still the same- it shows one or two servers and you think the game is dead, when in fact there are dozens of servers that just simply don't show up, like the one I pay good money for."

BF_Hardline,3apu49,GregoryGoose,2,Tue Jun 23 02:22:09 2015 UTC,"Funny thing is, it was necessary. The glitch requires that a space exists at a certain height and we didn't have one on the dance floor. So we had to create a floating zipline at the right height- bro flexing it was the only way to have that zipline make sense in context.  So we had to put down a zipline, put down a spawn beacon at that specific height, put down a second zipline out of sight, get on the spawn beacon, fire a third zipline from there, get the grapples onto it, and then try to do the worm without getting forced onto the grapples. We did a lot of kitswitching before we got it right. Plus the guy on the broflex didn't know what the fuck we were even doing- we just told him to get up there and he was like, ""oh what the fuck, I think Im going to have a seizure"". Fortunately he couldn't figure out how to get off it so I got the footage I needed before he left."
BF_Hardline,3apu49,Visceral_TO,2,Tue Jun 23 03:41:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah, this one will occur anywhere you can go prone but cannot crouch. The Shield will force you to go from prone to crouch, but if you cannot fit in that space it will break the animation and result in stretch armstrong."

BF_Hardline,3ao69n,nightbass,8,Mon Jun 22 06:37:22 2015 UTC,The balance guy (yes 1 guy) should send his patchnotes first to some symthic guys as approval  The L86 is laughable (Can't remember alan kertz doing something like that)

BF_Hardline,3ao69n,clientnotfound,10,Mon Jun 22 06:19:24 2015 UTC,Wow. That's actually kinda sad. I was even one of those super big optimists about this game... But seriously Visceral?
BF_Hardline,3ao69n,Jmaz99,2,Mon Jun 22 04:45:06 2015 UTC,That is what is so infuriating. This game has so much potential.

BF_Hardline,3ao69n,Xuvial,2,Tue Jun 23 03:26:57 2015 UTC,"It did have potential. If they had just focused on making it a $20-30 spin off multiplayer-only game with tightened gunplay, good balance and decent implementation people would've been ALL OVER that stuff.   Look how many TDM/Dom and Metro/Locker servers are active in BF4.

""TYPICAL DICE."" to the point that Dice didn't even know WHAT you crybabies (blanket posting like you do) wanted and had to ask ""we d0nT UnDARstand, WAT did YOU ALL LIKE ABOUT BF2?"" while scratching their heads.   So why bother letting them take over? If you're playing crappy all it takes is a few people to complain for you to join the herd and sound like the rest of the sheep again."

BF_Hardline,3ao69n,cutlerf,-4,Mon Jun 22 15:05:17 2015 UTC,Yep. Handing everything over to Dice won't fix a toxic community.
BF_Hardline,3ao69n,skillfactor,3,Mon Jun 22 15:15:29 2015 UTC,"Visceral obviously doesn't understand  weapon balance. And how does your previous post help this community? You went straight into ""you are a crappy player"" and ""You are a sheep"" when I made a reasonable criticism of the game. That is how you get a toxic community."
BF_Hardline,3ao69n,cutlerf,-4,Mon Jun 22 15:32:21 2015 UTC,"You say Visceral doesn't understand weapon balance but how does anyone here know you do? Your advice to fire them bc they increased the spread on the L85A2 isn't a ""Hardline fix"" as much as it is proof you only know enough to hop on the hate wagon and hit repeat. The same type of posters over on the BF4 forums are saying the same thing about Dice with the SRAW. Give the game over to Dice fully and you'll be back in 4 months with the rest of the herd."
BF_Hardline,3ao69n,skillfactor,2,Mon Jun 22 16:20:38 2015 UTC,"The SRAW nerf was intentional. You can agree with it or not. The L85A2 spread increase was a mistake. That is my point.

If you have something about Hardline to comment on good for you. If you just attack people on this sub you are the problem."
BF_Hardline,3ao69n,cutlerf,-6,Mon Jun 22 16:37:01 2015 UTC,"The L85A2 was also intentional and you disagree with it.. making it a mistake and still your opinion. I'm not trying to debate that either, but the same can be said for the SRAW and many more weapons along the way in BF4. I'm just not posting ""FIRE DICE""  because of it, though. Both games are good fun and your solution to fix any game so far is more trollish than ridiculous but equally stupid.  Conspiracy group? Haha, what? That would require more thinking than ""Give Hardline to Dice. The L85A2 sucks"""
BF_Hardline,3ao69n,skillfactor,2,Mon Jun 22 16:51:23 2015 UTC,"You obviously didn't read the patch notes and/or don't understand BF game mechanics. The L85a2 nerf is most certainly a mistake. I would be more concerned if it was on purpose. I dare you to reply without making a personal attack and instead use logic.   Edit: I'm not saying the idea to nerf the L85A2 was a mistake. That is up to the weapon balance guy. The way they nerfed it was a typo though. I understand the BF community loves to ""arm chair"" develop games, but this is different. Did you defend the death shield in BF4 also?"
BF_Hardline,3ao69n,cutlerf,-2,Mon Jun 22 16:56:01 2015 UTC,"I'm not debating the L85A2 because I don't use it. I'm saying that your advice to throw a studio under the bus by having them fired as a solution because the L85A2 sucks is ridiculous, lol... and NOTHING more. You also contradict yourself. In one post you shine the worlds biggest spotlight on Visceral with sweeping claims like ""they don't understand weapon balance""  and then advise that they might actually understand it but ""just made a typo"" instead. Nice"
BF_Hardline,3ao69n,skillfactor,7,Mon Jun 22 17:17:04 2015 UTC,"At this point I'm still convinced that Visceral's desire to be ""different"" from Battlefield 4 is what's keeping them from adopting a good weapon balance. They're completely inconsistent about it, seemingly changing random stats on random weapons to random values. This is extremely embarrassing."
BF_Hardline,3ao69n,GabTej,2,Mon Jun 22 08:44:11 2015 UTC,"How the discussion probably went down:  Dev1: ""Lets not be like BF4"".  Dev2: ""Agreed.

BF_Hardline,3ao69n,Nocturne501,8,Mon Jun 22 08:43:15 2015 UTC,A trained monkey would do a better job at altering weapon stats than Visceral. They just randomly changed few values. I think the dude in charge of weapons should be fired. 15->10 dmg? Wat. Nerfing RO933? Wat.
BF_Hardline,3ao69n,lampa_cz,2,Mon Jun 22 05:33:10 2015 UTC,Where did this guy get his numbers? Honestly curious because half the stuff he is talking about I don't remember seeing on the patch notes. Anyone got a link?
BF_Hardline,3ao69n,packer126,2,Tue Jun 23 02:22:53 2015 UTC,"Where did this guy get his numbers?   Game files. You can attempt to dig through them to extract weapon stats, in fact that's exactly what the folks over at Symthic do. The numbers never lie :)  Patch notes never include all the details."
BF_Hardline,3ao69n,Xuvial,2,Tue Jun 23 03:43:04 2015 UTC,"I think at this point stuff like weapon balance is irrelevant to both the devs and the majority of it's players.  Hardline did what it was supposed to do, i.e. make some quick easy cash on the side and throw a bone to FPS players on PS4/XBone...because their only other options were CoD or Destiny (lol). Rock-bottom standards + tiny library makes Hardline look brilliant on consoles, seriously.  Hardline didn't even have to try to attract millions of console sales, it pretty much just had to exist and work. Design mistakes or flawed weapon balance are irrelevant when your only real competition is CoD."
BF_Hardline,3ao69n,Xuvial,8,Mon Jun 22 09:40:41 2015 UTC,"That's not really fair, as I have around 5 20-minute videos of Hardline gameplay, wherein I delineate how to fix the balance. Even at launch of hardline, I thought this game had a ton of potential, and enjoyed it immensely. The lack of responsiveness from Visceral and their apathy toward creating a decent metagame has killed it for me, and I would now much rather play a game that is actively supported by its devs.   I had the numbers before Miffyli did, or rather, we got them at pretty much the same time, and videos take a lot longer to put together than posts do. I'm not saying my system is better than his—I simply offer a way to look at dry, possibly meaningless numbers and put them into perspective via comparisons to other Battlefield games in entertaining ways to help you understand them."
BF_Hardline,3ao69n,marbleduck,-3,Mon Jun 22 07:00:41 2015 UTC,"Fucking lol at that Visceral dev's morning coffee joke that you stole off the symthic forums. Your patch reviews are just reciting comments from symthic forums, it's embarrassing"
BF_Hardline,3ao69n,1randomguy,4,Mon Jun 22 18:13:17 2015 UTC,"Y'know, I'm pretty  active on the forums, and I actually asked if he minded that I used a similar phrase."
BF_Hardline,3ao69n,marbleduck,12,Tue Jun 23 02:09:20 2015 UTC,"Still he knows more about the numbers and their implications / effects then Visceral does, obviously.

Marble is more interested in the franchise and its future as a whole, that's why he is so critical about it."

BF_Hardline,3aq9xm,GregoryGoose,3,Mon Jun 22 18:20:43 2015 UTC,Don't have an official date for it yet. It usually depends on what we want to include in the update and how long it takes to implement and test those fixes. We're still gathering data from CA stuff and the messy release hasn't exactly helped us gather it.
BF_Hardline,3aq9xm,FalconiiLV,1 point,Mon Jun 22 18:30:31 2015 UTC,"Known about this for a while, you simply climb out of the map. But as far as I can tell all you can really do from there is capture a flag, or equip a gas mask and gas grenades and spam the money pile from under the map. Most people aren't that smart, meaning that they are just there for the thrill of being there- not cheating. I wouldn't really prioritize it.  Plus, it seems visceral took away all the grapples from that map, meaning they now have to use up a precious gadget slot to get there. After the round ends theyll probably forget to change it back, too. Poetic justice if you ask me."

BF_Hardline,3asgip,pandaridingatrex,3,Tue Jun 23 06:37:59 2015 UTC,"I have to disagree to an extent; Battlefield in general should not be balanced around competitive play, if that's what you're ultimately insinuating. However, I do agree that at the end of the day, the developers need to have the final say and judgment as to what's implemented. We've had tons of polls, developer interaction pre-launch, and there were many times where major youtubers and competitive players went to Visceral HQ in order to help bring the community's opinion into the game. Whether that's helped or hindered the game might be hard to say, but the community is very divided over many key issues so it's hard to say that it's a reliable source of information in regards to changes. That being said, this game is in a unfortuante pretty poor state considering it's only about 3 months old, but I suppose if nothing else it's a lesson for future BF iterations."
BF_Hardline,3asgip,godisevol,2,Tue Jun 23 09:02:25 2015 UTC,"This subreddit has less than 14,000 subscribers. I'm sure less than half are commonly on here. So you don't want them to listen to people on reddit but do want them to listen to people on reddit?   A month after Tracer rounds? Didn't Criminal Activity come out last Monday?   And you shun people who bitch on the subreddit yet you are exactly doing that, bitching about armored inserts. I agree that making a class use weapon attachment to combat a gadget probably wasn't the best idea but I  also notice you fail to point out what you think should be done...   Also back to the reddit thing. Going to guess a good portion of the people on this subreddit are PC players. PC got the DLC a good week after it was supposed to. Expect PC players to be mad."
BF_Hardline,3asgip,pandaridingatrex,1 point,Tue Jun 23 19:32:27 2015 UTC,making a class use weapon attachment to combat a gadget   You forgot to mention that the gadget is behind a paywall. Which no one seems to be bitching about. To kill someone using an OP gadget you have to pay. Unacceptable.
BF_Hardline,3asgip,godisevol,1 point,Tue Jun 23 08:58:05 2015 UTC,I agree its a poor design but honestly. I find aiming for the head helpful. I don't even use the AP/Tracer rounds due to how badly they give away your position. I play Hardcore so not giving away my firing position is crucial. Most people don't care though and I doubt Visceral really cares. Hell PC was a week late for DLC even though our 50$ was promised to give us 2 weeks early access to every DLC.

The weapons, which are lacking, are incredibly unbalanced and every class is the same 2-3 shot build.   The maps are poorly designed and often end up with one team spawn camping the hell out of the other until the round ends.   Multiple maps have glitch spots that have been being exploited since launch, with no fix in sight.  Counter-Strike is a competitive shooter.  Hardline is a money grab that we all fell for to entertain us until BF5.  It's an expansion pack that you paid 60 bucks for.  Would you like me to continue?

BF_Hardline,3apfvz,nightbass,2,Mon Jun 22 12:55:48 2015 UTC,"As a huge fan of Hardline I have to agree. The spawn system still needs major tweaking. I'm not sure if they're tuning it map-by-map, but Bank Job is still horrid... especially in TDM... the same spawn-trap outside the bank up front is still there. It's the absolute worst to get caught in. Dying in that area is like storming the beach of Normandy and getting shot from behind."
BF_Hardline,3apfvz,skillfactor,1 point,Mon Jun 22 15:13:21 2015 UTC,"Bank job is pretty bad, but I think everglades can be worse. The start points of everglades on tdm are right next to each other.  Once you get into the match, it's fine. But the teams start like 75m from each other."

BF_Hardline,3apfvz,readerofthetruth,1 point,Mon Jun 22 14:03:00 2015 UTC,"How many players are there on the official setting? Modes like this (run over the dead players bodies) usually bring out the worst in spawn systems. Hardline already had problems with TDM so its expected. You don't go to the normal focal points of the map in TDM, you go to the spawn points, because that's where the enemies are. Throw in the coins so that players camp and run through the spawns and of course it gets worse."
BF_Hardline,3apfvz,Time_Itself,1 point,Mon Jun 22 16:01:57 2015 UTC,I totally get what you're saying about the coins and how that will cause campers to be plentiful but COD managed to do Kill Confirmed which is essentially the same game but with better spawn points. I don't ever remember being spawn killed so quickly with COD.  And their maps were/are even smaller.
BF_Hardline,3am0sa,CookieDoughCooter,9,Sun Jun 21 15:23:17 2015 UTC,"In hotwire it rarely seems to matter which side you're on, it plays the same. No need to replay the map. In blood money it can matter a bit more. But since they doubled the default cash requirement games are going a lot longer and I don't find myself as interested in playing the other side of the map. Change it back to 150, or even 200, or don't repeat the map. You don't always end up on the opposite side even."
BF_Hardline,3am0sa,Time_Itself,2,Sun Jun 21 15:27:12 2015 UTC,"The default for servers is two rounds, where the teams USUALLY switch so players get to play on both sides.  I agree with you that it is too much and set my servers to one round per map."

BF_Hardline,3aoe4u,yosoytupadre,2,Tue Jun 23 01:40:02 2015 UTC,"All valid ideas/concerns. The biggest problem is the fact that the game is balanced exactly the same on console and PC, which you kind of mention in your post regarding the TTK.  I made a post talking about the OPness of the M416/M16A3 and got downvoted and mostly negative comments. Seeing as the majority of players are console players, it makes sense that they don't find the weapons OP, since they are balanced with the high recoil they have for consoles.  Visceral stated that it's not an option to have different balance values because that would mean more active versions of the game to support. This might be true, because I have no idea how the Frostbite engine works. But I also know that Rainbow Six Siege is set to release with weapons having double the recoil on PC compared to consoles."

BF_Hardline,3aoe4u,Resin_Smoker,1 point,Tue Jun 23 13:05:25 2015 UTC,"You make a good argument, however having multiplatform releases in inevitable. It's just too profitable to single out specific platforms (thus why 360 and ps3 are still getting games despite their predecessors being out nearly 2 years.) A further conundrum is that it's also probably not worth the effort and gamer frustration over treating specific platforms differently in terms of patches and content."
BF_Hardline,3aoe4u,Resin_Smoker,1 point,Tue Jun 23 15:40:54 2015 UTC,"Console players have the attention span to match the depth of the games they play. Its why a piss-poor PC release can do fairly well when ported over to console.   Point-blank, I do not believe that PC gaming as we know it will last much longer considering the current state of things. Everything from bad releases, pay-play, and DLC that your forced to pay for after the fact has ruined what used to be an enjoyable hobbie. When this finally happens, you'll see console gaming turn sour as well due to the fact that most all gaming innovation comes from PC gaming. This is simply because software for PC's isn't constrained by the hardware limitations normally associated with consoles. Besides, no developer wants to be stuck working by Microsoft's or Sony's rules / license agreements. It's why Steam is one of the few PC venues worth a dam so long as you don't factor in the bail-n-switch that 90% of all steam early release titles tend to be."

I'm more annoyed that we seem to have some kind of visceral dev or something answer me like 4 days ago and never return with any kind of news or info. That's pretty bloody and in my books. Don't come in here repping the company and say you will get back to us with news and go missing for days. Pathetic.

I realise they don't have to give us anything for this huge cock-up but I feel that a genuine apology and explanation of why they have been so bad with their clarity or that they will actually make an effort to make sure this doesn't happen in the future  would be nice but hey they have my money so why change the ea tune. Rant over."

BF_Hardline,3ap5ka,Calob_24,2,Mon Jun 22 10:52:59 2015 UTC,What are the current unlock criteria for them now?
BF_Hardline,3ap5ka,Jimmy8085,1 point,Mon Jun 22 12:25:47 2015 UTC,Visceral please fix it by enabling Dino and Wolf masks to cops as a reward for that $10 million assignment. It is an easy fix and no new content is needed.
BF_Hardline,3ap5ka,nightbass,1 point,Mon Jun 22 12:58:51 2015 UTC,"I was at 5.5 mil cash (and almost 10 mil earned in game) when they changed the assignments and got Dino mask after 2 days. Then I realized how pointless masks were at my 150 lvl (and without non-existent Premium legendary status). I don't think that I will even bother with Wolf mask. Instead, I started to spent all those millions on gold BP and new camos."
BF_Hardline,3ap5ka,Leon1008,1 point,Mon Jun 22 13:43:34 2015 UTC,The wolf one is a different one and the Dino seems to be for criminals. I guess to keep with the animals for criminals and helmets for cops.
BF_Hardline,3ap5ka,DarkISO,1 point,Mon Jun 22 14:04:08 2015 UTC,I also saved up 10M before the DLC launched. I would have preferred they just added new masks in stead of switching things around.  While we lose the ability to have the Dino Mask as a cop the Wolf and Dino Mask are automatically unlocked as Criminals in the Loadout section if you already unlocked that Assignment before the DLC was released. At least that is what happened for me as I still have yet to get the DLC Dino/Wolf Assignements completed.  I liked the look of the original Wolf mask.
BF_Hardline,3ap5ka,readerofthetruth,1 point,Mon Jun 22 14:05:27 2015 UTC,"i am only a bit confused that the 10mil assignment is still in battlelog. (that means if you want 100% assignment completion, you still got to do it anyway!?)    that they removed the dino/wolf masks from the cops side is OK with me, makes sense to the theme to have masks for criminals and helmets for the cops... but yeah i don't see the point in them as a gadget if they just boost XP... i don't feel like i played this game at all yet and am lvl96 already...  that took me forever in BF4."
BF_Hardline,3ap5ka,ZeroBANG,1 point,Mon Jun 22 14:52:26 2015 UTC,"Wait, so 10,000,000 no longer gets the masks? Can I get the masks if I don't have Premium?"
BF_Hardline,3ap5ka,wexfordlad1,1 point,Mon Jun 22 17:38:52 2015 UTC,"Regarding the wolf mask, not sure how many Zip line coins you have but if you're like me and most of the other BFH population, it's 0. So you need 5 of those and then you need 500 kills with two different Syndicate weapons, which on their own requires a plethora of requirements.  So unless you're getting boosted, it's something almost no newer player will achieve in the near future. At the same time, if you're getting boosted, you can just get boosted to 10 million..."
BF_Hardline,3ap5ka,tyler2k,0,Mon Jun 22 23:09:58 2015 UTC,I was wondering that myself. Why add Assignments that unlock something that is already unlockable by another Assignment?
BF_Hardline,3ap5ka,BillyHoWCR,1 point,Mon Jun 22 10:56:28 2015 UTC,"Because the assignment was stupid and a full grind? I would rather have something to actually work towards than just saving gold. Yes 500 kills with 2 weapons is also a grind, but if you don't already have the syndicates, thats actually alot of assignements to complete, gives the players a goal."
BF_Hardline,3ap5ka,Funkeren,1 point,Thu Jun 25 12:18:33 2015 UTC,I am working on that Assignment now. But is it any more stupid to have that Assignment now equate simply to getting a Gold Battlepack and Patch?
BF_Hardline,3ap5ka,BillyHoWCR,1 point,Thu Jun 25 12:24:04 2015 UTC,I was merely stating that the syndicate assignments is more 'fun' to complete than 'not' using/saving 10 mil gold which requires no single effort at all.
BF_Hardline,3aoo47,SirManguydude,1 point,Mon Jun 22 06:25:59 2015 UTC,"I don't believe they have that option. In prior versions of BF, the pistol-only servers run a script that will kill/kick you if you use a ""banned"" weapon. You have to switch to your sidearm every time you spawn."

BF_Hardline,3apkm5,clientnotfound,3,Mon Jun 22 13:43:23 2015 UTC,"The police do have mountable patrol helicopters in real life; the reason they don't deploy miniguns is primarily the danger to public safety, the lack of heavily armoured criminal vehicles which would require such firepower, and a preference for marksmen where a helicopter is required to engage - in reality, helicopters are used almost exclusively for recon.   However, should criminals start driving around in heavily armoured vehicles, with .50 cal machine guns, attempting to steal $300m... Chances are the law enforcement agencies would up their game a little... The question would be less so whether such would be deployed, and moreso whether the armed forces/spec ops would take over in that situation.  The Stinger isn't hidden behind a wall; if there are helicopters, there is a Stinger pick-up on the map. If you want a Stinger in your boot, that is a matter of convenience; such matters can be locked behind progression.  ""Rescue"" is ludicrous; we'd send in the SAS if some heavily armed knobheads had hostages."

The damn things can shoot pretty much clear across the map and are basically a one hit kill.  Not to mention like three dudes emptying their mags into a chopper in unison shreds through the health pretty damned quickly. And now they have AP ammo which supposedly does more damage.  It really only takes moderate effort and virtually no skill to make life hell for choppers in this game."

It's not like Bounty Hunter Coin has even been around that long... ha  Edit: and I think the leaderboards for these coins start at 10 don't they? So you have to get 10 coins before even showing up on the leaderboard.   I noticed this due to TDM Supremacy coin being also very difficult... and it too had nobody on the leaderboards at the beginning. And I am only sitting on 5 of them even though I have put more time into TDM then most.
BF_Hardline,3am3sk,BillyHoWCR,5,Sun Jun 21 16:04:28 2015 UTC,"EDIT:  It does appear that you need a quantity of 10 to show up on the BFHstats leaderboards. Without a Bounty Hunter game mode score leaderboard we dont' know how many people are playing. Maybe they'll add one once the DLC is available to purchase outside of Premium?  I am more than open to reevaluate this in a month or two but I suspect I won't have any of these coins unless someone comes up with some custom Server Rules on a rented server to bypass the difficulty of obtaining a Bounty Hunter Supremacy Coin let alone 50 for the Bounty.  Perhaps being dramatic gets results? It seems to have helped get the devs attention regarding shield/camera coins as they now rain like candy post patch.  I'm not asking for the coins to be easily gained, just make it feasible to earn them in the first place."

BF_Hardline,3am1lf,BillyHoWCR,2,Sun Jun 21 15:31:37 2015 UTC,I completed the Criminal Syndicate a few days ago which includes the Black Market Assignment. I got a lot of Zipline Coins by waiting for a teammate to spawn outside a vehicle in game modes like Conquest Large at the beginning of a round. There's usually at least one guy who can't spawn in a vehicle. Spawn beside him and place ziplines. He will most likely follow you and give you zip bonuses.
BF_Hardline,3am1lf,macaronyboy,1 point,Sun Jun 21 18:17:11 2015 UTC,On downtown the other day I saw a guy using his grappling hooks on the roof closest to the point c. He put them at the two elevators so as soon as you exited you went right up the grappling hook. After reading this I think it's kind of a way to force teammates to use the them.
BF_Hardline,3am1lf,docollas,1 point,Sun Jul 12 22:21:17 2015 UTC,I am at a loss for the location you are talking about? Can't think of any elevator that is outside to allow grappling hook?  But the... forced accidental grapple thing is a smart idea though.

BF_Hardline,3aiga0,coolbho3k,4,Sun Jun 21 00:54:20 2015 UTC,"Yep, I agree. I think that's the ideal answer. It was discussed in the ""M416/M16 Post Patch"" thread, and I was told that one of the devs at Visceral said it would be easy to do, but that it would be a hard sell to the PC developers because they're apparently happy with the TTK as is."
BF_Hardline,3aiga0,DAGam3r,6,Sat Jun 20 22:45:25 2015 UTC,"The TTK is the only issue I have with the game. I understand this is supposed to be different than other BF titles, but the super low TTK makes the game less satisfying for me. I think this is the reason there is so much emphasis on grinding in this game. Simply playing the objectives is boring to me because all engagements are over within half a second and whoever fires first generally wins. Thing like accuracy and skill are more arbitrary IMO than other battlefield games."
BF_Hardline,3aiga0,cutlerf,3,Sun Jun 21 01:35:32 2015 UTC,"I agree completely. You're either instantly killing people or instantly dying, with no in-between. IMO, the 'in-between' is where all the fun happens."
BF_Hardline,3aiga0,DAGam3r,2,Sun Jun 21 02:29:25 2015 UTC,"I kinda disagree. If you play this game as BF4 then you can be dissatisfied but if you are playing with the low TTK in mind it is much more rewarding and fun. You can't simply run and gun into room without checking your hud. Many times the first to shoot is the first to win gunfight so you must pay attention to hud, steps nearby, even icons of fallen buddies. The game is more tactical in this sense. They nerfed really OP'd K10 and MPX that were insta kill on CQB. Now you can survive even with the newly released Tommy gun. Just position yourself near walls and use surroundings to your advantage. And last thing, do not spawn on your buddies that are in gunfight. I am not following this tip  lots of time and end up dying instantly."
BF_Hardline,3aiga0,nightbass,1 point,Sun Jun 21 02:36:11 2015 UTC,"I really think the best solution is to have different weapon stats on PC and Console   Why do you think this is the best solution? DICE LA just showed how to get weapon balance right across all platforms. BF4 on PS4 has more active players than Hardline on PS4 on a regular basis (despite Criminal Activity coming out). In fact BF4 on PS4 has even more players than PC! That's more than enough proof that console players don't mind slightly longer TTK's whatsoever. It encourages better aim and you actually have to pay attention to controlling spread/recoil, and console players don't mind this.  BF4 is living proof that a good middle-ground can be found between PC and console balance, at least as far as guns go.   (Stuff like UCAV and TV missile is a different story :P)"
BF_Hardline,3aiga0,Xuvial,8,Sun Jun 21 09:13:21 2015 UTC,"I really enjoyed Hardline while it lasted, but looking back it seems clear to me why it didn't succeed: lack of depth.   Fewer maps than BF4 Same classes Weapons pretty similar Gadgets don't seem to impact game play much Game modes don't standout, most feel like TDM Vehicles don't matter much outside of Hotwire   Sure the game is overpriced for what you get, but I don't think that's the main issue. If you think back to when the game launched there were plenty of players/servers. Most people just got bored and moved on. It certainly didn't help that Visceral took forever to patch things though."

Hardline's mechanics, cover system, netcode are all perfect and it was nearly perfect at launch...couple patches later  Plus the new maps are some of the most fun I've ever had...   This coming from someone who owns them all..."
BF_Hardline,3aiga0,jojomane,0,Sat Jun 20 22:30:50 2015 UTC,"Glad you see developers as incredibly greedy people.  The low servers isn't their fault, the community isn't large enough on PC, which sucks but they can't exactly do much about that.   I'd argue everything else, but I don't want to get into a debate about that stuff. But just because you paid for the game doesn't mean the devs just up and leave the studio and not help make the game better. There's other limits to how fast they put out patches and which ones they think make the most sense for the game."
BF_Hardline,3aiga0,Ralex-,12,Sun Jun 21 17:21:04 2015 UTC,"I wonder how many of the bandwagon ""the game sucks don't play it"" people actually even TRIED Hardline. I'm guessing less than half."
BF_Hardline,3aiga0,IAmTheFatman666,21,Sun Jun 21 15:50:07 2015 UTC,I played till I hit 105- I cannot find servers now- I looked last night at prime time and there were 3 servers with more than 10 players. For many that own the game playing is not really an option now- you think folks are supposed to log into an empty server and hang and wait-?- And it wasn't a bandwagon- the game is fun but it is fucked up balance wise...no arguing that.
BF_Hardline,3aiga0,fletch420man,9,Sat Jun 20 14:54:08 2015 UTC,"I may be biased, as I play on X1. Plenty of players and servers. I think it's kinda sad that no one it playing it. It's unfair to people that love playing."
BF_Hardline,3aiga0,IAmTheFatman666,8,Sat Jun 20 15:00:31 2015 UTC,Last night XB1 had 8900 players. While that's more than PC I don't think those are great numbers.
BF_Hardline,3aiga0,godisevol,4,Sat Jun 20 15:17:05 2015 UTC,"Not great, no, but better. It's unfortunate for the game really. It's a great game, but people don't believe in it."
BF_Hardline,3aiga0,IAmTheFatman666,26,Sat Jun 20 15:48:23 2015 UTC,"People don't believe in the game because Visceral stopped communicating with their players. Pre-release they tried to convince us they cared about us, talking to us about features, attempting to  having a dialogue about what we like/dislike. Post-release they just disappeared. Sure, we have a couple of Visceral people in this sub-reddit who pop in and say ""we're listening, but I can't say anything, it's not my job"" or some other bullshit excuse; but that doesn't change the fact that they vanished and waited far too long to address any balance issues and when they did what we got was a sorry excuse for a patch, especially for people who are ""listening.""  I stopped playing after that debacle fixed nothing and am just now coming back to try out the new patch/dlc and am appalled at how little everything changed; there are still balancing issues, spawns are still broken, and now there's pay to win dlc which no one seems to be calling them out on.   Of course there are people in this subreddit who are Visceral apologists so I'm sure this will be downvoted, but whatever this is Viscera's fault and as consumers we should be pissed that they took our money and ran.  Lastly, as a Premium member I want to know where my promised features are. I paid for them, tell me something.   tl;dr Blame Visceral. Their lack of communication and focus drove away their players."
BF_Hardline,3aiga0,godisevol,7,Sat Jun 20 15:52:16 2015 UTC,"I played the game for about 4 weeks on XB1. Hardline has the worst weapon balance of any recent Battlefield title.  BC2, BF3, and BF4 all had/have issues with weapon balance, but Hardline's is just straight up awful. I don't understand how Visceral can be so bad at weapon balance, I mean DICE at least have an excuse, they have to spend a lot of time balancing all the vehicles (jets, attack helicopters, scout helicopters, transport choppers, attack boats, RHIB boats, Tanks, IFVs). There are what, 2 offensive vehicles in Hardline? A horribly designed ""attack helicopter"" and the CAT. Plus, HL had an extra year of development compared to BF3/4 and it's still shit.   Visceral dropped the ball hard with HL and they have no-one but themselves to blame."
BF_Hardline,3aiga0,1randomguy,5,Sat Jun 20 16:14:31 2015 UTC,It's because they mindlessly treated weapon balance and progression in their multiplayer exactly the same as they might treat it in a single player title. I hope they keep Visceral off of future multiplayer projects in the Battlefield series because they are not mindful of how to design multiplayer. You'd think the game designers haven't even played a multiplayer shooter.

BF_Hardline,3aiga0,tyler2k,5,Sun Jun 21 00:54:15 2015 UTC,"Played it a lot at first, but it eventually went the way of Titanfall. A fun change of pace every now and then, but not nearly enough variety for keeping my interest for extended periods. On the other hand, I still play BF4 near daily."
BF_Hardline,3aiga0,DefiantSoul,3,Sat Jun 20 20:43:03 2015 UTC,"Many Battlefield fans never needed to play the game since it lacked something a lot of fans play Battlefield games for, military vehicles. I am sure it is a fun game, and the betas were okay, but for most people who like the Battlefield series quite a bit, another $100 game to replace something you still have fun with doesn't make much sense. Especially when GTA V is released around the same time and most would rather buy that."
BF_Hardline,3aiga0,idontlikeketchup,3,Sat Jun 20 15:22:19 2015 UTC,"I got to level 40 or so, didn't really like any of the game modes (I played rush pretty much exclusively in 3/4) except hotwire, and I only liked hotwire because it was a completely ridiculous shitshow. It was a lot of fun, but not for the reasons I normally like an FPS.  also, i could never shake the feeling that it wasn't as 'tight' as bf4 was, if that makes any sense. the movement and shooting all felt kinda sloppy."
BF_Hardline,3aiga0,eedna,1 point,Sat Jun 20 22:53:44 2015 UTC,I personally feel the opposite. After going back to BF4 I felt like the movement was much more sluggish and I got caught on scenery and just generally moved less fluidly.
BF_Hardline,3aiga0,BlitzKraig1,1 point,Sat Jun 20 19:29:02 2015 UTC,"Same. I'm at the similar level and I just have some much more games to play instead of Hardline. I ended up preordering the game and played a little bit of the beta but I ended up not playing Hardline almost 2 months later since I was still working on my back log of games like GTA5 and I missed out on the ""new game"" feel, and I just never got hooked. I might jump on a bit for a change of pace but I don't think the game was worth $120. I'm probably going to ask EA for a refund on the game or at least for Premium. I rather get the money back then hold on in hopes that the upcoming DLCs are going to be game changers but with the player base going the route of the Dodo bird, I doubt it.   Some people like the game a lot and I've seen plenty of level 150 folks to devote hours into it each day while I'm already bored with it. Hell, I'm pretty high level on BF4 myself but I just don't like Hardline. The game just feels off for me."

BF_Hardline,3aiga0,NihilistWolfe,3,Sun Jun 21 06:31:36 2015 UTC,"I had a lot of fun with this game while it lasted. ""Fun"" is the correct word, it wasn't very tactical or serious, just a very fun game. What made it die on PC is probably too fast TTK - I understand that devs wanted to make this game different from BF4 but I don't think it's the good way to do this.   Weapon balance is a joke at this point too.  To me, BF4 has an incredible atmosphere - it's something what makes me playing this game every day or every other day now."
BF_Hardline,3aiga0,akwaz,3,Sun Jun 21 23:59:44 2015 UTC,"I have to disagree with this, just because it's a Battlefield game doesn't mean the PC player base should automatically love it, IMO the main reason why its dead on PC is due to the reason of there must be a lot of hardcore Battlefield players that have either been around since BC2 or even way back from BF:1942 and BF2 and they expect a certain theme or play style when it comes to a new Battlefield game. Obviously there's a lot less hardcore Battlefield players on consoles, maybe they only started with BF4 or BF3 so they might be a little more open to Hardline, also even on console the player base has diminished a lot which tells me yes there must be a fairly large group on consoles as well that have expectations for a Battlefield title and obviously Hardline does not cater to that.   Hardline on its own without the Battlefield name is a fairly decent solid FPS game, but its just not a good Battlefield game. I will say though that I'm happy Visceral proved they can make a FPS game and it seems like they put in a lot of effort but sadly they went down the wrong path, maybe because of bad leadership or decision making. Hopefully next time they will consider what's best for the player base and franchise before developing another Battlefield game.﻿ Also I agree with the concern about if EA will drop the PC platform in the future, I really really hope that never happens. ﻿"
BF_Hardline,3aiga0,Harri_Does_Gaming,2,Sun Jun 21 06:37:01 2015 UTC,"I agree that the theme was the main concern for me. I don't understand why they thought this was a good idea especially when so many other games have this theme.  I can not relate to a cops and bank robbers theme unless I'm 12 especially with the stories in the news lately.   I would like bf to become more adult, and more serious. Cater to older gamers. I think the campaigns have shown that they are catering to 13 year olds. Let's see something  a little more mature and put together a little more of a serious military tactical game."
BF_Hardline,3aiga0,Moonatx,2,Sun Jun 21 09:35:02 2015 UTC,This is when the low content release + DLC payment model breaks and EA wakes the **** up?
BF_Hardline,3aiga0,fugazied,1 point,Sun Jun 21 01:15:39 2015 UTC,I doubt it because of the success they had with previous battlefield games and DLC payments they'll excuse Hardline due to other reasons.  I have no doubt they'll have a season pass for the Star Wars Battlefront game.
BF_Hardline,3aiga0,EliteDangerous,2,Sun Jun 21 13:18:29 2015 UTC,"I'm sure some who are happy to see it die off didn't want to have the population drop off for BF4, the exclusive weapons for the ""deluxe"" edition got under a lot of peoples skin even though they turned out to be a non issue due to the lack of weapon balance."

Ive sunk more time into this then i have bf4 because of the tacticalness of the games. All these future games with double jump and hardline stays the same and battlefield should stay this way. We lost cod. The only thing i would change is the amount of kills for certain weapons and this game runs fine on console. I always find a server. Im hoping the next dlc maps wont be dark and maybe have some actual levolution. Thats what battlefield was amazing at. Destruction.

Lack of attention-It was clear on release day that we had a severe problem with gun balance (k10,m16,m416), the kind that gets immediate attention. Instead we got nothing- they waited and watched teh server load go to <500 before they bothered to do anything, then by most accounts they not only didn't really fix the problems they just adjusted some and created others. This game had some serious potential (it is quite fun) but having noone at the controls ended up driving it off a cliff."
BF_Hardline,3aiga0,fletch420man,1 point,Sat Jun 20 16:44:32 2015 UTC,"I keep wondering where Levelcap gets the misguided pretension that PC players want ""hardcore military"" or that they're upset with Hardline's theme. Nonsense.   Some of the most popular PC shooters of all time have nothing to do with military: CS:GO, Team Fortress, Quake, Planetside, Unreal Tournament, Tribes Ascend, etc. About as cartoony and arcady as it gets. Hardline's failure has nothing to do with the theme! If it was well-designed, well-balanced and well-priced it would have definitely taken off on PC. We don't care about theme...we care about good design/balance, nice skill/depth, which in turn gives games lasting appeal and good value for money. But Hardline made it clear Visceral have zero clue what balance is, and all skill/depth associated with Battlefield games was thrown out of the window of a speeding car (pun intended) along with all it's content & variety. And yet EA had the balls to pull the same $60 base price + $50 premium as BF4?? Pretty sure they were just checking what they could get away with. The type of ""quick easy fun"" Hardline had to offer lasted a total of 2-3 weeks before most players got either bored or frustrated and left - that's across ALL platforms, not just PC.   Yes, one of the big reasons Hardline failed on PC was due to many better/cheaper alternatives being available...at least Levelcap got that right. But remember the game initially started with total 230k+ player counts and now struggles to reach even ~40-50k. It's ""dying"" on all platforms, it's just PC died first due to PC players having a lot lower tolerance for watered-down games from EA. It was a shallow casualized game that cost WAY too much for what it offered, and should win the official award of having the worst weapon balance out of any shooter ever.   Hardline was full of amazing potential and good ideas, unfortuantely let down by half-hearted implementation. Not to mention Visceral took 3 months to fix blatant issues that were highlighted in beta. Hotwire? Great on paper, but some brilliant chump in the dev team thought it would be a great idea to make cruising reward 3x more xp/money than any other mode (perfect for boosting) and allow all sorts of 1-shot explosives. Also whoever came up with syndicate assignments needs to be fired. It's a PRIME example of trying to make up for lack of content/depth by arbitrarily lengthening gameplay, making people do retardedly odd grindy things. I know Korean MMORPG's that involve less faffing-around than Hardline.   Crosshair & Rescue aimed at PC eSports ?? LMFAO both modes were a joke, that ship sank before it even set sail.   The only reason console players are still playing is because the rock-bottom standards set by CoD/Destiny/etc makes Hardline look brilliant in comparison, combined with the lack of decent FPS options on PS4/XBone.  Now...~puts on flame suit~...I'm ready for the fans to bury me :P"
BF_Hardline,3aiga0,Xuvial,1 point,Mon Jun 22 11:12:13 2015 UTC,I think that the first BFH beta coming out while BF4 was still crashing all over the place really killed the perception for this game before it even had a chance.

BF_Hardline,3anr92,SirManguydude,3,Mon Jun 22 06:22:30 2015 UTC,I don't think Stingers even lock on to the dart. I shot several (ground) vehicles with a tracker dart and aimed at them with the Stinger. No lock on...
BF_Hardline,3anr92,macaronyboy,1 point,Mon Jun 22 09:13:57 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure the Stinger only works with the dart on Air vehicles, which makes it so that ECM and Flares don't work.  Kind of like Stingers get that bonus in BF4 if someone lasers a target."

BF_Hardline,3aixdr,pandaridingatrex,3,Sun Jun 21 14:24:13 2015 UTC,I agree with you. My goal is to eventually have 100 gold stars with every gun because why not? I agree though only using one gun gets boring to me but it seems there are quite a few players who stick to one.

BF_Hardline,3aixdr,godisevol,3,Sun Jun 21 14:26:18 2015 UTC,"For one they didn't put very many guns in the game, so the selection to choose from is slim. Also, there's a clear leader for every faction/class and since there aren't ""All Kit"" weapons like in other BF titles people tend with what they know.   Secondly, Visceral did such a piss poor job of balancing weapons, not only per class, but also per faction that people ended up using one weapon and sticking with it. There should be no reason that there's not a counter to the K10 on the criminal faction.  Lastly, some people are leaderboard junkies. They want to be known to be in the top 10/50/100 with a weapon. I left for 2 months came back and am still in the top 30 with the SA-58, fwiw.   I agree it's boring. I'd love to have some variety, but since I' play Enforcer pretty exclusively it's either the SA-58 with its ridiculous muzzle velocity or one of the other almost exactly the same BRs with slower ROF/MV. What should I do?"
BF_Hardline,3aixdr,PraeteritaCautus,1 point,Sun Jun 21 12:30:34 2015 UTC,"I hate the fact of no all kit weapons, it splits the possibly of a professional helping more up close with their trip mines or that damn stealth gadget they have them but you know whatever. I don't know if they should have a counter for every single gun but more so the top ones only, for instance you wouldn't want essentially 2 K10s in the game would you?   I'm used to be kind of a lobby board person, like, when BF4 came out, I only used the SCAR-H and M249 got to around top 30 in the US, Top 10 (number 8) in my state with Pistols, Bolt Actions and grenades. Left for a week and got killed by someome with an MG4, get curious look up their battlelog................over 20,000 kills with it..wtf  Yes their may not be any superior battle rifles but they really aren't that bad, well I play on console but the SCAR-H is a beast. Everytime I use it, either long range for 4or5 shot kills against probe snipers on dust bowl in their spawn, or up close on bank job, it dominants. The HK51 isn't bad either. Idk why but IRNV on that gun is a really good choice.."

FAL smokes the SA-58 in every category that made it special. Fast MV, faster recoil decrease, less recoil overall, further drop-off. It's like they don't know how to balance a class at all."

Someone who is use to a K+M has an option to use a K+M on a console with that dongle where they'll find a much larger playerbase for this particular title.

Mainly Coop and RPG games and things like madden, primarily games where the controller you use wont be an advantage. I suppose if EA/DICE wanted to do cross platform they could, but I dont see it. They have enough trouble balancing the games as it is with out adding in try to balance mouse and keyboard vs controller, a $400 console vs a $2000 PC etc.  Graphics settings on a PC could give a huge advantage to a PC player. Even if both used controllers the greater amount of input lag the consoles have would give the advantage to a PC player.  http://www.polygon.com/2015/1/21/7869323/microsoft-phil-spencer-xbox-one-windows-10-pc-cross-buy-cross-play"

Hardline was a total ripoff when they sold it at $60 and then turn around a week after launch and the regular price has dropped to $40. AP rounds are also something that make way more of a game balance difference than just extra guns. And if nothing else the player count on Hardline sucks right now. It's dead completely on PC and player counts are barely holding at 15-20k on Xbox One and PS4 and only an extremely small percentage of that number is likely to of bought Premium which means unpopulated DLC servers. This games entire pricing structure needs to be redone for there to be any hope of people even still playing it for the next DLC launch but for right now this first DLC just needs to be free like China Rising was for pre-ordering BF4, a Battlefield game that already offered way more content than Hardline.

BF_Hardline,3ahtk4,Covertxof,3,Sat Jun 20 10:27:19 2015 UTC,+1 for Proximity chat
BF_Hardline,3ahtk4,RedTerror98,7,Sat Jun 20 18:47:05 2015 UTC,"It would be so nice to play, without hearing some prick shouting at his kid every 5 minutes.."
BF_Hardline,3ahtk4,CertifiedTreeSmoker,2,Sat Jun 20 15:18:10 2015 UTC,Change squads
BF_Hardline,3ahtk4,godisevol,3,Sat Jun 20 15:53:08 2015 UTC,Yes. To another squad with a bellend screaming at his kids.
BF_Hardline,3ahtk4,CertifiedTreeSmoker,4,Sat Jun 20 15:54:14 2015 UTC,I think it because PS4 has party chat and not to do with the game itself. However I do think the 5v5 game modes should not allow party chat as this gives a completely unfair advantage to those players teaming up. When you die in 5v5 it should kick you out of the team chat and into a separate communication lobby with players on both sides that have died. This would be a good way of meeting new players.
BF_Hardline,3ahtk4,coldape,3,Sat Jun 20 10:15:54 2015 UTC,Socom did this perfectly. Even with proximity chat(get close enough and it's open mics) still til this day the best tactical shooter I've ever played.

BF_Hardline,3aicz7,aGooseChase,6,Sat Jun 20 13:49:54 2015 UTC,"Then the problem becomes the map size being too big for the player count.

BF_Hardline,3aicz7,xCapTainDuLah,1 point,Sat Jun 20 15:41:17 2015 UTC,I would think that 48 players might be easier to tweak the logic around though. That could make the mode more fun even of it slows the pace a little.
BF_Hardline,3aicz7,CheapSkate23,-1,Sun Jun 21 12:49:24 2015 UTC,There is no spawn in TDM. Spawn points are random.

I've already naturally lost a lot of interest in this game for various reasons, and then when I actually do wanna go back and play, the fact that there's typically only a handful of servers that have people in my region pretty much turns me off to the game completely. I just ordered a PS4 and I'm tempted to just ask EA support for a refund so I can just get the game on there, where the population is significantly higher. Pretty sad it's already come to this."

BF_Hardline,3afb0l,CrossBones3129,24,Fri Jun 19 17:41:41 2015 UTC,I guess you could say the cost is...Premium.
BF_Hardline,3afb0l,blairmichod,8,Fri Jun 19 17:43:14 2015 UTC,yeaaaahhhhhhh!
BF_Hardline,3afb0l,crawlerz2468,14,Fri Jun 19 19:29:50 2015 UTC,"Supply and demand. So many people are buying it, so the price stays up...  Oh, hardline.. I have no idea.."
BF_Hardline,3afb0l,scarystuff,2,Fri Jun 19 18:11:05 2015 UTC,Yes!
BF_Hardline,3afb0l,SirManguydude,4,Fri Jun 19 18:35:45 2015 UTC,Because each DLC pack is still going to be $15 no matter what.
BF_Hardline,3afb0l,Jimmy8085,4,Sat Jun 20 04:22:30 2015 UTC,It's four (i think) expansion packs which will sell for $15 each. So technically it's a discount on what you are getting. Not taking into account the other bits.   They are unlikely to drop the price of prem for a long long time.   I agree with you though. It's too much for me. I have not purchased it and have no plan to do so.
BF_Hardline,3afb0l,Joey-Badass,2,Fri Jun 19 17:52:23 2015 UTC,I know it wont get a permanent drop but it should. I doubt they wanted Hardline too go from $60 to $40 permanently after a week and a half after release but it did. The premium should have dropped too.  The dlc should't be over the main game in any case unless we're talking real expansion packs like WoW gets and stuff. What battlefield gets really are just map packs.
BF_Hardline,3afb0l,Cvnomaglo,1 point,Fri Jun 19 17:59:26 2015 UTC,What battlefield gets really are just map packs.    Don't forget the inevitable over powered gun! :)

BF_Hardline,3afb0l,IlyichValken,2,Fri Jun 19 18:35:47 2015 UTC,"Premium, at least for BF3 and BF4, stayed full price for a fair length into their games' lifespan. Hardline's only been out a few months."

BF_Hardline,3afb0l,nb00288,3,Mon Jul 13 19:56:25 2015 UTC,"This has been mentioned many times, people seem to not understand the nature of premium.  Putting premium on sale would essentially be the same as putting a game on sale on week of release.  The benefits of Premium started this week (and has yet to start for PC). If they dropped the price there would be riots from everyone who bought at release."

BF_Hardline,3ai8k9,TheBrammer,0,Sat Jun 20 13:37:10 2015 UTC,"I think the problem is that the max player count in TDM is to blame for the frequent spawn trapping. If they could lower the player count to a more manageable level, that would make a HUGE difference. The more players, the more times you get trapped at spawn. The less amount of players, it becomes less frequent."

BF_Hardline,3ainn6,XxAVG_JOExX,2,Sat Jun 20 19:49:02 2015 UTC,"Thanks! I use symthic.com quite a lot, but I don't really understand what the spread means and how it affects my accuracy and precision..."
BF_Hardline,3ainn6,macaronyboy,4,Sat Jun 20 19:56:11 2015 UTC,"Base spread is how ""off"" from the center of your sight your first shot can go. This is how inaccurate your gun is to start.  Spread increase per shot (SIPS) is somewhat self explanatory, it is how much your spread will increase each shot that you fire in automatic fire mode. If your base spread is .2 degrees, and SIPS is .1 degree per shot, then the 5th shot can go up to .7 degrees off target. High SIPS encourages shorter bursts.  Spread decrease per second is how fast your spread will decrease after firing.   You can see all of these in hip fire, you start with a spread, and as you fire you get more inaccurate. When you stop firing, it takes a fraction of a second for your spread to recover.  Recoil can also determine how accurate a gun is. You can compensate for vertical recoil, but horizontal recoil is random. Level cap is wrong on this, asymmetrical H-recoil is not better than symmetrical H-recoil."
BF_Hardline,3ainn6,CheapSkate23,1 point,Sun Jun 21 12:26:07 2015 UTC,Thanks! This helps a lot :)
BF_Hardline,3ainn6,macaronyboy,2,Sun Jun 21 13:57:37 2015 UTC,"You are the same fellow I responded to in the other thread, now that is weird! Spread is like an accuracy thing and the higher your spread increase per shot, the more inaccurate your bullets will be. I can't give a perfect definition of it, I am pretty sure symthic has a section that explains every stat. Levelcap has also made some good battlefield 4 videos explaining all those things as well. I think of it like a dart board and if you are aimed at the middle there is a certain area where your bullets will land based on your spread because the guns are not going to hit exactly where you are aimed. The lower your gun's spread the higher chance your bullets will land where you are aiming. Recoil is completely different and is how much your gun kicks up or to left or right. Recoil and spread are unrelated as you can learn to control recoil, but the spread will be there regardless of what you do. It's a good stat to use to balance weapons in my opinion."
BF_Hardline,3ainn6,XxAVG_JOExX,2,Sat Jun 20 20:12:26 2015 UTC,Thanks a lot! This was exactly what I was looking for :)

BF_Hardline,3afdql,Mato87,1 point,Fri Jun 19 20:08:42 2015 UTC,Here was my last game using camera. The Block   It really is easy to get double digit numbers of coins each match. Obviously some maps are more relevant when trying to earn coins but over-all camera coins are just being handed to you.  And on note with earning coins with ease since patch. I earned x35 Ballistic Shield coins last match after joining the game half way through. So they are more ridicules in their ease of earning. Though Ballistic Shield coins can really mess with you KDR.ha (though I wasn't trying to kill anything just stand with shield as long as I could till it broke)

Premium should have never been $50 since you're getting one less map pack than previous premium, price needs to reflect this so $40 for premium.    As for current holders of premium they could compensate both for the screw up and everyone feeling like they paid too much for too little (missing gunbench, no competitive ladders etc - which to be honest I don't think will ever match the imaginative hype people have dreamed gunbench up to be) would be to issue all premium holders a 25% off code to be used on Origin (I don't know how consoles work for purchasing EA games).

Personally, I think a day delay isn't such a big deal, unlike people trying to get a full refund for the game because they had to wait 24 hours. Looks like people still can't play? Lame. Anyway, I have three ideas, varying in size:  Big idea: A new DLC or even a single map, free to premium members  Medium idea: A new gun for every class, free to premium members.  Small idea: A new patch only available to premium members acknowledging the rollout sucked, poking a little fun at themselves. Something like a smoking computer that says ""Uh-oh""."

You download the 4gb file and you fire game back up, says you need to download the maps. No matter what you do, same issue.

And have not heard from him today after he said he would let us know what's going on. I'm a huge supporter of this game, I completely love it, but it's been now 3 days going on 4, where I can't even get a sniff of the new maps, and due to this, I've lost all motivation to play the vanilla maps.

PC is having a fix update on Monday 22nd apparently but as for the other platforms we will have to wait and see as nothing specific has been announced as far as I know. Sorry mate.
BF_Hardline,3afl5m,frumpypump,0,Fri Jun 19 20:34:05 2015 UTC,"No... PC is the only platform that cannot play. PS4/XBONE is fine. People just do not know how to get their DLC added. The people who have had BF4 and other games with DLC/Premium know that when you add premium, you have to go to add on's and select the dl for that specific DLC. I bought Premium this morning and immediately was able to play because I did it right. I have been playing all day on full 64 player CA servers on PS4. The reason he is not seeing servers is because he is picking the CA maps specifically in the search. The way you find CA maps to play on is to a non-map specific search and scroll until you find one with the CA emblem next to the title. I just searched on East coast and West coast US servers only and I found about 6-10 servers with anywhere from 1-10 open slots for CA maps. They are there."

BF_Hardline,3ae86g,h0tsauce4thesoul,1 point,Fri Jun 19 16:13:44 2015 UTC,"I haven't seen it myself, but the disadvantage is supposed to be the tracer. That is, the white line of the bullet's trajectory is much more obvious and could make it easier for enemies to see your location.   Another disadvantage is the opportunity cost versus other attachments: AP rounds do nothing on personnel without armored insert."
BF_Hardline,3ae86g,blairmichod,1 point,Fri Jun 19 17:52:00 2015 UTC,"Well yeah, considering it replaces your stock for battlerifle, it's obvious the recoil is higher, but for me personally I like that the AP rounds are available for assault rifles aswell as DMRs, that's great."
BF_Hardline,3ae86g,Mato87,-9,Fri Jun 19 19:07:12 2015 UTC,"Are they available to premium only? If so that ""pay to win"" tactic is a bunch of bullshit."
BF_Hardline,3ae86g,godisevol,3,Fri Jun 19 20:10:45 2015 UTC,"no, theyre not premium only"
BF_Hardline,3ae86g,Hunter1207,2,Fri Jun 19 12:47:06 2015 UTC,"Thanks. I guess I should have asked if they were tied to the DLC, but I'm guessing that answer is the same."

BF_Hardline,3ae86g,partypete1337,-2,Fri Jun 19 13:32:21 2015 UTC,"Right now premium ia the only way for dlc. Non premium or premium, you have to payto get the ap rounds"

BF_Hardline,3ae86g,Hunter1207,-2,Fri Jun 19 13:37:35 2015 UTC,"May have not been before the question mark but look what he said. ""Is it Premium only? If it is that pay to win tactc is bullshit""  Its not premium but of you pay, you can do more damage to some people ;)"
BF_Hardline,3ae86g,CrossBones3129,-2,Fri Jun 19 14:20:33 2015 UTC,Premium only for now. Still behind a paywall though
BF_Hardline,3ae86g,CrossBones3129,-6,Fri Jun 19 14:27:45 2015 UTC,"See that's bullshit. Basically if you want to counter the AI, which should have had a counter from launch, you have to have the DLC. That's as ""pay to win"" as it gets."

I had the exact same problem, dig deep and you will find where you have to perform download. I missed the first day due to this problem.   search Battlefield Hardline in the PlayStation Store.

BF_Hardline,3aftb2,fletch420man,-1,Fri Jun 19 21:19:10 2015 UTC,"Well, that's how it goes there, the whole battlelog forum is a mental asylum where the headmasters are mods that ban people left right and center for how they feel that day, you don't even need to give them a reason, they just ban you without it. From personal experience I went through several unjustified bans on that forum, mainly because some of the mods felt that negative feedback is not welcomed there. You must gave and I must quote this ""constructive feedback"" Oh and if you mentioned anyone from the mods in a forum thread you'll get an instand ban just for talking about them power tripping and abusing their privilegies. Also don't bother sending a mail to accountdisputes at ea.com they will never resolve anything for you, it's just the same bloke over and over again with different name everytime that gives you the same old answer to your dispute  ""Thank you for contacting us regarding the action that has been taken on your account.

BF_Hardline,3aftb2,ZeroBANG,1 point,Fri Jun 19 21:33:08 2015 UTC,"to be honest the few times i looked at the BF Forums it looked like a toxic wasteland without any moderation and i didn't even want to go near it. i never really used that forum, but back when ATARI was still a thing that was the exact behavior of the Mods on the STO and TDU2 Forums.    One moderator on the STO Forum was on such a powertrip (3 or 4 years ago) after he got called out on the forum, perma banned everyone in the thread including me and it got reversed after i contacted support about it ...and the mod actually got re-assigned to another game after that thread.    It is sometimes really hilarious how these people abuse their power and actually damage the reputation of the company they are supposed to represent.    Don't get me wrong, being rude on an official forum is a no go and you got to follow the rules, that is just how it works, no matter how pissed off you are ""freedom of speech"" does not exist in that environment."

BF_Hardline,3aewom,iShades,3,Fri Jun 19 15:52:24 2015 UTC,"The new maps age great. If future DLC maps are like this I'd say it's worth it. The only reason not to get it is the last two DLCs come out in fall and winter, if you think you'll move on to Fallout or other big releases it might not be worth it."
BF_Hardline,3aewom,gardenlevel,4,Fri Jun 19 16:07:12 2015 UTC,No it is not. It would be a wonder if by the time the second DLC drops people still play this game :/
BF_Hardline,3aewom,INFsleeper,2,Fri Jun 19 17:12:21 2015 UTC,"Game = $40 Premium = $50  I just posted this, http://www.reddit.com/r/BF_Hardline/comments/3afb0l/why_is_premium_still_so_high_game40_premium50"
BF_Hardline,3aewom,CrossBones3129,2,Fri Jun 19 17:48:04 2015 UTC,"I'm going to actually answer your question about the maps being worth it and say yes. I love each of the new maps. Visceral put a lot of thought into making them diverse from each other, and playing on different modes (Conquest, Blood Money, Bounty Hunter) drastically changes the dynamics in each map.  What platform are you on? If you're on X1 or PS4 and can't stop playing the vanilla maps, getting Premium is a no-brainier as there are plenty of players on these platforms that will definitely last through when all the DLC releases.  Don't forget: a lot of people left BF4 when it launched due to horrible netcode issues. Now, many have come back with all the improvements and Premium sales. I wouldn't be surprised if something similar happened with Hardline later this year when even better sales drop."
BF_Hardline,3aewom,PurpsMaSquirt,2,Sat Jun 20 14:34:47 2015 UTC,No not in my opinion. There seems to be a pattern with battlefield titles in that once they release it will take at least a year for the game to work in the exact way in which it should. So I personally wouldn't call it value for money or worth buying unless it was £20 or less however there are a lot of people who are really are enjoying it so its down to your personal preference. Just don't be surprised if you regret spending your hard earned money on something that vaguely works.
BF_Hardline,3aewom,frumpypump,2,Fri Jun 19 16:08:12 2015 UTC,just got a full refund from ea for deluxe edition due to it being bugged and no access since the 16th of new content. took a while on the phone but worth it. so no it's not worth buying IMO

The ideal squad members will.....  -Be 18+  -Play around the same time I play. 9pm-3am EST  -USE MICS (when I play serious, I want my squad to use mics.  -Spot Enemies. Seriously.... This is more important to a dedicated team than you think.  -Play the objective, and provide for their team. If you're gonna be a medic, Lay out healthpacks, and revive. Mechanic? repair vehicles, lay out some spawns, hook us up with some grappling hooks. Sniper? cameras are an EXTREMELY effective tool. use them. Etc...  -Be mature, well experienced, and a decent player. I'm not looking for players with a 3.0 K/D Ratio. just team players.   Keep in mind....   I'm an adult. not an 18 and under player. Which means I have real life issues to attend to. that said, I don't play all the time. I work, I spend time with my girl, and i take care of myself. i do play maybe 3-4 days a week for maybe up to 3 hours a session. but other than that, don't expect me to always be on.   Also, My profession involves me being a team leader. So thats what I do by nature. I'm analytical, Smart, and efficient. By agreeing to play with me you must understand that I may give orders to direct gameplay but its always to help us strive as a team.   I'm a drama free person. and when I say that, I mean it. so leave the BS elsewhere.   TL;DR- If you're looking here, as opposed to actually reading my message, I don't want you on my team.   Interested? Leave a reply with your PSN, and tell me a little about yourself. First name, timezone, what classes you play with, what type of player you are, and your favorite weapons/gadgets   I look forward to playing with some new people :]  ps- I apologize for the long message, If it's a problem ill get rid of it."

No different than running and gunning with a sniper rifle.. should we complain about sniper rifles not shooting fast enough in cqb next? :rolleyes:   i swear, the complaints on this subreddit are so ridiculous i had to make an account to argue with you people. ive been lurking for the past few months. shoulda registered sooner."
BF_Hardline,3af2af,SkimSTi,-1,Fri Jun 19 19:42:29 2015 UTC,"Easy buddy. Just stating my opinion. No need to get overly aggressive. I understand that SMGs are intended for cbq, and are very effective at doing so in this particular game. It was just nice to have another smg that was effective at shortish-medium range, similar to how the ump-45 has a minimum damage of 20. That's despite the point that I didn't think the mpx was even in need of a nerf in the first place, though."

BF_Hardline,3af2af,CookieDoughCooter,2,Sun Jun 21 15:26:10 2015 UTC,"They're probably still the best tbh. All they did was add some horizontal recoil to them. I haven't personally used them much post-patch, but I don't think it's anything unmanageable."
BF_Hardline,3af2af,TehDarkArchon,1 point,Mon Jun 22 02:03:44 2015 UTC,I love this gun. I used it a little bit on the DLC and didnt notice a big difference. Probably only close quarters though.
BF_Hardline,3af2af,maxcatz34,1 point,Fri Jun 19 16:38:20 2015 UTC,"It's the same at point blank, but much worse at range.   This is a problem because the gun was never good at point blank and was a long range SMG by design. Now, the gun is good at nothing hence why it is useless.  Although the gun is still viable, other subs are better at every other role and there is no reason to use it."
BF_Hardline,3af2af,blairmichod,1 point,Fri Jun 19 17:54:07 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say useless, it got a major nerf, due to whiny brats that whined about it being overpowered, same with k10, which got a major nerf too with the latest patch. The gun is still usable but at medium ranges you literally can't kill anyone, especially if they have armored insert."

BF_Hardline,3af2af,colers,1 point,Sun Jun 21 15:33:32 2015 UTC,I wonder what their reasoning behind this was. I don't remember anyone complaining about the MPX. I sometimes wonder how they even make these decisions. Clearly they don't play the game enough themselves to know about the balance so a lot of it must come from the players. Yet no one asked for an MPX nerf. Maybe they just took some meta data on the most used guns and nerfed them.
BF_Hardline,3af2af,Nikotiiniko,2,Fri Jun 19 18:38:32 2015 UTC,are you on drugs? everyone complained about it being OP... it was a matter of time til they nerfed it after the whole k10 thing.    doesnt bother me though... have 3500 kills with it prepatch lol so im ok with using other guns.
BF_Hardline,3af2af,SkimSTi,1 point,Fri Jun 19 18:58:09 2015 UTC,"Exactly, it was clearly the K10 replacement that everyone fell on once the K10 was nerfed. Comparing apples to apples, the MPX clearly outclassed every other SMG and was due for a nerf."

Plug your PC into your TV or just use streaming, plug in a controller or use a mouse/keyboard rest on your couch. Problem solved. Console is in no way more living room friendly.

With a console, you plug it in where you want, pop the game in, and sit down. What you're suggesting might be a living room friendly pc setup, but it takes at least twice as much work before you can enjoy yourself.  As for the free and discounted games, you have a point. That does add up over time. But both major consoles have free games every month, as well as massive flash sales that drop the prices on games heavily.

What I did say: The console community is more populated for FPS games in general, and especially for Hardline. If MP is a draw for a consumer, this is a pretty valid point.  You might be paying more to game on a console at lesser performance than a PC, but you can't deny the convenience. I have to buy various cables and adapters to get my  PC and controllers working together on my TV, or I can just buy a console and plug in everything from one box.  So I go back to my original point: there is nothing wrong with wanting to play on a platform that is more convenient and has more players (at least with Hardline)."
BF_Hardline,3actbt,PurpsMaSquirt,-3,Fri Jun 19 13:22:13 2015 UTC,"What I did say: The console community is more populated for FPS games in general   LOL! No, no it is not. Not even close. There was just 10 million concurrent users ON STEAM ALONE the other day. The PC platform absolutely dwarfs the console platform. Hardline is the one exception to this.   You might be paying more to game on a console at lesser performance than a PC, but you can't deny the convenience. I have to buy various cables and adapters to get my PC and controllers working together on my TV, or I can just buy a console and plug in everything from one box.   No, no you do not. You literally just plug your PC into a TV via an HDMI cable. Then, plug in your 360/xbone/PS4 controller into your PC. WOA, IT MAGICALLY WORKS. PCs are not rocket science."
BF_Hardline,3actbt,JarekBloodDragon,3,Fri Jun 19 13:31:06 2015 UTC,PC guy here - Hardline is through origin and not steam. The console community for Hardline dwarfs its PC counterpart.
BF_Hardline,3actbt,Mastaking,-2,Fri Jun 19 14:23:09 2015 UTC,As I said.   Hardline is the one exception to this.   You don't waste $300-400 on a console for one game with terrible controller aim. Every thing else on origin has much bigger PC communities than on console.
BF_Hardline,3actbt,JarekBloodDragon,2,Fri Jun 19 14:45:09 2015 UTC,"10M users on Steam? Cool. Sony sold over 20M PS4s in its first six months.

Oh wait, we were talking about Hardline. Go to BFHStats.com. Go to BF4stats.com. PC doesn't beat out console populations across the board, and this is evident in that publishers tend to market to console gamers.  Back to convenience: if PCs are so convenient to use compared to consoles, then how come the market hasn't flocked to using them in the living room?  You are still missing my original point.

Steam has 130 million active users with 10 million on at any point of the day. The amount of steam accounts far exceeds that. STEAM ALONE has more users than all three current consoles COMBINED. That doesn't even talk about the plethora of games that do not use steam like all EA titles, MMOs like guild wars, or F2P games with their own launcher.   Aside from Counterstrike (which isn't even available on all current consoles)   Because no one wants to play a competitive shooter that requires extreme precision with a controller, CS has a huge competitive scene that nothing on console matches, and more importantly valve does not like the console platforms.   show me an FPS on every platform that PC wins.   Literally every single multiplat shooter aside from hardline. Even within the BF franchise, every other BF game has far more users on PC than consoles.    PC doesn't beat out console populations across the board, and this is evident in that publishers tend to market to console gamers.   Yes, yes it does, by a lot. PC does not have a Sony or a Microsoft or a Nintendo to advertise for their platform how ever. You're not going to see a ""BUY A PC"" advertisement on TV because it's an open market. You see PS4 and Xbone stuff all over because sony and microsoft pay these companies to put PS4/Xbone all over it and console fanboys like you eat it up. For some reason defending a company that rips you off. Tell me why a publisher/dev would advertise for one specific platform instead of all of them? They'd lose money this way. Instead, the money sony/microsoft pays them must make up the amount of money they'd lose. This is how timed exclusives work.   Back to convenience: if PCs are so convenient to use compared to consoles, then how come the market hasn't flocked to using them in the living room?   Your entire argument is ""I haven't seen it so thus it doesn't happen."" Plenty of people do this. Ever heard of steam big picture?   there is nothing wrong with preferring console gaming to PC gaming.   There's every thing wrong with it. You're supporting paying more for a closed platform that does nothing but hurt the gaming industry and give you a worse gaming experience. Literally being a bad consumer."

Certainly is impressive, but again until you can show me hard numbers I have a hard time believing PC has more players on any one of the more recent FPS games also available on all platforms, which was the original argument in the first place.  And really about controllers? No one wants to play with one? That is definitely your opinion when you look at the console market, much like how many would say they prefer gaming on a console. Funny how opinions work.  But you know what is actually wrong instead of a gaming preference? Your attitude on this thread that is about enjoying Hardline. Next time you decide to label me and other gamers as bad consumers and dumbasses, think about how your elitist attitude reflects on the PC-master-race community to the rest of us gamers.

BF_Hardline,3adb0s,BillyHoWCR,1 point,Fri Jun 19 07:58:42 2015 UTC,They had fixed it just prior to the patch but it appears it has returned again. There is an issue with assignments not showing all the requirements Even some assignments I have completed have the requirements past the first one blanked out.  Now if you are seeing ???????????? then that is something completely different. And what system are you talking about? In game or Battlelog?

Only way I can see that happening is by offering Origin game time for hardline, may be for 10 hours or so. This would allow more users to try hardline and may be even buy if they like the game after playing for 10 hours.

You select the gadget slot and see a kennel in front of you(red if it can't be placed, green if it can) when you place the kennel it becomes solid and you enter the controls for a dog. The dog sprints for 10 seconds, and is a one-hit kill. You can't slow the dog down, and when the time expires it disappears leaving only its collar behind. There is a 60-second reload period. The criminal dog starts as a pitbull and police have a German Shepard but if you complete the K9 assignment you can unlock the chihuahua."

They should have tuned the weapons a bit sooner. As for Premium, it is absolutely disgraceful that it has taken until now for them to release anything. And it doesnt even work. The fact that no one really knows what gun bench is still shows how badly planned this was. If you have premium features you need to make them available from the start. Dont expect any compensation at all. I had my fun playing the game, but I want DICE back."

This would be as good a time as any to give them to everybody, it would actually help the games reputation a bit and more weapons are badly needed anyway, so there are 3 more weapons right there that are already done and don't need any work.    and i guess some double XP wouldn't hurt... although XP is too easy to get in this game anyway...    personally i don't need any compensation, i just want them to get their shit together, fix that DLC, answer to the concerns about the game and give us an official timetable for the Premium features that we have yet to get (Gun Bench!).

The build can't have changed that much from CTE to live...    but seriously, it is one fuck up after another for the PC version, first they release it next to GTA5 (GTA5 = black hole that sucks any PR attention away from everything else), then 6 weeks of CPU spikes thx to Punk Buster and once that is finally fixed the Servers are already pretty empty... then this first DLC is released in the middle of the E3 news hype (awesome timing, the next Black Hole that will suck any attention away from your little game), not even the Battlefield YouTubers are reporting on Hardline because they are all doing Star Wars Battlefront E3 Trailer analysis stuff... rofl! Then Visceral fucks up the release on PC... 3 days, still unplayable, no info what is going on from the Dev's either... (they were all over Reddit on launch, where are they now?) and to top it off the playerbase is still dead and we now have the Premium luxury of looking at empty servers for 2 weeks until the rest of the remaining players can even get the DLC. AND still no word on the Gun Bench, that we were told would release with the first DLC.    i bought premium because it is simply cheaper than buying the DLC one by one, not because of some timed exclusivity bullshit.    i'm not even angry... i just feel bad for them... it is like watching a crippled kid struggle with something and fail repeatedly.    and sorry a double XP weekend or a Dog Tag/Camo won't fix E3 stealing any possible hype."

People have add/adhd, either don't have time for it, etc... I won't be completeing certain assignments simply because I dont have time for it.   So I can agree that they should make certain assignments less complicated. However, these kind of assignments depending on what you receive, have been in Battlefield in general for a while.

If people want to play for months to years down the road and achieve this, let them. Even some of the in-game assignments are ridiculous.

BF_Hardline,3ad5er,blairmichod,1 point,Fri Jun 19 17:28:52 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure why Visceral doesn't like 64 man Crosshair and Rescue servers. I'm on PS4 and would never get to play these and probably wouldn't even like it, but I think the onus is on the player to decide what she wants to play."
BF_Hardline,3abqra,naulsballs,3,Thu Jun 18 20:27:43 2015 UTC,"Excellent idea. Criminal Activity added a ton of fresh air for me. The new enforcer weapons are a blast to use & we all know the game already needed more maps with its fast paced action. I doubt you'll find it cheaper since it wasn't included on the current/past sales. This leads me to believe we won't see a premium option marked down for existing players until sometime after all DLC is released. Just a guess, though."
BF_Hardline,3abqra,skillfactor,1 point,Thu Jun 18 21:35:31 2015 UTC,"Appreciate the responses, based on them I'll buy it since I think the game's fun, but lacking content without the DLC. It's a shame these companies are charging so much for an incomplete game out of the box without DLC, oh well."
BF_Hardline,3abqra,CookieDoughCooter,1 point,Thu Jun 18 23:49:21 2015 UTC,You're certainly on the best platform to get the DLC. PC players can't even find populated servers for some game modes.

BF_Hardline,3abqra,CookieDoughCooter,1 point,Thu Jun 18 22:19:25 2015 UTC,I believe it's extremely rare for them to cut the price of premium on consoles. I don't think I ever saw it done on BF3 for PS3.
BF_Hardline,3abqra,PurpsMaSquirt,0,Sun Jun 21 15:27:40 2015 UTC,"Picked it up yesterday and am loving the maps. Really digging Black Friday's dynamic on Conquest. The Beat has a unique urban feel, and running around with the Nail Gun in the Code Blue Club is super fun. Visceral put thought into these maps.  The new Enforcer guns are great (albeit perhaps a bit too powerful) and are giving me reason to use the class more.   Bounty Hunter is fun twist on TDM that adds in a bit of strategy.  Can I also say I LOVE that for each playlist you can play vanilla, CA or a mix of everything? Finally I can play on all maps without having to back out!  Looking forward to the next DLC packs, and PS4 has plenty of players to keep the game alive until the end of the year no problem."

BF_Hardline,3acxho,PoppaDR3W,2,Fri Jun 19 02:23:57 2015 UTC,I found that sometimes if you don't set it to look for any particular map they will come up along with the list of vanilla maps but otherwise the server search is busted. There are tons of servers running the maps but they are not searchable.

BF_Hardline,3ab4l2,killary_klinton,1 point,Thu Jun 18 20:21:07 2015 UTC,That seems like a reasonable number. If you had said 50 or 100 hours then it might be hard to get your bank to go along with the reversal. Maybe they don't look into it in that much depth.

I've never taken a game back to Best Buy & asked for a refund because it sucked... they'd probably turn me down anyway, haha. We both know the game will be up & running as fast as possible on PC like it was with consoles. What was once just DLC also became a giant patch on release day and it was a nice surprise. Requesting a chargeback immediately after Criminal Activity dropped & owning the game since it came out seems a bit ridiculous & low on your part."
BF_Hardline,3ab4l2,skillfactor,10,Thu Jun 18 18:49:14 2015 UTC,What? He paid for the DLC and didn't get it when it was promised. That's a 100% perfectly correct reason to get his money back.
BF_Hardline,3ab4l2,skillfactor,-2,Thu Jun 18 20:50:23 2015 UTC,He bought the DLC before the release date was announced.. which was made official a whole week ago. lol. Seriously? Okay..
BF_Hardline,3ab4l2,blairmichod,2,Thu Jun 18 21:18:44 2015 UTC,I did the same thing with BF3 and BF4 Premium and those have delivered in spades. Based on that precedent I assumed that Hardline Premium would do the same.
BF_Hardline,3ab4l2,TehDarkArchon,-2,Thu Jun 18 21:40:56 2015 UTC,"Right, if you skipped the horrible launch & bought BF4 a year later with access to everything at once. Hardline has only scratched the surface of its Premium content, being that we're only a month or so into its original 6 month long as-advertised-plan not including all of the constant spoiling of double XP you've already reaped the benefits of."
BF_Hardline,3ab4l2,Cramer02,3,Thu Jun 18 21:54:48 2015 UTC,"I agree that the OP is doing the wrong thing, but every theater I've ever been to has allowed refunds, full if you leave before the movie is halfway over."
BF_Hardline,3ab4l2,skillfactor,2,Thu Jun 18 21:34:36 2015 UTC,"I sympathize with the OP mainly because of the abbysmal player count on PC, something that would've been hard to predict from the get-go. Despite whether or not he enjoys the content, it doesn't really matter if there isn't a sufficient player base to enjoy it in.   To OP, I would really advise trying to get a refund through EA support and use your bank as a last resort."
BF_Hardline,3ab4l2,skillfactor,4,Thu Jun 18 22:43:08 2015 UTC,"Hes not wrong, if he wants to get a refund he is entitled too do so. He may not get a refund for the base game but its likely he will be able to get a refund on Premium if he has it."
BF_Hardline,3ab4l2,Richard_Ramrod,-2,Thu Jun 18 19:47:46 2015 UTC,"I've totally left a bad movie and asked for a refund. I'd rather have my money back as opposed to my ""pride"" for sitting through two hours of some crap. As I said, it's not just the problems with CA that caused me to want a refund (Naval Strike also faced problems in BF4 and I didn't ask for a refund on that) but also the absent Premium features which have not been discussed since before release.  Also why is it acceptable to pay for bad products and not ask for your money back when it comes to video games. This is probably the only industry where there mindset is that if you pay for something broken you should suck it up and wait. I've never heard of people doing that with physical goods."
BF_Hardline,3ab4l2,tentoesup747,-2,Thu Jun 18 18:52:12 2015 UTC,"Do your research by reading reviews and renting the game or borrowing it first but once you commit to buy.. its yours. That's how retail has always worked and why marketing even exists. There's a sucker born every minute. Your case is especially ridiculous because you've invested enough time for them to have actually earned your money.. this is more like finishing a crappy meal at a restaurant and then wanting your money back because you didn't like it. Not cool, bruh"

BF_Hardline,3abbd7,Made_While_Shitting,6,Thu Jun 18 18:36:06 2015 UTC,"Depends on what you like. Since you already have bf4, why not try Hardline? Or if you like 4 so much - go for its premium edition."
BF_Hardline,3abbd7,vesko18,1 point,Thu Jun 18 18:49:18 2015 UTC,"I have BF4 Premium and was getting a little tired of it by the time Hardline came out. Can't stop playing since release. It doesn't replace BF4, but it is a nice breath of fresh air to the point I am sad this could be a standalone title.  BF4 Premium goes on sale frequently, whereas Hardline does not quite yet.  If you are getting tired of BF4, pick up Hardline.   If you can't stop putting hours into BF4, you can't go wrong with Premium. DICE did a fantastic job on the DLC maps. However, just keep in mind you won't get the full value of Premium since you already bought two rounds of DLC.  Depending on when the sales end, you could always Redbox Hardline for a few bucks. Cheap demo that will give you your answer."
BF_Hardline,3abbd7,PurpsMaSquirt,2,Thu Jun 18 23:14:54 2015 UTC,"This is how I feel. Sorry, but BF4 just doesn't appeal to me anymore after almost 2 years, and when I played Hardline it's something fresh and different."

BF_Hardline,3abbd7,PoliticoG305,-3,Thu Jun 18 23:02:23 2015 UTC,DO NOT FUCKING BUY HARDLINE. Might be the worst AAA shooter in over a decade.

BF_Hardline,3abbd7,DANNYonPC,-7,Thu Jun 18 18:37:25 2015 UTC,"I dont like BF4, go for BFH"
BF_Hardline,3abbd7,Orphanlast,-4,Thu Jun 18 18:52:37 2015 UTC,"Not sure which to buy. BFH is on sale right now on PS4 store for $30 & BF4 Premium is $40.    You gotta think about this. This is the second time they've tried to rebalance things and fix the TDM spawns with Hardline. Each time it has been a dismal failure.  This is Viceral's first Multiplayer game and they don't seem to be figuring out how to ballance the game.   I only have the first two map packs for BF4 so I'd be getting 3 new packs out of the premium.    Go Battlefield 4.   Also saw that BF4 player count is higher than BFH.   That's because Battlefield 4 is closer to being a finished game and Hardline has outdated glitchy netcode, shitty weapon ballance, no destruction, and ir generally the inferior game.   So which one should I buy considering player count, game/map quality etc..   Battlefield 4"
BF_Hardline,3aaxie,K_S_REDF1RE,6,Thu Jun 18 16:55:49 2015 UTC,"To unlock weapons you have to do assignments. These assignments have names like Professional Syndicate, Operator Syndicate, and so on. The syndicate assignments have prerequisite assignments that you must complete before you can start the syndicate assignments. I use this site to see what the assignments are, prerequisites, rewards, etc:  Hardline Assignments  The tier system is also explained on that wiki:  Reputation Tiers.  As you play a match you earn points towards the next reputation tier. If you die, the points you have earned towards the next tier reset and you have to start over. If you die when you are Tier 3 and you are half way to Tier 4, when you respawn you will still be Tier 3 but won't have any points in that tier. You can see your current tier and a progress bar towards the next tier underneath your health, ammo, etc. in the lower-left corner of the screen. The tiers are represented as 4 boxes (empty at first).  Stars are earned as you play a certain class. You need 275,000 points to earn a gold star for a class. If you go to the Agent page on Battlelog you can see your current class scores towards the bottom of the page."
BF_Hardline,3aaxie,FalconiiLV,-1,Thu Jun 18 17:31:23 2015 UTC,Ah thanks for explaining the Rep Tiers
BF_Hardline,3aaxie,Troy_Davis,3,Fri Jun 19 06:16:32 2015 UTC,"In Battlefield, besides playing the game, there's some achievements/assignments to make everything fun while playing, which usually award you with weapons, patches, or gadgets.  Some are pretty simple, and reward basic unlocks. Others are far more complicated, but the reward is greater/more satisfying.  This list gives a decent breakdown of the various achievements/assignments.  Also, on [battlelog](battlelog.battlefield.com/bfh/), you can track your progression as well as in game.  The first thing I'd like to explain is Service Stars... Service stars are basically an award for classes/guns/vehicles that give you an additional incentive in cash by accumulating points for that class/gun/vehicle. Speaking strictly for classes, after you've gained 10,000 points, you will have Bronze Service Star 1. The next 10,000 will unlock Bronze Service Star 2. There's 10 bronze service stars. The next group is Silver, which require 15,000 per and there are also 10. Last is Gold, which requires 25,000 points per. All in all, I believe you need 275,000 points to unlock your first gold service star. (Note: Hotwire points only count towards the class if you're in the van or the tanker.)   Back to unlocking the .300 Knockout... There's actually a few steps to get to it.   The prerequisites are:   Professional Assignment 2  10 Professional specific guns and/or gadgets purchased  Unlock Professional Gold Service Star 1   So, the first one is where you should really focus. In order to unlock Professional Assignment 2, you need to complete Professional Assignment 1. In order to meet the prerequisite for Professional Assignment 1, you need to unlock the Bronze Service Star 2 (20,000 points as a professional.) Once you've achieved that, the requirements are 10 Sniper Rifle kills and 5 Trip Mine kills. I can't give you any real advice but to go out there and just do it. For trip mines, I've had all my luck on TDM.  Once you've completed Professional Assignment 1, Professional Assignment 2 is just as straightforward. It requires 25 Sniper Rifle kills, and 10 camera coins. To earn camera coins, you need to equip the camera as a gadget. What the camera does is ""spots"" enemies for your teammates, puts an arrow/dorito over their head, and allows your teammates to kills them. These kills will give you intel assists. The way you earn coins is via intel assists from your cameras. For every 10 intel assists, you will receive 1 camera coin (it's actually incredibly easy now that they fixed them. I got 10 in 1 round last night.) My advice is to go to Blood Money or TDM, set them up in popular areas (facing the enemy's vault or the cash pile), and just allow your team to pile up points.  Now, this will give you the first prerequisite for the Professional Syndicate to unlock the knockout. The next is pretty straight forward... just purchase all the guns and gadgets and you should have enough. The last one is also straight forward now that you know what service stars are. You will need about 275,000 points.  Now you should be able to view the requirements for Professional Syndicate.    200 Sniper Rifle kills Unlock the Professional's tier 4 Reputation track in 10 different matches 15 Camera Coins 15 Marksman Coins   Marksman Coins are earned based on the distance of your headshots. For every 250 meters TOTAL in headshots, you earn a coin. It does not have to be 1 headshot, but they all have to add up to/above 250.   The tier 4 reputation track is kind of hard to explain. Basically, you earn reputation based on your points gained per life. I don't know the exact numbers for each tier, but I think around 7,000 or so in one life should get you there. Easy way to do it is in hotwire, or have a hacker give your squad upgrades."
BF_Hardline,3aaxie,Troy_Davis,-1,Thu Jun 18 17:38:51 2015 UTC,"Damn, thank you for detailed response. So for the professional class I have gotten a silver star. Does this mean I already got the ""Bronze star 2"" right? Also, what sniper do you recommend using? Do the semiautos count or the M1A1? Thanks"
BF_Hardline,3aaxie,mylilponyranger,2,Fri Jun 19 06:15:49 2015 UTC,"Yes for the service star. You can also see after each round how many points do the next level of each service star.   For sniper preference, it all depends. The scout is definitely preferable over the R700 for a majority of people. However, I prefer the semi-auto DMRs.No, the M1A1 does not count."

BF_Hardline,3a9dw7,macaronyboy,-2,Thu Jun 18 17:54:19 2015 UTC,"No humble brag at all. Has nothing to do with any skills of mine. It really is easy to get 10,000 in a single match with Hacker.   And with use of proper boosts then would imagine even non-hacker would be less then difficult in many cases.   I would think halving the requirement to 15,000 instead cutting 2/3rds of the requirement from the earning would have been more prudent."

But normally I would die instantly or if I moved too much while in the tree area.  Not sure if they have simply found an area that allows you to survive or I was ending up in areas that I simply couldn't survive? But supposedly the map boundaries had been tweeked. Might be that yet again... tweeking has created new issues?

But in bfh theres just no reason at all to use anything other than m416,akm,k10,mpx,870p,scar,sar58,fal and 300 knocout."

And the design choices and bugs aren't the main problem. No,  the main problem is Visceral's seeming unwillingness or inability to address them, months after release.   WTF has the armoured insert not been nerfed heavily, for instance? As far as I'm concerned that issue alone demolishes any semblance of balance. And as others have pointed out, repeatedly, there are lots more.   Maybe a miracle will happen and EA will slash the price substantially and CTE will replace the standard client.

The armored insert is ridiculous, but it affects all weapons.  FAL is a great weapon, but it also has a lot of recoil to compensate for the high DPS. Sar51?  Sure, some other weapons are also somewhat OP, but they have drawbacks. There is a reason why everyone is running Operator with M416/M16.  What's your most used weapon?"

The only reason m416 seems op is because the best infantry players use it, its like the ace 23 in bf4, its not the best weapon stat wise, but good player tend to gravitate towards medic and jack of all trades kind of weapons.  Just look at esl one players, best players in the game use those guns. Fal is op, plain and simple, sar51 is a really good weapon that should win every trade at almost any range vs m416 http://symthic.com/bf-hardline-ttk-btk-charts?enforcer=1&operator=1  The problem with this game is like 10 weapons that are above all the other guns in the game. My most used weapons are akm and m416 and i have a 3.1 kda and in bf4 i have 3.5 kda."

Close range/mid range that gun is still incredibly stupid. The gun balance is still so terrible in this game, you just have to use whatever is OP for your class to stay competitive."

BF_Hardline,3a9pp0,olitae,0,Thu Jun 18 16:17:21 2015 UTC,"The only reason m416 seems op is because the best infantry players use it   Far from it. Literally everyone is using them. You'll see most average 1K/D gravitate towards the weapons that have the best balance of ease of use and dps, which is the M416/M16.  There are literally 4 times the people on the leaderboards for the M416 compared to any other weapon. That alone is an indication that not only ""the best"" use them.  They are nothing like the ACE23 in BF4. The ACE23 is a real jack of all trades weapons, but it could easily be beaten at close to medium range by guns like the Famas, Scar-H or AEK.  Also, TTK doesn't take recoil or spread into account, so that argument doesn't hold.  Of course you are against nerfing it if it's your most used weapon."
BF_Hardline,3a9pp0,olitae,2,Thu Jun 18 12:33:06 2015 UTC,"I dont everyone using in fact, the baddies spam a lot more the mechanic class because is just spray and pray class while having double the health.

While enforcer guns can compete at almost any range against it http://symthic.com/bf-hardline-ttk-btk-charts?enforcer=1&operator=1  In pc is really easy to control the recoil and spread of any gun, so if u are good enough that doesnt really matter.  I dont give a fuck if they nerf it, i will find the next best gun in the game and spam it, i had over 3 kda in all bfs before over all the nerf and buffs that have happened as i said 3.5 bf4, 3.1 in bfh and 4kda in bf3.

BF_Hardline,3a9pp0,wda_exodus,2,Thu Jun 18 18:25:01 2015 UTC,Yep.
BF_Hardline,3a9pp0,DAGam3r,1 point,Thu Jun 18 21:35:31 2015 UTC,"They either need to decrease the start damage to 24   am i the only one who absolutely hates that retarded 24dmg model in BF4? so many times i start shooting first (at least on my screen), do land my shots and die with the killcard saying the guy has 4hp left. That only feels to me like the netcode (i shot first!), the damage model and eventually the Rate of Fire differences teamed up against me, not like the other player was better.    stop trying to turn Hardline into BF4."
BF_Hardline,3a9pp0,DAGam3r,5,Thu Jun 18 12:53:45 2015 UTC,"I have to disagree with you too; I much prefer the BF4 damage model over the one we have now. I've watched a lot of console gameplay of HL and I think that the damage model there is good because, in general, it's harder to be as accurate, control recoil, turn as fast, etc. with a controller vs. m&k. On PC I would've much preferred the damage model they had at the end of the second beta (24 max dmg ARs and carbines.) Again, this is all subjective and there's plenty of people on both sides of the debate, but for me personally gunfights aren't nearly as satisfying and fun in this game as BF4."
BF_Hardline,3a9pp0,olitae,5,Thu Jun 18 16:58:37 2015 UTC,We've asked for seperate gun profiles for PC.
BF_Hardline,3a9pp0,BowlerNona,2,Thu Jun 18 18:58:56 2015 UTC,"Really? That would be pretty cool. It would sure go a long way in putting the fight back into gunfight.  I think you're onto something there. Is there a legimate possibility of this happening, in your opinion?"
BF_Hardline,3a9pp0,olitae,3,Thu Jun 18 19:55:44 2015 UTC,"They said it would be easy to do.  Here's what happened.  One of their devs who plays console primarily, but plays PC some, explained that TTK is drastically more on consoles because most people tend to fire while aiming and that by the time they start hitting, they've wasted a bunch of bullets.  This makes guns like the K10 not so OP because they have to reload more.  We explained that it's much easier to get on target and aim more accurately on PC which makes the weapons more effective and appear to be overpowered.  We proposed the idea of a multi-branch patch that included PC specific gun profiles.  He said it would be easy to do, but it could be a tough sell because the PC guys (developers) think, for the most part, that TTK is about where they want it to be.  To add to that, I agree to a point.  I like the TTK where it's at and with the amount of weapons we have I'd hate to start swinging the nerf/buff hammer at everything, because you begin to make everything the same.  Unfortunately there has to be a ""best"" gun in the game and I'd prefer that guns have their own character.  I also believe that good players perform well regardless of what gun they use and that with practice anyone can do well with any weapon.  You just have to be willing to learn it's quirks and cater your gameplay accordingly."
BF_Hardline,3a9pp0,BowlerNona,2,Thu Jun 18 21:29:28 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the quick reply. While I agree with a lot of what you said, particularly the difference in console vs. pc mechanics, and that there almost invariably has to be ""a best gun"", I don't think that's the heart of the issue. At least not for me. I think the issue is the TTK overall on PC. I'm sure some people will disagree, and that's totally fine. Different strokes for different folks. But with the TTK as it is, I think it deprives people of the sense of accomplishment and investment they get when they have to work for a win in a gunfight. I also don't think the instant deaths promote a feeling that your opponent truly got the better of you because they were better.  Kinda like Whack-A-Mole: See mole, whack mole, win encounter with mole. Yeah you won, but was it really rewarding? Even worse if you're the mole. Pop your head up and boom. Insta-wacked with no real chance of defense or retaliation. Bit of an exaggeration, maybe. But not that much.    He said it would be easy to do, but it could be a tough sell because the PC guys (developers) think, for the most part, that TTK is about where they want it to be.   I think this is the crux of the problem. They made the game, and I fully understand that they want to see their vision for the game realized, which is commendable. I do, however, think the time is fast approaching that they're gonna have to, out of necessity, re-evalute their vision for the game (on PC) and realize that it's not working out. I see posts and videos with people saying things like, ""It's just not as fun, and I just can't put my finger on why, exactly"", and I truly believe it comes back to the TTK, in a lot of those cases.    I like the TTK where it's at and with the amount of weapons we have I'd hate to start swinging the nerf/buff hammer at everything, because you begin to make everything the same.   Fair enough, but are they really that different now? Maybe on paper, but discounting the pretty rare cases of extreme range being a factor, it plays out as instant deaths vs. super duper instant deaths.   Just my opinion, and maybe I'm totally off base. But I do legitimately want to see the game succeed on PC, and it's looking kinda bleak right now, sadly."
BF_Hardline,3a9pp0,olitae,2,Thu Jun 18 22:58:45 2015 UTC,I agree with that 100%.
BF_Hardline,3a9pp0,BowlerNona,2,Thu Jun 18 17:59:16 2015 UTC,"The more bullets you need the skilled the game is, u need to control the recoil longer, and maintain your aim. Its like comparing hardcore and normal mode, normal is more skilled cuz of that."
BF_Hardline,3a9pp0,ZeroBANG,1 point,Thu Jun 18 13:24:48 2015 UTC,I'm gonna have to disagree with your statement in it's entirety.
BF_Hardline,3a9pp0,ZeroBANG,1 point,Thu Jun 18 14:53:25 2015 UTC,Why? explain urself.
BF_Hardline,3a9pp0,RICExTANK,1 point,Thu Jun 18 15:58:34 2015 UTC,"The more bullets you need the skilled the game is   The longer the time to kill, the slower your reaction time can be.  The more leeway you're granted to watch horizons, blind corners, and react   u need to control the recoil longer, and maintain your aim.   While technically true, I argue against this being used as justification for your core argument.   Its like comparing hardcore and normal mode, normal is more skilled cuz of that.   Hardcore is more difficult and demands more skill.  You have to check corners (campers can instant kill you), watch out for sniper spots (one hit kills require strategic use of smoke, flashes and Molotovs), use flanking strategies and cover fire (crossfire will allow you to push the enemy into positions that allow you to get hits while they're behind cover.  Cover fire will allow your teammates to push up while their behind cover as if they poke out they'll die very quickly).  To imply that a shorter TTK makes a game less challenging/competitive I'd challenge you to play Counter Strike.  I would argue that a shorter TTK motivates the players to find out what strategic points they're able to get to in certain periods of time OTB (off the break) to allow them better angles of fire are observation.  Also, forcing players to bring up the minimap manually to locate enemies leaves you vulnerable.  I quite like hardcore (particularly rescue)"

Just as the last 2 months says something about visceral as a game studio- in short words- they are not very good at all, ande on top of that they are not improving (which is the difference between DICE and visceral)."
BF_Hardline,3a6kfi,fletch420man,4,Wed Jun 17 21:42:54 2015 UTC,Hardline had a solid launch. A lot better than BF4's. But to say this takes the cake rather than a company taking over a year to fix a game and then handing it over to another studio (DICE LA) to finish is absurd.
BF_Hardline,3a6kfi,Gamer9131,2,Wed Jun 17 21:45:52 2015 UTC,"If you think bfH launch was a dream you must have been one of the m416/k10/m16 princesses, just cause the fucking game launches doesn't make it fucking worth a fuck.

BF_Hardline,3a6uc5,BillyHoWCR,2,Wed Jun 17 18:08:42 2015 UTC,"I think a better solution would be to keep the 1 point per bullet and instead count the 25 points you get for a shield kill as part of the 100 needed.  So you could deflect 50 bullets, get 2 kills and you'd get a coin.  Or 3 kills 25 bullets.  Would encourage close battle aggressive use of the shield.  Would be easy enough to get them without having to grind."
BF_Hardline,3a6uc5,Midnight06,0,Thu Jun 18 14:56:31 2015 UTC,Seeing that Ballistic Shield coins are also a pain I wouldn't see that as a fix. The recent game I went x18 coins I got I think zero Ballistic Shield kills... though I tried.   I don't know what the fix for it should be right now. But the current coin earning is ridicules. When I get 5 coins after getting shot and and killed in like 4 seconds and think I am actually seeing some glitch when they pop-up after I spawn then... thinking the allocation of coins now is just ridicules.

I did hurt my KDR, but I never cared about it anyway. I earned a crazy 13,530 points in the game and I even joined it mid game.

BF_Hardline,3a6uc5,ACovers,0,Thu Jun 18 20:38:45 2015 UTC,"Ha... it's not just too easy... it is a new Booster route now. As you can see the time it took me to earn 5 coins was a blink of an eye. At 200 points each, that blink of an eye turned into 1000 points.   If people choose to go Boosting route they can easily do this 100 times in a game earning 100,000 points from coins and then the 2 added Bounty bonuses... and you can see how lucrative it has became to Boost. Add ammo box to the equation and it becomes even larger. So they effectively have created the biggest new Boosting farm tool simply because they wanted to make it easier for us to get a specific coin?   I mean really... not a huge issue for sure, but why create any further issues when just properly addressing the first issue could have been done?  Same with Camera coins which actually weren't difficult in the past... but now I can earn an easy 15 coins per match without breaking a sweat.   What is the purpose of any of these coins if they are just going to treat them like sonic Rings? ;)"
BF_Hardline,3a6uc5,ACovers,2,Thu Jun 18 04:16:44 2015 UTC,"Not saying your points are moot, but they look less credible when you exaggerate things like ""getting 15 coins in a match without breaking a sweat"". Just a heads up."
BF_Hardline,3a6uc5,ACovers,-1,Thu Jun 18 14:16:18 2015 UTC,"Not an exaggeration, though I didn't fair very well in the match (best of the worst though... ha) the coins came very easy. http://battlelog.battlefield.com/bfh/battlereport/show/2/611140219515330496/975700/  The other team ran right through us but still enjoyed the match."

BF_Hardline,3a75vl,Troy_Davis,5,Wed Jun 17 20:10:12 2015 UTC,"I haven't played heist yet to confirm, but if this is true then that is a welcome change. If you can hold them off for the full ticket count then you win bravo... but if the team gets one secured on you then they're rewarded by getting ""reinforcements"" to go after the second package.  It gives the team incentive to fight to try to secure a package until the very last second, because they know if they get that one package they have a shot at the the second."
BF_Hardline,3a75vl,RedTerror98,1 point,Wed Jun 17 21:17:59 2015 UTC,"On the other hand it doesn't reward fast gameplay from the criminals which is the main idea, right? In, out, they never know what hit them. Instead, it now would heavily favor a complete playstyle shift and honestly it's something that's never going to happen in a public game."
BF_Hardline,3a75vl,tyler2k,3,Wed Jun 17 22:08:27 2015 UTC,"I don't see how giving the criminals longer to take the loot takes away any reward for fast gameplay. As it is now there is now ""reward for fast gameplay"" for the criminals other than winning sooner."

BF_Hardline,3a8dt6,BillyHoWCR,0,Thu Jun 18 04:03:21 2015 UTC,"And it is appearing they are expressing their feelings with the downvote button?   The issue is you used the term OP which in most all categories of talk equates to a gun being so good it is broken and needs to be nerfed. (and note, you even called it ""...freaking OP!"")  The gun talked on here is far from being the best in game so hard to say that it is OP. Yes it appears you did well in the video kill wise, but noticing encounters you could have done equally well or better with other guns offered in game against same enemy confronted in this video."
BF_Hardline,3a8dt6,BillyHoWCR,-1,Thu Jun 18 04:58:19 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply. That was nice straight to the point comment. I usually play with SMGs and sometimes HCAR. When I play with HCAR or SMGs, I usually end up finishing the match with 2-3 k/d ratio. But then I tried the FAL today and i was constantly on a killing spree, finished 4 matches with 6-7 k/d ratio. That's why it felt OP to me. Maybe the gun is well suited for my play style or it was because they patched the netcode? Anyways, I guess I probably shouldn't have used term OP thus I apologize if I made you guys angry."
BF_Hardline,3a8dt6,Tboe013,0,Thu Jun 18 05:17:18 2015 UTC,Not sure if you made anyone angry (might have though some people on the subreddit are very sensitive) but maybe might have simply pushed the reaction button with key wording used?
BF_Hardline,3a8dt6,Devo5220,-1,Thu Jun 18 05:28:29 2015 UTC,Exactly... had he had the M416 in each of these encounters then he likely would have done as well or better. Seeing his long distance encounters he wasn't able to quite carry through with as many kills.

BF_Hardline,3a5pct,Djbboy,1 point,Wed Jun 17 13:16:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah i did, if i go to the store it says i have it. There is no option to buy just start the game."

BF_Hardline,3a5pct,Visceral_TO,1 point,Wed Jun 17 13:42:46 2015 UTC,"If you look at CA in the in-game store (Main Menu -> Store -> Criminal Activity), does it have it listed as ""INSTALLED"" on the panel on the right side when you highlight it? The only reason you should see that behavior is if you don't have it installed or you are not Premium."
BF_Hardline,3a5pct,Djbboy,3,Wed Jun 17 14:45:28 2015 UTC,"When i highlight CA it says free next to it and when i click it it goes to the store but says no content found.

BF_Hardline,3a5pct,N-Shifter,1 point,Wed Jun 17 15:12:28 2015 UTC,"I have the same problem from Australia. The game on PS4 on the main title page states v1.05.28.01 where on a working Xbox one it says v1.05.28.02 this is the only difference I have seen between the 2. I am premium member, have the content already installed, yet the game will not detect the dlc. Also tried to force look for new update, says the game is on latest update. Quite a few people from around the world have same issue, posted on battlefield forums. All seem to be on PS4.  Edit: Other things I've noticed, in the listed addons the content still shows as pre order but timer is no longer counting down, when doing quick match and selecting bounty hunter, it pushes to the built in hardline store, CA says free, not installed, but clicking on it goes to a page where it says content not available."
BF_Hardline,3a5pct,Djbboy,2,Wed Jun 17 15:27:52 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the info, i'll look into this as soon as I get into the office as it's still early in the morning here."

Hope we can sort this out"

If there is anymore info you need please ask, been pulling my hair out for hours trying to work it out, but that version thing on the main title screen was the obvious one.

BF_Hardline,3a5pct,Visceral_TO,1 point,Wed Jun 17 15:42:35 2015 UTC,Any luck ???
BF_Hardline,3a5pct,Djbboy,1 point,Wed Jun 17 22:31:36 2015 UTC,"We're still working on it, been a chaotic day with the PC patch not going right. I've also forwarded the problem you (and others) are seeing along with the video /u/Reckless_Onion posted to the people that handle our submissions so they can contact Sony to see if anything is going wrong with their Store.  I know it's a bit to ask, especially if you have any sort of bandwidth caps, but have you tried uninstalling and reinstalling it again? I'm wondering if you picked up the DLC in some sort of grey area and managed to get an older version."
BF_Hardline,3a5pct,Djbboy,2,Thu Jun 18 00:15:39 2015 UTC,"So i re-downloaded the whole thing, just woke up to check and the same issue is still present. I did however unlock the guns trough battlelog create a class by buying them on there. weird shit."
BF_Hardline,3a5pct,Djbboy,1 point,Thu Jun 18 07:09:32 2015 UTC,I think it's premium. I think that's what the issue is. Just by mucking around with things I think that's where the issue lies. I think somehow it's glitched premium hence why it goes to look for DLC but prompts us to download even though it's there. How I see it anyway.
BF_Hardline,3a5pct,Djbboy,1 point,Thu Jun 18 08:13:13 2015 UTC,"Yep I've had the exact same problem, on PS4, bought ultimate edition, saying no content found but can purchase CA weapons on battlelog on PC and use ingame but cannot play new maps or new game modes. Have deleted and reinstalled, contacted ea and Sony and am waiting for response. I think it may be people who bought ultimate but that's just a guess.Really hope this gets fixed soon.   :-("
BF_Hardline,3a5pct,Djbboy,1 point,Sat Jun 20 21:40:51 2015 UTC,"Tbh when I woke up in the morning and didn't see a reply from yourself I just went a head and deleted the game. So I'm on the painful road of downloading the 50 odd gig again which does suck, and will only suck more if it doesn't fix it. I will let you know how it goes. Seems to be an issue all over the world as there is a bunch of people with the issue over on the official battlefield forums with same problem.   Hopefully, it solves the issue. Will keep you updated."
BF_Hardline,3a5pct,INFsleeper,1 point,Thu Jun 18 01:35:14 2015 UTC,"Small update just for the sake of change of situation. The 50gb download pushed out to like 47 hours and I just was not gonna wait that long. We over this way don't have the luxury of fast internet everywhere so yeah I just went to local shop and bought a pre owned copy of the game to install. The update is downloading now, and then I'll add the content. Hopefully this all works and solves the issue."
BF_Hardline,3a5pct,Djbboy,1 point,Thu Jun 18 05:19:35 2015 UTC,"Well it's simply just messed up. Reinstalled every single aspect of the game and it just will not detect the DLC at all. Wasted so much time and effort on this to pretty much get the same exact result.   I have no idea what to do from this point on, and really hope there is some news on this soon cause it kinda just ruins the experience without having any kind of idea as to what's going on.

It seems based upon the threads i am reading, every person has the Ultimate Edition, digital version. Each person i have seen whom has this edition on PS4 seem to be popping up more and more as time goes on. Few times it has been asked on the battlefield twitter, and also has been pushed to Zac Mumbach, but yet to hear from him just yet.  Hopefully we can get some kinda idea on whats been done here. Currently there is a 4 page thread of angry PS4 users awaiting some kind of news as to what exactly we can do to get this sorted. Hopefully we hear back from you soon mate."
BF_Hardline,3a7q20,SlimeyStuff,3,Wed Jun 17 21:52:47 2015 UTC,It probably won't be worth it because there are so little players on pc.
BF_Hardline,3a7q20,cutlerf,1 point,Wed Jun 17 22:56:15 2015 UTC,"The Frostbite Engine will get DX12 for sure, EA is pushing the engine hard into all their games now (which is awesome, because i sure as hell have seen more than enough of the Unreal Engine 3 over the past decade).    The real question is if it will be worth it to update older games like BF4 and Hardline to newer builds / version numbers of the Frostbite Engine and how long the support for the individual games will last anyway.    I would be disappointed if Star Wars Battlefront or the EA games that just got announced at E3 Mass Effect, Need for Speed etc. would still be on DX11."
BF_Hardline,3a7q20,ZeroBANG,1 point,Thu Jun 18 00:50:00 2015 UTC,"The Frostbite engine will most likely get DX12 support but unless new code is written/new art assets created to take advantage of the new features there won't be much of a point. I really doubt that Visceral will have any time to put new art in at this point.  This is also why despite using DX11, lots of low quality games look like they're DX8/9. New DXs add on features/streamline existing features for the most part, not make existing art suddenly look better."

BF_Hardline,3a5d8f,killary_klinton,5,Wed Jun 17 10:33:14 2015 UTC,"I noticed most people still running armored insert which made ap rounds mandatory. But yes, the FAL is great"
BF_Hardline,3a5d8f,pp3001,3,Wed Jun 17 11:46:23 2015 UTC,"Have you personally played the FAL yet?  It's recoil is brutal.  It's a very powerful gun, but honestly, unless you go semi-auto on it long range shots become very difficult.  Up close I can see how it would be quite effective, but the other battle rifles hit like trains too."
BF_Hardline,3a5d8f,wda_exodus,2,Wed Jun 17 13:58:48 2015 UTC,"Recoil is a bitch, but it is shooting a very hot 7.62 round and if you can land the shots on target then the target is going to fall pretty quick."
BF_Hardline,3a5d8f,RedTerror98,2,Wed Jun 17 15:34:05 2015 UTC,"I think it's completely stupid for them to only have one class in each expansion since that means everyone will be playing the same class to get unlocks done.  If it's supposed to be a team game with people filling different roles it would be nice to spread the new weapon/gadget love around a bit.  This month, nobody will ever run out of ammo.  Next month, everyone will be healing, etc.  It's pretty lame."
BF_Hardline,3a5d8f,Harkonis,4,Wed Jun 17 17:00:23 2015 UTC,everyone will be healing   I wish. Operators hardly ever do their job.
BF_Hardline,3a5d8f,Kdj87,2,Wed Jun 17 18:27:22 2015 UTC,"It's just because it's new and a lot of people are trying it out. Statistically, it is pretty close to the other battle rifles. It has a slightly higher rate of fire than the SA-58, slightly longer range, and more vertical recoil. There are other differences, of course, but those are the highlights. I suspect that people will find out how good all the battle rifles can be after using the FAL."
BF_Hardline,3a5d8f,FalconiiLV,3,Wed Jun 17 17:06:07 2015 UTC,Bf Hardline is my fav BF since Bad Company 2 and the DLC is just insanly good. All the weapons are perfectly fine and the new maps are also awesome. Best game ever.

This game is dreadful in so many ways. It has a few good points, but not enough to compensate.   But I'm glad other people are managing to enjoy it!

BF_Hardline,3a7en2,Troy_Davis,2,Wed Jun 17 23:29:28 2015 UTC,"40-14, you're probably dying too much between tiers."
BF_Hardline,3a7en2,panteranegraftw,-1,Wed Jun 17 21:15:43 2015 UTC,what? since when did dying interrupt tiering?
BF_Hardline,3a7en2,Troy_Davis,7,Wed Jun 17 22:27:12 2015 UTC,"Since always, you die, the progress if your current tier gets reset."
BF_Hardline,3a66my,iPoopRainbow,3,Wed Jun 17 15:20:28 2015 UTC,"Yes, in two weeks, i guess.    Premium = Two weeks early access to all four expansion packs"

BF_Hardline,3a66my,jonah63,2,Wed Jun 17 15:44:34 2015 UTC,depends on how good of friends you have

BF_Hardline,3a6znv,INFsleeper,2,Wed Jun 17 18:50:56 2015 UTC,Same
BF_Hardline,3a6znv,elfez,1 point,Wed Jun 17 19:53:28 2015 UTC,I don't believe the deluxe edition includes premium. AFAIK it is the Ultimate edition which includes premium.
BF_Hardline,3a6znv,N-Shifter,1 point,Thu Jun 18 22:12:25 2015 UTC,My mistake it is the ultimate edition that I bought and I definitely have premium.

BF_Hardline,3a6wl3,isamudragon,0,Wed Jun 17 19:16:50 2015 UTC,you're one of those assholes that snipes out of bounds on the hill. At least learn to play in the area ALL players can get to
BF_Hardline,3a6wl3,BillyHoWCR,2,Wed Jun 17 21:35:21 2015 UTC,Your bullet can get to him. Just shoot him. Easy.
BF_Hardline,3a6wl3,lyrprophet,1 point,Thu Jun 18 04:50:12 2015 UTC,I hate playing Dust Bowl and spotting 5 guys sitting on the hill out of bounds. Snipe if you wanna snipe but sitting out of bounds is cheap as fuck.
BF_Hardline,3a4bpt,Yourpoop,8,Wed Jun 17 03:10:12 2015 UTC,"I believe if you hold down the trigger after you fire and don't release it, the bolt won't cycle? You get to keep that nice view of your target"
BF_Hardline,3a4bpt,Slayerx44,6,Wed Jun 17 04:08:10 2015 UTC,I thought the whole point of the straight pull bolt was to chamber the next round without having to stop aiming. I am almost positive what you described is exactly what happens when you don't have a straight pull bolt on
BF_Hardline,3a4bpt,LaMonaca14,2,Wed Jun 17 06:22:32 2015 UTC,He described exactly that.  I run with magnum rounds now.
BF_Hardline,3a4bpt,TheRealSnoFlake,2,Wed Jun 17 14:30:14 2015 UTC,"I was convinced it was a glitch. It didn't happen in every match for me for some reason, but it did happen in a few and it drove me insane. Just jerking to the right after every shot. I thought I was getting rolled over to get stabbed the first time. X1 here"
BF_Hardline,3a4bpt,SchlongGarage,1 point,Wed Jun 17 10:08:39 2015 UTC,I tried it yesterday and it sucked.  Why even straight pull?  It worked for the scout elite though.
BF_Hardline,3a4bpt,mylilponyranger,2,Thu Jun 18 15:00:57 2015 UTC,"Good, anything that makes sniping harder is a good thing."
BF_Hardline,3a4bpt,GOpencyprep,1 point,Wed Jun 17 15:20:26 2015 UTC,"I just got done playing some rounds and the Scout I used behaved exactly as it did prior to patch. No such issue as you mention.   I am playing on x360 though, and you don't mention a system?"
BF_Hardline,3a4bpt,BillyHoWCR,1 point,Wed Jun 17 12:20:53 2015 UTC,seems to only be with the AWM
BF_Hardline,3a4bpt,Grazsrootz,1 point,Thu Jun 18 06:53:00 2015 UTC,"I think it was meant to stop the spamming from the Scout.  I like it though, realistically you couldn't hold a perfect sight picture while cycling the bolt. I think it adds some fun back in to bolt actions."
BF_Hardline,3a4bpt,RedTerror98,0,Wed Jun 17 15:38:13 2015 UTC,"Fun fact: I was testing out various snipers last night and this animation doesn't happen with the scout elite, or the cop's sniper 200-something it's called, it only seems to happen with the AWM that I know of (it could happen with the knockout too) which is fucking stupid."
BF_Hardline,3a4bpt,SchlongGarage,2,Wed Jun 17 15:48:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah. I believe it was only happening when I was using the AWM, and the animation looks stupid. Makes you look 45 degrees to the right. I think it's broken and not meant to be like that."
BF_Hardline,3a4bpt,RedTerror98,1 point,Wed Jun 17 15:52:04 2015 UTC,"I think it was meant to put AWM snipers at a disadvantage as the AWM is the second most powerful next to the Knockout, but it still uses 2 body shots like any other sniper so I don't understand why this is in place and I doubt it's a glitch as it seems fully animated."
BF_Hardline,3a66a2,Cheprenudaeus,1 point,Wed Jun 17 15:17:51 2015 UTC,I was just playing vanilla this morning at it was packed. Check your settings?

BF_Hardline,3a6t0b,Cramer02,2,Wed Jun 17 18:13:54 2015 UTC,Well first you pay and maybe one day you will get it. It is an BFH addon that shows white screen saver.
BF_Hardline,3a6t0b,nightbass,1 point,Thu Jun 18 11:34:59 2015 UTC,Noo theyve added a new DLC you now get a Frozen loading screen its beautiful

BF_Hardline,3a4k92,TheNameIsFrags,2,Wed Jun 17 04:25:10 2015 UTC,how are you even playing i cant find any CA servers on ps4
BF_Hardline,3a4k92,Grazsrootz,1 point,Wed Jun 17 05:41:14 2015 UTC,Afraid of that. Idk if Premium will sell good. I've seen 2 full servers in US. Bout it.
BF_Hardline,3a4k92,CrossBones3129,1 point,Wed Jun 17 06:09:12 2015 UTC,I was only able to find private servers running it. So far I haven't seen any visceral servers running it. I don't understand this.
BF_Hardline,3a4k92,cutlerf,2,Wed Jun 17 08:05:47 2015 UTC,"im on PC and i cant even install it, i have premium"
BF_Hardline,3a4k92,JulianJanganoo,3,Wed Jun 17 06:16:52 2015 UTC,It's not released until tomorrow at 8am PST for PC.  They delayed it.
BF_Hardline,3a4k92,itisi52,-1,Wed Jun 17 07:00:26 2015 UTC,"Which i still see as utter bullshit, you dont delay a patch for a full day only on one system if you know the problem."
BF_Hardline,3a4k92,Cramer02,-2,Wed Jun 17 10:36:52 2015 UTC,But bro... It's not like they delay PC patch for Console Users because PC Certification takes just as long as console! Oh wait... That is exactly what they do. -_-
BF_Hardline,3a4k92,pandaridingatrex,0,Wed Jun 17 10:39:55 2015 UTC,PC has origin certification
BF_Hardline,3a4k92,DANNYonPC,0,Wed Jun 17 11:34:33 2015 UTC,Origin's Cert is 2 weeks. One of the dev's even said so on a podcast with Dontrevivemebro.
BF_Hardline,3a4k92,pandaridingatrex,1 point,Wed Jun 17 12:02:06 2015 UTC,How much did you get premium for?
BF_Hardline,3a4k92,naulsballs,1 point,Wed Jun 17 04:38:25 2015 UTC,i think i payed 40 for it a few months ago if i remember correctly
BF_Hardline,3a4k92,Grazsrootz,1 point,Wed Jun 17 05:46:18 2015 UTC,Glad to have you back.
BF_Hardline,3a4k92,wda_exodus,-3,Wed Jun 17 14:04:58 2015 UTC,This patch is garbage. Haven't been able to play the new maps. Right now can't even get the mutliplayer menu to load on Xbox One. Infinite spinny circle of doom. Earlier when it was kind of working didn't see a single server with new maps and Conquest. WTF?
BF_Hardline,3a4k92,RunOutTheClock,0,Wed Jun 17 07:07:55 2015 UTC,"I had that problem, do a hard reset it fixed mine"
BF_Hardline,3a4k92,Fytt,-1,Wed Jun 17 07:58:56 2015 UTC,Seemed to do the trick. Didn't think to do it since I disabled instant-on and do hard resets all the time because it's like Windows Vista like that.
BF_Hardline,3a3l76,Mayor_S,5,Tue Jun 16 23:25:06 2015 UTC,"Just to elaborate, the issue that hit CA this morning was able to be remedied on consoles but not PC. As such, we have to create a new patch with the fix and will be updating tomorrow.   I understand if it's frustrating, it is for us too."
BF_Hardline,3a3l76,Visceral_TO,1 point,Wed Jun 17 01:34:43 2015 UTC,What exactly happened? I'm intrigued?
BF_Hardline,3a3l76,CrossBones3129,6,Wed Jun 17 02:06:59 2015 UTC,"I'm Ron Burgundy?   In all seriousness, it was an issue under the hood that was preventing people from connecting to servers in the live environment. It wasn't happening in our test environment which is why it went unnoticed until today."
BF_Hardline,3a3l76,Visceral_TO,2,Wed Jun 17 02:25:19 2015 UTC,Guess you guys didn't get around to fixing all the invisible barriers. Everglades is still full of them.

BF_Hardline,3a3l76,aSheepamongWolves,3,Wed Jun 17 03:05:12 2015 UTC,Such a slap in the face to the PC playerbase. The one where this franchise started. Im going for my Premium refund.

BF_Hardline,3a5kea,DANNYonPC,4,Wed Jun 17 12:03:28 2015 UTC,MPX is really not good anymore. They went a little bit overboard with the nerf imo. i agree it should have been touched a bit but not this much. I'm pumping a full clip in people at slightly further ranges and they dont drop.
BF_Hardline,3a5kea,Reckless_Onion,2,Wed Jun 17 12:59:56 2015 UTC,"I don't use the MPX but I never felt it was OP by any means, atleast not on PC. It baffles me that it was nerfed harder than the M416/M16. But it might be a different story on consoles."
BF_Hardline,3a5kea,pp3001,2,Wed Jun 17 13:55:47 2015 UTC,"It was one of the only functional SMG's for variable range work, as in...if you wanna play Mechanic on any outdoor map, you probably wanted the MPX for the Cops.   The other weapons had awful damage dropoff, awful rates of fire, awful magazine capacities...sometimes they had any two of these things. The MPX had a good dropoff curve, a 15 min damage, a 30 round mag at 800 rpm or so.   It was actually good, when all the other SMG's save for the UMP and P90 were essentially home-made lead slingers in comparison."
BF_Hardline,3a5kea,K-26,1 point,Wed Jun 17 14:16:47 2015 UTC,"Because you're comparing it against other OP guns. You compare the MPX against the UZI, M/45, or the MP5K and you'll then get a frame of reference how OP it actually was.  One of the major complaints with Hardline is weapon balance, so it's good it's slowly being reworked."
BF_Hardline,3a5kea,tyler2k,1 point,Wed Jun 17 14:53:23 2015 UTC,"I'm comparing it against all the guns. Of course there are going to be guns that are worse than the MPX, but there are 2 guns that are blatantly better, and they didn't get as big of a nerf as the MPX."
BF_Hardline,3a5kea,pp3001,1 point,Wed Jun 17 14:56:25 2015 UTC,I experienced the same issues. Try the FMG it is now my favorite SMG.
BF_Hardline,3a5kea,ElementR,3,Wed Jun 17 13:20:06 2015 UTC,the uzi and the m/45...im actually getting kills with them now
BF_Hardline,3a5kea,Tboe013,2,Wed Jun 17 12:54:55 2015 UTC,Uzi actually seems decent in that 8-16 meter range now. Didn't notice much difference in the M416/M16 unfortunately.
BF_Hardline,3a5kea,the_smegma_of_christ,1 point,Wed Jun 17 13:12:50 2015 UTC,Yeah the Uzi feels pretty good now. Haven't tried the m46 yet
BF_Hardline,3a5kea,ma70jake,2,Wed Jun 17 16:20:20 2015 UTC,"Uzi seems better, used it a bit on Code Blue last night. God, I love the sound of it."
BF_Hardline,3a5kea,ETuesday,1 point,Wed Jun 17 13:44:05 2015 UTC,Zach told us last night the UZI received a lot of love.
BF_Hardline,3a5kea,wda_exodus,2,Wed Jun 17 13:59:57 2015 UTC,"The M/45 is usable but more importantly, it's fun as hell! It's just oddly satisfying to use, try it out!"

BF_Hardline,3a3o9l,illusion_1,13,Tue Jun 16 23:51:10 2015 UTC,Lack of quick patches + lack of premium incentive + high price + small amount of guns/equipment + BF4 spring patch = low player base
BF_Hardline,3a3o9l,SRAWBrah,8,Wed Jun 17 00:34:45 2015 UTC,But all of those points go for console too and we have a healthy amount of players. We can even get rescue going at any time which is awesome.
BF_Hardline,3a3o9l,Nikotiiniko,5,Wed Jun 17 01:15:58 2015 UTC,"He missed one of the biggest factors - huge abundance on PC of better/cheaper alternatives to Hardline.  Also here's some interesting info...population decline percentages across all platforms 03/29/15 vs 6/07/2015:  PC: 84.65%  PS4: 73.04%  XBox One: 79.54%  PS3: 60.64%  XBox 360: 67.15%  Average/Total: 75.24%  So proportionally most platforms are ""dying"" at the same rate, PC isn't anything special."

BF_Hardline,3a3o9l,Nikotiiniko,6,Wed Jun 17 01:42:54 2015 UTC,I don't think BFH caught on for PC.  It's a fun console game though.
BF_Hardline,3a3o9l,renegadecause,3,Wed Jun 17 00:27:46 2015 UTC,"Everyone keeps saying this, but never really explain why..."
BF_Hardline,3a3o9l,klonkish,5,Wed Jun 17 14:33:10 2015 UTC,"because there is not really an alternative to hardline on consoles right now... ""fun"" fact- there are now 2200 players playing BC2 on PC, HL count is 2700"
BF_Hardline,3a3o9l,exec774,2,Wed Jun 17 17:56:03 2015 UTC,"Why don't console players play BF4, like PC players?"
BF_Hardline,3a3o9l,klonkish,2,Wed Jun 17 18:17:49 2015 UTC,"well, they kinda do"
BF_Hardline,3a3o9l,exec774,2,Wed Jun 17 18:25:06 2015 UTC,I still don't understand why you say that there's no alternatives to hardline if most people play BF4...
BF_Hardline,3a3o9l,klonkish,1 point,Wed Jun 17 19:20:11 2015 UTC,"well yea, there's that, and COD titles and that's about it for next gen consoles as far as FPS go... on the other hand, on PC you have millions of titles, often extremely cheap(BF3 was free, or you could buy BF4 for less than 10€, CS:GO for 7€) or even free(Insurgency for example), so if people are not satisfied, there's no real reason not to move to something different"
BF_Hardline,3a3o9l,exec774,4,Wed Jun 17 20:42:17 2015 UTC,"I loved the game when it first came out, I mean, it really is a fun game, but it doesn't have the feeling of depth or immersion that previous BFs had.  Plus, the weapon grind/system is just terrible and annoying.  It's annoying to unlock a solid weapon as a cop then to switch teams and have some shitty shit that you don't even like."
BF_Hardline,3a3o9l,CactusWillieBeans,2,Wed Jun 17 03:32:34 2015 UTC,"Yeah the cross-team unlocks sucks, but at least the unlocks per gun are much much easier to get than in 4. Dat grind just to use the sight I like? I'm here to play, not to grind."
BF_Hardline,3a3o9l,DarthPneumono,1 point,Wed Jun 17 08:00:59 2015 UTC,there need to be more than 160... are you filtering out the full servers?    for BFH i think showing the full servers and joining into the queue is more useful than it was with BF4 -> you may actually get to play the game mode / server you like that way.
BF_Hardline,3a3o9l,ZeroBANG,1 point,Wed Jun 17 00:44:24 2015 UTC,My only filter is NA servers only.  http://s22.postimg.org/8m5zzauhd/1212121.jpg

BF_Hardline,3a3zn9,Tyruz,1 point,Wed Jun 17 15:01:20 2015 UTC,Browse servers. Somebody's got a 24/7 CA server.
BF_Hardline,3a3bpr,naulsballs,6,Tue Jun 16 22:10:09 2015 UTC,"Yep. I was gonna post the exact same thing with the exact same title.. But I have been demolishing people with it all day.

BF_Hardline,3a3bpr,ipawilzon,4,Wed Jun 17 00:20:26 2015 UTC,"Said perfectly, it's just right for a syndicate weapon. If it had a slightly higher rate of fire, then it would definitely be OP."
BF_Hardline,3a3bpr,macaronyboy,3,Wed Jun 17 01:42:06 2015 UTC,Definitely going for this weapon now.
BF_Hardline,3a3bpr,blairmichod,3,Wed Jun 17 10:24:14 2015 UTC,"Me, too! Fortunately, it's one of the easier class syndicate assignments to complete and the only I think that should complete organically."

BF_Hardline,3a3wdi,GregoryGoose,3,Wed Jun 17 01:25:53 2015 UTC,"Well to be honest you guys already have those things littered throughout the map, frequently placed right where you'd need them anyway.

BF_Hardline,3a3wdi,FalconiiLV,1 point,Wed Jun 17 03:52:46 2015 UTC,"Take a page from BF3 xbow and/or scoped xbow. Takes a gadget slot, fires regular (high damage up close), balanced (one shot kill to the head at long ranges), explosive, and scanning bolts. Replace scanning bolt with zip line and you've got a clear winner."
BF_Hardline,3a3wdi,GregoryGoose,1 point,Wed Jun 17 18:59:55 2015 UTC,"Did you guys actually change anything about the damage of the zipline like OP is suggesting? Or maybe the targeting system? The main problem I had before using it aggressively is that the player needs to be within the up/down-forward/back limitations and in between you and an anchoring object. Too much to go wrong. If you allowed players to be targetable themselves, that would make it a very interesting weapon."
BF_Hardline,3a3wdi,Visceral_TO,4,Wed Jun 17 02:44:50 2015 UTC,Nothing changed there that I'm aware of

BF_Hardline,3a4wxk,DANNYonPC,1 point,Wed Jun 17 10:38:31 2015 UTC,Battlenonsense videos are totally related to bf4 CTE. I just want to know about what netcode changes have been brought into bf hardline in the most recent patch.
BF_Hardline,3a4wxk,wda_exodus,2,Wed Jun 17 10:44:19 2015 UTC,"Visceral programmed all the netcode improvements for BF4 from the beginning.  You may not know that little fact.  Regardless, they crossed over to Hardline even though, originally, they said they weren't going to do it.  BF:H and BF4 retail are at the same level now, supposedly."
BF_Hardline,3a4wxk,P33KAJ3W,2,Wed Jun 17 14:03:20 2015 UTC,"No, they arent on the same level. Updaterates based on fps has only been implemented in BF:H (in the recent patch) but not in BF4 (see spring patch notes for yourself). This is the main thing everyone needs to understand."

BF_Hardline,3a4wxk,DANNYonPC,1 point,Wed Jun 17 14:45:04 2015 UTC,"Theoretically BF:H should be better, because it allows you to update the server (projectiles only for now) based on the framerate of client."

BF_Hardline,3a5xoa,e5mikey,7,Wed Jun 17 14:10:41 2015 UTC,"They can't ""offer Hardline as DLC"" because it's its own stand-alone game. I know that has been the running joke, but it's getting kind of old.   That being said, I think Hardline is kind of done on PC, and I expect it will be on console too once a lot of the big games hit later this year (I imagine that its last expansion pack coming out this winter will be the least played exp pack of any game ever, but I digress.) I speak as someone who was super excited about HL prior to the launch, and then who gradually lost interest which bottomed out around the 100 hour mark. I still check back and lurk the forums to see any new developments or content though. I believe the game is already down to $30 on Origin and it still hasn't seen a boost in players, so I'm not really sure what the next move here will be, if any."
BF_Hardline,3a5xoa,TehDarkArchon,0,Wed Jun 17 15:01:46 2015 UTC,Wow- this is about perfectly on point about this game- enjoy the upvote-

BF_Hardline,3a5xoa,TehDarkArchon,0,Wed Jun 17 15:28:05 2015 UTC,"If the community wasn't so fucking awful then this game would be a lot more successful. A bunch of fucking morons started since the game's announcement saying it should be DLC for BF4, even though we had premium for BF4, we knew what DLC we would be getting and we paid for it accordingly, therefore why the fuck would this game be DLC. It's a genuinely fun game, and everyone is forgetting that when BF4 was released, it was broken to shit, especially on PC. The Battlefield community is so god damn toxic that when a couple assholes start saying don't buy this game, everyone else follows. To me, this is the most fun I've had on Battlefield since BC2, and that's because I didn't listen to all the nay-sayers. If more people did the same, I think more people would have enjoyed it. Honestly I don't think it was given a fair chance, man. It's something different and to me BF4 was starting to get old anyway."
BF_Hardline,3a5xoa,BlitzKraig1,2,Thu Jun 18 15:10:56 2015 UTC,"I agree that this game has had unwarranted negativity since the get-go, and that there's a large portion of the community that is toxic, but my complaints of the game were totally irrespective of that. Also keep in mind that this game had a much stronger player base at the beginning which has decreased substantially. During the first 2 weeks, you could find tons of servers running every mode. Now, I have to connect to foreign servers if I wanna play 32 man BM, for example. So this tells me a lot of people share my sentiments. But would this game have done better without all the negativity? Absolutely. I don't feel that BF4s launch problems are relevant anymore, since it's now one of the best FPS titles I've ever played. Just because HL didn't have any core issues at launch doesn't make it a better title."
BF_Hardline,3a5xoa,TehDarkArchon,0,Thu Jun 18 17:16:15 2015 UTC,"You play on PC right? I'm not saying that people shouldn't dislike this game, because if they do that's fine with them, but they're disliking it for the wrong reasons. To me, BF4 was closer to ""DLC"" for BF3 than Hardline is for BF4. I like some of the changes made. If Hardline was never made, I'd probably still play BF4 more often, but I welcome the changes that were made to the franchise, its refreshing. And I agree that BF4's launch problems aren't relevant now, but I do want to remind people that it sucked so badly when it was released, and with proper tweaking a lot of things can happen to a game to make it better. I think no one gave Hardline a chance, and the circlejerk around the internet made it so much worse. A lot of the time I don't even see people's reasons for disliking the game. They just say it sucks, it should be DLC, etc. But never tell me exactly what they don't like about it. That's why I really kinda hate the BF community."
BF_Hardline,3a5xoa,BlitzKraig1,2,Thu Jun 18 17:21:18 2015 UTC,"Yep I play on PC. It seems like this is a common trend with a lot of games. People find solace in forming a cult of hatred towards certain games, and then the cool thing to do is to hate on it. If you go to the BF4 sub, anytime hardline is mentioned theres literally 200-300 posts just hating on it. It's an unfortunate part of the gaming culture that's been cultivated."
BF_Hardline,3a5xoa,TehDarkArchon,1 point,Thu Jun 18 17:54:22 2015 UTC,"It's also a huge part of this sub. Instead of just avoiding it, people come here to shit on it. I think it's the same with a lot of games though, for example COD. Advanced Warfare was super different, so much so that a lot of hardcore COD fans hated it (I loved it for a change). But everyone who historically hated COD say its more of the same. Basically, people who play video games are assholes unless you look really hard for the ones that aren't, hahaha."
BF_Hardline,3a5xoa,BlitzKraig1,2,Thu Jun 18 18:04:36 2015 UTC,Such an idiotic suggestion.
BF_Hardline,3a5xoa,Mayor_S,-7,Wed Jun 17 14:25:05 2015 UTC,"the game's dead EA is the publisher, they could easily drop the price of HL to around $10 for any person who owns bf4 on Origin.  Without something drastic like this, the game is dead."
BF_Hardline,3a5xoa,Cramer02,5,Wed Jun 17 15:03:30 2015 UTC,So what about all the PC players who paid full price and paid for premium?? it would basically be ripping off your already small player base so soon after release..
BF_Hardline,3a5xoa,martinsjus,-2,Wed Jun 17 15:08:53 2015 UTC,"They're getting ripped off either way. By allowing BF4 players to get the game for 10 bucks, they might have overpaid, but at least they can still play the game."
BF_Hardline,3a5xoa,Cramer02,3,Wed Jun 17 15:26:02 2015 UTC,"If you didnt notice im on PC and although the population is low reducing the game further wont bring back players, its been on sale since after its first month of release.

BF_Hardline,3a3euu,cutlerf,2,Tue Jun 16 23:35:43 2015 UTC,It should have automatically downloaded separate. Check your notifications. It was about 600-700 mb. The patch notes are floating around on here somewhere and you can also check them out on BL.

BF_Hardline,3a3rd7,wexfordlad1,3,Wed Jun 17 00:16:39 2015 UTC,When you die it stays at the last track you hit and you only need to get the amount of points for that rep track. i those numbers has been knocked down with the patch but dont take my word on that. I just know that they were supposed to lower the numbers with all the camera coins and shield buffs.
BF_Hardline,3a3rd7,ipawilzon,-1,Wed Jun 17 00:31:04 2015 UTC,And I think tier three to four is actually 6000 not a total from one to four of 6000 each level is independent.  It's what makes tier 4 so hard it's more points then the first three combined.
BF_Hardline,3a3rd7,protothrowaway,1 point,Wed Jun 17 00:44:33 2015 UTC,It is just 6000 total. So staying alive until you reach tier 4 is the best route. If you die then yes... you will have to start from zero again.

BF_Hardline,3a1rxw,Georific,3,Tue Jun 16 16:47:09 2015 UTC,"Problem with the PC patch and they had to make sure that the problem wasnt in the console patches either, hence why PC got the patch then had it re-rolled back."

BF_Hardline,3a1rxw,Georific,1 point,Tue Jun 16 17:01:40 2015 UTC,The initial launch tests? No disrespect but is Visceral a group of five guys in a garage? Did y'all not think to test the launch -before- the day of? Lack of resources isn't even an excuse because the CTE client runs fine... Did y'all think to do any testing maybe the week before?
BF_Hardline,3a1rxw,pandaridingatrex,1 point,Tue Jun 16 22:41:24 2015 UTC,"We're testing the game constantly, the issue was a problem under the hood that we weren't able to see in our test environment. We couldn't test it in the live environment in advance because that would mean we would have to take all of our players offline for a day because they'd have content mismatches with the back end.  Generally when a product like this is launched, the servers are taken down for about an hour. The new version is deployed to the back end as well as to the clients, then we will go in and run a number of tests to make sure you can download and install the content and then make sure you can connect to servers. Once that is done, we'll give the green light to open up to the public. The last step of those checks failed, which didn't occur in our test environment, and brought this issue to the surface."
BF_Hardline,3a1rxw,Visceral_TO,1 point,Tue Jun 16 22:49:48 2015 UTC,Just extremely frustrated. Is standard going to still get CA on the 30th or is it being pushed back to July first?
BF_Hardline,3a1rxw,pandaridingatrex,1 point,Wed Jun 17 00:56:55 2015 UTC,"I understand, we're frustrated too. I haven't heard anything about it being delayed for non-Premium users so I wouldn't expect it."

BF_Hardline,3a1rxw,Tylerdurden516,2,Tue Jun 16 19:19:15 2015 UTC,Wasn't there a post in the past that said if you can't patch one system you can't release a patch for the others? This seems to say that you have more problems maintaining the PC platform then the consoles and that you can release patches to the different systems at different times.   Can I just somehow get my $128 back I spent on Premium and maybe pre-order Battlefront?

BF_Hardline,3a2k5s,WCR-jv27,0,Tue Jun 16 20:56:13 2015 UTC,Only because people quit and the teams get smaller.
BF_Hardline,3a2k5s,ComradeSloth,1 point,Tue Jun 16 23:27:48 2015 UTC,I only just played a few rounds of TDM today. (Just to test out the patch) I played 'The Block' and 'Bank Job' felt a bit odd on Bank Job... as I was seeing people playing in areas they normally never do. Not sure if that was because of the spawns or not?   Only spawned a few times but I know one spot in 'Bank Jobs' map upper right of map had you spawning a bit further back so you seemed more open to enemy when spawning. did not like that spawn moment but haven't had enough time to see the entire system at work.  On 'The Block' I was at the North of the map... my team mates left the area and I had 5 enemy instantly spawn around me. I freaked and died quickly. The entire netcode seems a bit wonky and I am not sure why yet?   Not going to give it a pass or a true gripe until I get more time with each of the maps. Crossing my fingers it is better then the few games I tested out?
BF_Hardline,3a2k5s,BillyHoWCR,1 point,Tue Jun 16 20:42:23 2015 UTC,On 'The Block' I was at the North of the map... my team mates left the area and I had 5 enemy instantly spawn around me.   That sounds right. The spawn system should spawn you in a place with the most friendlies and/or the least enemies. If you were essentially alone the spawn code may have decided that was the best place to start spawning the other team.  A reference point is Noshahr Canals from BF3. You would start off spawning on one end of the map but then as the balance of power shifted the spawn would flip and you'd spawn at the other end for a while.
BF_Hardline,3a2k5s,FalconiiLV,1 point,Tue Jun 16 22:12:04 2015 UTC,Yep... aware of the spawn system on BF3... one of the best I have experienced myself. This moment was not like that... I understand the zone and such... but the friendlies had just left and many more areas available at that moment which would have not been directly on top of me. I mean it was crazy like I just got tossed into the middle of a mosh pit.   Hoping it was a rare occurrence?
BF_Hardline,3a2k5s,BillyHoWCR,1 point,Tue Jun 16 22:18:47 2015 UTC,Hoping it was a rare occurrence?   I hope so but I have my doubts. ;)

BF_Hardline,3a3bn4,Packersrule123,8,Tue Jun 16 22:09:15 2015 UTC,You can't die in between tiers to reach the next tier. You never lived long enough to reach tier 3.
BF_Hardline,3a3bn4,naulsballs,1 point,Tue Jun 16 22:18:31 2015 UTC,"I cheated before and played Hotwire, got to tier 3 then got killed. Then in my next life got tier 4, strange!"
BF_Hardline,3a3bn4,CertifiedTreeSmoker,2,Tue Jun 16 23:00:39 2015 UTC,Playing Hotwire is not cheating. The glitch where you die and then get tier 4 quickly upon next life though has also been seen by myself once.  If you are saying you simply got tier 4 after a long time of playing again without having to earn the other tiers again... well that is because you don't lose other tiers when dying.
BF_Hardline,3a3bn4,BillyHoWCR,1 point,Wed Jun 17 03:39:06 2015 UTC,"That's possible, you have to accumulate enough points in one life to reach the next tier. If you die all of your points obtained in your previous life get reset."
BF_Hardline,3a3bn4,naulsballs,3,Tue Jun 16 23:27:28 2015 UTC,"Not thinking you understand the concept of the tier system? You can kill many people, but it is the accumulation of a certain amount of points without dying that gets you tiers. By the looks of it you died a lot."

BF_Hardline,3a3bn4,SgtWaffles2424,5,Tue Jun 16 22:27:19 2015 UTC,Not play tdm. Kills dont net alot of points and everytime you die it resets. Play hotwire and drive around or find a good pilot to get heli kills with. Its all about nonstop score
BF_Hardline,3a3bn4,BillyHoWCR,3,Tue Jun 16 23:25:04 2015 UTC,Tier 3 is 3000 I think? So if you only count kills and nothing else (though likely you should be earning other types of points while getting kills) then that would be 30 kills.

BF_Hardline,3a30z6,HereticCJ,1 point,Tue Jun 16 21:11:19 2015 UTC,How are they easier? Do you need fewer intel assists per coin or are enemies spotted for longer or what?
BF_Hardline,3a30z6,Psychokynetik,2,Tue Jun 16 21:28:58 2015 UTC,"Not sure exactly... other then the fact that camera spotting takes priority over any other spotting, I am not aware of other specifics that were changed. But for sure they just racked up. The first camera coin I had got in the match I only had one camera down. And got it in like 2 minutes.   And I wasn't even paying attention too much this match and checked on cameras later and had to replace them because they were destroyed. So surely if they had been on the battlefield longer then I would have had even more.  Edit: just found this from awhile back from a Dev   Now camera spots take priority over active or passive spotting, making them much more reliable. In addition, each camera shares a larger pool of raycasts, improving the number of targets they can spot while not impacting performance negatively.   So looks like number of targets spottable has in fact been improved."
BF_Hardline,3a30z6,richm1975,1 point,Tue Jun 16 21:32:55 2015 UTC,Cameras now take priority over other players spotting enemies. The number of assists if the same I believe but the camera is no longer ignored by people spamming R1 (or right bumper).

BF_Hardline,3a0t0h,ipawilzon,0,Tue Jun 16 19:31:49 2015 UTC,Nailgun in coffin. Hope they will fix this issue in DICE style - by fixing it with the next DLC lol.
BF_Hardline,3a0t0h,nightbass,5,Tue Jun 16 10:59:58 2015 UTC,"As a PC user, I don't think they should delay the console release. And the same should be true if the shoe was on the other foot.  It is a little disappointing that they get tripped up by an issue (don't know what it is) when there is so much time between patch releases. Timing the release with e3 was a strange decision in the first place imo."

BF_Hardline,3a0t0h,sivyan,4,Tue Jun 16 11:56:25 2015 UTC,I think its more to do with the fact they have released 1 patch since the games release and they still cant make it go smoothly.
BF_Hardline,3a0t0h,Cramer02,13,Tue Jun 16 11:58:09 2015 UTC,"I'm just so frustrated, I was really looking forward to the DLC, I logged on and get this big red banner saying it was postponed just sucks ass. I understand that there might be some bumps on the road but just annoying they don't test these things out and make sure it is a stable launch so people can enjoy there content.   This happening is starting to make me regret my purchase of BF: Hardline premium."
BF_Hardline,3a0t0h,Georific,7,Tue Jun 16 10:08:32 2015 UTC,Wow im pretty pissed.  Like this is a fuckin joke right? Xbox even put your game up for sale to try and build up some hype. I regret purchasing premium because of things like this and the vague advertisement nature you have with what will be in premium. This whole thing was a cash grab.
BF_Hardline,3a0t0h,Tyruz,6,Tue Jun 16 10:32:53 2015 UTC,I've bought premium for BF3/BF4 and felt like it was totally worth it both times so I naturally did the same for Hardline. Not this time. I regret the decision. Not because of this delay either..
BF_Hardline,3a0t0h,Ilikepurplehaze,1 point,Tue Jun 16 12:39:34 2015 UTC,"Me too. I bought BF4 with Premium on both Xbox One and PC and loved it on both platforms. When BFH was announced, I expected it to be amazing, so I pre-ordered BFH Deluxe ($70) on Xbox One and BFH Deluxe ($70) + Premium ($40) on PC.  At $180 dumped into BFH, my salt is real. :\"
BF_Hardline,3a0t0h,laxmanchip,2,Tue Jun 16 12:55:26 2015 UTC,"Jesus dude. No offense, but why would you would you buy the same game for 2 different platforms?"
BF_Hardline,3a0t0h,easy_Money,1 point,Tue Jun 16 13:41:00 2015 UTC,"That's a valid question.  I prefer to play games on PC because the graphics are MUCH better and netcode and input delay (or lackthereof) are fantastic.  That being said, when I play on PC, I'm always solo; none of my long-time gaming buddies play on PC.  That's the reason I also buy the same game for console; that's where my friends play.  I'm selfish and prefer the ""PC experience"", but it ends up costing me more, especially when a game (like BFH) flops on my platform of choice."
BF_Hardline,3a0t0h,laxmanchip,3,Tue Jun 16 13:54:42 2015 UTC,"I feel for those that wasted a lot of money on that. I got lucky I got both the game and premium for around €70,- (which is what a lot of people paid for the game only)."

BF_Hardline,3a0t0h,Visceral_TO,1 point,Tue Jun 16 17:15:42 2015 UTC,"Care to take the time to honestly answer some questions for me? I'm asking as a long time fan of the series who is honestly pretty disappointed with hardline, though I've bought it and premium.    What's with the general lack of balance in the game? For instance, the k10 was (and I guess still is, thanks to the bed shitting on the patch) stupidly overpowered. Same can be said for the .300 knockout. Did you just not test much with real players?  Why is there so little content at launch and, further, why are some of your DLC maps more or less plagiarized from call of duty maps from years go? We were told a lot about a customization option called Gun Bench, which y'all have been very quiet about, despite putting in your ads to get our money. What is it, when can I expect it, and, if not, will you be offering refunds on the game because you falsely advertised features? Seriously, if I could get my money back for the game and premium I would gladly leave you be and never touch another EA published title again.   If you choose to answer these, thanks for your time!"
BF_Hardline,3a0t0h,PoliticoG305,0,Tue Jun 16 17:21:20 2015 UTC,"Here's some opinions, and I want to mention that they are my opinions and not necessarily that of Visceral or the people that actually designed the stuff you're asking about.   We playtest the game in our office daily, so yes it is tested with real players. The K10 dominates at close range but is a nerf gun at range. Depending on the maps/modes you play, it might dominate on some and not so much on others. If you're playing TDM on The Block where you're 5ft from everyone at all times, then yes the K10 is going to (and supposed to, IMO) dominate. With that said, we also have a limited number of people compared to putting the game out in the public in order to gather metrics to back up people's opinions.  I'm assuming you're comparing it to BF4 and you have to keep in mind the BF4 had Day 1 DLC whereas we didn't. We also split up our guns across the two factions, which makes the selection feel more limited than it actually is.  It shouldn't be hard to figure out if you read the press release, there's 4 promised super features, 4 expansion packs and you're getting one of the super features (Masks) with Criminal Activity. I don't have any specific details on the Gun Bench because nothing has been announced about it."
BF_Hardline,3a0t0h,Visceral_TO,1 point,Tue Jun 16 17:43:38 2015 UTC,"Adding more to 1... The K10 feels fine. It outguns assault rifles up close & gets beat by nearly everything at range. Within its own class you can sacrifice TTK for more accuracy & range with the MPX. Different maps call for different guns. For example, the K10 is more suitable for maps like Hollywood Heights where you're constantly rounding corners & running routes that keep you in tight corners.. If you prefer playing mechanic on maps like Dust Bowl then you can gamble on medium ranged targets with the MPX without depleting your ammo on one enemy lol. This has always been evident to me bc I've played a lot & experimented with most guns at length. Give the game a chance, try to learn it, & stop blaming developers because you're getting killed constantly."
BF_Hardline,3a0t0h,skillfactor,1 point,Tue Jun 16 22:27:33 2015 UTC,Did you seriously just call masks a super feature? That's like promising a kid a new bike and instead getting him a sticker of a bike to put on his wheelchair.
BF_Hardline,3a0t0h,PoliticoG305,1 point,Tue Jun 16 17:45:14 2015 UTC,More like being told you are getting a bike for your birthday and you think it is a motorcycle when in reality it is just a Schwinn Bicycle .

BF_Hardline,3a0t0h,fletch420man,-1,Tue Jun 16 15:03:30 2015 UTC,I'm not going to list their failed efforts anymore- that's been beat to death. I'll keep watching the subs and checking in for the occasional round- hoping the game comes around-
BF_Hardline,3a0t0h,dirtymuffins23,2,Tue Jun 16 18:05:24 2015 UTC,Dice still hasn't gotten their shit together with bf4. There's still way more problems with it than hardline. Been rubber banding on bf4 since launch. Hardline? None. At least hardline was playable on launch day.
BF_Hardline,3a0t0h,fletch420man,-2,Tue Jun 16 15:53:54 2015 UTC,the stats don't back your assertion sir-
BF_Hardline,3a0t0h,dirtymuffins23,2,Tue Jun 16 18:03:44 2015 UTC,Stats of what? You can't tell me bf4 had a smooth launch like hardline. Not at all. It was literally unplayable launch day. Where as hardline was good to go. Just cause some dlc got delayed doesn't mean visceral is a complete fuck up. Dice has fucked up something in every update on bf4. They fix one thing just to mess up something else.
BF_Hardline,3a0t0h,CrossBones3129,-2,Tue Jun 16 18:51:15 2015 UTC,"Umm BF4 launched fine for me and THOUSHANDS of others, yes there was a shitton of issues, hardline launched like a game never tested and was for sure just as half assed as any other BF launch. The goddamn difference is DICe got off their asses and fixed it enough here we are 2 years later and still outpacing brand new titles...where is hardline? On fucking life support."

BF_Hardline,3a3gaz,Tyruz,1 point,Wed Jun 17 00:11:37 2015 UTC,"Look, if the patch was ready to roll out on consoles but not on PC, then there was no reason to hold it back. 90% of Hardline's players aren't affected by PC delays.  EA/Visceral actually considered abandoning Hardline on PC at one point. The fact they even talked about it being an ""easy answer"" speaks volumes about which platforms they prioritized with Hardline."
BF_Hardline,3a3gaz,Xuvial,0,Wed Jun 17 01:04:23 2015 UTC,What is annoying is they hold back PC patches to release alongside the Consoles even though PC goes through Cert 1-2 weeks faster.
BF_Hardline,3a3gaz,Xuvial,1 point,Wed Jun 17 03:05:47 2015 UTC,"You're right...well actually PC doesn't have a ""cert"", devs are free to push out anything they like at any time.   For PC there's no central authority like Microsoft/Sony dictating what gets accepted. It's why CTE on PC can get patched almost daily (or even hourly!) with zero delays."

BF_Hardline,3a3gaz,DANNYonPC,0,Tue Jun 16 23:41:50 2015 UTC,Difference DICE is huge compared to Visceral. More PC players need to be voicing their concerns. There is no excuse for Console to get the DLC and patch when PC has to wait but when it comes to regular patches PC has to wait on Console Certifications for Patches.
BF_Hardline,3a2igu,TheSergeantShocks,1 point,Tue Jun 16 18:45:02 2015 UTC,"So, let me get this straight- before either team could wear the vanilla masks, but now that there are police-specific masks, the old ones are criminal-only? And that means that you can't wear any masks on the police side because you never purchased premium?"
BF_Hardline,3a2igu,GregoryGoose,2,Tue Jun 16 18:57:42 2015 UTC,Before the Police side had a mask 'Dino' and the criminal side had a mask 'Wolf'. Now with change in patch... both Vanilla masks are only available for criminal side. So they effectively have taken any masks we had previously for police away from us entirely and made it so only DLC users have an option to wear a mask for Police side.
BF_Hardline,3a2igu,BillyHoWCR,1 point,Tue Jun 16 20:46:06 2015 UTC,No. Im playing with the new patch right now a nd you can only use the dino and wolf on the criminal side.

BF_Hardline,39xu0q,LOTRcrr,1 point,Mon Jun 15 20:17:28 2015 UTC,I thought battle rifles were going to get a slight buff on min damage?
BF_Hardline,39xu0q,iosPixel,0,Tue Jun 16 05:09:35 2015 UTC,"They were already improved from 24 to 25 in the first patch. They're 2 shot Headshots across the map at any range. I doubt it will be improved again. The TTK on a gun like the SA 58 is nuts (yes even more nuts) due to muzzle velocity and the quick 2 shot headshot. It's the best gun in the game for that reason, 43 up close and 25 min damage."

BF_Hardline,39xu0q,Sy_Ableman,1 point,Tue Jun 16 05:36:06 2015 UTC,"Holy shit, all of the new weapon balances look good. M16, M416, K10 and MPX nerfed (I'm not sure if MPX was OP but it was used a lot). Then all of the buffs to mediocre guns. I'm most impressed with L85 accuracy buff. I kinda thought it would not get buffed because it is a limited edition gun. Too bad the reload time was not touched but the accuracy indeed made no sense for that gun.   Interesting to see there was nothing for knockout. That has been the biggest pain in my ass honestly. I don't even care about M16, M416 and K10 anymore, the Knockout seems the worst. Especially in rescue where the gun with the most single kill potential is the best."
BF_Hardline,39xu0q,JasonKesler,1 point,Tue Jun 16 06:06:36 2015 UTC,"I almost never see the knockout unless I'm playing TDM, I have it unlocked and gold I think its my second most used weapon but it kinda sucks."

I switched to Muzzle break and angled and the gun is even more of a laser. Not much of a nerf. I would say, if you can control it, its more of a buff due to it's min damage being buffed to 18."

BF_Hardline,39wlf6,Devo5220,2,Mon Jun 15 15:29:42 2015 UTC,"Well, at least it's not as bad as some of the BF4 spawns that spawn you 150m outside the objective."
BF_Hardline,39wlf6,Snaz5,3,Mon Jun 15 20:58:11 2015 UTC,Would you prefer 150m away from the objective or 15m directly in front of an enemy? Choose one :)
BF_Hardline,39wlf6,Xuvial,1 point,Tue Jun 16 02:54:01 2015 UTC,"the second one. If you whip around and dive prone or start hopping around, you've got a chance."
BF_Hardline,39wlf6,Snaz5,2,Tue Jun 16 06:00:13 2015 UTC,"Not defending the TDM spawns, but in this case the guy spawned on a territory his team controlled right as an enemy was going down the stairs and 2 other enemies spawned onto him. Not much they can program to fix that, although it is really funny. I've had this happen in similar fashion a couple of times in my favor and against."
BF_Hardline,39wlf6,nastylep,1 point,Mon Jun 15 22:59:23 2015 UTC,"Can't they just program something that prevents you from spawning within line of sight of an enemy (or within a 5-10m radius if LoS is too hard to code)? If you violate the condition, it spawns you at the next spot. It keeps trying the next spot until it finds one that works.   I'm no programmer, but I'd imagine its really not that hard. But I could easily be wrong."
BF_Hardline,39wlf6,nukethor,2,Tue Jun 16 13:21:44 2015 UTC,"Ya know how they could fix this? Just assign a base for each team and have them be inaccessible to the enemy team like in conquest. You know why they won't do that? Because anybody with a fucking keyboard and capslock button will just bitch about having to walk too far to get back into the game. Worse even, they'll make a video about it, then turn it into a gif, post it on a site for people who like the game to irritate those people, and all of that will happen after they spent the day yesterday talking about how people need to stop flaming negative shit on the subreddit"

BF_Hardline,3a29ha,RICExTANK,5,Tue Jun 16 19:03:08 2015 UTC,"no spotting, using up way too much ammo and playing like a COD kid"
BF_Hardline,3a29ha,pedrobeara,-4,Tue Jun 16 19:42:55 2015 UTC,"You guys are fucking outrageous. Watch the video again. No one was around me, spotting wouldn't help. First guy was ""missed"" shots because he had just spawned in. I killed both of them. Chased the other guy, oh guess what I killed him too, and then two guys come in and you expect me to ADS both of them in close quarters? Come on now.  There's no CoD love here from me. The game fucking sucks. The only thing I was trying to point out in the video was the fact that they came in the room swinging melee at me and any Battlefield player worth his salt from past games knows that knifing from the front would always result in a counter.  And using too much ammo? Who fucking cares? I killed them all didn't I? Had I survived I would've dropped a box, loaded up, and kept keeping that area clear."
BF_Hardline,3a29ha,Gunn_Anon,3,Tue Jun 16 19:54:15 2015 UTC,"any Battlefield player worth his salt from past games knows that knifing from the front would always result in a counter.

Always spot when possible... regardless of your thoughts of who are near enough to you to assist... spotting allows those spawning to know that you are chasing down enemy and can use you as a spawn point to assist."
BF_Hardline,3a29ha,Troy_Davis,2,Tue Jun 16 21:19:02 2015 UTC,"spot first shoot 2nd, a spot only lasts a few seconds and sure you may give up a kill but to the rest of the team it's priceless, COD kiddies will never understand."

BF_Hardline,3a29ha,RoflPancakeMix,4,Tue Jun 16 22:15:13 2015 UTC,You took a poor shot moving into the kitchen giving away your position instead of making sure you had the mop up. If the other team was any better you really wouldn't have had an opportunity to finish that house.

It'll never happen, but I wish maps that didn't have vehicles like Block had a special beacon for the Mechanic where up to 10 teammates outside of your squad could spawn on your beacon throghout a game.

If so I strongly recommend turning on Shadowplay. It records some really high quality video and has a feature that allows you to hit a button and it will save the last x minutes of gameplay. That's how I get all my clips now because screw recording all the time and having the edit a massive 2 hour long clip!!

BF_Hardline,39xtk3,LegitCyborg,1 point,Tue Jun 16 04:17:24 2015 UTC,As a person who has maxed out Hacker I can tell you that will be a much greater asset to your team when you are able to do all that you do now but extremely faster and for longer duration.   Your question is a bit cryptic in how it is written... are you asking how you are being effective when if you were on the battlefield you could simply be killing the enemy?   As a Hacker you can do so much more to turn the tide of the battlefield. I have Hacked a lot and prefer games when none of us are hacking. Why? Because when a single team has a hacker then it is so unbalanced. Basically it is one team knowing where the other team is at on the battlefield at nearly all times. Not so bad when both teams have hacker... but really makes it that you have to run and gun when the enemy team has a big Dorito over you on the map saying kill this person.   And if you are talking about resigning and jumping into game when spotting someone as a Hacker... well that is just micro management and makes you less effective being away from Hacker position for that time period of trying to kill or destroy objective. ;)

BF_Hardline,39u8wy,ipawilzon,5,Sun Jun 14 20:44:52 2015 UTC,"My opinion of this sub - it seems to have a roughly even split of:   Diehard Hardline fans who disregard any criticism, even if it's valid, and believe anyone posting with a negative view of the game is just trolling; People who see Hardline's potential but accept that it has flaws and would like to see them addressed in a timely manner, particularly PC players left with a (near) dead game, and; People who hate Hardline with a passion and absolutely revel in every bit of negativity they can drum up.   This combination of visitors is a perfect recipe for pure toxicity.  It's not particularly surprising when you consider the context of Hardline's existence i.e. the fact that it's a 'spin-off', it's similarities with what many consider the traditional enemy of Battlefield and it's position as successor to a title that had one of the worst launches of any AAA game in recent memory.  Bottom line for me: there's some good content buried away here but you have to be willing to sift through the rubbish it's hidden under.  I find it hard to see the point."

These subs, the battlelog, the people playing, all of it. I find it best to just keep to myself and my friends and ignore everyone else.   Some might argue that's just how the internet and gaming is, but no it's not. All other game specific subs I'm following are nice as hell. They are helpful, upvoty, funny, etc, etc. Even for competitive games. I wonder what in BF brings this kind of community and behaviour. Is it the yolo swag 360 no scope CODified gameplay or what? I don't get it whatsoever.  It's not just Hardline either, I had to unsub from BF4 because it was so incredibly toxic. I could not comment anything without being attacked.

A big part of BF3's marketing and subsequent fan base revolved around how it was sooo much better than Call of Duty, CoD is for kiddies, etc.. That brought in a lot of former CoD players and new FPS players wanting to jump on the bandwagon of the so-called ""CoD killer"". That kind of marketing appeals to a less-than positive personality, and it has fostered a pretty toxic community ever since. It's a damn shame, because BF3 was a fantastic game that could have stood well on it's own without having to stoop that low."

We've talked about the absolute shit posts that have been flooding this place just this past week, and it's ridiculous.   You prefer BF4? Cool, go play BF4... But I remember the absolute shit storm that game was (way worse than this) where you ""battlefield veterans"" believed you needed ""actual compensation"" because of the state of the game.   And on the COD vs BF4 note, how childish are you that you need to turn different franchises into some sort of competition just because they're both FPS? No one cares if ""COD players"" are playing battlefield. I'm happy the BF franchise is growing, even on BF4. More people to play with and easy to get games going. If you truly believe that you're better than a COD player, why aren't you playing HL? Should be easy kills, right?   It's pretty simple, if you don't like the game, go away. We don't need your negativity because a good amount of people are enjoying. Just because the game is dead on the superior PC platform has no effect on the pretty good numbers on console. We don't need to see your different take on how you feel about ""wasting"" your money, or how this ""isn't battlefield.""  It's a game. People play it. Get over it.

I did not watch the video because I figured I new what it was. But since you mentioned it was so ""awesome"" I thought I would see why people disliked it so much?   Well I was right... it was simply the same ""Say hello to my little friend."" line that most of us have heard ourselves and/or seen on the subreddit already.   And the use of the word ""awesome"" in describing the video is less then accurate. I did not downvote the video nor the post but I see why others did. It simply was old news acted as if it was new and interesting. Yes I understand where some players might not see or hear all the easter eggs in the game... but this is little different then all the teddy bear sightings posted for BF3 that we had to sit through time and time again as people thought they were sharing something new with us.  Yes there are a lot of people that hate on the game and come here just to share their feelings about this hatred. And yes they should find another place to vent their anger. This subreddit is for those looking to enjoy the game and meet others that also enjoy it.  But... (and this is a BIG but) there are also so many posts from people posting BETA videos that have been up on Youtube since February and just now being shared... with little more then a grenade blowing up a vehicle. And **IT gets positive upvotes? What?? And easter eggs of gun reloads that we have seen numerous times. Or audio cue that we have heard hundreds of times already. How many times did we sit through videos of people simply flipping off the enemy before that finally stopped being a thing?   How do I know when a video is likely going to be bad? They usually label it as awesome, great, epic, or something similar. At least the Scarface video didn't have a bad title.   And yes... I thought the upvote of a Youtuber and Visceral Dev back and forth was a bit much, but not at least it was interesting. Note: I did not upvote or downvote it either.  And yes... the bad vibe from gamers on the internet has done a lot I think to reduce the PC player base. I notice this when seeing a few posts that start out with the fact they ignored the bad words on the game and took a chance on the PC game anyways. I am sure many others simply gave it a pass instead."

I figured I would knock out the Bounty and let people know it really wasn't that hard before the patch.

BF_Hardline,39u4r3,nightbass,0,Mon Jun 15 06:06:57 2015 UTC,Not sure how much is actually being changed though? Might still have a limited amount of a single person per camera marked at a time as it was before? If so then that shouldn't effect Spot Assists too much. Though it will have obviously some impact.  But though I thought Spot Assists would be rare with me (as I hate taking my finger off of trigger for any reason) I do have x275 spotting coins. So a few less per game is not going to hurt me too much.ha

So any other enemy spotted normally by a player that is not being  currently marked by camera will still be considered player spotted.   But again... we will have to see how it currently plays out when patch releases."
BF_Hardline,39u4r3,President_Skoad,1 point,Tue Jun 16 06:08:49 2015 UTC,Yes we need to test it. I'm not aware of that single person limitation.
BF_Hardline,39u4r3,CraziBoi94,1 point,Tue Jun 16 06:15:03 2015 UTC,I can't recall but someone did a video on it awhile ago. Testing who was marked by camera and who wasn't.   I myself have never seen two people spotted by my same camera at one time. Even if they are standing beside each other. Patch notes didn't appear like they had changed any aspect to that part?? But yes... patch is close enough we will see how it changes things up soon enough.
BF_Hardline,39u4r3,tcpvtec,2,Tue Jun 16 06:25:07 2015 UTC,But it was never hard in the first place...

BF_Hardline,39ttof,BowlerNona,1 point,Sun Jun 14 22:27:32 2015 UTC,Does the US not have many rescue servers? I've had no problem in EU. However I play with friends so communication with randoms is not a problem. I suggest finding a squad to play with. We play pretty much only rescue and it's fun as heck. The game mode has surprisingly many players. I would've thought it would be dead in a week after launch like that bomb mode in BF4. We never have trouble finding a populated server and then the server rarely dies out even though people cycle after almost every round.

BF_Hardline,39oyov,malacovics,47,Sat Jun 13 10:19:09 2015 UTC,In the video Matimio really only said it may not be worth the money if your playing on the PC with the dwindling player count. Jackfrags was much more negative about the game. XFactor was a little more pumped about the gameplay but never really gave a opinion and Levelcap just did gun reviews.
BF_Hardline,39oyov,maxcatz34,16,Sat Jun 13 12:44:19 2015 UTC,"I'm providing content to drive views to your channel   most of his latest videos are about BF4 because of the spring patch, while we're still here waiting on promised premium features that we've still heard nothing about"

Obviously Visceral knows the game is not doing great and Matimi0 is just giving his honest feedback. He even specified he was talking about PC. I didn't have much respect for Visceral because the game is pretty buggy and unbalanced but now I'm sure of it, I hate Visceral. Make a mediocre game, silence criticism."
BF_Hardline,39oyov,Nikotiiniko,45,Sun Jun 14 10:20:48 2015 UTC,"So, it's highly likely that Visceral will only invite people who give the content a positive review.   Honest move, Visceral."

BF_Hardline,39oyov,GregoryGoose,6,Wed Jun 24 01:17:29 2015 UTC,After seeing that skywalk I would have given it a 10/10. Should have invited me.
BF_Hardline,39oyov,DarthPneumono,-3,Sat Jun 13 10:33:00 2015 UTC,"What do you expect though. They know as well as we do what a half-assed job Hardline was, and how little support they've put into the game since launch. Hell, they haven't even made half the features from premium available yet. So of course they're going to be really selective about who they invite, otherwise the few good reviews won't even be noticed."
BF_Hardline,39oyov,JamesTrendall,-3,Sat Jun 13 16:40:20 2015 UTC,I can understand from the pov of the guy that made the content. Getting upset because he worked hard and this guy hates it...    I'd be a bit upset if i worked months on with lots of hard work and people hated it. Atleast give it some nice remarks.

Except the Neebs Gaming footage, where they seemed a bit overly excited. So the ""meh"" attitude doesn't seem to be an abnormal opinion.  Maybe instead of being worried about people's opinions - Visceral should worry about better content, mayeb even releasing some of the premium features that STILL haven't been released"

BF_Hardline,39oyov,Troy_Davis,2,Sat Jun 13 12:05:15 2015 UTC,There probably won't be an official response for the reason you've given.
BF_Hardline,39oyov,TehDarkArchon,5,Sat Jun 13 12:07:07 2015 UTC,"It's his opinion. I can’t believe a dev commenting on this didn’t realize it would go viral. Matimi0 is very disappointed with the Hardline PC player base. It's practically gone. The CTE will probably never get traction because it's 15-20% of an already low player base. He did say a lot of good things about the DLC but overall it’s obvious he’s disappointed with it in general . I love playing Hardline Conq Large on PS4. I’m Premium  and yes there are things that are annoying and need to be fixed. But overall I’m enjoying the game. Making a copy of CoD Kill Confirmed and putting it in their first DLC was not a good idea unless they were trying to attract CoD players. Well, I think you have more important things to worry about."
BF_Hardline,39oyov,DAGam3r,1 point,Sat Jun 13 15:19:51 2015 UTC,I really enjoy playing COD as well and kill confirmed is one of my favorite modes. So its a win win for me.

A month after the release i starting watching the Battlefield Youtubers and they were really pumping up the game, so I bought the game and have liked it ever since. So in a way Matimio sold me on the game."
BF_Hardline,39oyov,TheNameIsFrags,-8,Sun Jun 14 12:10:33 2015 UTC,"So you blindly buy games based on trailers and what not? Because reviews serve one purpose - to show if the game is worth your money or not.   Unless you're fucking rich, than I wouldn't give a damn about reviews either."

BF_Hardline,39oyov,DAGam3r,4,Sat Jun 13 21:56:20 2015 UTC,"I feel a bit bad for Zach. I've seen a lot of the podcasts featuring him and he seems like a genuinely good guy who just wants his game to succeed, but I'm sure the tension and frustration around the office due to all the negativity and lack of players with this game has affected everyone. At this point it's kinda clear they either weren't prepared or didn't have the manpower required to pump out the content that was both promised and needed. They're trying to develop patches, expansions, CTE, and premium features all at once, but the problem is all of that is either half assed or absent completely because (I'm assuming) they don't have the manpower or means to finish each to completion in a timely manner.  That being said, I still stand by my opinion that Zach's reaction was unwarranted, and I applaud Matimi0 for being honest with his viewers (he's probably my favorite BF youtuber so this comes to no surprise to me.) Adding a few small, albeit semi-decent, maps and kill confirmed in the first of four expansions isn't exactly a great way to reinvigorate the player base. IMO, they needed to get closer to core BF style than anything. Delay the DLC a bit, finish the patches and premium features, and release 4 large maps, Rush mode, 5+ weapons and then you'll see people come back to check the new content out. Don't just try to appease the few thousand people who play the block and 64 man tdm."
BF_Hardline,39oyov,JamieNoonZ,2,Sun Jun 14 07:20:16 2015 UTC,Well said. Couldn't agree more.
BF_Hardline,39oyov,JZA1,4,Sun Jun 14 14:11:04 2015 UTC,Turned out he only had an issue with the title. Because let's be honest. The choice of title is EXTREMELY poor.
BF_Hardline,39oyov,vgdomination,18,Sat Jun 13 22:04:39 2015 UTC,I disagree. The title sums up his feelings of the DLC in one sentence.
BF_Hardline,39oyov,Murk1e,-11,Sun Jun 14 05:09:49 2015 UTC,"Exactly,  it was a dumbass title. Heck, I didn't know I could roll my eyes until I saw that title.

BF_Hardline,39oyov,ZombieHoneyBadger,-2,Mon Jun 15 21:09:58 2015 UTC,"I can see why the Dev got upset he had a problem with the title not the review which is understandable, Matimi0's title is poorly written and might mislead people on different platforms, he needs to remember its not just pc players that watch his videos, most the negative comments for the DLC were due to the lack of players on pc, like matimi0 tweeted console is a different story and you can't tell that from the title of the video and tweet. A simple title CA review would have been more appropriate, allowing viewers to make their own minds up by watching the review video.  Zach Mumbach ‏@zachulon  1h @ZeChoesnToaster I get it but majority of players are on console. So for them it's still a good buy but title didn't specify platform.  Zach Mumbach@zachulon @ZeChoesnToaster no and I really don't mind the critique. All I had issue with was the title of the video, which was misleading."

So might as well continue earning towards the masks... as they are much more rare then any item you might find in the battlepacks.   And stopping your progression after you have already made the half way point is like saying you are simply giving up entirely on any thoughts of having the masks.   I myself am sitting at just under 8 million towards the masks and have spent a little over 1 million on gadgets and weapon attachments I felt I really wanted in game.   So keep at it... when you reach 8 million then it is all down hill from that point. :)"

BF_Hardline,39rxnz,Ambrosial,1 point,Sun Jun 14 23:19:46 2015 UTC,You're halfway there and I would just keep going for it. When I got closer to 10 million I started to regret the zebra camo purchase. Also the battle packs will always be there once you get to 10 million you can blow 5 million on them and pretty much get everything unlocked because that's what I did.
BF_Hardline,39rxnz,coldape,1 point,Sun Jun 14 05:13:19 2015 UTC,I've got the masks but rarely use them as they take up a gadget slot. However I'd probably say save your cash as there isn't much to get from battlepacks.
BF_Hardline,39rxnz,A_McKinney,1 point,Sun Jun 14 08:22:53 2015 UTC,get to ten mill then you get the masks and can buy everything lol
BF_Hardline,39rxnz,GregoryGoose,1 point,Sun Jun 14 16:52:55 2015 UTC,Keep in mind that the masks don't cost 10 million. You just need to get that much and then you can do whatever you want with the money. So wait it out. Having a mask is awesome. Everyone on the enemy team will relentlessly pursue you and team up to try and kill you.

BF_Hardline,39rxnz,Hideous-Chud,1 point,Mon Jun 15 16:32:31 2015 UTC,Wait so how do you get the masks? I'm guessing reach 10m banked cash and have a certain amount of gold BP's unopened too?
BF_Hardline,39rxnz,BillyHoWCR,1 point,Sun Jun 14 05:22:18 2015 UTC,Just save up the ten million. Then they are available to purchase  (not for 10 mill though).
BF_Hardline,39rxnz,pandaridingatrex,1 point,Sun Jun 14 05:28:44 2015 UTC,"As the Ugly Cannibalistic Humanoid Underground Dweller said... earning 10 million (that's the full amount that you must have earned over the course of your Battlefield Hardline career, and available to you at the end of a round in order for the masks to unlock) will unlock the option for mask to be purchased. i have only heard that the masks don't cost that much but never heard actually how much they do cost once they are purchasable? Anyone with mask want to share?"
BF_Hardline,39rxnz,BillyHoWCR,2,Sun Jun 14 05:48:26 2015 UTC,"I have the mask and have for some time now. I don't believe they actually cost anything and were just unlocked. Like previous people have said however, they take up a gadget slot so it's all about if you want to show off you've saved up 10M but in the Criminal Activity DLC they'll give a boost to Teamplay/Gearhead/Quickdraw/Reputation not sure which and not more than 25%. In games I might use the Reputation boost though at the start just to get t4 because Fast Aim/Fast Reload are extremely useful."
BF_Hardline,39qmd5,pandaridingatrex,6,Sat Jun 13 20:19:02 2015 UTC,"retroactive achievements?   i can ask around    Zach says yes, but since its not his area he's asking around"
BF_Hardline,39qmd5,DANNYonPC,3,Sat Jun 13 20:55:13 2015 UTC,Appreciate it Danny! I will be... Not happy if they aren't retroactive. If it's not I hope they change it to so it is. I don't know anything about achievement design but for the love of my sanity. No way I can do it again.
BF_Hardline,39qmd5,Visceral_TO,6,Sat Jun 13 21:05:23 2015 UTC,"That's a good question, I would assume it does. You might have to get a few kills once the Achievements are updated to refresh your kill stat and pop the Achievement if it doesn't."

You ain't working the streets good enough for that.. ;)  Just saying you know nothing about Hardline (as you admit you don't play) and thus are basically interjecting into a conversation (the conversation being the Hotwire subreddit) by bringing up what little you do have on the subject.  So what else except Youtube attention could possibly get you to post a video from February which has so little to offer? :P  The post was just so much... low-effort.

I'll still play, but only when I'm mellow enough to not have any fucking mental breakdowns from people spawning behind me and mowing me down ever 10 seconds. I've tried so hard to like this game.

BF_Hardline,39svpl,CraziBoi94,-9,Sun Jun 14 13:30:07 2015 UTC,This is more than just some simple assignment. One assignment takes normally 3 or less matches to complete. This stupid fucking weapon licence can take up to more than a weeak to complete.

Maybe, but at least it truly feels like an achievement once you complete it. I personally think it should have been 500 that way you could use on both sides to work for Gold but I'm not Visceral and I've obtained the weapon licenses for the Operator/Mechanic classes and all the Battle Rifles for Enforcer.

Been a huge BF fan for years now, though I didn't really get into BF4 multiplayer. This game should not have been called Battlefield. But on the other hand, I'm really enjoying the whole stealth aspect to it. I used to get so mad playing stealth games when they wouldn't even let you try to fight through when you fucked up and were exposed, so this game is actually pretty fun and challenging when I'm not comparing it to Bad Company 2 and BF3...

I find the game extremely fun so I just said fuck it for the first week and forgot about it. My question is that with it being so far down the line is it too late for me to attempt to contact someone and get these guns cause now that I'm reaching level 90 I would like to use some new guns that technically I should have already

The game is well worth 30, that puts it in stand alone expansion pack price range.   of course if you can't get in on the deal then you have a legitimate excuse to be salty.   EDIT: You can also pickup Premium from greenmangaming for $37.50 using the 25% off code GRAB25-PERCNT-OFFNOW  I know that a lot of people are hoping that EA will release the premium maps for free, or should refund PC people who purchased premium but I really doubt either of those two scenarios will play out but if you want to pick up the DLC for the game in bulk it's not a bad deal - and notice that on Origin they're not discounting premium with their sale."

BF_Hardline,39lz02,notyavgkat,2,Fri Jun 12 19:23:47 2015 UTC,I never have problems on xbox one with getting into well populated games.
BF_Hardline,39lz02,majnu1,5,Sat Jun 13 13:16:21 2015 UTC,"Do you really think people aren't playing the game because of the price? Where have you been for the past 6 months? I think you need to get some perspective about the whole situation, this will not increase player count at all. In a months time the game will go back to where it was once the novelty has worn of."
BF_Hardline,39lz02,EliteDangerous,0,Fri Jun 12 21:44:40 2015 UTC,"Some people played the crap out of the game and simply burned out.  Some left when GTA V was released although I'm not much for the PvP experience it offers.  Some went back to BF4 with the new spring update. Some people don't like the faster time to kill, not the hardcore players apparently. The community is upset about the frequency of patches and not fixing bugs fast enough, this is a direct result of so many failed patches that BF4 had and just imagine the backlash if they released a game breaking patch for Hardline.  It's summer now and many people just are doing things other than playing games. I'm just as guilty as all the other doomsday players who check bfhstats.com on occasion and decide to pass on playing because the number of players is low (that's a self fulfilling cycle)."
BF_Hardline,39lz02,crawlerz2468,2,Fri Jun 12 22:59:22 2015 UTC,you shouldn't be downvoted. this makes sense.
BF_Hardline,39lz02,majnu1,0,Sat Jun 13 13:46:59 2015 UTC,"I have 845H 5M play time in BF3 and I still play it today and do not feel burned out by it at all. GTAV is a completely different genre and offers a different gameplay experience. GTAV shouldn't be used as an excuse, I see this flung around too often. Maybe people stayed with BF4 because it is just a better ""Battlefield"" game. However, I do agree with you that the CTE updates are still keeping the game fresh. Low TTK is a massive problem, TheRaider (Youtuber) gives good reasons why this is a problem. Low frequency of patches doesn't just extend to BF4, it goes much further back and it's just become ingrained in the Battlefield developer culture and it's something we have become tired of. Summer shouldn't affect the player count too much, people can still play in the evenings when it is slightly cooler.  I check bfhstats.com now and again to re-affirm my beliefs why this game was going to flop."
BF_Hardline,39lz02,EliteDangerous,2,Sat Jun 13 09:35:07 2015 UTC,"Those are just some of my general observations, some are saying that they should have made Bad Company 3 instead but I think it would have faced the same issues being released when BF4 is still alive and kicking.  GTAV is a pretty big deal on the PC - just look at Steam stats and that's only the portion of people who bought it on Steam, I know of people who uninstalled Hardline to make room on their SSD for GTAV.  So yeah I think releasing against it so close took people away from Hardline.  After EA shut down the UK Battlefield forms a large chunk of that community moved to a form that was labeled ""mordorHQ"" and it's pretty much a condensed group of people who love to hate on everything EA/Battlefield, along with that group you have some youtubers like TheRaider who are like cheerleaders for this group - I'm not saying their opinions aren't wrong sometimes but they often take the stance of speaking for the ""community"" when they say something is crap or not.    If you're super bored you can read some of the posts on the ""mordorHQ"" forums here  http://www.criticaledge.net/forumdisplay.php?38-Battlefield"
BF_Hardline,39lz02,majnu1,0,Sat Jun 13 10:03:30 2015 UTC,"I used to be a member of MHQ until recently, but I understand their reasoning for being critical against anything that DICE releases, sometimes they do go over the top and circle jerk over the same issues but then DICE do the same every year releasing sub-standard games so DICE are just fueling their fire and giving them a reason to look smug.   At the end of the day even guys like Raider gave valid criticisms of Hardline and weighed up the good and bad, so it wasn't a case of hating anything Battlefield, rather it was just another opinion based on valid reasoning. We're so used to listening to the perspective of Ronku youtubers who are paid to concentrate on the positives early on which is when they are most effective as PR instruments to gain sales for EA.   Regarding BC3, Visceral could have skipped Hardline altogether as it seems most people are playing BF4 anyway and released BC3 in Q4 2015 even if it coincides with SWBF. When games are rushed the cracks begin to show.    I purchased GTAV but still play BF3, both games have their merits and can co-exist."
BF_Hardline,39lz02,CraziBoi94,5,Sat Jun 13 12:03:51 2015 UTC,"I highly doubt this deal will revive the less than 3K player count. That being said, I bought it to try it out. If it sucks, I can refund & if it doesnt, I can refund for a PS4 version. Sad to see the PC version so dead, not used to that for a BF title."
BF_Hardline,39lz02,UnLeadedApe,4,Fri Jun 12 20:47:19 2015 UTC,I just think we could solve some problems on XB1 by pitting it in EA Access. And thats coming from someone who preordered

BF_Hardline,39lz02,ixcuincle,1 point,Sat Jun 13 16:14:47 2015 UTC,"The game is a good game. The teams are imbalanced but it's always been like that. All the good people stack the good teams and the bad people and new joiners get the brunt of the ass kicking.   The biggest complaint I had about this game is basically the same I had about previous games, and this was the balance issue, and I don't think it's an issue with the specific game, this has been going on for as long as I can remember. It's just how people are. Shit needs to be autobalanced."
BF_Hardline,39lz02,EliteDangerous,1 point,Sat Jun 13 03:37:34 2015 UTC,"I hear you, the problem with auto balance is that it'll never give you ""fair play"" lots of people that are playing together are also on team speak and using the join on friend feature where it keeps you all in one squad.  Some clans take it a bit far by moving ""pubs"" to the other team and owning the crap out of you by team stacking."
BF_Hardline,39lz02,dirtymuffins23,0,Sat Jun 13 09:35:26 2015 UTC,What I dont get is the ones going around hating on the game are literally just wasting their own time. If they hate it so much why be on a sub for the game first off. Why not just go back to a game they actually enjoy? This sub really is full of salty players and it makes it almost not worth the effort to even try and start a conversation about this game.
BF_Hardline,39lz02,nastylep,1 point,Sat Jun 13 02:41:07 2015 UTC,I think this sub is full of fans of the battlefield franchise who hope the developers and producers don't make the same mistakes with BF5 or what ever the next iteration might be
BF_Hardline,39lz02,BeerGogglesFTW,-4,Sun Jun 14 22:16:44 2015 UTC,"Imo, its too late for 50% off.  50% off is what people wanted when the game was new... couple days, weeks old. Back when it had a population, but not an impressive one. So people knew what was going to happen.  Now its a dying game on PC. That, imo, degrades the value much more. While I would have paid $30 on or near launch... Now I'm looking to pay ~$10, for a game that won't have a playable community for very long."
BF_Hardline,39lz02,proROKexpat,-3,Sat Jun 13 01:40:59 2015 UTC,See this has me debating if I'm even going get the game. IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN like $29.99 MAYBE $49.999 WITH PREMIUM it was an expansion pack not a full blown game.

BF_Hardline,39lz02,Compunerd3,3,Sat Jun 13 09:40:40 2015 UTC,I had 7 players but people keep leaving.
BF_Hardline,39lz02,antiko,1 point,Sat Jun 13 10:41:18 2015 UTC,Ran a 64 player server first 2 months it was out. Only during the first 2 weeks we were able to get it completely filled up but after that there was a steady decline. More and more platoon members going back to BF4 and once GTA was out we had troubles even getting 16 players on. Tried a lot of combinations with adaptive server size and changing map cycles but the player numbers simply weren't there.
BF_Hardline,39lz02,TheLinthus,4,Sat Jun 13 14:11:13 2015 UTC,I just think that the first DLC should be free for pre-orderers

On the other hand and jokes aside, I'm really interested in what Premium owner will think of the new DLC (You, 10 of you Premium Owners out there, better report back!).  It looks cool and, slowly, they are balancing out the game.  Looking forward to ARM update and it'll be fun as hell to play Enforcer class."
BF_Hardline,39lz02,cutlerf,2,Fri Jun 12 21:50:29 2015 UTC,Is this only for pc? And is this temporary like the steam sales?

BF_Hardline,39lz02,cutlerf,2,Sat Jun 13 02:19:00 2015 UTC,Are you on PC or console? If you are on console there are plenty of players. On pc you may have some trouble finding a server. Either way check the filters you have selected in the server browser.
BF_Hardline,39lz02,datb0ymark,3,Sat Jun 13 02:29:24 2015 UTC,PC...it hard to find stuff. I'm regretting

The filters have always been difficult to work with and you always have to tweak them to try to find servers that were invisible before.   I want to play blood money and heist and those servers are basically nonexistent.

BF_Hardline,39lz02,elfez,2,Sat Jun 13 05:32:11 2015 UTC,"Well I finally picked this up yesterday as I got it for $20. I'm glad I didn't pay more. Not because it's a bad game per se, it's just not a very good one either. The TTK is truly horrid. The game doesn't look particularly good. The TDM spawning is junk - don't enjoy that mode at all.  CQ is quite good, Hotwire very ""meh"". Heist is entertaining but seems extra prone to team imbalance.   I haven't played enough to comment on the weapon balance, but given most everything else people have said about this game has turned out to be correct I won't be overly shocked if that turns out to also be correct.  And 64 player The Block is indeed a complete clusterfuck. Of the bad variety.  But I can see myself dipping into this now and then, particularly if they fix the TTK."

Problem is however that the game is horrible balanced, there are no patches fixing cruical problems, there are extremeley few people playing the game on PC,  and if you add up all this up you more than likely won't play it if you buy it. Thus it's not worth thirty bucks.  Now vote this down because it's not popular stating the obvious. Don't give a shit. Lets tell it as it is."

One of the major threats is simply small arms because of increased accuracy. Within the first 10 minutes they took 2 damage, on PC they'd have to have repair 3x by then just by small arms. A clip from a battle rifle does 40 close up."
BF_Hardline,39kyks,BillyHoWCR,0,Fri Jun 12 15:14:26 2015 UTC,You're forgetting PC where the game is entirely different but has the same balancing.    I snipe Heli pilots out of vehicle all the time. And I am on X360. (mainly transport pilots... attack choppers are rarely seen)   A clip from a battle rifle does 40 close up.   If a pilot is close up to infantry then it is his fault.
BF_Hardline,39kyks,mylilponyranger,2,Fri Jun 12 17:50:55 2015 UTC,Do you play often?  Edit:  I'm not being salty or anything.  I was shocked to see another 360er.
BF_Hardline,39kyks,BillyHoWCR,0,Fri Jun 12 20:52:07 2015 UTC,I have 250hrs+ in it so far and haven't slowed down. Lately I have been playing a lot of TDM.   I never have an issue finding some quality game play. I mainly play West US servers but you can find me roaming the world every once in awhile.
BF_Hardline,39ilj1,Connor92,56,Thu Jun 11 23:39:21 2015 UTC,You'd have to kill the entire PC player base twice pretty much to get that.
BF_Hardline,39ilj1,ElHugexx,12,Fri Jun 12 03:20:10 2015 UTC,"Twice? The 24h peak is -up- to 3k players, currently there are 1000.   Three to ten full obliterations of the playerbase is all you need. Just...have at it?  :S I think they've quit trying for PC. The Enforcer-only weapons and 100k achievements are pretty much only moves made if you aren't considering your game buggered for population.   How do you sell DLC that only includes weapons for the least played class? How is that supposed to encourage premium purchases?   I don't get it."
BF_Hardline,39ilj1,K-26,4,Fri Jun 12 09:01:29 2015 UTC,That moment when you realize that the low budget indie game Insurgency has a bigger PC population than a multi-million dollar budget AAA title game...
BF_Hardline,39ilj1,malacovics,1 point,Sat Jun 13 10:11:21 2015 UTC,"Just goes to show, it isn't about budgeting or crew, as much as it is about decision making ability and skill as a developer.   Can't say whether time taken factors in, as I don't have that data...but as far as man-hours goes, I have to assume more hours taken for HL, even if the actual Dev cycle ended up shorter."
BF_Hardline,39ilj1,K-26,5,Sat Jun 13 14:42:26 2015 UTC,Twice? or 13.5x times?????
BF_Hardline,39ilj1,Mayor_S,3,Fri Jun 12 11:08:13 2015 UTC,Holy fuck even the console population is weakening. There used to be like 80k on both platforms for current gen. Now it's like 20k.
BF_Hardline,39ilj1,malacovics,11,Sat Jun 13 10:12:21 2015 UTC,"I've played 330+ hours of BF4 and I've only got 12,500 total kills."
BF_Hardline,39ilj1,BionicSammich,-13,Fri Jun 12 02:05:58 2015 UTC,This is not something you want to admit.

BF_Hardline,39ilj1,BionicSammich,0,Fri Jun 12 19:08:32 2015 UTC,No I just meant don't share how many hours you've played in a game. That is 8 1/4 work weeks you've played this game.
BF_Hardline,39ilj1,ncbwilson,0,Wed Jun 17 22:51:49 2015 UTC,"Mate of mine has 766 hours on BF4. I know a guy with 3000+ hours on BF4 alone, not including other BF games."
BF_Hardline,39ilj1,BionicSammich,15,Wed Jun 17 23:21:50 2015 UTC,"Well, that is a bit much. I played BF3 for 800 hours and got 72000 kills total. And note, I played a lot of close quarters which is even more fast paced than Hardline.  In BF4 I only got 25000 kills in 350 hours.  In Hardline 8000 kills in 110 hours. That means it would take me 550 hours more to achieve those... And I'm one of the better players. It will be absolutely ridiculous for worse average players.  I think this is just a hook to keep some people playing the game longer. It's ridiculous. These will end up being some of the least achieved trophies on PS4 history, I'm sure of it. There will be some crazy JRPG trophies that require like 800 hours of gameplay, sure, but these will be up there. Especially if bundled together kind of as one."
BF_Hardline,39ilj1,Nikotiiniko,4,Fri Jun 12 00:39:26 2015 UTC,Play 64 player tdm.
BF_Hardline,39ilj1,GoodWillPower,4,Fri Jun 12 03:52:45 2015 UTC,"The game mode doesn't matter, like, at all. Let's say you do really well in a TDM match, get 30 kills in 15 minutes (it's been so long since i've played Hardline I don't even remember if that's good or not). That means it will take 334 games or 84 hours to get a single achievement/trophy. That is fucking bullshit. The only possible defense of an achievement/trophy like that is that it may keep people  playing."
BF_Hardline,39ilj1,iAmMitten1,0,Fri Jun 12 06:09:41 2015 UTC,An achievement is not something set so that all can have easily. It's a mark of achievement. Or at least that is how it should be in games with content worth playing more than 1 day of
BF_Hardline,39ilj1,GoodWillPower,2,Fri Jun 12 12:42:08 2015 UTC,"Achievements should be difficult, not just massively time consuming."
BF_Hardline,39ilj1,Packersrule123,7,Sat Jun 13 03:46:26 2015 UTC,Hope your previous kills will be taken into account too..
BF_Hardline,39ilj1,nightbass,3,Fri Jun 12 06:37:24 2015 UTC,70h played and only 7444 kills... This would take me around 370 hours to complete... And playing as a sniper even takes longer
BF_Hardline,39ilj1,zunjae,15,Fri Jun 12 12:30:24 2015 UTC,Not hard to tell that they're novice game developers.
BF_Hardline,39ilj1,evengraves,9,Fri Jun 12 01:36:10 2015 UTC,"Or, due to the rapidly declining population, they are just trying to get people to stay with Hardline in a way that probably won't work very well.  Maybe if they gave 100+ GS per achievement, people might attempt this. But 25 per isn't worth it to a majority of people."
BF_Hardline,39ilj1,CarbonCamaroZL1,2,Fri Jun 12 02:36:57 2015 UTC,Isn't the max like 200G per DLC?
BF_Hardline,39ilj1,DANNYonPC,2,Fri Jun 12 14:30:33 2015 UTC,"No, I think they removed limit requirements. Because Forza Horizon 2 launched the Porsche DLC with 500 GS and the same with the Storm Island Expansion. And MCC has 6000 GS, but only 4 1/2 games in it."
BF_Hardline,39ilj1,CarbonCamaroZL1,10,Fri Jun 12 15:50:22 2015 UTC,Visceral are fuckin idiots when it comes to a pvp game. Embarassing really. Tick tock visceral. Doubt we see Hardline 2

BF_Hardline,39ilj1,PraeteritaCautus,1 point,Fri Jun 12 06:21:33 2015 UTC,"The general idea would be to reward players; most of us will recieve one, maybe two, of these achievements/trophies naturally through gameplay assuming we stick to one or two classes with some degree of consistency. Getting all four is a little excessive, however it is meant to be; only the hardcore gamers will be going for platinum, only they should be achieving everything to be achieved.  This sub-reddit is filled with ""these achievements aren't easy enough"" - if they were easy, they wouldn't be achievements.  Personally:   Operator - 3000 kills with G36C alone, weapon license for M16a3, M416, SG533, AKS-74u, AKM, and gold plated for the R0933...   Engineer - Weapon license for the MPX, P90, K10, UMP-45, UZI, M/45, and gold plated for the MP5K & FMG-9...  It really isn't unreasonable to expect 10,000 kills from a class, it isn't even unreasonable to expect it from each class when you consider such is geared at dedicated gamers...

BF_Hardline,39ilj1,RICExTANK,-11,Fri Jun 12 14:01:09 2015 UTC,"I like it. It should be an ACHIEVEMENT, not something everyone and their mother should have in their gamer score/ gamer level. Much like the ill fated syndicate assignments (which I think worked in theory, was just broken gadget/rep system that made it a joke) these SHOULD be hard to get, if not close to impossible. I think people need to get used to working for things/rewards/statuses. Gaming has gotten too whiny lately and too ""I need it now""/ immediate gratification-ish. Good for Visceral for making achievements crazy again."
BF_Hardline,39ilj1,CTthrower,26,Thu Jun 11 23:50:25 2015 UTC,"I'm all for difficult achievements, but this isn't difficult. It's a fucking grind."
BF_Hardline,39ilj1,zoidberg1339,-8,Thu Jun 11 23:54:22 2015 UTC,Sounds like the grind is difficult....
BF_Hardline,39ilj1,BionicSammich,11,Thu Jun 11 23:59:51 2015 UTC,"Difficult is something like Aperture Science in The Orange Box that requires a great amount of skill and preparation. There is very little skill involved in killing 40k people other than the patience to actually go through with it and the ability to actually get kills (which I'd like to think most Battlefield players can do).  Yes, it's difficult, but not in a fun way."
BF_Hardline,39ilj1,lebronaims,8,Fri Jun 12 00:03:43 2015 UTC,"Time consuming doesn't necessarily mean difficult though. It's not like kills with any particular class are special or anything. It's just an overlong slog.  Furthermore, DLC achievements in Battlefield 3 and 4 were relevant to the stuff in the actual DLC. Get x amount of kills with  a new weapon, get wins in a new game mode, or something easter eggy like jump in a certain swimming pool.  Those 10k kill achievements just look like whoever Visceral had come up with the achievements just didn't care."
BF_Hardline,39ilj1,zoidberg1339,3,Fri Jun 12 00:19:11 2015 UTC,"ANYONE can do it, its just doing the same easy thing over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over for no point. It could easily be 10 times easier.  If they wanted it to be difficult, they would have made it kill somebody by shooting a piece of C4 which causes an incoming RPG to veer off course and blow up a Heli. Now whats difficult."
BF_Hardline,39ilj1,DrCommonMan,19,Fri Jun 12 02:08:23 2015 UTC,40k kills is beyond fucking stupid.
BF_Hardline,39ilj1,TheDragonzord,7,Thu Jun 11 23:55:48 2015 UTC,"I don't even have 10,000 kills over all four classes in Battlefield 3 and I played that game quite a bit. I'm not fantastic or anything but that's just an unreal level of time required. 40,000 kills for only 100g? That's ridiculous."
BF_Hardline,39ilj1,Eterniity42,3,Fri Jun 12 00:18:29 2015 UTC,It's to keep people playing for a long time.
BF_Hardline,39ilj1,TehNoobDaddy,1 point,Fri Jun 12 00:44:32 2015 UTC,"Can't be, that's too dumb an idea for them to have. New games come out constantly and gamers only have so much free time. Even dedicated BF players will get a new game really soon. Only reason to play one game for a long ass time is if it's a timeless, exceptional, and lovable game.  So if sixteen years from today droves of people are playing Hardline: Global Offensive then I'll eat my words but it's not going to happen."
BF_Hardline,39ilj1,RICExTANK,-2,Fri Jun 12 02:11:14 2015 UTC,I guess people really don't like that I have a quarter of the kills on one gun as i got 7 down votes while at dinner.  I assume many of the people here are on console. Is it harder to get the kills on console or something?
BF_Hardline,39ilj1,RICExTANK,3,Fri Jun 12 02:27:00 2015 UTC,Yes couldn't agree more. Don't even know why people care about achievements anyway. You can guarantee half the time your team sucks is because a chunk of your team is trying to unlock something worthless and not helping the team.   As you said though it should be an achievement and not being able to have a dessert because you were a good boy and ate all your dinner.
BF_Hardline,39ilj1,RICExTANK,1 point,Fri Jun 12 06:33:12 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying it's not a lot of kills, but it works for those dedicated to getting every acheivement on the game, they'll do it. For those who aren't as worried, they will probably get one of the four eventually.  Don't get me wrong, I'd love to do it, but I know I'm just not going to realistically hit all 4 with all the other games coming out this month. Which doesn't bother me."
BF_Hardline,39ilj1,pandaridingatrex,1 point,Fri Jun 12 00:00:20 2015 UTC,"I don't know. I think even those who would have liked to get all the achievements have been put off by this list. This is a proper enthusiasm killer like GoW's ""100,000 kills"" achievements.   I get what you mean about achievements being difficult to the point that not everyone should obtain them, but there are easier ways than this. Most people who play Hardline probably aren't very interested in achievements anyway, so why burden the few who actually enjoy hunting for these little accomplishments? It just seems kinda stupid."
BF_Hardline,39ilj1,GregoryGoose,4,Fri Jun 12 00:10:22 2015 UTC,"I see your point and I don't neccessarily disagree, I'm just ok with what it is I guess."
BF_Hardline,39ilj1,Eterniity42,2,Fri Jun 12 00:23:52 2015 UTC,Fair enough. While I don't agree I get what you mean and respect how you kept the conversation rather civil. Makes a change from what I'm used to seeing on reddit.

BF_Hardline,39joh2,fanciestmango,-2,Fri Jun 12 07:27:16 2015 UTC,"i'll be that guy: c'mon, man. if you want to play deathmatch, go play deathmatch. games like blood money are extremely frustrating when both teammates and opponents are purposely and selfishly ignoring the objective. i'm glad you have personal goals within the game, but it's not cool to do it at the server's expense."
BF_Hardline,39joh2,FalconiiLV,2,Fri Jun 12 11:40:24 2015 UTC,"And I did run money, I can kill and do that? I found people at the pile very often fully loaded, I'd grab that and go"
BF_Hardline,39joh2,fanciestmango,2,Fri Jun 12 14:29:53 2015 UTC,Why the hell would you assume he wasn't playing the objective?
BF_Hardline,39joh2,gardenlevel,2,Fri Jun 12 15:31:02 2015 UTC,it is a reasonable assumption given that his title emphasizes his intent to rack up kills.
BF_Hardline,39joh2,fanciestmango,2,Fri Jun 12 16:11:43 2015 UTC,He also has the most cash in the game...
BF_Hardline,39joh2,JasonKesler,0,Fri Jun 12 12:37:11 2015 UTC,"agreed, he does. but a 100% elimination boost plus all the kill modifier/assist bonuses could account for all those points (i.e., 7300 x 2 + X = 16000+ points)."
BF_Hardline,39joh2,slugo17,1 point,Fri Jun 12 13:12:32 2015 UTC,I had no boosts FYI
BF_Hardline,39joh2,JasonKesler,1 point,Fri Jun 12 14:27:57 2015 UTC,I can agree but my teammates were doing the same thing.
BF_Hardline,39joh2,TehNoobDaddy,-2,Fri Jun 12 14:28:20 2015 UTC,Here are some of my best rounds. Breaking 100 is a really special moment.

Best of luck to you
BF_Hardline,39joh2,Ruckingfeturd,1 point,Fri Jun 12 06:09:50 2015 UTC,The games you broke 100 on were almost an hour long... the first one you posted was your best.  95 kills in 30 minutes is pretty good!
BF_Hardline,39joh2,rev_me_bro,1 point,Wed Jun 17 23:58:58 2015 UTC,"You're right! 3 of those 6 were 30 minutes. I didn't look at it like that. The 3 rounds that were 30 minutes, I did 95, 96, and 100. My 140+ kill round and 110 kill round were an hour long. I love looking at old battlereports. :)"

BF_Hardline,39ma7w,FalconiiLV,1 point,Fri Jun 12 22:59:59 2015 UTC,I love the AKM.  Classic look and a lot of power.  Run ironsights for lolz.  Shame they nerfed the long range ability.
BF_Hardline,39ma7w,nerdz0r,1 point,Fri Jun 12 23:20:29 2015 UTC,I love the AKM. It's not OP and it's manly and shit. I hate M16 etc. Too good and modern.

BF_Hardline,39ma7w,nutcrackr,1 point,Sat Jun 13 08:27:47 2015 UTC,No. I think most people have a favorite. Mine is the FMG9 with almost 4k kills. I change it up but that's my go to gun.
BF_Hardline,39ma7w,rev_me_bro,1 point,Sat Jun 13 10:36:09 2015 UTC,Not at all. My stats are on the way to lookin pretty similar but with the sg553
BF_Hardline,39ma7w,mjxa1,1 point,Sun Jun 14 00:38:25 2015 UTC,Dude good for you! I couldn't get to like the sg553. I was disappointed with the lowered RPM from BF4. What setup do you have on it??
BF_Hardline,39ma7w,mjxa1,1 point,Sun Jun 14 03:31:21 2015 UTC,"Sorry for the wait on the response, but i use extended mag, heavy barrel, stubby grip, and the kobra sight. Yeah, i know what you mean about the RPM, but the recoil is minimal which is the biggest deal for me since i'm fairly new to BF (hardline is the only one i've played at length) and i'm trying to get used to the sensitivy, control, aim assist, etc., but at the moment my aim with anything except a shotgun is horrendous."
BF_Hardline,39ma7w,mjxa1,1 point,Tue Jun 16 00:56:22 2015 UTC,You're brave for using the heavy barrel and extended mag combo. Too much spread for me lol. I'm just a little irritated with the range nerf they gave the AKM. But oh well just deal with it and move on right?  Are you on XB1 or ps4?
BF_Hardline,39ma7w,Pablo_Cristo,1 point,Tue Jun 16 01:02:17 2015 UTC,"neither, i'm ps3. The struggle is truly real."
BF_Hardline,39ma7w,Packersrule123,1 point,Tue Jun 16 01:15:43 2015 UTC,No worries man I just barely made the jump from PS3 to the Xbox one.
BF_Hardline,39ma7w,Packersrule123,0,Tue Jun 16 01:23:37 2015 UTC,There's quite a bit of other guns that are fun imo... I as well enjoy the AKM though. To each his own.
BF_Hardline,39ma7w,Packersrule123,0,Fri Jun 12 19:29:40 2015 UTC,Nope. The only gun on the criminal side besides the AWM that I really find myself using. I'm not even really a fan of the 416. One thing that I also noticed is that sights added to it only increase the recoil. What do you think?
BF_Hardline,39jfq0,Ambrosial,2,Fri Jun 12 03:41:36 2015 UTC,Im wondering too as im getting close to rank 150
BF_Hardline,39jfq0,Tboe013,2,Fri Jun 12 04:06:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I already have my 10 million too. So there really is nothing else for me to achieve except gold guns and all the hard syndicates. I just want to know it I would lose my Dino and fox mask, cash, boosts, gold guns etc."
BF_Hardline,39jfq0,cutlerf,-1,Fri Jun 12 04:13:00 2015 UTC,Battlefield games don't have prestige. There will be new achievements and content in DLCs don't worry.     Edit: Apparently there is a prestige mode. Surprisingly they haven't figured out how to do it yet.
BF_Hardline,39jfq0,INFsleeper,4,Fri Jun 12 10:13:39 2015 UTC,"Hardline will, it was advertised as a premium feature"
BF_Hardline,39jfq0,SplitVision,-4,Fri Jun 12 11:10:27 2015 UTC,"Seriously? What a joke.  I knew this game was going to be sort of a crossover between BF and CoD, but the damn thing is apparently aspiring to be more like CoD than BF."
BF_Hardline,39jfq0,TehDarkArchon,2,Fri Jun 12 11:24:14 2015 UTC,"Yep, it's called ""Legendary Status"" in HL. No ETA on it though. It'll probably when the rest of the premium features drop, whenever that is."
BF_Hardline,39jfq0,cutlerf,-2,Fri Jun 12 12:41:17 2015 UTC,"Wow I assumed they wouldn't get that desperate. And they haven't even released ""Legendary Status"" yet. I don't know what is more of a joke."
BF_Hardline,39jfq0,SirManguydude,3,Fri Jun 12 19:50:53 2015 UTC,"Based on how it was described, it is much closer to the Infamy system in Payday 2, where you can only unlock certain items with certain Legendary status."
BF_Hardline,39jejx,hhaattrriicckk,3,Fri Jun 12 03:31:14 2015 UTC,"It is called Tactical Toolkit. You don't really see any change to character at all. Its kind of like having Stealth training.  ""The Tactical Toolkit increases interaction speed on objectives, be it planting Heist charges, taking cash from Blood Money vaults, untying Rescue hostages, and more!"""
BF_Hardline,39jejx,Eterniity42,2,Fri Jun 12 05:03:30 2015 UTC,"Imagine a Hackers trojan on the money pile, how it speeds it up. This is how interaction is sped up.  Defusing a heist vault charge with it takes 1 second. its really fast."
BF_Hardline,39jejx,JasonKesler,2,Fri Jun 12 06:02:52 2015 UTC,In the twitch stream they said something about a door opener thingy.
BF_Hardline,39jejx,tentoesup747,2,Fri Jun 12 03:47:25 2015 UTC,I saw 'breaching rounds' in the kill feed from a shotgun kill?
BF_Hardline,39jejx,tentoesup747,2,Fri Jun 12 04:17:44 2015 UTC,I think that is something different
BF_Hardline,39jejx,ACovers,1 point,Fri Jun 12 06:37:26 2015 UTC,Did it really? I haven't watched much dlc footage but I was assuming the breaching rounds would still show up  as the shotgun you're using in the killfeed
BF_Hardline,39jejx,Tboe013,1 point,Fri Jun 12 16:20:02 2015 UTC,Forgot what its called but it speeds up objective times...like getting money from tge pile will be faster then if you didnt have it equipped...or when you break into the vault in heist it will be faster then someone who doesnt have it equipped
BF_Hardline,39jejx,K-26,1 point,Fri Jun 12 04:09:40 2015 UTC,Thank you. Kinda underwhelming.
BF_Hardline,39jejx,nutcrackr,1 point,Fri Jun 12 04:19:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah...it does make you boss at pressing E/X/Square, though.   For MLG levels of meta-synergy, use the ballistic shield to protect your back while you face the interaction object, or smoke/flash grenades to make a ninja in/out.   Or bring ammo and be useful, like a -good- enforcer. :/"

BF_Hardline,39jejx,GregoryGoose,2,Fri Jun 12 10:23:41 2015 UTC,"no  Unless you find a really cool glitch, no."
BF_Hardline,39jejx,DANNYonPC,1 point,Fri Jun 12 12:23:08 2015 UTC,"Well, maybe if they invited me to the private events, I could. Now I hear they are patching the only skywalk glitch before the DLC even sees the light of day? Come on. The veteran glitching community is not pleased."
BF_Hardline,39jejx,GregoryGoose,2,Fri Jun 12 21:40:44 2015 UTC,Me and ponylion are sorry :p
BF_Hardline,39jejx,DANNYonPC,1 point,Fri Jun 12 22:14:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah no hard feelings, I can't win them all. Besides which, the fact that it caught them by surprise bodes well that their attempt to fix it may end up making it worse. This type of barrier is present on all the non-vehicle maps like grow house, the block, bank job- they typically stick them against buildings so people can't get up there as they tell the grapple and ziplines that they are out of bounds, but when they move or misplace them, and they overlook a way to get on top of them, you can sky walk a bit. Above the entrance of the bank this is possible for instance. So my suspicion is that this was meant to be an asset placed over one specific roof that they either forgot to move down to the surface level or moved up when they decided to let people on the roof after all. An innocent mistake until you introduce a vehicle into the map. Suddenly there is a way on top of it. So the question becomes whether they will fix it by moving it, resizing it, or deleting it entirely."
BF_Hardline,39gx9w,Vicentecab,6,Thu Jun 11 17:18:24 2015 UTC,I'm looking forward to this map.  It's so much what I've been looking for in a map.
BF_Hardline,39gx9w,wda_exodus,3,Thu Jun 11 18:37:08 2015 UTC,Really nice to play! But the snipers with DMRs :( still nerfs friends to play on but it's a really interesting one and it change of BF4 flat maps. Reminds me kiasar railroad with more threes.
BF_Hardline,39gx9w,TehDarkArchon,2,Thu Jun 11 18:55:11 2015 UTC,Same here. Definitely the best looking map of the 4 imo.
BF_Hardline,39gx9w,CrossBones3129,2,Thu Jun 11 21:16:21 2015 UTC,Its what you look forward to because its similar to a BF map from previous games.
BF_Hardline,39gx9w,wda_exodus,2,Fri Jun 12 06:47:56 2015 UTC,No.  It's because it looks like Endor. BAZINGA!
BF_Hardline,39gx9w,DANNYonPC,3,Fri Jun 12 10:57:14 2015 UTC,"Yea, its a really pretty map"
BF_Hardline,39he8e,Vicentecab,1 point,Thu Jun 11 18:56:36 2015 UTC,Looks like you're going to want to run with Assistant boost if you use the M1A1.
BF_Hardline,39he8e,FalconiiLV,1 point,Thu Jun 11 21:00:34 2015 UTC,"Lol no it's beast imo. It was just my first round, then it get better. Not much recoil, you can shoot to medium range with precision. I enjoyed it much."
BF_Hardline,39he8e,RICExTANK,0,Thu Jun 11 23:26:40 2015 UTC,"Ugh, iron sights seem gross though."
BF_Hardline,39he8e,wda_exodus,1 point,Fri Jun 12 00:26:14 2015 UTC,Imo it was quite fine.
BF_Hardline,39gwg9,wda_exodus,12,Thu Jun 11 17:13:49 2015 UTC,I'm worried what the pc community will look like once this fractures the 1500 people worldwide left playing bfh.
BF_Hardline,39gwg9,Tylerdurden516,2,Thu Jun 11 17:29:51 2015 UTC,"They are doing all they can to open it up to everybody.  Problem is they intially sold it as a perk for premium members.  Now there's a huge EA marketing hurdle to get over.  Trust me, Visceral wants it as bad as we do."
BF_Hardline,39gwg9,ACovers,7,Thu Jun 11 17:37:13 2015 UTC,"I mean, ideally, I think they should refund all of the current people on PC with premium and give premium to everyone on PC for free.  Let's be real though, this is a videogame company we're talking about here  I'm not a PC player, if that's worth anything to anyone"
BF_Hardline,39gwg9,EliteDangerous,3,Thu Jun 11 18:33:52 2015 UTC,"even if they wanted to - logistically this would be a nightmare, all other platforms would want a refund, how do you handle the ones who purchased at retail?   With Titanfall they made the DLC maps free but nobody was refunded - but some time had expired before they did that.    I still think an interesting option would be to make the maps available to everyone but lock the XP and extra guns/gadgets to only those who purchased the DLC.  If you have standard or deluxe you can play the maps but you won't gain XP while playing them."
BF_Hardline,39gwg9,ACovers,0,Thu Jun 11 21:33:37 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying it would be easy, I'm just saying this would be pretty much the only way to make amends with the PC community. Sure, you will have people complaining from the console versions, but they haven't had to put up with the same bs PC players have.  I have premium on the xbone, and I still think the PC users deserve the content for free. I'd be pissed if I dropped 120 dollars on this for the ultimate and wasn't even able to find a match with decent ping."
BF_Hardline,39gwg9,evilpineapple98,1 point,Fri Jun 12 00:23:12 2015 UTC,"Wait, I'm lost what's the problem with PC premium?"
BF_Hardline,39gwg9,ACovers,1 point,Fri Jun 12 02:38:56 2015 UTC,"Nothing is wrong with premium itself (unless you count features that still aren't out yet that they announced at launch), its the status of the game online. There's somewhere around 4,000 players at peak times on PC worldwide. A lot of players can't even matchmake into a decent server with ping < 100 ms.  The reason I brought up premium was because the dlc is going to split their tiny community even more. If everyone on pc had access to the dlc for free, this wouldn't happen. There's a big mix of players who have premium and don't have it at all, and the people who haven't already bought premium are very very likely to not purchase premium (or even the first dlc) at all.  Having new maps in exclusive playlists is going to make it even harder for them to find a match."
BF_Hardline,39gwg9,TehDarkArchon,1 point,Fri Jun 12 11:48:05 2015 UTC,"As a PC player, I strongly agree with this sentiment. Something this drastic is the only real way they're gonna bring enough players back to make this game worth it on PC (I can already tell the content from XP1 isn't going to do it.) If they can ignite a thriving PC community again they'd probably make back their lost sales in copies sold of the base game."
BF_Hardline,39gwg9,cadgers,-1,Thu Jun 11 20:11:32 2015 UTC,They'll have to do something for sure.

BF_Hardline,39gwg9,NaturalSelectionDied,1 point,Thu Jun 11 19:32:02 2015 UTC,So what do tracer rounds do to your weapon stats? Or is it just something to see where your bullets are landing
BF_Hardline,39gwg9,grahamalondis,1 point,Thu Jun 11 20:25:40 2015 UTC,"Unless they somehow changed it in bfh (since I don't currently own the game), they basically allow you to see your bullets come out of your gun.

BF_Hardline,39hlar,BillyHoWCR,2,Sat Jun 13 03:08:02 2015 UTC,"I don't, and I could care less about your constant probing. The DLC is out in 4 days, so just chill the fuck out. The Beat just isn't large enough for Hotwire, it's like the B flag of the Block With a larger street and some more houses outside of that - it just doesn't work. But since you speculate and make false claims all the time, go ahead and take everything I say as false. Look for it yourself - the developers twitters are bare as of late due to their hard work."
BF_Hardline,39hlar,JasonKesler,-2,Sat Jun 13 03:33:46 2015 UTC,"Chill man... tell us why there are vehicles on the map? What game mode needs vehicles if it is too small to drive any place as you claim?  Simply seeing the obvious that there are vehicles on the map. A NEW vehicle even low-rider was added to the DLC, do you think they wouldn't use it?"
BF_Hardline,39hlar,BillyHoWCR,1 point,Sat Jun 13 04:28:54 2015 UTC,"You're ignoring my point: Who cares if you can drive down a few streets? The Beat has a spawn car as well as Sedans... because it's a street surrounding houses. So of course there are cars but the design of the map, which allows for cars as transports just wouldn't work as Hotwire. Sorry for continually finding the loopholes in your argument."
BF_Hardline,39hlar,JasonKesler,-1,Sat Jun 13 04:46:19 2015 UTC,"The Beat has a spawn car as well as Sedans... because it's a street surrounding houses.   Name any other map that has spawn vehicles that doesn't have Hotwire?   What are you supposed to do in these vehicles if not drive them?  Have you played 'The Beat' already? How do you know a larger version of the map is not available? As with Riptide and Derailed... each has a small TDM version of the map and then larger Hotwire version of the map.   How is this not possible with 'The Beat'?   If the developer says their is no Hotwire then I would likely have to see his remarks to believe they weren't just made up.   And I am also very curious to know what game mode has vehicles (a brand new vehicle by the way, create just for this map) that aren't going to be driven around the map except as you seem to be insinuating just to get from one place to the other??"
BF_Hardline,39hlar,BillyHoWCR,1 point,Sat Jun 13 09:46:13 2015 UTC,"Also let me raise this. Because pearl market in bf4 can hold an Amtrak and quads it should be large enough for Hotwire? It's not, because the point of Hotwire isn't to have choke points. Hotwire works best on maps like Riptide, Dust Bowl because you can do so many routes, drive so many ways to avoid threats. You really can't do that on a smaller map like pearl marker, which is probably the map closest in size to the Beat."
BF_Hardline,39hlar,JasonKesler,-2,Sat Jun 13 03:37:54 2015 UTC,Also let me raise this. Because pearl market in bf4 can hold an Amtrak and quads it should be large enough for Hotwire?   WHAT? Bf4 doesn't have Hotwire. This has nothing to do with the issue.
BF_Hardline,39hlar,BillyHoWCR,1 point,Sat Jun 13 04:30:26 2015 UTC,It's not a matter of game but a matter of size of map and routes through the map. You ignored what I had to say about the size and routes and saw BF4 and tuned the rest out. The maps are roughly the same size... and Hotwire wouldn't work on Pearl Market and won't be on Beat
BF_Hardline,39hlar,JasonKesler,-1,Sat Jun 13 04:43:48 2015 UTC,It's not a matter of game but a matter of size of map and routes through the map.   Most of the maps we have now have different versions depending on what game mode is being played. Are you saying it just isn't possible to have a medium sized map version of 'The Beat' for Hotwire?
BF_Hardline,39hlar,BillyHoWCR,2,Sat Jun 13 09:48:39 2015 UTC,"Well, that sucks"
BF_Hardline,39hlar,GregoryGoose,-2,Fri Jun 12 00:25:40 2015 UTC,No it doesn't. Hotwire is a horrible game type that shouldn't have been conceived in the first place.

BF_Hardline,39hlar,BillyHoWCR,-2,Fri Jun 12 13:12:13 2015 UTC,"I read a post awhile back that said all new DLC maps would have Hotwire?  Edit: actually this is the remark i read:   One of the best things about Backwoods is that it can be played in any mode,    So only Backwoods was mentioned as having every mode available. But The Beat does show low riders in the video."
BF_Hardline,39hlar,BillyHoWCR,-2,Fri Jun 12 12:56:54 2015 UTC,"I am thinking 'Code Blue' is comparable to 'Grow House', The Beat' is comparable to 'The Block' (though the video shows it has low riders so likely a Hotwire mode there?), 'Black Friday' is comparable to 'Downtown', and 'Backwoods' is comparable to 'Everglades'?  Note: this just assumptions based off of seen videos."

Would have loved to see a Mk14 for the Cops and maybe the Modernized SKS for the criminals and maybe a Tavor thrown in there. They definitely need to throw in some diversity and sprinkle little things here and there.   That being said, I'm excited to see the direction they go with the add-in features and the DLCs having such a different feel....could continually add some beneficial variety in to the game throughout its life cycle.

I mean, compare day 1 beta stats with the ROF´s of all the weapons in the levelcap closed alpha weapon showcase:  The SA got a flat ROF increase of 150, no adjustment of recoil (leading to the hilarious situation where it for a long time was the most stabile BR), removal of its uniquely larger magazine  The HK got a flat ROF decrease of 100, no adjustment of recoil which is why it ended up significantly worse than the SA  The HCAR got its ""heavy hitter"" status removed which was the excuse for its recoil. instead of bringing it back they merely neutered its recoil, killing the feel of the weapon.  The RO933 initially had a rate of fire of 900, and was made to get noobs in the game with quite some speed. This was also why its release recoil was so ridiculous.  The AKS used to have a rate of fire of 600, which is why its spread increase is so microscopic.  The G36C and ACWR both used to have 50 ROF less, and also got a flat increase.

BF_Hardline,39kxrj,SplitVision,7,Fri Jun 12 13:22:53 2015 UTC,"I constantly see this (i.e., not this post) annoying circlejerk of BF clearly being better than CoD, and anyone who plays CoD is somehow less of a person. (E.g. ""go play CoD, loser"")  You're allowed to like both. You don't have to give exclusive attention or preference to one or the other. Fuck me, I love BF, but last night I had a ton of fun playing CoD:AW, despite thinking I would suck at first.   But:   Can you even imagine that level of stupidity?   Imo, the level of perceived ""stupidity"" is directly correlated with the level of thinking the game is something to be taken very seriously. Or one's own time, which is fair - but not a reason to harshly demean other people."
BF_Hardline,39kxrj,kibblznbitz,1 point,Fri Jun 12 13:59:32 2015 UTC,"Nobody is saying that BF is better than COD, the only thing both games share in common is that they are FPS genres and that's where it ends.   I was an avid COD player also. I played UO and loved it to bits. However COD now is more renowned for TDM/Party games and less for it's objective game modes.   Battlefield is renowned for Rush/Conquest where team and objective based play is higher priority than TDM.   Now when we say chasing COD sales, dumbed down for COD players etc what we mean is that the game has drastically been changed to suit those type of players. Moreover, COD is just littered with kiddies now whereas historically BF has had a more ""maturer"" demographic.   We can see how BF has been dumbed down over the years and chases a slice of COD pie with camos, masks, low ttk, poor map design for Rush and Conquest, health regen, nerfing jet turn speed, not including Classic modes etc.    I don't want to tarnish all COD players with the same brush but when I play BF now I see less PTFO every year and the reason for that is because DICE now want a new target audience (COD players) so the game is being intentionally dumbed down to cater for them hence why on PC Hardline is a giant flop."
BF_Hardline,39kxrj,majnu1,0,Fri Jun 12 15:34:27 2015 UTC,"I didn't mean to point fingers at CoD with a ""that game is shit"" attitude. I meant to say that I'm not really being given a reason to choose to play Hardline instead of CoD, since they are already a lot more similar than BF4 and CoD and getting even more similar with the upcoming DLC and certain premium features (legendary status, etc).  I like both franchises. I mean, I play them both, so I'd be dumb to say one is much better than the other. It's just that my idea of fun is (most of the time) winning. Sure, I can screw around with random setups and shit, but I don't completely neglect the objective of the game mode I'm playing. Neither do I disregard enemy threats because I'm too lazy to bother. But being one of seemingly very few who actually bother to take out vehicles, or use them properly, really kills the fun.  If I get destroyed by the enemy team because I'm not as good as them, I wouldn't mind it that much. In fact, hopefully I'd learn something from it. But getting destroyed because I'm the only one on my team that gives a shit, even if it's a very small shit, is frustrating as hell. I find it equally frustrating when my team is completely annihilating the enemies. I'm looking for competition in a PvP multiplayer game, not a chance to steamroll people.  Perhaps I was out of line with that comment, but I would imagine people want to play the game (any game in fact) to its full potential. Apparently, that's incredibly naive.

Also, even youtubers who are paid by EA are starting to lose faith in this game. It is a bit concerning for a game that could be awesome but isn't getting that much attention from developers. For example, I know that the gun bench wasn't advertised to be available on release, however that should be released at least by the time of the first dlc."
BF_Hardline,39jymr,nightbass,0,Fri Jun 12 07:11:00 2015 UTC,I kinda mean dead/dying in terms of support. Not player base. Took a month for a patch to nerf a couch. Must be 4 guys left working on the game
BF_Hardline,39jymr,A_McKinney,0,Fri Jun 12 07:14:51 2015 UTC,I gotcha. Not that its the biggest deal and maybe I am wrong but I haven't seen Visceral on this sub for a while. radio silence. That also worries me.   Edit: Magically a dev shows up
BF_Hardline,39jymr,A_McKinney,0,Fri Jun 12 07:17:51 2015 UTC,Didn't expect that.
BF_Hardline,39jymr,FredTuna,-3,Fri Jun 12 15:06:20 2015 UTC,I play on PS4. It will die because people will slowly leave. I just refuse to play till they fix netcode. BF4's is way better.

BF_Hardline,39jymr,fletch420man,7,Fri Jun 12 08:55:02 2015 UTC,BF4 network and QoL improvements are more important to many people then expasnions.

At this point, the first DLC is dropping, and these features still aren't present.

BF_Hardline,39jymr,HaruhiAA,8,Fri Jun 12 17:58:07 2015 UTC,"I really feel sorry for you guys honestly. Let me start of by saying I didn't buy the game and I am a ""Battlefield"" fan. I won't go into the reasons why based on beta feedback as I have listed them out before, but let me say one thing is that I didn't fall for the Ronku BS hype train and paid of journalist articles.   Now you chose to publish the game based on your target audience's feedback and telemetry which is mainly Youtubers and now it seems they have done a U turn just because the server population is low and the majority of the community abandoned the game.  Battlefield seems to be stuck between a rock and a hard place and catering the game to chase COD sales isn't in the root of ""Battlefield"".  It seems Visceral have been used as a scapegoat as we all had become tired of the DICE/EA lies, trolling from community managers and poorly released titles spanning a couple of years.   That is not your fault but as gamers we pay our hard earned money to be entertained by video games, have banter with friends and random gamers, engage in competitive games, participate in esports and grow with the community etc. The cracks started showing along time ago but now we're left with san andreas fault.  It would have been so much of an achievement for Visceral if you made bad Company 3 which stayed true to the roots of it's predecessors. However, when we read articles that state  Karl-Magnus Troedsson din't know why it was such a colossal hit we're just left gob smacked by the retardness that goes on at upper management in DICE.  http://mp1st.com/2014/06/24/dice-ponders-made-bad-company-iconic/#.VXrIQflVgvk  I just don't know how you can move on with Hardline especially when people weren't even enticed by the 40% origin sale that occurred a couple of months after release, all DLC will do is further fracture an already sparse community on PC."
BF_Hardline,39jymr,wda_exodus,2,Fri Jun 12 11:55:29 2015 UTC,Much more well laid out than my comment- thanks.
BF_Hardline,39jymr,cutlerf,1 point,Fri Jun 12 13:34:51 2015 UTC,Very well stated.
BF_Hardline,39jymr,P33KAJ3W,5,Fri Jun 12 12:32:12 2015 UTC,"And currently, the vast majority of our time goes towards making the expansion packs.   Terrible excuse lmao. I dont even care if thats rude, theres more important problems with this game than releasing the DLC."
BF_Hardline,39jymr,cutlerf,6,Fri Jun 12 09:45:41 2015 UTC,"Fully functional and balanced gameplay is what will keep the majority of players interested in a multiplayer game. Once a game is balanced properly, then, and only then, new content can be prioritized.  Perhaps it's EA that's forcing you to spend your time on DLC rather than balancing weapons, fixing invisible collision boxes, etc (which wouldn't surprise me). Either way, the flaws in the vanilla version of the game is what turns people off the most. Lack of content is secondary."
BF_Hardline,39jymr,HaruhiAA,2,Fri Jun 12 11:21:27 2015 UTC,"Thank you for replying. Before launch you guys were all about the community, since then you've kind of went dark.  I understand patches take a while but I've had witcher 3 since day 1 and have gotten 5 patches so far. 2 of which were within a week. Grantes their team is like 200, so Hardline's team must be 20.  It's pretty sad that DLC is prioritized because I don't think people will buy dlc until the base game is fixed. I've bought every season pass for BF games and this is the 1st one I skipped and I'm glad I did after hearing everyone who played it voice their opinion.  I agree with what someone else said by asking for the weekely update. Bungie does it with Destiny. People look forward to that weekly update.  I love Hardline. Getting those multikills is so satisfying. The vehicles are fun as hell to ride in and I like a lot of the maps. Just hate thoae invisble barriers all over Everglades.  When Zachulon did the podcast with DRMB I was so excited because he gave a lot of details what was going on."
BF_Hardline,39jymr,TehDarkArchon,1 point,Fri Jun 12 15:45:30 2015 UTC,"You know Zach's interview was a month ago, well after launch.  So was Thad's.  BTW, one of them will be back on real soon once the DLC comes out.  Plus, they'll all be playing Tuesday at 8pm EST with DRMB on our community server."
BF_Hardline,39jymr,wda_exodus,1 point,Fri Jun 12 17:55:04 2015 UTC,"Damn, that puts things in perspective. A month ago they were talking about all these changes and Tuesday most of tthem probably won't even be in the patch. That's cool they'll be back on."
BF_Hardline,39jymr,cutlerf,1 point,Fri Jun 12 18:01:38 2015 UTC,He also said that things like netcode needed to be tested in CTE before they implement them in a patch.  If you recall he said they were worried about making the game unstable if they just threw code in there without properly testing it first.  They felt stability was more important based on community feedback from BF4.
BF_Hardline,39jymr,skillfactor,1 point,Fri Jun 12 19:22:09 2015 UTC,Yes I remember but obviously they weren't able to test it because of the dumb idea of enabling the cte for only the 20 premium pc players. The dev in this thread said dlc comes first before stability improvements. Don't need to defend them man. I understand you want them to come back on your show but let's not mask reality.
BF_Hardline,39jymr,TehDarkArchon,2,Fri Jun 12 19:25:26 2015 UTC,And that sir is why your studio will fail- Your title is flailing in the sand yet you walk past it to the oasis that is more money from the DLC.

Weapons balance patch is ""coming soon"", premium features are ""coming soon."" Honestly with the extra 6 months you've had I would've thought most of these things would be locked down by now...  On another note, that's really disappointing to see Zach act in such an unreasonable way towards criticism. Matimio didn't say he hated HL in his video, he stated that he's disappointed that the PC playerbase is dead and that he didn't think the DLC was worth it for PC because of that (a sentiment that every PC player should agree with), but did indeed recommend it for console."
BF_Hardline,39jymr,galaxion,0,Fri Jun 12 11:57:56 2015 UTC,"Zach's frustration didn't lie in the content of the video.  It's the title of the video and the thumbnail he used for the video.  It didn't match his message in the video at all and basically said don't waste your time getting the DLC, which is not what he said in the video.  Frankly, I'd be pretty upset myself."

With HB it has great range and very easy recoil (tap firing every shot basically) to take out AR players and those SMGs that cannot compete at ranges. It's the gun I have the most kills with on my other account/most used gun."
BF_Hardline,39gv38,blairmichod,1 point,Fri Jun 12 00:01:35 2015 UTC,"Well, it's not good up close, but it's the best sub at range, hence why it's overlooked. It's not the best sub to play as a sub.

BF_Hardline,39ju6k,CheapSkate23,1 point,Fri Jun 12 17:31:02 2015 UTC,"To me personally, $120 is absolutely ridiculous and the $70 that I paid was too much. I just don't enjoy the game as much as I have enjoyed BF3 and BF4. Everyone has differing opinions, and that is mine, but I do respect those who do like this game.  BF:H just feels too fast paced and random ,probably because the TTK doesn't mesh with the play style the previous games have thought me. The weapons are not balanced well IMHO (when your only option is to play operator with an m16 or an m416, I feel like there is something wrong). Team balancing is usually horrible. The netcode leaves something to be desired (bf4 netcode feels better, but some of that might be because of the TTK). Lastly, I don't like some of the mechanics in the game (flinching, over complication of boosts, driving mechanics, body armor, and gas grenades).   Basically, that all adds up to an experience that is rage inducing more often than it is fun. I would have been happy had I played $30 and content if I would have played $40, but I feel like I overplayed even at $70."

BF_Hardline,395poh,crawlerz2468,20,Tue Jun 9 15:09:38 2015 UTC,Yeah; its overly convoluted and poorly thought out.   Seems like battlepack filler due to a lack of alternatives.

BF_Hardline,395poh,GregoryGoose,2,Tue Jun 9 15:57:01 2015 UTC,"I entirely agree. The boosts are overly complicated and it locks you out of classes and game modes. One XP boost for all classes and all points is needed. Can't even use one as hacker. I will add to this that the boosts will deplete themselves in unranked matches. That's a bug. I also think that selling the boosts is a waste. 25 points for a 25%?! I could equip it, kill one dude, and get those points anyway. If I could sell it for 2500, a 50% for 5000 and a 100% for 10000, you might have a customer. But I wouldn't consider selling any of them if I could combine them. Even if they combined inefficiently for balance sake- three 50%s for a 100 for instance. Who the hell uses a 25% boost? They just pile up, nothing more! And where are the 200% boosts? I had one when I started the game, now they are all gone, never to return."
BF_Hardline,395poh,rev_me_bro,2,Wed Jun 10 00:01:16 2015 UTC,I think the idea of boosts in BF is fucking stupid to begin with. It fucks with the progression flow and only exists to fill battlepacks. Next time around they should just scrap the whole system and speed up level/weapon/class progression a little bit.

BF_Hardline,395poh,nastylep,1 point,Wed Jun 10 00:07:35 2015 UTC,"Kill modifiers are the points you get for a kill that aren't the points for the kill. So if you would kill someone with money in Blood Money you would get the carrier takedown boosted. Team play is specifically for boosting squad bonuses which if you play in a full squad is actually pretty good. Gearhead is also good if you fly helicopters because it boosts most points you would get in a helicopter and if you play mechanic it boosts vehicle kills/ hits.   I do agree with you that they did complicate it a bit much with this title, but the boosts do work in a much better way in this battlefield. They boost the points in game so during double XP they help alot more and it's easier to get tier 4. I also have a lot of time in this game and not once seen a booster. I have seen the lobbies but never people boosting in them. I play on Xbox one."

BF_Hardline,395poh,packer126,2,Tue Jun 9 14:11:51 2015 UTC,"Apart from the devs coming out and saying it was broken?    We're looking at the Reputation system. Obviously, it's not functioning quite the way we'd like. We'll be moving the goal posts for the tiers (probably bringing Tier 4's cost down to around where Tier 3 is), among other changes (we've talked about allowing you to pre-select the perks too).    Just look at the front page  http://www.reddit.com/r/BF_Hardline/comments/395gkm/in_need_of_a_hacker/  A lot of the boosts stack gadgets on single tiers, so (for example) you have to choose between upgrading your grenade launcher, or your repair gun. If you are a mechanic that doesn't use those gadgets, then its just worthless for you. Add in the perks that don't work, like Fast throw, for example, and the ones that are barely noticeable, like Fast Ready, and the whole system just seems very poor and rushed.    Its kind of amazing that some of these glaring problems from an open beta persisted into launch.  E: clarity"
BF_Hardline,395poh,JoeModz,1 point,Tue Jun 9 14:18:18 2015 UTC,Well if you are a mechanic that's not using either of them it's hardly a mechanic class. I still don't know why them gave the mechanic the spawn beacon. Armor insert is a bit stupid and was a bad thing to include in the game especially in its current state it's overpowered. They were trying to make the perks class specific and all they have to do is separate those perks a bit.
BF_Hardline,395poh,Nikotiiniko,1 point,Tue Jun 9 15:55:57 2015 UTC,Good tip on the gearhead boost for flying. I'll have to try that out next time.
BF_Hardline,395poh,nastylep,3,Tue Jun 9 13:57:53 2015 UTC,"Visceral took something elementary to the BF franchise and made it stupidly overcomplicated.   Elementary? It has literally only been in one game before Hardline. Surely you are trolling with that line?   But yes, it is overly complicated. They are too specific and I end up not caring about them whatsoever. I'd rather see no boosts at all. They add nothing to the game. If you think the leveling system is too slow, just lower the experience requirements. Imo that is not necessary."
BF_Hardline,395poh,stinkybumbum,2,Tue Jun 9 14:20:21 2015 UTC,If you think the leveling system is too slow   I'd honestly be amazed if anyone thought that.   You can unlock everything you want in this game with the exception of the cosmetic crap in like 6 hours.

BF_Hardline,395poh,Steevio,1 point,Tue Jun 9 22:43:45 2015 UTC,"A boost is just stupid. You pay 50k for a pack, and get boosters that allow you to gain cash more quickly so you can buy more packs in order to get more boosters so you can get more cash... How fucking pointless. Yea sure there's camos and melee weapons to unlock but seriously once you get your favourite one (or if you have a gold one) you will NEVER use the others anyway. Once you get all camos you don't need them anymore and the weapon attachments, seriously?? Like that's worth the 50k. So in all, there's NOTHING you can gain from packs at a certain point, making your money 100% pointless. There's that dinosaur mask tho, but imo it's just retarded and it doesnt fit into the game at all. It's ugly and unlogical. I dont mind if something is unrealistic, but at least let it make some sense. Theres so many cool options for headgear, but no.. dinosaurs and foxes."

BF_Hardline,3970s2,FalconiiLV,3,Tue Jun 9 18:57:53 2015 UTC,You can deploy a zip line and then grapple on to the top of the zip line pole to get up walls slightly too high to vault.

The only way round it would be if the game had a built in system for the admin remove weapons or vehicles on a server. Theres always the argument their paying for the server but it still needs official rules because you have bought the game and should be able to use every feature and item in the game because thats what you payed for.
BF_Hardline,395ncd,A_McKinney,1 point,Tue Jun 9 14:32:28 2015 UTC,Basically anybody should be allowed to play on any rule set agreed upon by the players of a server. There are a lot of servers and one should be able to find something suitable unless being a winning team joiner. My point of view is one should utilize anything given by the game to succeed. Victory should be about outthinking your enemy not about mindless gunfights.

Though, they did create the End Game expansion for BF3.   They also are used to making a different type of game. It has many similarities to Dead Space, at least graphically. They weren't trying to emulate BF4, but instead, create their own game.   Some people like the new direction, and others hate it.  Edit: Edited for correctness (in italics)"

BF_Hardline,397e24,Dylan_Upshall,3,Tue Jun 9 21:26:59 2015 UTC,"Awesome, I remember when I first played Battlefield and I was blown away by the scale and epicness of it.   Unfortunately there is no coop mode, but you can certainly get together as a squad with your buddy and play as a unit. If you are playing conquest (the 64 player domination-like mode), you can enter a squad together, and that will give you the opportunity to spawn on eachother. That way you can give eachother meds/ammo, and revive one another. The best Battlefield experience comes when playing with others."

BF_Hardline,397e24,SplitVision,1 point,Tue Jun 9 20:28:55 2015 UTC,"This is without a doubt your first Battlefield game. The only similarities between BF and CoD is that they're both first person shooters, they both have the game mode Team Deathmatch and they both have gun customization.  Other than that, the games are incredibly different from one another.  Bullet drop/Gravity pull: This basically means that your bullets, rockets, etc, won't necessarily end up exactly where you aimed. The further away your target is, the more you'll notice it (most noticeable with higher magnification scopes).  Actual projectiles: As previously mentioned your bullets are affected by gravity pull, which means you have to compensate for that. In addition to that, the bullets don't have an instant impact (like CoD's hitscan system, which makes the ""bullets"" end up exactly where your crosshair is when the gun is fired), they have different travel speeds (because you're actually firing a projectile). This means you can't always aim right at a moving target and hit them. You'll have to lead your shots, fire infront of the target so the target runs into the bullets.  Destruction: Although Hardline lacks in destructible environment, Battlefield games usually feature highly destructible environments. This includes everything from shattering windows to knock down skyscrapers.  Vehicles: There are vehicles on most maps, in most game modes, in Battlefield. On some maps, in some game modes, there might only be a couple of utility vans for each team, while in other cases there's everything from dirtbikes to attack hellicopters.  Battlefield is not an arena shooter or an arcade shooter. Hardline is a step towards that, but BF4 (which is where most of the hardcore Battlefield players hang at the moment) is probably the closest you're gonna get to a ""casual war simulator"" (I threw casual in there, because it's not an actual war simulator).  But I digress, completely. To answer your question, there is no co-op or single player mode (apart from the campaign). It's an all out multiplayer game, but you can always play with your friends in the same squad."

BF_Hardline,3924n1,crawlerz2468,0,Tue Jun 9 08:46:28 2015 UTC,"I think it's pretty bad. Instead of balancing armored insert they force you to run a certain attachment to counter it. That's more limiting instead of improving gameplay. I think they should change flak jacket and armored insert. Let flak jacket be a selectable gadget, reducing damage from explosions and possibly the damage from molotovs. Armored insert becomes a perk upgrade."
BF_Hardline,3924n1,likkwid,1 point,Tue Jun 9 15:14:30 2015 UTC,"What's that? To counter a gadget, which takes up a slot, they make you use an attachment, which takes up a slot? How dare they! I mean, it isn't as if you could shoot arms, legs, heads... No no no, we are forced to shoot chests, and these absolute monsters are making it a viable option only if we make a trade-off! Kind of like the engineers who are trading off a repair tool, grenade launcher, satellite phone, etc..."
BF_Hardline,3924n1,PraeteritaCautus,1 point,Wed Jun 10 11:33:49 2015 UTC,"grenade launcher and repair tool is hotwire stuff. In deathmatch or non-vehicle play, engineers use armored insert. There is no ""trade off"" when there's one obvious pick for every game mode. It's not so much the actual gadget-for-gadget that's the problem, but just the obvious ""Take this shit to take less damage"" versus ""take this shit to counter people who have taken that other shit to take less damage"". There's tons of good counter-gadget interactions, like teargas and gasmask for example. Both of them are NOT an auto include and are good in certain situations. Armored insert is always picked. It doenst matter if people run the counter, an engineer will probably still prefer it over the other gadgets they can choose from. Lets say everyone uses the counter. Engineer just lost one gadget in that case. Lets say 50% uses the counter. Engineers dont care and still run armored insert because even a 50% less effective armored insert is better over the other gadgets in deathmatch and non vehicle play. And btw, it's not like you have the ""choice"" to shoot at different parts of the body.. You shoot at their general direction and you hit whatever you hit for the most part. The chest and head is the center at which you will be focusing your aim at."
BF_Hardline,3924n1,likkwid,1 point,Thu Jun 11 05:13:03 2015 UTC,"If everyone uses the counter, engineers won't consider the insert an ""auto include"" - if everyone is using the counter, the gadget becomes useless, and if it is useless they will move onto something which is useful. Obviously people will stop running the counter, which will make engineers run the insert again, but after a while it will balance out to the point where engineers play the odds to determine if the insert is worth while.  On the repair tool; it is good for conquest and blood money if you plan to play as a team. Very little effects the outcome as much as gaining air superiority whilst keeping your vehicles alive and theirs dead.  Same goes for the grenade launcher; if you don't run it, their vehicles will probably stay up, and they will probably wreck you until you decide to bring out a grenade launcher. A plus of the grenade launcher, which is why I run it unless I am using the Dino/Wolf mask, is that it can compensate for the lack of range on the engineer guns - can't do enough damage at range? Boom, boom, double grenade launcher, move onto the next target.  The trade-off with the insert as-is can be minimalised because the trade-off is team vs individual - the community here is selfish, no wonder they care too much about the individual to make the team choice. What the new round type does, is remove the guarantee of individual gain - now your insert could mean absolutely nothing, it will help you as little as having a Dino mask.  On aiming; focusing on the chest, when shooting an engineer who obviously has armoured insert, is stupid - especially when you are all complaining about how much is soaks up damage. Next you'll tell me you shoot CAT's with a P90 because you were already holding one and it'd be too difficult to swap to the launcher..."

The Tommy Gun was revealed in leaked images. The Fn FAL is hinted at:   wooden furniture on this weapon gives it a classic look   And as MotoTheBadMofo pointed out, the FAL is known as the ""right arm of the free world"". The UTS-15 is an obvious choice:   futuristic shotgun, 14 rounds   Also, it is already part of BF4, so a return wouldn't be too odd. The SG 510 was a little trickier to figure out, but there were some strong hints   7.62MM X 51MM  24 round magazine  keg style charging handle    The magazine info can be found here (as well as some other nice info) The ""keg style charging handle"" is very particular of Swiss-made rifles, as evidenced from the wikipedia article. This is what it looks like.  None of this except the Tommy Gun is confirmed, to my knowledge, but I think its fair enough to say that these weapons will be the ones added.

BF_Hardline,390hfl,Charles_Yuen,1 point,Tue Jun 9 11:04:10 2015 UTC,I have Premium as well and the calendar has no date on it for the DLC release date. If yours does SS and post it.

BF_Hardline,390hfl,TheBeardedMarxist,7,Mon Jun 8 16:53:48 2015 UTC,Then why are you spending your time leaving comments here?
BF_Hardline,391hma,arokyeah,11,Mon Jun 8 15:48:58 2015 UTC,Or wager matches that would be dope. Everyone that wants to wager on the match can do so.
BF_Hardline,391hma,yosoytupadre,5,Mon Jun 8 15:54:49 2015 UTC,"Wager matches would be so great, although they could possibly take away from the exclusivity of the mask with the 10 mil, because people could abuse the system with purchased servers and competitive game modes that limit to 5 on each side"

BF_Hardline,391hma,IHaveNoFiya,5,Tue Jun 9 16:08:40 2015 UTC,Yeah or they could spend their time making the core game better.

BF_Hardline,391hma,BillyHoWCR,0,Tue Jun 9 06:14:53 2015 UTC,"I think including things like this would be a great way to captivate on the cops/robbers theme. They really could've taken this game in a whole different direction to really expand the theme in general, rather than just have typical bf on smaller maps with modifications, but I digress..."
BF_Hardline,38yz6e,RICExTANK,45,Mon Jun 8 01:02:54 2015 UTC,"Because there is a very immature audience here. Look at the other comments: you have a person who pointed out smugness, in his own smug reply, and someone saying they are going to downvote you simply because they can. I'm not saying ALL people who game are immature, but people who tend to religiously follow a gaming community like this one tend to be the ones with out jobs, much responsibilities, or are younger. Of course this brings along the massive down voting [one person see his comment at 0 points, gets upset, and then goes on a down voting spree as well and it starts a cycle.]"
BF_Hardline,38yz6e,SVT-Cobra,5,Mon Jun 8 03:41:49 2015 UTC,"To be more specific for this subreddit, battlefield subreddits were usually a more mature crowd because of how they were mostly frequented by PC players. Now that Hardline has low population on PC and more on console it is bringing the younger/less mature crowd around (ex: the stereotypical CoD kids)"
BF_Hardline,38yz6e,SpeclalK,5,Mon Jun 8 20:12:44 2015 UTC,"Its just reddit! Always been like this, always will be!"
BF_Hardline,38yz6e,DJ_Lud,8,Mon Jun 8 15:41:16 2015 UTC,"It was better at release because there were quite a few people that enjoyed the game and talked about it positively. Now some of them have left (naturally) and the subreddit is quite small in size now.  Some people here seem to revel in the failure of the game. And then telling everybody about it. I haven't posted much because of it.  Although witcher 3 is consuming a lot of my time at the moment.  The game needs an injection of fresh content and a huge sale to build a larger community. I still quite enjoy playing it, just hoping the CA DLC brings some new life to the game and maybe it will boost the subreddit a little. Edit: I also think a free week on PC would be a good idea."
BF_Hardline,38yz6e,nutcrackr,6,Mon Jun 8 05:05:08 2015 UTC,"Not much discussion goes on here other than the usual topics of moaning about the game, its a shame really. Im looking forward to the CTE going live with updates so, hopefully, some topics can be discussed over at /r/BFH_CTE .   At the moment not much information is getting released by Visceral or not information we want to hear which in general turns the community against the game/developers.   Some people like to be louder than others."
BF_Hardline,38yz6e,Cramer02,7,Mon Jun 8 12:33:23 2015 UTC,It also doesn't help that the BF sub-reddit(s) always devolve into:  A) Should I buy this game? B) Should I buy premium?  Now throw Gun Bench into the mix:  C) What's/when's Gun Bench?  Then throw in a little anti-developer spite:  D) This game sucks/Visceral sucks/The UZI sucks   Finally a splash of wannabe Youtube stars  E) Sick MLG no scope/bald eagle/MPX video  And that is basically 90% of the sub reddit.
BF_Hardline,38yz6e,tyler2k,3,Mon Jun 8 15:06:04 2015 UTC,E is among the content you want. Just cause it's someone else showing off something cool in the game doesn't make it shitty
BF_Hardline,38yz6e,anubgek,12,Mon Jun 8 20:49:20 2015 UTC,BF:H brought a lot of the COD fanbase to Battlefield (because it's a very COD-like game). The COD fanbase consists mainly of teenage boys. This isn't your typical Battlefield community. This is a hybrid community dominated by new members to the franchise that migrated over from COD and other games.   I'm sure that the average age of this sub's subscribers is significantly lower than that of other Battlefield subreddits.
BF_Hardline,38yz6e,GabTej,3,Mon Jun 8 09:14:53 2015 UTC,"The COD subs are a lot more civil than this place, sharing vids, complementing one another on achievements, all around enjoying the games they have.  I think the negative comments in this sub just come from the salty veterans are pissed off that BFH isn't really like the other BF games."
BF_Hardline,38yz6e,Guild_me_bitches,3,Mon Jun 8 22:39:17 2015 UTC,But the majority of comments negative against the game are in fact from long time Battlefield players. Not the CoD players you reference.
BF_Hardline,38yz6e,BillyHoWCR,7,Mon Jun 8 12:42:45 2015 UTC,"Which is what I'm getting sick of.  I've been a long-time battlefield player, and the hipster attitude from ""seasoned veterans"" is more toxic than anything. The constant ""fuck this game it's shit"" comments and beating the dead horse of how BF4 is better just makes this place a joke.   If you don't like this game, unsubscribe. We're enjoying it."
BF_Hardline,38yz6e,Troy_Davis,2,Mon Jun 8 13:34:55 2015 UTC,"If you don't like this game, unsubscribe. We're enjoying it.   This would help a lot. So many of us actually enjoying the game simply dealing with numerous posts about why another gamer feels like he needs to tell us why he no longer will be playing it."
BF_Hardline,38yz6e,BillyHoWCR,6,Mon Jun 8 13:39:00 2015 UTC,"IMO mods should start removing shit posts like that along with the ""PC only has X players, last week it had X players OMGDEADAMIRTITE?!"" posts.   We all know how to check BFStats and most of us dont care what the current population is since we enjoy playing the game anyway."
BF_Hardline,38yz6e,Cramer02,2,Mon Jun 8 14:17:57 2015 UTC,"The mods?   Not a single mod has posted in here or contributed anything in the past few weeks, maybe even month or so."
BF_Hardline,38yz6e,Troy_Davis,2,Mon Jun 8 14:35:11 2015 UTC,"I know, you can tell by the quality of some of the posts that no moderation goes on, maybe we should vote in some new mods or something.  Ill admit i dunno how the mod system works so not sure who can grant it etc Sub creator possibly?"
BF_Hardline,38yz6e,Cramer02,1 point,Mon Jun 8 14:47:39 2015 UTC,"Exactly.  Someone makes a post asking for information on how to unlock/do a certain assignment, it's met with ""who cares this games dead""-esque comments out of nowhere. It's absolutely ridiculous."

BF_Hardline,38yz6e,slamdotswf,1 point,Mon Jun 8 17:27:45 2015 UTC,I cannot agree more with this.
BF_Hardline,38yz6e,eneMAXxx,2,Mon Jun 8 17:05:07 2015 UTC,"Exactly what I was going to say. The feeling of lurking this subreddit is exactly the same as the CoD subreddits.   A very stubborn circlejerk, where constructive criticism posts are downvoted and commented as ""go back to bf4 and stfu"".  In bf3/bf4 subreddits, there were some circlejerking moments, but subscribing to them is mostly a pleasure, interesting as fuck when it comes to weapon balance for example."
BF_Hardline,38yz6e,Hunter1207,2,Mon Jun 8 11:39:44 2015 UTC,"honestly all of the BF subreddits are pretty garbage, the second you say something Pro-PC you get downvoted, if you say something pro-DICE/EA you will get downvoted unless it is about CTE, etc etc  honestly these subreddits are actually so much like circlejerk subreddits its unreal"
BF_Hardline,38yz6e,Nikotiiniko,2,Mon Jun 8 17:31:19 2015 UTC,"I have no idea. It's the same in BF4 sub, which I unsubscribed from because fuck them. I don't think I have a single comment in either sub which was not downvoted. I have critiqued M16 and M416 for being unbalanced = downvoted. I have critiqued statspadding = downvoted. I have critiqued the avarege players inability to ptfo and use basic strategy = downvoted.   To me this tells the avarage person who votes here and in BF4 sub is a M16 user, statpadder and an avarage player with no tactical skill. They hate the fact that some people want to earn their kills and stuff without padding, without using the best guns in the game and has tactical skill.  The BF subs are easily the most toxic I've seen. The community overall is. In most games I would gladly talk and play with random people but I feel like that is absolutely impossible in BF."
BF_Hardline,38yz6e,bigmur72,2,Mon Jun 8 04:36:15 2015 UTC,I have critiqued the subreddit = downvoted.  Kidding.
BF_Hardline,38yz6e,TheComebackDude,0,Wed Jun 10 14:42:08 2015 UTC,"I agree with the bf4 sub... It's a toxic motherfucker. Cod subs are close to the top, xbox one subreddit is in top 2 of moet st toxic and ps4 subreddit takes the cake... Kids are on power on those subreddits and I'm a witness to a gaming culture melting and disappearing while a Facebook generation who think they got the all knowledge of the world is taking gaming over and making it ""**Facebooked""... Just as soon as I criticised a guy making a user voice on xbox site to implement ""tagging players online in recorded videos like on Facebook"", me saying that it's not needed in gaming community, fucking hell, got -100 downvotes on that comment before I even managed to finish writing it... Toxic little maggots I'm telling you."
BF_Hardline,38yz6e,Raz0rLight,-4,Mon Jun 8 12:02:00 2015 UTC,I critique balance for competitive play in both sub's and get bashed for it too. Apparently the knowledge that destructible cover can destroy map balance and survivability is blasphemy.

They also don't seem to realise that everyone has a different opinion. In my experience, a lot of people seem to think that their opinion and experience is the only one that matters so to hell with everyone else. I have no problem if you don't like the game, but why would you come on to a subreddit or forum just to bitch and moan. I just don't get it."

But the community has really changed with this title resulting in the game to be less enjoyable. My biggest peeve is the ""Veterans"" who refuse to try the game and just down vote everything this see. I too am a Vet and if you give a game a try by going into it with a neutral outlook towards it you will enjoy it, but a lot of vets went in with the sole purpose of looking for the flaws and ripping on it.  If you don't like the game, stop down voting and get off of this subreddit."

However, after giving it some real time I came to the conclusion that it sucked and was obviously a money grab. I would love to see the development costs on this one versus BF4 considering how vapid and shallow the content seems to be.   I believe other ""vets"" who are complaining have a valid reason to do so, though I agree they shouldn't say anything without even trying it."

BF_Hardline,38yz6e,Tezla55,0,Sat Jun 13 10:16:47 2015 UTC,"I feel that its because the community here is mostly split in how they view the game.

I also think that all the veteran BF players that would discuss Hardline without the toxicity have all moved back to BF4."

Yes, its not at the level of BF4, but its not terrible. All I'm saying is that in a subreddit FOR Battlefield Hardline, people constantly harken back to the older game far further in stage of life and have a fair bit of negativity, mostly undeserved."

Every game says not to do that, and I've been pretty good about remembering not to do that, but I done fucked up.    I'm just surprised that the entire save was corrupted. You'd think it would save incremental files such that only the most recent save in progress could be corrupted and it could at least roll back to the last good save.

You have 4 to 6 months to do this so you should be well with in the time frame.  They would get penalized money if there is a charge back so it is something that they will try to avoid. Issuing a refund is easier.  Getting a refund from your card company would take just a few minutes. You have to elaborate on why you are requesting it. Make mention that one of the items promised was never delivered (Gun Bench) and you want your money back. It would be HIGHLY unusual if they didn't grant you that chargeback request."
BF_Hardline,391y5z,brontesaur,1 point,Wed Jun 10 00:27:18 2015 UTC,Bad advice if you have any other games in your Origin account since they will take away all of your games if you do a chargeback.
BF_Hardline,391y5z,pavlik_enemy,1 point,Wed Jun 10 06:09:52 2015 UTC,I really don't understand that. There were two beta iterations so I guess everyone interested in the game had first-hand experience and were able to decide whether they like it or not.
BF_Hardline,391y5z,GregoryGoose,5,Wed Jun 10 00:57:04 2015 UTC,I don't think they even know what the gun bench is supposed to do. They just thought it sounded cool and assumed they figure it out later.
BF_Hardline,391y5z,RedTerror98,1 point,Tue Jun 9 08:18:21 2015 UTC,I really really want to know more about GunBench. In an ideal world I wish it was like the last Ghost Recon where you could explode the gun and select triggers and barrels etc.... I'm all for character appearance customization but I would drop butt loads of cash on weapon parts to know I have a truly one of a kind gun.
BF_Hardline,391y5z,RaTzo90,9,Tue Jun 9 19:54:41 2015 UTC,"They have abandoned the game because it has already accomplished all it ever can for them. They got the sales of idiots like myself who thought the Beta was good and revealed all the data they needed to make it amazing.   In order to make BF Hardline a game which continues to sell they would have to put a tone of effort and advertising into it. I don't think EA has the stomach for it. They have made their initial profit and now will limply ""support"" the game for the next number of months with DLCs that won't matter to anyone but a few console players.   EA knows Battlefront is coming..."
BF_Hardline,391y5z,Orphanlast,9,Mon Jun 8 20:56:05 2015 UTC,"They haven't abandoned the game. Patch notes have been released.   It'll recieve its second patch eventually.  If they can fix the ballance issues, the game will get the PC audience back... at least some of them since it's pretty much a DLC sold at the full price of a retail game.  If they can't ballance the game then they'll have to rely on the price dropping down to $20 (the price of a DLC).  When the price drops, it'll have a slightly larger audience.  I agree the game is dead on PC.   Personally I play on console and when presented from BF4 to BF:HL, I will always choose BF4 because it's a finished game getting extra tweaks and fixes.   But although Hardline was stable on release, it had (has) old netcode. So the game doesn't play well. TDM isn't enjoyable. Conquest feels neutered... and so that's two favorites that don't play well. And all the other game modes don't interest me. So there's not much content in the game. I have everything unlocked within a shot period of time and I'm rank 100+... in... a few... weeks...  Viceral has never made a multiplayer game, so their guns are ballanced the same as how you'd expect a campaign... so there's only one gun for each class and faction worth using.   The game's fucking boring. And poorly designed"

BF_Hardline,391y5z,OriginIsGreedy,3,Mon Jun 8 18:02:36 2015 UTC,"I know that they did not abandon the game, but it just feels like it.   For months after BF4 was released, it was a bombshell and none of the devs were talking. Even on twitter.   THAT was near-abandonment.  They gave an update a month or two after release and have release notes for their next update.   Trust me, whatever abandonment you feel right now, it's temporary.  The issue is that this is Viceral's first multiplayer game. Do they even know what they're doing when ""fixing"" the game?   And I really think Visceral should post news about the game (like what they are working on, etc) on reddit, that we get more involved into the game!   I just saw a thread that posted and discussed the patch notes.  Go to youtube and find the guy ""don't revive me bro"" (don't know if it's one word or not) He interviewed one of the Devs. It's like a 2 hour vid."

BF_Hardline,391y5z,TheBeardedMarxist,5,Mon Jun 8 18:33:08 2015 UTC,Exactly.   The only way they could get me to re-install Hardline at this point would be to refund my Premium subscription.

BF_Hardline,391y5z,Orphanlast,3,Mon Jun 8 21:36:19 2015 UTC,Who gives a fuck about boosting. It's an action game mode. You're missing out.
BF_Hardline,391y5z,BillyHoWCR,1 point,Tue Jun 9 03:04:00 2015 UTC,I've played it. But it got old after a while. There really does wind up being long durations of time where you're just driving around in circles getting free points.
BF_Hardline,391y5z,Orphanlast,3,Tue Jun 9 05:41:06 2015 UTC,Then do something different.  When I drive I actively hunt down other vehicles and enemy. The game does not force you to play a certain style. You choose to play the style you want.
BF_Hardline,391y5z,BillyHoWCR,1 point,Tue Jun 9 05:48:28 2015 UTC,yeah I guess I could plant C4 in the road tht whole match.
BF_Hardline,391y5z,Orphanlast,2,Tue Jun 9 13:15:47 2015 UTC,"Or jump off of buildings and kill vehicles with style via RPG/SMAW, hunt vehicles down and shoot out drivers and take their vehicles, take out those C4 road campers and snipers with style. So many options in Hotwire... with driving in circles the least challenging option that people should probably choose?"
BF_Hardline,391y5z,BillyHoWCR,2,Tue Jun 9 13:28:42 2015 UTC,"Before I delve in, these are my opinions, and as such, they're not objective. This is how I feel and think about HOTWIRE and HARDLINE as a whole.  See, the only way to save this game mode (Hotwire) is to introduce a conquest-hotwire hybrid .  Ok, so, thieves are stealing these cars and... what? They're... what? Driving them in circles?  This game mode has no direction. Not even in its own theme.  They needed mechanic shops and private garages built into each hotwire map (but they didn't).  This way the thieves can obtain owership of mechanic shops (chop shops) and deposite the vehicles into there for some quick cash. For driving the vehicle around town at high velocity, you should only get 2 points per second (not worth your while to drive in circles). Putting the vehicles into the chop shops would make C4 campers less of an issue.   The lock on stingers need to be removed from the game, the tracker dart shouldn't help you lock onto air vehicles. The Heli just needs to have its maneuverability rebalanced to move and handle more like a real chopper. And the only rockets should be RPGs. With this sort of rebalancing, it would take skill to shoot down the chopper, but the chopper would move in such a way that it wouldn't be as difficult to guess the chopper's trajectory as it currently is in HL and BF4.   Police could bust the chop shops (the conquest portion of the game), and  Repossessed vehicles (the hotwire part of the game).  This would put the ""objective"" into... you know... THE OBJECTIVE in the game mode. Because currently the objective is stupid, meaningless, absolutely boring, and subject to too much exploitation for boosters.  Currently, as it stands, this sounded like a cool game mode. It was fun... at first... but then the booster came and everyone unlocked all the rocket launchers and the C4. And it became a large scale TDM where you can sometimes drive a vehicle to get some points (when people aren't boosting). Which ultimately either makes the vehicles in this game mode range from ""drive around aimlessly"" to ""death trap""  I've given up on the game mode. I've given up on the game as well. I'm already rank 100+ from a few weeks of play which should mean I'm a badass... WHICH IT DOES..  on BF4. But not for Hardline because it's an easy goal to obtain. The guns are ballanced like shit. It has hacker mode when everyone was crying out ""NO! DON'T PUT THAT IN THE GAME!!"" And the in-game destruction has been reduced to small scale levolution events resembling COD:Ghosts.  And before a Hardline fan says: ""This is nothing like COD"" I have news for you. Thad Sasser is the ""Call Of Duty"" guy. That's why EA hired him. He's made the highest grossing CODs to date. THAT and the new game mode ""Bounty Hunter"" or some shit -- is ""Kill Confirmed"" with a new name. It's really hard to have the ""Hardline is a real Battlefield title and it's nothing like COD"" argument when these are the facts behind my opinion. And even if you don't agree, you can't expect anyone to change their position when these are the facts.  These are the following COD's Thad Sasser has worked on:  Call of Duty 3 (2006)       (Additional Design) Call of Duty 2: Big Red One (Collector's Edit... (2005)     (Design - Scripting) Call of Duty: United Offensive (2004)       (Level Design and Scripting)  Writers Call of Duty 2: Big Red One (2005)      (Design - Scripting) Call of Duty 2: Big Red One (Collector's Edit... (2005)     (Design - Scripting Team)  SOURCE: http://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId,29951/  I'm not buying the DLC. I'm not buying Premium.   I'll wait for an update that ballances the game, then I'll look for the game modes that aren't fundamentally broken by design, and then I'll play it again and CONSIDER Premium. But not before.  BUT EVEN THEN, this is not Battlefield."
BF_Hardline,391y5z,TheBeardedMarxist,-1,Wed Jun 10 03:43:25 2015 UTC,"What I read: I don't like Hotwire and think I can make a better version of the game.  But in truth, you are simply in err. Nothing wrong with Hotwire. You mention:   Ok, so, thieves are stealing these cars and... what? They're... what? Driving them in circles? This game mode has no direction. Not even in its own theme.   How is that any different then... we capture a conquest flag point and then what? Really... the concept is the same. The only difference is that Hotwire changes conquest and makes it mobile. Everything else is virtually the same.   You as a player simply need to stop the other team from keeping the capture points. No different then conquest. And while they hold more capture points then they are burning tickets and winning.  Now the COD garbage... is well... garbage. The only thing that differentiated COD from Battlefield was really the bullet drop and vehicles. And to say BFH is a COD clone is less then accurate.  And lastly... this is not Battlefield? Wow... haven't heard that before... wait... yes I have. Heard that with BF3. Everyone complaining that it didn't live up to what Battlefiled was supposed to be and that it ruined the concept of what Battlefield was. Hardly. Hardline is not supposed to be any iteration of BF3, BF4 or any other WAR title in the Battlefield franchise. Just as Star Wars Battlefront won't likely fit in the same cookie cutter idea of what current Battlefield players expect a Battlefield game to be... and yet they are anticipating it's arrival like no other game.   Don't buy the DLC, don't buy the Premium. We don't care. When you say you won't play it because of supposed fundamental game mode design issues that don't exist... well then you simply are living in your own non-objective level of gaming.   As for us.. we are enjoying the game. We love Hotwire (because we know how to have fun while playing it... unlike you?) and we care less if you are sharing the experience with us.   Have fun playing what ever other game you are going to be playing. We will still be here enjoying our game of BFH. Until you decide to enjoy the game and play it then how about you stop trolling our subreddit with your toxic bashing of it for your own non-objective reasons what ever they may be?"

Even ""Dirty Bomb"", a newly release Open-Beta game (F2P) on Steam has 9.148 Players right now.   That's part of the problem right there, you're comparing a F2P game with some buzz to a full fledged retail title, with arguably negative buzz. I'm not saying BFH should be F2P but if it was do you think only 3000 people would play it on PC?"
BF_Hardline,391y5z,nastylep,3,Mon Jun 8 17:55:41 2015 UTC,"I just meant that 3000 players are really a small number in comparison to other BF titles (and even to other, very unknown games) :("
BF_Hardline,391y5z,BillyHoWCR,-6,Mon Jun 8 18:00:42 2015 UTC,So play it then. Nobody is stopping PC players from playing. Everyone seems to say it is EA that is causing the issue...NO it is the players. Simple as that.   PC players making any excuse they can to blame everything but themselves. Hardline is fun... just ask the PS4 and Xbox One players enjoying it. Why then are PC players not enjoying it...? Because they prefer to talk trash about it then play a good game.
BF_Hardline,391y5z,nastylep,3,Tue Jun 9 05:57:04 2015 UTC,The reason hardline is failing is because PC players are out to get it?  Seriously?
BF_Hardline,391y5z,BillyHoWCR,-2,Tue Jun 9 14:00:08 2015 UTC,The reason hardline is failing is because PC players are out to get it?   Hardline is just fine on Xbox One and PS4... so the reason it is not populated on PC is truly likely because of the constant bashing of it by PC players.   Even those who say they want to play it (and have it) say sh@t about it all the time. How do you expect to get players to play on your system if you guys keep telling people it isn't worth it? (and then you turn around and complain because servers aren't populated? Seriously?)
BF_Hardline,391y5z,nastylep,3,Tue Jun 9 14:04:59 2015 UTC,"Hardline is just fine on Xbox One and PS4   I guess we'll have to agree to disagree here. I have it on Xbox one and I think it's complete shit.    How do you expect to get players to play on your system if you guys keep telling people it isn't worth it? (and then you turn around and complain because servers aren't populated? Seriously?)   A grass roots, ""word of mouth"" campaign will not save this game at this point in its development cycle.   PC players aren't going to advocate a game they think is bad - especially when they feel taken advantage of by the rushed development, non-existent premium benefits, and almost non existent upkeep."
BF_Hardline,391y5z,BillyHoWCR,-2,Tue Jun 9 14:09:27 2015 UTC,"I guess we'll have to agree to disagree here. I have it on Xbox one and I think it's complete shit.   And yet the community on Xbox One and PS4 are doing rather descent count. And your opinion of it isn't the point.   A grass roots, ""word of mouth"" campaign will not save this game at this point in its development cycle.   Am not talking about rejuvenating the game. Simply trying to allow the PC players to understand why other PC players are not purchasing it.   PC players aren't going to advocate a game they think is bad   And yet the major issue of complaints from PC players is in fact simply the population. With players saying they want to play the game but simply can't find populated servers. And then same players spouting out that EA/Visceral are not doing enough to get players into the game, while turning around and bad mouthing it for really petty reasons.   BF4 had a huge multi month release issue with that title and it still got the benefit of the doubt. Even though many issues had been considered game breaking to some. To the point EA had to stop all other game production just to fix BF4.  And yet BFH had one of the best releases ever seen. With little to any issues and was considered one of the most non-glitch related releases in some time.   And what happens...? People complain about balance, K-10 OP, M16 OP... and why isn't this class like this, or that class like it was before. So much petty garbage it was ridicules. (and still is)   Even 2 months later... having seen 1 Patch already... the game is leaps and bounds more playable then BF4 ever was in the same time period. And all people complain about... why hasn't the 2nd patch came out yet? Why are we being forsaken? I mean come on already... the community is really a bunch of fuck wads. Play the damn game. If you don't like it then play something else. If you do like it and wonder why others aren't buying it then maybe stop bad mouthing it if you really do like playing it?  Obviously YOU don't like it on Xbox One. But I really am thinking you are a minority and your opinion of it really doesn't effect the PC players as much. As we all know they are the Master Race and only listen to other PC players when it comes to advice. ;)"
BF_Hardline,391y5z,nastylep,3,Tue Jun 9 14:39:31 2015 UTC,"And yet the major issue of complaints from PC players is in fact simply the population.   Disagree again here, there are plenty of legitimate complaints, among which, the horrendous weapon balancing - which is game breaking for some - which you attempted to trivialize below. Shit driving physics, broken reputation track, lack of maps & guns in general, no premium content whatsoever to date, unrewarding/shallow unlock system, the list goes on and on.   BF4 had a huge multi month release issue with that title and it still got the benefit of the doubt.   BF4 was a great game at its core with faulty infrastructure supporting it.  Hardline was a shit game with good infrastructure.  It was night and day.    People complain about balance, K-10 OP, M16 OP... and why isn't this class like this, or that class like it was before. So much petty garbage it was ridicules. (and still is)   Lol... cmon.    Obviously YOU don't like it on Xbox One.

As we all know they are the Master Race and only listen to other PC players when it comes to advice. ;)   I have a hard time believing I'm in the minority considering the rapidly declining player base and the fact that they've slashed the price of a major budget, AAA title by 33% within 2 months of release.   We'll see how long it survives once a challenger emerges within the next couple months."

But does give me the chance to question you on something that everyone has been harping on of late. Why if you hate the game so  much are you in a subreddit created for gamers that like it? This isn't a trolling subreddit where we expect dissension and bad mouthing. And yet here you and so many others are... why? Is it because you are nasty? ha
BF_Hardline,391y5z,BionicSammich,3,Tue Jun 9 14:49:47 2015 UTC,"I pop in about once a week when I have downtime. I still play hardline every now and again to get my FPS fix because Xbox has no viable alternatives, and as I've stated in previous posts, this game is very accessible like CoD - you can turn this game on and play by yourself for 20 minutes without missing anything (the exact opposite of BF4 which was involved, and you needed a squad that could communicate to get the fullest) None of my friends bother anymore, so I very rarely find myself playing it longer than an hour, though. I'll be done with this game once battlefront comes out almost certainly."
BF_Hardline,391y5z,Epikz1,4,Tue Jun 9 14:55:25 2015 UTC,Yeah a F2P game with some buzz... compared to a freaking Battlefield game with the might of EA advertising behind it.   That a beta has more players than Hardline tells the story.... much better than comparing it go a game that has fully matured like BF4.   Hardline = a stable but epic fail.

I prefer to be able to choose between diffrent platfrom supporters (Steam/Origin/Desura/etc) without having to worry about being locked to 1.  I just prefer to being able to change the parts i wanna change from time to time instead of having to buy a whole new overpriced console with dumbed down grapics in the games.   I prefer to not having to wait 2 week's for my games to be updated.  I prefer to being able to use mods in games.  I prefer to being able to choose if i wanna play games in 720p/1080p/2k/4k instead of being locked to 720p Xbone and 900p Ps4.  You have no clue at all about what you are talking about.

BF_Hardline,38z2na,megaroof,2,Mon Jun 8 13:52:21 2015 UTC,"I've got a pretty decent trigger-finger aswell, so the G17 works wonders. Gonna try get the Gold Plated camo on it later."

BF_Hardline,38xuii,DANNYonPC,5,Sun Jun 7 19:40:37 2015 UTC,"We're working on bringing you faster tick rate servers. Our engineers have implemented changes and they've been successfully tested in the CTE for BF4. We hope this will be the first thing tested in the BFH CTE, and pushed into the full game once we know it's effective and working right. These plus some other fixes could greatly improve the experience for players who have had issues with latency or connection.    This is huge!"

BF_Hardline,38xuii,chrispytoast,0,Mon Jun 8 16:03:00 2015 UTC,Suiciding while capturing a car will rack up points for the rest of the game as if the player was still in the car (even while dead/not playing objective).

BF_Hardline,38xuii,crawlerz2468,1 point,Mon Jun 8 14:52:20 2015 UTC,"for the same movement of the mouse (on the mousepad) you will get the same movement, regardless of scope, of monitor pixelwise. this doesn't mean ingame turn angle, because each scope has a different FOV. this means actual screen pixel amount.   check it like this. put a ruler up to the monitor with 0 at the center. 0.5"" mouse movement should result in 3"" on the ruler regardless of scope. (I pulled these numbers out of my ass, but the theory holds.)  it helps develop a muscle memory as your hand will expect a certain movement of the mouse in a while."
BF_Hardline,38xuii,JasonKesler,0,Mon Jun 8 15:43:56 2015 UTC,Its still very little in comparison to something like BF4's spring patch which had thousands of changes.
BF_Hardline,38xuii,JasonKesler,4,Sun Jun 7 23:27:31 2015 UTC,How long was the springpatch in development?
BF_Hardline,38xuii,CrossBones3129,1 point,Sun Jun 7 23:34:25 2015 UTC,"Longer than this, but don't you remember one of the DICE LA devs saying they had a tool that they used to increase recoil for a certain subset of guns by a certain percentage to speed it up? That must not have taken that long, especially since they kinda just went in and made the changes without testing them."
BF_Hardline,38yngb,RangerUK,1 point,Sun Jun 7 23:26:10 2015 UTC,Woho CQL on Growhouse? Never played that. BTW with that brightness settings you are in some serious advantage to others.
BF_Hardline,38yngb,nightbass,1 point,Mon Jun 8 20:14:20 2015 UTC,YES I saw the setup on a YouTube video... It makes it so much easier to see what's going on in the dark maps. I accept that it makes the rest of the game seem a bit poor (most of the graphics settings have been turned right down) for performance and to make it easy to see enemies.
BF_Hardline,390sbk,BucklingOne,3,Mon Jun 8 12:25:03 2015 UTC,"Usually the cops get to this spot first, and a Molotov clears them out pretty quickly."

BF_Hardline,390sbk,BillyHoWCR,0,Mon Jun 8 16:27:37 2015 UTC,I don't even consider this a glitch. Simply an area that is considered still inbound but you have to travel out of bounds to get to it.
BF_Hardline,390sbk,PoliticoG305,1 point,Mon Jun 8 12:40:31 2015 UTC,That's a fair point.

BF_Hardline,390sbk,BillyHoWCR,-4,Mon Jun 8 13:50:09 2015 UTC,"This is one of the better illustrations for the gripes I have with the game. This sort of thing show a lack of attention to detail that, along with any meaningful balance or support, make BFH feel like an undergraduate thesis project that got picked up and sold by EA as opposed to a real AAA title."
BF_Hardline,390sbk,Troy_Davis,2,Mon Jun 8 16:23:59 2015 UTC,"It's a shame you think that way. Every game has some kind of glitches like these, even Battlefield 4 and Battlefield 3 still have out of map glitches and spots."
BF_Hardline,390sbk,BillyHoWCR,-1,Mon Jun 8 16:28:54 2015 UTC,"Those games also have several times the content in terms of maps, guns, etc. It's the difference between finding an error in a ten question quiz and the same error in a dissertation."

And don't ask people what guns/attachments to use - play with them. See what you like. It's a game after all, it's about having fun."
BF_Hardline,38wrb4,DarthPneumono,2,Sun Jun 7 16:22:20 2015 UTC,"Start with operator and use the akm its cheap, hits hard, and if you learn to handle the recoil on that beast you can easily handle any gun in the game."
BF_Hardline,38wrb4,doomguy26,1 point,Tue Jun 9 13:40:07 2015 UTC,"Operator class is great because you can heal yourself. Doesn't hurt that they have some great guns available.  Are you new to BF in general? Find people to play with that run as a squad, communicate, and Play the Objective (PTO, PTFO). You'll have more fun, die less often and learn a lot about the game. There's nothing worse than getting in a squad with two camping snipers and fool who runs around like a lost dog.  If your squad leader isn't giving you objectives use the ""Request Objective"" dialog. If they still don't give you one you become the squad leader. It's a great way to rack up points and occasionally it gets your squad working in the same goal."

BF_Hardline,38yps0,jtboyd14,0,Mon Jun 8 14:50:20 2015 UTC,Pointing them at the money pile on blood money and the area around. But others on my team would place their cameras in the same spot and we'd cancel each other out.
BF_Hardline,38yps0,BillyHoWCR,-2,Mon Jun 8 14:54:04 2015 UTC,So don't do that then. If you know you are conflicting with other cameras then place in another location. It isn't like there are limited areas to place them.   And TDM will get you far more camera coins in my experience.
BF_Hardline,38yps0,A_McKinney,3,Mon Jun 8 15:04:17 2015 UTC,"I got all mine in a couple hours good tip is to do it on hardcore where no one spots and there is no commander, so they can't steal your intel assists, go on TDM on the block or dust bowl then put them on roof tops you should get about 3 per game, hope this helps."
BF_Hardline,38yps0,cutlerf,2,Mon Jun 8 01:08:30 2015 UTC,"They are fixing them in the next patch. I think it launches the 15th or 16th.    The Deployable Camera has seen massive improvements to its functionality. Now camera spots take priority over active or passive spotting, making them much more reliable. In addition, each camera shares a larger pool of raycasts, improving the number of targets they can spot while not impacting performance negatively."

Just plop them around the main site in the beginning of the match and then either your or their base once the middle dies down. Just place them regularly based on where they spawn."
BF_Hardline,38yps0,TheNation55,0,Sun Jun 7 23:59:33 2015 UTC,"Been trying blood money, but people will place their cameras right next to mine and it seems to cancel mine or both of ours out. Not sure if people are doing it just to be annoying or if they don't realize."
BF_Hardline,38yps0,TheNation55,-3,Mon Jun 8 14:57:08 2015 UTC,"How are people still struggling with this? I sat down one night and got all of them in 3 TDM matches on RipTide, before any patches. Put them up in the palm trees, obviously facing opposite directions. Then go die so you can go put up your third. Then just play a different class for the rest of the match.... it's not even remotely difficult..."

How are u trying to join his squad: through the squad join before you join a game or are u trying to join a squad he's in mid game? Also if it's mid game did he already have a squad in place and search with squad join? (If he did the squad is locked in and u are locked out)

Use a Reputation Boost and try to balance the teams, if both teams have two cars, don't take the fifth, the match will last longer. If you have a 100% boost you can usually do it twice per round, though you have to quit and rejoin the server (add it to as a favourite).  If someone is taking the piss and blowing everyone up, find another server.  Otherwise it's just a waste of time."

BF_Hardline,38oh0q,RAHatch,6,Fri Jun 5 19:22:01 2015 UTC,OPen all your filters up sir- When you get it right you should find 5-10 active servers playing mostly block and dust- Sadly that's it for PC. The game is very unbalanced and is not being fixed and the PC community already moved on- The game has some fun points it is sad it was left to die this way- it's an embarrasment to the franchise.

BF_Hardline,38oh0q,HiroProtagonist1,1 point,Fri Jun 5 18:11:32 2015 UTC,I have no problems with that. I didn't refer to BF4 either. I simply refuse to buy any other BF-named products when they rip me off on Hardline. I honestly thought they would patch stuff and make the game playable. Instead they have taken people's money and ran for it. It's clear as day Hardline is just a cash cow game. And that alone for me is enough to never touch another BF game. Now each to their own. Some people are probably less stubborn than me and won't take it that far.

BF_Hardline,38oh0q,dungeonmstr,10,Sat Jun 6 00:14:45 2015 UTC,The spring patch also probably had something to do with it. Fixes + free content is a good combination to bring people back. Two things HL is severely lacking; it's like they don't even want people to fucking play it.
BF_Hardline,38oh0q,Tbogardus,4,Fri Jun 5 15:51:35 2015 UTC,Seriously. Hardline should have been a $30 expansion off of bf4. The game was definitely not worth 60. It was also very repetitive. I played the beta pretty heavily I believe I hit rank 50 there was really nothing special. I'm actually upset I played 80+ levels of the game when released. BF4 for the win.
BF_Hardline,38oh0q,ColossalExodus,7,Fri Jun 5 17:26:39 2015 UTC,"I mean, if you played so much of the beta, then you knew what you were getting, no sympathy from me."
BF_Hardline,38oh0q,cutlerf,3,Fri Jun 5 17:46:05 2015 UTC,"The issue is that nothing was changed from the beta to the retail game. Also, almost all FPS games now a days need balancing after the retail version comes out even if they listen to feedback from the beta. Besides the changes to the K10 and the couch not much has been balanced/fixed. This game has so much potential but EA and/or Visceral is letting it die. Some tweaks, like gun balancing for example, do take a while to get right, but come on how long does it take to change the rep system. I think people had a lot of hope after BF4 went from not even loading to a great game. No offense, but if you came from COD you might be used to weak support from devs. For a BF title this game seems to be like the last kid the parents gave up on."

DICE fucked up in the launch, but I respect them so much for all they did to win players back."

BF_Hardline,38ofun,ACovers,1 point,Fri Jun 5 15:32:32 2015 UTC,"I wish I knew where EA stood on this. The first DLC will be a good sign of what's going on with the playerbase. If PC players don't start showing up / coming back, perhaps re-thinking the release strategy would be beneficial. Personally, I would rather have a little bit of new content every week than wait months for each DLC. Sometimes radical changes must be made to avoid failure - and it would be somewhat brazen to do that, but a fun and constantly updating CTE (or PC base game) could perhaps revive the PC population. At any rate, it would certainly be a step in the right direction for more gamer-centric development / publication. I know Visceral is working hard and their hands are probably tied by EA, but let's hope some of the suits allow for rethinking of content releases."

BF_Hardline,38mdzd,fletch420man,4,Fri Jun 19 05:44:08 2015 UTC,"The guns should be more about trade-offs. As of now, the heavy bolt action snipers are pure shit compared to the kidproof version (scout elite). There's no advantage in using it over the scout, because it's worse in nearly EVERY way possible. same goes for alot of the weapons across all the classes. Now i dont really care if some guns are a bit worse, but the fact that there are only a few guns to choose from makes it very boring."
BF_Hardline,38mdzd,penguingod26,4,Fri Jun 5 09:56:01 2015 UTC,The only advantage I see for the other bolt actions is the possibility to do a 1 shot kill to the chest at close range. That's really not worth it at all though since the professional carries the best close range sidearms in the game. Kind of silly to run around with a bolt action when you've got the Tec-9 as a backup.

BF_Hardline,38nck7,elfez,2,Fri Jun 5 17:14:15 2015 UTC,"Sure, but my point isn't what I can get it for, but that by lowering the price drastically in the Origin shop EA would show that they are serious about trying trying to salvage the current stagnation on PC.

Plus, you never addressed the fact that your k/d is the result of camping with rpgs and breaching charges on hotwire so I'll assume you're tacitly conceding this. I'd like to play you on some crosshair if you'd like. Add me if you feel up to it.   Edit - You do realize that your stats still don't back this up. You have 74 flag defends and 64 flag caps. To be really picky if you take away your ""Gadget"" (RPGs) kills and your breaching charges kills which add up to 8698 of your 11231 kills, the gun stats show a much different picture. They'd look a little more like 3328 kills and 2666 deaths which would be a ""terrible"" 1.24 k/d. I'm not sure what delusional world you live in, but it's not reality"

""JUST DON'T FORGET TO CHECK... ...SABOTAGE."" ~ the word 'FOR' was left off. The first panel should have had the Hotwire Car a little more prominent in the background.  ""THE END"" text box fell outside the comic panel. Not consistent with opening text box which was seated into the panel.    Positive feedback:   comic dot printing effect was done well. Lettering was also on point. Use of a different speech connector width on the bubble in second panel was well done to help give non-character present perspective of it. (intentional or not) Exclamation bubble was also on point. Character perspective was well done on the entire page.  Use of the location with brick pattern helped in making the  second panel more then just an object id and added a good contrast for the image.    All small positives and negatives but felt I would add my 3 cents worth in hopes of seeing a few more in a series?"

BF_Hardline,38fdhg,fletch420man,4,Wed Jun 3 23:57:53 2015 UTC,Just tried this myself and I was able to get a refund without much hassle. Thanks for the suggestion!  Very disappointed with the lower player count for this game. I've enjoyed it very much but it's pretty well dead on PC.
BF_Hardline,38fdhg,Ireland914,10,Thu Jun 4 00:41:12 2015 UTC,"This is pretty stupid, you pleaded customer support to refund you, when the details page specifically states ""look forward to"" -- meaning more information of when it's coming and what it's going to do will drop soon. The first wave of DLC hasn't even arrived yet, so I'm not exactly sure how they ""cheated"" you when you willingly gave money towards all expansion packs as a pre-purchase mixed in with those events or whatever.  The developers play in public lobbies on all platforms every day, so they understand the woes of the low player count on PC, I have no idea what they're planning to fix these issues, but hopefully CTE opening up for everyone will give it that boost it needs."
BF_Hardline,38fdhg,NvaderGir,1 point,Thu Jun 4 00:09:23 2015 UTC,"I think the biggest issue and why people are so desperate for their money back is because of the low player counts. This is something that would've been pretty hard to predict from the get-go. Many nights I go on I can't even find more than a handful of servers running blood money or heist. Break that number down even lower to those who actually bought premium/the DLC. The DLC modes in BF4 (carrier assault, chain linked, air superiority, CTF) most of the time have no one playing them, and that's with a much larger player count. So it's understandable why people would be afraid that they won't even be able to get their $50 worth from premium. I'm willing to stick it out and try out the new content, but I know that if I don't try it shortly after the DLC drops, those new modes and maps probably won't be played weeks or months down the road."
BF_Hardline,38fdhg,TehDarkArchon,0,Thu Jun 4 16:10:11 2015 UTC,"Not that hard to predict for me, and I dont mean this as some sort of humble brag, believe me.

But maybe I just get lucky with the games that I choose to buy. I bought bf4 and that was garbage, but it got fixed and now its full of players."
BF_Hardline,38fdhg,colonelniko,-9,Fri Jun 5 16:16:49 2015 UTC,The developers play in public lobbies on all platforms every day   Never seen a single developer on Xbox 360 ever. Your idea they play on every platform every day is ridicules.
BF_Hardline,38fdhg,BillyHoWCR,0,Thu Jun 4 04:16:18 2015 UTC,Do you know the gamertag of every dev? I doubt it so it's entirely possibly that they do in fact play on every system
BF_Hardline,38fdhg,dirtymuffins23,-4,Thu Jun 4 12:19:31 2015 UTC,Never seen a single Dev patch. And yes... I know most every Dev on Dev tracker.
BF_Hardline,38fdhg,BillyHoWCR,2,Thu Jun 4 13:02:53 2015 UTC,Just cause they don't rock a patch doesnt mean they're not a dev and you said most which means you don't know all. it's possible that the ones not using a dev patch just want to game without the recognition that they're a dev. I'm betting the ones that do use the dev patch get countless amounts of messages about anything and everything related to the game. I wouldn't want all that if I just want to game so I too wouldn't use a dev patch. Shit I play on ps4 and haven't seen a dev patch so you're theory there is flawed
BF_Hardline,38fdhg,dirtymuffins23,-4,Thu Jun 4 13:15:30 2015 UTC,"Unless it has changed... Devs are required to be wearing the Viral patches in matches. And we have a Visceral Stalker list... though it isn't shared publicly due to the issues Devs had previously on BF3 being hunted.      Shit I play on ps4 and haven't seen a dev patch so you're theory there is flawed   Your population on PS4 is much larger. Population on PS3, Xbox 360 and PC is so small that we basically know every single other player that ever plays."

BF_Hardline,38fdhg,dirtymuffins23,-3,Thu Jun 4 13:50:16 2015 UTC,Just going off previous criteria mentioned from Devs while playing BF3 long ago.   As mentioned already... unless things have changed it should still be the same.  Regardless... we have a list of Devs and their user names. Unless they have multiple accounts that aren't shared then they are known and tracked.   And where is your so called proof that they play on ALL platforms?
BF_Hardline,38fdhg,BillyHoWCR,-4,Thu Jun 4 14:03:13 2015 UTC,"Exacty...I am pretty sure most of you bought premium before yall knew about the extra features.So why complain when you get all your DLC's 2 weeks before non-premium members,and you still get the features when they're finally release.Maybe next time you will wait before just throwing your cash out there.I didn't buy premium for BF4,cause I didn't see why I needed it.I ain't buying premium for Hardline cause I don't care about the features nor the 2 weeks.

I knew from the beginning the game was going to fail especially when it took an entire month for a measly patch that did nothing. Nothing like seeing $120 go down the drain. Ever since I have stopped pre-ordering games and will not get another battlefield game with premium from the onset. I will just wait to see how the game is after a week its out.
BF_Hardline,38fdhg,falcon2081,2,Thu Jun 4 04:12:43 2015 UTC,I purchased the version that has premium built in so I think I am just screwed. Such a bad mistake.

Premium seems to pretty clearly be for future release benefits. The game hasn't been out long, and while it's odd how few people are on PC, it seems premature to be calling anything a failure. With the costs of consoles going down, and the large Hardline user base on consoles, if anything it seems clear that people are gravitating to playing consoles over PC. I understand the frustration, but it's hardly the fault of Visceral/ea. would you reall feel better if the GUN BENCH of all things was available?"

BF_Hardline,38j129,BillyHoWCR,1 point,Thu Jun 4 15:37:18 2015 UTC,That is a good point. As when I spawn into a vehicle it will change to my color and loadout.

BF_Hardline,38j129,crappyfisherman,2,Thu Jun 4 17:10:57 2015 UTC,"OK. So what happens is that cars can be set only once, as opposed to BF4 where they are set for each driver.  If you spawn on a vehicle that no one has been in, it will become yours with your paint and your loadout.  If someone else has been in it, it will retain their loadout. Many people will spawn on a car, grab the trunk weapon, and leave in another car - leaving a car you can spawn in with their loadout and a missing weapon."

If I'm not MVP on a 64 man then I'm doing something wrong or someone's running an extreme boost.  I can understand why people say you're dodgy, because you look dodgy. It just be your playstyle is unusual but it doesn't feel right.   There are 3 sources of information in the game; visual, auditory and the minimap. Multiple times you appeared to know the location of an enemy before you had any indication on any of these 3 sources, past or present. You also often appeared to know the location where the enemy wasn't, and so made unusual paths through locations that others would certainly have checked at least one of the 6 possible locations you could be shot from. Instead you'd run through a vulnerable position and not look at anything but where the next enemy was even when you couldn't know they were there.  Then there are the times where you appear to run directly at an unseen enemy and then have to change course because there is a wall between you two or they're in a different room. But you're running directly at them non the less. I can't understand why or how a player would do this without any information on that enemy, nor why you then continue to track a course to that enemy without knowing they're there. It just doesn't make sense.  tldr; even if you're not dodgy, you look it and I would have banned you off my server if I had one."
BF_Hardline,38kcbe,Mayor_S,0,Fri Jun 5 02:38:42 2015 UTC,"I appreciate you taking the time to watch and write this.  I had to rewatch the gameplay to see why i was running in a certain direction. 90% of the kills are players popping up on the minimap, some for just a brief moment, but enough for me to run after them.  This is how I play pretty much everytime, i rely pretty much solely on the minimap. Sometimes, it works out great, like in this video. Other times, I see someone spotted, run after them, and get shot in the back because I don't check corners etc.   You also often appeared to know the location where the enemy wasn't   This is just luck on my part. Like I said, this time it worked out great, but you are not seeing the other games where I get so frustrated at myself because I run after a dorito on the minimap and forget to check corners and get killed.  I think my stats reflect this pretty well too. I have a 2KPM in both BFH and BF4 which is pretty high, but my K/D is only around 2.4. I get a lot of kills pretty much every game, but I also often die more than most people in a server for this exact reason.   tldr; even if you're not dodgy, you look it and I would have banned you off my server if I had one.   That's exactly the mentality of players/admins that gets me frustrated. There is apparently no way for me to prove my innocence because once a person has decided on that you are cheating, you can't really argue your way out off it."

BF_Hardline,38fvf1,fededm97,5,Wed Jun 3 23:04:27 2015 UTC,"Even though I'm still pretty bad at the game I think I can explain it a little bit:   There are 4 classes in total, the Operator is the assault rifle class with who can heal and revive others, the mechanic is the SMG class with emphasis on gadgets and short range combat, the enforce either uses shotguns or heavy rifles and they drop ammo, and the professional is the sniper class.  Game mode wise, Conquest is Domination in COD, Blood Money is like CTF but with hundreds of flags, Hotwire is Conquest with the capture point being moving vehicles, Heist is when the criminal have to break in to a location and steal an objective then escape.   Q is spotting, which means if you press Q while enemy is on screen it will mark him on the minimap as well as show an orange mark above his head for a couple of seconds. Z is to go prone, X is to crouch, and holding Shift makes you sprint. F is melee and G is your grenade. 1-5 cycles though your weapons and gadgets.   Think that covers the basics."

Focus on team-work within your squad.  If you get the message that you're the last member alive in your squad, don't rush around like a headless chicken. Wait for someone to spawn on you. Always play the objective, never go for kills over obj. K/D is not really that important. Yes it helps the team and your own score, but I would rather have a negative K/D and capture the obj. in heist for example.   Try and stick to some of these and you'll be just fine, and when you sink your teeth in to the game you will find that it is far more diverse and fun than COD, at least in my opinion."
BF_Hardline,38fvf1,CheapSkate23,2,Thu Jun 4 15:28:37 2015 UTC,"The Basics: Pick the assault class (medic with AR) and run around to find and kill people that don't have a green or blue tag over their head (they should only have a red name and triangle). Works with any mode. Maybe try the campaign to gain an understanding of the controls.    Intermediate:    Classes, game modes and buttons are like /u/Typical_Ratheist/ described.    Vehicles are important for all BF games, but for BFH, since you are a new player, skip driving the armored vehicles or helicoptors for now; you will hurt your team more than help it by trying to drive those vehicles. stick to transport cars and bikes to get from one place to another quickly.  To really help your team win the game (like 5 times more than just playing for kills), PTFO or PLAY THE FUCKING OBJECTIVE (not mad at you, that's actually what PTFO stands for).    Advanced: Learn the maps for the game modes that you like. Also, gain experience with a specific weapon for each team; you will begin to understand what that gun can and cannot do, and how it will behave in the recoil and spread departments.    Team mates that have green nametags are a part of your squad, see IGN. Really, they do have a decent amount of info over there about how to play too. Squads are not as important to you in this game as they should be (IMHO) but they are useful as spawn points when you die and you will get more points for helping your squadmates do things.   Find or make friends that can mentor you in the art of playing BF. BF is more fun when you do well with friends in the same squad as you.   Also, watch some Levelcap or Matimi0. They are not always liked (generally by the more technical people, or the people that have played since BF2 or earlier), but they do help with the fundamentals of playing BF games since BF3."

BF_Hardline,38fvf1,BillyHoWCR,1 point,Thu Jun 4 01:32:01 2015 UTC,Seeing you played COD I would recommend you start out with TDM just to get used to the classes and how weapons work against infantry. (spawns will be awkward at first but just remember you are rarely safe as people can spawn all around you... so try staying with your squad or teammates)  Classes basically are just segregated by weapons available and certain class specific gadgets. Starting out most people find 'Mechanic' to be the better learning class. Especially since you can quickly earn enough to get 'Armored Insert' and 'Satellite Phone' gadgets.   Once you get used to TDM then I would recommend Hotwire. As it slowly gets you into vehicle use without being a true detriment to the team by not being able to use vehicles well yet.  Once you get the basics down on vehicle driving then I would recommend Conquest. Follow your squad around and try and follow what they are attempting to do. Conquest is basically king of the hill where you are trying to capture a flag point and then keeping it.   After that you can move onto Bloodmoney and other game modes to enrich your Battlefield experience.   Good luck.
BF_Hardline,38fvf1,BarryMcCackiner,1 point,Thu Jun 4 05:03:29 2015 UTC,"I second this suggestion.  Playing TDM in the beginning is a great way to figure out what class you like to play and what guns you want to use.  Just concentrate on moving around the map a little slower than COD and be a little more tactical in mind, think almost like a swat team member clearing a house.  Once you get a hang of the interface and of your weapons and gadgets then move on to other game modes and try to play the objectives.  Objective based gameplay though, in my opinion, is what really sets Battlefield apart.  I love a good blood money or hotwire game.  There is still plenty of killing but also good times to be had trying to get your team to win the objective."

I honestly don't know if this will work but it's worth trying I guess, however I imagine it would probably look worse.  Edit: I actually just went and tested this and got much better performance using DoFMethod_Gaussian.  Edit 2; The Re-Editening: If you play with Post Process Quality on High or Ultra it will use DoFMethod_Sprite. Low and Medium use DoFMethod_Gaussian (same for blur method). I don't know what else is effected by this setting so if you want to leave it at High/Ultra but get better performance in Gas you can try:  PostProcess.DoFMethod DoFMethod_Gaussian   IMO it also makes it considerably easier to see while gassed too."

Also then I would more often get interrogation than camera coin.      I don't know what is going on behind but it seems sometimes intel assists count towards camera coin but more often towards interrogation."
BF_Hardline,38f2b7,nightbass,1 point,Thu Jun 4 11:30:07 2015 UTC,"so far im only having your results, yet everyone else gets coins.  what are we missing?"
BF_Hardline,38f2b7,ThatFedexGuy,2,Thu Jun 4 15:45:07 2015 UTC,"I had it work for me once. I put a camera down (put it far away from other people's cameras) and as soon as I got my intel assist, I tazed someone. I also didn't die between getting the intel assist and the taze, so that may have helped, but I'm not sure."
BF_Hardline,38f2b7,RangerUK,2,Fri Jun 5 12:18:30 2015 UTC,"If someone kills an enemy you've lit up because of an interrogation, you get an intel assist. If your camera lights up an enemy and they are killed while lit up, you get an Intel assist.   10 Intel assists = 1 camera coin.   If you're trying to get camera coins for the synducat assignment, you need to get 10 Intel assists from the cameras, not from interrogations, for the camera coin to be valid. If someone on your team ""spots"" the enemy then you don't get the intel assist.  The problem I found was that my team were spotting the enemies, which overwrites your intel and so I didn't get the intel assist."
BF_Hardline,38f2b7,TakeSe7en,2,Sat Jun 6 08:56:47 2015 UTC,"When I tried it it only ever worked once, and I coudln't figured out why. I got a spot with a camera first in each game.  In the end I starting putting my cameras high on walls and ceilings in high traffic (objective) and spawn point (TDM) areas and racked them up quickly. I was kicking myself for not figuring it out sooner, so that's my tip to you- put them on trees and lamposts facing towards traffic areas."

The amount of players still playing the game has decreased significantly - in comparison to BF4 which is over 2 years old which is still holding higher figures. Looking at the numbers if PS4 peaked at 72,000 players at launch and is now just over 20K... Shows that there will not be a sustainable player base available for the game as 60% of the players have left within months of launch. Thats what I meant with my comment that it will die out within a year. Dont get me wrong I love the game, but it will not survive long term and does/will not have the longetevity that BF4 has."

I said I didn't have it but they enjoy. I bought it right away and surprised them.  I had tons of fun and enjoyed heist and Hotwire. Felt like battlefield but not as much if that makes any sense.  I like BF4 better without a doubt but hardline is very enjoyable.   If you're on the consoles and have friends to play with I'd say it's worth a buy.

Progression and Achievements aren't any fun because half the remaining playerbase is just exploiting the crap out of it to boost through what should be fun gameplay achievements.    There has been ONE lackluster patch so far, the first DLC and Patch #2 is 10 days away (+2 weeks for none premium) and we don't even know yet if that will help at all or be any good.    At the very least wait until the DLC is out and listen to what people have to say about it.

BF_Hardline,38aaod,GregoryGoose,2,Tue Jun 2 23:50:13 2015 UTC,"There's been some news, mostly vague references to trying to get things to work in the game that they want to have as features for gun bench, they won't give any specifics because if their ideas don't pan out then they don't want people crying ""you promised X feature"".  I think it was originally conceived as a way to just look at your weapons with the textures on them up close and rotate them around to look at them at different angles, people projected their imagination into assuming that you could do adjustments to weapons like the way a real gun bench works.    If you can customize the color and shape of your ""red dot"" I'll be amazed."
BF_Hardline,38aaod,EliteDangerous,0,Wed Jun 3 09:52:54 2015 UTC,"Yea, pretty much this  If something is in development and you promise rainbows but can't deliver people get angry."
BF_Hardline,38aaod,DANNYonPC,3,Wed Jun 3 14:43:35 2015 UTC,"It is a fine line to walk.  You can't promise rainbows and not deliver, but you also can't be so vague that people think you may have rainbows.  It says on their advertising: ""Gun Bench – Provides players with the ability to visually customize their weapons and track their kills per weapon.""    Battlelog already tracks my kills per weapon, so unless that is getting taken away from non-premium peasants like me, I don't even know what that could me.    Visually customizing weapons could mean lots of things.  It may mean design your own skin (prepare for dicks on guns), or modifying the look of your optic, or something else.  If it were to mean, as /u/EliteDangerous implied ""zoom in on the weapon and rotate it around"", I think it was phrased extremely poorly, or phrased deceptively to garner more interest."
BF_Hardline,38aaod,demonlag,1 point,Thu Jun 4 03:46:38 2015 UTC,Console players have no good way to track kills per gun without going to PC... so can see how that would work nicely.  The visual customization as you said has to be more then just looking at it. Has to be a way to change the look of the gun. Which could be simply little different then changing the customization in player customization screen but seeing it on the gun bench while doing so and allowing a better view of said customization?

People started ""assuming"" it meant they could do things like make their own custom skins, change the placement of the scope closer or further away on the rail and generally do things to ""personalize"" their weapon beyond just the cookie cutter grips and scopes that you can put on the weapons now.    I would at the very least expect to be able to change the color and opacity of the red-dot in the scope as you can do that in BF4 - not on a per weapon basis however."

BF_Hardline,388rf0,ETuesday,2,Fri Jun 5 09:43:15 2015 UTC,I kinda disagree with bankjob being a good TDM map for Camera Coin's. I found Downtown had many better spots in the high traffic areas. Got mine fairly quick (before my marksman coins at least) good placement on everglades though.. back on the log stack is good on this map as well. as people always spawn right in front or behind it.

Camera coins are very easy... but I couldn't imagine many of these locations to be as effective as others I have used. Just saying... some spots seem weak? Experience must be very different on Xbox One if these spots actually work for you?  Edit: also, very small issue but slight OCD issue with me.

Could they have taken the time to come up with a mode that expands the cops & robbers immersion and fits the gameplay? I'm sure. But I'd be happy we're getting a new mode at all. All of the same modes are still going to be present on the new maps. As far as I'm concerned, they're fulfilling their goals of appealing to what the majority wants (tons of people stick to modes like TDM and BM) and keeping the focus on infantry-centric combat."
BF_Hardline,3896jv,TehDarkArchon,3,Tue Jun 2 20:18:43 2015 UTC,I played a metric shit tonne of kc in cod but I don't think it will work in this game due to the average kill distance and low ttk

But they have had this DLC in development for a LONG time and could have dont soooo much more with it than a coin being dropped... I literally can think of 5 more Bounty Hunter related types of modes right off the bat just sitting here. Its lazy and I am pissed bc I love the game and hate to see a waste of a game mode that could have been much more dynamic and far more related to the theme.

I am so upset bc as a hardcore HL player who has kept faith until today, now I am doubting the Viceral teams motivation and just all around understanding of what the community needs..."
BF_Hardline,3896jv,GregoryGoose,7,Tue Jun 2 19:12:53 2015 UTC,"I do think you're jumping the gun with the criticism when the patch isn't even live yet. There could very well be other changes involved in the patch that they haven't seen fit to share yet.  To your point of defending it from the ""Its too much like COD"": Why? Why are you defending a game you enjoy playing from people who obviously have a different mind set and enjoy different types of games than you? Who cares if its similar to COD? This type of game mode isn't specific to COD only, Loadout has a mode exactly like this as well.  The last thing I'll say is about your comment on how easy it was to code: the only people who comment on things like that, are people who have no idea. I do have experience in coding as thats what I went to school for but even I wouldn't comment. Why? Because its a video game. It has many millions of lines of code in it that neither of us actually understand. Its like someone from HR trying to tell an Engineer how to do his job."
BF_Hardline,3896jv,tentoesup747,-2,Tue Jun 2 20:11:27 2015 UTC,First off. It's not a patch its a DLC. And if you read the VERY detailed description of the game mode then it is a clear unoriginal carbon copy of the COD kill confirmed mode. They had a chance to do something better than kill confirmed mode with coins is my point. Very unoriginal and they could have used a money bag system with bounties of players being higher based on how well they are doing and if you can snag that bag then you would get more points depending on the bounty. So dont try to take up for this crap because I LOVE HL and have over 200 hours played but this unoriginal crap has pissed me off. I have nothing against COD and played all of the and loved kill confirmed... But I love all the BF titles ever since BC2 and THIS should be more original. PERIOD.
BF_Hardline,3896jv,GregoryGoose,3,Tue Jun 2 20:25:25 2015 UTC,"Sorry for misnaming it, I meant to type DLC and ended up with patch somehow!     Maybe I'm excited for the DLC because I never played COD nor have I been in the Battlefield franchise for very long. I personally think it will be very fun as a game mode and Hardline is going to be better off just having another option as far as game modes go. I understand why you feel its unoriginal but will that really stop you in enjoying it nonetheless?      You did say, after all, you loved Kill Confirmed in COD.. maybe this will be your new favorite game mode!"
BF_Hardline,3896jv,djghostface292,-1,Tue Jun 2 21:02:47 2015 UTC,"Of course I am going to play it. Just supremely dissapointed because I had hogh hopes for a creative mode that fits into the HL theme that would be 1 of a kind.. as it should be, But You're right. I will give it a shot but I honestly know by the details of the mode and the photo of the floating coin that this is not going to be an original mode. :/"
BF_Hardline,3896jv,fletch420man,2,Wed Jun 3 22:49:19 2015 UTC,"It's from COD but its not a bad game mode.

BF_Hardline,3896jv,UrbanRaptor,2,Thu Jun 4 00:05:58 2015 UTC,Are they trying to turn it into cod? I've been against all those people saying hardline is like cod or isn't like bf enough but now it's like they want those people to be right. I swear that is the exact same thing as Kill Confirmed!

I think Viceral really fucked this mode up by making it copy and paste of KC... But whatever. People will see when it comes out. I hope I am wrong but I am pretty damn sure this is gonna suck bad.

In particular not if Battlefield could do it BETTER.    but honestly this mode simply sounds boring (and what does this have to do with Cops & Robbers? this could be in BF4 or Star Wars Battlefront... that is what we call ""generic""). It is just TDM with a tiny mechanic change... w00p w00p dee effing doo.    So where is that premium gun bench!?"

BF_Hardline,3896jv,EliteDangerous,0,Tue Jun 2 19:32:20 2015 UTC,"What my grievance is the lack of originality and how they could have done so much more with this. Instead, it is a basic carbon copy of COD Kill Confirmed. For instance, make bounties larger for people on killstreaks and when a player dies it drops a bag of money which will be smaller or bigger depending on the bounty... But no. They just drop a coin. They should have just said ""meh"" and kept them as dog tags instead of rendering a coin. It's ridiculous because the theme of the game and the potential of this game mode could have been more. If you read the description of the mode on the BF website then it is CLEARLY a basic game mode with nothing dynamic and is a missed opportunity and just a rip off..."

Everyone who isn't the bounty target can respawn.  The bounty player only show up (briefly) on the enemy radar if they get an interrogation take down on someone from your team.   Maybe give the person designated the bounty a little extra health or body armor.    The team to collect say five bounties wins *this could vary depending on the number of players."

It should be a little bit more complex and just is dissapointing. I will be playing it and enjoying it but not  as much as I would if there was a cool bounty system and bags of cash instead of coins which just reminds me of COD when the game I am playing is BF HL... Fuck it though.. Not like I have 200+ hours in the game and I just expect more from the devs. I get hated on this sub reddit because I was expecting a better mode and they roll out this simple crap. I just love the game and I hate to think that stuff like this is what to expect instead of something more innovative or maybe a more quick patch to game breaking weapon balance...

Laser reduces time to full ADS benefit. HB and AG reduce first shot recoil. Fire in single fire and tap relatively fast (You will learn how fast you can fire and maintain accuracy with very little trial and error). The SA-58 is the best of the bunch followed by the SCAR.

BF_Hardline,389rzf,SplitVision,2,Tue Jun 2 22:35:36 2015 UTC,"On the M416 and M16A3 I run with Compensator or Muzzle Break and Stubby Grip to control recoil. If I was playing on PC, I would probably use the Heavy Barrel instead. I prefer Muzzle Break, because it lowers the recoil more than the Heavy Barrel (but less than the Compensator), yet has no downside.  On the Battle Rifles SCAR-H and SA-58 OSW I run with Compensator and either Stubby Grip or Angled Foregrip. I use the Stubby Grip in smaller maps, because I can just put all my weight on the trigger without making the gun kick 30 feet above the targets head. On larger maps I run the Angled Foregrip, because it helps getting off two round bursts accurately.  I don't equip the Laser Sight. Ever. It reveals your postition too much and aids too little with hipfire to be worth using, in my opinion."
BF_Hardline,389rzf,SplitVision,1 point,Tue Jun 2 23:53:27 2015 UTC,"Yea after I came over from COD I thought the laser sight would do more. In COD the laser sight boosts your accuracy from hip fire, but on Hardline it doesn't seem to do much other than give away your position."

BF_Hardline,389rzf,JasonKesler,1 point,Fri Jun 5 11:23:05 2015 UTC,Vertical grip reduces first shot recoil plus if you change it to single shot it still is a beast of a weapon. I always used mine with a acog sight (x4) as its decent at most ranges

Kind of a habit, but since I don't put myself in a position to be sniped, I move around a lot and take out snipers before they see me, I stand still and I'm not worried about snipers.  I do break this rule with 1 gun, which I'm trying to break, but when I use the UMP I use the vertical grip and I strafe a little, but CQB its a reliable 2 shot HS, so I switched to stubby and am not shooting on the move anymore.  TL;dr: the spread increase is too damn high if you strafe and mag dump or even burst fire. I know you're sitting in your chair super amazed at how cool I am, but I just don't strafe and shoot. I got myself out of that habit right as I hit 130-140 in BF4, which was in February-March."

BF_Hardline,387x48,DANNYonPC,1 point,Tue Jun 2 14:31:29 2015 UTC,"It's being released on the 19th for premium from what was on a leaked European advertisement. I think they just had all the youtubers come in this past weekend to play it also, but dont hold me to it. Whatever EA had them play and record in Cali has a upload embargo/restriction until the 11th (source:Xfactor).   So I would be guessing that since the advertisement release leak (19th) and embargo for the gameplay event footage for the youtubers (11th) are a week apart then that usually fits the mold for how DLC's are shown off. Like I said though, none of these are facts except that leaked advertisement which you can find somewhere on the HL reddit. :D"

I could grab images of maps for you but they would be x360 versions which are only small size maps made for 24 player count for the most part.

BF_Hardline,3841pj,TehDarkArchon,5,Mon Jun 1 19:13:16 2015 UTC,"In Battlefield Hardline: Criminal Activity, we are introducing a new mode titled, “Bounty Hunter”.  Bounty Hunter is a high intensity infantry focused mode that pits the teams in a war to collect the other team’s bounty coins.  When a player is taken out a team-colored coin is dropped in the world by their body. When an enemy coin is collected it is added to your team’s score. Friendly coins can be collected to deny the enemy the ability to score your team’s coin. The first team to collect enough enemy coins to hit the limit wins the match.  Although simple at its core, this mode provides some unique team and individual strategy.  It is imperative to stay with your team to prevent the enemy from securing coins from fallen teammates. The best strategies are to move as a unit, bringing ammo, health, and area denial grenades like gas and molotovs. Keep your teammates healthy, well supplied, and prevent the enemy from getting their hands on your bounties.  Use the lure of coins to your advantage. Leave a coin in the open and wait in ambush for an unsuspecting enemy player. Be aware of the enemy using the same tactic. Think twice before darting into the middle of the open to collect a coin, you may just become an easy point for the opposing team.  The size and scope of maps offered in Battlefield Hardline: Criminal Activity allow for a variety of play styles and provide an excellent playground for this new mode. In Black Friday, set in a Miami shopping mall, tight hallways and focused chokepoints provide excellent routes for run-and-gun players. Code Blue and The Beat, offer a blend of close quarters and medium range engagements that complement the new selection of battle rifles. Make use of the new K-9 unit or Pitbull companion respectively. Add an Angled Foregrip and a 4x Optic and you’re ready dominate at longer ranges in the hills of Backwoods. Just make sure you bring ammo, Bounty Hunting season is open."

BF_Hardline,3855a2,MKula,7,Mon Jun 1 22:54:15 2015 UTC,"BF4 has had the luxury of 2 years of maintenance and content development. There's much more variety in all aspects of the game such as weapons, vehicles, attachments, and other customizable options. Hardline has a surprising lack of weapon options, I'm sitting on hundreds of thousands of dollars and literally have nothing to spend it on.   As for the gameplay itself, you'll find that BF4 is significantly more like BC2 than Hardline. While Hardline has a similar tongue-and-cheek humor and doesn't take itself seriously, it lacks the large-scale destructive battles you've experienced in BC2. The lack of tanks, heavy attack choppers, and jets is still disappointing, no matter how much it clashes with the cops vs criminals theme.   In all, they are both good games: don't get me wrong, I think you'll still enjoy Hardline because it is fun and it is a unique twist on traditional multiplayer shooters. It's just that it's severely lacking in weapons, maps (and map variety to an extent), vehicles, and the destruction you have come to expect from a Battlefield game."

BF_Hardline,3855a2,McDerppington,3,Tue Jun 2 03:11:10 2015 UTC,"There's some decent people throwing out some pro's and con's. Personally I wouldn't come to a sub reddit dedicated to a single game to ask an ""apple or orange"" question, but at least there have been a few decent replies in this post.  Like others have said, it depends what YOU enjoy more. You, after all, are the consumer. You mentioned you liked BFBC2, so I'm leaning to bet you would enjoy BF4 more.  Both games are good in what they do. They're both first person shooters with great game play. One has more destruction and vehicle flavor (see bf4) the other has a good arcade ""Call of Duty"" feel with some vehicles thrown in to navigate the bigger maps (see bf Hardline.)   They both have a selection of weapons to choose from. BF4 has a greater selection of weapons that all have a different feel and roll. BF Hardline has a smaller weapon selection which has developed a load-out meta. You can still pick a gun based on flavor and personal preference if you're a Johnny type, but if you're a Spike then you'll be sticking to the meta which, to me got boring fast.   Dice said they weren't going to roll out new expansions for bf4 but they would launch new content patches so there is still more to look forward to with both games since the premium for hardline is just about to start rolling out dlc.  All in all man I still think you're going to enjoy BF4 more due to it being closer to bad company than hardline is."
BF_Hardline,3855a2,tentoesup747,4,Tue Jun 2 00:21:00 2015 UTC,"IMHO hardline is more fun than bf4 or cod. The ttk is spot on and the maps and game modes are a blast. The only downside is the quantity of maps, but that is just a waiting game at this point."
BF_Hardline,3855a2,chainjoey,2,Tue Jun 2 00:17:56 2015 UTC,"It depends on what platform you're on. If you're on PC, The playerbase is very low. If you're on the consoles, then you have nothing to worry about. If you like the rush gamemodes of Bad Company 2, then you might not like this game. (Doesn't have rush.) If you like your wartime games like Bad Company 2 then you might not like this game. There are some new gamemodes that are very fun like Hotwire, Blood money, and Rescue. Right now Premium is worthless and soon it's going to have few features. Still not worth it in my opinion.   This subreddit is kinda dead compared to other game subreddits of a similar reader count.

BF_Hardline,3855a2,weeknda,1 point,Wed Jun 3 02:57:48 2015 UTC,Depends on the platform PC I would go with bf4 if it is console I would go with Hardline. Also depends on your focus because if you like a lot of vehicles go with bf4 otherwise for infantry based combat I feel Hardline is better because the ttk is lower and there are less vehicles to hinder you and the vehicles in Hardline allow you to shoot out of them. I felt like bf4 didn't really have that much destruction. Mostly just walls and a few buildings. Which is also in Hardline just not as much because the maps are not as large so there are fewer buildings because it is more infantry based. The walls still blow up just like bf4 and some buildings do and some don't just like bf4. The only big difference is that bf4 has a few more levelution events but I think that will balance out a bit when more maps are released. I prefer Hardline but that is more because I'm not a huge fan of vehicles.

BF_Hardline,3855a2,EMPIREOFDEATHGAMING,0,Tue Jun 2 12:19:26 2015 UTC,Going to have to hop in this bitch and explain to you and everyone else that I own both battlefield 4 premium and battlefield hardline premium and I must say they are drastically different games. I must say the battlefield 4 currently has more content this is based on the fact that the game has been out nearly 2 years and the fact that all of the premium content has been shelled out. in regards to Battlefield hard line is a new game 3 months old. In order to make you understand that I did play battlefield 4 extensively I obtained a phantom bow in battlefield 4 which requires an extensive amount of work an effort. now in regards to your question on which one you should purchase I would say at this current point in time to purchase battlefield hardline mainly because it is a new game and battlefield 4 will no longer be in production. yes battlefield 4 currently has more content than battlefield hardline. although I do believe that was in the coming months hardline will be a good contender for first person shooters. Let's sum this up in a tldr: if the game that you are looking for is a massive 64 player battle ground with tanks armored vehicles helicopters and jets look no further than battlefield 4. if you are looking for a first person shooter with faster pace levels combat and overall speed of the game is faster look at battlefield hardline things that are missing from Battlefield hardline would be tanks jets and weapon selection. The weapon selection in battlefield hardline is drastically smaller than battlefield 4 I believe this is because they needed a class distinction in battlefield hardline as opposed to battlefield 4 in Battlefield hardline there are various modes like heist which make more sense do you have specific guns per class rather than all available guns to any class for example the enforcer class use a shotgun and high powered rifles like a SCAR H you professional on the other hand use a sniper rifle such as the Scout elite or the R 700 as well as they have available many single shot rifles. classes like operator which is the equivalent of a medic have guns like the M 416. the fourth class in the game is called mechanic this class ease gun such as the MP X .tldr tldr. I like both bf4 is old bfh is new and will have more content added. Bf4 will not. Good luck with your choice. I'm on ps4 BTW psn is tmxelmo

BF_Hardline,386ys6,BillyHoWCR,1 point,Wed Jun 3 07:55:24 2015 UTC,"I have never had this problem before on any other game. You can change the settings to make your audio louder for others but you can only make others louder by turning up the headset or the television. I have my audio turned up all the way, but others still say my audio is very low. You also have to turn the master volume of the game down very low or there's no way to hear over gunshots and explosions. I'm sure most people would rather their game just work instead of screwing with all the volume settings. I know i would."

BF_Hardline,3874re,Mayor_S,1 point,Tue Jun 2 10:34:45 2015 UTC,"There are some cheaters, yes. Sometimes people are just that much better than everyone else (rare but it happens). If you are sure they are cheating, report them. At least one guy I have watched had his stats reset recently. But you need to have something better than a high K/D to report someone.  The two most-used cheats are aimbot and wall hack. If you are getting killed from long distances and every kill is a headshot (aside from sniper rifles) then that is potentially suspicious. Wall hacks allow to see where everyone is, all the time (much like the tracking dart). If you are hiding in a corner, haven't been spotted, and a guy leaps around the corner and empties his K10 into you... he might be a cheater.  TLDR; There are some cheaters but you best be sure before you report someone."

Every time my friends are on the other team I try my hardest to find them and take their tags. Everyone does this. Don't be a cheap ass and camp or use cheap overpowered weapons like the K10 or M16. Go for the difficult but humiliating machete kill so they have to applaud your effort and not rage at your noob tactics.  But don't switch to the enemy team. If there's not enough room and you automatically get switched over, this is OK. Once in a blue moon you fight your friends. You shouldn't be playing against friends every week. It should happen once or twice a month but killing your friends more than that does inevitably lead to problems and underlying tension."

Do you single them out and/or defeat them in humiliating ways? Are you a known t-bagger?   If they are friends and you do any of the above then likely it is on your end. No way to treat friends.   If not and they simply are not mature enough to handle competition then you  might need to find friends who are mature enough?   I had a friend who felt it was funny to troll me and other friends online by jumping on the other team and then just single us out. He was not a great player or anything but annoying enough to have a friend always trying to single you out on the battlefield. Not something friends do... though immature friends will tend to allow it to happen.   We play online to enjoy our time with friends... we don't normally make friends so we can simply have known nemesis on the other team to confront.

BF_Hardline,381z4j,ZippyDoozy,15,Mon Jun 1 07:19:06 2015 UTC,"Not luck, the elevator is kind of ghetto in the BF series. You have two ""elevator"" one on the bottom of the building, one on the top. Essentially you go in and press the button to go ""up"" it activates two scripts (it might be a bit more complicated then this, but this is basic). First script closes the doors, second script activates a timer to teleport you to the top ""elevator"", when the timer ends, teleport script activates and when you teleport to the top, another script is added that starts a timer to open the doors, essentially meaning that the only thing that can damage you is grenades.  Meaning you can do what I do which is listen for the elevators and then throw a molotov as soon as the doors on top close, because then there are people in there waiting to get out.   TLDR: The elevators never move, you're teleported after a timer is activated when the button is pressed."

BF_Hardline,386d9w,Fisting_Fireman,8,Tue Jun 2 04:16:13 2015 UTC,"Let me give you the honest answer you deserve from a die hard professional and not some scrub that used it for a day and put it down. I have over 1,000 kills with each the AWM and R700 solely using magnum rounds and the hunter scope. I have a lot of experience with this particular attachment, it's the one I use the most aside from the straight pull which I use on the knockout (2,600 kills with that). Here's what it does, more damage to vehicles, and it increases the one shot kill range to the chest to 25 meters. When you're sniping you want to be accurate and get a head shot. Sometimes a follow up is required but what you're waiting for is the enemy to stand still for a split second so you can get a one shot kill. If you spam shots and like to shoot at moving targets, I would suggest using a DMR or the scout elite. With the AWM and R700 the best tactic is taking out other enemy snipers. Most of my kills were from enemy snipers because when you use the magnum rounds and hunter scope you're gonna have an advantage over any sniper from range. The magnum rounds are great for up close quick scoping as well, since it will be a one hit to the chest at 25 meters, something the scout can't do at any range (magnum is not available for the scout). So with this attachment, go for helicopters, cars, enemy snipers, and if you're ballsy you can quick scope. (I run iron sights on the block sometimes and it's challenging but satisfying). A decent attachment for the snipers, but only if you are quick at lining up the shot. Most people aren't good enough to use these guns and will tell you it's garbage. You just have to be good at aiming and this attachment will reward you."
BF_Hardline,386d9w,MapleA,3,Tue Jun 2 04:44:01 2015 UTC,"Just the kind of response i was looking for, thanks a lot. One more thing - are they 3 hit kills at distance? I've been using the regular ammo quite a bit and every kill has either been a 1 or 2 shot at most.  also do you know if they increase velocity or bullet drop or anything of that nature? i tried symthic but couldn't find that info"
BF_Hardline,386d9w,MapleA,1 point,Tue Jun 2 05:26:15 2015 UTC,"Yeah I'm checking symthic as well but I can't find an answer on the velocity or drop (or magnum ammo at all). I think if anything it gives you less bullet drop but I'm not sure. I know the AWM/R700 have less drop and less velocity than the scout which is why they're better for stationary targets. A 3 shot kill could happen if they have armor or if you hit the leg from past 100 meters but I normally get a kill in one or two shots. Apparently they're going to buff the magnum ammo so that it does more damage to armored insert (it should pierce right through if you ask me). So if it's an armored mechanic then maybe it'll be 3 shot kill past 25 meters but like I said I've had success taking out stationary snipers from a distance or quick scoping up close. You shouldn't be getting leg shots if you're sniping, honestly, and if anything the regular ammo will do even less damage making 3 shots happen more often than with the magnum ammo. Rarely happens for me, you learn not to even shoot at mechanics wearing armor after a while, even up close with the knockout. Once I see the shield over their head I have to pull out my Tec-9 or go for a difficult headshot. Hopefully that will change because the armor shouldn't stop magnum sniper rounds. Hope this advice helps, if you can find the magnum ammo stats send me the link because now I want to know the complete damage model."
BF_Hardline,386d9w,MapleA,1 point,Tue Jun 2 05:49:48 2015 UTC,"disclaimer: i've played bf3, 4, bc2, and sniped on all of them almost exclusively. over 3 kd on hardline and bf4.   i bought them and tried using them on the r700 for a while, and the verdict is: (almost) completely useless. Considerably less damage from range (almost every kill I get from range takes 3 shots), reload time is excruciating, time between shots is even more painful, and i don't know for sure, but it felt to me like bullet drop increased as well.   The vehicle damage is a bit more, but when you're waiting several seconds in-between shots, it doesn't matter. You're better off using the scout and sniping the driver out, or using a DMR if you're only looking to do vehicle damage.  It feels like the magnum rounds need an absolutely huge buff to even be viable"
BF_Hardline,386d9w,MapleA,1 point,Tue Jun 2 13:14:55 2015 UTC,Hey I found a link about the newest patch! It's going to make these guns and the magnum ammo effective against armored mechanics so no more three hit kills! Also it will increase the OHK of the AWM/R700 to 30 meters by default. I imagine it will increase OHK to the same as the knockout with magnum rounds equipped. So after this patch it's gonna make a lot more sense to use this attachment. Also stop acting like the magnum rounds are weaker than regular ammo. I can definitely tell you even as they are now that they are stronger than regular ammo.   http://mp1st.com/2015/05/14/more-updates-in-store-for-battlefield-hardline-heres-what-visceral-is-working-on/#.VW3dsEb3anN

I'm gonna have to disagree with you about them being stronger than regular ammo though - i've had SEVERAL 3 shot kills from distance, and not just on armored mechanics.   I firmly believe that using them nerfs damage output on players. I suppose i'd need a test dummy to actually confirm this, but I don't have one :("
BF_Hardline,386d9w,FinickyPenance,1 point,Thu Jun 4 05:58:17 2015 UTC,Trust me the magnum rounds do more damage up close and at range. If you're not making one shots then I'm not surprised you've been making a lot of leg shots.
BF_Hardline,386d9w,pandaridingatrex,1 point,Thu Jun 4 07:13:54 2015 UTC,"I found them to be a complete let down. I really feel with the increased recoil and slowed down ROF they are worthless currently. Visceral should the make straight pull bolt default on all snipers. As it sits there is almost no reason to use anything else in that slot. If the ROF remained the same and the weapon just had increased recoil (like it currently does), faster bullet velocity, and less bullet drop the magnum rounds would actually be useful. They might have to tweak the damage against vehicles again though."
BF_Hardline,386d9w,FinickyPenance,1 point,Tue Jun 2 15:47:48 2015 UTC,They're absolutely atrocious. Worst attachment in the game. There's no reason to purchase them until the patch that I presume is coming out with Criminal Activity.

I love to win and try my best but realize with a game mode like conquest it's hard for one person to carry without making the game into a chore.  My advice to you is to have fun. Change how you play for a few rounds.  Sometimes I get mad at the recons who feel their only purpose in life is to hide way back and camp. Then I see them switch teams at the end so they get a win. I know because I switch squads and spawn on the fucks to give them ammo. Then near the end I see them on the other team.  It's conquest and super recon is at the bottom of the list with a nice KDR.

BF_Hardline,384iu2,SplitVision,1 point,Tue Jun 2 10:55:17 2015 UTC,it is PC players just think like Molotov and kills you or runs at you with a knife and win
BF_Hardline,384iu2,BillyHoWCR,1 point,Tue Jun 2 11:33:25 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I guessed so. A lot of players on consoles (atleasts PS4) don't. They shoot mindlessly and hope they get a kill."
BF_Hardline,384iu2,brontesaur,2,Tue Jun 2 12:01:42 2015 UTC,"It can only really protect you not any of your team mates.   Not true... this is the most effective portion of the shield. I use it in Bloodmoney to stand in front of my teammates who are grabbing money to give them the extra defense needed. They can then use my protection to attack back at an enemy who is reloading.   It can't withstand explosives.   It does appear to reduce effect of grenades that would normally kill me from slight range. Though not when grenade is directly on top of me nor if I am not aiming shield directly at grenade.    It only protects a small amount of your body.   If crouched it protects your front side... though lag seems to be an issue for myself and others that we still get chest shot killed apparently while behind shield at times. (usually seen while moving)   No one really shoots it, they all throw explosives.   If you see a person preparing to toss grenade then it is your chance to quick switch to gun and shoot them while they are in mid throw. While moving towards them and away from explosive.    it is barely a distraction.   It can be at times... but can also be a very large deterrent to an enemy attacking you if you are teamed up with another gunner.    It is very difficult to get points with it.   True (will be fixed in next patch) but many gadgets don't get us points as much as they simply help us achieve a goal if used properly.    people only use it is to get the double barrel shotgun.   I have seen people use it while armed with double barrel... so likely the act of using it while earning shotgun has given many a reason to find it effective? Just as I have seen people still using cameras even though they are armed with the .300."

BF_Hardline,384iu2,UnclePa,1 point,Tue Jun 2 01:46:48 2015 UTC,"Use the breaching charge on maps with vehicles and the shields on maps with infantry only. Saves your ass from behind and excellent distraction for your teammates. If your teammate is shooting from behind cover equip the shield and slowly move from the cover to distract the enemy. Like everything in this game aside from armored insert and smgs, it has a learning curve. If you just want to run around and spray bullets mindlessly use the insert with a K10. Everything else requires strategy to use correctly."

BF_Hardline,384fiu,Buttborne,12,Mon Jun 1 19:55:22 2015 UTC,BF4 surpassed BFH about a month ago. You make it seem like it's news.
BF_Hardline,384fiu,pp3001,2,Mon Jun 1 20:02:29 2015 UTC,"In Australia on PC, it did it within a month of release."
BF_Hardline,384fiu,Raz0rLight,4,Mon Jun 1 20:06:30 2015 UTC,"Shame it's got this bad, especially on PC. I have premium and don't think I will ever get a chance to use it as everyone I play with on PC have gone back to BF4."
BF_Hardline,384fiu,Kiw1Fruit,2,Mon Jun 1 20:05:15 2015 UTC,"I'll definitely come back once the new content and patch drop, at least for a little while. I agree that the numbers are embarassingly low, but unfortunately this game doesn't have nearly as much appeal as BF4."
BF_Hardline,384fiu,TehDarkArchon,1 point,Mon Jun 1 20:22:17 2015 UTC,"I'm honestly happy I didn't buy premium. I wish I didn't waste money on the game at all really, not getting nearly the playtime per dollar that I expected."

BF_Hardline,384fiu,Raz0rLight,1 point,Mon Jun 1 20:14:15 2015 UTC,"With the way the Australian PC community plays it, its just not enjoyable 75 percent of the time. Depending on play style, the most played maps can be unplayable due to class and weapon balance. Bf4 is a better game in all honesty, and it still have serious shortfalls."
BF_Hardline,384fiu,Kiw1Fruit,1 point,Mon Jun 1 20:34:18 2015 UTC,"Yeh I have about 60 hours I think. I really enjoyed the game, have a decent KD but I'm afraid everyone I played with has moved on and I simply don't have the patience playing with randoms."
BF_Hardline,384fiu,maxcatz34,4,Thu Jun 4 15:39:41 2015 UTC,"I think this point has been made before. BF4 had a rough start but they have kept the life cycle alive with several DLC's, weapon balancing and upgrades. They have also made a huge effort in fixing the netcode. Most triple A titles die out in a few months after their release date. I honestly think Hardline has died on PC but lets wait and see what happens with the upcoming DLC."
BF_Hardline,384fiu,tentoesup747,3,Mon Jun 1 20:08:58 2015 UTC,Is this news? Bf hardline is a fun diversion not a top tier battlefield game.
BF_Hardline,384fiu,tentoesup747,5,Mon Jun 1 20:03:50 2015 UTC,I don't think it failed. On pc perhaps but not on console
BF_Hardline,384fiu,packer126,2,Mon Jun 1 20:19:47 2015 UTC,This makes sense because they just released a new update for battlefield 4 and there has been numerous opportunities to purchase BF4 for cheap. I got BF4 and premium for $30 on the Xbox one. I still enjoy both games from time to time but I definitely enjoy Hardline more but that is purely my opinion not to say its a better game.
BF_Hardline,384fiu,Deadkrash,3,Mon Jun 1 21:06:39 2015 UTC,In both cases PS4 is where its at.  There is a very active player base on PS4

BF_Hardline,384fiu,tyler2k,1 point,Mon Jun 1 20:11:24 2015 UTC,"They should sell the Ultimate Edition (Vanilla + Premium) for 75% off. $30.  I think at that price a lot of people would buy it, so it would replenish the communities, and it would make EA more money from Hardline than any other way.  The only downside is that it kind shits on the people who paid $100+ 2 months ago.... But, I still think its the right thing to do. Its the gamble of buying a game before/at/near launch. Plus, its better than not having people to play with (INB4: There's always servers... Sure, but is there a server in your region, game mode, and map you want to play on?)"
BF_Hardline,384fiu,BeerGogglesFTW,1 point,Mon Jun 1 20:13:17 2015 UTC,"They're not going to drop the price on Premium substantially until probably three DLC in. On the other hand, I think it's fair to say we'll probably see vanilla BFH hit the $20 range right as the first DLC is released."
BF_Hardline,384fiu,Mayor_S,1 point,Mon Jun 1 20:27:12 2015 UTC,Oh of course... I don't think they would do that. They need to protect their product before its released. I know what's going to actually happen... But I don't necessarily agree with it.
BF_Hardline,384fiu,pp3001,-1,Mon Jun 1 20:30:44 2015 UTC,The headline sounds like news. It is known for what now? 3-4 months?

BF_Hardline,3835rh,Djentleman97,1 point,Mon Jun 1 14:55:01 2015 UTC,It's also a sensitivity thing. The higher u adjust it the more moves you will naturally make. And become a harder target to hit.

BF_Hardline,383kt9,MapleA,3,Mon Jun 1 16:36:17 2015 UTC,Mag ammo is going to be more effective Vs armour next patch mate.
BF_Hardline,383kt9,Zaksjk,1 point,Mon Jun 1 17:13:58 2015 UTC,What exactly is magnum ammo in relation to the game?
BF_Hardline,383kt9,pawofdoom,2,Mon Jun 1 17:26:44 2015 UTC,An expensive sniper rifle accessory attachment. Takes the place of straight pull. Does more damage to vehicles and increases the one hit kill range to the chest to 25 meters. Only available for the R700 and AWM. A good attachment overall but needs a slight buff.
BF_Hardline,383kt9,partypete1337,1 point,Mon Jun 1 18:11:56 2015 UTC,"An attachment you can use on sniper rifles. Increases range I believe, but it's not very useful atm since it doesn't increase 1HKs. Most use straight-pull vs magnum rounds (if I remember correctly it's the same slot)."
BF_Hardline,383kt9,partypete1337,2,Mon Jun 1 17:41:26 2015 UTC,Magnum rounds increase OHK range to 25 meters. Huge advantage but not if they have the insert.

BF_Hardline,3839zq,LurkersAnonymous96,5,Mon Jun 1 15:24:05 2015 UTC,Camera coins are piss easy to get if you know where to place them. Easiest maps are riptide and bank job on TDM.
BF_Hardline,3839zq,Zaksjk,2,Mon Jun 1 17:13:16 2015 UTC,"Boosting in general has been confirmed to be a violation of the ToS. Although I'm not even sure how you ""boost"" camera coins. Usually people boost for the level 4 rep perk. Getting them in general isn't really too hard, it just takes a while (in my experience). I find large conquest games with maps that have long lines of sight (dust bowl is excellent) to be the best. Modes like TDM generally aren't as good because you'll find a whole army of people there trying to get them too, not to mention the map is already downsized.   Fortunately, the next patch is going to fix cameras. So if you're really frustrated, I would just wait for it to drop. I'm guessing it probably will in a few weeks with the new DLC."
BF_Hardline,3839zq,TehDarkArchon,1 point,Mon Jun 1 16:10:56 2015 UTC,"The map being small makes getting the coins easier. TDM is the way to get camera coins buddy. You get camera coins for kills taking place in front of your camera. OP you want some real advice? Do not ever put your cameras sideways on a wall and always put them in contested areas (any area in TDM is contested, have you seen the spawns in this game?) I'm the 3rd best professional in US on PS3 if that puts anything in perspective."
BF_Hardline,3839zq,MapleA,1 point,Mon Jun 1 16:26:33 2015 UTC,"Maybe on console it's very different, but on PC TDM, with the like 2-3 populated servers that are actually running TDM, it seems like there's a good 10+ players per team placing cameras everywhere for coins. In my experience the larger maps give you more areas you can drop your cameras to spot enemies. Notice multiple squads are capping a flag? Place down two on the right/left side aiming towards the flag. I've gotten up to 3 coins per game with this method. But I'm sure a variety of different methods could work."
BF_Hardline,3839zq,TehDarkArchon,1 point,Mon Jun 1 19:09:38 2015 UTC,Yeah I bet it's different on PC and even PS4. We don't have as much players so it's easier. I can't imagine having more than 24 players on TDM that sounds pretty awful to me.
BF_Hardline,3839zq,MapleA,4,Mon Jun 1 19:32:56 2015 UTC,Do you really need the .300 to enjoy the game?

BF_Hardline,381i1m,BillyHoWCR,0,Mon Jun 1 11:05:34 2015 UTC,Just saying... Microsoft likely has same policy on XOne as they do for x360. (as the change was in response to E3 points made by Sony on PS4 practices to be) And Sony had similar practice on their sytems (both PS3 and PS4) so that leaves just PC as possible and as you mention Origin... that is an internal issue. Not seeing as EA charging itself for updates of it's own games? (though companies are known to pay out different portions of their commercial enterprises to show cost liquidity within the company... but still less an actual cost. Visceral likely would not be required to pay for a contracted service as patches are on Origin.)  But again... all this talk is pointless... we will get there when we get there. (said from the front seat looking into the rear view). ;)
BF_Hardline,381i1m,Coronalol,0,Mon Jun 1 11:14:37 2015 UTC,Ya they don't charge for patches. Then there would be no reason to update a game.
BF_Hardline,381i1m,BillyHoWCR,2,Mon Jun 1 15:55:24 2015 UTC,Can you provide a source for patching on consoles being free?
BF_Hardline,381i1m,dieter0_07,-1,Mon Jun 1 10:16:44 2015 UTC,"patching on consoles being free   Since 2013 X360 games have been free for patches as seen here. I would assume the practice has carried over to latest generation?   Though that is far different from the idea that they are encouraged, as Microsoft actually has a policy to charge if they feel patches are happening needlessly or too often.   From what I recall Sony follows similar practices.   All of this conversation is still pointless as the last patch was just around a month ago. And the need to question when patches are coming out... (as was so prevalent and needless for first patch) is just incredulous. Patches will come out when they come out. Simple as that... if you don't see it on Battlefield News then simply wait for it.   We don't need the 'Are we there yet?' posts every other day as we did with first patch."

Across all classes  More personal customization of the character would be fun. Although this probably would take tons of work to do and unlikely to happen but think about it. Every one looks the same. If you could use apparel that pertains to each class like for example. The professional class uses balaclavas right?  We would change the color and use a few different versions of the balaclavas. Same with the bulletproof vests change its color and have few different styles of it.

BF_Hardline,37zbtr,fugazied,9,Sun May 31 21:16:30 2015 UTC,"The bad: TTK sucks.  Instant death makes it feel more like COD than Battlefield.  The mechanic's vest is ridiculous.  There are no class or teamwork requirements anymore (arcade shooter style).  The strategic element of the Battlefield is mostly gone.  The combined arms aspect is almost completely gone.  It often feels like a mindless instant-gratification arcade shooter.  Not enough content on launch.  The Block.  Kept the bad netcode from 2 CTE releases ago and many legacy bugs from Battlefield (fake reload anyone, revive issues etc).  Gun balance is the WORST I have even seen in Battlefield (and I have played many Battlefields).    The good: smooth launch compared to the last Battlefield game.  Some clever  little fixes to old Battlefield problems like squad leaders, minimap, cap zones.  Some good new game modes."

BF_Hardline,37zbtr,ZippyDoozy,3,Mon Jun 1 01:38:15 2015 UTC,"Good:     The fluidity of the controls and combat is really nice in my opinion. The discouraging of sniper camping by moving the mobile spawn gadget to engineer as opposed to Recon/Professional.   TTK and general weapon balance seems decent. However don't take my word on this. Being able to customize (non-vehicle) loadouts outside of an actual game/test range.   Cons:   There are still prevalent bugs throughout the MP side of the game. Nothing too bad, just some small irritating once in awhile issues. I feel as if customizing your loadouts could have an easier to grasp UI. It's not too hard to use after awhile of getting familiar with it. But it's definitely not on par with BF4's loadout which is simple to navigate and causes no issues. Multiplayer aspects of the game seem 'cheap'.  There's lots of maps and areas of gameplay that seem as if they were rushed, and there wasn't too much work put into it to smoothly fit the game together like puzzle pieces.  One example is the map Everglades. There are countless locations where people can sit behind bushes forger into mapped areas of shrubbery and trees that you can't get into, yet on the outer edges if someone is visible, the leaves are like brick walls and you cannot shoot through them. As well as detail aspects of the games.  Such as the alligators scurrying away into the water, they just kind of cut through into the water from land as if the water is not there and they're glitching into the ground.  If you ever see it up-close, it looks cheap, and very poorly detailed.  Not what you expect from a Battlefield game.   OVERALL:  The game is good for the most part.  There are areas of it that irritate me, or could definitely been improved; but overall, it is a fun game, and I can easily spend my entire day equally playing between BF Hardline and BF4.  Was it worth the $64 after tax? Not at all in my opinion.  Bur if the price were to equal itself to the true value of the game. (Even as high as $39.99 before tax) would be WAY more reasonable.  If you don't have BF4, and you're going to choose between BF Hardline and BF4, definitely choose BF4 as they're still releasing content, and it's at a regular price of about $29.99 everywhere you go.  If Hardlines price drops, then definitely go pick that up eventually.  But the game is most definitely good, and does not deserve as much shit as it gets."
BF_Hardline,37zbtr,DrFishy_,3,Mon Jun 1 10:15:03 2015 UTC,"Like: Being able to spray emblem, animal masks (none of which I will likely ever get as I don't like the game enough to play however much it takes to get 10 million)  Hate: Tdm spawns, getting killed behind cover because of the net code bs that's needed to accommodate like 7 different countries in one match, the fact that even if there was some kind of enforceable region matching it would just make the game servers seem even deader than they already are, invisible walls you can't shoot through, outfits resetting, severely limited outfit customization, server filters that aren't that good, etc, etc, etc."

BF_Hardline,37zbtr,fugazied,-1,Sun May 31 23:20:02 2015 UTC,"Same here, that first alpha/beta release had me excited.  I thought it was going to be an infantry-centric Battlefield 4 style game.

BF_Hardline,37zbtr,newfields,2,Sun May 31 23:40:37 2015 UTC,"TTK and lack of players.  I just played BF4 for the first time this week in almost 2 months. It is SOOOOOOOOOO much better when it comes to TTK. It is not ""insta death"" like BFH is. In BF4, I feel like I at least stand a chance if I move quickly to prevent my health from going to zero.  In BFH, by the time it is registering that I am getting hit it is too late. Even if I did safely get around the corner. The hits manage to ""catch up"" and I am dead.  The mechanic with the armor insert is what the baseline player in BFH should be. You can take a hit or two and possibly get out of the way if you act very fast.  As far as the lack of players (at least for PC) maybe if they correct things (like TTK), PC players will come back if there is a big enough incentive.  It is unfortunate. I like aspects of BFH but it looks like it is starting to breathe dying gasps before it goes under and drowns for the PC market."

I have been playing all the BF titles since BF:BC and I would love to see the numbers improve for the PC peeps but if they took NC and put it in BF:HL instead of BF4 then the community would loose their sh*t (not in a good way) including myself. I LOVE BF:HL, I have over 200 hours into it and cannot wait for Criminal Activity... But as a Battlefield fan, it would make me sick to my stomach to see NC in Hardline. First off, they just wouldnt do it and also the theme would not fit at all.   Viceral doesn't need a gimmick to get the numbers up.. The just need to get that patch out and hopefully do it right this time by balancing the weapons and getting the netcode up to par... The game is an awesome game, it just needs some tweaks.

BF_Hardline,37yfbo,SJ135,2,Sun May 31 14:34:59 2015 UTC,"I thought the spawns did improve a little bit after the last patch. I still find Everglades and Riptide frustrating. I don't think that players are getting spawn trapped as much in Everglades, but Riptide is bad. But I still enjoy the game very much."
BF_Hardline,37yfbo,sgt_anderson,3,Sun May 31 15:42:59 2015 UTC,"Let me paint you a picture.You just died and you get a 7 second spawn time.You finally spawn back in and you're put between 2 group of enemy snipers.Before you can even try to get into cover,you get drowned in sniper and dmr fire and you die.You return to the spawn screen with another 7 second spawn time.ejects cd"
BF_Hardline,37yfbo,ETuesday,1 point,Mon Jun 1 02:39:58 2015 UTC,Riptides spawns are the worst I have ever seen in a game....so bad even still.
BF_Hardline,37yfbo,R_law,1 point,Mon Jun 1 15:50:05 2015 UTC,"I think that the problem could be fixed in a way differently than people think. Most maps if not all, in TDM are sized down to make it more fast paced, but the level dynamic of that area still in play is constant across game modes. As an example, hollywood heights TDM is miserable unless you get inside with some buddies. If the gate on the far side was open to that other house, that would give a small area to decrease that killzone that is those little hills. I know block should sta the same size but I think for extended matches (high ticket) they could take away the burning down buildings or at least make them harder to destroy. That would make fighting less linear and more 1v1 gun fights. Rather than 13 people hidden in rubble shooting the spawns."

BF_Hardline,37yfbo,yosoytupadre,1 point,Sun May 31 19:50:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's obvious they're not gonna fix it though, at least no where soon enough to matter. They kept saying it was being addressed, but then after the patch landed and most people thought spawns were still 80% poop (down from 99% poop) they seemed to decide to take the approach of just ignoring it in hopes that people stop talking about it."

BF_Hardline,37yfbo,DANNYonPC,1 point,Mon Jun 1 02:47:07 2015 UTC,"There are a lot of factors that make tdm problematic, the high player count doesn't help for sure. Though I expect if Visceral made the default 32 we'd see a bunch of 64 servers rented.  Part of it is the lack of squad spawns meaning players always spawn at the map spawn points. Don't think I'm arguing for squad spawns in tdm, certainly not, but it is part of the issue. Players want to find enemies but it turns out that instead of going to the middle building on the map, that would normally be a focal point in another game mode isn't the easiest option. The best, fastest and way you're most likely to find someone, and not by seeing them in your kill cam, is to work the spawn points.  Riptide is the worst example of how this goes horribly wrong with the map design. Trying to get through the open areas to the big middle house serves little point for most players. It's kill players as they spawn or get killed as they spawn. The central mansion isn't an appealing place to fight as the map/spawns are currently layed out. I wonder what happens if they change the play area to include the second smaller house (used for rescue). Maybe it just turns into a dumb snipe off. That'd still be better than what happens now."
BF_Hardline,37yfbo,DarthPneumono,0,Mon Jun 1 15:26:29 2015 UTC,"How many players and what maps?   don't expect spawning to work good on 64 players, the maps just simply aren't made for it."
BF_Hardline,37yfbo,DANNYonPC,3,Sun May 31 15:26:23 2015 UTC,"If they're not willing to do the work to make 64 players function properly, they shouldn't keep it in the game just so they can say they have it."
BF_Hardline,37yfbo,DarthPneumono,-3,Sun May 31 16:04:46 2015 UTC,"TDM is made for 24 (ish) players, if you as player join a 64 man server you don't have the right to complain about spawns.   Especially if its the block."
BF_Hardline,37yfbo,thurst0n,3,Sun May 31 16:08:06 2015 UTC,"Which wasn't my point. If Visceral aren't willing to make 64-player servers work just as well as smaller ones, they shouldn't be putting it in the game. It seems like they're including the option to have 64 players just so they can say they have a 64-player mode. And sure, it can be fun and really crazy at times, but from a quality standpoint, if they aren't willing to put the work in they should include it."
BF_Hardline,37yfbo,DarthPneumono,0,Sun May 31 17:13:06 2015 UTC,"Is this your first battlefield game? This isn't a Hardline/Visceral problem, this is an FPS/Gametype problem. Some gametypes on certain maps work better with certain numbers of players.   Also, all of this ""working just as well"" is entirely subjective."
BF_Hardline,37yfbo,thurst0n,1 point,Sun May 31 20:54:24 2015 UTC,It's not my first Battlefield game (which doesn't matter since you literally said it affects every game immediately after that :P) and like... that's my point. If they can't figure it out then they shouldn't include it. It's that simple.
BF_Hardline,37yfbo,DarthPneumono,-2,Sun May 31 21:05:54 2015 UTC,"I disagree completely. I want more options, more customization more choices.  It's the same reason I use windows instead of mac. I don't want systems and settings to be closed to me, I want them open and accessible.   Getting mad because you have an option to do something but don't like that something is kind of immature, choose a different game type or a server with less players.  Like I said, some game types simply don't work on certain maps with a certain number of players, there is no fitting a square peg in a round hole.."
BF_Hardline,37yfbo,thurst0n,1 point,Sun May 31 21:24:58 2015 UTC,"Wasn't getting mad, just think that the developers should put a little bit of quality testing in, and if something doesn't really work across the board, they shouldn't bother putting it in.  Oh, and you think Windows is more open than OSX is? Show me where Microsoft keeps its open source code. https://www.apple.com/opensource/  edit: And let me say this, I'm a huge supporter of allowing choice when playing or running a server for a game like this. I loved UT for that specific reason. But I'd at least prefer that they make it work across the board or at least try to, which they really haven't. None of the maps/game modes in Hardline really work fantastically with 64 people. It was okay in 4, a lot of times it wasn't great but it worked a lot of places just because of how huge the maps were. But they're not here. This is a different game, so they shouldn't just copy-paste the options just so they can say it has a lot of people. I'm not arguing necessarily they should remove the option, just that it'd be nice if they put some work in making it work."
BF_Hardline,37yfbo,DarthPneumono,-1,Sun May 31 22:12:43 2015 UTC,"Yea I think that's more of a problem for single player and less so with the online. I'd rather have more options than less, but again that's just me.  And I'm not sure what you think you linked but just because apple has a few open sourced projects doesn't mean that http://www.microsoft.com/opensource/directory.aspx microsoft doesn't either. Anyways maybe it was a bad specific example, I can make my argument very simple. I want as many options as possible. There will always be trade offs."

However, my favorite police item that I ever saw working for a county sheriff was this tank with what sort of looked like a spear on the front. It was used to poke into the wall of a house where someone was held up inside. The spear once through opens up into a 'T' and the tank then reverses and pulls the entire wall of a room down in most cases for quick entry. I can only imagine what must be going through a persons mind inside that house watching that happen.  And, no... I have no clue how they justified that in their budget haha."

Now to answer your question:  1.) We built too much stuff so we sold it to the police forces in the US because we couldn't get the army and international markets to buy it.  2.) It's easy to get weapons in the US that can kill a human being and in more rural areas people who hunt a lot are good shots and snipers, making police there more fearful (akin to the British Redcoats vs Colonist Minutemen).  3.) The Shawn Nelson Incident in 1991 where he stole a US Patton Tank and went on a rampage.  4.) Terrorist Paranoia, the idea that if they have military gear they can fight homeland terrorism."

BF_Hardline,37vcfb,BarelyRegal1,2,Sun May 31 06:52:52 2015 UTC,Go to an empty server with a friend and shoot the Vip in the chest with the deagle/magnum and you will see that he gets 25 dmg per hit. Use explosions on the VIP and you will also see that he has the self-revive gadget.

Also have the grenade launcher and molotovs/incendiaries, get near enemy spawn truck and shoot them with a grenade, change to molotov, then grenade and it will mostly be destroyed by then, same for the CATs. Also in each side of the map, theres a SMAW, one shot with it and the  CAT is destroyed, you can get 2-4 vehicles coins in a match with this weapons"

I accept if 1000s of people are playing fine, but to say ""other games play ok doesn't fly"" and base it on nothing is being silly. BF4 plays fine and they're both the same codebase.

Regardless of the two games having similar architecture in their netcode it has little to do with the fact hundreds of thousands are having no rubberbanding issues with lesser connections.   Again, if you are having issues with rubber banding and thousands of others are not then it points at it being NOT the game. Yes you might run BF4 ok... but others not having issue with BFH are also running BF4 ok. And on note thousands have claimed issue on BF4 with rubber banding but it doesn't make it a game issue."

BF_Hardline,37u5ql,TosyV1,-1,Sat May 30 12:35:01 2015 UTC,"its way to easy to die as it is.   low TTK = low skill gap.   so high skilled players can get killed by n00bs way to easy.   the game is basically whoever has the jump on the other person wins the fight, and usually in a face off whoever fires first.   HC mode is garbage, go play COD if you want zero skill"
BF_Hardline,37u5ql,Kal_Torak,-1,Sat May 30 15:48:35 2015 UTC,Increased compared to what? Is it on a par with bf4 hc? Well thats like your opinion man I dont play the bf games because bullets are too weak and there isnt any teamwork. Is this different?
BF_Hardline,37u5ql,BumpyRocketFrog,1 point,Sat May 30 13:36:31 2015 UTC,In my opinion hardline hardcore is not hardcore. We ended up playing normal even though we always play hardcore due to the health being the same in hardline hardcore as it is in hardline normal
BF_Hardline,37u5ql,BumpyRocketFrog,0,Sat May 30 13:56:52 2015 UTC,But what is that level of damage in comparison to other games and other bf games? I would still play hardcore because of the lack of crosshairs and icons on the minimap. All that shit is game breaking imo.
BF_Hardline,37u5ql,dirtydeathdog,1 point,Sat May 30 14:10:46 2015 UTC,Both normal and hardcore in hardline feel like they consistently take one less bullet on average then it does in normal Battlefield 4 some people say it's more like Battlefield 3 normal but it's nothing like Battlefield 4 hardcore

BF_Hardline,37u5ql,A_McKinney,1 point,Sat May 30 22:21:02 2015 UTC,"sure, I get your reservations, and it's why we originally didn't have it set to that for the shipping game.  A large number of HC players have complained, however, and we listen to the community when they give us feedback.  We'll never make everyone happy, but we try very hard to make the best decisions for the largest number of people.  If we don't get it right, we'll hear about it again I'm confident :). We'll watch the stats on the percentage of HC games and servers, and if it drops we'll consider that evidence that this might not have been the best move, and adapt accordingly.  In this day, games are an evolving, living product rather than a release-and-done affair.    With any luck, that percentage will stay the same or go up."
BF_Hardline,37u5ql,A_McKinney,2,Sat May 30 17:26:46 2015 UTC,"and we listen to the community when they give us feedback   I understand that aspect but it is the idea you set the health at the basic HC settings without taking in the account for the already fast TTK in game. Thus the association with damage compared to TTK is needed to be made. Listen but test and evaluate what can be sustainable in HC games.     We'll watch the stats on the percentage of HC games and servers, and if it drops we'll consider that evidence that this might not have been the best move   Again, the point is not to have to do this by testing levels to see what actually produces quality game experiences instead of just tossing a percentage and seeing how gamers react.    In this day, games are an evolving, living product rather than a release-and-done affair.   This is true... but evolving by hit and miss guess work is less desirable then actually taking a qualified look at changing for the better."

I went back to BF4 after the spring patch to test out the new things (even though i had played 60 hours on CTE) and got bored quickly. While there are a lot more guns in BF4, they just feel to similar to each other compared to BFH.  The main issue for a PC player is the weapon balance. The M416/M16 are just blatantly OP, and you see 80% running around with these guns only. I remember Visceral stating that the weapons in Hardline would have more recoil, which is true if you run the gun naked. The fact that attachments make the guns so much more accurate really destroys all the weapon balance.  The main problem is that they are balancing PC and console as one."

Just from a fundamentals standpoint- in a military setting it is ""appropriate"" to have crazy shit happening at every choke point, in cops and robbers there should have been different objectives, I think this feeds the lack of feel in the game. Also the ultra fast TTK is kind of overkill, there are not many tactically enagaging encounters cause in bfH it's whoever sees who first wins.  Also they need to hire someone to balance the game- they clearly do not have that staff on hand- as evidenced by the game as it stands today and for it's short 3 month life so far."

I have never played conquest on The Block without one team getting all the flags then holding the other team to their spawn. I've been on both sides and neither is very fun. Both sides need an escape route of some sort.  I think helicopters need lower armor too.

Weapon progression is broken because of Hotwire (most expensive weapons are the best, with Hotwire you can just buy the most expensive stuff and skip the lower tier weapons... and people cry for nerfs instead of buffs.).    Soldier Ranks mean nothing in this game because of Hotwire. In BF4 i see a lvl 140 and know that is a dedicated player... in Hardline all i think is ""wow thats a lot of driving in circles"" but he probably doesn't even know how to aim down sights.    OK obvious hyperbole is obvious ...alternatively just nerf the points for driving the objective cars into oblivion so it can't be abused like it is anymore (and so the 3 players who play the mode because they think it's fun can still enjoy it). But yeah Hotwire broke a lot in this game.    For me the game got boring because there was no sense of achievement anymore because everything is so easy to get.    Step 2, make the assignments actually possible to complete within a reasonable timeframe (without abusing the system). Then you get players who actually play the game instead of people who exploit it.    Also, no pay 2 win please, give the pre order weapons to everyone, give those stupid ""premium super features"" to everyone who buys the DLC regularly.    and for pete's sake fix the Bank Job visuals, there is a laundry list of things that simply look wrong, reflections are broken, lighting is broken, shadows of clouds are going the wrong way when you look up/down, odd white lines that appear on the street texture since last patch... the map looked fine in Beta, now it's a mess.    ..."

For some reason visceral liked the game type so much that they made it worth the most points- but you're right, that just means that the highest ranking players are just playing hacker mode or Hotwire, and buying lower tier weapons just to survive doesn't make sense.  I think Hotwire should be changed to give the police a different motivation- stop the criminals. They shouldn't get points for hot wiring cars. For Christ's sake they switch teams each round already. And the criminals shouldn't just drive around In circles either. There should be some point at which the car is effectively stolen and they need to get a new objective. Hotwire should feel like ""gone in 60 seconds"""

In BF4 HC it takes 3-4 bullets to kill an opponent, in BFH it takes 4-6. That is a massive difference, and 6 bullets is just silly for any hardcore player. And snipers taking two shots to kill is just silly. Visceral really needs to fix it."

I've played cod before, and don't find it enjoyable. It's too fast paced, and the kill streaks are just silly. That game is the epitome of being a one man army. People are allowed to enjoy different things."
BF_Hardline,37rh28,Hunter1207,0,Sat May 30 03:49:04 2015 UTC,"Exactly, but I don't understand why you enjoy BF at all then, especially hardcore. In my experience its the exact opposite of what you say, hardcore is just evveryone running and gunning around because you can kill people in a few shots and don't require good aim to drop someone."
BF_Hardline,37rh28,brontesaur,2,Sat May 30 04:00:00 2015 UTC,"No, you actually need better aim in hardcore, because every second you spend spraying and praying is a second where you can get taken out in 1 shot. In normal you can spray knowing that if they aren't looking at you and someone else starts shooting at you you can get the kill then run away."
BF_Hardline,37rh28,Hunter1207,1 point,Sat May 30 04:13:54 2015 UTC,"That is some flawless logic right there.  I take it sniping also requires better aim because you don't have to aim for headshots, yes?"
BF_Hardline,37rh28,brontesaur,1 point,Sat May 30 04:22:44 2015 UTC,"That is some flawless logic right there.   I'm not sure where I said it was flawless logic? You can try to put up counterexamples if you wish.   I take it sniping also requires better aim because you don't have to aim for headshots, yes?    I'm not sure how better aim means you don't have to aim for headshots. Firstly, why don't you have to aim for headshots? None of the sniper rifles have minimum damage of 60 or higher, so if you're doing long distance sniping, none of them are 1 shot and therefore you still must aim for headshots to get a 1 hit kill. Secondly, let's say you're doing close range sniping. Then yes, the 1 hit kill range in 60 health HC is longer than normal mode, but at the same time, you must make sure you hit that shot because you die in let's say 3 M16 bullets instead of 4 or 5. You don't have the luxury of taking that shot, getting hit a few times, and then running away to rechamber and reload. So yes, you do need to aim faster and better, or you end up dead quicker."
BF_Hardline,37rh28,Hunter1207,1 point,Sat May 30 16:16:14 2015 UTC,"Normal core, to get a kill beyond a few meters with a sniper, you essentially have 1 shot and that has to go into the head. If you don't get a headshot, you will lose the gunfight.  Hardcore, you can shoot them in the fucking leg and they die.  Therefore, we can conclude that less precision is required in hardcore.  Regarding the spraying:  As an extreme example; let's say, theoretically, you have a room with 15 enemies at 1 hp evenly spread out. If you have an AEK or some shit you can just hold the left mouse button, sweep from left to right and the entire room will be dead. This does not require extraordinary amounts of precision, as it is just spraying across the room. Now, if they were all at full HP, this obviously would not work and you would probably not kill a single person. It will obviously also not be as effective at 60 hp, however, it will be a lot more effective than at 100 hp, as obviously the enemies HP is lower and therefore it is statistically more likely they are dying in a spray as less hits are required.  Same with 1 on 1 engagements. In normal, if you can consistently can aim for headshots or generally just good aim and recoil control, you can win most engagements against people of equal or lesser skill, sometimes even when the enemy gets the drop on you. In Hardcore, if your enemy is moderately good at the game (but not yet equal with you), it is just whoever sees the other guy first."
BF_Hardline,37rh28,OldYeti,1 point,Sat May 30 20:29:49 2015 UTC,"It's less about your aim, more about positioning. If you get the drop on someone, you're most likely going to kill them. But with no mini-map, no hit-markers, no doritos, no regenerating health, or vehicle autorepair, it makes you a lot more dependent on your team. There are people who go run and gun. Those people can get a lot of kills, but they get killed very quickly too. Those people never capture points instead focusing on getting kills. In what I've played of normal mode, it's too easy for me because I know where everyone is, thanks to the minimap and doritos. I never have to worry about my health, or if I've got enough ammo left. And sniping is just beyond stupid in normal because the fact that my dorito shines across the map makes it impossible for me to get more than one kill without having to relocate. But that's just my opinion."

Putting them on pillars or walls high up and pointing in the direction you want is great - think bank job, on the pillars of the bank in the street looking at the criminal money pile (if you're a cop). You can put them pretty high up, like 20 feet. Remember too, cameras can spot like 75 meters, so that's pretty good.  Oh and if a hacker is playing...maybe back out, or don't even bother with cameras that game."

BF_Hardline,37r5fm,ACovers,3,Fri May 29 19:32:09 2015 UTC,"The way it currently is, yes that is correct. Visceral supposedly is fixing that in the next update"

BF_Hardline,37r5fm,Mayor_S,3,Fri May 29 20:32:17 2015 UTC,Also don't spot people yourself as that will take priority over your camera spotting.
BF_Hardline,37r5fm,Jerimiah,3,Fri May 29 20:32:05 2015 UTC,"I struggled a long time until i tried TDM. As stupid as this tip sounds , it really works out. Go and play on TDM only servers and get into the know of some common positions for cameras."
BF_Hardline,37r5fm,mylilponyranger,1 point,Fri May 29 19:17:42 2015 UTC,I'll give tdm a shot. Thanks!
BF_Hardline,37r5fm,B-Live,2,Fri May 29 19:31:12 2015 UTC,"Also, you can lay down a trip mine a few steps in front of any spawn on Tdm and get some pretty scummy kills. Scummy, but damn they make me laugh."
BF_Hardline,37r5fm,DarkISO,2,Fri May 29 20:47:54 2015 UTC,"It took me about a three nights of about three hours on TDM to get the camera coins.  The only thing besides TDM that helped was doing taser interrogations, which counts toward intel assists, while playing conquest.  I got 3 camera coins spotting the elevators on B, and tasing people on the roof on Downtown."
BF_Hardline,37r5fm,DarkISO,2,Fri May 29 21:08:00 2015 UTC,"I had a rough time with camera coins to begin with but i figured it out. I got the most coins playing growhouse in conquest mode. I just put one camera on the edge of each of highlighted areas (with a clean line of sight to the flag), have the camera facing the flag Don't spot the enemy. if one camera gets destroyed just go and replace it I got three camera coins in one session. Good luck"
BF_Hardline,37r5fm,SplitVision,1 point,Fri May 29 19:55:51 2015 UTC,"They were a bitch to get, until I tried one match of tdm on Hollywood heights using nothing but the taser.

BF_Hardline,37qea9,doomguy26,8,Fri May 29 15:54:40 2015 UTC,"It's best not to even try to apply logic to weapon balance, especially when you're factoring in Mechanic guns. They make absolutely 0 sense and it will make you cross-eyed.  The great news is that the UZI and M/45 are getting revamped in the next major patch, so hopefully things will start to make more sense. But I agree with your analysis of the MP5K/MPX versus ""big bullet"" PDWs but with that being said the MP5k is also the complete opposite when it comes to damage at range, it just absolutely tanks whereas the MPX is significantly better at more ranges. Once again, there is no reasoning or clear thought process when it comes to the Mechanic guns, the weapon balance is horrendous."
BF_Hardline,37qea9,tyler2k,4,Fri May 29 16:15:59 2015 UTC,IMO the player the receiving end of the .45 ACP round should flinch more that the person on the receiving end of the 9mm as .45 ACP  has more knockdown power than a 9mm.  I also think the 9mm should do slightly more damage that the .45 (ingame) based on the 9mm's ability to penetrate.  Just my opinion
BF_Hardline,37qea9,B-Live,-2,Fri May 29 16:11:13 2015 UTC,assuming that in game characters are all wearing body armor as shown in almost every character model the .45ACP would do significantly more damage and might even break some of the ceramic plates on the first shot against the armor when the 9mm would take at least 2 shots to break the ceramic plates. Also the penetration would give the person on the receiving end a much higher chance of dying later on because surgeons might not be able to remove the slug. I dont think that it would effect the person too much in the short term but i don't know.
BF_Hardline,37qea9,call_of_warez,8,Fri May 29 16:49:59 2015 UTC,In real life .45 acp is actually less effective against soft body armor than 9mm and no typical pistol cartridge will defeat hard armor at all. Level 3 and level 4 ceramic plates are rated to stop rifle rounds traveling at 3x the velocity a pistol round would be.
BF_Hardline,37qea9,call_of_warez,0,Fri May 29 16:56:51 2015 UTC,at range yes the 9mm is more effective against body armor but in close quarters i think the .45 ACP is a bit more effective.
BF_Hardline,37qea9,B-Live,6,Fri May 29 17:06:51 2015 UTC,No it's not. That doesn't even make sense. Velocity is what defeats body armor. .45 ACP is a low velocity cartridge. It's a big 230gr chunk of lead that's not moving very fast. Against bare tissue and bone it's very effective but it's the opposite of what you want in a cartridge for defeating armor. There's a reason all the new PDW cartridges like 5.7 are designed to use small lightweight spitzer projectiles.
BF_Hardline,37qea9,jmg015,3,Fri May 29 17:35:18 2015 UTC,true. My mistake the research i did wasn't thorough enough sorry.
BF_Hardline,37qea9,ChillySchmitty,2,Fri May 29 18:18:19 2015 UTC,"The 5.7 is a great round. it maybe a very small (under 40 grains) but you are talking north of 2200 fps.  It was developed specifically to get through armor. I've shot a couple of fn57's, they are insanely accurate with very light recoil."
BF_Hardline,37qea9,jmg015,3,Fri May 29 18:19:37 2015 UTC,We don't know what caliber the in game MPX is it also comes in .40S&W and .357Sig. In BF4 it was chambered in .40S&W
BF_Hardline,37qea9,smite1911,1 point,Fri May 29 20:18:26 2015 UTC,On the wiki it is a .40S&W which is virtually the same as a 9mm
BF_Hardline,37qea9,zombieapathy,5,Fri May 29 20:53:47 2015 UTC,"9mm is .35 cal, the 40 was meant to be in between 9mm and .45, so no they're not the same"

BF_Hardline,37oehc,ACovers,2,Fri May 29 03:32:25 2015 UTC,It should be a quite simple fix. They can take 5 minutes away from gun balance to fix this issue. But then straight back to gun balance. cracks whip

BF_Hardline,37oehc,DefenseXIV,1 point,Fri May 29 04:25:57 2015 UTC,"Look for the little screen (like a video feed) while you're waiting to deploy and hovering over the spawn beacon.

BF_Hardline,37oehc,xCapTainDuLah,1 point,Fri May 29 12:40:33 2015 UTC,Yeah that has helped a few times but I would say 75% of the time people place them around a corner facing a wall. On some maps it's not to bad where all the building have different wallpapers but when it's just a concrete wall it's a bit different.  Oh well hopefully it's patched soon
BF_Hardline,37oehc,xCapTainDuLah,1 point,Fri May 29 14:59:11 2015 UTC,"A worse problem IMO is if you're playing tdm and one of your squadmates places a beacon, you can't unsnap from it if you accidentally (or intentionally) snap to it.  This leads to getting spawn killed by the enemy team if they're camping the  beacon. I've had to switch squads a few times because of this."

BF_Hardline,37q40k,BillyHoWCR,1 point,Fri May 29 18:57:46 2015 UTC,What are you talking about? Taking out enemy driving objective vehicles is playing the objective. As well as taking out Heli and other people that are looking at taking your own drivers out. He even gets in the objective vehicles at moments when option is granted to him.   This is totally playing objective in Hotwire. And I have played a lot of Hotwire.
BF_Hardline,37q40k,pigglesworth,5,Fri May 29 18:56:55 2015 UTC,"You'd be surprised at the amount of people who don't understand that a solid offensive player in Hotwire can effectively shut down the other team. Not to mention it's fun as hell.    In my opinion, the Downtown map is the best for this since you don't have to use your mobile armory trunks on Stinger missiles to deal with helicopters very often. Small map, lots of blind corners, narrow roads, and overpasses = RPG/Breaching Charges all day. If you're cruising around in a vehicle, you have to expect that.  The bike in Everglades is about the only time I'll do anything I can to get to an objective so I can capture it first, just because riding that thing around is a blast. So many jumps. I wish they had the bike on more Hotwire maps.  Anyway, yeah, I don't get all the hate for vehicle destruction in Hotwire. Somehow destroying a vehicle full of enemies so your team has a shot at capturing it is ""not playing the objective""."

The 'TTK' Time to Kill is already so low that it's barely noticeable. The only thing I think that this will actually change is that it'll make the scout a one shot now so prepare for tons of scout snipers as if there weren't already enough.

I will agree with 'near death' perhaps but I've already seen a positive influx of low ranked players from my guess would be the temporary 'sale' of Hardline being like 30% off or something?

You say that the muzzle brake sacrifices accuracy, where as it infact increases spread decrease (which is positive)  You also mention that the stubby increases ""maneuverability"", which isn't a real stat. I'm assuming you mean accuracy on the move. Stubby doesn't affect accuracy on the move, only spread increase per shot.

BF_Hardline,37kjg3,kht120,3,Fri May 29 01:56:59 2015 UTC,got premium too even though I hardly play hardline. Hopefully they hurry up with the improvements from BF4

BF_Hardline,37kjg3,nightbass,0,Thu May 28 09:02:44 2015 UTC,I would buy it if there were more players. I like Hardline too but finding a good place is getting harder and harder.
BF_Hardline,37kjg3,kiggerized,0,Thu May 28 13:53:59 2015 UTC,Fellow Premium on PC User! I agree with your assessment of Hardline. It is a great game. People will always find a reason to complain but as far as launches go it was one of the smoothest launches I've ever experienced for an online multiplayer game. Mask details have been announced and I'm excited to get to play on new maps! I need to hurry up and finish getting the licenses already so I can be ready to start the new weapons!
BF_Hardline,37kjg3,pandaridingatrex,-4,Fri May 29 08:31:06 2015 UTC,"""You can laugh all you want...""  BAHAHA that bit slayed me"

BF_Hardline,37kjg3,PaulyMcwhogivesashit,1 point,Fri May 29 08:37:44 2015 UTC,"For it to be downloadable, More than likely."
BF_Hardline,37kjg3,StealthyOwl,3,Fri May 29 11:08:01 2015 UTC,"Maybe when it goes on sale. Hardline was fun when it was brand new for me. It isn't a bad game, but I get burned our quickly on it and don't want to put more money into it just yet. I'll just stick with Destiny for now."
BF_Hardline,37kjg3,spangyo,7,Thu May 28 13:49:58 2015 UTC,I'm torn. On one hand I feel like there wasn't enough content to begin with and I don't want to give them anymore money. On the other hand I really want more maps and guns.
BF_Hardline,37kjg3,pandaridingatrex,-2,Thu May 28 10:41:10 2015 UTC,"I'm in the same situation myself, and I will probably have to do as I rely on that content for my YT videos."
BF_Hardline,37kjg3,josh6499,2,Thu May 28 11:34:24 2015 UTC,"First, yes. Premium PC but would buy Premium just to get this at a discounted rate anyways. A I'm always a fan of new maps/weapons/vehicles plus new masks for Premium that include xp boosts. Doesn't matter that I'm 150, counts towards earning money plus I can always use that once they release legendary. Anyways, within a couple days I found my favorite server for HC TDM 32 players and it's always full. Found a great group of guys to play with and talk smack to each other over Teamspeak for true squad play and domination even if it's just TDM. Although I'm partially biased on the purchase because I need to keep justifying 50$ for zero extra content for premium thus far I like what Visceral creates. Huge Dead Space fan and honestly this game is tons of fun. I would advise you to looking into getting a good group of people to play with. It's definitely the difference of a good game to a great game."
BF_Hardline,37kjg3,BubbaBeWorkin,8,Fri May 29 08:36:06 2015 UTC,"Haha, everyone saying no is getting downvoted.  I've been playing BF4 a lot more than Hardline and enjoy it a lot more. With the BF4 spring patch and this DLC splitting the already small population in this game I'll probably sell Hardline now."
BF_Hardline,37kjg3,pandaridingatrex,6,Thu May 28 14:08:38 2015 UTC,Don't you know only positive messages are allowed? Welcome to reddit gaming culture.
BF_Hardline,37kjg3,Covertxof,2,Thu May 28 14:56:45 2015 UTC,"Upvoted just to combat those debbie downers. I appreciate your honesty and understand your complaints. Luckily for me I've found a couple of good servers on PC that are always full and actually met a good group of players so it makes for some great times. However, should the game -completely- die (please let it never happen and sell it for 50% of Visceral just to boost your numbers) BF4 will always be waiting for me."
BF_Hardline,37kjg3,Covertxof,2,Fri May 29 08:40:19 2015 UTC,"I have premium, so I suppose so. No interest in the masks, not interested in the low rider vehicle. A couple of the maps look cool. New weapons might be OK."
BF_Hardline,37kjg3,pandaridingatrex,1 point,Thu May 28 08:59:59 2015 UTC,"It would be cool if it was just some shit they chucked in to an otherwise fully fledged functional game. But HL is making the gimmick their core gameplay. Tongue in cheek, as someone from Visceral said. If I want tongue in cheek, I think that's what gta is for. If i want super fast tdm, COD. Battlefield should be more. There are still the diehard fans that cannot see its unravelling,  but it's happening. And it's the developers bad decisions that are doing it.  I am sad for the franchise,  because after 3 game generations and nearly 1000 hours of play,  I cannot see better things coming.. just more gold plated low riders."
BF_Hardline,37kjg3,Covertxof,2,Thu May 28 14:40:56 2015 UTC,"I understand that it has 'Battlefield' before the title but I find it helps if you just completely ignore that. Any game that isn't military I won't consider Battlefield. I personally love TDM (I prefer hardcore but thats just taste) in this game. I also disagree with your assessment if t hats what you're implying. What Battlefield has always had over COD was getting a good group of players together to work towards the goal. That still happens on conquest servers hell even in TDM it can happen, albeit to a smaller extent with moving spawns. (Please bring Domination to Hardline.) I don't speak for the other 'Die Hard Fans' but for me, I don't think it's unraveling because I don't treat this as if it's Battlefield 5 but as it's own game in itself. Some people say a cops v robbers mod of BF4 is unacceptable but I have tons of fun with it and love Visceral have since Dead Space. This game was stable at launch, can you say the same about Battlefield 4 with Dice? A much larger and established company? I feel like this is similar (not exactly like but -similar)  to the differences between Grand Theft Auto and Saints Row. GTA is more serious and Saints Row is more of a comic relief.  But to each their own. Have an upvote for having an opinion!"
BF_Hardline,37kjg3,pandaridingatrex,2,Thu May 28 23:19:19 2015 UTC,"Firstly, woooo! Someone who knows reddiquitte. Champion.  You're right, I should ignore Battlefield in the title. I also agree with your assessment of the team play, to an extent. The game is more geared towards team play, but since the PS4 came out(my primary gaming platform), and party chat with it; real cohesive public play is almost dead. I remember getting in a squad of strangers in BF3 and making shit happen when everyone was keen to PTFO. But now, with party chat; everyone is in a party and you can't squad up unless you're with mates. So--not a BF problem, but a console problem.. Anyway, it still has its effect.  I didn't care about the fact that it was cops and robbers, I didn't think it was a re-skin on BF4. It ran silky smooth; I freakin' loved the beta. I think, what disappointed me was that it wasn't a small taste of the game, it was pretty much just the game... I had greater expectations leaving the beta and coming into the game release. Though, as you pointed out; the game ran pretty well on release. 64 player on console was shit at the start, but it's a lot better now.  As you may tell, right now, I'm not a fan of Hardline(despite my massive enjoyment of both betas). But I hope to change my opinion. I've left the game as of a couple weeks ago. But when the DLC is released I'll download it and give it another solid crack. Hopefully a small break and new DLC will help me find that thing that makes me itch to play it."
BF_Hardline,37kjg3,Covertxof,3,Fri May 29 08:50:14 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry that you're not a fan at the moment. I also hope Visceral pulls off a miracle and like Lazarus resurrects this game from death. Not religious, just thought it sounded witty... <_< Anyways, best wishes!"
BF_Hardline,37kjg3,Covertxof,1 point,Fri May 29 09:44:26 2015 UTC,"Thanks, bud. I thought Lazarus was a video game character I had not heard of. Oh, well, close enough to religion, I guess. hah.  I think, technically, Visceral could do it. They have dramatically improved the games performance over what DICE managed. I just think it need some tweaks, though the real frustrating thing is that I cannot pin point what actually bothers me about it.."
BF_Hardline,37kjg3,pandaridingatrex,2,Fri May 29 09:54:15 2015 UTC,"Yeah don't really care about the masks either, or the new vehicles. Hope the new guns are good though."
BF_Hardline,37kjg3,Covertxof,1 point,Fri May 29 09:59:10 2015 UTC,"That's one of the things I don't like about gaming anymore. Too many gimmicks. I want a better game,  not 300 skins, tags, emblems, and accessories with the same stat modifiers.  I really hope the maps, game mode,  and guns are good."
BF_Hardline,37kjg3,MangoEmperor,2,Thu May 28 09:18:02 2015 UTC,"Maps look exciting, plus... Two are night maps! So excited. ""I want a better game"" The game -is- stable has been since launch, unlike BF4 at their launch. They've started CTE and will be testing their new 'netcode' that Visceral basically designed for Dice and BF4... They got a patch out and are already working on a second patch to fix reputation and more gun balance fixes and tweaks... Anyways back to gimmicks. You may not like it but people spend serious money on Counter Strike for 'skins' and many players do want to customize their avatar. I don't feel Visceral is sacrificing time on trying to improve game play for customization but thats just my opinion."
BF_Hardline,37kjg3,BkLiveWire,1 point,Thu May 28 10:53:39 2015 UTC,"Yes, the game is stable. Yes, BF4 fucking sucked at release. But yeah, the gimmicks. It's just not my cup of tea, I get that there is a huge market for it...But I can't help but feel there is SO much attention given to all the cool-shiny things that some core game play gets ignored.  I just worry that developers are going to great lengths for cosmetics and fail to entertain the thought that sometimes someone actually wants functional things. One example was BF4 silencers. There were, like 6 to chose from.. They ALL did the same thing. Why not have ones that have a better suppression sound with a greater velocity drop--or something to make their variables change instead of the appearance being the only thing that sets them apart?.  From a statistics stand point, I would gladly take on many options. Cosmetically, meh.  Like I said, I'm really hoping for some epic maps to be released.. That's my big want for the first DLC."
BF_Hardline,37kjg3,pandaridingatrex,2,Fri May 29 08:56:04 2015 UTC,Grabbing Premium for PS4 tomorrow :) Code Blue and Black Friday look awesome
BF_Hardline,37kjg3,OriginIsGreedy,2,Fri May 29 09:50:36 2015 UTC,"I like Hardline a lot but my only gripe is not enough content. Since i got premium, I cant wait for these DLC's to be released!!"
BF_Hardline,37kjg3,PM_ME_NICETHINGS,1 point,Thu May 28 14:09:29 2015 UTC,"Not enough content? The game had as much as BF4 did at launch, didn't it? If you wanted a game with all it's DLCs out BF4 still has a huge player base. I have 200+ hours into this game and I'm still not tired of it. However, I too am excited for the DLCs. High five for supporting Visceral! BSH"
BF_Hardline,37kjg3,Maggost,1 point,Thu May 28 18:32:30 2015 UTC,"Battlefield 4 had much more content at launch, more weapons, more game modes, more players, more variety."
BF_Hardline,37kjg3,SplitVision,2,Fri May 29 08:58:24 2015 UTC,Gonna see how many servers are actually running the dlc first. Dont wanna buy it just to find out that there are only 2 populated servers with the DLC content.
BF_Hardline,37kjg3,fletch420man,2,Fri May 29 12:31:00 2015 UTC,I have premium and playing on PS4. The game is awesome and 50$ doesnt hurt my wallet.
BF_Hardline,37kjg3,pandaridingatrex,4,Thu May 28 21:44:27 2015 UTC,"I don't have premium, but I'll most likely buy it."
BF_Hardline,37kjg3,fletch420man,-2,Fri May 29 11:53:35 2015 UTC,"I don't have premium either, but I'll shop around to see if I can get it cheap."
BF_Hardline,37kjg3,pandaridingatrex,3,Thu May 28 10:31:24 2015 UTC,"no- The game is fun but the number of players is not. I split time back to BF4 last weekend  and aside from a few things from the spring patch that seem goofy (really full tracers full time???) BF4 is quite busy. I'll keep an eye out though- I suspect it will be on sale for 5bucks inside of a couple weeks, the unfortunate part is any splitting down of the PC playerbase across new maps could kill the PC game the rest of the way off- unless 10k+ folks join for the DLC...>)"
BF_Hardline,37kjg3,fletch420man,1 point,Thu May 28 11:35:40 2015 UTC,I don't see them putting it on sale for less than a tenth of the original cost. However I would love for them to put it on sale for like 10-20$ just the base game to boost numbers. Keep Premium 50$ and if players enjoy the base game they can invest that way. It -will- be interesting to see how the DLC effects the numbers.
BF_Hardline,37kjg3,texasreapercrew,1 point,Thu May 28 14:21:38 2015 UTC,"SInce when is a DLC 50$? If it is 50 no way in fuck....this would be the first time I ever had to look at DLC cost (thought they ranged in the 20's)- All prev bf titles I had premium before launch. I'm going to keep playing a couple round of bfh a week casue it coin op vid game fun, but spending most of my gametime back at bf4-"
BF_Hardline,37kjg3,pandaridingatrex,1 point,Fri May 29 09:00:37 2015 UTC,That was for Premium as a whole. Which includes DLCs 1-4...  You can buy the individual DLC for like $20 I believe.
BF_Hardline,37kjg3,pandaridingatrex,1 point,Fri May 29 12:31:21 2015 UTC,"right on- that's what my origonal point was....the single DLC for 5-10, not prem. I do hope the game lives it is pretty fun in the arcadey kind of way-"
BF_Hardline,37kjg3,pandaridingatrex,4,Fri May 29 12:55:52 2015 UTC,"I'm taking a stand against buying ask the ""extras"" that devs offer. Yea, I understand their benefits and appeal, and yea, I know my voice won't be heard, but fuck. This is a damn racket. All this nickel and diming will push put the casual gamer such as myself."
BF_Hardline,37kjg3,pandaridingatrex,0,Fri May 29 13:02:52 2015 UTC,"Let's be honest... Premium is what, $50? Breaking that down thats 12.25 a DLC... So roughly $3 per map? That doesn't include any guns they add with each DLC nor vehicles. Base game comes with 9 maps? Premium is 4 DLCs x 4 maps... 16 maps?  Nearly doubling the map content, same with guns and additional vehicles possible game modes plus the masks/gun bench. More power to you for making a stand but charging the price of a game for basically including essentially another game seems somewhat fair... That could be me though."
BF_Hardline,37kjg3,BillyHoWCR,0,Thu May 28 11:24:49 2015 UTC,"I can completely understand where you're coming from, I wonder how much effort has been put in to this dlc in development where that time and effort could have been spent patching the game."
BF_Hardline,37kjg3,Joppe84,1 point,Fri May 29 09:06:33 2015 UTC,BucklingOne you do know they've -already- released a patch and already confirmed a second patch which will likely release before the DLC yes? Thats two patches before their first  DLC. I think too many people are blowing over the fact this game is -stable- BF4 was far from it at launch and this game has -yet- to be down for more than a day across any platform to my knowledge... I understand people want weapon balance and such but to my knowledge there aren't any game-breaking glitches/bugs currently.
BF_Hardline,37kjg3,kiggerized,2,Thu May 28 11:35:11 2015 UTC,"I understand that there has been a patch recently, but there are still some annoying bugs in the game. Camera placement is really buggy and you have to fiddle with it to get it to work sometimes, I am still seeing kill-trades and insta deaths. I encountered a glitch yesterday on The Block where a wall had blown up but i couldn't jump over it, character models sometimes stay in the same position they were when dead, meaning you have like a floating corpse which can be very confusing, there's a glitch where sometimes you see people run around on their knees or backwards/sideways, the shotguns are still broken etc.  Don't get me wrong, I love this game and I really want it to do well and I wish more people would play and realise it's a great game, but I just think the devs should be more focused on fixing the game to make it a better experience for everyone (console and pc) before trying to take more of our money.  Also, any of you guys that play on pc, make sure you watch this video from Westie where he talks about separate balance for console and pc, it's really interesting:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gm03HtCjLU"
BF_Hardline,37kjg3,MangoEmperor,1 point,Fri May 29 09:08:53 2015 UTC,"Alright for the bugs you listed.   Camera Placement; I assume you mean the gadget for the Professional Class. I didn't have trouble getting coins and I play on 32 person TDM. I've never stopped to actually use them for spotting because I play hardcore -but- if you are speaking of the gadget then they are being fixed in the upcoming patch from what I've heard.    Kill trades/insta kills; will happen thats just part of the game. They are trying to get CTE so they can implement their 'netcode' which is supposedly supposed to cut down on that a lot.   Glitch with wall; Thats a low priority glitch I would assume but if you submitted a ticket I'm sure they'll look into it.  Dead Bodies Positioning; another low priority glitch, I've also experienced it and fired at it. It is distracting but not game breaking I'm sure they're aware and looking into that but I would submit a ticket if you havent already.  knee surfing; also experienced, agreed is annoying and also sure they know but as previously stated I advise you include it on your report.  Shotgun lag; I know they are aware and working on it, I believe the 'netcode' should fix that a lot but they are working on it. It does make shotguns basically useless in my opinion so semi game breaking.  I'm glad you love this game and want it to do well. I do also. I also understand however that this is a relatively small company compared to Dice. Visceral is trying to manage all the feedback they get on social media, get CTE up and running, produce future DLC content and fix glitches without breaking the game which I guarantee is easier said than done.  'Before trying to take our money.' - They have already taken our money from those of us who have purchased the game and even more so those of us who bought premium. Oh yeah, they have to divert resources to create the Premium Content ontop of other just DLC content. I think you're slightly mistaken in assuming they're just trying to money grab from what I've seen on podcasts/posts by members of the Dev team they are working hard and striving to make this game great. Perhaps I'm naive. /shrug Just my two cents."
BF_Hardline,37kjg3,BubbaBeWorkin,1 point,Fri May 29 10:46:04 2015 UTC,"Totally appreciate your two cents and I can see your point of view. I'm not trying to argue with you here, more so just put across my point of view. You make a very good point about the devs trying to manage all the feedback they get, which is something I think that we are blessed with in the Battlefield series as a whole, and is often way under-appreciated. I just wish they were trying to do more to dispel the negativity surrounding the game. Just look at some of the comments on this post. I firmly believe that, in time, we will have a harmonious player base for this game, but until then we are dealing with the hangover from the very common misconception that this is a ""Battlefield 4 reskin"" etc. and people are avoiding the game due to these reasons."
BF_Hardline,37kjg3,MangoEmperor,2,Fri May 29 11:23:36 2015 UTC,"I appreciate you making your point. I am also not trying to argue with you. I think as a company they are trying to dispel the negativity but may have 'bit off more than they can chew' with this project if that makes sense. I think they're taking the, fix the problems to dispel negativity angle and lacking on the telling us how they're doing it. I think communication is really hurting them. I also know like one of them said on a podcast. It would be annoying/hinderance to have someone constantly pop by and ask them questions about progress but I feel like maybe one hour/30 minutes every day (work days) they could all convene in a conference room and have the social team (if they have one) just fire away questions and they try to answer as many of the important ones as they can or perhaps instead of all week maybe on Mondays they allow a good 2-3 hour straight chunk just to post an update on their progress and answer questions that way. I feel the majority of the people just feel like they're going unanswered and thats bothering them more than the game itself."

BF_Hardline,37kjg3,auApex,-5,Thu May 28 11:45:57 2015 UTC,"Can't really do much about that until a large amount of PC players get it out of their head that this isn't a ""reskin expansion"".  Game is booming on the consoles (especially PS4) for some reason though."
BF_Hardline,37kjg3,pandaridingatrex,2,Thu May 28 13:51:40 2015 UTC,Even the consoles had huge dropoff numbers though.
BF_Hardline,37kjg3,MangoEmperor,-1,Thu May 28 14:08:46 2015 UTC,"I didnt look at total numbers, what I look at are the amount of servers there are available and full of players when I play."
BF_Hardline,37kjg3,pandaridingatrex,2,Thu May 28 14:55:30 2015 UTC,PC dropped from 33k to 5k and ps4 from 130k to 40k last I looked.
BF_Hardline,37kjg3,MangoEmperor,0,Thu May 28 15:22:59 2015 UTC,"You're right. It's not ""thriving.""  FFS, they slashed the price by 1/3 within two months of the release.  That is a horrendous fail for a AAA, big budget title."
BF_Hardline,37kjg3,nutcrackr,1 point,Thu May 28 15:50:20 2015 UTC,"From a sales point yes, but will anyone else acknowledge that the game for the most part is stable. I am aware it's sad that the game being stable is worth mentioning but seriously... Dice a much larger company had stability issues out the wazoo early on. Visceral has managed to keep this game from crashing. Are working on weapons balancing tweaking while producing content for the DLCs. So, yes from a sales point it may have been a flop but from a player's stand point I couldn't be happier with the game. Over 200 hours and over 1000 kills with 13 weapons nearly 14... So don't say there is only K10/MPX/M16/M416."
BF_Hardline,37kjg3,nicb205,1 point,Thu May 28 18:32:18 2015 UTC,"Hardline's stability is often mentioned as a huge positive but is it really that much of an accomplishment? It's heavily based on BF4 which has been very stable for months, despite its disastrous stsrt. Hardline is much less complex than BF4, from a technical perspective (i.e. graphics, destruction, scope of gameplay) and the overall amount of content in the game.   I'm definitely not pushing the tired ""Hardline is just a BF4 mod"" argument, because it's definitely a lot more but it IS heavily based on a very stable game so stability is just par for the course in my opinion."
BF_Hardline,37kjg3,Steevio,1 point,Fri May 29 09:16:00 2015 UTC,"Based on BF4 is flat out wrong. They created the game from the ground up, the only thing they 'used' from BF4 was the engine it was based on, you're implying it's just a reskin which it isn't. BF4 was -not- stable at launch and is only now after -many- months of patches/tweaks stable. BFH has been stable this whole time.  Please let me know where your evidence that BF4 is more complex from a technical perspective than BFH is.

BF_Hardline,37kjg3,allinonename,1 point,Fri May 29 12:34:50 2015 UTC,It is doing well on the consoles alright. I was streaming on Twitch yesterday though and there weren't that many watching Hardline so it's kind of strange.
BF_Hardline,37kjg3,nastylep,0,Fri May 29 12:55:01 2015 UTC,I just don't understand why the game is doing so well on console vs PC
BF_Hardline,37kjg3,GregoryGoose,1 point,Thu May 28 14:20:42 2015 UTC,BF4 as a whole is doing better than Hardline but when it comes to BF4 PC is nearly as strong as PS4 and stronger than XB1. I feel the PC players just stuck with BF4 and decided to wait. Got burned early by EA/Dice with constant problems with BF4 during it's launch and the more people that complain about Hardline just hurts the chances of anyone giving it a legitimate chance.

BF_Hardline,37kye1,GregoryGoose,2,Thu May 28 19:48:29 2015 UTC,"I'll echo what the two other guys said, be different and funny stunts are fine. I'm not sure how deeply that comedy well runs though. Another idea I would throw out is that with a lot of newer COD players coming in, they don't really understand basic strategy and tactics for the game. Which is to say, you see a lot of headless chicken play. That seems to be dissipating somewhat, because people are finally learning the maps but maybe something to help them with that aspect of the game. One of the earliest clips I saw of beta gameplay was just a guy on Riptide talking about how he liked to hold down an area on Riptide. He wasn't camping, he was just working that back hill behind the mansion and explaining how line of site worked for the top of the hill vs someone coming towards it. Was it funny? No. But it was addressing a basic tactic that he used for the larger strategy of holding down an area in TDM. There's a lot of videos   to be done like that. People still don't seem to understand that if you want to win Riptide in TDM you have to have snipers holding the roof and spotting for other players. Bank Job you have to take the parking lot rooftop if you want to control the bank roof too. It's just basic strategy discussions but nobody really does them for this game except for LevelCap maybe. And I don't think he's too keen on the game anymore.   Also, with the new DLC you'll have a chance to examine the new maps and guns so that would be good too. These are just a couple of ideas. Maybe you hate talking strategy and tactics so that's not a good fit for you though. I just know we don't need another StoneMountan 360 no scope teabag fest channel because that gets old quick."

BF_Hardline,37fedr,BillyHoWCR,-1,Wed May 27 06:03:07 2015 UTC,"Yes, the mask is on a manikin.  The video did make an odd attempt at revealing that lit up mask though, it zoomed up and paused for a moment when showing it. Like it was meant to be noticed...it also does not look similar to anything else shown in that mall scene. So that is where my assumption came from, because we have yet to see any of the ""police headgear"" that in going to be in the first DLC.   The wolf masks seems a tad different than in game, but it may be how it renders differently in game.  But this is the second time they have shown the gorilla and bunny. First time was in the announcement photo for dlc, and now this time which is in the DLC release video.  Either way, I'm praying the new maps are epic, and that they fix the TDM spawns.   NEW VEHICLES TOO?  I know one is a pimped out Lincoln or similar, and it has hydraulics. lol"
BF_Hardline,37fedr,ecchinl,0,Wed May 27 07:13:49 2015 UTC,Main issue I see with wolf mask is that when I see them in game they do not have the hoody. From behind they actually even look like pigs... which I thought was funny.

BF_Hardline,37dh8u,nightbass,16,Tue May 26 20:48:28 2015 UTC,You know what I totally forgot about this until right now. These features are gonna take as long as it did for Rockstar to add heists to GTA
BF_Hardline,37dh8u,cornbreadsloth,2,Tue May 26 21:40:45 2015 UTC,Difference being that Heists were free - This we are paying for. And considering player count is dropping fast I want it now so I can at least play with it for a little while.
BF_Hardline,37dh8u,ZeroBANG,5,Wed May 27 21:13:08 2015 UTC,and how did Origin react to that?
BF_Hardline,37dh8u,dwalters215,5,Wed May 27 09:32:23 2015 UTC,I just submitted an inquiry to AMEX.  Kind of brilliant.
BF_Hardline,37dh8u,P33KAJ3W,4,Wed May 27 13:50:08 2015 UTC,What happened after that?

BF_Hardline,37dh8u,MangoEmperor,3,Tue May 26 21:14:35 2015 UTC,"Noooo, you paid for access to these features in which details were advertised to come at a later date...they have to tell you that when they actually flesh out the details of them, currently they are working on balancing the game and patching various bugs and glitches. The dev on this sub has already said that they dont have the details fleshed out yet and doesn't have the authority to talk about those features..."

BF_Hardline,37dh8u,Raz0rLight,6,Thu May 28 13:24:40 2015 UTC,"Premium only competitive? Get fucked. The competitive scene for this game was dead before it existed, and there goes the last nail in the coffin."
BF_Hardline,37dh8u,Charles_Yuen,2,Fri May 29 04:28:22 2015 UTC,Technically it was the first nail
BF_Hardline,37dh8u,demonlag,1 point,Wed May 27 03:27:54 2015 UTC,"Must have offended someone to earn down votes.  Dice/Visceral/EA seem to think if they just keep jamming ""Competitive 5 vs 5!!!!"" at people suddenly the game will have a competitive scene.  BF4 has a higher PC population, PC gamers are more ""OMG hardcore competing and CS:GO!"", and no one gives one shit about Defuse, and that doesn't even require premium.    Restricting the most unpopular style of play to an extremely limited set of players just sounds counter productive to me."
BF_Hardline,37dh8u,Raz0rLight,2,Wed May 27 08:54:03 2015 UTC,"I think the down votes are from 2 things. I said final nail, when this is old new I just bothered to find out. And people blindly defending the franchise.  Here's the truth. Battlefield hasnt been truly competitively viable since bf2.  I've competed in the Aussie scene for bf3 and 4, playing cybergamer ladders, as well as ESL tournaments, and I would hope I know a smidgen of what I'm talking about.  A game that balances off of the casual masses, can never be truly competitive. As soon as you make it casual and easy, it becomes accessible, but there is less of a skill divide as a result. They add dumbfire weapons because it let's your average casual player enjoy them self. In result, it let's anyone kill anybody, with the person on the receiving end being able to do fuck all about it. It can't be countered by skill, and it doesn't take much skill to administer it. A good fps has a counter system, which builds advantages, and disadvantages in certain areas and play styles to make said choice effective, yet balanced. This results is strategic reactions, or extreme player skill to overcome the weaknesses. This further builds upon skill. And there are just too many counter all strategies, that can't be dealt with by responding with skill.  Pandering to the masses kills the viability and consistency because your average player is anything but consistent, and barely knows how to play the game, and certainly doesn't know the nuances. In Australia, battlefeild is a random fuck fest of explosives, smoke, incendiaries, and supression. Put all that in place, and how the fuck do you counter being killed by a claymore, being unable to see, (yet others can just because of a sight choice) and being unable to hit a damn thing, even when you know you can out aim, and out maneuver your opponent, if not for this funnel of a hallway which is the only available route, and if it isn't, every other angle is the same.  In the end, fuck this. I'm going back to a game that scales with me, somewhere that individual and team skill is valued, and you actually get better at using it. In short, I'm fucking off back to csgo."
BF_Hardline,37dh8u,crawlerz2468,4,Thu May 28 03:07:10 2015 UTC,"without a doubt terrible features the lot of them. masks? gimmicks for babies basically. gun bench? nonsense, more or less useless with the crappy purple neon zebra skins that we already have. track kills per weapon? so.... battlelog? what exactly would I be paying for here? competitive play limited to premiums? one of the worst decisions in Hardline's lifecycle. legendary status aka prestige? isn't this a cod thing?

BF_Hardline,37dh8u,nutcrackr,1 point,Thu May 28 03:29:48 2015 UTC,"Be nice to have a estimate of when they are coming at least. Legendary surely would not be hard to do.  As with previous BF games, the patching system seems such a headache so they just want to package it all together with DLCs. I suspect gun bench/competitive was not ready so we need to wait until the next DLC drop."

BF_Hardline,37dh8u,thejellythatwobbled,6,Wed May 27 02:53:36 2015 UTC,Yes absolutely.

BF_Hardline,37dh8u,demonlag,1 point,Wed May 27 15:55:26 2015 UTC,"I think what he meant was the fact that most are so impatient that they would rather play unfinished games rather than wait extra time for them to be finished. Not saying this game was unfinished but you do have to feel for the people who paid into premium and have received 3 Gold battlepacks (2 of which before they even fixed battlepacks) and a few double xp weekends for their 50$.  Look on steam at the entire industry of games popping up with ""early access"" which in many cases people have paid into a game for it to never be completed, while the small dev teams who never thought the game would get to such levels decide to take the profits and quit working on the game."
BF_Hardline,37dh8u,demonlag,1 point,Wed May 27 16:14:33 2015 UTC,"I also am Premium, but you have to realize that most of those benefits are in being able to access the new DLC levels for free and early, are they not? And it's not unusual for that to take a few months."
BF_Hardline,37dh8u,tentoesup747,1 point,Wed May 27 16:19:58 2015 UTC,"Fair enough, but if you look at it that way, then you are basically buying stock in the game that it doesn't fail/die or you just get completely bored of it during that time it takes to release those said DLC.  I personally don't buy them mainly because by the time the 3rd, 4th, ect DLC's come out, I have moved on to other games as have the people that I play with and therefore don't get the value. I'd much rather just pay the 15$ for each one and see it as a continued investment in a game I continue to play.  Edit: I'd really be curious to see the numbers of past games (CoD/BF) numbers on premium accounts sold compared to actual downloads, just to see how many buy them and don't even use it when the new DLC options hit."

BF_Hardline,37h4bx,Kanobii,2,Wed May 27 20:00:06 2015 UTC,My best game was 130-35 in TDM it was a 1600 ticket game though haha
BF_Hardline,37h4bx,contentBat,3,Wed May 27 20:08:39 2015 UTC,93 kills and your team still lost by 100+ tickets. You do know the point of Conquest?
BF_Hardline,37h4bx,contentBat,1 point,Wed May 27 20:53:25 2015 UTC,"So with 31 other players on the team, I'm the reason why we lost? Cool.   I had an SMG. My goal was to use my guns CQB dominance by staying inside (the most heavily populated area in the map). I did my part for the team. I killed people of the flag and helped cap the flag at times. My stats/kills/points show this as well.  Killing people off the flag and around them is just as important as taking a flag."
BF_Hardline,37h4bx,contentBat,0,Wed May 27 22:27:47 2015 UTC,"Killing people in conquest is pointless if they still control the objectives. They can bleed tickets far faster then you can by just killing on/off the flag. It's about as useful as that sniper sitting 300M away from any action.   For the whole game they held 2 objectives for the majority and recaptured almost instantly after your team took one.   I mean you had a hacker on your team, and you still lost. Looks more like the majority of your team thought they were playing TDM.   So yea, it's an ok number of kills when you normalise it vs your team (32 players on a small map is going to generate a large kill count). But again, that sort of place style just pisses your team off when playing conquest."

BF_Hardline,37fxtt,Cramer02,1 point,Wed May 27 17:20:43 2015 UTC,"Seeing how easy it is to destroy vehicles in this game, it's doesn't make that much of a difference if you have the repair tool or not. A couple of Stinger shells to a chopper, one or two RPG rockets to any land vehicle and one SMAW rocket to litterally anything is all it takes.  Conclusion: The repair tool isn't that useful in BFH."
BF_Hardline,37fxtt,SplitVision,3,Wed May 27 12:30:43 2015 UTC,"Not really, the repair tool might not be that powerful against RPGs or smaws but it is very useful against tubes or gunfire. In fact if people don't go for the rpg in Hotwire I'm much more likely to survive in the car repairing than without.  The problem is that the repair tool is still not worth using when you can play selfish and use armour."
BF_Hardline,37fxtt,brontesaur,0,Wed May 27 13:10:47 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure whether you forgot that RPG's and Stingers can be added to Sedans and Coupes. They spawn at a fairly fast rate, which makes them incredibly easy to access, which in turn makes the repair tool (almost) obsolete. It still has uses, but it's not useful enough to consider over other gadgets. Unless you're playing with relatively smart and skilled friends riding around in armored trucks and/or choppers, ofcourse."
BF_Hardline,37fxtt,SplitVision,1 point,Wed May 27 13:27:11 2015 UTC,"No I didn't, but like I said there's been plenty of hotwire games where rpgs weren't commonly seen, boot or battle pickup. In those games tubes or gunfire were the most common and the repair tool will definitely help you out there. That's not including chopper repair teams of course, they're especially devastating on Hollywood heights where there's only 1 stinger pickup.   I'd say that if armour didn't exist then repair tool would definitely be a must have on hotwire or other modes with vehicles."
BF_Hardline,37fxtt,brontesaur,1 point,Wed May 27 15:31:42 2015 UTC,I'd love it if the mechanic would become a target of the same value true mechanic instead of the juggernaut.

BF_Hardline,37fxtt,SplitVision,1 point,Wed May 27 16:21:01 2015 UTC,"I have, extensively. What my experience is telling me is that, unless I'm playing with people I know, the repair tool isn't going to be that helpful. 95% of the players I play with/against can't drive or fly any vehicle properly, which means they'll either get killed, or kill themselves, with vehicles (most noticeably choppers) regardless of whether I decide to whip out the repair tool or not.  I'm not saying it's useless. I'm saying it's not as useful as it could've been, due to how easy it is to destroy vehicles. The only time the repair tool will make one hell of a difference is when you've only got one enemy trying to take out the vehicle you're in.  But, that's all according to my personal experiences. Perhaps it's a console thing. Oh well."
BF_Hardline,37fxtt,Chippy569,0,Wed May 27 19:20:05 2015 UTC,"giving up your repair tool or grenade launcher, which imo puts you at a big disadvantage.   hardly... unless you're playing a gamemode specifically where you are supporting a vehicle.

BF_Hardline,37fxtt,Johnny_C13,3,Wed May 27 17:52:28 2015 UTC,Insert that reduces damage by 50%... Too much?  Needle or defibrillator that instantly revives dead teammates.. Ok.

BF_Hardline,37fxtt,Earlkay,2,Wed May 27 13:54:40 2015 UTC,auto regen takes so long and is so slow that it doesn't really have an impact on balance either way.
BF_Hardline,37fxtt,tyler2k,-2,Wed May 27 14:17:43 2015 UTC,It's just that the medic bag really is not as powerful as the armored insert even though it is a really good gadget. You can't heal when suppressed either.
BF_Hardline,37fxtt,Steevio,4,Wed May 27 15:06:47 2015 UTC,"What players who don't play Mechanic don't realize is that the Mechanic is basically a melee class that gets outclassed at anything past 15m. You need to get in your opponent's face to be a threat. I'm leveling the MP5k and that thing has ridiculous drop off. It's a cliff of pure pain, then factor in it's low clip size and long reload and you're in a world of pain engaging more than one target at near-mid range."
BF_Hardline,37fxtt,ytownohm,3,Wed May 27 16:22:53 2015 UTC,"I agree.  To me, Armored Insert + Gadget 2 gives best chance of survival against AR in mid-to-long range engagement.  I barely survive the SA-58/SCAR-H/AKM shots because the chances are, they'll get that vertical recoil headshots in and that thing hits like a TRUCK.  Obvously, Recon will go for the headshot.  In CQB engagement, Mechanics or Enforcer with Shotgun needs to shine.  Not some OP M16/M416 toting healers who thinks their panic hip fire should out gun PDW."
BF_Hardline,37fxtt,Davidoff1983,2,Wed May 27 20:52:57 2015 UTC,"Exactly, one burst from a BR due to the recoil is all it typically takes and your ass is back at the spawn screen"
BF_Hardline,37fxtt,Davidoff1983,1 point,Wed May 27 21:28:54 2015 UTC,"That is what I thought to be the developers reasoning behind this gadget too, but the revolvers are capable of dealing enough damage at range (It's what I do). The mechanic also doesn't need to participate in long range battles, he has to play differently and stick to areas where he can force close quarter battles. It would be more interesting for class diversity.  Making the armored insert a little weaker would also make the LMG battle pickups in trunks more viable, as those guns are great at longer ranges."

No more weapons to unlock no more camos,no more challenges, no Easter eggs?, that's how i feel now in hardline like there would be more content but isn't there, only more with dlcs, they really need to do what its happening in bf4 they need to add free maps or free guns, or weeks challenges like PvZGW, to really increase the players, I still play it and in PS3, can't imagine the fun in Pc or PS4One. That's my opinion bro's don't hate the game, hate the madafakas! (ea, people that doesn't play the game and talk trash about it). Hope criminal dlc bring a lot of content and people to play."

Second, an operator ran right through my door sabotage, the sabotage detonating two seconds after he opened the door, which was pointless.

I also think all of the weapons' damage models are broken because everything was designed for non-HC, but FF is the real deal breaker.  I'm fine with the no-HUD no-hitmarker stuff.  Everyone has their preference, but 32-40p is the sweet spot for me.  I can't believe how many people want to play 64p, it's just spawning into random deaths over and over.

I think another post on a similar topic suggested they also implement a match making system like Dota 2 or CSGO. If they did that, I'd definitely enjoy playing those game modes more.   That being said, I think Visceral would have to dish out for some servers like how Valve supports the Matchmaking features in their games. I don't own my own server, though I'm considering setting one up, but I wonder if there is configuration options that would basically implement what you're asking?"

If you don't want to be competitive any of the other game modes would be great for you. For those of us who want to test their tactics, aim and reflexes in a structured ladder system, the settings you asked about are perfect.  Keep in mind too, the lack of tightness isn't just on your side: all the players playing with you are playing the same game!  Maybe I'm confused but your response doesn't make sense to me.

Back on point though, I concede the user base is too small right now but if they start working on it when their user base is ready it will only come out when interest may have been lost. If they took the time to implement something small now, like something server owners could setup easily, I think there would be interest."

And yeah, just a few tweaks to the game modes would definitely make them more enjoyable.  Well, Visceral has left the competitive features for those that have paid for premium, so I'm assuming they'll have special servers for that.  And I'm pretty sure pc have better flexibility when it comes to server options, but sadly console is stuck in the dark ages."
BF_Hardline,37asz6,Dragonsmith,1 point,Wed May 27 02:56:52 2015 UTC,"Even though I agree that in a perfect word, we'd have these competitive options at launch, I also understand that the stakeholders at Visceral are ultimately who decide the priorities not the designers or programmers.

BF_Hardline,379yys,blairmichod,1 point,Tue May 26 05:21:33 2015 UTC,But how would they differentiate this from legitimate scores? Scores like that are relatively common on Hotwire.
BF_Hardline,379yys,BillyHoWCR,2,Tue May 26 23:13:33 2015 UTC,Many cases are simply being reported with video included to prove actions are being taken. While in game it is easy to see the glitch in work. Players will be actively doing nothing and still receiving a constant amount of points.   Note... data of games can also be researched and certain information (not available to users) can be reviewed to help in determining actions players made in game.   Note... most players do this in consecutive matches so seeing flagrant abuse is as easy as checking recent game activity.

BF_Hardline,378k4k,FadedGamingHD,1 point,Mon May 25 19:25:46 2015 UTC,"Completely disagree... and I have 2.1k ACW kills (http://battlelog.battlefield.com/bfh/agent/Jascool00/weapons/340262097/pc/)  ACW is great, but with its damage model, taking it outside CQB is stupid. It's a gun made for people who get headshots in CQB.. 2 shot headshot kill.  Seeing as I have 1800+ M16 and 1600+ M416 I would also disagree with your order of preference for those guns.   For versatility I would say the M16. This is comparable to the AEK in BF4. AEK at range isn't as effective as the M416 (in BF4)  Due to its higher ROF its recoil bounces a bit more.. so its less of a gun to use at range.. its more CQB suited. M16, however, can do a bit better at range due to it having a few less RPM, .025 less upwards recoil  I know the stats say otherwise, but in game the extra 50 RPM isnt worth it to me if I'm playing on a bigger map. I'd rather be accurate. http://symthic.com/bf-hardline-compare?M416_vs_M16A3  To me, the list for versatility goes:   M16A3 SA-58 OSW (fastest killing gun in the game, due to bullet velocity) M416   Also.. throwing on an angled foregrip to reduce recoil? With the little amount of recoil all these guns have and the ridiculous amount of mag dumping you can do in BFH, stubby is ALWAYS the right choice, on any gun, except DMRs."

As if the cops simply kill the criminals too quickly then it actually hurts your chances. Too many times I heard that finishing music sound... and I screamed ""No. not yet, not yet"".   Being on the criminal side is more often then not the better chance of getting points as a Hacker in Heist. The cops don't worry as much about dying and rush in for more deaths.

BF_Hardline,375ztf,BillyHoWCR,1 point,Mon May 25 05:57:58 2015 UTC,"You're right, the reason you want the cops to win is so that the game doesn't end early. The longer the game lasts, the higher your chance of getting 15000 score. Having a low population ensures that the cops won't reach 100 kills before the timer runs out.  And yes, you can get more hacker score if there is a higher population, but then you run the risk of the game ending early. You have to choose for yourself whether you want high population (fast score earning, chance of ending early) or low population (reduced score earning, reduced chance of ending early)."

BF_Hardline,373ww0,nutcrackr,0,Tue May 26 18:07:34 2015 UTC,"They'll never do it. The entire reason battlepacks exist is so they can charge real money for them.

BF_Hardline,373ww0,FalconiiLV,1 point,Mon May 25 11:54:52 2015 UTC,"Maybe, but it's also entirely possible that the abundance drives them away from spending real money on battlepacks.

BF_Hardline,373ww0,ipawilzon,1 point,Tue May 26 18:06:28 2015 UTC,"Maybe, but if they lose half the people who buy battlepacks regularly then they lose half of the continuing income from the game. For doing absolutely no work.

BF_Hardline,374n2k,SulliverVittles,10,Mon May 25 01:58:04 2015 UTC,"1250, but I do think secondary weapons should be lower. 750 maybe? That still seems challenging, but that's how it should be. It's a challenge, so when you finally get it then you should feel rewarded that you now are able to use the weapon on both sides. If it was too easy then you wouldn't feel like you accomplished anything. I personally just like it the way it is. I have only one weapon license in the SA-58, and I worked hard for it and it feels good being able to pull it out when I am a cop. Feels real good."
BF_Hardline,374n2k,XxAVG_JOExX,5,Sun May 24 21:02:12 2015 UTC,If anything I feel the numbers are backward to me. I think a cosmetic upgrade (gold camo) should be worth more. 1250 for gold and 1000 for weapon license would be good
BF_Hardline,374n2k,RICExTANK,2,Sun May 24 21:26:29 2015 UTC,500 gold and then 750 weapon licence for secondary and keep it the same for primary
BF_Hardline,374n2k,UnclePa,1 point,Sun May 24 22:26:38 2015 UTC,"I like it because it makes the most sense. Seriously though, outside of the K10 which was incredibly strong pre-nerf, is there really anything else that is unmatched side for side? Maybe M16 but the M416 doesn't feel like a subpar weapon and I'm sure there's plenty of people who prefer it.  Because otherwise I can only think of the FMG 9 and Knockout but those are already both side guns."

BF_Hardline,374n2k,A_McKinney,2,Mon May 25 19:26:13 2015 UTC,1250
BF_Hardline,374n2k,BillyHoWCR,1 point,Mon May 25 06:08:41 2015 UTC,"I would set it at 500. Now that the K10 is a little nerfed and considering that basically the 416 and M16A3 are on other sides of the fence (meaning that each side has access to a really, really good AR), I really don't see what the point is of setting the requirement at 1250. As someone who's somewhere around level 85 or 90 and has gold for all four classes (and hacker), I'm still nowhere near getting a single faction gun unlocked for the other side.   Basically, I think it has the unintended consequence of punishing people who like to try out a lot of different guns, different roles, and different game modes. Maybe 500 seems low if you're someone who mainlined the M16A3 from day one, but again, I've played the game for maybe somewhere on the order of 70+ hours and can't even fathom unlocking my favorite gun (the SA-58) for the cops.  There's a point in games where if gratification is that delayed, people give up on it (and the game as a whole) as soon as they realize it isn't in reach. Case in point for me: anything tied to the utterly broken Tier 4 reputation mechanism."
BF_Hardline,374n2k,zombieapathy,1 point,Sun May 24 23:49:09 2015 UTC,To me its crazy that you get gold before the license. Gold should be the ultimate show off to that you have completely mastered that weapon
BF_Hardline,374n2k,INFsleeper,1 point,Mon May 25 10:48:14 2015 UTC,Or get the weapon license and the Gold Plated camo at the same time (1000 kills).

BF_Hardline,374n2k,nutcrackr,1 point,Mon May 25 11:56:06 2015 UTC,"Reducing it to 1000 would be a start. I mean, that's when you get the Gold Plated camo, so why wouldn't you simultaneously get the ability to purchase the weapon license? Those extra 250 kills are what confuses me the most.  Either that, or make it 500, like mastering weapons in BF4."
BF_Hardline,374n2k,SplitVision,1 point,Mon May 25 14:33:41 2015 UTC,1500 primary. 1250 secondary.   Just kidding. I couldn't care less how many. By the time you get there you should be good enough with the other factions weapons that is doesnt matter!!!

PS4 had 50k peak players, now it's down to 33k.    Seems to me the consoles are bleeding players even worse, the game just sold better on console (i still blame the GTA5 PC release hype for the initial low numbers).    Anyway, numbers will spike again once the DLC drops... right now everyone is just waiting for something to happen with either BF4 or BFH.    In fact comparing the stats of BF4 and BFH today (on the weekend), ALL 5 Systems have higher Numbers for BF4 than for Hardline.

BF_Hardline,37308b,PoliticoG305,2,Sun May 24 14:20:18 2015 UTC,The tommygun version with the grip is not a grip screwed to the normal thompson handguard

BF_Hardline,37308b,A_McKinney,1 point,Sun May 24 16:16:59 2015 UTC,Besides I can't believe that they can't figure out a way to put the grip back on the M1A1. A screw or something should work.

BF_Hardline,36z44g,BillyHoWCR,3,Sat May 23 10:07:17 2015 UTC,Definitely one of the Hardest Syndicate requirements to get knocked out. Took me 11 games before another Hacker came in to allow me even the chance to knock this out. Prior to that was only earning about 2/3rds the needed points. (note a few hackers dropped in short periods and this guy did hack most of the game the previous match but not for long enough to get the needed points... was shy by about 2000 points in previous game.)  Now to work on the other portions... and I will wield that Gold Sledge Hammer
BF_Hardline,36z44g,MyEasyButton,1 point,Sat May 23 10:11:08 2015 UTC,"Nice work! I got my eye on this assignment, but I'll wait until I unlock the multi-kill requirement from just playing my usual CQ LG, before I turn my sights on Hacker Heist and Blood Money Heist. I know I've had one 500 bonus prior to unlocking this assignment, and it included killing myself along with four enemies.   So consider that a tip: Your own suicide counts toward the bonus.  :-)"
BF_Hardline,36z44g,ipawilzon,1 point,Sat May 23 13:32:02 2015 UTC,Remember this is near impossible without the 2XP. Main reason why I focused on it when I saw my Savior Bounty finally kick in on the Prerequisites.   The Multi Kill I don't see as a big issue. Me and Multi-kills are very familiar with each other. ;) I plan on saving it till the end though. That way I can get the Syndicate Assignment to appear during game instead of just after match results.   I just completed Operator Syndicate last night and it was so anti-climatic. I got my last revive coin just as the game ends and don't see the Assignment pop up on screen. Just get it to show in end game report. :(
BF_Hardline,36z44g,TosyV1,1 point,Sat May 23 14:03:32 2015 UTC,So consider that a tip: Your own suicide counts toward the bonus. :-)   Note I have looked through many gameplay videos of myself and my suicide in situations do not in fact add to the Multi kill total.
BF_Hardline,36z44g,blairmichod,1 point,Mon May 25 06:05:32 2015 UTC,"I had one of the best Blood Money games I had in a while just to find out that I came up 350 points short of the 30,000.. lol. I am almost there too, good luck man!  http://battlelog.battlefield.com/bfh/agent/i_-DuB-_/assignments/355409181/ps4/#sy015"
BF_Hardline,36z44g,blairmichod,0,Sat May 23 19:04:42 2015 UTC,Just went back into the game and very first Bloodmoney match got the 30K requirement. Took 2 games of Conquest and finally got it's 30K easy enough. And when I got the Conquest I also got the last Ace Squad/MVP requirement.   Funny thing is the only thing I have left is the 500 Multi kill points and thought it would be easy enough because I was a heavy Hotwire player and have taken down numerous full van loads of enemy. Now I can't find a vehicle with more then 3 people in it. ha  Oh well... guess will try and finish it up tomorrow?
BF_Hardline,36z44g,Charles_Yuen,2,Sat May 23 20:06:22 2015 UTC,"Note: just for information purposes on others trying to get this knocked out. The game prior to this I actually earned 2 more medals then in this game. The medals are a large portion of the required points needed to get this in the 15 minutes, but the thing this game that allowed me to push over the required 30K was actually each of the individual GPS spots, GPS Jamming points, destroying enemy Hacker events, and all those little individual points that add up. So if you are doing this via Hacker then be sure to use your GPS and other tools were they actually garner the most points. Spamming the buttons will get you coins but spamming them in areas where they gain you extra points is where it is at."
BF_Hardline,36z44g,Koebs,1 point,Sat May 23 13:32:06 2015 UTC,Is there any point to trying to unlock and level up? After getting all the guns I'm having a hard time caring about 2x XP at level 33
BF_Hardline,36z44g,Charles_Yuen,2,Sat May 23 11:14:08 2015 UTC,Well if you re only playing to get the guns then so be it.   So you are saying you already unlocked the 4 Syndicate Class Assignment guns?   And I will have to assume you don't care to own any of the melee weapons?   There are nearly 300 assignments to challenge yourself to get. If they or bounties don't interest you then so be it.   Points go a long way to get all the attachments for each weapon. All the upgrades for each vehicle. And purchase of Battlepacks and such. It is up to the player to determine if these things keep their interest or not?
BF_Hardline,36z44g,Charles_Yuen,2,Sat May 23 11:24:06 2015 UTC,"At level 33, it's basically impossible to have all 4."
BF_Hardline,36z44g,blairmichod,2,Sat May 23 12:29:47 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't imagine it would be, he would likely be way over level 33 by the time he got those 4 assignments completed.   It only takes 561,000 points to get level 33.   Seeing that it takes 275,000 points. Just to get a Gold Service star... it would be 1,100,000 just to get the 4 Gold stars in the prerequisites.

BF_Hardline,36z44g,blairmichod,0,Sat May 23 12:36:42 2015 UTC,"The issue is that this assignment only unlocks an cosmetic option. In contrast, some of the other syndicate weapons have advantages over the stock weapons and offer new gameplay opportunities."
BF_Hardline,372rzr,xXx420SM0K3NUGZxXx,22,Sun May 24 09:19:35 2015 UTC,"I definitely see a lot of old Battlefield players trying out hardline and complaining about their inability to react to incoming fire. I wholeheartedly agree; coming out on the winning end of a firefight without initiating is rare.  And I think that's exactly how it should be. If I let my game sense slip, or if an enemy outsmarts me, they deserve the kill on me. The game should reward not the player with the best reactions, but with the best tactical sense. If I manage to flank you, I deserve to kill you. I outsmarted you, and even though I have a worse weapon or worse aim, I should still be able to reliably take you down before you can shoot back.   You complain about needing reactions of a fighter pilot to be successful in the game. I disagree. One thing I didn't like about previous Battlefield games was that it was so forgiving towards players with a lack of tactical sense. If you were to get caught with your pants down, facing away from the enemy as they open fire on you, you still had time to turn around and kill them, given decent enough reactions.  In hardline, the low time to kill removes the reaction time from that equation. If a player gets the drop on you, you will not be able to retaliate even with the best reaction abilities. This moves the focus from good reactions, precise fine motor skills and muscle memory, towards a higher level of game sense and tactical thinking.  If you want to raise the TTK to be able to react to being fired upon, you place value in the very reactions you say that the game should not require. Hardline punishes not those with bad reactions, but those that run straight into the enemy and foolishly believe that reactions and aim will save them.  My suggestion: Re-evaluate what skills and techniques are actually rewarded in Hardline. You will find that flanking is more enjoyable, and that tactical sense and seeing the enemy before they see you is equal to free kills. Running into enemies and expecting anything but  netcode and luck to decide the winner is naive, and doesn't work for this game. Use the weapons to your advantage — e.g. if you die from SMGs, try putting yourself in situations where you engage from longer distances.  Work the game in your favor, instead of bashing your head against it and expecting the results to change just by sheer volume of repetition. There is no  definition of how a Battlefield game is supposed to play, and I wouldn't blame hardline for being the way it is.  In my opinion, the true gamer is one who can identify how they need to adapt their own set of skills to carry their success over between games."

BF_Hardline,372rzr,BillyHoWCR,7,Sun May 24 20:31:28 2015 UTC,"He is right though. Be tactical and you get used to the TTK. You don't like it simply because you play in the fashion of low TTK. You change for the game... the game doesn't change for you.  I mean really, you are bringing zero new conversation to the discussion. So why bring it up again when you say nothing new?"
BF_Hardline,372rzr,pyrozerker,2,Sun May 24 10:07:54 2015 UTC,"I get what you're saying, but I don't understand what's wrong. I've  logged about 600 hours into BF4 and countless more into its predecessors. I've also played many many hours of Tom Clancy Shooters, and as much as this shames me I have played a bit of Call of Duty back when my nuts where still growing hair.   That being said all of those games have different engagements. Rainbow Six is not a forgiving game, but it didn't take many instaneous deaths for me to figure out I was playing it wrong though. Adjust your play style, take a more tactical approach, and just overall adapt. If you'd like some tips or general help I'd be more than happy to play with you (if you have Xbox One lol)."
BF_Hardline,372rzr,TehDarkArchon,4,Sun May 24 11:02:03 2015 UTC,"I completely agree with you. I personally think the ttk is trash, especially on PC. I've watched people play on consoles and I dont think it's as big of a problem there. There are many people that prefer the lower ttk, and that's perfectly fine. I've probably said the same thing on a thousand posts, but imo a low ttk doesnt work in a game that has 3d spotting, minimap scaling, tons of audio cues, small engagement distances, and overall high damage/rof weapons. Ive been playing more cod lately, even ghosts, and the low ttk even in that doesnt bother me as much because it doesnt have all of the features aforementioned. Also keep in mind hardline features a lot of smaller maps with wide open areas near the center of action. People will argue that the lower ttk rewards tactical positioning. Fair argument. But that should not be the only skill rewarded. Things like keeping on target, aiming for vulnerable spots, choosing the right weapon for each situation, etc. matters much less in this game. To each their own i suppose. For me personally, i see the low ttk as a way to lower the skill gap and give whoever sees who first a kill, regardless of the overall ""skill"" of that person."
BF_Hardline,372rzr,brontesaur,0,Sun May 24 13:21:38 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's fair to say that lower TTK = lower skill gap, since the guy with no thumbs does not get a free kill if he spots first, he still has to aim. I'd say that the kind of skill required is similar but different rather than lower. For example, the question of aim. High ttk means you have the luxury of being able to turn on people and also take your time aiming. Whoever aims better and lands more shots on target wins. In hardline, if you and an enemy see each other at the same time, whoever is quicker will probably come out on top. It's less about perfect aim but more about faster aiming reaction time.  Also high ttk has its own disadvantages. Take for example high ttk, a guy who gets hit multiple times still has a chance to duck or run for cover, maybe throw down a medpack, and by the time you chased him down he's healed somewhat and ready for you. You no longer have the element of surprise that you had before and you're no longer guaranteed the win even though you're a better player than he is."
BF_Hardline,372rzr,nutcrackr,1 point,Sun May 24 20:29:20 2015 UTC,"I've played 90hrs so far and I am used to the TTK now. I think changing it now would be a mistake. I feel like most of the time I have enough time to react, dodge and maybe even aim back at enemies depending on the range and their weapon. There is no question that you are rewarded for being first to see targets. I think that means you have to play and position yourself differently than BF4 for example. I don't think there is anything wrong with high TTK games, but I don't think Hardline needs to be one.  Hardcore may be different with 60% health, but people seem to request that even with the current TTK. I think the damage modelling is fine for infantry at the moment in normal mode and would prefer it stay that way."

On the other hand , i do not find myself in trouble when someone is shooting at me with the rapid fire guns in BFH. I also do not have an inhuman reaction time , yet i do not face any problems in the 1 v 1 fights."

BF_Hardline,371o6i,EmotiveCDN,3,Sun May 24 01:01:29 2015 UTC,"I agree with you on some points, but I feel this is more of an EA problem than a Visceral one, because the game was essentially doomed from the start (especially on PC).   It released at a very bad time while Battlefield 4 is still in its prime, and it was already stated that it was a spinoff and the next 'proper' instalment would be coming in 2016. Not to mention Star Wars: Battlefront is coming out at the end of the year, and that looks like it'll attract a lot of people.   Also giving it the Battlefield name wasn't a great move, as they had to live up to what we expect out of Battlefield - I daresay it would've done a lot better as its own IP that can really push the cops v criminals theme, without having to include 'battlefield moments' like that tank fight in the campaign that made zero sense.  Essentially, EA saw Hardline as a quick solution to fill the console market and steal sales away from COD - nothing more, nothing less. They probably expected it would belly flop on PC, but didn't want to make it console exclusive.  And I feel sorry for the devs because of it, especially being headed by EA, and I assume developing for a console timeline (cannot push out PC patches before console because they want it to be the 'same experience' on all platforms for example). They were dealt a pretty shitty hand and they actually didnt do too bad with it.   If it released at a different time under a different set of circumstances it probably would've done a lot better, I'm a long time BF player and this is the most fun I've had to date - this sentiment is shared with most of the PC players I know. Unfortunately for Hardline, BF4 is king and PC players don't need to jump to a new game as quick as console players because a lot of us still play older titles (look at how many BF3 Players there are for example).  Now does this mean the devs are completely off the hook? No. But if the circumstances were different and they didn't have the cards stacked against them I'd probably be more upset with what they turned out."

BF_Hardline,371o6i,Mayor_S,2,Sun May 24 01:20:53 2015 UTC,"I switched from Advanced Warfare  to Hardline and it's the Call of Duty quote that is the most insulting, haha."
BF_Hardline,371o6i,blairmichod,1 point,Sun May 24 02:08:04 2015 UTC,Advanced Warfare is even more dead than Hardline.  For two weekends I attempted to find a server on PC and literally couldn't get a single game in any game mode.  The console strategy of releasing a mediocre and unsupported game simply doesn't work on the PC because there are a lot more options on PC.  To merit a AAA price and charged DLC there better be significant support in terms of patching and communication from a devteam.  There's a reason so many developers are moving away from PC as a platform or simply releasing PC ports months or years later.
BF_Hardline,371o6i,Windchilla,1 point,Sun May 24 21:05:07 2015 UTC,AW is mostly made for the Xbox One and 2/3 Call of Dity devs are not all that good at PC ports so it's left to Treyarch. BO3 should do wonders in the PC department.

This is the most polarizing Call of Duty ever.   I have been playing Call of Duty since CoD 2 and am prestige 26 in AW. I have led a diamond division clan since Ghosts. The game is objectively worse than previous entrants in the series and, worse yet, many of the issues are easily resolvable.   I play Call of Duty extensively and say all the above because I am genuinely saddened by how terrible the latest game is and I hope Black Ops 3 can salvage the series."

SHG isn't the best dev but they have some good ideas and the Exo mechanic is fantastic, the movement feels so natural and fast.  I've been playing Call of Duty since the demo on PC in the early 00's."
BF_Hardline,371o6i,meowmeowsss,1 point,Mon May 25 02:18:17 2015 UTC,"Not sure why you think AW is bringing in new people. The game sold worse than any recent CoD and died faster. The game is dead on PC and is close to dead on consoles (more people play Ghosts on consoles!).   The new exo movement is indeed amazing. Sledgehammer's problem is great and wonderful ideas but terrible execution. I love the exos and other shooter feel stupendously slow without them.  The issue is the maps and the spawns. Every map should have been like Atlas Gorge. Damn, that map us amazing. Instead, we have close quarters maps that would have been too small even in previous games.   Making Gorge the preorder bonus was criminal and did serious damage to this game.   Treyarch took two CoDs before making a good one, so maybe the same will be true of Sledgehammer."

BF_Hardline,36z36d,BillyHoWCR,3,Sat May 23 10:20:48 2015 UTC,Huh? This is not the full game. It's an upgrade for the Standard Edition.
BF_Hardline,36z36d,BillyHoWCR,-2,Sat May 23 10:22:53 2015 UTC,I miss-read your post then. First reading it appeared to come across to me you were talking about getting an upgraded full Digital Deluxe version for just 20€. (have no clue what € is but figured it was a value more then $)  edit: but now reading it again. you still can't complain about getting a cheaper deal previously (is that what you are trying to show?) when you purchased items as a single package. That is just the way they sell things right? Buy a larger quantity and you pay less... buy bits and pieces at a time and pay more.
BF_Hardline,36z36d,spangyo,1 point,Sat May 23 10:29:43 2015 UTC,This game is quickly losing players on all platforms. Offering an upgrade for double the original price is not the way to entice your current player base.

Also, try to join the squad (preferably one that has only one spot left) where the hacker is showing the most love and where they are PTFO'ing as the hacker will set point of interest and you get extra points for completing them. Just the little things. But having a good squad that PTFO's is the key IMO as you will always be spawning near an objective and will get points quicker. Good luck man but I found that once you get to about the 6 million mark then it seems to go easier because you are over 1/2 way there. :D"

BF_Hardline,36yryc,Mayor_S,1 point,Sat May 23 08:59:35 2015 UTC,Burst fire for better accuracy. Some of the weapons in this game have some pretty intense recoil. If you spray and pray you're going to miss and die.

BF_Hardline,3703oz,Joppe84,3,Sat May 23 16:48:45 2015 UTC,"Well if it makes you feel better I dumped CoD Advanced Warfare and paid $30 for Hardline on Amazon. I think highly competitive people play so often and will always pick out faults in games when we're not successful enough. To be honest, a lot of games just aren't that fun when you've done everything there is to do. I'm so happy I purchased Hardline because it's a fresh experience."
BF_Hardline,3703oz,SpYf3R,2,Sat May 23 17:13:26 2015 UTC,"Expect downvotes for your post, but I have to agree with your point.  Thing is, every weapon in a multiplayer FPS needs to have downsides as well as strengths. There are no tangible downsides to X16 assault rifles - with those you get high damage, high accuracy, fast reload, decent magazine size and high rate of fire.   They are EXTREMELY easy to use. I usually roll with either an AKM,  AKS74u or battle rifle. I'm pretty decent at using them, considering their high recoil and slow rates of fire. However, when I occasionally pick up an X16 assault rifle my K/D (as a crude measure of effectiveness) goes up by at least 50%.   With an M16 or M416, you never have to think about what kind of opponents you are facing, or at what range. Just full auto spam fire away, like 70% of every player you face off with does.   Enjoyment for me equals putting my skills to the test, but with the two mentioned ARs the skill required to get a kill is much less."
BF_Hardline,3703oz,posts_while_naked,2,Sat May 23 20:11:12 2015 UTC,"Good post. I don't care about downvotes. I just wanted this game to be everything it had potential to be, or has potential to be.  They did so much right by not opting for one shot kill with AWM magnum rounds. I knew it was a part of beta and a lot of old CS snipers wanted that stuff. But then they go full retard and make the AR's completely ridiculous. Like you say - no down side at all."
BF_Hardline,3703oz,Paventare,1 point,Sat May 23 21:46:47 2015 UTC,"I haven't really played as well. Not because of weapon balance though, but because of the lack of content."
BF_Hardline,3703oz,PraeteritaCautus,1 point,Sun May 24 20:09:10 2015 UTC,"I'm going to be honest, you are complaining about a lack of weapon balance primarily out of a lack of skill. The M16A3 and the M416 are jokes; if you can aim, an ARM will beat them at distance, an AKM will beat them up close, the AKS-74U is a more versatile weapon even if it hits like a pea-shooter, and this last one is personal bias given my 2988 kills with it - the G36C is all-round the best assault rifle, especially given you can still kill 50 meters away using a suppressor with relative ease.  The guns aren't balanced, sure. But it is nowhere near as bad as you are making out. Hell even the M/45 and Uzi seem like garbage until you use them for a while (weapon license for both), at which point you learn their strengths* and start thinking they are overpowered.  *Get close and hip fire with the M/45, tap-fire the Uzi unless you are close enough to kiss the other fellow.   Considering I have the weapon license for the G36C, AKS-74U, MPX, M/45, Uzi, and P90 - and only a few kills away from getting the M416 weapon license - I reckon I have a fair grasp of weapons and whether they are balanced. Statistics are rubbished by experience, and I'll tell you this - once I get the license, I wouldn't use the M416 even if you paid me; as for the M16A3, you can keep the damn license, that gun is nasty."
BF_Hardline,3703oz,PraeteritaCautus,1 point,Tue May 26 12:47:54 2015 UTC,That's not correct. You will lose in all those situations if the person holding the M16 has the equivalent aim skill as you.

BF_Hardline,36x3ye,xDisturbed13,2,Fri May 22 21:01:13 2015 UTC,I got that when trying to buy a muzzle attachment in game yesterday. Tried again 2 seconds later at it worked. I'd say give it a few and try again later.
BF_Hardline,36xrvm,Psyhawk556,-1,Sat May 23 00:19:41 2015 UTC,Edited some clips together this morning that I've accumulated over the past couple months. Hope you like. Some good stuff in there I think. Nothing too special.
BF_Hardline,36xrvm,BillyHoWCR,3,Sat May 23 00:21:52 2015 UTC,Nothing too special.   So why then label it as Epic? Do you not see the conflict in your title and what is actually offered?
BF_Hardline,36wy0c,Weinapple,4,Fri May 22 20:16:17 2015 UTC,"On PS4:   I think Hardline is worth 40 bucks all day. Its something different than the very tired military theme, its smaller than the traditional BF games (map size) so it feels less floaty, while still being larger than COD maps.   The single player is the best one I have played (as far as these games go)."
BF_Hardline,36wy0c,ap66crush,3,Fri May 22 21:20:59 2015 UTC,Im glad that it took a change from the usual military style. As far as maps ive seen some of them and the seem decent. I've also seen the single player and it seems good for this type of game.
BF_Hardline,36wy0c,RuthlessDickTater,2,Fri May 22 21:26:42 2015 UTC,BFH is just plain fun. It's a blast. I'd recommend it.
BF_Hardline,36wy0c,labelsk8er85,2,Fri May 22 21:48:31 2015 UTC,"if you are on PS4, check out the online sales.  BF4+premium is on for something like 30 bucks."

BF_Hardline,36wy0c,demonlag,1 point,Fri May 22 21:25:20 2015 UTC,Depends on the type of battlefield player you are.  If you prefer the fast-paced infantry type maps then I would definitely get BFH.  If you are pretty hardcore about the military stuff then I would get BF4 premium as there will be a ton of content.  But they are pretty different games and it just depends on the type of fan you are.
BF_Hardline,36wy0c,sgt_anderson,1 point,Fri May 22 23:38:26 2015 UTC,"I just want to clarify that it is NOT a cops and robbers game.  It is a run and gun war game that plays pretty much exactly like any other Battlefield, except instead of military outfits you were a police jacket or a bandana.    I don't think I've ever seen a news story that a bunch of criminals robbed a bank using sniper rifles and Molotov cocktails, and I don't think the police have ever RPG'd a getaway car.    Even the single player campaign is about as far away from being a ""cop game"" as possible, letting you just run around with an assault rifle shooting people, because cops totally do that too.    As far as a Battlefield game, the problems I currently have are: Weapons are horrible unbalanced Uses ""old"" network code from a few BF4 patches ago, which is made even worse by everyone running around with a 1200 RPM gun Game modes other than conquest are pretty dead, and I already have BF4 and five expansions worth of conquest to play."
BF_Hardline,36wy0c,ZippyDoozy,0,Sat May 23 04:54:19 2015 UTC,"Just in my honest opinion,and I am pretty sure there are gonna be some fans who try ripping me for saying it.But Hardline isn't worth buying right now,in its current state there are still some furious bugs that need to be fix.I would say if someone was gonna sell it to you for $30-40,then by all means go ahead and get it.But don't sell out $60 for it,as this game isn't not worth $60."
BF_Hardline,36wuwg,Bizarh1,1 point,Fri May 22 19:53:59 2015 UTC,As long as when combining they don't equal the rare 200% boosts and max out at 100% I would be ok with that. So the simple doubling up for the smaller denominations sounds good.
BF_Hardline,36wuwg,BillyHoWCR,1 point,Sat May 23 04:40:27 2015 UTC,Yeah thats what i was thinking too. Not doing the 200% would be a good thing to stop it being a tad OP
BF_Hardline,36wuwg,blairmichod,3,Sat May 23 07:37:32 2015 UTC,"It would be balanced if it required more boosters versus just two.   For example, if you needed four for the next level, it would be four 25%s for one 50%, then four of those, etc. That means you would need 32 25% boosters to make one 200% booster. That seems fair to me!"
BF_Hardline,36wuwg,GregoryGoose,1 point,Sat May 23 08:00:58 2015 UTC,"They should make it so that 3 50s is 100, just to balance."

BF_Hardline,36xyi7,fletch420man,2,Sat May 23 14:02:11 2015 UTC,I'd be surprised if anyone actually gets punished for this especially since its been long established that boosting is the only real practical way to get syndicates  (And no I dont boost and I dont have any syndicate assignments unlocked)
BF_Hardline,36xyi7,AssaultPlazma,0,Sat May 23 03:22:27 2015 UTC,"especially since its been long established that boosting is the only real practical way to get syndicates   I have 6 unlocked already currently working on 7 and 8. Did not require boosting to be done. Tier 4 consisted of simply playing Hotwire at times on my own, having randoms rep Tier me as hacker, and having a friend rep Tier me. All acceptable non-boosting methods.   Yes some might be harder then others. And some near impossible. but it doesn't mean we simply have to stoop to boosting... if you need to boost then so be it. Just don't effect others and don't create servers simply to promote it. It is against the rules... so possibilities are that you can lose all progress you boosted towards.   I don't need to rob a bank to earn money, regardless of how life has made it so difficult to earn money these days.   Devs said they are fixing some assignments and I can wait or simply trudge along and try to do them as difficult as they are now."

BF_Hardline,36xyi7,blairmichod,2,Sat May 23 08:02:52 2015 UTC,yes the confirmed it in the next patch I believe Tier 4 is dropping from 11K down to 6K?
BF_Hardline,36xyi7,AssaultPlazma,1 point,Sat May 23 16:08:18 2015 UTC,"Oh, just reducing the amount needed to raise reputation? That's something, but not what I personally struggled with. With a good squad and a good hacker, maxing reputation is not an issue. And, of course, you don't even need that if you just play Hotwire."
BF_Hardline,36xyi7,blairmichod,2,Sat May 23 21:15:48 2015 UTC,getting shot with a ballistic shield will also yield more points. Will still probably have to boost it though
BF_Hardline,36xyi7,AssaultPlazma,1 point,Sat May 23 21:28:11 2015 UTC,"Oh, that's another hard one! I'm glad to hear it. As is, you need the whole enemy team to shoot you for the whole round."
BF_Hardline,36xyi7,blairmichod,1 point,Sat May 23 21:43:51 2015 UTC,Playing Commander mode with 2xp is almost as effective as boosting anyway in terms if xp. I feel like progress is worthless in this game anyway.

BF_Hardline,36xyi7,blairmichod,1 point,Sat May 23 21:17:54 2015 UTC,"I can understand how it would be upsetting to some. At the same time there is really no harm to anyone. The guns unlocked by doing the syndicate challenges aren't superior to other guns purchased in the game, so its not like they are getting a leg up on you. Also there really is no benefit to being a higher level in-game, which is the only other reason for boosting.  I am a bit behind on the patch notes as I've become a bit bored and most of my free time is on other games, so I am not completely up to date, but the Devs stated early on that the reputation system needed to be reworked. This can be taken by many as that it was broken from the beginning and if they don't have a friend willing to play hacker, which many find boring, then how else are they to unlock those guns?   IMO, if someone wants to driver around in a car for 10 (40 for all four guns) full time limit games to unlock a gun that isn't even that great, all the power to them, have fun..."
BF_Hardline,36xyi7,spoiLs7,-1,Sat May 23 03:24:09 2015 UTC,At the same time there is really no harm to anyone.   Maybe not as much in the new generation of systems where player count is high. But in other systems where player count is low it reduces greatly the populated servers that are actually playing instead of boosting.   And even on new generation system if these boosting servers are in the quick match settings then they need to be changed so they do not allow randoms to simply be tossed into a game to find out everyone is boosting. The quickmatch is not for boosting so servers that are setup to allow quickmatch (for reasons of populating their servers) need to be ended.
BF_Hardline,36xyi7,BillyHoWCR,1 point,Sat May 23 04:34:30 2015 UTC,"You know you have first world problems when 1/10 matches, you might have to quit out and join a new lobby...  There are bigger problems with the game the devs need to focus on before looking at players boosting/boosting servers. Besides, these people with these servers on PS4/XB1 are actually paying more money for the game by buying these servers, I can't actually see the devs taking these servers down."
BF_Hardline,36xyi7,spoiLs7,-1,Sat May 23 12:59:00 2015 UTC,You know you have first world problems when...   Or maybe when your problems consist of video game issues? You think?   these people with these servers on PS4/XB1   Obviously you missed my main point when the other 3 systems are the ones that will be most effected due to their already diminished playable server count.   I can't actually see the devs taking these servers down.   Why not? They did frequently on other BF games. Usually a warning and then if the changes weren't made to fix server settings then the servers simply removed. Did not phase Devs at all because they did not return any money.
BF_Hardline,36xyi7,BillyHoWCR,1 point,Sat May 23 13:11:39 2015 UTC,"Player count is who's fault? Not the consumers playing the game, thats for sure. If thats the way people want to play the game then let them? Why stop a fraction of the already small player base on PC/360/PS3?   Really doesn't seem that complicated to work around...I'm not sure why anyone would be using quick match on these systems anyway? If theres so few options for full servers then server browser seems pretty easy to me."
BF_Hardline,36xyi7,spoiLs7,0,Sat May 23 13:31:21 2015 UTC,"Why stop a fraction of the already small player base on PC/360/PS3?   Well first off because it is against the rules. And secondly because it promotes gameplay that is counter to normal gameplay.   People selling drugs on my street doesn't effect me if I don't purchase drugs right? Wrong. Everything effects everyone. Even in games.   Get over it... you are just another booster supporter and likely can't see past the idea that you can't cheat without possibly getting reset.   I hope all these boosters get reset. If you are one of them then hope you are the first.   Really doesn't seem that complicated to work around...I'm not sure why anyone would be using quick match on these systems anyway?   So because you don't use it means that others use of it is immaterial to the issue? I know the only real issue I had with it personally was when using it while Squaded up. Because the only option is Quick Match while using that with friends. Much harder to get into a game on the same team if not using at function with friends, too often someone gets put on the other team otherwise."
BF_Hardline,36xyi7,BillyHoWCR,2,Sat May 23 14:12:02 2015 UTC,"Do you even play this game? You spend enough time posting this subreddit...  First off, I have never boosted in this game, and its clearly not that I support boosting I just could care less about people doing it, not that it matters... Besides, where are these rules that are posted you can't do this? If the devs have strict rules, then they need to be posted somewhere clear, yet the only thing you can find on the shitty hardline website is pictures and snaps of good reviews of the game, and I tried googling and found nothing. If your rules cannot be found, they usually won't be followed. Secondly, you are comparing driving in circles in a video game to buying drugs, I'm not even going to bother touching that because I think you could have come up with a better arguement than that.  The only issue about not using quick match is playing with buddies, but come on... its not that hard. Countless times playing with 2 other buddies on xbox one, we joined through server browser so our squad wouldn't be stuck to private, but its not a difficult work around.   My whole point to the OP is who cares if someone else is boosting? I mean you don't even get a cookie at level 150, and its not like even if this game had any shred of competitive play, even then, 150 would give you no advantage.   Billy I guess my question to you is... why are you so mad about people boosting? It's not like they get anything special when they unlock a gun or get to 150, there is no competitive advantage besides wearing a stupid mask that takes away a device you can use?  If your neighbor had a cable black box, you seem like the kind of guy to report them, even though it doesn't even effect you."
BF_Hardline,36xyi7,spoiLs7,1 point,Sun May 24 14:08:05 2015 UTC,"Do you even play this game? You spend enough time posting this subreddit...   Time 218:06:41   If your rules cannot be found, they usually won't be followed.   Why do people always say they need to be shown the rules that they know are already in place? Just like most every other game you simply look at the bottom of the webpage for the Rules of Conduct.   Secondly, you are comparing driving in circles in a video game to buying drugs,   Doing no such thing as driving in circles can still be at least somewhat associated to playing the objective of Hotwire. Though not a smart one. The drug reference was the easiest semblance of doing something wrong that I figured anyone with at least a bit of moral compass could agree on.    ...but its not a difficult work around.   Why should the masses have to work around is the question? Why should we not be able to functionally use an aspect of the game that is available? Why should it be considered simply our need to bend to the boosting lobbies in such a fashion? Your argument just doesn't make sense.   My whole point to the OP is who cares if someone else is boosting?   And your point is lost because you dismiss mine and others points of how boosters do in fact hurt our gameplay. As if our points are lesser then the so called boosters freedom to inundate their style of non-cooperative play into our own game play.    Billy I guess my question to you is... why are you so mad about people boosting?   See the point isn't an individual care about people boosting. It is a systemic issue that promotes others to act in same fashion and brings down the entire gameplay because of it.   Especially so when the population dwindles and it is harder to find populated servers. Then the boosters become even more so noticeable... as they are  more often then not effecting a larger percentage of the available servers played on.    It's not like they get anything special when they unlock a gun or get to 150, there is no competitive advantage besides wearing a stupid mask that takes away a device you can use?   Do you even play? Neither unlocking guns nor reaching 150 gets you the mask you talk of. And then you talk as if people challenging themselves by peacocking and using one less gadget is the real issue? You are incredulous.... ha   If your neighbor had a cable black box, you seem like the kind of guy to report them, even though it doesn't even effect you.   Why would I report them? I have 2 black boxes in my home that the cable company set-up. Why would that be an issue if the neighbor had the same?  Now, if my neighbor was bleeding my line so my reception was poorer then that would be a closer example of what is happening in game with boosters.   If my neighbor was drinking and partying every night to the point of being so loud I could not even enjoy my own TV... well then I would talk to him and if it didn't change then yep... he would be reported to the proper authorities for disturbing the peace.   If you want to support boosters. Then so be it... but you won't get any love from anyone but the other boosters (which are very prolific on this subreddit) because others just don't feel we have to live with the kind of annoyances they bring to our game each day."
BF_Hardline,36xyi7,BillyHoWCR,1 point,Mon May 25 05:43:32 2015 UTC,"Well, I'm glad you wrote an entire book and made a point to wait a day to prove you play the game.   I'm not even going to bother going over each point. Once again all I will say is that there is NO benefit to gaining the four syndicate weapons or gaining 150, so therefore it shouldn't effect you. I'm still waiting to see how you feel this prevents you from playing normally when playing against a 150 or someone with the knockout, ARM, ect. The only time I possibly see it being a problem is if you join a boost lobby through quick match. Even then, why not just piss them off and kill them anyway possible? I just feel like you like to get peoples blood boiling, so there is your chance...  Also when I said black box, I guess I am aging myself a bit... People used to use ""black boxes"" to get illegal cable from the TV companies. I was not talking about color. You may have had two setup by the cable company but I assure you that unless you knew someone who worked for said cable company, they would not setup what I was refferring to. So what I meant for example, was a few weeks ago when your neighbor is bragging he gets to watch the Mayweather-Pacquiao fight for free, I feel like the first thing you would do is call the cable company. Does that really effect you?    What it all boils down to I think is that you are just upset people are working around the shortfalls of the game... People don't want to wait 2 months for things that should have been caught in beta, and if not then, fixed within the first few weeks of release. Tomorrow marks 10 weeks since release, and there has been one patch that didn't touch half the stuff people wanted fixed... people are bored and tired of waiting for things to get fixed and I don't blame them. It also doesn't help that there is such a lack of communication from the devs over the direction they plan to take this game. I feel even worse for the premium members... I guess I have learned my lesson in the past buying EA games cough cough...simcity 5."
BF_Hardline,36xyi7,spoiLs7,1 point,Mon May 25 16:04:00 2015 UTC,"Well, I'm glad you wrote an entire book and made a point to wait a day to prove you play the game.   You must think everyone is in your time zone? And my need to prove myself was never in question. It was your need to think you had some idea of who I was. When I never hide my information and it can be easily looked up wit a simple search. As for writing an entire book? I simply answered your issues directly so you could possibly come to the realization that you are totally misdirected in this conversation... but I can see no matter what is said that you keep thinking this is some how about someone getting an advantage in game when it has nothing to do with that at all.   Once again all I will say is that there is NO benefit to gaining the four syndicate weapons or gaining 150, so therefore it shouldn't effect you.   see above.   Also when I said black box, I guess I am aging myself a bit...   Seeing that I am 50 years old... pretty sure the age has little to do with your description as being less then proper in identifying what you mean and/or meant.    a few weeks ago when your neighbor is bragging he gets to watch the Mayweather-Pacquiao fight for free, I feel like the first thing you would do is call the cable company.    Was not my neighbor... it was everyone. We all got to see the fight for free... as it was broadcast across normal channels as it always is. It simply was delayed slightly... so your attempt at trying to bring another great allegory about the situation fell flat.   What it all boils down to I think is that you are just upset people are working around the shortfalls of the game...    Again... you have simply either been deaf or care not to listen at all? My issue simply is that boosters (while boosting) are taking away a quantitative number of populated servers simply so people can gain some worth without playing the game itself. Players that might not normally even fall into the trappings of boosting if not for others here on the subreddit that push for such boosting on a regular basis. And then those like you who support their efforts as if they are doing nothing wrong.   And even when not falling into the traps of a boosting lobby/server they are found to be migrating into regular servers and boosting in the middle of games others are trying to have a competitive match in. That would simply equate little different then having a soccer match and seeing 2 wing players out in a corner choosing not to participate in the match and instead sit and do nothing wile texting on their cellphones. Which yes... is totally different then someone simply doing poorly but trying to at least play the game.     Lastly... your thoughts that the patch did nothing to help even half the issues people have with the game. I can go into a large amount of explaining how you are simply wrong but it won't matter. You are just another player who thinks more of himself and believes he is the one that should dictate what should or shouldn't be fixed in the game and when. Get over yourself already. Don't like the game then get the fuck off our subreddit already.   Some of us that do like the game and are still playing it would rather talk about it instead of argue issues about boosting with someone who doesn't even appreciate the game and is simply here to complain about how they wish it was better... while justifying boosting and the reasons it is ok in any game.

BF_Hardline,36ucod,papapyro,3,Fri May 22 13:50:38 2015 UTC,Correct... but it just so happens that is exactly how much a Gold Battlepack is worth which is what we usually get for missions.  So they are at least giving us an option of buying our own Gold Battlepack with money or spend it on something else.
BF_Hardline,36thhy,idubtheman,1 point,Fri May 22 00:03:52 2015 UTC,"I agree that it is needed. But what would it balance with? BF4 balances through the Skill stat, but BFH doesn't have that.  Should it be balanced around K/D? or CPM? Or rank?"
BF_Hardline,36thhy,pp3001,1 point,Fri May 22 06:39:35 2015 UTC,"I think the best way would be the CPM. The higher your score p/m, the better you play your objective. The K/D or rank doesn't really say anything, both can be manipulated quite easy."
BF_Hardline,36thhy,Kklonne,2,Fri May 22 07:31:45 2015 UTC,"Except CPM can be easily manipulated by boosts and people playing hotwire. This would essentially mean that if you have played a lot of hotwire and used boosts you would be considered a ""good"" player because of your high CPM, and would be paired up with ""bad"" players.  I guess it's better than nothing though."
BF_Hardline,36thhy,pp3001,1 point,Fri May 22 07:46:13 2015 UTC,"I get what you're saying, but your missing one point. If they get a high CPM with hotwire, means they were PTO and not camping around with an RPG or M320.  Guess that's better than a hotwire camper with a high K/D."
BF_Hardline,36thhy,Kklonne,1 point,Fri May 22 13:12:57 2015 UTC,"Or you know, boosted on no kill servers."
BF_Hardline,36thhy,pp3001,1 point,Fri May 22 13:17:20 2015 UTC,The opposite side is when people like me play mostly rescue where the points are so low for some reason and my CPM drops.

BF_Hardline,36tcdu,LemonLimeMonster,10,Thu May 21 23:22:29 2015 UTC,The FMG9 was petty good pre-K10 nerf. The FMG9 is damn good post-K10 nerf. The FMG9 will be ridiculous post-MPX nerf.  I figure in about 2 more patches every Mechanic gun will gone and replaced with the FMG9.

BF_Hardline,36tcdu,BingeWatchingBrBa,5,Fri May 22 21:17:36 2015 UTC,I started off using the P90 but the UMP just does so much more for me. Different strokes for different folks I guess.
BF_Hardline,36tcdu,761mph,7,Fri May 22 00:08:33 2015 UTC,"I, too, like to use the UMP-45."
BF_Hardline,36tcdu,bryanl12,4,Fri May 22 00:51:08 2015 UTC,There is literally no point of using the muzzle brake instead of the heavy barrel on the UMP-45.
BF_Hardline,36tcdu,pp3001,6,Fri May 22 07:14:30 2015 UTC,MPX with extended mag.  A little less mag room but nothing like the P90's ungodly spread.
BF_Hardline,36tcdu,nerdz0r,3,Fri May 22 00:50:57 2015 UTC,"It's been my weapon of choice through BF3, BF4 and Hardline. It suits my playstyles to the ground."
BF_Hardline,36tcdu,ScottSkynet,3,Fri May 22 00:01:51 2015 UTC,p90 is a pretty good choice no doubt. It would probably be the gun I'd used the most once I have spent time with all for the mechanic class.
BF_Hardline,36tcdu,nutcrackr,5,Fri May 22 00:04:37 2015 UTC,I love having a large mag. Especially in hardline where a large mag really comes in handy.

BF_Hardline,36tvk3,XxAVG_JOExX,2,Fri May 22 04:03:00 2015 UTC,the only diff between reg and delux is a few battlepack and 3 shitty guns- fyi-
BF_Hardline,36tvk3,fletch420man,2,Fri May 22 13:26:18 2015 UTC,Isn't the deluxe cheaper than the actual game right now though ?
BF_Hardline,36tvk3,fletch420man,1 point,Fri May 22 16:33:05 2015 UTC,"It could be- I was just pointing out the difference, in case it mattered to the OP. At launch some (like me) wanted the l85a2 (i guess dreaming it would be the gun it was in BF2) so I paid the extra 10bucks for the BP's and 3 guns.....like most guns in the game they are all fucked up, shot to shot recoil opn the L85 is pure comedy. But yeah get whicheer version is cheaper as this game will have a short life (on PC anyway)."
BF_Hardline,36tvk3,XxAVG_JOExX,1 point,Fri May 22 17:02:04 2015 UTC,"They aren't shitty weapons FYI, I wish I saw that comment 2 days ago so I could respond. ACW-R is very good. My most used weapon CAR 556 and I have over 3000 kills with it. My buddy only uses the L85 and swears by it. I have another buddy that got the standard game and regretted not getting the deluxe because it's a lot of fun being able to use different weapons. Every weapon allows for a different style of play and that makes all the battlefield games a lot of fun. I love trying new weapons. I think the ACW could be one of the best weapons in the game, but I have been so wrapped up in all the other guns that I haven't had time for it. Also the benefit of having these ""shitty"" weapons is you don't need a weapon license and you can use them on both the Cops and Criminals. In the regular game Cops have one set of weapons and Criminals have their own set of weapons. You need 1250 kills with each weapon for the chance to buy a weapon license for $50,000 which allows you to use it on both factions. When I first started I didn't enjoy using a different weapon each game because it makes it kind of challenging to get good with one weapon when you need to adjust for a different recoil every game, it makes muscle memory challenging. So instead of doing that, I was able to use my Car-556 every game and I got good with it and I felt it gave me an edge on the competition being able to use one gun each game regardless of when I was cops or criminals. Now the game has been out for a couple months so the players have picked the weapons they like and stuck with it in order to get the weapon license. I think I am rambling at this point but what I am trying to say is they aren't shitty, so if it's only 34 dollars, I would say that's a good deal. I payed full price for it with a pre order along with premium, so maybe my opinion isn't important since I love this game and I play this game quite a bit. Premium isn't a necessary purchase yet as there is no special content that comes with premium yet. The new DLC might be coming out soon, but we haven't heard much about it. I spent 50 for premium, but every few weeks they have a deal of $45 for premium. I think there will be a total of 4 DLC packs that come with premium but I might be mistaken. We will see what else will come in the future. For now I am a level 150 and I continue to play this game. Blood money is a lot of fun when you have a squad because you never know how the game is going to go. Every game is different and it's always a challenge. Sometimes the action is at your base, sometimes it's at the enemy's base and sometimes the action is in the middle at the money pile. The dynamic can change real quick and I have had games where the enemy has 140 out of 150 and we only had 60, but because our entire team attacked their base, we ended up swinging the game and coming back. It's a great feeling being able to swing the momentum of game like that. Overall, I would say battlefield is a great game. There are some spawn issues in conquest and team deathmatch, but they will get sorted out soon. We have only had 1 patch since launch, and if it's anything like BF4, we will have plenty of patches to come that will make the game even better. It looks great and it plays great too. Once you find people to play with, it will make it twice as fun. Like I said, sorry if I rambled but I just wanted to give my honest opinion about this game because I think it deserves a chance."
BF_Hardline,36tvk3,Quikemex,1 point,Sun May 24 21:37:54 2015 UTC,i bought it and I absolutely love it. BTW acw-r is my favorite gun behind the snipers of course :)
BF_Hardline,36rnoo,DANNYonPC,22,Thu May 21 16:07:45 2015 UTC,"I wonder if all 50 of the PC players will download it.  Jokes aside, I wonder if it will get enough players to be useful for the developers.  The BF4 CTE isn't always that populated and there actually is a good sized community playing that game."
BF_Hardline,36rnoo,RockPaperBFG,8,Thu May 21 20:13:31 2015 UTC,Well it's only a subset of the 50 that bought Premium.  Like me (FML).

BF_Hardline,36rnoo,TehDarkArchon,3,Thu May 21 22:02:48 2015 UTC,Same here. 600+ hours in BF4 and 58 in Hardline. Zero motivation to go back. After Witcher 3 I'll just return to BF4
BF_Hardline,36rnoo,norjala,2,Fri May 22 11:40:43 2015 UTC,"I find it funny that people on this sub were all gun-ho for pre-ordering Hardline because they enjoyed BF4 so much, yet it still backfired on them.  Don't pre-order, people."
BF_Hardline,36rnoo,Tezla55,14,Fri May 22 02:17:38 2015 UTC,"So lets take the sadly small PC player base and devide it into a beta client that people have to install separately, so maybe a couple hundred people can try out a new patch.  Honost to god just turn the regular PC client into effectivly the CTE and make patching more frequent.  This game is an oddity, but I wish it the best."
BF_Hardline,36rnoo,I-never-joke,4,Thu May 21 19:23:25 2015 UTC,"This is what I've been saying, even with BF4, just push patches out to the PC players ASAP. No need for two separate clients. Never got the BF4 CTE but I hated how it regularly got ""cool"" new updates for weeks/months before the main game ever did. No need for such a giant gap in time.  Worst comes to worst, some horrible patch that ruins the game, guess what? The frequent patching means there will be a new one within 24 hours!  Most of the time this won't be the case, and all PC players will be 100% up to date without splitting the player base."
BF_Hardline,36rnoo,FTLRalph,1 point,Thu May 21 21:24:36 2015 UTC,"The thing with CTE is that they can push out new patches without risking anything. Some changes aren't just ""oh that didn't work, let's revert it"", but it has to be tried out extensively.  Look at the new 60/120Hz servers. They have so many bugs right now, but they still get tested so they can be perfected. This isn't something that could be released to retail directly."
BF_Hardline,36rnoo,pp3001,2,Fri May 22 06:27:26 2015 UTC,"Look at all the comments by people who have sworn off buying Battlefield games because of issues from launch to almost every new patch they released for Battlefield 4.  ""Battlefield 4 has stopped working"" ring a bell?  Apparently releasing a patch for a game requires certification by Origin, takes a week at least according to the executive producer of the game."
BF_Hardline,36rnoo,EliteDangerous,4,Fri May 22 02:11:12 2015 UTC,"Downloading!  I really hope they make it available for everyone, or else it will be empty.

BF_Hardline,36rnoo,pp3001,3,Thu May 21 16:37:23 2015 UTC,"Weird, I thought they had already decided to make it available for everyone.  CTE for BF4 has always had issues with very low / non existent player counts.  CTE for Hardline will be a permanent ghost town in a matter of days unless they open it up to all users."
BF_Hardline,36rnoo,Lincolns_Revenge,2,Thu May 21 17:35:18 2015 UTC,"They need to give us a reason to buy premium first. If premium doesn't even give us access to the 3 DLC weapons that were at release, there is 0 incentive to buy it until at least the first DLC releases."
BF_Hardline,36rnoo,Zergonaplate,2,Thu May 21 20:45:13 2015 UTC,"EA really botched the deluxe weapons. Right now there is no reason to use them due to the fact that they are terrible compared to the other operator guns, and even if the M416/M16 are nerfed they are still too bland and feel too much like a weapon skin to use. That obviously on top of locking them out to deluxe only."
BF_Hardline,36rnoo,brontesaur,3,Fri May 22 07:46:37 2015 UTC,Ifit takes away any more players from the main game it could collapse the population- not instantly but with the addition of the DLC and this- it could dilute the low numbers badly-
BF_Hardline,36rnoo,fletch420man,4,Thu May 21 17:36:41 2015 UTC,"I think that this will tragically fail unless they give it to everyone or at least dedicated players, with 100+ hours in Hardline, or whoever was an active and helpful tester for BF4 CTE."

BF_Hardline,36r2qg,AudioRejectz,12,Thu May 21 13:20:50 2015 UTC,"When the game launched it was regularly between 8-12k players.  The week GTAV came out, the numbers dropped to what you see now.  I don't think there is enough active players to survive the first DLC."
BF_Hardline,36r2qg,NoThingsConsidered,11,Thu May 21 14:57:07 2015 UTC,"This has been brought up many times, and the answers will vary person-to-person. For me personally, I find this game has very little depth. Tactical combat is all but gone in this game. Maps are too small to warrant it, and there is no ""flow"" of action; Everyone's just spawning everywhere and it's just a chaotic mess. On PC specially, the lower TTK in the form of higher bullet damage, higher average bullet velocity, 3d spotting, smaller average engagement distances, minimap player scaling to see exactly what floor the enemy is on, etc. just makes it an extremely frustrating experience imo. This seems to be less of a problem on console, since on average, it's hard to be ""as accurate"" as with a M&K. I'm looking forward to trying out the new DLC as the new maps sound like they could be pretty cool (perhaps a indoor mall and hospital precinct? sounds awesome!) But the problem with that is, similar to other BFs, the DLC maps tend to wither away after the first few weeks, perhaps even faster given HLs small PC population. So I don't really know how to fix this. For me, the flaws are embedded in the core gameplay."
BF_Hardline,36r2qg,TehDarkArchon,6,Thu May 21 16:26:44 2015 UTC,"I own the game on both PC and Xbox One and still prefer PC because the graphics and overall game feels snappier and smoother, even though there is MUCH larger playerbase on console.  My biggest gripe about the game is it feels like a camp-to-win multiplayer game and I feel like I'm constantly getting killed by people I never saw or had any chance to counter/kill first.  Most weapons are extremely powerful and have a very short TTK with a minimal damage drop, which only compounds the problem. Maybe it's just me, but that's one of the most frustrating parts of the game; getting killed by enemies I never saw over and over again."
BF_Hardline,36r2qg,laxmanchip,4,Thu May 21 16:17:57 2015 UTC,"Balance. Content. Bf4 came out with more content than Hardline will have for the first 2 dlcs, and with so little to do, the massive grinds to get the last few things is hardly fun or worth it. Plus, its wildly unbalanced, there's no reason to play anything other than professional or operator most of the time."
BF_Hardline,36r2qg,Snaz5,1 point,Thu May 21 19:13:15 2015 UTC,anything other than professional? If anything professional is practically useless in a team since there is literally nothing he can do in that regard besides the gimmicky little cameras

They've also got the mac-10 which is a better SMG than all the other smgs."
BF_Hardline,36r2qg,Snaz5,2,Thu May 21 23:53:27 2015 UTC,"yeah meanwhile operator has ARs(lol M16A3/HK416) Med packs and defibs.

BF_Hardline,36r2qg,slamdotswf,22,Thu May 21 22:35:51 2015 UTC,"The PC community (from my experience) is more aware of games. Hardline is, arguably, terribly unbalanced; so PC gamers will steer clear from it until it's patched. Also, the BF PC community tend to stick to the main BF titles (as there are more hardcore BF players on PC), so Hardline isn't something of interest to them. In other words, the PC community is often times intolerant to BS. Just some ideas from my observations."
BF_Hardline,36r2qg,Infemeth,8,Thu May 21 14:12:48 2015 UTC,I think you give players too much credit. They just have better things to play. It has nothing to do with the complex nature of the system as most are trying to argue. People will play games like hardline if they are the best. Right now it is just not the best on PC.
BF_Hardline,36r2qg,Darknotical,3,Thu May 21 14:35:09 2015 UTC,"With GTA and BF4 still getting updates, it's hard for people to pick up a mostly infantry game."

BF_Hardline,36r2qg,camtomcarey,3,Thu May 21 23:43:57 2015 UTC,"I would disagree, since PC games (while they tend to get better sales and such, through Steam/GOG/Humble/wherever else) are more willing to drop extra money on DLC or microtransactions. Look at Hearthstone, League, DotA 2, CS:GO... the list goes on. So while most PC gamers may be more 'aware' that other games exist, that doesn't necessarily mean we're any better than console players at allocating our money to good games. Just... differently bad."
BF_Hardline,36r2qg,DarthPneumono,3,Fri May 22 09:48:07 2015 UTC,"BF4 took a while and a lot of work to get where they are today.  I enjoy it A LOT now (also, major thanks to BFHL for teaching me how to play BF).    I think what it comes down to is that BFHL got released at bad price and bad timing for PC community.  GTA V for PC was on everyone's radar, so it makes sense that PC player count dropped after GTA V PC release.  Console guys had it for 1.5 years so they had enough time to play the game.  Pricing wise, EA/Visceral probably knew that the console market is going to pay for it and boom while PC sales are going to slump.  I also think the segregation between PC and Console communities are more severe today and in BFHL's case, console brings in more $$$ than PC do.    If EA thinks BFHL PC communities are important, then they need to do massive price cuts to bring players in or make premium free for current owner."
BF_Hardline,36r2qg,Earlkay,3,Thu May 21 16:56:51 2015 UTC,"Map fatigue, there are a couple of decent maps in the game but nothing shines.  Lack of destruction doesn't help. Cheaters that Visceral won't do anything about, with low population numbers it's not like you can just move to another server to get away from them. I know some people have uninstalled because they rage quit over the fast TTK in this game.  Some have uninstalled because they needed to make room for GTAV, too bad you can't uninstall the single player portion of the game and keep the multiplayer."
BF_Hardline,36r2qg,EliteDangerous,3,Thu May 21 17:09:18 2015 UTC,"A lot of the reason is because people thought that the game was too much money for what it was.  When added with premium most thought the prices were way over the top.  Many who did purchase it weren't happy with the gun balance, TTK, and spawns.  (I'm not one of them BTW, I love the game and play it almost daily).  One of the things related to TTK I've noticed between consoles and PC is the fact that accuracy is better on PC so TTK has a greater effect when compared to consoles, who take a bit longer to get shots on target.  We told the devs to analyze this as the PC version might need some specific tweaks to make TTK more in line with consoles perceived TTK."
BF_Hardline,36r2qg,wda_exodus,6,Thu May 21 18:49:51 2015 UTC,"SADly this will be the first BF franchise failure- The weapon balance is still completely incomplete. There are still broken mechanics like the molotovs with no counter so spam artisit can just close parts of maps with perma fire spam......I still play it more for the arcade game type feel it has, but now that I have hit 100 I have been swapping back to BF4 more."

BF_Hardline,36r2qg,BigSeeProduction,4,Fri May 22 07:36:50 2015 UTC,"I like Hardline and I think it's more polished than BF4 was at the same point since launch date. BF4 was neither balanced nor even working at this point.  That said, BF4 now is a much bigger and better game, amazing bang for buck. While Hardline is very expensive for the amount of content, servers and active players.  I'm not even sure I'll get Premium for Hardline, only if it drops to 15, 20$max. After spending 50$ on is I already feel pretty let down."
BF_Hardline,36r2qg,Shark00n,3,Thu May 21 21:00:50 2015 UTC,"Maybe because BF4 is way better than Hardline. Tanks, choppers, war boats and everything more.   Hardline seems like DLC maps for BF4, where they took out most of fun things from the game."

BF_Hardline,36r2qg,ACovers,4,Thu May 21 13:25:39 2015 UTC,"I disagree, I got kinda bored with the UCAV, aircraft with explosives, and the less emphasis on infantry combat.

BF4 is a lot of fun for actual group tactics because the harder targets (boats, tanks, choppers, ect)."

That patch was small and pretty disappointing. In the mean time, I've got BF4 to play which is still getting a lot of support and new features to keep it interesting and fun to play, not to mention all the other games sitting in my Steam library waiting to be played."
BF_Hardline,36r2qg,Zergonaplate,0,Thu May 21 17:35:55 2015 UTC,BF4 is a better game.  I play BFH and BF4 on XB1 and there really is no comparison between the two.  Hardline is fun but it's no BF4.
BF_Hardline,36r2qg,pimp_bizkit,1 point,Thu May 21 20:04:45 2015 UTC,Because you touch yourself at night. :C  Na really it is because of the diverse amount of quality games that are available to PC players. If you have a rig that can play hardline then you probably have a taste for different games.

They copy + pasted some many freaking things it's not even funny.  It has been said that people don't play Hardline because it's Cops vs Criminals and Battlefield is always been about all out warfare. I think people aren't interested in this game because they want quality over quantity."
BF_Hardline,36r2qg,Badmothafcka312,0,Thu May 21 15:45:36 2015 UTC,I got the game for half price earlier this week and it seems like there is only 6-8 playable servers at one time.

BF_Hardline,36vfdj,MangoEmperor,4,Fri May 22 18:01:45 2015 UTC,"I enjoy Hardline equally as BF4. Some of your points are kinda moot.   Price wise, I don't agree, people paid $60 (some of us $100 due to Premium) for BF4, which might I add was darn near unplayable the first few months after launch. Hardline is it's own game and not ""BF4 2.0""   Destruction is a funny point because while it's cool, it's not even close to arguable that Metro and Lockers are the most popular maps, both which offer miniscule amounts of destruction  Premium is a valid point, but even BF4 Premium was meh in the beginning (little to no details)  I understand your points 100% as a customer, but BF4 was in a way worse condition than Hardline...I dont understand the grievances for Hardline, when BF4 wasnt even stable for months after its release...I love some BF4, but the hypocrisy against Hardline is odd to me"
BF_Hardline,36vfdj,pp3001,8,Fri May 22 22:29:09 2015 UTC,"the lack of destruction was a lazy lazy stategy...that coupled with small maps declined the re-playability. Don't listen to their excuses about map design; it was just laziness.   I couldn't disagree more.  Apart from The Block, i think the map design is much better in BFH than BF4.  Talking about lazy? The BF4 formula is verticality for roof camping and big open maps without cover. This might work well if you enjoy vehicles, but as an infantry player, it's hard to do well on CQL."
BF_Hardline,36vfdj,RecklessWabbit,5,Fri May 22 19:56:34 2015 UTC,"Let's just conveniently ignore the massive amount of camp-able structures in BF:H, shall we? Every Battlefield game has had ""big open maps without cover"", that's just part of Battlefield, that's why you need to move up to objectives alongside your squad and your vehicles.  OP has a great point, Hardline is just every man for himself run 'n' gun hip fire insta-death. The team play aspect that is so important and prevalent in BF4 and previous Battlefield titles is not present in Hardline. Hardly anyone is giving out revives, ammo or medpacks, no one is pushing up with their vehicles to take objectives....it's just chaos on every map.  Lastly, it most certainly is not hard to do well as an infantry player on CQL in BF4. The key is situational awareness. This means you need to be aware of your environment and surroundings, and be prepared to adapt to changing conditions (e.g. Tank coming around the corner). If you see enemies or a vehicle that you probably can't take out, don't fire at them."
BF_Hardline,36vfdj,SirManguydude,3,Fri May 22 13:33:11 2015 UTC,Let's not forget the two most popular maps from BF3 and BF4 that barely had any destruction.  Here's looking at you OpMetro/Locker
BF_Hardline,36vfdj,RecklessWabbit,1 point,Fri May 22 14:24:44 2015 UTC,"Close quarters infantry maps can't exactly have a ton of destruction, but even then there is actually a fair bit of dynamic destruction in those maps."

Still less than all the campable roof tops or hills in BF4.   The team play aspect that is so important and prevalent in BF4 and previous Battlefield titles is not present in Hardline.   Game modes like blood money and heist are very dependent on team play, and not so much on the individual skill of each player. Where as in BF4, it's the team that has the best vehicle players that do the best. (Or in the case of infantry only maps, the team that has the best shooters.).

But it's vastly different on PC because of the superior aim of M+KB.  Having 500+ hours on both console and PC individually for BF4 I can say that CQL works a lot better on console just for the fact that it's so much easier to hit more distant targets on PC, which makes moving around much easier on console. I don't even want to mention the amount of tank sniping that goes on on PC."
BF_Hardline,36vfdj,sgt_anderson,2,Sat May 23 01:31:11 2015 UTC,"Blood Money....you mean the game mode that turns into fire fights,and individuals running to a money pile hoping they don't get hit and killed in the process.I haven't seen much team work in any Hardline besides being a vehicle."
BF_Hardline,36vfdj,RecklessWabbit,1 point,Fri May 22 14:36:00 2015 UTC,"Blood money and heist may be dependent on team play, but unfortunately team play doesn't occur very often. It just seems like people on BF4 are better at team play, or more inclined to play that way. Yes, a good vehicle player will do well on BF4, but so will the rest of the team. It is extremely important to have your vehicles up and dominating otherwise your team will generally not do very well.   Same goes for infantry only maps; your team will do far better with a few good players leading the way. I play both PC and Console, and having 1100+ hours on console and a good few on PC I can honestly say that the snipers are just as prevalent (and just as good) on console in open maps as they are on PC. As for tank sniping, well yes, that's a pain. But a good tank player will find a way to keep his vehicle up and going, using cover effectively etc."
BF_Hardline,36vfdj,Time_Itself,2,Fri May 22 22:33:30 2015 UTC,"BF4's legacy hurt Hardline. BF4 launch was so awful it really hurt the Battlefield name. And at this point even casual gamers know picking up a Battlefield game in the first few months after launch is a gamble. The players who stuck it out are really committed to that game. The players who eventually came back or started when things were getting better haven't had a full year with BF4 working and aren't feeling the need to change games.  The somewhat confusing part is that at launch Hardline was in respectable shape. Some bugs, even some major ones, but in better shape than BF3 not to mention 4. But critics point to weapon balance? That means so much other stuff is working. Sure there is room for improvement. But they'll never make everyone happy.  Price point is a very interesting thing. Sure Hardline might almost be a mod for BF3.  How much gamers willing to pay for it, or any other game for that matter is up to them. If it's not worth it now, just wait and it'll be cheaper. The price on PC has been discounted quite a bit already.  It sounds like something happened that I wish would be more common. Players say a game is too expensive or some other issue and DON'T BUY IT, in mass. So the publisher lowers the price. With multiplayer focused games they have to be aggressive about this stuff to keep the numbers high enough so that players can actually play. Not just the regular buying it because their friends are playing thing.  But with Hardline the discounts came so fast many took it as a sign of problems (BF4 kind of problems) and stayed away. The resulting lower player numbers started a reinforcing trend of not many people playing, making it harder to get games, and fewer new copies being sold.  How to avoid this? Maybe not price it as a $60 release? There isn't anything fundamentally wrong with hardline. It's a little different from the typical Battlefield formula but that's they issue most of these sequels face. Having to be like the old game, but different enough to be its own thing. Splitting up player bases and trying to attract new players. Very much the same issues CoD faces.  MW3 was the best selling CoD game. But BO2 (the one after MW3) has one of the strongest extended lives in multiplayer of any of the series, despite selling fewer copies than MW3. Can you blame some of BO2's lower sales on the shortcomings of MW3? Similar issue here, just much more pronounced."
BF_Hardline,36vfdj,fletch420man,2,Fri May 22 22:12:45 2015 UTC,"I'm 50/50 on this- I have played the series since 1942beta, so as a longtime franchise player it kind of stings to see such a spectacular failure. The game offered some very interesting game modes and the arcade run and gun is fun for a short time. But the low TTK insta death and complete lack of weapon balance show why this game failed- lack of execution and follow thru in al,ost every way possible."
BF_Hardline,36vfdj,pp3001,7,Fri May 22 19:50:15 2015 UTC,"It's far from a failure. Sure, the PC player base isn't big, but it sold well and actually worked at launch."
BF_Hardline,36vfdj,fletch420man,3,Fri May 22 13:24:43 2015 UTC,I'm sorry but our metrics seem to be quite different. The game has been out 2 months and the playerbase has been in steady decline since week four......how in the fuck you call a month old launch  declining in players anything other than a spectacular faliure would be interesting to hear-

BF_Hardline,36vfdj,ap66crush,1 point,Fri May 22 21:24:33 2015 UTC,Any game sees a drop in players the longer it has been out. Console servers are still healthy 24/7. I don't see many console players going back to bf4 (though I would admit that is an observation limited by my experience and good for nothing).
BF_Hardline,36vfdj,sgt_anderson,1 point,Fri May 22 22:44:06 2015 UTC,"Well considering the game has only been out a couple months,the first part of your statement still doesn't say much about Hardline.I work at electronic store,I see consoles returning the game everyday.So the consoles are declining.I will say this,if the first DLC doesn't fix the problems,the game is screwed."
BF_Hardline,36vfdj,ap66crush,1 point,Fri May 22 23:14:00 2015 UTC,"Uh, people return games pretty often at the outset of release. Play it for a few hours, don't like it or their friends are not playing it, return it. Thats what I did with Call of Duty...its not like I can use this to say that the player base of Call of Duty is declining.   I have yet to see any server counts that show that player base is declining in any kind of drastic way on consoles (especially PS4)."
BF_Hardline,36vfdj,sgt_anderson,1 point,Sat May 23 01:33:16 2015 UTC,"Well people returning a game isn't bad,but when someone buys a game and within a 2 days returns it.Well you get the picture.The numbers on the consoles won't decline as fast as the PC,cause the options (especially on the next gen) aren't that high.Especially withe PC players being to get GTA now.As I said before,everyone from consoles to PC don't like this game.There are still a couple of people who are just gonna wait through the storm,but others are moving on and going back to BF4.   Mark my words,if their first DLC (which is reported to have a patch included with it) doesn't fix or address some of these issues,then you see the declining of consoles players even more rapidly."
BF_Hardline,36tcqa,noodygamer,12,Thu May 21 23:25:20 2015 UTC,Agreed.  If you've played a game with everyone actually jumping in cars its an absolute blast tho.

Our team won by a landslide because the other team was so single-minded in trolling they didn't bother trying to steal cars.  Campers rarely change position, so if you alter your route and stay unpredictable you'll most likely do okay. I've actually had a pretty good time in games where I spent the majority of the time avoiding traps and ambushes."
BF_Hardline,36tcqa,NihonRobot,2,Fri May 22 20:45:55 2015 UTC,I still have good hotwire games.  I agree that there is some variability on when people choose to play the objective.  But how is that different from any other game mode?  I play Blood Money games where pretty much nothing is happening except for killing.  People ignoring the objectives is not new to this game mode or game imo.

That's all the game is, I don't mind getting blown up a dozen times if my team has more cars up I'm doing good.    It's kinda like Cleveland said when Peter asked ""does anyone win this game?"" ""No you just do a little better each time""    My suggestion is to always change your route and never hug corners, avoid areas where blind cover is nearby. Ditch your side arm for a tracking dart, anytime you're on foot and you see an empty car, track that mofo. Anytime your getting sodomized with explosives just keep dividing and conquering."
BF_Hardline,36tcqa,mindfulmu,1 point,Fri May 22 04:18:18 2015 UTC,Just an idea. If you know they are camping spawn vehicles with breaching charges then kill them before you get in the vehicle. If you know they are waiting to blow you out of the vehicle as soon as you get in then kill them before you get in the vehicle.   If you are driving around then be aware of who is trying to take you out. It is their job to take you out. It is your job to stay alive as long as possible. If you think they are doing their job then that means you aren't doing your job. Get better.

BF_Hardline,36tou3,ETuesday,4,Fri May 22 04:39:29 2015 UTC,"DMR's are pretty great, however the DMR's you are hearing is probably the scout bolt action. It's still by far the best DMR."
BF_Hardline,36tou3,Joppe84,1 point,Fri May 22 11:03:21 2015 UTC,Maybe it's because people figured out they aren't half bad. The socom and the saiga are both a blast to use and are decent and short and medium ranges.
BF_Hardline,36tou3,fishsquatchblaze,0,Fri May 22 11:37:09 2015 UTC,I noticed that the MPX is the new K10. Every other sever I go into has a guy who only uses the MPX with 100 gold stars.
BF_Hardline,36tou3,heavy242,5,Fri May 22 04:52:35 2015 UTC,Well then they likely started using MPX way before the K10 got nerfed then Because 100 Gold Stars is a lot of killing.
BF_Hardline,36tou3,BillyHoWCR,1 point,Fri May 22 04:59:28 2015 UTC,MPX was already good before.
BF_Hardline,36tou3,UrbanRaptor,-1,Fri May 22 07:14:12 2015 UTC,"I'd argue the MPX was better than K10, for the simple reason that the K10 emptied a clip even if you misplaced your shots. The MPX however you got 36 (?) shots with extra mag, meaning you can easily rape 4-5 people in a row. And even if you miss your first rounds you can spray back into their face and still not empty the clip."
BF_Hardline,36tou3,Joppe84,3,Fri May 22 17:55:35 2015 UTC,"I think the fire rate needs to be toned down a bit. It's annoying as hell to have volleys of bullets being thrown at you, but like 2 out of 20 of them hit you because the guy spraying you with it USUALLY sucks ass. Some people basically make them full auto guns."
BF_Hardline,36tou3,Joppe84,1 point,Fri May 22 05:28:35 2015 UTC,"So you wanna nerf DMR's because of RoF, but doesn't mention the ARs or BRs or SMG's for that matter. Right."
BF_Hardline,36tou3,Joppe84,0,Fri May 22 06:07:14 2015 UTC,"They are automatic guns. Their bullets don't do as much damage as DMRs. You shouldn't be able to shoot a DMR so fast. You get a gun that has decently low recoil, an unusually fast fire rate and high damage."
BF_Hardline,36tou3,Joppe84,1 point,Fri May 22 11:14:20 2015 UTC,"That makes no sense. If you can fire bullets faster you basically end up doing just as much, and argueably WAY more dmg in the same period of time, despite each bullet doing less dmg per hit."
BF_Hardline,36tou3,Joppe84,1 point,Fri May 22 14:19:26 2015 UTC,"ARs BRs and SMGs are less accurate. They shoot fast, but you're going to have a hell of a time hitting someone from across the map. DMRs you can shoot fast and you get a longer range."
BF_Hardline,36tou3,FalconiiLV,1 point,Fri May 22 17:58:01 2015 UTC,"Are you high? Have you tried the ARs in this game? Have you tried the carbines? M16 HK416, Car-556, ARM and most other guns - they shoot like lasers. If you maintain a higher DPS with a DMR than a M16 for instance, then you have no idea how to use the AR. They are so OP, to start whining about DMRs is just comical."
BF_Hardline,36tou3,PurpleGladiator,0,Fri May 22 20:29:40 2015 UTC,I know their OP. Everything is OP in this game. This is a thread about DMRs though. I asked about DMRs so why would I even mention ARs BRs and SMGs in the original comment?
BF_Hardline,36tou3,Earlkay,2,Sat May 23 10:01:46 2015 UTC,"Because if you whine about a weapon you need to put it in context. If you don't, the entire post has no value."

BF_Hardline,36pqs0,KountryBlumpkin,3,Thu May 21 06:24:46 2015 UTC,Stubby grip. The first shot recoil is low so you want to make sure you compensate for your follow-up shot recoil and the stubby will help with that.   stubby + compensator = laser beam death machine.
BF_Hardline,36pqs0,macaronyboy,2,Thu May 21 14:05:13 2015 UTC,"Compensator and angled grip can make for an extremely deadly tap-fire combination, yet still hold its own very well in CQB."

OR Increase the headshot multiplier against an insert user.  OR Introduce Armor piercing rounds into the game. Doesn't add damage to weapons, just renders the armor insert useless.

BF_Hardline,36qwow,fletch420man,1 point,Thu May 21 21:15:45 2015 UTC,Another way IMO would be change it to a helmet that decreases the headshot multiplier. Not drastically but just enough that its useful.

I am aware that previous battlefield games had longer ranges, more vehicles, more weapons and so on. I certainly appreciate some of the new things in this game (quick match and customizing outside of multiplayer matches) that reduced some of the friction. There are elements like longer sniper ranges, jets, and tanks that I wouldn't mind experiencing, but otherwise I'd like to see what this DLC holds before spending a bunch on a game that few of my friends currently play.    I also raise an eyebrow anyone says that something is or isn't a ""true"" -insert any range of things here-. When people would say what they liked in battlefield vs CoD, and I decided to get this game, I actually did see what they were talking about. While there are differences, this game does seem to still have many of those defining characteristics, even if they're scaled down and placed in a Cops/Criminals theme instead of military. Just my thoughts on that."

Stingers are perfectly balanced, they are few and far between and people only put them in the trunks of their cars once you start killing them too often in the chopper. Learn the pickup locations and learn to play carefully around them. If someone makes their way to a stinger pickup, and kills you, they deserve that kill just as much as you deserve a kill for getting in a chopper and finding the first spotted camper and killing them.   I dont really bother flying much in this game, Downtown is the only good map because there are buildings to move between for cover."
BF_Hardline,36qxha,DrDeviljho,2,Thu May 21 12:53:58 2015 UTC,Yep.  Learn to pilot better and maneuver better if you're having problems with stingers.
BF_Hardline,36qxha,Troy_Davis,3,Thu May 21 13:59:33 2015 UTC,"As a avid Battlefield chopper pilot, Stinger missiles really ruin the air vehicle experience in Hardline for me.    As an avid infantry player chopper pilots who go 43/5 really ruin the boots on the ground experience in Hardline for me."
BF_Hardline,36qxha,rev_me_bro,3,Thu May 21 18:32:00 2015 UTC,I think they need a buff. A good pilot is very hard to stop.
BF_Hardline,36qxha,tentoesup747,4,Thu May 21 19:59:36 2015 UTC,"So what did you do in BF3 and BF4 when people had stingers? If you can't take on 2 people with stingers, how did you take on 5 or 6 with stingers?"
BF_Hardline,36qxha,_Duskyyy,-5,Thu May 21 12:51:46 2015 UTC,"You can't really compare BF3/4 stingers with BF:H stingers, as there is quite a difference. BF4 stingers needed, generally, 3-5 hits on a heli to take it down. These stingers also caused mobility loss. BF:H stingers can disable a patrol heli in 1 hit (basically they are a OHK). OP brings up a good point here, as these missiles are overpowered. For starters, counter-measures flat out do not work. I have personally deployed flares only just BEFORE the stinger has been launched and still have had it hit and kill me. This is extremely frustrating for not only me but anyone who gets in a heli. The damage model of the stingers wouldn't be such an issue if; a. The countermeasures were reliable and functioned correctly, and b. If small arms fire weren't damaging to heli's (thereby making the stinger, often enough, OHK due to damage sustained from said small arms fire).   I would be happy enough for Visceral to add an extra missile to the ammo of the stinger, but nerf the damage to make it, at the very least, a 2 hit kill on a full health heli. This would allow the pilot to have at least some amount of time to escape from the area and repair. If the stinger isn't to be needed, then buff the patrol heli's armour slightly so that it isn't disabled from one stinger."
BF_Hardline,36qxha,RecklessWabbit,2,Thu May 21 13:24:10 2015 UTC,"3-5 Stingers????? What????? It was 2 stingers to take down attack choppers. 2 stingers to take down mini birds.  Mobility loss = disabled  I've never been OHK by a stinger, the times that I've been in the chopper, I've been hit with a stinger and flown away to repair.  This was brilliantly stated by DrDeviljho.  ""Stingers are perfectly balanced, they are few and far between and people only put them in the trunks of their cars once you start killing them too often in the chopper. Learn the pickup locations and learn to play carefully around them. If someone makes their way to a stinger pickup, and kills you, they deserve that kill just as much as you deserve a kill for getting in a chopper and finding the first spotted camper and killing them.""  The answer is not to make stingers shoot marshmallows and make the helicopters near invincible. The answer is for you to figure it out and adapt to it.  EDIT to respond to your edit: The stinger is not a 1 hit kill."
BF_Hardline,36qxha,_Duskyyy,0,Thu May 21 13:33:54 2015 UTC,"Did you even play BF4? 2 stingers? No lol. Plus, mobility loss comes after each stinger hits. I never said anything about making stingers ""marshmallows"" and making heli's ""invincible"", just make it a bit fairer on the pilot by giving him a chance to actually get away. Also, I didn't say the singer is flat out a OHK, I said it is basically a OHK because small arms fire will often have already damaged the heli."
BF_Hardline,36qxha,RecklessWabbit,1 point,Thu May 21 21:30:11 2015 UTC,It takes a little bit more rockets to take down a heli in BF4 and the maps in that game are large enough to evade lock on and it gives you more time to re-arm countermeasures. I personally think that BF4 is a better game for air vehicles than BFH. Although a skilled jet pilot in BF4 can take helos down easily it doesn't bother me that much. I can fly jets too.
BF_Hardline,36qxha,_Duskyyy,1 point,Thu May 21 22:17:34 2015 UTC,"Ok. Let's say we nerf the stingers to where it takes ""3-5 stingers to take down a chopper"".  I pick up a stinger, shoot once, hit the chopper. Reload. Hit the chopper again. Chopper is still going, goes back, repairs, I'm out of stingers until the map respawns them for me. Chopper is back, full health fucking everything up. Nothing I can do about it but shoot my M416 at it and hope for the best. 5 minutes go by and the chopper is absolutely demolishing everyone because it's a skilled pilot and no one has any stingers. FINALLY, the stinger respawns, I shoot the chopper, hit it. Reload, I shoot the chopper again. MOBILITY HIT!!!! It flies away and repairs because I'm out of Stingers again.  The reason they were so ""weak"" in BF3 and BF4 was because everyone could have them on the map at the same time. It's not like that in Hardline, you have to pick them up, they have a respawn time. The choppers have to have some sort of weakness."
BF_Hardline,36qxha,RecklessWabbit,1 point,Fri May 22 12:33:00 2015 UTC,"Did you even read my post? I wasn't saying to make stingers 3-5 hits, I was merely suggesting a slight nerf to make them 2 hits disabled or to make small arms fire not damage the heli. Plus, I am concerned that countermeasures are STILL not functioning reliably."
BF_Hardline,36qxha,_Duskyyy,1 point,Fri May 22 14:29:34 2015 UTC,"Yeah? Why wouldn't I read your post?  ""I was merely suggesting a slight nerf to make them 2 hits disabled or to make small arms fire not damage the heli"" A ""slight nerf"" that causes the chopper to be destroyed in 3 stinger shots is ridiculous. The stingers come with, what, 2 rockets in it? That leads to the example that I posted above, there's no way to kill a chopper with 1 stinger pick up. If I hit you with 2 stingers and you run away, land, repair and come back at full health, there is nothing that I can do other than shoot at you with my AR until the next stinger pops up.  If countermeasures work that's one less stinger that I'm able to hit you with. I agree that they should work but if they do work, stingers shouldn't be nerfed because then, I'm only hitting you with one stinger as you fly away to be repaired.  I apologize that your chopper has weaknesses.  ""Stingers are perfectly balanced, they are few and far between and people only put them in the trunks of their cars once you start killing them too often in the chopper. Learn the pickup locations and learn to play carefully around them. If someone makes their way to a stinger pickup, and kills you, they deserve that kill just as much as you deserve a kill for getting in a chopper and finding the first spotted camper and killing them.""  EDIT: ""Did you even play BF4?"" Yes, a good bit actually!  ""2 stingers? No lol."" Yes. To be honest, I didn't use stingers a whole lot as I'm really too good to use such a unskillful weapon. I prefered RPGs.  ""Plus, mobility loss comes after each stinger hits."" Good.   ""I never said anything about making stingers ""marshmallows"" and making heli's ""invincible"", just make it a bit fairer on the pilot by giving him a chance to actually get away."" How is a pilot at a disadvantage? You're in a helicopter, you're flying, you have bigger guns, you have a copilot. These are all huge advantages over foot soldiers. Why do you need more advantages?  ""Also, I didn't say the singer is flat out a OHK, I said it is basically a OHK because small arms fire will often have already damaged the heli."" So then it's not a OHK, if it doesn't take one hit to kill you, it's not a one hit kill. I don't really know how you can argue that. It's very black and white, not a lot of grey area in there."
BF_Hardline,36qxha,RecklessWabbit,1 point,Fri May 22 14:49:55 2015 UTC,"Well, to make the first part of your post completely invalid, a stinger has 3 rockets. I have over 1100 hours on BF4, and didn't personally rely on stingers myself (much preferred the SRAW). What I have found in Hardline is that the stingers most certainly are overpowered, as getting one hit then disabled by them does make it almost impossible to escape. Generally, when it comes to pilot vs stinger, stinger wins, always. The pilot has to seek out and find the stinger before dying, or cower behind a building for the rest of the match. Alas, this is all opinion based, and I thank you for your perspective on it."

The things that are really wrong with the game are beyond anything they can patch at this point, the maps just don't hold your attention for that long - there's nothing in there that comes close to being a Karkand or Wake Island type map.  They can twiddle with the weapons all they want but short of bringing the gameplay more in line with BF4 in terms of time to kill/die it's not going to have any impact on bringing people back or into the game.  They're also missing a game mode like Rush that has a rather large following, Heist is close but it's missing the progression feeling you have with Rush.

BF_Hardline,36jp9p,Murk1e,4,Wed May 20 07:35:14 2015 UTC,"Normally I join a team (as I play by myself), and then I pick a coupe or sedan. Normally I'm the first to pick the car, so I should get the driver seat."
BF_Hardline,36jp9p,SIR_VELOCIRAPTOR,1 point,Wed May 20 08:07:35 2015 UTC,"Absolutely agree. And, if this isn't possible for some reason, the little camera view in the lower left corner of the load out screen should show you which seat you're going to be spawning into instead of always just showing the driver seat. There should be no question about where in a vehicle you're spawning."

BF_Hardline,36jp9p,RuthlessDickTater,1 point,Wed May 20 07:56:40 2015 UTC,I hate most of gunners when I pilot attack heli. It happens almost all the time that when I try to sneak behind enemy heli my gunner is firing on random guys 500 meters away and thus giving away my position on enemy radar. It happens no matter how many times I'm writing that we are going for the enemy heli first.

BF_Hardline,36if0k,Earlkay,1 point,Wed May 20 06:18:38 2015 UTC,Agreed. The bulk of the cheaters use wall hack and/or aimbot. The ones that just use wall hack are harder to detect. You wonder how that guy knew you were hunkered down in that corner when you are using a silenced weapon. But with player spotting and hacker GPS spotting you can't be sure. Aimbots are a little easier to detect as you say.

My journey to get it was interesting to say the least. I found myself really enjoying the sniping - and a lot of the time I felt quite overpowered.

BF_Hardline,36iydu,WeebaySA,-6,Wed May 20 18:32:31 2015 UTC,Who cares? The game should have been finised on release. Hotwire exploitation for boosters and weapon ballancing should have been resolved on release.   If it dies. It probably SHOULD die.

BF_Hardline,36iydu,Orphanlast,2,Wed May 20 13:20:37 2015 UTC,Sounds like you're going to give it a second chance. That's good. I like the game now and I think it will get better
BF_Hardline,36iydu,rev_me_bro,0,Wed May 20 13:33:46 2015 UTC,"It might. MarbleDuck (on youtube) made a video series about how they should ballance the guns (believe me, it's pretty fuckin' smart material) and Viceral just brushed it asside. The video series ends with MarbleDuck saying he has no confidence in Viceral.  The problem with the current weapon design is that they resemble the sort of design you would expect from a campaign's weapon design... which doesn't work for Online Multiplayer Games at all.  And Viceral has only worked on Campaigns. They've made DLC's for BF3, but they never had to ballance guns or program a multiplayer game."
BF_Hardline,36iydu,Orphanlast,2,Wed May 20 22:53:11 2015 UTC,"All games have bugs, the game WAS pretty much finished on release, unlike BF4."
BF_Hardline,36iydu,DCDVath,3,Tue May 19 19:24:53 2015 UTC,I agree. The release of BF:HL was way better than BF4. Even though I am now debating on getting BF4 for the xbone. (Already have it on PC.) I am hoping I can hold out for Battlefront.
BF_Hardline,36iydu,jordanwpg,2,Tue May 19 20:12:42 2015 UTC,I agree.... It was more complete than BF4 at launch.   Nice for them to copy&paste some of the netcode and enhance.

I do have a pretty epic flank I pulled on The Block with a solid 8 or 9 kill streak.   I'm kind of leaning towards 3-4 minutes at most of really select frags that are really nice shots or highlight my aim.   What do you think of that?
BF_Hardline,36j56x,BillyHoWCR,2,Tue May 19 21:10:23 2015 UTC,"Make it but don't expect anyone to care. Unless it is absolutely epic then it will be voted down more then likely.   Make people laugh... or get them to say 'Oh Shit"" and then you have 'em interested. But weapon montages, and 'I can do good... watch me while I do it' montages are a dime a dozen. :(  Maybe including your runs in the middle of some WTF moments might make them more appealing? Just what ever you do don't exaggerate your title with words like epic, most amazing, greatest ever, etc. unless they actually are."
BF_Hardline,36j56x,BillyHoWCR,1 point,Wed May 20 05:33:13 2015 UTC,I definitely plan on making it regardless of how people downvote/upvote. I don't much care about my karma and if that's what it takes to start getting a few people to enjoy my videos of hardline in down.   I have a draft video that's 9 minutes long with clips from all sorts of situations.  Most of them are really just shots I found awesome (like a no scope headshot in hardcore with an AWM) to a fun little flank I pulled off.   Also have some clips to show my counter strike habit of aiming for the head at all times and trying to move it there if I don't get it right away.   Would you be interested in that? I'm thinking I'll comb through and take out at least 3 minutes already.

Maybe? Will I upvote it or enjoy it? Likely not... as mentioned before I care very little about videos that are basically people doing the same old shoot,kill,shoot,kill with little variation. If it doesn't amuse me or impress me then my attention span is lost near immediately. And again... I am never impressed by anyone simply doing good in a game.

I shoot, the enemy gets incapacitated instantly and after a few seconds you get the kill (and I usually interrogate them afterwards too)  I like using the taser, I've got 239 kills with it, but these little hiccups are so annoying and I just wondered if anyone else has anything like this happen to them"
BF_Hardline,36jkkg,Dragonsmith,2,Tue May 19 22:34:09 2015 UTC,As annoying as they are I definitely think it makes sense from a balance standpoint. It gives their ally's a few seconds to protect their body from being interrogated. I mean it's an instant kill weapon!
BF_Hardline,36jkkg,Dragonsmith,1 point,Wed May 20 00:00:55 2015 UTC,Yes sorry I miscommunicated. I totally agree that the delay in interrogating is a good thing.   My problem is the weird delay when the game knows you've tased someone but doesn't show the animation or actually do the tasing/incapacitating until after you kill them using a different weapon.

BF_Hardline,36guml,SIR_VELOCIRAPTOR,-1,Tue May 19 08:45:20 2015 UTC,I would say you are exactly right. If you are playing a solo game. If you are a playing a multiplayer game then I would say you have a bit of responsibility to the community that plays with you.

BF_Hardline,36guml,SplitVision,3,Tue May 19 16:08:19 2015 UTC,Well if you and a good portion of your team are sitting back in the spawn boosting ammo points or any other thing that takes players away from the game then they are handicapping the team trying to play normal and hoping for a possible win.   When a player uses a glitch like the Hotwire vehicle glitch that allows him to get Hotwire points for doing nothing at all.. it basically tells all the other players... might as well give up any idea of competing for the MVP award... as the glitcher is going to get it for doing nothing.  Everything effects the community if you are playing wit other players.   It's like saying you are playing a racing game and a player decides he wants to drive the opposite direction and ram is vehicle into every player. Is that just him having fun and should be just accepted because he is playing is way regardless of him ruining the game for so many others?   Multiplayer gaming is all about competition. If you aren't going to be competitive then why play?  I just got done playing a Hotwire game where I and maybe 3 other people were playing the game. Everyone else was boosting back in the spawns.   We didn't stand a chance at earning any MVP award as the glitchers had already locked that up with their indefinite point earning. And we had to struggle just to find each other to battle it out and entertain ourselves.   You say just leave and play another server? Well only three other servers had Hotwire and two were full. While the other had 2 players just sitting there knifing each other for no reason.
BF_Hardline,36guml,SplitVision,1 point,Tue May 19 16:28:25 2015 UTC,"Because the unlocking features are (1) collection of specific things, (2) collection of things that require multiple prerequisites, (3) are difficult to achieve within standard play.  If small things (such as sights, or attachments) were incrementally given (instead of clumped together) then the slow (but constant) progression of unlocking things would feel more organic.  If attachments were unlocked as one per 10 kills, then there would be a sense of progression in the use, as well as slowly upgrading a weapon, a visual indicator, that you could percieve that you were making progress.  Most people want to have [thing] and want to do it the fastest way possible. If the sense of achievment is the same when boosting or not, then it really is a question of whether the system of unlocking is broken, or prerequisites are too high."
BF_Hardline,36guml,SplitVision,0,Tue May 19 08:34:21 2015 UTC,"If small things (such as sights, or attachments) were incrementally given (instead of clumped together) then the slow (but constant) progression of unlocking things would feel more organic.   And yet BF3 had for the most part an incremental progression of said small things and it too was populated with boosters not even playing the game just to achieve rank.   Is it too much to say 100 kills with a weapon be had before all weapon attachments can be purchased? (it isn't even that much in BFH) Hardline basically took BF3 but gave you a choice at what you could purchase instead of having certain things unlock that you didn't even want.   Most people want to have [thing] and want to do it the fastest way possible.   This I see but when many people aren't even playing the game and are sitting doing the most boring activities of farming of points... then the sense of achievement can't be the same from boosting to playing.   I think it really does boil down to the fact of most players doing this really just have little patience at all to try and achieve a difficult task. Spoon fed gaming society that cares more about end game then the actual enjoyment of the hunt. Which is playing the game.  Most amusing thing I see... is that it doesn't take long for people to start complaining that they ave nothing else to play for or strive to achieve because they are level 150 and maxed out in money and such. And yet for many... these people didn't even care to play the game properly to reach this level. They took the shortest route possible just to be done and then complain after doing so.     tl;dr - is a game still a game when you don't actually play it?"
BF_Hardline,36guml,ZeroBANG,1 point,Tue May 19 08:44:19 2015 UTC,"Here's the problem, as I see it:  The assignments requires the player to perform certain tasks, which in several cases aren't compatible with the goal of any game mode. Adding to that, these specific tasks are usually very time consuming due to how difficult it is to make progression towards finishing said task. To put it in other words, the assignments are currently too difficult to complete, hence why many resort to all forms of boosting/cheating/glitch exploiting in order to make progress towards these unecessarily difficult assignments.  The sum of all this is why it seems as if many people are screwing around doing nothing productive/not playing the game.  Don't misunderstand me though, this bugs me just as much as it seems to bug you. However, I blame the game design (assignments in particular) for the lack of players trying to win as their main goal.  PS: To have the ability to unlock all attachments for a weapon you need to get 90 kills with said weapon, in Hardline."
BF_Hardline,36guml,ZeroBANG,0,Tue May 19 10:22:13 2015 UTC,"The assignments requires the player to perform certain tasks, which in several cases aren't compatible with the goal of any game mode.   I will have to say for the most part the assignments tasks are actually game oriented. They require you to perform tasks that you might not normally try or bother with.   Cameras... they make you learn how to place cameras in such a way to actually assist your team. How is spotting enemy not goal oriented?  Revives... make you support your team and keep them alive. (and in BFH I find this rare) teaching you that you need to stay with your team to complete this task effectively.  Explosives... well taking out Hotwire vehicles is a huge goal in Hotwire. People keep saying the only objective is to drive the vehicles... but that is farthest from the truth. Objective is to keep your players in the vehicles and the enemy out of them.   Maybe the most likely thought is Shield Coins is possibly non-team oriented? But if you think about TDM, Blood Money matches and how Shield users can actually setup and help defend positions while team fires from behind them, then you can see how you can accomplish the objective while getting assignment.   The issue is more how people choose on their own to not play objective in their progress to an achievement more then not.   PS: To have the ability to unlock all attachments for a weapon you need to get 90 kills with said weapon, in Hardline.   Which is rather small amount is it not? And that is simply all attachments... many attachments are much lower count."
BF_Hardline,36guml,tyler2k,1 point,Tue May 19 11:34:26 2015 UTC,"Getting camera coins still require you to keep track of your cameras, whether someone has shot them out or not. If someone has, you have to place out a new one, which you can't just do anywhere (especially not if you're going for as many camera coins as possible). This leads to running around, seemingly aimlessly. Even more so if the cameras get shot out quite a lot.  Revives are not always helpful. Sometimes you doom yourself and your teammate by trying to revive him/her in a bad spot at a bad time. And in order to recieve as many camera coins as possible per game, people run around with nothing but the defibrilator/revive syringe. Again, seemingly running around aimlessly and not necessarily helpful.  Explosives are almost always useful. There's never really any negative aspect to destroying enemy vehicles.  Shield coins require way too much draw fire bonus to achieve. I've played full 64-man TDM's on The Block, only using the riot shield, without getting a single shield coin. Doing nothing but blocking bullets with the riot shield isn't very helpful either, except in certain situations.  People want fast results and too often that's not achieveable through normal gameplay.  About the attachments, 90 kills is not that much, no. In BF4, I believe it takes 140 kills to unlock all progression unlockable attachments. The rest has to be unlocked through battlepacks, which means that you most likely won't unlock all attachments for one weapon before you hit 500 kills with it."

Revives are not always helpful. Sometimes you doom yourself and your teammate by trying to revive him/her in a bad spot at a bad time.   Taking a chance is far better then doing nothing at all. And if you die while doing it then it is little different then dying any other way in game for not being aware of enemy around.

BF_Hardline,36guml,ZeroBANG,1 point,Wed May 20 09:55:35 2015 UTC,"You cut off the sentence too early. The point was that it requires too much attention to keep track of whether your cameras have been shot out or not, since there's no indicator of how many you've got running (apart from looking at the ""spot icon"" over the camera itself, which is difficult when everyone place their cameras in the same exact spots).  I can't count the number of times I've been revive-killed along with a teammate who doesn't think before acting.  Rofl, my bad. I meant revive coins, obviously.  Those certain situations won't be enough to reward you with a shield coin. Simple. Luckily, Visceral is changing the requirements to get shield coins.  Yeah, in BF4 you can't unlock all attachments by normal progression (x amount of kills, etc). Many attachments can only be unlocked through battlepacks. Kinda' ridiculous, but that's how it works."
BF_Hardline,36guml,Jayden92,1 point,Wed May 20 11:31:20 2015 UTC,"is difficult when everyone place their cameras in the same exact spots   Likely that is your issue? Try not watching videos on where to place cameras. They are useless. Again, this portion of the assignment is so easy it is ridicules to think anyone is having issues. Simply place them where the game activity dictates they need to be placed.    I can't count the number of times I've been revive-killed along with a teammate who doesn't think before acting.   But even if you get killed immediately afterwards it helps their team none. As their team still only gets one kill. But if you get revived then it takes a kill away from their team. So many times I have played games and the only difference is that one team was revive training and the other was not.   I meant revive coins,    I am playing Operator just not working on revive coins. I never run around with anything but gun out. And I never see others running around with just revive gadgets.

BF_Hardline,36guml,Jayden92,1 point,Wed May 20 12:23:17 2015 UTC,"Actually, that's not a personal issue. I had no problem getting the camera coins. I'm talking about general population. People are stupider than you'd think.  Point is, my spawn-timer gets reset, which puts me out of play longer, while they got a free kill without taking a single hit. They benefit some, while my team doesn't benefit from it at all. Doesn't matter that it only makes a small difference, it makes a difference nonetheless.  In order for me to consistently get revive coins (atleast when I was actively trying to get more than one per game), I had to revive any dead team mate I could reach before the revive-timer went out. Same problem occured in that scenario, I get killed along with my revived teammate. Only difference would be that I'm the dumbass reviver.

Just because you acted in such a fashion does not mean everyone else will. I don't get a revive coin each game currently, but I am at least averaging out in the fact my kill/revive vs death ratio is more on the positive then not. It's a numbers game more then anything. But your issue appears to be choosing the idea of revive at any cost instead of simply following teammates and revive as they go down?    What is it that you don't get?

In Hardline... locking weapons behind assignments that are more brutal than most of what BF4 had to offer, simply because the mechanics of the game are not well thought out or flat out broken... (camera + perk system mostly)... of course everybody wants those Weapons at any means necessary, these aren't the odd funky weapons like the Phantom Bow, these are useful primary weapons like the FMG9 or Knockout... the game doesn't have enough primary weapons as it is... of course people will gravitate towards the easiest solution to a problem like No Kill Hotwire Servers.  Add the same assignments without weapon unlocks... nobody would bother with them.    I'd say this whole Situation is a Problem that needs to be solved (patched!), it is not a fun unlock system or an achievement to be proud of once you got it, you are just happy that the pain is over."
BF_Hardline,36guml,Charles_Yuen,0,Tue May 19 10:22:05 2015 UTC,"it is not a fun unlock system or an achievement to be proud of once you got it,   Of course it is not such if you don't achieve it except for in the fashion where the system has to be cheated to achieve.  Yes I understand the frustration of some of the requirements. Some are truly challenging to the point of being non-achievable to most. (i.e. the shield coins) But others really are not as difficult as claimed and really are simply people being lazy more then not. (i.e. the camera coins)   Yes requirements can be (and are already set to be) adjusted to make some less difficult and more achievable. But those are far and few between in comparison to what people actually doing in boosting.   I don't see the Hotwire glitch boost as anything but people trying to get something for nothing.   And the weapons people are trying to get really are not better then the weapons already offered. They are unique in ways but hardly superior.     But let me use this as an example... people are always giving credit to those who have won big awards like say the Oscar, Olympic Medals, Platinum Records... Championship Rings, etc. but they weren't just handed these awards. They had to put long hours into and perfecting skills to earn them. Now if I was to cheat and get myself some steroids (aim assist?) and get the medals that way then everyone would say bad, so bad. Or if I simply came across a medal and purchased it at a Pawn Shop... people would think... ok nice, but really just a collectors piece not an award anymore.   It isn't fun to put long hours and effort into some sports to earn awards. But when they are earned then they are so much more appreciated.  But boosting, sitting in a corner earning MVP while everyone else is  playing the game and having no chance to win said award now... well how fair is that to others trying to play the game instead of farming for a collectors piece?  At what point do we stop playing the game simply to whore collectors pieces that have no meaning/accomplishments behind them?"

They are unique in ways but hardly superior.   if there are weapons to unlock. i want them. i don't care if they are better or worse or balanced, they could just be weapon skins with identical stats, i'd still want them... the variety of the game is low and locking weapons away behind idiotic hard assignments that you can't complete without basically cheating... that simply is bad game design.  Let me put it like this... if you go on a no kill hotwire server where people only drive around in circles not shooting each other. There is still a 50/50 chance that you will not get that 4th perk unlocked... because either some random dude joins the server and kills you in the middle of it, counter is reset and round ends before you can get it back up. OR some guy who even follows the rules jumps in the 5th car (usually the tanker) and starts bleeding tickets so the round ends before anyone can get to the 4th perk... so even with this bullshit it is still hard and becomes sort of a minigame to get that last unlock. I unlocked the FMG9 that way and it was annoying enough that i won't bother with the Knockout or that Shotgun, which i won't use anyway. But i can totally understand why people are doing it and for Visceral not to fix this in the first patch, which already was too late with 6 weeks... that is just weak, it isn't like tweaking a few assignment numbers is a hard thing to do. Just switch it from 10 ribbons to 10 assists, and lower the 10x 4perks to 1x 4perks... and it might be achievable by natural gameplay instead of wasting full afternoons with something that can't even be described as ""playing"" anymore."

BF_Hardline,36hg8s,DucksRUs281,2,Tue May 19 14:43:12 2015 UTC,"I hate it as well, but im sure Visceral will never delete it :/"
BF_Hardline,36hg8s,demonlag,4,Tue May 19 14:56:32 2015 UTC,"I hate it as well, but im sure Visceral will never delete it :/   Few devs would ever cut something out that they put in.  The armor will probably either remain super unbalanced forever, or get a nerf that makes it completely useless, but it will almost definitely remain in game."
BF_Hardline,36hg8s,xCapTainDuLah,2,Tue May 19 15:22:41 2015 UTC,"I would've preferred that Visceral had actually listened to the community during the beta, and balanced the guns and gadgets before launch. That would've been nice.  But since that didn't happen, my idea for the insert would be to only have the damage reduction of 30% for ARs and SMGs against the insert + mobility decrease. 50% damage reduction against everything is ridiculous."
BF_Hardline,36hg8s,ThatFedexGuy,1 point,Tue May 19 15:38:05 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't mind if it was never in the game, but I highly doubt it will ever disappear completely. I also doubt it will get seriously patched, but I did have an interesting idea about it recently.  I'm sure we all agree that this game is fast paced. Speed is everything. It always determines the victor. You aim first, shoot first, kill first.  Anyway, if people want to absorb damage and still stay alive, let them. But cut their mobility down. Big time. Leave the damage reduction alone, but make them feel like they're wearing goddamn concrete shoes. Make them so slow that they're an easy target. All that damage reduction doesn't mean a thing if you are getting hit by multiple people that are flying all around you.  I'm sick of all these goddamn tanks running around with K10s and armor. They just take all the damage you throw at them and laugh while mowing you down. I'm tired of feeling like I'm forced to use it when I want to use something like the M4/5 or the Uzi just because using one gun all the time is boring, no matter how good it is."
BF_Hardline,36hg8s,ThatFedexGuy,1 point,Tue May 19 22:53:19 2015 UTC,Oh a bit like Payday handles the armor  The heavier the armor the slower you are  maybe also make the player unable to jump/vault?
BF_Hardline,36hg8s,P33KAJ3W,1 point,Tue May 19 22:57:46 2015 UTC,"Sort of. Payday had to handle it that way for a different reason though. Your concealment was something you had to pay attention to for stealth, but hardline doesn't have any need to worry about that.  As for not being able to vault, that seems a little overkill. I'm a player that doesn't really like nerfs, but I understand they are necessary if it throws balance to one side. While armor definitely is way too strong, I don't want to see it get needed to the point that it's unusable. I think just slowing down movement speed by around 40-50% while leaving the damage reduction alone is more than enough."
