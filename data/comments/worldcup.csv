worldcup,3dxqpi,196884,2,Mon Jul 20 15:01:13 2015 UTC,"I just feel that Platini is the wrong man for the job and as too many unanswered questions about his activities. Why did he support the Qatari bid when everyone can see that it is a totally inappropriate place to hold a World Cup.   Surly he should have known,as the President of UEFA, that such a World Cup could not be held in the summer and would have to be moved to winter, which would play havoc with the schedule of all the domestic leagues of Europe.   The fact that his son got the job in Qatar just after it won its bid looks suspicious at best. There are just too too much we don't know about Platini's decisions many of which look highly questionable."

Jozy's issue is that he's had reoccurring hamstring injuries and his most recent was in May, so this tournament was hoping to help build up his strength a bit but he's clearly not ready yet.

worldcup,3co31j,aaninja64,4,Thu Jul 9 14:26:22 2015 UTC,A German team without half its starters is still a pretty fucking good team.  And the talent on the Dutch roster is solid as well.

worldcup,3co31j,Europianist,1 point,Thu Jul 9 22:39:29 2015 UTC,"FIFA's ranking system does not care.  Win or lose, friendlies usually drop a team in the rankings.  You get at least as many points beating any team in the World Cup as you do from beating the #1 team in a friendly.  You get as many points beating the 120th team in the world in a competitive qualification matches as you do beating the #1 team in a friendly.  120th is St. Kitts & Nevis at the moment.  You get as many points by beating the 133rd team in the world in a Gold Cup, Copa America or Euro Cup game as you do beating the #1 team in a friendly."
worldcup,3co31j,dejour,2,Fri Jul 10 03:15:46 2015 UTC,"I get that.  I'm arguing that it's still a good win for the US, not that we should have benefited more from it in the rankings."
worldcup,3co31j,RedUSA,1 point,Fri Jul 10 12:04:21 2015 UTC,"OK.  I definitely agree that beating the Germans in a friendly is impressive.  Personally I think it should have raised the US ranking a little bit.  Not nearly as much as a win over Germany in a World Cup, but it should be a positive.  It's stupid that it actually dropped the US ranking.  That's why I prefer ELO."
worldcup,3co31j,dejour,7,Fri Jul 10 13:55:58 2015 UTC,"If I'm not mistaken, this is a period in the four-year cycle where the European teams (from EURO qualifiers) and the South American teams (from Copa America) have an advantage and tend to surge overall due to all of their high-valued matches.  Winning a continental tournament match is weighted higher than a qualifier, which is weighted higher than winning a friendly.  I imagine the US will see a boost after the Gold Cup regardless of their final place."

It may not necessary validate the team amongst fans, but it does increase respect. Croatia's been on the top 10 for the majority of it's existence (save for the mid to late 2000's). People are always surprised to hear it. ""No way"" they say. Yes, way. Sometimes you can win all the unimportant matches and fuck up the ones that really count. Our fans are notorious for outward braggadocio and inward insecurity; our players always seem to be sober-faced, but they end up playing timidly when the world's watching. That's how you end up as a top 10 team without recognition and with the all too common ""No way"" responses."

Sure we beat #1 Germany and #6 Netherlands but they are friendlies and don't get weighted as heavily. UEFA and CONMEBOL teams have played qualifiers and major tournaments so their performances have a big impact on their rankings.   If the US makes the final of the gold cup and wins it, expect us to jump back up to 20-25 at the next rankings."
worldcup,3coeam,Cougar17,16,Thu Jul 9 16:16:18 2015 UTC,"I'm of the opinion that friendlies shouldn't even count in the standings at all. They are supposed to be a try out game where you try new things, new players and there should never be something connected to it.  but there is... because based on your standing you'll end up in a different group during draft and might end up with a group consisting of 3 major contenders."

worldcup,3coeam,Europianist,5,Thu Jul 9 22:42:03 2015 UTC,"Because the matches that dropped out of our rankings calculations were wins in the 2011 Gold Cup. Those matches are worth far more points than friendlies. When we get this year's Gold Cup results in, things will change significantly"
worldcup,3coeam,etchgtown,2,Thu Jul 9 16:14:16 2015 UTC,"Here's the side-by-side of the games from 2011 that dropped out of our ranking and the new entries. You can tell from this that it's the importance of the games (Gold Cup) that dropped out that makes the difference. When we get this year's Gold Cup results in, things will change significantly."
worldcup,3coeam,etchgtown,2,Thu Jul 9 18:03:04 2015 UTC,"The ranking is based on the results of the last four years. So every month some old matches and results stop being considered. Also official games are worth a lot more than friendlies. So a lot of european countries get buffed during the euro qualifiers the same way concacaf teams get some advantage for a gold cup every two years and teams from other places benefit from some other seasonal events. So probably some official matches from 4 years ago stopped being considered for the US, if it was the 2011 gold cup, in the space of one month the US probably played more matches that were also official than the ones played in the last month. See how Costa Rica and Mexico went down on the rankings as well so my guess is the gold cup was moved by a few weeks and some matches that were considered are not anymore, but next month concacaf teams will go back up a few places."
worldcup,3coeam,ManaStrudel,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:02:00 2015 UTC,"The rankings are basically useless and the USA only played friendlies.  Also, the German 2nd team was playing and the Dutch team is a mess because of their new manager."

worldcup,3coeam,TheStadiaArchitect,8,Thu Jul 9 15:45:47 2015 UTC,"The U.S. didn't necessarily play the same Germany team that won the World Cup.  They played the German second team.

worldcup,3cgvsy,augustfutures,5,Wed Jul 8 00:29:27 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure I'd say ""rightfully so"". Austin has a bigger metro population than OKC, Milwaukee, New Orleans, and other metro areas that support a pro team. Austin also has a higher avg income than many of those. Just because 6 UT football games are played there a year, shouldn't restrict pro teams from eyeing Austin."
worldcup,3cgvsy,AzulCaballero,1 point,Wed Jul 8 01:33:24 2015 UTC,"Well although you're right, there's some other reasons why most pro sports teams wouldn't do well in Austin.   Like I said before, UT is a big issue as it has much of the Austin market for football, basketball, and baseball, and UT would probably ensure no one would encroach on that. Though were talking about pro sports and I'm sure it wouldn't stop them from coming here Austin has too much entertainment and young adults to really have a strong sports market for NFL, NBA, and MLB. For NFL, San Antonio would be a much better target for investors as they already have a NFL stadium built and ready (Alamodome) as well as better demographics for a fan base. NBA wouldn't touch Austin has the other big 3 cities have a team I don't think the MLB holds any appeal to Austin residents. The Express does well, but I couldn't imagine a bigger following than what we already have there. NHL may work, but no one in Austin Texas grows up watching hockey and would take some time for a fan base to grow. The Texas Stars seem to do well if that's indication if me being wrong.   I just wish we had our AFL team back at least."
worldcup,3cgvsy,augustfutures,1 point,Wed Jul 8 02:19:09 2015 UTC,"Agree with most of what you said (especially alternative entertainment for adults - we have the x-games, F1, extraordinary amounts of festivals). But disagree on the SA part. The Alamodome is completely unfit for an NFL team and the avg income of SA is way too low for NFL owners. However, I'd sure drive an hour to see NFL games regularly if that ever happened."
worldcup,3cgvsy,GreenMcQueen,3,Wed Jul 8 04:12:32 2015 UTC,"Austin currently has a soccer (football) club, Austin Astex. I think there has been some good amount of talk at making them pro. Along with that they have been having some plans to give them a stadium as well. This was something I read a couple years ago so I'm not sure where all the talks lay now."

worldcup,3cbswo,e8odie,14,Mon Jul 6 18:10:47 2015 UTC,"I think you are cherry-picking by looking at the United States' tv ratings and not worldwide tv ratings.  There is probably no other country in the world where the women's game can compete with the men's game for viewer interest.  The US is an odd case because the women's team is the odds on favorite to win each World Cup.  And the men's team is not a serious contender.  Additionally, soccer is nowhere near the most popular sport to watch in the United States so names like Messi, Ronaldo and Muller don't draw big ratings.  Patriotism is a bigger factor than name recognition in US viewership and you get patriotism with both genders.  Here's the FIFA tv reports for the 2011 women's world cup and the 2010 men's world cup.  http://www.fifa.com/mm/document/tournament/competition/01/54/91/10/fwwcgermany2011televisionaudiencereport(interactive).pdf  http://www.fifa.com/mm/document/affederation/tv/01/47/32/73/2010fifaworldcupsouthafricatvaudiencereport.pdf  Here's the tv viewership in select countries (figures in millions)    Country 2010 Avg 2010 Peak 2011 Avg 2011 Peak    Germany 8.8 31.9 5.6 17.0   France 4.8 15.2 0.3 3.0   UK 5.3 17.9 0.6 1.7   USA 5.1 24.4 1.3 14.1   Mexico 3.9 22.2 1.3 1.9   Brazil 16.1 49.5 1.1 6.9   China 17.5 66.0 0.8 4.1   S. Africa 4.1 11.6 0.1 1.7   Japan 6.5 45.6 1.6 12.1   S. Korea 2.3 15.7 0.1 0.3   Australia 0.3 1.6 0.0 0.1    I think those were all the countries that were listed in each report.  The average audience for men's World Cup was 74.7 million in those countries.  12.8 million for the women.  So even in these countries the men got 6 times as many viewers.  It's probably a bigger difference overall since the women's report highlighted Norway, Sweden and Canada and ignored Spain, Italy and Argentina.  So maybe overall, the women get 1/10th the viewership of the men.  Does that mean they deserve 1/10th the prize money?  Not necessarily.   There are a lot of fixed costs that go with holding a World Cup.  Overall, I'd expect stadium upgrades to cost more at a men's world cup - but not 10 times more.  If it's just twice as much then that means that stadium costs are proportionally 5 times more for the women's game.  That drives down profits and potential prize money dramatically.  I wouldn't quibble with the prize money for women being increased.  But I think it's quite possible that the prize money-to-profit ratio is actually higher in the women's game than the men's."
worldcup,3cbswo,dejour,3,Mon Jul 6 23:38:56 2015 UTC,"This is the very well-thought out response I was hoping for; thanks. Like I said, I just wanted to look at numbers and I knew there were many other factors out there that need to be taken into consideration.

worldcup,3cbswo,WCephei,30,Tue Jul 7 04:11:57 2015 UTC,"I don't see the point...  This is not a FIFA problem (although they are assholes)  The Men's World Cup is the biggest sporting event and maybe the biggest culture event in the World... billions of people watch it, it is completely reasonable that they will get more paid.  The Women's World Cup has a huge improvement this year, probably the next World Cup they will win much more money."
worldcup,3cbswo,seadondo,9,Mon Jul 6 19:01:31 2015 UTC,"It can be interesting to look at numbers, so I see the point in that.  There is no point in asking why the Men get paid more than the women, just look at the FIFA ad revenue..."

worldcup,3cbswo,corylew,5,Mon Jul 6 20:58:58 2015 UTC,"When you look at these numbers, you can see where the African coach (forget which country) is coming from though. FIFA has money in the bank. They could grow the women's side more if they offered more prize money to competing teams, causing more countries to take it more seriously, causing more fans to take it more seriously.   No one is going to be surprised the men make more. Few people would argue they don't deserve to make money in line with what they earn for FIFA. But being able to look at where the money is coming from, you can find where you could grow the game."

After the way she's called the entire game to make that call on the deciding goal is awful for everyone involved. If England wins congrats but I wish it would've been from better circumstances.
worldcup,3c4fz7,ajetcykowa,4,Sat Jul 4 22:18:52 2015 UTC,"Was a slow motion rugby tackle, easy yellow and had to be a pen seeing as it's in the box, the Germany free kick was bullshit though."
worldcup,3c4fz7,bobcatfisher,6,Sat Jul 4 22:28:26 2015 UTC,"Eh, it was the right call. The only bad part was that it was one of the only times the ref made a right call this game. She shouldve known better than to grab at her in the box. Germany just got lucky the ref lacked the balls to eject a german player during the ensuing arguments. Popp shouldve been at least yellow carded for her reaction."
worldcup,3c4fz7,bluestarz1215,2,Sat Jul 4 22:24:04 2015 UTC,There were shit calls all throughout the tournament but you have to make that call. No-brainer.
worldcup,3c4fz7,Big_Red64,1 point,Sat Jul 4 22:35:28 2015 UTC,"I agree. There were shit calls all game on both teams corny to come to such a drastic call, I'd just ridiculous. Especially when it was such a grey area call. I hate to see high level games come down to stuff like this."
worldcup,3c4fz7,pedrothegator,2,Sat Jul 4 22:22:03 2015 UTC,"Well Germany has had some nice balls but not able to convert into many shots. England has definitely lived up to the game. Second half should be exciting to see some adjustments. Germany needs to be better at get real looks at the goal and not just shooting for the moon, England need better ball control and they could get a deciding goal. This very well could be a 1-0 game in the end."

worldcup,3c4fz7,pedrothegator,1 point,Sat Jul 4 21:38:21 2015 UTC,She lost control the first 15min and has let them beat the crap out of each other. I think the only reason she gave that one was the advantage towards goal.

worldcup,3c4fz7,pedrothegator,1 point,Sat Jul 4 21:10:26 2015 UTC,The ref is letting them play real rough. I thought the shove out of bounds by the England player would've received a yellow but it was barely a foul by this ref.
worldcup,3bwlpu,dainomite,13,Thu Jul 2 19:20:19 2015 UTC,Because they are system player?
worldcup,3bwlpu,postdocdavis,4,Fri Jul 3 05:43:59 2015 UTC,"Different mindset aswell. Perhaps they feel more confident or feel more pride. Also non of them being a super star gives them more freedom on the pitch. Where the superstar strikers will always find themselves heavy marked, therefor giving these ""underdogs"" more space.   Just a thought :)"

worldcup,3bv5xa,CabbagedDaughter,21,Thu Jul 2 17:51:36 2015 UTC,This is the fourth time in 24 years that the USWNT has been in the Women's World Cup Final. It's the second time in a row Japan has played the USA. Hardly once in a lifetime.
worldcup,3bv5xa,brownfield84,7,Thu Jul 2 15:42:39 2015 UTC,"To be fair it may be once in a lifetime for some people.  If you really think about it, everything has to line up to be able to travel to another country and watch a soccer (read futbol) game.  Money, time, lack of responsibility during the game time.  If you take into account those living in the south or southwest, the travel time and cost goes up significantly.  Definitely not strictly once-in-a-lifetime but you may only get one good shot at it.  Plus, who knows if the USWNT will be in the next final, or the one after that etc."
worldcup,3bv5xa,undocumentedredditor,0,Thu Jul 2 21:44:44 2015 UTC,"Feels once in a lifetime for me.

It would still be a once in a lifetime opportunity for most people. The Super Bowl happens every year.  If I got to go to one I would consider it once in a lifetime.  Is your definition of the saying something that there is only one chance to do every hundred years?"
worldcup,3bv5xa,Trashcanman33,2,Thu Jul 2 23:17:12 2015 UTC,"Ha, this is moronic.  USA will probably win the 2016 World Cup, too. ;)"

worldcup,3btjml,optionallycrazy,6,Sat Jul 4 07:43:57 2015 UTC,Just an incredibly unlucky break for Bassett and England.  She made the right play on the ball.  Letting it go through could have led to a score.  It just hit off her foot in just the wrong way to have that happen.  Fluke of bad luck for a very good player to have suffer under.
worldcup,3btjml,MC_Carty,5,Thu Jul 2 18:50:22 2015 UTC,I believe an expert analysis of the game said that even without the own goal accident Japan had a runner coming in from behind who would have probably made the shot.  So it's really unfortunate but I think Japan would have scored anyway.

worldcup,3bspwj,TheSwedishBot,28,Wed Jul 1 21:00:18 2015 UTC,A very painful and sad end to the game for England.
worldcup,3bspwj,gereth,5,Thu Jul 2 00:50:33 2015 UTC,Seems to be common for English teams in semi-finals.
worldcup,3bspwj,LLv2,3,Thu Jul 2 02:19:47 2015 UTC,"England cracking under pressure at the last minute has become such a common thing, most expect it to happen. This is just another black mark to the tally that is England world cups."
worldcup,3bspwj,sbowesuk,3,Thu Jul 2 07:49:47 2015 UTC,At least it wasn't a shootout.
worldcup,3bspwj,EskimoNorth,2,Thu Jul 2 10:47:46 2015 UTC,England didn't crack under pressure.  It was just an incredibly unlucky break.
worldcup,3bspwj,LLv2,0,Thu Jul 2 15:05:08 2015 UTC,"Bad luck? What does luck have to do with kicking the ball into your own goal? It was bad play, plain and simple. Huge mistakes like that are the hallmark of cracking under pressure. England has a history for such ""mishaps"". Just saying."
worldcup,3bspwj,sbowesuk,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:22:54 2015 UTC,"The ball happened to come off her foot in just the right way to go in.  A little to the right and it's a clearance, which is what she was looking for.  Left and the keeper would have played it.  It was a truly amazing strike, if you want to look at it from that perspective.  But since it was not what she was trying to do it was just really bad luck."
worldcup,3bspwj,LLv2,0,Thu Jul 2 19:32:33 2015 UTC,"Every time you try to pin the issue on luck, you're basically saying ball control isn't a factor, which in the context of professional football is retarded. Bottom line is she tried to clear, completely botched it up, and scored an own goal. She lost her composure and sent her team home. The end."
worldcup,3bspwj,sbowesuk,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:41:10 2015 UTC,"You're making an assumption about her emotional state at that moment due to the result.  Had she attempted to call timeout when she had none left and drawn a technical foul that iced the game, that would be loss of composure.  This can be chalked up to pure bad luck.  She probably couldn't have made that strike happen if she had tried."
worldcup,3bspwj,LLv2,0,Thu Jul 2 19:46:42 2015 UTC,"I'm just telling it as I see it. She screwed up at a critical moment, and luck had very little to do with it. When a professional footballer kicks the ball into their own net, that's on them. A professional footballer is too high a level to just shrug their shoulders and say ""Oh, that was unlucky"". Not going to fly. Keep trying though."
worldcup,3bspwj,sbowesuk,0,Thu Jul 2 20:00:44 2015 UTC,So by that logic luck has absolutely nothing to do with outcomes in any professional match.  Sure.

This ref specifically because no  human being with the gift of sight would count that as a foul."
worldcup,3bspwj,Mrs_Damon,4,Wed Jul 1 23:30:33 2015 UTC,"I'm still getting into soccer so I could be wrong on this. But I find it crazy that there is only one referee on the field to make calls. I'm under the impression that all the line judges do is call offsides and not any penalties.   Look at the NBA, that's only 5-5 on a court that could fit inside of a soccer field and you have three refs! I don't see how one ref could possibly see everything on the entire field."
worldcup,3bspwj,burtalert,1 point,Thu Jul 2 11:01:54 2015 UTC,"Dude you have no idea just how frustrating it is that there is only ONE ref for the whole 90+ minute game. Plus IIRC they aren't allowed to watch video replays or anything so essentially they have to go by what they witness, which can lead to extremely shoddy & unfair refereeing.   I understand the argument made that if they have to stop every single time to watch a video replay of whether the ball went passed the goalie line or if that was truly a foul then the time would just keep on going by. But honestly, something has to be done so that they stop giving away penalties left & right when a player is not in the penalty area or if a foul warranted a penalty."

Especially bad as the Japanese coach said this before the game: 'I don't know how England have managed to get this far'  Would have been great to see the smug look drop from his face if they lost :/ Ah well, come on USA!!!"
worldcup,3bspwj,lye_milkshake,6,Thu Jul 2 00:53:43 2015 UTC,Well England made Japan look pretty average so I'm guessing they will get an absolute mullering in the final.

worldcup,3bspwj,sosr,2,Wed Jul 1 23:34:06 2015 UTC,I thought it was like last night. Just outside the box.
worldcup,3bspwj,bluestarz1215,3,Wed Jul 1 23:36:12 2015 UTC,"The initial contact can happen outside the box and escalate to a foul as the players enter the box.  Also, it is important to remember that the line is part of the box.  The saddest part about the 2nd penalty was that it wasnt a question of inside or outside but rather was it a foul at all. Edit: Phrasing?!"
worldcup,3bspwj,areaden1,1 point,Wed Jul 1 23:50:04 2015 UTC,Thanks for the further explanation.
worldcup,3bspwj,bluestarz1215,1 point,Wed Jul 1 23:52:22 2015 UTC,"True, but in this case the only contact was definitely outside the box and there was no further contact inside the box."
worldcup,3bspwj,sosr,2,Wed Jul 1 23:59:59 2015 UTC,"I agree, but I'd rather see a bad call be more about locationon the field that wether or not a foul even occured."
worldcup,3bspwj,areaden1,2,Thu Jul 2 00:07:33 2015 UTC,Me too. I also don't reckon there was much of a foul if at all.

worldcup,3btkno,InReasonWeTrust,5,Thu Jul 2 01:07:52 2015 UTC,"Going through the data of the past 7 World Cups, women have scored about 18% more penalty kicks per game than men.  Penalty kicks scored per game in the 2014 Men's World Cup: 0.19 (12/64)  Penalty kicks scored per game  in the 2010 Men's World Cup: 0.14 (9/64)  Penalty kicks scored per game in the 2006 Men's World Cup: 0.20 (13/64)  Penalty kicks scored per game in the 2002 Men's World Cup: 0.20 (13/64)  Penalty kicks scored per game in the 1998 Men's World Cup: 0.26 (17/64)  Penalty kicks scored per game in the 1994 Men's World Cup: 0.29 (15/52)  Penalty kicks scored per game in the 1990 Men's World Cup: 0.25 (13/52)  Men's total scored per game 1990-2014: 0.217 (92/424)  Penalty kicks scored per game in the 2015 Women's World Cup: 0.34 (17/50)  Penalty kicks scored per game in the 2011 Women's World Cup: 0.12 (4/32)  Penalty kicks scored per game in the 2007 Women's World Cup: 0.22 (7/32)  Penalty kicks scored per game in the 2003 Women's World Cup: 0.25 (8/32)  Penalty kicks scored per game in the 1999 Women's World Cup: 0.22 (7/32)  Penalty kicks scored per game in the 1995 Women's World Cup: 0.27 (7/26)  Penalty kicks scored per game in the 1991 Women's World Cup: 0.35 (9/26)  Women's total scored per game 1991-2015: 0.256 (59/230)  Just going through Wikipedia and Fifa's site briefly, this is what I found. Over the last 3 World Cups, both men and women scored about the same number of penalty kicks. The women this year were given a lot more penalty kicks compared to 4 years ago, but I imagine it's just natural variance.  Penalty kicks scored/awarded in the 2014 Men's World Cup: 12/13  Penalty kicks scored/awarded in the 2010 Men's World Cup: 9/15  Penalty kicks scored/awarded in the 2006 Men's World Cup: 13/17  Total scored 2006-2014: 34  Penalty kicks scored/awarded in the 2015 Women's World Cup: 17/21  Penalty kicks scored in the 2011 Women's World Cup: 4  Penalty kicks scored in the 2007 Women's World Cup: 11  Total scored 2007-2015: 32"
worldcup,3btkno,thelilbearbeeny,3,Thu Jul 2 05:43:24 2015 UTC,part of the variance in the WWC could be that there's more matches played now with more teams. (still not as many as the men's though)

worldcup,3bou03,makeshiftmitten,4,Wed Jul 1 00:56:55 2015 UTC,I'm rooting for the U.S. but that shouldn't have been a penalty kick. Not only was it outside the box but Morgan literally threw herself at the defender
worldcup,3bou03,northsoutheastwest7,4,Wed Jul 1 00:58:30 2015 UTC,"Shouldn't have been a penalty, but the defender definitely stopped Morgan's run forward.  Clear foul."
worldcup,3bou03,GoodLordBatman,3,Wed Jul 1 00:59:08 2015 UTC,"Obviously a foul, but a free kick is far more difficult a scoring chance than a pk."

worldcup,3bou03,vogel81,-2,Wed Jul 1 03:15:24 2015 UTC,"I hate that a semifinals match with such amazing promise had to end with  asterisk next to it in such a good tournament with some pleasantly surprising results like China and Australia even England making it further than ever before. Things are surely looking up for women's soccer and I for one, could not be more excited."
worldcup,3bou03,MeTryingToGetThere,3,Tue Jun 30 23:33:26 2015 UTC,"The asterisk is that a pull down in the middle of the box with a shot on goal about to happen should have been an immediate red card. The PK was missed but the USA should have been playing with ten after that. Not to mention the US PK was from a foul outside the box. That can be overlooked due to the second goal, but the red card not being given can't."
worldcup,3bou03,vogel81,2,Wed Jul 1 01:35:56 2015 UTC,"I thought the Germans could have had a few more yellows for among others the tackles/assaults on Rapinoe. I think if some of those cards were issued Germany would have been down at least a man too. Its often said good and bad decisions even out over time. I thought Germany were very lucky to get by France and USA deserved to get by Germany. But we all see the game differently, fans, referees, pundits etc. Bias etc comes into it. The refs get one look usually at high speed if they are lucky to make a call. The USA penalty is probably reasonable. The non sending off I would like to hear the high level professional refs discuss."
worldcup,3bou03,forgetmemeow90,2,Wed Jul 1 00:52:53 2015 UTC,"• denying an obvious goalscoring opportunity to an opponent moving towards the player’s goal by an offence punishable by a free kick or a penalty kick  Straight from the laws of the game. She was in a 1v1 position against the keeper. The moment that PK came down the red card should have as well. There was pretty obvious intent.   And while I agree Rapinoe was getting bullied, Holiday was reaching over people constantly without calls as well :P"
worldcup,3bou03,GoodLordBatman,1 point,Wed Jul 1 02:53:06 2015 UTC,"I looked back at replays and went back and forth on this. The only thing I can see is, rightly or wrongly, there were a lot of defenders (which I often hear as a reason for yellow not red) around - see how the play ended with a defender close enough to get to and play the ball. Did anyone propose any other reasons for no red other than an error by the ref?"
worldcup,3bou03,makeshiftmitten,2,Wed Jul 1 21:43:22 2015 UTC,The one reason I've heard was because it was a delayed call the fact that the shot missed might have played into the decision. But that still doesn't make the call correct.
worldcup,3bou03,ZMeson,1 point,Thu Jul 2 01:56:34 2015 UTC,"That is an interesting point. Germany scores the pk and the point might be mute - don't think they can blame the ref for the loss. Refs are human - make mistakes just like players and coaches and fans. The players and coaches probably made more mistakes than the officials. If the Germans made less mistakes they might have won. Disclosure - As a referee of youth games I have little time for the ""reff destroyed the game stastements."" Most of my games that do not go well are just as much destroyed by the players, coaches and parents than by lack of perfection."
worldcup,3bou03,AlsoATaco,2,Thu Jul 2 17:15:59 2015 UTC,"But the problem here being that the PK being scored or not isn't the issue. The issue is 11v10 players changes an entire game. Intentional fouls that disrupt a goal scoring opportunity are an automatic yellow. Intentional fouls that disrupt a goal scoring opportunity in the box are an automatic red. I've reffed as well (G6 before I blew my ACL). I understand the nitpicking annoyance and how hard it can be to make calls in real time, which is why the Morgan PK is less of an issue for me. But if you saw the intentional foul. You saw it in the box. And your response was a yellow instead of a red, then you blew it. Maybe it was a 'oh this is the semi-final game I don't want to handicap a side' decision. But it was ultimately the wrong one following the laws of the game."

The fact that FIFA is corrupt, has been for along time, and much of the corruption has occurred while he has been FIFA president. Even if he wanted to clean up the corruption Blatter has no creditability so what is really needed is someone who is considered clean.

USA's defense has been world class this tournament and Hope Solo has barely been tested. So I think they'll get the shutout. A combination of rested players and individual brilliance will result in 2 goals despite Germany looking the better side.   England 2-1 : I haven't watched a lot of the games from this side of the tournament but I'd love to see a England v USA final.   EDIT : YES! One right so far!

USA 3-2 Germany.  Japan's possession dominance will probably be too much for England, and they'll tire and crack eventually, like Australia did. Japan 1-0 England.  Feels weird predicting a repeat final, but it just makes sense."
worldcup,3bgyfg,Saskia_C,4,Mon Jun 29 20:11:09 2015 UTC,So Germany only has a 14% edge over the US and Japan only has a 20% edge over England. I think that one of the two matches will be an upset. I actually hope that both will be upsets because a) I want England to make it to the final and b) I can't stand German egotism.

worldcup,3bcbbt,bluestarz1215,3,Sat Jun 27 23:47:23 2015 UTC,"Just like in hockey. How many times have you seen a team with an excellent chance to score, screw it up, and the other team scores instead?"

worldcup,3bcbbt,fardok,3,Sat Jun 27 23:50:58 2015 UTC,Canada need to have a goal back before the end of the half to have any chance in this game
worldcup,3bcbbt,fardok,3,Sat Jun 27 23:57:15 2015 UTC,Good job. Now get the next
worldcup,3bcbbt,Vytr,3,Sun Jun 28 00:13:39 2015 UTC,There we go! A goal before half :)

worldcup,3bcbbt,fardok,2,Sat Jun 27 22:26:32 2015 UTC,What the hell kind of passing is going on in the back!
worldcup,3bcbbt,Mrs_Damon,2,Sat Jun 27 23:58:20 2015 UTC,The sun is RIGHT in McLeod's line of vision though. Why couldn't they spring to have a cover for the stadium?
worldcup,3bcbbt,OlderThanGif,3,Sun Jun 28 00:01:55 2015 UTC,The stadium has a retractable roof. They just keep it open whenever they can.
worldcup,3bcbbt,Mrs_Damon,2,Sun Jun 28 00:03:37 2015 UTC,Oh they do?? I had no idea.. Is there a reason they don't count sunlight as a reason to close it?
worldcup,3bcbbt,OlderThanGif,6,Sun Jun 28 00:05:13 2015 UTC,"I'm just talking out of my ass here, but I'm guessing artificial ventilation (when the roof is closed) is more expensive and not as pleasant for the fans that just leaving the roof open to get natural ventilation."
worldcup,3bcbbt,Mrs_Damon,3,Sun Jun 28 00:07:03 2015 UTC,"Ahh that actually makes sense, your ass is pretty smart!   Personally I think the audience would gladly use some paper fans to cool themselves down if it meant McLeod would have a fair chance to see the ball coming toward her"

worldcup,3bcbbt,fardok,2,Sun Jun 28 00:50:51 2015 UTC,Poor finishing and basically an inability to make the keeper work is going to cost Canada the game

I had the match on the radio as we stopped for cigs. As I waited for my brother a Japanese family (in the US, I'm a regular white person) heard me listening to it, and the father was very excited and asked if he could listen in for a bit. I cranked the radio and got out of my car to listen to the match for a couple minutes with this stranger. It was very cool.probably not the most exciting story,but I enjoy it."

worldcup,3b8ns2,spoof_spoofaway,5,Sat Jun 27 00:38:32 2015 UTC,Gritty win for the US. Lots of wasted chances. Playing like that against Germany is asking to lose badly.
worldcup,3b8ns2,bluestarz1215,4,Sat Jun 27 01:22:26 2015 UTC,At least they played their best game so far. Much better than Monday. They need to play the same against Germany but they can't waste those chances.
worldcup,3b8ns2,spoof_spoofaway,2,Sat Jun 27 01:24:20 2015 UTC,"They really did. Taking Wambach out was the right move. Her age really is showing and she just hasn't had a good cup. Attackers need to hold onto the ball less and make the extra pass earlier and try not to get fancy on scoring.  That first half blitz is what will help them beat Germany if they can keep it up, but the German's are #1 in the world for a reason."
worldcup,3b8ns2,turnanewleaf1,3,Sat Jun 27 01:33:58 2015 UTC,Why isn't wambach in??
worldcup,3b8ns2,rargar,6,Sat Jun 27 00:35:11 2015 UTC,Because she's played pretty badly this tournament. Will probably come in around the 60th minute though.

worldcup,3b8ns2,readitour,4,Sat Jun 27 00:57:15 2015 UTC,"Honestly, she's old news. Her fitness is very questionable and she's slow as a dinosaur. The US has much better options than wambach. She was subbed in as a novelty for the fans."
worldcup,3b8ns2,9r1fFN3sS,4,Sat Jun 27 01:24:31 2015 UTC,"She's 35. She needs to be rested but with how much we play long balls and crosses, she's one of the best for that. We pressed much better today and there was more energy from the forwards, leading to better counters and not constantly building from the back. It's too late to move away from her when that's what we prepared for and how the run-in to the WC has played out. I don't agree with it but that's the way Jill set up the team."
worldcup,3b8ns2,turkeypants,5,Sat Jun 27 02:02:13 2015 UTC,"Since it sounds like you've got some knowledge and background on the team, I'm interested in your opinion on Rodriguez's performance in this game. She got praise at halftime and afterwards from analysts and coach, but I felt like she played kind of sloppily and recklessly. Forget the first shot, I mean after that. It seemed like she had a number of unforced errors, letting the ball go out a number of times at the touchline via what just looked like poor control, some wayward kicks, etc. She was impressively fast and aggressive, energetic as you say, but she either seemed like she had the jitters or was paying a price in control in exchange for speed and aggression. If the idea was for her to just go all out until she dropped, I can understand that at this stage, but the tradeoff seemed unnecessary a number of times. How'd you view it?"
worldcup,3b8ns2,9r1fFN3sS,1 point,Sat Jun 27 02:43:45 2015 UTC,"I'll agree she had some sloppy play, but that's been the calling card of the USWNT this WWC. ARod's pressing and energy were a huge boost to the team when you usually have a stagnant Abby up top with Alex. I like ARod but I'd rather see Press or LeRoux starting up top if we're locked into the 4-4-2 as it seems. We haven't put anyone under that type of pressure this tournament yet and it won't happen if Abby starts again. She just doesn't have the energy anymore and it's honestly a detriment to the team. Abby brings a ton of positives, but I don't think she should be starting anymore. She would be incredibly valuable as a sub if we need to play more direct, but the future of the women's game is away from that, so I'd like to see us take our advantage and continue to evolve, instead of resting on our laurels. Sorry, I know you asked about ARod, but I think it's more of a ""what she brought that Abby lacks"" than anything else. Just that energy and pressing was absolutely huge, and since everyone has been waiting for something other than lackluster performances, she is rightly getting praise because, even including the errors, that was the best the USWNT has looked this WWC."

worldcup,3b8ns2,rargar,1 point,Sat Jun 27 01:05:09 2015 UTC,"The US player was in an offsides position BEFORE the shot so after the deflection she's unable to play it. However, if the US player left AFTER the player took the shot, then she would be able to play the ball."

worldcup,3b2pu7,ireland1988,19,Thu Jun 25 15:21:11 2015 UTC,"It's blatant cheating.  It's intended to provoke Cavani in hopes that he'll lash out physically.  Why fingers up the butt?  Because the ref can't see it, and it demands a reaction."
worldcup,3b2pu7,chickenmagic,7,Thu Jun 25 17:08:40 2015 UTC,"Aw yea, I didn't think of it like that."
worldcup,3b2pu7,ireland1988,10,Thu Jun 25 17:14:01 2015 UTC,"It's more about the preposterous flop to the ground after Cavani barely touched him which resulted in a second yellow card/red card for Cavani. When crap like that affects the outcome of a pivotal game at this level, it's just embarrassing and shameful."
worldcup,3b2pu7,mrpeatie,6,Thu Jun 25 17:00:34 2015 UTC,True
worldcup,3b2pu7,ireland1988,13,Thu Jun 25 17:13:51 2015 UTC,"I feel bad that I thought it was Cavani's fault all along- just thought he'd lost his temper, but this kind of thing is way beyond crossing a line. I don't know if it would have changed the outcome of the game because Uruguay seemed to maintain their level and intensity for a long while after the sending off, but he should not receive any future match bans."
worldcup,3b2pu7,SamX17,10,Thu Jun 25 15:02:23 2015 UTC,"Did Cavani even actually make contact with Jara?  That was as big a dive as I've ever seen.  EDIT: Yah, he did.  But that's hardly a reason to grab your nose.  What a jerk."

There's a much better level of sportsmanship in their game. Sure pace is a bit slower (debatable) but I haven't yet found myself about to punch out the telly because of things like this.

worldcup,3b2pu7,Zimzams123,-6,Thu Jun 25 23:08:00 2015 UTC,Its easy to be sportsmanlike when your games don't matter
worldcup,3b2pu7,infidel99,8,Thu Jun 25 23:56:59 2015 UTC,"None of it matters, you twit.  It's a game taught in childhood with sportsmanship an important part.  Luckily you aren't the arbiter of the importance of matters."
worldcup,3b2pu7,Zimzams123,-8,Fri Jun 26 01:22:18 2015 UTC,"None of it matters   Clearly you have no understanding of the role that football plays in south american culture. Add on the fact that winning this tournament is not just a personal achievement but a source of national price to the very, very large sums of money these players get paid as well as every other incentive they have to win... Well lets just say Women's football is nowhere near. (and even then im being nice)  One last thing, sportsmanship being thrust upon the game is a very recent thing - and if you ask any pro how they got good, none will tell you it was by being nice to their opponents and always letting the other guy go first."
worldcup,3b2pu7,infidel99,-1,Fri Jun 26 01:32:50 2015 UTC,That says a lot about South American men. A lot that saddens me.  I hope you evolve soon.  You obviously take no pride in your women.
worldcup,3b2pu7,Fappity_Fappity_Fap,2,Fri Jun 26 03:59:45 2015 UTC,"It's not that we don't take pride in our women, it's just that women football is to people here something akin to women hockey or basketball, for example, in other regions, everyone knows it to exist and that it is just as enjoyable as the men's counterpart (even if for different reasons, game-wise) but remains something most overlook simply because the male game has more ""fame, money, tradition, (possibly) blood and glamour"" to it. Not even mentioning that only recently football had been starting to lose the status of being a sport that mostly only men enjoy, imagine when the same happens to, say, American football in the US or rugby in Australia, it'll probably follow the same way women footy is going in S.America."

worldcup,3b2pu7,GracchiBros,6,Fri Jun 26 01:17:47 2015 UTC,And here's why football has become too strict.  It gives incentives for players to provoke.  The fix is to roll the rules back some and let players take care of things on the pitch to a certain extent.

worldcup,3b2pu7,eliterivera,-7,Thu Jun 25 23:18:50 2015 UTC,"If they're opening an investigation on Jara, they should also open investigations for Gimenéz, Muslera and Godín for insulting and pushing the assistant referee.  Uruguayans need to learn how to lose, they've been doing this for years and nobody bats an eye, but when someone does it against them they are instantly crucified.  Of course what Jara did was unacceptable, but the way Uruguay has been playing all this time doesn't give them the right to appeal."
worldcup,3b2pu7,tokewithnick,6,Thu Jun 25 15:10:59 2015 UTC,"Agreed. I think we're overlooking how Uruguay played throughout the whole game. Horrible behavior, aggressive playing even to the point of trying to injure the players, pushing/insulting the referees. Completely unnaceptable."
worldcup,3b2pu7,justawildguess,-6,Thu Jun 25 17:00:45 2015 UTC,"Totally predictable. That's how Uruguay plays every game. They have some talent, but when they lose, they always lose ugly. Cavani is no stranger to cheap bullshit, himself. Always dragging, grabbing and then whining that they didn't call the defender for it.  That's no excuse for Jara's maneuver, but it couldn't happen to a more deserving squad."
worldcup,3b2pu7,marreco_marrento,2,Thu Jun 25 18:14:22 2015 UTC,"We got to learn to define what is from the game and what isn't. Doing ""catimba"" (what south americans call what you called 'uruguayan behavior') is part of the game. What Jara did isn't."

This Friday's game is going to be broadcasted on the normal Fox station. I saw USA vs Nigeria also on my local Fox station.
worldcup,3as9qt,taris300,7,Tue Jun 23 12:28:49 2015 UTC,"Every USA game should have been on regular Fox 4.  The Nigeria game, sure, but this Colombia game was a knockout game and I only had access to shit streams from my house."
worldcup,3as9qt,chickenmagic,2,Tue Jun 23 13:43:00 2015 UTC,"I get it. I'm one of the lucky ones to have Fox Sports to watch the games. Fox did however buy the rights to broadcast the game, so technically they can decide if it's in their best financial interest to show the game. We can be mad at Fox and choose not to support or watch their shows in protest, but it is theirs to determine what to do with it.   Problem is, it's not just soccer. WNBA is rarely ever shown on normal channels, yet the NBA is constantly. It just seems that some people just don't pay as much attention to women's sports, and that's just a problem/choice of society as a whole.   For example, a female co-worker who watched every men's WC game (she loves soccer), hasn't watched any women's WC at all. I've jokingly called her out for being sexist, but the sad state is people just don't seem to be as interested in women's sports for whatever reason. This plays a big factor in Fox choosing to show it on their normal stations or the specialty stations. Unless we as a society treat women's sports on the same interest level as men's, we will run into problems like this in the future for soccer or any sport for that matter."

There's a local broadcast company in your area that is affiliated with Fox, and broadcasting on channel 4 where you live.  It's not universal, therefore your statement that ""every USA game should be on regular Fox 4"" will sound a little bizarre, especially to those who don't have a ""Fox 4"" in their area.  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_affiliate"

On top of that i know some of the players already, and there's a high chance that ill see some of the players in a few years playing for the national team so there's extra incentive there. I may tune in for the Women's finals maybe, but other than that i honestly don't care for watching League 1 level football just for the novelty value that its Women playing."

The US Women's team has dominated the sport because title 9 created equal opportunities for women's sports since the 1970s and the 1970s were not that long ago compared to the men's world cup.  The level of play will continue to get better but it will plateau at a point because the money just isn't going to be there for trainers and facilities."

You're educated enough on the topic for such a minor detail to matter.  Now look at the average / almost / potential consumer.  Does turf affect their ability to watch the game?  The US population cares more about games in our country but I think a bigger issue is the lack of pre-tournament hype for the US due to injuries and not trying to create unrealistic expectations.  The lack of buildup directly translates to less tournament energy among casual fans and the like."

As has been noted soccer already has fewer commercial breaks so you have to get a major uptick in viewers vs standard broadcast for it to be worthwhile.  If you really want to watch sports, odds are you have a cable package w/ sports channels.  The prime audience of WWC is people who want to watch sports and therefore likely have the package.  Pushing it to the main network will get you some more standard viewers but significantly less than would watch standard broadcast on that network.

worldcup,3as9qt,nvn88,2,Wed Jun 24 00:20:46 2015 UTC,"A women football game has no appeal in EU simply because football is so so widely played that a man playing in the lowest category can already compete vs a woman  playing on the national team.

Women soccer is just bad to watch if you are used to something like top tier European football."
worldcup,3as9qt,infidel99,0,Wed Jun 24 03:14:01 2015 UTC,So...because it started as a man's sport the men have played longer and are better.  Now the women are playing and I think your sexist remarks about high school males being better that top tier women is typical male European bullshit.  Lady Andrade dances on that ball like a ballerina.  Le Sommer of France is amazing.  I'm also totally enjoying the lack of drama and flops.  The men bring one style of play and the women another.

worldcup,3ardv3,DinosaurPizza,6,Tue Jun 23 00:05:31 2015 UTC,"If you're referring to Abby Wambach's tap in, it's because she was offsides. The forwards can't be closer to the goal then the defenders when the ball is passed to them. That's why in replays they slow down the footage when the ball leaves one player's foot for the pass, they're comparing where the offsides player was in comparison to the defenders when the pass was made.  In that instance, Wambach was clearly past the defenders, so she was declared offsides."
worldcup,3ardv3,bluestarz1215,8,Tue Jun 23 00:15:09 2015 UTC,I'm not sure what people are arguing about. She was offside by a country mile.

worldcup,3aq7du,Rufus_Reddit,7,Tue Jun 23 23:53:16 2015 UTC,"I am from England and in my opinion it is because the women's game is of a very poor standard, probably worse than our men's non-league/tier 6 semi-professional level, which incidentally gets far less coverage than the Women's World Cup on TV and very few Guardian articles questioning why!   Lots of boys in England want to be professional footballers and unless you are exceptional you find out very early (probably by age 9 or 10) that it isn't going to happen for you. You have to be a bloody good player to even get to the aforementioned tier 6, non-league level. The same isn't true for girls, there aren't the sheer numbers of girls who want to be professional footballers hence why the relative quality isn't as high."
worldcup,3aq7du,crumbzilla,1 point,Mon Jun 22 21:12:54 2015 UTC,"That's a big truth that many are afraid to come out and say.  I respect women's football, I just don't enjoy watching it at all. It's a much slower, much less entertaining version of men's football.  If I wanted to watch football of a similar standard I would watch a relatively good amateur club play at the weekend for free. Why would I pay to see someone else play the same standard?"
worldcup,3aq7du,newls,5,Mon Jun 22 22:12:31 2015 UTC,"I regard the distinction as being the same as watching womens tennis.  The Williams sisters would get crushed by a male ranked in the top 200 (and did once -- he was slightly drunk, too) but they're still a lot of fun to watch.    I saw womens Olympic matches in '96 at RFK, and this after also having seen mens WC matches there two years earlier in '94.  What struck me was that the goalie couldn't kick the ball for a clear nearly as far as a mens goalie, but I was really impressed by their athleticism."
worldcup,3aq7du,IvyGold,1 point,Mon Jun 22 23:29:29 2015 UTC,"Exactly. I would estimate that about 100 lads in my school year were really into football, some of them ran rings around the others. The best player we had was on the books of a League 1 side at youth level. He was noticeably better than everyone else, but he got dropped by the club he was at and ended up playing for some tier 8/9 sides on an occasional basis as an adult. This lad was the best out of 100 lads, and still nowhere near professional standard. For me that illustrates the mountain that women's football would have to climb to match the standard, quite frankly I don't think it is ever going to happen."
worldcup,3aq7du,crumbzilla,6,Tue Jun 23 06:20:47 2015 UTC,"I am a really big fan of international women's football but I can sort of understand why for some games but not others, the games on at audience friendly times have been well covered with top tier commentators but just on bbc3 (which is supposed to be the channel for 'youth').   In fact, the Women’s World Cup - which is predicted to set a new attendance record of 1.25 million - is seemingly a big deal everywhere but the UK.   I don't think this is true and countries like the US, Sweden, Norway, Canada, Germany, perhaps France and maybe Japan(?) where women's football is already kind of big (and/or teams are successful) and there is a bigger existing audience are the exception. The US is interesting because football has been sort of seen as a traditionally female sport, there are a huge number of girls who play football (I think it's the #1 sport for girls by participation) and this is obviously the basis for a big audience and big players becoming famous stars etc.   there were twice as many readers in the US for the women’s team’s victory over Australia this month than there was for the men’s team win over world champions Germany.    I mean comparing a friendly and a world cup match isn't exactly the same but I guess I see the authors point, iirc in the last women's world cup final a slim majority of the TV audience were men in the US.   In Britain this didn't happen, even though the gender split for fans may be as much as 40% female, it has been hard for women's football to compete with the more established men's game. I imagine that there isn't the audience to justify getting the schedule  out of time for such a long time, It will clearly change if England are successful though, if they beat someone 5-0 it probably would be on the back pages of at least some tabloids.   But It has annoyed me that they've put the games on in the late night on the red button channel, when there is basically reruns or nothing on the main ones and it's weird how they find the time in the schedule for snooker and golf which I seriously doubt are that much more popular than the wwc."

Asking this is is like asking 'why is Basketball more popular in America than Kazakhstan?

Now that would get people watching."

We were talking about the Women's World Cup, and, while things may have changed during his absence from the UK, or, perhaps it was only this way in his region of England, he said that often women don't play sports very much in England, unlike women do here in the US as it's very much a men's tradition there.

Regardless though, actions off the field are about being a good role model and should have nothing to do with being allowed into the games.  That should be the team/manager's decision.

Yeah, its easy to see stuff from multiple camera angles, but the refs on have one, if they are shieldes what so you want then to do? I think in men's they have another ref at the goalie box but in women's they don't."
worldcup,3aepsq,mero8181,8,Sat Jun 20 01:00:24 2015 UTC,"No, the refs have been consistently awful.  Missing blatant hand balls, easy offsides.  Refs should never be the story in a match, and they have been a major story."

worldcup,3aepsq,shapu,-2,Tue Jun 23 03:30:49 2015 UTC,"Not from the games I have seen. The missed hand balls are because of position. If the red can't see if they can't call it. Seeing many angles of it make it obvious but you have to keep that in mind in relation to where the ref was. I have seem some amazing offside calls. Ones where I knew they got it wrong, then replay showed nope they had i t right. The issues is no ref in the box like the men have."

None would play Canada before the semifinal.  Canada could lose to any team among England, Norway and Switzerland.  But considering home field advantage Canada is probably the most likely team to make the semifinal from that group of 4.  I'd say around 35% chance Canada makes it to the final 4.

You can't have a squad full of 23 and 24 year olds and no leadership.  You can't abandon Dempsey, Beckerman and Wondo just because they are likely too old for the next world cup, and forgo all the hard work and years they've put into this country and team.  They are still in good form and should remain on the squad as long as possible, AT LEAST to teach the younger guys something if nothing else.  Bobby Wood scored his 2 goals against Ned. and Germany AFTER the 35 man squad was named.  For the Gold Cup, it is best to be ""shortsided"", even though I think that is a horrendous description of what JK is doing.  The goal isn't winning the Gold Cup, the goal is getting to the Confederations Cup and facing tougher opponents.    Finally, advancing far in the world cup isn't going to bring the most supporters and young talent to the squad.  It is winning things like Gold Cup, Confed.

worldcup,3aba0e,massivescoop,7,Thu Jun 18 19:44:10 2015 UTC,So what should have happened? because I can tell you that the grass used in a lot of former Canadian stadiums was pretty terrible. Nevermind the training grounds.
worldcup,3aba0e,TomServoMST3K,3,Thu Jun 18 19:46:38 2015 UTC,"grass can be done properly, you just have to put the resources into it. It is an equity issue because FIFA won't do it."

This is not the same thing as Qatar, where there are other countries ready, willing and able to host the games who were bypassed.  The decision is not equivalent.

This isn't men vs women... this is a business decision.  There was no country in the world willing to outlay the costs necessary to hold the tournament in an equivalent fashion to the men's tournament.  And there is a very good reason for that.  Lack of Return on Investment.  Wambach (and others who complain) should work on making the women's game more popular and that would lead to higher investment in it.  Same thing as MLS... you want to replace the field turfs with grass, get your sport to a place where the investment makes sense.  In some cities they have, in others they haven't.  And thats the men's game not the womens"
worldcup,3aba0e,Commandant1,-1,Thu Jun 18 19:59:26 2015 UTC,"That's the wrong way to think about this.  Fifa exists to promote soccer full stop, not men's soccer or the most profitable soccer."

Return on investment is important for me.  FIFA doesn't spend much on these tournaments, its the host countries that do.  And I don't want my government wasting hundreds of millions to renovate stadiums that will have little practical use after the tournament.  Sorry.  Full Stop."
worldcup,3aba0e,Commandant1,-2,Thu Jun 18 20:09:51 2015 UTC,"That's fine, then Canada shouldn't host."

Comparing between men's and women's games is just going to turn into a clusterfuck so let's not go there.  I guess the only way to solve this to host it in the US every 4  years.  more attendance and in turn, can pay for the expenses."
worldcup,3aba0e,csnv,3,Fri Jun 19 21:02:45 2015 UTC,so you agree with Blatter that women should only get equal treatment when they become as popular as the men?
worldcup,3aba0e,massivescoop,-1,Fri Jun 19 23:14:58 2015 UTC,"see you miss the point.  women socccer is not the same as men soccer, it is almost a completely different sport (and i'm not talking about the rule book, throw that shit out, a sport is bigger than that), the community (seeing the empty seats at the most important tournament, or even reddit game threads...), the way it runs, the sponsors, the way it competes.. and i'm not here to debate that with you or anyone else.  it's going to be a bloodbath.  if Wambach were going to ask for grass, she'll have to do without mentioning the men (which they all did including you and i think that's not a valid point).  whatever she said is invalid."

For instance, let's assume the best third-placed teams are from groups A,B,D, and F. The brackets are [ABC], [BCD], [CDE], and [DEF]. That means that on the third bracket [CDE], D is the only qualified team. Then you eliminate D from all the other brackets and you are left with [ABC], [BC], [EF].

worldcup,3a1m3k,jayjaywalker3,4,Tue Jun 16 19:35:20 2015 UTC,It tough at high speeds.  For me reffing in the box I better be 100% sure on that call expecially for a handball.

worldcup,3a1m3k,roguedevil,1 point,Tue Jun 16 20:13:15 2015 UTC,"so to play devils advocate here,  the ref in that game had like 4 players screen her from where the handball happened.  She was in a great position to see if it but sometimes stuff like this happens, the AR probably should have seen it though.  That being said, people that always just say the refs are shit and terrible need to maybe take a second and look at the whole situation and not just the 16th angle in slow-mo that shows it.  And before people jump on the whole ""we should use video replay then"" argument, the rules would have to be completely reworked to allow for video replays.  Its not as easy as just saying stop play and go to replay."
worldcup,3a1m3k,mbackflips,1 point,Tue Jun 16 20:33:36 2015 UTC,"I'm against video technology for these types of situations. It really should have been called though, even if the ref was screened, she should have been in a position where a handball this blatant cannot be missed. Even from behind, it's clear the Colombian defender moves her hand toward the ball and though contact would be difficult to see, she should have the common sense to know that there's no way the ball leave's the French strikers head in that direction without being redirected."

worldcup,3a1m3k,madman1101,10,Tue Jun 16 23:26:45 2015 UTC,This type of shit happens when you don't have rules that include replay review/nullification of goals. Robben's critical dive in the WC that lead to a penalty is another shining example.  If this happened in hockey the penalty wouldn't have even happened. Terrible for the Kiwi squad... but you either need to change the rules of the sport or accept that refs make critically shitty calls in big games.

But a good number should reach it:   England are all but qualified Wales have a little bit of work to do but if they can get four points from their matches at Cyprus and vs. Israel they should be in. I think it's effectively a toss-up between Northern Ireland and Hungary for Group F's second automatic spot, and the match in Belfast on Sept. 7 (which Northern Ireland probably only needs to draw) should decide things.  But at worst N. Ireland will take third in the group.  Faroe Islands are the current fourth place team, and despite how surprising they've been they're still 7 points back from N. Ireland. If Scotland and Ireland are both going to have a shot at qualifying, both need to beat Poland.  Or, both need to beat Germany (not that far of a stretch considering Ireland drew away to Germany and Scotland played a fantastic match, losing only by 1).  If they don't, it's a straight battle between them for third and the playoff spot, a battle Scotland has a 2-point advantage in and a slightly easier schedule for."

No Oscar and Luiz Gustavo is a pretty significant blow, although I prefer Coutinho starting in Oscar's place.   The 2002 team was amazing, but it's easy to say that in hindsight. Ronaldo and Rivaldo were hail Mary types dealing with major injuries. There was no forward depth. And Roque Junior may have been worse than David Luiz. Still was a great team and one of my favorites, but it was miraculous performance in the end."

But,   During the intermission, goalkeeper Erin McLeod was approached by one of the referee’s assistants inside the Canadian locker room. The linesman said [to McLeod] “You have to hurry up your kicks.”   Then you subsequently get called for a delay of game for taking 12 seconds for a goal kick. It's so easy to scapegoat Wambach here, but after being warned by the referee, there's no excuse.  I'd also disagree that it's the ""Greatest Game of Women's Soccer Ever Played."" Canadian WoSo? Sure."
worldcup,39q5st,tychomarx,5,Sat Jun 13 19:36:34 2015 UTC,"What's your pick for greatest game ever played?  Sure this one is easy for Canadians to pick.  But 4-3 with goals being traded back in forth, controversial refereeing decisions, extra time, late goals in regular time and extra time, a championship berth on the line... It really had it all.  Coverage from neutrals was pretty enthusiastic.  eg.  http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/aug/06/olympics-2012-football-usa-canada-live  The 1999 Women's World Cup win was iconic for many Americans.  But that was 0-0 and decided on penalties.  2011 Women's World Cup Final?"

If you are judging on the pure skill demonstrated by the two teams, then Canada-USA was not that game.  Canada didn't play that well - Sinclair just finished her chances.  The US didn't play as well as they normally could either."

It's just so jumpy and tangential. So far, there have been no comparisons to Mia Hamm? Ok, she's been retired for 10 years. Many comparisons are made to male soccer players from the same country, which some players don't prefer. But, Messi is one female players role model?

It really helps to draw an emphasis on star female players which otherwise I wouldn't have a clue about. We have to accept female football isnt as big as male football which is the biggest sport in the world bar none, played by virtually all countries. This type of comparison will help female football get new fans until they are popular enough to have world famous superstars on their own.  It's not a matter of sexism or feminism.

During a freekick, instead of waiting for the players to go back behind her arm or where she shows them to go, she draws the line where they have to stand imediately while the players are still standing in front of her.   This is exactly what I wanted referees to do this entire football season, no long waiting for players to finally go back because now they have to go back behind the line that is already there. Also no fighting for centimeters as the referee has to put the line in front of the players feet. This referee is exactly what I want others to be like, at least in that regard."

worldcup,39jvpv,etchgtown,2,Fri Jun 12 14:14:49 2015 UTC,Easier in the women's game because the players are shorter but the goal is the same height though.

I think ""insane"" is overkill, but in a month, we may look back and say this was the best goal of the tournament. It also for me gets a little boost from its context: it forced a draw against what is likely to be the top team in the tournament.  What I think keeps me from saying ""insane"" or whatever is that it is a top-notch execution of a conventional skill, and there should be room beyond it for a top-notch execution of an unconventional skill, along the lines of Cahill against Holland or van Persie against Spain."

A lot of the issues that the USWNT had in their opening game and warm-up friendlies persisted in this match. But this performance wasn’t all bad, and U.S. fans shouldn’t get down on their chances to win the Women’s World Cup quite yet.  Two games into the World Cup, the USWNT have already played two of the toughest opponents they’ll see in the tournament. It’s unlikely that the Americans run into better teams than Sweden or Australia in their first two knockout stage games, and if they put in repeat performances over their next three matches, they’ll get to the semifinal. It would be disappointing to see the U.S. limp their way to the final four, then bow out when they came up against France or Germany, but that currently looks like a near-worst-case scenario."

worldcup,395z1f,BanksKnowsBest,56,Tue Jun 9 14:27:06 2015 UTC,"Watching the games, it's clear that turf has been a disaster for the quality of play. I see lots of passes missing their marks, going way too far, taking weird bounces, etc. And this is from the top teams in the world (Germany, US). You don't see these kinds of mistakes when these teams are playing on natural pitch, but they're all over the place in Canada so far.  Turf sucks."
worldcup,395z1f,manuscelerdei,19,Tue Jun 9 16:04:59 2015 UTC,Maybe Germany wasn't the best example.   10-0 annihilation.
worldcup,395z1f,PerendiaEshte,7,Tue Jun 9 16:57:07 2015 UTC,"The German game actually points to a different phenomena related to turf:    So, 4.6 goals per game in the Women's World Cup so far, versus 2.7 in 2011. And FIFA claims playing on turf doesn't matter?"
worldcup,395z1f,DinosaurPizza,10,Tue Jun 9 18:16:29 2015 UTC,I think that's more related to expanding to 24 teams.  There's more disparity between the top and bottom teams in this tournament.  And that can lead to 10-0 scores.
worldcup,395z1f,dejour,16,Tue Jun 9 19:45:33 2015 UTC,"Nate silver should be ashamed of himself, that's a joke. Talk about a small sample size...   Was a 1-0 win by Japan also due to turf?   So expanding the tournament from 16 to 24 has no consequence?"
worldcup,395z1f,faizimam,4,Tue Jun 9 19:40:12 2015 UTC,Did all qualifying matches take place on turf too? That would make a much more reasonable sample.
worldcup,395z1f,adamtola,3,Tue Jun 9 21:07:18 2015 UTC,They didn't. I'd be surprised if anything close to 1% of qualifying games were played on turf.
worldcup,395z1f,CeterumCenseo85,3,Tue Jun 9 21:19:11 2015 UTC,"I think there are other factors than simply the turf.  Like /u/dejour said, there is a biggest spread but I also thinks it's because we are still in group play.  Once we get into stage play, the games will be much tighter, and most likely much lower scoring."
worldcup,395z1f,slccsoccer28,2,Tue Jun 9 22:00:24 2015 UTC,I think we need a larger sample size.
worldcup,395z1f,PerendiaEshte,9,Tue Jun 9 19:48:45 2015 UTC,"Weird bounces?  I could buy that people aren't getting the right amount of force on their passes, and that turf is leading to overhitting or underhitting the ball.  But a clear advantage of turf is that there won't be lumpy parts of the field."
worldcup,395z1f,dejour,12,Tue Jun 9 17:32:33 2015 UTC,I think he meant on bouncing balls. I saw a lot of balls with spin on them landing and taking unnatural bounces. Catching the rubber and bouncing backwards and such.
worldcup,395z1f,FavresADouche,8,Tue Jun 9 19:51:41 2015 UTC,"And it's difficult to estimate how high a ball will bounce on the turf sometimes. When you're used to playing on grass, you get a natural feel for how high the ball bounce. On turf it changes completely, and it's hard to know where you need to be in order  to win the ball."
worldcup,395z1f,Sooner_,1 point,Tue Jun 9 21:12:49 2015 UTC,A large percentage of these players haven't played on fields that have any lumps or irregular areas in quite some time. You most certainly wouldn't prepare for it at WC event.
worldcup,395z1f,kensal78,0,Tue Jun 9 21:13:05 2015 UTC,I'm surprised you all are surprised. FIFA sucks. The end.
worldcup,395z1f,MutedMuppet,19,Tue Jun 9 22:35:33 2015 UTC,"I don't even have a response for people that try and defend turf. A poorly maintained grass field is not only safer, but more comfortable for the player then even the greatest, most modern synthetic turf. the first slide on any turf removes skin layers. Watching the WWC and seeing those tire bits spray in the air is just cringe-worthy. If you disagree with AW about it being a nightmare, you need to re-evaluate your sources."
worldcup,395z1f,kensal78,12,Tue Jun 9 21:16:22 2015 UTC,Yeah it sucks but where is the money coming from to outfit all these stadiums with real grass? Canada has a fierce winter season to contend with and was the only nation to offer a bid to host. Is the money from the women's world cup event 'equal' to the mens world cup? Will a lawsuit encourage future host nations from bidding?
worldcup,395z1f,fuzzby,12,Tue Jun 9 22:01:26 2015 UTC,"I read it was estimated at $6 million to replace the turf with grass at all venues. FIFA, who take almost all the profit from the WC, have a reserve find of over $1.4 billion."
worldcup,395z1f,FavresADouche,-8,Wed Jun 10 00:59:10 2015 UTC,Heh. That's like saying Federal tax brought in 3 trillion dollars last year; why are there still shitty schools and homeless people?
worldcup,395z1f,fuzzby,7,Wed Jun 10 01:18:51 2015 UTC,I've played soccer all my life including college and semi-pro. I personally think turf is safer. I love turf for the fast pace and consistency. Yea turf burns suck but they heal fast and they don't really affect your playing as much as a twisted ankle which seems to happen more on grass fields. I really don't understand the hate for turf.
worldcup,395z1f,swg1324,-6,Tue Jun 9 22:09:02 2015 UTC,I don't even have a response for people that try and defend turf
worldcup,395z1f,kensal78,7,Tue Jun 9 22:46:23 2015 UTC,"I won't defend the professional level but being an amateur goalkeeper, I 100000x prefer playing on artificial turf. On public fields the goal area inevitably ends up with dirt patches like this, which cause unpredictable bounces and scratch up legs and arms far worse than modern turf."
worldcup,395z1f,Poison_Pancakes,0,Tue Jun 9 23:01:18 2015 UTC,"Interesting. I play goalkeeper as well and greatly prefer anything but turf. I'm quite familiar with those patches your picture shows and in my games (amateur and college) those often were muddy or otherwise wet. I think I'd agree with you that the casual soccer player who doesn't exert themselves probably thinks turf is fine because it's clean and flat and there's no risk of injury or exertion because they only play once a week and don't overextend themselves. That would make sense. At the higher levels, turf is a killer. Good luck in your games. Goalies need to stick together."

worldcup,395z1f,swg1324,-2,Tue Jun 9 23:16:07 2015 UTC,From your article; The higher incidence of ankle sprain on artificial turf warrants further attention.    Also - your articles are 10 years old. That's typically considered no longer reputable.
worldcup,395z1f,kensal78,5,Tue Jun 9 23:18:46 2015 UTC,Did you even read the article??? It was statistically insignificant. Those same articles have been updated and republished in 2013 and 2014. Where is your proof?
worldcup,395z1f,swg1324,-2,Tue Jun 9 23:27:21 2015 UTC,"Show me where it was republished - your articles say 2005 and 2006. And two of the articles clearly state there's a higher incidence of ankle sprain.    College football players suffer knee injuries about 40 percent more often when playing on an artificial turf versus grass, according to a U.S. study. http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/05/01/us-football-idUSBRE84002Q20120501"
worldcup,395z1f,kensal78,3,Tue Jun 9 23:45:23 2015 UTC,"""This doesn't say there's conclusive evidence that turf increases the injury rate, but maybe we can say it's not as safe as we thought it was,"" he told Reuters Health."" - from your article.   Also football and soccer can be very different. If you click on the authors name it takes you to their other articles. I'm on my handy and its too hard going back and fourth.

worldcup,395z1f,swg1324,15,Tue Jun 9 23:57:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it would be nice if the women ""deserved"" to play on grass. Grrr."
worldcup,395z1f,Spikekuji,7,Tue Jun 9 14:53:47 2015 UTC,"It seems normal to me.  Maybe it's because I watch MLS and see games played on turf regularly.  Also as a rec league player usually the nicest surface to play on for me is turf.  Of course, maybe it's just because I haven't been exposed to immaculately maintained grass fields."
worldcup,395z1f,dejour,10,Tue Jun 9 17:27:37 2015 UTC,I've been against turf since my days of rec league football on turf fields. A big section of skin on my calf just rubbed off getting tackled at full sprint. Left a trail of blood to the bathroom. Not the sort of thing I've experienced playing on grass.
worldcup,395z1f,JamesHouse,12,Tue Jun 9 18:00:50 2015 UTC,"My anecdotal experience is different - most of my blood has been caused by sliding over hardened dirt.  I sometimes get a ""burn"" on artificial turf.  I'm glad I didn't get a huge section of skin ripped from my calf.   Sounds painful.  I'd guess that the fields should be ranked as follows:   well maintained grass field modern generation field turf poorly maintained grass field old school artificial turf   Generally I end up playing on #2 or #3, so I tend to prefer #2.  But if I was elite, I guess I'd be choosing between #1 and #2, and then I'd be more in favour of grass."
worldcup,395z1f,dejour,3,Tue Jun 9 18:12:35 2015 UTC,"Yes, modern turf is very different than the astroturf most are used to seeing. Bounce is firmer but not much different than a dry field and much more consistent. It's actually a very consistent surface in regards to bounce and spin, compared to grass, but the bounce IS different.    I've played rugby on modern turf and it's not bad, although if I were playing soccer I would have my socks high and sliders low to minimize potential burn spots."
worldcup,395z1f,youonlylive2wice,10,Wed Jun 10 14:47:45 2015 UTC,I remember playing on grass exclusively as a kid. One year we got a tournament that played at a major University's soccer 'stadium'. We were really pumped to play in that venue. It felt like big time. Then we showed up and it was turf. We might as well have been playing on the concrete parking lot behind the middle school. Even as kids we knew Turf is a fuck abomination.
worldcup,395z1f,MulderD,6,Tue Jun 9 19:14:22 2015 UTC,Different experience for me. Every turf field I've been on has been significantly better than the mix of dirt and weeds I've dealt with in local parks.
worldcup,395z1f,faizimam,3,Tue Jun 9 19:42:15 2015 UTC,But no one is arguing for the World Cup to be played at a local park.
worldcup,395z1f,FavresADouche,2,Tue Jun 9 19:53:08 2015 UTC,"Funny thing actually.   Fifa regulations require that every team have access to adequate practice facilities during a world cup, so as part of our preparations the 6 Canadian cities spent quite a bit of money to invest in new or improved turf fields and facilities around the city.   I'm in Montreal, and Those fields will allow for high quality play for more of the year and likely have a substantial benefit for our youth development long term.   Turf will leave a much better long term legacy for Canada than grass would."

worldcup,395z1f,faizimam,2,Tue Jun 9 23:11:08 2015 UTC,"Except it doesn't at all. The stadiums weren't built for the world cup, they all already had field turf, and FIFA didn't want to spend the $6 million to change to grass."
worldcup,395z1f,FavresADouche,2,Tue Jun 9 23:32:02 2015 UTC,"I am not speaking about the stadiums, you are correct on that. I'm speaking of the 18 practice fields (3 per city) built/renovated in various communities.   As a resident of one of them, I am happy for the additional investment."
worldcup,395z1f,faizimam,1 point,Wed Jun 10 01:24:02 2015 UTC,I'm sure modern turf is great. But when I played it was essentially a half inch layer of green plastic without a discernible surface texture and it was right on top of concrete.
worldcup,395z1f,MulderD,1 point,Tue Jun 9 19:54:29 2015 UTC,Modern turf is about as different as what you played on as grass and dirt.
worldcup,395z1f,youonlylive2wice,2,Wed Jun 10 14:48:35 2015 UTC,I believe when they're talking about safety they're looking at the consistency in traction and feel and how it absorbs impacts compared to natural grass. What I feel like they failed to acknowledge is the difference in friction between natural and artificial turf. This seems to make artificial turf a decent choice for football (American) but a terrible choice for football (soccer).
worldcup,395z1f,IGuessImAnEnt,2,Tue Jun 9 22:27:56 2015 UTC,Would someone mind explaining to me who is responsible for the decision to put in turf? Why is Canada putting in turf in a world cup?

worldcup,395z1f,I_am_transparent,2,Tue Jun 9 22:58:56 2015 UTC,"Turf is the worst. Not only does it cut you up when you fall on it, but it has absolutely no give.

worldcup,395z1f,punecityexpat,13,Tue Jun 9 17:25:05 2015 UTC,"They are using turf to mean artificial, plastic turf.  It can take some time to get used to if you have only ever played on grass.  And sliding on it can lead to cuts, so players are probably more reluctant to slide tackle.  The players have a point that the men's World Cup would never be played on artificial grass.  On the other hand, many of these women play for club teams that use the same surface.  I think the idea that this is a ""nightmare"" is overly dramatic."
worldcup,395z1f,dejour,6,Tue Jun 9 17:26:29 2015 UTC,"The Men's under 20 World Cup, in Canada, was played on artificial turf.  As far as I know, the likes of Sergio Agüero, Angel Di Maria, Juan Mata, Javier Hernandez, David Luiz, Luis Suarez, etc. etc. didn't complain about it/bite anyone."
worldcup,395z1f,flynnsarcade,3,Tue Jun 9 17:37:05 2015 UTC,"That's true.  The fact is that if Canada bid on the men's World Cup the proposal would be to play on artificial turf.  Assuming no bribes, Canada would not win the bidding.  But from Canada's perspective it isn't gender discrimination - since they'd propose essentially the same venues for a men's game."

Hopefully that will go into their next game. Spain had lots of chances though. Fox Sports was talking about the CR players and what they go through to be accepted. I really really hope they can make it into the next round."

worldcup,392wfa,Ilandar,0,Tue Jun 9 01:39:27 2015 UTC,"(but why did you link to a page that shows he only had 4--which is less than Solo)   That's a tally of how the American shots ended up. Of the fourteen, nine were on target. Of those on target, one was a goal, four were blocked and four were saved by the Belgian goalkeeper.  If you want to see how many saves Tim Howard made, look at the other shots tally. Belgium had thirty-eight in total, with twenty-six on target. Of those twenty-six, two were goals, nine were blocked and fifteen were saved."

worldcup,393gmv,Revolt_52,3,Tue Jun 9 02:27:36 2015 UTC,I did not see a foul there.  Keeper got her hands on the ball.  Collision was unavoidable.
worldcup,393gmv,makeshiftmitten,3,Tue Jun 9 03:12:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah, if that's a yellow, Neuer should have gotten a red last year.   It's the striker's responsibility to avoid that collision with the keeper in the box. If anything the card should have gone the other way.  Always hate to see a collision like that but that's what happens when everyone is 100% in the game."
worldcup,393gmv,Revolt_52,2,Tue Jun 9 12:43:49 2015 UTC,Thank you for the response.  I thought I had gone crazy.
worldcup,393gmv,mbackflips,1 point,Tue Jun 9 15:41:55 2015 UTC,"exactly where in the rules does it say an attacker is responsible for avoiding the collision.  I was at the game, and I've watched several replays.  Personally I can see it going both ways.  And from where the referee was it definitely looks like a foul."
worldcup,393gmv,makeshiftmitten,1 point,Tue Jun 9 21:12:01 2015 UTC,"It's been a rule, maybe an unspoken one, since I've played as a kid. As a striker, if you go into the box on a 50-50 ball against the keeper, you forfeit your body, because goalkeepers need to be protected. You can back off the attack if you think the keeper may get to the ball first, but the keeper has nowhere to go but into the ball.  I have all the admiration in the world for Kozue Ando making that poke, but she knew what was going to happen when she did it.   As a goalkeeper, the 18 is your house. It's your responsibility to protect it. She made the stop and the follow through carried her into Ando.  I think the only reason it was a call is because it all happened at body level and it was hard for Thalmann to take a proper defensive stance. If Ando pokes the ball high and she takes a tiger knee to the face when Thalmann goes for it, there's no call and nobody bats an eye."
worldcup,393gmv,mbackflips,1 point,Wed Jun 10 10:22:22 2015 UTC,"Just because lots of people believe something is true, doesn't make it a rule, or right.  There is nothing that gives the keeper special protection in the box.  They are another player, the only difference is that they are allowed to use their hands.  The attacker had a fair chance to play the ball in this situation so she is allowed to go for it.  The keeper however does make contact with the attacker with her feet in her stomach.  That is a foul.  Lets take this situation and put it in the middle of the field between to outfield players.  Would it have been a foul?  Probably, so it is in the box with the keeper as well.  The idea that keepers can put themselves in dangerous positions and get special protection because ""the 18 is their house"" is wrong.  The Penalty area is where the goal keeper can use their hands, not where they get free reign to do whatever they want.  The only time the keeper gets something special is when they have control of the ball with their hands (which she didn't).  Then you can't just run into them to get them to drop the ball."

worldcup,393gmv,clearly_i_mean_it,2,Tue Jun 9 02:10:58 2015 UTC,Just that they're playing on turf at all.  It was a huge controversy as no World Cup has ever been played exclusively on turf.
worldcup,393gmv,Ilandar,2,Tue Jun 9 02:13:33 2015 UTC,"Wow, that's pretty bizarre! Is there a reason why they're playing on turf?"
worldcup,393gmv,clearly_i_mean_it,3,Tue Jun 9 02:25:42 2015 UTC,"Hahah... that's a hot mess of a question.    A lot of the athletes competing argue it's because FIFA is unwilling to invest any money into women's soccer.  They asked for an expedited hearing, FIFA denied it and refused to negotiate at all, and the players weren't willing to sit out the World Cup so agreed to play on turf. Here's a basic overview."
worldcup,393gmv,Ilandar,3,Tue Jun 9 02:32:31 2015 UTC,FIFA rejected suggestions of laying natural grass over the permanent artificial turf for the four-week tournament in Canada despite offers from at least one company to provide and install it at no charge.   What the fuck?  EDIT: I played on artificial turf once as a junior. Went for a slide tackle...RIP my skin.

Sweden comes into this match today ranked fifth in the world according to the FIFA rankings, the second-best in the group behind the second-ranked United States team.   Nigeria won't be a complete pushover, either, as they come into the match with the 33rd world ranking, but they are the lowest ranked country of any in Group D.   Both Nigeria and Sweden are making their seventh appearance in the World Cup, each played in the last event as well. Sweden, UEFA Group 4 winners with a 10-0 record to qualify, were runners-up in the 2003 tournament, falling to Germany.  Nigeria are the African women's champion, beating Cameroon 2-0 in the finals back in October. Nigeria made the quarterfinals back in 1999.  This has the makings of a solid match that could be low-scoring. The Sweden team certainly needs to find a way to get a point in this one with matches against the United States and Australia still looming in Group action."

Does 3ACD compare the points, etc, of the 3rd place teams from groups A, C and D?  What if one of those teams, let's say 3C for example, was the top of third place team for both slots they are available for?  For example, the 3ACD slot vs 1B and the 3CDE slot vs 1A?

Fortunately, they have a lot of large TVs (and I think a projector?) so maybe that would be a good place to go. Lots of football fans went there for the 2014 World Cup anyway"
worldcup,38x3i6,JDeelish,2,Sun Jun 7 22:03:53 2015 UTC,"I went to Tonic East for several matches last summer, but I feel like Nevada Smith's is a better bet since they are primarily a soccer bar. That said, I like Tonic East as a venue and wouldn't mind watching there either. I figure no matter where we go, as long as there are enough of us there to ask for the WWC they'll generally comply."
worldcup,38x3i6,chrisarg72,2,Sun Jun 7 22:10:04 2015 UTC,"You're absolutely right. Personally, I don't even like Tonic, but I don't know where else to go where I won't be the only girl in my US Soccer jersey, feeling like an outcast. It's a shame, cause NY always goes crazy during the men's World Cup, but when it's the Women's World Cup, ahhhh not so much =( If you find a good place where lots of fans will be, please post it here though."
worldcup,38x3i6,chrisarg72,2,Sun Jun 7 22:16:30 2015 UTC,"I think Nevada Smith's is the best option so I'm focusing on that as a meetup spot. Legend's on 33rd is a close second. Tonic isn't a bad venue as I said before, but it's in Murray Hill and kind of bro-y which is unfortunate.  According to Nevada Smith's website, the only games they're showing tomorrow are WWC matches so I think we'll be okay. As you said, it's definitely not as big as the Men's World Cup, but I imagine there should be a decent turnout for the US team."

worldcup,38xh6v,jsz,2,Sun Jun 7 18:15:32 2015 UTC,So all the stadiums in Canada are afro-turf?
worldcup,38xh6v,Vyndro,8,Sun Jun 7 18:21:24 2015 UTC,"Canadian here.  It's hard to have nice grass when the field is buried in large amounts of snow (when I played sports it was not uncommon for both teams to shovel the snow off the field before a game, can't do this on real grass). Also, with the warm/cold flashes the grass itself is not always protected from the cold from the snow and is exposed to -40°C conditions. This is not good for grass. So yes, unless the competition is taking place somewhere like Victoria BC, the strong majority of fields are turf due to easier upkeep."
worldcup,38xh6v,ToniPolster,5,Sun Jun 7 18:57:08 2015 UTC,"Well, the scandinavians sure are able to do it, so I'd say its a matter of will versus cost and I'm not trying to start a fight here."

worldcup,38xh6v,xfile345,5,Sun Jun 7 20:13:15 2015 UTC,"I believe that's correct.  Instead of spending money to change the turf fields to grass, they changed the grass to turf, and that's pretty much what the lawsuit was about.  If it were the Men's world cup, they would have spent the money to make them all grass, not turf."
worldcup,38xh6v,scopar,2,Sun Jun 7 20:37:33 2015 UTC,"This is incorrect. Only 1 of the WWC stadiums was real grass before. I'm not arguing that they shouldn't be grass, but only one was reverted to turf for the world cup."

worldcup,38xh6v,thegmx,6,Sun Jun 7 23:36:00 2015 UTC,"Canadian here. None of the stadiums being used in the World Cup had grass before the World Cup, except for Moncton. Every one of them already had turf (again, except Moncton). The only major stadium in Canada that has natural grass is BMO Field in Toronto and it's not being used because it's currently being renovated and Toronto is busy with the Pan Am Games next month. I understand why people are upset but nothing was changed for the World Cup. Turf is what was already there at every stadium so they decided to keep it."
worldcup,38xh6v,OnTheMattack,3,Mon Jun 8 00:05:01 2015 UTC,"Does that mean the CMNT plays on turf for all it's home FIFA qualifiers?  There just aren't any natural grass fields, right? Or is every game in Toronto?"
worldcup,38xh6v,happy_otter,3,Mon Jun 8 02:46:42 2015 UTC,"Every CMNT home game is played at BMO field. Commonwealth Stadium in Edmonton used to have natural grass before BMO field was built, and the Canadian men would play there."

worldcup,38xh6v,saratogacv60,4,Sun Jun 7 22:26:16 2015 UTC,The worse part is the heat travels through the boots and begins to burn your feet. I've played on it when the outside temp was 86 and you couldn't stand for long without it feeling like the bottom of your feet were going to peel off.
worldcup,38xh6v,emptyvoices,2,Mon Jun 8 04:06:03 2015 UTC,"I don't see what the big deal is. I have played on turf and grass. There are negatives to both. Grass is nice and definitely slower, which allows for easier through balls and long balls don't skip out as much. But you get use to it. I like running on turf, especially the new stuff, it is generally a very even surface and I find I don't turn my ankles as much. Also it is great because it drains much better and is ready for play even after or during a down poor. You don't have to worry about it getting torn up and muddy or bare spots. It is hotter, but I didn't have much of a problem with that even in hot summers of Washington DC. They say you get rug burns, but I have gotten those on grass as well. It would seem to me that the bigger issue is that fifa is less than transparent when it comes to revenue that they will generate in the women's world Cup, and they have not made good arguments in favor of using turf. I think if fifa were more honest about the benefits of playing on turf this would not be as big of an issue. Instead they are just being dicks about it which plays right into the sexist perception. On the other hand the players are being disingenuous because they have all played extensively on turf in college. The men have less experience playing on turf and many never play on turf and would have more of an adjustment. The men are also afraid of any change and the perception is that turf leads to knee injuries, which was true of the old Astro turf, but some studies say new stuff is actually better in regards to knee and other injuries."

I know the US has some large stadiums, but the layouts may not suit soccer and/or they may use artificial turf, like Michigan Stadium.   Honestly though, if the US was going to bid, I would imagine they would go for a solo bid, or if needed, a joint bid with Canada only given the MLS teams. I don't see a joint bid with Mexico happening."
worldcup,38wrhh,Soriah,3,Sun Jun 7 16:52:15 2015 UTC,"Most ""multipurpose"" stadiums in the US are utterly useless for soccer, it's nothing more than a marketing slogan.

Quite frankly, it was only site in Mexico that I could think of that could host a World Cup contest and putting finals would even out the fact that rest of the games would be in Canada or the U.S. If Mexico is only getting two game, it should be the final two. I would imagine the round robin and knock out portions could be staged in Toronto, NYC, Chicago, LA, D.C., Pittsburgh, Philadelphia, Montreal, Dallas, Vancouver, Boston, Miami, Seattle, San Jose, San Diego, Houston, Kansas City, Denver, Calgary (with temporary seating to get to 40,000), Edmonton (world's biggest mall), Atlanta, Phoenix, Cleveland, Cincinnati, Indianapolis, Jacksonville, Minneapolis, Tampa, NOLA, St Louis, Oakland.  That's just the pro stadiums. Almost every P5 (power conferences) university as well a couple G5 (second division for all (intensive) intents and purposes) has a stadium that seats at least 50,000. Some seat 110,000.  You could literally have every game in a different stadium in the U.S. and Canada. I know this will end up f/shitAmericanssay but it's the truth."
worldcup,38wrhh,Soriah,10,Sun Jun 7 16:10:30 2015 UTC,"That's the thing though, if you are only going to host one game in Mexico and it's the finals, US and Canada would more likely just bid together and not bother with Mexico."

worldcup,38u5yf,qwerty_dh,2,Sat Jun 6 22:43:51 2015 UTC,Why is china subbing a player in the 42nd minute
worldcup,38u5yf,Salgados,2,Sat Jun 6 22:46:14 2015 UTC,This second half seems like an entirely different match.
worldcup,38u5yf,OverblownEgo,1 point,Sat Jun 6 22:24:56 2015 UTC,The intensity of the first half was too high. No one can keep that pace for the entire match.
worldcup,38u5yf,not_old_redditor,2,Sat Jun 6 22:43:37 2015 UTC,That was a hell of a match. I was pulling for China but between Buchanan and Sinclair Canada slowly won me over. I hated to see it end in a PK but Sinclair's shot was impeccable and if anyone was going to score it just seems right it was her given how fiercely she attacked from the very start of the match. Hell of a way to open the cup!
worldcup,38u5yf,RLJoey,3,Sat Jun 6 23:17:04 2015 UTC,Wow! By a hair that wasn't an awesome goal on that free kick!
worldcup,38u5yf,not_old_redditor,0,Sat Jun 6 23:26:16 2015 UTC,What a disgrace to call that penalty! The ref handed Canada that game when they clearly did nothing to deserve it. Reminiscent of Brazil-Croatia last year.
worldcup,38u5yf,Salgados,4,Sun Jun 7 00:18:57 2015 UTC,"I hated to see it too, but on certain angles it looks pretty bad. From the first angle I saw it on I was furious, but subsequent replays made it seem less suspicious. I'm not 100% on it but at the very least I can see where the ref may have seen a PK worthy foul. The timing on it is what bothers me most, terrible way to end what had been such a heated match."
worldcup,38u5yf,not_old_redditor,3,Sat Jun 6 22:23:36 2015 UTC,I think it's fair to say that this would have been called a foul 100% of the time if it were anywhere else. Credit to the ref for not chickening out just because it was in the penalty box in the 90th minute.
worldcup,38u5yf,xfile345,2,Sat Jun 6 23:54:28 2015 UTC,"It was a penalty, but I think the ref shoulda swallowed the whistle on it."

A last man back foul from behind to stop a breakaway, which is normally a red card, should be a penalty kick even when committed OUTSIDE of the box (it could possibly be reduced to a yellow card since you made the other part of it harsher).  It's ridiculous that in the dying moments of a game, a team can stop a breakaway by fouling, as as long as they aren't in the box yet, the punishment is super weak. Turning the breakaway into a free kick is obviously hugely to the defensive advantage, and Japan doesn't give a shit about a red card with less than a minute left.  I didn't use the DVR for extra replays, and to be fair the foul from Japan didn't look intentional, but it's stupid how what should be a MAJOR foul against Japan, and cost the US a serious chance to win the game, ends up being almost irrelevant."

I am of the enjoyment side of things, and I can name 20 beers off the top of my head that are better than Bud for a hot day outside. Are they more expensive? Yup. But if you are drinking 3 or 4 to enjoy your day rather than, say, 15 to get wrecked, then the cost difference is negligible. Will I refuse a Bud if handed to me? Nope. But given a choice between Bud and water, I'll take water anyday.  And if you consider an egg mc muffin to be the apotheosis of breakfasting, I'd like to introduce you to my friend Mr. Benedict."
worldcup,385aqb,moooooseknuckle,5,Tue Jun 2 06:22:51 2015 UTC,"Eh.  There comes a point in your life where Budweiser kind of turns into water and you just drink that instead of water, leaving the good beer for when you actually want to drink.  Shit, I need to re-evaluate my life..."
worldcup,385aqb,BallWasherSalesman,1 point,Tue Jun 2 19:57:07 2015 UTC,Yep. After those craft beers high ABV starts to kick in and you can't taste much anymore it's hard to turn down a cheap bucket of iced Budweiser.
worldcup,385aqb,IvyGold,-4,Tue Jun 2 23:30:10 2015 UTC,"That's the thing: the Egg McMuffin is basically an Eggs Benedict in sandwich form.    When sitting down for breakfast, check out Eggs Maryland (crab instead of ham-- DELICIOUS!).  I don't drink Bud at home, ever.  I'm drinking a Flying Dog Raging Bitch as I type.  But when watching baseball, playing softball, waterskiing, screwing around on a beach, etc. it's perfect.  What are your alternatives for say a tubing trip down a river?"
worldcup,385aqb,midairmatthew,7,Tue Jun 2 06:30:44 2015 UTC,"Let me heartily recommend Left Hand's Polestar Pilsner for a sunny day session beer. The main benefit over Budweiser is that Polestar actually tastes like a pilsner, as do many other fine pilsners not ""brewed"" by macro-breweries."
worldcup,385aqb,IvyGold,1 point,Tue Jun 2 06:41:02 2015 UTC,"I will seek it out!    My day to day beer used to be Beck's until the Germans let it get brewed in Missouri for the USA market.  I've been in search of a good pilsener ever since.    Anyhow, on my overarching point for which I'm getting mild downvotes: it's unlike John Oliver to burn bridges.  I think with the recent indictments, he got overexcited.    If he actually wanted to sway these corporations, he should've shown good faith:  Dowing a Bud Lime wearing Adidas shoes in a Coca-Cola T-shirt while purchasing a Hyundai with a VISA card."

Sadly, I can't give any tips on seating locations, because we're going with a youth girl's soccer team that my friend coaches for, so we got our tickets through the group ticketing system, and the locations from my understanding was kind of arbitrary.  Maybe others have a better sense?  Though I suspect that since the USA is kind of the ""home"" team that there's going to be a lot of US support all over the stadium. :)"

worldcup,36rnlf,readitour,1 point,Thu May 21 18:56:01 2015 UTC,"If women's sports were treated equally around the world, yes, the caliber of female athlete would be 110% better than what we have today and women could compete against men, no problem, especially in soccer. Men are genetically stronger, women genetically have much greater stamina/endurance, which is the strongest physical component of soccer."
worldcup,36rnlf,cardboardguru13,3,Thu May 21 20:31:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'd probably bet that you're right."
worldcup,36rnlf,readitour,4,Thu May 21 20:51:34 2015 UTC,"There is a limit to the endurance... two forty five minute halves, the best men will be trained to have enough cardio to meet that level required.... there is a set limit on how much is needed.  With things like speed, strength, size, there is no limit....   for that reason the mens team would win.  They are gonna build such a lead early due to the speed, size, strength advantage that the women's endurance advantage won't have enough time to chip away at that lead.  Over 90 minutes, they get 2-3 goals in the first half, park the bus in the second, and its game over.  I don't think women could compete without some change in the rules that would make soccer a game that lasted for days and that endurance advantage could be properly taken advantage of."
worldcup,36rnlf,Commandant1,1 point,Thu May 21 21:54:24 2015 UTC,"My claim is that if female athletes were cultivated with the same vigor and funding as male athletes, we would have female athletes that perform as well, and sometimes better, than male athletes in sports such as soccer. That female athletic talent simply goes unrealized because it's not being sought anywhere remotely close to how we seek out male talent."
worldcup,36rnlf,cardboardguru13,5,Thu May 21 22:26:09 2015 UTC,"Fair, and my point is that even if cultivated, the fact that this is a time limited sport of a relatively short duration works against them.  You can train to have 90 minutes... 120 minutes.... of endurance.  The advantages wouldn't be apparent unless you played much longer games, or changes the schedule so that they were much closer together.  The Men's advantage in power, speed etc... in the early part of the game, plus some strategy to kill the clock would be enough to overcome the stamina edge."
worldcup,36rnlf,Commandant1,3,Fri May 22 05:33:39 2015 UTC,the fact that this is a time limited sport of a relatively short duration works against them.   90 minutes of nearly continuous play is not short.   You can train to have 90 minutes... 120 minutes.... of endurance.   This has never been disputed. You simply have a low opinion of female athletic ability.
worldcup,36rnlf,cardboardguru13,7,Fri May 22 06:25:53 2015 UTC,"It is relatively short.  A marathon is considered long and a test of endurance... yet how many times are women even in the top 10 of the Boston Marathon? New York Marathon? any famous race?  These are longer than 90 minutes and are not nearly continuous... they are completely continuous.  The advantage of natural endurance is negated by the fact these men are the elite of the elite in terms of high end athletes, have a set goal they are training for, months and years of preparation, and a set time period to reach."
worldcup,36rnlf,Commandant1,1 point,Fri May 22 12:07:15 2015 UTC,I'm sorry you have such a poor estimation of female strength and endurance.
worldcup,36rnlf,cardboardguru13,2,Fri May 22 16:44:47 2015 UTC,"I doubt it.  Men are genetically stronger, bigger, faster, etc..."

worldcup,36rnlf,RoscoFrazer,1 point,Sun May 24 12:45:56 2015 UTC,"I heard that in ice hockey, the gold-medallist Canadian womens' team would scrimmage against high school boys and get clobbered.    Two different sports, I know.  All I can say is that I saw WC games in RFK in both the womens and mens world cups and the mens' goalies could easily kick the ball from goal to beyond the 50 yard line, whereas the women's goalies would get it out to the 35 or 40."
worldcup,36rnlf,IvyGold,0,Sun May 24 12:51:03 2015 UTC,"Clobbered?  No... they went about 500 in those scrimmages and played very competitive games.  However it wasn't even the top level of high school boys (major junior) it was Junior A, which is second tier."

worldcup,36i7ha,Median2,8,Tue May 19 22:21:00 2015 UTC,"Australia are half-decent, and Iran can be handy when the mood takes them as well, but yes - Asia is one of the easier qualifying groups.  Mind you, Japan only came second in their initial group to Uzbekistan (!) and beat out North Korea who were seeded 4th, then won their second group."

If the human rights abuses continue (and they will, sadly) then the bad publicity for the FIFA sponsors' products will only get worse and worse.  In effect, FIFA sponsors are paying millions of pounds to be associated with an event which has already killed hundreds of slave workers, and which will kill thousands more unless action is taken soon. Why sponsor an event which is clearly only going to blacken your product?"

worldcup,36fuxq,NoNameForYou,3,Tue May 19 07:57:03 2015 UTC,"One way to make a difference is to boycott FIFA's sponsors.  Here are the official FIFA partners (taken from the FIFA website) if people want to boycott them: Adidas, Coca Cola, Gazprom, Hyundai and Visa.  And here are the official FIFA World Cup sponsors: Budweiser and McDonalds.  This is the link with the current FIFA sponsors and partners, so people know who to boycott:  http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/organisation/partners/"
worldcup,36fuxq,abesrevenge,4,Tue May 19 11:35:08 2015 UTC,"And just to highlight that boycotting FIFA sponsors makes a difference, according to the link below, FIFA recently lost five sponsors:  http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/world-cup/11364195/Fifa-loses-three-key-sponsors-as-Castrol-Continental-and-Johnson-and-Johnson-sever-ties-with-world-governing-body.html  With so many sponsors cutting ties with FIFA, it shows that campaigns and boycotts are making a difference and FIFA has become a toxic brand."
worldcup,36fuxq,NoNameForYou,2,Tue May 19 11:36:12 2015 UTC,Sorry but those are the biggest companies in the world. Boycotting them will do absolutely nothing.
worldcup,36fuxq,NoNameForYou,3,Tue May 19 13:58:18 2015 UTC,"But enough people boycotting them becomes bad publicity. And the only reason they're sponsoring the World Cup in the first place is for good publicity. You or I boycotting them would have no effect. Thousands boycotting them, and being vocal about it, could."
worldcup,36fuxq,hastavictoria,2,Tue May 19 14:26:27 2015 UTC,"At any one time there are thousands of people ""boycotting"" any of those companies for one reason or another. It s a small drop in the bucket. It is almost impossible to avoid any of those products on a regular bases because they are so huge, and even if you switch to something else they still likely own a piece of that company. The better way to do something is for governments to put pressure on FIFA. There needs to be a huge country that refuses to go. Germany, Italy, England, Brazil (unlikely), USA (not a futball power but the fan base that spends the most money). So the people can put pressure on their government to make their country not go."
worldcup,36fuxq,sbowesuk,3,Tue May 19 15:07:12 2015 UTC,"Agreed, if a country (or countries) refused to go that would have a big effect.  When I was younger, countries used to boycott events quite regularly (The Olympics, and also events in South Africa were boycotted), so it would be nice to think it could happen again."
worldcup,36fuxq,arlopez08,3,Tue May 19 16:08:49 2015 UTC,"Doesn't it get more complicated in instances like that? A nation's FA refusing to participate would have knock-on effects for the clubs that play in their asscociation. So England boycotting the World Cup, for example, may mean Chelsea get barred from the Champions League. Which would make it practically impossible.   One thing that does get overlooked is the power that players have in these instances. A boycott by individuals could not have ramifications for their FA's and there is no way to force them to participate. It would depend on prevailing attitudes within their country as to what reaction they would get from their respective press and publics though. English players are uniquely placed there I think. If Rooney came out and said he was boycotting the World Cup he would get support I think. Maybe not total support but the ethical arguement for doing it is clearly there. It would never happen for all sorts of reasons but I think top players boycotting would be the most effective."
worldcup,36fuxq,Simplybad55,2,Tue May 19 16:23:59 2015 UTC,"One thing that does get overlooked is the power that players have in these instances.   I totally agree. If any England players boycotted the Qatar World Cup, I would totally respect them for it. Some things are more important than football, and to be honest the World Cup has already been tarnished anyway, so it doesn't hold the same imporatance to me now as it did when I was a kid."
worldcup,36fuxq,TheFlea1,2,Wed May 20 00:59:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think you're right and I think the key word is probably 'vocal'.  Five companies have already ended their sponsorship of FIFA, so bad publicity can make a difference."

I know it will sound sexist and rude etc but that's not how I intend it, but in most sports even the men's leagues that are FAR from top ranked are far more competitive and talented than the women's. For example the local minor ice hockey club's Midget AAA (boys aged 16-18) slapped the Canadian Women's national team something like 12-0 without even trying, and Canada's women's team is the best in the world. I want Canada to win/be successful, but unless it's on the news or something I won't even think about it."

World Cup host bids.  You can read more here.  Rather damning is the refusal of FIFA to release the Garcia Report, which was commissioned by FIFA in an attempt to clear their name of corruption allegations.  FIFA (and Blatter) are generally seen in a negative light due to profiteering, corruption, poor moral standards (WC stadiums being built by slave labor in Qatar), and failure to serve the interests of the majority of football fans in favor of increased profits.  Edit: The FBI is involved because the United States made a bid to host the 2022 games.  Qatar won the bid, allegedly due to bribes."

Every single country in FIFA has the same power when voting for a new president of FIFA. The smallest country in the world and England each have exactly 1 vote. When it comes time to vote, Blatter goes on a tour of all the smallest countries in FIFA and gives them a shit load of money/soccer fields/support/whatever so they continue to vote him.

Now we are going through an economic hAngover but the world cup has nothing to do with it. We are feeling the after effects of failed policies and incompetence of our President Roussef.  She got reelected by a small margin and on her new term the person in charge of the economy is an orthodox and has views that are very diferent from hers. It's as if her goverment is under intervention to avoid her causing more harm.  Edit: To illustrate it better, only the state owned oill company lost 40 billion dollars  last year. The president's policies were causing inflation and as a counter measure she started subsidizing oil prices making the company and its share holders pay the losses.  This year a huge corruption scheme was discovered, petrobras managers and private contractors are going to jail for taking billions from the company to themselves and to the party.That was only on Petrobras, there were huge losses on many other areas.  The world cup money was peanuts and nobody , even the ones who were most vocal against the WC would blame it for the economy recession. The only hangover we got from the world cup was due to that tragic game.."

worldcup,34tujo,MutenRoshi,1 point,Tue May 5 01:56:32 2015 UTC,"Serious question, can you ask your friend who told you that... what does ""way out of snitch range"" mean?"
worldcup,34tujo,Deucer22,6,Tue May 5 01:59:17 2015 UTC,"I don't know the answer, but I can guess -- catching the snitch ends the game and awards an enormous points bonus to the team that caught it. ""Beyond snitch range"" probably means the final score difference was more than 2x snitch value -- that is to say, if the opposing team had caught the snitch instead, at the same point in the game, it wouldn't have changed the winner.  Or something similar, at least; maybe no snitch catches actually happened, or the opposing team actually did catch the snitch; the point is there was a point differential exceeding snitch value before any snitch catch."

I could go to China tomorrow, get a job as an English teacher, and leave whenever I want. Guest workers in Qatar are at the total mercy of their employers."

Though primary school enrollment and basic literacy rates are high, China’s education system discriminates against children and young people with disabilities.

It doesn't mean I particularly  like either government. But within the context of the world Cup I like Qatar a lot less because of what they represent in FIFA.

You don't get to root for China if your motivation is you dislike the human rights record of whatever opponent they have (in this case Qatar).  Its having a selective logic, that Qatar should lose because they have a terrible human rights record and apparently only they should.  Well there are a lot of countries who have bad records, China is one of them, you dont get to dislike just one of the bad countries if your reason for disliking it is a sweeping issue that touches upon others."

If we talk in pure revenue terms he has presided over a period of time in which the game has been hyper profitable.  With all of that out there to grab for there will literally be no end to the graft and bullshit, and any country like Qatar or China or fucking Belarus wil be able to get what they want if the money is right.  edit: This may sound like I am speaking in sweeping generalizations but my belief that he has a stranglehold on the Asian FA's comes from Gab Marcotti talking about how slim the chances of the other candidates are, I am fairly certain he mentioned the Asian confeds as one of the voting blocs that big sepp will be relying on."

But I think we should wait to see if that can be replicated before thinking about more WC spots for CONCACAF. The US and Mexico are generally quite good at World Cups, but before the last WC the last time a CONCACAF nation other than those two got out of the group stages was in 1990. Having two nations that consistently perform at World Cups doesn't really make for a good claim to increase the CONCACAF spots at WCs in my view. If Costa Rica (or another CONCACAF nation) can replicate the good showings at the last WC that can change"

This is not even counting infrastructure, hotels, transportation or even giant college football stadiums or MLS specific pitches. The US could host the World Cup tomorrow with no problem.  The '94 Cup led to the creation of the MLS and soccer's current popularity in the US. A return would only mean more growth for the sport.   Blatter is full of shit."

The three guys he lists are all currently professionals so I'm assuming it's just one of the numerous grammatical/wording errors in this article.  I agree with the whole aging squad needing some fresh faces going forward but there's absolutely nothing to suggest JK isn't taking massive strides towards addressing the issue.

Total Football was a revelation, and its impact is still felt in the modern game. However, the idea that the dutch should be criticized for not still playing a 40 year old football style is a lazy critique.  For as amazing as it was in the 70s Total Football ultimately lost, twice.       As brilliant a footballer as Johann is, critiquing a team for not employing his 40 year old strategy is dumb.  They would be playing it if it worked. But it doesn't. The modern world cup single elimination knockout tournament doesn't reward beautiful play. Spain won in 2010 with the fewest goals scored of any winner.  The world cup has become a game of attrition. I'd love to see it change so you could see a game more reminiscent of  the Jugo Bonito and Total Football styles, but thats just not where the game is right now.   Total Football is wonderful piece of Dutch and world Football history.  However, that history should not be a millstone around the National Teams neck."

worldcup,312y4j,number2301,3,Thu Apr 2 16:09:39 2015 UTC,"Yes. Who else - England have tired expensive foreign managers with great records, and not achieved success.   It's not the manager, it's the system, the press, the clubs and the players.  The lack of players because the Premier league is always going to be won by the richest clubs with the largest squads who will rather buy overseas talent for instant success. The FA because it is powerless in the face of the PL. It appears to me that the big clubs French, German and Spanish players are always available to play for their countries, but an England friendly will bring a huge rush of injuries to home grown players who are inevitably fit 4 days later.  The press because every time England don't win a friendly, or try something new there is outrage. Three losses in a row and they are calling for the managers head.  I'm relatively optimistic about the national side - it seems young, talented and might even be decent by the time of the next World cup."

worldcup,30tvxj,StaleMilkNothingTher,12,Mon Mar 30 17:55:33 2015 UTC,"Just reinforces my thinking we need post game review and cards.  If the camera caught him being stomped on, he should get a red card applied at the 90th minute.  Sure, in a friendly like this it might not mean much, but if this kind of thing was standard, it would change attitude and tactics in the field.  Things, like deliberate injuries would not be an option to be made in the heat of their moment like what Neymar accuses."
worldcup,30tvxj,Qix213,8,Mon Mar 30 22:11:52 2015 UTC,"I agree. Also, this should be applied too if someone try to mislead the referee by faking a foul"
worldcup,30tvxj,altercreed,2,Mon Mar 30 23:54:47 2015 UTC,"We already do that since the 90's, yet only in servere cases. Think Rivaldo at the WC 2002, even though he just received a fine of 11,000 Swiss Franks, but it's the principle of post-game review being applicable that counts.  Also see this ""ambitious"" dive by Andreas Möller (1995):  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvJ0PaxtUtE  It is the most infamous dive in the Bundesliga history. He was banned for two league games. On top of that he was not nominated for several games of the German national team for a while and fined 10.000 DM.   I agree with you that we should punish these things harder, but I wanted to point out that it's not like we weren't punishing them at all."

worldcup,30tvxj,tommorell,1 point,Tue Mar 31 05:18:18 2015 UTC,"I heard the idea some while back as a response to the idea that instant replay would slow the game down too much (I agree).  The only pitfall to post game review/cards I see, is that refs will begin to rely on it.  And will be less likely to give out cards or big penalties during the game. Which can be a bit unfair to the players depending on how well it's handled.  But that's minor if it puts a stop to the laughing stock our game has become to outsiders thanks to diving and intentional fouls.  Also, (maybe because I'm American) I see this as more of an American idea.  Many places around the world see diving and fouls as good strategy.  Whereas more Americans see it as poor sportsmanship and think it ruins the fluidity of the game."
worldcup,30tvxj,Qix213,1 point,Tue Mar 31 14:38:30 2015 UTC,"I think fines are better. If the player really hates someone, he'll take a red card for the next match, big deal, the team is worse off. If it means 5% of their salary if it's found to be malicious after review, it hits close to home and they'll think twice."

worldcup,30tvxj,Hennyyy,1 point,Tue Mar 31 11:00:43 2015 UTC,"I'm not against that, but that takes the league getting involved.  And it's a big deal, so it rarely happens.  I think by letting the games refs do this with cards, it could be done every game.  And only by doing it every game would it actually cause any amount of change in attitudes during the games.  If players get as many red cards as you suggest, their manager will be irate."
worldcup,30tvxj,Qix213,2,Tue Mar 31 14:28:18 2015 UTC,Any intentional and injury threatening fouls should be reviewed and the player should get banned for a certain number of games and fined to reduce this. This is getting out of hands and players try to injure players from rival teams.

worldcup,30spwb,martybad,5,Mon Mar 30 17:45:04 2015 UTC,That's what I was thinking too.  Sometimes the writers and commentators seem to give a panic vibe about not being able to finish games or some inability to win... I've thought these games were more along the lines of an NFL preseason game where the third string qb gets his chance.
worldcup,30spwb,flapsfisher,2,Mon Mar 30 20:02:13 2015 UTC,"Sort of like that, but not really because a 3rd string NFL QB is only going to play under an extreme circumstance, whereas some of the guys Klinsmann wants to see might end up starting one day when they're ready."

worldcup,30pc88,frediculous_biggs,8,Sun Mar 29 18:22:35 2015 UTC,I visited the Olympic Park in Athens a few years ago when I saw Panathinaikos play. Felt like a ghost town. So many massive empty spaces and empty buildings. Weeds and graffiti everywhere.
worldcup,30pc88,frediculous_biggs,4,Sun Mar 29 21:19:28 2015 UTC,"So sad that after spending so much money facilities should be allowed to fall into disuse and disrepair. This is why I have real reservations about when nations decide to host large sporting events. They have to ask whether they can afford it and what use will be made of the facilities after the event. If they cannot answer these questions convincingly then the IOC, FIFA, or who ever need to take their event elsewhere."
worldcup,30pc88,gcatchris,5,Sun Mar 29 21:41:20 2015 UTC,"I completely agree with you. After the (planned) expense of Beijing, I think the re-usability and legacy of London's venues were a massive selling point to the IOC. There was a news report a month or so ago about the empty buildings at Sochi, another big white elephant.  Unfortunately, the IOC, Fifa, F1 etc don't seem to give much concern to the after effects (after all, the tournament is done now), and instead chase the big money and lavish venues.

The Stadium was downsized to become Turner Field, the natatorium is Georgia Tech's, the athlete's village are new dorms, etc.    Same thing happened for Sydney -- I understand they bascially built a whole new neighborhood that's thriving.  The London venues are generally all accounted for, too.  Athens is an outlier."
worldcup,30pc88,random_rockets,2,Sun Mar 29 19:27:55 2015 UTC,"What is happening to Turner Field right now? Not even 20 years old and already the Braves have abandoned it for a new stadium elsewhere. Also, how many Olympic Games have run at a lose for their host cites?   From what I recall the 76 Olympics in Montreal pretty much bankrupted the city. The main stadium was only paid for a few years ago and now sits pretty much unused since the Expos' moved out.   I do not have a problem with these events, in fact I love the FIFA and Cricket World Cups as much as anyone but I do have issue with using public money to support such events."
worldcup,30pc88,IvyGold,6,Sun Mar 29 21:48:03 2015 UTC,"Montreal was a clinic on how NOT to stage the games.  The next time a free country hosted them, LA in '84, they ran a modest profit.  That model's now the norm for cities that don't have a government pouring unlimited resources into the facilities like Beijing.    So when done right, I'm pretty sure the cities at least break even.  I know London is on course to do it."
worldcup,30pc88,random_rockets,4,Sun Mar 29 22:04:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah we just finished paying off the Olympic stadium a few years ago, took roughly 30 years. Montreal was a clinic on corruption.

worldcup,30pc88,Anathos117,3,Mon Mar 30 01:12:26 2015 UTC,England could stage the World Cup at anytime. In their 2018 bid most of the proposed stadiums were already built and in use. There were a few that needed work but nothing that would not have been done in the years leading to the World Cup.   Of course I am an England fan but I do think we could host a great World Cup for minimal outlay. The only reason Russia and Qatar got the World Cup was due to rampant corruption.
worldcup,30pc88,theaartzvolta,8,Mon Mar 30 02:14:12 2015 UTC,The same goes for the United States. All of our stadiums are built and in use. It would be very minimal cost to run in either country.

worldcup,30pc88,qrysdonnell,2,Sun Mar 29 18:01:13 2015 UTC,You are welcome. What I thought was interesting is this is another example of sports facilities being underutilized after hosting a major sporting event. You see the same thing with the Olympics. Wasn't it Norway that recently pulled out of the bidding for a Winter Olympics for these very reasons (plus the expense)?
worldcup,30pc88,crazyeyes91,7,Sun Mar 29 18:17:35 2015 UTC,This is exactly what happens every time. The world cup (abet something I love to watch from home) puts an incredibly high economic strain on a community with no gain in return and is not really worth it as an investment. An event that started as a celebration on the worlds most popular sport has become a way for corrupt people with power to gain more money and/or more power and have ruined a once beautiful event.
worldcup,30pc88,luizn7,5,Sun Mar 29 18:01:48 2015 UTC,"This is exactly what happens every time.   Except when the WC is held in an established (choose your own word) country like, recently, the USA, France and Germany.  Frankly, I'd rather see the WC rotated amongst North America, EU and, possibly, AUS/NZ (edit: and maybe JAP/KOR).  That would take some off the shine of the event, but it would eliminate the post-event stink.  I'd assume there's no money in that for Sepp, so back to a realistic discussion..."
worldcup,30pc88,luizn7,2,Sun Mar 29 21:51:09 2015 UTC,"Well, that's a good argument that they should only be held in countries that can afford the loss."
worldcup,30pc88,_pulsar,1 point,Sun Mar 29 22:54:56 2015 UTC,FIFA only cares about money for FIFA. If there are construction projects in countries with a lot of corruption then there's a tremendous financial upside for them.

And I'm sure none of the people who where in charge of bringing the World Cup and Olympics to Brazil including former President Lula give a crap about this. These articles about the empty stadiums keep popping up but this is not new to us Brazilians. We knew this would happen. Having these mega events allowed the politicians to make sure their friends in the construction industry were well fed with overpriced contracts. Why do you think there were 12 cities instead of the standard 8? Lula wanted to have 12 to ""show off every corner of the country"" but thats BS. The politicians thrive over using public money for their own personal gains."
worldcup,30pc88,infroger,6,Mon Mar 30 05:47:38 2015 UTC,FIFA and the International Olympic Committee both have to be two of the best SCAMS out there. Both corrupt to the core and  ruthless when it comes to draining the host country for resources.

worldcup,30pc88,Flam1,2,Sun Mar 29 23:06:05 2015 UTC,And what totally stinks for you and the rest of Brazil is that you get FIFA and the IOC sucking you dry for the next two years. I get the impression that many people in Brazil are not happy with the situation. Is this correct?
worldcup,30pc88,mrcarlita,3,Sun Mar 29 23:20:57 2015 UTC,"Yes, you're corrected. The cup was a disaster in economic terms, we spent way more than we will ever get back. There are stadiums in cities that will really never use it (middle of the Amazon, what moron had that idea?!?!). The Olympics will be a little less expensive since it will be on one city only and with half of the infrastructure done for the cup, but still crazy expensive, and on a city that already has tons of turism. I mean, what is the after game on this? We should had learned from Greece (who is still paying for the games, to the tune of $60k dollars per person) and never put our name on it. FIFA and the IOC get all the profit and we get stuck with the bill."

And here's  the thing, I'll be honest, Brazilians are laid back when it comes to accountability, if they are happy, they let things like these deals slide, that's how the bread and circus thing work. But now there's no bread and the circus is on fire, no wonder people are mad and waking up for all the BS there. I'm sure that IF Brazil had won (and that's a big if because we took such a crappy team with no direction and synergy at all), we would be laughing our way to the bank to pay for all this crap, that's just the way the culture is."

But at last year's cup, Sturridge, Sterling and Welbeck got my full attention. The speed and precision that they could be capable of is scarier than any other squad I watched.   I still think (ironically, since its his quote) that Rooney doesn't consistently deliver for the national team, and their defense needs to improve. I wouldn't call them the outright favorites or anything, but unlike previous iterations when I laughed at their proclamations of potential, this time I think they might have a terrific squad and deliver on those promises."

UEFA have 41% of the guaranteed spots, but they want more? 7 of their 13 teams failed to qualify out of the group stage in the 2014 WC -- only 46% of their teams made it out of the group stage, which puts them in 3rd out of 5 Confederations (AFC had 0% qual, CAF had 20%).  If qualifications were completely random (eg. you tossed a coin for every game score), UEFA would have just as many teams qualified. The Federations that should be given more guaranteed spots? CONMEBOL (with 83% qualified to the knockout stage) and CONCACAF (with 75%). CONMEBOL, with 7 teams vastly out performs the randomization test, as they would only expect 3 teams to qualify, not 5. Same story for CONCACAF, which while the average finishing place was low (thanks Honduras) had 3 teams make it to the knockout round out of 4.  We all know that using the current FIFA rankings is a joke anyway -- Spain went into the 2014 tournament ranked #1 in the World, only to finish in 23rd place. Costa Rica, on the other hand, finished in 8th after starting the tournament in... I dunno, 3900th place? If there is to be any redistribution, FIFA should just take away all guaranteed slots from Confederations that didn't qualify out of group stage, and redistribute them based on the amount of teams that did.  That would do the following, first the losses: AFC - loses 5 guaranteed spots, CAF loses 4, CONCACAF 1, CONMEBOL 1, UEFA 7  Redistribute the spots based on performance above expected:  Well, first, you can't just remove Africa and Asia from the World Cup, otherwise it becomes the Euromerica cup.  sooo.  Give 2.5 to each AFC and CAF out of the 16 for a total of 5  CONCACAF get 2.5 for a total of 5.5  CONMEBOL get 3.5 for a total of 8.5  UEFA get to keep their 13.

worldcup,30dhpi,TomServoMST3K,7,Sun Mar 29 15:20:25 2015 UTC,"I don't think taking just the last WC to give CONCACAF more spots at the coming WCs is a good idea. In 2010 2 out of 3 CONCACAF nations made it out of the group stages, in 2006 only 25%. Because of such a low number the percentages can fluctuate quite a bit just depending on how well a single team does. The last time a CONCACAF nation made it further than round of 16 before last year was in 2002. This isn't really a splendid record that demands to get more spots.   Costa Rica did very well at the last WC, coupled with USA and Mexico that made for a good showing of CONCACAF nations. But I think we should wait to see if that can anywhere near replicated before demanding more spots here  Taking only 1 WC into account for allocating spots for the next is especially not something I'd recommend as it often has an influence on how teams of a confederation perform depending on where the WC is held, e.g. the last time the WC was in Europe 10 out of 14 teams advanced from the group stages. I'd expect European teams to do better again at the next WC in Russia.   UEFA as a whole hasn't done that well in the last 2 WCs, despite winning the last 3 WCs, so I also don't really see why they now push for an additional spot though. So I don't agree with them here, I think it should stay as it is now because looking at the last WCs both CONCACAF and UEFA don't really make a case for getting more spots. Maybe give CONMEBOL one more spot, although they have only 10 NTs in the confederation, some people would probably disagree with giving regularly 60% (or more) of all CONMEBOL nations a spot at the WC"
worldcup,30dhpi,fleckes,9,Thu Mar 26 17:17:11 2015 UTC,"To be fair, decisions shouldn't be made on just the last World Cup.  Hemisphere seems to make a big impact.

CONCACAF might deserve another spot.  Another way of looking at it is to use www.eloratings.net.  There are 18 UEFA teams in the top 32 spots.  UEFA always seems to have the best ranked teams that didn't qualify.  Ukraine probably deserved to be at the last one.  Czech Republic, Romania, Denmark, Slovakia and Serbia are all ranked in the top 32 by ELO but did not qualify in 2014.  So I can definitely see UEFA's case."
worldcup,30dhpi,dejour,6,Thu Mar 26 17:26:00 2015 UTC,"In the last WCs USA and Mexico did generally well to get out of the group stages, that comes as no surprise. And in the last WC Costa Rica did very well, but that was the first time a CONCACAF nation other than USA or Mexico got out of the group stages since 1990. I don't see how that warrants another spot just yet if only the same two CONCACAF nations reliably perform at the WC, let's see if Costa Rica or another CONCACAF nation can replicate the results of 2014"
worldcup,30dhpi,fleckes,6,Thu Mar 26 17:38:28 2015 UTC,"This way, we still get to see England come in with extraordinarily high hopes for one of their referees to make the finals.   REKT."
worldcup,30dhpi,Buelldozer,3,Thu Mar 26 21:54:23 2015 UTC,"7 of their 13 teams failed to qualify out of the group stage in the 2014 WC    Well, if 100% of the teams were European then 50% wouldn't make through the group stage. You didn't address the fact that a few of these European teams were eliminated in groups by other European teams. Plus using just one world cup as a benchmark is very disingenuous of you.  All that being said: I agree, Europe has way too much representation as it is."
worldcup,30dhpi,this_account_is_mine,2,Fri Mar 27 10:14:00 2015 UTC,"How many spots would you strip off UEFA, and which confederations should get those spots instead?"
worldcup,30dhpi,fleckes,1 point,Fri Mar 27 11:21:59 2015 UTC,"No idea, this isn't a very easy task of course. On the one hand it has to be somewhat proportional to the amount of countries in a continent, but on the other it has to be representative of how many fans (potential audience) that continent represents.  Europe and South America are, obviously, the two main footballing continents. North America isn't that interested in football (in comparison to other sports) but they are HUGE markets that you can't overlook.  Asia is Asia: over half the world lives there, it's impossible to ignore, but granting spots to countries that really won't use them well... On the other hand how can they evolve if not by participating.  Africa is Africa: full of talent but no infrastructure, conditions to sustain a good country participating for a few world cups in row. That's how you get one-offs like Algeria in 1982, Cameroon in 1990, Nigeria in 1994, Senegal in 2002 and Ghana in 2010.  My main problem this morning was deciding what to have for breakfast, thank god I don't have to tackle such a complicated issue."
worldcup,30dhpi,this_account_is_mine,2,Fri Mar 27 11:36:11 2015 UTC,"So the quality of the teams and with that the quality of the entire World Cup shouldn't be of much concern then? Europe and South America are the main football regions, and they dominate the WC. So they get the most spots by a great margin, Europe in absolute terms (13 UEFA teams) and South America in relative terms (basically 50% of all CONMEBOL nations get to participate in the WC)  I don't see why we should ignore the reality that the main football regions are Europe and South America. Many people see the World Cup at least somewhat as a tournament for the best national teams in the world, I don't see why it shouldn't be a big deciding factor here how good teams are. I think people want to see good teams at the WC, and not inevitable thrashings in the group stages where more teams get totally outplayed. The best Asian and African teams haven't really done much to convince me it'd be good for the World Cup if we include more African and Asian nations   I don't really see the need to change too much on how the spots get allocated now"
worldcup,30dhpi,fleckes,1 point,Fri Mar 27 11:59:50 2015 UTC,"So the quality of the teams and with that the quality of the entire World Cup shouldn't be of much concern then?    I didn't say that but maybe I gave off that impression. I'm with you on this: measures should be taken to assure the quality of the competition, and if one or two spots are to be withdrawn from Europe and/or South America they should go to, in my opinion, Africa, where you can have a country or two with great talent.  As nice as it is to have a more global participation at the World Cup what's the point of more Asian teams if only South Korea (and only once, at home) reached farther than the 1/4 finals?  As for Concacaf only Mexico and the USA are competitive and with the current spots available they sort of are a shoe-in really.  Maybe Europe has too many countries, maybe not. One thing for sure (at least in terms of World Cup qualifiers) is that I don't see much logic in including Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan in the Euro zone. I mean, how are they European countries? Yes, they were part of the ex-USSR but culturally and geographically they are far from European. Georgia and Armenia, on the other hand, have legitimate geographical and cultural claims.  Israel.... well, that's an exception I can live with."
worldcup,30dhpi,this_account_is_mine,2,Fri Mar 27 13:04:44 2015 UTC,Wouldn't a better idea be to use coefficients similar to champions League for the confederations with certain minimum requirements so no one get shut out but at the same time remaining concurrent

On the 4th year the top 64 teams regardless of confederation play in the cup. Top 4 are the #1 seeds and so on."

They are not required to host and choose to do so freely. Look at nations pulling out of the winter games. Its up to the nation to figure out if they want to host and at what cost.   As for being corrupt that is a whole other issue, the fact that Quatar is still hosting seems to be a sure sign. I hope countries boycott."

Club teams have increasingly held tours in Asia, and are even discussing playing a Prem game abroad, all for the sake of tapping into new consumers. Sell more shirts, get better TV deals.  No, American university students aren't the top target.

worldcup,2ycd17,WCephei,16,Sun Mar 8 15:37:58 2015 UTC,From what I understand China's footballing authorities are having lots of internal issues and that these issues have spilled over to the national team.   It could be great to see China qualify for and do well at the World Cup since it represents a huge market for football and is a great opportunity to grow the sport in China.      Hopefully Chinese football can grow to the point that they can have a more competitive team that can qualify for a World Cup.   As for removing a qualification slot from CONMEBOL that will certainly result in resistance from the South American nations and they are are pretty powerful block at FIFA.
worldcup,2ycd17,gereth,2,Sun Mar 8 16:02:57 2015 UTC,"If anything, this additional spot will come from Concacaf."
worldcup,2ycd17,nschider_001,8,Wed Apr 22 00:29:09 2015 UTC,"lol, china would need about two or three extra spots to have a chance. they didn't even get to the final qualifying round last time iirc. its not like they are coming close and failing at the last stretch, they are a long way from getting there (based on their last performance)."
worldcup,2ycd17,the_tytan,5,Sun Mar 8 16:31:58 2015 UTC,"I think you mean qualify not classify?  I'm sure FIFA wants China to do well and qualify.  It's a very big country and they want most people to have a team to cheer for.  I suspect they also want India to qualify.  FIFA will always have to balance regional representation and country strength.  South America has very good teams, but do we really want 7 or 8 teams to make it out of 10?  Asia covers half the world in population.  Arguably they haven't been good enough on the field for the 4.5 spots they have been assigned.  But they are half the world in population!  China mostly made it on their own merits in 2002.  In that year there were 2.5 Asian teams plus the two hosts.  In all subsequent World Cups there were 4.5 Asian teams.  I guess if you consider that Australia joined Asia for 2010, 2002 was an easier year to qualify.  But it wasn't that easy.  I don't think this is really a conspiracy."
worldcup,2ycd17,dejour,6,Sun Mar 8 17:09:55 2015 UTC,"In Spanish... Clasificar = Classify .... Calificar = Qualify ... Maybe the two words mean something different in each language I don't know.  South America has 4 places of the World Cup and the five is defined by repechage.  Historically FIFA gave places for the World Cup depending of how many countries have a good Football level in the region, not by how many countries the region have, and it is the best way.  You can't remove one good team from South America for a bad team from Asia. It's bad decrease the level of the World Cup."
worldcup,2ycd17,dejour,8,Sun Mar 8 17:30:07 2015 UTC,"I don't know Spanish at all, but in English the word you are looking for is qualify.  Maybe classificar means classify in most situations, but when talking about sports it doesn't? (No offence intended, if I tried to write something in Spanish it would be horrible.)  I do agree that CONMEBOL shouldn't lose a spot.  In fact, they should gain a spot.  Last World Cup there were 6 teams from South America, and I think that is the right number.  But that was only temporary because Brazil was the host.  The Asian teams are the worst.  However, there is a good reason for them to have at least 4 teams.  4.5 billion people live there.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup_qualification#Qualification_spots_by_continent  My suggestion for 2018:   Africa: 4.5 Asia: 4 Oceania: 0.5 Europe: 12.5 + host CONCACAF: 4 CONMEBOL: 5.5"

USA 94 was a huge success and set a an overall attendance record that still stands today.   I am sure that the USA could host another very successful World Cup that would be attended and watched by millions and be vastly profitable for FIFA. It would also help raise the profile of football in North America and give the MLS a major boost.
worldcup,2x97vx,Zur1ch,6,Fri Feb 27 04:31:44 2015 UTC,"The amount of diversity of nationalities in the country is amazing. There are communities of denizens from around the world living across this nation. There are people from every country on Earth. Our facilities are world-class, we have the infrastructure/hotels/airports. Plus, you would see a totally different US than in '94. The sport has become SO much more popular since then, but there's still immense room for growth. Most Americans only care about the World Cup, but when the World Cup comes around, the entire country watches. The influx of vacationers for the World Cup would be no problem whatsoever for us, we could honestly hold it within a few months notice. Qatar, on the other hand, is a country of 2 million, extremely small, and you can't even fucking drink there (I know, there will be tents). That sounds like a lot of fun drinking budweiser the entire World Cup with no bar options. Oh, and I can't wait for how happy other, more strict Middle Eastern countries will fucking love the bikinis and debauchery that the World Cup should have."
worldcup,2x97vx,surfingNerd,3,Fri Feb 27 04:49:15 2015 UTC,I totally agree with everything you say. I think the U.S. would hold an absolutely amazing World Cup and I just don't see any disadvantages.

It is kind of shocking though... they would make far more money I would think in the USA if they held it here. Which goes back to the corruption... The representatives don't care how much FIFA makes during the tournament in 10 or so years, when they might not be there. But if a country puts a million dollars in their pocket right now to vote on their country, of course they're going to do that (because they are with FIFA and have no integrity... and Sepp Blatter can suck my dick)."

worldcup,2x97vx,ohchristworld,7,Thu Feb 26 22:29:35 2015 UTC,The world cup needs to have a list of approved countries that the tournament rotates. These countries should already have the infrastructure to handle the games. If a country wants to be added to the list they get their assets together and apply to be on the list.

worldcup,2x97vx,worldwarzen,2,Thu Feb 26 23:56:06 2015 UTC,"Couple things: -- One of my best friends is a pilot and he was stationed in Qatar with the Air Force. He said the country is not set up to run any type of international event, especially the World Cup. He said not only is the heat terrible, even in the winter, it is a dirty country and he wasn't talking about the desert. The fact that they still make women cover themselves and homosexuality is a legal makes this a terrible situation for World Cup fans and any country who competes in it.  -- The countries who are against guitar having the World Cup need to get together and boycott. They cannot allow this to happen. They don't want it to happen. The need to have an organized boycott. It's the only way to stop this world come from happening.  -- The United States or England should've gotten this Cup in the first place. It has been long enough for both countries. This whole ""everybody gets their turn"" shit has been proven not to work anywhere else in society. Why did FIFA think it was gonna work for them?"
worldcup,2x97vx,Mattstts,1 point,Fri Feb 27 06:26:52 2015 UTC,You list many of the reasons why Qatar should not have the World Cup and each reason on its own should be enough to disqualify Qatar from hosting.    Ideally England should have got the 2018 World Cup (of course I am being bias here) and the USA the 2022 World Cup. Even if the Qatar World Cup was revoked based on the FIFA rules I don't think the same federation could host two World Cups in a row. For me would make the USA the most likely candidate for 2022.  It could be nice to see Qatar lose the World Cup and for it to go to the U.S. but realistically I just do not see it happening. FIFA seem determined to make the Qatar World Cup happen.

Their plans were so ridiculously nonsensical (floating artificial clouds? air-conditioned outdoor stadiums? wtf?), and they are so unprepared for something on this scale that their bid was rated dead last. There were other bids from countries that were much better prepared to host it, but Qatar bribed a bunch of FIFA officials and here we are."

worldcup,2wzd8b,bigskymind,11,Tue Feb 24 21:16:30 2015 UTC,I was thinking about how its around 90 degrees there on a regular basis. I live in Florida where its around 80 during the summer and I'd probably die going to Qatar. Also some people are concerned with slavery issues which is pretty understandable.
worldcup,2wzd8b,peachy_clean,1 point,Tue Feb 24 18:59:03 2015 UTC,Let me put it to you this way. Do you really think Qatar needs that infastructure? Like the Beijing Olympics or the countless olmpics held in Russia the infastructure built for these events is not really ever used outside of the event it was built for. I think for the environments sake they should pick countries who already have the adequate infastructure to host such an event. It's just not good for the environment to keep building these crazy stadiums in the middle of nowhere. sure they haven't had a cup in Qatar but wouldn't you say the UK has the infastructure to hold the tournament right now? That's why I think the UK should have gotten the bid.

worldcup,2wzpwd,Erudio2,2,Tue Feb 24 16:04:01 2015 UTC,As much as I love the World Cup it should not be played during the regular league season.

Its a nation state that basically tricks poor workers into coming to work for them and then confining them to slave labor with no way out until many of them die of heat exhaustion. Not to mention the are in the middle of the FUCKING DESERT with no futbol team or stadiums and they believe they should host the world cup!   And on note with FIFA, I've been to the last 5 World Cup tournaments. While every large organization has some corruption we all live with, FIFA has gotten out of control and I no longer support them. Personally, I believe it started around 2010 and South Africa. The World Cup or other huge events shouldn't be given to countries with infrastructure problems, or counties that just don't need them. Many countries waste millions on investments they will never get back only to host some matches. Look at Sao Palo, Brazil. They just hosted the World Cup and now they are litteraly out of water telling millions of people they are better off leaving the city. Maybe they should have skipped the world cup and the Olympics and freaking invested in infrastructure and schools."

worldcup,2wwjp5,alien97,2,Tue Feb 24 04:42:41 2015 UTC,Because the WC hasn't been in North America since '94.  Think of things as being in which continent the tournament is hosted.

worldcup,2wckyk,Tim-Sanchez,0,Thu Feb 19 07:49:59 2015 UTC,Okay but they also aren't playing 3-4 times a week in their league like the NHL does so the amount of games missed would be pretty equal.

Between the slave labor, politics, and questionable ethics of Qatar, it would've been much better to award this World Cup elsewhere.  Not only is the winter schedule an issue but there is the serious concern about the large numbers of deaths and human beings being held against their will in order to build the stadiums and infrastructure that are needed to host this World Cup."

I honestly do not know very much about Canada other than it is awesome. I have been pretty much everywhere in Europe and Australia, but only to Niagra in Canada.

Its stunning.  It looks like they only play in Winnipeg, Vancouver, With the possibility in Round of 16 to play in Moncton and Edmonton.

My roommate was super stoked on it, so I just did the smile and nod, but holy Christ is this a terrible jersey. Colours of the fabric are noticeably different shades, shoddy stitching, but the most glaring defect was the lettering. The lettering isn't even freaking straight. It looks just shit awful.

I'm sure it would work out to be a loss, just like the recent Brazil one, what would we gain from this ? a few hundred million in toursim compared to 12 billion is costs.  You can keep your stinking world cup, we have AFL :)"
worldcup,2ugmnh,burgasushi,9,Mon Feb 2 01:12:54 2015 UTC,"I doubt it would cost that much given we already have most of, if not all, the infrastructure to host it. The reason it is so expensive for other countries is that they need to build the infrastructure (e.g. Stadiums to hold capacity crowds etc).   Edit: grammar."
worldcup,2ugmnh,guidedlight,2,Mon Feb 2 04:15:27 2015 UTC,I think it would probably be more than 12 Billion in Australia. Other countries seem to achieve a lot more for less money. A $500 million stadium in Brazil would easily be a $1 billion stadium in Australia.  Also a lot of the cost associated with hosting the World Cup is the massive tax breaks which are given to Fifa and it's sponsors. Even individuals employed by Fifa in Australia would be exempt from paying any income tax.
worldcup,2ugmnh,burgasushi,3,Mon Feb 2 07:52:06 2015 UTC,"I don't see why we'd have to build any new stadiums, more public transport, accommodation or hospitality. At most we might need to increase some of those services but yeah."

You can't move the WC to the winter because of the individual league seasons and the Olympics. Hundreds of migrant workers are literally being worked to death to build the arenas. Last I heard, Qatar can't even build the number of arena they told  FIFA they would build. They want other matches to be played in neighboring nations. Qatar has never made a WC. Ever. Giving them the WC basically takes a spot from a deserving squad/nation. Homosexuality is a crime. Alcohol is barely tolerated for non-Muslims. It's fucking Qatar.   I honestly wish that they'd admit they were bribed. That way we'd know they had a ""legitimate"" reason to vote for Qatar. If they weren't bribed, they're just fucking idiots."

When that promise/condition went out the window at an early stage, that's when the alarm bells should have gone off and the whole process run again.  I've said this before jokingly, but there are better footballing reasons for staging the World Cup in Northern Ireland than Qatar.  Both countries are roughly the same size, but Northern Ireland has qualified for the World Cup on three occasions, making the quarter final in 1958.  The Irish FA- governing body of football in Northern Ireland- has been in existence since 1880 and affiliated with FIFA since 1911. By comparison the Qatar FA is something of a Johnny-come-lately, having only been formed in 1960 and affiliated with FIFA since 1972.  This is, of course, a joke as Northern Ireland is not a suitable venue for the World Cup, but by the same metric nor is Qatar."

worldcup,2sroiz,rocksampson,8,Sat Jan 17 21:22:18 2015 UTC,"Football is probably one of the top2 passions I have in life. I love watching the World Cup and more or less subconciously divide my progress I have made in life between the different installments.  To me, it's just so incredibly special that I would feel bad about it being somewhat devalued by having it less often. It's just the biggest global thing we have on this planet (no offense, Olympic Games)."
worldcup,2sroiz,CeterumCenseo85,4,Sat Jan 17 21:46:13 2015 UTC,"Agreed, it is much more relatable than the Olympic sports. I'd just like to see more accessible games for people around the world and take less focus off of corrupt hosting decisions while seeing greater national team development.  But yearly tournaments wouldn't be realistic with qualifiers, and I guess national team development is the responsibility of each team."
worldcup,2sroiz,CeterumCenseo85,3,Sat Jan 17 22:03:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah. Even when leaving aside the whole ""do you even want yearly tournaments?"" there's the much bigger issue: clubs would go baslistic if their players had to play a world cup EACH summer.  Like for Germany, a lot of our players were completly physically devastated after the World Cup. Schweinsteiger for example has been playing the entire season basically injured/part-time because of it. Same is true for many more of the starting players."
worldcup,2sroiz,CeterumCenseo85,1 point,Sat Jan 17 22:10:05 2015 UTC,"Yes the club/national team conflict doesn't exist in motorsports, and the players are hardly machines (although CR7 could be a droid's name). Maybe the Champion's League could expand in the future if clubs outside Europe grow enough?  The World Cup final match can still be every four years, but the rounds could have more time between (giving time for injury recovery) and could have distributed hosts. This timing would encroach on UEFA Euro and the other regional tournaments, so they could be merged."
worldcup,2sroiz,OfficialGreenTea,5,Sat Jan 17 23:08:46 2015 UTC,"The way I feel about this, with the World Cup streeched out over 4 years, it would lose a lot of its appeal. Not only would the team you enter the tournament with often look different from the one you end it with, there's also less hype about the play-off games because they feel so unconnected to everything, almost like friendly games."
worldcup,2sroiz,SeattleBattles,1 point,Sat Jan 17 23:21:18 2015 UTC,"Yes this is the final blow to the idea. Almost no one in the US watched our qualifiers in comparison to our 4 tournament matches, and that interest is too thin to stretch.  The International Champions Cup and Bayern's tour of the US this summer had very high attendance, so maybe a non-friendly International Champions Cup would be more realistic as clubs have many non-local supporters, although it will be a very long time before we see clubs outside of UEFA that are competitive enough to expand the current Champion's League."

So I'm rushing to sit in the seat next to her and when I get to her she instantly comes off as having an ""I'm too good"" complex, she doesn't even acknowledge or try to move her crossed legs even a damn inch for me (think trying to squeeze by in a movie theater), when I tried to step around her in my high ass heels I nearly lost my balance and almost fell backwards off the damn stage.  Other people showed concern but not her. Ever since then I have thought Hope solo was a real bitch (this was before the domestic abuse thing).

worldcup,2saddq,EskimoNorth,1 point,Wed Jan 14 13:53:28 2015 UTC,"2 things not usually mentioned regarding the 2015 Women's WC:  -The players had lots of time to protest the artificial turf, but chose to start this process after anything could be legally done about it.  -Very few countries wanted to host the 2015 Women's WC. The options were Canada or Zimbabwe. Zimbabwe withdrew it's bid in March 2011. It would be nice to see some gratitude from the players. Their reactions will affect other countries' decisions to host future WCs."
worldcup,2saddq,xizore,10,Tue Jan 13 17:51:57 2015 UTC,"no idea what you are talking about.   WWC isn't part of a governmental body.  the only ""legal"" thing timing wise is that any action taken by the players would have to be after the turf is announced.  that's the only date that affects this prior to the kick off of the games has no bearing on whether FIFA induced the Canadian FA to break Canadian law.   More the point if you want to see FIFA reformed, you should support the players as this is the first time I am aware of that FIFA ran into national laws and have a very good chance of losing.  if they lose, then via treaties with Switzerland, the players can go after FIFA's books even under swiss law.   FIFA has spent a lot of time and effort making sure they never have to follow any local laws and therefore never have to reveal the moneytrail.   this would break that wide open."
worldcup,2saddq,cnhn,3,Tue Jan 13 22:01:38 2015 UTC,"This isn't breaking Canadian law. There is no discrimination because pretty much every tournament played in Canada (Men and Women) is played on turf.  World Cups in other countries are irrelevant, and even if they were, you'd have to prove that the turf vs. grass decision was being made based on gender rather than economics."

At what point ever has the Canadian Men's National team played a world cup..heck even a qualifer on Turf?  Near as I can figure, never is the correct answer.  And that's kinda of the crux of the matter that they are suing over. if your point was true then the mens national team would also be playing on turf and they aren't."
worldcup,2saddq,cnhn,3,Wed Jan 14 01:05:57 2015 UTC,That's mostly because they can play at BMO field (where they play pretty much all of their home games). Canada doesn't have any World Cup caliber stadia that support actual grass.
worldcup,2saddq,RagingIce,1 point,Wed Jan 14 01:11:11 2015 UTC,Solving that technical problem has been known for at least 20 plus years.  You might remember in 1994 they went so far as to develop grass that can grow inside in order to put a grass field down inside the detroit silverdome for the men's world cup.    But thanks for agreeing that they wouldn't make the men play on turf.
worldcup,2saddq,cnhn,2,Wed Jan 14 01:44:06 2015 UTC,I didn't agree with you. If there was a Men's tournament in Canada it would be played on turf.  Grass is not an option in Canada. The CFL season is in full swing during the WC.
worldcup,2saddq,RagingIce,6,Wed Jan 14 01:49:16 2015 UTC,i think you over estimate the difficulty in installing grass over turf.  Heck there are now stadiums that default to having both on hand just so they can switch back and forth  Heck even UEFA has had experience with planting grass straight on to the turf for their womens' cup  So the reality is that it's completely do-able
worldcup,2saddq,cnhn,2,Wed Jan 14 02:11:19 2015 UTC,"At what point ever has the Canadian Men's National team played a world cup..heck even a qualifier on Turf?

But I strongly recommend going to the Ticketing page and reading the pdfs guides on ticketing.  I recommend on buying the tickets early just to make sure you are squared away come game day. White the games maybe won't sell out, Murphys law has a way to kicking in, and it's better than getting it from a scalper.

The real problem would be field quality - you'd have to wrangle up somewhere between 12-16 stadiums capable of seating 50K+ that aren't so demolished from football season that they'll be usable. This is partially why Seattle is so rarely used by the USMNT - the Sounders play in a stadium with FieldTurf, not natural grass. But outside of that, it is in FIFA's best interest to move the Cup around more often than that - it is, after all, the world's game. No country has hosted more than twice in the history of the Cup, and that's fine - there's plenty of countries with infrastructure that would require minimal updating to host the cup. Off the top of my head: US, England, France, Germany, Italy, Russia...hell, Japan, China, and Mexico might be capable of hosting without too much strain. I'd include Brazil but we just clearly saw that wasn't really the case. Spain's been broke for awhile but they've got enough stadiums, right?  Other point against it - the competitive advantage the host gets. Both with the easy Group A (only one host has ever not advanced out of group stage - South Africa in 2010), the influx of home fans, the ease of travel compared to the rest of the teams...those are not small points. Other countries would raise a stink just on that alone.  But all this said, I still want the Cup in America as often as possible."

The old astroturf was crap, but the new stuff is very nice and studies are showing fewer injuries than even grass. More independent studies need to be done,  but if both teams are playing on the surface it is fair for  both. Also, football stadiums would have plenty of time to install sod between January and summer."

Sliding on FieldTurf is better than old astroturf, but it's still more painful than sod) and more about how the ball behaves."

Obviously, he wouldn't have been spotted by Barca at that young of an age, but he would've progressed through soccer academies and played collegiate soccer at a powerhouse.  By then a pro team would've noticed him, so he's maybe Messi with 75% of his skills now.  He'd be on the USMNT with the likes of Donovan."
worldcup,2q3yon,DaegobahDan,1 point,Tue Dec 23 05:08:08 2014 UTC,"Yeah Donovan and Adu aren't even on the same plane of existence. Messi deserves to be in the conversation of all time greats. Maybe not in the same sentence as Pele and Maradona, but definitely top 10.   He would not have reached that level in a country with no talent development system. And no, big foreign teams don't start scouting US players until college and even that is pretty rare."

worldcup,2q3yon,ChucklesOHoolihan,2,Wed Dec 24 04:32:11 2014 UTC,He'd have been a great DIII basketball point guard.
worldcup,2q3yon,cojiba,1 point,Tue Dec 23 03:38:53 2014 UTC,"No way.  Guard on a mid-major basketball team.  Gets a scholarship, a bite or two at the Tourney, maybe he's in the backcourt for Butler as they go to the Final Four.  No NBA prospects at all. He's too short. Too short even for Europe -- too short for Barcelona."
worldcup,2q3yon,jello24,9,Tue Dec 23 05:08:38 2014 UTC,"As a Canadian, I don't think we'll even get past the qualifying stages, even if we had both Ronaldo and Messi. Our National Team let in 8 goals against Honduras the last time out, so yeah."

worldcup,2q3yon,dyegored,1 point,Tue Dec 23 03:59:40 2014 UTC,I honestly think Messi would have gotten discouraged as a kid and left the sport. Our development so far has been focused on physicality. Kids who are big for their age dominate while others get discouraged and can leave the sport before developing the actual Fundamentals. Messi was never big so...
worldcup,2q3yon,zazzlekdazzle,10,Tue Dec 23 06:10:31 2014 UTC,"If he played for the Netherlands then we would have at least made it to the finals, Mascherano can't mark him and Robben at the same time."

worldcup,2q3yon,Robber_Rob,3,Tue Dec 23 01:44:13 2014 UTC,I imagine he would have played behind RVP with Robben and Depay on the wings. Sneijder would either be benched or play further back. Probably benched though. Gotta have more defensive minded players covering all these attacking players.

worldcup,2q3yon,hamza__11,16,Mon Dec 22 22:42:31 2014 UTC,"You've got to be kidding if you think that club and paycheck allegiance trumps world cup glory.  The world cup is the greatest triumph any player could have, worth a lifetime of million dollar paychecks and champions league victories.  This is very little more than an excuse to justify Ronaldo not being able to pull his team out of the group stages."
worldcup,2q3yon,colmshan1990,4,Tue Dec 23 01:43:01 2014 UTC,Do you know about Angel Di Maria getting the letter from Real Madrid forbidding him from playing in the final?
worldcup,2q3yon,JudLew,1 point,Tue Dec 23 01:59:44 2014 UTC,"Even if this were true (and I doubt it, otherwise Madrid would be in hot water), I am 100% that it didn't affect Di Maria's decision.  Did you know that in the 2010 WC, Arjen Robben suffered a tear in his thigh an INCH deep and still continued playing, even though his playing in the final cost Bayern Munich about 2/3rds of a season without him?  Bayern consequently barely made the CL because they didn't have their best player for most of their season."
worldcup,2q3yon,colmshan1990,2,Tue Dec 23 02:04:16 2014 UTC,It was true.
worldcup,2q3yon,spotster,3,Tue Dec 23 11:59:04 2014 UTC,"Torres played through injury too.  He played a key part in the build up to the World Cup winning goal, but it cost him his future career as a world class striker."
worldcup,2q3yon,Pasuckuakohowog,2,Tue Dec 23 02:24:15 2014 UTC,"That's my point really.  WC glory trumps almost literally everything else.  The idea that Ronaldo was ""holding back"" because Madrid asked him to is nothing short of absurd."
worldcup,2q3yon,Wookie_Monster090898,2,Tue Dec 23 02:25:27 2014 UTC,"Yup.  Winning the World Cup is worth it.  Now if he'd lost that final, Torres might have second guessed his decision for the rest of his life. But that's the nature of risking something for the biggest prize in football"

worldcup,2q3yon,edu_sanzio,1 point,Tue Dec 23 07:38:00 2014 UTC,Arguably he would've created better possession and have the creativity to fuel Dempsey. Our offense would have been significantly more powerful and our midfield would likely keep the ball better.

Would the worlds ""good guys"" kill countless of civils, fabricate evidence to goes to war, make state coups, for their own interests? Certainly not.

worldcup,2ps1g6,cowmix88,7,Sat Dec 20 03:18:37 2014 UTC,"I think anyone remotely familiar with soccer and reality can say:  RUSSIA obviously should host the world cup. Yes they have some fucked up politics, but so do most countries, either currently, or they are currently living off the power and wealth created by fucked up policies.   QATAR should not be hosting a world cup for at least 100 years OR until they actually fucking qualify for one. This is the biggest outrage. They have no stadiums, a shit league, a FIFA world ranking comparable to greenland, no soccer heritage, and its pretty fucking obvious that they bribed whoever they had to at FIFA. Qatar has done nothing to deserve hosting a WC - not even in ancient history.   Hosts in my opinion should be Russia and .... Well, none of the 2022 bigs should have gotten besides possible Australia. I dont understand why so many great potential hosts put in for 2018 but 2022 was a shit show. Really, England should have gotten 2022. Its been 60 years since their last host, they have the stadiums and everything, and you cant tell me that the EPL hasnt done wonders for football's popularity worldwide and that england doesn't deserve it."

I know this might sound oddly conservative but i think there should be some story, some history in the place that will be crowning the new world champion. IF for no other reason, i think so because building all new stadiums in a non-soccer country is a giant economic nightmare and horrendously unfair for the many of the people in that country.   I would be 1000000% in favor of a fifa law that said something to the effect of: No more than 50% of the stadiums used in the world cup can be constructed after the world cup is awarded and must stay in regular use for 5 years after the cup. That way it not only ensures the the WC goes to a semi soccer-important but that completely bullshit bribery and politicking dont fuck over the poor populations of countries that spend their social welfare allowances on a world cup that doesn't do shit for most people in the country."

worldcup,2ps1g6,Stimorolus,7,Fri Dec 19 20:52:43 2014 UTC,I guess I don't understand your point. You're comparing American and Russian political status of gays.

Can I go back to Stalin's great plan and the legions of dead for my next point or is there some type of limitation you have on dredging up the past?
worldcup,2ps1g6,TheWalrusRule,-6,Fri Dec 19 21:24:43 2014 UTC,"Sorry not for clarifying it better, what I meant with the racism back in the 50-60s is that it changed. Hopefully within a few decades the sentiment to gays in Russia will change, like it slowly has around in most western countries.  You have to remember the culture in Russia is that we are strong and we value friendship and family, and that there are genderroles. Many people associate gays with people like this guy and ofc he have the right to be like this, but many would deem him weak and feminine, and this is why Russia made these gay laws. It is to protect children from this so they can be raised 'ideally' to become strong well respected men.   It is not illegal to be gay in russia, but to be openly flamboyant and exposing children to gay culture is. It is backward yes, but again alot of russians are fine with these laws because of their culture and we must just respect that for now. It doesnt mean that gaybars are being closed and stuff, gays just have to tone it down a bit in public areas.  This whole new homosexual movement thing is quite new to them, and it will take time before it becomes acceptable. My guess would be that in 50 years or so russians would be mostly okay with gays. Stuff like this take times, just as the end of open racism toward black people.

Since you ask why /u/sep11insidejob hold that oppinion and not just insult him I will give you my two cents.  First of all, yes russia isn't perfect, but there is nothing wrong with them hosting the world cup 2018. You bring up the illegal to be gay. That is not true.   It's illegal to be openly gay and spread gay propaganda, as they call it, in the public because it's very foreign concept to many russians and viewed down on. These 'anti-gay' laws are in place to protect children to exposed to it. Yes it's a bit backward, but hey, 50 years ago it was acceptable to call black people niggers in USA and alot of americans still view down upon gay people. It's all about culture.  You say the russian media is state controlled, and you know what, it probably is in the sense that they broadcast stuff from the russian perspective, but so does many american medias. They have alot of agendas and you know it.  If you want to bring up the ukrainian crisis, then remember there are so much more than just to annex land. USA and soviet agreed some decades ago to try unite europe more, but USA went behind soviets back and started incircling them with NATO and military bases (which they are trying to do with China now) and Soviet felt betrayed rightly so.  Also not to mention all the innocent blood USA have on their hands, yes Soviet also have their fair share of innocent blood, but the difference is that kinda ended in the late '60s while USA still to this day drop bombs around the world.  And it doesnt make it particular better when americans claim moral high ground.  Think of this, after 9/11 your president said to the world; ""either your with us, or your against us!"" Imagine how that sounds to the rest of the world.  Also remember who stopped USA from bombing Syria? Russia did. Russia also abolished death penalty, which USA still has.  It wouldnt be farfetched to call USA a modern autocracy.  So in the grand picture I would say Russia is on a moral high ground when compared to USA.  How I view Russia and Putin, is they are a strong country that stand up for themself.  This is why it pisses me off that so many americans have an issue with russia and them hosting worlc cup 2018. Frankly americans can fuck off if they think so."

worldcup,2oj6y2,beach-bum,7,Sun Dec 7 07:00:37 2014 UTC,I don't understand the artificial turf issue. Surely there has to be a quality turf that can be used for football.
worldcup,2oj6y2,samcbar,8,Sun Dec 7 14:58:41 2014 UTC,"The problem is that turf can't self repair like grass can, so it has to be sturdy enough that it doesn't get destroyed.  The side effect of that is that it will not give and break away if the player attempts an overly hard cut, so the player's body is more likely to be the thing to give way."
worldcup,2oj6y2,GymIn26Minutes,2,Sun Dec 7 18:39:18 2014 UTC,"I can't find the video now, but it was on ESPN.  It was explaining how the rate of injury for ACL and other injuries is far higher on a turf field vs grass.  Turf fields also retain heat more so than grass so the players will actually be playing in warmer conditions than the spectators watching the game.  The ball will move and act different on a turf field as well compared to grass which will be difficult for the keepers to react properly if they've been used to playing on a grass field.  When players have been interviewed on how they feel regarding grass vs turf they make different decisions while playing the game.  EDIT: Found the video, but it looks like it got taken down?"

Slightly less than two-thirds of the exposure time was spent on grass while more that 75% of the injuries occurred on grass. When we combined all injuries across both matches and training, we found that the risk of injury on turf was 10-14% lower that on grass. This was the case for males and females as well as youth and adults. As for specific injuries, there was a lower risk of knee, ankle and foot injuries on turf. The risk of muscle strains was similar for both surfaces.    EDIT: Artificial Turf Isn't Astroturf anymore."

Soil gives, grass can create slippery mud spots in the rain.  It adds an additional challenge to the athletes and elevates the level of play.

I'll be happy when FIFA blows up and is replaced by a better, transparent organization but I am unwilling to praise Sony for not renewing their contract. Decisions like this are made well in advance and have nothing to  do with the current crisis.   I am happy if this means we're closer to an overhaul at FIFA."
worldcup,2nd812,Strixxi,8,Tue Nov 25 15:45:17 2014 UTC,"You're shooting yourself in the foot, you know. Sony's actions aren't going to tank FIFA, not at all. Our support of companies choosing to take actions like these will though. Sony could be just the first to pull sponsorship, and if that seems to have gone well for Sony, other companies will seriously consider doing the same.  No one is altruistic in this, as much as we may want to believe there are human reasons behind decisions like these. It's all just business, and it's up to the consumer to tell the companies what they are and are not willing to pay for/support.   All statements like yours say is ""it doesn't matter what you do."""
worldcup,2nd812,ConqueringCanada,-4,Tue Nov 25 16:30:51 2014 UTC,"In what way does my statement suggest it doesn't matter what you do? That's lazy commentary.   The decision made by Sony was economic. If they felt that their bid, their sponsorship, was worth whatever their competitor bid, they would have paid it. Now through whatever decision making process and risk assessment they performed, they deemed it was not worth the cost. Their replacement sponsor, who ever that is, will pay more for sponsorship than Sony was prepared to pay. That could be a reduced rate based on current and past allegations. That does not mean the next deal will be lower than $280M (but it's probably lower due to the circus atmosphere around FIFA).   It's a convenient dialogue to suggest Sony is walking away from FIFA due solely to this scandal."
worldcup,2nd812,Strixxi,3,Tue Nov 25 17:19:33 2014 UTC,"but I am unwilling to praise Sony for not renewing their contract.   You almost sound like you understand how economics work... but this part of your view is really misguided, and is why I say you are working against your own goal."

worldcup,2nd812,Strixxi,1 point,Tue Nov 25 21:27:51 2014 UTC,"It has nothing to do with Sony. It has to do with playing your role as the consumer. If we say ""Who cares that Sony said that."" The PR group goes ""Guess this is something that doesn't matter to our consumer, it won't affect our bottom line!""   It's not about Sony, it's about showing companies that we approve of them making smart social decisions like that. Who cares if they are only paying attention to their budget, that's all any company pays attention to. What matters is showing them what does and does not affect their revenue."

worldcup,2n2o3s,Trashcanman33,7,Sat Nov 22 13:21:56 2014 UTC,"I can't tell you how much it would cost. Just a few inputs:   I don't know about inland flight costs. But I used some trains in Russia. I don't think they are going to raise prices a lot for the trains so this can be a reference point. Google Map is a help to get a general idea in how long it would you take from city to city. But be aware that there are several kinds of trains (luxury intercity trains with WLAN and reserved seat down to slow commuter trains without toilets). So you might find a train website to see prices and times. Using trains only would limit you to the cities Moscow, St.Petersburg, Saranszk and N.Novgorod. I wouldn't spend your holiday with more boring train hours. I know the Euro2020 is not the WC but this would be an awesome opportunity to do a Eurotrip using trains. (There are train passes for whole europe. See eurail.com, raileurope.com etc.)"

worldcup,2n2o3s,Bacch,4,Sat Nov 22 18:45:10 2014 UTC,"Depends on how you get the tickets and how they're distributed.  If you go through the lottery, they can be surprisingly affordable.  When I went to South Africa, the tickets to the actual games were a fraction of the expense of travel itself.  Germany on the other hand, we didn't get tickets through the lottery and wound up paying over USD$2,000 per ticket."

One suggestion to avoid absurd airline costs is to fly to an area outside of Russia then head in by train. You'll have to do research to figure out what city(s) you want to head to but Tallinn is amazing and close to St. Petersburg.
worldcup,2n2o3s,drphillysblunt,3,Sun Nov 23 04:37:44 2014 UTC,"You could go to Helsinki, Finland and take the high speed Allegro to St. Petersburg.  But it would be a shame to not see Tallinn, beautiful city."
worldcup,2n2o3s,xeothought,2,Sun Nov 23 09:59:10 2014 UTC,"Went to Brazil for world cup. I'd say a good estimate would be flight + $100-150 a day for room and board + $100-200 a day for drinks, food, taxis, fun stuff. I went to 2 games and they were $150 each. Maybe figure $250 for knockout games.  So for a week and 2 knockout games an estimate would be $2000-3000 plus flight."
worldcup,2n2o3s,ACardAttack,2,Sat Nov 22 17:36:36 2014 UTC,You might consider asking /r/travel about the average costs of visiting Russia... and then maybe you can use those non-inflated prices as you minimum base-line.

I have played soccer since before I could remember. I was a referee for 11 years. I love the sport. But I have already personally committed to boycotting the Qatar World Cup. I will not attend the event (although that really doesn't change anything because I wouldn't have had the money anyways), but I will not watch a single minute of the tournament and will boycott all sponsors for the duration of the event itself."

worldcup,2ma84k,hamza__11,-1,Sat Nov 15 09:33:50 2014 UTC,A huge huge huge problem about the England football team is the fans - The Germans won the World Cup beating the hosts 7:1 on the way and England were one of the worst teams at the tournament and they feel it's appropriate to sing this  shit rather than hang their heads in shame about their own team. FUCK ING PATHETIC.

Garcia submitted a bunch of work that found strong evidence of corruption and ethical violations, Eckert made a report that basically said ""we're all good"" and FIFA now gets to say ""nothing wrong was found we're ok.""

That's purely editorializing. He was asked how gay fans would be welcome in Qatar and he didn't give much of an answer (or at least I can't tease much substance out of his words).  The article talks about serving alcohol, for which the guy also doesn't give much of an answer beyond the fact that a solution may be possible. Great.  It's further evidence that there was never a decision-making process taken by the idiots who voted for Qatar. If there were any serious consideration as to who the best host country would be, do you think the media would still be failing to dig up answers to really elementary questions around whether Qatar is even capable of hosting a World Cup 4 years after it was chosen?"

My reasoning stems from the fact that most if not all the practices taking place in Qatar that we find disagreeable aren't much different from how things are in the UAE. So if they really were up in arms over human rights issues, they would be focusing their intentions on things happening in their own backyard. So after easily ruling that out, the only obvious explanation is it being a business and/or political strategy."
worldcup,2l9fcq,thelostdolphin,2,Tue Nov 4 17:52:53 2014 UTC,"As stated in the article they pulled out because of allegations against FIFA and the fact they don't want to be associated with a company involved in so many scandals.

Abu Dhabi have Etihad. They are direct competitors on a global scale.   Secondly i'm assuming you have never been to the UAE so you know very little about the country itself or the way in which it's governed. Dubai and Abu Dhabi have a big difference in the way which migrant workers are treated. The UAE government has set up in place all the safeguards necessary to protect workers through the Ministry of Labour. It's the employers who abuse their workers...private firms and when they get caught, they pay heavy fines or their license is revoked. However it is each Emirate that must enforce these laws as they see fit.    They flog people for having premarital sex, stone to death women who commit adultery...   Thirdly, please provide a source or an article that this has ACTUALLY happened here or strike through it. I live in Dubai, dating, non-married couples and sex is pretty easy to find. They sell condoms in the grocery stores and petrol stations behind the counters.   As for adultery, yes it is a serious crime if you are found guilty but as far as I know I haven't heard of stoning occurring here, most will just do a prison term and be deported whether they are male or female. The flogging and stoning laws are laws that still exist but are never/rarely enforced. Like there are plenty of dumb laws that are still in place in the UK. Source  If you have any misconceptions please head over to /r/dubai and ask around."
worldcup,2l9fcq,HSBLESSPLZ,1 point,Wed Nov 5 05:07:36 2014 UTC,"Because of Dubai's extremely restricted freedoms of press and speech, trying to get an accurate assessment of how often stoning or flogging takes place is very difficult for human rights organizations, as they can be easily suppressed by the authoritarian government, much in the same way that worker's deaths are being suppressed in Dubai much like Qatar.   Here are just a few of the thousands of sources I found doing a very simple search.

Suppressed? Worker deaths are reported all the time due to negligence from the private contractors part who abuse their workers. it is reported. did you know that by law, workers aren't allowed to work between 11-15:00 during summer months due to the heat. example article   http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/construction-industry-human-rights-qatar-dubai-russia   Qatar is nothing like the UAE but of course everyone generalises the UAE as one place and think all countries are run in the same manner. Qatar is a horrific place for any worker because they barely have the employment infrastructure. Dubai on the other hand the government tries their best to look after both employees and employers. You get a mixed bag of corruptness from both sides.Employers are by law required to open a bank account in their employees name and a wage must go in every month with little variance for allowances (petrol, housing etc...) This is to ensure that employees are paid their dues on time. Of course you have employers who will not declare their workers same as any country anywhere in the world where you get illegal labour such as the UK US France etc... and it's those workers who get abused as they do not know better and are afraid to contact the authorities or sometimes don't even know their rights.   http://ibtimes.com/dubai-safe-female-travelers-norwegian-woman-jailed-over-rape-report-warns-others-1354317   Ah this familiar story. your article isn't even the full story. Always gets brought up by people who either don't read the full article or don't understand the legal system. She wasn't jailed for rape. she was jailed for lying to the police. yes she was raped after getting drunk with a colleague. she then reported it to the police. Police began to investigate. She then took the advice of her manager and told the police it was actually consensual sex (falsely reporting rape). But wait she admitted drinking in a public place. so they charged her with that. She's also admitted to the police pre-marital sex. she got charged her with that. (here no-one cares about pre-marital sex as long as its not reported and its behind closed doors). But her coup de grace was when she went back and changed her story AGAIN. So now shes committed perjury and lied to the police while giving a statement. And finally because her story caused uproar between the people here, the Sheikh himself pardoned her before she even served a day of her 16month sentence. So thats the full story   http://travel.aol.co.uk/2013/10/20/british-woman-rebecca-blake-jailed-sex-in-taxi-dubai-could-have-been-stoned-death/   Okay so you come to a country where you KNOW pre-marital sex is illegal. So sex in a public place is absolutely a big no-no. Now who knows what really happened in the back of that taxi but she was convicted. Not sure if she was ""forgotten"" but you can get a sentence extended for misbehaving inside. Actually she got in trouble with the law again after getting drunk, calling paramedics and her ""partner"" assaulted them. Source   http://m.hrw.org/news/2013/05/03/dubais-child-labor-complicity   A little summary of the article.   The wealth of Dubai’s gold companies contrasts sharply with the poor conditions under which some of the gold is being mined.   First of all Dubai is a hub for transport routes between the east and west side of the world. Secondly companies like De Beers have been using child miners, forcing relocation of lcoal populations and selling blood diamonds since the early 1900's and still continue to do so. But as a private firm Holland as a country is not at fault. i don't blame Holland. I blame De Beers. That's just one example of a PRIVATE company abusing human rights. more info on De Beers  I'm not saying Dubai or the UAE is a perfect place. Far from it. However from what I can see, they are trying to improve their human rights and put in place infrastructure and laws to protect their working population.  Like I recommended before, stop by /r/dubai and ask expats (brits, americans, canadians etc..) their opinion on Dubai and the UAE."

It screams Asian to me for some reason. Especially the A. Maybe it's because I'm used to seeing Russian propaganda using the same Sans Serif/Slab Serif Typefaces. (example 1, example 2)   I know they are trying to be modern with their look and logo, but it's hard too stray away from a style that you're well known for."
worldcup,2ko3qw,Im_A_Racehorse,4,Wed Oct 29 19:03:48 2014 UTC,"I think they intentionally avoided using a typeface that would connect them to much to the communist era. I think the logo is designed to play on the pre-revolution times, i get connotations with some of the architecture in Moscow for example. I wouldn't say i love the typface but i think it's better than a lot of recent Olympics and WC's. I am a bit annoyed by that lower case looking A tho, I think a capital would have looked way better. I like that it's not too russian in colors, and compared to Sochi this is amazing. Although is it only me or does ""FIFA"" feel slightly heavier than the rest?"
worldcup,2ko3qw,lejonhjerta,1 point,Wed Oct 29 20:08:19 2014 UTC,"Well yes I know their reasons to stay away from their past, but I just don't agree with the typeface. I think the A is actually a stylized capitalization, but it looks too similar to a lowercase a I agree. What was wrong with the Sochi logo? I feel that it was way better than this one to be honest. They used a nice Sans Serif typeface that represented the strength it takes to survive the harsh winters in Russia haha. And red does seem connected to Russian colors to me. The blue for Sochi would have been nice.     I believe Fifa has their own restrictions on how big their signature has to be so there can't be much blame on that part of the logo."

I don't know if we're talking about the same identity (this one? http://www.newyorker.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/sochi-logos-1.jpeg). To me it feels like something I'd find on a Counter Strike forum tag 10 years ago. It's way to techy and why the hell is there the .ru in there? Sure it's ""cleverly"" symmetric, but that's just like graphic student gimmicky to me.

Although I still think its a little ""asian"", I like this one a whole lot more. Just goes to show how much a single element can off balance a whole logo.   And yea I was speaking about that Identity.    "".ru"" would be the website, but I agree that it is not needed there. I'm attracted to symmetric elements I confess. And, I just fell in love with how they include something from their own alphabet into the logo. (talking about the ч to represent 4) I love how clever that part is.

I still don't get the whole idea of using a private, Swiss organisation to enforce European and US foreign politics.  Move the Cup to another nation or we will not partake?  If an FA decides for whatever reasons to boycott the cup then fine. Let them, but it's not like the local FAs are political arms of their governments.   Maybe they are heavily funded and supported by them, but that doesn't mean politicians have any say in what they are supposed to do.   If you think about it, if FIFA wants to represent all of international football then Russia's point of view must have the same weight to them as any other member's point of view.  Now, imagine Russia would call for disqualifications of certain teams because they are in political struggles with that FA's country. How ridiculous would that sound?  Imho the whole idea makes ""the west"" look weak, like they have no other means to pressure Russia."

I think the complete lack of footballing heritage in Qatar should also have been taken into consideration when selecting the hosts.  I think any of the other choices- Japan, South Korea, USA or Australia- would have been better. My personal preference would be Australia. Although they haven't exactly set the world on fire with their past performances at the World Cup they have at least qualified for it which is more than can be said about Qatar, plus they were the only other bidder who hasn't already hosted one.  No problems playing matches in June-July either as it's the middle of winter which, for Sydney, means temperatures between 10-17°C; ideal for playing football in."

worldcup,2k12en,etchgtown,5,Thu Oct 23 06:45:15 2014 UTC,"So... There appears to be a tiny bit of contact by Rafa Marquez's right foot on Arjen Robben's left. It's debatable; there may have been zero contact. But there's no doubt that Robben chose to go down, that he flopped dramatically, and that the referee was to some degree fooled.  With the benefit of super-slo-mo replay, I'd have booked him for trying to buy a penalty to decide a game. It's against the spirit of the game.  Full disclosure: I pull against Mexico most of the time and think Rafa Marquez is a cheating bastard. But the old man got victimized here.   Sin falta, penal... y sin justicia, gana los holandeses."

As with rugby, introduce a yellow card for dissent as well as fouls and that should cover all the bases. I'm sure Pierluigi Collina used to dish out yellow cards for dissent when he was refereeing anyway.  Might also stop players picking up tactical yellow cards during a match if it meant their team would be short a player in the later stages."

worldcup,2jkwug,TiredRightNowALot,3,Sat Oct 18 12:49:38 2014 UTC,"I think a 10 minute sin-bin for faking injuries, dives, etc. would be invaluable to the game.  I grew up in the UK and have moved to Canada.  Living here, people don't take the sport seriously and there's a huge part of that (in my opinion) related to dives and faking.  In a country (I'll say even North America) where Hockey, American Football and contact sports in general are very popular, it's tough to see grown men landing on their back over  slight nudge, change in wind direction, uncut piece of grass.  I love football in all aspects, but even I get sick of watching after a certain amount of bullshit dives.  THAT rule change would increase the popularity of the sport, and actually get us to the point where it's a beautiful game, once again."

worldcup,2iwsio,SauceCostanza,0,Sat Oct 11 15:14:06 2014 UTC,"But when Fifa starts campaigns about ""Say no to Racism"" they willfully cross over into the realm of Rights.   Seems odd to simultaneously label oneself Anti-Racist and accept different standards for men and women.   THE ONLY argument that Canada/FIFA have that I can see is that no other country really stepped up to host the World Cup. I think the only way out at this point is to say: Look, Canada has turf and it was our only option. This will be the last World Cup played on turf and promise that even before the players step on the field. That way everyone saves face and FIFA promises future equality considering its virtually impossible for them to provide it now."

worldcup,2iwsio,SauceCostanza,1 point,Sat Oct 11 16:26:19 2014 UTC,"Fair enough. Good point. Honestly, once a competitive player myself, I completely think all WC games should be on grass. If, in fact, the Men's tournament is played on field turf, then we'll have to admit that there's been no discrimination.   Playing of turf is prefereable to a bad grass field - but there are not college practice fields we are talking about. It's the world cup and the host country should be able to supply 12 grass fields for chrissake.   So, i suppose that i REALLY hope that an upcoming men's tournament will be on artificial turf. I think it will hurt the game and I think it will be a terrible idea, but at least it will force the question of equal treatment. one shitty world cup for a future of non-discriminatory ones might be worth it."

Just like the ratio of popularity of men's vs. women's sports, imagine the journalists covering women's sports. Many fans and journalists are men, and that would make the feminist outrage even smaller (harder to find) than the fan base.

worldcup,2h8ht7,youonlylive2wice,8,Tue Sep 23 18:20:47 2014 UTC,Limiting the number of concussion checks per game kind of defeats the purpose of doing it altogether. You run the risk of leaving players on the field with head injuries. I would expand on your original idea by creating a team of designated officials (either on field or watching from monitors) who have sole discretion on which players should be sidelined to check for symptoms of a concussion.
worldcup,2h8ht7,Jpakolypse,1 point,Tue Sep 23 19:08:55 2014 UTC,"How many concussion checks does it look like are needed a game?  Seems to be maybe 1 / team, rare occasions 2... So you'd be at 4 before you ran into that issue and I don't want to see more ""gamesmanship"" bullshit w/ guys taking concussion leave to slow the game down and give their exhausted team a break."
worldcup,2h8ht7,youonlylive2wice,1 point,Tue Sep 23 19:51:58 2014 UTC,I don't like gamesmanship in professional sports either. They can avoid abuse of the system by coaches and players if they put the decision in the hands a medical monitoring official or officials who's sole job is to diagnose head injuries (which is similar to Fifa's new rule).
worldcup,2h8ht7,Jpakolypse,3,Tue Sep 23 21:56:04 2014 UTC,"So the affected team just plays down a man for three minutes? It's not like they intended to receive the concussion, why should we penalize them for it."

worldcup,2h8ht7,SurpriseAnalProlapse,3,Tue Sep 23 15:24:35 2014 UTC,I disagree. They should treat him outside the field while the match continues.  The game only stops if the goalkeeper is injured.
worldcup,2h8ht7,SurpriseAnalProlapse,18,Tue Sep 23 19:55:16 2014 UTC,"The problem is that players don't want to go off the field while the game continues, and wave off medical attention even if hurt."
worldcup,2h8ht7,Moderatecalf,2,Tue Sep 23 19:56:48 2014 UTC,"Well, that's true. But the referee should get him out to get checked if the injury seems serious. And the Doctor+Coach should decide if he continues...  But yeah, players are usually dumb, they only want to keep playing."
worldcup,2h8ht7,Penelope742,2,Tue Sep 23 20:06:01 2014 UTC,"Referee has the power to keep them off the field if he chooses, or at least  at most other levels of play. And part of the new certification process for Referee Certification is an hour or so long video followed by TONS of questions."

worldcup,2gel19,arseaway,7,Mon Sep 15 15:37:08 2014 UTC,"You're trying to play the chicken or the egg game and it simply doesn't work here.  it is not a positive feedback loop.  all the advertising in the world will not bring women's viewership numbers remotely close to men's.  2010 men's finals saw a peak of nearly 1 billion viewers.  that's 1 in 7 people in the world.  2011 women's finals was lower, so low that I can't even find published official numbers.  considering the finals was US vs Japan, those 2 countries should have the highest viewership and their combined viewers are roughly 25~30 million.   they can't even fill the seats at the women's stadiums.  2011 women's cup avg attendance 26,500.  2010 men's cup avg attendance 59,000.  maybe because of different host countries?  let's try comparing years when they were both played in the US.  2003 women's 23,000.  1994 men's 68,600.  so they sell significantly cheaper tickets for the women's games, and still only manage one third to half the attendance.  As the German woman's coach said, ""They usually play in front of 800 people, no one knows who they are. The women's football results aren't even printed in the newspapers.""  They aren't printed in the newspaper due to some gender bias.  They aren't printed because no one cares.  Nobody goes to watch their games.  Nobody writes the newspaper and asks where the women's soccer scores for last night are.    Since you want to be all high and mighty and take the opinion that FIFA should just throw money at women's soccer without regard to how profitable it is, let me ask...Have you ever attended a women's soccer game?  Do you go regularly?  Do you watch them on TV?  Do you support them in any way that would grow the sport and actually matter?  Or are you just a keyboard warrior hard at work defending a position you only agree with as an idea, and not in practice.

My jersey collection is worth more than my car. Should I continue? Don't ad hominem me dude.   If you can't find viewership numbers, it's because you didn't look. A simple Google search produced the number: 13.458 million watched the 2011 on ESPN in the US. Considering 2011 was, by most accounts, the breakout World Cup, that number will surely be topped in the future. The same website also shows that the final was the 6th highest viewed soccer program in US history, which isn't too shabby considering there are so many WoSo haters. Does it bother and/or make you uncomfortable to think that women's sports are popular and will only grow in popularity with more financial backing?   Don't deny that FIFA has a shit-ton of money. They just pledged to double their budget for women's soccer development projects.  They also bring in enough sponsor revenue to unethically gift each countries head a $25,000 watch.

They are trying to promote football in their country and they have a star power in Sinclaire to do it now. Canada has been trying to get a women's world cup since 2007.   There is no motivation to under advertise/promote.   Of course, I'm sure Canada's 75 million dollars is on the line.

To assume that it is going to wreck football seems a bit premature, especially since very little experimentation has actually been done.

In practice, most challenges would be resolved quite easily.  However, I think it's a legitimate concern that video reviews could be used as a back-door way of introducing interruptions and down-time to the game to make room for television commercials.  Once you let that happen, it will never be undone.  It'll just get worse and worse, no matter how much people hate it.  Therefore, it seems vital to have good rules in place from the very beginning to prevent video reviews from changing the nature and feel of the game."

worldcup,2fxefe,niveusluxlucis,-2,Wed Sep 10 01:35:48 2014 UTC,"An entire conference is in the Southern Hemisphere, along with parts of other conferences as well. If you want to keep calling it the 'World Cup', you can't use the argument that some parts of the world will be inconvenienced when watching it because that's unavoidable."
worldcup,2fxefe,Team_Pup_N_Suds,8,Wed Sep 10 02:05:01 2014 UTC,"The term 'world' isn't strictly geographical. 90% of the world's population live in the Northern Hemisphere. It makes no sense to inconvenience 90% of people for the sake of the uninhabited land and ocean below the equator.   Hell, the previous two world cups were both hosted by countries south of the equator and they still held the tournament in the Northern Hemisphere's summer."
worldcup,2fxefe,niveusluxlucis,-2,Wed Sep 10 02:49:37 2014 UTC,"I'm not arguing that it shouldn't be held in June/July, I'm arguing that the reason of 'viewers might be inconvenienced' is a terrible justification for not moving it.  If your argument is that the world cup should be held at a time that's maximally convenient for everybody watching, then would you be opposed to applying this same criteria to longitude as well as latitude? I think around 40% of the worlds population lives in UTC6-8, so basing the selection of the host country or the kickoff times for games around that would be efficient."
worldcup,2fxefe,Team_Pup_N_Suds,2,Wed Sep 10 03:20:20 2014 UTC,"viewers might be inconvenienced' is a terrible justification for not moving it.   It's actually great justification. This whole tournament is about maximizing profits first and cultivating a global sense of sport and fairness second. Alienating/inconveniencing 90% of your audience (less than that realistically, but a large majority) is a great way to reduce viewership and revenue for various economic factors discussed in detail elsewhere.   around 40% of the worlds population lives in UTC6-8, , so basing the selection of the host country or the kickoff times for games around that would be efficient.   Again, while that may be where the population is, that's not where the money is. The GDP of China+India is around 10 trillion USD. Plus those nations aren't normally even participating. Whereas the GDP of the EU is 17.4 trillion USD. So UTC+0-1, north of the equator is exactly where the sweet spot of spending power, population and World Cup interest lies. So that's the population FIFA should and does primarily cater to when considering these factors for the World Cup."
worldcup,2fxefe,niveusluxlucis,-1,Wed Sep 10 03:48:56 2014 UTC,"Well fuck it then, let's just move the world cup permanently to Europe to maximise profits every year.

You even call the ethnic Russians that live in Ukraine ""Russian citizens"". You also only mention Crimea, Russia has moved far past Crimea now. I know if I was from Russia I would believe the things you are saying too, but not because they are true, because I would only have access to information through channels approved by the government and in compliance with their narrative.  You can say it's all ""US"" lies but all of Europe has condemned their actions and even China isn't supporting them. Whether you want to believe it or not Russia has destabilized Europe and threatened a massive war.   Russia is not the benevolent defender they pretend to be. Russia tried as hard as they could to keep the people from having a revolution. Blaming the Ukrainian revolution on the EU and US is also bullshit and ignorant. It doesn't take a political expert to see why Ukraine would want to shift it's associations to the much more prospering EU. Furthermore when they had their revolution, Russia starts with aggression. The people plan a vote, Russia invades. This is not how a benevolent ally functions. Russia's only interest was taking Crimea so they could have the warm water port there. They had no interest in protecting or helping the ethnic Russia's there.   Also comparing Russia's actions in Ukraine to US in Iraq and Afghanistan is silly and again marks the propaganda of Putin. Not only was it far less deadly, but the US hasn't used it's military to annex land in the modern era.   And that's not mentioning the various fuck ups Putin has had so far in Ukraine trying to control the rebels he supports including the downing of that Dutch flight which you probably believe when Putin says that too is a western conspiracy. The man will lie about anything. He is lying about the presence of his own troops, even to the point of saying they ""got lost"" or are volunteers when reporting their deaths to their families.   The World Cup is supposed to be about international unity. Russia has actively and aggressively withdrawn from the international community with Putin becoming somewhat of a pariah. In his desperate grab for Ukraine he is scaring other Baltic states into joining NATO, what's next for them? More ""liberation"". No country in the modern era should act this way, it is only a matter of time before the facade of propaganda out before you and Russian citizens starts to crack. The Russian economy will be crippled in the process, and all of this for one port?   Which brings me to the next issue with a Russian World Cup, how do they plan on funding it? They completely botched the Winter Olympics. Sure FIFA will help fund them but they still need working infrastructure, security, transport and medical facilities. Will they be able to provide these things? It makes hardly any sense to have a World Cup in Russia in 2018 or in Qatar after that. Something is seriously wrong with the selection committee but that is honestly not a huge surprise considering the rest if the organization."

Anyone anywhere can be taken without trial and brutalized.  Wars based on lies. Gulf of Tonkin/WMDs. NSA infringing on everyone's privacy. Global economic collapse started in the US and the banksters are still running wild.  Supporting and propping up brutal regimes all across the planet. Overthrowing legitimately elected leaders. Killing others.   Now in no way do i think sport and politics should mix at the global level, but if I did support a boycott of Russia, then SUrely the US must be banned from entering all tournaments, let alone hosting them, for the foreseeable.   It's ridiculous how righteous americans get while ignoring their own fuckedup ness entirely."

They are talking about a NFL style system where the ref goes to a monitor, which I think is horrible. It really takes time away from the game.  A better system is to have a 5th official sitting in the media studio the whole game, and communicating with the ref at all times. They would have the same feeds as us, but could actually tell the ref about blown calls after the fact, as well as modify calls in progress with the aid of replay.  As long as it's a mobile wireless system like the goal line stuff, i'm fine with it, but the idea of going to a sideline monitor offends me."

They have more in common culturally with the Caribbean countries than the rest of South America anyway.

Then make sure the stores rating is near perfect.  At the worst you wasted ~$20 on a gamble. Good luck."

It's just a big symbolic move that simply emboldens the targets and hurts the boycotting countries.  The 1980 Olympic boycott accomplished nothing, the 1984 revenge Olympic boycott accomplished nothing, and the boycott of South African sports teams accomplished nothing.  The biggest effect they do is that they make the citizens of the targeted countries angry at the rest of the world and cause them to support their country's government more.  Best thing Europeans can do to hit Russia is to make sure that the team sucks at the 2018 World Cup, like get 3 losses and score no goals.  That is something that will cause Russians to clamor for change in the government.  Clubs should pass on buying Russian players, or they should buy Russian players and keep them on the bench.  Their Euro 2016 qualifying opponents should just refuse to play in Russia because of ""security concerns"" and make UEFA move their home matches.  The English FA should bribe Russian clubs to hire their shitty also-ran managers to run Russian Premier League clubs and kill all local player development."

Brazil (too hunid) Qatar (desert) and then Russia (taiga summers suck! Humid and hot). They need to stop making it about economics and giving it to cities that could use the notoriety and more about current infastructure, climate, and logistics.   I am very very very disappointed with FIFA's next two host cities as well as the previous tournement in Brazil. Having people play in a Jungle (not just any jungle the jungle the Amazon) isn't right. And to see them move on in this manner is frightening. I know I may sound bias towards these places where climate is an issue, but tough luck.. these players and fans and coaches should be rewarded for their hard work and support by being able to compete in a comfortable climate."

We can assume the the event can't be ""banned"" by the EU & US, but sanctions could for example block sponsorship, & tv rights. With EU & US businesses blocked from taking part the event would likely make a huge financial loss.  Regarding mentioning that FIFA is ""Swiss organization"", well neutral Switzerland must balance things between the two groups. Switzerland is currently introducing rules that in part suggest they working with US & EU sanctions  http://online.wsj.com/articles/switzerland-extends-sanctions-on-five-unnamed-russian-banks-1409151869  Finally, FIFA are not 'legally' the owners of Association Football. Their self styled status of 'World Governing Body', comes about because they control the biggest tournament and no nation wants to be left out of this tournament. Currently several nations have lost faith in FIFA due to the arrogant & blatant corruption within FIFA.

Selection committees take bribes and base their final decision largely on that. When the process is corrupt, of course corrupt countries are going to get their hands on games and events.  Furthermore, understand that host locations take 10-15 years to prepare for games. If we start pulling hosting rights mid-process, it's never going to work, because replacement hosts will never have enough time to prepare adequately. Quite frankly it would be disastrous. You can't just switch hosts willy-nilly."

worldcup,2etrr6,Figoal,42,Thu Aug 28 14:52:25 2014 UTC,"I actually disagree. I agree that Europe is more competitive, but the world cup is the WORLD cup. The diversity is nice, and realistically most teams that should make it to the elimination rounds do so. Having a balance from around the world is what makes the world cup such an international phenomena. Besides what are the Euros for if you want to squeeze in every team from Europe."
worldcup,2etrr6,Asrap,23,Thu Aug 28 20:13:16 2014 UTC,"I understand this point, but I feel that it is currently way too hard for European teams to qualify for the WC. Teams like Honduras, Iran or Australia would never, ever qualify if they were from Europe. Don't get me wrong, I love that teams like that can and do qualify, but it's unfair to the number of European teams of an equal or higher skill level that they will have that much harder a time qualifying.   Here are the European teams rated #32 or better on the current FIFA ranking (not a good ranking system, I know, but for illustrative purposes) that did not qualify for this WC:   Sweden Denmark Turkey Serbia Ukraine Romania Scotland   Here are teams from all other federations rated #32 or better that didn't make it:   Venezuela   (CONMEBOL, which is obviously the second hardest to qualify from)  Edit: clearly I was wrong about Ecuador, not sure what i was looking at/thinking.   In the final round of AFC qualifications there were 10 teams divided into two groups which each had two direct qualification spots and one play-off spot. The ten teams are ranked as follows:   44 Japan 48 Iran 51 Uzbekistan 56 Jordan 57 Korea  67 Oman 79 Australia 91 Iraq 92 Qatar 115 Lebanon   These 10 teams had four direct qualification spots and two playoff spots. These are two groups of 6 teams from the UEFA qualification which each had one direct qualification spot and one playoff spot:  Group B:   3 Belgium 27 Romania 32 Turkey 34 Hungary 40 Estonia 52 Andorra   Group D:   14 Italy 26 Denmark 35 Czech Republic 36 Armenia 49 Malta 72 Bulgaria   Almost every team in those group is ranked higher than almost every team in the two AFC groups. I realize it's difficult because Europe has so many nations with a higher level, but this is not exactly well-balanced in my opinion.   I certainly don't want an all-European tournament, but I feel this should be mitigated slightly. You never get to see underdog teams from Europe because of the way the qualifiers are structured. And no Sweden in particular in this WC was ridiculous.   EDIT: Formatting should be OK now goddamn lists sorry this was a mess."
worldcup,2etrr6,knoberation,5,Thu Aug 28 23:43:29 2014 UTC,I see your point but as an Ecuadorian I can assure you that we did indeed make it into Brazil 2014
worldcup,2etrr6,davu06,2,Fri Aug 29 03:47:20 2014 UTC,"Ecuador are not in UEFA. They did play in the WC qualifying from CONMEBOL.   I agree with the rest.  It's a very tricky balancing act because we want to see the best teams compete while simultaneously maintaining the ""World"" aspect to the competition.

worldcup,2etrr6,Wicksy92,0,Fri Aug 29 07:53:58 2014 UTC,"But it would be a more evenly and fairly represented tournament, involving and even number of teams from every confederation. I absolutely disagree with the bias towards Europe when it comes to the World Cup.  FYI, it's the World Cup, emphasis on the WORLD part. A tournament with half its participants being from one confederation is not a Global tournament at all."
worldcup,2etrr6,annoyinglyfriendly,1 point,Fri Aug 29 15:39:51 2014 UTC,"While that may be, it's the case in almost any sport. The majority of the Big 4 leagues in America are 'world' championships, and every continental club competition is a 'champions league' despite multiple teams from many states taking part.   There are so many reasons to explain why Europe has this many teams. The history of the competition, while flimsy, cannot be understated. Ever since the World Cup begun the most represented continent has been Europe. Football as it is today was a European invention, and almost every single historical powerhouse in international club football is European, with the exception of Brazil, Argentina and some of their clubs  An evenly spread  World Cup would be awful. Say you have 5 from each confederation with 2 spare in Europe and South America. A match between holland and Spain in the group stage of the World Cup is a much better prospect than that of japan-Fiji in a figuartive case.   Having a bunch of pacific islands or poor North American and Asian peripheral nations such as tonga, Samoa, Jamaica and Uzbekistan just to lost 8-0 every game is a waste, it'd be too expensive for many of those teams. It's nothing more than a pipe dream  The best teams absent from every World Cup are European or South American. The 10 best teams that don't qualify for a World Cup would almost always do so in another confederation"
worldcup,2etrr6,Wicksy92,3,Fri Aug 29 15:52:47 2014 UTC,"I agree that some of these nations don't belong, but you also have to concede that there may be some nations from another confederation that deserve to be in the World Cup, and their confederation should get the additional spot, not UEFA.   We have to remember, that if UEFA were to get an additional 14th qualifying spot, another nation would get the short end of the stick and have a qualifying spot taken away. And who should that be?  I think CONCACAF or CONMEBOL deserve a UEFA spot, more than UEFA deserves another stripped from another confederation."
worldcup,2etrr6,annoyinglyfriendly,2,Fri Aug 29 16:33:45 2014 UTC,"Asia probably will lose a spot, their performances at the world cups since 2002 have not been good.   If you look at almost any World Cup, the best teams not in it are European or South American mostly, and most of the teams outside of those two continents would not qualify via UEFA or CONMEBOL  I guess one way to solve this would just add 4 teams to the World Cup. 1 more spot for UEFA,  CONEMEBOL and CONCACAF and possibly one for OFC, doubt many would complain!"
worldcup,2etrr6,Wicksy92,0,Fri Aug 29 16:47:39 2014 UTC,"That actually sounds good. If we were going to leave it 32 team format, I would give a UEFA spot to CONMEBOL to make the 2 confederations a little more fair and competitive for the tournament. If we were to add 4 more teams, I would give a spot to UEFA, CONMEBOL, CONCACAF, and CAF."

worldcup,2etrr6,Wicksy92,3,Fri Aug 29 17:00:21 2014 UTC,"In Brazil, CONCACAF boosted its claim by getting three of its four teams — Costa Rica, the United States and Mexico — to the knockout round. Asia's four teams all failed to win a match.   Maybe they should go down to 3 spots until one of them does something. 2002 was the last time a team from Asia made some real noise"

Canada and Zimbabwe were the only two nations to make a bid, and Zimbabwe pulled out. I can't imagine Canada actually putting in natural turf, I don't think women's FIFA brings in enough revenue to make it a profitable investment."

worldcup,2eqz3w,Frumbleabumb,2,Wed Aug 27 19:53:27 2014 UTC,Mostly because the existing MLS stadiums use turf.
worldcup,2eqz3w,mero8181,3,Thu Aug 28 03:32:33 2014 UTC,"Climate had a big thing to do with it considering how long they are covered with snow and short growing seasons. It just makes sense to have turf. If the women don't like it, I would love to see Canada just okay, go find another host. They are the only ones to step up, I don't thing the players realize, its either have the World Cup or don't."
worldcup,2eqz3w,loconet,11,Wed Aug 27 19:48:49 2014 UTC,"It just makes sense to have turf.   Weather alone isn't the cause. A lot of the stadiums in countries like Sweden, Norway, Russia, etc use grass. In the case of Canada, it makes sense but only when taking into context the lack of footballing culture in Canada. There simply is not enough interest in the sport outside Toronto, Montreal, Vancouver to justify the cost of having grass stadiums in all major cities.   Having said this, (as a Canadian) my personal opinion on having a world cup (women or not) all on turf is that it's a joke and insulting to the players."
worldcup,2eqz3w,DreadRabbit,6,Thu Aug 28 01:42:15 2014 UTC,"I appreciate your perspective on the factors at play (that there's more than just a poor weather at play).

They should be respected as world class athletes."
worldcup,2eqz3w,mero8181,0,Thu Aug 28 16:06:31 2014 UTC,"Weather has a lot to do with it. Here in Maine a lot of places are putting in turf. It just make sense. I am sorry the players don't like it, the alternative was to not have the women world cup. I would love to see Canada say, fuck it go find some where else to play."
worldcup,2eqz3w,loconet,2,Thu Aug 28 12:16:20 2014 UTC,"Weather has a lot to do with it.   I know it has a lot to do with it but it isn't the only reason. Along with it being cheaper to maintain after the crappy winters, Turf is simply more flexible in that it can be used for other events without fear of damaging the surface (concerts, rugby, american football, etc,etc). This allows stadiums to generate additional revenue that soccer alone cannot generate in Canada. If soccer were as popular of a sport all over Canada as it is in the places I've mentioned or even as it is in Toronto, weather wouldn't be made a big of an issue. The soccer use itself would pay for the necessary maintenance even after the intense winters."
worldcup,2eqz3w,mero8181,1 point,Thu Aug 28 12:51:05 2014 UTC,"I don't know if its the same where you live but, in Maine we have terrible mud after winter. They jokely call it the firth season, mud season. If there is anything like last winter, were it was so bad until June, you can spend a lot of money getting fields ready. You are right, soccer is biggest enough to justify the extra cost. I know the players are pissed, but in the end its all they have. They have every right to choose not to play if they don't like it. Canada was the only country to step up and say we will host the games. I am sure Zimbabwe might be persuaded to resubmit there bid."
worldcup,2eqz3w,Commandant1,1 point,Thu Aug 28 12:55:58 2014 UTC,"Its really more about the need for these stadiums to be all purpose.  American Football (or Canadian Football, the 3 down version).... rips the crap out of grass, and makes it need constant, expensive maintenance.    The turf doesn't.  So to be able to have a stadium serve dual purposes, you have to have the turf.  Toronto FC fans are currently fighting the Argos moving into BMO Field because the Canadian Football team will chew the crap out of the grass and make it unplayable."
worldcup,2eqz3w,CureLime,10,Tue Sep 2 20:26:36 2014 UTC,"What did Canada do to deserve this?  Of course, this is really less about Canada and all about FIFA. After all isn't the federation a ""non-for-profit"" organization with a nice few hundred millions or a few billions ""reserves"" in the bank from Brazil 2014? FIFA should have more than enough to help Canada and the event organizers but instead FIFA hides behind them, getting them into trouble by doing nothing and making Passive Aggressive statements that does nothing but digging them further into a PR disaster.  The more I read the news, the more I feel sorry for the Canadian Soccer Association and Canada. Canada is sadly the unwillingly body shield for FIFA.

I don't know because I couldn't care less to read the article but I gather it is too expensive to have grass fields and make a worthwhile profit for the sponsors.

worldcup,2epi34,Figoal,14,Wed Aug 27 08:08:09 2014 UTC,It's strange to me that so much of the heat is going to Canada for not putting in real grass. It seems to me FIFA has the greater culpability here for not putting together a woman's tournament in a more thoughtful way. Hosts (whether you're talking American football or Olympics) never reap the full rewards of their investment. FIFA's coffers are certainly deep enough to help the host and rethink how they manage this event.

worldcup,2eagvk,DubaiCM,1 point,Sat Aug 23 05:49:20 2014 UTC,"This analysis is flawed. What they have failed to take into account is that games can be played at night time when air temperatures are around 30C. Not ideal, of course, but nowhere near as dangerous as 45C and similar conditions to many of the games during Brazil 2014. I am surprised the author didn't consider this.  Not only that but the engineers can simply throw several MWs of cooling power into the stadium itself, which will take off another few degrees and will reduce humidity substantially. Again, not ideal as it is not particularly sustainable, but still achievable as long as you have the power - and fossil fuels are not something Qatar is short of.  Qatar (and other countries in the region with similar environmental conditions) have already held football games during the summer, so the technology is proven. It strikes me that the authors of this article have either wilfully ignored information or have an agenda."
worldcup,2eagvk,DubaiCM,2,Fri Aug 22 22:40:42 2014 UTC,"These arguments are so very flawed I really don't know where to begin:   Playing at night is a stupid idea. The human body and mind start to relax when it gets darker. You can't keep that up for weeks on end. Do you expect football players to live like vampires during the course of the championship?  When do they have to train? Also at night? Or during the day? Where are these cooled down training facilities for 32 teams? Have they build 32 stadiums?   This is not something engineers can solve. It is a stupid idea to perform sports within these temperatures. And only because Qatar can throw in a lot of money (and kill hundreds of workers in the meantime, but that's another story) this is still debated."
worldcup,2eagvk,ARGANY1,1 point,Sat Aug 23 08:42:23 2014 UTC,"Playing at night is a stupid idea. The human body and mind start to relax when it gets darker. You can't keep that up for weeks on end. Do you expect football players to live like vampires during the course of the championship?    Lots of matches are already played at night. These are professional sportsmen, they are more than capable of shifting their body clocks as required.   When do they have to train? Also at night? Or during the day? Where are these cooled down training facilities for 32 teams?    They can train whenever they want and they can use indoor facilities for that, which are trivial to cool. The FIFA requirement for outdoor stadiums is for the matches only.   This is not something engineers can solve.   Cooled stadiums already exist and operate around the world. It has already been solved.   It is a stupid idea to perform sports within these temperatures.    It would be, but there is no need because we have air conditioning.   (and kill hundreds of workers in the meantime, but that's another story)    It is indeed, and currently there is zero evidence that the fatality rate for workers on site is any higher than the global average. The often-reported prediction of 4,000 workers dying by 2022 is for all deaths, including natural causes. With 1.4 million workers, 4,000 deaths in 10 years is remarkably low and suggests they are safer working in Qatar than they would be if they stayed in their home countries.  In the interests of balance, note that the organisers claim that not one single worker has died so far on the construction of the world cup stadiums. It sounds incredible but most of the construction work hasn't even started yet so perhaps it is not such a ludicrous claim.  There are definitely other issues with Qatar as hosts, such as the bribery allegations, having no minimum wage, and no national health care, for example."

And that this would be the first ever this has been done.   I can also see from your other answers that you either do not know what soccer actually is, or that you are trying to make a point which is bad understood. Soccer players need a soccer field to train. They can't use ""random"" (not specified) indoor facilities without a soccer field. They have very specific needs. Just like icehockey.  But then again: I would love to see my points proven wrong. Is there a specific program that is looking into these issues? Are there procedures setup that specifically deal with playing sports within extreme conditions? How does the organizing committee handle the training facilities? Etc.. etc...  Maybe you can shed a light and be specific instead of very general?"

And that this would be the first ever this has been done.    It's not relevant whether an entire tournament has been played at night or not. Matches around the world are frequently held at night. It's not an issue.   Soccer players need a soccer field to train. They can't use ""random"" (not specified) indoor facilities without a soccer field. They have very specific needs. Just like icehockey.   Of course they need a full-sized pitch. My point is, they can use an indoor/covered one for training (e.g. with a retractable roof). This can be chilled as cool as you like, regardless of the time of day.   An outdoor/uncovered pitch is only required for the actual matches (to comply with FIFA rules). This is when it gets trickier to cool, hence why these should be at night when outside air temperatures are cooler to reduce the cooling load.   But then again: I would love to see my points proven wrong. Is there a specific program that is looking into these issues? Are there procedures setup that specifically deal with playing sports within extreme conditions?   I don't know if there are, but that is not relevant for this specific case.

worldcup,2eagvk,pooroldedgar,2,Mon Aug 25 11:28:27 2014 UTC,"I think that is highly relevant: following the schedule of Brasil 2014, matches are played on after another. The schedule in Brasil was: first one starts at 13:00, next at 15:00, folowing 17:00 and finally 19:00. As you see, most matches started either in the afternoon or very early in the evening. In the quarter finales matches started at 17:00 and 19:00. Using this schedule for Qatar, first match would start at 19:00? And then 21:00, 23:00, 01:00? Even though at 21:00 it is still between 29-35 degrees, the temperature does not drop to 25 degrees in summer.  We will see if this tournament will be a succes. It is a green field, it has never been done before. Professional soccer players around the world are already protesting. So there has to be a lot more bribing going on before this tournament starts."
worldcup,2eagvk,xizore,1 point,Mon Aug 25 13:48:33 2014 UTC,"Using this schedule for Qatar, first match would start at 19:00?   The first match could be at 11pm, then 1am, then 3am. That works out nicely for European and African primetime TV - a viewing audience of over a billion.   Even though at 21:00 it is still between 29-35 degrees, the temperature does not drop to 25 degrees in summer.   The 25 degrees is taking into account the additional few degrees drop given by the stadium air-conditioning systems.   We will see if this tournament will be a succes.    Indeed. It may well be taken away from them for other reasons, such as the corruption allegations, so this discussion would become academic."

The champions of Europe and the world toppled by a team full of heart and spirit... Sampaolo's 3-4-3 was too much for Spain and it was great seeing them collapse... That being said.. My runner up will be Holland Spain.. Suffice to say I hate Spain.

I recall someone saying that Chile is not afraid of Brazil, knows their playstyle and will play them anywhere. Chile had Brazil on their heels most of the match and were a machine.

worldcup,2e6hca,I_am_a_Pixel,7,Thu Aug 21 15:24:03 2014 UTC,He might not be anymore but he seemed to have alot to do in the 2010 mess and was definitely some sort of negative presence at that time + i don't know if it's because people put too much pressure on him or what not but he never performed in the edf as well as he did in bayern or at least not with the same consistency. I think it's a great choice that he keeps focused on the bayern where he feels more appreciated etc   He is not very liked in france so I doubt many people will see this as a loss

All I said was that when men and females play together, the men will come out on top because they're just physically stronger. This is a 100% true fact, not bias, not sexism, not anything but a truth. How is it sexist for me to state a fact? So is it not an issue of sexism, but rather you just don't want anyone saying anything negative about females at all?"

I know quite a few women who played in the mens club leagues in my state. Most of the serious female rep players played club in mens teams/leagues in the time before women got their own more competative national women's league up above the club leagues here.  In my own club when I started playing (15+ years ago admittedly) our senior mens team had a female sweeper, and they were a state premier league team (and she was a state player and national womens team reserve). She was definitely able to cut it with the men, and generally refused to play in the womens leagues because she thought it would be unfair. We had a few others at state level who tended to play mens div 2-div 3. It's less common now since they'd all be playing in the national womens league that didn't exist then instead, but it did happen back in the day.   If you're talking about the absolute top of the game sure (but how many people of either gender can cut it there?), but lower down women can definitely hold their own against men who are physically bigger and stronger. Obviously the women who can do it are better than average and not incredibly common, but they do exist. Skill can go a fair way when compared to brute strength with a lack of skill - don't underrate it, it's not a totally foregone conclusion that strength will always win."

Looks like, and I don't know if there are proper terms for these moves so forgive me if there are--that move messi does a lot where he waits for an opponent to lunge for the ball then quickly shifts the ball from one foot to the other and then forward all in one swift, shifting motion. I've also seen ribery do it and I'm sure others as well that I can't think of. And also instead of just pushing the ball forward as it meets her left foot, she lifts the ball up slightly so as to evade any sweeping feet/hands, which I also see players do occasionally. Pretty simple yet effective."

For a rainbow, she would have been trying to step ahead of the ball with her right foot, and her left foot would have been going towards her heel.  What she actually did looks nothing like a rainbow until her right foot kicks back, and if you pause the video, you can see that the goalkeeper's arm hooks her foot, and she has to pull it up and over to avoid getting tripped."

Yes you will get turf burn if you slide that will heal in a couple days and cause no problems. I could post a picture of my arms right now.  It's not a big deal.   You don't seem to understand that it is patently impossible to get grass into these venues in an appropriate manner.    You're attacking Canada for offering to host with what we have.  I cannot stress this enough, we aren't trying to force turf on the world, we're not even defending turf.  Everyone knows grass is better.

It's about the (senior) Women's World Cup happening in 2015, the women's top-level competition in the world. Of course, to be fair, Canada is the best country to host this out of the (one) country that offered. We can't malign Canada and say they're evil: they're doing what every other country in the world refused to do and doing the best they can.  But it's a pretty far stretch to do as this article is suggesting and say that everything's all rainbows and sunshine and there are no problems at all with Canada hosting the Women's World Cup. The article didn't even mention the stadiums or playing surfaces.  Canada's a fine country (I wouldn't have stayed here my whole life if it weren't), but it's not capable of hosting a top-tier world soccer tournament at this point in time.

worldcup,2djr1b,krusader42,2,Fri Aug 15 15:46:33 2014 UTC,"the playing surfaces on offer are substandard   What standard do they fail?  FIFA rates synthetic fields, and those that get a 2-star rating are approved for hosting matches at the men's or women's World Cup.  Fields (synthetic and natural) of lower quality than the ones being used in Canada are used all over the world for important matches like World Cup qualifiers and Champions League games. Even the biggest event of all isn't immune to poor pitches, just look at Manaus.   the women for next summer have made clear   Until they win their suit, which hasn't actually been filed and likely won't ever, they won't have proven anything."
worldcup,2djr1b,etchgtown,-3,Thu Aug 14 23:05:07 2014 UTC,"They fail the standard for top-level competition. The men's World Cup Finals have never been played on an artificial surface, not even indoors in Pontiac in 1994, and they'd never allow it for the men. It is clearly substandard by objective measures, and is only permitted in places for significant where it can't be avoided."

Furthermore, there have only been three tournaments since the first two-star installation in 2005. Your argument boils down to ""it's never been done, so we should never do it.""   It is clearly substandard by objective measures   Such as?   and is only permitted in places for significant where it can't be avoided   Permitted by who?"
worldcup,2djr1b,etchgtown,0,Fri Aug 15 01:42:55 2014 UTC,"Objective measures such as [http://www.tmz.com/2014/08/14/kobe-bryant-kevin-durant-sydney-leroux-injuries-world-cup-fifa-artificial-turf/](the frequency of this shit) that happens so much more easily on fieldturf than on grass. Athletes of any sport who have experience with both will tell you that, from professional soccer players to high school football players. Henry and Beckham sit out some games on turf because of its effect on their joints. It is detrimental to athletes.   Permitted by who?   Permitted by FIFA and the member nations. Premier League rule I.29 states ""no league match shall be played on an artificial surface""; other major nations have similar bans. Grass is preferred by the masses anywhere where it can grow for most of the year.  Turf changes the game -- I have yet to see an artificial turf that didn't alter the way the ball moves upon contact with the ground.   The argument isn't ""it's never been done, so we should never do it."" It's ""it's never been done, and for a good reason."" The technology to adequately replicate the properties of grass is not there yet."
worldcup,2djr1b,krusader42,2,Fri Aug 15 03:41:40 2014 UTC,"One player getting scraped up and two celebrities tweeting about it is not an objective measure. FIFA measures the abrasiveness of the turf when evaluating the surface; fields likely to injure players would not receive two-star ratings.   Henry and Beckham sit out some games on turf because of its effect on their joints. It is detrimental to athletes.   They do/did regularly play on the more pristine fields of MLS, notably in Portland.   Several scientific studies into artificial turf have indicated that its overall injury rate is comparable to or better than natural grass, and while they are more prone to (relatively minor) skin injury, that corresponds to a reduction in (major) muscle and ligament injuries.   Permitted by FIFA and the member nations.    FIFA allows artificial fields at all levels without geographic/climatic restriction (assuming they meet the rating criteria for higher-level matches). As prominent as the Premier League is, it is only one league, and one of the few with an explicit ban on artificial surfaces. And that rule exists because of the really poor astroturf style ""plastic pitches"" of the 80s and 90s, it's not a response to modern infill style fields.   Turf changes the game -- I have yet to see an artificial turf that didn't alter the way the ball moves upon contact with the ground.   Rain changes the game -- I have yet to see a wet pitch that didn't alter the way the ball moves upon contact with the ground. The reality is that good turf - in any climatic condition - is closer to good grass than many conditions of natural fields frequently seen at the highest levels of the game."
worldcup,2djr1b,FGC1994,2,Fri Aug 15 04:29:13 2014 UTC,"This isn't about one player getting scraped up; this is about the frequency with which it happens to all players. That photo is simply the easiest example to find. If it wasn't a problem, the star players for next summer's event wouldn't be bothering with this effort to avoid them.   Rain changes the game -- I have yet to see a wet pitch that didn't alter the way the ball moves upon contact with the ground.   The difference is rain is temporary, has always been part of the game, and cannot be avoided by choice a year ahead of time.   I do think the technology will get there, but neither I nor the apparent majority of players concerned believe it has yet. Maybe I'm wrong in that, but I'm hoping we don't have to find out the hard way next summer."
worldcup,2djr1b,mikeyo73,0,Fri Aug 15 04:49:47 2014 UTC,"Roughly 40 players is by no means the majority. They're just a very vocal minority.  And my point about the rain is that the characteristics of artificial fields, particularly those with two-star status, fall within the wide margins of natural grass fields. Some aspects might be more similar to a parched field than a waterlogged one, but there is some way to replicate each characteristic with a grass surface.  It will not take the players long to adapt to them, and once they do, the nearly identical nature of the field at each venue will give them a remarkably consistent experience. There were no issues in 2007 when players like Aguero, Marcelo and Chicharito used them at the U20 World Cup; there hasn't been any complaints at this year's women's edition either."

Beyond that, there are some very very objective points that I'm not sure why you guys are shitting on.

We hosted the Olympics 4 years ago, and it went very well.     most people seem to be complaining about the pitch  This isn't fair.  We didn't purport to have all grass fields.  Fifa knew exactly what they were getting into, the fields aren't Canada's fault.    Should we host a men's WC, we would obviously get grass fields.  to suggest otherwise is just silly.

Why? Because the ""soccer"" culture is growing, but still isn't up there. People can show up at the stadiums and cheer, but it won't be the same thing as if it were hosted in a more ""traditional"" football country. The ignorance I see towards ""soccer"" in Canada and the US, although decreasing, is still incredible. People have no clue what they talk about and the football culture isn't embedded yet.  The sport's popularity is growing, but you can see from pundits, fans, players, the knowledge or passion for the sport isn't that great. And that doesn't make a good WC. It's a sport that is basically ""Hey! Let's take the kids to watch a game because it's a fun family activity!"" rather than ""I love the sport and I watch it seriously."" It needs to become a ""big"" (Hockey-big) sport in the country in order for it to do well.  That's my opinion."

Or what about the hosting of US in 1994 when it was not as popular but became wildly successful.   I think Canadian crowds will absolutely come out for a WC, I'm just more concerned about the soccer ready stadiums available, I count four now (Vancouver, Edmonton, Montreal, Toronto) but we will need to build more in different places (and where?)."

The referee, however, can only reverse his first decision so long as the game has not been restarted.    http://www.quora.com/Football-Soccer-2/Has-arguing-with-the-referee-ever-been-successful-for-a-player   While it is extremely rare for a referee to reverse a decision after it has been made, the 1982 World Cup in Spain saw this happen in quite comical fashion in a match between Kuwait and France. With France leading 3-1, French midfielder Alain Giresse appeared to score a perfectly legitimate goal, which the Soviet referee quickly awarded.  However, things immediately went awry. Before the match restarted, the Kuwaiti players began remonstrating with the referee that, right before the goal was scored, they had heard a whistle from the crowd, which they claim they mistook for the referee's whistle, and thus assumed play was stopped. Even more comically, a prominent member of the Kuwaiti royal family who was attending the match also took to the pitch, making clear to the referee his displeasure with the goal being awarded. Strangely, these protests worked: the referee reversed course and decided to cancel the goal.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGtEbY9iE3I  The sharp whistle from the crowd can be heard at around 0:08  While the French were furious, they didn't dwell on the incident for too long, and quickly scored another goal to make it 4-1. Things ended less auspiciously for the Soviet referee, who was later stripped off of his international refereeing credentials."

worldcup,2dmaex,hokeyphenokey,2,Fri Aug 15 20:57:48 2014 UTC,"Talking to the refs changes how they call the game.  I play recreational soccer indoors, and the refs let us do a lot of pushing and shoving away from the ball, but if the other team complains, they start calling it really tight.  It's annoying; you have to be prepared to play two completely different games away from the ball.  Same goes for shielding the ball with your body.  For example, if an offensive player makes a too-strong touch while trying to get around me and sends the ball rolling towards my goalkeeper, I'll run after it, nominally putting myself in a position to play the ball but really only making sure that the offensive player would have to shove through me to recover the ball before the keep picks it up.  The refs always allow stuff like that, but one time the other team got mouthy about it, and the ref started giving penalty kicks for it.  Just like that.    Speaking as someone who tries not to have an opinion what the ""correct"" calls are and defers completely to the refs about what is kosher or not, it pisses me off a little bit that the refs change so much in response to whining, but like it or not, it's part of the game, just like diving."

The Swedish team for this World Cup, the Inas 2014 World Football Championships, had qualified but didn't have the funds to send the team to Brazil for the tournament.   The team's staff reached out to many Swedish professional football players to ask them to donate one of their football jerseys to auction off to help raise money for the trip.   When they contacted Zlatan Ibrahimpvicr to donate his shirt for the auction, Ibrahimovic responded, “What the hell are you going to do with a shirt? How much is it to go?” Then he asked for their bank account details and transferred the whole amount, approximately 50,000USD or 30,000GBP.  INAS doesn't receive any government funding for their work, so if want to support them in a smaller way than Zlatan, you could make a donation or buy one of their pin badges."

If they lose and Ghana wins, they are out of the tournament, also vice versa though a draw guarantees Canadians as well. Finland is out and N.Korea has cinch their first place.  Group B: Germany needs to make sure they don't lose and certainly not lose to Brazil on a certain amount of points as USA and China has the threshold to knock the Germans out of the tournament. Brazil can actually make it out of the Group Stage by beating Germany."

worldcup,2d4ix5,DownExtreme,4,Sun Aug 10 06:57:08 2014 UTC,"You're not wrong.  I think it's just got a very wide range of skill levels.  Some female players are very good, but some, even the best of their nation are not on the same level yet.  This seems like it would be common across new/developing sports (like women's soccer).  And with time, things will even out a bit more.  Even if they never get to the level of the mens teams, I still prefer watching the women's teams because they have been less eager to rely on dives and intentional fouls to stop play.  Hopefully the refs enforce things better and the trend stays as they get more skilled."

However, in how much fun you can have, women's and men's soccer are equally fun to watch.   People just don't watch women's soccer because soccer and sports has become associated as a men's activity. Either that, or women who play soccer are considered too masculine and need to be feminized (which  was done with the Brazilian women's national soccer team when they were told to wear tighter clothing to look sexier). It just comes to show how gendered society can be. sigh ._."

worldcup,2cnuaj,samiurkh1n,1 point,Tue Aug 5 16:09:32 2014 UTC,Your comment stands as an example of gendered norms. The logic of your biological evidence justified Social Darwinism.
worldcup,2cnuaj,prokaryt,1 point,Tue Aug 5 16:12:44 2014 UTC,Sports requires generally two things to excel: 1. Agility 2. Strength  Men are superior in every way at both these physical attributes. Not sure how you are equating stating men are physically stronger and faster than women to Social Darwinism? Social Darwinism is mroe related to race/culture pseudoscience than biological realities (For example the female peacock is much less colorful than the male version due to inherent genetic causes)
worldcup,2cnuaj,samiurkh1n,2,Tue Aug 5 16:19:54 2014 UTC,"Ya my statement wasn't explained enough - my fault :o.  Men are stronger biologically (sometimes) but we can't notice that from watching them play soccer. I will agree though that men, who receive better funding and training can play somewhat better, but that is entirely because of accessibility to opportunities. If a women team and a men team were trained equally, they would be equally good.   Now onto the analogy, I meant that you cannot use biology as a justification to define one category or identity as better than another. You are claiming that because men are biologically stronger, they are more enjoyable to watch. That doesn't become a reason to discriminate against other genders that play.   We need to also take notice in how we determine who plays well. Because sports are culturally associated as a men's activity, we claim that those who display masculine properties (of, for example, strength and agility) are good players. But why does strength and agility determine if a team of players is good? Why not, thinking quickly in risky situations, or in team work? Studies have shown that women have thicker celebral cortexes and more grey matter in their brains allowing them to think faster and multitask better than men. So why not use those terms as factors to determine if a team is good? That is because society is gendered and tends to associate activities and positions with certain characteristics to make them more predictable."
worldcup,2cnuaj,CureLime,2,Tue Aug 5 16:58:39 2014 UTC,"You are right that in some places, it is culturally acceptable that football is a boy's club thing. But it could be that Women's world cup is recent as the 90's and male's world cup is you know almost 100 years old. Age tells tale. Despite that, women's soccer is getting popular just like beach soccer. :3  You can see that women's football is more finer with technique that the male's but the male's can be exciting by agility and the truth is, a lot of people prefer exciting and predictable games than a clinical game."

I think perhaps something like what MLB does with profit sharing would be good. It would allow the spending, but then also allow smaller markets to potentially compete."
worldcup,2cl7kj,anon8609,3,Tue Aug 5 02:07:00 2014 UTC,"it will end parity, which could stifle the growth of MLS   Why? Does the lack of parity hurts La Liga? I'd rather have 4-5 very good teams than even mediocre ones."
worldcup,2cl7kj,fdar,0,Tue Aug 5 02:41:28 2014 UTC,But Germany isn't the same market as the US.
worldcup,2cl7kj,anon8609,1 point,Tue Aug 5 02:43:37 2014 UTC,"OK... so?  Without salary cup, you'd get good, exciting teams in big market cities, where people live and can watch them.  Who cares if Salt Lake City has a crappy team, if New York and LA are hugely popular?  And for casual fans, having a few regular games a year + playoffs facing very good teams is way better than having all games be evenly matched but mediocre.  I don't follow La Liga much, but mostly tune in when Barcelona/Real/Atleti play each other. I doubt I'm alone."
worldcup,2cl7kj,fdar,2,Tue Aug 5 03:01:07 2014 UTC,But in the MLS they don't have a legit champions League.  In Europe the super clubs all face off against each other in champions League. We don't have that luxury here in the MLS.   But on the other hand MLS uses a playoff system which could lead to some exciting games if an underdog is able to knock off a giant team.

They couldn't wrap their heads around the fact that we didn't train 2 times a day and only three times a week. To them school took a backseat to football. Not the other way around.  Also, tough to really develop when ""half"" of players in the Academy are ""using"" the USSDA to get into prestigious universities they couldn't get in without soccer i.e. Yale, Duke, Amherst, Davidson, etc. and not to sign a Homegrown contract.

Argued it at our state level ODP and lost. I removed my player from ODP because of it.   At this time the 5 best players in the state, two of which qualified for the regional pool and ALL of which were at regional camp last year, have now left ODP.  If you want the best players to move up you need to do things like 1) Respect 3-Peat state champions, 2) Stop worrying about how much money their folks have, 3) Quit requiring players and their parents to smooch your pooper in order to get recommendations / visibility.  ""In many cases, the talent pool consists of only the rich, not the top or best players. ""  Yup, another huge problem. If Mommy and Daddy don't have money they can't afford club level play.

If you live in a place with an MLS academy, are lucky, and obscenely talented then maybe you'll get a scholarship to an academy team. If you don't meet those criteria though you're probably screwed.  The MLS associated academy teams are great but there's so few of them and they're inconsistent in producing talent. Private academy teams can be better but they're expensive and often only located in metropolitan areas.  My son was recruited by several private academy teams and even though we could have afforded it (maybe) he would have had to live several states away for 9 months out of the year!

The Rest of the world trains their players academies in highschool and go straight pro as soon as they can. You pretty much go stagnate when you're in college and not grow into a super star like the best in Europe do(Messi, Ronaldo, Neymar to name a few) When I got my coaching license from the USSF, they recommended me to start recommending my best players to go to pro and not college.

A lot of people rag on the whole ""Soccer mom"" thing but it's really these types of families pushing for their kids to play in these sports that will eventually spit out our future MLS players."
worldcup,2c4y7j,Dragooncancer,6,Fri Aug 1 02:34:08 2014 UTC,"Body types are completely different. Guys that were born linemen or linebackers are most likely still going to play football.  Soccer will syphon some athletes from all sports in America, but what makes it interesting is that each sports uses very different skill sets and body types. Messi wouldn't make it in the NFL. Vince Wilfork wouldn't make it in soccer. And so on."
worldcup,2c4y7j,JimMorrison_esq,7,Wed Jul 30 18:51:26 2014 UTC,"Agree/disagree.  For linemen yes you are definitely right but almost any other position could crossover easily (WR, CB, RB).  Even many LBs or TEs could crossover if they were not intentionally trying to carry so much muscle for the sport."
worldcup,2c4y7j,Thebanks1,1 point,Wed Jul 30 19:25:11 2014 UTC,"Football trains their players to do one specific thing, every few minutes or so. A quarterback only throws, a running back has to be able to sprint, etc. Soccer has players sprinting and running for 90 min, with only maximum of 15 min breaks. Each position required to have similar skills yes, but a broader base of similar skills than football."

worldcup,2c4y7j,Ch1gs,6,Wed Jul 30 17:57:08 2014 UTC,"It depends where you live and go to school.  For me, in the southwest, highschool soccer was a winter sport, but club and mens league were year round."

worldcup,2c4y7j,Buelldozer,0,Wed Jul 30 20:26:07 2014 UTC,"soccer is a fall sport, at least for men.    That's not even close to being universally true in the United States, not even for public schools and CLUB level play is year 'round almost everywhere now.  I'm in Wyoming and HS plays it in the spring and our clubs go all year. In Montana, which is about as far north as you get in the continuous 48 states, it's pretty much the same. School in the spring and Club all year (with a few exceptions)."

worldcup,2c4y7j,CRPriceGA,9,Wed Jul 30 16:28:48 2014 UTC,A hell of a lot safer than Hockey or Football (NFL) I bet.
worldcup,2c4y7j,toastymow,5,Wed Jul 30 16:34:24 2014 UTC,This is true. Down south everyone young plays baseball. Ev-er-y-on-e
worldcup,2c4y7j,CRPriceGA,3,Wed Jul 30 16:37:04 2014 UTC,Which is odd because baseball has the highest fatality rate of all youth sports. I suppose it is the perception of safety that is important.

worldcup,2c4y7j,NeonshoesMcNally,1 point,Wed Jul 30 17:15:32 2014 UTC,Probably because of higher participation rate. More injuries/death are inevitable with more participants.
worldcup,2c4y7j,Meph616,7,Thu Jul 31 12:15:40 2014 UTC,"I played tackle football from 7-10th grade. background: I've been this tall since 7th grade and was on the back row. By 10th I was on the front and on the bench, then quit.  I started playing soccer during grad school, first in pickup but I've been on several indoor and outdoor teams since then. While neither is on a pro level, there is a big, and I mean FUCKING HUGE difference between the probability and severity of ""getting your bell rung"".  For every minute in a game, there is probably ten minutes of practice. Practice in soccer are passing drills, fitness drills, scrimmaging, and header drills. Practice in football means tackling drills, special teams drills, scrimmage drills (rapid fire same place plays run over and over).   My child will not play tackle football."
worldcup,2c4y7j,MrChivalrious,9,Wed Jul 30 18:20:31 2014 UTC,I can't believe the difference a question mark in the title can make.
worldcup,2c4y7j,el_cipote,2,Wed Jul 30 13:53:53 2014 UTC,Yeah. Though OP's title still reflects the arguments presented in the article.
worldcup,2c4y7j,JuanJeanJohn,7,Wed Jul 30 14:48:41 2014 UTC,"""Continual, steady growth from the Men’s National Team has not only boosted the team’s profile, but also highlighted the desire of young Americans to play a sport that was previously alien to them. Yes folks, football, has arrived in the USA, and it’s there to stay.""  I'm not sure where this perception comes from - soccer is an incredibly popular sport for young people to play in the US and has been for decades. It isn't ""alien"" to them in any way: the term ""soccer mom"" is ubiquitous for a reason. The problem isn't that soccer isn't played here by young people, but that the lack of its popularity as a professional US sport and lack infrastructure for youth development for it to become popular beyond grade-school years."
worldcup,2c4y7j,PretendNotToNotice,2,Wed Jul 30 17:36:42 2014 UTC,"soccer is an incredibly popular sport for young people to play   I agree that soccer is hardly alien to Americans, but I disagree that there's a lack of infrastructure.  At least where I grew up, the problem was the perception of soccer as a sport for children.  In my hometown, soccer was hugely popular for young kids.  More five and six year olds played soccer than any other sport.  If you met someone who only ever played a single youth sport, it was probably soccer.  Almost everyone quit around puberty, though.  The high school soccer team could barely muster a rag-tag group of not-really-athletes.  Meanwhile football, baseball, and basketball had several times more kids trying out than they had varsity roster positions.  We had guys show up thirty pounds overweight for soccer tryouts and end up as starters, while reasonably athletic kids who were desperate to be varsity athletes gave up on sports altogether if they couldn't make the football, baseball, or basketball team.  That lack of prestige is exactly the kind of problem that can be reversed by the excitement surrounding the World Cup and the USMNT.  (If soccer had been a fall sport, our soccer team would have been twice as good just by picking up some baseball players who wanted to stay in shape in the off-season.  Seriously, we were that starved for athletes.  The football players didn't want to play soccer, because they wanted to bulk up in their off-season, not slim down.)"
worldcup,2c4y7j,NeonshoesMcNally,0,Wed Jul 30 22:49:55 2014 UTC,The level of play in youth has risen is probably what the author meant. There are youth soccer clubs being springing up everywhere in the states. I know my youth club was sponsored by ManU and Nike directly. ManU paid our travels and Nike did everything else. I don't think youth clubs had that 10 years ago

worldcup,2c4y7j,NeonshoesMcNally,2,Wed Jul 30 15:27:18 2014 UTC,Seriously. It's hard to watch the MLS after watching the EPL. Get rid of the salary cap and bring the best players to America
worldcup,2c4y7j,know_worra_mean,4,Wed Jul 30 16:21:36 2014 UTC,"Or implement a salary cap on the rest of the world! It's intetesting how the US sports model is very socialist, and the European one very capitalist. I think the Americans have it right, but if everyone else doesn't play that way, it leaves them at a disadvantage"
worldcup,2c4y7j,NeonshoesMcNally,2,Wed Jul 30 16:58:19 2014 UTC,The only organization that can maybe get the power to do that is FIFA. And we all know how fair they are....
worldcup,2c4y7j,NeonshoesMcNally,1 point,Wed Jul 30 17:07:11 2014 UTC,I have always figured the salary cap was to keep the league competitive within the league. But double it? That's awesome.
worldcup,2c4y7j,Papalopicus,1 point,Thu Jul 31 01:29:20 2014 UTC,For that to happen people have to start taking interest. I don't think I've ever seen a MLS game air on TV.

Also I'm pretty sure they just signed a new deal with Fox or some that will bring them to the main channels of those stations. And you don't need more money to get rid of the salary cap, it has nothing to do with how much money they have it is in place to make sure that a team can't just buy up a bunch of good players and dominate the league because they have more money. But by trying to keep it even they are just hindering growth."
worldcup,2c4y7j,Acidic_Jew,3,Wed Jul 30 16:56:14 2014 UTC,"I feel about MLS the same way I do about minor league baseball.  It's entertaining, but not engaging.

worldcup,2c4y7j,Lame-Duck,1 point,Wed Jul 30 17:33:21 2014 UTC,I was hoping to find a premier league team to start watching. Tottenham Hotspur perhaps? Everton? Newcastle? Not a big frontrunner kind of fan. I would like to watch some team that has americans on it but i don't want that to be the only reason. Is Yedlin going to get picked up?  I don't have an MLS team in my area to watch and I probably wont start watching it on TV unless I move to a place that has a team and I see them live first.
worldcup,2c4y7j,Dizzymoth,2,Wed Jul 30 17:48:56 2014 UTC,Try West Bromwich Albion also known as The Baggies. Struggled last season now revamping the team. A long history and excellent supporters.

worldcup,2c4y7j,NeonshoesMcNally,2,Wed Jul 30 17:03:45 2014 UTC,Screw Tottenham. Dempsey had a lot of potential for them and they didn't play him.
worldcup,2c4y7j,JohnJohnPhenomenon,2,Wed Jul 30 17:06:25 2014 UTC,"Spurs and Everton are very good clubs that in recent times come in between 7th and 4th. Arsenal, Liverpool, and Manchester United are top ranked clubs with American ownership if that matters to you. By their standards ManU had a rough season last year so you might not get called a bandwagoner if you want to support them now.  I just picked a team based on a player I liked in international competition (Petr Cech)."
worldcup,2c4y7j,Lame-Duck,1 point,Wed Jul 30 17:10:05 2014 UTC,"ManU is too trendy for me though i know they had a down year. Arsenal is too much of a bandwagon team too i think. Hadnt really considered Liverpool, though they are on the cusp of being too good as well. At least historically. IDK. I think Tottenham is my squad, I just think it's a bad time to pick them. Maybe that's just what I want after looking again at my comments on the three you suggested ;) I guess I'm a gluton for punishment."
worldcup,2c4y7j,JohnJohnPhenomenon,2,Wed Jul 30 17:00:12 2014 UTC,"It might be a good year to be a Spurs fan, actually.  They've got a new manager but more importantly the huge amount of players they got with their Gareth Bale money have had time to sort themselves out. They're a good choice."

worldcup,2c4y7j,Buelldozer,3,Wed Jul 30 17:12:45 2014 UTC,"The guys below you gave the best answers they knew but they didn't really tell you why NCAA Soccer ruins our best players.    They play a very short season in the spring only instead of all year round. This severely limits these players ability to train and improve. This is huge. At a time when players everywhere else in the world are playing year round and expanding their skills and experience our players are only allowed to play for about 12 weeks. They play with different rules! A biggie is unlimited substitutions followed closely by the ability to return. This teaches players to run their heads off, get tired, get subbed, then return when they've caught their breath. Obviously you cannot play like this as a professional. Very harsh restrictions on off-season training and conditioning almost guarantee that if you follow the rules you will be unfit to play when you graduate.   That analysis isn't mine by the way, I took it from an article I read a couple of months ago. There are quite a few NCAA Div 1 coaches and MLS folks who feel the same way and are working very hard to push the NCAA into making Soccer a year round sport at the collegiate level."
worldcup,2c4y7j,NeonshoesMcNally,2,Wed Jul 30 17:51:00 2014 UTC,"School takes A LOT of time. And school is important to a college player. I know majority of my teammates see it that way. Which I believe is the right choice, but it hinders growth as a soccer player. A pro team will pick a player THEY have groomed for X amount of years than a player who played college. The best players in the world didn't go to college. They all went to soccer high schools. But the soccer highschools are springing up here in the states. Between the ages 18-22 is such a critical moment in a soccer players life. Hockey I believe is the same way."
worldcup,2c4y7j,TheFrigginArchitect,2,Wed Jul 30 20:41:21 2014 UTC,"College ""ruins"" the vast majority of college athletes who play televised, big money sports.  In 50 years all US sports will have moved over to a true ""minor leagues"" format for player development where players turn pro after middle school or high school.   Maybe 5% of televised college athletes are amazing time managers with the right priorities and they get good educations while they are playing football/basketball/hockey. The rest would be much better off going to college after their career as a professional athlete is over."

I'm not exaggerating when I say I could do better as a child.   He gets scored on directly from a corner.  He is chipped numerous times standing in the dead zone when literally anywhere further ahead or back would be significantly better.  He can't handle a shot from the halfway line.    Beyond that he's leading with his feet when he is challenging, another big no-no, he's not getting hmiself set for shots, which is why he looks so helpless to even ones very close to him.

One: We are getting ready for the world cup and need to play our best football at every match no matter the outcome. School of thought two: We should work on getting a few extra players a ton of minutes that might not get a chance down the road.    The striker who scored 14... that's shameful. Samoa unable to bring a team to actually keep it close- also shameful.    I would hate to play in this game as a player. In youth games- with unlimited subs- we would put on the whole bench and let the bench play away. My Freshman team (US high school) bench actually outscored the starters as the starters were pulled in about half the matches because we were winning by a large margin.    But to continue to just pound the ball in the net is shameful. But what else are you to do? Dribble to the corner flag over and over for 60 minutes? Blegh.

That is why the analogy falls short, you provided something that can NOT happen in boxing as an example for something that has no rules against it in soccer.   Australia had these kinds of matches ALL the time, which is why they wanted to move to qualify through Asia.  It wasn't uncommon for them to win by 10 or more.  It's not a challenge and it serves no purpose to have your players stand around for 60 minutes because you are up by 6 already.

Sportsmanship is not deliberately under-performing to make the opponent feel better - certainly not at international level. There is nothing wrong with thrashing your opponent.  Or do you think Germany should have stopped after they put the 5th one in against Brazil in the 29th minute? I mean, the match was over at that point. Brazil were gone with no way back, and they looked totally out of their depth at the back.  Maybe Germany should have eased up as a sign of sportsmanship."

So now youre playing at the highest level you can play at, and its a downgrade from your teenage years. I'm sure she grew up playing on grass and is very used to it. The pitch is so crucial to a soccer player. The way you run, how the ball bounces, how quickly can you cut. In the summer, the pitch will heat up and it really sucks when the ground is hotter than the already hot atmosphere in the summer. When you slide tackle, you don't glide across the ground, instead it will be a rough short slide. All of this this will not only disrupt the play but will cause injuries."
worldcup,2bzh2v,lntoTheSky,24,Tue Jul 29 02:06:52 2014 UTC,"In America I'd say you play a fair amount on artificial grass, especially in the cold weather reasons, so for the Americans and Canadians it won't be a huge adjustment, and will give them an advantage over countries that simply don't play on artificial grass. The ball certainly does move differently on it, but not so different that it's impossible. Kinda like going out and playing in heavy rain different. Sliding does suck, and the goalies will have problems playing bounces, but it's not game breaking or anything like that.  I think Rapinoe's problem comes more from the fact that FIFA mandates the men's cup to be played on all grass fields, going so far as to force countries (US '94 for example) to lay reconstruct the grounds so they are grass instead of turf. She probably just wants the women's side to be treated equally to the men's, and takes offense to the fact that they aren't."

worldcup,2bzh2v,Buelldozer,10,Tue Jul 29 14:03:39 2014 UTC,I submit that playing baseball on artificial turf is entirely different than playing soccer on artificial turf and that you're experience isn't at all relevant.  As an example Baseball players spend most of their time standing around scratching their crotch waiting for something to happen. Soccer players spend most of their time running. Your typical baseball player might run 1/2 mile (maybe) during a game. An average soccer player will run 7 and sometimes over 9.  Not to be offensive but you Baseball players aren't even in the same galaxy of athletic output that Soccer players are. It's not even close.  http://gizmodo.com/5992583/how-far-do-you-run-in-different-sports
worldcup,2bzh2v,wckb,1 point,Tue Jul 29 15:41:57 2014 UTC,"Define athletic output.  Obviously baseball players can get away with playing on turf due to less actual running (and even then the blue jays hate playing on turf and its a reason outfield FA's dont go there sometimes) but that doesnt mean less athletic output.  It all depends on your defintion.  If its running?  yes.  If it's hand eye coordination? no.  If its upper body strength?  No.  If its lower body?  I actually dont know, id lean towards soccer but baseball players get all their power from their legs so they arent slouches there either.  Athletic output could mean a lot of things."

Must be my eyes tricking me.  Baseball and soccer put emphasis on seperate things, so seperate body types are allowed.  How many seriously built soccer players are there?  Micah richards and... ballotelli?  How many fat baseball players are there?  A few, but not like its the overwhelming demographic of the league.  Besides plenty of those guys who are ""fat"" are jacked as fuck:   http://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--1xtSR9so--/c_fit,fl_progressive,q_80,w_636/m0wsre9rmz6tavzgrtls.png  So if you want to judge athletes by the distance they can run?

But its cool, you name fun of baseball players for being fat right?  I wonder how far that neymar kid could hit a baseball, or crouch, or messi, etc.  There are plenty of body types that would never cut it in baseball that work great in soccer and vice versa.  Baseball = strength with little cardio, hence bigger is fine, and soccer = pace and technique where smaller is fine.

People are actually losing their lives over there constructing stadiums and infrastructure and their human rights track record is far worse than Russia's. I'm still hoping they'll change the location, though I'm very much in doubt."
worldcup,2by8lw,never_mind_the_egg,11,Mon Jul 28 16:37:53 2014 UTC,"Yeah I'm pretty sure a lot of estimates were figuring that several thousand (~4,000) migrant workers will die in constructing the stadiums by the time they are finished, and around a 1,000 have already died in various accidents, suicide, and various health issues.  It's pretty pathetic.  Russia just has a lot of corruption going on within and outside of it's borders in a variety of issues, but it's no surprise that a corrupt organization like FIFA gives no fucks about either of these 2 instances whether it's Qatar or Russia.  2 good articles on this topic http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/may/14/migrant-workers-dying-qatar-world-cup http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/may/14/qatar-admits-deaths-in-migrant-workers"

Try as I have I just have a real problem with a World Cup in Qatar. The human rights abuses, the whole idea of holding the World Cup in such a tiny country, and the fact that it will be held in a desert in 120 degree plus heat does not make the Qatar World Cup credible.  Moving the World Cup to the winter would cause havoc with domestic and international schedules for several years and the corrupt way the World Cup was awarded make 2022 seem like a farce.

Russia, according to most of the world, is committing atrocious acts (both towards it's citizens and foreign nations), and FIFA thinks by awarding them a prestigious international tournament that this will some how bring about change. All it does is reinforce their actions. They can continue committing this acts, and are awarded with prestigious global events. FIFA, and the IOC, is just keeps patting them on the back as if to say ""Good job! Keep up the good work! Here's the Olympics/World Cup."""
worldcup,2by8lw,Tim-Sanchez,7,Mon Jul 28 16:11:21 2014 UTC,"It seems that FIFA has taken it upon themselves to try to turn countries around for the better. With this past world cup and the next 2 they seem to ""care"" more about turning a country around politically and economically.   Although Brazil is a developing country, the amount of money put into these stadiums was enormous. Some of them may never be used again. The infrastructure in Brazil is the thing that really needed the upgrade and wasting their time and resources on building these stadiums was not smart.  Russia's political unrest is dangerous for the players, coaches, and fans that want to come and watch the games. They have time and time again shown that they will continue to do what they want without any repercussions. Although the Olympics went off better than I expected, there were still the issues from videos posted about the horrid living conditions and the random arrests.   Lastly, Qatar. Qatar seems to be one of the worst decisions that FIFA has made. Not only will the temperature during the world cup be atrociously high, but the building of the stadiums are causing an expected 4000 people or so to die from unsanitary living conditions and the forced labor which the Qatar laborers are putting these migrant workers through.   FIFA and the IOC need to worry making sure their games are successful and safe more than trying to ""Fix"" the world. It's not going to happen, and as for FIFA i believe it all comes down to Sep Blatter. Most of the old board members are gone, why isnt he? They were all known to be corrupt."

Don't be a fucking bigot.  Edit: For the record, those ""savages"" have the lowest illiteracy rate in the Arabic world and among the lowest globally at 3.1%.  They also have one of the highest ratios of healthcare providers per capita.  The Qatari have a much higher than the global average life expectancy as well(about 8 years longer).  Edit 2: More facts.  The US has a functional illiteracy rate estimated to be as high as 14% and England estimates their functional  illiteracy rate almost 20%.  Qatari and the US have near identical life expectancies.  TL;DR:  Educate yourself, don't act like a bigoted prick because you are mad about a damn sport.

The deaths per capita is much higher in Qatari, but corruption can be found everywhere.  It is also worth noting, that as tragic as it is 2.3 million people die every year from work related accidents.  I am not attempting to justify the rampant death and corruption in Qatari.

I am not in any way claiming the Qatari government is doing something in the right.  I am only attempting to illustrate that corruption occurs everywhere in the world.  It is vile and reprehensible, but it does not make the every day people born Qatari savages.  They live in a constitutional monarchy.  They have no say in the laws or the actions of large government backed corporations.  The behavior of the powerful few does not necessarily reflect the voiceless minority.  To call the entirety of the Qatari savages, because of the actions of an organization in which they have no voice is akin to calling the entirety of Kansas ignorant bigots because Westboro Baptists yell louder than most organizations in Kansas.  It is not a fallacy to draw parallels.  I never claimed that the degree of injustice was the same.   I simply stated that it occurs globally and this allows one to illustrate that if one is to call Qatari savages based on the actions of a few, then so must all mankind be savages."

The bid that got most votes after Russia was Spain & Portugal. If they do take it away from Russia it should be hosted there. If for whatever reason they wouldn't want it, it should be the Netherlands and Belgium the next ones in line. And then England."
worldcup,2buyqx,sainone,9,Mon Jul 28 03:42:41 2014 UTC,Mostly the reasons are that neither country has had a World Cup in a while and both could host on short notice since they don't need to build stadiums or other major infrastructure.  The US has the majority of the worlds largest stadiums which are located in major cities able to absorb a large influx of visitors. Plus those stadiums are largely unused during the summer months. By 2022 there will be at least two brand new stadiums seating over 90k available one in Minnesota and the other in Atlanta which is a major international hub.  England recently had the summer olympics giving them large stadiums that could be easily made ready quickly. Plus they have relatively good mass transit. Much better than the US and Brazil.
worldcup,2buyqx,bdohrn,1 point,Sun Jul 27 16:46:18 2014 UTC,"I get that, only (most of) those arguments could be used for Spain and Portugal too.   There are large stadiums also unused during the summer months (this can be said for pretty much any european country with a renowned football championship), since most of the european football championships stop during that period. There are also big training facilities built specifically for football teams.  The infrastructures can handle it, the Iberian peninsula is already a big tourist destination so even hotels wouldn't be a problem.   Spain is well served in terms of roads (and even a high-speed train connection that links major cities) and Portugal just had a ton of them built in the last few years. There's also the advantage that it's not that big of a territory (obviously smaller than the US, this argument doesn't fit for England :p), so travelling is much easier, even for the teams involved.  Also, take into consideration that stadiums with enormous capacity don't count for much, at least not in terms of hosting a World Cup. FIFA tends to pick stadiums that sit at most 80 000 people, mainly for security reasons, and while they could pick large ones and only allow a certain number of people in, they like to have the stadiums (mostly) filled, so it looks good on TV.  Personally I just think that if the 2018 WC doesn't take place in Russia, it should be the next ones in line, not England and most definitely not the US that didn't even form a bid for that cup. Though that's a big if. I'm all for the US hosting the 2022 cup though. They were also the ones with the most votes for the 2022 cup after Qatar, so that's another reason right there."

You're asking for NASL and lower tiered teams to put together a player base that can compete with MLS mainstays.  The current system of tiered play and heavy salary caps is fragile enough as is. The caps and whatnot were meant to flatten the league, but even then there is already a gulf in talent that there's a clear difference between the Galaxies/Sounders/SKCs and the Columbus Crews/NE Revolution/Chivas US clubs. The NASL meanwhile seems to be made up of players just earning a ~$33k/yr salary.  It seems to me to be a bit unfair to relegate the bottom of the MLS teams to the NASL where they either need to cut a huge amount of star players or just strictly dominate the league and put the NASL teams into the MLS where they will be by far the weakest teams, or to expect NASL teams (and lower tier III and IV groups!) to act as if they had the stadiums, money, and fan-bases required to eventually move into higher divisional play when the sport is still relatively weakly established."

Soccer wouldn't even need to be the number one sport in the USA to put together solid teams year after year, anything near #1 would bring enough money to bring in huge talent that right now goes to other more lucrative sports.  We're just not going to ever win with it being like #5 or less."
worldcup,2bt1j7,Sarbara,1 point,Sun Jul 27 01:09:45 2014 UTC,It would be tragic if any  country where football was noit the no 1 sport won the World Cup when there are hotbeds of passionate footballing nations that for various reasons (mostly money and/or corruption) never got a chance.
worldcup,2bt1j7,blurgtheamoeba,13,Sun Jul 27 12:41:36 2014 UTC,"Many people do play soccer, the problem is keeping them playing past a certain age."
worldcup,2bt1j7,TheChoke,3,Sun Jul 27 01:34:38 2014 UTC,"Soccer may not have as many comercial breaks as other north-american sports but that doesnt mean it isnt profitable.   For exemple, you can put ads on jerseys, on the area outside the playing field and during the TV broadscast when the ball goes out of play."
worldcup,2bt1j7,MakeitHOT,2,Sun Jul 27 03:08:49 2014 UTC,It's not everyone though. We do a pretty great job of developing the average school kid.  I'd put our average 15 year Olds up against anyone elses.  Our problem is in identifying and training top talent.
worldcup,2bt1j7,sammysounder,2,Sun Jul 27 17:08:14 2014 UTC,I doubt that. All the major clubs in Europe have football academies that train kids with potential from a young age. They are going to have far better training than some random school.
worldcup,2bt1j7,Hara-Kiri,3,Sun Jul 27 06:44:01 2014 UTC,"What he meant, I believe, is that your average American kid (who plays soccer in a school team but would not be good enough to develop in a football academy) would be good enough to play against an average European kid who also doesn't go to a football academy. Soccer is widely played enough in the US by kids up to a certain age that your average kid is probably just as good as your average Euro kid (not your football academy Euro kids - they are not average lol). It's a very common sport for kids to play here, hence the term ""soccer mom"" is so widely used."

It's just one of those flukes.  But Cahill, seemingly, can immaculately calculate three things at once while receiving the ball in the box.  Cross or not.

That it's the truth doesn't change that it's a fallacious (and pretty shitty) way to argue a point. If I were to spout ""you're ugly"" as an argument rebuttal calling it the truth likewise doesn't change that it's an irrelevant and shitty way to argue.  The core argument is whether or not it is appropriate for the political issues to be fought out in football (I personally lean towards your way of thinking that it is) and dismissing someone's argument because they come from a country with high corruption is an ad hominem logical fallacy.  This is something about which reasonable men can disagree, it is a matter of whether you think football should be free of politics vs whether you think football is inevitably political and should maximize the good it can do politically."

worldcup,2bl9nc,Casaiir,6,Thu Jul 24 20:16:03 2014 UTC,"I was kind of hoping that all the tragedies that have occurred over there would force people to look at Russia and Qatar and bring up the discussion to take it away from them. Neither countries deserve the World Cup and FIFA should take a stand against countries that commit ethics violations and that are discriminate towards other people and cultures. Both Russia and Qatar are seriously behind the rest of the world in both these areas (not even looking at the logics of actually hosting the games) . I have been to the last 5 Cups and spend probably tens of thousands of dollars but I will not have a penny of my money go to either of those countries.   On top of that, we need to stop giving the cup to these ridiculous counties that don't even have the basic infrastructure handle it. The WC should be rotated every 4 year between countries that can already handle the games. Not countries that need to build massive amounts of stadiums from scratch that will never be used again. If a country wants to get in on the rotation they can show they are ready and be included."
worldcup,2bl9nc,lookatthemonkeys,3,Thu Jul 24 19:23:36 2014 UTC,You got that right.
worldcup,2bl9nc,lookatthemonkeys,0,Thu Jul 24 23:54:16 2014 UTC,"Actually, you are not right. The purpose of the World Cup besides of taking bribes, etc. is to make the game popular anywhere in the world. Your words basically means that only a few countries should ""rotate"" the ""WC money"". Not to mention that pretty much every WC host in the past built new stadiums independently of the old ones so this is not a real argument. As for the ethics violations and discrimination in Russia and Qatar, what about FIFA giving the Golden Ball to Messi?"

worldcup,2bl9nc,lookatthemonkeys,2,Thu Jul 24 21:13:30 2014 UTC,There seem to be some elements of the British press that would love Russia to lose the right to host the 2018 World Cup. The idea is that it could make England the favorite to host in 2018.  Not only is it unlikely that Russia would lose the World Cup it is not likely that England could gain that right since they finished bottom of the voting.   In all honesty FIFA cannot see passed it bank account and as long as they see the opportunity to make lots of money in Russia and Qatar both will end up hosting the World Cup.
worldcup,2bl9nc,gereth,2,Thu Jul 24 21:33:06 2014 UTC,"Honestly, I don't see Russia quaking in its boots just yet. The World Cup is scheduled to take place there in four years' time. Thus far hardly any football stadiums have been built - in many cities, much like in Brazil, it's uncertain whether these structures will even serve any future purpose beyond the tournament - so not much money would have been burned.   Ugh, DW has the journalistic quality of a high school newsletter. Half of what she says in the article was said just to impress us with her ""mastery"" of English expressions.  FWIW, most of the stadiums for Russia's world cup are either built already or under construction, except for I think 4-5 which will be starting soon.  Millions are invested, and there's plans for ALL of them to be used afterwards for various local teams/events."

The Japanese streetside restaurant seemed really touching. They had one TV and a couple fans but gathered a group that were probably so delighted to find that spot. The Germany fan finding a seat and new friends and food is what it's all about. The chef was excited to have another fan there rooting for Germany. I like to believe that he'll end up marrying that woman he ended up sitting next to. Just look how much fun that group is having!  I liked seeing how they captured the people at work enjoying the game. The DJ, the taxi driver, the barber, and the Japanese and Brazilian chefs. I was happy to see the driver was able to catch the ending of the game with the crowd after lamenting that he had to work.  The Brazilian Crepe chef was so excited for Germany lol. ""Hey! Brazil and Argentina can cry together!"" What a character!  The backyard BBQ is such a classic American experience. Burgers and dawgs, Lays potato chips, and Budweiser beer in American flag cans. With the riding lawnmower in the background lol! I like how he describes how Americans always think 0-0 is boring, then later in the video they catch his buddy complaining about the game at 0-0!   The Colombian guys tipping his chair back.  These guys having a slumber party like little boys in Kindergarten.  This Senegalese man celebrating like an American - but he does say elsewhere in the video that he loves football over everything and sometimes even has to fight with his wife lol."

worldcup,2bj23k,almost_an_engineer,2,Thu Jul 24 03:11:10 2014 UTC,thank you! someone here actually watched the world cup
worldcup,2bj23k,optimusjprime,-4,Fri Jul 25 17:20:25 2014 UTC,Just because they lost doesn't mean they aren't good defenders.
worldcup,2bj23k,Spavin,11,Thu Jul 24 05:08:47 2014 UTC,"7-1, not a regular 'we lost 1-0', while also conceding the first 2 extremely quickly."
worldcup,2bj23k,Faoeoa,-5,Thu Jul 24 12:10:03 2014 UTC,Exactly the first two goals left the whole team in shock. Most of their players were playing out of regular position due to injuries and cards. Can good players not loose? Look at Brazils statistics for defense
worldcup,2bj23k,Spavin,3,Thu Jul 24 12:56:37 2014 UTC,"You are missing the point though. Yes they are all good defenders, hence them playing for top domestic clubs. But this is supposed to be the 'team of the tournament', meaning the players who performed the best over the tournament. After that performance, none of this Brazil defence should be there.  There were far better, more solid and consistent defenders to put in. Boateng, Hummels, Vlaar, Blind, Kompany... the list goes on.  Good players can lose yes, but a 7-1 is a battering and they played that poorly that they do not merit a place in this 11."
worldcup,2bj23k,LaFlame,10,Thu Jul 24 18:50:45 2014 UTC,uh marcelo was perhaps the worst player in the entire tournament.  and david luiz and thiago werent a lot better. consolation prize to BR fans I guess.
worldcup,2bj23k,chrimewave,-12,Thu Jul 24 01:50:41 2014 UTC,Marcelo had a solid world cup. Good defense the while tournament. He even helped controlling the left midfield. You are thinking of someone else probably.
worldcup,2bj23k,Spavin,5,Thu Jul 24 05:10:19 2014 UTC,With the own goal and terrible throw in that led to being scored on? Maybe you're thinking of someone else.
worldcup,2bj23k,canuck1701,-6,Thu Jul 24 07:08:05 2014 UTC,A good player can't make mistakes? Statistically he still had an awesome World Cup and was one of the more consistent players on Brazil's team. Everyone is so caught up in the 7-1 game that they think Brazil had a bad team. There are many factors that led to that game inlcuding Germany's self admitted luck in completing all of their chances. Normally you complete 15- 20% of chances created but they completed near 90%. It was not a regular game by any means.
worldcup,2bj23k,Spavin,2,Thu Jul 24 13:01:38 2014 UTC,Those two mistakes were both before the 7-1 game. He didn't just have 1 off game.
worldcup,2bj23k,canuck1701,8,Thu Jul 24 18:30:30 2014 UTC,"Definitely not the best 11, just a typical let's play favorites by country popularity. How dare you call this team the top XI knowing that you have 3 Brazilians on the back line. All 3 of them are excellent when at top form for club but they weren't near their best in this tournament. Even if they were solid in group which is fair to say you simply can't give them this after the Germany debacle. Boateng should be on there with Hummels on D. The Germans owned all areas of the field this entire World Cup."
worldcup,2bj23k,KrishnaInKalki,9,Thu Jul 24 03:07:24 2014 UTC,You simply cannot have 3 Brazilian defenders in the dream team
worldcup,2bj23k,MacAndCrees,-16,Thu Jul 24 03:30:28 2014 UTC,Why? Better then 3 Americans
worldcup,2bj23k,Spavin,7,Thu Jul 24 05:10:59 2014 UTC,"We conceded 6 goals in 4 games, they conceded more than that in ONE game"
worldcup,2bj23k,goob3r11,-7,Thu Jul 24 06:07:17 2014 UTC,And that means your defenders are better right? Get on the right side of statistics. This dream team was voted on by 4 million people so apparent'y people agree with me.
worldcup,2bj23k,Spavin,5,Thu Jul 24 13:03:07 2014 UTC,"Not a chance, I do think they put in a better shift though. At the end of the day though, the American defenders wouldn't be able to make it at the club's the Brazilian defenders play at."
worldcup,2bj23k,goob3r11,3,Thu Jul 24 19:10:58 2014 UTC,Because Brazil let it in 10 goals in 2 games and were completely invisible. I didn't say I would put in 3 Americans and I wouldn't even put one in.
worldcup,2bj23k,MacAndCrees,-3,Thu Jul 24 11:38:35 2014 UTC,"Even with that game Brazil still had the most defensive tackles and saves. The factors leading up to that game are many but thinking that the players aren't quality players is ridiculous. Besides this ""dream team"" was voted by 4 million players so apparent'y agree with me."
worldcup,2bj23k,Spavin,3,Thu Jul 24 12:58:38 2014 UTC,Luiz over Lahm is a crime. I understand fans voted for it and this is just opinion but if you you are going by the tournament alone I feel you cannot include Luiz. with that said I would put Vlaar over Siva for the other centerback. Silva needlessly got himself banned for the semi final and it was clear it cost the Brazilian team.
worldcup,2bj23k,MacAndCrees,-4,Thu Jul 24 13:42:27 2014 UTC,Luiz is literally the highest paid defender in the world. You don't get that for not playing well
worldcup,2bj23k,Spavin,3,Thu Jul 24 13:47:20 2014 UTC,"no you get that because he can scores and people love that. P$G will throw impossible amounts of money to get the player they want, there is simply no way he is worth the 50 million they paid. He couldn't even break into the Chelsea back 4. He is probably a better midfielder than a defender to be honest. He doesn't have the discipline to be a great centerback."
worldcup,2bj23k,MacAndCrees,-2,Thu Jul 24 13:52:04 2014 UTC,That is the classic Brazilian defender style though. Backs that can score.
worldcup,2bj23k,Spavin,3,Thu Jul 24 13:53:43 2014 UTC,I get that but I'm just saying in my opinion I wouldn't take them on my world cup dream team. People voted them on though this is just my opinion
worldcup,2bj23k,MacAndCrees,-2,Thu Jul 24 13:55:56 2014 UTC,His performance in the last game was questionable but he did prove he can play midfield
worldcup,2bj23k,Spavin,10,Thu Jul 24 14:00:47 2014 UTC,In my opinion Germany is the Dream Team. Proof: they won the tournament lol
worldcup,2bj23k,GT5_k,4,Thu Jul 24 05:22:21 2014 UTC,"Really can't think of any weak links on the German team, it's almost cruel to pick and chose which ones are ""best""."
worldcup,2bj23k,Rakonas,-1,Thu Jul 24 08:49:19 2014 UTC,Ozil was slow... not to mention germany struggled against some of the weaker teams until they changed their formation. Germany had a good team but I think this world cup will be remembered by the fact that no one else had decent teams.
worldcup,2bj23k,Spavin,1 point,Thu Jul 24 13:05:32 2014 UTC,that was pretty much my thinking too.
worldcup,2bj23k,hosrider,5,Fri Jul 25 02:06:07 2014 UTC,"Personal picks:  Neuer Lahm, Kompany, Boateng, Blind Robben, Schweinsteiger, Sneijder Messi, James, Neymar  Lahm proved his versatility. Such a consistent and smart player.  Blind had more assists than most midfielders in the tournament.  Schweinsteiger was a fucking workhorse. And it didn't seem like he was dispossessed once the whole tournament unless he was fouled in the process.  Robben created a scoring opportunity nearly every time he had possession.  Sneijder covered more ground than almost anyone in the tournament. Missed his PK in the Semis though so he could be swapped out for any number of players.  3 forwards are self explanatory."
worldcup,2bj23k,wreckonize,4,Thu Jul 24 08:55:18 2014 UTC,"My team would be almost identical to this, perhaps getting Hummels in that backline and I'd swap Sneijder for Muller."
worldcup,2bj23k,LaFlame,7,Thu Jul 24 08:59:23 2014 UTC,"Hahaha, THREE Brazilians in the defense but no Lahm?  This is ridiculous.  But well, they gave the Golden Ball to Messi, so what do you expect.  Edit: Ok, the votes came from fans, but why do you let them even vote BEFORE the semifinal? Why not wait until the end of the tournament?"
worldcup,2bj23k,AlexS101,4,Thu Jul 24 09:20:55 2014 UTC,Why no Robben or Blind?
worldcup,2bj23k,canuck1701,0,Thu Jul 24 06:49:47 2014 UTC,Because Robben wasn't better than the forwards chosen except maybe Di Maria. That defense is a joke though.
worldcup,2bj23k,Junkyfunkycrunky,3,Thu Jul 24 07:10:05 2014 UTC,Lol. 3 of 4 defenders are Brazilians.
worldcup,2bj23k,funnyguy0914,3,Thu Jul 24 20:59:19 2014 UTC,Let's see :    No Lahm on defense.  3 Brazilians on defense  No Dutch players   is this some sort of joke ?
worldcup,2bj23k,NiggaWeMadeItOhShit,2,Fri Jul 25 14:57:55 2014 UTC,"Hahaha, what a joke."
worldcup,2bj23k,mysticalburgers,2,Thu Jul 24 14:54:16 2014 UTC,"Macherano and Vlaar should be on the dream team. Despite Vlaar's penalty miss, he is a great defender."
worldcup,2bj23k,wEEzyNL,2,Thu Jul 24 19:28:02 2014 UTC,rofl fifa is a joke.  3 brazil players? while they got rekt last 2 matches. sure this is believable
worldcup,2bj23k,bankseid,2,Thu Jul 24 21:59:46 2014 UTC,"hahahahahahaha... this lineup is fucking hilarious  The defensive lineup is a complete joke. Where are Lahm, Mascherano and Vlaar?

It's not as silly as you might think:  In qualifying, Germany went up 4-0 on Sweden before Sweden pulled back 4 in the last 28 minutes."
worldcup,2bl173,Rufus_Reddit,5,Thu Jul 24 14:53:47 2014 UTC,iirc there is no mercy rule in fifa. This is where the opposing team is already too far ahead for the losing team to beat.   Anyways I read that Germany 'held back' in the 2nd half so they wouldn't already embarrass Brazil even further.

What they did is intentionally play very vanilla football, with almost no hard challenges, to avoid a) getting anyone hurt and b) inciting frustration in the Brazilian players, which tends to lead to hard challenges in return that hurt people. They did continue to try to score."

He may have a point. The EPL plays 38 games and the top teams play even more games than that, in the FA Cup and in the Champions' League. Next season, the EPL will play until the end of May as well.   And there is no Winter Break in the EPL, like there is in other leagues.   The Bundesliga play only 34 games and they have a nice Winter Break of about four (or maybe six?) weeks.

worldcup,2be0zc,FathomThat,1 point,Wed Jul 23 03:51:00 2014 UTC,"Only time can tell, like it did in 2008 when Spain won the European for the first time. Spain had a very impressive run, from 2008 to 2012.   The German team is very strong a solid, though, replacing Lahm won't be easy.   For the 2016 Euros, Germany is already the favourite but let's see first how they get through the qualifications.    but Madrid won their Decima only like two months ago in all Spanish CL final.   You do mean it was an all Madrid CL final. Spain still has a lot of talent and we can't write them off just yet. The question is if del Bosque can rebuild the team in time for 2016 or even 2018."
worldcup,2be0zc,wikipuff,1 point,Wed Jul 23 04:00:28 2014 UTC,Most of the players had much more games than that since there was also Champions League and DFB cup to play. And there were some injuries as well (notably Reus out and Schweinsteiger/Khedira not at their best form)

I don't know why people expect us to do better, we've only had one or two world class players in the last 10-15 years"
worldcup,2be0zc,philyhad,3,Tue Jul 22 17:56:44 2014 UTC,"Terry, Cole, Gerrard, Lampard, Owen, Beckham, Shearer, Fowler, Scholes - in their prime, all of these players were World Class."
worldcup,2be0zc,Lefthandbat,3,Tue Jul 22 19:21:23 2014 UTC,"And the majority of those players made it to the quarter finals in two world cups and one Euro Championship. That is respectable for our general rank, where we played very well and were unlucky to lose out to Brazil and Portugal twice.  I disagree that Fowler was world class though. He was absolutely brilliant for Liverpool, but he never delivered on the ""big stages"". A huge part of being ""world class"" is that you deliver at all levels, at least in my book. I'd also argue that most of the others, whilst incredibly good, weren't world class for the same reason. I'd only place Scholes, Owen (pre-injury), Shearer and Beckham in the truly world class section."
worldcup,2be0zc,oliyoung,2,Tue Jul 22 21:22:48 2014 UTC,"I suppose it depends if you put ""performed well at major international tournament"" as a pre condition. Were Giggs, Rush, Dalglish, or Best world class? They never played in a major international tournament, but I don't think any one would deny that they were world class. They unfortunately are products of home grown talent, but chose another of the home nations, Bale today.  Fowler played at the same time as Shearer and wasn't given enough games to prove himself. Shearer and Fowler were both some of the best finishers in the world at the time, but they needed a target man along side them, and probably wouldn't have worked as a partnership well. I think Rooney needed to be the target man in this world cup and rely on Sturridge to finish, but he didn't do this. They needed to be strike partners and not two individual strikers.  I think Ashley Cole deserves more credit, I can't think of many better, consistent LBs in world football over the past 15 years."

For anyone who play footie, knows Cahill's goal was pure class and sometimes almost impossible to take on the volly. Had to judge the flight of the pass, he stutter steps, angles his body and manages to hit it at the right time. Rodriguez goal is far easier and helps that defenders are ball watching before the ball even somehow managed to get to him after a poor pass, poor clearance. You just don't let a player with that much ability stand 25 yards out in space, 3 yards from any defender."

worldcup,2bahq1,Biddooo,22,Tue Jul 22 09:57:59 2014 UTC,"No love for Gotze's goal? Right at the end of extra time in the world cup final, similar control to Rodriguez but also drops down on his ass to hit the volley, into the side of the net with almost no angle and the goalie closing him down?"
worldcup,2bahq1,VikingCodeWarrior,10,Mon Jul 21 16:22:19 2014 UTC,I think his goal is overlooked by many. The entire play leading up to it was great. Schurrle was awesome on getting that cross over and Gotze finished it perfectly.
worldcup,2bahq1,crocodile_in_denial,4,Mon Jul 21 16:39:55 2014 UTC,"Götze's goal required a high level of skill and it did win the gold for Germany so it was the most important goal of the tournament but in my opinion it was not as spectacular as the goals from Rodriguez and Van Persie. For me, a spectacular goal must be unique and memorable and I have seen other players score similar goals to Götze's."
worldcup,2bahq1,not_old_redditor,3,Mon Jul 21 19:41:21 2014 UTC,"Let's not forget that both the cross and strike were with the players' weak foot, schurle was double teamed, and they were both substitutes-making for a very symbolic changing of the guard to this younger generation of German players"

worldcup,2bbpdu,cnhn,-9,Mon Jul 21 21:28:45 2014 UTC,I wish Fifa would encourage cards for unsportsmanlike behavior.  If the defender comes they're going to pick up the ball.  Soccer is a game about a ball in play.  It's not about whether or not the ball is in play.

worldcup,2bbpdu,Barca8,1 point,Tue Jul 22 12:16:05 2014 UTC,"Where'd you get deception from?  I don't think it's unsporting behavior at all, deception is a huge part of the game -- if the referee blows the whistle and signals for the kick to come, the defense has to be ready, period.   Look at this goal by Messi, which was allowed in that game.  How is that any different in the spirit of deception from what Colombia tried?  If the referee signals to kick, the defense must be ready.  Certainly not the attacking players responsibility to make sure the defense knows when play has restarted.  Again, show me in the laws where deception is in any way sanctionable.  edit: Messi's deception free kick goal - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7PlBKfInAM"

worldcup,2bbpdu,Jorgemeister,1 point,Tue Jul 22 18:58:14 2014 UTC,"Well, the referee didn't caution anybody, so he wasn't thinking along those lines.  Also, feinting is allowed, just not in an unsporting matter.  Finally, Colombia wasn't feinting.  I think it's fully within the rules and sporting spirit.  It's cheeky, for sure, but that kind of creativity is very welcome in football.  I think unsporting would be feinting a kick over and over again without really trying to get an advantage, maybe to waste time or just to troll the opponents.  But definitely if you're honestly trying to get an advantage, that's the very definition of sporting and healthy competition.  Besides, it's very easy for the defense to thwart it if they are paying attention, if they have a lapse of attention, that's simply not the attacking team's concern.  Still not sure you've found the word deception anywhere in the laws of the game.  e: I did find ""deceive"" in the laws, but strictly in reference to feigning injury to deceive the referee."
worldcup,2bbpdu,crazyavocado,2,Tue Jul 22 19:29:31 2014 UTC,"Then I guess I'll just go with the renewal classes taught for the last 3 years where they've tried to remove these plays from the game. Referees are encouraged to stop these plays whenever they happen. That's why Howard Webb stopped this play in Columbia's previous game and why this one was stopped. This type of play is discouraged by USSF, UEFA, and FIFA across the board, and I'm glad they took the stand on an international stage."

worldcup,2b7sg2,efcdf,5,Sun Jul 20 23:40:48 2014 UTC,"FIFA gave the world cup to a country known for this practice, blood is on their hands too."
worldcup,2b7sg2,ikzevl,-9,Mon Jul 21 09:58:37 2014 UTC,"Serious time: why is it considered corruption for FIFA to accept payments, when FIFA is a private company that makes a profit? On top of that, it is entirely voluntary for a nation to host the cup. Don't criticize FIFA, criticize the corrupt governments."
worldcup,2b7sg2,not_old_redditor,36,Sun Jul 20 23:28:19 2014 UTC,"FYI, FIFA is a registered non-profit organization."
worldcup,2b7sg2,jdaisuke815,2,Sun Jul 20 23:46:16 2014 UTC,"""With over a billion in the bank.""  ""But it's a reserve!"""
worldcup,2b7sg2,Surlent,2,Tue Jul 22 15:14:26 2014 UTC,"Ha! ""You know things are going well when you have to check your rainy day fund for swimming cartoon ducks."" That's by far one of my favorite lines from John Oliver."
worldcup,2b7sg2,jdaisuke815,16,Tue Jul 22 15:22:49 2014 UTC,FIFA is a 'non-profit' organisation that doesn't pay tax. They are suppose to run tournaments to grow the game around the globe. FIFA needs to step in an accept accountability as they are putting their name on a tournament that will be hosted in stadiums that have the blood of 4000+ migrant workers on them
worldcup,2b7sg2,marcadonna,-9,Sun Jul 20 23:49:48 2014 UTC,"It's football, why can't you keep it separate from politics? FIFA does grow the game around the globe.  Should the US world cup and olympic games have been cancelled because they had just waged several wars? Germany because of what they did during WWII? UK because of all the shit they did? If we dug deep enough, every world sports event would have to be held in Switzerland and Liechtenstein.  The worst thing I can say about them is that they maybe don't fully qualify as a non-profit, and are dodging some tax money to Switzerland where I presume they would pay taxes."
worldcup,2b7sg2,not_old_redditor,12,Mon Jul 21 00:13:10 2014 UTC,"You are missing the point. This isn't about what countries have done in the past, but what Qatar is doing to migrant workers NOW, and the fact that FIFA and the WC sponsors have the ability to actually save lives and improve working conditions by putting pressure on the Qatar government.  I encourage you to watch this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlJEt2KU33I which explains how FIFA operates and what is going on in Qatar."
worldcup,2b7sg2,marcadonna,7,Mon Jul 21 00:43:36 2014 UTC,"Qatar is not about politics though. There's a difference. It's not a war of ideologies and conflict management. It's a group of rich guys in the desert saying they want to build some stadiums to specifically host the World Cup and want to employ ""slave"" labor to do it...and don't give a shit if they die building it. That could be expanded to Qatar's broader policy regarding migrant workers for non-FIFA related items, but the fact remains that the entire tournament would explicitly contribute to the death and mistreatment of impoverished people.   Your analogy would work if the US were blowing up villages with drones for the specific purpose of building World Cup stadiums in their place. As it stands, your analogy doesn't cover it."
worldcup,2b7sg2,M1eXcel,1 point,Mon Jul 21 01:45:40 2014 UTC,"When the only reason a country is hosting a world cup is because of a shit load of bribes and that country is practically using slavery to build the stadiums, it is pretty hard to keep the two separate"
worldcup,2b7sg2,Lame-Duck,1 point,Mon Jul 21 06:48:14 2014 UTC,"I'm not taking sides here, I don't like playing the karma game on Reddit, however, these people seem to downvote you because you did not not (or implied you didn't) that FIFA is a registered none-profit organization, but it really doesn't answer the second part your comment: ''it is entirely voluntary for a nation to host the cup""   I mean I realize that FIFA seems to be corrupt, at the same time, they did not force their cup to be hosted in Brazil or Qatar or wherever. Also, I realize that the Brazilians tried to revolute against their government: But still there are reasons that the Brazilian government actually wanted to host the cup because (I'm sure) they had their reasons that it was indeed a good investment."
worldcup,2b7sg2,Lame-Duck,1 point,Mon Jul 21 13:03:59 2014 UTC,"they did not force their cup to be hosted in Brazil or Qatar or wherever   No. They were bribed by Qatar so Qatar won the bid despite being in the desert, where playing conditions will be horrendous, despite being a place that ""hires"" migrant workers and basically enslaves them by holding their passport and not allowing them to leave. In the meantime these people are trying to simply survive in some of the worst living conditions imaginable. Fuck FIFA. They are responsible for this. There's no way they deemed Qatar the best bid for the cup in 2022 without being handed large sums of money. In fact, I believe some of their staff already admitted to it."
worldcup,2b7sg2,not_old_redditor,1 point,Mon Jul 21 13:26:17 2014 UTC,"see again, just quoting you ""despite being a place that ""hires mgrant workers and basically enslaves them""  that shit started before FIFA. I realize FIFA might'v made it worse, and I am not defending FIFA, fuck them, but they are not ""responsible"" for the injustice upon workers, in my opinion, they are merely a catalyst. If anything, FIFA's greed for money might'v shined some light upon a dark injustice by the government of Qatar (while again, I realize it was certainly NOT their purpose) that might lead to some greater justice upon these workers.  Disclaimer: I'v had a bit to drink and my grammar might be a bit off but hopefully you get what I am trying to say"
worldcup,2b7sg2,Lame-Duck,1 point,Mon Jul 21 13:31:45 2014 UTC,"that shit started before FIFA.    So? Slavery started before FIFA, should we just keep it then? I know people die working on big projects. Even near where I live in the USA, a kid got smashed recently on a bridge build when the crane operator fucked up and dropped a beam on him. This is different. These people are slaves. This is totally fucked and someone needs to step up for them. FIFA, sponsors etc.   Disclaimer: I'v had a bit to drink and my grammar might be a bit off but hopefully you get what I am trying to say   Oh, I get it. I just don't have the same apathetic attitude towards it anymore. Don't get me wrong, I understand your point but FIFA is responsible just as much as the rulers of Qatar are. Just because they don't actually enslave the people doesn't mean they don't know it's going on. And even if they didn't know beforehand, they know now. They accept huge bribes from nations who have no business hosting and turn a blind eye to everything the nation does to make the cup happen. When the shit hits the fan they need to be held accountable for their actions. They are going to have big problems on their hands if they don't start cutting some fat. By that I mean fire incompetent people and change the culture of bribery to procure bids. This Qatar situation just put it over the top. Someone needs to do something about it."
worldcup,2b7sg2,Lame-Duck,2,Mon Jul 21 13:43:19 2014 UTC,"Instead of expecting FIFA to do the dirty work, maybe you should contact your government that is enabling them, if you feel so strongly? The U.S. is the major equipment supplier for Qatar's oil and gas industry, and U.S. companies are playing a major role in gas development there."
worldcup,2b7sg2,not_old_redditor,1 point,Mon Jul 21 16:34:34 2014 UTC,That's an idea. Why not put pressure on FIFA and their sponsors as well?
worldcup,2b7sg2,Lame-Duck,1 point,Mon Jul 21 16:53:27 2014 UTC,"Someone needs to do something about it   for sure, but downvoting that poor guy at the start of this thread is not solving anything.   It seems to me that we both agree that fuck Qatar's corruption and FIFA's slavery"
worldcup,2b7sg2,not_old_redditor,0,Mon Jul 21 13:49:57 2014 UTC,"Well, I didn't downvote him but he is wrong about FIFA being private which you already mentioned in your original response to him which is why he probably got downvoted."
worldcup,2b7sg2,not_old_redditor,2,Mon Jul 21 13:54:47 2014 UTC,FIFA is private. It makes a profit. Their directors get paid. The restriction on non-profits is for them to retain revenue for use in expanding or preserving the organization.

worldcup,2b9fl2,deKay89,2,Mon Jul 21 07:52:43 2014 UTC,"It's quite smart actually that they do that. The NHL has a few replicas of the Stanley Cup that they use for tours, but they give out the real one to the winner. This has caused a few problems in the past. The best one I can think of is when Dallas won it in '99 and the heavy metal band Pantera threw a party for them at guitarist Dimebag's (RIP) mansion. Anyways, a few players got drunk, tried to throw the Cup off the roof and into the swimming pool, and missed. All members of Pantera were banned for life from touching the Cup."
