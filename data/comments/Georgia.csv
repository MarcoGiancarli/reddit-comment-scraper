Georgia,3db6op,olcrazypete,2,Tue Jul 14 23:47:43 2015 UTC,"Was just reading something earlier today, and its something I want to research more, but it seems the park and the carving were taken over by the state in the 1950s. The partial carving was recommissioned by the Governor at that time - right at the same time the Georgia flag was being changed to include the confederate flag, and for the same reasons.    Again, I want to read some more about it, but it really adds some doubt to my mind as to what to do with it.  If it were placed there with the intentions of honoring the men of the confederacy, then lets add some 'interpretation' type things around the park to help people learn just what these men did.  If it were commissioned as a big F-U to the people fighting for civil rights, then there is a big part of me that says get rid of it.  That has been my stance on the flag - it wasn't history, it wasn't old, and it wasn't placed for the reason of memorializing the soldiers - it was all added in the 40s and 50s as a sign of defiance against the civil rights movement."

Georgia,3db6op,olcrazypete,3,Wed Jul 15 04:56:38 2015 UTC,"That is a very good read.  So take the background that produced the old GA flag in 1956, and how all the same players and issues existed two years later in 58 when the state bought out the mountain and park area to complete the carving, and a very valid argument can be made on the same grounds as ditching the old flag.   I don't think most people know the true age of that carving.   The park doesnt' go out of its way to tell the age, I thought it was unfinished from the 1920s or so when the original sculptor left to do Mt Rushmore.  The fact that it was mostly done in the 60s and the park wasn't open till the 70s makes things a little different.   All this said, I have gone to see the lasershow more times than I can count. My kids love the ropes course there. I've noticed many families from many ethnic backgrounds there in the evenings.  Elvis singing dixie is the closest thing to an overt confederate hoorah. They do a good job of dancing around the elephant in the room (or on the mountain, in this case). Very torn on how I feel about this."

Right now, the park is going for dollywood-lite it seems and ignores the history part completely, especially the dark parts.    I say this, but I've never taken the time to go to the other parts of the park other than the field, the top of the skilift,  and the 'downtown disney' type area. Maybe they do a better job of this elsewhere in the park and i'm ignorant."

Georgia,3db6op,justcamp,2,Wed Jul 15 22:28:51 2015 UTC,Borglum's work on Stone Mountain was never completed.  Augustus Lukeman was responsible for the final carving.
Georgia,3db6op,fluent_dysphasia,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:35:45 2015 UTC,"Sorta correct, Borglum was responsible for the design. Originally, it was going to feature the full forms of the horses of the men, not just their top halves. Davis, Lee, and Jackson were going to be followed by hundreds of Confederate soldiers in a spectacular charge. As the project was privately and not publicly funded by the United Daughters of the Confederacy, they settled on Davis, Lee, and Jackson followed by four soldiers. Borglum had completed Lee's head and started on the bust during World War I, but the private funds had run almost dry. The carving would now comprise of Davis, Lee, Jacksom, and one Confederate soldier. Borglum was unable to get along with members of the UDC who were paying for the carving, so he left in 1925 to work on Mount Rushmore.  Lukeman worked for three years from 1925 until 1928 when the UDC lost their temporary deed to the mountainface. In the 1950's Georgia legislature bought Stone Mountain and the surrounding area, set aside public funds for the project, and Walker Hancock finished the carving we know and love today in March 1972."

Davis, Lee, and Jackson were.1 2   But not to be tedious in enumerating the numerous changes for the better, allow me to allude to one other though last, not least. The new constitution has put at rest, forever, all the agitating questions relating to our peculiar institution African slavery as it exists amongst us the proper status of the negro in our form of civilization. This was the immediate cause of the late rupture and present revolution. Jefferson in his forecast, had anticipated this, as the “rock upon which the old Union would split.” He was right. What was conjecture with him, is now a realized fact. But whether he fully comprehended the great truth upon which that rock stood and stands, may be doubted. The prevailing ideas entertained by him [ED: Jefferson] and most of the leading statesmen at the time of the formation of the old constitution, were that the enslavement of the African was in violation of the laws of nature; that it was wrong in principle, socially, morally, and politically. It was an evil they knew not well how to deal with, but the general opinion of the men of that day was that, somehow or other in the order of Providence, the institution would be evanescent and pass away. This idea, though not incorporated in the constitution, was the prevailing idea at that time. The constitution, it is true, secured every essential guarantee to the institution while it should last, and hence no argument can be justly urged against the constitutional guarantees thus secured, because of the common sentiment of the day. Those ideas, however, were fundamentally wrong. They rested upon the assumption of the equality of races. This was an error. It was a sandy foundation, and the government built upon it fell when the “storm came and the wind blew.”   -Alexander Stephens, future VP of the confederacy, March 21, 1861"

It's even more hilarious in conjunction of the Declaration. To even compare the Cornerstone Speech with the Declaration of Independence is to show the depth of your misunderstanding. The Declaration of Independence was an official document with legal authority to be presented to the English crown. On the other hand, the Cornerstone speech was a rally speech with as much legal authority as Reagan's ""Tear Down This Wall"" speech. It may reflect the sentiment of some, but it was given as a form of pep rally with no legal authority or ramifications.  I'd also like to add that in President Davis' memoirs The Rise and Fall of the Confederate Government, Pres. Davis explicitly rejects slavery at the primary of even as a major factor in the formation of the Confederate government. I know it's nice to have a clear cut, black and white reason for the war, but that is simply not the case."

Second and third sentence.  They get right down to it.  Congress is specifically empowered to ""provide for calling forth the Militia to execute the Laws of the Union, suppress Insurrections and repel Invasions"".   The ""violence"" that the south was trying to ""defend themselves"" from was the entirely legal response to their revolt.  The traitor states of the Confederacy all ratified that document, and then, when Congress legally refused to allow new slave states and they lost an election to an (actually very moderate) abolitionist, they decided to commit a blatant act of insurrection.  They could have gotten paid!  Lincoln wanted to end slavery through a gradual, compensated process!

After the police vehicle incident, I submitted an open records request to find out how many handicap parking tickets had been written by the police in the past two years - the answer was ZERO.

Georgia,3ctst7,Magnoliid,0,Sat Jul 11 16:30:35 2015 UTC,"For the record, folks, I am not a ""copwatcher"".  I recently started recording only because I know the police in our city are overly aggressive.  With an open records request, I discovered that the police have NEVER written a handicap parking violation in the past two years.  My wife & I are both disabled and federal law dictates that those spaces are only for the disabled.  State law specifies that ANY intrusion into the space is a violation, so the idiot who suggested I could park crooked too, is off base.  Look up the Americans with Disabilities Act and Google O.C.G.A. 40-6-226.  Educate yourselves before you start making negative and insulting remarks.  If I had NOT been recording, in this instance, things would have turned out much worse."

There was no reason for you to do that except to test the police."
Georgia,3ctst7,Magnoliid,3,Sat Jul 11 15:15:12 2015 UTC,"Well, I see your point, but I'm determined to keep an eye on our local department (very few officers) because of past confrontations with them violating their oath of office.  There's some history there that is entirely too complicated to go into in detail. I've just gotten fed up with being bullied by these guys. I enforce court judgments, which puts me in a position to seize property and money.  These cops have repeatedly injected themselves into civil matters under the color of law, using threats and intimidation.  This kind of thing has to stop, and since I didn't have any documented evidence of those incidents, I decided to arm myself and take whatever opportunity I had to expose their bullshit, no matter what it was.  The issue is having police push people around as if their word is the law.  It isn't.  I hope you can see the reasons for this now."

Georgia,3ctst7,icdmize,5,Sat Jul 11 20:04:46 2015 UTC,"With all due respect, I didn't pick a fight with the police - a police officer parked in a handicap space two weeks before this incident.  He was rude and disrespectful when I asked him to move his patrol car.  Once he did, it still blocked the space.  My wife and I are both disabled - she worse than me.  So, after seeing another city vehicle violating the handicap parking law, it upset me a bit.  Especially since I asked the driver to go move her car and not park in the handicap space.  She, too was rude and said ""well, you just have a nice day"".  If you pay attention to the video, I was pretty congenial in the beginning, even joking with the officer (or as it was intended) ""you're not going to tell me you won't write a ticket, right ?""  He immediately went into confrontation mode. His supervisor even took less time to get there.  I'm not intentionally ""picking fights"" with them.  They've been doing things like this for a long time and it's time to hold them accountable.  Thanks for your input.  I appreciate all comments, pro or con."

Patrons are confronted with a selection of crude cartoons and graffiti, and a menu that declares, on the appetizer page, “We cater to hangins’.”   This seems telling"

All I can think is that comment anti-evolutionists use asking if evolution is true why are there still monkeys  This strikes me as the same misunderstanding  And no, I have never seen such an overt display anywhere. And I grew up in a Midwest town where people gave me weird looks when I'd walk around town with a black girl (we would come back to visit my parents)  Edit: This is also weird to me   Such displays have caused trouble here in the past. In September 2000, someone painted over a flag at the gym, and students were allowed to vote on whether to repaint it. Repainting won by a vote to 861 to 150, according to news reports at the time. A group of black football players threatened to boycott a game, but that never materialized. It all seemed perplexing to Cain Jackson, a 22-year-old graduate, who is white."

Next, let's all go laugh at their education level and household income.  FWIW, the flag should absolutely be removed from government facilities, like the high school. To be fair, the painting of the flag was once displayed clearly on the school's gym exterior. As it stands now, thanks to public opinion at the time, the flag at the high school is hardly prominent. It's located inside of a small trophy room inside of the gym, mostly covered by plaques and trophies.   As far as politicians in rural counties like Haralson are concerned, that is another issue altogether.

I gathered this data for this using a modified version of a script made by the folks over at /r/MUWs. If you want to create your own word cloud for another subreddit, you can post requests there. I have also done several requests and as I have several sports and city related dictionaries I use to filter out particularly common words that are not normally detected. If you would like one made for any subs, just say the word and I'll crank it out. The actual word maps were made through Wordle. My apologies if these are difficult to see. I suffer from monochromatic colorblindness, so I had to use hex codes I found online when putting this together. Common words such as ""city"", “the”, “and”, “I'm”, as well as numbers were removed from the clouds.  I will be using this data to update my state/city/regional subreddit profanity analysis. I will also be running the numbers to see which of the subs have the most active discussion. My city and international clouds should be coming out in a week or so.  If you have any questions about specific frequencies of the words, the top words are under the third image in the album. I typically removed the largest words on the second and third images, as they were so large they typically made the other words harder to see. Only two states had words larger than their state name/abbreviation as the largest word, Wisconsin with ""Walker"" (our governor) and California with ""Water"".

Georgia,3b70xy,jsh1138,9,Fri Jun 26 16:42:51 2015 UTC,"The Supreme Court's job is to interpret the constitution.

The eminent domain ruling a was a joke, the ""obamacare is a tax"" ruling was too, and these last 2 this week are out and out usurping the role of the legislature.   ""well this is what the law is but that is what it ought to be and since i like that idea i'm going to go with that and not what it actually says"" is not review in any sense of the term."
Georgia,3b70xy,jsh1138,2,Sat Jun 27 01:32:54 2015 UTC,"The law was interpreted to cover persons who want to marry same sex partners. But, like Loving v Wade, that's bad and Dred Scott was good, because it affirmed the status quo. What you are saying is, the Supreme Court can't make any decisions which change the law of the land, because that would be creating new laws. That's (all together now, like good parrots) legislating from the bench--well unless you agree with the decision, that is. If they legislated from the bench to strike down the ACA that would be good, because you don't like the ACA.  When the Supreme Court acts, laws can change. That's how judicial review works. You and I won't always like the conclusions the court reaches. And yes, the political philosophies of the justices affect how they interpret the law. If they didn't, we wouldn't know who were the conservative and who were the liberals. Get over it. If everyone agreed on how to interpret the constitution then we wouldn't need a Supreme Court. We don't always agree and so we have a system to deal with that. We have people who are insulated from the whims of public opinion by being appointed for life. But they are nominated by someone the people elected to make that decision and they are confirmed by people we elected to do that. Of course you would love to undo that system by impeaching justices you disagree with.  Let me quote you on something else you said:   Segregation being ended by a court when 3/4's of the country disagreed with it and had laws against it was one thing but most states and most people have made their opinion clear on gay marriage and this is the exact opposite of what the people want.   So if the majority of the country were in favor of segregation then you'd have been for keeping it? I mean, what has public opinion got to do with constitutionality? Should justices be swayed by public opinion or ignore it?  Well, 2015 polls say most people are in favor of same-sex marriage and/or believe it is a constitutional right. Not that it matters, because because we shouldn't be voting on whether or not to give citizens equal treatment under the law."
Georgia,3b70xy,TheSpanishImposition,4,Sat Jun 27 02:45:58 2015 UTC,"Man, if only there were something that was in a legal document of some sort which pointed out that everything is a right, even if it isn't specifically mentioned.

The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.   9th Amendment   The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.   10th Amendment"

Georgia,3b70xy,jsh1138,16,Fri Jun 26 18:05:55 2015 UTC,"The reason these laws get passed Federally is that sometimes a state's representatives or population in general can not objectively see or simply don't care about the liberties they deny some people, usually a minority group.  Think about how Georgia would be if segregation was still legal, if slavery still existed, if no person had a legal right to a legal defense representative, if education was still legally denied to some people. We still have some laws that try to circumvent these supreme court rulings, but when a state fails to uphold the laws of the nation of which it is a part, it is up to the Federal government to correct that state's error."
Georgia,3b70xy,iPostedJustForYou,-18,Fri Jun 26 15:25:53 2015 UTC,"The reason these laws get passed Federally   gay marriage hasn't been passed federally. DOMA was, and Obama decided not to defend it or enforce it, ignoring the legislature. More states than not passed laws banning gay marriage or defining marriage as between a man and a woman, and that hasn't been changed by legislatures, its been changed by judges.   So that's fine, lets just stop electing legislatures and spending all that money on elections, if judges and the president run this country, that's all i'm saying.    Also btw the Constitution provides impeachment of justices to act as a balance for them ignoring the will of the people"

Georgia,3b70xy,jsh1138,3,Fri Jun 26 17:14:20 2015 UTC,"There are similar organizations for Democrats, but they all function the same way: hooking corporations up with politicians that can benefit their interests. Doesn't matter what party they represent, I despise the very idea of this.   And acting on a state level is largely a republican strategy while the democrats tend to like federal, all-inclusive rulings. It's two different paths, but as we learned today, one trumps the other while admittedly taking longer to do so. I think we fought a war over that, or something."
Georgia,3b70xy,eastcoastian,20,Fri Jun 26 17:23:24 2015 UTC,Because sometimes those laws violate peoples' rights. That's why we have a Constitution.

Segregation being ended by a court when 3/4's of the country disagreed with it and had laws against it was one thing but most states and most people have made their opinion clear on gay marriage and this is the exact opposite of what the people want."

That's why we have a Constitution, and we have a judiciary that makes sure that our laws don't conflict with the constitution. Guess what? These laws did. You can want whatever you want, but our Constitutional rights are more important. Just like some liberals might want to get rid of guns, they can't have it, because the 2nd amendment is clear. Much in the same way, the 14th amendment is clear. Same sex marriages in a state that has opposite sex marriages must necessarily be legal. Failing to make that the case is an affront to equal protection under the law."

Georgia,3b70xy,vreddy92,-12,Fri Jun 26 16:08:49 2015 UTC,"That's the way the Constitution set it out to be.   no its not, at all. Jefferson fired every federal judge in the country once. FDR had no problem ordering the Supreme Court to rule a certain way in WW2. the judiciary is set up to be the weakest branch, not the strongest.    The rights aren't invented, they're in the Constitution   except when they're invented by the court. abortion rights are not in the constitution, they were invented. gay marriage is not in the constitution, gay sex was expressly illegal for 90% of our nation's history. these are recent rights that were ""found"" by the court, not included by the founders.   They're not some idiots in a room.   you think the 4 that said this is absurd are idiots though? or there's room to disagree?   All i'm saying is that this should have been handled by Congress. Ruling by declaration is not what our country is about and this is not going to lead to anything good."

Because eventually we realize the unjustness of the laws.  The other four justices disagree with the ruling, and they're entitled to that disagreement. If Justice Kennedy also disagreed, then it wouldn't have happened. But he didn't, which is the idea.  Also, 14th amendment is in the Constitution. Just like the 2nd is. Either way, this ruling is in no way different than Loving v. Virginia. Do you want those justices impeached as well?"

Georgia,3b70gi,iambecomedeath7,3,Fri Jun 26 16:19:27 2015 UTC,"Well, Chelsea Manning is something of a special case. What she did was treasonous, but it was a treason motivated by a strong conscience and sense of ethical propriety. Seeing as how so much good came of that leak and the public now knows much more about the horrible things our government is doing, I'd say that it's a justifiable treason.  Besides, you'll often find that your Chelsea Mannings and Edward Snowdens are motivated by deep seated patriotism. We could use more traitors like them.

Georgia,3b70gi,beard_the_fuck_up,7,Fri Jun 26 16:49:09 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's about ""forgetting our history"" It's more about not being proud of our history. Look at it as if some people in Germany were allowed to ride around with swastikas on their vehicle, flying swastikas on their government buildings, having statues of prominent nazi figures in their government facilities. They are fully aware of the holocaust but they are certainly not trying to use it as a symbol of pride in their history."
Georgia,3b70gi,RelicoFlame,6,Fri Jun 26 17:02:35 2015 UTC,"Well, it's more like if Germans went around flying Black, Silver, and Red flags and remembering the Germans who fought in WWII while disliking (or perhaps feeling no particular way about) National Socialism. Nazism =/= German pride. In much the same way, Racism =/= Southern pride.   The Confederate Battle Flag isn't so terrible. It was simply the banner of a group of men who fought back against what they saw as an invasion from the North and is therefore a perfectly valid symbol of rebelliousness and Southern heritage. It's the first national flag of the Confederacy that was forged by a bunch of slave owners for a government designed to keep black people in bondage. That one seems to get a pass, though. It's even in the state flag today as a 'compromise' from when people got offended about the '56 flag. It seems like a step backwards to me, but whatever."
Georgia,3b70gi,iambecomedeath7,6,Fri Jun 26 17:09:39 2015 UTC,The confederacy was know for things that modern society fully distinguishes as negative. Please tell me the positive associations you have with the confederacy apart from choosing to support their own freedoms?
Georgia,3b70gi,RelicoFlame,5,Fri Jun 26 15:34:47 2015 UTC,"I completely support the sentiment of representing their true freedoms. but that is not what a lot of people brandishing that flag mean to show. I have a few country ass friends that have that flag everywhere because to them it represents freedom but I, personally, have been in contact much more frequently with individuals who use the flag to showcase their racist beliefs. I can't say for certain one way or the other that most people are showcasing it to represent freedoms, or racism, but in my experience it has been a legal way to show pride in the racial aspects of the the confederacy. Taking it out of all stores (apple, walmart, amazon, etc.) is extreme but i do believe it has no place in government properties outside of museums."
Georgia,3b70gi,RelicoFlame,3,Fri Jun 26 15:59:17 2015 UTC,"I think you're seeing it from a stand point of person who is logical and progressive.

About an hour north in copper hill  tn is a horse ranch that has nice over hour rides through the mountains if the kids are old enough.   Along with the ranch there's a gold mining place that's cute with a couple western oriented mueseums.   There's also several hour long hikes that are easy trails that lead to waterfalls and such.   There's of course white water rafting and ziplines.   As someone else mentioned there's the railway it leaves depot at noon and is a good several hour ride.

From Wikipedia: English settlement began in the early 1730s after James Oglethorpe, a Member of Parliament, proposed that the area be colonized with the ""worthy poor"" of England, to provide an alternative to the overcrowded debtors' prisons. Oglethorpe and other English philanthropists secured a royal charter as the Trustees of the colony of Georgia on June 9, 1732.[2] The misconception of Georgia's having been founded as a debtor or penal colony persists due to the numerous English convicts who were later sentenced to transportation to Georgia.

Georgia,38on5j,eastcoastian,2,Fri Jun 5 17:51:56 2015 UTC,"If you google ""Murders in Atlanta were up 32%"" it is the first article and there is no paywall. Sorry about that I thought the paywall had been removed.    The nation’s two-decades-long crime decline may be over. Gun violence in particular is spiraling upward in cities across America. In Baltimore, the most pressing question every morning is how many people were shot the previous night. Gun violence is up more than 60% compared with this time last year, according to Baltimore police, with 32 shootings over Memorial Day weekend. May has been the most violent month the city has seen in 15 years.  In Milwaukee, homicides were up 180% by May 17 over the same period the previous year. Through April, shootings in St. Louis were up 39%, robberies 43%, and homicides 25%. “Crime is the worst I’ve ever seen it,” said St. Louis Alderman Joe Vacarro at a May 7 City Hall hearing.  Opinion Journal Video Manhattan Institute Fellow Heather Mac Donald discusses the nationwide crime wave and its inner-city victims. Photo credit: Getty Images. Murders in Atlanta were up 32% as of mid-May. Shootings in Chicago had increased 24% and homicides 17%. Shootings and other violent felonies in Los Angeles had spiked by 25%; in New York, murder was up nearly 13%, and gun violence 7%.   Those citywide statistics from law-enforcement officials mask even more startling neighborhood-level increases. Shooting incidents are up 500% in an East Harlem precinct compared with last year; in a South Central Los Angeles police division, shooting victims are up 100%.  By contrast, the first six months of 2014 continued a 20-year pattern of growing public safety. Violent crime in the first half of last year dropped 4.6% nationally and property crime was down 7.5%. Though comparable national figures for the first half of 2015 won’t be available for another year, the January through June 2014 crime decline is unlikely to be repeated.  The most plausible explanation of the current surge in lawlessness is the intense agitation against American police departments over the past nine months.  Since last summer, the airwaves have been dominated by suggestions that the police are the biggest threat facing young black males today. A handful of highly publicized deaths of unarmed black men, often following a resisted arrest—including Eric Garner in Staten Island, N.Y., in July 2014, Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo., in August 2014 and Freddie Gray in Baltimore last month—have led to riots, violent protests and attacks on the police. Murders of officers jumped 89% in 2014, to 51 from 27.  President Obama and Attorney General Eric Holder, before he stepped down last month, embraced the conceit that law enforcement in black communities is infected by bias. The news media pump out a seemingly constant stream of stories about alleged police mistreatment of blacks, with the reports often buttressed by cellphone videos that rarely capture the behavior that caused an officer to use force.  Almost any police shooting of a black person, no matter how threatening the behavior that provoked the shooting, now provokes angry protests, like those that followed the death of Vonderrit Myers in St. Louis last October. The 18-year-old Myers, awaiting trial on gun and resisting-arrest charges, had fired three shots at an officer at close range. Arrests in black communities are even more fraught than usual, with hostile, jeering crowds pressing in on officers and spreading lies about the encounter.  Acquittals of police officers for the use of deadly force against black suspects are now automatically presented as a miscarriage of justice. Proposals aimed at producing more cop convictions abound, but New York state seems especially enthusiastic about the idea.  The state’s attorney general, Eric Schneiderman, wants to create a special state prosecutor dedicated solely to prosecuting cops who use lethal force. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo would appoint an independent monitor whenever a grand jury fails to indict an officer for homicide and there are “doubts” about the fairness of the proceeding (read: in every instance of a non-indictment); the governor could then turn over the case to a special prosecutor for a second grand jury proceeding.  This incessant drumbeat against the police has resulted in what St. Louis police chief Sam Dotson last November called the “Ferguson effect.” Cops are disengaging from discretionary enforcement activity and the “criminal element is feeling empowered,” Mr. Dotson reported. Arrests in St. Louis city and county by that point had dropped a third since the shooting of Michael Brown in August. Not surprisingly, homicides in the city surged 47% by early November and robberies in the county were up 82%.  Similar “Ferguson effects” are happening across the country as officers scale back on proactive policing under the onslaught of anti-cop rhetoric. Arrests in Baltimore were down 56% in May compared with 2014.  “Any cop who uses his gun now has to worry about being indicted and losing his job and family,” a New York City officer tells me. “Everything has the potential to be recorded. A lot of cops feel that the climate for the next couple of years is going to be nonstop protests.”  Police officers now second-guess themselves about the use of force. “Officers are trying to invent techniques on the spot for taking down resistant suspects that don’t look as bad as the techniques taught in the academy,” says Jim Dudley, who recently retired as deputy police chief in San Francisco. Officers complain that civilians don’t understand how hard it is to control someone resisting arrest.  A New York City cop tells me that he was amazed to hear people scoffing that Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson, who killed Michael Brown, only looked a “little red” after Brown assaulted him and tried to grab his weapon: “Does an officer need to be unconscious before he can use force? If someone is willing to fight you, he’s also willing to take your gun and shoot you. You can’t lose a fight with a guy who has already put his hands on you because if you do, you will likely end up dead.”  Milwaukee Police Chief Edward A. Flynn, discussing hostility toward the police, told me in an interview on Friday: “I’ve never seen anything like it. I’m guessing it will take five years to recover.”  Even if officer morale were to miraculously rebound, policies are being put into place that will make it harder to keep crime down in the future. Those initiatives reflect the belief that any criminal-justice action that has a disparate impact on blacks is racially motivated.  In New York, pedestrian stops—when the police question and sometimes frisk individuals engaged in suspicious behavior—have dropped nearly 95% from their 2011 high, thanks to litigation charging that the NYPD’s stop, question and frisk practices were racially biased. A judge agreed, and New York Mayor Bill de Blasio, upon taking office last year, did too, embracing the resulting judicial monitoring of the police department. It is no surprise that shootings are up in the city.  Politicians and activists in New York and other cities have now taken aim at “broken windows” policing. This police strategy has shown remarkable success over the past two decades by targeting low-level public-order offenses, reducing the air of lawlessness in rough neighborhoods and getting criminals off the streets before they commit bigger crimes. Opponents of broken-windows policing somehow fail to notice that law-abiding residents of poor communities are among the strongest advocates for enforcing laws against public drinking, trespassing, drug sales and drug use, among other public-order laws.  As attorney general, Eric Holder pressed the cause of ending “mass incarceration” on racial grounds; elected officials across the political spectrum have jumped on board. A 2014 California voter initiative has retroactively downgraded a range of property and drug felonies to misdemeanors, including forcible theft of guns, purses and laptops. More than 3,000 felons have already been released from California prisons, according to the Association of Deputy District Attorneys in Los Angeles County. Burglary, larceny and car theft have surged in the county, the association reports.  “There are no real consequences for committing property crimes anymore,” Los Angeles Police Lt. Armando Munoz told Downtown News earlier this month, “and the criminals know this.” The Milwaukee district attorney, John Chisholm, is diverting many property and drug criminals to rehabilitation programs to reduce the number of blacks in Wisconsin prisons; critics see the rise in Milwaukee crime as one result.  If these decriminalization and deincarceration policies backfire, the people most harmed will be their supposed beneficiaries: blacks, since they are disproportionately victimized by crime. The black death-by-homicide rate is six times higher than that of whites and Hispanics combined. The killers of those black homicide victims are overwhelmingly other black civilians, not the police. The police could end all use of lethal force tomorrow and it would have at most a negligible impact on the black death rate. In any case, the strongest predictor of whether a police officer uses force is whether a suspect resists arrest, not the suspect’s race."

Georgia,38hogi,eastcoastian,4,Thu Jun 4 11:22:23 2015 UTC,"Uber is fantastic in Atlanta. There is also Marta but the trains don't go far outside of the city.

Georgia,38a3cd,johnny420black,3,Tue Jun 2 23:55:21 2015 UTC,"It's a really tough spot for students to be in right now, and it's probably going to get worse before it gets better.  The best thing most students can probably do right now is apply to state schools, live at home if possible, and work part-time while studying.  It's not the fun ""college experience"" the movies try to sell you on, but you can get pretty much the same thing by moving into an apartment with some friends and buying a keg-orator.  It's not worth the debt or the hassle of dealing with lenders, the bursar's office, etc.    It's also tough on the adjuncts and grad students who end up doing most of the teaching, too - they get paid absolute crap, with crummy (if any) benefits, and if they're in the humanities, they get dumped into a terrible job market full of other over-indebted would-be scholars with nothing more to show for it than a lot of jargon and an inflated sense of self-importance (which will make their crippling poverty all the more difficult to bear).    So I really feel for students these days, and for a lot of the grad students and adjuncts.  But this chick?  She's an utter disgrace to the profession.    First of all, there's the format: freaking PREZI?  Prezi is the new Powerpoint, and sadly, for the first half of it, she uses it like idiots used to use Powerpoint: just transferring her entire written text instead of summarizing, highlighting, or otherwise condensing material in a way appropriate to the medium.  Eventually she gets around to throwing in some bullet points and subtitles here and there, but this already looks like the slapdash work of a college freshman trying to meet a last-minute deadline for an assignment.    Secondly, there's the simply atrocious composition (""I would think such figures to be a mark of enormous pride and positive headline making for UNG"") and the pathetic attempt to include pop-culture catch-phrases (""Because I'm All About Those Books"").  And the analogies, God help us, the analogies:    not having enough money is a bit like not having enough oxygen.  It's uncomfortable, and to ignore the discomfort would be foolish, bordering on criminal negligence.    the American myth still lingers heavily like bad perfume in a cramped elevator     I can only assume that she was forced to get an English degree because the Creative Writing department kicked her out.    She's also failed to do even a modicum of research about student attitudes, relying on anecdotes  (""my own students said they wouldn't use the shuttle service""), and complete speculation (""and I suspect the Dahlonega students won't use it either"").  Many of the questions she raises could be answered with a phone call to the registrar (will someone commuting to a different campus for only one class be charged at that campus tuition, or their main campus rate?) or Nelnet (do they charge interest?)    She also uses the word ""reify"" incorrectly, which shows her to be both pretentious and ignorant of her very academic discipline's jargon (increasing tuition rates may amplify the ""mythic allure and promise of a bachelor’s degree,"" but it will not reify it).    I am 100% sympathetic to this woman's concerns, but I cannot help but feel utter embarrassment on her behalf.  She's a college composition instructor and she's written something that I would mark as a C- if one of my students submitted it.    OP, I'm sorry you didn't get a better teacher - you certainly deserve better."
Georgia,38a3cd,princeimrahil,4,Wed Jun 3 02:09:52 2015 UTC,"Another major issue with the University System right now: consolidations. Turning a community college (Gainesville State) and a decently well respected university (NGCSU) into the ""same"" school (UNG).   As evidenced by this professor's post, and testimonials that I have heard from my fellow students who transferred away from Dahlonega for the cheaper tuition; the quality of the professors and the instruction received by the students at the Dahlonega campus is far beyond that of the professors at the other campuses (Gainesville, Oconee, Cumming). Yet somehow students from all campuses get the same degree.   So this brings up a choice for me and many others:  Option 1: Stay at the Dahlonega campus that we fell in love with, pay higher tuition and fees, work significantly harder on our coursework, and get a degree that we are proud of.  Option 2: Transfer to another campus, pay less money, take easier courses, get the ""same"" degree.  I can't help but feel like this consolidation has cheapened the degree that I will earn from this institution. I'm also still a little bitter about the fact that I applied to, got accepted to, and started school at North Georgia College and State University; but will be finishing my schooling at the University of North Georgia having had no say in the matter. I can't help but feel like it will be very similar with other consolidations in the future.  tl;dr completely off topic rant about consolidations brought on by the fact that this was a poorly pieced together presentation by a professor at UNG's Gainesville campus."

The quote is from a guy named William Norman Grigg, and is specifically his sensationalized interpretation on the sheriff's office's defense, citing this court document, This is the only part of the entire document that could be construed to to mean anything remotely similar to what this article quotes from Grigg.   Plaintiffs' damages, if any, resulted solely from the voluntary and intentional conduct of plaintiffs or others and not from any conduct of these defendants or those over whom these defendants had any control.  Plaintiffs' damages, if any, were caused by the independent acts and decisions of persons and entities other than these defendants or those over whom these defendants had some legal right of control.  To the extent as may be shown by the evidence through discovery, these defendants show that plaintiffs' damages, if any, were directly and proximately caused by the contributory and comparative negligence of plaintiffs and their failure to exercise ordinary care.  To the extent as may be shown by the evidence through discovery, plaintiffs' injuries and damages, if any, were caused by the deliberate, criminal conduct of  plaintiffs, and such criminal conduct supersedes any and all negligence or liability,if any, on the part of these defendants.   Basically, the portions of the Sheriff's Office's defense claim that any damage caused was the fault of the plaintiffs, not the infant. Anyone who reads this and comes to the conclusion that they're blaming the infant for being in his playpen is delusional or trying to stir controversy.   Grigg is nothing more than an ultra conservative nut job with a very clearly sensationalized anti-police blog and multiple books about the UN's ""crusade against god"" and ""Campaign to disarm Americans"" and his quote holds absolutely no value whatsoever."

Georgia,37db2p,taykaz,5,Tue May 26 20:06:50 2015 UTC,"IMO stone Mountain is always a must. As for Senoia, I live about 20 miles from there(same County), it's a cute little town and they have a WD gift shop, but I don't think there's much else to see there. You may be able to find a tour guide for places to see though. There is alot of filming done here.  Grantville, also in the same County, is where Rick finds Morgan all holed up and crazy. I used to drive on one of the roads that was filmed on for one scene. It's a beautiful County, but Idk if there's alot to see,WD related that is. Senoia is back to regular open shops and such right now I believe, so it'll look like just a regular cute little town. If you watched Top Gear US or Lost in Transmission on history channel, the host Rutledge Wood lives there and his mom has a little Cafe. I don't mean to discourage you, hopefully someone can give you a better idea for a route to take that is entertaining.

Georgia,36nmd7,LieutenantJesus,2,Wed May 20 22:19:14 2015 UTC,"To pay for more road and bridge projects. However, it's not as drastic as he's saying. It used to be a 7.5 cent excise tax + 7% sales tax, and now its instead a 26 cent excise tax per gallon (instead of both of those taxes). In addition, there's a $5 per night hotel fee (which is stupid), a $200/year electric vehicle fee (which is far too high), the elimination of the EV tax credit, and the elimination of a tax credit that Delta really wanted that helped them weather high fuel prices. All told, $900m in new revenue for infrastructure."

Georgia,36nmd7,LieutenantJesus,5,Thu May 21 02:08:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah. It infuriates me to no end. The logic is that people who drive EVs don't contribute to the road funds, but $200 is higher than someone driving a gas guzzler 15000 miles a year would pay in gas taxes. Most lobbying will be to drop it to around $100, which is more reasonable and what other states have done.  Really makes me sad to see us go one step forward and then two back.

My guess is that they couldn't both give Tesla the right for direct sales AND have such a generous tax credit, although apparently a lot of people also abused the tax credit to get a lease on a Nissan Leaf for like $100/month. To which I say just make that impossible, not remove the credit. Or remove it in stages over several years. There were just a lot of better ways to handle it.

Georgia,36nmd7,NinjaKlaus,2,Thu May 21 02:31:21 2015 UTC,One thing you have to remember is that most of the electric vehicles you see on the road are leased. The people driving them are not going to be buying them when that lease runs out so those cars are likely going to be distributed throughout the country.
Georgia,36nmd7,vreddy92,1 point,Thu May 21 10:25:20 2015 UTC,"The average driver fills up a tank once a week because so many of us decide or need to live outside our work area. Somebody driving a 2004 Dodge Ram would get around 12mpg and have a 26 gallon tank. At 29.2 cents a gallon that would work out to 363.69 a year in gas taxes. Obviously for somebody in a Honda Accord that would be probably 100-150 a year which is more in line with what I think Electrics should pay. Considering their extremely low mileage range though I'd say they should get a cut and only be required to pay 75-100.   I am not planning to get a car anytime soon, but I've always loved the idea of getting one of those Leaf, Volt or similar offerings next time around, without the credit and with the yearly fee it'd be better to just get a hybrid Prius or the like and that sucks for everybody and more so for those that don't do well with bad air quality.

Georgia,36evcr,patasaurusrex,1 point,Tue May 19 00:25:51 2015 UTC,"Tybee is great. The trolley tours are jam-packed with great history (you check in for the best tours at the historic train station I think). River Street has a lot of talented artists peddling their wares (often students from SCAD), downtown has lovely live entertainment, and they have a plethora of great restaurants all around the city.  I personally love going to Wet Willie's on River Street and getting a nice relaxing alcoholic icee before taking a stroll through River Street/downtown/the lovely parks and squares scattered throughout the city. There are a lot of old homes you can take tours of, many of which have been converted into museums, and the Telfair Museum often has great art exhibits.  It's often said to be the most haunted city in America, but my experience with the haunted tours has mostly ended up with some funny entertainment mixed with quality history information, which is just fine by me. I'm sure there are much spookier tours than the ones I've been on, so you'd have to ask around about which are the best for history and which are the best for being spooked.  There's a lot to do in Savannah, which is famous for its exemplary ""Southern hospitality"" and festive culture. There are some rough parts in lower income areas but I've never felt as though I were in danger at any point in my time in the city; you just gotta know where to go to stay safe."

Georgia,35s3r0,dp44,14,Wed May 13 01:19:44 2015 UTC,"Directly from a state trooper, I was told the same thing. If you haven't applied for the tag, just keep your documents close and drive without a tag until you can get one. If you put a ""tag applied for"" tag on it and they run the VIN and see that it really isn't, they will start to suspect other things. Besides, ""Tag Applied For"" isn't considered a legal tag in GA anymore, since they went to the ""dealer Tags"" system some years back."
Georgia,35s3r0,Shadoe17,7,Wed May 13 10:28:51 2015 UTC,"Yes, just keep all of your paperwork in the car with you and you will be fine."
Georgia,35s3r0,lalax1,2,Wed May 13 01:42:19 2015 UTC,"I'm not a lawyer or expert on this in any means, but to my knowledge you would be wise to not drive until you at least have the title. It is not legal to drive without a tag that has been applied for. You said your application for a tag was rejected. Proof of sale is not the same as having the title. If you bought it from a dealer you'd have a legal dealer temporary tag, but in this situation you have no such thing. You will almost certainly get ticketed for this if a cop sees you. Whether or not the ticket is valid would be something you'd have to go to court to prove, and I'm guessing that's not worth your time.  Keep in mind that a tag is proof that you have paid, or in the case of a temporary tag, that you intend to pay taxes. You have no proof of that so even though you have proof you own the car, you have no proof of your intent to pay the tax required to drive one.  Also, even when you get the title you still need to get a temporary tag. Even with the title I don't think you'd get yourself out of a ticket."

I realize you got rebuffed your first time, but go back and try to talk to a different person.  You may be able to get them to write a letter saying you tried to get a tag on 5/13/15 but was unable to due to the fact that the title hasn't been released from the leinholder yet."

Instead, law enforcement officers and other state employees are able to electronically verify the insurance status for any vehicle that is registered in Georgia using the Georgia Electronic Insurance Compliance System (GEICS).

You'll need to keep a copy of the signed over title or bill of sale and insurance information.  Check your insurance policy for your specific details, but many of them cover liability insurance for newly purchased cars for a set period of time (I believe mine was two weeks).  If you can't find the details in your policy just call the company and ask, they're usually very helpful here because most people buy more expensive cars than they're currently driving so they know your rates will be going up.  Also, just be prepared to be pulled over a lot.  And don't expect the cops to know what the laws are either.  Just explain everything slowly and remain calm."

We know next to nothing about the TPP aside from a few leaks that have reached us. Fast tracking allows it to bypass Congress (and citizens), meaning no oversight, no public scrutiny, bam, it's done, we're stuck with it.  The other big thing is that the TPP essentially gives affected multinational corporations the power to bypass and even supersede national laws. Participating nations will, by agreement of the TPP, alter their policies to conform to the trade agreement. Violators(countries) can be brought before a tribunal(the trade corporations) which operates outside of national law, making us subject to that law. Some examples would be food safety regulations, the minimum wage, and the ability to promote ""buy local"" initiatives.  But aside from that is the simple fact that trade agreements have historically been a bad thing for us. They promise boons for consumers but ultimately cost jobs and add to the national deficit.

Georgia,35a5ig,DataSetMatch,1 point,Fri May 8 16:23:49 2015 UTC,"yeah, like I said, that article succeeded in getting a trip there on my to do list."
Georgia,35a5ig,Rulother,7,Fri May 8 16:32:44 2015 UTC,"I have disagree with some of the items being on this list. Marietta Diner, place has a ton of variety but the food isn't the greatest by any means. Also, El Rinconcito in Statesboro? One thing about statesboro is that it does have a lot of Mexican restaurants, but I definitely wouldn't say this place is the best. Eagle Diner is a better choice. Really this list looks like someone traveled to a bunch of places, mainly BBQ up and down the east side of Georgia. There are just so many restaurants that could of made this list but nothing.."
Georgia,35a5ig,dawgflymd,4,Fri May 8 16:01:38 2015 UTC,"BTW, Eagle Diner doesn't exist anymore, I'm not even sure where that used to be and I've been here for three years. Rinconcito isn't much anymore, as El Sombrero has three locations now and seemingly part of the lore of the town (el Jalapenos is quickly becoming big, too).  I agree with Marietta Diner, though. I grew up by it and it's always been.. rather disappointing in the quality of their meals."
Georgia,35a5ig,Rulother,3,Fri May 8 16:33:43 2015 UTC,"Ah I forgot they changed their name to Wings Cafe, it's been a while. While I attended GSU, El Som was kinda the spot to go. Mainly for cheap drinks and the food wasn't too bad either."
Georgia,35a5ig,dawgflymd,4,Fri May 8 16:38:48 2015 UTC,"Wings Cafe is gone, too. New Zaxbys opened up in the parking lot next to it as an ode to their original store.  El Som is definitely still the spot, not sure when you left but they have a two story restaurant over by the big Walmart (we have two now, grocery store and regular) in addition to the other two. I don't think they'll go away any time soon, luckily"
Georgia,35a5ig,Rulother,3,Fri May 8 16:43:06 2015 UTC,"Dammit no more Wings Cafe!? Tell me Stickies is still there too. Yeah when I left 2008, they had just finished the new El Som. If you've never been to Stickies, I highly recommend it."
Georgia,35a5ig,dawgflymd,3,Fri May 8 16:59:47 2015 UTC,"Ready to be disappointed? They're not even showing up on Google, I'm guessing they've been gone for a while now. We have Buffalo Wild Wings and Wild Wings Cafe, both chains, that are kind of dominating the wing scene here now. We have GATAs, which is Buffalo Cafe (if you're familiar with hwy 92 in woodstock), but it's not too popular for wings. Not too many local places left standing anymore lol.  The plaza is pretty much gone too, now. Retrievers, now Shenanigans, is up for sale, Rums closed a few weekends back, and Rudys has been shut down since Gatto died. Tavern is the only one still standing, but that's only a matter of time. The entire plaza is up for sale for a cool 5.5 million."
Georgia,35a5ig,Rulother,2,Fri May 8 18:03:26 2015 UTC,"I knew about the plaza going belly up, which is a shame as I did enjoy Retrievers. Is Oriental Express still there? Tell me Dos is still there, next to Shenanigans. So I resorted to streetview on Fair and it looks like CVS is now in the spot Sticky used to be. But it looks like the Mill House and Chop on Main is still there, good options too."
Georgia,35a5ig,hipstershatehipsters,2,Fri May 8 19:02:27 2015 UTC,Dos is now a burger place
Georgia,35a5ig,Tensuke,2,Sat May 9 00:03:29 2015 UTC,"I saw an Oriental Express delivery guy a few days ago so I'd say it's still there, for now. Shit, this place has changed so much in the last 4 years, I can't imagine what it was like 8, 10, 15 years ago."
Georgia,35a5ig,idratherbehiking,3,Sat May 9 02:03:03 2015 UTC,"I'd say El Rinc has more authentic food and the atmosphere is pretty unique especially with the store in it, but it's by no means a top 12 restaurant in GA. You're right El Som has got Statesboro on lock through with good cheap food and cheap drinks."
Georgia,35a5ig,DataSetMatch,1 point,Fri May 8 17:30:18 2015 UTC,"If anything, this article made me want to go to St Simon island.  I have not been there yet."

Georgia,35a5ig,disassterbate,3,Fri May 8 16:26:40 2015 UTC,I love Barbara Jean's crab cakes and corn bread. We always have eat there at least once and climb the light house when we go down there.
Georgia,35a5ig,nope_nic_tesla,2,Fri May 8 20:27:03 2015 UTC,"Agree with the other poster that Sal's is overrated, but strongly disagree that Barbara Jean's is all you need to know for SSI! If you go, try Palmer's, Pranzo, Beachcombers (best burgers on the island), and the raw oysters at Catch 228.  There's also a new Thai place and a new Italian/Argentinian place I hear are good but I haven't given them a try yet."

Georgia,35a5ig,nope_nic_tesla,2,Fri May 8 16:46:01 2015 UTC,I've been to Marietta Diner since it is local to me.  The desserts are worth the trip.
Georgia,35a5ig,mrpunaway,2,Fri May 8 15:53:05 2015 UTC,"There are diners that are around me too though. I'm wondering how vastly different it could be from the Georgia Diner that it would be a ""unique"" experience."
Georgia,35a5ig,Countingfrog,3,Fri May 8 16:18:20 2015 UTC,"They went all out on the exterior build out - so I guess that should count for something.  And open 24/7 in Marietta is a thing.  Heck, try to shop on the square on a weeknight or eat late at anytime on the square."
Georgia,35a5ig,lmp515k,3,Fri May 8 16:34:22 2015 UTC,"I can see how the Marietta Diner would be ""unforgettable"" based on the style and decor, even if the food isn't exceptional."
