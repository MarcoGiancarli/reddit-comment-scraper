For a full year, at the end of every quarter, I would stop by and ask if there were positions open for the next quarter.

If you don't meet that, then there is Rural/metro, a for profit large agency that runs the city jobs (10-20 trucks staffed), you need to be an EMT and 18+.

I simply talked to my advisor during one of my visits and asked him what openings thwre were for students. He recommended going around to different advising offices and apply.  After that meeting i walked to gccis and asked the IST office if they needed help with office work. They did and took me in without an interview.   Moral of the story is make sure you apply early and go in person. Walk around to any of the advising offices and ask if they need help. Most offices will hire a student or two. The one i happened to work in gave me about 10 hours a week strewn about 6 students. This definitely beats working at gracies or ritz.  Also, Resnet and Desktop Support are always looking for new hires. It is a more demanding job however requiring a bit of background with IT.

I think the school has resources for these grills as well but my memory is foggy.  While living in UC I was once cited (warning, by fire inspectors) for lighter fluid we had in our pantry, so grill supplies are no good.  I also recall seeing someones personal propane grill bike-locked to something outside (might have been the charcoal grills?), in case you want your own grill but, as /u/ghostofrit said, you can't store it outside."
rit,3dymq1,RyanCacophony,6,Mon Jul 20 16:56:39 2015 UTC,"Short piece of history from an old guy...  Those ""charcoal grills"" used to be propane grills when UC was first built (2004?).  Facilities would have to turn them off in the Winter and back on in the Spring (I assume due to the snow / winter).  So the first nice day, many people would just dump charcoal and immediately ruin them  since Facility could never turn them on in time.  So, about ~2005 or 2006 they replaced them with the typical ""park"" charcoal grills.  Most still had the propane line capped off and the shutoff sticking up about 1' out of the ground right next to the ""new"" charcoal grills.  Not sure if those are still there these days.  Admittedly... that was YEARS ago now...  I'll go back to my rocking chair on the porch now.  Edit: Yep, I can see the shutoffs are still there, right there next to the garbage can.

rit,3e1adt,devwolfie,4,Tue Jul 21 05:02:29 2015 UTC,"I had Bautista for differential equations back in quarters (also prior to +/- grading), and had several other encounters with him afterwards, so I know him pretty well. While I personally enjoyed and appreciated him as a professor, the general consensus is that he is not the friendliest professor out there.  He has this very seemingly antagonizing attitude towards students that pretend to know their stuff, i.e. he will call you out if you don't know what you are talking about. This leads to students being afraid to ask questions or even feels ridiculed by him because they don't want to be wrong. Honestly though, if you put down your pride and ask for clarification, you will have no problem in his class.  As for grading wise, 85% was the cutoff between A and B when I was in his class. Not sure what the cutoffs are for +/-. It isn't necessary since plenty of people got above 90% but it certainly helps. There was weekly quizzes which was nice to check if you understand something so you won't get completely blindsided during exams. Homework is worth very little, it's mostly the practice it provides that's beneficial.  Note that with 181 being a workshop based class, he might be a bit friendlier or not depending on how that goes (if he shows up to the workshops at all, he probably does).  All in all, his brutally honest attitude worked out great for me. I learned a tremendous amount from him, especially looking back at it now and comparing my knowledge with my peers that had other professors.  TL;DR: if you don't mind Bautista's bad rep due to his seemingly not so friendly attitude, you will learn a lot from him."
rit,3e1adt,zachcarmichael,2,Tue Jul 21 09:50:45 2015 UTC,"I had him for MultiVar and another course later on. My experience is he will focus on the theory, proofs, etc. more so than examples (that's what homework is for). He can be condescending but in my experience, it was only because people didn't understand the basics from previous courses that were necessary to do what we were doing. I can't fault him for that.   Even in the cases of him having to go back to explain fundamental concepts, he may make comments about it, but IMO he really does want you to know it and will take the time to re-teach it if he can.  I agree that you can learn a lot. Just need to put in the work (as every class is expecting you to do)."

rit,3duvxa,boner79,3,Tue Jul 21 04:31:11 2015 UTC,"Frontier can go fuck themselves. As if advertising 6Mbps down as ""high speed internet"" in 2015 isn't insulting enough, their monopoly in the Rochester area is the reason why Verizon Fios never came here.  Greenlight can't build out fast enough."
rit,3duvxa,Snowflare182,2,Mon Jul 20 03:24:31 2015 UTC,"Yep, having just finished hunting for and subsequently buying a house, that annoys me deeply about residential internet in the US in general.  It's almost like some kind of weird generation gap thing - our first realtor was an older (60-70's) guy, and it took a good half-dozen or so houses before he stopped trying to convince us that 3 meg DSL, satellite net, etc. would be adequate.  Anyway, to stay slightly more on topic - I spent my last couple RIT years off-campus, and we had TWC for internet. I think there was one time that we had an outage of a day or two, beyond that I can't remember any significant issues. By contrast, the Frontier phone service was godawful, horrible customer service, bad call quality, billing incompetence, etc. I can't imagine their internet service is any better."
rit,3duvxa,paperboat22,2,Mon Jul 20 16:39:40 2015 UTC,Greenlight fiber is by far the best if you live somewhere that they cover. Here's a compilation map of their coverage as of about 3 months ago.

rit,3dro2l,mr_lctnstn,3,Sat Jul 18 20:21:40 2015 UTC,You are correct; we are assigned 2 /48 blocks.  But IPv6 is not available throughout the campus just yet. Still more work to do. See my other response.  -tony

Not sure if our DHCP servers are setup for IPv6 yet, though they do have IPv6 addresses themselves. :)  Many edge subnets do not have IPv6 addresses assigned so SLAAC will not work.  -tony  EDIT: retraction of IPv6 on DHCP servers.

rit,3dro2l,ITS-Clay,2,Mon Jul 20 17:17:22 2015 UTC,You would think after running dry on ipv4 they'd be smarter about the ipv6 allocation instead of giving us 2*1620 addresses. That's 2418862640240268460422462 addresses (I think I mathed that right)
rit,3dro2l,MadLibz,0,Sat Jul 18 23:39:53 2015 UTC,"There are a grand total of 340 undecillion possible IPv6 addresses compared to a total of 4.3 billion possible IPv4 addresses. That's a growth factor of 79 octillion.   In slightly easier to digest numbers we went from 4.3 billion to 340 trillion trillion trillion, or a growth factor of 79 billion billion billion."
rit,3dro2l,mr_lctnstn,3,Sun Jul 19 00:10:35 2015 UTC,"But do you really think RIT will ever need 2418862640240268460422462 addresses? I'm sure that's the same thing they said about 65025 addresses, but why over allocate blocks already?"
rit,3dro2l,MadLibz,2,Sun Jul 19 00:30:17 2015 UTC,"Call me when there's 281,474,976,710,656 RIT-sized institutions."
rit,3dro2l,hoopycat,1 point,Sun Jul 19 12:03:16 2015 UTC,But not all organizations are RIT sized. The DoD has a /13. I'm not even going to do the math on that.
rit,3dro2l,MadLibz,4,Sun Jul 19 14:33:31 2015 UTC,"Easy.  213 = 8192.  The rules of thumb: least-significant 64 bits are the interface identifier (aka host address), next most-significant N bits are the subnet identifier, and the remaining 64-N bits are the routing prefix.  That gives 51 bits for subnet identifier within the DoD allocation, and each level of the bureaucracy is going to take at least 1 bit.  :-)  RIT's allocation of a /48 provides 16 bits for subnet identifier, or 65536 subnets.  In an ISP environment, where each end-user gets a single IPv4 address which they're expected to NAT a subnet to, an IPv6 allocation of /48 is equivalent to an IPv4 allocation of /16.  So, /48 is totally reasonable.  Why allocate such large chunks of space by default?  In part, because of routing tables.  To use the TWC example, 2604:6000::/32 covers most of NYS, and is announced by AS11351.  There is virtually no chance this will fill up: even if every single customer router asked for a /56 (which they can do), that's 16.8 million customers.  This is originated as one prefix for all residential customers.  (There's another block for commercial customers, and there are a growing number of more-specific prefixes originated out of this for customers who couldn't do multi-homing with IPv4 but can with IPv6.)  By comparison, AS11351 originates 216 prefixes for a total of 5.1 million IPv4 addresses, the equivalent of a /9 or so.  All other things being equal, if we had been able to allocate TWC an entire IPv4 /8 for NYS instead of incrementally allocating them an /18 here, a /21 there, perhaps a /15 once in awhile, etc, BGP tables would be noticeably lighter.  But we couldn't, and now we have this baggage on our BGP tables.  This mistake is not being made with IPv6."

rit,3dro2l,MadLibz,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:04:01 2015 UTC,"They actually only have 22 /22s, which is still an oddly large amount but it's not a /13."
rit,3dro2l,Dagger0,0,Sun Jul 19 20:48:49 2015 UTC,"We have already exhausted our IPv4 block. Just do some math really fast...  18,000 students on campus * 2 devices each (minimum of a smart phone and laptop) = 36000 devices  Approximately 3,500 employees at RIT, assuming 1.5 devices per person = 5250  Running total: 41250  Factor in all of the servers and computer labs and you can easily get close to the 65,534 total usable addresses in a /16 network.   If you start considering all of the printers on campus that have public IPs and students/faculty with more than 2 devices and you can see how our campus can/has exhausted a /16 address space.     Also, IPv6 addresses can be configured differently than IPv4. RIT can either use DHCPv6 or SLAAC [stateless auto address configuration] where the last 64 bits of a host address are a computed value derived from the device's MAC address."
rit,3dro2l,mr_lctnstn,2,Sun Jul 19 02:02:31 2015 UTC,"We've made some changes over the past 5 years to help deal with our limited space:   A segment of wireless devices have been moved to NAT (While we don't like using NAT, this is a space we can since most mobile devices can handle NAT without impact.) Guest wireless uses NAT Short lease times for wireless devices which allows us to re-use addresses more quickly Hosts that don't need off-campus access, such as database servers, printers, and network devices, have been moved to 10.0.0.0/8 space Large subnets (supernets) on wireless to reduce the number of addresses used by non-user devices Reclaim and reallocate subnets that are under-utilized   These changes have kept us from running out of IP addresses while we, and the rest of the world, work on getting IPv6 going."

One looks to be part of Internet2 space while the other will most likely be what is deployed throughout campus.  As it stands, the network is ready for IPv6. We have it enabled and addresses assigned on certain nets, mostly server and testing subnets; nothing going out to the general campus yet. As u/white-forest has shown, connectivity works if you are on an IPv6 enabled subnet, but there are many more moving parts that need to come together before it can be deployed.  With IPv4, there are many systems that work together to assign and manage our IP space. I do not have an answer regarding how that will transition to IPv6. Not to mention they are various aspects of the network that need to be figured out as well, such as quarantining, NAT space, etc, etc.  In short, we have some work to do before the general campus is IPv6 ready.  -tony"

rit,3dlhft,thinkablepatter,4,Fri Jul 17 11:07:57 2015 UTC,"Haven't been to RIT since '11 but wanted to mention that while I'd expect decent coverage in town, going outside of town you may hit dead zones.  I had T-Mobile all through college, switched to Verizon for several years, and then switched back. I switched away from Verizon because I disagree with their business policies regarding Android devices. Actually I went from Verizon to Sprint but I only lasted like 2 months.   This isn't nearly as big of a problem today as it was before. Years ago losing data meant your current Google Navigation trip would stop updating, now it caches things better and I know in the past you could even manually cache road areas you knew you'd need frequently.  I traveled between RIT and Pittsburgh (hometown) which is why I mention it. I'd drop phonecalls in certain locations, though it was very brief. Currently I drive from Pittsburgh to Virginia about once a month and there is a spot where I lose all signal for several minutes where nothing is really around. (Also lots of valleys and hills. Much harder on signal strength)  So just keep this in mind for your needs. Personally I advocate T-Mobile, but if you're going to be frequently outside populated areas then you may encounter issues. If you anticipate that any Co-Ops or job opportunities that you might get may have you traveling to job sites away from cities (as some engineering positions will do) then that may be an issue in the future.  Btw, currently on 22.2 GB of usage after 20 days into this month. Hitting 40GB+ is not uncommon for me for a month. I don't get throttled. I watch twitch on my phone at High setting, very pleasant. Also if you need tethering (since tethering is capped on T-Mobile) then check out this app on android. It requires root but it can give you unlimited tethering. Dev does a great job keeping things updated and tells you what phone settings to change to get around the cap."

If you dont go off campus and you dont do any internet shopping, you're not going to spend a ton of money. If you do those things you'll spend a lot of money, it's all about your spending habits."

rit,3dim7w,Sundeiru,3,Thu Jul 16 16:42:23 2015 UTC,"Clubs often have dues, though not every club does.  Some campus events do have a cost, but there is a lot of free stuff that happens too. The amount of money you spend on those things is entirely up to you."
rit,3dim7w,zoopityzoppity,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:15:29 2015 UTC,"adding to this, start looking for a job now. Most places on campus want to hire a freshman so they can keep you on for 4 years. The competition is insane in August/September too, and I saw a lot of people give up and quit the search after sending in a few applications with no response"
rit,3dim7w,Th3e_KuRs,3,Thu Jul 16 19:13:26 2015 UTC,"I saw the complete opposite of this, I know plenty of kids that pretty much just walked up at any point and got a job at any point in the year. You don't need to stress about getting a job you just need to make sure you can handle it on top of your studies. It also depends on the job you want, everyone wants a job at the gym so its not as easy as getting a job at Ritz."

No catch, no getting religion shoved onto you. You can use it as an opportunity to meet new people or you can use it to fill your belly and leave. There is no deal like it on campus. It's easily $20 per month that you don't have to use on your meal plan that frees up some cash for vending machines or one giant rice crispy treat."
rit,3dim7w,Dej28,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:12:16 2015 UTC,"Just giving you a heads up, the 10+ meal plan had me run out of meals about halfway through the week, and I was out of debit by November.   If you're an athlete that eats a lot (or if you're fat and eat a lot) that might not be enough food for you, it wasn't for me and I'm not a huge guy. I had to supplement myself with ~100 bucks a week into my debit to be able to feed myself.   Your results may vary, but yeah."
rit,3dim7w,Mkrah,3,Thu Jul 16 16:47:23 2015 UTC,"So if I plan on eating a lot, should I maybe change my plan? Also where did you buy stuff once you ran out of debit?"
rit,3dim7w,lmg6841,8,Thu Jul 16 16:56:57 2015 UTC,"Definitely do not change your meal plan. 10+ is the best for everyone, even if they eat a lot or a little. You should only change your plan if you really like Gracie's (unlikely) AND plan on spending every day there eating as much as you can. I ate a lot of food at RIT and still had ~200 left in debit by the last 2 weeks of classes."
rit,3dim7w,Dej28,3,Thu Jul 16 18:17:55 2015 UTC,You can always add money onto your debit or Tiger Bucks account. The advantage to that is that it's sales tax exempt for food purchases on campus... but you can always just use cash to buy things around campus.   ....  Or you can buy things at grocery stores like ramen or cereal as other meal supplements.

It'll probably be similar. I'd try to save as much money as I could now, and get a part time job when you get here. I mean, you're not gonna sit in your dorm all the time doing nothing, right?  You probably want $40 or so in spending money per week at a minimum. Even if you live as frugally as possible, sometimes things come up, too."

I didn't spend much money on food at all, other than some breakfast cereal and other snacks at Wegmans (which you could also buy at the corner store, but thats harder to do when you don't have all debit). Its good to have spending money for when you go off campus and whatnot.  You won't be spending thousands, but having cereal hundred for the semester set aside just to keep yourself sane and able to go off campus to do things (and to buy school supplies and books should you need them).  I don't remember exactly how much I spent first semester but it wasn't much- I didn't have a car, and I didn't have friends that had cars, and I didn't really care enough about things to spend money on. Second semester I spent more because I had a paycheck, so I could buy myself little things and whatnot."

RIT has a lot of clubs and resources along with the big tech companies that come looking to hire, it's certainly not looked down upon. Regardless of where you go if you don't go to major related clubs (Amatuer radio club for me, lots of electronics projects outside of class) and don't do above and beyond extra curricular you're then banking on basically the school name to help you.  Use the school to learn and get a heads up, those entry level jobs require 3 years experience because big name hot companies expect you to intern, build projects, leads teams... Everyone did circuits 1, make yourself different!  I work at a major commercial rocket company as an R&D design engineer right out of school, you can guess which one. I'm certainly NOT the only RIT grad here. Don't fall into the trap thinking the school determines your outcome, rpi and rit are so close if you're caring then you're looking at it wrong."
rit,3dfcb8,ghostofrit,4,Thu Jul 16 05:11:00 2015 UTC,You should really post this in the RPI thread. Probably the best advice I've heard.
rit,3dfcb8,Qani,9,Thu Jul 16 05:19:11 2015 UTC,"I have been to both and I figure there is a few differences.   The Arts: RIT is well respected as an photography, art, craft, and design college. RPI, well, is not. If your going for anything art or design related (this includes game design and web design) I'm going to heavily recommend RIT. If your looking for something more core comp sci or engineering, than RIT and RPI are not that different.  The Focus: RIT is pretty career focuses while RPI is more grade focused. RIT requires things like co-ops or internships in order to graduate from many majors. RPI, on the other hand, does not. They are more interested in how you did academically. Both have job fairs. RIT seems to try to connect and help out their alum more than RPI though. The Location: RIT is in Henrietta, not Rochester, so it's more insular. This is great if you want the united college feel, but also means it's harder to get anywhere without a bus or car. RPI, on the other hand, is smack dab in the middle of Troy. This means it's much easier to walk to places (like the surprisingly hip and growing art district on the river), but also means higher crime rates on and surrounding the campus. (I think they still tell freshmen not to walk downtown alone because they will get jumped. Kinda alarmist, but has happened) There is also a middle and high school next to the college, so don't be surprised if they are hanging out in the union. The Gender Ratio: A lot of people talk about this, but really it's not that bad at either college. RIT seems to have a better ratio overall, but RPI is also very close to Russell Sage; a traditional women's college in downtown. You might not have the gender you are looking for in your classes, but if you are willing to go out and spend time at other colleges (both the internal type and literal other colleges like Russel Sage) you will be fine.  The Presidents: Everyone loves Destler, everyone loves to hate Shirley."

The 19th ward isn't a bad area per se, but it's not a good one either, and it is a decent hike from RIT. You might look at places just north of Jefferson Road in Brighton.

It's mostly lower income areas with a few pockets of college students. It's doable, but don't be surprised if you live there and have at least one contact with crime like getting mugged or something stolen.  Regarding biking, it's rough in the winter but there are a bunch of people who bike year round. It is definitely for the very dedicated and badassed biking people. It would be pretty damn hard but it isn't nearly as impossible as most people here on this thread are saying. I know of 2 people who frequent the subs above who bike year round, although one of them may have since moved out of state.  In most areas, unless you are 12 or under or accompanying someone who is 12 or under, it's illegal to ride on the sidewalk. I'm not sure how much that is enforced, but technically a bike is a vehicle and is supposed to be on the street."
rit,3dcjgc,Nargleflex,12,Wed Jul 15 16:12:41 2015 UTC,"I live a few blocks down from that area, deeper into the seedier part. It's not so bad so long as you don't mind getting asked if you smoke weed. Also don't go outside after dark without another person, just to be safe."
rit,3dcjgc,JimXugle,8,Wed Jul 15 05:17:39 2015 UTC,"I lived in the 19th ward at Genesee and Spruce for 2.5 years. During that time, I had people going through my garbage cans, my roommate's car was broken into no, there weren't valuables in the car, there was a carjacking in front of my house, but the straw that broke the camel's back was when the neighbors were subjected to an armed home invasion. If you can live with all of that, then by all means, live in the 19th ward.  As others have said, biking to campus year-round isn't feasible. Not only does it get cold, but there's lake effect wind and lake effect snow. The windchill regularly takes the effective temperature below zero. This type of cold kills multiple people every winter. In addition to that, there really isn't a good path for you to bike from the city down to campus: The Lehigh Valley Trail isn't cleared of snow in the winter and will most likely be impassable. Traffic on Scottsville Road regularly reaches 55MPH to 65MPH in between the lights, and snow regularly covers the road surface in the section next to the airport. In the few sections of that road that have a shoulder, the shoulder will most likely be packed with snow. If you live in the 19th ward, you'll need to keep your bike indoors, otherwise it'll get stolen.  The bus is doable, but it'll take you 90 minutes and a trip into downtown to get to campus.   I encourage you to look at different housing options, and highly recommend getting a car.  EDIT: Grammar"

rit,3dcjgc,white-forest,3,Wed Jul 15 12:12:46 2015 UTC,"As a person who legitimately grew up in the 19th Ward: It's not bad. For reference, I lived on Trafalgar St, which is behind the high school on Genesee St for 20 years.   The worst thing that has ever happened to my family was our sprinkler getting stolen. Once.  Typical safety things apply. Take your belongings inside, lock your doors, don't flaunt when you're going on vacation, have a light on somewhere if it's night time to ward off burglars.   I never went walking at night, but there really isn't anywhere to go in the area that late. Not really any bars or stores open. If I was out late, I was usually driving from RIT back home.   As plenty of others have said, a bike will not suffice during the harsh winters. Get a car. The bus system and the people on it can be sketchy to outright fear inducing, with numerous incidents occurring, though that might decline as the RCSD will no longer be using RTS buses for student transportation. That said, it's extremely time consuming, not at all like taking the trains in NYC or Chicago.  If you have any other questions, feel free to ask.

Safetywise...pretty sketchy north of Brooks, gray area between Brooks and Genesee, pretty decent between Genesee and Scottsville. I've heard the latter called the ""white coat ghetto"" on account of the grad students/doctors/faculty who live around there. It's a nicely diverse area, which I like--older folks who've lived there 25+ years (one of my neighbors has lived in his house since 1967), younger families with kids who play in the street, some college-age kids near the end of the block--and the park is pretty close by.   Shopping...well, the closest option is College Town by Strong, where they have Constantino's. It's your basic grocery store, a little overpriced but the selection is decent, very nice beer section, and kind of a lowest-common-denominator hot bar. The pastries are good, though. Other than that, there's Wal-Mart at the other end of Brooks Avenue, or the Tops near Elmwood & Clinton. If you're willing to go a little further, the Pittsford Wegmans is 15 minutes away by way of Elmwood and Monroe, and there's an older neighborhood one in, I think, Chili by way of 390 off Scottsville or Brooks."

You won't be able to bike on them for at least four months a year. You don't want to be riding down the Genessee Riverway Trail after dark, either, unless you're trying to get mugged. You'd be biking down Scottsville Rd for a substantial portion of the academic year, which is more of a highway than a road, that NYS decided to be assholes and put traffic lights and a 45 mph speed limit on to raise ticket revenue. I bike from Park Ave to RIT when the weather's nice, and I wouldn't ever bike down that street.   The 19th Ward is really hit or miss. I wouldn't live there. Some sections are fine, but you'll probably hear gunshots from time to time, and there's a good chance you'll get robbed at some point. Rochester is one of the most crime ridden cities in the country, and rent is really cheap here. Don't live in a dicey neighborhood to save a little bit of money on rent, is my advice, especially when you're not from the area.  As far as I know, you'd be shopping in Henrietta or College Town by U of R. Most businessowners don't set up shop in the hood."
rit,3dcjgc,itsnickk,3,Wed Jul 15 19:18:56 2015 UTC,"I lived in 2 or 3 different places around the ward. It can be shady at times but as long as you lock your doors when not home, do not leave valuables in your car, and bring your bike inside when not in use you'll be fine.  It gets a bad reputation but for cheap living it is great.   My only dislike was that it was not really near any major store(walmart, wegmans, tops etc.) None are close enough to shoot over to quickly."

My locked car sitting right next to hers wasn't touched. The same thing happens on campus. I jog, walk, and bike at night. None of my neighbors on my block have reported anything worse than that in the time that I've lived there. That being said, certain areas are nicer than others. North of Brooks Avenue the closer you get to Genesee Street, Chili Avenue, or Thurston Avenue the more likely you are to see crime. Go a few blocks away and you're back to being in family filled residential neighborhoods."

rit,3d2gw7,ActualMinimum,5,Mon Jul 13 00:09:36 2015 UTC,Hello fellow transfer student here!  Your housing has already been accept since you filled out your housing contract. But don't worry there is a chance to still move!  To answer your other questions:  If your assignment says TEMPORARY housing then the chances of you getting a different room (most likely the dorms or GV) is pretty high. They move students quickly during orientation and the first week of classes.  Though if it doesn't say temporary housing you will have to do more work. You can find people posting about housing options on the housing page on facebook. Give it like 2 weeks and there will most likely be a decent amount of people asking for roommates. You need to just keep up with checking.  Last year tons of my friends were stuck in the Inn and all of them got out before Thanksgiving. Just be proactive about looking and you will get out!
rit,3d2gw7,i_seediscontinuity,4,Mon Jul 13 01:29:37 2015 UTC,"I lived at the Inn for one entire semester and I would say, in terms of living, it is not bad. you get your own full size bed, tv, own bathroom. but only thing I didnt like was the commute. also I couldnt stay out late over the weekends, because shuttles stops at like 12. I had to find a place to crash somewhere on campus or have someone drive me back, which was pain the ass."
rit,3d2gw7,anuj530,7,Mon Jul 13 02:45:55 2015 UTC,"Honestly it's not that bad. There will almost always be an opening at some point but it won't necessarily be UC or GV as you wish - I'd keep your options open (Riverknoll, Colony, etc.) if you really don't want to stay there."
rit,3d2gw7,Pr3fix,3,Mon Jul 13 00:17:44 2015 UTC,"Not going to lie, I've had multiple friends tell me the Inn SUCKS as housing. It's usually where the overflow of transfers get placed.    Slim, but there's still hope that it'll work out.  'Temporary'. Meaning that usually people get assigned some dorm or other place after the first semester when people don't come back"
rit,3d2gw7,iRecycleWomen,2,Mon Jul 13 01:15:09 2015 UTC,"I was a transfer student in 2005 and I loved the RIT Inn. It is often temporary, but not always. I was initially placed in a single room temporarily on the first floor that opened up to the pool (Make use of the pool while the weather is still nice!) and I liked it so much that I requested to stay. Eventually I got a double on the second floor.   If you want UC, and don't get switched into it this year, then try what I did: make friends with people who live in UC and see if they can sign you into their apartment the next year."
rit,3d2gw7,Goose511th,5,Mon Jul 13 03:46:03 2015 UTC,"If you want my honest opinion: Forgo RIT housing completely. Look around rochester locally, get an apartment. You will overpay for any RIT housing for what you get (aside from fast internet)"

No. Easy and you don't have to worry about washing dishes in the lounge sink? Yes. The only time in the dorm I used my plates was to re-heat some leftovers or some pizza I got for free. I only used plates and stuff like three times. I used mugs and such for cereal and drinking out of.  There is about a month until move in. Take your closet and turn all your hangers the way you don't normally hang your clothes, and then take note as you start to pack for school which hangers are the right way- these are the clothes you routinely wear. Pack them, leave the rest, save for like 1 or 2 formal items (never know) and your winter clothes. If you don't hang your clothes, just make a mental note and be honest with yourself what you actually wear every day.  Bring power adapters, extension cords are not allowed. These kinds of lamps are not allowed, just so you know. I brought a desk light and two clippy lights like this from target, and they worked just fine for nighttime.   Please, please, pack less than you think you need- if you pack something ""just in case"", you probably don't need it. If you do need it, you can get it over the break or the next time you go home, and if you must you can buy something here. I was so pissed off at myself moving out because there was so much I didn't use. You really only need your basics.  Things that I wish I had freshman year: a first aid kit including things like NyQuil, sudafed, cough drops, other cold remedy stuff (I got a cold, didn't have a car, no fun riding on the bus to wegmans to get cold medicine). Kleenex is easy to forget, too, along with basic cleaning things (clorox wipes were used on my desk every once and a while, paper towels are good to have, one of those hand vacuums are nice to have for small things but not completely necessary- your RA will have a vacuum for the hall).  ProTip: Get two pairs of sheets- I found that I was more likely to change my sheets if I could just change them out whenever I thought of it, and didn't have to be at the mercy of actually getting my laundry finished and have the energy to make my bed by the time I was going to go to bed (but you guys did get new washer/driers, hopefully they're better). But some people are okay sleeping on the same sheets for a year (gag.) but hey to each your own. OH ALSO speaking of gross, bring shower shoes- might be less gross if you're in a suite space like Ellingson, but they were very good to have in Gleason.  Small games were good to have, especially when I was getting to know my new friends. I had cards against humanity, scatergories, and a deck of playing cards. Good things to break the ice, don't take up too much space, generally a good time.  sorry for the wall of text, just trying to be helpful!"

rit,3d2hgq,djh3315,3,Mon Jul 13 02:20:34 2015 UTC,This is no longer the case. You do not have to bring your ID to the customer service desk for a temporary membership card. Just show it to the cashier at the cash register.

rit,3d2hgq,white-forest,2,Mon Jul 13 16:43:32 2015 UTC,"Rit official policy is ""no power strips and no international converters"" because people use them wrong and pull too much wattage off of them.  That said, everyone uses them. Bring a power strip, don't fill it completely, and if you're sucking down power then spread it across multiple outlets.   Tupperware- this is useful if you have a mini fridge (WORTH BRINGING) and want to store food overnight. Plates and spoons aren't so important... Pick them up if you need them later.   Lamps- get a desk lamp that has a small footprint, but cranes over your desk well to light it up. Get a 60w bulb for it, and that's more than enough light to work with.   Another common lamp is from Target, they have a floor lamp that splits into five flexible arms with separate lamps on the end."
rit,3d2hgq,quietlight,8,Mon Jul 13 00:22:37 2015 UTC,"You can have power strips (the PDF in the OP even has it on the checklist), just not extension cords or multi-plug adapters."
rit,3d2hgq,NotAnonymousRIT,3,Mon Jul 13 02:09:56 2015 UTC,just get a power strip with a long cord =P
rit,3d2hgq,djh3315,6,Mon Jul 13 02:21:37 2015 UTC,Which is perfectly safe because it has a fuse that will trip if you try and pull more power through it than than the cord can handle.  The problem with extension cords is that they don't have a fuse and can overheat/melt/short/start a fire if they aren't used property. You should never semi-permanently use an extension cord unless you want to have a bad time.
rit,3d2hgq,naturalorange,2,Mon Jul 13 05:56:35 2015 UTC,"If you're living in Gleason bring a desk lamp AND a room light. The tiny light by the door in there is pathetic and won't light the room well at night.  Bring silverware/plates for food in your room. And speaking of food in your room, bring some decent food as well as a nice mini fridge. On campus dining can get old, so it's nice to have your own food. Also a mini fridge is invaluable (at least to me) because you can have cold water/food/alcohol in there.  BRING A MATTRESS PAD. Unless you're like some people i know who can sleep comfortably anywhere you'll want to have a little more padding between you and that brick of a mattress.  Warm clothes. Although it's not a room necessity, you'll definitely need them to survive the winter here. You'd be surprised how many people bring a light jacket and think that'll be enough.  Shower caddy/shoes. No explanation needed.  Entertainment: Vidya games, TV, books, anything to keep you entertained on slow days.  A decent wardrobe. And no, a collection of greasy MLP shirts, cargo shorts, and fedoras don't count.  A small fan. This is especially necessary in the summer/fall if you don't have a room with AC. It'll help keep you and your roomate(s) slightly cooler. I still used mine in the winter because it helped drown out the noise of people in the hallway and outside my window."

Plates and bowls are really helpful for if you want to microwave something or you are splitting a meal with someone and don't want to eat like a savage. Forks, knives and spoons are nice if you forgot to grab utensils from wherever you got your food and are eating in your room. Cups and mugs are nice if you have anything you want to drink but don't want to drink it from the container."

When I first talked to my roommate from freshman year, I was also worried rooming with him at first, but realized he was a relatively normal, albeit funny guy.   Now this might not be the case with you, but there's a difference between someone who is radically different from the people you normally hang out with, and someone who might be unstable.  If latter is the case, definitely contact housing stating your concerns. Like others may have mentioned, this might not be a housing issue, but a public safety issue, or some other issue. However, you can contact housing and they can figure out the best course of action. housing [at] rit.edu is the e-mail address if I recall."

I'm not sure the details that make you feel this way but if there is a religious or some other sort of reason contact housing. Otherwise you may have to just deal with it and ask housing to move you somewhere else later on. Just keep in mind that your next roommate (if you ask housing to just move you anywhere) could be worse. Best is to find someone nice that has an open bed in their room. They have places on campus you can stay if there is legit issue (like physical fighting or verbal abuse) so contact campus safety if that is a problem."

rit,3cqff4,nklim,3,Fri Jul 10 00:54:26 2015 UTC,"Yet they keep adding buildings for colleges and classes for the increasing number of acceptances each year (even if they aren't paying the majority of it). Besides the Inn, students get placed in the Radisson (which can't be cheap for at least a semester) each year because RIT has no plans to build new housing for the current and increasingly new students year after year. I'm all for enrollment going up each year, but you need space to put all the freshman for 1 year and then bet on the high majority of them not moving off-campus for the next year or two. Tear down Riverknoll, rebuild, and add another building for housing on campus somewhere else. The Endowment is big enough. It doesn't need fancy features like the Poliseum.  And I know I'm dreaming but it's reality.  We need more housing if the population is getting bigger. That or cut down on admissions."

From their About:  ""The MAGIC Center at RIT is a conscious and deliberate effort to blur the lines between the arts and the sciences, between technology and expression, between the study of the creation of media and its impact and effect on society and the human condition. It is intended as a university wide, multi- and cross-disciplinary center in which faculty, staff, and student researchers, artists, and practitioners come together to create, contextualize, and apply new knowledge in a multitude of related fields and disciplines as appropriate not only to STEM, or the Arts & Humanities, but their intersection.""  2) Digital media in this context refers to media that is ""interactive, experimental, expressive, [and/or] social"". Saunders calls your profession New Media Marketing, and is concerned with ""online marketing theory and the application of interactive strategies.""  I get the impression that MAGIC is a big sandbox, and they want a lot of people to come play, regardless of where the lines between tribes are traditionally drawn. Commercialization of media is part of that, so marketing would be presumably be relevant.  Paging /u/jenndh to fact-check any of this."

I've already been offered a part-time position in the fall while I'm in school. Alaris sort of has an informal program, but based on the state of Kodak as a whole they might not be the best place to stay in the long term.  In terms of OCD specifically: *Pay is good *Building is nice (if you're in R&D, manufacturing is in Kodak park and pretty old) *Management is nice and puts a lot of emphasis on the importance of interns *Interns do actual jobs, not just boring QA BS *Many opportunities to try different things if you talk to the right people *Pretty much every engineering major has a crucial role here"

rit,3comky,lyon934,18,Thu Jul 9 15:08:56 2015 UTC,"From my understanding, the gender neutral bathroom movement is so that everyone can feel comfortable going into a bathroom, so this would imply that there will be unisex bathrooms for people who would prefer to use those bathrooms, but also gendered bathrooms for those who would prefer to use gendered ones."
rit,3comky,Mittens_of_Honey,13,Thu Jul 9 15:38:58 2015 UTC,"Forgive my ignorance, but what is the need for gender-neutral restrooms? Is it because nonbinary students are unconfortable using segregated restrooms? Or is it because cisgendered students are uncomfortable with non-cis students using the restrooms?  If it's the former, wouldn't students just use whichever restroom they most identify with?  And if it's the latter, then a gender-neutral bathroom would be solving the wrong problem.    I think there's a chance this is too accommodating, and people are in favor of this because they're just being supportive. But as an institution this is bending over backwards in a way that might be unnecessary, from my point of view.   Would be happy to hear others' thoughts."
rit,3comky,homophone_police,9,Thu Jul 9 16:06:18 2015 UTC,"As mentioned, it's about feeling comfortable and safe. Trans-identifying people are attacked at a terrifying rate. According to the Office for Victims of Crime, 1 in every 2 transgender individuals are sexually assaulted with some statistics being as high as 66%. This is often paired with physical harm, so those in the community may feel threatened if they use a gendered bathroom.  For example, someone who is male-to-female would want to choose the female gendered bathroom (since they identify as female), but may still look stereo typically male. This could cause some issues if the females already in the bathroom don't understand that this individual is transgender.   While I would like to believe that everyone at RIT would be understanding towards this, I've seen and heard otherwise on campus."

There are prudish people, holdovers, and foreign students who come from countries where being transgender or cisbi-gender (or genderless) would be heavily punished and, as such, they don't have a lot of experience with these folks (yet).  It's a free country here, they can use whatever bathroom they want. Victims of abuse or rape who are not comfortable with people of the opposite (or even same) gender - let them heal on their own time, and these (or gendered) bathrooms might help that healing process.

But I want better justification for what happens than just ""feelings"" and being ""safe"". Segregating bathrooms further seems like the wrong thing to do and the more equal thing would be to have no gendered bathrooms and just have everyone adapt... then we'll never have to deal with it again.  Also, in terms of gay marriage, it's not like you couldn't ask questions about it. For example, what if gay people were given the same rights of marriage but under a different term? That way, religious people couldn't argue against marriage and same-sex couples would still have the same rights.  There's some legitimate discussions to be had regardless."

And I know the social justice types want to bang down the walls on me but you know that's just how I feel, I don't really care if they are gay, straight, or Trans or whatever. I don't just selectively go, oh well she is trans so that doesn't make me uncomfortable, and to think that people are like that is a ridiculous notion. There are certain things that make me uncomfortable.

rit,3comky,nrrillinthas,3,Thu Jul 9 18:25:52 2015 UTC,So with the recent influx in acceptance and open-ness of gender fluidity gender neutral bathrooms are necessary.  Many trans people are forced to use the bathrooms of their assigned genders even when they present as another gender.  That often makes them feel unsafe or the people in the bathroom feel unsafe (FTM would not want to use a woman's restroom if they identify and present as a male and MTF would not want to use the mens room.)  What that means is it is a safe space where people know due to the fact that it is deemed gender neutral to know what could be there.  So no trans person would have the chance to run into a transphobic person in the restroom who might want to cause them harm or belittle them when they just want to take a shit.

For transgender people who don't pass as their gender, going to the bathroom can be an ordeal.  You can go into the bathroom of your assigned sex and be humiliated or you can go into the bathroom of the gender you identify with and get looks and be harassed.  Gender neutral bathrooms are a way for transgender students to go to the bathroom and feel safe doing so, regardless of what they look like.  There are already gender neutral bathrooms around campus.  The goal of this petition is to create more of them and it won't affect anyone who doesn't want to be affected."

Those interchanges at 15 and Jefferson and 15A and Jefferson are an insult to modern engineering.

rit,3cgf8j,LtPowers,14,Tue Jul 7 20:02:04 2015 UTC,This is really the most important comment in this thread.
rit,3cgf8j,CaptainTachyon,10,Tue Jul 7 20:26:46 2015 UTC,"Physics and Engineering, I could understand. Physics and Math, sure. But Physics and CS have very little to do with one another. Usually the place where the two disciplines cross is called Computer Engineering.  Actually, that might be a better route for /u/ahoover8 to take. With CompEng, you'd get training in programming as well as a better understanding of the physics behind how computers operate.  If ahoover8 is just interested in Physics for the science, though, it seems a waste. That's what electives are for."
rit,3cgf8j,LtPowers,6,Tue Jul 7 21:12:20 2015 UTC,"Programming is pretty key to modern physics, because a lot of the work isn't in experimenting, but running simulations and analyzing data with programming. Physics majors have to take a computing course where they learn coding basics and do a few simple simulations, which is then used in later classes. Most of the physics research involves programming. Doing both is pretty common."
rit,3cgf8j,ApolloNeverDied,10,Tue Jul 7 22:38:02 2015 UTC,"If /u/ahoover8 is interested in the physics of computers, Computer Engineering is a good broad start. We deal with most levels of computer design, including software development though many CEs prefer digital hardware design.  Rule of thumb:  CS majors study algorithms and math with computers  SE majors develop applications usually with high level languages  CE majors work with low level code, processor, and digital design.  MicroE majors deal with device physics, fabrication, and semiconductors  EE majors deal with mostly analog device design, but they also do a lot of digital design and power system stuff."
rit,3cgf8j,drphillycheesesteak,4,Tue Jul 7 22:13:34 2015 UTC,I did a similar thing and the answer is most definitely yes. Scientist who can program are extremely valuable.
rit,3cgf8j,CaptainTachyon,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:48:53 2015 UTC,I of course haven't completely made up my mind. But I'd like to go into computational physics. This us just my current thought though. I realize I might just go into CS and then I wouldn't need the physics
rit,3cgf8j,tedward27,5,Wed Jul 8 00:36:37 2015 UTC,"If you want to go into computational physics, you might be better off choosing one of those majors and minoring in the other subject to learn the necessary skills. If you wanted to get into computational physics, you may want to pursue the physics degree but take as much CS as you can reasonably fit in. Having a strong CS background but being in the physics department would put you in a strong position to get into some of the research groups here doing computational physics work (including the CCRG if you're into astro or the granular lab, among others). A lot of physics majors do research that involves a lot of computation but learn it as they go - a deeper knowledge of CS would make you very competitive.  Feel free to PM me or comment if you have questions about physics and research here."
rit,3cgf8j,LtPowers,4,Wed Jul 8 00:42:03 2015 UTC,"Siding with /u/CaptainTachyon and /u/nrrillinthas on this: you would be better off majoring in one (probably Physics) and minoring in the other. CS gives you a co-op experience, whereas Physics gives you a senior capstone project. You could also do research with a physics faculty member at any time if you find a project worth working on and have the skill set to do good work.  A bit puzzled at ""then I wouldn't need the physics"" after you said ""I'd like to go into computational physics"". That shit is hard and you'll need a physics background to comprehend the projects. If you want any info on your options for doing comp physics while at RIT, send me a PM (my capstone project was one of the more computational ones last year)."
rit,3cgf8j,nrrillinthas,2,Wed Jul 8 05:06:44 2015 UTC,Touche. I should have thought of that.
rit,3cgf8j,CaptainTachyon,1 point,Wed Jul 8 01:40:16 2015 UTC,"If you want do computational physics, you would be much better off with a degree in Physics.  A few computer science classes and maybe even software engineering classes will put you far ahead of the pack if you do any kind of scientific computing.  Most people I work with know how to program but they suck at it and don't even realize how bad their code is.   A lot of physics majors start out with 2 majors and drop one of them and just minoring in it.  Once you start taking classes, you'll have a much better idea of what you want to do.  For now I would try doing both physics and CS classes, and take intro to computational physics with Dr. Shore in the spring with all the freshmen physics majors.  Intro CS and intro Physics classes are both very useful for either major.    Also, people are going to tell you that the physics department here sucks, but that simply is not true.  Physics is just hard.  In my experience, those people just aren't willing to put in the effort.  It's well worth the effort though.  Good luck!"
rit,3cgf8j,ATwig,13,Wed Jul 8 02:38:43 2015 UTC,"tldr; Possible, but probably stupid  I can't say that much about the CS end, but I'm a current officer for the Society of Physics Students, so I can talk a bit about the physics end. We do have lots of people double major, however it's more often math than anything else. I do know of at least one person double majoring in CS and Physics, but he came in with credit for Calc and Physics so he was able to skip the intro classes. If you can't get out of Calc I and II and the intro physics sequence, you're going to have a much harder time finishing two majors.   That said, your sophomore and/or junior year is probably going to be miserable having to take the more advanced physics classes at the same time as a bunch of CS.  I would also really think about why you want to add physics. If you're focusing on CS for undergrad and a masters, it sounds like you're very employment-focused. Tacking on another degree may do more harm than good for you; you could do a lot in terms of CS and personal projects in the amount of time you would have to spend to finish a Physics BS.   Lots of people come in with grand plans of double/triple majors and grad school and co-ops and everything else they want to do. Just choose a major to start with, if you want to switch things up and add stuff later, you'll probably have more than enough time."
rit,3cgf8j,ApolloNeverDied,5,Tue Jul 7 20:26:03 2015 UTC,"BS CS degree is five years, plus another year if you do the BS/MS program. Your AP credits might knock out most of your general electives but the progression of the CS classes is going to limit your ""speed"" (gotta take CS3 before CS4 etc...).  Co Ops are also going to limit you, but they will DIRECTLY contribute to your ability to get a job after school.   I just had a friend graduate with a Dual Degree in CS and Computational Mathematics (both BS's) and it took him six years, no repeated classes and a good bit of  AP.  You should be expecting seven years if you want two BSs and a master's. Emailing your counselor will be your best bet. They're all super helpful.   Feel free to PM me if you have more questions about the cs program or RIT in general :)"
rit,3cgf8j,CaptainTachyon,3,Tue Jul 7 19:00:49 2015 UTC,"Long story short, ask your adviser (You should have an email from them).  In my experience, if you are doing a BS/MS there is no reason beyond personal interest to get a duel degree. I just graduated with a BS/MS in CE and all any employer asked me about is what my MS is in.   I believe the CS dept allows you to get your MS in another department if you do BS/MS, that would allow you to do a Physics MS if you want."

I'm a CSEC major so I have to take a lot of the same courses as CS majors, and every first year CS course I took had around a 50% dropout/fail-out rate (but I also did get a pretty bad professor). We also can't really tell you how much AP credit will help unless you tell us for which classes you get credit.  I know CS majors and physic majors, and from I've seen/experienced of their workload, you will absolutely hate yourself and your life if you do both."

However, the CS department does offer a BS/MS program where you get both in 6 years.  If their approach is similar to the SE BS/MS program (which I did), it's not that much more difficult than the typical BS program."
rit,3cgf8j,notYourBusiness69,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:54:43 2015 UTC,"So I can't really say anything about a degree in CS. But I just got my BS in Physics so I'll make a few comments. With the right amount of incoming credit you can do the physics degree in three years if you're not taking a lot of other non-relevant courses. But be warned it would be a hard three years especially since by your second year you'll be getting into the fairly difficult upper level courses (Mechanics, Math Methods, Electricity and Magnetism). Also, if you make physics your primary major you'll have to complete a capstone research project which can be very time consuming. So I'll leave it at if you REALLY want to you might be able to squeeze out a BS in CS and Physics in 5 years, assuming you plan your courses and co-ops properly (keep in mind you don't co-ops for a BS in physics) and do the MS in the sixth year. But you'll probably have to overload on courses at least a few times and be comfortable with lots of homework. If you're serious about this I would meet with advisors in each department and start planning out your course schedule for the first couple of years and go from there. Hope this helps!"

Download those 3 certificates and get them onto your device. I emailed them to myself, I assume any app that displays the certs when on the device will work.

rit,3bymqk,asdf123yeahcool,3,Fri Jul 3 05:48:41 2015 UTC,"Typically I just use one of the online programs, turbotax or h and r block. They've dumbed them down so much that it's pretty much impossible to mess it up. Until you get into more complicated stuff like a family/house/stocks/etc. it's not really worth it to have someone do them for you.  Basically all the relevant parties (job, school) will send you forms, turbotax will ask if you have that form.. you punch in the numbers and the program does the rest.  You should get most of your tax money back.. when you file, you can take the standard deduction which is usually about 12000. So say you make $15000, you take away the standard deduction and you only have to pay tax on $3000. There may also still be credits for school, which turbotax will tell you about.  Keep in mind that your parents may be able to claim you, so before you do anything you'll have to check with them and see what they're doing."
rit,3bymqk,xplosivo,3,Fri Jul 3 13:06:20 2015 UTC,"Next year, when it's time to file your taxes, try the CASH Coalition of Rochester. We usually have a location at South Town Plaza.

rit,3bymqk,LtPowers,2,Fri Jul 3 14:17:56 2015 UTC,"In most cases, taxes are taken right out of your paycheck, and you file between February and April 15th of next year to make sure you paid the right amount (aka get your refund!). You will certainly need to file federal taxes, and likely taxes for the state you officially live in and/or worked in. Best to talk to a tax preparer if you are unsure. You can use programs like turbotax or quicken, but if you are totally lost, visit an HR Block or other tax preparation company - they can be found all over. Some company sets up shop in walmart during tax season. Taxes are really easy to do yourself though - and you should be able to file the ""EZ"" version which is usually free...although companies will charge preparation fees.  And yes, you will get most of the money you pay in taxes back, since your income will be below some certain threshold that I don't know off the top of my head.  Like /u/cle_ said, you can claim deductions on your W-4 to pay less taxes now and not get as big of a refund when you file, but it gets pretty confusing. I prefer to claim 0 deductions, take a slightly smaller check now, and get a ""bonus"" in March."

The term is ""exemption"". On your taxes, you get exemptions, worth about $4000 each off the top of your taxable income. You get one for yourself if you're not a dependent; your spouse gets one; and you get one each for any dependents you have.  The exemptions on the W-4 form may be different from the ones on your taxes, however. Usually they'll match up, but depending on your financial situation, the W-4 will have you increase or decrease the number of exemptions in order to decrease or increase your withholding.  The instructions for the W-4 are very straightforward."

Dorm buildings either have racks near the front and/or back doors, and some have indoor storage space in the A-level.  I've never really bothered with a helmet going to class and back since it's just one more thing to carry.  But as mentioned by others, you may want one if you're not totally confident riding the roads off campus.  There's a great trail just past the railroad crossing near Park Point that's very peaceful.  Also, STICK TO THE BIKE PATH in the residential and campus life areas.  The quarter mile walkway is way too congested to ride on.  Just use caution near the bus stop when riding because there are a lot of people crossing.  That's all I got....

The bike path is shared with longboarders and pedestrians who tend to do weird things at weird moments.  A friend of mine smashed his face in because someone cut him off.  I've had a lot of near misses.  Off campus, I always wore a helmet.    If you store your bike in the basement of a res hall, it may be very difficult to get out since those areas get crowded.  Leaving it outside in the rain isn't great either.  I kept mine in my room when I could.  As far as theft goes, mine never got stolen but it wasn't worth a whole lot.  General rule is to have a bike that looks like it's not worth the effort - better secured and less valuable than the bike next to it.  U-Locks are nice but not always practical on a crowded bike rack.  Anything else is pretty easy to break.  As for looking like it's not worth much, I had an old road bike that I cleaned up to be very functional but not necessarily very attractive.  A brand new mountain bike that's all shiny and covered in brand name stickers will probably draw some attention to itself.  Never a guarantee though."

My freshman year while riding behind the library on the smooth flat pavement that was quite slick from the rain, I turned my handlebars a little to quickly, but the bike kept going forward. Fell off and my chin took the brunt of the impact.   Nothing was broken and all I needed were about 4 stitches on my chin and some road rash on my hands and knees, but I could have seriously fucked up my neck or head. I was extremely lucky and rarely rode my bike for the rest of the year. I found that most things were a short walk away and if they were farther I just budgeted my time better.  I'm probably gonna bring my bike back this year for convience, but I'm bringing a helmet.  Also, if you're worrying about ""not being cool"" for wearing a helmet on campus, no one's gonna fault you for it or think you're a loser (it's not high school). If they do, fuck em', they're not someone you'd want to relate to anyways. Being safe is a lot better then being dead.  Shoutout to /u/rit_ambulance for making sure I didn't break my neck and giving me a free ride to the hospital, they're some of the most awesome people you can meet (but hopefully will never have to).

If you need more access to UofR or RIT libraries to borrow books and you live in Monroe county, consider getting an RRLC access card as a ""researcher"" through the rochester central library.

I think the smartest thing you can do is to spend a year or two at community college before transferring to RIT, while focusing on building a strong math and science foundation. If you do great in all your classes, great! If you struggle and have to retake some classes, you're paying a tenth of the money to do so versus struggling at RIT."

I took it the 26th, and heard it was due the 27th, I saw on my phone the date was off for some reason and I panicked. Things like sine and cosine waves with the radian measures I think the site didn't count properly? I think the format that a few of my answers were in messed with the grade because of the site.

rit,3bbbs8,quietlight,3,Sat Jun 27 22:13:38 2015 UTC,If the error dropped your score down so much it would probably be a good idea to retake it.

I feel like people always get way to caught up in the numbers, gpa this, sat that honestly it's mostly just stupid numbers. Just remember that there is actually going to be someone reading your application and make it a personal thing. Show them why they you would be a great student to have. Don't just make yourself numbers and statistics on a page.  If you really show them you have a desire for the field of study ( game design?) and tell them about the three games you built and how you really think this is your passion I guarantee they will let you in.

rit,3bbbs8,Umbrall,4,Sat Jun 27 18:25:36 2015 UTC,"As a past member of RIT's admissions dept, I tell applicants ""write about your goals and dreams for the future, and how RIT can make the first steps of those dreams achievable."" Make those things appear in your essay. Talk about your drive, your motivation, your existing growth in the sector (the games you have made so far). That part helps you look like a more reliable candidate, because you have already gotten your feet wet and are making an educated decision to continue the career.   Looking at a larger admissions perspective, colleges want students who are going to finish the curriculum, graduate, and continue working in those fields successfully. That last part makes the school look better when their students are successful. So consider that when you're choosing how you write your essay.  Rit particularly chooses students who are self-motivated, driven, and more mature than most other schools. We really look for students who know where their life is heading (or at least have a plan). This isn't a party school (though we do have fun) and its not really a fraternity school either. We work hard, we play hard, and we're proud of being geeky.   A lot of applications come packed with stories about the past and overly-weasled essay writing that's been henpecked by two parents, four aunts, and both sets of grandparents. No remnants of the original writing left. Don't be that guy. Write a heartfelt letter about who you are, where you are going, how you're going to change the world, and why RIT should be a part of your journey.   I also need you to know this... RIT's game design and CS majors are RELENTLESSLY competitive for four or five years. There isn't a break, and the pressure is notable. You need to be ok with that, and show up ready to work from day 1. No slacking, study like you're getting paid for it, and help your classmates as much as you can.   Best of luck!

I originally went to OCC because my GPA in HS wasn't strong, but after a 4.0 in Fall 2014 I figured I could just get in sooner and did.  One thing I have to say is if anyone takes this route (1 or 2 years) try and take at least 17 credits each semester just in case. I have 2nd year status, but with only like 26 credits.

Having the courage to go in and make your case really shows your dedication to the school, not to mention that it's a lot harder for someone to deny someone whose face they've seen since than denying a set of numbers on a paper. Dress up nicely, go in, and be confident. Doing my interview really helped put my mind at ease, and almost certainly played a roll in getting accepted myself."
rit,3bbbs8,Saxing,2,Sat Jun 27 20:35:07 2015 UTC,"The best advice I can give is when you write your letter/essay do not bullshit it. Right something legitimate that you would be proud of.   Also consider applying early decision, maybe consider retaking the SATs and getting a tutor this time. Like a real tutor, not your mom. It worked for me, the tutor and early decision.   Do everything in your power to put yourself in the best situation and then just relax; with the peace of mind that you have done everything you could to get into RIT."

They offer a combined checking and savings account that allows them to offer savings-account-like interest rates (up to 0.55% currently) with the convenience of being able to write checks and use debit cards. No more transferring funds between checking and savings. As /u/kuffy points out, they have a full branch on campus, and as /u/white-forest points out, shared branching with many other credit unions. Cons: The network of shared branching is generally limited to the Rochester area. They are part of the AllPoint ATM network, allowing you to use thousands of ATMs nationwide, but you can't do deposits at those ATMs. (Fortunately, Advantage's mobile app allows you to photograph your checks and deposit them electronically!)   First Niagara:   Pros: They've got the most ATMs on campus. As a large regional bank, they've got lots of stability, a large depositor base, and a full suite of financial products. Branches throughout New York, Connecticut, and much of Pennsylvania. Cons: Savings account rates aren't all that great. No locations outside the Northeast.   Bank of America:   Pros: Huge national bank. Countrywide presence. Cons: Only one ATM on campus. Savings accounts rates are absolutely pathetic.

I assume there are limits on CPUs, RAM, and Disk space, but is it restricted to academic use only? Could it be used for personal projects? As far as suggestions go, I saw there was a template for you to install your own OS, which is great. However, I would love the ability to create custom templates. Possibly even allow sharing them with other students."
rit,3az2ly,holtr94,2,Wed Jun 24 18:10:32 2015 UTC,"The biggest restriction is raw resources, with CPU being the biggest one. The Academic Cloud right now has ~560GHz of processing power, which can easily be consumed by two classes of students. RAM is another finite resource that can be chewed through quickly.  What do you mean by personal projects? You are 100% free to use the Academic Cloud as a testing environment; to try out different configurations for servers and OSs. The goal is to be a usable playground. If you are referring to providing hosting, no. It is not the goal of the project. That would be really cool to have down the road, but not at this time.  As for student templates, that a really good idea. I'm not sure 100% on how that would work, but it is now on the list of things to do!"
rit,3az2ly,SaberKOG91,3,Wed Jun 24 18:35:13 2015 UTC,"560 GHz is not a very helpful metric. What kind of processors are you using? AMD Opterons are slower per clock than Intel, for example.  Also, what kind of RAM are we talking? Windows chews through 1.5-2GB just to boot."
rit,3az2ly,SaberKOG91,2,Thu Jun 25 00:08:49 2015 UTC,"Currently, the processors are 16 core AMD Operons for a total of 256 cores spread across the cluster. There is 2TB of RAM as well.  There will be more hardware added over the summer, but the exact number escapes me at the moment. Don't quote me on this, but I think the goal is to double the dedicated hardware."
rit,3az2ly,fletch3555,3,Thu Jun 25 00:29:40 2015 UTC,"So without adding any new hardware and knowing that there are currently over 3000 students enrolled in GCCIS as of Fall 2014:  If everyone were to have a single VM to themselves, fair share would guarantee 187 MHz of true CPU time and 683 MB of RAM. Now, a 20% usage rate (600 students) by GCCIS would up those numbers to 933 MHz and 3.4 GB of RAM. At that point you might be able to get reasonable performance out of a Windows Server 2012 instance for each user.   This basically means that GCCIS alone has the ability to soak up the resources of this cloud and render it useless to any of the other colleges. You would have to triple the size of the environment just to handle 10% of the reported total enrollment of RIT in 2014. And that's only guaranteeing enough allocation to run a single Windows VM, let alone simulate an AD environment with a dozen servers."
rit,3az2ly,rabid_android,1 point,Thu Jun 25 11:08:16 2015 UTC,"Sorry for the delayed reply.  I know the numbers don't work out. We probably need to quadruple the number of servers that are in the cluster. Only a few courses this faill will be using it. The classes and schools will adopt it at their own pace; if they choose to adopt it at all.  We are adding more hardware to the cluster over the summer. Some of the new servers will be Intel Xeon's; which will greatly increase performance. I don't know how much will be added, because there are a lot of moving parts that need to align to get the servers, and get them online and added to the cluster. I don't even have a clear number to the exact amount of servers that can be added. Everything is still in flux."
rit,3az2ly,McSaucy,2,Fri Jun 26 12:57:47 2015 UTC,Would this be made available to alumni as well?
rit,3az2ly,rabid_android,2,Thu Jun 25 00:10:42 2015 UTC,"I can't answer that. Out of the gate, I don't think so.  I, personally, think that is a great idea, but as I have said before, it all comes down to resources and capacity."
rit,3az2ly,McSaucy,2,Thu Jun 25 00:41:28 2015 UTC,So if you build it they will come?  Who is supporting this model and the classes if the cluster becomes overextended?  I great number of us suffered through Arlis (spelling?) before building our own dedicated VM environments to get our coursework complete on time.  How is this being funded (i.e. donated equipment or dedicated hardware budget with refresh cycle) and who is taking ownership for making this work? Will this prevent individual departments from refreshing current computing labs?   I am really curious as the idea is great but a centralized academic cloud requires resources that RIT currently does not have.
rit,3az2ly,rabid_android,1 point,Fri Jun 26 17:58:40 2015 UTC,"Yes.  Support is still being worked out, but I think the fact that I'm spending my summer (and getting paid) to work on the Academic Cloud says something about the commitment. There will be a support team, who will keep the hardware and software working. I don't have enough information to give you a full answer of what that support team will look like, but I know there will be incident support. The hardware is going to be a mixture of donated, new, and refreshed hardware. The current hardware was unused, or cascaded out of production hardware. There is some new hardware in the pipe, and I'm sure that donated hardware will be more than welcome. Last semester was the first semester that the Academic Cloud was a thing, so there really has not been a chance to make a good Business Case for funding. I see no reason that this will prevent any department from refreshing current labs. Adding new software/images takes, at most, a hour of time. The plan is to update the base templates at least every semester, and add new versions when released. Anyone can upload ISO files to the mediastore, and then mount them to a VM. Professors, and probably students, will be able to make custom templates and have them added to the catalog. I really don't see any circumstance in which a department would be prevented from refreshing a current lab. RIT, as a whole, has the resources to make the Academic Cloud happen, but big projects don't happen overnight. You have to build it, and they will come."
rit,3az2ly,thatRITkid,2,Fri Jun 26 19:19:01 2015 UTC,"Support is still being worked out, but I think the fact that I'm spending my summer (and getting paid) to work on the Academic Cloud says something about the commitment   Actually, not really. The cost of a co-op is pretty slim. Moving on.  Now, I'll take this:   so there really has not been a chance to make a good Business Case for funding.   and add it to this:   circumstance in which a department would be prevented from refreshing a current lab.   This is the most obvious business case. Consolidation of resources is a big deal, financially. Workstations are horribly inefficient as they're only used for a fraction of the day whereas a VM environment is way easier to reprovision. I would bet money that a department will be prevented from refreshing a lab (at least temporarily) when someone can come along and say ""The college could spend $50,000 on a single lab refresh or just tell the students to use the free Academic Cloud!"". And once you do that, it's incredibly difficult to go back. Frankly, this happens any time something is provided centrally, even if it is sub-par to what could be provided in-house.   Anyone can upload ISO files to the mediastore   Awesome! I was looking for a place to store all of my Blu Ray images!   You have to build it, and they will come.   My primary concern is that everyone will come onboard and the boat will sink."
rit,3az2ly,McSaucy,0,Fri Jun 26 21:21:03 2015 UTC,"I can't speak to departments getting, or not getting, funding to refresh their lab. Workstations will still be required, because how else would you access the environment? The Academic Cloud's goal is to complement a department's lab space. Some things like playing with switches might be easier virtually, while doing wireless labs can't be virtualized. There is some overlap between virtual and physical labs, but I think it will result in better physical labs because they can become more focuses on the equipment they buy or get donated. It will not be just an ITS project. The schools that are using it will be actively involved.  I think that the Academic Cloud will allow for pooling of resources across departments. During breaks, the cluster could be turned over to Research Computing or EGS for Lan Parties. Instead of department A buying $10k worth of Spinning Disks for lab, and department B buying $10k worth of disks as well, they could pool the money and get $20k worth of SSD.  The ISO store only has 1TB of disk space, so you won't get many on there ... and will be deleted very quickly.  That is a real concern, but it is not like fall will role around and everyone will get access. Classes and schools will adopt at their own pace. We are not forcing classes to use the Academic Cloud, nor are they being compelled."
rit,3az2ly,McSaucy,1 point,Fri Jun 26 23:05:30 2015 UTC,So is there going to be a Beta group to test this or will everyone with an RIT have the ability to use this?  So departments will be paying into the Academic Cloud or will they simply be denied the ability to buy their own equipment?  Is Research Computing and EGS being consulted on the design of the cloud?  It seems like they should have a say in the design if you are using them as examples of benefits of the Academic Cloud.
rit,3az2ly,rabid_android,0,Mon Jun 29 21:31:58 2015 UTC,"I'll try and put together a beta test at the start of August.   If a department is using the Academic Cloud, there will be some commitment from each department. A department won't be required to only purchase hardware for the Academic Cloud. I don't know the specifics, but it will be governed by committee. Each party will share resources, support, and equipment purchases. If nobody buys new equipment, or none is donated, ITS' old production hardware will still be cascaded in.   I'm not sure who has been consulted in the design of it. EGS has not been consulted. It is my idea to let EGS use the unused GPU resources of the VDI cluster for LAN parties, but right now it is just an abstract idea. I'm just using them as examples of beneficiaries of the un-utualized resources. We could set up a massive Hadoop cluster that we could switch on. We could run World Community Grid during break. I'm just giving examples."

rit,3az2ly,thatritguy,0,Mon Jun 29 21:28:52 2015 UTC,"I mentioned before, but support is planned to be split between the users. If Department X and Y are using it, support will split between X, Y, and ITS (not the whole of ITS, just the people responsible for the Academic Cloud). I don't know what that will look like in practice right now, as things are still coming into focus."

rit,3ay23k,wraith9699,4,Wed Jun 24 19:17:16 2015 UTC,"I lived in a two bedroom town home and a single bedroom apartment. Over the past year and a half.  You can have two people living in a one bedroom apartment, but not two students. When I decided to add a room mate after a few months I was first told OK, then told no if one of us was not a student. They then asked for a pay stub as proof of employment.  That's when I moved into the 2 bedroom townhouse. When my room mate got a girlfriend, we were able to have her live there without anyone noticing for the 6 months before we moved. She even had a car. Our neighbors had four people living in their unit with no issues as well. As long as there are empty spaces in the lot, they never ticketed cars without a parking pass.  However, I would not move into a 2 bedroom townhouse at Westbrooke. The unit I occupied had a ton of problems. The basement flooded two or three times and the sub-pump they had installed did not work and was never repaired. During the winter, the pipes froze and ended up spitting gallons of backwash up the kitchen sink. Finally, the bathroom had a mold problem because it didn't have a fan to run while the shower was on. That apartment was nice though. I had no issues during my stay in one."
rit,3ay23k,alteisen_riese,9,Wed Jun 24 13:22:21 2015 UTC,"Just in general, I would avoid westbrooke if you can."
rit,3ay23k,crumcakes,3,Wed Jun 24 15:54:44 2015 UTC,Also anything is better on craigslist than a $1000 security deposit. They do their best to keep it after your lease ends too.
rit,3ay23k,Jangetta,2,Wed Jun 24 19:43:22 2015 UTC,"I would not recommend it. The maintenance team is great but honestly its overly expensive for what you get.   They don't care about, whereas a landlord will usually work with you if you're a good tenant.   Westbrooke will nickel and dime you whenever they can as well. We had a couple bags of empty bottles on our back porch. They came by, took the bottles and charged us $30 for the removal."
rit,3ay23k,GenericHbomb,2,Wed Jun 24 17:18:44 2015 UTC,I lived there above occupancy with an extra car for a year with no issues.
rit,3ay23k,Rhynocerous,2,Wed Jun 24 17:36:35 2015 UTC,"FYI. Westbrooke has no legal right to restrict your occupancy to one person. They say that you can only have one person in the apartment, but the law permits you to have an additional occupant as long as the person on the lease has the apartment as their primary residence, and the apartment isn't overcrowded by the legal definition (which their 1 BR's are certainly spacious enough for two people) . A lot of the things they say in their lease are actually unenforceable and they just use it to try and deceive tenants who don't know their rights. See the NYS Attorney General's guide to Tenant's rights here (page 13 for the info on occupancy restrictions).  http://www.oag.state.ny.us/sites/default/files/pdfs/publications/Tenant_Rights_2011.pdf"

He's come over for a beer after his shift before too.  They don't care about cars parked there unless they're not inspected or registered.. then they do care.  This was two years ago, so if things have changed since then, my bad. But I know last year was the same since I have a friend who took over our apartment after we all left, and I went to visit him a few times...

There are groups that are completely straight edge, and then there's people that'll be tripping on something different every weekend. I've gone to several crazy parties on and off campus, had campo called on us, etc, etc, in groups that traditionally may not seem about that culture. While most of us are pretty nerdy, nerdy can still mean socially adjusted/drinkers/partiers. Not super hard to find."

rit,3axy5j,fixthisstuff,14,Wed Jun 24 13:48:17 2015 UTC,"I am going to make the assumption that you are actually interested in working towards obtaining a diploma and can responsibly get fucked up without jeopardizing that.    Drug / Alcohol culture exists as much at RIT as it does at any other college, it just isn't as out in the open.  The dorm RA's do not fuck around with drinking/being drunk so if that is what you want to do you will learn to be discrete or you will find yourself on probation.  Think about where you used to go to get drunk / stoned in high school...chances are you will find people in the same types of areas around campus.       If you make it past freshman year get the hell off campus.  Rochester is actually a pretty cool city to live in if you're in the 18th/19th ward or the south wedge.  Monroe/Park ave is great too.  You will find plenty of people looking to party and wont run the risk of getting in trouble with the school.  Go to concerts, hang out in the parks, just like with any city you will meet people who have what you're looking for.    Just don't be a dickhead and try to smoke a joint in your dorm room the first week of school.  And when you don't take that advice and do it anyway, don't tell campo your eyes are red because of a cat allergy.  There are no cats in the dorms, they will call bullshit.  EDIT: I see a few people commenting on how bad the RIT party scene is. Total sausage fest, tons of nerds, nothing going on, etc. This is entirely true, parties on campus SUCK. That's why everyone who wants to do that MOVES OFF CAMPUS ASAP. Seriously, I partied almost every weekend with (gasp) real in the flesh girls! THEY DO EXIST!! RIT isnt _____ State University and doesn't pretend to be. If you honestly expected to walk out the front door of your campus apartment and stumble into a rager then frankly you're an idiot. If you thought you could walk down the hall of GCCIS building and bump into a group of scantily clad ZTA sisters, again you're an idiot. RIT is a school for smart people, and smart people party in smart ways. Save that state school rah rah keg stand bullshit for SUNY Brockport."
rit,3axy5j,ghost_of_deaf_ninja,8,Wed Jun 24 17:49:40 2015 UTC,"Here's a pawprints petition response that covers the ""dry campus"" topic, with Dawn Soufleris (who's in charge of residence life, etc.) specifically stating that RIT is not a dry campus.  It's been so long since the alcohol policy was instituted that Google searches can't dig up contemporary news sources. (It would help if I could remember the year.) But the policy never prohibited drinking on campus; it just limited it to apartments and bars, and prohibited full kegs outside of bars. That's it, AFAIK.  As Dawn Soufleris points out, the dorms and Global Village are dry by RIT policy (due to the large number of underage residents); the Sororities are dry by national organization policy; and the Frats are dry by choice."

rit,3axy5j,LtPowers,1 point,Wed Jun 24 12:49:45 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure when the alcohol policy first came around, they pushed for petty much a dry campus, and it was slowly relaxed after that to the state we have now."

rit,3axy5j,apunkgaming,1 point,Wed Jun 24 19:04:45 2015 UTC,"Direct quotation from Dawn Soufleris:   As for the fraternities, the Greek Community chose to remain alcohol-free in those houses long after the university (under Dr. Simone) removed the ability for those houses to have alcohol after some significant behavioral issues back in the 1990’s. The community leadership has reviewed this a few times and has chosen to remain alcohol-free. However, that has been a decision endorsed by students. That may change someday (except for the sororities who must remain alcohol-free my national rules) should the community chose to review it again."
rit,3axy5j,LtPowers,1 point,Sun Jun 28 01:01:43 2015 UTC,"This is wrong. I sat on the IFC for my fraternity for a year. I've read and modified the bylaws with other representatives from the other houses on campus. This is simply false. Seeing as we just put a proposition forward in March to allow those of age to have alcohol in Greek circle, I think that Dawn either is reading outdated bylaws or has ignored the fact that housing currently prevents alcohol from being in the houses. Housing rules everything in the houses. They supersede IFC so even if we chose to not be dry in the houses, they could strike it down."

People drink here, but honestly, everyone here is so fucking anti-social and the parties are such sausagefests that I mostly gave up partying on campus after my second year. I partied harder in high school than I did at RIT. Downtown Rochester has some decent bars. Get a fake ID if you want to party here.  This isn't a state school. Realize that you're basically trading the college experience for a great job in four years. You can party here, but the parties here are pathetic compared to most colleges. Hell, I have friends at Mass Maritime, a fucking military school, that party harder than I do here. I think it's worth it, though. I'd choose RIT again if I had the choice.

If you are coming to RIT and expecting some ASU type ragers you'll be disappointed.  Yes, there is a culture here - not such an outspoken culture, but a culture.  If you are really here to party, you can find it, but it's not so obvious.  It also depends on your major and the people you surround yourself with.  If you're in a small major and everyone is nice, like mine, then you will have parties, but if you shut yourself in with freshmen and your floor then it won't be easy to find and then be let into a party unless you seriously want to pay.  So yes, there is a scene for it, but don't expect it to be an every day type of thing."
rit,3axy5j,Legacy_in_Progress,1 point,Wed Jun 24 18:15:33 2015 UTC,"The parties here are what you make of them. You and a couple of your friends can sit in a room and play games and casually drink and thats a party, or you can go to park point or province and find a party with 40 - 50 people with loud music, drinking, and dancing. Make sure you make friends with upperclassmen your freshmen year if you dont want to try and wonder around campus aimlessly trying to find a party. Your second year if you want get a province or parkpoint apartment and throw the parties yourself, or if you're lucky one of your friends will get an apartment and they'll throw parties. As for drugs, I don't do them myself but its college if you look for them you will find them.   TL:DR Make friends and have fun you'll find parties some bad, some good, and some great."

THAT BEING SAID... if you're basically the rest of the school, you don't have a heavy math requirement, and might only end up having to take one extra class, which should be pretty easy. If you got to retake it, you could kind of play the system by intentionally doing mediocre, getting like 15/30 or something and getting placed into the easiest math track."

rit,3aoebs,mdohrn,2,Mon Jun 22 23:36:59 2015 UTC,"Within the curriculum? I'd say the undergrad program (now known as Media Arts & Technology) focuses pretty well on production. I woudn't say specifically for newspapers, but just in general (what types of files to use, best practices, workflows for output, etc.). For the MS program, it's kind of more advanced versions of those undergrad classes. There's a great course that's part of the required courses called Cross Media Workflow (or something similarly named) where you really dive into how to evaluate processes and systems for all steps and people involved. What's great about the master's program is that there are those core courses, but then they're very open to your career interests and allow you to choose the courses that specifically feel beneficial to you and your research. Since it's an MS program, you do conduct a scientific thesis experiment, which takes up the 2nd year of the 2 year program. I hope that answered your question /u/mdohrn ? If not, I'd be glad to elaborate on more  edited to add: I actually created this Reddit account to help me find participants I could use in my study for my thesis haha"

For example, my study was in digital publishing through sort of a ux lens, while another oen of my classmates did ink tolerance testing (or...something like that-it's out of my realm haha), and another one of us analyzed adoption trends of print technologies by commercial printers.

rit,3alzgc,nedolya,4,Sun Jun 21 15:16:14 2015 UTC,"Hey! I went vegan after I left dorms, but I can still give you the lowdown on how dining on campus works from my experience:  Gracie's has Simply Eats, (allergen-free dining) which is good enough to get you by on those mandatory 5 gracies meals. No soy products, but good selection of veggies. There's also a salad bar, which has chickpeas and maybe some other beans, I don't really remember.  As for other dining places on campus - everywhere has a salad bar. The veggie burger at RITZ is questionable, Brick City sometimes has a good vegan option but it's iffy, Commons has a black bean burger that I think is vegan but I've been too afraid to ask, Salsarita's has a pretty decent veg burrito and their guac is vegan, Xroads has the most options, including black bean, portobello burgers and some other specials with soy cheese and tempeh bacon during the school year. You can also make your own sub and they have rotating chefs.  There's a specialty market over by Salsarita's that has tofu and other more veg-friendly items to stock up your mini-fridge with, including a decent selection of fresh produce. Pretty pricy though. Not sure about the Corner Store's selection.   Midnight Oil has a few items (tofu arugula sandwich with guac is to die for), and Artisano's has been rolling more vegan choices including a falafel sandwich! Nathan's had ONE vegan soup all of last fall semester - pretty much everything is either vegetarian or dairy free, never both.  So long story short 10+ is probably a good choice, as it'll give you a lot more flexibility with your money.  And if you ever need a ride to Wegmans or want me to pick you up something from TJ's, Whole Foods, or the public market, LET ME KNOW! I know how hard it can be (:"

At the grill we have Morningstar brand veggie burgers, black bean burgers, and grilled marinated portobella mushrooms. The sub shop has a variety of veggies for subs. The build your own salad area of course has many options. In the grab and go section there are veggie trays, cut fruit, and a variety of salads. We also have many vegan soups in our daily soup rotation."

However, I have worked in a couple different dining halls and I'm familiar with vegan options. Gracie's has an ""allergen free bar"" that's actually pretty good they  don't have anything in there with the 7 most common food allergies which are something along the lines of meat, dairy, eggs, soy, nuts, gluten, and something I'm forgetting. They work very hard to keep that food from being contaminated by possible allergens (a drastic improvement from the first summer I worked there). gracie's also usually has a salad bar. I worked at commons during the school year and they have a decent salad bar as well but my usual go to vegan meal there was what I referred to as ""the super veggie wrap"" which mostly consisted of every vegetable from both the salad and sub bar that I could possibly get the to cram into a tortilla...

This (generally) means floor-to-ceiling windows and a slightly cramped L-shaped arrangement. Unlike the quads and singles none of the converted lounges have attached bathrooms, and you will likely have to share a single-occupancy handicapped bathroom at the end of the hall. It's worth noting that I was in Ellingson four years ago, so things may have changed. If you know your room number you can find it on the floorplans on-line here.

They took the TVs and couches (well bought new ones) and put them in the kitchen, turning lounges into rooms.

They don't have much in the way of game studios but getting your first co-op at a more general company isn't a bad thing. The school also has a website called job zone where tons of jobs are listed. Your co-op advisor can set you up with some leads if you go in to the co-op office. And if all else fails the school usually has some backups positions available that aren't all that relevant to job hunting but can bail you out and don't look too terrible on a resume.

Also at the time it didn't seem to be terribly difficult to be accepted into the program as a lot of students came from varying art backgrounds with little knowledge of 3D. There is supposedly some restructuring of the program happening so I am not sure if the portfolio requirement is being altered or not, but I think it's a safe bet that some kind of art portolio is still definitely a minimum requirement.  3DDD is essentially a generalized digital art program with a heavy emphasis on the 3D aspect. If you're interested in story design, gameplay mechanics, etc. you won't get much. As of this last year, there was only a single video game related class (Real Time Design, we use Unreal Engine 4), and I want to say that next year we'll have another class of some kind. However, if you are interested in the artistic side of games, there's definitely a good opportunity to tailor your classes on projects to that and focusing on game art as opposed to VFX or any other field. Again, it's pretty generalized, so it is what you make it.  If you'd like more info, feel free to PM me. Hope that helps, best of luck."

rit,3abut1,white-forest,7,Thu Jun 18 22:38:26 2015 UTC,"Considering that it costs ~50K a year, not that good."
rit,3abut1,Noffy4Life,2,Thu Jun 18 23:48:53 2015 UTC,"It's worth noting that your traffic will be routed through RIT's servers. I'm not sure if they log vpn traffic, but if that's a concern for you, you probably shouldn't use it."

rit,3ab3lj,JWTech19,4,Thu Jun 18 17:40:23 2015 UTC,"Also, food debit doesn't expire weekly. It's all given to you at the beginning and since you're an adult, they allow you to budget it over the course of the semester for yourself."
rit,3ab3lj,t8ke,5,Thu Jun 18 17:42:27 2015 UTC,"Be sure to use as many of your 5 Gracie's meals as you can. Gracie's can get boring after a while, so the best way to deal with this is find out what you really like there and only go on those days. (Quesadillas and Philly cheese steak were my favorite!)   You should also use ALL of your 5 meal options every week, no exceptions, as they go away Sunday night. Just use them throughout the week on meals that cost greater than or equal to the value of a meal option. Using a meal option on something worth less than a meal option is just throwing money away. If you stop somewhere for a smaller meal don't use a meal option on it, just use debit. If at the end of the week you still have meal options left you can go to the corner store and stock up on shit.  With that said, you'll have no problem at all staying well fed on the meal plan. I ate a TON of food, gained 10 pounds, and still had ~$250 left of debit at the end of the spring semester. The only time you'll run out of debit is if you refuse to eat at Gracie's or you eat 4000 calories a day."
rit,3ab3lj,Mkrah,2,Thu Jun 18 18:50:40 2015 UTC,"http://mymealplan.info/  This will help to keep you on track with debit.  In general, just use all your meals every week, anything extra use debit. You will be fine even if you don't use EVERY gracies meal as long as you don't eat a ton. I used maybe 80% of my gracies meals and still had to buy 50-100$ of food for other people to finish off my debit 2nd semester."

rit,3ab3lj,_Rogue_,1 point,Fri Jun 19 22:08:54 2015 UTC,"I would always grab cereal and fruit on the way out of Gracies for breakfast for the next day or two. Five meals at Gracies, plus five meal options to use elsewhere, generally got me to the weekend, and I might spend a couple bucks of debit to supplement the meal options here or there. Then, the remaining meals were bought with debit. $40/week for four meals, snacks (you'll become very familiar with Sol's and The Corner Store for snacks), and maybe a hot breakfast or two is plenty. And you'll inevitably eat off campus (ordering delivery, going out with friends, going home for the weekend, etc), but don't make this a huge habit because your real money, unlike your meal plan, does not have an expiration date."
rit,3ab3lj,nedolya,1 point,Thu Jun 18 17:57:10 2015 UTC,I used my five meal options (can be spent p much everywhere) for lunch on the academic side places and Gracies for dinner on weekdays. Used my debit for weekends and if I had a good amount extra would buy snacks.  It all depends on your schedule. If you have late class or a break you could eat a gracies for lunch or whatever. Use http://mymealplan.info/ to see if you are ahead behind on debit and the RIT app has gracies daily menu usually.   EDIT: I also had a box of Costco granola bars for breakfast which worked out really well
rit,3ab3lj,PresentedIn4D,1 point,Thu Jun 18 21:34:01 2015 UTC,"Back when I had that, I more or less winged it. Know in your head how much you have left, and you'll develop a pattern without having to think about it too much. Around halfway through the semester, check up on where you stand with the additional ~650 and plan accordingly from there.  As far as the meal options themselves, for the non-Gracie's ones, be absolutely sure to get the most value possible. You'll figure out the various combos and stuff within a few weeks and the cashiers often offer to help you get the most out of a meal option."
rit,3a8nf7,madridsta4lyf,3,Thu Jun 18 02:31:09 2015 UTC,Not at RIT that I am aware of but if you go to like a Rite Aid or one of those stores nearby they can probably do it.

rit,3a62n6,t8ke,23,Wed Jun 17 15:26:33 2015 UTC,"Pretty much this. Unless admissions has changed recently, RIT doesn't turn away too many. The real wall is whether you can adapt to the school's academics and stay in."
rit,3a62n6,GreenLightt,11,Wed Jun 17 15:58:21 2015 UTC,"Things are changing, but slowly. The admission rate is going down about 1% a year but I'd really like to see that rather than weeding out half the freshman class by the end of their first year."
rit,3a62n6,paperboat22,10,Wed Jun 17 16:09:48 2015 UTC,"If they didn't accept so many people, I don't know if I would have gotten in. I was a lazy highschool student but I work my ass off at RIT. the high acceptance rate gives a lot of chances to a lot of kids."
rit,3a62n6,Paumanok,7,Wed Jun 17 18:29:58 2015 UTC,"It's gonna take a long time for RIT to reach the point that the CRP program is no longer highly profitable for the school. I can see them lowering it a little annually but I dont see them lowering it to the point that we become ""selective"" or prestigious.   RIT simply makes too much money to throw away that in the pursuit of ""prestige.""  If you can make it here for the 4 or 5 years and graduate then you're in damn good shape. Getting in just might be the easiest part."
rit,3a62n6,t8ke,9,Wed Jun 17 18:29:20 2015 UTC,"It only goes down every year because apps go up. In fact, we let in a smaller % of applicants but a higher number because so many apps are coming."
rit,3a62n6,PresBill,3,Wed Jun 17 20:33:13 2015 UTC,That makes total sense. Thanks for the clarification.
rit,3a62n6,t8ke,2,Wed Jun 17 20:45:27 2015 UTC,"They're never going to stop accepting way more students than will actually graduate. It's a money game. They can accept them all, cram them in huge, low level classes, and make easy money before they fail out or decide it's too rigorous and transfer."

rit,3a62n6,Umbrall,2,Wed Jun 17 16:28:49 2015 UTC,"It should be a guarantee that you'll get something if you're within those qualifications. With what you have there, you are without a doubt going to get the full $16k out of presidential. I had a similar SAT score and a lower GPA, also going into CS and got a lot of scholarship money for it."
rit,3a62n6,Umbrall,4,Tue Jun 30 22:34:32 2015 UTC,"GPA is fine,  but your SAT may not get you into your first choice program depending on what it is. You could get placed into engineering technology instead. Raise that score 100-200 points and you should be golden."
rit,3a62n6,paperboat22,2,Tue Jun 30 23:07:44 2015 UTC,"I don't know what you're thinking. I got the same scores the second time I took the SAT and was admitted to the computer engineering program. I did have the advantage of a 610 CR and writing portion however, so if OP is concerned about SAT scores, maybe boost that Reading score a bit.   Edit: Auto-correct failed me."
rit,3a62n6,j0hn4devils,3,Wed Jun 17 15:32:10 2015 UTC,Rit is a little different. They take about 50% of applicants so I really don't think you'll have a problem getting in with what you have. The big thing about RIT is staying in. So many of my friends dropped out for academic reasons that I have lost count.  It's a hard school. If you have the drive you can do it.
rit,3a62n6,thellamajew,3,Wed Jun 17 21:40:42 2015 UTC,"Stop stressing about numbers. I feel that the push to get accepted to prestigious schools hurts students in the long run. As others have said, RIT notoriously accepts almost everyone, and your current numbers seem fine (it's been a while, but I think you're doing better than I did on everything).   That said, focus your stress into making yourself a better student. Do you study often? Do you know how to study? I never studied in high school. I got by with mostly A's, and was content with that so I didn't put in more effort. Then I got to RIT, where studying is mandatory to achieve any success, and struggled early on. So my advice is to build good habits and learn how to be a good student now, before you really need to apply that knowledge."
rit,3a62n6,SnowDog2112,2,Wed Jun 17 16:41:14 2015 UTC,"Its clear you're doing fine, its almost like a humble brag. You'll get in no problem, just don't think its going to be a walk in the park like others have said. I've heard that program is very hard, but if you apply yourself you'll end up with a good degree. I don't get people putting it down for the price either, I wouldn't trade the experiences I've had so far at RIT for anything. It's very much worth the money."

I loved my experience at RIT, but the cost at this juncture doesnt seem worth it when I've got coworkers who went the state school route for 10s of thousands less.   but if you're heart is set on RIT and you keep those grades the same or better, you'll be fine"

rit,39suxa,wsender,7,Sun Jun 14 13:08:03 2015 UTC,"To add to what /u/wsender said, if you cannot find a pdf, either buy a used, older edition copy of the textbook or rent it.

I've saved a lot of money by renting novels and a few text books there, they won't have everything though, it's a hit or miss. Just remember to renew and maybe scan future readings before you have to return the book.  No one ever thinks to do this, so competition is pretty low."

rit,39suxa,sabooya,1 point,Mon Jun 15 01:54:58 2015 UTC,"$50-500, most GCCIS classes you don't need a textbook but science and math courses you almost definitely will.   Pearson MyxLab courses usually require a $100 purchase (your homework is on these, no way around it) so potentially you can have around $500 of ""textbook"" expenses. They come with a digital copy of the textbook so just buy online and don't worry about a textbook. $50 would cover an iClicker that you might need for science courses and a cheap textbook from a class that doesn't need an online Pearson thing.  Figure $100 for any math courses (calc, stats, and possibly crypto), $120 for science electives, and nothing for GCCIS classes. Graphing calculator which you might need for math and science classes would run you about $80 for a TI nSpire. Liberal Arts classes usually about $50 for a textbook, or free through piracy."

It can either be the same height as the desk (essentially increasing desk space) or short enough to fit under the desk. Don't buy your own desk. You probably won't have room for so many desks and you can't put the school-provided desk anywhere else.

rit,39s0zu,white-forest,2,Sun Jun 14 14:53:39 2015 UTC,"Transport Layer Security:       Transport Layer Security (TLS) and its predecessor, Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), are cryptographic protocols designed to provide communications security over a computer network.  They use X.509 certificates and hence asymmetric cryptography to authenticate the counterparty with whom they are communicating,  and to negotiate a symmetric key. This session key is then used to encrypt data flowing between the parties. This allows for data/message confidentiality, and message authentication codes for message integrity and as a by-product, message authentication. [clarification needed] Several versions of the protocols are in widespread use in applications such as web browsing, electronic mail, Internet faxing, instant messaging, and voice-over-IP (VoIP). An important property in this context is forward secrecy, so the short-term session key cannot be derived from the long-term asymmetric secret key.

It's a very simple language, all syntax shouldn't be too mush of an issue. However, don't let all those languages intimidate you. Make sure you learn the theory and structures behind programming, which is what the Computer Science courses are for .

If so, what's the ticket number and resolution. If not, please do so, so we may look into the situation and can come to a resolution.

It's great to hear the charge is being deprecated. It's incredibly frustrating to be told that ""we can't turn on the ethernet, we don't have the budget, so you're SOL"". It's just not a good experience.  Regarding wifi: I haven't filed a ticket. I would be creating them daily and then there'd be the overhead of collecting a bunch of data points which I then pass off to ITS, which may or may not be of any help. Usually the wifi problems can be resolved by turning my wifi off and back on, but that only works some of the time. Maybe it's a client issue. I know other mac users have had issues. Regardless, It's simply less time and effort on my part to just use ethernet, I don't even want to bother with wifi anymore. At this point, I just want the choice to use ethernet quickly and easily because ethernet is very reliable."
rit,396b92,axlits,2,Tue Jun 9 19:23:43 2015 UTC,"I would file the ticket. Sure there could be overhead in collecting data, or it is possible that we already know what the problem is and know of the fix/workaround.  If you don't mind me asking, what version of OS X are you running?  -tony"

I've experienced it on my galaxy s4, a Macbook pro with Linux, my roommate's lenovo with windows 8.1. This isn't a device specific problem but rather a system problem if every type of device has consistent trouble."
rit,396b92,ht5k,8,Mon Jun 22 00:31:52 2015 UTC,"That's actually cheap and the policy has always been around. The fee is largely there to help pay for another network switch as each building/network room grows. It also helps limits each department from going wild and start asking for more network ports than they actually need. If it was free.... wouldn't you want some extra ports just in case? Again switches are expensive. There are also other expenses like rack interconnect cabling and LABOR. I'm sure there aren't people in ITS just sitting there by the phone waiting all day for someone to submit a activation request. They got other things to do. Also sometimes network lines are damaged especially in a older building. This may involve pulling network lines, re-terminating network plates, and etc. All of this takes time. Labor isn't cheap. By the way, depending on the scale of the project ITS actually hires a outside company to handle this work. Most outside vendors bill out somewhere in the $100 / hour range.   Therefore I'm not really sure why people are complaining. Things aren't free in the real world. Time and money don't come from thin air. It has to come out of someone's budget. The same thing applies to other departments on campus. For example, if I wanted another electrical circuit in my office I have to pay FMS to do the work. The cost may vary quite a bit. In the SAU for example, how things are circuited aren't documented very well as a older building. Some of the electricians may end up spending their entire day trying to trace out lines. FMS will repair existing broken things but adding something new involves money for the same reason as stated above."
rit,396b92,xerolan,2,Wed Jun 10 11:59:47 2015 UTC,"Given the nature of the request, why is this on PawPrints? Isn't it supposed to be used for student petitions that SG can act on, not inter-departmental squabbles?  You're working from an employee point of view, not a student one.  Hell, $100 is just a little over half of what my org charges ($180) for a port reactivation."
rit,396b92,axlits,2,Thu Jun 11 18:24:22 2015 UTC,"PawPrints can be used by any member of the RIT who wants to improve the institute in any capacity. While SG officially runs the site, you'll find that many of the status updates and official responses are written by administrators and then posted by SG on their behalf.  SG's purpose is of course to represent the interests of students. If a student has an issue in their capacity as an employee of the Institute, is it in SG's jurisdiction to tackle that? Well, since SG advocates for student interest, I would say so. One thing that is certain, however, is that not posting and not bringing visibility to issues will never lead to any resolution. In the case of this petition: theoretically, ITS could see the petition and then internally decide to look into the value of having the fee structure. Maybe after an internal review the only way to get departments to use wired resources responsibly is by charging a fee, which is something I personally disagree with. An internal fee is still bogus since at the end of the day, students are paying tuition and our tuition goes to supporting our network infrastructure. The argument that ""somebody has to pay for it"" is irrelevant-- we, as students, have already paid and we've paid a lot. It's the institute's responsibly to be good stewards to the dollars we pay to RIT. Of course, ITS has already moved to get rid of the fee before this petition was posted, but that wasn't publicly available knowledge beforehand."
rit,396b92,xerolan,1 point,Fri Jun 12 17:37:14 2015 UTC,Interesting. Is there any documentation on rit.edu that talks about this fee?
rit,396b92,axlits,3,Tue Jun 9 18:34:03 2015 UTC,"Scroll down to Activation Charge  Just a note, this applies to academic areas. All residential areas should have all jacks already active.  -tony"
rit,396b92,xerolan,2,Tue Jun 9 18:36:09 2015 UTC,"Just a note, this applies to academic areas. All residential areas should have all jacks already active.   Thanks for the clarification. I take it the fee is $100, and OP was incorrect when he stated $150?  When factoring the cost of power, HVAC, possible additional devices, possible optics for the backhaul, and potential needed increase for upstream capacity, $100 is relatively inexpensive.   Nazareth College just finished a new building recently, and we chose not to light all network drops for this very reason. Considering most of the ports will likely go unused, the additional costs would have been enormous."
rit,396b92,axlits,1 point,Tue Jun 9 19:02:58 2015 UTC,"Yes, $100 is the correct cost, but $150 sounds better, doesn't it?  Either way, the cost is relatively inexpensive once you factor in everything. I believe it is that way because the cost was calculated back in the time of 10/100 switches. If we did that today with gigabit, it would definitely be higher.  You probably did not see the edit to my original post, but we are planning to eliminate the activation cost and that should be revealed soon.  -tony"
rit,396b92,axlits,0,Tue Jun 9 19:09:28 2015 UTC,"When factoring the cost of power, HVAC, possible additional devices, possible optics for the backhaul, and potential needed increase for upstream capacity, $100 is relatively inexpensive.   For a single ethernet jack? I'm no networking expert, I'll admit. But it is certainly enlightening to know that a single jack request could require all of this."
rit,396b92,DittJA,3,Tue Jun 9 19:12:57 2015 UTC,"What /u/axlits said is correct. More than likely fee is the entire infrastructure broken down to the port cost.   In some cases, a single additional drop may very well equal all of that. Especially if port activation requests become frequent, and some aspect of the networking gear is nearing capacity.   For example, that one extra port might mean an entire 48-port switch must be added. And depending on the service level agreement ITS has at RIT, a whole list of implications could arise from that change. Plus, ITS most likely now would have another device that requires a annual maintenance contract.   From an accounting standpoint, it's really easy to simply charge departments on a per port basis to offset the growing costs of supporting the infrastructure. I'm no accounting expert, but given the talk of this fee going away, it seems like a more elegant solution is already in the pipeline."
rit,396b92,burgerboy9n,2,Tue Jun 9 21:32:32 2015 UTC,"Normally that is calculated at the switch level (48 ports) and then broken down for a single port cost. Calling my boss, /u/ritnetman, who can explain in more detail.  -tony"
rit,396b92,axlits,1 point,Tue Jun 9 19:17:17 2015 UTC,Why activate all ethernet jacks in dorms if there is no guarantee they will be used? I don't understand the discontinuity in the policy for different campus areas.

Normally, there is a lot more change in the residential areas vs academic. (Personal view, does not speak for team or policy) For us to go through and de-activate/activate jacks on an annual or semi-annual basis would be very time-consuming and costly.  That's what I think. It's probably not right, but then again, who knows?  -tony"
rit,396b92,cyb3rm0nk3y,2,Tue Jun 9 19:25:21 2015 UTC,"I'd agree with this. It's simply a smaller number of ports to keep in service vs keeping all academic building ports in service. Not to mention with academic ports are not always used due to the fact that people are not in, say classrooms, for extended periods of time as compared to an office with a desktop or permanent user. It doesn't make sense to activate all academic jacks."

I can't speak to Art house, but our policy was that the perks were the same, you just didn't live there, and at the time our keys were building specific, so getting on floor sometimes meant calling someone or waiting for the elevator.  Colby is only a two story building, except for maybe a small section of it.  I don't remember which floor Art House is on, but I believe all or almost all of Colby is various SIH's.  CSH, E-House, and Photo House are all in Nathaniel."
rit,38yyl6,mdumont,2,Mon Jun 8 02:05:56 2015 UTC,Off-floor members of an SIH can request swipe access to the building the SIH is located in.  It's a matter of filling out a form and waiting for it to be processed (a couple weeks).
rit,38yyl6,comptiger5000,2,Mon Jun 8 12:50:37 2015 UTC,"I still want to be actively involved, so is Gleason close enough that I could easily walk to the Art House floor, possibly within a couple of minutes or so?   You could live in literally any dormitory on campus and be within a 5-minute walk of any other dormitory."

rit,38yw0t,nedolya,7,Mon Jun 8 00:42:27 2015 UTC,"You get more food debit than the other plans, and you aren't forced to go to Gracie's as often. Overall it's technically less food, but...Gracies."
rit,38yw0t,thatotherritguy,4,Mon Jun 8 00:43:43 2015 UTC,"Greasy's    FTFY  But in all seriousness 10+ is the least sucky. I did the 20+... Why I did that I will never know. I'm currently a second year with no meal plan but 95% of the time still eat at on-campus dining and I have yet to spend anywhere close to the amount you pay for a meal plan. When I got out of res halls the first thing I did was drop my meal plan, put money in my debit account as needed and get food on campus that way. Also, tiger bucks are literally useless."
rit,38yw0t,SharpMind94,2,Mon Jun 8 02:26:43 2015 UTC,"Honestly I would rather have tiger bucks than debt. It roll over yearly, unlike food debt. Plus you also get to have to the choice of buying items or food with Tiger bucks. Food debt, you can't buy items. With it rolling over yearly, it saves you money, rather than rushing trying to buy as much crap you can before the semester ends."

You don't get tax on food debit purchases.  The reason I say tiger bucks are literally useless is because they are still taxed, but can only be used in a limited number of places. Honestly the only purpose I see for them is a way helicopter parents can give their kids money to spend without trusting them with their own bank account."
rit,38yw0t,Pokebunny,1 point,Thu Jun 11 14:32:14 2015 UTC,"I'm fairly sure you don't pay taxes on food debit while you do pay taxes buying food with Tiger Bucks. You can also reload as much as you want on debit and it shows up nearly instantly, so as long as you're not an idiot you're basically saving ~8% money on food with no downside."
rit,38yw0t,LtPowers,5,Wed Jun 10 02:43:31 2015 UTC,"Even as a freshman, it's highly unlikely you'll be eating more than ten times a week at Gracie's."
rit,38yw0t,mrgilly94,3,Mon Jun 8 00:50:37 2015 UTC,"The number basically means the number of times you have to go to Gracies in a week. You'll find yourself wanted to go there less and less, so starting with the lowest gives you the most freedom to buy at the other food joints on campus."
rit,38yw0t,ht5k,5,Mon Jun 8 05:28:44 2015 UTC,"Just... whatever you do don't get a lower plan and try to go to Gracie's as if you had the 20+ plan. You'll run out of debit. Ugh, you'd be surprised at how many pissed off students would show up near the end of the quarter wondering why their card no longer worked."
rit,38yw0t,yetanotherx,6,Mon Jun 8 14:11:18 2015 UTC,10: You get the most debit.  12: There are none.  14: There are none.  20: There are none.
rit,38yw0t,CaptainTachyon,2,Mon Jun 8 02:41:18 2015 UTC,"In principle, they all work out to the same value, but the bigger the number the more of your meals you have to eat at Gracies. Getting the 10+ will make most of your meal plan debit that can be spend anywhere, which will give you the most flexibility and let you eat wherever you want."
rit,38yw0t,SharpMind94,-1,Mon Jun 8 14:12:51 2015 UTC,"If you're a freshman, only 5 of those options can be used at Gracie's per week. Its stupid, but it is what it is.   I would get the 10+, since it gives you more debt, which is nice to have."
rit,38yw0t,Umbrall,4,Mon Jun 8 15:19:59 2015 UTC,"Ten of them can be used at gracies, only five of them are required to be at gracies."
rit,38yw0t,keator,-2,Mon Jun 8 19:57:54 2015 UTC,"I'm an incoming freshman also, and I've been giving this same question a lot of thought. Seriously I have no life. I chose the 10+ but I based my decision on a few other factors besides everyone else's biased input. 1. Start with the lowest option. If you find you eat more at Gracie's because of time or preference or what-have-you, you have a week or two to switch plans. It would be easier to increase it than decrease. 2. Ideally we would eat 3  meals a day. But college schedules, yet to be determined, and lifestyles are unpredictable. It may be more convenient to eat on the academic side instead of rushing back to Gracie's between classes. You may only have time for a granola bar (or nothing) for breakfast. Dinner is a toss up. Maybe you eat quick small meals instead, in which case Gracie's unlimited seconds is a bit much sometimes. 3. Everyone says you have more debit, but I'm more concerned about value. Are you getting your money's worth? I did the math. Now I'm not a math major so it may be wrong, but I like making calculations (and I placed in a state math competition) so bear with me. The 20+ is [more] expensive and inconvenient so it's out. The 10+ and 14+ cost the same. The 10+ gives you $650 debit per semester and 10 meals at Gracie's. Every plan lets you trade 5 options at other locations, but that's not relevant so disregard it. Ideally you'd eat 3 meals a day, 7 days a week. 21 meals, of which 10 are taken care, leaving you to spread that $650 over 11 meals a week. Each semester is 18 weeks (no, not 16. Orientation + 16 regular weeks + Finals. Less if you go home for Thanksgiving break but let's not complicate this any more). $650 / 18, leaves you with about $36.11 max to spend every week. $36.11 / 11 comes out to about $3.28 per meal (if you make a few of those meals in your dorm - cereal, cold cuts, noodles, salads, etc - you'll manage without even spending all your debit). So the 10+ gives you $3.28 per meal per week. On to the 14+, which gives you $350 per semester and 14 meals at Gracie's. You got the bill for 7 meals a week, 18 weeks, with $350. $350 / 18 = $19.44 a week. $19.44 / 7 = about $2.78 per meal. If my calculations are correct (I'll never use this phrase IRL), the 10+ comes out the greater value IMO. If they're not, find a math major, I'm SOFA. Hope this helps!  EDIT: typo"
rit,38yw0t,Pokebunny,1 point,Tue Jun 9 15:55:46 2015 UTC,You are way overthinking this and literally everyone that puts any thought into their mean plan gets 10+ or wishes they got 10+.
rit,38yw0t,keator,1 point,Wed Jun 10 02:45:14 2015 UTC,"Of course I over-thought it, that's what I said. But personally I would rather think for myself and weigh my own pros and cons than deciding to get the 10+ just because it's what everyone else is doing or wish they'd done. I'm not a fan of the herd mentality."

MEH (Ellingson) is close to The Commons, one of the better places to eat on campus.  RHA and RHB are close to Gracies, where you'll eat most of the time as a freshman. The greeks (fraternities and sororities) are near those though and they can be rambunctious.  All the others slot in between those 4 major areas, check the map so see where they are.

We did this for several reasons, including cost effectiveness, RIT branded buses (owned by First Transit), flexibility in modifying schedules mid semester if needed, and also the ability to utilize the RIT branded buses for things like Brick City Festival, Imagine RIT and Move in, and Commencement to name a few. Our goal is to improve services and costs, not reduce services or provide less quality service.  I think the students will find this new service to be of high quality and meet their needs.  The second part of this is regarding the public transit routes, run by RTS which include Route 24 and Route 67.  RTS will continue Route 24 and RIT has asked them to expand Route 24 to include an 11 PM route off campus Monday - Friday.  This has been negotiated and agreed upon for the fall semester.  RTS has chosen, for business reasons, to eliminate Route 68 from its offerings.  RIT worked with RTS to see if Route 68 could continue but RTS ultimately decided it had been introduced last year as a pilot route, the only suburb to suburb route in their system, and that it was not economically feasible to continue it at this time.  I hope this clears up any concerns, I am confident that the services RIT will provide this fall will be as good, if not better than what RTS provided during the past 7 years.  If you have any concerns or questions, feel free to contact me directly.  Randy"
rit,387evv,RandyVercauteren,8,Tue Jun 2 21:27:54 2015 UTC,"I hope this new service has 60 foot buses, otherwise there definitely will not be enough room for all the students, especially in Province and Park Point."
rit,387evv,jk112,7,Tue Jun 2 23:08:06 2015 UTC,"Yes, the buses are the big transit buses, similar to what RTS utilized.  We sized the buses based on this past years ridership numbers.  The Province will also have the big double bus, just like this past year.  Park Point will have two buses during the peak ridership times of the day."
rit,387evv,RandyVercauteren,2,Wed Jun 3 00:50:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah I second this, thankfully im leaving park point. When they would run 2 double busses and they would almost fill up in park point, how is that going to be matched? Also, the loading and unloading is going to be far slower with only 1 door. Or the fact that these busses don't have the standing room RTS busses have.  This just sounds like a nightmare for everyone who relies on the bus system."
rit,387evv,maxim6194,2,Wed Jun 3 00:43:15 2015 UTC,"Also, there will be two doors on the bigger buses, just like the ones this past year."
rit,387evv,RandyVercauteren,3,Wed Jun 3 00:51:32 2015 UTC,Thanks a lot for your thorough replies here and on other posts Randy. It's nice seeing an RIT staff member addressing questions and concerns on this subreddit!
rit,387evv,Mkrah,1 point,Tue Jun 2 23:17:12 2015 UTC,"Hi Randy,  This is unrelated to the topic at hand, but a question I've been wondering about. Last year, I noticed that in the afternoons a Colony Manor- Perkins Green bus and a bus for only Perkins Green ran concurrently in the afternoons last year.  Out of curiosity, was there a reason for this?"
rit,387evv,odds_arrgh,1 point,Tue Jun 2 23:40:11 2015 UTC,"Hmm, not sure about this one.  We combined Colony and Perkins mid afternoon to reduce total buses on campus when demand starts to drop in the day.  Perhaps there was some overlap that was unintended for about an hour or so?  RTS had an unusual system of part time drivers and sometimes I noticed what appeared to be extra buses on campus, but it was overlapping schedules for driver exchanges."

rit,387evv,odds_arrgh,1 point,Wed Jun 3 20:31:29 2015 UTC,"I actually did try and call PATS a few times today, including your number directly, and I only kept getting an answering machine. But anyway, if you can really mirror and/or improve on the old 67 for the fall, I'd be willing to see that. The problem however, is the summer. I'm taking a class for the first five week term. I tried today, on a Tuesday, to get to Wegmans today. A torn shopping bag and some crushed groceries later, I can say this did not work out well.   What needs to change sooner is the route the Golden Memories buses are using. Whoever designed that schedule did not take into account where students would need to be picked up and dropped off. These buses do not stop at the Park Point North or South stops, just at Barnes and Noble, which is highly inconvenient for those of us who live in Park Point's 600s and 700s, and they do not run to Wegmans on the weekdays, only the West Mall side of Marketplace. RTS's ""RIT Weekend Shuttle"", to my knowledge, ran during the summer terms seven days a week. What's being used from now until the fall semester of 2015 needs to be fixed heavily."
rit,387evv,RandyVercauteren,3,Wed Jun 3 00:18:20 2015 UTC,"Thanks, we will need to look at this internally.  Feel free to email me if you want to discuss further.  I am out on campus a lot so I am not in my office to take calls very often."
rit,387evv,daarche,2,Wed Jun 3 00:58:06 2015 UTC,I also agree. During the week it is almost impossible for me to get to Wegmans by bus.  I like the bus schedule during the weekend because it does stop at Wegmans. Asides from this problem I feel the bus schedule during summer works better for me than in the fall. I live in the Riverknoll/UC area so I like the fact that the bus does stop in the UC/Riverknoll area.
rit,387evv,cyanwinters,2,Wed Jun 3 20:08:15 2015 UTC,Allegedly RIT is buying its own buses to replace RTS.  It sounds like a horrible idea and I hope it's not true.
rit,387evv,Home_Girl,2,Tue Jun 2 12:30:11 2015 UTC,"It's downright foolish is what it is. I've talked to RTS drivers, from what I understand they've tried this before, and RIT always comes crawling back begging for a new contract. I just made this petition in hopes of giving them a little nudge."
rit,387evv,scy1192,0,Tue Jun 2 13:22:53 2015 UTC,Good looking out...I did not hear of this news. I feel bad for the folks who depended on the #68. The Westbrooke Commons complex has a fair amount of RIT students who used that route.
rit,387evv,sdubois,3,Wed Jun 3 01:46:02 2015 UTC,"It sounds like it was RTS that pulled the plug, not RIT. Considering their disastrous transit center opening, they're probably pretty close to insolvency at this point... They just lost the contract for RCSD. They probably can't afford running a route through the suburbs anymore with everything running through their idiotic transit center now.   I have a hard time believing a private operator can do much worse than RGRTA, as long as they have the right sized buses. Public transit in this city is a joke.   If RIT ran its own buses rather than contracting them, that'd be a different story. That would be a disaster. You'd have three admins for every bus driver."

rit,387evv,SharpMind94,1 point,Wed Jun 3 03:51:22 2015 UTC,"Most people don't commute to downtown here, so by forcing all routes to terminate downtown, it means travel times are lengthened as everyone needs to make a transfer. They cut a lot of service to afford the transit center, including Route 68 in Henrietta."

rit,383t1l,impecuniousyouth,12,Mon Jun 1 17:30:30 2015 UTC,"Hi there thanks for asking.  Yes, the summer session parking rules become more flexible because we greatly reduce the transportation system servicing the RIT apartments and Park Point and The Province.  For General Parking, all valid RIT permits are acceptable: Resident Permit of any residence, After Hours permit, etc...  Reserve parking is still enforced from 5 AM to 5 PM Monday - Friday.  Handicap parking is enforced all the time, and fire lanes, non parking areas and such are also enforced all the time.  So, if you are here this summer with a car in RIT housing, Park Point, or The Province and have a parking permit for this year, you can park in general parking all summer until school begins in the fall.  Hope that helps."

rit,37v3o1,Pokebunny,11,Sat May 30 17:27:33 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'd recommend dabbling a bit in programming this summer, preferably python since that's what you'll be using. It helps if you're not completely blindsided by the logic and syntax required for programming. You can practice with codingbat.com or something similar or better yet pick a project that interests you and figure out how to do it."

The class focuses mainly on introducing you to various programming concepts and data structures, through python. Python as a language is pretty easy to read and understand, and the online documentation for it is phenomenal(seriously, take advantage of it). The hardest thing I've seen students overcome is the problem solving, as it really forces you to take these new concepts(there's something new each week) and prove your understanding of it. As long as you ask for help when needed and keep ahead of the homework load for it, you'll be fine. If you have any specific questions feel free to shoot me a message or respond here."

I was looking at the first course few courses online and the projects / labs that are included in each and was sort of taken back at the depth of the problems. I'm currently in a computer science program at a community college a few hours upstate from the city and none of the projects / labs we do even compare to the ones I seen listed on your sites.   I'm not saying the work seems impossible to do, I was just surprised at the depth of the course work.  You mentioned asking for help -- is there a tutoring center for CS that's free offered at your college? If so, what are the hours and how many students utilize it?  Thanks again!"
rit,37v3o1,MalignantPenumbra,1 point,Tue Jun 2 12:41:23 2015 UTC,"There is a tutoring center that's open close to 24/7. It's staffed by students, typically those who are already TAs and are very helpful with problem specifics. Their hours are strongest on Tuesday nights when labs are due, however you don't wanna be there then cause tons of students use the center.   Regarding the course difficulty, if you go in with some programming experience and an open mind, you can do well. The course is difficult for those just being introduced to programming, but you'll look back at it as being one of your easier courses."
rit,37v3o1,worsedoughnut,2,Tue Jun 2 22:03:07 2015 UTC,"If you wanna poke around in the language (python) try some of the courses at Code Academy. Just realize that Comp Sci II won't use the same language, so try to learn more about programming in general, rather than memorizing python's syntax."

To preface, our class was flying with 3 Phantom 2's fitted with GoPro Hero 4 Black cameras, one DJI Inspire 1, and we were building a fixed wing.  Normally, the current rules for drones are that below 400 feet, you can do whatever you want (without invading private property or privacy, etc), since that's considered uncontrolled airspace, which was how the class was operating. However, we were informed by campus safety about a month ago that they had been told by the FAA in November that all UAS operation was illegal on campus due to our proximity to the airport, and didn't deign to tell us for 5 months. Thanks campo, I love violating federal law.   So the rule that's caused this email to be sent means that basically, within 5 miles, all airspace is considered controlled, all the way down to sea level.   So, effectively, there's nothing RIT can really do about this except to send an email out letting students know about this rule - I wish they'd worded it better since it does sound like a knee-jerk reaction to drones from the RIT administration. I think they sent it to us because we're probably the ones most likely to fly drones.   It's a damn shame honestly, the aerial class produced some stunning images of the campus - but there's nothing to be done until new regulations come into effect.   Edit: Shameless plug, we're selling a set of 3D views of campus from the air at Shop One in GV."
rit,37gtwo,nerdpox,12,Wed May 27 15:24:01 2015 UTC,For future reference look at this map before flying. RIT has been in a no fly zone for a long time. https://www.mapbox.com/drone/no-fly/
rit,37gtwo,TheHeadHoncho,3,Wed May 27 17:37:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah we've been pointed to this. The issue sort of arose because we were given the go ahead by administration and told by some official (not sure on details) that we were okay and then months later campus safety was like ""OH YEAH BY THE WAY"" - kind of a head desk moment."
rit,37gtwo,nerdpox,-1,Wed May 27 18:18:42 2015 UTC,"The administration could say you can fly on campus, but its still illegal, and has been for years now."

rit,37gtwo,nerdpox,-2,Thu May 28 02:34:37 2015 UTC,"It just baffles me that people are complaining and saying this is RITs fault. It really has nothing todo with RIT. If you are going to own and/or use one, you should know where its legal and illegal to fly it. RITs ban has no effect on drone flights, as they were already illegal to fly on campus, all it allows for is campus safety to write you a ticket for something federally illegal."
rit,37gtwo,TheHeadHoncho,2,Thu May 28 02:43:26 2015 UTC,"This isn't an ""RIT ban""; this is RIT finally informing students and faculty of the FAA's ban."

rit,37gtwo,TheHeadHoncho,1 point,Thu May 28 20:46:38 2015 UTC,"Can you send me a link to the law prohibiting model aircraft/drone from operating within 5 miles of an airport?  I know of the rule but have been able to find a law preventing the use.  According to what I have read the operator of the model aircraft simply needs to inform the control tower and airport of the usage.  (i.e. time/place/intended use of operation).  Am I wrong?  EDIT I think I found the exact wording of the FAA statute referencing Drone Regulations  https://www.faa.gov/uas/media/Sec_331_336_UAS.pdf  (5) when flown within 5 miles of an airport, the operator of the aircraft provides the airport operator and the airport air traffic control tower (when an air traffic facility is located at the airport) with prior notice of the operation (model aircraft operators flying from a permanent location within 5 miles of an airport should establish a mutually-agreed upon operating procedure with the airport operator and the airport air traffic control tower (when an air traffic facility is located at the airport))."
rit,37gtwo,rabid_android,2,Fri May 29 02:41:58 2015 UTC,So people can fly them but RIT doesn't trust students to follow procedure so they're baning them outright?
rit,37gtwo,alixer,1 point,Fri May 29 04:29:42 2015 UTC,"The ban extends to faculty, staff, and even coursework so I think it has more to do with liability than with trust.

rit,37gtwo,yamugushi,2,Thu May 28 18:08:22 2015 UTC,"Have you ever watched flight traffic around the Rochester airport? While the commercial aircraft tend to follow a handful of specific patterns, the civil aircraft, which fly low over campus, can enter or leave the pattern from just about any direction. That doesn't consider an in-flight emergency when all concepts of a ""pattern"" are out the window. Additionally, if they are vectoring around weather the pattern may be altered to include overflight of the campus."

rit,37gtwo,WTF_Tigers,0,Thu May 28 09:49:56 2015 UTC,Could you use a tether to prevent malfunction? Technically it isn't unmanned at that point because you have a piece of string attached to you. It could be hooked up to a fishing reel or something to pull it back in the case of an emergency.
rit,37gtwo,comptiger5000,10,Thu May 28 02:33:13 2015 UTC,"This was probably always an issue, but nobody had  really talked about it before.  I'm pretty sure we're close enough to the airport for there to be restrictions in effect."
rit,37gtwo,burgerboy9n,3,Thu May 28 11:36:07 2015 UTC,"Sure but under 400 feet surely airplanes aren't there, how could a drone interfere?"
rit,37gtwo,robshookphoto,8,Wed May 27 15:10:00 2015 UTC,"They've only recently begun easing restrictions on cell phones in airplanes. The FAA operates under a ""ban now, logic later"" policy."
rit,37gtwo,first_name_steve,2,Wed May 27 22:59:19 2015 UTC,The economics of regulations encourage this type of behavior. If you are a regulator and you allow something to happens that turns out to be an amazing idea then the most you get is a pat on the back however if you allow something bad to happen you can lose your job and more. Regulators don't have the incentive to make the best decisions they are charged with making most risk averse decisions.
rit,37gtwo,comptiger5000,2,Thu May 28 01:10:53 2015 UTC,"In the event of an accidental loss of control that caused the drone to ascend.  Airplanes do fly fairly low when close to airports, so it wouldn't be nearly as hard to get in the way as it would elsewhere."
rit,37gtwo,jkjustjoshing,8,Thu May 28 02:55:37 2015 UTC,Just last night at the corporate challenge there was a drone taking video of the opening ceremonies and the start.

rit,37gtwo,comptiger5000,13,Thu May 28 00:09:47 2015 UTC,"They haven't been allowed this close to an airport for quite a while, RIT just never bothered to mention this to their students / faculty / staff."

rit,37gtwo,DingedUpDiveHelmet,5,Thu May 28 02:44:45 2015 UTC,"Rochester airport is class C airspace which means that it is controlled down to the ground from 1200ft agl in a 5 mile radius around the airport. All UAVS are restricted in this airspace. There is another layer from 1200ft agl to a specified height that continues the airspace. I think it is idiotic for the faa to nitpick drone flights by buildings like this, but bureaucracy and new technology do not mix. Hopefully the faa fixes this when they release drone rules in 2016."

rit,37gtwo,drphillycheesesteak,3,Wed May 27 15:10:14 2015 UTC,I would assume so.  It's an unmanned aircraft.
rit,37gtwo,sdubois,2,Wed May 27 15:10:54 2015 UTC,"Yes, unless it has a tether or a pilot on it, it's considered unmanned."

rit,37gtwo,ghostofrit,4,Wed May 27 15:35:24 2015 UTC,They can fly way further than you can see them... and if you have a more powerful antenna setup they can easily fly for miles in many directions.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vN5fc2iceo

rit,37gtwo,xb4r7x,1 point,Wed May 27 18:55:48 2015 UTC,yeah but you could also hook it up to a satellite up-link and fly it around the planet. This is less of a question on whats technically possible and what is practically feasible. For example: a standard parrot AR Drone has a range of 100 feet which means you would be pushing your luck just to land on top of Ellingson.
rit,37gtwo,rabid_android,1 point,Wed May 27 19:24:37 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately for your argument parrot doesn't have much market share in the rtf drone industry. Nobody is buying WiFi drones...  The best seller is the phantom which operates in the 2.4 Ghz spectrum and has an effective range of farrrrrrrrr more than 100 ft.  This situation is unfortunately one where technology moves faster than government, so until the rules can be revised to fit the current tech atmosphere we have to live with what we've got."
rit,37gtwo,drphillycheesesteak,2,Wed Jun 3 04:59:47 2015 UTC,"From my understanding of the FAA Drone Online Guide recommends the 5 mile distance from airports as a guideline and not an enforceable rule.  I was under the impression that the FAA didn't have the authority to regulate the use of model aircraft (which drones have been classified as for legal purposes).    I think that RIT has the responsibility and authority (private property) to ask the RIT community to respect our proximity to the airport but the FAA doesn't have legal power over the operation of model aircraft (at least according to the articles I have seen).  And actually the exact wording of the FAA regulations requests that anyone within 5 miles of the airport inform the airport that a drone is being operated in the area.  It would seem that RIT could easily designate itself as a ""Drone Zone"".  Am I correct in my understanding of the FAA rules?  https://www.faa.gov/uas/model_aircraft/  PLEASE NOTE I am not a laywer and am posing this argument in the form of a question but is it my understanding that the FAA doesn't have authority over RIT but RIT chose to be respectful of the guidelines (for some fairly obvious reasons)."
rit,37gtwo,emepror,5,Wed Jun 3 12:01:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah, so this has been an issue for a while and it was just recently that I think we got on the FAA's radar, which is why the word came down that drones are off-limits at RIT. The big issue is that we're so close to the airport. Further away, recreational use is OK, but we're just too close. However, I hear that we'll be getting an enclosed test range for drone flights. All I can find online about this is here, http://nuairalliance.org/facilities/, but from what I've heard, it will be a large range enclosed by a net. I'm not sure what the max altitude will be under the net."

rit,37gtwo,nerdpox,9,Sat May 30 00:49:09 2015 UTC,What's unreasonable is not allowing what is pretty much glorified RC helicopters to fly lower than the height of most buildings at RIT. They specifically stated any size or any altitude. Which means even a quadcoptor flying 10 feet in the air is technically breaking federal law. This kills tons of projects. It would be more reasonable to not allow any autonomous aircraft past a certain height lets say the height of Building 1.
rit,37gtwo,CommanderCuntPunt,8,Wed May 27 15:10:44 2015 UTC,"This was my issue with the rule, honestly. If you're flying a drone within Kodak Quad it's not like a plane is going to show up 100 feet over campus, and if it does, it's about to crash."
rit,37gtwo,xb4r7x,3,Wed May 27 15:27:37 2015 UTC,"Oh wow I missed that part, that's absolutely ridiculous, if a plane is flying below the height of the buildings there's bigger issues than a quad copter."
rit,37gtwo,dtfgator,0,Wed May 27 15:33:52 2015 UTC,That's not the issue though... the issue is that RITs campus happens to be within a 5 mile radius of a major airport. Go a litter further away and you're welcome to fly as you'd please.
rit,37gtwo,drphillycheesesteak,3,Wed May 27 15:35:31 2015 UTC,"I'm not into drones either, but this law is just plain (plane, hah) stupid.  Restricting elevation to be no more than the height of nearby buildings makes perfect sense, but outright banning something that is no more dangerous to plans than someone throwing a football in the air is just silly.  There are lots of potentially awesome projects and research that could be hindered by this."
rit,37gtwo,Aeleas,-1,Wed May 27 15:46:37 2015 UTC,"Not at all. One of these things could have a guidance system glitch or a malfunctioning altimeter, which could cause the thing to ascend beyond where you intended it to be. Since we're so close to an airport, there is a real risk of a collision with a larger aircraft. The regulations exist for a reason. Unless there is a tether on the craft or a physical barrier, then the risk is real."

rit,37dfmn,Pokebunny,5,Wed May 27 02:23:46 2015 UTC,"'Sup.   One quick thing to clear up first- immersions are liberal arts-specific, so a web of business minor won't satisfy that requirement.   As for the web minor for computing majors: it's off-limits for IT majors, but not for networking majors on the 2014 and earlier worksheets (check with Betty or myself to see what year you're following). You can ""double dip"" two major courses with the minor. Web I and database are those two courses for you; as long as you don't choose the concentration with Web II in it, you're fine.   But if you want something more business-oriented, I agree that entrepreneurship or digital business would be solid options. Peter Rosenthal in the College of Business can help with business minor options. And going back to the immersion: economics would be a nice complement to the business courses.     If you want more information on your options, email Betty or myself (Matt.Lake@rit.edu)."

rit,371qfq,simpsonsqwerty,10,Sun May 24 01:24:08 2015 UTC,"Ok, here we go:  Weather:  Bring a heavy coat.  Last winter was one of our worst seasons, it was above freezing for about 6 hours in the entire month of February.  Also get a rain jacket, your umbrella won't survive a week.    CS:  I'm a CE but I did have to take the intro sequence and I know a fair number of people in CS.  The intro sequence is TOUGH.  It's basically designed to weed out anyone who isn't dedicated to the major.  If you do poorly, I'd suggest looking at another major.  I hear the upper level classes are well taught and give you a good chance to specialize, can't say for myself though.  Food:  Gracie's is pretty meh, but at least it's consistent.  Definitely better than a lot of other schools.  There are a lot of options on campus, but they're not at all worth going to unless you're on a meal plan.  Really overpriced.  Lettuce Gay Bacon Tomato :  RIT's really open-minded, don't worry about coming out.  When I came out reactions ranged from ""oh, didn't expect that"" to ""k, das cool.""  Also there's RITGA, I went to a meeting but it wasn't my scene.  People:  Most people here, baring the people who bike/longboard on the quarter mile during peak hours, are not assholes.    Other thing:  To put your social life on easy mode, look at joining a Special Interest House.  I was on E-House and I had an amazing time, made a lot of good friends.

The intro sequence is tough for many people, but if you can make it through that the rest isn't too bad.

I'm personally majoring in Network and Systems Administration, and that's also pretty difficult.   Basically, as long as you are either a Magic player or a gamer, it'll be fine."
rit,371qfq,Rienuaa,4,Sun May 24 13:48:42 2015 UTC,"CS vs SE: Pick CS if you want tech skills on a slightly lower level on the stack, e.g, the major requires a course in Operating Systems, for example. CS will also expose you to more theoretical topics such as Turing Machines. SE is a bit more about the concrete. SE is concerned with the process and project management software development, and heavily focused on group project experiences, e.g., the human component to software development (technical skills alone are not enough to create useful software). You will still learn top-notch technical skills in SE, but it is also more focused on the design on subsystems that work together to make larger systems. In real life employment, both will open fairly over-lapping set of doors with companies (e.g., if a company is looking for SE grads, they'll also be looking for CS, and so forth). If you think graduate school would be something for you, you'd probably want CS. Very few SE students go onto grad school and most who come back around after graduation say they are doing fine with just a bachelor's. Weather: It mostly sucks imo, but it helps me focus on my academics. I've had friends go places with nicer weather and not do too well in school... Not sure if that's causation on correlation, but I'm probably biased in my observations. Don't be like me and try and wear sneakers through winter my freshman year. Actually layer and be smart about it, and it's not too bad if you know how to dress appropriately for it. On the flip side, the fall and springtime here to be quite enjoyable, albeit they are short-lived during the academic year. LGBT: As a fairly mainstream G person, I didn't see much of a need to get involved with the on-campus groups. The Major Student Organization for the LGBT community suffered from some leadership issues in the past year. But to be honest, I didn't see a need for it personally. I've never been given any problems being gay. I have observed substantial issues for trans students here, but they would prevalent at virtually any school today (the school is putting in a good effort to make it better for those who don't use their legal names). Food. People's opinion vary so much by what is considered 'good'. So it's hard to speak to it. However, I have been told that RIT is definitely better than most other colleges."

And I say this as a heat-fobic southerner who has religiously had the AC set to 69 from March-November my entire life, lol. As for the winter, I'm from Atlanta and had never experienced real, staysfordays snow before moving here and not only did I drive in it with relatively no problem (couple of spin out scares due to shitty summer tires, but nothing proper tires won't cure). Honestly it didn't bother me at all and I didn't get the hoopla. Rochester is pretty awesome at plowing! With that said I always erred on the side of caution and refused to drive to campus when I felt like it was unsafe.. Maybe once or twice in a semester.  CS: No clue, I'm a photo major.  People: Mostly friendly! Honestly, even the Greek life is not like most places. You're always going to have your assholes, but unlike high school, they don't usually pop up in clusters here, at least in my experience.  Food: It's edible but as someone who was lucky enough to always live off campus, I never had a meal plan (thank the gods) and so never got sick of Gracies, having only been there a handful of time with friends. I will say this... Fuck debit and meal options, after your first year, don't get a meal plan at all. It is FAR FAR cheaper to use actual real life grown up money than to give RIT your real money and get fake money back to use only on campus.  LGBT: Very open and accepting campus.

What gets deleted: All of your grades, class attendance, RIT emails, Google documents, housing records, parking records, on-campus employment records, student financial statements, admissions records, and even those initials you carved on that tree in the woods that one time you were coming back from that UC party while drunk during your first year.   In addition, all of your professors, classmates, and friends will be brought to a secret room underneath the Sentinel where they will have all memory of you wiped from their minds.   You will NOT receive a refund on your tuition, though. You will have to reapply and start over as a freshman and this includes eating Gracies and doing FYE for the full first year.

He will go out of his way to help you if you seek out his help. He isn't great about getting back to you through emails, so just visit him during office hours. Make sure that you have a solid understand of OOP going into 121, and make sure that you keep coding during the summer so you don't get stale. Even something little like doing a few CodingBat exercises everyday will help tremendously."
rit,36r1az,patput,1 point,Fri May 22 16:48:58 2015 UTC,"I took ISTE 121 with Floeser in Spring 2014. I found it significantly harder than 120 because I had already learned most of the 120 material in AP Compsci, while all the 121 material was new to me. The projects are on a larger scale than anything in 120, but they are not exceedingly hard if you keep up.  My advice would just be KEEP UP WITH WHAT YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO KNOW. More than in 120, you will rely on things you have learned early in the semester to complete your final projects. If you BS your way through the homework about a certain topic (look up answers, avoid parts you don't understand) you will struggle with the project.   Good luck! It's a great class and you will learn a lot if you put the work in. Floeser is a smart guy and will definitely help you if you ask him, but you have to show you are willing to put effort in."

RIT needs to build some real apartments that'll compete with the other student housing in the area and have more dining locations open late and then I bet you they'd make money."

rit,36mfwi,RamekinOfRanch,2,Wed May 20 16:27:02 2015 UTC,"They are nice, but they're pretty old and outdated for the off campus offerings elsewhere. Ethan Pointe is something like 1899/m and you can rent a 4 bedroom house for another hundred bucks. Living in a house, provided you don't mind the drive/worse internet is much better than being on campus because it's simply a nicer more modern living environment.

rit,36mfwi,XpL0d3r,1 point,Wed May 20 20:14:40 2015 UTC,"I graduated in 2012, not 10 years ago. RK is old, but $1900 a month elsewhere is stupid expensive, especially while you're paying big $$$ for college. You're pretty much paying for an overpriced version of Providence with better internet. I've lived in KN, Providence, and I had actually rented a 4 BR house just off E Henrietta (for $1470). While a house definitely has its perks over a place like KN (aka a yard, garage, etc), KN was so cheap and convenient that it was worth it while I was there.   While living in KN, I saved money and spent it on my car. I still have my car, and I no longer live in Henrietta, soo the money I saved living shitty back then is completely worth it to me now lol.  Plus, back when camp didn't give a fuck, my ex would through lingerie parties there, and campo would constantly walk by, but never shut them down. Who wants to be that guy who closes down a party filled with scantily clad women? No one haha."
rit,36mfwi,RamekinOfRanch,1 point,Wed May 20 21:28:45 2015 UTC,"The places that are something 1899/m and so forth are apartments so it ends being between 400-650 per person depending on where. Living off camps in a year long lease also tends to make more sense if you co-op in the area. I do understand what you're saying.

rit,36puu4,xLindsAfurdx,4,Thu May 21 04:09:33 2015 UTC,"Graduating CS student, current Googler (and past Google intern). I can provide some answers even though I'm not SE.   1) Do you need any prior knowledge to major in SE? I have taken one C++ course at my high school and I loved it! I'm also planning to take another one next year.   No, but it certainly doesn't hurt. I took APCS in high school and was just fine, and there are others with no experience that were also fine. If you're willing to put in the time to get over the initial learning curve, you'll be fine.   2) Even if no prior knowledge is required is there anything I should try to learn on my own over the summer? (Languages, etc.)   It would be great to just wrap your head around coding in general. It seems a lot of freshmen have trouble with simple abstractions. Running through exercises on http://codingbat.com or Project Euler would go a long way.   3) Is there anything you wish you knew before coming to RIT? I have done some research and have toured the campus and have loved everything so far but I would like a real student's perspective. (Not someone trying to sell the campus)   ¯\(ツ)/¯   4) What are co-op interviews like? I know big companies like Google and Microsoft actively recruit from RIT and I would love to hear any experiences you might have had.   They generally ask you some sort of algorithms question, and you answer it. They might ask you to find a more efficient/faster way to solve it. They might add extra constraints such as limited memory, can't use certain data structures, etc.   5) Are there any specific minors recommend for SE majors?   Minor doesn't really affect much, it should just be something you find interesting. That being said, I'd strongly encourage you to take as many CS courses as electives as you can. Certain courses like algorithms, compilers, systems programming, etc. can be hugely educational.   6) What is the course load like? Some people say it's awful and others say that as long as you don't procrastinate you'll be fine. Please don't sugar-coat anything. I can handle the truth ;)   Some semesters can be goddamn brutal, but for the most part it's reasonable. If you're responsible and stay on top of things it will be fine. I had quarters where I took 5 CS courses and survived simply because of effective time management.   7) What is the male to female ratio in CSH?   lol   8) I could use some input here ladies... How do you feel about the coed floors? Would you recommend a single sex floor? I'm just not sure. (I'm thinking that it might be nice to be around some estrogen after being surrounded by guys all day in class)   Not a lady, but many of the ladies I've spoken to that lived on single sex floors disliked it and said it fostered a sort of.. elitist attitude.   9) GCCIS students, what kind of side projects have you participated in? Do you feel like these projects make you stand out against everyone else? Or just eat up your time?   I honestly didn't have many side projects in school, most of what I did was small scripts for making administration of my own system a lot easier, or prototyping different crypto algorithms (a lot of what I studied focused on cryptography). I never listed any of the side projects I did complete on my resume, and it never came up in any interviews.. so it didn't make me stand out at all. :) That being said, for some people it does help. Also, a lot of students run into the situation where they do let it eat up all of their time, which negatively impacts their GPA substantially, and ultimately hurts their chance at a sweet co-op/job even though they have that cool project. So, projects can help, but if you remember that your main priority should be classes/school, it should be fine.   10) Is a masters worth the money? Or should I just get a job and maybe think about it later?   It depends on what you're looking for. For me, I wanted to continue my education in a very specific area (cryptography), so it was worth it to me. If all you're looking for is a bigger paycheck, I don't think it's worth it. The increase in my base salary was $5,000 compared to if I didn't have an MS, which certainly doesn't make up for the time in school and costs incurred as a result. However, it was worth it to me personally."
rit,36puu4,Liam_Galt,2,Thu May 21 04:31:15 2015 UTC,"7) What is the male to female ratio in CSH? lol   Our f:m ratio is better than that of GCCIS last time I checked. It is by no means 1:1, but it isn't 10:1 either.  EDIT: I'm having a bad time with boilerplate"

rit,36hrbg,Kaffleen,9,Tue May 19 14:25:27 2015 UTC,"Take those summer classes at a community college instead. If you do well in them, it'll give you a confidence boost for the fall, and you'll have something to show your parents that you're serious about college. If you do poorly, maybe you're better off going home, taking a break from RIT, and working a shitty job for a semester or two while you get your shit together. Just make sure you get the credits pre-approved by the College of Liberal Arts or whatever college is relevant to the courses you're taking.  Sorry if I'm being blunt or pessimistic. It sounds like you're trying to pull it together, which leads me to believe you'll probably be fine in the end. However, this school is really expensive, and if you can't make it at a community college, you're not going to make it in CS at RIT, and I've watched a few of my acquaintances set their  money on fire by staying at RIT when they clearly weren't cut out for it. Talking to your advisor is definitely a good idea, though."
rit,36hrbg,Snowflare182,3,Tue May 19 15:36:17 2015 UTC,"Great advice here - I went through a similar situation way back when (2000)....I started out as a CS major mainly because I ""liked computers"" and had done a little programming. Turned out I hated actual CS (and didn't have the study habits I needed), so I crashed pretty spectacularly and was on track to more or less fail out after the first year.  Talked with an advisor and did a lot of soul-searching and discussions with my parents that summer, and eventually decided I was going to switch majors to IT...which unfortunately was already full up with the next incoming class, so I ended up taking a 1-year LOA to get my shit together and take classes at the community college near home.  Got said shit together by the end of that year (took as many courses relevant to the new major as possible), went back to RIT much happier and armed with some transfer credits, and ended up graduating in 2005 with very close to a 3.0 GPA.  So yeah, it really is possible to pull things back together, but you need to want it deeply, and then plan the hell out of it and buckle down."

Along with those, you continue to take a couple classes from your current program (assuming you want to stay in your program) or from a different program that you are interested in.  It's not the end for you.  People understand that things happen.  It might not seem like it sometimes, but there are people out there who want to help you."

For me personally, my first year was the roughest of the four. Something just clicked in the middle of the second year and programming among other technologies started to make more sense.  So it is possible that things may come easier to you in your next year."

Either one will require you to return any equipment of TWCs that you currently have to their area office. The catch is, with a seasonal hold, they charge $5 per month to have a hold on it. The benefit of it is that you can call them when you want service on again and all they have to do is flip a switch. If you close out the account, you just have to give them a call a week or so before moving back in and they will schedule someone to come out and reactivate service at the nearest cable pole."

You get all the basics of a vertical end mill and a lathe in a two-hour class period once a week. As far as clubs, the Baja team does a lot with these machines, and if you stick around you'll probably have the opportunity to learn CNC or Welding as well. However, that is a fair time commitment, but if you feel like living in the shop between building car parts and your personal things then by all means. In metal machining, you definitely want to learn the basics from someone before trying to figure anything out on your own, especially if you've never used a certain machine before, namely for the health and well being of the machines. For example, on a lathe you change the speed while it's off, and on a mill while it's running. If you don't know this, or learn one and assume the same for the other, you could seriously fuck up the machine. And believe me, the noise will let you know when you've messed it up. At least get the basics, and ask someone if there's a tool or technique to do certain things if down the road you find a scenario where you're not sure what to do.  Best of luck!"
rit,36bcal,silentknight295,2,Mon May 18 02:15:28 2015 UTC,"Thank you very much for the info! MFET-105 seems like exactly what I'm looking for. According to SIS, it's only available to specific majors, but I'll talk to my advisor and see what he says my options are.  I may check out Baja team as well, since it sounds like I'd be able to get experience working on real parts with people there to help out if I have questions. Do you know if they're active during the summer? I'm co-oping locally this summer, and it sounds like a great evening/weekend activity.  Those machine nuances you mention are a great example of what I'm looking to learn; I'd like to keep the expensive equipment (as well as my eyes and hands) in good shape.  Thanks again for the help!"
rit,36bcal,silentknight295,2,Mon May 18 02:45:59 2015 UTC,"As far as I'm aware, there's not much going on with Baja over the summer, but I haven't been a part of the team for over a year, so at this point, who knows? I know they have meetings Tuesday nights around 9 (maybe 8, I don't remember) at the machine shop in Slaughter hall. Poke around there a little at pretty much any time and you're bound to find someone who can actually answer your questions. There's pretty much always somebody hanging around."

You might be able to try and mill some copper clad on the CNC, but it'd be a massive hassle in general, and you'd have to manually plug and solder vias with wire.    Your best bet is to use a service like OshPark or SeeedStudio if you need cheap, or Sunstone Circuits / Advanced Circuits if you need speed and quality."

rit,35yq1g,Yuomao5,-1,Thu May 14 19:14:51 2015 UTC,In what way would this be illegal?  I'd like to think RIT's scam of mandatory food debit would be closer to being illegal.
rit,35yq1g,ritkid789,7,Thu May 14 18:34:45 2015 UTC,"RIT's ""scam"" is based around New York State mandates. NYS requires students living in residence halls to have a meal plan. RIT offers debit plans because NYS allows purchases of food or drink from a pre-paid debit account to be tax exempt. This is why a few years ago RIT stopped allowing the purchase of non-food/drink items on debit. NYS mandates that it doesn't roll over, ergo, it doesn't at RIT."
rit,35yq1g,Yuomao5,3,Thu May 14 19:27:16 2015 UTC,"I'd be more than grateful if you pointed me to that law.  There is absolutely nothing about any ""mandatory food debit while in Res Halls"" law online.    The closest thing I could find was talking about how meal plans can't be refunded or rolled over but that wasn't the point of my statement.    RIT uses that law as a springboard and forces you to buy a debit plan which they know A) Won't be used entirely and B) Can't be refunded by law.  It's a scam."
rit,35yq1g,TheCommonsRIT,3,Thu May 14 23:09:15 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure why you think RIT believes that it won't be used entirely. As someone who sees people's debit balances all day there are plenty of people who ran out of debit a week or more ago. The minimum is set so that the people who are, shall we say, less skilled at budgeting don't run through all of their debit early in the semester and get stuck with no way to purchase food later on. It still happens of course but there is SOME protection."
rit,35yq1g,Yuomao5,2,Fri May 15 02:29:34 2015 UTC,"Because it's compulsory to have debit.  There is absolutely no need for it.  It's not like you magically gain the ability to better manage money at year 2.  The way I see it the current system really only aids RIT.  Which is fine because they're a business but it's also a scam.  Debit should be an option for all years, there should be no tier system and it certainly shouldn't require the use of Gracies for first year students."
rit,35yq1g,TheCommonsRIT,1 point,Fri May 15 11:14:36 2015 UTC,"Chances are your parents are paying your bills. Parents want to be sure that their children don't starve while at school. When their children do run through all of their debit and are then no longer able to buy food on campus what do you think those parents do? They call RIT and complain saying that RIT should have told them initially that their child was going to need more money for food. How does RIT respond to this? They raise the minimum amount of debit required. There is a tier system to try to accommodate the individual needs of students, it provides options. Requiring students to eat at Gracie's provides a number of useful functions for first year students like forcing socialization, and improving the chances that they will eat something other than Mountain Dew. You have to understand that, though technically adults, many people don't arrive at college with the necessary life skills to take care of themselves and the current system is designed to help them as they learn to do that, or at least enough to keep the parents satisfied. Yes, the university is a business. It's the higher education business though, not the restaurant business. Dining Services is not a major profit generator for the university, that's not how RIT makes it's money. Any profits from Dining Services after all of their own overhead is accounted for is consumed in giving back to financial aid, essentially helping to pay for people to attend RIT. Paying for people to come here, the opposite of making money."

Similar arrangements, but the lease is arranged so that you're out by the end of the semester rather than having to find a sublease or paying for time you don't live there. In addition, the internet's a lot better (you're on RIT's network) and you can go wireless (you have to buy your own router if you want to do that at PP unless they improved the infrastructure)."
rit,35u9c5,paperboat22,10,Fri May 15 21:49:37 2015 UTC,"UC is on campus Internet, park point is on some other provider. From what I've heard, park point's Internet is not good at all and some people have serious problems with it. I have friends who's apartment Internet works roughly 3 days a week, if that (they are constantly on the phone with tech support).  Overall, I would not suggest living at park point. They were pretty good before they were bought by american campus communities but they seem to be going downhill really fast. If you have a car, look further off campus, there's a lot of places around for way cheaper that are way better."

Besides, if you're willing to pay $75/mo, they offer 500 Mbps now and $100/mo for 1 Gbps. Greenlight > RIT.   Also, in case you haven't noticed, RIT's WiFi has been shitting the bed this semester. I don't suspect it'll get any better next year, since I have a feeling it's related to IPv4 address exhaustion."

PP/Province cost as much for shitty, cheaply-built student housing as the luxury lofts downtown per person. It's really the cost that's the important part. Look on padmapper and see what rents go for around here. Save the thousand-dollar rents for when you graduate and move to a real city.  For reference, I'm moving next month to my own apartment with no roommates on Park Ave for $600/mo for rent and utilities combined. It's a very small studio, probably the size of two or three dorm rooms put together, but it's just me, so who cares?"

If you go in the high rises the higher floors have a nice view but you'll get stuck on long rides on elevators that always break down.   There's always special interest housing (CSH, photo house, etc.) and those floors obviously attract people who are interested in whatever the specific floor is for, but every other floor is just a toss up really."

I never lived there, but as far as I'm aware Ellingson has suite style rooms, so you'll share a bathroom with 3 (I think) other rooms rather than have a few shared bathrooms for the whole floor.

The elevator rides could be a pain in the ass but the view was absolutely amazing, especially in the winter. I genuinely miss it at times. I saw that you were NTID cross enrolled, as well, so Ellingson would also be a good bet as it has a large amount of Hard-of-hearing and deaf students, as well as hearing. It's the biggest dorm."

rit,35jthc,LtPowers,4,Tue May 12 05:31:26 2015 UTC,"Location is irrelevant. The residence halls are all grouped together on one end of campus and connected with tunnels. Unless you're taking NTID classes in the LBJ building, the differences in walking times between your dorm and class are essentially negligible.  Sure, if you're in Ellingson you've got farther to go to get to Gracie's. Big deal.  My understanding is that because most upperclassman don't stay in the dorms, no dorm acquires any long-term reputation. More than half the population cycles in and out every year, so there's no continuity, and thus no unique cultures.  (The Special Interest Houses, of course, are the exceptions that prove the rule.)  About the only thing you can say about one dorm over another is that Ellingson, Peterson, and Res Hall D (nee Bell) will have more deaf students. Whether you consider that a plus or not depends on your openness to (and tolerance for) other cultures. In general, it's a plus, but if you have a sensitivity to strobe lights, avoid it."

rit,35jthc,jimbobtheanon,1 point,Mon May 11 02:33:14 2015 UTC,Yeah NTID offices didn't put a lot of services as necessary for me to have but having a strobe light was one of the necessary things they said I need. I'm leaning towards Ellingson mainly because I like the idea of only sharing a bathroom with three dorms. Do you know how the dorms are arranged on the floor? I assume they arent just in a straight line down the hallway...
rit,35jthc,itsnickk,2,Mon May 11 12:06:13 2015 UTC,"Those of us with RIT accounts can view floor plans on the web site but we're not allowed to share them. I can tell you that a standard Ellingson floor has eight groups of three rooms each that each share a full bath. There are also two single rooms on each floor with private baths (these were, until the mid-90s, RA rooms; they may be again for all I know). Two lounges are on each floor, along with two large rooms-that-used-to-be-lounge-space. Each floor also has a study room.  The hallway is indeed perfectly straight; look at the building and you'll see why. Within each suite of three rooms, one opens directly into the hall and has its own bathroom door; the other two have a very small foyer connecting their doors, the other bathroom door, and the hall door."

rit,35jthc,itsnickk,0,Mon May 11 13:52:34 2015 UTC,"Buildings definitely get a long term reputation. Certain factors like the size of the building, the type of rooms they have, their proximity to other buildings, special floors, and the professional reslife staff all shape the way a building will be.   As an example, Ellingson always seems to have the most fire alarms. This is probably because it's the largest and maybe also partly because of the suite style rooms."

rit,35g4y6,elflearu0463,17,Sun May 10 00:55:03 2015 UTC,How about come in try focusing on one major hope you like it as much as you think you are going to.  Then by second year if you think you're good start thinking about a second major.
rit,35g4y6,CaptainConsent,5,Sun May 10 00:56:18 2015 UTC,"Follow this, I didn't do physics here (I transferred from SUNY Geneseo) but one thing that I noticed was people taking intro level physics classes overwhelmed themselves because they double majored too early and ended up dropping physics. Try focusing on CS first then work youre way over to physics. Youll have to take it anyways in your second year."
rit,35g4y6,Aceuniverse,3,Sun May 10 01:11:25 2015 UTC,I'm sure they were just overwhelmed because physics classes are awful at RIT (which applies even to single major students)
rit,35g4y6,CyberBot129,2,Mon May 11 03:03:13 2015 UTC,"I was talking from my perspective at Geneseo. I've heard physics is terrible here but, then again, physics is terrible everywhere."
rit,35g4y6,Aceuniverse,6,Mon May 11 11:22:12 2015 UTC,"I was thinking about doing the same thing coming in, but I didn't like the Physics department here. I went with Imaging Science instead as a double."
rit,35g4y6,drphillycheesesteak,3,Sun May 10 02:21:47 2015 UTC,"I would also suggest checking out imaging sci. One of the smallest programs on campus (undergrad-wise), but one of RIT's best."
rit,35g4y6,Clamjamham,4,Sun May 10 18:23:52 2015 UTC,Good to see the physics department hasn't improved at RIT in years.
rit,35g4y6,dxk3355,3,Sun May 10 08:42:05 2015 UTC,"It seems like you mostly want to do CS, but if you are interested in physics, I'd recommend not doing both CS and physics, unless you want to graduate a few years late. Physics and computational math would probably be a better combination in terms of similar subject material; a few of my friends were double majors in those. I'd also echo the advice other people have given and say it's probably best to try one major for at least a semester before trying to overload yourself with too many classes.  To shamelessly plug my own major, we do have a great physics program here. Unlike some horror stories I've heard of other departments here, or physics programs elsewhere, our department actually seems to genuinely care about feedback from students, and is constantly trying to improve the program. The upper level classes are fantastic, and all of the professors who teach them are enthusiastic about their subject. We also have a fairly close-knit community among our majors. There is that ~10-20% retention rate by 4th year to worry about, though. If you like the idea of learning more math than anyone has any business knowing, and also don't mind 30+ hours of homework a week by senior year, I'd still highly recommend it.  Also, as far as people bashing the physics program, I've found from my experience as a TA that the people who complain the loudest are mostly people who take University Physics 1, failed out because they rarely came to class or did homework or labs, and then complained that the professor was too hard, even though the test average was like 75-80 or something. Please don't be one of those people, regardless of what major you decide on."
rit,35g4y6,Odder,3,Mon May 11 02:13:49 2015 UTC,"A lot of people here are complaining about the physics department, which I would take with a grain of salt because physics is hard and if you don't have the mind for it you will have a hard time. As a physics major, you get smaller, more focused classes and access to a lounge designed for physics students to collaborate. I would be hesitant about double majoring though because physics is really complicated and it may take longer to graduate because there aren't many overlapping classes and you really don't want to overload credits if you are taking difficult classes."
rit,35g4y6,brya2,2,Mon May 11 16:37:31 2015 UTC,"I tried to double major with CS and Physics. I found that after taking Classical Mechanics, it wasn't something I wanted to pursue as a major, but more as a hobby, just because of the sheer amount of work involved. I also took Mathematical Methods in Physics and that was insane, too.  I'm now pursuing CS and am loving it. If I were you, I'd recommend doing a minor in Physics, otherwise you're probably going to end up staying here for longer than 5 years (the minimum for CS majors, since we do co-op)."
rit,35g4y6,_zg_,3,Thu May 14 17:23:08 2015 UTC,"First of all, at RIT, don't major in Physics, don't minor in physics, avoid physics if at all possible. Trust me.  Second of all, if you're considering CEN and Comp Sci, I'd recommend CE firstly and then as you progress deciding if you want a comp sci minor or major. Otherwise, you will be very overwhelmed with work.  Just my two cents!"
rit,35g4y6,StarrunnerCX,2,Sun May 10 07:03:18 2015 UTC,"As a mathematics major, I would actually recommend double majoring in computational mathematics and physics. Computational math would really help set you ahead in both compsci and physics. The major requires intro sequence of cs 1 and cs 2 and then required 4-5 more classes in cs. Let me know if you have any questions about either programs. I started as a physics major and am currently in comp math."
rit,35g4y6,paradoxmachines,1 point,Sun May 10 12:00:14 2015 UTC,"From what I understand, most Physics majors who don't go to grad school end up programming anyway. It's too bad there isn't a Computational Physics program yet, although there is a Computational Math program that's excellent. If I were you, I'd just pick CS/CE and decide on Physics after you take the intro sequence. You're not going to have to decide until after you finish that sequence anyway. It seems like most freshman (myself included, several years ago) thinks double majoring is a good idea, and then they realize they could either do a BS/MS or save thousands of dollars in tuition by graduating sooner instead."
rit,35g4y6,FerroTesla,1 point,Wed May 13 13:33:34 2015 UTC,"Comp Sci is a great add on for Physics since it helps a lot with the major. However, I would be careful in doubling majoring early in either since they are both have extremely high work loads and tough courses (thinking more along the lines of the upper level ones). I would pick your primary (I guess from you are saying, Comp Sci) and then minor in both. You'll find out quickly if you don't like either of those two. If you still have one, complete the minor, descide if you want to continue with that major. I can tell you, as a Physics major, expect a lot of lab work and rigorous theory courses in the upper level. You won't know the full meaning of that until you are there, trust me. You'll need a lot of time to do the work and focus on the material. If you stick with it though, it can be very fun and rewarding, as you'll become a very good problem solver and understand the basics of how the laws of nature work and relate to most things. Bottom line, just start with your basics in Comp Sci and your freshman courses and your liberal arts. You'll know what you want after that.  Best of luck!"

rit,35d8vj,splox982,7,Sat May 9 16:18:24 2015 UTC,"Ah ok, I can shed some light on the long wait between acts. Between Hartly and Common the monitor engineer for Common came out to load his show files to the monitor board and in the process bent a pin in the memory slot shorting something and causing the board to crash. He had a backup already stored to the board so once the board came back online it was good to start. The bigger issue came for Chance where the monitor engineer only had his show files on his memory card. Being unable to use the memory card slot in the board created a delay while the system tech worked to load the engineers files from a computer."

The entire Adobe production suite is available on the lab computers but Premiere and After Effects are probably used the most. If you are interested in compositing the Digital Effects and Compositing class teaches Nuke. I know that Assimilate Scratch is used for color correction but there may be others. 2D animation is TVPaint and ToonBoom. Stop Motion rooms have Dragon Frame. 3D animators use Maya and sometimes Zbrush. This is nowhere near a comprehensive list. The lab computers are stuffed to the brim with software and unless the assignment is specific you can use whatever you are most comfortable with.

rit,353cwj,NotAnonymousRIT,3,Wed May 6 22:59:10 2015 UTC,"It was mostly a joke, partially truth. Ethernet is okay, but WiFi is terrible. If you have your own router you're doomed on 2.4 GHz and possibly doomed on 5 GHz. When Province switched to Pavlov they switched their routers over to Ruckus, which has barely-legal levels of not-technically-interference-but-might-as-well-be with other wireless networks, and they plop down the access points so densely that the AP's on the PavlovMedia SSID actually interfere amongst each other, making it impossible to even use the ""recommended"" wireless network.  But the Ruckus routers basically make others unusable. My building cumulatively has fewer routers than a few years ago, but the quality of my wireless connection with my personal router is significantly worse. This is due in part to how these devices are designed, and the rest to incompetence on Province/Pavlov's part setting them up. My setup makes heavy use of my LAN, which wouldn't be an issue without the setup they have, which made me run an Ethernet cord along my walls to the living room and buy an extra switch just to have my PS4 and WiiU able to access the Internet, let alone stream Netlfix/HBO-Go without buffering every 1-3 seconds (on wired it's perfectly okay).  I've tried complaining to Province more than once--even escalating at one point to the regional manager for American Campus Communities--about their setup and how it's not only shitty for residents but even self-sabotaging for people who actually use the PavlovMedia SSID, but obviously they're not going to listen to their residents (particularly not an individual) as evidenced by the push-back against their original shift to this provider (which saved the landlord money but the tenants none, and degraded quality unbelievably). The only people at Province who really listen to tenant issues, in my experience, are the maintenance staff, who are more than willing to actively complain about how shitty and shady the main office is. As someone who does rely on their LAN in addition to wanting enough bandwidth on Wireless to reliably watch Netlfix for more than 15 seconds at a time, Province is one of the worst off-campus places possible for me to live.  Sorry if what I said doesn't make perfect sense.

rit,354jyx,lurch303,5,Thu May 7 02:25:53 2015 UTC,"It's been a while since I went through the interview there, but it's nothing to really worry about I'd say. They'll ask you questions you can probably expect like ""tell us about yourself,"" or ""why do you want to join CSH."" They'll probably ask you what (if any) programming experience you already have (keep in mind you don't have to have any to join, but you'll be surrounded by master code monkies).   Other than that they might discuss some of the other questions you had to answer on your original application, and I think they will ask you which of their boards you might be interested in. If you don't know what these boards are then they'll give a brief overview of each of them.  Really though, don't worry too too much about the interview. Unless you really bomb it I'd find it rather unlikely that they cut you there (not like I'm internal, let alone leader of evals so take that with several grains of salt). Your real test will be making it through the freshman orientation program. Get to know allllllllll the upperclassmen really well prior to the eval meeting where they vote on you. If you're off-floor you need to live there anyways. If you're not in class or asleep you should be on the floor, chilling with and talking with the people there. Participate in any meetings or seminars you can, and try as hard as possible to meet any alumni (or Potter) that come to visit when they do.  Source: Applied to CSH last year but failed on account of living 45 minutes away and holding down a job and basically not being able to live on-floor (I didn't receive enough votes at the eval meeting where they voted on whether new recruits could stay or not, didn't meet enough people).

rit,354jyx,laserBlade,2,Thu May 7 23:09:07 2015 UTC,"In regards to cutting you off after interviews. I had a really weird interviewer with odd questions, and didn't get on floor after that. I usually interview well."
rit,354jyx,Umbrall,2,Thu May 7 06:01:46 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind, there's also a lot more applicants than there are spots on floor, so not everyone gets a spot.  A bunch of others will get off-floor status, and I'm pretty sure there's some cap of how many are accepted just due to practical limitations."
rit,354jyx,comptiger5000,4,Thu May 7 16:16:14 2015 UTC,"Disclaimer: I participated in CSH selections, as I have done almost every year since joining. I will not disclose any information about an individual's application or interview, nor will I respond to angry rants or questions from anyone who was not accepted. I am also not the Evaluations Director, so anything that I say is unofficial. Please email the Evals director at evals AT csh.rit.edu for ""official"" answers to any questions.  I also interviewed several people yesterday, so it's entirely possible that I talked to you. (If I did, I won't say anything about how it went, as per the disclaimer, so please don't ask). Though this is a bit late, it may be useful for others.  Among other things, the point of the interview is to help us get a feel for the incoming class. There are definitely times when a person's application didn't do them justice, and they're much better in person/Skype/phone than on paper, so the interview helps us see that. Similarly, there have been applicants who seemed great, until we got to know them. The interviews allow us to form better opinions about you. That said, we tend to go off of the ""recommended"" questions - if you had me on Skype, then you probably saw me and my partner-in-crime looking down at the table every once in a while, we were looking at the question sheet that nobody's followed in years. Most of our questions (at least, in the interviews I've participated in, which is not a small number over the course of four years) are based off of the application, plus a few ""fun"" questions that differ from person to person. Occasionally, if there's something in the original application that we're not sure about, we'll try to guide the conversation such that you open up about that topic. I personally tend to ask at least one technical question, normally related to the programming languages that you've worked with in the past, or a project that you've done, but we don't expect a ton of CS knowledge coming in - that's why you're here, after all.  If you feel that the interview didn't go well, or you aren't accepted, feel free to email the Evaluations director (email in the disclaimer), and stop by in the fall. Particularly in Week 0, there's not much going on in the beginning of the semester so you can be in basically the same situation as the rest of the off-floor freshmen. You can fill out another application later. We are limited in the number of people we can accept over the summer, but once the year starts we can accept more.  If you do end up being accepted, then congratulations! We look forward to your arrival in the fall.  Bonus protip: Not berating or scolding, I just get some amusement from seeing ""the CSH"" in applications. We call ourselves ""CSH"". Though grammatically it may be incorrect, we are ""Computer Science House"", not ""The Computer Science House"" or ""The CSH"". I think this is the first time I've seen ""House of Computer Science"", though, so kudos for that. I think House of General Science might like their name back, otherwise I'd steal it and use it for pranks. (No I wouldn't HoGS, don't worry!)"
rit,354jyx,laserBlade,2,Thu May 7 23:36:49 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply. I'll most likely need to apply again so thanks for all the reapplication info. Also for anyone who hasn't had their interview yet and is reading this, relax. The interview was far from bad and they ask you reasonable questions. You'll mess up and come off unappealing during the interview"

As well as there is a number of applicants we accept without interviewing. (We simply can't interview every applicant as we receive so many)  Good luck! If you have any more questions feel free to PM me."

We did properly receive all submitted applications so we definitely have it. If you aren't accepted (for any reason) then I recommend coming up and visiting floor (NRH 3) and you can pick up an application then, you can even turn it in day 1 of fall semester and go through the introductory process with all the other applicants."

Their network is amazingly wide and many companies that come to RIT are practically willing to hire you on the spot if they see you're a member of CSH. They have a lot of requirements set up to maintain their image of being a very prestigious student organization, like the annual major project, meeting attendance requirements, et cetera.  Basically, yeah they take themselves that seriously and with good reason."

If you're even lazier than that ftd.com and 1800flowers.com are viable options.   It is the exact same as having flowers delivered to a normal apartment.
rit,34vigs,C7J0yc3,4,Mon May 4 23:12:07 2015 UTC,Make sure to specify the street address and not the mailing address (it's different for UC and I'm sure other buildings as well). You might need to have them pick it up from outside (if they're in dorms).
rit,34vigs,Hanachio,4,Mon May 4 23:25:53 2015 UTC,"Just as a note to OP, places like 1800flowers can be a gamble compared to a local florist in quality of flowers.  Local might be more expensive, but it's almost certainly going to be a better experience."

rit,34weze,Rhynocerous,2,Tue May 5 05:30:16 2015 UTC,"Housing will let you stay for an extension if you ask, at least in the apartments. If I were you, I'd stay on campus til June 1, then I'd get an off campus apartment with a lease starting June 1, but you could also just stay in RIT housing for the summer if you wanted to. You could also get a sublease at PP/Province for the summer and move back to campus in the fall.  Take a look at Padmapper and see what you can find. I found a studio on Park Ave that's cheaper than most housing options on campus besides Riverhole."
rit,34weze,RIT_Housing,2,Tue May 5 16:16:46 2015 UTC,Congrats on your co-op! Students on co-op are eligible to live in RIT Housing during the summer and fall and may stay until the spring semester when you resume classes. We encourage you to complete a housing contract as soon as possible and list all of the housing preferences on your contract. Feel free to contact Lisa Barber at lnbapt@rit.edu for further questions.
rit,34weze,Drunken_Consent,1 point,Thu May 7 13:02:27 2015 UTC,"This summer?  I mean, not to be that guy but you can practically rape people in Park Point for their apartment as a sub-lease with hilarious rates.  I've seen people asking $600 / month, and then steadily decreasing.  Someone on this site said they got an apartment there from some poor soul for $250 / month or something ridiculous.  Look into that, and then gauge your options for Fall living."
rit,34weze,scy1192,6,Tue May 5 03:04:57 2015 UTC,I second subletting. Tons of people both here and at U of R that are stuck with 1 year leases but won't be there for the summer.
rit,34weze,Drunken_Consent,2,Tue May 5 03:19:45 2015 UTC,"Exactly.  I'm only a first year, but from what I understand / have seen, there is definitely no shortage of people trying to sub-lease.  Just gotta find that desperate soul who is ready to give you any price you want.  Fall might be a different story, but OP has all of summer to work on that."
rit,34weze,Drunken_Consent,1 point,Tue May 5 03:24:26 2015 UTC,"I guess my only concern with that is that I won't have anything secured for fall and spring, and I'll have to move again."
rit,34weze,Rhynocerous,3,Tue May 5 03:23:45 2015 UTC,"If you try to find housing that is going to extend from Summer and Fall, you're not going to get a good deal.  Personally, the money you are saving this summer by sub-leasing would be well worth it, imo.  It's up to you, but you have an entire summer to find alternative housing.  Moving again isn't inherently bad; it's just annoying as fuck.  Live like a minimalist and it won't feel so bad.  After all, this is just temp housing while you make the $$$ and experience."

rit,34ugjf,Latibulate,6,Mon May 4 23:49:38 2015 UTC,"Honestly, it's not as bad as it sounds. Once you get started on applying, you can easily grind out four to eight applications in a few hours, depending on whether or not the positions you're applying to are asking for a cover letter. Some positions only ask for your resume and are really easy to apply to.  The common mistakes that I think most people encounter are not taking a few hours a week to apply, being too picky with what company they want to work for, not applying because they don't fulfill all the requirements, waiting for a single company to reply back before applying to more companies, giving up before it's even June, or waiting too late into the academic year to apply. Although, I've received my last two co-op offers in May, so honestly, it's really just being persistent. Just do your best when the time comes!"

I got my co-op by bullshitting with people.  I had a sales pitch prepped after a while ""Need a tech job to get some school credit...blah blah blah"".  I threw it out one day to a customer at a summer job.  He said, ""Oh, I can help with that.""  Within a week I was set and in September for a year, I did all three blocks of my co-op.

If you're too lazy to do that or if your major is one of the few with hundreds of job openings, at least apply to everything relevant that only requires your resume and accepts applications through JobZone.   Also, talk to your co-op advisor at the Co-Op office. They'll look at your resume and give you suggestions, and they'll also know what local places are looking for co-ops last minute and pass your info along to them.

Just show up on floor, hang out, attend events and see if you fit in with the community. If you do, great! If not, also great! It's not for everyone. The important thing is that you try to fit in somewhere at RIT, whether it be a club, SIH, fraternity, etc."
rit,34odgd,laserBlade,2,Mon May 4 16:39:38 2015 UTC,"Disclaimer: I participated in CSH selections, as I have done almost every year since joining. I will not disclose any information about an individual's application or interview, nor will I respond to angry rants or questions from anyone who was not accepted. I am also not the Evaluations Director, so anything that I say is unofficial. Please email the Evals director at evals AT csh.rit.edu for ""official"" answers to any questions.  What /u/maddjay said is correct - if only one roommate is accepted on-floor, then they will be asked to choose between staying with their chosen roommate or moving on-floor. If they stay with their existing roommate then they will be considered off-floor introductory members - the way I like to phrase it is ""off-floors have all the same rights and privileges, the only difference is where the majority of their stuff is"". Off-floor members have swipe access to Nathaniel Rochester Hall, where CSH is located, and are welcomed (and encouraged) to hang around floor often. There's no difference between on- and off-floor members except for where their room is.  If the roommate chooses to abandon the chosen roommate: First of all, please do it nicely. Apart from that, it's assumed since we've reviewed your applications that most of the incoming freshmen will be at least somewhat compatible, with similar interests, so as far as I am aware you would be assigned a CSH freshman roommate.  If you are not accepted at this time: unfortunately, we can't accept everyone over the summer. On-floor space is (obviously) limited, and approximately 24 off-floor freshmen are selected. That being said, if you are not accepted and you want to apply, stop by sometime (even on move-in day) and hang out - you'll probably just blend in with the other freshmen, we've had people apply later who we didn't even realize weren't off-floor members, and some of our most influential members applied later on (including a good portion of our current executive board).  Whatever the result, you should find out your status in early-to-mid-June. Be sure to check your RIT email.  Interesting side note: /u/sdubois was around when I was a freshman, and /u/RireMakar is a current freshman as I'm on my way out (one semester to go) - you're getting past, present, and future old farts answering you here.  EDIT: Also, I suppose I should mention - I originally had planned to room with a friend from high school, but I abandoned him to live on CSH. For me, it was definitely the right decision. It might not be for everyone, and there's always the possibility to move on floor later, but I feel like I made the right choice. (The other guy didn't hold it against me, though he DID mix up ""3rd floor NRH"" with ""3rd floor GCCIS"" and dragged some friends around the computing building for an hour trying to find the drink machine that was right down the hall from my room. I got injured on that adventure. Helping a professor lift a computer. :/ )"

rit,34jhja,cyb3rm0nk3y,3,Fri May 1 17:59:56 2015 UTC,"If you really want to keep fees to a minimum get a bank that doesn't have fees. Ally Bank has consistently been rated as one of if not the top bank in /r/PersonalFinance as well as on other websites. They have the highest interest rate you will see on a savings account, and they have the highest interest rate you will see on a checking account as well.  I made a significant amount of money on savings account interest last year. Most banks will be lucky to have a fraction of a percent on interest.  They refund ATM fees. I've withdrawn cash at the New York State Fair at a $7 fee, and felt bad for Ally because they footed that bill. There's no fee for too low a balance either, if that comes up.  There's a catch, they're an online-only bank. You should have a free checking account of some sort with Chase or M&T or whoever else so that you can deposit cash easily if you need to. You deposit cash into that account and then electronically transfer it to your Ally account. Once you get this set up it's three or four clicks through their website or their phone app.  I've had an account with them for 6 years now, and the only issues I've had were depositing large sums of cash and Key Bank being stupid about their payroll checks. When Key Bank refused to allow Ally to deposit my check Ally called me that day and gave me multiple options and instructions on how to work around the problem.  When you call their support line you get a human in the US. 24/7. All of the staff I've ever interacted with were happy to deal with my problems and did, in fact, solve my problem if it was within their power to do so.  I can highly recommend them."

I switched to AFCU who apologized on their behalf, opened my account, made my debit card in the office so I had it before I left, and had me activate it at the ATM in the branch so they could handle any problems right there. If you work an on-campus job, they'll even handle setting up all your direct deposit for you so you don't have to do anything other than ask them to do it. It's been a 100% positive experience.  AFCU has a branch in global village, their ATM network is massive (CIRRUS, Metavante, Allpoint and NYCE logo ATMs are all free), and they do shared branching so any credit union in the country that also does shared branching can be used as a branch.  If nothing else, you can also get an RIT debit card where part of the interchange fee goes to Margaret's House (no extra costs to you). They have other options too, mine benefits the Golisano Children's Hospital since I got set up before the RIT card was available - though they have offered to re-issue me an RIT card several times.  EDIT: To clarify, AFCU doesn't charge for using ATMs in those networks, but other banks might charge you for it. AFCU won't refund that."

We touched base with Randy Vercauteren and he let us know that once everyone has moved out of the residence halls, the bicycle racks are surveyed. If a bicycle is clearly being used, it's left alone.  If the bike appears to be abandoned or in complete disrepair, Randy's team marks them and waits to see if they will move or someone responds to the message.  If after several weeks they receive no responses, the bike is removed, they record where they removed it from and they store the bike at Grace Watson in partnership with Public Safety. They are held there for a while to see if any ownership requests come.   We hope that clarifies everything. Let us know if you have any more questions."

A burstable connection is one where you pay for a certain minimum bandwidth even if you don't use it, but you can burst up to the size of the interface and you pay extra for usage above your minimum. We pay for 6Gbps, (2Gbps on each of our three 10Gbps connections), our normal usage runs around 5Gbps total, and we've recorded short spikes of up to 20Gbps simultaneous download combined from our multiple providers. You should see RIT mirrors level downloads to any host that has the capacity on their side to support it. With the usual caveat that you will occasionally see less when a bunch of you all in the same building decide to see how much you can download from mirrors all at once. That rarely happens except when I taunt people into testing their bandwidth using Mirrors... :)  Edit: Caveat"

If you're intent on going to RIT, I'd stick out the semester and try to transfer in at that time. I don't have any stats myself, but maybe sitting down with the CS academic advisor and seeing what they have to say about it would help.  Have you looked at the SE/IT programs?

MCC's advisers aren't the most up to date with articulation and they'll stick you in an associates program which will make you take a lot of classes that won't necessarily transfer over.  Show an RIT adviser your transcripts, ask what you can currently take at your school that would be worth it, and get all the non CS credits out of the way for much cheaper while you're waiting for the program to open up for next semester."

I found a house within walking distance to the university for peanuts a month - all it takes is a tiny bit of effort and resourcefulness.  2) - Assignments. Try placing 2000 people in less than that kind of space, all based on attempted personality matches. Most students don't do early decision or action and many come in on the rolling enrollment.

The image linked is also misleading in that some of the totals include a meal plan, which isn't required for those apartments.  At least when the two properties were owned by separate companies there was some semblance of competitive pricing, but now nothing's stopping you from continual increases year after year.

rit,34asdg,ht5k,8,Wed Apr 29 20:15:46 2015 UTC,"A lot of students attend RIT off scholarships and have part-time jobs for their other needs. In addition, not everyone has a license, and a car is not a one time payment. You have to pay for insurance, gas, maintenance, etc. A cheap car will cost you a lot more as far as upkeep is concerned. Not to even mention the issue of buying furniture for your new house."
rit,34asdg,Hanachio,3,Wed Apr 29 20:18:35 2015 UTC,"What do you think I did? I lived in the dorms freshman year, Colony for 2, and off-campus for 3. Only the dorms were furnished. Find some friends and go in on a place together. You'll find that the rent you're saving will easily pay for the rest.  EDIT: Here are some numbers.  Take Westbrooke Commons, which is right off campus.  A 12 month lease there costs 1205/mo for a 3 bedroom TH, which is just like the ones in Colony. That's 301.25/mo or 3615/yr.  Now take Colony.  That's 4770 per student per school year, which doesn't even include summer.  Each roommate is saving over a thousand bucks over the course of 12 months AND gains air conditioning. Between four people, that's easily furniture and transportation."
rit,34asdg,MillerRoad,7,Wed Apr 29 20:24:09 2015 UTC,"When you move off campus, your scholarship may be lowered. When I moved out of my dorms freshman year, I loss a significant portion of my scholarship because I was no longer living in official RIT housing. In the end, it's cheaper to live on campus because we get the aid.  And I have lived off campus, I just don't think it's reasonable to expect everyone to have this option. It's not financially reasonable for some students."
rit,34asdg,Hanachio,3,Wed Apr 29 20:29:24 2015 UTC,"Thats the fucking point. You can find cheaper apartments/houses a few miles off campus for cheap. Even with the added expense of a car, its still cheaper than park point."
rit,34asdg,burgerboy9n,0,Thu Apr 30 02:21:32 2015 UTC,"While I agree that Park Point and Province are very expensive, and you can definitely get better deals off campus, I'm not talking about Park Point, I'm talking about RIT provided housing vs private housing. And for the record, Park Point and Province are considered off-campus housing.  Some scholarships are based on financial need provided to FAFSA or RIT based on your enrollment. If you don't sign up for housing with RIT (on-campus), your total is usually around $30k instead of the $40k (with housing). Therefore, you will receive less aid, leaving you with a negative sum if you instead decide to choose off campus housing. Why would you go off campus and be further away from school and spend more money and have to commute to class when you can live on campus and have scholarships cover your housing costs for you so you can worry about studying?"
rit,34asdg,MillerRoad,0,Thu Apr 30 03:00:35 2015 UTC,Most colleges offer dorms for all years of college at a non-ass-raping cost.
rit,34asdg,CyberBot129,3,Thu Apr 30 07:02:27 2015 UTC,"Is it? RIT Housing is guaranteed for all four years. its $6.9k for a dorm, while UC runs you about $8.5k, can be as low as $3.7k in colony.   Lets compare RIT to some area schools.  Naz:$7k for a basic res hall, $9.6k for an apt  SJFC: $7.3k for a dorm  Brockport: $7.4k for a dorm, $9.3k for a townhouse  So really, RIT is one of the cheapest housing cost for area colleges, research next time."

rit,34bz6x,Sunquyman,6,Wed Apr 29 22:51:30 2015 UTC,"You may have come across some rant-y posts on this subreddit about various aspects but I believe I am part of the generally silent majority that has loved my time here and would make the choice again if I had to. In terms of academics, I find most classes challenging and rewarding and the professors generally good with a few exceptions. On the social side, the scene is very different from most schools (perhaps not WPI) but if you put yourself out there, you will have no trouble making friends with like-minded people. Every non-liberal arts major is required to take two tracks of humanities. The first is your perspectives, which requires you to take one introductory class in each category (artistic, ethical, global, and social). Later on, you pick one subject for your immersion track, where you take three classes in your chosen concentration (here's the current options). I don't have too much of a baseline to compare the quality of the classes to, but so far I have found the classes well taught and interesting. RIT has 3 remote campuses in Dubai, Croatia, and Kosovo. I don't have any personal experience studying abroad but one of my friends is taking a 5 week course this summer in France and another in Sydney. You might be able to start this as early as the summer after your first year but I'm not sure. All freshmen are required to live in the dorms their first year. All of them are pretty much the same but they are nice enough. You can choose to live on a special interest floor though such as Computer Science House, Photo House, Engineering House, ect. which come with their own perks. There are other apartment options on campus however space is tight and the lottery only gets harder as you move up in years. Many people choose to live off campus either downtown or in Henrietta but not everyone goes this route. It depends on your budget. Outside a few peak hours I've never had a problem waiting for equipment at the gym. Earlier in the mornings is probably the best time. The library is serviceable but nothing too special. Java's (the regional coffee shop on the first floor) is a nice place to hang out. Also as you go up in floors the noise level goes down so if you ever need complete silence for working you can head up to the fourth floor."
rit,34bz6x,paperboat22,3,Wed Apr 29 23:10:08 2015 UTC,"If you're going into CS/SE or anything that requires a co-op then come to RIT. I'm graduating now and have had 2 coops and a job lined up for afterwards.  If you want a good tech job, the co-op program here is wonderful. Lets you get your feet wet working for industry before actually graduating."
rit,34bz6x,ALightBliss,2,Thu Apr 30 04:54:49 2015 UTC,"Good academics, social life is easy to have / maintain if you put effort in.  Friendly people.  Also can have it's fair share of pretentious assholes ( everywhere has this ) but it seems to be lowerclassmen ( I'm a freshman right now ). No clue Dorms are annoying.  I hate my dorm floor.  I think they are immature asswipes.  But that isn't every floor, because I hang out on my friends floor and they are all fun and stuff.  Depends where you fit in.  Other housing is going to be better ( obviously ) Gym can be crowded, but it isn't hard to change your routine to account for it.  I've never seen lines and lines of people waiting.  I go, get my workout in, leave.  Try to stay away from rush hours. I spend my life there because I dislike my quad I live in.  It's 24/7 which is awesome because I barely sleep.  It's good, quiet, and I like the study rooms."
rit,34bz6x,Drunken_Consent,2,Wed Apr 29 23:10:12 2015 UTC,"First Year's Opinion for you: 1. I love it here, I chose it over other engineering schools in the area and am very glad I made my choice. I have Tiger Pride and am involved at the school in many ways. 2. Humanities are alright. You must take 4 perspective classes which give you a general overview of several topics and then you choose an immersion later to specialize in one humanity. Immersions are a few classes less than a minor. 3. RIT has other campuses around the world such as RIT Dubai and RIT Kosovo in Croatia that you can travel to. There are many other options for both during-school and summer study abroad options. Depending on your major, you may not want to go abroad first year but in the end that is your choice. 4. Housing is perfectly fine depending on where you are housed. There are special interest housing if you want to live with other engineers or computer scientists etc. Then there are first year-normal dorms which vary in themselves. Some dorms are Suite-Style which means you share a bathroom with 2 other rooms besides yourself, or there is the typical bathroom down the hall options. Suite style are usually more quiet and less social because there are more doors and walls between everyone whereas the others are normal dorm floors. 5. Depending on what you want to do, the gym will be more or less crowded, also depending on the time of day. If you want to play a sport, then I would recommend joining the club for that sport because they can reserve fields and courts whereas if you want an elliptical or treadmill, there are always enough. 6. Library is fine, it gets more quiet as you go up the levels. There are some rude people who will talk on the quiet floors but they are a minority. First level you can talk freely or work with groups whereas if you drop a pencil on the top floor you may get dirty looks. I recommend RIT, it's a great place with good academics and clubs. Great people and if you have any more questions, please ask away!"

If you co-op in the summer in the Rochester area you'll have housing. Only benefit to being on campus is if you have to co op at any point during the school year it's not an issue cancelling or having a semester ""lease"".   RIT is what you make of it, but if you don't get involved with clubs, greek life, sports etc..  here you'll have an awful time."

Some clubs are more social than others or lend themselves to doing more fun things or meeting off campus.  No student club is going to advertise that they party because that would be heavily frowned upon."
rit,34cr0u,brodeur3090,-4,Thu Apr 30 02:58:21 2015 UTC,"I'm in clubs and have good friends, what I'm really saying is, if the parties here were more well known and open, they would be a lot more fun and this would be a more fun school in general"
rit,34cr0u,Hanachio,5,Thu Apr 30 03:12:52 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure what you're expecting when you say more well known and open. I'm not sure if we're allowed to advertise on campus for events with alcohol (because events with alcohol must be closed events for members only from what I know). We are allowed to have events with alcohol, but obviously this becomes a liability issue if students under 21 are caught at the party. We do have a Facebook page for RIT Events and Parties, but mostly events get posted there and I rarely see parties. I'm not actually sure if it's an official RIT group, so I don't know if the rules with alcohol applies to posts on there.  So, the only way to really know what kinds of parties are going on are usually through word of mouth, which is pretty much just up to you building up your social network. Just let people know that you love to party when you're meeting new people, and eventually, you'll start learning about more parties going on. Other than that, UofR is a great place to go for parties. And they're close by."
rit,34cr0u,BarshaL,-3,Thu Apr 30 03:26:19 2015 UTC,"By that I mean letting anyone in.

I have experienced the big apartment parties and they always were broken up around midnight which I didn't like. So some advice for you and your friends is to branch out cause that is how I find out about parties at RIT.

rit,347ddd,ghostofrit,10,Tue Apr 28 21:53:50 2015 UTC,One of my issues with smoking on campus in general is the litter.  I see cigarette butts all over campus. Especially areas where people tend to smoke (between Eastman and Monroe Hall) but don't have cigarette receptacles. Hopefully controlling where students are smoking  will help this problem.    I'm graduating this year but I've been trying to start a cigarette disposal and recycling company to tackle the problem through the Simone Center. Unfortunately I haven't fully finished my idea and business plan before leaving. Would anyone be interested in continuing with it?
rit,347ddd,shmellyeggs,5,Tue Apr 28 22:51:36 2015 UTC,"I hear you, but they've left smokers with little choice.  The number of but bins has been greatly reduced and the ones that remain are rarely emptied.  Additionally they got rid of almost all the outdoor trash cans on the west end of campus.  I used to field strip my butts and throw them away but even that isn't an option anymore.  I feel like even though the campus has doubled in size over the past 10 - 15 years that fms has stayed roughly the same size.  I have a feeling they struggle to keep up on litter in general."
rit,347ddd,Valueduser,2,Tue Apr 28 23:36:39 2015 UTC,"I never understood why they removed all the but bins. They wanted people to stop smoking near doors, but the ended up with people still smoking and throwing buts on the floor. That logic was amazing..."
rit,347ddd,sabooya,13,Wed Apr 29 20:03:59 2015 UTC,I'm willing to bet that the enforcement of this wont be noticeable. I'd also bet that people will get mad about it anyway.
rit,347ddd,Rhynocerous,4,Tue Apr 28 22:06:08 2015 UTC,"Any idea where these locations will be? If you live in UC or CM, will you have to haul ass back to the center of campus to get a smoke?"
rit,347ddd,MillerRoad,2,Tue Apr 28 23:29:35 2015 UTC,I believe the smoking ban is only for academic side. I could be wrong but i'm pretty sure you can still smoke outside your apartment.
rit,347ddd,NewtAgain,2,Wed Apr 29 00:09:25 2015 UTC,"My understanding was that the initial smoking ban covered all of campus, including dorms and apartments. Not sure if that changed before it passed."
rit,347ddd,elfo222,1 point,Wed Apr 29 15:43:16 2015 UTC,I thought they changed that after much complaint. Honestly nobody is going to tell you not to smoke outside your own apartment at Colony Manor or UC.... the people most affected by this will be those Frats on dormside who like to set-up their Hookahs outside.
rit,347ddd,NewtAgain,0,Wed Apr 29 21:50:51 2015 UTC,I'd be shocked if any measure to curb smoking in UC was successful if it's your own complex.
rit,347ddd,FatChicksNeedLovinTo,0,Thu Apr 30 02:19:46 2015 UTC,Yeah it seems completely unreasonable to tell people they can't smoke outside their own place of residence.
rit,347ddd,NewtAgain,2,Thu Apr 30 02:38:50 2015 UTC,Living in Colony in an apartment without the ability to receive an air conditioner we must leave our windows open at night in the summer. Nothing is worse than having someone smoke on the stoop out front as it blows right in our window. What about my right to clean air?  EDIT: I wouldn't be opposed to several smoking areas at Colony. What about near the laundry rooms?
rit,347ddd,burgerboy9n,1 point,Thu Apr 30 03:07:41 2015 UTC,"Typically you don't smoke in front of someone's window you smoke in front of your own window or away from a building.

rit,347ddd,NewtAgain,1 point,Thu Apr 30 03:57:21 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure if you're aware of the arrangement of the Colony apartments but my window is less than 3 feet from the stoop where the people in my apartment smoke.

rit,347ddd,burgerboy9n,2,Thu Apr 30 06:58:06 2015 UTC,"You can call public safety, i'm pretty sure even before this smoking ban there was a 20 foot policy. I'm sorry your neighbors were assholes but that doesn't mean other people are not courteous. Banning smoking in it's entirety isn't going to stop those people outside your apartment from smoking right outside your window. If they didn't care before they aren't going to care now."

rit,347ddd,eka5245,5,Tue Apr 28 23:53:17 2015 UTC,"I think the biggest problem with it is (and I'm a non-smoker, equally against it as you are) is that smoking fields an addiction and not everyone can just stop overnight.   I am glad to see that the administration listened and is now phasing into the decision to make RIT smoke free."
rit,347ddd,t8ke,3,Wed Apr 29 15:19:49 2015 UTC,"the point you bring up is a good one, but doing it this way RIT has given people 4 months notice before they need to quit and there are innumerable aids out there to help with quitting."
rit,347ddd,yarudl,1 point,Wed Apr 29 19:59:10 2015 UTC,Some people don't want to quit. Somehow that has gone right over the heads of a lot of people. Tons of people vape who may never smoke yet this ban also includes vaping since it is classified as a tobacco product. This entire ban does nothing but look good on paper. Nobody who smokes is going to stop simply because the campus doesn't allow it.
rit,347ddd,NewtAgain,3,Wed Apr 29 21:54:05 2015 UTC,If campus enforces the rules people will stop breaking the rules after a few $50 fines.
rit,347ddd,yarudl,0,Wed Apr 29 22:11:24 2015 UTC,Wait since when were they gonna fine people?
rit,347ddd,NewtAgain,3,Wed Apr 29 22:22:21 2015 UTC,I haven't heard of any plans to but they should start. What good are rules if there are no consequences to breaking them? Look how well it worked with longboarders and bikers on the quarter mile; there are many fewer of them.
rit,347ddd,yarudl,3,Wed Apr 29 23:55:54 2015 UTC,"I think it is good that we are receiving this notification prior to implementation, but I am confused as to why any information about  policy implementation is omitted.  I wasn't able to find any information on the designated areas from the included links. Even the official institute policy (https://www.rit.edu/academicaffairs/policiesmanual/c160) is the 2010 version.  Maybe the implementation details are still being worked out. Perhaps the decision was made about the designated areas, but the actual locations have not yet been determined."
rit,347ddd,sgweb,7,Wed Apr 29 02:01:54 2015 UTC,"All I can say is this better be enforced just as much as longboarding on the Quarter Mile.  If I can't long board down the QM, then you can't smoke outside of designated smoking zones."

If you can be bothered to maintain a high B or A average in high school you are in for a rude awakening in college. You want an engineering degree or similar from RIT don't get used to slacking. I had a great experience in college and got a good job due to hard work.   RIT won't care if you do well your senior year of high school. Worst case they get a semester or two of tuition out of you then you drop out or get the boot if you can't hack it.   Work hard now because if you think high school is challenging you'll need the practice.

Computer Science - theories of programming Software Engineering - practical programming (this is the closest to CS) Computer Engineering - lower level programming and some hardware Information Sciences and Technology - programming, database, network, etc. Information Technology - web & mobile development New Media Interactive Development - programming and design Game Design and Development - programming with heavy emphasis on gaming and game design theory   It's pretty easy to flip flop back and forth between these related majors (I'm sure I'm missing a few as well)."

rit,33z5xb,riversquid,1 point,Mon Apr 27 02:58:49 2015 UTC,"I can't comment on how hard it would be to transfer into CS; however, I have heard it is a difficult major.  In terms of why you should go to RIT, there're a lot of reasons.  The academics are excellent of course, and (to me) the campus is beautiful.  RIT definitely tries to cater a lot to the student population in terms of activities and events, and it makes the campus even more welcoming.  Also, the number of clubs and groups is huge, so you can do almost anything you're interested in here.  Again, this is just from my perspective, but I'd recommend it.  You probably heard a lot of what I just said during presentations and tours, but I think it's all true."

Reasons to attend:   Instructors and Faculty are industry leaders and bring real world examples of how your degree will be used in the field CoOp Programs. I actively look for candidates with internships or CoOp experiences, it shows that you are learning industry and theory effectively You learn hard and fast, the lab facilities are top tier and you get to play with some neat toys. Ignore people that say there is much of a social scene.  Its a matter of what you put into it. I was a complete introvert when I got to RIT. I would say that it evened me out, and well I developed more socially in the first 2 years I was at RIT than I did in the previous 10.  There is a camaraderie that you share with your daily experiences with. This is more of a personal experience, and it may vary person to person.   PM me if you want to ask anything more personal or private. Be more than happy to answer any questions you have."

rit,33up95,_rit_throwaway_,6,Sat Apr 25 20:23:18 2015 UTC,"No really sure about SE but in CS classes the professors will generally have their assignments done in a (high level) language of their choosing. Usually Python or Java.  However, don't take that as an excuse to not learn about C and pointers. The topic will come up again when you have to write assembly in EFOCS for SE or Computer Organization for CS.  To succeed in either major, you should:   understand at a high level how memory management works be comfortable with a variety of programming languages"
rit,33up95,avita1,2,Sat Apr 25 20:47:34 2015 UTC,It's definitely EFuCS.
rit,33up95,Skuloth,1 point,Sun Apr 26 19:29:34 2015 UTC,A little o/t but I'm curious ....... OP says they're failing tests but doing well on the projects.  I took the intro sequence on quarters and I succeeded on tests but I struggled with the assignments. I ended up changing my major so it doesn't really matter but what did that mean in terms of my progression in programming??? When I re-took OOP and was still struggling it seemed to me that employers would put more emphasis on being able to write/fix programs than just knowing the concepts (which is applicable anywhere really - who cares how much you know if you don't have experience to prove it). Your comment just makes me wonder what if I had stuck with it.
rit,33up95,sabresfangirl21,3,Sat Apr 25 21:22:09 2015 UTC,"SE is definitely more forgiving in this respect than CS would be. If you aren't doing hot now, CS classes will generally have the same focus just more in depth as you go up.  For SE classes, your reliance on rote algorithm and CS-ish theory recall will go down (and you will also just get better with it over time, the first year can be rough if you have no experience). You'll be working on projects that are less about exactly how you write the algorithms and more about the big picture.   If you are more interested in project management and requirements gathering/customer focused areas stay in SE. If you care more about how large parts of the code work together instead of specifics of a method, stay in SE.   Almost every project after your first year will be done in you/your groups chosen language. Some classes aren't even coding as they focus on the PM side of things.  All of that said, you'll be performing your best when you deeply understand the underlying principles you're struggling with now - so don't give up and make sure you understand things before you move on. There's plenty of places to get help (CSC, SSE, your TAs) if you don't understand things."
rit,33up95,Furtwangler,2,Sun Apr 26 23:47:25 2015 UTC,"For the upper level SE courses, it depends on the professor usually. A course I'm taking now, enterprise, has a project where you pick what to build and how to build it. It's pretty much open ended, so yes, there is flexibility. That being said, the discipline of the lower courses is good."
rit,33up95,cac2573,1 point,Mon Apr 27 05:35:25 2015 UTC,"SWEN-261 and SWEN-262 are pretty locked into Python and Java respectively.  After that, you will see a mix.  Some classes (SWEN-331 comes to mind) are language-agnostic for the project (but tends to give samples in C/Java).  Others do have Java projects (SWEN-342).  Also remember that there is more than just code-writing for SE projects (especially in the second year courses).  In fact, some courses require no code (SWEN-256, SWEN-440).  Remember that C is definitely its own beast.  I personally don't like going that low in my developing and have had no trouble avoiding it both in class and on co-op.  If you are struggling in it, you can always look to the SSE, CSC, TAs, upperclassmen friends, your professor, etc to find help.  Source: Fourth year SE"

Rochester has the bare minimum public transit possible. The bus system is only useful to the destitute and the disabled, since I can literally walk the eight miles to my apartment downtown from campus faster than RGRTA can get me there, and I don't have to worry about getting stabbed at the Transit Center, either.   A startup comes in and starts hiring drivers. This summer, I saw a Lyft car every day. Then, a crook by the name of Ben Lawsky, a regulator who has never been elected, decides that competition just cannot happen in the state of NY. Lawsky's office didn't even exist until Cuomo took office, and don't even get me started on that freedom-hating Commie of a governor. These racist, incompetent scum-of-the-earth taxi companies clearly need protection.  This is the same fucking scumbag who decided to institute draconian Bitcoin regulations over the summer. Again, this man has never run for office in his life, and he's made a name for himself by stifling innovation everywhere he goes. Ever since I moved here for college, this state and its never-ending corruption has never ceased to amaze me. Why the fuck do people live here? I made less than $25k last year while I was on co-op, and I paid 5% in income tax to this fucking state. What does it get me? Jack shit, that's what. I wouldn't get taxed that high in the liberal mecca of Massachusetts if I made three times that. When I graduate, I'm leaving this frozen wasteland and its pathetic salaries and ludicrous taxes for good. Again, why the fuck does anyone live here?

I don't know the specifics of those two majors, but in all likelihood the first year's worth of classes are nearly the same, so switching a year in shouldn't be a big deal. Also, make sure you talk to people in the major to make sure you know it's really what you want. No need to make snap decisions; you have an entire year or more to decide."
rit,33nyjg,zootboy,3,Fri Apr 24 02:07:09 2015 UTC,"Looking at the academics pages for each major (CS, CSEC), they are in fact exactly the same except CSEC has Fundamentals of Computing Security instead of a Gen Ed class.   Pinging /u/grj725 so he sees this too."

rit,33nyjg,nedolya,2,Fri Apr 24 03:23:17 2015 UTC,"Yes, CS fills up fast. And then something like 60% drop out or change majors in the first year. There's a lot of overlap between CS and CSec early on from what I remember, so you can either stay in and switch later, or switch to computer exploration - you're guaranteed a spot in the major you choose when you go through that program."

rit,33nyjg,white-forest,1 point,Fri Apr 24 02:05:52 2015 UTC,"I applied to computing security because it has some elements of cs in it, but also has some other things I find interesting (networking, unix shell scripting, etc).  However, I want to switch because I feel like Computing Security is kind of isolated. It seems like the only jobs available with that degree would be sysadmin or something along those lines.  I may be wrong, but I feel CS would provide me with more flexibility."
rit,33nyjg,Sean55yaya,2,Fri Apr 24 02:30:00 2015 UTC,"What exactly do you want to do? As mentioned above, CSEC and CS have literally the same first year classes. CSEC seems to be a good balance between programming and system administration, which makes sense due to the nature of the program.   If you are worried about job types, a CS degree will get you a programming position. CSEC will get you a System Security position. With CSEC, it is easier for you to get a CS Minor due to the CS classes you take."

rit,33mh64,kyogre97,3,Thu Apr 23 18:46:33 2015 UTC,"Hey, I'm a NMID major.  The major is, as stated, anything associated with developers interested in any sort of New Media. This includes more traditional medias (such as websites, phone applications, web applications) and newer technologies (Kinect / motion sensors, eye tracking software, touch screens).  Most of the classes you take will be in web / app development (coding), as well as some GUI classes (design). You'll also take basic courses in hardware, networking, and liberal arts.  The classes themselves are pretty easy, and most of the professors are pretty great. A big part of NMID is what you make out of it. If you coast through classes and do the bare minimum, you will graduate with a decent knowledge of web dev. There are a lot of opportunities available to you though, including taking classes in other majors, collaborating with developers and designers, and the MAGIC (Media Arts Gaming something something - I forgot the acronyms, but it's essentially a center for innovators to collaborate) center.  If you have any questions in specific, feel free to message me. :)"
rit,33mh64,Hanachio,1 point,Thu Apr 23 20:40:50 2015 UTC,"Just a few questions off the top of my head, How are the internship/job/co-op opportunities? Are you able to have a social life on top of it? Are the people in the program generally friendly? Is it easy to get help from / talk to professors?"
rit,33mh64,Hanachio,2,Thu Apr 23 23:44:09 2015 UTC,"RIT holds 2 career fairs every year, and the majority of employers are either looking for developers or engineers. If you decide to specialize in web, mobile, or app dev, you will have no trouble finding employers interested in you. General software engineering jobs and IT jobs are also very possible for NMID majors. You will have absolutely no trouble finding potential employers. Now, what you do with that opportunity is entirely up to you. We have amazing academic advisors, and we also have a co-op advisor (whom I have never spoken to so I can't really say much about), along with other resources you can use.  The people in the program are generally friendly. Most of the students are a mix between designers and computer geeks, so you'll have a lot of people who are pretty much CS / IT majors with an inclination towards design.  Most of the professors that I have had classes with were very friendly, but you have to seek them out. Don't expect hand holding. You must do your part, but if you absolutely need help, there are always office hours you can go to, and I found that most of the professors are more than happy to help.  Honestly, I can't stress enough that the NMID major (as I'm sure are many others) is very dependent on what you do with your time. I've seen students who barely take an interest in their studies and cruise by and end up with a mediocre web developer position, and I've seen others make amazing installations with new technologies. Seriously, immerse yourself, you won't regret it."
rit,33mh64,Hanachio,1 point,Fri Apr 24 00:25:47 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much for explaining NMID!! My last question is how hard is it to transfer majors? I originally applied to RIT for Computer Science, but was offered NMID. At this point I like what NMID has to offer and will definitely  give it a try, but in case I don't like it I would like to know how easy would it be to transfer. Thanks"
rit,33mh64,sito-rit,2,Fri Apr 24 00:40:14 2015 UTC,"It's fairly easy to switch majors, A friend of mine switch 4 times throughout his college career. Of course, he's going to graduate a little late as a result, but he thought it was worth it. If you're taking basic programming classes and have AP credits, a switch or two shouldn't make a huge impact on your projected graduation date. You can also overload on courses and take summer classes, so no biggie. If you're planning on switching majors, just make sure to take potentially overlapping courses so that you can transfer more credits. Worst case scenario, you'll knock out all your electives before sophomore year."
rit,33mh64,sito-rit,2,Fri Apr 24 02:25:59 2015 UTC,"Hey there! I'm a NMID major and I've loved it so far. I work for the Student IT Office on campus as a Web Designer, but that's only one of the paths you could go for. A lot of the classes are fairly basic programming and then in your 2nd or 3rd year you'll start being able to pick a better path for your interest. I chose to go more front-end and take more GUI and web development courses, but I know some people in the major who are taking more back-end classes or even phone app based classes. The professors are pretty great and will often encourage you to try things out of class and have open office hours to help you get you where you need to be if you fall behind.  Good luck!"
rit,33mh64,Waffles211,1 point,Fri Apr 24 02:34:50 2015 UTC,Does NMID include alot of programming? What languages do we learn or have the opportunity to learn?
rit,33mh64,sito-rit,2,Fri Apr 24 12:06:45 2015 UTC,"NMID has a moderate amount. It isn't as intensive as say Game Design, but there is a fair bit to keep you busy.   In the beginning, if they haven't changed the curriculum a lot in the past 2 years, it was a bit of ActionScript as it is a fairly easy language to learn, even if a bit less useful or used. After that you'll learn basics of HTML, CSS, and PHP and then you'll learn some Javascript. From there your options open up to more Javascript, some Java, and some app development languages like Swift and Objective-C and C++. Because you are exposed to a bunch of different types of programming languages, you can find which you prefer and want to pursue."

rit,33mh64,sito-rit,1 point,Fri Apr 24 15:06:12 2015 UTC,"Since they are two different majors, you'd either need to switch or see if you can dual major. People switch majors all the time so switching shouldn't be an issue, especially early on. During orientation week, you'll get a chance to talk with your adviser before school even starts to see what is needed to switch majors. You can probably switch before you even come here by messaging advisers during the summer. You can also talk to them about dual majoring as well."

rit,33mjo4,abacateazul,11,Thu Apr 23 19:04:34 2015 UTC,My suggestion.  Major in CS or SE and then do a minor or dual major in Game Design.  The GD industry is pretty saturated with devs and unless your going to go out and make your own games you have a better chance of getting a normal programming job than a GD job right out of college.
rit,33mjo4,Knoxie_89,6,Thu Apr 23 19:19:31 2015 UTC,"Listen to this advice if you're interested in coding games. The chances of getting a developer job at a game developer is insanely hard. It's better to have a general coding degree and have interests that lead to game development.  If you're more interested in the art aspect of design, then you might want to look into the 3D Digital Design major. They do a lot of environmental stuff, 3D character design and creation, etc. If you're more interested in UI / interface design, look into the New Media Design major. Although they mostly do interfaces on the web / mobile platform, you can expand this to apply to games. If you're more interested in concept work, look into the Illustration major. They do a lot of sketch work and both digital and traditional illustrations.  With either of these majors, you can also minor in Game Design. This will give you access to all the game-specific courses offered here, such as level design, game theory, etc."
rit,33mjo4,Hanachio,2,Thu Apr 23 20:53:25 2015 UTC,"I really suck at programming. But you are both right: programming is a more viable option.   Thank you, you guys give me a lot of things to think about."
rit,33mjo4,Hanachio,2,Fri Apr 24 01:15:43 2015 UTC,"The game design major is primarily programming anyway. I'm not sure what your exact interests in game development are, but if you told us, perhaps we could help you more?"
rit,33mjo4,Hanachio,1 point,Fri Apr 24 02:07:44 2015 UTC,"I intend to work on the creative area: drawing, 3D, storytelling, art concept. I dont know for dure wich one to Chose, but in more inclined to Story and art concept."
rit,33mjo4,WildStarBerry,2,Fri Apr 24 03:43:48 2015 UTC,"I would say go for the 3DDD or the Illustration major then. Although, you should definitely think about having a back up since it's hard to get jobs in those fields unless you're really good.  The Game Design and Development major is more geared toward programmers and game design in the sense of strategy and level design and theories. The design part in GDD isn't really art design. If you're interested in the art aspect on games, you'll need to look elsewhere. Once again, minor in Game Design would be great, although you'll definitely have to take a few programming courses."
rit,33mjo4,Hanachio,2,Fri Apr 24 13:04:26 2015 UTC,"I would not necessarily advise the 3DDD major over GDD if you're interested in 3D modelling unless you also minor in GDD. From what my friends in that major say, they do not learn the process of making very optimized assets. From the development angle, though CS and SE will probably look better immediately on a resume, but it's not like HR completely ignores a GDD student. For the most part, the non lazy students still tend to get decent jobs or goto grad school. I know several RIT GDD alumni that now work for game companies now. I personally don't think it hinders your chances to any significant degree."
rit,33mjo4,WildStarBerry,2,Fri Apr 24 17:36:58 2015 UTC,"Being a GDD major doesn't hinder your chances, but being a CS or SE major opens more doors. As a CS major, you're most likely going to have skills to do any sort of programming job, whether that be app, game, or engine development. This isn't to say GDD majors can't do they same, but they take specialty courses as well which have to do with gaming in specific (which can be accessed by doing the Game Design minor).  And I think OP said he was more interested in the design aspect of games, so I wouldn't recommend the GDD major since it is primarily focused on programming (from what I've seen the past few years). GDD is a lot more closely related to CS than any sort of art major.  And although the 3DDD major doesn't deal with optimal asset production with low poly count, that's not the only thing important with 3D production. My friend was explaining to me how 3D artists tend to focus on one or two specialties, whether that be modeling, texturing, lighting, rigging, etc. The only thing that the 3DDD major wouldn't cater to is the modeling aspect (since they deal with more high-poly models used in video production and still frame renders)."
rit,33mjo4,Hanachio,1 point,Fri Apr 24 18:32:48 2015 UTC,"It's more group project heavy than programming heavy specifically. There are definitely issues with GDD though, and the fact that it's basically games undeclared is one of my many qualms with it."
rit,33mjo4,WildStarBerry,1 point,Fri Apr 24 19:14:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I mean, I've seen some really cool things come out of those labs, but for safety of mind and career, CS is better, imo."

rit,33mjo4,WildStarBerry,1 point,Fri Apr 24 19:31:29 2015 UTC,"That's for sure, and it would be a bonus to have the game design / development experience. But you can't deny that some people might look at your resume and see ""Game Design"" and not take you as seriously. I mean, recently I think people are becoming more open to the prospect, but older, more established non-gaming companies will most likely be turned off by that label.  I mean, the same argument goes for GPA. Some companies filter for GPA while others will give you their time of day if you have some awesome projects."
rit,33mjo4,Hanachio,1 point,Fri Apr 24 19:34:04 2015 UTC,"A lot of GDD end up working for Microsoft and Amazon so I can't verify that big companies care that much. As for gaming companies, or something related to the gaming industry, it is a major that hasn't been around too long (maybe a decade?) so many of the older developers might have been likely to Major in GDD if it were around."

People will hoard all over you when they need to print their reports. Here is a list of On-campus jobs. Although there are official listings, most jobs are word of mouth or not advertised, so it's advised for you to go around to various locations asking if they have openings once you get to RIT. I'm assuming this is what you mean by work-study? Honestly, there's Wi-Fi all over campus, so you'll rarely be using your data. Coverage is fairly good for the most part, outside of some of the older academic buildings (no cell reception due to walls). Most notably, the Booth / Gannett basements (art buildings). I'm sure there's more no-signal locations, but that's the spot I experience it most. I'm also on T-Mobile, but I think some other carriers work there. Once again, there's Wi-Fi everywhere so just get a Wi-Fi messenger app and you'll be fine. There isn't a huge difference. When I was a freshmen, there was mainstream and regular housing. Mainstream was for combined RIT and NTID students while regular housing was just for hearing students, I think, but I don't think they make this distinction anymore? Like you mentioned, there is special interest housing with cool perks. Besides that, Kate Gleason Hall, Sol Heuman Hall, Nathaniel Rochester Hall, and Ellingson are the only taller buildings with AC (It gets surprisingly hot here sometimes)."

I recall hearing from an adult somewhere along the lines (not directly from rit) that you normally contact the college to register for a work-study program. i don't know anyone at my high school that's even doing one though, so they aren't much help...  5 - thanks for the answer. i more or less meant like if one building was build more recently (may look a bit newer/cleaner/updated etc) or if one is known for a bit bigger dorms or if there are certain floor layouts to each... i know ellingson has 4 rooms of 2 (well, an RA is in one and that's the only dorm i know off the top of my head) that share a bathroom, but is there differences in other buildings?  i'm more or less just wondering what to expect when i start. i've been on tours and to open houses a few times, but they don't show you very much to be honest.."
rit,33n1f7,Hanachio,1 point,Thu Apr 23 21:42:00 2015 UTC,"I have that work study stuff on my financial aid, but I just ignored it and got an on-campus job and that suited me just fine. I don't know anyone who went through that, so I couldn't tell you. None of the freshmen dorms were built recently. I'm just going to assume the ones with the ACs are the most recent, but that's not saying much at all.   Here's a quick FAQ for incoming students if you're interested.  Just make sure to join a lot of clubs, leave your dorm room open, put yourself out there, don't skip classes, and have fun. Freshman year kind of sucks that you're dorming with some random person, but you won't forget it for a long time. Just make sure to have responsible fun."

This is not the case at all, there is no occupational placement program that I know of. If you want to work part-time you should browse the official listings another user linked to, but also go around to buildings in person and check (i.e. the library, your college's dean's office, miscellaneous offices). There are a lot of gigs on campus but you have to go look for them (I personally interviewed for one during orientation week and have been there the 4 years since)."

If it's empty then someone picks your same room.  If it has people living it in ... well become friends.  You don't get to pick people, you do get to pick your room.  2 - Yes  3 - I can't help you there  4 - I have AT&T .. it's pretty good service all in all  5 - Nothing majorly different between the buildings."

You are not required to find a roommate though we think it's a nice opportunity to introduce yourself to some other incoming freshman and find someone conducive to your living style. But, in the event that you do not find your own roommate, there will be one placed with you.  You are certainly allowed to have your own printer. Here's a list of some other things we suggest you bring as well!  In essence, the dorm buildings and rooms are the same. As you mentioned, some of the buildings do have AC and some have elevators, but floor layout, facilities, RA's, and rooms are the same. You may be interested in our special interest houses which each have their own amenities. More info on Special Interest Houses here."

She regularly assigns a level of work that has forced me to ignore other responsibilities and commitments to complete it on time. She doesn't seem to recognize that 8-12 hours of work a week is unreasonable for a 3 credit-hour course. She doesn't respect student's personal space. She's often rude to the students for not understanding or getting lost.

Just a word of warning though: MCC's online system is, believe it or not, worse than SIS, and it's a struggle to get a transcript sent over (I did a duel enrollment during highschool so I already went through that once).  If you plan on taking classes at different times, say this summer and next, wait to request your transcript so that you can get all your classes transferred at once rather than dealing with it yearly.

With that said, I would never say what happened to the secretary is OK. It certainly is not. Boarders should be more careful.  But it's messed up how, if this didn't happen to admin or their staff,  the administration probably wouldn't be enforcing this so heavily. It goes to show the admin's only care about their own kind."
rit,33cfk0,RITAdviceGuy,1 point,Wed Apr 22 03:24:31 2015 UTC,"Hows this any different than enforcing of any minor rule any where? Think about it.  Cops-May not enforce underage drinking or pot use at a large event. As soon as someone gets hurt/killed and there is a fuss about, you can be damn sure they will enforce it next year because their bosses demand it.  Referees-Let infractions go all the time. But once the governing body becomes aware that its changing the game, they send orders down to throw the book at people.   Campus Safety-Probably not worth their time to enforce bikers or boarders on the 1/4 mile. During the day there is only four officers and a road supervisor on. It takes 25% to 50% of their staff to enforce this. Plus they spend a shit ton of time doing lock-outs, escorts, injury reports, fire alarms, etc. So its not worth their time to enforce it unless their bosses bosses boss says so."
rit,33cfk0,MillerRoad,1 point,Wed Apr 22 12:33:12 2015 UTC,I know a student who was expelled because they got into a fight with a campus safety officer because they tried to stop them from skate boarding from dorms to the academic buildings.

rit,3397ch,Latibulate,8,Mon Apr 20 17:49:10 2015 UTC,"Cost would factor more into my decision than location if I were you. I remember looking into Stevens, but their financial aid offers weren't anything to write home about. On the other hand, RIT gives a lot of financial aid, and RIT's sticker price is lower, too. The financial factor I failed to consider was cost of living. Relative to the Boston or NYC area, I unknowingly saved  close to $10k over four years on rent and food."
rit,3397ch,NewtAgain,10,Mon Apr 20 18:03:42 2015 UTC,Rochester is pretty cheap living even in the city.
rit,3397ch,mullaneywt,4,Mon Apr 20 19:02:47 2015 UTC,"About 15 years ago, I looked at Stevens and RIT, among various other schools.  I too grew up near NYC and the thought of being close to that and the city life, along with friends and family, was very appealing.  In addition, Stevens gave me significant financial aid/scholarship, which if I recall correctly, was nearly a free ride.  In the end I decided to come to RIT and I don't regret that decision.  I still live and work in Rochester, in my field/major, own a home, am doing well, etc.  Rochester is a great place, though certainly much different than NYC.  I enjoyed the corporate look of the campus, which has softened in the interim years.  At the time, RIT offered a first rate degree program in Information Technology, Stevens did not.  RIT also had a huge and successful co-op program, which if I remember correctly bested Stevens.    I can sum up my time at RIT with this:  The facilities for my major were excellent.  The students were decent (knowledgeable enough to foster some competition, but still open to teamwork).  The staff was largely touch and go, as was the curriculum, with some real rockstars, and some real duds, and a lot of dare I say mediocrity.  I worked at an on-campus job, and that taught my a variety of skills, both in the technical realm and in terms of project and people management.  Overall, I enjoyed my time, and despite having things like student loans now, I don't regret my decision.  Your mileage may vary depending on career/major and how much Stevens may have changed for the better or worse in the last 15 years."
rit,3397ch,radioalex,4,Mon Apr 20 21:52:19 2015 UTC,"As an RIT Grad (IT) I am happy with my choice.  I now live near Hoboken and know a lot of Stevens Students and Graduates.  I like both areas for different reasons.    I would focus more on the program and if the school would be a good fit based on what you want to get out of it.  Both areas have their positives and negatives but explaining how I feel about them from my point of view gives you little value.   I thought about looking at Stevens but they did not have an IT program at the time (late 1990's).  RIT seemed to have their stuff together.  Also almost every student / teacher at the time said hey, you come here, coop, and get hired after coop.  You finish part time.  Sure enough that was true for me.    Sure the job market is not what it was then for the tech world but they never mis-represented the opportunities.    Hoboken is an amazing walkable city.   Rochester? Don't forget your car.  You will be sick of the bricks but it's worth it in the end."
rit,3397ch,cddotdotslash,2,Tue Apr 21 00:14:18 2015 UTC,"I went to RIT, graduated, and then moved to NYC. In my opinion, that's the better order of things. Rochester is cheap as hell compared to NYC, and it's better to be in Rochester during college when you have no money. Once you graduate, find a nice paying job in NYC, which is much more enjoyable when you actually have money to spend on things.  As for academics, the co-op program at RIT is what got me my job now and every interview I've ever had. I count it as one of the biggest factors in my success so far."

rit,33ahb0,creepystains,3,Tue Apr 21 02:38:02 2015 UTC,I don't learn well from books so I never buy them. Also there's always a way to get them for free. What I hate most is being forced to buy a book just to get access to the shitty online homework assignments (webassign/masteringphysics).
rit,33ahb0,LookAround,1 point,Tue Apr 21 01:09:39 2015 UTC,Man that is hands down the biggest scam. It pretty much destroys any used textbook market for that course as you need the online access code which usually costs more than you could just get a used book for. At our uni for a little while they had an option to opt out of any online material that you had to pay for in return for an alternative assignment. As you can probably guess no one went with that option as the online assignments are generally easy marks even though you have to pay like $40-50 for the access code.
rit,33ahb0,Saijin_Naib,6,Tue Apr 21 02:41:54 2015 UTC,That it is a massive scam that I won't buy in to

rit,336pow,itsnickk,12,Mon Apr 20 01:32:31 2015 UTC,"Serious question. If a lot of people (including myself) have problems spending all of the food debit they are forced by the university to buy, why not allow students who live in the dorms to purchase it using a tier based system? It seems that every year the amount of debit that a student much purchase increases. What is the reason for this?"
rit,336pow,ghostofrit,3,Mon Apr 20 02:15:32 2015 UTC,"My assumption is that RIT food services bases much of their budgeting decisions (number of employees, food distributors, materials, etc) based on the number of students enrolled in meal plans. If that amount is variable (allowing students refunds), it would make that budgeting more difficult.  If you know you aren't going to spend all of your debit, you can get on a reduced debit meal plan if you talk with them and can show that you have health reasons, religious reasons, or a job or something else like university athletics that will result in you missing meals (for example). I was able to do that when I was required to be on a meal plan, and it was difficult to accomplish."
rit,336pow,davidb_,1 point,Mon Apr 20 04:01:23 2015 UTC,"That is a great question, and I don't have the exact answer of the top of my head.  I do know that RIT is required by law to have students living in Residence Halls have a meal plan with debit. The Dining department is actually currently re-evaluating the debit system in general, so this is a great time to get those questions to them and I'll be sure to bring it up at the next meetings."
rit,336pow,SharpMind94,3,Mon Apr 20 02:19:18 2015 UTC,Don't mean to bring this post down. Great idea.   But why not just have it rollover to next year?
rit,336pow,SharpMind94,2,Mon Apr 20 01:39:30 2015 UTC,"Also illegal under NYS law. Also it might have to to do with RIT's fiscal year ending on July 1st.  But I think that obviously would be the best option, but that solution takes years of* effort. In the meantime, this was a solution that we found really easy to implement immediately (aka the ""much better than nothing"" approach)."
rit,336pow,CaptainTachyon,3,Mon Apr 20 01:47:28 2015 UTC,There's gotta be a way around this. I will probably have about 200 in debit. I would much rather use next year than wasting it.
rit,336pow,CaptainTachyon,2,Mon Apr 20 01:50:36 2015 UTC,As of right now there is either waste it or don't spend it and it helps nobody. We're just trying to put in a 3rd option that people can at least benefit from while we wrangle NYS tax code.

rit,336pow,CommanderCuntPunt,3,Mon Apr 20 01:51:18 2015 UTC,"A consistent effort from SG? Nope, but we've finally put the safeguards in place to transition prior SG committees and administration's work over to the next year, so now's the time to start that kind of thinking.  Up until now it was basically    SG administration takes office with new goals > progress done on goals, but not all finished > new SG administration takes office with new goals > and so on, and so on.    But we can start looking into that stuff through our new Dining committee and save that work for the next years."

rit,336pow,findme_,3,Mon Apr 20 02:04:11 2015 UTC,"I am very curious as to the actual law that ""prohibits"" debit rolling over to the next year.

The answer to OP's question is the same for why costs are rising in all areas of higher education - the abundance of cheap student loans (which means students making poor financial decisions - just because you qualify for higher student loans doesn't mean you should accept them).  Advice for any student - take personal responsibility for your finances and be smart with your money.

rit,334pk0,BLU42,6,Sun Apr 19 21:32:56 2015 UTC,"<rant>Somebody's gotta pay for the fat administrative overhead and the commercialization of higher education.</rant>  In all seriousness, it is expensive to provide on-campus housing and some apartment complexes, like Riverknoll and Colony, are aging and the price of upkeeping these units is only going to increase. Also, NYS and possibly federal law imposes many more regulations on student housing than a generic apartment complex. An example of one of those restrictions would be the monthly firecode inspections. A regular off-campus apartment complex doesn't have to compete with those regulations, so they can offer lower rates.  Lastly, the federal government is starting to crack down on tuition increases. If you do your own research, you'll find that the rate of tuition price increases is beginning to level somewhat after a few decades of growth (far exceeding the rate of inflation). For the institute to continue to raise revenues, expect the compartmentalizing of fees so you can hear things like 'tuition only went up 2%'. Compartmentalization of fees is kind of a loophole to only slight increases in tuition. You have to keep the institute's aggregate income sources and expenditures in mind when you see things like huge, unexplainable spikes in rates."

rit,334pk0,Beatleboy62,17,Sun Apr 19 17:19:58 2015 UTC,"Replacing the cheapest housing on campus with duplicates of one of the most expensive options is not  going to solve the affordability issue, though."

I agree 100 percent, I like in Riverknoll, and while it ain't the Ritz, it's cheap and I love it, and it's more than suitable for my needs. A bathroom, a kitchen with a sink, oven, stove and cabinets, a bedroom, I'm happy. Really, if they just built a more permanant form of Riverknoll type modular housing (even with a 3rd or fourth level) it'd be great."
rit,334pk0,itsnickk,3,Sun Apr 19 18:43:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah the issue there is that UC and GV are always the top on campus choices for housing. I personally brought up this affordability issue at a meeting I had with them as well, but how can they fight the fact that students prefer the most expensive housing?"
rit,334pk0,ht5k,2,Sun Apr 19 23:30:35 2015 UTC,"If your last paragraph was true, that would imply that RIT Housing is generating a net profit for RIT. If /u/rit_housing confirmed that this was the case, I'd be less bothered by the increases. At least that'd mean that students are getting something for their money. I'm concerned as to what the rationale for the grossly-above-market-rate increases is, and I suspect it's just going to fund even more administrative overhead at RIT."
rit,334pk0,RITAdviceGuy,3,Sun Apr 19 18:45:40 2015 UTC,"If you bothered looking at the budget year to year, you'll find that what you're paying for is more financial aid. Financial aid increases more year to year than tuition and fees. It doesn't help that the endowment isn't any larger, so what it pays out doesn't change."

rit,334pk0,RITBehindTheBricks,1 point,Mon Apr 20 01:39:50 2015 UTC,"You hit the nail on the head.   Administrative overhead and the compartmentalization of costs for higher education are two of my biggest issues here (and at every college). The State has literally told RIT they cannot increase tuition rates like they have been because it's too high, so you see this compartmentalization of fees (Parking, Student Activity Fees, Housing/Dining) to make up for that fact.  Also when I met with Housing, the costs for keeping all of the 1000 units on this campus up to the ever evolving codes is a huge factor. They recently had a sprinkler system upgrade to the fire code that caused an unexpected cost for housing in the millions.  I just moved off campus next year because I'm done paying $1000/month for an apartment I can get 2x or 3x the space for $400/month  downtown, but there's always the convenience factor of being on campus that you pay for."
rit,334pk0,bammerburn,1 point,Mon Apr 20 01:38:16 2015 UTC,"We reached out to Ross Koenig, RIT's Assistant Vice President for Budget & Financial Planning Services, for comment. Here's what he had to say:  ""Student Auxiliary Services (SAS), the unit which runs both Housing and Dining operations on campus, is managed essentially as a 'business' within RIT which is intended to cover its own cost of operations.  Its operating expenses are kept separate from the instructional expenses of the university and include an assignment of all facilities expenses (utilities, maintenance, etc.) and administrative expenses (payroll, accounting, legal, etc.).  SAS actively benchmarks its apartment rates against not only peer universities, but also the local apartment market as they have active competition near campus.  The intent is to set equitable rental rates which allow these auxiliary operations to be self-sufficient and not be subsidized by tuition revenues which are intended for RIT’s instructional mission.  In comparing rates, it is important to keep in mind the following:   RIT’s rental rates are for the academic term only, whereas non-RIT landlords typically require students to sign 12-month leases, whether they intend to study in the summer or not.  This can make monthly rate comparisons misleading. RIT’s housing units typically turnover each year, that is they have new tenants annually.  This changeover involves expenses to which non-University landlords are not typically exposed.""   We hope this helps."

rit,32v6vn,LtPowers,16,Fri Apr 17 22:11:02 2015 UTC,"This is going to make me sound old, but so be it.  You have no idea how good you have it.  In the early 90s, college dining halls were considered the worst of the worst. As bad as airline food. Books about going off to college always, always warned about the horrible cafeteria food on every campus. It was bad.  But then there was RIT. RIT was quite literally ahead of the curve on offering higher quality and more variety in their dining options. Gracie's was a MODEL. Anyone who'd gone to college elsewhere was amazed at Gracie's.  Now, keep in mind, at the time there was no all-debit meal plan. So everyone ate at either Gracie's or the Dining Commons at least once a day. If you had debit on your account, you might treat yourself to Nate's once or twice a week. There was the Corner Store, the RITskeller, and the Cafeteria above it. Henry's in the Eastman Building, but students never went there. That's it.  Now,  yes... the world has become a lot more conscious of healthy eating over the last 20 years. Certainly college food has gotten universally better; it's tough to overstate how bad the situation used to be. And it might be fair to say RIT has failed to stay ahead of the curve.  But it's very difficult for me to look at the variety and quality of dining options on campus and agree that it's a complete wasteland. Keep in mind that there are tens of thousands of students, faculty, and staff to feed every day; the exigencies of volume and cost mean that you're simply not going to get the highest quality. Dining Services does an incredible job given their restrictions.  And beyond that, I have always -- dating back 20 years -- found Dining Services to be open to improvement. They truly, truly want to give students food they want to eat. Talk to them; they will listen."
rit,32v6vn,Knarpulous,5,Fri Apr 17 12:25:47 2015 UTC,"It's still better than many college campuses. My sister's college only had two dining halls, one of which only served one meal and a salad option, and my cousin's school only has fast food options like Burger King, Taco Bell, etc."
rit,32v6vn,RITAdviceGuy,16,Fri Apr 17 17:34:35 2015 UTC,"From personal experience, I find the Global Village grill to offer substantially less greasy meals with higher quality ingredients over nearly every other on-campus dining facility. There is certainly a price premium; GV grill is a little bit more expensive than most RIT dining options (and coincidentally or not, you'll also find it conveniently located near the Financial Services building, and lots of hungry admins eat there). If quality is your top priority, I really would give the GV grill a second chance. Get one of their burgers and then walk over to Crossroads and order one. It simply isn't comparable. And it makes sense, given the pricing."
rit,32v6vn,burgerboy9n,11,Fri Apr 17 00:35:03 2015 UTC,"Quick plug from a Salsaritas employee (not speaking officially though). Everything is made fresh every day. We have people come in starting at 7:30am to start making salsas, guacamole, grill steak, grill chicken, fry chips, fry hard tacos, fry salad shells, and prepare everything you see.   GV grille is pretty much all fresh not greasy stuff unless you come on philly day, burger day, or pizza and wings night (Friday by the way), or request your fish to be fried during seafarers. Tongiht's Korean BBQ used an amazingly grilled flank steak, all homemade sauces, about 10 different vegetables to grill with, korean ""side dishes"", and an assortment of appetizers. Its one of my favorites.  Hey, and please speak up to one of the supervisors at Salsaritas or GV if something isn't up to your liking. At most times of the day there are two full-time chefs and at least two supervisors on duty and will answer any of your questions."

You're complaining that you have to walk a little farther to get to it? Boo hoo.   Did you bring the raw food to a manager? Both Sols and the Corner store have suggestion boxes if you want them to stock something they don't.

rit,32v6vn,SnowDog2112,7,Fri Apr 17 15:24:42 2015 UTC,"Corner Store employee here, I've worked there over 4 years. We sell what students buy, plain and simple. We are a convenience store, not Wegmans. Sure, there are mountains of soda and cookies and chips, but the number of healthy options has increased tenfold since I started there. In the soup aisle (the middle one) there are all kinds of organic things. The black cases, on the opposite side of the cashier island from the entrance, there are plenty of fruits, some veggies, and assorted prepackaged healthy meals.   This is dating back 5 years now, but when I was visiting other colleges, it seemed like they had a fraction of the food choices RIT has. No other school came close to RIT in dining choices and variety. I'm about to graduate, and I'm still finding menu items I hadn't noticed before. If you can't find something you like to eat, you're seriously not looking very hard."
rit,32v6vn,superhighway,6,Fri Apr 17 13:39:12 2015 UTC,"Do you want cheese with that whine? All I hear are a bunch of excuses for not wanting to actually find the healthier options on campus or not wanting to make a trip to wegmans every once and a while.

rit,32v6vn,derpaderp1,3,Fri Apr 17 16:40:24 2015 UTC,"Seriously. Every dining place offers pre packages salad or fruit. Some do subs. The problem is OP is a picky eater and thinks it's the schools fault he's lazy and picky. ""Commons pizza sucks because I like thick crust not thin cut!!"" Wahhhh"

rit,32v6vn,Hanachio,2,Fri Apr 17 15:22:16 2015 UTC,"By the way, I'm not sure if anyone mentioned this, but there are several kitchens in dorm-side. Or course, they're public space that is reservable, so you can look into reserving it for yourself and a small group of friends (I'm not sure if they'll let you reserve alone). Or perhaps you can just ask to use it when it's open.  Locations that I know of include SOL Activity Room (1st floor SOL), 1st floor of KGH (to the right when entering from the quarter mile), and underground in whatever building International House is in. The International House kitchen is for members only, so if you have a friend in there, you can ask to use it with them and have a little cooking party! Most of these kitchens have basic cooking supplies in them (pots, pans, tongs, etc.)  You can probably buy supplies at the Market (next to Salsarita's) or some other on-campus food places. You can also take a bus ride to Wegmans for cooking supplies! :)"
rit,32v6vn,corner0ffice1,2,Fri Apr 17 13:46:27 2015 UTC,"Like everyone else said, just move to an apartment. On-campus food is overpriced as hell, and although RIT does decently, they're still serving mass-prepared cafeteria food and snacks at the end of the day. Living in the dorms, it's what, $4000/year for food? $4000/32 weeks = $125/week on food. That's outrageous! You could spend half that at Wegmans and eat like a king. You could literally eat rib-eye steak every day for dinner for $125/week.   You only have to live in those shitty, glorified closets that cost $1600/month between two people for another five weeks. After that, it's on you if you're dumb enough to stay in the dorms or Global Village.   I have nothing nice to say about the ""college experience"" of being forced to live in a closet for a year. I gained 20 lbs my freshman year because of the food, and while a lot of that was my own damn fault, it was shockingly easy to lose it once I got off campus."
rit,32v6vn,greenlibrarian,2,Fri Apr 17 18:43:06 2015 UTC,"There are a ton of places to eat on campus and you mentioned like 3 of them. You need to get out more.  What's so bad about making a fruit salad in a to-go container and then going? BTW, the Ritz and Xroads has stuff to-go."

I've been toying with the idea of trying to teach a class on cooking in the dorms, as I also struggled with a decent meal way back when I was in college.  That said, I've never actually been in any of RIT's dorms.  Would there be interest if I could make arrangements to teach a class in an actual dorm kitchen?"
rit,32v6vn,Siath,0,Fri Apr 17 12:38:08 2015 UTC,"I would be interested. The thing is that there's a few dorms that have a kitchen. The thing is, its not in all of the dorms. I would love to see how to cook real food in the dorm. Rather than eating processed crap."

Though - I would be planning on getting food from Wegmans, since that is an option considering the bus."
rit,32v6vn,TheCommonsRIT,1 point,Fri Apr 17 15:09:02 2015 UTC,"I guess I don't see the problem. The healthiest options on campus that I am aware of:  Crossroads has salads, reasonable sandwiches, and a small market.  As mentioned, there is the market at global village.  There are healthy options at most dining facilities, though admittedly not a ton.  Really though, I am curious as to what you are expecting. You seem to want a plethora of options in both the markets and at the dining facilities. RIT is a campus, not a grocery store. There are plenty of grocery stores as well as multiple ethnic and health focused stores in the area that you could walk, bike, drive, or take the bus to. You seem far too upset about a fairly non-existent problem."

rit,32v6vn,Ebscer,1 point,Sun Apr 19 00:34:55 2015 UTC,"My explanation would be there is a limited amount of space on campus, there are already two stores on that side, though they may not sell exactly what you want, and, most importantly, walking is good for you.   Can you explain what the problem is?"
rit,32v6vn,xzzz,1 point,Sun Apr 19 01:42:15 2015 UTC,"Healthy stuff you can get every day at The Commons:  A pasta toss made with whole wheat pasta, fresh vegetables, and grilled chicken cooked right in front of you. Many of the chef's specials are healthy, especially at lunch, and most of the dinners offer at least one fresh steamed vegetable as a side. From the grill your healthiest option is the grilled chicken, get it on wheat bread or without a bun (we call that ""homeless""). We spend literally hours every day trimming fat from chicken breasts, marinating, grilling, and slicing the fresh chicken used at each station. We have veggie burgers, black bean burgers, and grilled portabella mushrooms at the grill. Our burgers are a fairly lean beef. We do a lot of grilled chicken specials at the grill as well. There are turkey, grilled chicken, and vegetable options at the sub shop and I won't even bother enumerating the healthy salad options.  In the grab and go section we always carry cut fruit, veggie trays, premade salads, yogurt, Greek yogurt, hard boiled eggs, and we get sushi from Oishii Sushi brought in at least twice per day. We have fresh fruit at the registers. We have a variety of low calorie/zero calorie soda options if iced tea, bottled juices, milk, or water are not to your liking.  I personally eat at The Commons 2 meals a day, five days a week. I don't gain weight because I consistently choose the healthy options available. It helps that I really like grilled chicken."
rit,32v6vn,Hamsamwich,1 point,Sun Apr 19 23:57:55 2015 UTC,"Healthy stuff that you can get every day at Gracie's: Salad with chicken, tuna, hummus, eggs, and a ton of different vegetables. Fresh fruit, cut fruit, yogurt.  The Mongolian grill is almost always a variety of meats and fresh vegetables that you can have cooked to order, usually over rice. There is often a whole wheat pasta option. There are healthy sandwich options. There are typically always at least two kinds of grilled chicken at the grill. And then there is the Simply Eats station that is allergen free and typically everything on it is made from fresh ingredients. There is also usually at least one healthy cereal option available, wheat bagels, juices, soy milk, etc., etc., etc.. If you can't find healthy food at Gracie's you must not be looking very hard. All of the pizza, fried food, burgers, cakes, etc. are available for the people that want that sort of thing, just don't eat that, choose the healthy stuff."
rit,32v6vn,Hamsamwich,1 point,Mon Apr 20 00:06:39 2015 UTC,"Your best bet is to move off campus.  RIT has no idea what healthy food is. They offer tofu and rice for the vegans, but that is about it. The idea of using lean meat or fresh fruits and vegetables is completely foreign to them.  Honestly your best bet is Wegmans. I lost 20 pounds as soon as I could get my own apartment and cook for myself..."
rit,32v6vn,Hanachio,6,Fri Apr 17 02:26:19 2015 UTC,"If you don't know what to get, sure it's unhealthy.   Sizzling salad at Ritz is pretty healthy (minus the oil they use...) and filling. They're generous on the meat amount and you can add all the veggies along with an egg. As long as you get a low-caloric dressing you'll be fine. Of course, you don't want to eat this too many times a week if you want to keep your sanity... Lettuce wrapped burgers and grilled chicken sandwiches at Crossroads. Order like a double cheeseburger or a grilled chicken and then toss away the bread. Walk over to the condiments and get a bunch of lettuce to wrap your meat with (lol). Much protein, little carb, wow. Gracies is easy, just get grilled meats and veggies and don't eat deep fried stuff. Nathan's soups (the actual soups) are fine, their breads and sandwiches aren't too good for you though. (All of their wraps/croissants fillings are mayo-based, I mean IIFYM...whatever)"

rit,32ouy7,t8ke,17,Wed Apr 15 14:54:46 2015 UTC,"Well we had a town hall meeting about why the Counseling Center is a piece of shit. After that meeting, they hired at least one new counselor, got another intake coordinator, and invited an outside review board to point out the glaring flaws. So all in all I'd say they had a good year with regards to the things I'm passionate about."
rit,32ouy7,Mr_Rippe,3,Wed Apr 15 19:38:27 2015 UTC,"My first bipolar manic episode (pre-diagnosis) was at RIT in Spring of 2011. I stayed that summer and as I came down from the manic high I crashed straight into the deepest depression of my life and came dangerously close to contemplating suicide. I'd bang my head against the dorm shower wall. I'd walk a few miles up the road and fantasize about just standing in front of the train, or just disappearing like another student had months before. It was that bad.  I finally called myself into the hospital at the end of the summer when the mania started ramping up again and I could feel my brain plummeting. Afterwards, the administration told my parents that they were aware of what was going on and they thought I was schizophrenic (turned out not to be the case, thank god). They KNEW what was going on, they were tracking my activities on campus, and they did nothing. They watched my sanity dissolve as I proceeded to freak people the FUCK out on campus. I went to the counseling center during both the manic period and depression period. I thought they were helping at the time, but looking back it should have been CLEAR that something was wrong- someone with manic psychosis should be like a fucking alarm bell ringing in the middle of the counseling center. Any competent mental health facility would have had me hospitalized.  But they didn't. So many staff members knew, especially a couple high-ranking ones and ones who mutually knew of the problem, and they just watched me burn. There were SO MANY red flags and different times that someone could have stepped in and done the right thing- I'm literally counting them in my head right now. The school GAVE ME MONEY from one of their budgets to put up this completely psychotic display in a main building. My RA had to know something was very wrong because I was acting like an insane person on my floor every week. At no point did anyone make an attempt to put a stop to the psychotic break.  Point is, I’m glad to hear that something is actively being done to try and fix this problem. I’m okay now, but I’ve wrestled with what happened and the school’s handling of it (or rather lack thereof) since then. My parents will never forgive them for doing nothing and then being so brazen as to tell them they watched it happen. I don’t know if I could forgive a handful of particular staff and admins. I couldn’t bare to be at RIT because of the sheer amount of people who now permanently think of me as a crazy person, people I still had to walk by every day, and I moved home a couple years ago. I can talk about this because it’s been…wow, four years, but at the time this was a nightmare for everyone around me, people who I’ll never have a chance to ask forgiveness for what I put them through, and I have to live with that to this day and make peace with it.   So that’s what’s on the line here. There are permanent scars on my psyche because of what this school did to me, so if you can prevent that from happening even once more you could save another person’s sanity. Thanks."

rit,32ouy7,itsnickk,18,Thu Apr 16 13:54:08 2015 UTC,"As the Director of Services, I can't speak for Ashley and Tyler. I can however highlight some of our accomplishments, specifically focusing on services offerings.   Better Break Bus - The SG Break Bus for spring and Thanksgiving breaks was improved with online sign up. Using better questions and applying the data we collected, we were able to significantly reduce the cost of the program while better serving students. We saved the University about $1000 for the spring break bus, and will continue doing that for years to come.  RITPedia revival - RITPedia is an information source for students and those outside of RIT. RITpedia includes content available nowhere else. With about 5,000 monthly sessions, the revitalization of RITPedia has improved RIT's web presence. PawPrints - don't forget PawPrints wasn't just about the petitions that were answered. The creation of that system was a substantial effort. We've benefitted students at RIT and RPI. UofR has since delivered a very similar system. SG is a leader among SGs.  Bikeshare Improvements - The RIT Bikeshare website needed to be recreated after the first semester for reliability reasons. We managed that project, piloted a project to make the bikes legal for night use and created plans for the expansion to the west side of campus.    Excluding PawPrints petitions is an arbitrary limitation. Ashley & Tyler have been very involved in answering petitions and managing the team that responds to them. We have a 24 hour library because of their leadership. Zipcar is coming to campus because of their leadership. Things haven't been perfect, but this has been the most active SG administration in recent years."

rit,32ouy7,itsnickk,2,Thu Apr 16 03:58:55 2015 UTC,"I hadn't heard that, but we'll look into it. I think its pretty important to get that bike repair shop up soon as people bring their bikes back out."

We only have them at that one space because the ResLife office in Gleason was generous enough to handle the labor of handing out and storing the bike lock keys. We would need to find a way to hand out keys at Colony (or any other way) that didn't need to have a labor cost associated with it, which is the issue we hit there. Ideally, we would have this style bike rack where you could just swipe your ID and take out a bike, but the issue is that that system costs $70,000 and upward, and we're working with a couple grand to make this program happen."
rit,32ouy7,sgweb,2,Thu Apr 16 20:00:57 2015 UTC,"It's nothing a couple SE's, CE's, and ME's probably couldn't take on. I know SE does a senior project, perhaps ME's/CE's have something similar too. Forget about the limitations of pricey, automated, checkout systems. This is the kind of project that's ripe for the type of experiences RIT students should be having. It'd require a multidisciplinary skill set to achieve project success. Taking a step back, I wish we saw more cross-major collaboration in academia because it teaches students better soft skills (e.g., communicating with peers outside of your area of subject matter expertise) and, in my perhaps slightly biased opinion based, it allows you to take on projects have greater real-world impact. I don't know exactly why we see so little collaboration of students outside their majors, or if it's something the system as a whole needs to promote more, but it's something I would've liked to see in my program here at RIT."

rit,32ouy7,itsnickk,14,Wed Apr 15 15:31:59 2015 UTC,"Hey, this is Nick- I'm the current SG director of student relations, I've been with Ashley and Tyler since the beginning when creating their goals, and I'm usually the reddit liaison for SG (Ashley and Tyler don't really use reddit).  This is a great idea, let's go through their list of goals:   Continuing Greg and Phil’s plan for Laundry alert system and getting better laundry machines on campus.   Ashley and Tyler spoke with the guy in charge of laundry waay early on, and they had the plan in place to replace the laundry machines for the dorms/GV already- and they did. Still working on Riverknoll, Perkins, but that's a money and depreciation of asset issue so it's not really up to us.    Advocate for administration being more clear about future student housing plans and development.   In SG's housing committee, we are currently working with Housing Operations to create exactly this- I call it our ""cooperative development plan"" which details the future of student housing plans, as well as renovations, demolitions, etc .   Advocate for better living conditions for Riverknoll.   This has been a key issue every time we go to speak with Auxiliary Services, and has not been left out of any conversation. We've most certainaly advocated not only for better conditions in Riverknoll, but for a replacement for Riverknoll that is student budget friendly. We've heard that they expect to start building in 3 years (as they always say), so we're really working on making sure we have check-ups periodically throughout different SG administrations- and Ashley put in a new positions of Director of Operations for just that reason.   More collaboration between NTID and RIT through expanding deaf awareness week to a deaf awareness month on campus.   This was charged through to our Deaf Advocacy committee- it was really being planned for Spring Semester, but a member of SG left and they had all of the info and vision for it, so the plans are being pushed back to next year.    Continuing the exchange program between SG and NSC.   This program is being reworked- it was created last year during their administration, but left out a lot of other MSO's, and it was said that this exchange program should be beefed up to include those other orgs on campus. It will return fully functional next year when it's had some re-tweaking. In the meantime, we've established a Deaf Advocacy committee which fills a very similar role.    Work with interpreting services to ensure deaf or hard of hearing students aren’t denied access services when requesting for deaf events.     This has been looked into thoroughly during Fall Semester, and it comes down to a hiring/budget problem within Access Services, not something that SG can directly help, but something that we still advocate for highly. Deaf Advocacy committee was once again created for issues such as these.   Establish more sound practices for NTID students for admission to RIT.   Ashley and Tyler have sat down and spoken with the President of NTID on many occasions, and this is just one of the goals that they have brought up and checked up on.    Improving school spirit through the promotion of events (both sports and recreational). Student Government attending more competitions going on throughout campus.   We have attended a ton of major events (and minor events for clubs!) throughout this year. I don't really need to get into more detail than that.    Open up a  place to study for 24 hours on campus.   Tyler headed the 24 Hour Library committee with our Greek senator Peter, and made this happen. in one semester. This was honestly crazy, given the amount of departments that needed to be in on this process, and it happened because they took that initiative. This is clue #1 that the OP has not really looked into what SG has done before casting blame on Ashley and Tyler's administration.    Advocating for students with software and lab needs to have access to labs and computers for longer hours (ex: CIAS Students, Engineers, GCCIS students)   We have had a 24hr lab committee all year, but the person in charge of the committee took interest in having the library be the 24 hour study area instead, because we got a lot of negative feedback from Deans and security issues and stuff. Personally I think it should still be considered, and worked on next year.   Expand the bike share program to allow people to check out bikes in different areas of campus.   We are in the final stages of this right now, headed by Ashley. This is definitely happening. Different area check-out is tough because of space, but we'll see as the program continues.   Implement bike fixing stations around campus.     RIT created a bike maintenance station right under the SAU when you're walking out towards the library. I've seen a lot more activity there lately, so I'm sure it's going to be opening soon.   Improve functionality with SIS   This was done by an initiative of the Student IT Office with their Tiger Center add-on, and SG heavily promoted this when it came out.   Integrate a database system so that students can see the syllabi of classes prior to registering for classes.   This goal is one that honestly fell through the cracks a little. I remember Tyler going to meetings for this in Fall Semester, but not everything can be done. Good reminder for next year.    Working towards having a rating system on SIS   SG is about to launch our own Teacher Evaluation site, due to the fact that we hit heavy resistance from faculty and admins on getting the current SmartEvals data. I just saw the site the other day, it looks great. Ashley and Tyler have been attending meetings all week on the thing.   Add another bus stop on campus by the Golisano Institute for Sustainability   This happened.   Work with parking and transportation to get a better bus schedule for people living in Racquet Club and the RIT Inn.   SG got an extra shuttle to go to the Inn very early on in Fall Semester. Getting more shuttles will be tough, though, since they are around $75k each route.    Work with parking and transportation to refine the parking permits.   SG released a resolution to President Destler asking to re-evaluate the parking permits, along with a large response from the student body on PawPrints. This has caused the Parking and Transporation people to work with us all year on parking permits, and we have stood strong throughout the year on re-evaluating the whole new system. The ultimate decision is up to President Destler, who refuses to even look back at the system on what can be fixed.   Work with Mental Health Services to implement mental health workshops for students. Expand the Student Health Center hours and availability.   Ashley and Tyler set up Active Minds, a new club that advocates for mental health on campus, early this Fall Semester with the help of the students who currently run it and our Finance director Bridget. We've also made huge strides in improving mental health- my SG town hall on mental health issues caused our Student Affairs division to bring in a huge consultant to RIT and give advice on how to improve the situation at RIT- now it's up to SG to follow-up next year and over the summer.    Show how our budget is being distributed throughout the year to groups by putting that financial information online.   We have opened up the transparency of SG Finances a lot- now we need to work on actually finding out where the Student Activity Fees go. Student Affairs has not released any of that information to us, I assume we used to know it but over the years SG administrations got careless and lost access or had that power taken from them, and we have been fighting tooth and nail to get that info back.    Create an SG Newsletter that includes the information from Senate along with any events that Student Government is participating in for that week. The newsletter will be posted on our facebook page so that anyone who likes the page will view the newsletter in their feed.   This happened for a little, but was not really popular and kind of died off after PawPrints surpassed our SG facebook page in views and users.    Create a system similar to that of We The People (Whitehouse.gov) where students can post issues on our website, and if it gets enough up votes, then the administration will have to address them.   PawPrints. Massive success.    Work with RLI to advertise and improve the consulting program for clubs. Through our consulting program we will figure out ways to improve recruitment issues or retention problems.   Our former SG Clubs/Orgs director left half way through the year, but since I've stepped up I've seen a huge initiative from Clubs @ RIT for just this exactly. We have club hour, All clubs meeting, etc.  What it comes down to is that our SG has done miles above what previous administrations have done (all the above plus a TON more), and the person who originally posted this should feel free to come stop by and Ashley and Tyler will be happy to chat over a cup of coffee on what we've done this year."
rit,32ouy7,cyanwinters,3,Wed Apr 15 17:18:52 2015 UTC,"This is awesome to read and see, thanks so much Nick. This was the kind of info I was hoping to see from my post and you certainly delivered."
rit,32ouy7,sgweb,0,Wed Apr 15 18:39:33 2015 UTC,"No problem. Please feel free to stop by, and also let me know what SG can do next year to market this info better!"
rit,32ouy7,cyanwinters,7,Wed Apr 15 18:41:27 2015 UTC,"I'm not really interested in stopping by as I am graduating and I feel a well and objectively articulated post regarding their progress from a third party - perhaps someone else in the Administration - would be excellent to see.   I am thankful for the info you posted but I do see a bit of a subjective light on it - that's totally fine. It's your job, especially as a running candidate to post and compose in the manner that you do.   Personally, Reddit is where I come for news on all things RIT. I've blocked message center except for a small variety of information because it is ineffective and far too voluminous in email sending to be of use to me. I would love to see weekly or monthly posts highlighting what our SG higher figures are doing, up to, or even being challenged by with faculty and the administration. I for one would feel far more at ease with the people I'm voting for if I could see some more transparency other than a little progress and a lot of ""trust me, we tried"".   Pawprints is excellent when the BS is filtered from it, and I love how you handle updates and responses, Nick. It's truly a great approach and every time I see an update, I feel informed and it's reassuring to see that something is being done. If there is a single focus I'd like to suggest, I'd suggest doing this but in a campus wide focus. If  our Pres and Vice made the same kinds of posts, especially here or on some other medium (entirely open to the finer details) that I can go to just for updates and not get swarmed with generally noisy info, I would say that I would be very satisfied overall."
rit,32ouy7,Ebscer,1 point,Wed Apr 15 18:49:33 2015 UTC,"Thank you. I mean, we came into this year knowing that SG has been useless in a lot of regards in the past. Honestly, it just comes down to the fact that we have had Ashley and Tyler's leadership to steer SG into an organization that actively seeks change, instead of making a lot of noise.   I'll make sure we can open up info on what we've done so people can be clued in a little more on what we're working on (if I'm elected next year)."
rit,32ouy7,itsnickk,1 point,Wed Apr 15 18:52:31 2015 UTC,Good to hear that you still accepted the challenge.   We'll certainly see how this election goes.
rit,32ouy7,jpat161,5,Wed Apr 15 19:02:52 2015 UTC,"In SG's housing committee, we are currently working with Housing Operations to create exactly this- I call it our ""cooperative development plan"" which details the future of student housing plans, as well as renovations, demolitions, etc.   So what are the chances of it being done in the last month and a half of the current administration's term? Doesn't sound done to me.   This has been a key issue every time we go to speak with Auxiliary Services, and has not been left out of any conversation. We've most certainaly advocated not only for better conditions in Riverknoll, but for a replacement for Riverknoll that is student budget friendly. We've heard that they expect to start building in 3 years (as they always say), so we're really working on making sure we have check-ups periodically throughout different SG administrations- and Ashley put in a new positions of Director of Operations for just that reason.   Doesn't really sound like SG has done anything impactful here, outside of constantly asking the same question and being stonewalled. I've been a part of the campus community since 2007 and literally every year since then we've heard pie in the sky tales of what is going to happen to Riverknoll and it's space.    This was charged through to our Deaf Advocacy committee- it was really being planned for Spring Semester, but a member of SG left and they had all of the info and vision for it, so the plans are being pushed back to next year.   TLDR - Nope, current SG administration didn't get this done.   This has been looked into thoroughly during Fall Semester, and it comes down to a hiring/budget problem within Access Services, not something that SG can directly help, but something that we still advocate for highly. Deaf Advocacy committee was once again created for issues such as these.   At least you pretty much admit SG has no power here. Probably shouldn't have been a goal in the first place?   Ashley and Tyler have sat down and spoken with the President of NTID on many occasions, and this is just one of the goals that they have brought up and checked up on.   Have this conversations accomplished anything? It's great that they are talking - but based on the way you addressed this, it pretty much sounds like absolutely no progress has been made.   SG is about to launch our own Teacher Evaluation site, due to the fact that we hit heavy resistance from faculty and admins on getting the current SmartEvals data. I just saw the site the other day, it looks great. Ashley and Tyler have been attending meetings all week on the thing.   RIT has previously had a home-grown site for teacher evaluations just like RateMyProfessors during my undergrad. It only lasted a year or two before being shuttered. What makes this different/will it actually last?  I'll give you credit, you are ready to be a White House spokesperson with the amount of spin and political jargon you can throw out there to answer some of these. There are certainly some legitimate accomplishments to tout, but not nearly what is being suggested here."
rit,32ouy7,sidewinder12s,5,Wed Apr 15 17:49:04 2015 UTC,"The value proposition of the current evaluation system simply doesn't sense for students. The service has functionality to allows evaluation data to be made public, but RIT has not enabled it. As a student, one of the most fundamental decisions we make each term is going through enrollment. We deserve to have access to quality information to make critical decisions regarding our academic paths.  What makes our system fundamentally different from RateMyProfessors? Well, our system will only let you submit data if you've actually taken the course. There is no level of accountability to the data on RateMyProfessors. So, how can you honestly trust it as a reputable source of information?  What makes our system fundamentally different from SmartEvals? Transparency. After submitting 2 evaluations through our site, you will have access to all review data in the system. You will own your enrollment decisions by using data to drive decision making. Also, our slick interface works well cross-platform, so feel free to write your review on your phone, tablet, or desktop device.  Here's a screenshot of how an example instructor page would look."
rit,32ouy7,itsnickk,2,Wed Apr 15 18:33:17 2015 UTC,"That's cool, it looks a lot like the former system. I wish I remember what it was called, but it was literally only around for like a single year. It has the word Tiger in is..but so does everything else around here, so that doesn't help.  I'm not sure what happened to the old system, I think it ended up getting controversial."
rit,32ouy7,laserBlade,1 point,Wed Apr 15 19:02:33 2015 UTC,The system you are talking about was made by some student and was never official.

But it's true, students will mis-attribute our efforts if they don't hear about it. But I post pretty frequently on reddit, we always have FB status updates on what we're doing, PawPrints is frequently updated, we send out Message Center emails, and we've even done large events and marketing campaigns on campus all year.   If I'm elected SG Pres. on Friday, I'll make sure that our PR is improved on campus. It's definitely an area we can improve upon, and your input would help on how you'd like to get updates from us!"
rit,32ouy7,KLDzzz,3,Wed Apr 15 17:59:15 2015 UTC,"every single thing we does will still help   Not if nobody can take advantage of them, which is what I was getting at   I post frequently on reddit   and the RIT subreddit gets mostly drowned out by more active subs for me and probably others, so a lot of updates might get missed   Message Center   I'm pretty sure 99% of the students are tired of Message Center emails, because of their tendency to use giant images, poor fonts, and misinformation (the number of oops-emails I've gotten this year is annoying). They also tend to be poorly targeted - RIT has information about where I live, I'm not a commuter student so I don't give a shit about things that are specific for commuter students. (Example, just the first one I can think of. I think that one happened last year? Similar things all the time though)   If I'm elected SG Pres. on Friday, I'll make sure that our PR is improved on campus.   At the risk of sounding confrontational, isn't that currently your job as director of student relations?  FB is alright if you remember to follow it (and don't have friends who drown it out...that one's not because of you, they're just annoying friends), but I feel like PawPrints was the most useful system that you mentioned - it makes a record of the things that RIT students request, as well as which ones are most important to them, and allows opt-in feedback on issues that you care about the most."
rit,32ouy7,Joseph_S,1 point,Wed Apr 15 18:08:34 2015 UTC,"Ahh I see, yeah you're totally correct in that aspect.  And I completely understand about the reddit and message center gripes, but we can't do anything about that besides continue to post and send emails.  Also- My job only pertains to PawPrints updates as far as PR outreach*- our Director of PR is the one in charge of PR improving on campus. But your mention of PawPrints being usefull is good- we'll focus on that next year. If anyone has any other ideas on better outreach, let me know anytime!"
rit,32ouy7,Joseph_S,8,Wed Apr 15 18:21:45 2015 UTC,"Nick helped me out as a student. My co-op was not counting and I was about to be kicked out of my Colony housing 3 weeks after school had started. Nonetheless I was pretty scared and posted on reddit about it asking for help because I didn't know what to do.  He messaged me and basically got me in touch with the  OMBUDS office and helped me get the whole thing sorted out.   I haven't watched what he's done lately, but he definitely seems like a good guy in my book."

rit,32ouy7,itsnickk,6,Thu Apr 16 20:21:11 2015 UTC,"Out of curiosity, as an incoming freshman, what has the school put you through? Ive heard some negative sentiment a few times here but noting very specific. Can you clarify?"
rit,32ouy7,MillerRoad,14,Wed Apr 15 15:18:07 2015 UTC,"The biggest gripe I have is fairly common: +/- Grading System and Semesters.   Yes, I was aware of the impending change of semesters when I applied here so I won't speak about it too deeply. The biggest issue I have with it is how I learned the school handled it, much like the newer no smoking policies, in regards to what the student body wanted. Very much a conflict of interest.  I'm very peeved about +/- on a University level due to the consistent inconsistency on how the school presented it would be rolled out and when. This changed several times and then all of a sudden, shortly after the brand new semester system rolled out, so did +/-, potentially serving as a GPA depressor, especially after the drastic term change.   Additionally, the semester transition was an utter nightmare. NOBODY in the administration handled that one well, especially after the long time they supposedly spent preparing.   I've had some gripes with how my college and department handle professors, new professors and letting old ones stay around but you can PM me about that if you really desire, its very specific to my program, which I'm willing to bet money you won't be in.  Additionally, all of the recent push towards making this school more akin to a state school or athletics university. Stop pretending we are, will be or even might become an athletics university and stop spending a shit load of money on it too. All new locker rooms for varsity sports and under the table financial aid adjustments to some of our athletes? You gotta be kidding me.   Contrary to most people, I loved freshman year, the dorms, Gracies and all of that fun stuff. So I'm not a total debbie downer, and don't get me wrong, if I had the choice to go to a different university when I had my choice 4 years ago, I'd totally pick RIT again, 10/10. Now, maybe not so much. Just make sure that this school has exactly what you want and that you're willing to work your ass off to get the most from RIT and then go on to the real world."
rit,32ouy7,cralor,4,Wed Apr 15 15:27:24 2015 UTC,"So it seems as if the majority of the gripes are about things that were handled poorly, but theoretically shouldn't effect me as they have already passed (except the athletics part)?  Im going into CS, and what draws me to RIT is the atmosphere of creativity and like-minded smart people working on cool projects together. What I'm hoping is that that will be the prevailing atmosphere, as opposed to shitty administration, etc. What would you say your experience has been, over all?"
rit,32ouy7,minimuffins,9,Wed Apr 15 15:38:49 2015 UTC,"RIT is still an excellent university for CS and I have a lot of friends that are finishing out the program or are alumni who are working in excellent places. I'd still definitely make RIT a priority for CS and this is certainly a prevailing atmosphere still, I'd say."

rit,32ouy7,ht5k,5,Fri Apr 17 02:48:30 2015 UTC,"So +/- grading actually reared it's menacing head during my year in SG in 2009, and you better believe we fought hard and fast against it.  We had meetings with the university board, institute council, went to petition the staff council meetings, and did our best to be as loud and upfront with the students as possible. An uninformed citizenship was a very dangerous thing.  In the end, it's not something that ever effected our SG team. But it's something we fought hard for regardless, because the future for your class and all the classes after them were at stake. Sadly the staff and faculty outvoted students 2-1. So the plan moved forward, with a few ominous warnings from the student electorate.   Just figured I'd let you know that there have been SG's in the past who have really fought for students and gotten a lot of things done. We actually published a book of successful accomplishments and new programs we started that year.  I can only hope they're still running."
rit,32ouy7,itsnickk,5,Wed Apr 15 16:19:01 2015 UTC,"That's awesome to hear, and sad to hear at the same time.   Kudos to your hard work and cavalier efforts but Im sorry to hear it ended much like the semester fight."
rit,32ouy7,nathancastle,1 point,Wed Apr 15 16:20:57 2015 UTC,"We have been against the +/- change all this year too in SG, but the years between us really dropped the issue and by the time it came to our year it was too late.   I'm sure you don't have to be told of how important going to all the joint task force meetings are on this issue, and I can assure you SG has done all that and more this year as well."
rit,32ouy7,white-forest,3,Wed Apr 15 17:23:40 2015 UTC,"Well after that first year, it became an inevitability. There was too much outside pressure from ratings and internal pressure from faculty to change the system. Students were just one small voice in a larger mix.   And for everyone who says ""Students should get a larger say in what happens!"" believe me they do. We get our way a lot of the time, we get seats at the same table, and our votes count for just as much as staff and faculty. This was just one battle we didn't win among many we did win."
rit,32ouy7,white-forest,-1,Wed Apr 15 18:02:02 2015 UTC,"People just love to attack SG without even bothering to educate themselves on the matter beforehand.  On the other hand, stop by the office if you're back! You would be super impressed at everything, I'd love to chat!"
rit,32ouy7,sidewinder12s,2,Wed Apr 15 18:05:20 2015 UTC,"All new locker rooms for varsity sports and under the table financial aid adjustments to some of our athletes? You gotta be kidding me.   Lolz. They got 2 new locker rooms, that weren't new, they were passed down when the hockey team moved. Why? Because they needed more rooms. The way it was, teams had to share rooms, and didn't get rooms for the full practice seasons. A college athletic team without a locker room? Come on.  In addition, the new locker room wing had coaches offices, since some of the coaches were sharing an office with 4 other coaches. Hows a team supposed to meet with a coach when 4 other teams are doing the same thing?  Under the table financial aid adjustments? Have you read the binders upon binders of NCAA compliance rules? There are so many rules, we have one guy whose only job is to make sure we follow them. You have literally no source for this except maybe a friend or a friend of a friend. Simply put, they can't offer money for being an athlete, besides a meal allowance when traveling, and feeding them during preseason and break week practices.  Anything ""under the table"" is probably the athlete going to the FA office, just like any student could, and asking for more money. Your accusation is baseless and stupid."
rit,32ouy7,white-forest,4,Wed Apr 15 21:58:28 2015 UTC,"I worked with Tyler and Ashley to have ROTC cadets at RIT register a day earlier than their respective classmates, just like Varsity athletes and Honors students. I prepared and presented my case to the Student Government, and worked with the Registrar and Provost to make it happen. They were an immense help, and all it took was my own initiative."

rit,32ouy7,white-forest,5,Thu Apr 16 04:05:31 2015 UTC,"To each their own, I guess.    I feel like students expect far too much out of their colleges. In my opinion, you pay to go to colleges for exactly two things: professors teaching you things and the shiny piece of paper at the end.  Everything else is icing. Your tuition dollars empower a university to act on what it feels is best for you, not what you feel is best for yourself.  I duly paid my activities fee even though I went to exactly two CAB events my entire time there and the club I was in has been financially self sufficient for almost the last decade.  I paid my student health fee even though I preferred to go to an outside physician.  What you don't find useful someone else may.  SG is still, at its core, an advocacy group.  It has no true power; only an amplified voice due to the body it represents.  While it is great what they've been able to accomplish with only that, one should not expect miracles."

I know some people prefer to physically write everything down. Other people don't take any notes at all. It's really a personal preference.   At the very least, I'd say you should have some method of jotting down something (either paper/pen or computer/tablet/phone) for anything you really don't want to forget, like due dates."

Personally, for beginning CS classes and CS 243 (Mechanics of Programming) I took all my notes on my laptop. For other classes (CS Theory being a prime example), I find it significantly easier to handwrite notes due to their nature (abstract concepts, diagrams, etc).  If you have a laptop with a touchscreen or a laptop that can be converted to a tablet where you can use software such as OneNote to type as well as write/draw with a stylus, that should be sufficient for nearly all classes (with the exception being professors who don't allow laptops without special permission).

In terms of student life and happiness,  the vast majority of people I talk to,  including myself,  are very satisfied here. I think it is fair to say those who have issues are the loud minority as you suggest.   I'd say RIT has the advantage in regards to on campus living options,  especially in terms of dorms. The ones I saw at WPI were pretty dreadful. I'd give Rochester the advantage over Worcester in terms of locale as well. (though being close to Boston is nice)   The 7 week terms at WPI did seem intense,  similar to the 10 week quarters we had before switching to semesters last year. Overall semesters definitely give some more breathing room but slacking off is not an option either way.   Hopefully someone in your program itself can give you some more information on that but if you have any other questions I'd be happy to help."

As for graduate opportunities, those who are looking often have no trouble getting into their desired program, as the ChemE department is very strong in the undergrad academic research area. We also have a new graduate program! There also is no lack of job opportunities. (I know 1 student who did not obtain a co-op our first block.) People don't have much trouble with finding full time employment either.   I'm not sure of retention and graduation rates, but the first class only consisted of 18 students in the beginning and all graduated as ChemE's. I believe my class started with about 55 students and we currently have about 48, and we have had people transfer into the program as well.  Our alumni network is small, but our local professional network is huge. We have a very active student AIChE chapter (American Institute of Chemical Engineers) which ties us to the professional community. We have a lot of connections in various fields that you can draw on as a ChemE at RIT.

The transition happened two years ago and could have been smoother (many believe it never should have happened). Many older students are still sour. I was not a fan of the conversion myself.

I was also trying to choose between WPI and RIT at the end of my search, and I ultimately chose RIT for a few reasons:  1) It ended up being significantly less expensive.   2) RIT had a Computer Engineering program, rather than just having a concentration within Electrical Engineering (not relevant to you.)   3) RIT has a very strong co-op program with excellent corporate connections. While WPI also has very good job placement, I think that is based solely on being an engineering school, which RIT is as well.   And again, for whatever reason, this subreddit is super angry all the time. I'm not entirely sure why. Probably because it's really easy to whine online.

Here at RIT, 5 year programs are not uncommon, and it's not unheard of for students to stay a semester or two longer if they have to retake classes. There are also a good number of students who stick around and get their masters right away before entering the workforce.

Be aware that taking three lab courses concurrently is a LOT of work, especially the ones you have listed.

Freshmen (and any other upperclassmen living on campus) are not allowed to park in the academic lots near classes. It's a 10-15 minute walk from one side of campus to the other, so this should not be an issue. The freshman parking lots are a decent hike from the dorms, but not as far as the academic buildings."

rit,32ll4i,GCCISAlum,1 point,Tue Apr 14 20:43:24 2015 UTC,"You are correct that there are many classifications of outdoor fires. The OP asked about going into the woods, which to me means grabbing some downed limbs and finding an ""open"" area to burn said limbs (aka, brush).   The biggest thing to keep in mind is any embers have the potential to start a brush fire due to the dry post-winter conditions. Odds are even if you're following the letter of the law, some Sally Do Right/Cellphone Hero will call 911 and you'll get a visit from the local FD or police agency."

It’s not always easy, that is why it is called a ""comfort zone.""  Many students similar to yourself have benefitted from one of the Counseling Center’s Social Anxiety Groups.  Yes, it can be difficult at first to imagine yourself in a group of other students, but students consistently report that what they like about the Center’s group program is the tremendous understanding, support, and encouragement they receive from others facing similar issues.  A new Social Anxiety Group is just beginning.  Don’t have time now?  Then perhaps consider contacting the Counseling Center if you are going to be here for summer or when you return in the fall.  Something to consider if you would like to learn how other students have successfully overcome their anxiety and nervousness in social situations."

The rooms available are in a house located behind the University Commons apartments on campus in a neighborhood known as Oak Mills. There are 3 rooms available for rent currently, with other rooms that may be available based on location of co-op students.   The first room is shown in the images above. Furniture is also available for an additional cost (like I said we are moving out of state and can't take our furniture with us). All available rooms share a Jack and Jill style bathroom with only one other room. Both bathrooms have two sinks and a stand-up shower already equipped with a liner, shower curtain, hooks, and a garbage can so no need to purchase any of that.   The rest of the house is already furnished including kitchen appliances, living room and kitchen furniture, dishes, etc. You may need a few pots and pans, but not much. There is a laundry room with a washer and dryer, a garage, back patio and fire pit, driveway, and bar.   Rent is $380/month/person if 5 people are living in the house. Cable, utilities, and internet not included in rent.  Send me a message if interested and you would like more information!"

With that being said a lot of dual degree students exist here at RIT.  For most majors an immersion is required which makes you choose 3 courses out of a chosen sequence.  By only taking a few more courses a lot of these immersions can be ""upgraded"" to minors.  Most programs do not have students scheduled for 18 credit semesters so there is extra room there and with the general 2 free electives. If you come in with credit and can get a couple gen eds and lower level courses out of the way you might be able to have enough room for a major.  In my expierence ""double dipping"" courses happens a lot between different schools and is the reason I can dual major."
rit,32by4o,CaptainConsent,4,Sun Apr 12 14:10:09 2015 UTC,"Only a small fraction of the students that ""say"" or ""plan"" on double-majoring will end up doing so - they will either take an additional co-op, graduate early, or were simply over-ambitious to start with.  Like you said, most of them probably haven't realize how different RIT is from high school. With enough transfer credits, careful planning and execution, and finally luck, it's certainly possible to graduate on time whilst double majoring, but it's certainly not frequent that students have all the pieces together."

If you search here on the RIT reddit almost every single recommended course no longer exists. I was pretty frustrated to learn that they pretty much offer zero electives that are not part of ""of the world"" series. Not to mention my adviser basically knew nothing about stuff outside my major."
rit,324ldy,layer4andbelow,1 point,Fri Apr 10 16:28:43 2015 UTC,"I feel the pain. When the semester switch happened, my major lost about 1/3 of our classes because we're understaffed. Sometimes they were cut, sometimes they were combined, but it's been a LOT of substitution forms and anger.  That being said, Ceramics is a fun time. It says it's a studio class, but I'd check with someone who knows. I learned a lot and had tons of fun."
rit,324ldy,eka5245,1 point,Fri Apr 10 17:02:17 2015 UTC,"I graduated last year, so I'm not sure what's still be offered, but the ones I took that I really enjoyed included:  Zoo & Bot Illustration: If this class is being offered, definitely take it! They bring live owls and falcons to class, and there's usually a field trip to the botanical gardens.   Glass: I took the flameworking, wax room option, so I didn't get to do what most people usually think of when it comes to glass blowing. But my grad-student teachers were amazing and very chill - everyone in the glass world has a very exceptional personality and loves to share their craft. Also you get to make some really cool shit.  Calligraphy: When I took it, it was only offered as a 2-credit class, but I believe there was talk of switching it over to a 4-credit. Anyways, it was a very work intensive class compared to my other studio electives, but Lorrie was really passionate about her work and about unveiling the secrets of awesome calligraphy. If you take this class, I guarantee, you will get to make some really classy looking handwritten things as last minute gifts.  I also took ceramics and metalworking - While I did get to make some pretty creative things, at the time, these classes seemed to be a lot less hands on than my other classes. What I mean is that it seemed like there was a lot less we were allowed to do ourselves when taking the class (mixing glazes, doing chemical etching, making bronze molds, etc.) Comparitively, we pretty much got to do everything the glass majors did in that class except for place our stuff in the kilns. Even in the wet shop (where we polished our glass pieces), they showed us how to use all the machinery and then set us free."

The last 3 years I have used Scottsville Mini Storage for a 10'x10' locker that cost me $81 a month (for 3 months) which comes out to under $250. Now factor in that most people will only need the 5'x10' unit or you could share the bigger one with 2 or 3 people it brings the cost down even further. Just look around a bit.. RIT does not want to be responsible for our stuff and they have no need for more storage.
rit,321h3t,majorchangethrowaway,5,Thu Apr 9 20:35:55 2015 UTC,"I spent 2 years in GDD, switched over to SE, and after 2 years in SE I can safely say that was one of the best decisions I've made in my life.  If you want marketable programming skills, SE is where you want to be. The entire major is focused from the start on group projects and practical, relevant, modern software engineering practices. Group projects are designed to teach you what working in the field is like, ending in a senior project where you work with an actual company to produce a deliverable product. The skills you learn in SE will take you anywhere you want to go.  As somebody who spent 2 years in the GDD program, I would suggest you avoid it altogether. They're going to make you take a bunch of courses on actual game design, which is a total waste of your time if you're just in it for the programming. Furthermore, the projects they have you do lack the organization and practicality of SE projects, and they just flat out don't teach the higher level programming concepts and project management stuff that SE does.   Then there's the industry itself. Game design is one of, if not the most competitive technical field out there right now. It's hard to land a job at a game design company, and if you do, you're not going to get paid as much as your skills are worth. There's also the very real threat of terrible hours that you aren't compensated for, which ultimately ends in you being let go before the company has to pay you benefits for being a full time employee. I would avoid the game design industry like the god damn plague.  Seriously, read some of the comments in this thread. I suggest anyone else considering a job in game design do the same thing. I get the feeling I'm going to get some shit for this post, but I think it's worth it to make sure you understand what you're getting yourself into, because in my experience, most GDD students have no idea what they're walking into."

That doesn't dissuade me (though easier said than done). Admittedly, I'd like to learn about more than programming when it comes to game development, since I enjoy drawing and modeling. But I also want to know more practical project management things too, and I can sort of tell there isn't that much in the classes from what I've taken.  It's starting to sound like SE might be more of what I would want, and I am enjoying my SWEN 261 class this semester."

If you'll indulge me a little more, I firmly believe that any aspiring programmer at RIT should take SWEN 250 and SWEN 262. I'm sure by now you're very familiar with version control and testing, so 250 isn't as important. SWEN 262 is all about Software subsystems, design patterns, and the thought processes behind implementing them. For me, it was the first step into that higher level, ""this is what it will be like in the real world"" way of thinking about programming, and understanding that really made a difference when I talked to employers at the career fair."
rit,321h3t,SlashStar,6,Tue Apr 14 21:41:26 2015 UTC,Do you actually want a job in the games industry? I am in GDD and my first co-op was in general CS for a regular business. I was making $25 an hour. Now at my second co-op at an actual game studio I am making half that. I don't mind because I love the work but is it worth it to you? Additionally it will become harder to find non-gaming programming jobs in the future. At career fairs I have seen several potential employers instantly lose interest in me when they read my major.  That said RIT is a very well respected school among employers and you will probably be able to find a job in either industry with either major as long as you work hard at your job search.

Employers outside of the game industry have no desire for you. They vastly prefer SE and CS students. Employers in the industry don't care about your degree, they would much rather see a killer portfolio.   In my opinion CS gives a much broader education, and will allow you to do game design, as well as more standard programming job opportunities. Switching into GDD will help you get a job making games, but not anything else."
rit,321h3t,kocsenc,1 point,Fri Apr 10 03:27:54 2015 UTC,"It feels like sticking with CS would be the wiser move overall, and if I wanted to go into the game industry I could try building a relevant portfolio instead of changing majors.

rit,321h3t,wolfmanpraxis,2,Tue Apr 14 19:44:12 2015 UTC,It seems SE is the way you want to go. You want a marketable degree and working in teams (during school). That's exactly what SE is.

rit,322bs5,362788,1 point,Fri Apr 10 03:48:05 2015 UTC,"I've never seen any get towed in the 6 years I was at RIT. And as far as tickets go they are given out by RIT not the police. It is more of a fine than anything, it doesn't go on your driving record. That being said if you register your car with RIT to get a parking pass they will add the fine if it goes unpaid to your quarterly bill. Since I'm almost 100% sure your family doesn't register their vehicles with RIT they don't really have to worry about it. RIT doesn't know who to send a bill to and has no record of it other than car X with XXXXXXX license plate was given a ticket. Your parents won't be getting a bill in the mail or anything. And they won't be turned into the cops for not paying. Parking in handicap spot though can get you a real ticket should someone at RIT call the real police to come ticket you. Also don't block RIT Ambulance in their base.   I knew other students that would never get a parking pass and just through out the tickets they got. RIT had no way to know it was their car and couldn't bill them. This is a dickish thing to do but nothing is stopping you besides your good morals.  TL;DR - Visitor's don't really have to worry about getting tickets since RIT has no way to know who owns the car. But you shouldn't be a dick and definitely don't park in handicap parking."

That's close to $200 for just the products and parts alone.    As for trench coat guy eating pavement, I saw a guy run at a full sprint into one of the doors at building 70 because he was being chased and turned to look back without slowing down.

rit,320iql,pixelSHREDDER,0,Thu Apr 9 20:31:43 2015 UTC,"Dude. DUDE. I played HvZ in Fall 09 too, and I can tell you right now the rest of the week was WAY more epic than you think.  First of all, I played as a human and made it to extraction. Starting around Wednesday, we surviving humans had coalesced around a core group including some freshmen, a former mod, some other equally-way-too-into-this kids, and myself (then a fresh transfer student commuting from the RIT Inn), which met up in Gleason to strategize for missions. I must've gotten a hundred phone numbers from random people as we strategized and tried to coordinate battle plans with the various militias, squads, and teams on the ground (RIP Soul Squad). It was awesome. We actually had some success too; iirc we completed Wednesday and Thursday's missions with a low number of casualties.  On Friday, we made it to extraction. Our mission was to make it across the 70's buildings and get to a field where I'm pretty sure one of the newer buildings now stands. As for campo breaking things up.... you're partially right. Campo DID intervene after some students took the game indoors and near the exits, which the rules specifically banned.  So it went down like this: Campo rounded up all the humans and all the zombies separately. We were each lectured about the rules and told that if we followed them, play could continue. At this time the humans were I believe at Building 71, just a stone's throw away from extraction.... across a wide open field.  So we marched as a giant mass of humanity across the field, when suddenly the ENTIRE ZOMBIE HOARD came out and surrounded us. We tried our best to establish a moving perimeter - we positioned ""grenadiers"" (kids with backpacks full of socks) in the center, and had our guns along the outside, as we slowly lumbered towards the finish line.  Suddenly, some of the zombies broke through and started tagging, our formation fell apart, and literally wave after wave of zombie arms came swiping at us. It became a mad dash to the extraction point, and a good number of us made it safely.... but sadly, I wasn't among them. When the zombie rush began I mowed down the first wave, still trying to maintain formation, but the second wave came immediately after and got to me. I still ran to the extraction point and cheered with everyone else because I was having so much damn fun, but I made sure to find a mod afterwards and hand in my tag. I ain't no cheater.  I remember hearing someone talk about that game once, a few years later. They said ""some guy and his girlfriend showed up on Tuesday"" and led the humans through the missions and to ""a clusterfuck extraction"", and that it was the most fun they'd ever had playing HvZ. I thought to myself, ""Eh, close enough."""
rit,320iql,Ecchii,2,Thu Apr 9 19:24:30 2015 UTC,"Do you remember how many people ended up making it? The only time I was a part of the ridiculous coordination was when I went out as a zombie the night of the first event. A lot of the zombies gathered at the field house (close to 100) and another large group got together someone on academic while we waited for news on what the target would be. Once we heard we broke up by groups and then further into subgroups and everyone was shouting and calling out to other packs of zombies to coordinate. That's how I got my only tag, another group chased some humans into the back of 76 and we caught a group coming out of the front. Enough of us swarmed them that we caught all but two before they could make it back to within the door safety zone."
rit,320f2d,KiraQueen,15,Thu Apr 9 16:05:49 2015 UTC,"SE alum here.  The ostensible difference is that CS focuses more on theory and SE more n engineering:  SE   Software process (the human procedures you go through to organize a project consisting of many people over weeks/months/years) Version control Software testing Subsystem design and software architecture (how to organize the code for a piece of software so that it’s maintainable, readable, and still works well) User experience design (making a software interface easy to use)   CS   Software algorithms The mathematical theory around programming Programing operating systems   Both will teach you how to code.  Both will prepare you for being a professional developer.  One other difference that was the case when I was there, though, was that SE had a lot more group work on semester*, whereas CS was a lot more individual labs and tests.  This is a double edged sword.  On one hand, group work makes it easier for slackers to succeed.  Everyone has a few stories of a group where two out of five people had to do the whole thing.  On the other hand, group work prepares you a lot more for the real world of software development.  Further, working on projects prepares you a lot more for what it’s like building actual software.  If you’re the person on the group that works hard, you’ll get a lot out of it.  One data point is how it worked out for me.  I graduated with an SE degree and went to work in San Francisco.  I’ve worked at a few startups and I’ve definitely used most of the things I learned in SE.  The software process stuff I haven’t used a whole lot, though, since it was more aimed at “how to build software at really big companies building huge pieces of software”.  I do wish I had a bit more of the CS theory and fundamentals, though.  If I were to do it over again, I’d probably take either CS or SE, but then put all my electives into the other program.  CS with a  minor in SE, or vice versa.  *quarters at that time"
rit,320f2d,FishToaster,8,Thu Apr 9 16:37:55 2015 UTC,"So Software Engineering is going to be more job oriented in terms of their curriculum. When you get hired as a Software Engineer they expect you to know the Engineering side of Software Development not just how to code. You will learn how to properly organize code and different design patterns the industry uses. I'm a Computer Engineer so i only took SE361 (software engineering 1)  but that's the gist of it. Higher level Computer Science courses will focus on computational programming or theoretical applications. You probably won't be bothered with designing fancy GUIs and you may not learn too much about the business / engineering side of programming. You may however learn more about the fundamental basics of computers and how they work.   If you want to be a developer for a software company, go into Software Engineering. If you want help with research in AI or other theoretical applications you're better off with Computer Science. But obviously there is a lot of crossover."

As for jobs and co-ops: both majors funnel students and graduates to exactly the same positions. Either choice will lead ultimately to the same outcome, you just take a different road to get there.

rit,320f2d,dxk3355,1 point,Thu Apr 9 18:06:06 2015 UTC,SE alumni with CS and CE minors.  my CS operating system course was reinventing bash shell functions in a c program.  My software engineering class was designing class files or test plans.    In my job of 6 years they want people that can engineer more than they want devs since they can be more adaptable to the business needs.
rit,320f2d,lone_gravy,2,Thu Apr 9 20:20:29 2015 UTC,"I'm a software engineer and I absolutely love my major. Sure, there are classes here and there that aren't great (looking at you, SWEN-440) but in any major there will be classes that aren't anyone's favorite. I really did not enjoy my time in the CS sequence and have little interest in most of the CS material.  The thing to remember are the differences between the two, because some people prefer one or the other. Software engineering is an engineering degree which focuses on managing a project and the design of the product, not necessarily the actual building of said product. SE also requires a lot of social interaction with people of varying technical abilities (from 0 to dangerous), and not everyone is well suited for that. You can get into the field as a software engineer and never touch code again if that's your wish, but you will deal with people all the time.  CS (and I can't speak for it nearly as much as I'm not CS) is more individual and theory work. CS from my understanding is more deep level design of algorithms and code and know more of what goes on ""under the hood"" so to speak. That's not to say that SE doesn't get into this, it's just that SE is less about that side of things.  If you enjoy academia, there are research opportunities in both majors, I spent 2 years in a research position in the SE department."
rit,320f2d,Furtwangler,1 point,Thu Apr 9 23:39:39 2015 UTC,"On the other hand, I'm currently in SWEN-261 since it's a graduation requirement, and it's by far my least favorite class I've taken in my entire undergraduate career. My group members can't code their way out of a Fizzbuzz test, and I'm basically stuck doing most of the project on my own. The course lectures and exams are all about memorizing buzzwords. On the other hand, my CS classes haven't been easy,  but I've enjoyed every one of them. I have nothing nice to say about a 200-level course that makes 50% of your grade dependent on  a  group project."
rit,320f2d,Furtwangler,2,Thu Apr 9 18:17:09 2015 UTC,"Most of your life in a decent majority of software companies will be a ""group project"" :) Sucks, but learning how to deal with incompetent people like that (not just putting the entire team on your back) is a very valuable skill to have once you graduate."
rit,320f2d,jpat161,2,Fri Apr 10 12:38:32 2015 UTC,"Copying and pasting again (we should put something in the sidebar for this :) ):  Jobs you can get will be similar. I'm biased but think that SE will prepare you to move up a bit faster because we learn a lot of project management things that managers tend to concern themselves with. CS could potentially help you harden your technical skills which is also a completely legit chain to go up depending on company.  The other really big thing is SE requires a year senior project to graduate, which in order to do requires you to complete your co-ops. This gives you a year of project experience you won't get otherwise. CS can graduate (or could anyway) by doing co-ops.  tl;dr at bottom.  Each major shares a year of intro to programming, some science and math classes. The first year of classes it'll be hard to differentiate between either major as you need to lay a groundwork in programming and assorted electives before you can continue on.   I always tell people the difference between CS and SE is similar to the differences between Physics and Mechanical Engineering. A Physicist spends a lot of their time learning about things like force formulas, and the  rules of gravity, weight etc.  A ME would take those formulas and theories and decide the best way to build a bridge - not only design it but manage the bridge project itself (time estimation, risks, etc). The two (at RIT anyway) very nicely complement each other. I'm clearly biased as I just graduated SE, but I think that both majors have their strong points.  Someone please feel free to correct me if the CS stuff isn't quite accurate as I haven't actually taken most of the courses myself.  CS courses tend to focus on the lower level mechanics of programming and specific approaches to solving a problem:    Why is this way of solving the problem better or worse than the other way?  What's the most efficient way to store data that I want to get at later? (there's many) How does this compiler work under the hood? How does the computer itself ""think""? How does a computer look at pictures? (they don't really see them like we do at first).   SE classes tend to focus on:    large scale system design (how all these smaller solved problems that a CS person is concerned with come together to solve a much larger problem),  figuring out what you're actually supposed to be building (requirements elicitation - talking to customers and people who want you to do something who may not be technical at all)  managing projects (how many people do we have to code this? How much can they code effectively in a day? How many hours is needed to complete our goal?) How do we spend the 6 month window we have to build the program? worrying about risks in a project and things that can cause your large project to fail teamwork and communication. 90% of SE courses require group based work and usually a 7-15 week long project - designed to emulate what you'd be doing in the real world.   Here's a list of a couple CS and SE classes that I think show a good split between the two:  CS Courses   CS250 - Concepts of Computer Systems - digital logic, machine instruction set level, assembly. CS 261 - Analysis of Algorithms - More study on algorithms and data structures, their complexity. Also I think a lot of practice on how to choose which one to use for certain situations etc. CS 262 - CS Theory - Automata theory, languages and grammar. The most theoretical class you can take about how a computer really works under the hood. (SE's have to take this too, but it's offered by the CS department and a good demonstration of the far theoretical end of computing that SE doesn't touch.) They also have classes on Data Mining, Computer Vision ( edge detection and color formation etc), A lower level class about how Operating Systems work (lots of threading and concurrency), Intro to Cryptography, and many more that I've missed.   SE Courses   SWEN-262 - Engineering of Software Subsystems - How do you make this huge program work? Design patterns and projects focusing on solving large-scale problems (which are comprised of smaller problems) and the trade-offs of choosing particular designs. SWEN-331 - Secure Software System Development - How do you build software that's secure? What are things to look out for during projects and development that are setting you up to fail later due to being unsecure? (ranges from the classic hacking of your program to network intrusion, to employee defection in teams) SWEN-440 - System Requirements and Architecture - How do we figure out what we're supposed to build? Electing requirements from customers and making sure those plans are very verbose, specific, and actionable. SWEN-256 - SW Process and Project Management - How do we make sure the amount of people on our team can finish the task in the amount of time we need? How to not slip deadlines and releases. How to identify risks and what to do if those bad things happen and still get the project done on time. Different ways of organizing your schedule depending on what kind of software you're building. There's also classes that go more in depth about things like process methodologies (Agile ones like SCRUM, or classic Waterfall), Usability, and most importantly, SE's have a year long final project with a usually outside sponsor (for example my team last year worked with Wegmans to make a touch screen Deli Kiosk system) that gives you the whole 9 yards of going through a software project like you would in real life.   Both CS and SE have a course targeted at Concurrent and Distributed Systems (computers talking to each other, threads etc) a communication course, and share a lot of other electives that you can look at on their respective websites.  tl;dr - CS are like scientists that do theory and exploration related things. SE are like engineers that use those principles to manage and make larger systems. Read the rest of it - you wouldn't want to pick the wrong major because you were too lazy to read! (although switching isn't that hard)"
rit,320f2d,bssameer,3,Fri Apr 10 20:18:58 2015 UTC,"Second year currently living with CS majors and I have a few SE friends I talk to almost everyday. Out of my 4 SE friends only one likes it, 2 are switching to CS and the last is just sticking with it. Of my CS roommates and friends they all seem to enjoy it and hate their SE classes. I am an engineer so I have taken my required C class but I can ask around if you  have general questions."
rit,320f2d,ApolloNeverDied,2,Thu Apr 9 19:27:49 2015 UTC,As a CS major I would recommend SE. Most CS majors graduate to become Software Engineers anyway. Why not learn what you are going to do  all your life?

rit,31vgpz,KiraQueen,3,Wed Apr 8 14:11:24 2015 UTC,To add on to this they are called expressive and receptive tests.

The remainder of the class was signing only and taught by a deaf teacher. If your lips moved, he got your attention and you had to sign it out so he could be involved. Every class also involved communication between your peers to exchange information and practice.   You learned real quick to practice daily and pay 100% attention. Online doesn't offer that ability.   I walked out of that class and felt confident practicing sign on campus. I also walked across the stage for graduation knowing only how to sign ""sorry"" and ""practice."""

rit,31xpkt,Drunken_Consent,3,Wed Apr 8 23:48:39 2015 UTC,I agree. If you make a reasonable amount of friends on your floor you'll have no shortage of things to go to. Making that social network connects you with people not in the dorms (upperclassmen) and thus parties.

The parties here are 3 guys to 1 girl crammed into a 3 br apartment, and the cops break everything up by 1am. I think the people who say the party scene is good here must have been sheltered before coming here. Yes, parties exist, but RIT is not the traditional college experience.   I don't think that's necessarily a bad thing, either. You give up four years of partying hard to be set for the future. With co-op and RIT's reputation, if you're in a major worth studying, you won't have trouble finding a job. Isn't that the point of college anyway? If you want to spend $40k/year to party, go to college in Hawaii or Florida, because if you're paying that kind of money to party, you should go to school in a place where the weather doesn't suck for eight months a year. On that note, I think half the reason why parties suck here is because nobody wants to go outside from November until about now.  Also, once you're an upperclassman (or if you get a fake ID), downtown Rochester has a lot of cool bars, and you won't want to party on campus anyway. After a certain point in your life, you get tired of seeing sheltered freshmen who never drank before college deciding to drink 10 shots and vomiting on people.  TL;DR: Stop deluding yourselves, this isn't a party school. It's a career-focused school."

I had mediocre grades and was your typical frat boy - say what you will about paying for your friends but it did help build my network. Also whenever I have internship/co-op opportunities I look to see if anyone from my chapter is interested first.  Sign up and actively use LinkedIn. Obviously add connections, skills, and recommendations but look for professional groups that support your skill set. These groups not only expand your network with like minded people but serve as an easy way for recruiters to find candidates."

Pretty entry level in the sense that it was mostly documentation work.   The subsequent co-ops were at Disney World which I got through networking with my department head and attending their on campus info session. After the first block I did a decent enough job to get an invite back, but I still networked enough to hop around functional areas."

rit,31u88d,joe714,1 point,Wed Apr 8 15:09:08 2015 UTC,"If I were you, I would email companies directly. I sent emails to 123 companies yesterday and got back from over a dozen of them. Yes, emails. I did not bother visiting a single Careers page (unless encouraged to do so in a reply). What I find most frustrating about their Careers page is that you're usually just feeding yourself to a system that will put you into a stack with all the other people who have applied. In the rare case, their system will be designed to email the appropriate person, but you have no way of really knowing. Also, keep in mind that the direction of HR changes and they usually won't update the Careers page straight away.  You can get a list of emails that are associated with companies to contact by reaching out to Career Services.  To answer your question:  For my first co-op: I found an ad in GCCIS, promptly applied, got interviewed, then hired.  For my second co-op: One of the instructors was impressed by how well I did in a course and invited me to help out with the faculty this Spring."

I think most engineering programs are 5 years, though you are not paying for 5 years since you should be on co-op for at least a year. Again this depends on department and you would have to check with the department."
rit,31s5y7,sidewinder12s,2,Wed Apr 8 02:22:16 2015 UTC,It depends on the Major. Not all programs are 4 years. For your major though it will take 5 years standard because of co-ops.  Source: I am in the CS program
rit,31s5y7,pete800,2,Tue Apr 7 19:19:35 2015 UTC,Depends on CoOp (paid internships in your field of study) requirements of the major.

Co-ops let you make money using your skills before you have a degree, which will benefit you. I know people who have gotten jobs straight off a co-op before they graduated (obviously hinging on them graduating in the long run). Co-ops for Engineers and CS SE pay pretty well."
rit,31s5y7,NewtAgain,1 point,Wed Apr 8 13:48:19 2015 UTC,"The 5 year requirement is due to having a Co-Op, which is basically a paid internship that you need to graduate. It is a huge factor in some people choosing to come to RIT because they help you a lot in setting them up and working for around 2 whole semesters(My co-op as a Mechanical Engineering undergraduate is 2 summer fall stints). A lot of students end up with jobs where they had a co-op right after graduation.   You still only study and take classes for 4 total years, and 1 year is co-ops. How it is setup depends on major and person."
rit,31s5y7,BlueReaper46,1 point,Wed Apr 8 14:32:51 2015 UTC,"Does it take five years for some majors or is it universal?   Yes, some are 5, some are 4 years.

CS requires the usual schooling PLUS:  2 full semesters (a year's worth) of co-op.  AND 1 summer semester (during a summer break) worth of co-op.  The department and curriculum is good, but forcing yourself to do co-ops is GREAT in my opinion. ""Learn by doing"" and all that.  godSpeed();"

My VP Andrea has been working all year with administration to get ZipCar on our campus- which we are working to implement next fall!  Along with that, I plan on working with the RICC (Rochester Intercollegiate Council- a delegation of SG members from Rochester-area universities) and our RIT SG to meet with members of the Rochester City Council and petition that they begin talks on re-allowing car-sharing services (such as Lyft, Uber) in Rochester because of the huge need that college students have for affordable transportation.

rit,31r0ig,burgerboy9n,5,Tue Apr 7 17:38:39 2015 UTC,Does SG collaborate with CAB?
rit,31r0ig,cl2292,2,Tue Apr 7 18:53:45 2015 UTC,"We have historically been pretty separate, besides the budget stuff.  I actually just met with CAB the other day and went over some of my goals for the relationship between SG and CAB, I really want SG to steer away from being events-based and move towards advocacy-based, and I'd love to partner up with CAB more to help with student input and events around campus."
rit,31r0ig,theekevinbacon,5,Tue Apr 7 19:10:02 2015 UTC,In my eyes CAB has lost all credibility this year. I'm a senior and only received one email regarding any of the senior events that happened this last year. Why hold events if only friends of CAB members know about it..? Events that get scheduled and sell out before anyone knows that tickets have gone on sale. Events scheduled in a venue a quarter the size that the community demands. No fall concert. Spring concert in limbo.   What can you do to help improve this?
rit,31r0ig,foward2,2,Tue Apr 7 20:28:15 2015 UTC,"In reference to the small venue issue if you're referring to comedians in Clark, I'm fairly certain that wasn't on CAB. Issues with parents complaining about comedians and putting the presidents ball in the field house on Friday probably contributed to this and was out of their control"
rit,31r0ig,sgweb,2,Tue Apr 7 21:37:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I've heard this too. No matter the reason it still sucks. We ALL payed the student activities fee which in part is used to pay for major events."
rit,31r0ig,foward2,2,Tue Apr 7 21:50:57 2015 UTC,"I understand the disappointment, but I think CAB has done the best with the resources that have been available to them this year. I do take your concerns seriously, and I have already met with CAB like I mentioned and I want to have SG be able to give these concerns to CAB, and have them give explainations back to SG and students. This is a channel that can be improved upon next year.  Let me go through your concerns, clarify and give you my opinion on the subject:   First, the fact that you did not see any marketing is a good thing to bring up to CAB. They have an entire wing dedicated to marketing, and they are not going to miss out on a target audience just because. I personally saw a lot of marketing, but I hang around the Campus Center and areas close to their office so I'm not in the same situation as you. Regardless, improving marketing is a good goal that SG and CAB can make together, and I would be willing to work with them on that if they feel the same! I think your next two points are related to one another: The Bill Cosby event was totally out of CAB's hands. They signed a contract with Cosby for a certain amount of audience members, and agents do not switch those contracts easily. Also the next largest venues were unavailable: President' Destler was not going to move the Alumni Ball from the Field House, and the Polissini Center has not been equipped with the right tech/ice covering for any sort of show. I think that Bo Burnham showed that CAB can do the large-scale comedian thing right, it's just that they got stuck with a bunch of bad factors that added up to having to make the decision they did. Contracts, in general, are really the biggest thing that can easily throw off a whole concert. These agreements are incredibly tough to negotiate, and CAB is the only ones that know how to do it. CAB doesn't really automatically get more money from Student Activity Fees- (in fact, we (SG) don't even know how the Student Activity Fees are broken up fully, and I am determined to get to the bottom of it, because we've only gotten shaky, vague answers so far.) But CAB has had to make tough decisions that may be due to financial reasons, or due to contractual reasons, and they are very willing to hear student input about it. In fact, they held 2 town halls last semester on the issue- but not one student showed up to either. I know it seems unfair but CAB really has done the best it can with the resources it has, and SG's goal should not be to interfere with CAB's operations as much as it should be to ensure that all MSOs and clubs, including CAB have the resources and communication channels they need in order to satisfy student needs on campus."
rit,31r0ig,ht5k,3,Tue Apr 7 22:26:23 2015 UTC,"Hey Nick and Andrea,  I currently a second-year in the dorms, but next year (as of right now) I am guaranteed housing but currently don't have a spot in RIT housing. I was wondering what your plans are for housing especially as the student body continues to increases annually."
rit,31r0ig,oneNickToRuleThemAll,2,Tue Apr 7 20:55:08 2015 UTC,"I believe that RIT is going to have to buckle down at one point and get another dorm. We've been told over and over that there's no need for one, but when you look at the fact that the only lounges available in the dorms are the kitchenettes, and that hundreds of students are losing the on-campus college experience while being stuck at the RIT Inn, you see a different story.  This issue is partially RIT's fault, and partially the fault of the surrounding area. Henrietta has been denying new housing complexes in the area that we need, and I think having a stronger presence at their board meetings, and a push for local elections amongst RIT students, would get the ball rolling on new living spaces close to campus.  For the rest of housing, it is my belief that Student Government needs to work directly with Housing Operations as they make decisions on new or renovated housing units. They have been very helpful this year with working with us on our ideas, but the reality is that the top administrators are the ones making the big decisions on new housing.   We need to show a unified call that more housing and security in living at RIT is needed on campus, and I would love to work with some of our MSO's such as ACE and OCASA on that issue, along with RA's and other ResLife staff."
rit,31r0ig,rrb159,3,Tue Apr 7 22:12:06 2015 UTC,"There was a PawPrints motion to allow alcohol to be served to the student body at Hockey games, what is your opinion on this?"
rit,31r0ig,cyanwinters,3,Tue Apr 7 22:00:19 2015 UTC,"I believe we need to re-look at alcohol policies on campus as a whole (and they just created a committee to do so!).   But I personally believe that would be fine. I would love to grab a beer at a hockey game, and I think it would give games a desperately-needed boost of attendance.  The concerns some may have about people getting too drunk don't really concern me too much, since those beers are going to cost an arm and a leg, and people could just as well get drunk pre-gaming and go to the game now."
rit,31r0ig,cyanwinters,3,Tue Apr 7 22:04:38 2015 UTC,"This may be a bit of an irrelevant question now, but it would satisfy my curiosity as a soon to be departing 4th year.  With the 2010 SG semester vote in mind, how would you handle a difference of personal opinion from the opinion of those you represent? Will ""personal"" ballots be released like this in the future for issues? How would you handle this situation differently... or would you?  Finally, do you feel that there is an equal balance of say between AS, SC and SG on Institute Council policies?"
rit,31r0ig,rrb159,3,Tue Apr 7 22:16:18 2015 UTC,"Assuming future administrations continue to support the PawPrints project (I know Nick would, but generically I am speaking beyond that point), it would be very difficult for any campus leader to obfuscate or otherwise misrepresent where student opinion truly lies on any topic. If leadership disagreed, the student body would objectively know so."
rit,31r0ig,rrb159,0,Wed Apr 8 01:23:41 2015 UTC,"This topic came up many, many times over the course of the year inside of SG as an example on what can go wrong when the whole organization isn't on board, or if the President decides to go against what the rest of SG voted on.  I obviously do not have all of the information that Matt Danna had, but I would not have made the decision he made due to the fact that SG and students in general clearly voted against Semesters. I'm having a little trouble interpreting this ""SG Personal Ballot"" column without context, but it seems clear to me that in general students were for quarters, and I would have represented that in Institute Council (even if it went against my personal opinion, especially since it was voted on in SG Senate).  I have found that if President Destler wants something done, he does not give a damn about the student opinion about it. The same thing happened with parking fees, and it will happen again in the future, and it's up to SG to be the one who leads the call against it.   Once again, I don't quite grasp the personal ballot concept, but I'd love to release that for future issues if you could explain it a little further.  Also, I believe that SG has been left out of a lot of IC policies- due to the fact that we have suffered a string of SG administrations that simply didn't have what it took to keep up with the meetings, and give informed, balanced opinions. This resulted in power being taken away from us, and Ashley and Tyler ( and I and Andrea, along with the rest of SG this year) have worked very hard to get the organization back onto an equal playing field.   The next step, and my biggest and most challenging campaign goal, is for SG to have a voting representative on the Board of Trustees. I believe it would be the ultimate form of accountability on administrative policies, and who's a bigger trustee to the University then the students that live everyday through the policies they put in place?  (PS: thanks for this site, it's a cool graphic and the whole thing is an important lesson to teach students about picking the right leaders in SG)"
rit,31r0ig,pinkfloydchick64,2,Tue Apr 7 22:40:55 2015 UTC,"I believe, although I can't dig up the sources at the moment, the ""personal"" ballot was an unofficial poll done just after the first official vote that asked the individuals ""what would you like to see, as a student and not as a representative"" and was not intended to be released. This lead some students to question whether their representatives were truly giving it their all on this issue; when it was clear overall students at the time were opposed to the idea.   The answer that you would side with the students is reassuring (and a little obvious!) but I think the fear at the time was that those elected to represent students did not share the ""common"" view, with 100% of representatives voting differently for them selves against who they represent.   I'm not so sure if it is something that needs to happen all the time, but it is interesting to know where those represented stand on an individual level. I'd rather know the answer to ""how would you vote on this issue if you were not elected, but instead asked casually,"" but I'd personally be afraid to answer differently.   I'd also love to see SG have a stronger voice on IC issues... but I don't think the past bears that out. Of course, only time will tell! Good luck in the future."
rit,31r0ig,rrb159,0,Tue Apr 7 23:09:13 2015 UTC,"Ah interesting. I honestly don't expect the personal opinion to differ much from the vote, because in a perfect world you should always have the opinion to vote on what's best for your constituency.   There always is the problem with any constituent-based voting body that they sometimes only represent the people in the room, and not the entire colleges. It would be interesting to implement the personal vote again next year and see what the difference is.

If so, would you still consider yourselves to have been chosen - in a meaningful way - by the student body?  How would you want people to think about this?  It seems kind of silly that the leader of the student government - a position which derives its authority from the democratic process - is the leader for no reason other than that no else wants the job...  ...good luck?"

In fact, several other teams picked up packets- nobody else turned them in and became an official candidate.   Anyone else who wanted to could have gone through the same process I did, or could even start a write-in campaign right now. While one candidate for Pres/VP doesn't happen often, its not unusual for a position in SG to have only one official candidate on the ballot.  Let me know if you'd like to stop and grab coffee, I'd love to show you that I'm qualified for the position- even if there's only me on the ballot!"

Those places can get seriously nasty.   -Your RA keeps a vacuum for you guys to use, find out where they live and vacuum your dorm once a month or so. You'd be surprised how nasty it gets.   -Don't waste money getting more than a 12+ meal plan, you honestly won't use the meals and it's a waste of money.  -Go to the hockey games, we have a fancy new hockey center on campus. The women's games are free and you can get tickets for the men's games for 'free' by donating a can of food to res life. And go early, they hand out free stuff before games 75% of the time.   -There's a place to rent movies in the tunnels under the res halls. The hours are a little annoying, but it's super easy to pick up a movie on the way to Gracies. It's free and you get the movie for 3 days.   -Join the RIT Free and For Sale page on facebook, and keep an eye on it as this school year ends (if you live at all nearby). You can get a lot of stuff for your dorm way cheaper than you would from like target or something.   -If you're gonna go off campus, always bring your ID. A lot of places have discounts for college students.   -The apartment buses swing by the residence halls stop (right outside gleason) around 10 minutes before the hour. They'll get you to academic side 5 minutes before the hour, super easy way to get to class when the weather is nasty.   -Make as many connections with your professors as you can, you'll likely need them to remember you later for recommendations and such. Plus some professors have really good professional contacts, that can get you a job.   -There's a theater in Henrietta called Cinemark Movies 10. If you don't mind watching movies a couple months after they've come out, tickets usually run about $2.50, it's great for a super cheap outing.   -The RIT Inn sucks. Avoid it at all costs.   -Join facebook groups of clubs you're interested in. If you can make friends with upperclassmen you'll likely be able to find better housing your second year. There's a surprising amount of people in prime housing looking for roommates, who just don't know anyone who needs housing.   -Gracies posts their menu here, so you can decide if you want to go eat there that night or not: https://www.rit.edu/fa/diningservices/content/gracies"

rit,31f3cu,Brysamo,2,Sat Apr 4 16:11:45 2015 UTC,I liked it.  We had 4 people in one of the townhouses.  Everyone had their own room.
rit,31f3cu,C7J0yc3,2,Sat Apr 4 16:11:56 2015 UTC,Lived there for 3 years. No major complaints. I split a townhouse with one other roommate and we each paid $650 a month (rent + RG&E + Time Warner + Washer / Dryer + insurance). I would probably not hesitate to live there again. I will say if you or your room mate make enough at your job to not need a guarantor I would highly recommend not telling them you're students. When I lived there they charged $600 instead of $300 for security deposit if you were a student.

We have 5 people living here which makes our rent about $390 a month including utilities. It's only about a 10 minute drive to RIT from here, which totally beats using buses in my opinion. It's also pretty quiet here, so you won't have dickheads outside your window making noise every night like in PP or Province."

The commute is better with a car, I know some people who do walk the 3 miles to and from campus each day. Maintenance is usually quick to respond, never had any complaints. I'm moving out this May and back to Connecticut for a $1700 1br/1.5ba, so $805 is a great steal."

I'm a second year IT major and if I could go back in time I'd just get a tablet with an attachable keyboard for taking notes and just skip the laptop, as I much prefer working on projects with a dual monitor desktop setup, and there are also plenty of open labs to do work (as well as many of your classes being in computer labs). I honestly have used my laptop more often in non-computing classes for taking notes than for doing computing work."
rit,31coo6,Pokebunny,6,Fri Apr 3 21:31:14 2015 UTC,As a third year IT student all I have to add to your comment is that the keyboards and mice in the labs are disgusting so you might want to bring your own.  But that's why I use my own laptop.

Don't do it. Get a Macbook Air or a Macbook Pro. You're gonna be spending a lot of time in a *nix environment so you might as well get a good native one instead of using some bullshit like Cygwin or having to deal with hardware incompatibility and shitty font rendering in Linux.

rit,31coo6,avita1,4,Sat Apr 4 04:37:55 2015 UTC,"Nope, he's pretty right. Almost every class either suggests Java because that's what people tend to know from CS1-2-3(whatever it is now), or lets you choose to use whatever technology you want. There's very little if any scripting or interaction with any kind of *nix environments for the direct purposes of any SE classes.  For our CS4 equivalent there's lab computers or cygwin shenanigans.   Some of the newer iterations of the classes I think use some common web frameworks but still doesn't apply. I did 3/4 of my projects in my last year and a half in C#."
rit,31coo6,Furtwangler,4,Sat Apr 4 06:36:17 2015 UTC,He is right about that. Most SE classes are based out of Windows.

Both near 1k out the door, with the Air having better battery, and either:   More storage Better processor   I mean, I got my macbook pro with the biggest screen with 16 GB RAM, dedicated graphics card + the internal for 1.6k because of student rebates.  It didn't seem too bad, especially because I prefer *nix environment.  I have windows, linux and mac on it though.  I think it should just be preference.

You're better off buying a cheap $300-$500 tablet that can run basic IDEs and have some space for storage, and then maybe in a year or two get a heavy desktop for ~600 or so and get yourself two monitors. The gaming laptop will be super overpriced, have shitty battery life, and generally be a pain in the ass to take to/from class.   http://www.microsoft.com/surface/en-us/products/surface-3 just showed up, and if I was still in school I'd jump on that hard.

Sometimes it works and they catch something, sometimes people consistently say no and then they can't.   Edit: I think in some cases they are allowed to do a search without your consent and if that's the case then they will tell you that they are doing so.  If they say something like ""we're going to search your room now."" there's not a whole lot you can do about it.

Also, what makes you think someone called to complain about the smell? It's the woods. Much more likely a bored bully out in search of a power trip."

Honestly I find this inappropriate, why should students who doesn't even smoke weed have to be addressed by PS? It's really immature in all part. Now if someone was complaining about someone smoking in there, that would make sense, but to have a officer patrol the wood like that? That's just a waste of their time, as well a waste of other student's time who is falsely accused, like what the poster have mentioned. He had classes to go to, and the campo officer was wasting their time.   Here's an idea for the Director of Public Safety, Stop patrolling the wood. There already have been enough complaints from students."

rit,30tog1,daz371,3,Tue Mar 31 14:22:10 2015 UTC,"Just a suggestion but I'd strongly consider reducing the number of teams so you can give each team more funding. For something like this your average team is going to be between 3 and 5 people. $10,000 sounds like a lot but a bad engineer can get $2,500 a month on coop in Rochester. At 3 people they likely aren't getting enough money to make it worthwhile, and at 5 they aren't going to have enough to cover 3 months worth of room and board.   You would also rather they be using some/all/majority of that money towards their idea. Obviously more funding is easier said than done, and someone will take you up on this but just be aware you're probably going to lose out on a lot of really good teams simply due to financial situations."

rit,30qjfz,eyeoutthere,2,Sun Mar 29 22:14:33 2015 UTC,"Good times. The corner crew killed it in Detroit as well. We didn't beat Wisconsin, but we out-cheered them handily. Even in the championship game the crew help their ground in the corner and had some great exchanges with the Wisconsin fans.  There was an awesome video of the line to buy tickets (to the Regional Final game, I think). It was a sea of RIT fans and a single couple wearing UNH colors. The RIT fans started the ""Hey, you suck"" chant with excellent precision. It was beautiful. Wish I cold find that video."

rit,30phwv,mar7967,2,Sun Mar 29 18:19:24 2015 UTC,I have a feeling there won't be enough people there for an awesome atmosphere. MacGregors is smaller so with a lot less people it can still have an epic atmosphere. Plus way better food and drinks!

rit,30f562,xzzz,1 point,Thu Mar 26 23:42:27 2015 UTC,"Yup as a ""guest chef"" same price as the food too. So nice even as an employee because Wayne lets us have the left over chicken some times."

rit,30f562,Ecchii,2,Fri Mar 27 00:23:56 2015 UTC,"Wayne, the owner of Wok with You explained to me that he closed down his Park Point location for several reasons, mainly that the overhead was high for Wok with You and there was a lot of time spent commuting back and forth between his restaurants. He now runs Oishii Sushi in the Global Village Cantina and Grille. The counter there lets him make sushi for the entire campus as well as come in as a visiting chef but with a much smaller footprint. That means that any time you get sushi on campus it's from the same people who ran Wok with You and you can find their hot food in Sol's nearly every night of the week. Their other brick and mortar location, The Wok, opened last year on Genesee Street near the University of Rochester and is very similar to Wok with You."

rit,30e52t,Joseph_S,9,Thu Mar 26 17:21:11 2015 UTC,"Part of your financial aid might be ""work-study"" which is different then regular aid. Instead of being credited to your account, you have to find a job on-campus, work, and then you get a pay check (nearly tax free yeah buddy).  Its not guaranteed and its actual money, not just statement credit, but when you get your break down of financial aid, it will have it on there like it assumes you will do it."
rit,30e52t,MillerRoad,3,Thu Mar 26 17:34:03 2015 UTC,It's all a matter of if you state that you want to do work-study on your FAFSA.

rit,30e52t,urbngrd,2,Thu Mar 26 18:57:52 2015 UTC,It depends entirely on the financial aid package you're offered. The financial aid I'm currently receiving requires me to work on campus. The financial aid I had as an undergrad didn't.

rit,309kcb,alixer,4,Wed Mar 25 16:12:54 2015 UTC,Just talk to your advisor. You'll probably have to work with them to make sure you don't fall behind in your curriculum.
rit,309kcb,lmg6841,3,Wed Mar 25 16:33:56 2015 UTC,"I'm already graduating a semester early (if I don't take one off).  I have a handfull of classes that can only be taken in the spring and the rest are either just fall or both.    This idea is in it's infancy and I'll have a chance to get with my advisers once I get back from co-op (or call them, or email).  I'm trying not to get ahead of myself so I may just seriously address it when I'm back on campus.   I'm mostly curious about how people dealt with going off full time status then returning."
rit,309kcb,GCCISAlum,4,Wed Mar 25 16:39:21 2015 UTC,"RIT does offer leave of absences, though I'm not sure you'd need one for a single semester. Your best bet would be to talk to your advisor.

rit,30840u,brya2,1 point,Thu Mar 26 22:46:17 2015 UTC,It may have taken forever because they work on a priority system and emergencies rank higher than keys locked in a car.

rit,300b08,Sappin,3,Mon Mar 23 13:13:30 2015 UTC,"I did this, but I needed special permission from the department, and it was mostly allowed because it was the last year of the quarter system and I had finished my credits. YMMV. You may also find it makes your employment situation a little sketchy or hard to explain to recruiters/managers; ""I'm graduating, well sort of, I have the classes but I don't have a degree yet, it's complicated."""
rit,300b08,fiskars007,1 point,Mon Mar 23 14:15:09 2015 UTC,"Yea I was worried about having to explain this to recruiters.  ""Oh I'm done with my degree but need more co-op experience before I can work as a full employee...""  Making it this far with too few co-op credits kind of makes taking a co-op at all seem sort of pointless."
rit,300b08,ozzimark,3,Mon Mar 23 14:30:25 2015 UTC,"Why worry about it? It means that you are in a perfect position to transition from co-op to full-time employee if you do a good job.  I did pretty much exactly what you're in the position of, but a step further: I ""graduated"" in May '09 with the understanding from my department that I would get the co-op done over the summer and finish up a few classes in the fall. Got a summer co-op, became a full time employee after the co-op, and took evening classes to finish up all my credit-hours in the fall quarter. My real diploma was mailed to me after I finished the classes.  It was hectic towards the end there, but everything worked out."
rit,300b08,ozzimark,1 point,Mon Mar 23 14:43:40 2015 UTC,"So you were still able to attend graduation in May of 09 even though you were co-oping that summer as well as taking night classes that fall? Awesome, so this is possible then. Great! Of course I'll need to talk with my adviser more but I'm glad its been done. I'm still worried about actually finding that last co-op... but I'm sure I will."
rit,300b08,yamugushi,2,Mon Mar 23 14:52:16 2015 UTC,"Yup, I was given an exception so that I could ""graduate with my peers""."
rit,300b08,UPBOAT_FORTRESS_2,1 point,Mon Mar 23 14:55:57 2015 UTC,I don't think this is an 'exception' anymore. Or at least in CAST it appears to be the norm. I know one guy who's walking this spring and graduating after a summer-fall Co-Op. And the department told me I could have walked and graduated after taking fall classes (as opposed waiting until next spring) if I wanted to. I think it might be a byproduct of the conversion because originally there the courses I needed weren't available during the fall. I am however graduating on time so I'm happy.
rit,300b08,fiskars007,2,Mon Mar 23 18:26:19 2015 UTC,"I found a full-time job and explained that after 10 weeks, my supervisor would have to fill out a form describing my performance. It was at a smallish company with no established relationship with RIT, and they were happy to accomodate.  Like ozzimark, I walked across stage before I even found the job"
rit,300b08,tkforeverer,0,Mon Mar 23 17:16:51 2015 UTC,"In my case I finished the five-year program in four, so I ended in an unusual way. But it's super annoying to have to co-op until the spring comes around again (happened to someone I knew, he co-oped 9 months straight because he needed a spring-only class).  If you have a good relationship with a recruiter you might be able to swing the employment, but it's up to your department if they'll allow it -- technically the requirement for senior project was all co-ops completed. If your grades are good that helps as well."
rit,300b08,gte6495,2,Mon Mar 23 17:19:19 2015 UTC,All good. I walked with the rest of my buds in the spring and went on co-op in the fall/winter of the next year.

rit,300b08,avita1,3,Mon Mar 23 13:22:25 2015 UTC,Entirely depends on program. I know my program (Applied Networking) will let you finish on coop.   I have also heard of people getting full time and counting the first 3-6 months of their job as coop.

rit,300b08,drphillycheesesteak,2,Mon Mar 23 13:40:06 2015 UTC,"Right, but what /u/gte6495 is saying is that the general guideline is that for most GCCIS programs is that the last semester must be academic, but if you just need one co-op they usually will make an exception.   I think that the rule is there so that MOST students will actually go out and get co-ops during their career at RIT, and not just try to shit them off to be ""Future me's problem,"" and then expect RIT to let them get a full-time job and count the first year of it as ""Co-Op."""

Other companies had the same idea, e.g. ""Adappt"", but could potentially be locked out, not because they didn't have as great of an idea, but because they didn't win the patent race.

Then it's just a matter of downloading a new weather paradigm into the piano stored in the L2 basement of COLA. I'd recommend bringing a team with you -- A comp sci kid, a Reporter staffer who knows Harold Kalpa's password, some dingbat who understands the connection between the Infinity quad and the Sundial (and who can affect repairs on said sundial), some chump to sacrifice to Al, and a mildly attractive counterpart that you get to kiss at the end of the quest.

Your average starting salary is going to be in the low $50k/year which is not as comfortable as it seems when you have to pay $700 a month in student loans on top of rent, utilities, food, health care and all the while saving for a house (or whatever big purchase you'd make)."

If you come to RIT I would recommend you incorporate MIS into your major somehow. The Finance and MIS programs here are extremely strong.

We will honor any type of current RIT permit (Commuter, Housing Permits, After Hours Permits) in all general areas on campus from Monday, March 23 through Friday, March 27th.  Reserve parking areas and all other specialty parking areas will continue to require the specific passes and will be enforced.

In the fact, the only piece that felt more than merely re-instated, but reinterpreted, was bits on the quilt that captured more of a zeitgeist of the feminists of the new millennium.

Standing up for the environment or civil rights isn't an ideal that progressives alone hold important. However, progressives tend to put those issues above everything else at the expense of a lot of other things. Moderates or conservatives prioritize things a little differently, and what makes everything worse is that science and reporting on any civil or environmental issue is presented with bias.

So if you have to stop by these places, you may walk your bike with you, put it at the area, and go in.  The bike is quick enough where you can most certainly ride close as possible and simply walk the rest, leaving us walkers to our slower travel.

Unlocking and locking a bike takes < 30 seconds.  Easily.  Add that to getting on top of your bike and getting going, we'll say a minute unlocking and a minute locking.  So, from a normal pace, it takes dorm people 10 - 15 minutes to walk from dorm to Golisano.  You're saying you couldn't bike there from dorms in 8 - 13 minutes?  I fail to see that.  Biking is faster in both cases, but I'm sorry it affects you so negatively to also have to walk sometimes."

Public Safety has every authority on campus to enforce its rules. If you don't obey them, you simply get removed from campus.  They can't detain you themselves, but law enforcement can for trespassing."

rit,2zeidz,pokemonhgharris,1 point,Wed Mar 18 21:15:00 2015 UTC,"Fun thing there, by going to RIT, you agree to follow all of RIT's rules, which include respecting the orders and requests of Public Safety. If they ask you for your ID, you are required to provide it, or risk disciplinary action from the institute. Fighting with campo over shit is a dumb idea, because while they aren't police, they have a great working relationship with the sheriffs, and you have given campo a lot of authority over you by coming to RIT."

I use that intersection all the time to get off the quarter mile and towards the admissions building and field house.  That is also right near the library 'alley' that has a big 'no bikes/boards' sign on it, which people are more likely to follow.  I'm fine with ticketing people further toward residential side, because there is no reason for people to be on the quarter mile there, or even at the bottom of the hill they are currently on because people shouldn't be blasting down that hill during peak hours anymore, but this is a pretty dumb place to be ticketing people."

rit,2zeidz,Joeber17,1 point,Wed Mar 18 05:12:04 2015 UTC,"Yes, they're essentially unenforceable to non-students.  If you claim that you're not a student, then they'd just ask you for your real ID to log in their system.  You're within your rights to refuse, but they can then ask you to leave campus and make sure you do.  If you refuse that, then they'll call in the sheriffs to help them remove you, which will also probably result in campo banning you from campus.  Sheriffs will ask you for your ID and keep that information handy in case you come back.  All in all, it's far easier on you to just pay the damn fine instead of trying to do an end-around on the system.  EDIT: Also, if you leave campus on a car registered with parking, it's trivial for them to look up the registration and match your face to your ID picture in the system."

Also, them buying some off road type vehicles makes a ton of sense. For one, they're significantly cheaper than a car, even at state bid. They are also more maneuverable to calls that aren't along a roadway, (for example the woods) and can get to calls as fast, if not faster because they can take bike paths and other ""non road, paved routes"" on campus, which a car doesn't really fit down as easily."

That said, the time when campo chose to do this (~6 in the evening) was not a busy time. The quarter mile was basically clear and the only people going by were slow and controlled with no one around them. If they're going to enforce the rule they should do it during a time when people are actually getting hit or having to dodge bad boarders or bicyclists."
rit,2zeidz,copperlegend,3,Wed Mar 18 11:59:03 2015 UTC,You keep focusing on the time but little do you know that they do enforce it starting at 7am at different areas of the 1/4 mile. It says right in your students rights and responsibilities handbook that the 1/4 mile is a strictly walking only zone between 7am and 7pm which means campo can enforce it anytime during that time frame regardless of foot traffic level. Like it or not it's gonna happen.
rit,2zeidz,nubbyy,-2,Wed Mar 18 12:29:22 2015 UTC,I just think their inconsistent enforcement (and usage of an off-roading vehicle to do it at this part) is creating a bad message and a bad situation overall. Sorry if the idea of inconsistency bothers you.

He even mentioned that his boss thinks that having them stand there is a waste of time.  My big things are, if you want longboarders and bikers to stay off the quarter mile, make a good alternative. The bike path is never cleared properly. The day I was on the quarter mile was the same day that the section of the bike path by the woods had ice on it. The section by the library is constantly littered with rocks from the chewed up asphalt by the bus stop. Additionally I've been yelled at by pedestrians for going fast on the bike path. So whether its the bike path or the quarter mile, people still get sandy. To most people that means they will take the faster option if they're going to get flak anyhow."

And then you have to purchase an all-weather climate controlled housing for it. Pay someone to install it. Pay to power it. Pay to have Ethernet installed (it's not cheap drilling through the corner of a brick building). All of that adds up to a couple hundred dollars which isn't much, but multiply that for a few webcams that end up needing to be replaced every couple years and it adds up.  Do you really think the webcams are a make or break item? How many prospective students are looking at the webcam saying, ""Man I wish I was there!""?

He was also frustrated because those webcams use java and he didn't know how to sign the applet (required for modern browsers).

The psychiatrist, Dr. Lavine, is very good, and when I was seeing him he encouraged me to continue seeing people in the counseling center. I've never seen another psychiatrist, but from what I've heard of them he is more understanding and better at working to find a good medication. I stopped going to the therapists because it reached a point where the sessions didn't benefit me anymore. I stopped going to the psychiatrist because I kept forgetting appointments and was too anxious to make new ones after flaking out. If I can work up the motivation I know it would be beneficial to make an appointment and get back on medication, but I know I would have to wait a month at least for an appointment and it seems so overwhelming."
rit,2zcd8y,groo667,2,Wed Mar 18 04:43:17 2015 UTC,"Seconding everything you said here! Rhea and Raquel are awesome, but unfortunately don't have enough time to help everyone. I hope they hire more counselors of their caliber.  Dr. Lavine's a good guy too, he listened to my concerns about my previous experiences with medication and helped me find one that worked for me.  You should make an appointment anyway. You can do it, I believe in you :) you were brave enough to do it once so I know you can do it again."
rit,2zcd8y,Sleipnoir,5,Fri Mar 20 00:35:48 2015 UTC,"I left the counseling center at RIT and got an external professional to write me a note of prescription for a therapy dog under the Fair Housing Act (the RIT psychiatrist refused, because apparently RIT doesn't allow them to do that even if the student lives off campus, regardless of where they live). So much better than the counselors, who didn't do anything, or the meds, which seemed like overkill, especially for a condition that was never even narrowed down (I still don't know if I have depression or bipolar 2)."
rit,2zcd8y,Rodents210,1 point,Tue Mar 17 20:58:25 2015 UTC,I actually felt the opposite in regards to medication! I went in wanting an SSRI and was given the impression that they'd rather me just do counseling. Stuck to my guns and they finally agreed to let me see the doctor to get medicine if I did counseling at the same time.
rit,2zcd8y,Sleipnoir,7,Fri Mar 20 00:30:30 2015 UTC,"Wow this was a harsh article. I couldn't make the meeting, if I had I wouldn't have stood up to offer my experience, because I wouldn't want to be known as someone who needed the counseling center.  My counselor and my group were both huge helps, I probably would have dropped out/flunked out without my counselor and life would have been much less enjoyable without the group.  The counselors are great, there just aren't enough of them.  I'd also like to say that Olive is a sweet little ball of cuddly cuteness."
rit,2zcd8y,odds_arrgh,13,Tue Mar 17 23:22:06 2015 UTC,"Personally, my own experience with the counseling center was great. I was able to get a weekly meeting at a steady time for the later half of last semester with little trouble. The only issue was getting the initial meeting set up. Outside of that, I love my counselor and am really grateful to have been able to talk to her one on one. I know that she mentioned there are additional group sessions, but I can understand the demand for one on one sessions. I do not think the center is atrociously failing, I just think they are short handed for such a huge student body, not that they do not care, or do not want to help like some students in the article mentioned."
rit,2zcd8y,Protocol_Fenrir,24,Tue Mar 17 13:04:50 2015 UTC,It's not like we were half the size yesterday. Why is the center not large enough to accommodate the university? That's not an excuse; that's an unacceptable failure.
rit,2zcd8y,Doc_Faust,18,Tue Mar 17 13:25:01 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying it should not be large enough, I am just defending that I believe the counselors there really do want to help people, and just the short-handedness is the issue, not that our counselors don't care."

It would be about a 10% increase in the student heath fee.  Not everyone is as cavalier about paying for others people services if they themselves don't use them."
rit,2zcd8y,MillerRoad,17,Tue Mar 17 17:02:59 2015 UTC,"I don't use labs in buildings like Gleason or Booth, but I'm sure my money goes to the maintenance of said labs. Why should it be any different when it comes to mental health of your fellow students? If an unstable student was to lose it, it could very well put everyone on this campus at risk. Then we would all be wishing we just paid a bit more."
rit,2zcd8y,Joeber17,-13,Tue Mar 17 17:11:27 2015 UTC,"This argument is akin to government aid/obama care.  People don't like paying for other peoples things.  The fact is expanding resources costs us all money, or sacrificing other services. Don't be so quick to assume everyone is okay with it."

RIT charges us for some of the most ridiculous things. Parking services and campus safety drive around in new 25k+ vehicles while we have students disappear into the night never to be seen again by their love ones. Stop putting a dollar amount on a human life."
rit,2zcd8y,Joeber17,-5,Tue Mar 17 17:21:09 2015 UTC,"18000 people. Bad things happen, its inevitable.  With that many people, hundreds are going to have serious health problems, some will end the year in prison, some may die of natural causes (as at least 4 have this year), some are going to die from accidents, and some, as sad as it might be, might commit suicide. Unfortunately in the real world, a dollar amount is put on everything. If you need a transplant and don't have insurance, sorry but its not going to happen.  Healthcare is not a free service, at least in this country."
rit,2zcd8y,MillerRoad,7,Tue Mar 17 17:26:08 2015 UTC,"I have to say I agree that bad things happen. But I have seen this issue pertaining to the CC come up way too many times over my past three years here. If such an issue comes up repeatedly in a short period of time, when are we going to accept that it actually maybe an issue that needs addressing. I think people at this school need to take a step back, and attempt to put themselves into the shoes of their fellow students and realize that it ain't that easy for everyone. Mental health is no joke, it can really ruin your life. To just brush it off as ""bad things happen"" is in my opinion unsympathetic. Something I notice a lot of students here seem to be :/"

rit,2zcd8y,white-forest,1 point,Tue Mar 17 19:07:02 2015 UTC,"Grants generally don't renew, so it just delays trying to find the money. If you want to find the money, you have to cut 300k from the CC and SHC budget, which only adda to the problem. How many people have committed suicide this year? One maybe two? I know ""you can't put a price on a life"" but the law of diminishing returns says eventually the cost to save one more life is insanely high.   I agree there is a huge issue with the counseling center but people have to remember that money is a factor here. Student don't want the costs to increase and want the university to do more with less. Human resources aren't cheap. Don't forget that side of things. Adding bodies to the CC isn't as simple as it seems"
rit,2zcd8y,PresBill,3,Tue Mar 17 15:45:31 2015 UTC,"How would you suggest going about the issue? Without raising school costs, considering our tuition already goes up 4% on average every year."
rit,2zcd8y,Joeber17,3,Tue Mar 17 16:41:50 2015 UTC,Tuition goes up 4% per year because salaries and vendor costs go up. Those of us in the working world like having these things called raises.
rit,2zcd8y,ht5k,2,Tue Mar 17 17:22:22 2015 UTC,"That's fantastic and I encourage such. However if money is needed elsewhere they should consider reallocating it from areas that don't need that money or don't perform well enough to deserve it. Sacrifices monetarily need to be made for the betterment of students on this campus. Remember, those in the working world here at RIT rely on the students to be employed as much as students need professors to actually teach. Plus that 4% also takes into account inflation. Long story short, college costs far too much, and people suffer mentally and physically as a result."
rit,2zcd8y,Joeber17,2,Tue Mar 17 17:30:45 2015 UTC,HOW DARE YOU tassajara007! You want to take money away from our hard working FMS employees and invest in the mental health of our students!?!?!
rit,2zcd8y,Joeber17,2,Wed Mar 18 03:55:58 2015 UTC,"That is also something for the government to handle.  Private sector costs are market based. If people feel that more services should be provided with no cost increase or that things should be cheaper, then the state should step in with subsidies, tax relief, or a combination thereof."
rit,2zcd8y,ht5k,2,Wed Mar 18 16:29:58 2015 UTC,"I'm not quite sure, but then again I'm not a business/fiscal expert.  I think the problem is that everyone has ideas on how to solve the problem, but the dollar signs don't add up.  More resources are great, but there is a point where the cost of additional resources is a limiting factor. Experienced psychiatrists (MDs) and good psychologists (MS or PhDs) aren't cheap and adding half a million to a budget is a big deal."
rit,2zcd8y,PresBill,-3,Tue Mar 17 17:42:18 2015 UTC,"People aren't dying. All the deaths of RIT students and faculty this academic year except for Max Maisel (which nobody knows if it was a suicide attempt), were due to pre-existing medical conditions."
rit,2zcd8y,ratboid314,5,Tue Mar 17 17:07:42 2015 UTC,"There was 1 students suicide that occurred this year at the beginning of the Fall semester.   Regardless, many students come to college in their late teens and early twenties. They experience transitions that can be extremely difficult to manage. We are at the prime age for mental health disorder development.  It can take years for the effects of an untreated mental health problem to bring someone to the point in their life that they feel they are no longer worth living.  We have the ability to have a lasting impact on one of the most stigmatized category of diseases in this country. Assisting students with mental health issues will help them perform better in class, and allow them to get the most out of their time here."
rit,2zcd8y,Noffy4Life,2,Tue Mar 17 20:28:48 2015 UTC,Of course I would! Especially if it means a better experience for myself and my fellow classmates. The health and well-being of our peers should always be our number one priority.
rit,2zcd8y,Noffy4Life,18,Tue Mar 17 22:03:39 2015 UTC,"This is another example of RIT administration's severe failures in providing students with an environment worth living in, and worth paying for. I stopped recommending RIT years ago and don't see myself supporting the Institute unless things like this change. The school is a faceless business."
rit,2zcd8y,saf3,8,Tue Mar 17 20:39:22 2015 UTC,"I feel the same way. My student advisor was never available and didn't show to meetings we had scheduled, financial aid office lost my fafsa paperwork and the student health center was useless when I needed it."

rit,2zcd8y,ht5k,7,Tue Mar 17 16:29:52 2015 UTC,I would argue that college is far more than just an avenue to an education. College is a time for students to mature and grow. We are a community of students who do a whole lot of other things besides academics. The growth and maturation process a student goes through should be a priority to any school that wishes for their students to be well-educated.  It is in everyone's best interest that our community takes care of everyone both inside and outside of the classroom.
rit,2zcd8y,Noffy4Life,3,Tue Mar 17 17:20:24 2015 UTC,"We are a community. It is our responsibility to support and assist students as they grow and mature through their time here. You say college is what you make of it yourself, and I wholeheartedly agree with that.  The voices have grown louder and louder. A large number of students want these services. They want to make it the best for themselves. Education is as much a ""business"" as it is an opportunity to learn and grow. Increasing quality and availability of mental health services to students will help facilitate that growth."
rit,2zcd8y,Noffy4Life,4,Tue Mar 17 20:26:44 2015 UTC,Is that what's advertised though? Sure it's pretty awesome if that's what you're being told to expect and that's what you want. If you're being told otherwise and expect otherwise though then it's a scam.
rit,2zcd8y,jayjaywalker3,10,Tue Mar 17 20:35:03 2015 UTC,It was to me. All the publicity in my day was about career placement and the co-op experience as a leg up on other schools.
rit,2zcd8y,ht5k,4,Tue Mar 17 15:20:51 2015 UTC,"The first time I went for help (2009), I was given a timely one on one appointment. The counselor was wonderful and the time spent there was positively invaluable. That counselor saved my life.  I went in again my senior year hoping for a similar experience, and was assigned to a group, as they had eliminated one on one counselors for anyone but ""the most severe cases"". I felt as though I was being turned away.  It was a terrible experience. No one wanted to share their deeply personal situations with strangers (and of both sexes). It felt as though everyone was apologizing for being there or whining, a ""oh, I'm sure you're going through more than me"" feeling. I never went back, and no one followed up with me.   It's hard enough to reach out when you need help as it is. Knowing/hearing rumors that the program isn't so great will only make it worse. I know they're short handed, but a better solution has to be out there. I am glad to see this issue receiving some attention."
rit,2zcd8y,josie914,9,Tue Mar 17 16:12:51 2015 UTC,"This is my fifth and final year at RIT. The counseling center was an absolute embarrassment to the university my freshman year, and has gotten much, much worse since then. I would go so far as to say it does more harm than good."
rit,2zcd8y,Rodents210,2,Wed Mar 18 01:51:36 2015 UTC,"This is exactly what I experienced. They ask you if you're going to kill yourself. If the answer is yes, you're hospitalized. If the answer is no, you get in line with everyone else. There's no such thing as a partial emergency - if you're preemptively getting help because you don't want your situation to escalate to that point, or you honestly don't know how safe you are, you're not their problem. Suicidality is often a cry for help, and they make it very clear they're not going to be the ones to give it to you. They only care about their legal liability. If you're patient enough to wait, and you manage to get into individual therapy, it's a temporary solution until they can get you to agree to group - including group therapy for social anxiety, which is like a bad joke.   It's more than I should share, but I got an independent diagnosis of Avoidant Personality Disorder and agoraphobia, after describing the exact same symptoms. The counselors at RIT must have known the DSM well enough to tell me, but kept it to themselves, because they'd rather shoehorn me into an existing group.   By the way, here are the statistics RIT lists on the website:   Group counselors created a safe & supportive environment: 97% agree  My group helped me to feel better about myself and to take more effective action: 86% agree  I would recommend my group/workshop to other students: 89% agree  I would attend group therapy again if needed: 93% agree   -- http://www.rit.edu/studentaffairs/counseling/services.php#group"
rit,2zfaxg,wonderwall6,3,Wed Mar 18 02:21:40 2015 UTC,"About to graduate as an engineer. RIT is wonderful. It is a very good self contained community with access to the downtown Rochester area if you want it.  Seeing that you are from Southern CA... it is going to be colder than you expect. I assume that you know that it is going to be cold in the winter, but it will still surprise you. It is not the temperature that gets you, it is the wind. RIT is windy. Very windy.  The spring, summer, and fall are all very wonderful though!"
rit,2zfaxg,ApolloNeverDied,2,Wed Mar 18 16:44:21 2015 UTC,"RIT is a pretty nice/active community. There is always different social events going on (Thursday night cinema, bingo, capture the flag, Freezefest, etc) so you will have things to do if you don't want to hole up in your dorm. RIT is actually in Henrietta, not Rochester, so it can be difficult to get into the city if you don't own a car (Rochester is about a half hour away by car). There is a mall and a few strip malls nearby that you can get to by bus though.  I found this link which has all the classes your major requires by type, and this which has it by year. It appears to be a 4 year program. Also note the general education requirement at the bottom of the first link there. You will have to take one class from each category (one artistic, one social, one global, and one ethical) in order to graduate. RIT believes liberal arts is subject that joins all the majors together (they built the college smack dab in the center of campus for this reason) so everyone has to take classes from there to balance out their education. You will also need to take two gym classes, but with options like urban beekeeping, massage, ice skating, and billiards its not that hard to do and the highlight of many peoples days.    RIT is extremely job oriented. They acknowledge that the whole point of you coming here is to get a job, so the college tries to build relations to companies and maintain them with alumni to give the students a leg up. My professors are always asking what sort of jobs I'm looking for and how my application process is going. They also offer to look over resumes and help get us in contact with alums in the industry. I'm not in the college of science, but I think the feeling extends across the campus.   Thing I would change about RIT? Too cold all the time. Most of the year you will be wearing a heavy coat. Also, trying to get anywhere that is not RIT if you don't have a car is a hassle."
rit,2zfaxg,Qani,2,Wed Mar 18 12:50:20 2015 UTC,"Rochester is about a half hour away by car   Wat? It of course depends on where specifically you're talking about, but you should be able to get to center city in 15 minutes most times of the day except for rush hours (9am/5pm).  Of course my favorite neighborhood, Swillberg, you can get to in ~10mins.  I will agree 100% with the sentiment that RIT and Rochester as a whole are two very distinct communities. I know plenty of RIT students (and even alumni who have stayed here for work) that do not go into the city period."
rit,2zfaxg,yamugushi,1 point,Thu Mar 19 02:43:01 2015 UTC,"Well, yes, it does depend on where you are going in the city (it's quite large after all). I was thinking of trips the public market or to the train station/bus station, which both take about a half hour by car."
rit,2zfaxg,Qani,2,Thu Mar 19 03:12:35 2015 UTC,"Hello! Fellow California native (near LA to be exact--there's quite a bit of us) and I've been here at RIT for 5 years now. I'm not kidding (and others) say it's cold here. The winters have been getting worse these last few years, BUT they are entirely possible to deal with. Just bundle up more, be perpared, and dress in layers. Pretty standard stuff, but seriously be prepared to get rid of the notion of expecting to look outside and you'll figure out what's the weather is like. If it's sunny in the middle of winter, it's gonna be hella windy and cold (the wind cuts like a knife -- nothing like the Santa Ana winds). The first question out of everyone's mouth when they find out where you're from will always be ""Why the **** are you here??"" (or some variation of it).   I'm speaking from a SoCal perspective here so forgive me. RIT students are kind of a group of people who weren't exactly the popular kids in high school -- or the prettiest. Upon coming here, you meet these people and watch them grow. They are interesting in both good and bad ways. Everyone is nerdy here in some way; nerd at RIT means to take an interest in something (anything really) and go after it like crazy (sports, games, anime, technology, engineering, etc). It's a little different than California because Californians focus on what hiding what makes them truly interesting and unique. RIT is also sort of a party school, but it's very underground to some degree and there's not much of a pressure to be a part of it.   You'll find a lot of clubs that are academically focused regarding the major and have an emphasis for networking. There's a club for almost everything and if there isn't, there's ways to make your own. The great thing about RIT (at least compared to some of the California Universities I visited) is that students have access to so many labs, resources, tools, and services to help you suceed. Really, there's so many different ways to get help from other students, from professors, tutors, and departments specifically orientated to help you suceed. But remember, it's up to you to seek it and it's up to you to decide what kind of student you want to be.  Like other's have said, this is definitely a career minded school. You will have lots of opportunities to meet with employers, go to career fairs, apply for jobs through the co-op office, and more. In a lot of fields, RIT is a big name because of their co-op program and what kind of employees they end up getting from RIT.  Of course, this is just my view and you're allowed to take it with a grain of salt if you want (others too)."

I haven't spent a single weekend on campus this semester yet, and, regardless of what I'm told, it hasn't affected grades, social life etc.    Gym culture is good, imo ( coming from a douchey gym back home ).  People are either the most pretentious people you'll ever meet, or chiller than the Rochester wind.  I personally think there are much more of the latter than the former; however, the former, depending on your major, could be quite loud ( i.e. you 'hear' them the most ).  I would come visit, think about your choices, and also about your major.  I chose this school to essentially get a Co-op and get out.  It's an unpopular opinion, I should join clubs, etc.  But I'm overall happy, and RIT will help future me the most, imo.  edit:  If you have any more specific questions, I could answer those.

rit,2zfaxg,LilLady1995,0,Wed Mar 18 02:41:23 2015 UTC,"Sophomore here!  Financial aid situation depends on your background, but I strongly recommend emailing as soon as you have a problem and keeping every paper related to FA, no matter what college really.  If you go full 18 credits every semester, you should be able to earn a BS in 4 years. However classes vary, you might not get the ones you need, etc. so don't be surprised if it ends up being 5 years.  Employment prospects depend on major, and I don't know about your program very well so I am not sure.  The general feeling on campus is really great, actually. There's going to be a culture shock though, no matter how much you prepare yourself. Especially if you've never met or seen deaf/hoh people before. It's pretty diverse though (at least to me, someone who comes from the midwest).  If you have other specific questions I'd be glad to answer them as well."

I've driven through dorm-side enough to know that most students blindly enter the crosswalks without even looking up to see if a car is coming.  This is not to say that the drivers aren't at fault here, but I almost hit a girl crossing one night because she straight-up ran from K-Lot into the crosswalk while staring down at her phone.  When it's dark outside, please be aware that other drivers are trying to keep their eyes on all parts of the road and may not realize you're off to one side and ready to cross as they pass by."

Admin parking and handicap parking should be considered enforced at all times, they seem to check at random. Reserved parking is checked from 5am-5pm on weekdays, and you need a reserved permit to park in them. They're fair game for everyone at all other times. General spaces are also checked from 5am-5pm, and you need a general permit for that (i.e. not dorms or on-campus apartments), but they're also fair game after 5pm."

I got tips because it is a social norm, not because I was some outstanding server.  Am I really entitled to ~15% of someone's bill because I hand them their food, and take their drinks?  Not at all.  I took away my tips and realized how little I truly got paid, and went and got a different job.  I haven't liked tips since the beginning.  Not biased, it's just ridiculous when I'm sitting there and see waiters / waitresses complaining that someone 'shorted them' on a tip or something.    And I see it other places too.  Like I said, it should be earned and not expected, and if you can't deal with your job becoming tipless, it's time to actually shop around and see what other jobs you can get, because there actually are plenty, just no one wants them because you still want to enjoy your college, you're so busy, etc, etc.  If you wanted a higher paying job, you'd make the sacrifice, but as it stands, you content with relying on your two jobs and the generosity of people."

I along with many around me commented that we tried to upgrade from GA and were told the chairbacks were sold out.  While being able to say you sold every ticket is cool and all, having a bunch of empty seats for the whole game is not. I think that game was televised outside of Rochester too."
rit,2z70rd,GCCISAlum,7,Mon Mar 16 10:51:10 2015 UTC,"It's extremely rare that the ushers check your tickets so you could just act like you belong and go sit in those empty sections. Obviously move if the real owners show, but otherwise you're doing no harm and making the place look more full.  As a related side note, the ushers are completely awful at their jobs."
rit,2z70rd,cyanwinters,3,Mon Mar 16 12:59:54 2015 UTC,"I am aware the ushers rarely check tickets, that's not the point here. I was willing to pay more for a reserved chairback ticket. It is a small difference in price, but that extra revenue may allow them to keep ticket prices flat or purchase improvements. I am more than willing to support both of those causes with a few extra bucks from my pocket.  FreezeFest was the only weekend where chairbacks were sold out, and the only reason they were sold out is due to the corporate purchase. I believe those tickets were offered to students for free, and still went unused. I have no problem with a corporation doing this, but the unused tickets should be returned/refunded the morning of the game to open those seats for people that want to purchase them at the gate."
rit,2z70rd,GCCISAlum,3,Mon Mar 16 13:18:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah they are. I had to kick people out of my seats to Friday's game. The kids got up and moved down to another row, then when the people who had those seats showed up the usher told them they needed to go to their seats, and he watched them just move down to another empty row...  Which they again got kicked out of by people who bought those seats."
rit,2z70rd,Knoxie_89,6,Mon Mar 16 14:33:37 2015 UTC,"Some other things we've repeatedly noted all season:   They never, ever stop people from entering the stairs during play, resulting in obstructed views. This is pretty basic ushering 101 for hockey. Most of them still have no idea where the sections/rows are. Watching them try and guide people to their seats is painful as they appear as lost as the ticket holders themselves. The cream of the crop: Last week they yelled at a friend and fellow season ticket holder for heckling the Air Force coach. He wasn't cursing or being remotely inappropriate, just yelling funny things at him from 13 rows up. Apparently heckling is not allowed ""because we're on the Air Force side"". Wat.   Complaints have been made to Guest Services multiple times, particularly about the first bullet, but no changes have been made. My only hope is some ushers read this comment and realize how much opportunity they have to improve..."

rit,2z70rd,paperboat22,3,Mon Mar 16 14:25:10 2015 UTC,"I think they'd sell out the arena for games if ticket prices were lower. Itd attract more of the general public, probably."
rit,2z70rd,Knoxie_89,3,Mon Mar 16 03:27:12 2015 UTC,"Maybe, it looks like the GA sections are already filled to capacity these last couple of weeks, so it's just the chairbacks that are available.  I'd like to see us host the league semifinals and championship here, that would probably sell out."
rit,2z70rd,Knoxie_89,6,Mon Mar 16 03:45:15 2015 UTC,"Blue cross is better venue for that, ton more seats, plus booze.  The GA is usually full, I was at Fridays game and had to kick people out of our six seats (chairbacks), they moved down two rows, them got kicked out of those when the other people showed up. And a handfuls of others had to move too. So my guess is that even the a majority of taken chairbacks aren't being paid for and people just move into them once the game starts/take their chances.   I don't see a reason for them to raise the ticket prices from what they were (at ritter).   edit: clarify which prices"

rit,2z70rd,Knoxie_89,3,Mon Mar 16 13:35:44 2015 UTC,"That is student pricing, if you read my whole comment...   Itd attract more of the general public, probably.   You'd realize i was talking about public attendance, which is where you're going to fill those seats.  $15 a seat for chairbacks to a college game seems a bit high for the general public.  That's $60 for a family of four, you could go see amerks play for that, you can get tickets as low as $12 a seat for them."

rit,2z70rd,lmg6841,2,Mon Mar 16 14:10:33 2015 UTC,You can get a ticket for literally a can of soup. How much cheaper can the tickets get?
rit,2z70rd,Knoxie_89,3,Mon Mar 16 14:41:27 2015 UTC,"Like i said ""GENERAL PUBLIC"" the general public does not have the ability to drop off a can of soup for a free ticket, and most general public will not want to stand/sit in GA with all the college kids. With all the ways for students to get into a game for cheap free they are already getting all the students who want to goto a game. If they want to sell out more they need to bring in the public."
rit,2z70rd,lmg6841,6,Mon Mar 16 14:44:27 2015 UTC,"Honestly, RIT should be pushing hard on student attendance. There's no reason an 18k student campus can't sell out a <5k seat arena at least a handful of times throughout the season.  To your point though, RIT has been a terrible team for 2.5 seasons. Thankfully they got their act together the second half of this season and actually have a respectable post season. Before that though, whose going to waste time driving to Henrietta to watch RIT lose to some school you've never heard of? Couple that with the fact that the games are televised, showing pretty much no one in the crowd (lack of atmosphere) and it's easy to see why people don't want to go.  I think if we make an NCAA appearance again we'll be back to nearly selling out all of our games. That's a big if though."
rit,2z70rd,JakersTheMind,5,Mon Mar 16 14:50:56 2015 UTC,"The reason we don't sell out the arena is because students don't want to pay more for the chairback seats, they want to sit with their friends in GA with their cheap/free tickets."
rit,2z70rd,lmg6841,2,Mon Mar 16 15:29:04 2015 UTC,"First of all, if the demand for hockey was there it wouldn't matter the cost or location of tickets. In 2009 through 2011 games would sell out consistently and people were still filing in to standing room to watch a good product. RIT really hasn't put a good product on the ice the last 2.5 seasons, so why bother?  Secondly, where you sat in the Ritter didn't really matter, just getting into the games was a feat in itself. What helped this was pretty much universal pricing for students. RIT should just make student tickets for everyone (except club) $7 and like $12 for non-student/faculty."
rit,2z70rd,JakersTheMind,3,Mon Mar 16 15:38:22 2015 UTC,"Right. I think we're agreeing on that - when the entire arena was GA, everyone was coming to the games. It also was definitely due to a more exciting team: Favot, Ringwald, etc were good players and I enjoyed those games.  I like the idea of your pricing scheme much better. I just can't see any students paying the $12 or whatever it is for the chairbacks when all the GA seats are less than half that price."
rit,2z70rd,paperboat22,2,Mon Mar 16 15:42:38 2015 UTC,Perhaps drop reserved seating to the $5 student price but only AFTER GA sells out. That way students will still be grouped together at the south end and there won't be any excuse not to go because of price.
rit,2z70rd,sabresfangirl21,1 point,Mon Mar 16 16:07:39 2015 UTC,They did that for the game on 1/31 - my boyfriend was coming to visit that I wanted to buy the seat next to my season seat and the girl at the box office told it was still $5. I mistakenly posted in another thread that I thought GA was sold out for the rest of the games but I think the girl just meant that was the new policy.

RIT really hasn't put a good product on the ice the last 2.5 seasons, so why bother?   You realize that RIT had more people in GPC than a Ritter sellout for all but 1 home game this season, right? How exactly are you trying to make the argument that attendance is bad?   Ritter sold out a lot, yes. Ritter was a very tiny building that was very easy to sellout. GPC is twice the size - not so easy to sell out. GPC also has more expensive tickets than Ritter because it has more and better features such as chairs, multiple bathrooms, more than 3 available foods for purchase, video boards, etc. You can't just build a state of the art new facility and keep charging the same price you charged for your 60 year old barebones arena."
rit,2z70rd,lmg6841,1 point,Mon Mar 16 19:09:46 2015 UTC,"Can you quote me saying that attendance was bad? I'm saying that the product has been bad, and that the atmosphere could be much better at the GPC.   Better results will bring people back into the seats, but artificially constraining the student population to the GA section based on pricing when the entire rink isn't selling out is flat out dumb. You're also not going to be able to convince me that a hit in ticket sales to fill seats is going to hurt RIT financially.   Raise the prices when you're consistently selling out the GPC. Until then, do all that you can to fill seats."
rit,2z70rd,cyanwinters,2,Mon Mar 16 20:43:19 2015 UTC,First of all I know enough from your trolling here and on USCHO that you don't even live in Rochester/Attend games at GPC so you cannot speak to the atmosphere.  And it's the first season in the new building after a bad season last year. RIT doesn't need to be selling out every game. GPC was built to be a building we could grow into. If we're selling out every game already then that would mean we built too small of a building in the first place.
rit,2z70rd,sabresfangirl21,2,Mon Mar 16 22:31:13 2015 UTC,you made this point about growing into the building somewhere else on reddit/uscho that i had honestly never thought it about that way and it makes so much sense that i use it to shutdown anyone who complains about the new arena #thanks
rit,2z70rd,lmg6841,1 point,Tue Mar 17 16:35:38 2015 UTC,Only half trolling. I've streamed the majority of the games and it seems a bit deflated with last weekend being an exception.   Calling the GPC a building to grow into implies that the demand for RIT hockey isn't balanced with the price point. That's pretty clear since we only went up a grand or so in attendance. Id rather RIT build an actual student following through marketing and comparative prices than hope for an NCAA run/conference change to attract Rochester families.
rit,2z70rd,ht5k,1 point,Mon Mar 16 22:45:57 2015 UTC,"I would argue that RIT is not a sports school.  You can only do so much to bring people that aren't interested out.  Year in and year out, the lacrosse team puts a good product out there. Year in and year out, they can't even till the turf field for free. Ditto for the women at the Ritter."
rit,2z70rd,lmg6841,1 point,Mon Mar 16 20:52:23 2015 UTC,"I see your point, and agree to an extent.   If Georgia Tech and Virginia Tech can exist as sports loving ""not-sports-school"" then RIT should be able to replicate that at some fraction. Western NY is a hockey hot bed, and we're the only D1 program in town. I just don't see why we can't capitalize on that and have a great all around sports experience."

You'll go through your work and at the end you'll get a chance to ask questions and maybe you can inquire as to whether they're hiring for the position you're looking for, what you can improve on in your portfolio, etc.  After all is said and done, please please please send thank you notes. It's nice for companies to see that you care enough to follow up. Maybe link your work in your signature so they have something as a reference to remember who you are.
