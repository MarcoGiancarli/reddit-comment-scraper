Frugal,3e2bl3,KaitlynnBree,69,Tue Jul 21 14:32:00 2015 UTC,"This is such a good point. Children learn with their senses, and the food being flat cuts out a lot of those senses. This was probably a really fun project, and a good bonding experience with their daughter. Unfortunately, it's only frugal in the short-term because the paper will rip, fade, get wet, etc. and ultimately you'll end up having to make the paper food again. The plastic kind will last a long time, can be bleached when they get carried away with pretend and stick the fake food in their mouth... some things are worth a slight investment.  Another frugal option if his daughter has the space for it is to use real, used food containers. He has to buy the real thing anyway, so it isn't extra cost except for tape, hot glue, and rice or dried beans. Old cereal box? Put some rice or dried beans in the box and tape it shut. Milk carton? Line the inside with white paper so it looks full and hot glue the lid on. They could use clay and paint it to make longer-term homemade foods. You can be creative and still make something that will be worth more than paper."

I'm sure making and playing these paper foods isn't the only mental stimulation she gets.  Besides, it's still a good exercise in learning and creativity despite being flat by letting the child cut the paper (feeling its texture), layer the different colors, and control the appearance and form of her own toys.   Unfortunately, it's only frugal in the short-term   Short-term isn't necessarily a bad thing.  It was fun and time well spent.   used food containers   Now these are some nifty ideas for future crafting activities, but I don't think they have to mean the colored paper activity was waste.  Maybe OP can combine them - let the child cut create food to put into the containers.  Old pizza box?  Make a pizza with whatever toppings she can imagine with the colored paper to go inside."
Frugal,3e2bl3,KaitlynnBree,5,Tue Jul 21 18:00:25 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's a waste at all. I made a point of saying that it was probably super fun and great bonding time. There's small muscle development with cutting, and dexterity and sensory benefits with the coloring and gluing. But the child is two, so because this actually looks like real food, I doubt she had a lot to do with the creation, and probably spent more time watching. I love that idea of combining the two activities, and using the containers for the paper food. They could still create and paint their own food with clay, which is a fun activity, creative, and more long-term than paper, with weight and shape to it. They could use the containers for that clay food as well. I work in a daycare with 2 year olds regularly, and it is so hard to get them to keep the play food out of their mouth! If I spoke negatively about how long the paper food might last, it's just because I've seen so many toddlers in action. I think this looked like a lot of fun, but it seems more like an enriching art activity than creating something a toddler will keep nice long-term. This is still /r/frugal, so I was just putting in my 2 cents about how it isn't long-term frugal. I know this is a super cheesy line, but I understand that memories are more important than money, and I still think this is a cute idea."

I'm also not convinced that this is the safest thing to give a child who is young enough to attempt to eat the carrot, as you mentioned in a comment. It looks like tape and glue were used in the construction process, both of which could render this a choking hazard.  If you'd like to make a different variety of frugal DIY play food, consider using felt squares (available at most craft and big-box stores for 10-15 cents per sheet) or clean scraps from old clothing, and sew or glue 3-d foods from the material. Stuff the food shapes with new batting ($8-$10 for a huge bag from the same stores), or use clean rags for extra frugality. There are quite a few patterns and tutorials online if you'd like to go the fabric/felt route, but for a crafty person such as yourself, you may not even need a pattern."

It seems like every time something is posted in this sub the comments are all about how the OP wasted more time than it would have cost, or something's are worth not being frugal over, or other wise criticizing the post. I think your post is adorable, I would have loved it if my parents had made a toy for me, even if it was just out of paper."
Frugal,3e2bl3,Asdfgasdfg11,4,Tue Jul 21 16:28:25 2015 UTC,"This sub is called frugal, not stupid. If you spend a lot of time saving $10, you ultimately lost money if you count how many dollars you can earn working for those hours.   I get that spending time bonding with your kid is valuable time -- but cutting shapes out of construction paper instead of buying the toys is not valuable time.   My mom tries to make me get up at 3am on Black Friday to wait in line outside of Best Buy to get these $5 off coupons. I always say no and remind her that if her, my dad, and I worked for 3 hours each, we'd make a lot more than $5.  The key to not being poor forever: realizing that your time is not free and refiguring your efforts to save money from that point.  Conversely, if my mom had spent 3 hours developing a skill, she could get a different kind of job and make more money that way."
Frugal,3e2bl3,ghuldorgrey,3,Tue Jul 21 16:39:54 2015 UTC,"Would all three of you really have been working instead? More likely you'd just be sleeping, so your mom saves $5 and has some fun, or you sleep and save nothing. There are always hours of the day you aren't working or learning something. You're spending time on Reddit right now, you could be learning a skill or working. If a person is enjoying the project and saving a little bit at the same time, that time isn't wasted any more than if they were watching TV or doing something else to relax."
Frugal,3e2bl3,mandym347,2,Tue Jul 21 18:27:56 2015 UTC,I get your point and agree but thats kinda a stupid argument to make: if you count how many dollars you can earn working for those hours - i dont know about you but its not easy or doable at all to just go and work somewhere for 3 hours to get money.

Frugal,3dzr3k,AnonymousBBQ,286,Mon Jul 20 21:11:56 2015 UTC,"Former AFLAC agent here. The only reason I'm 'former' rather than 'current' is because it turns out I'm great at servicing but bad at sales. AFLAC's policies are legit, and at a great price, but they have to be a good fit for you and your lifestyle to be a good value.  Basically, for any AFLAC policy, whether or not it's a good fit and a good value for you comes down to your lifestyle. For the accident policy, specifically, it's the best fit for people who work in an industry with a lot of physical activity or an element of risk (i.e., lots of driving), or who have hobbies/interests outside of work that can be accident prone. If you're covering kids on the policy in addition to yourself, it's a best value if they're extremely young (I handled quite a few claims with toddlers splitting their heads open on table edges) or if they're very active (in sports, etc.).   As for the fine print, did the agent give you a copy of the product brochure? All of the exclusions and conditions are listed in the brochure - they have to be, by law (in CA - in other states it still should be but YMMV). Unfortunately, I can't be of more assistance on that since I've been away from the company long enough that the conditions on the coverage will have changed and I'm not a good resource for what may or may not be covered.  The one thing that concerns me is that you felt the agent was dismissive of your concerns and questions. Agent guidance is critical for AFLAC claims - you should feel comfortable that your agent is going to walk you through the process and let you know if you're missing anything that might get your claim approved or get you additional benefits. If you feel like your agent is dismissive of your questions now, that's a warning sign she might not be very helpful if you have a claim, in which case I'd steer clear of purchasing coverage until you have a chance to work with a more helpful agent."
Frugal,3dzr3k,Amberwind2001,17,Mon Jul 20 23:17:27 2015 UTC,"This is exactly what I read in there paperwork and what the agent told me at my last job.

Never thought of it as a scam."

Frugal,3dzr3k,muricaa,4,Tue Jul 21 01:47:18 2015 UTC,"This is only for the money above the cost of insurance for the policy. Yes in a VUL policy funds are placed in mutual funds, but those are the clients funds.  The funds that go towards the cost of insurance are generally invested in bonds and options. This is where the insurance company makes their money- lost risk bonds that are evaluated by actuaries within the company. The options are where the real money is made though, the level of funding that goes into option investing is based on the level of return from the bonds. This is why renewal rates can be so bad with IUL or VUL/annuity policies because bonds can default and options can end up worthless. Doesn't happen a lot but it does happen  This information can be found in any publicly traded company's letter to investors/investors information page."

And the since I gave birth to him early I also couldn't get paid out because I ""couldn't prove"" I wasn't already pregnant prior to signing up. I got pregnant a month or two after and it could have easily been backed up by records from my doctor, if they would have allowed me to turn them in."
Frugal,3dzr3k,youngwarrenbuffet,59,Tue Jul 21 01:49:04 2015 UTC,My MIL had afflac policies and her husband was begging her to cancel them saying they didnt need them.  She found out she had leukemia a few weeks after renewing the policies and very substantial amount of medical bills were covered.  She is being paid disability by aflac while she's undergoing treatment as well.  I dont wish cancer on anyone but it has been a tremendous help for our family.
Frugal,3dzr3k,xpdx,20,Tue Jul 21 09:25:43 2015 UTC,"Well then I'm glad that worked for you! Unfortunately for me, I had cancer 2 years ago. I don't qualify for the cancer coverage (they require 5 years' remission). I do see the benefit there, but the other benefits (dental, vision, accident) seem like very little payout compared to the cost of the medical bills."
Frugal,3dzr3k,DarthElliot,29,Mon Jul 20 22:03:24 2015 UTC,"The thing is, AFLAC isn't supposed to cover everything. The best way to think of it is as 'gap' coverage - it fills the holes in your other policies. Such as, you've already got medical, but it's got a $5,000 deductible and you're in an accident - the Accident policy fills the 'gap' between what you have to pay out of pocket (deductible) and when your medical covers things. For the disability insurance, state disability only pays 2/3 of your gross income - AFLAC's disability coverage fills the 'gap' between what state disability pays and what your normal take-home pay would be."
Frugal,3dzr3k,DiscordianAgent,10,Mon Jul 20 22:05:55 2015 UTC,The nice part is if you have to go to the ER Aflac  covers your deductible which can be in the thousands plus all missed time from work. You never think you would need it until you actually do than your thankful you have it like most insurance
Frugal,3dzr3k,bob138235,24,Mon Jul 20 23:29:19 2015 UTC,"I got paid for having a bike accident. I got AFLAC and then got in to a wicked bike accident. I missed a month of work. I ended up making money on the deal after my AFLAC payment. I actually made more while I was out than I would have working- and that includes the hospital, doctor and rehab bills.   So no, not a scam. A gamble maybe but not a scam."
Frugal,3dzr3k,DiscordianAgent,21,Mon Jul 20 23:25:09 2015 UTC,"I worked for Aflac before so take this with a pinch of salt.  Aflac and most short term disability is for low/middle income working class people.  If you dont have much in savings, or have a hard time saving or cannot tolerate being out of work for even a couple days, than its worth having.  This is more important for physical/laborious jobs.  So take a look at your bank account and if you have your 3-6 months of savings than you probably dont need it.  I know its counter intuitive to buy insurance when things are tight, but thats often when you need it the most.  Aflac is great for expecting families.  This isnt for women who are already preggo, but BEFORE you get pregnant.  Pregnancy is considered a disability and you get paid out.  You have to pay the premiums the 9 months you're pregnant, but you get to collect a paycheck while you're out which is really nice.  Also, the sickness/illness insurances are usually not worth it.  Nor is the life insurance unless you're obese or have some other serious ailment.  There is no/simple underwriting, but the limit is low, maybe $50k.  Lastly when you look at the cost analysis, dont think of it as your cost (-) vs benefit (+).  Think cost (-) vs cost and likelihood of an accident (-)"
Frugal,3dzr3k,Bugsysservant,32,Mon Jul 20 23:15:30 2015 UTC,"I'm a CA insurance agent. The first question you might ask yourself is: could I take care of this out of pocket? We call that 'self insuring'.  Then consider this: if I keep money in a reasonably accessible (liquid) place in order to self insure, what kind of interest rate will I get on it? Banks and CD's interest rates don't beat inflation these days, so if your storing it in one of those places, you're losing money to inflation over time.   So this brings us to a final question: which is better, having insurance and investing the money you would have had to keep liquid to self insure, or just self insuring? In other words, if aflac wants $240 a year for some level of benefits, would you have made more than $240 parking an amount equal to those benefits in some kind of investment?  It depends on how at risk you feel, how good you are at finding investment options, and a lot of other factors."
Frugal,3dzr3k,bob138235,25,Mon Jul 20 23:14:15 2015 UTC,"Actuary (the people who do math behind insurance) here. This is the type of reasoning that is confusing yet nice sounding enough to get you sales, but not necessarily make the best decision for the customer.  Interest has little importance on whether or not self-insurance is right for someone. The key factors can be seen in the example below.   Let's say you are a construction worker who can only work when it doesn't rain. On a sunny day, you can make $200 in labor. On a rainy day, you make nothing. There is a 30% chance of rain on any given day. Now let's say I offer you a policy where I'll pay you $200 each time it rains. The expected benefit is now $200 * 30% = $60 per day. To cover my expenses and make a profit, I charge you $100 a day for this policy.   If you buy this policy, you will receive $200 in labor (if it doesn't rain) or $200 in insurance payout (if it does rain), pay $100 in premium for the policy, and bring home $100 per day to pay your bills. Every day. No worries if it rains or not, that no longer matters to you. You will live off $100 per day either way.   If you do not buy this policy, you will receive $200 in labor (if it does not rain), $0 in labor if it does, pay no premium, and thus keep all your wages. There is a 30% chance you will receive no money, and a 70% chance you will receive $200. The expected amount of money you receive each day is $200 * 70% = $140. However, is this necessarily better? Can you pay your bills if it rains for a week straight (the probability of that happening is likely higher than you think)? That is the real question. Is it worth that average of $40 per day to simply not worry about it?   How would your life be affected if you were forced to pay for whatever the insurance would cover? If your answer is ""little"" or ""not at all"" then self-insurance is probably the way to go. This is why people like Bill Gates wouldn't have these types of policies. However, if you were forced to miss work for a week and need that income to feed your kids, insurance is often worth it.   The numbers used in this policy were made up, but aren't random. Often, only 60% of the premium you pay actually goes to covering your expected payouts. The rest goes to paying people like me and the agents our parts, and all of those dang TV commercials.  *Edit: I don't work for AFLAC, but I do have an AFLAC policy because I believe it makes sense for me based on these reasons."
Frugal,3dzr3k,Blobwad,3,Mon Jul 20 22:42:27 2015 UTC,"Thank you for a thoughtful reply!  I'd like to point out that I do not know if OP should or should not buy a policy, and didn't make a recommendation on that point. Your comment about Bill Gates sums up why nicely; if OP is rich then his level of concern is not the same as someone who lives paycheck to paycheck.  I do think for someone of middle income, the interest does play into the thought process, but there are other factors to consider as well. As you pointed out, peace of mind has value, and the average person does not have much insight as to how likely various forms of ""rain"" are.   In general, I'd say save money in places where it will outpace inflation, and insure things you can't afford to replace or would be silly to keep the amount necessary to replace in liquid form, such are your house, your personal liability, your health and your income. As you save more in life, your need for some types of insurance should become less and less, but as you get older, your concern towards other costs like healthcare and long term care will increase."

They are simply collecting money from lots of people to cover expenses for just a few. They are not a scam in that they do pay you what they say they will pay you for any mishap you are covered for. If your income will be sorely missed in the event that an accident causes missed work then it is absolutely worth it, statistically you may never receive money but remember that peace of mind carries value as well.

With what I was earning I should have qualified for the weekly maximum allowed benefits from unemployment, but seeing as how AFLAC is pretax it isn't counted as actual income. So instead of getting max benefits I got $119 a week. We were okay since my wife works and we had some money saved but that's something they won't tell you and I honestly never even considered.

I guess I was just naive about it all. I could have asked about it when I signed up for it but I had no idea. AFLAC is taken out of your income pretax, so when you file taxes your taxable income will be significantly less depending on what options you pick with AFLAC. It makes sense that since it isn't taxable that it wouldn't be considered for other things, such as generated income to determine unemployment. It just something that they won't mention unless directly asked about. No one really thinks about getting let go until it happens."

Kind of like a spare tire you may never use.  AFLAC has many different flavors.  I know that when my mom fell and shattered her elbow, AFLAC provided extra cash for things that weren't covered by the health insurance and her short term disability.  It was definitely worth it for her. I was very glad when I had short term disability insurance (not AFLAC) when about 6 years ago I went to the hospital and ended up having my gall bladder taken out.  I also had mild pancreatitis.  I was out of work almost a month and was glad to have that 60% income.  I hadn't even worked at that place for a year and it was great to have that money to cover expenses.   Otherwise I would have had to use up what little vacation i had and then have no income. Insurance is always buying piece of mind so I always get the short term disability insurance and the long term.

I think it's worth it. That money really was a lifesaver for us. I mean, if you don't use insurance, it isn't worth it I guess, but that's not what insurance is for.

Because I had a preexisting condition for the first year I couldn't use it. Meaning I had to pay them every week for a full year to even have coverage. So of course I was done then, plus there are tons of other reasons.  So I told my employer I wanted to cancel. This became a huge mess with them telling me I couldn't. They can set it up pre tax or post, the agent told me nothing about this and she chose to put part of my plan one way and the other done the other way.

Frugal,3dzr3k,csr19us,2,Mon Jul 20 22:26:17 2015 UTC,I actually used to sell aflac a few years ago. Yah the sales pitch and the idea seems like it is the same ad all the others. The big difference is they actually pay. The accident policy is very good and I wish you could get the cancer because it is amazing as well. Their dental and vision is a lot more like any insurance you would get from a job. As a matter of fact their dental is better than what I can get through blue cross blue shield of Alabama. I am not a Greta salesman and the market was over saturated in my area but I really liked selling it because I didn't have to lie or use any distractions to make it a good product. It is an amazing product and an amazing company. In fact we were trained from day one to know our competitors and if we ever found someone with the old cancer policy from liberty mutual MAKE SURE THEY KEEP IT. It pays for everything and they can't not pay you. They pay their agents a lot of money to get people off of those policies.   Tldr:Aflac is amazing and will take care of you.

They literally sent us checks in the mail after my diagnosis. We got a few thousand which covered our  Deductible. It saved us. Her boss had her write up a summary of our experience for their website. I am thrilled with this coverage."
Frugal,3dzr3k,SnallTrippin,2,Tue Jul 21 00:51:48 2015 UTC,"It's been worth it, specifically for me, for our family to have it. We have family accident which will pay you back each year for your annual and ANY use of it for an ""accident"". I use it for my occasional chiropractor visits, any urgent care visits for the kid, etc.   We also have family cancer which we haven't had to use it, but cancer is in my family and it pays extremely well if you have to make a claim. Plus all the premiums you pay on cancer go into an account for you, and if diagnosed, you are paid back those premiums plus the policy benefits. So you're really banking those.   And then I have the hospital plan. I have an auto-immune and bleeding disorder. Its very likely that I will be hospitalized for some period of time every few years. It pays several thousand dollars at initial admittance and then so much per day of hospitilization.   So yeah, YMMV. If you are a relatively healthy person, who rarely gets sick or hurt, and has some significant savings for the rare chance you do, it may not be worth it for you. We mostly use the benefit payments to cover our deductibles and help off-set missed income for when I'm ill."

Frugal,3dzr3k,foodVSfood,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:39:25 2015 UTC,"First, to address concerns others have had, AFLAC actually has the lowest margins around for supplemental insurance.    Second, the whole supplemental insurance game is just that - a game.  So is all insurance, really.  If you never have to use it, it sucks.  That having been said, there are plans that you prioritize.  Obviously, medical.  Not only do you have to have it, it just makes sense.  On to supplemental:  1) life insurance.  If you have a family, have a mortgage, there's nothing better.  But supplemental insurance companies aren't the way to go if you can qualify for one of the life-insurance - only companies.  They'll be much cheaper.  If you don't qualify, though, supplemental insurance companies (well call them SIs for short) can be useful, since many don't require a medical exam.  But they're WAY more expensive.  2) short-term disability.  Another must-have.  Especially if you're the primary/only breadwinner in your house.  SIs offered through your employer will generally be cheaper, whatever company that is.  Plus, when offered through the employer, the standard for collecting disability is MUCH lower.  If you go with another company, you'll have to show a MUCH higher level of disability (eg, can't wipe your own ass) before you can collect.  Highly recommend getting this through work.  3) other plans.  It's all a betting game.  You money in betting that they'll pay you more than you pay them.  So try to outthink.  For example, I got the AFLAC plan that covers hospital stays for sickness or injury.  It just pays you based on how long you were in the hospital.  A family plan cost me about 10 buck per month.  It pays me 100 bucks per day that one of us is in the hospital.  In 4 years ($480 paid out), my wife has had 2 c-sections  (4 days each, plus about 3 days that each KID spent in the hospital) and I've had 2 stints in the hospital for kidney stones.  We've paid $480 but gotten back $2100).    But we're not planning on more kids, so now I kind of feel like I should end it.  But maybe I'll let it ride a bit longer.  But your family may be different.  Kids prone to accidents?  Get the accident plan.  You really could literally make money.  Lead a relatively safe life?  Don't get it.  History of cancer?  Get the cancer plans.  None?  Dont.  All insurance is just gambling.  Only you know your family situation.  Tl;Dr - insurance is based on chance: will you get in enough trouble to make back the money you've spent?  Everyone is different, but it's certainly not a scam.  Source: worked for Unum and Aflac; have Aflac.  PS - dental is NEVER worth it unless you have LOTS of problems that you can predict and plan ahead of time.  The yearly maximums as so incredibly low, you won't cover your own payouts if you go just one year without a dental problem."
Frugal,3dzr3k,OddSensation,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:49:16 2015 UTC,"My dental is free from my work. I argue it's worth it. Every other year I pay into the high cost plan in case of crowns, root canals, etc."
Frugal,3dzr3k,jefft1011,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:20:03 2015 UTC,"If I got it for free, I suppose that would be different.  But $60 per month and what do I get?  2 cleanings - $200 each (w/x rays).  So now I've paid in $720 and gotten back $400.  The yearly maximum is $1000 for the plan I used to have. In addition, it only covered 80% or any given procedure (60% for bigger procedures) up to the maximum.  That means that if I needed a root canal, I'd probably get the full $1000.  but I'd need a root canal every 3 years or so to keep it worth while.  Or I could try getting cavities.  But with a 20% coinsurance and at about $400 bucks per cavity, I'd need two cavities per year or I'd be losing money.  I just put the $60 in dental premiums into a money market each month.  I reinvest everything over $5k (arbitrary number I feel will cover my dental expenses if something pops up.  The only way it would be worth it, factoring in that there is a two year wait period for root canals and other major work, is if I had multiple teeth that I knew needed major work but that I could also space out and do one per year and also have the funds to cover everything over $1000.  Just not worth it, to me."
Frugal,3dzr3k,Scotch_game,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:50:51 2015 UTC,"I don't work with AFLAC specific, but a different company that has a similar accident policy. It is pretty basic,  you get hurt and you get x amount of dollars in return. as someone else said, this is most beneficial for people in higher risk areas, such as industrial or construction type jobs. Most of these plans ate called indemnity plasma, meaning you use your regular insurance for hospital uses and what not, but they pay you directly a set amount for things. For most office workers you will probably not get your monies worth, but again it is all up to a person's circumstances. for a relatively cheap price, you can be guaranteed money for injuries."

She was diagnosed with something fairly common, required routine surgery, and had a lot of complications from that surgery.  She ended up being on temporary disability and then permanent disability because of surgery complications.  AFLAC paid throughout the entire thing.  Now its years later and she is handicapped, had a fall and broke a bone.  AFLAC has paid out again."

I have a very white collar but enjoy weekend activities and occasional woodworking projects. A few months ago I ended up in the hospital after an accident with a saw. It paid me over 2500 because of the injury, then they add money for number of stitches (they pay by the total cm of stitches I believe), hospital stay is extra. I missed 1 day of work (pto) and got a check 1 week after submitting the paperwork to AFLAC. Also, if you go in for a yearly checkup you get $60 so your total cost is less than 200 yearly."

For voluntary products like Aflac, they can definitely fill gaps in medical plans.  I am an insurance broker, and neither an indemnity policy like Aflac or Medical insurance can cover your whole need for income and savings while injured or sick.   Advice- get as much disability as you can. Use your group plan, and get a personal policy to try to get as close to 100 percent of your income as you can. Very few folks have the ability to soak a shot from getting injured and having to pay medical bills while not being able to earn income.  I also worked for Aflac for a short time. The best part I saw was that it gave people chances to flesh out their benefits as they saw fit.  Look at Colonial Life as well, they are their main competitor and have some areas where they excel compared to Aflac, especially group life insurance and disability."
Frugal,3dzr3k,kriegers-clone,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:02:08 2015 UTC,"Supplemental insurance can be quite helpful to some, and other people may never use it. It's one of those things that's a waste of money while you don't need it, and an absolute life-saver when you do. I don't know if Aflac is the best company...we have them now in my workplace but I'm currently courting a couple of others to see if there's a better value. So far it looks like other companies are better at all of the non-cancer plans but Aflac is still better at the cancer plan, and we have several employees with cancer plans so I haven't suggested a switch yet.  That being said, one thing to consider is that you are in effect paying less than the ""sticker"" price. If you're getting it through your work place, it may come out pre-tax (check with your HR), which means it's a better value right there by lowering your taxable income. Also, you get $60 back each year just for going to a doctor once, any doctor...annual wellness visit, dentist, etc. And annual wellness visits are free via the ACA. So basically if you are being offered a $20/month plan, it averages to $15/month (after wellness bonus) in pre-tax money.   To me that's worth the safety net. I bike a lot in the city and if I get hit and am in the hospital, I want to know I can pay my medical bills AND still run my household while not working. Or if I get otherwise very sick ... I have a high-deductible medical plan and Aflac can cover that instead of having to dip into my HSA. I think of it like, I pay for insurance on my house and I hope to never have to use that... supplemental insurance is the same but for my body I feel. Every year we renew I do consider stopping, because I hesitate like you, but I have elected to continue so far. It is just on the cusp of worth it."

For example they'll offer an employer a cheap disability policy, and while they're signing up employees they'll tack on a deal to add life insurance... maybe $10k benefit for an additional $10/month directly out of your paycheck.  I'm not saying that's evil, just how I understand their strategy to operate.  I would 1) get a quote from a few other companies 2) read and compare the contracts.

Frugal,3dzr3k,Tenanagins,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:00:44 2015 UTC,"I looked into coverage with them, and the coverage is specific. You have to buy a plethora of specific overages for different things if you want to be fully covered.  If your company offers short and long term disability coverage, that is probably a better deal for broader coverage.  That would cover auto accidents, cancer, critical care, and hospital confinement in one broad policy, instead of paying $20 a month for every single one.   Also, you should be covered from work accidents through worker's comp."

Presumably you are not a licensed health insurance agent?  If so, his offer is illegal. You can't pay someone who does not have an insurance licence for helping you make an insurance sale. Even offering to pay for a successful referral can be illegal, although it's more of a grey area, it gets into questions as to if the compensation is 'usual and customary'. If this was reported to your state insurance commissioner the agent could face disciplinary actions up to revocation of his licence, which means he would also loose his ability to be paid residuals on his previous sales, which can be a huge part of an agents income. This agent sounds like an idiot, good on you for not dealing with someone shady.  If his offer was a flat fee to speak to your employees or get their contact info, that'd be fine, that's just buying leads or speaking time, and is legal.  Source: CA insurance agent.

You should have health insurance.  IMO a catastrophic plan and a small emergency reserve are all that you need, but the government now decides what health insurance is acceptable.  My jobs have always provided this, so I really haven't given it too much thought.  ALL OTHER INSURANCE IS A RIPOFF.

If your only goal is to get out more than what you put in, then from that perspective all insurances are bad unless you PLAN to have an accident.  I don't buy insurance to get money out.  This should not be your purpose.  I hope I never have to make an auto, home, business, or life insurance claim.  I hope they just keep my premiums and I stay happy and healthy.  I get insurance so that  if I end up having an accident of some sort that I'll be ok financially.  In regards to insurers as companies, if all insurance companies were just breaking even than they would have no money to pay claims.  You want a company with a good credit rating to pay claims, but also reasonable premium rates.  If they pay their actuaries too much and the premiums are too high they will pay the price.

Frugal,3e37j1,Jancy52,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:33:15 2015 UTC,"Learn to cook from scratch and then build yourself a pantry using stock items every pantry should have - dehydrated veggies, beans, corn meal, flours, rice, canned soup, home canned foods/ fruits, and once you have a good pantry you can save money by not having to restock so frequently - good book for this is ""The Pantry Primer.""  You'll only stock your pantry with foods you actually will eat.    By using home stock from your own pantry instead of ready to use or  boxed meals you save a lot of money.     In time you add in herbs/spices/condiments and use them in your cooking.  Most people suck at grocery buying because they don't cook from scratch at home.  Learn good food ingredient substitutions and how to use them when learning how to cook - I don't ever buy regular milk anymore - I purchase condensed milk and make up a glass of  milk from it as needed by adding water. I use cream of tarter when I run out of eggs.   I substitute carob instead of using chocolate in cooking.  Also set up your grocery list according to your food menu you'll need to plan for ASAP otherwise you won't know what to get! Have a favorite food you can buy at a restaurant?   There are cooking sites that will teach you how to make that food!    I have an old Betty Crocker cookbook from the 50's that listed a standard items page for my pantry to purchase on a week to week basis and included Crisco - which nobody in my family uses anymore due to the fear of trans fats.    Find your elder female relatives and learn how to cook from scratch - my uncle actually taught me how o cook cheaper cuts of meat to get better results.    We now cook with peanut oil or olive oil, no vegetable oil or Crisco.  I was trained by my grandmother to reserve bacon grease to cook with and that is also considered forbidden nowadays.  I use the bacon grease now for my dogs - making them fried toast in the grease and they love it. I do love my bacon in the mornng chopped into bits for a morning omlet with peppers and cheese.

Frugal,3e37j1,matriarch87,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:35:24 2015 UTC,"Thats good you are no good at buying groceries, maybe you don't need to...I consider myself an expert in food frugality.  Some of what ill say won't apply to you or will be unavailable but its worth checking into because a lot of people haven't considered it.      I buy very little from the grocery store, going to the store at all is quite optional for us.  We utilize local farmers/ranchers for most of what we can't hunt or grow ourselves.    Most states have a wild game program you can get into if you are not a hunter.  There are a lot of hunters that are not interested in the meat and they give it away for free.  You can get on the list and a representative will call you when your meat has been harvested.  They are very organized and trustworthy outfits.  They match you to a hunter, the hunter delivers the carcass to the butcher and the butcher harvests it and packages it.    When its done the organization is notified and they call the person matched to the hunter and you get the meat.  The only cost associated is through the butchers labor.  In my state its called ""The Deer Exchange Program"".  My family hunts, sometimes we get more than what we need, so thats how im familiar with it.   Another way to get a hold of inexpensive meat is by contacting a dairy farmer.  When a cow is put down it's thrown in a pile and a dead truck comes along every month or so to pick up the carcasses.  Its just what they do.  If you contact one and talk to them about what you want its highly likely they wouldn't have an issue at all with giving you a call when they know they are going to put down a cow.  When you arrive they will give you the cow and you can deliver it to the butcher for processing.  Now you have an entire cow for only butcher cost.    Same thing goes for hogs.  If this isn't your style, pay attention the local radio shows and papers, often times someone will want to ""go halfsies"" with a cow or a hog.  They have somehow acquired one and don't want the whole thing.  Its almost always less expensive meat than the grocery store.  Local farmers are often unthought of when its comes to acquiring food.  They are very accommodating.  I get my milk from a dairy farmer, I take my 5 gal bucket out there and he takes me to the tank that Roberts hooks their truck onto and opens the spigot to give me the freshest milk on the planet.  Another supplies me with eggs, $1.00/dozen is all she asks if I collect them myself and use my own carton.  These people are generally some of the friendliest on earth and if the relationship is treated with some respect and give and take they are just tickled to serve individuals instead of always dealing in bulk.    This leads me to CoOps and gardening.  Do a search online for your local Food CoOp, sign up.  You pay a minimal amount for a huge variety of fresh produce and grain.  Often there is a weekly pick up site and you just go there to get your stuff.  Gardening is another option, you can grow a lot of your own produce even if you live in an urban area.  A lot of times the most urban areas have community gardens.  If you don't have one, you could start one.  The city donates a plot of land and you and community members share your own garden to eat from.    Hopefully some of that is helpful and can apply to your situation, this finally brings me to actually grocery shopping.  I rely heavily on the sales.  If I need something ill get the thing I need but then ill go through the aisles and just look for the good deals.  Not if I know I wont use it, but if its something that I think my family will like and save a few buck on it, we will try it.  Bonus if its something I know my family likes, then ill get a lot of it.    Some basics that will allow you to cook almost anything if you have meat (pork/beef/chicken/wild) and produce (tomato, onion, garlic, corn, carrot, spinach, squash, eggplant, peppers): milk, cheddar cheese, vinegar, flour, butter, rice/noodles, white wine, salt, pepper, paprika.  This stuff lets you make (a version) of just about anything."

If you're constantly being inconvenienced by issues on your daily driver, I can understand your frustration however.  You can definitely find reliable, safe, economic cars in the sub $10k range. Get a simple Japanese car (Honda Accord/Civic, Toyota Camry/Corolla) with a 4 banger. Do your ""due diligence"" before purchasing; research until you're sick of it.

Also the hybrids don't have some parts that typical cars do like a starter. The brakes are expected to last about 80000 miles. Oil changes 10000 miles. I was weary of them til I did the research.

No...  You're going down the road of cheap, not frugal. Replacing only the dead cells is not a long-term fix if the battery has seen 100k miles of use. The cells themselves are only good for a finite amount of discharge/charge cycles. The proper fix would be to replace the battery with either a brand new one or a refurbished one that had all the cells replaced. Otherwise you're going to keep having issues with said battery."

But for $3000, i ended up with a car whose condition i knew was in. As long as you can pick a car that doesn't appear to have pending problems like engine or transmission failure, this is a win.  Most people do not fully amortize a car at all and just buy a new one when they are bored with what they have, at a great financial loss to them.  I did buy a 1996 BMW 328is for $3600 once. The guy who owned it was quoted $3000 for repairs. I did the repairs with aftermarket parts in my garage for $500 and drove the car for 3 years. I actually made money on that car when i sold it."

I recommended Hertz to a friend and he went and picked up a Mustang. His mechanic did not recommend purchasing the vehicle as it had obviously been in an accident.

The best advice I've ever gotten on that sort of thing is to start a bidding war between a few different dealers. Get a quote from one, show it to a handful of others, and if they can beat it, show that one to the others, etc, until you get a best offer. They'll often be willing to sell you the car for little profit or even slightly at cost, as they get bonuses from the manufacturer for selling a certain amount of cars, as well as kickbacks for financing it, so they can lose money on the car itself but still make a profit overall. You can negotiate them waay below sticker price."

The truth about these cars is that aftermarket batteries are as good as... if not sometimes better than the originals due to advancements in battery technology. For the $2500 Honda Insight i recently bought, the battery is gonna cost me $1600 in the next year. That's still a damn cheap 60mpg car after the battery cost is sunk in.

I agree with so many of the people on here, find a good angle on a used car and pay cash. The $5000 range can get you a pretty good car.

It's approaching an age where it's going to need a lot of expensive repairs within the next two years- gear and shifting mechanism inspection (probable replacement, the shifting is starting to get a little sticky,) plus it needs an alignment and a new rotor and it just started making this noise like a tie-rod is acting up, and that's just in the 140,000 mile range. I'm pretty sure the next thing to go after that is going to be the clutch. It's not exactly great on gas, either- maybe 20mpg Once the engine is fixed. Probably 15, as it stands, now."

Frugal,3dyd37,4waves,36,Mon Jul 20 15:19:24 2015 UTC,"Raise the height of the bed and put storage under it. Loft beds and bunk beds are great for this. If you're handy with tools you can build your own frame which saves a lot. When I was in college I raised a regular bed frame with cinder blocks wrapped in old bath towels. All sorts of storage. If you do use a chest of drawers make it tall, they still take up the same floor space. If you have clothing to hang you can try the clothesline but it will start to sag. Maybe look into one of those dorm room style wardrobes with two drawers on the bottom and closet area on top. I'd say hit the thrift stores to see what's available and be flexible with your options.   As to the kiddie pool, we got one of the small inflatables for our little monster and it works great. You'll have to change the water fairly often cause it gets manky pretty quick.  Edit: words,letters, and punctuation"

Frugal,3dyd37,Skeeterboro,6,Mon Jul 20 16:39:37 2015 UTC,"Polo shirts are a buck or two at Goodwill. Less if you scout around other thrift stores. Not everybody wants to wear used clothes but for work I prefer something I can throw away if I need to. With your personal clothing the trick is to get quality stuff that can be worn interchangeably. Plain stuff without prints, even t-shirts. Khakis can be worn pretty much anywhere, just spend a little more so they don't wear out as soon. Oh and go get a good suit. If you buy off the rack have it tailored to fit. It's worth the expense to look sharp. I keep mine in a travel bag and have it pressed before wearing. I have 4 pairs of shoes. Business, boots, sneakers, and flip flops. Pretty sure space wise I could get every piece of clothing I own into a large suitcase."

Frugal,3dyd37,laidbackpk,5,Mon Jul 20 15:43:42 2015 UTC,I suppose that you might want to get a hanging wardrobe which can carry coats and shirts and slacks to prevent creases.

Frugal,3dyd37,laidbackpk,5,Mon Jul 20 16:42:51 2015 UTC,"Underbed storage is a must.  Even if you don't go with something like a captain's bed with drawers, you can just get a regular frame and boost it up, stick some plastic bins under there.  Container Store has some reasonably priced bins that have no wheels, which is nice because they are not very tall.  I didn't boost my bedframe and this works great for me; you could go taller or get 4 if you have your bed boosted.  My winter stuff fits under the bed very well, including my furry winter blanket and my snow boots.  EDIT: Also I used some vacuum space saver bags, I think those are worth it too.  You squeeze all the air out of them, or use a vacuum to suck the air out.  Really helps storing winter stuff.  I put nearly all my sweaters under the bed in one bin.  So I think using a dresser and folding your clothes is still the best way to store clothing.  Hanging everything up, not only is it ugly but you don't get to hang as much stuff in a small space compared to folding them.  This is because when you fold, you can vertically stack stuff (drawers), and they have a slim profile without a hanger.  However you still need to hang a few things, jackets especially, and things you don't want to wrinkle.    I got the Ikea Stolmen system, which is working amazingly.  My set up is, long drawer at the bottom (I can only fit the long drawer), which holds surprisingly wayyyyy more clothes than I assumed at first. It's pretty big and very deep.  It's raised a little off the floor so I can put my shoes underneath the dresser part.  Then there's the pole at the top, where I hang unfoldable items.  I also put some hooks on it to just drape some of my other clothes like jeans by their belt loop.  Above that I put the cubby/shelves, wherein I have some storage boxes filled with random crap.  It's been really effective.  I do use a step ladder to get to the upper shelves, so they are items I don't use too often.  Have been using this for over 1 year, it's really great."

Frugal,3dywby,jknielse,-1,Mon Jul 20 22:28:04 2015 UTC,"Complete guess here, but it's possible that the faster spinning really does use significantly more energy (although his reasoning sounds like BS). Within your clothes washer, the friction is going to be (very roughly) proportional the the square of the speed of the drum. With this in mind, doubling the speed of the drum would quadruple the energy costs. It wouldn't surprise me if the fast cycle really did end up costing you more, but really this is all so back-of-the-napkin that measuring the current draw of the washing machine would be the only sure way to know."

Frugal,3e00zy,elang88,10,Tue Jul 21 10:14:57 2015 UTC,You can improve your gas mileage by up to 3.3% by keeping your tires inflated to the proper pressure. Under-inflated tires can lower gas mileage by 0.3% for every 1 psi drop in pressure of all four tires. Properly inflated tires are safer and last longer.1  The proper tire pressure for your vehicle is usually found on a sticker in the driver's side door jamb or the glove box and in your owner's manual. Do not use the maximum pressure printed on the tire's sidewall.
Frugal,3e00zy,I-Am-Work,3,Mon Jul 20 22:46:30 2015 UTC,"This, as well as proper maintenance all around. Keep your air filters clean, your oil changed, your chassis lubed, bearings greased, etc and you will squeeze as much as possible out of your car. Also change your spark plugs and wires as often as you need to (usually sooner than the manual calls for) and make sure your timing and idle and everything are good to go. In other words... get a tune up."

The blower motor can stay on because it's negligible but the compressor eats up around 30hp from the engine and that has a big effect on economy.  Also, assuming you have an automatic, let off the gas when accelerating to make it shift into a higher gear.  Kinda pretend you're driving a manual and let off when you'd make a gear change.  Takes some getting used to.  Also, coast when you can and drive so you don't often have to use your brakes.  If you want to get really involved, you can gain a few MPG by speeding up, coasting in neutral, then putting it back in gear and going slowly back up the the original speed and repeating.  This is because the drivetrain slows the car when you get off the throttle but the engine doesn't take much gas to idle, as well as the fact that most engines are more efficient at slightly above cruising power."

If you are going down a very slight grade, your engine drag might actually prevent you from maintaining speed, so clutch in is best.  A obd2 plugin like a turbo gauge or scan gauge can help you figure this out for your driving conditions. It's the best learning tool.  I always downshift gradually from 5th to 3rd and coast to a light with the transmission clutched though.  On a reaaaaalllly long slight downgrade with a manual, shutting the engine off and re-engaging the engine by clutching it back in can be best sometimes.. just depends on the topography of where you live.

Frugal,3dw4pv,JasonDJ,11,Mon Jul 20 16:25:31 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure if they make natural gas ones (they probably do), but I'm not sure it's necessary either. If you're going to buy a proper hot tub they have tons of insulation and they use a 240v power supply which means they can heat up a lot faster too.  These soft tubs are a lot cheaper to purchase, but way more expensive to operate. So, you have to pick the right option for you."
Frugal,3dw4pv,bonestamp,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:26:26 2015 UTC,Even 110v ones that are well insulated don't cost much to run.
Frugal,3dw4pv,bazilbt,4,Mon Jul 20 14:59:35 2015 UTC,Or a simple light timer if you knew you wanted it on a couple hours before getting home
Frugal,3dw4pv,nahfoo,22,Mon Jul 20 17:27:00 2015 UTC,Do you have any idea how long it takes to heat one of these up? That's completely impractical
Frugal,3dw4pv,snotf,11,Mon Jul 20 05:56:14 2015 UTC,If you have it kick on say half the time or so (every other hour or whatever) I'm sure it wouldn't cool down too much in that time and you would only be using half the electricity plus the negligible amount the timer uses
Frugal,3dw4pv,nahfoo,5,Mon Jul 20 06:52:32 2015 UTC,"You might also be able to insulate it to reduce heat loss.  I assume it comes with a lid, but if the tub is inflatable, you have got to be losing tons of heat through the sides."
Frugal,3dw4pv,PM_me_your_homelab,3,Mon Jul 20 07:44:01 2015 UTC,"Not tons. Since it's inflatable the air inside acts as an insulator. Just like double paned glass. It'll still lose some heat, but I'd put money on it losing less than half what a standard non-insulated fiberglass tub would lose, all other factors being equal."
Frugal,3dw4pv,snarksneeze,2,Mon Jul 20 12:20:21 2015 UTC,"I don't think it works that way... in theory it should have a thermostat that controls the temperature, right? So say you want it at 100 degrees. When you leave it plugged in, it only turns on the heater when it drops to (say) 98 degrees, and only long enough to get it back up to temperature. If you have it on a timer switch it's going to cool down a lot more during the hour that's it's off, and then during the hour that it's on, it's going to be running the heater 100% of the time to get the water back up to temperature.   tl;dr; You can't just assume that providing it power for half as much time means it will use half as much power."
Frugal,3dw4pv,ductyl,2,Mon Jul 20 12:27:33 2015 UTC,More impractical then it running 24/7?
Frugal,3dw4pv,271828182,6,Mon Jul 20 21:03:45 2015 UTC,I wonder if the fact that it's filled with air makes it more inefficient. Traditional hot tubs are built with extremely insulating materials. An inflatable ones seems like the opposite of insulating.
Frugal,3dw4pv,my_cat_joe,11,Mon Jul 20 14:12:42 2015 UTC,Trapped air is an excellent insulator. Think about your double-glazed windows.
Frugal,3dw4pv,fiftyseven,12,Mon Jul 20 11:38:46 2015 UTC,"That's usually argon.  When the seals break, and the argon escapes the windows lose a lot of their efficiency."
Frugal,3dw4pv,dryfire,15,Mon Jul 20 11:52:25 2015 UTC,But that's because it's not practical to put insulation in a window.
Frugal,3dw4pv,ivan34,5,Mon Jul 20 13:22:57 2015 UTC,"Eh, not really. When you camp on an air mattress in the cold you realize you need some real material beneath you to trap in the heat."

I'll look into installing a timer, but I think that the unit requires you to turn it back on by hand after power is restored, so I am not sure if that will work."

Frugal,3dw4pv,Disturbedsleep,6,Mon Jul 20 14:15:13 2015 UTC,I have no idea about the inflatable ones but my parents have a hot tub attached to their pool and the compressor for the bubbles is completely separate from the heating system. You can't heat it without the bubbles (have to circulate the water I guess) but you can definitely run the bubbles without the heat. Little kids always ask for the bubbles :)

Frugal,3dw4pv,jk3us,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:19:02 2015 UTC,"Nope, I've got one. I turn it up to 98 in the winter, but down to about 90 in the summer. If you like shivering, it's possible to turn it down as low as 70 and still run the air jets. A real one is also not nearly as expensive to run as OP's - I would estimate about $30-40 per month, which given how often I use it (2-3 times a week), is worth the price to me. The big difference is insulation - the inside of the shell is covered in a couple inches of spray foam insulation, and it has a 5"" thick foam cover that goes on top when not in use."

We run ours in econo mode which only keeps the water above freezing instead of running all day. We just turn it on 2hrs before we want to use it and then put it back into econo mode when we're done. Also, you can put a heat blanket on top of the water when you get out to stop heat escape."

I don't know what model she has or how she has it hooked up,  but just wanted to give you a positive example. She's had it about two months.

Granted, it wasn't an inflatable one, but we used to to keep it at around 85 degrees fahranheit, and it would take about an hour to heat up to a desired temperature.  We used it all the time, and it only raised the electric bill maybe 50 bucks a month. Most of the time, it was less than that.  Before we figure out to do that, the bill would be around 200 bucks more a month."
Frugal,3dw4pv,s2514,3,Mon Jul 20 04:39:03 2015 UTC,"That seems a little extreme. The heater in it is 1300 watts. At $0.10 per kwh, $300 would work out to 3000 kwh of extra usage. For a 1300 watt heater that works out to 2307 hours or 96 days of straight use a month. Which seems a bit impossible...  At 1300 watts running 24x7 (which it won't do no matter how poorly insulated it is), it would use 936kwh (1300 x 24 hours x 30 days / 1000 w / kw). At $0.10 per kwh it would cost $93.60 a month max (and that's assuming the thermostat is broken or something so it's actually heating 24 hours a day). If it only ran 50% of the time to maintain temp then $46.80.   So at $300 either something else was going on, or you pay around $0.35 per kwh for electricity."

A 110V heater/pump will pull more amperage than a 220V. Ideally, you would hardwire the gazebo and run it underground, but that could come later.   It is a safety thing, though and if there was an electrical fire and the insurance found out your tub wasn't up to code that could nullify any payouts.

Given that I want to use it essentially until it freezes and would prefer to avoid refilling it in the spring, I am planning to just let it solidify over the winter. With the resulting expansion, I would be concerned about damaging any frame, but intuitively an inflatable should do just fine since it would flex/stretch. Would you trust the frame ones to freeze over?  It'll also be covered by at least two feet of snow over the course of the typical winter.

I'd be curious to hear you report back after a month and let us know how much your electric bill has raised.  Pretty much the more you spend on the tub, the more efficient it will be (to a point).   110 v isn't as efficient as 220, and it being an inflatable hot tub means its likely not insulated well, if at all.         That said, $500 for what you have is pretty nice. But, if its costing you an additional $150 a month (just a random number based on noting). it might not be ""frugal"" if you use it year round. For a rough reference, a normal hot tub using 220 power typically adds about $40-$60 a month to an electric bill. But can cost anywhere from $3k-$12k depending on size and features."

Multiply that by your local electric rate and that's the max you'd ever pay in extra electricity. In reality I would anticipate it being less than half of that during the summer, and a bit more than half of that in winter. It's all going to depend on how often the heater cycles on, which will depend on the set temperature of the hot tub and the ambient temperature outside."
Frugal,3dw4pv,DrJingles,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:29:43 2015 UTC,"TIL that you can use the wattage of an electric device to calculate the maximum amount you'll pay for electricity. Obvious, but I never thought of it that way."
Frugal,3dw4pv,MTGothmog,2,Mon Jul 20 17:31:04 2015 UTC,"Yup, it's easy. Utilities charge by the kilowatt-hour, which is 1000 watts for one hour. A 1300W appliance is 1.3kW, and running for one hour is 1.3kWh. There are 168 hours in a week so running this literally 24x7 at full power would use 218.4kWh.   Google says the average price for electricity in the US is 12 cents per kWh, leading to this 1300W load costing $26.21 per week to run, or just over $100/month.  Of course, it's not going to be running 24 hours a day. A well insulated hot tub (which inflatables aren't) only needs to run the pump and heater for a few hours a day to maintain temperature. Mine has a 6000W heater and a 2HP (1500W) pump. It runs two, two-hour filter cycles per day to filter itself and maintain temperature. That's a worst case of 30kWh per day (note that it doesn't require the full 4 hours of heat to keep warm) or 210kWh per week. That's a lot of power, but the insulation keeps it to about $30/month, or about 1/3 of the worst case usage.  If you were somehow running mine at full power every day, it would use 7.5kW * 168 = 1260kWh, or $151/week, $605/month. So the insulation on real hot tubs is actually pretty good."
Frugal,3dw4pv,DrJingles,12,Mon Jul 20 21:53:16 2015 UTC,"What brand is your spa? I can't quite read the lettering in the photo. I ask because I purchased something similar, only to find out they were recalled in my country (Australia) due to risk of death by electrocution from faulty wiring. The brand I purchased was M-Spa, however they were sold under a dozen different names by the Chinese manufacturer. Please look out for recall notices if relevant in your country."
Frugal,3dw4pv,photolouis,5,Mon Jul 20 21:50:57 2015 UTC,Intex. You see that brand of pool at Wal-mart as well.
Frugal,3dw4pv,cadillacs,7,Mon Jul 20 21:59:03 2015 UTC,Intex is a market leader in inflatable technology.  I highly recommend their river rat tubes.
Frugal,3dw4pv,LAfailure,2,Mon Jul 20 22:10:35 2015 UTC,The river run ones have been selling like crazy where I work. Think we have moved over a thousand in like 3 months or so. We have some sort of bizarre tubing tourist industry here though.
Frugal,3dw4pv,chadcf,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:39:23 2015 UTC,Are those the ones with the mesh bottom? I prefer the open hole so you  can really feel the river as you float.

I learned how to do all the repairs myself watching YouTube videos and forums. Parts are cheap. I also make money on the side repairing them occasionally.   And please get rid of that canopy.  Watching the stars and hot tubbing while raining/snowing is the best."
Frugal,3dw4pv,Put_It_All_On_Blck,11,Mon Jul 20 21:29:07 2015 UTC,"We are leasing, so we don't have the option of an actual spa. Also, the location of this spa is under a lot of shade, so you can't really see the stars much anyhow. The canopy is there to keep the leaves out of the hot tub area as much as possible."
Frugal,3dw4pv,StumpBeefknob,6,Mon Jul 20 02:26:38 2015 UTC,Craigslist   Totally agree! I've seen at least 5 hot tubs being posted for free on San Diego's site every week. Most need minor fixes or have no issues. I guess it depends on where you live.
Frugal,3dw4pv,rustymiller,2,Mon Jul 20 02:32:12 2015 UTC,"I see them all the time too but usually the ads are ridiculous, along the lines of:  ""Hot tub, never tried to use it, just came with the house and I want it gone. I don't know if it works or not so don't ask. I want $250."""

Frugal,3dw4pv,MrFirmHandshake,10,Mon Jul 20 03:57:08 2015 UTC,As a commercial pool and spa operator I am very skeptical  of this.  It looks awesome but please make sure  you are keeping your chemistry balanced properly.
Frugal,3dw4pv,kimwim42,8,Mon Jul 20 04:06:45 2015 UTC,"Yep. My parents owned a fitness center when I was in my teens, so I am already acquainted with the maintenance required for a spa."

Frugal,3dw4pv,msabre7,7,Mon Jul 20 02:02:54 2015 UTC,"Yep. 104. The bubbles can make the temp drop a couple of degrees within 10 mins or so, but you don't have to run the bubble all the time. We run it for about 10 mins, then turn them off. It doesn't drop any more than a degree or two over an hour with the bubbles turned off."
Frugal,3dw4pv,dirtydee000thedi,2,Mon Jul 20 14:31:28 2015 UTC,Nice!
Frugal,3dw4pv,indigoreality,4,Mon Jul 20 07:00:14 2015 UTC,You can add frugal solar heater. Get some corrugated metal roofing painted black with a pipe with holes over each channel and some rain gutter at the bottom. Slope it towards the sun have a valve on  the pump outlet divert some water into the supply tube and drain down to the gutter and into the tub. Cover with glass or clear plastic corrugated roofing spaced a few inches above the lower black roofing section. Some foam insulation under the black roofing can stiffen it and improve performance. Should cost under $100. You get the energy of a 1000 Watt Heater every square yard of sunlight.
Frugal,3dw4pv,IFilterYourInternets,4,Mon Jul 20 05:23:49 2015 UTC,It looks better than the horse trough we had adjacent to pur bonfire pit we had in college

Frugal,3dw4pv,8237489237,3,Mon Jul 20 03:22:04 2015 UTC,"Wish I had one on my phone, one of my old roommates might. It was just a big 6 foot circle of rocks forming the bonfire pit with an oval shaped horse trough about 7 or 8 feet from it.

Frugal,3dw4pv,GlitterAndShit,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:21:17 2015 UTC,Sounds like fun. Like something I'd do had I the right property.  good times.
Frugal,3dw4pv,altiuscitiusfortius,10,Mon Jul 20 14:19:16 2015 UTC,"This strikes me as borderline cheap, not frugal.  In my mind, if you are ready to make a commitment for something like this, you have to think about the most cost effective solution for the longest period of time.  I just don't think the life on an inflatable is going to be very good, nor do I think the long-term maintenance cost of one over a solid, insulated tub, is going to be in any measure frugal.  IMHO, the most frugal hot tub is a in-ground wooden soaker tub you build yourself, heated by a either a wood-fired water heater or a submersible wood stove.  Costs ~$1000 up front, should last you your whole life if you maintain it well."
Frugal,3dw4pv,Cyfun06,11,Mon Jul 20 03:21:42 2015 UTC,"Well when you lease, that's not really an option. It's as frugal as can be given the situation."
Frugal,3dw4pv,s2514,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:00:44 2015 UTC,Do you know how the cost compares in terms of energy cost? Like how much money would you spend if you used this once a day for an hour over a month? How often would you have to add wood?
Frugal,3dw4pv,skiattle,1 point,Mon Jul 20 09:39:12 2015 UTC,Or build a wood fire based water heating system for this tub. Me and a few friends almost built something similar to heat truck bed hot tub.
Frugal,3dw4pv,loki7714,1 point,Mon Jul 20 08:30:23 2015 UTC,There is always this.
Frugal,3dw4pv,dominoconsultant,3,Mon Jul 20 15:32:07 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind this probably doesn't meet electrical code. An extension cord isn't meant to be a permanent power drop and you mention you are leaving it on 24/7. If a fire were to happen, I doubt insurance would be ok with your setup."
Frugal,3dw4pv,Swine70,3,Mon Jul 20 15:45:06 2015 UTC,"For anyone who is cheap and handy, you can usually pick up someones broken hot tub practically free and repair it yourself for less than buying an inflatable one. Many people have dead hot tubs in their backyard who just want it moved."
Frugal,3dw4pv,safeness,3,Mon Jul 20 15:51:07 2015 UTC,I had no idea inflatable hot tubs were a thing either. Also I love that stone stage you set up!
Frugal,3dw4pv,Solaterre,2,Mon Jul 20 17:42:36 2015 UTC,I have the exact same hot tub.  Buy a killawatt to measure power usage.  Buy the thickest highest rated foam from home Depot and place it underneath.  The floor is where the majority of heat loss is since there's no air insulation.
Frugal,3dw4pv,cosmic_butter_cpu,2,Mon Jul 20 06:23:06 2015 UTC,Great suggestions. Thanks!
Frugal,3dw4pv,Fruhmann,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:25:25 2015 UTC,I was guessing the floor was not insulated and that is why the electric cost was so high.  Glad to see your comment.
Frugal,3dw4pv,moetzen,3,Mon Jul 20 06:54:32 2015 UTC,Very nice. I've also seen people simply put a classy clawfoot tub outside. For two or less that could be nice. Plus no chlorine since you can just drain it.
Frugal,3e0d42,Zurevu,3,Mon Jul 20 23:59:27 2015 UTC,"I used to manage a CVS and their prescription prices are outrageous. They consistently rank as the highest, or one of the highest chains in terms of price. Costco is great on prices, and you don't need a membership to use the pharmacy. As for online options, do you have insurance? If so, I am sure they can direct you towards a mail order pharmacy that is covered under your plan. If you do not have insurance, I don't think anyplace is going to be cheaper than Costco."
Frugal,3e0d42,bigblacksquirrel,0,Tue Jul 21 00:19:12 2015 UTC,Not an online store but Goodrx.com saved me alot of money. Just print the coupon and give it to your pharmacist when you drop of your prescription.
Frugal,3e0d42,blacksrule,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:40:27 2015 UTC,It's definitely NOT true for Walmart: for the same set of 4 generic prescriptions the online Walmart totalled twice as expensive as going to the Walmart store.
