AMA,3e35a2,catmyonlyfriend,18,Tue Jul 21 16:45:56 2015 UTC,"I'll try to explain it as best as I can. I've tried to keep the memories blocked out of my mind, but I can't really deal anymore with keeping it in.   Keep in mind, this guy went out and collected these insects. That's why they were always so handy. Just making that clear if there's any confusion.   Also when I was made to do things, I wouldn't be tied or anything like that. We lived in the middle of nowhere and he said he would make things worse if I tried escaping it.    He would keep bees in a container and every time we were about to have sex, we would start in a doggy position and he would start putting the bees on my back and he would just watch. He told me to tell him when they stung me, when they would, he would usually cum pretty quickly after that. Sometimes he would put them on my boobs and that was cool with me. I was pretty alarmed when he try to put them on my vagina. I didn't want bee stings down there since I'm pretty sensitive. He accepted it at first. After awhile he didn't care and started putting them down there anyways. I try to fight against it, but the more you fight, the more an insect feels threatened so the quicker and better chance they sting you.  He was pretty obsessed with the praying mantis in general. The creature is notorious  for being sadistic. It's not an extremely common thing to find praying mantises around here so we only did that about once or twice. He would put it on my vagina and let it crawl around. When it bit me it only bit me in the pubic area. This got him off a lot.  Centipedes were usually put on my face while we did missionary. Believe it or not this was one of the worst for me. He would not only torture me with them, but he would torture them WHILE they were on me. He would pull their legs of, or pull them apart, etc... I'm not mentally stable enough to discuss the spiders."

My friend comforted me and asked what was wrong. I didn't tell him what happened. I just said I needed to get out. He didn't question me. He drove me home, we packed up my stuff while my boyfriend was gone, and I left. Of course he tracked me down at my friends house.

Prison itself isn't that difficult, especially for somebody serving less than 5 years for non-violent offense - that means you'll be in a minimum security facility around other non-violent offenders, with all the rec time you could want, cable TV, work programs, early release programs, lots of library access, etc."

AMA,3dzxwt,RageAllDay,7,Tue Jul 21 13:14:03 2015 UTC,"A couple of advices :  Don't know about the book/library situation in your prison system, but try to read as much as possible, get books from the library, get them from your people outside.  It helped me forget for a short time that I was inside, imagining myself in the places depicted in books. And you educate yourself, and it looks good on your prisoner file.  Don't panic in any situations that may arise inside. Try and play with different possible scenarios in your head, so nothing can be a 100 % surprise for you. Panic brings mistakes.  Don't give too much personal info and details to others, not even to your cell mates.  Avoid fights, nothing worse than catching new cases while you're inside. The judges will fuck you on those.  That being said, there are times in a man's life when you just need to stab a guy in his eye. If that time comes, don't be a bitch and accept the consequences.   If you find out early what your prison will be, try to make connections before you arrive there. Search for people you or your friends know, so they can reccommend you. If you have the right guys on your side, you should be comfortable inside.  If you still want to do shady stuff after you get out, be very careful of the ideas and plans the other cons talk about. But sometimes you make good and lasting connections that will be very fruitful after release.  As for questions, I don't have any, just surprised of the very light sentence.  Good luck."

Good behavior will take off 2 months and the RDAP program takes 6 months off the sentence along with 6 month in a halfway house so that's basically a year off.   I've never had to get violent with anybody. Not that I'm scared to but it never made sense to me. My life has never been threatened. Most times of somebody ran off with money or anything I'd just charge it to the game and keep it moving. I don't have time to track somebody down and all that.

AMA,3e0ezx,coloradolibertarian,3,Tue Jul 21 00:14:45 2015 UTC,What's the work environment like?
AMA,3e0ezx,bobwhite4ever,8,Tue Jul 21 00:31:14 2015 UTC,"Our warehouse is highly secured.  No one is allowed in without authorization, we can see who is at the door before we let them in, and ever nook and cranny of the place is on camera.  Just like any other job in agriculture, we have manual work to do that's not exactly glamorous without the right passion.  So because of that our environment is mostly one of work hard/play hard.    Growers are divided up into teams with each team responsible for x amount of grow rooms.  It can get pretty competitive between the teams because we all want our rooms to be the best aesthetically (looks good for investors) and of course we want our rooms to have the highest yield .  Teamwork is essential and taken seriously and there's almost always plenty of work to be done.  My team has 4 growers and we are responsible for 5 rooms.  We are a flowering team which means we only deal with plants after they have reached the flowering phase of their growth.  Our company treats us so well that you really don't have an atmosphere like a lot of companies where people hate their jobs.  Coworkers hang out outside of work frequently and the company has several events for its employees. (Open tabs at bars, Free beer in the Park, etc.) The company is also working on a company softball team and is the main sponsor of a charity group.  I started out at the same warehouse as a Trimmer several months ago in the trimming department before receiving this promotion. I feel like trimmers have a different mentality all together as their job performance is individual based."
AMA,3e0ezx,DWOM,4,Tue Jul 21 00:58:56 2015 UTC,It's disheartening to hear that the focus is on appearance and yield. The field to supermarket model followed by most food producers is not suitable for a plant like cannabis. This is with regard to genetic potential and producing high quality drug cannabis.
AMA,3e0ezx,DWOM,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:32:25 2015 UTC,"Sorry for misunderstanding.  When I say appearance I'm not just referring to how the buds themselves look.  I'm also referring to maintaining an even, defoliated canopy.    You don't want your boss to come in and see rows of cannabis where the bud sites are all covered up by a thick layer of fan leaves.  We defoliate excess leaves that block light to budsites because the amount of light reaching the bud is directly related to the quality and density of that bud.  Opening up bushy areas of the canopy also helps to prevent the formation of powdered mil due.  If the canopy is not even, then budsites will actually end up blocking light to other budsites and may waste the plants energy supporting heavy nugs later in its development.  As far as genetics, we have many diverse strains that were bred and selected to clone from at the beginning of the company.  Theres actually a mother room where we maintain each strain to clone from in an emergency.  Each strain's behavior can vary but as long as we maintain a quality grow, the quality is going to be there.  So while the quality is important, strain and genetic selection is above my pay grade and is the responsibility of the grow manager/owners.  Our budtenders would know more but our THC focused strains all test well over 20-30% THC and our CBD strains test high as well."
AMA,3e0ezx,swagmister420,2,Tue Jul 21 13:09:38 2015 UTC,"I would dispute that any kind of defoliation is the right thing to do. They are the engine houses and you would only see losses in health, vigour and completion of cannabinoid pathways. Trichs i.e. bud sites are only directly influenced by UV spectrum UV-B I think in particular, which can ramp up the psycadelics. I would assume that growing indoors, you are not supplementing with UV due to worker safety. And as you have probably experienced cannabis does just fine completing pathways without it. And as far as I'm concerned that is driven by the fan leaves.  If I might make a suggestion to bend the leaf out of the way instead on a few trial plants and see what you think."
AMA,3e0ezx,lord1cyrus,3,Tue Jul 21 16:52:40 2015 UTC,"Many states want to see how Colorado is effected by the legalization of weed and consider it a ""sample"". Obvious positives are that people get to do what they want and generate tax revenue, but have you noticed any negatives to legal marijuana?"
AMA,3e0ezx,Sketchoslice,5,Tue Jul 21 04:03:30 2015 UTC,"I don't think there is a negative that could ever justify going to back the horrible system of prohibition, but here's some negatives that are occurring right now in Colorado that can be fixed.  -We grow organic cannabis, but many don't.  A chemical spray called Eagle 2020 used to kill powdered mildew has been banned for use because of its harmful effect on the end consumer.  Some of the companies have been caught using this crap but after a year of these companies getting away with selling it to customers.  Our regulatory system needs to be tighter when it comes to what we are spraying on a consumable.  Keep this type of thing in mind by the way if you live in a prohibition state.  -Security.  This will be fixed greatly if we can simply see national legalization.  Most of the criminals coming here to break into warehouses like ours or rob dispensaries are from out of state.  -Banking. Banks can't work with our companies right now. This ties back into security, but when I get paid I don't get a check.  I get 100% cash with a piece of paper showing my income tax deductions.  Our entire business runs on cash.  Legislation is in the works right now to correct this and create banks able to work with cannabis businesses.  -Energy and resources.  We use insane amounts of energy and insane amounts of water to grow these plants indoor at the scale we do.  We have to grow indoors because of security issues and because the law requires us too.  My company is constantly looking for ways to improve on our environmental footprint, but I do hope that down the road growing outdoors will be a reality for the sake of resources.  Other than that, even as a personal weed smoker myself, life is better in every single way from what we left back in South Carolina because of the legalization here.  Our warehouse has employed hundreds of contractors and still is on a regular basis due to all of the growth in this industry and that money goes right back into the economy."

I usually can get an ounce of some really top shelf stuff for about $100 or so when all of the discounts kick in.  Other than that you're not allowed to take anything home or anything like that because all of the plants must be tracked from seed to sale.  Plant trash can not be left on the floor and must be kept separate from regular trash for example.  Its not our company, its just Colorado State Law.

You could physically take this resin off the gloves too though and your scissors (if you're a trimmer).  I'm pretty sure this is technically illegal though but I'm sure it happens somewhere.  Trimmers will have more of a realistic build up of smokable resin because while I handle plants, I'm handling them live and they're handling the dried and cured finished product.  Stick your arm through a canopy in week 8 and you're arm is gonna get stickier than maple syrup but it doesn't really peel off to smoke."

AMA,3e0ezx,Gartenbaum,5,Tue Jul 21 03:20:22 2015 UTC,"Step #1.  He needs to get his Colorado Marijuana Enforcement Badge (MED).  https://www.colorado.gov/pacific/sites/default/files/DR%208525e%20Support%20Appl%2002202015.pdf That is the link to the application.  He needs to print that out and bring the completed forms to 455 Sherman Street, Suite 390 Denver, CO 80203 with a check/money order of $150.  Its the Colorado Government office that issues people a license to work anywhere in the cannabis industry.  So it doesn't matter if you are a bud tender, security officer, secretary, trimmer, or grower you need this badge to work any job in the cannabis industry.  It expires every 2 years and involves a criminal back ground check and a finance check.  Then once you have a badge, look at the craigslist job sections in the area where you leave and search ""MED Badge"" and apply for any of these jobs as you would any other.  A lot of grower job listings require experience, don't worry about that.  Find a job as Trimmer instead to get your foot in the door.  That's all I did, I had 4 job offers in Denver and I didn't know anyone in the industry.  I was hired on the spot for the trim position despite having no experience.  As a trimmer, we worked with the grow staff helping with harvest days and it was there that I learned from a grower that they select their next growers from trim staff members that stay voluntarily after their trim duties are done to help with the grow.  That's what I did and within a month and a half one of the growers had to move back home to the midwest and I was offered the job.  Keep in mind though that being a grower is still an indoor agriculture career.  My coworkers are awesome, my company is awesome, but almost everything we do is still manual labor.  That being said though I love my job.  Its amazing to work with these plants.    One of the assets I know my company looks for in growers is the willingness to continue learning.  Commercial Cannabis growing is still very much an evolving industry so even the best growers are still learning.  Asking questions is a great way to catch their eye and that's how you learn your growing knowledge.  If the agriculture aspect doesn't sound appealing, there's so many other career paths in the cannabis industry.  Good luck and message me if you need any help!"

We have rooms dedicated to flowering (where I work) but the veg growers actually work in these converted shipping containers inside of the warehouse because their plants are smaller and require less room.  There's between 10-15 rooms with smaller rooms having maybe 90 plants and larger rooms having 130 plants.  Plants are grown on trays of 6-8 plants each usually to 1 light per tray.  Each plant has a tag issued by the Colorado government that tracks it until it is sold through a legal dispensary."

AMA,3dxxa1,ermagerdrerdert,3,Mon Jul 20 16:24:11 2015 UTC,"I took a call where a male was visiting his father on fathers day who was elderly. He had said to his son all morning (before his son had got to his house) that the neighbour next door was doing some very noisy work on the house and it had been going on all morning. When the son got there and sat in the front room with his father, he realised what he had been hearing wasn't the neighbour working, it was the neighbour banging repeatedly on the walls for help - he had fallen in the bath and had been there all morning. It was a godsend the son had gone to his fathers otherwise that poor neighbour wouldn't have been found.   Another call I've taken was a male with a knife who went on a rampage on a street. The location changed 3 times on the call to different house numbers on the street and I remember dispatch thinking I was making mistakes. But the male was attacking people at each address and then moving on. That was a crazy call."

It was a fairly lengthy process - about 3 months from applying until posting. It involved a 1 hour online test from home which tested spelling, judgement and decision making, speed and accuracy. Then there was a roleplay down at the offices with actors ringing in with fake calls to deal with. Then there was a panel interview at police headquarters and finally a medical assessment (hearing, eyesight and drugs) and security vetting. On my training course, there were people as young as 19 with it being their first job, a lady who had been cabin crew for 15 years, a retired policeman, a travel agent and a sales person."

AMA,3dw6tc,aintgonnagothere,4,Mon Jul 20 01:35:46 2015 UTC,"Although it was frightening from start to finish -- I do recall one particular experience I had that had me absolutely frozen in fear. I had been visiting a cousin for a day in the midst of the revolution (which yes, was very dangerous to begin with) and while staying the night, we heard on the news that there were hours being burglarized and homeowners being killed in my exact town. Since each apartment there in Egypt had a balcony (literally every apartment) you could go out to see and hear what's going on on your street. There were very audible gun shots originating from down the street. A serious problem was that everyone in town (and Egypt as a hole) felt they can serve as defense by carrying weapons outside their home, so by looking off the balcony you had no actual way of telling who was a burglar and who was a neighbor -- everyone was carrying guns, machetes, and so forth. There was no police at all during this time at all in my town and if you had been spotted wearing a police uniform, you would've been savagely injured. The entirety of that night large objects ranging from furniture to stacks of bricks were put up behind the door to prevent entrance at night. All the men in the apartment stayed up all night in front of the main entrance behind the blockade as well with weapons to serve as extra protection. Although this degree of defense, it was seemingly impossible to convince yourself you were ""safe."""
AMA,3dw6tc,solkenum,4,Mon Jul 20 10:21:59 2015 UTC,"I was in Zamelek during the height of the revolution. One of the things that stuck with me the most was when the military began flying fighter jets over the city in a show of force. I was taking a nap around 1pm and was woken up by what sounded like a garbage truck right outside my window, but I was on the 4th floor with a window only to the interior of the building. There were a couple of planes making runs over the city at high speed. It was like an impromptu airshow, but you didn't now whether they were just rallying support or saying 'oh, hey, we've got fighter jets, so don't fuck with us.' Pretty scary, especially on top of the tension already there from all the rest that was going on.   I went down to Tahrir Square to take pictures once. The most striking thing was seeing tanks parked in the middle of the street in front of where my university was. Its like, one day its a normal place and the next there are tanks parked on the street breaking the asphalt beneath and hundreds of people milling about protesting.   The doorman to my building had a broom handle with a meat cleaver attached to the end of it. He looked like something out of dynasty warriors. Groups of teens/20somethings carried crates of glass coke bottles... filled with gasoline. Impromptu security forces made up of doormen and shop owners set up road blocks and checked cars passing by after curfew. I'm not exactly sure what they were looking for.  The scariest part though was when the cellphone's went dead. The internet had died earlier in the day and a friend was using dialup number from  the UK to give us updates. Then the cell networks stopped. I had to fish out an address book from years earlier to call up people's landlines, which fortunately worked. But we were isolated. Its hard to explain the feeing of being 'unplugged' from the world amid the chaos and confusion of the revolution."

Everyone raged out against any human seen in a police or army uniform. The police station in my town was broken into, robbed, and I do not know nor do I think I would enjoy knowing what could've possibly happened to all the men that were stationed in it during this. I remember in particular there was a night I went out during the midst of the revolution (nights were when most of the chaos occurred) and I distinctly remember seeing a large fire originating from the location of the police station. There were hundreds and hundreds of people roaming the streets with weapons. There was even a military tank savagely wrecked in the middle of the street which I saw again the next day in the daylight."

The physical characteristics that I find attractive are for guys: tall, somewhat slender, dark hair, and for girls: somewhat curvy, dark hair or red hair.

AMA,3e0v78,NinjaBaconCupcakes,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:13:45 2015 UTC,When did you first realize you were bisexual?
AMA,3e0v78,upprd,2,Tue Jul 21 04:24:52 2015 UTC,"There wasn't really an exact moment.  When I was about 5, I heard about gay people for the first time and proudly announced that I was one.  Then, I somehow ended up extremely homophobic until high school started (despite having a crush on an actress in middle school), although I was luckily too shy to say these opinions out loud.  I liked guys, so I was definitely straight.  In high school, I met actual gay people, and basically by the time I found out they were gay, we were already friends, so I couldn't hate them, and I ended up being totally cool with it, and also found out that bisexuality exists.  I had crushes on a few girls, but it wasn't until three years ago that I came out to myself, and two years ago that I came out to my friends.  I didn't mind my friends being gay/bi/queer/whatever, but it was harder to come to terms with when it was my own soul at stake (I'm a Christian.)  Eventually, after falling in love with a girl at school, I realised I couldn't change, and might as well just go with it, and a few months ago I asked her out and she said yes.  Unfortunately it didn't last, but that's life."

And even a lot of people within that community will accuse pansexuals of trying to be a ""special snowflake"" (thanks tumblr).

AMA,3dxi3a,H3l1o5,3,Mon Jul 20 10:30:10 2015 UTC,"Despite the reputation, I would have to say that the teachers were a little more lenient, that is humane. They would let you go to the bathroom without a hallpass, make jokes, talk to you after class, etc. This is the case if you don't cross their lines. If you did, they could always send you to the principal (because the school is relatively small) and get a good talking to, and even restrictions on what you can do after class time. So free time was generally cut first, along with supervised study if you didn't improve your behavior. Then if you break school rules (alcohol, cigarettes, disregard bedtimes/disrespect toward teachers etc.) or if you really keep pushing their buttons, earlier bedtimes were assigned, large restrictions on what you could do on the weekends (not go into town with your friends, not visit parents) and even so far as 10 hour supervision a day... If you got on their bad side, you would have a long ladder to climb.  The most messed up thing I can recall, was one kid who was so spoiled, he (at home) had servants doing everything for him, even his parts of his homework. So when he came to the school, he was irritated that he had to do his own laundry, stand in line for his food (he complained it tasted like crap. It was the best food I've ever eaten), clean up after himself, and also walk to class (???), which were sometimes separated by about 100 metres/yards or so. At one point even told his teacher once that he should do his homework for him.  Yet, this is what I have SEEN happen. I've heard of more things.  Edit: paragraphing"

The school is on the IB program which is, as I hear and know from experience, rigorous, and lots of work. Teachers usually came in from top universities, so their teaching is a total pleasure. Otherwise, Saturday mornings are dedicated to study, or some other extra-academic/curricular activity to keep you on your feet.   Comparing this to the public school where the teachers don't really care about the students, don't care what they do, how they end up psychologically, I think Beau Soleil is a better environment overall."

In terms of opportunities, I have a few connections of people who achieved CEO status (because they had enough money to start a company), but generally no new, professional opportunities.

AMA,3duad9,TheSuperChronics,10,Mon Jul 20 01:12:02 2015 UTC,"Most credible polls will screen for people who self-identify as Republicans or say they are likely to vote in the Republican primary.  Here's a recent poll showing that methodology  Of course, it's possible Democrats are en masse lying to pollsters about their party affinity to prop up a candidate they believe is inferior, but it's highly unlikely."
AMA,3duad9,DaBake,6,Sun Jul 19 20:59:36 2015 UTC,"Theories like the one you are debunking always rely on such a greater degree of coordination and sophistication meeting up with the random sampling of polling as to be not just practically but mathematically impossible. Nobody knows if they are going to get called in a poll. And as you say they are unlikely to call democratic likely voters since they compile their lists of people to call based on past registrations and votes. And if they did, the odds that they happen to have been tapped into some huge secret network of Democratic voters who have a plan to wait around at home to pose as Republican voters to throw off polls is just tiny and absurd. We can't run away from the reality that these poll results are an indictment of a huge swath of people who are both base and easily manipulated."
AMA,3duad9,turkeypants,4,Mon Jul 20 02:43:07 2015 UTC,"I am convinced that we are being trolled with Trump, and that the ultimate GOP frontrunner has yet to announce his bid. They are throwing all the crazy out there first in order to make whoever they end up going with seem more reasonable."
AMA,3duad9,Vic_tron,4,Mon Jul 20 00:26:46 2015 UTC,"Nope, it's just a gift. The gift of stupid. If anything he makes the rest of the Republican field look good because  they look normal and grown up next to him.   His success is an indictment of the right, or probably more likely of the bottom layer of the pyramid of this country irrespective of actual thought-out ideology. If there weren't a legion of ugly, petty, insular, birdbrained clods out there working hard to bring Idiocracy to fruition, he would have been dismissed instead of embraced. But instead he has been embraced and that tells you all you need to know about a large chunk of the electorate.   This guy is an absolute clown, a joke more painful than your dad's dinner table humor, and people are eating it up like he has any credibility whatsoever. The fact that he can get this kind of support strictly by being a ludicrous, cartoonosh jackass on tv is scary. I mean he doesn't have a snowball's chance in hell of being president because he's such a clown, but this level of support is just insane.   He'll bomb out soon enough if he hasn't already thanks to this McCain thing, but really that's not much worse than the other ridiculous shit he has said so I don't even know if that'll do it. But it can't and won't last ultimately and meanwhile the other candidates have some nice quiet time out of the spotlight to hone their game. Once he flames out, the cameras will settle on them in earnest.  Tldr - Trump isn't the story because Trump shouldn't work in theory. The fact that Trump does work means that the real story is the voters, who were already this dumb and small before Hillary came along with any supposed plots."
AMA,3duad9,turkeypants,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:37:21 2015 UTC,No.  Ots people who ahve actually watched his whole speeches and they realize the media is not representing trump at all accurately.  Once you spend some time liste ing to trump in full on youtube you quickly realoze he is far better than the other candidates with the possible exception of bernie sanders.

And 2, keeping his name in the news by being bombastic to promote his brand for the benefit of his various efforts. Like a lot of people in recent cycles he is using this presidential campaign process cynically as a publicity tour. Actual legitimate pundits and newsmen and journalists like your various George stephanopouloses and whatnot will give this clown lots of free airtime when they otherwise would not. There is no way in hell he cares about anything else in this sham campaign. This isn't one of those people who runs to influence the conversation in a given election.

""conservatives ,  yeah i said everyone"".  ""I'm prochoice""  Break up the big banks.(long discussion how big banks arent lending the money the government gave them for free and its holding back the economy)  ""Pay people enough that they have incentive to work .""  ""we shouldn't cut social security. We can make it work if we bring back the economy""  ""Wipe out Isis by taking away their oil.""  ""Jeb bush is owned by his donors as are all the other politicians. I have 8 billion dollars. I won't be swayed by lobbists."" Paraphrased shorter version of actual quotes  We have to fight cheap imports with tariffs. ""i'd call the president of Ford motor company who just announced a 2.5 billion dollar plant in Mexico instead of Tennessee and say 'fine, but we are slapping a 35% tax on everything you bring into the usa from there.'""  "" I put a tariff on cheap products from China as long as they keep manipulating their currency to make things artificially cheap. They put illegal tariffs on our goods . We should do the same"".  As long as mexico is sending us their prisoners over the border i would charge mexico $100,000 for each person that crosses. Mexico will pay to stop it because they make billions from us every year in trade.   Those are quote I heard him say when I took the time to watch his speeches and interviews on youtube from the past month or so .  If you think he is an idiot then you are the idiot.  He is bernie sanders  with strength and military toughness and experience negotiating who knows how to stop bad corrupt business practices while incentivizing new real business growth (and you can't have social programs without both)  Yeah it surprised me too.  Watch the pheonix speech.  His announcement.  The interview will bill oreilly (no seriously.)  And his interview with hannity (again seriously).  Then watch his old appaearances on david letterman. You'll see he is honest. His opinions havent changed. He isnt making this stuff up as he goes along. He is uncannily correct even back in the 80's when he talks about what will cause upcoming economic problems.  Its time to get over his hair and his bravado. He admits them both. So what? Do you want a shrinking violet for President? This guy is our best shot.  Hillary is owned by wall street lobbists and jeb is owned by saudi arabian lobbists. Bernie is great but he is half the package. Good domestic social policies but a complete unknown in  his ability to actually get things done and negotiate.  Take two or three hours to watch the videos i suggested and he will win you over too. Trump is the o ly person who has stepped up to the plate that won't just be a continuation of the long slow national death spiral. He is common sense and good humour combined with money and ability to take on the status quo and WIN - not just the election but actually win policy changes in Washington. (politicians will run to support him in legislation like flies to honey becuase politicians are weasals who areattracted to real leaders who take the heat for them while letting them stand on the podium and keep their jobs.)

Then in sixth grade I pulled a knife on a parent at a basketball game and that got me into special ed lol. The next 3 years I was in a special ed school with classrooms of like 7 kids to 4 adults!    I got out of the special school and two weeks later got locked up and spent a year in juvenile hall and rehab. Then came out and was part of the mainstream resource program at Palo Alto high!

AMA,3dvfqa,heather37marie,3,Sun Jul 19 22:09:57 2015 UTC,"We have over 200 chimpanzees so it's very hard to choose just one best friend. I definitely have my favorites, usually the quirky ones like me! The chimps certainly pick their favorites, too!  The chimps love anything sweet, so fruit is always a favorite. They get bananas, apples and oranges regularly but they especially love novel fruits like watermelon and nectarines. I've gotten A LOT of attitude from the chimps in the form of spitting, throwing, etc. Barbara is one of our sassiest residents and she lets you know who's boss by smashing any fruit/treats you hand her (and then usually eating them).  I love my job, but it doesn't come without challenges. Chimps are amazing because they are such an intelligent, socially complex, and frankly rambunctious species. Those qualities come with difficulties in a captive environment, but it is definitely worth it!"

AMA,3dwi9d,Silock99,1 point,Mon Jul 20 07:09:49 2015 UTC,Strangest thing anyone has tried to steal?   Strangest item you've seen sold there?  Worst customer story?
AMA,3dwi9d,Silock99,2,Mon Jul 20 15:59:39 2015 UTC,"Strangest thing anyone has tried to steal: we've had a lot of thefts over the last few years.  Recently we've discovered that we have lost multiple of thousands of dollars in meat.  Mostly beef products.  Once while I was working we had someone break into our tire centre and steal a truck full of cigarettes and tobacco products and got away with it because nobody bothered to check the alarm.  We had employees in the optical centre steal over 10,000,  needless to say they were fired.  We had an employee reusing the rebate checks from members and cashing them,  we had someone fill a suitcase with electronics and purchase the suitcase,  as well as a person fill a folding table with merchandise and try to buy it.  We Constantly have members eating food before buying it and leaving it throughout the store,  and once a man tried to steal diapers because he couldn't afford them,  that was a sad day.   Strangest item I've seen sold: uhm our items ar3nt necessarily strange..  But sometimes out placement isn't the best.  For example the condoms and lube and beside the baby diapers and wipes.  We do sell a lot of unique brands and food items.  Like tequila and jalapeño spice,  which is delicious,  and this granola called 'bare naked'  full of protein and yumminess.   Worst customer story: my worst experience with a customer would have to be when this very large Jamaican man (probably 6'3, 400 lbs)  got in my face screaming at me for being a rude,  incompetent racist because I couldn't give him 2 separate receipts (our policy forbids it unless they are business members) .  I stood my ground but I was crying inside...  I tried my best to explain that I just worked here and I had to follow the rules or I would get in shit with management but i ended up calling my manager over and she just gave him the two receipts like I was in the wrong.  Thanks for sticking up for your employees guys -_- but yeah it was a bad day for me. You get called a racist a lot with this job.  Especially at the entrance doors.  We have to see everyone's membership cards when they walk in and if they don't show they can't come in.  A lot of people play the race card to try to not show their cards."
AMA,3dwi9d,Javilomeli,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:46:34 2015 UTC,Why do they care if I show my card when I come in if I have to give them my card in order to check out with anything anyway? I never understood that.
AMA,3dwi9d,Javilomeli,2,Mon Jul 20 19:02:40 2015 UTC,"It's because only members can purchase items.  So if a person without a membership comes to the cash till and unloads a buggy full of items and doesn't have a card,  it's a hassle to have to load it back up and put it all away. When this happens s it holds up the line too and other people get annoyed. If they come in looking to sign up we can send them to do it beforehand so that everything is set to go at the cash till.  That and a lot of people try to use their friends cards etc and by showing it at the door it's more preventable."

You wouldn't believe the things that people can fall on. Even the slightest slope is enough to cause a tumble. I've been trained to pretty much make sure people don't hurt themselves.   And the main thing that differentiates us from a more modern theater is probably the lack of an elevator. Because we're a ""historical"" building, there is no way for us install one.

Taking up hobbies allows you to meet new people, and makes you a more interesting person.   There is always things like tinder, where everyone gets at least a few matches. I've never had a relationship with anyone from a hook up site, but the odd causal sex from it.   I'd also say taking up regular exercise does wonders for your mental and physical health, you'll feel better, you may lose so weight and then look better etc.   Keep your head up, mind open, and remain positive."

AMA,3drkib,the_delivererer,3,Sun Jul 19 15:57:27 2015 UTC,"How does it actually work? I've heard that for normal sighted people they make colours 'pop' more... basically by increasing saturation/contrast.   I imagine it works by making distinctions between shades more apparent, but surely there is no way it can make a person missing colour cones actually see that colour, right?   The impression I get is that for someone who can't differentiate one colour from another, the glasses just make them look more different and pronounced, rather than, say, actually letting someone colourblind see Red... is that about right? so its not that a person puts them on and magically sees blue for the first time, just that it makes blue (or what appears to be yellow to the colorblind person) look a different kind of yellow to actual yellow and they never truly see the colour blue.   Or am I way off and you actually see colours you couldnt even comprehend before, and its not just that things look different with the glasses but like totally alien?"
AMA,3drkib,the_delivererer,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:20:58 2015 UTC,"It doesn't cure colorblindness but it makes all the colors pop so it for me all the colors I couldn't see I can see more of now   I don't know how exactly the science of it works but it somehow it pulls off the crazy and I can see the colors now :D I do think you're right, it emphasises all colors I can see and makes them seem new but they're still not the colors a normal person could see!

AMA,3dr36m,chumtoadafuq,3,Sat Jul 18 18:33:13 2015 UTC,"Thank you!  The trip, all in all, including flights, has cost approximately $30,000 - we left July 16th 2014. This includes buying and renovating our van, which cost us approximately $9000. We stayed with family whilst we were renovating our van, and left in December 2014... for seven months on the road, that works out at about $38 per day, per person. I think. It might sound like a lot, but considering the number of kilometres we've driven (30,000) and the countries we've visited, Scandinavia, particularly, I don't think this is too bad. Our primary expense has been diesel - we wanted to drive to as many places as we could whilst my boyfriend's schengen was still valid, and we've free-camped nearly every night, shopped at supermarkets, enjoyed free activities etc. I think if you weren't planning on travelling as many miles as we have, living in a campervan is a really affordable way to explore Europe. You could cut our budget by two thirds, no problem.  Favourite memory? Hmm, that's difficult! We spent a day in Slovakia climbing waterfalls via a series of slippery metal ladders, which was a little scary but hugely enjoyable. Another, probably riding rented bicycles in Svalbard... I also just enjoy the normal, quiet, evenings, where we'd park up in the mountains, or by the beach, edit some photos, cook up something on our camping stove, close our curtains and feel like we were in some little exclusive van universe!"

Morocco was the cheapest, and pretty amazing, we ate sticky almond pastries, countless jars of Amlou, a paste made out of almonds and honey, tagines rich with turmeric and cumin. I really enjoyed going to supermarkets in different countries, it's an interesting insight into local life.  Some of our favourite food discoveries have been:    Pastel De Nata - a sweet little baked egg pastry in Portugal. Zacusca - a vegetable relish made out of aubergines and tomatoes found in several countries in eastern Europe. Nearly everything we ate in Torino, Italy - pear sorbets, faranata, a thin chickpea pancake, dense, melting chocolate cakes, artichokes. Norwegian blueberries - cheaper than anywhere else, for some reason.   I'm vegetarian, I also don't eat dairy - so I found eastern Europe a little difficult in some respects, a lot of the food there is very dairy heavy. Greece was absolutely fantastic, and perhaps my favourite, everywhere you'd find little shops, something like convenience stores, but instead of junk they'd sell fresh local vegetables, walnuts, herbs, and baked goods. We made sure to buy vegetables and fruit from local farm stalls on the side of the road, as often as possible.  ...Now I'm hungry!"

I did feel unsafe in a few of the major European cities, though. Our van was broken into parked next to the beach in Barcelona - after 20 minutes walking on the beach, we get back to our van to find the interior completely smashed up by a crow bar, our table destroyed, our monitor, not stolen, but destroyed, too, and a number of other things stolen, including lenses and camera gear. That was horrible, it felt violating to have had some thief inside what I considered my home, tearing things up and making a horrible mess.

AMA,3dsq34,jadealwayswins,2,Sun Jul 19 13:18:17 2015 UTC,"I think that especially where I live most of the kids hear about problems in the rest of the world, but they don't really take them seriously. Or don't understand the scale of the issue. Having lived in places where there is a lack of clean water, or very little water at all you start to comprehend how what you have isn't a normal thing. I think that gets lost in the US where we take things like gas, electricity and water for granted. It has definitely made me passionate about things like climate change, clean water, child labor issues etc. It also made me rethink working for money vs. working for a cause or something you are passionate about. What you have in the U.S. is still so much more even if you aren't wealthy."

AMA,3dsi44,settledownbigguy,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:00:22 2015 UTC,How many of your clients are actually injures vs just wanting quick cash?  Can you call them out if they were looking or you knew it was a quick scheme to get some case?
AMA,3dsi44,tryingforccie,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:55:45 2015 UTC,"In all of my cases the client has been actually injured in some way.  The extent of those injuries, and the cause of those injuries are what the disputes are over.   I have had only one client that I can say was not injured by the defendant in the case (that case settled low as soon as I found that out).  However, clients will often exaggerate their injuries.    The overwhelming majority of clients I see aren't looking to make money in a scammy sort of way.  Litigation is not ""quick cash.""  It is a long, expensive, and arduous process.  It's usually the case that there are medical bills that insurance isn't covering, has stopped covering, or will not continue to cover.  Or, even if the insurance is covering it, the co-pays are expensive.  Also, for many of my clients there is a lot of uncertainty surrounding whether their condition will get better or worse, and having some form of backup in case shit hits the fan is helpful.  Not to mention genuinely suffering as a result of the incident.   I can call them out.  I have fortunately not had a client lie to me about being injured.  I have had a client lie to me about her past medical history, which really hurt the case when I found out about it.  That call usually goes something like: ""hey, so, your case isn't looking good given X, Y, and Z.""  I will either drop the case entirely, refer it out to another attorney who might want it, or settle immediately if that happens."

I will say that my clients tell the truth more times than not, but the stories do evolve as the evidence comes out.  I wish clients would understand that we are going to get your records, we are going to get video if it exists, we are going to talk with every possible witness...if you're lying, I will find out - and your case will suffer.  There is really not as much room for frivolous lawsuits as people imagine - which is a great thing in my opinion.  Perhaps I have been spoiled, but I have been fortunate to work with clients that have legitimate injuries."

AMA,3dsi44,martinis00,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:57:15 2015 UTC,"I had always been a cerebral sort of person in high school and early college.  I read a ton of philosophy, and was a philosophy major.  I went to my political science professor in my senior year and asked him whether he thought I should pursue a PhD or a JD.  He told me that an advisor of his during his PhD program was also the advisor for that University's law students.  My professor told me a story of his advisor once telling him that the University trains the law students to be plumbers - they are trained to simply go out and fix problems that arise in society here and there.  That was to be juxtaposed to the PhD's who are able to fix things on a larger more structural level.  He told me this to dissuade me from the JD.  It had the opposite effect.  I wanted a practical skill that I could use to help people in need and who couldn't help themselves.  I wanted to be a plumber more than an armchair academic.  So I went to law school.  I cannot devote a substantial portion of my practice to pro bono work, but I certainly love doing it when I can.  So, yes, I often help people out for free when I can.  But time is precious when you're a litigator."

Do you prefer what Rockstar does and do more unique ip oe when they release a sequel it's a big thing coz it's every 5 years. Also what's your best video game to movie adaption?
AMA,3dsep5,Brok3nGun,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:52:45 2015 UTC,"Well it comes down to money first and foremost; as long as there is a market for say AC or CoD then people will make these games. The word ""franchise"" makes our ears perk up in publishing. I don't think its because everyone at a publisher is evil or anti-original thought, it really comes down to the organizations/shareholders demanding profit and execs wanting nice numbers to report. My personal opinion is that it is good. It keeps a large number of people with families employed with benefits. This is a complex questions as I believe it brings into question the problem with AAA gaming now and in the near future. Ask more if interested about this.   Rockstar is a massive (and I mean massive) company, could you expand more on what you mean by what they do? They are owned by Take-Two who have their hands in a lot of stuff. Rockstar has some of the biggest dev teams out there and it shows. I love the cartoons/tv shows on TVs in GTA5. That level of detail is awesome.   New IPs have huge risk associated with them. As a whole, new IPs are shunned as crack pot ideas of some random dude and don't really manifest any value to a publisher. I would recommend if doing a new IP and looking to go the publisher route then have a more defined way as to how investing with your team will breed long term success. We always talk about how smart the guys are at Dontnod Entertainment are for how they pushed a new IP ""Life is Strange"" to Square Enix. Its not impossible to have new IP out there, just if you are thinking that way then have more of a business mindset over a creative/game development mindset.   IMHO, all video game movie adapts are horrible. They are almost always subpar games that are rushed in order to meet the marketing cycle of the film studio."

AMA,3dq9tb,SailorTits,5,Sat Jul 18 14:58:15 2015 UTC,"You just said you were a carpenter and a software developer.   First of all, this isn't the 1970s and you are you aren't Donnie Brasco. Everyone knows everyone. Undercover police work is mostly made up of using confidential informants. Not officers putting on a fucking wig, growing a beard, assuming a false identify, and living amongst the gangs!!! You've watched too much tv!!!   People DO NOT BELIEVE THIS GUYS BULLSHIT!!!!!!!"
AMA,3dq9tb,NH4ClO4,-4,Sat Jul 18 15:49:26 2015 UTC,"No it isnt. This isn't undercover police what you are describing, but regular police work. Of course there are MANY departments that work like this. But a)confidential informants have nothing to do with making a case, since you can't use their statement b)nobody knows you when you become undercover. Because they choose you as soon as you graduate the academy in order to protect your purpose c)I've never put on a wig nor diaguise my appearance. That's just stupid."
AMA,3dq9tb,NH4ClO4,2,Sat Jul 18 16:03:40 2015 UTC,"Yes you can use informant statements when making a case. Obviously, I have no idea where you are pretending to be a cop from, so I can give you any insight into your state. But, every state sets their own guidelines in reference to informant testimony.  Example; in California a case can be made based off of informant information, and the identity of the informant only be revealed if the defendant can provide evidence that will exonerate him.

I also got on meds, and started to have more frequent moments of clarity where I could think things along the lines of, ""If these people can see me, then I must exist in the same plane as them.""

AMA,3dsppb,theBronxkid,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:33:35 2015 UTC,"Sometimes I can go a week like a normal person and sometimes during a stressful time I don't sleep for a week. I'll explain how it feels in days:  1/2 days no sleep: ""Great, homework here I come, my room needs to be vacuumed""  2/3 days no sleep: ""Alright, this better not go any longer"" At this point I am neutral, I don't care much it happens often   3/4 days no sleep: I try everything to sleep at this point, I shower, I don't use electronics at all, get comfy sheets that smell fresh, etc.  4/5 days no sleep: At this point I get very frustrated with my self. My body is always rigid and sometimes I just cry silently (apparently this is normal for people with insomnia). I get creative at this point draw some things, play guitar in the basement so my parents won't wake up.. you get the point. If I get very bad I call my best friend and he immediately comes over. Sometimes just reassuring arms can do wonders.   6+ days no sleep: This is very rare, I only once had a week of no sleep and it was the worst week of my life. I had no reason to be stressed at all, I had good days where I volunteered and did school but something just felt off. During this week I felt pain all over my body, sleeping pills had no effect on me, I felt week, weightlifting was very difficult. My friend ended up sleeping over by the third day and staying with me through this time so that was nice. The joy of finally falling asleep was glorious. I was so happy, I slept through all of Saturday. After that marathon of stress my friend and I went on a very long celebration bike ride."

AMA,3dob4q,OneEyedPetey,25,Sat Jul 18 00:21:00 2015 UTC,"I live on the west side. Pretty much don't dress and act like a thug, banger, dealer etc if you don't want to get messed with. The criminals usually know or know of the people that they want to beat, murder rob. Obviously that's not always the case but if you show no fear people don't fuck with you. I would say walk with confidence but also without arrogance."
AMA,3dob4q,Nankilslas,13,Sat Jul 18 00:39:52 2015 UTC,"I gotta say, we had a couple gangs move into my neighborhood in Virginia when I was growing up. And I was a tomboy and my best friends (other boys) joined. They started dealing if that was what was called for too. This started when I was in 6th grade. I hated seeing them try to intimidate other kids on the bus when they went to school and around the neighborhood. I was the only person who stood up to them. I walked people home if they wanted me to. I told the gang members I would report all illegal activities. I took pictures of everything. I did it blatantly. By the time I was old enough to drive my direct neighbor was dealing out of his house and was higher ranking and I would sit in a lawn chair in my front yard and write down license plates and ask everyone their names so I can turn them in with the pictures I took. They were stupid and tried to jump me while I was my car on my way home from work. They only had knives or at least that's all they were waving around. There were about 10 of them blocking the road demanding I get out of the vehicle because they'd been waiting for me. But I was in a car! I warned them I would run them over and started going. They didn't believe me. So I floored it and they dove out of the way. Antics like these kept up for about another year until most of them were arrested.   But I never showed them any fear. I am trying to teach this to my daughter who has a couple kids pick on her in school.  Confidence is a pretty decent armor."

This is going to be one of those shitty comments and I apologize for that, but I'm tired of being told I should be sorry for being white and oppressive when it seems like black on black crime is the worst part of these areas. No one is forcing people to do drive by shootings or sling drugs on the corner. There are community centers and the option to escape areas such as this but a lot of people are caught up in this thug life thinking its a cool thing to be (which the hip hop community seems to perpetuate) no one wants to assimilate with that culture because no one else things that kind of shit is cool. Then people get mad that areas like this get segregated. This is where the self perpetuation comes in.

It is far too easy to take a quick glance and blame the people living there for not fixing their own problem, when if you dig beneath the surface at all you realize the problems don't start with them, never started with them.   Spend a bit of time reading about this, if you're really curious about the subject. It's sad & fascinating. Even the routes of highways built from the 1950s onward were racially motivated at times.

Recently in the Chicago tribune there was An article where a 16 year old can be charged as a minor and get minimal time, but someone a few months older (17) can get life  Edit:  we also have Spike Lee filming some dumb movie along with other celebs, but have they don't anything to try and make it better?  And it seems to be a gang problem mostly, I don't know what the cops are supposed to do? I was for having the national guard patrol the streets, south side is a Zoo"

AMA,3dpuml,IvyGold,1 point,Sat Jul 18 08:17:31 2015 UTC,"I would say that I'm adapting relatively good. My family is integrating to the swedish society but we are not assimilating to all swedish customs and traditions as some of them are contradicting to my religious beliefs and core values.  As i mentioned before i live in a suburb and i went to a school in my suburb. It might sound weird to you but up until high school i didn't know any swedish people except my teachers. I hadn't talked to an ethnic swedish youth in my whole life.  But when i graduated from elementary school with pretty high grades my teacher and mentor told me to go a high school with like 80% swedes. And it was quite a big change in my life. I got new swedish friends (i was the only black guy in my class so i kinda became like Token i south park hehe)  Still i felt like an outsider in the school as i didn't have wealthy parents like the white kids in my school and i felt that we couldn't relate to each others lives. I developed almost two different personalities, one at school and one with my family and childhood friends.  Hehe yes I've learned skiing. Our principal in my elementary school was a rich somali man who used to let all the students in the last year go to the swedish mountains in northern sweden for free."

AMA,3dpuml,Neon-smurfen,2,Sat Jul 18 13:19:05 2015 UTC,I´m more of a republican as i believe that the royal family are not entitled to over 20 million dollars every year for basically doing nothing. Thats money that could go to better use. But still i understand that the monarchy has been part of our countrys history for so long.  I'm against gay marriages in countries governed by Islamic law. Here in Sweden I just don't care. Its just that it feels weird that homosexuals want to get married in a church which have a religious book that prohibits homosexual relations.  If Russia went to war with Sweden i would die to protect Sweden as that is my religious obligation. You have to protect your home from invaders. But still i look like an Somali even though i never have visited Somalia. I would say that i don't identify myself in nationalistic terms.

The fact that you never interacted with Swedish people during your youth is terrible, IMO. We need to do better to make sure there is more of an exchange between immigrants and the rest of society. My question to you is: do you agree that the current segregation is a problem? How do you think the Swedish government should work to improve cultural relations between established citizens and recent immigrants?"
AMA,3dpuml,9bloomia,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:31:10 2015 UTC,"I will take it on Swedish as i suppose that you're a swede.   Jag håller med dig om att dagens segregation i våra förorter till viss del är ett problem. Inte minst för att vi får ungdomar som är födda och uppväxta i Sverige men som trots det talar och skriver med väldigt dålig svenska.  Men samtidigt är det viktigt att poängtera att segregationen inte endast är till ondo. Om man inte är etablerad i ett nytt land så hjälper det så himla mycket att man har sina landsmän i samma område så de kan hjälpa en att komma in i det nya samhället. Det är här det brister tror jag.   Jag tror inte det löser problemen ifall man sprider ut invandrarna och deras barn till till andra kommuner runtom i landet. Istället så bör föräldrarna och även kommunerna se till att barnen till invandrare får börja i skolor där de träffar ""riktiga"" svenska barn.   Fast vad vet jag egentligen hehe, detta är bara vad jag tror personligen"

AMA,3dpuml,lawrnk,2,Sat Jul 18 21:29:45 2015 UTC,"I am not too sure about holidays, personally (I, myself, am the rare Minnesotan without any Scandinavian ancestry), but there are a lot of ways Minnesotans call back to their heritage. We have The American Swedish Institute which has history exhibits and culturally relevant theatre and art; and a Scandinavian market that not only sells Scandinavian stuff, but provides classes to help retain one's Swedish roots. Lefse and kransekake are pretty big in some households, and places like the Gammelgården Museum provide glimpses into the life of the early Swedish settlers in the area.  Mostly, though, you see Scandinavian influences in the disposition of the people here. Aside from many Minnesotans being from Lutheran families and having last names like Bloomquist or Bjornson, the Minnesotan temperament is rather reserved and stoic, but kind and charitable at the same time. I am even guilty of the Minnesota Nice - it's a regional thing I guess."

AMA,3dt6qo,KittyBrentwood,2,Sun Jul 19 05:57:02 2015 UTC,"First off, I do not use any mind-altering substances anymore and I haven't for almost a year now.  So I don't believe I am biased.  I am a strong advocate for marijuana, recreational and medicinal.  I don't believe it to be a gateway drug; the people that quote statistics showing that ""97% of heroin addicts started with cannabis"" are fucking morons.  Obviously someone interested in using drugs to make them feel okay about themselves is going to dip a toe in first to try it out.  I believe that real addiction comes before drug use.  Drugs are simply a surface solution (albeit a pretty damn good one) to a much deeper issue.  I personally was trying to solve my lack of emotional and spiritual well-being with marijuana and alcohol years before I dove into opiates.  They really never worked well for me, it was inevitable that I would have ended up where I'm at now.  Especially in my generation where drug use is as socially acceptable as sex.  I, like most other heroin addicts I know, started with pharmaceutical painkillers before using heroin.  I was prescribed Vicodin after a nasty head injury when I was ~ 16 and fell in love with the feeling.  From there I moved on to more frequent and higher dosages of all types; oxycodone, fentanyl, dilaudid.  I discovered that heroin is more effective at about 1/5th of the price, so the decision to switch to it was basic logistics more than anything.  I grew up in an upper-middle class family in a great neighborhood so I don't really have anything to blame it on."
AMA,3dt6qo,Rocha_999,1 point,Sun Jul 19 06:07:34 2015 UTC,Are you more addicted to the substance or the ritual of obtaining/ using rather than the high from the drug itself?
AMA,3dt6qo,Oldgregg18,1 point,Sun Jul 19 06:16:41 2015 UTC,"Great question.  I would say I am more addicted to the feeling of relief that I get from the high. it's like I'm being held underwater and when I get that fix I'm being let up to breathe.  BUT, toward the end, the ritual of obtaining money, then obtaining dope, then using was really the only thing I did.  It filled my days with purpose.  Now that I'm sober  I feel like I can't really just sit and relax for long periods of time.  If i have a day off and I just lay around in my underwear watching Netflix I get the urge to use.  I only allow myself a few hours of free time daily at the most now."

That's why I went straight into college with a full load once I was 2 years clean. Now, I'm in medicine and I could not think of a career doing anything else. I crave high stress, only now I'm able to direct this compulsive need towards the beneficial rather than detrimental.  Also, with the ritual aspect have you found a substitute?"

Ppl say meditation but, it's so difficult to sit still and think of NOTHING.  So, I color for one. NO joke. I break out the crayolas and color shit! They've got some great adult coloring books these days.  I get spa facials and foot massaged.

AMA,3dqkep,aspiradream,2,Sat Jul 18 16:34:22 2015 UTC,I take violin and piano lessons. But guitar is what I taught myself. When starting out just play along to songs you like. If you have a hard time going from chord to chord then while watching tv just go back from chord to chord mindlessly. It makes it more like muscle memory. When I started out anything to  C major seemed  difficult to me. I just watched television and did it back and forth.  Wish you were here by pink Floyd is pretty easy to do. The beginning guitar part that is then accompanied by the solo is a pleaser to play to people. Being younger with family members you're always hounded to play. Now im not bad but I'm also not a virtuoso yanno? So it's good to have a small repertoire is what I've learned so far.
AMA,3dnqjs,WannabeVSAngel,6,Fri Jul 17 19:36:16 2015 UTC,What is your disability and what does your dog do to help you? How do people usually react to the dog in public?
AMA,3dnqjs,pastaaaa,6,Fri Jul 17 19:46:25 2015 UTC,"I have had 2 known TBIs (Traumatic Brain Injuries) in my life that affect my ability to accurately perceive visual and auditory stimuli. While undergoing incorrect treatments for 5 years, I developed gastroparesis... which basically means that my intestines are frozen (likely from nerve damage). This means I have about a 90-95% liquid diet and that when I do eat food or soups, I take digestive enzymes. This wouldn't be so much of a problem, except I was diagnosed hypoglycemic when I was 7 years old (from passing out during church - our lunches were pushed back those days). So basically I'm always low on something and my Service Dog alerts me before I realize what is happening (dropping blood glucose), I get disoriented very easily, have some physical disabilities and thus my dog assists with some physical mobility assistance. Essentially, I can fall and he will (and can/has) catch me, he can pull me up or I can use him as a brace for stability, he alerts me to take medication  (or drink something sugary)... he has about mid 30's for total number of or different variations of what I've described. He also is trained to Protect me, such as if I DO pass out or if I'm sitting on a sidewalk recovering.  This is very useful because I didn't have the ""problem"" of passing out coupled with a post-concussive syndrome brain...when diagnosed with hypoglycemia. It became unmanageable with the gastroparesis.Then my weight dropped and the social comments flooded me with anxiety. So before, the public would often say mean to horrible things about my weight. Now that narrative, along with a MUCH healthier weight and appearance, make people ask me 1000 ways of ""what's wrong with you?"" aka ""You look normal and you get to bring your dog in here. That's bullshit/not fair."" But simply having my Service Dog with me made people instantly stop yelling ""anorexic bitch!"" and ""eat a cheeseburger!!"" and the like.  Kids tend to be the best. Their reactions are the least judgmental. They either just think it's cool (or sometimes scary, given my dog is 120lbs and a ""bully breed"") that a dog is at the grocery store. Middle aged to older men, and about 75% of oldER women tend to look twice and keep to themselves. If they're around us for awhile, I'll smile or they will compliment my dog or tell me a dog story. This is my favorite subset with which to interact. Middle aged women are BY FAR the most judgmental. As is the law, I owe the public exactly zero explanation about my medical condition(s) (unless you're a doctor or judge, one legally can't access my medical info which I voluntarily provided on this post). They tend to either assume I'm training dogs or feel they must get to the bottom of how a seemingly ""normal"" person can have something so profound as a Service Dog.  People in my demographic (18-34? I'm almost 30) tend to be very hit or miss. I've heard young parents explain ""no son, that's an assistance dog so you can't pet it"" which gives me hope for the future.  Then I get a certain younger subset who reeeeeally want to pet my dog. These present an interesting challenge that I feel I often get taken advantage of for doing a nice deed (letting fellow humans borrow - pet my Service Dog)... in that, yes I get to educate them, but they ask such stupid questions it's difficult at times. I get asked how to fake a Service Dog multiple times a week because I'm somewhat regionally known in my area as a dog trainer or bully breed (I will never self-appoint the word ""expert"" to myself) avid-educating person. So really it depends on the public that day. Public is pretty general. I've had more rudeness at small, locally-owned shops than collegiate sporting events or flying commercially, TBH."

I realized within the following week what my life was about to look like, simply because the things that I experienced from the trip were not leaving my mind and were sending me entirely back into the psychedelic state of mind. I had my first panic attack during the trip and the first thing that really interfered with me afterwards was social anxiety. I never had it before (not like that at least)."

Not a constant psychosis where I was never normal, but everything I experienced.. especially what I thought I had ""learned"" or had ""revealed"" to me would not leave my mind. I don't remember a moment the thought of that ""thing"" I experienced left my mind. It was like being marked by a possessed curiosity.   I took 4 MAOI mood stabilizers and drank a gallon of orange juice in an attempt to make the trip very powerful. My dosage was an 1/8th, and they ended up being extremely powerful by themselves.

AMA,3dmzdi,theoriginalj,6,Fri Jul 17 17:37:44 2015 UTC,"Because of my belief systems and perspectives on reality at the time, I did not begin to consider at all that what was happening within me was ""wrong"", dishonest, or putting me out of touch with reality...  I was really certain it was doing the exact opposite - putting me in touch with REAL reality. I had been convinced that nothing was the way it seemed. After the mushroom trip in particular, I was absolutely certain that the reality I had grew up in was manufactured and a farce. And I was extremely curious and mischievous in my mind to the point I was willing to entertain all sorts of possibilities.  I believed there was a couple people out to hurt me. Mostly my brother, but he did actually hurt me during my psychosis and said some very deeply painful things to me."

AMA,3dmzdi,theoriginalj,11,Fri Jul 17 16:40:03 2015 UTC,"Psilocybin mushrooms, ""gold caps"". Your second question is hard to answer because of how detached I was from reality at any moment. I will give you some examples of some of the extremely far out beliefs I had.   My interconnection to life meant that no mind was separated, so naturally I must have access to what anyone else is thinking or feeling. This justified the extent to which I believed any voice in my head was some one else, or some THING else. Everything had a consciousness to me and that consciousness could flow through my mind. Thoughts were not mine, they were OURS... if that make senses. When a thought happened it could've been god, my brother, the cat, any one or thing's thought. Many times I was absolutely convinced I had destroyed reality/the world/the universe and was living in my own conscious projection of it. I came to the conclusion I was projecting it because you can never see anything behind your head but a blackness/darkness. To me that = I am projecting everything. Everything that existed in the darkness would narrate ""the truth"" about my projection, state of existence, where I was, who I was, why I was there. A silly but really scary trip I had was that if I did not keep moving, not only would the real reality that I destroyed be gone.. but the one I was projecting would die. In order to escape each reality, I was given specific instructions to hop on one foot forward into a ""different dimension"". Different directions meant different things, I was given time limits for being in each dimension, and other requirements/restrictions. If I hopped back it was because I made a mistake and ended up somewhere I really didn't want to be. Move items a certain way or else this will happen, touch this or say that... because if you don't then y will happen or x person will fucking murder you. One of the instructions that made no fucking sense at all... was to go into the kitchen.. grab a bag of tostidos.. and shit in it.  Then I was to throw it away and tell my mom that I shit in the tostidos bag."

AMA,3dmbzd,antiHerbert,8,Fri Jul 17 13:48:46 2015 UTC,"You really shouldn't leave it exposed to open air at all if it's very fresh.  If it's a high quality fresh mozz, you want to store it in water or brine (distilled is what we use at my cheese shop; it keeps your tap water from flavoring it). If you plan on using it in one to two days after opening, keeping it in saran (as airtight as possible) will be okay. But yeah you should honestly use it on the same day you buy it for max freshness. If you buy the handmade fresh version, ask the person from whom you're buy it how to keep it.  If it's not a super fresh, handmade one, eh. Use saran or a plastic baggy. It's usually already pretty dried out so that it'll keep longer.  If you're wondering why you should listen to me: I've been a cheese monger for three years, so I mostly know my shit."

If it leaks when you open it, it's probably some whey that hasn't been completely removed. This happens sometimes. NBD.  The brine you should probably use for mozzarella is 1-2 tsp to 1 cup of water (distilled, preferably), and you will have to make it yourself."

AMA,3dmbzd,fuweike,2,Fri Jul 17 20:10:02 2015 UTC,"Can't answer your cow question, but I can help with the rennet one. Traditional buffalo mozzarella (I'm not sure why you're using quotation marks; buffalo mozzarella is literally made from buffalo milk) is pretty much across the board animal rennet. I've never heard of any buffalo mozzarella being made with veggie rennet, and I know for a fact that the DOP/PDO version is made with animal.  To answer your third question, the majority of mozzarella producers in the US use microbial rennet. It's less expensive, so if they're producing on a large scale it's much more cost effective. Bel Gioso uses veggie rennet, and so do the Murray's brand. I'm fairly certain that Galbani does, too."
AMA,3dmbzd,super-rad,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:23:43 2015 UTC,"I particularly like buffalo mozzarella and when it comes to use rennet is depending on the company, if the company is kosher certified it means that the rennet is not from the stomach of the an animals."

AMA,3dmbzd,owltattoo,0,Fri Jul 17 20:48:19 2015 UTC,Usually the males are sold for meat but not always. Rennet can be made from animals and fungus. Some people boils fig plant stems and use the water as coagulant although i haven't tried.
AMA,3dmbzd,owltattoo,2,Fri Jul 17 23:10:41 2015 UTC,"Rennet is one of many coagulants that can be used to make cheese.  Rennet can be made from many different things, and not all cheeses use rennet. Tartaric and citric acid are options for coagulating milk, too, that aren't technically called rennet. That's vinegar and lemon juice, but at their purest have a more consistent acidity.   The most common two sources of rennet in the US right now are microbial and animal; microbial (vegetarian-ish) is the most common. Microbial is kind of vegetarian because it's technically cloned animal rennet, so the making of that specific batch of microbial rennet didn't harm any animals or involve animal products, but the original culture from which it was grown did.  You can also use a nettle or thistle extract as a coagulant; I've had a gouda made from nettle rennet, so it does work for more firm cheeses."
AMA,3dmbzd,owltattoo,2,Fri Jul 17 19:48:20 2015 UTC,"vinegar, citric acid, lemon is mainly for cheeses that are set at high temperatures such as ricotta, paneer, etc."

It may be more likely, but I can't speak to that as it's not part of my body of knowledge.   If you're worried about it, the best thing you can do is find out which farms provide your cheesemaker with milk, then contact them and ask how they treat their animals and what they do with their male calves."
AMA,3dmbzd,suggarstalk,2,Fri Jul 17 20:05:36 2015 UTC,"I based what I said on research done by a guy who contacted several different organic dairy companies and asked about what happens to calves born to organic dairy cows. He was told by at least one company that calves born to organic dairy cows aren't normally slaughtered when they're still calves. The reason given for that practice was not ethical, but economic. Apparently, organic dairy calves are too expensive for the veal farms to buy. Here's the link: http://kazez.blogspot.com/2010/02/got-ethical-milk.html?m=1"

If you have any real questions about cheese, mozzarella, whatever, I'll answer what I can for you. I've been working in the cheese industry for three years, and I have access to several ACS certified cheese professionals if I can't answer your question.   Also the answers to a lot of these questions can be found online, so OP didn't even bother to actually look for the correct answers.

AMA,3dmbzd,slot_machine,6,Fri Jul 17 19:24:26 2015 UTC,"Great mozz is made from fresh milk and eaten on the same day that it's made. Basically. You don't want the curds over stretched. It should be moist.   It depends on the pizza you're making and what aesthetic/flavor your attempting to achieve.  I'm answering as many of these questions as I can for OP since he/she has apparently disappeared. I'm a cheesemonger, and I've made cheese/have friends who do it on the daily."

AMA,3dmbzd,bigtips,3,Fri Jul 17 17:36:15 2015 UTC,"A good mozzarella depends what is the final us. For fresh mozzarella you would want buttery, moist and creamy but not watery. For pizza, if mozzarella was made with bacteria it will not have the brownish color in the cheese because the bacteria eats the sugar in milk and will produce lactic acid."
AMA,3dmbzd,owltattoo,2,Fri Jul 17 18:37:31 2015 UTC,Do you start with cheese curds?  Or do you start with milk and make your own curds?
AMA,3dmbzd,bigtips,2,Fri Jul 17 22:58:23 2015 UTC,"He's been answering to the thread instead of the questions, so his answer is that his company starts with milk."
AMA,3dmbzd,owltattoo,2,Fri Jul 17 15:21:21 2015 UTC,Thanks I appreciate you following up.  I've only made mozz a handful of times and always did it from milk.  But the best mozz I have ever eaten started with curds.
AMA,3dmbzd,bigtips,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:10:53 2015 UTC,"I'm not really sure what you're saying. All mozzarella starts off as milk, then the coagulant is added, which creates curds. Then the curds are stretched.  Some places that produce cheese will sell their curds to be later stretched by home cheesemakers, but those curds did 100% start off as milk.  The above is suuuuuuuuuuuuper simplified."
AMA,3dmbzd,owltattoo,2,Fri Jul 17 20:20:10 2015 UTC,"I understand it all starts as milk.  I'm just saying the best mozz I had, the cheesemaker did not make their own curds.  They bought premade curds from somewhere and then stretched those.  I've made mozzarella starting with milk and adding rennet, skimming the curds, and all that jazz.  Turned out pretty good, but I've been curious to just buy curds and start from there."
AMA,3dmbzd,Purplegill10,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:32:48 2015 UTC,"Ohhhh, I understand. You should definitely try buying curds if you can find them. It's absolutely worth testing. The difference may be in the sterile, more controlled environment, and especially it may be in whether they're pasteurizing their own milk. If they are, then the milk will be much fresher than what you can get at the grocery store, or even at most farms because if I remember correctly it's frowned upon, if not illegal, to sell raw cow milk to consumers. Curds made professionally by a producer that sells their end product are going to have significantly more stringent quality control, especially in regards to pH levels (which OP has mentioned several times; outside of my body of knowledge, unfortunately), good culture, and more consistent control of temperature."

AMA,3dmbzd,SnowRidin,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:18:57 2015 UTC,"Oooo, ooo, question: can you taste the difference in summer milk vs. winter milk (usually grass or fresh hay fed vs. silage, which is dried grass/hay)? I've heard that summer milk is more yellow and slightly more fatty due to the fresh grass. Something to do with how cows process... a specific protein? Maybe chlorophyll? I can't remember. But goats can't process it, which is why their milk is so white."
AMA,3dmbzd,SnowRidin,2,Fri Jul 17 22:59:18 2015 UTC,Usually white milk is mainly because the fat has been removed of fat globules have been broken into small particles (homogenized). guess what color butter is.
AMA,3dmbzd,owltattoo,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:20:44 2015 UTC,"Right but that's only in regards to cow milk, yeah? I'm pretty sure sheep and buffalo are also unable to process it. The thing in grass. Which I can't remember.   Edit: BETA CAROTINE  I was wrong about them not being able to process it. SO, it's what makes cow milk yellow. Goats and sheep process it, but it doesn't show up in their milk because their bodies use it differently."
AMA,3dmbzd,elenoiress,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:30:41 2015 UTC,Fat makes it yellow
AMA,3dmbzd,elenoiress,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:32:24 2015 UTC,"No, carotine, which is stored in fat, makes it yellow.   ""They also (in lower concentrations) impart the yellow coloration to milk-fat and butter.""  Via https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carotene  So actually I guess technically yes but actually no. And I was right about the chlorophyll."
AMA,3dmbzd,Thunder_Bro,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:52:33 2015 UTC,is the other way around winter milk will have more fat that's why you will need to incorporate more protein to compensate otherwise you will loose your expensive fat. The ratio is 1.20 and total solids in milk shouldn't exceed 15%.

AMA,3dmbzd,WhoThatGuy,3,Fri Jul 17 15:39:32 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I just figured that if nobody's doing it, maybe there's a reason - something to do with how it's made? (I'm not a home cheeser).

AMA,3dmbzd,allyoucanteat,3,Fri Jul 17 19:41:37 2015 UTC,"While technically true, it's also sort of half true. Traditionally (originally) all cheese called mozzarella was made from Italian Water Buffalo milk. However, the EU recognizes cow milk mozzarella as mozzarella as well. Otherwise, mozzarella made from cow's milk is called fior di latte.  In the US: Mozzarella di Bufala is an imported buffalo mozz. There's also a PDO version called Mozzarella di Bufala Campana. I've only heard of a couple American producers, honestly, and the cost of their product is astronomical. The majority of mozzarella in the US is made from cow milk, and you can assume that if a cheese is not labeled as Mozzarella di Bufala that it is made from cow milk."
AMA,3dmbzd,snowglobe13579,2,Fri Jul 17 16:25:39 2015 UTC,"In Italy too.  If you go to a store or caseificio (fresh cheese shop) and ask for mozzarella, you'll have 5 or so choices of form, all from cows milk.  Buffalo milk mozzarella is always sold as ""Mozzarella di Bufala"" and gets a higher price.    PDO is DOP (Denominazione di origine protetta).  Campania is the province where the best Bufala Mozzarella comes from (and where Napoli is).   Also big scandals here in Italy because some producers have been mixing expensive buffalo milk with cheaper cow's milk but still calling it Mozz. di Bufala.  I live in Puglia."
AMA,3dmbzd,JPrideaux,3,Fri Jul 17 17:31:10 2015 UTC,"That's awesome, thanks for providing that insight. I've never been to Italy, so I can only speak to what I've read.

As a side note, Kraft Parmesan ""cheese product"" does qualify as EU approved hazardous waste i.e, sawdust) and there's nothing in Italy called ""genoa salami"", pepperoni sausage or Alfredo sauce.  :)"
AMA,3dmbzd,dinero2180,2,Fri Jul 17 19:12:53 2015 UTC,"Haha. I think I knew most of this, though I need to read up more on the DOC.   In the US they can't call any of the ""cheese singles"" that Kraft makes ""cheese."" They have to call it ""cheese product."" I find that hilarious.   Also meatballs. American invention, right?  ALSO: my shop was sent a feta spread that we've been anxiously awaiting for months, and we were sooooo excited when we got it. When we opened it, it was basically fucking feta Velveeta. It is obviously made from the whey. It's sooooo bad. Tastes like feta when it sours. Point of this: it's a product made by Real Greek Feta (so certified by the Greek DOC/AOC equivalent for their actual feta). And it's... bad."
AMA,3dmbzd,owltattoo,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:23:24 2015 UTC,"We have meatballs (polpetini), but they're rarely in sauce like ""spaghetti and meatballs"".  The ones we have here are usually small (like 1"" dia) and deep fried and you eat them as an appetizer or side dish (occaisionally with sauce, never with spaghetti).  Oddly it's actually easier to find good feta in the US than here, and we're only 100 miles or so from Greece.  Here the predominant attitude is: if your mother didn't cook it, it can't be good.  Slowly changing but not much room for other cuisines.  Fun fact:  One of the best tomatoes for sauce or pizza is a cultivar called San Marzano.  It has a poor yield, not many growers, and they carry a high price (but worth it, they are absolutely delicious).  Meanwhile in the US, there is a company called ""San Marzano"".  I can only think (after trying their product) that the idea is to  package ordinary tomatoes and fool people into thinking they're real San Marzano tomatoes."

Seems pretty simple, but pulling the curds can get difficult, and you don't want to over knead it.  Can't answer your wax question, other than to point you to this link.  However, if you'll allow me to speculate, most cheesemakers wax their cheese before it ages or not long into the aging process. The wax acts as a rind that retains moisture and prevents contamination from ambient bacteria. That you're adding wax so late in the aging process may be your issue. Again, not totally sure about that. Just guessing.  What kind of wax were you using?"

AMA,3dnok4,elenoiress,4,Fri Jul 17 21:24:30 2015 UTC,"1) It was something my now-fiancee and I decided on together. I actually got really depressed when she was pregnant because she considered aborting. She was free to do as she ultimately wanted, but that's not to say there are no repercussions for the father if he wants to keep the baby but mother does not - people rarely think about that as well. She wasn't pressured, it was a free choice for both of us.  2) I am currently 26.  3) I firmly believe that 70% of my PPD was attributed to lack of sleep the first 3 months - everything else was magnified due to this. Lack of sleep can literally change your brain's chemical composition and I can't think of a time where I felt the most regret in my life. It was bad. Even when I began to get good sleep again, the repercussions stuck around pretty heavily."

AMA,3dmglb,TheGreenShepherd,5,Fri Jul 17 16:13:03 2015 UTC,"I agree 100%. I don't partake in any ritual. The Church Of Satan has rituals which are psychological theatrics for the most part and though I understand them and their purpose it's a bit dramatic and if I participated in them it would be completely contrived on my part. Though I subscribe to some of Anton Lavey's philosophies, I don't subscribe to all, and I'm not a member of the Church Of Satan. I do support the Satanic Temple (not a member of that either). I think satanism at its core promotes self worth, personal growth, awareness, and understanding."
AMA,3dmglb,hemphead420,3,Fri Jul 17 16:30:19 2015 UTC,What sort of psychological theatrics?
AMA,3dmglb,CUNTRY,3,Fri Jul 17 17:11:39 2015 UTC,"Anton Lavey mostly uses the word magic in a psychological sense as opposed to a supernatural sense of the word. As the Church Of Satan puts it a ritual (or greater magic) is self-transformational psychodrama. It serves as a means to purge oneself of unwanted emotional baggage that may be hindering a daily pursuit of joy in life.   It is theatric for psychological emphasis on what the ritual aims to accomplish. So the objects, people, actions of the ritual are just that."

Being we must almost certainly live most of our lives amongst other humans, that may hinder the quality of human life."

AMA,3dmglb,inthewakeofchaos,3,Fri Jul 17 20:26:54 2015 UTC,How is that different than arguing that philosophy is a hindrance to human progression because the French Revolutionaries used Nietzsche to justify beheading people they thought were bad for the state?

AMA,3dmglb,Nomanorus,2,Fri Jul 17 20:41:23 2015 UTC,"Maybe it's not different, I was simply asked for one example and I see that as a valid example, relevant to the subject."
AMA,3dmglb,Nomanorus,2,Fri Jul 17 20:56:41 2015 UTC,"Fair enough.  But if philosophy can be just a dangerous as religion, would also admit that philosophy is harmful to human progression?"
AMA,3dmglb,Felipe_O,2,Sat Jul 18 02:06:48 2015 UTC,"Absolutely, look at Adolf Hitler and his philosophies on race. Religion is a major ongoing burden that will continue to be that way for generations, and it's not just cases of murder, but human rights, prejudice, and used as a basis of fundamentals that effect a wide range of people, and so on. It will continue to be harmful, and I'm not okay with that."
AMA,3dmglb,Dac113,2,Sat Jul 18 02:24:11 2015 UTC,"But the problem with your reasoning is that philosophy has also aided human progression.  The reason we we even have concepts of human rights is because of the philosophical work of John Locke.  Philosophers like Kant and Kierkegaard were heavily influential in the progress of moral thought.    Just like religion, philosophy can be used for good or evil.  To just label it as systematically bad and only using negative examples to justify is a logical fallacy known as special pleading.    This is where you cite evidence that helps your case (Hitler, Crusades etc...) and ignore the evidence that goes against you.  While overly simplistic generalizations condemning religion might be a popular view on reddit, I'd really encourage you to think through this viewpoint a little more.    There's a lot of benefit to the world that religion provides and I think you aren't looking at the entire picture."
AMA,3dmglb,Dac113,2,Sat Jul 18 14:36:53 2015 UTC,"I don't disagree that some religions may have benefits either individually or collectively, but the beneficial aspects can usually be there without the belief in God; unless the belief in God itself is beneficial, then that's a matter of personal opinion. I think the belief in God is a weak suggestive answer  to a void of flaws or unknown aspects of life, that alters one's behavior in most cases. I think it gives a person manufactured reasoning and essentially leaves them unable to assimilate outside of their religious beliefs. If one wants to believe in God for personal fulfillment, unmoved by any doctrines that may or may not accompany that belief, that is fine-- but still silly in my opinion. I'll respect their human right to believe what they want but I don't have to openly be respectful to their beliefs in and of itself, not that I don't understand it or tolerate it, but simply that I have contempt for the belief, not the individual."

AMA,3dmglb,throwingfire,2,Fri Jul 17 18:20:09 2015 UTC,"I've never had desire to meet with other Satanists for the sake of having that in common, it just doesn't appeal to me.   It's been over 10 years since I've read Lavey's books. I'm not a member of the Church Of Satan and I don't agree with all of Lavey's philosophies, but I don't have to. I took valuable things from Lavey and his idea of Satanism but I never applied myself to anything that wasn't already applicable to me. In my opinion if you have read the Satanic bible then you pretty much have covered Lavey. Some of the stuff he gets into that is shot off of old occult practitioners can get a bit odd."

I first became acquainted with Rastafari when I was around 10 years old. I don't want to say I became a Rastaman right away because to be a practitioner of Rastafari once must have a deep overstanding of what it means and the tenants of its practice. A consciousness existed from my earliest memories about the things that I believe to be virtuous in life but Rastafari introduced me to an organized belief system that I could trust in and fully ensconce myself in. I would say by age 16 I could fully be described as a Rastaman."

AMA,3dksow,playswithknives,3,Fri Jul 17 04:00:50 2015 UTC,"Rastafari liveth in I and I soul and occupy my being. It wasn't simply being attracted to it ideologically, I and I was drawn to it naturally. It is what I and I recognized to be righteous and truthful before I and I could even understand what it was. Its difficult to explain but its more complex than simply learning what it is and deciding to become a Rastaman.  Further, I and I do not consume any alcoholic beverages. It is a poison to the mind and to the body and cannot be consumed by a conscious and right minded individual. Cannabis is a sacrament. It is smoked in a setting of meditation and reasoning, so yes I and I consume this herb which was give to us by Jah Rastafari.  All Rastaman must consume an Ital diet, consisting of whatever can be grown in the ground, or on the tree, or in the bush or the fish that swimeth in the waters. It is difficult living in a place where one cannot cultivate their own food so I and I must be very mindful of what I consume. Little meat, only if it is raised, cut and consumed in a respectful and clean manner and fruits, vegetables, and grains from local farmers.  There are many things every person should know, but that is for each individual to find out for themselves. What I will say is this: Jah Almighty the creator of the heavens and the earth and the Patron of King Alpha and Queen Omega is a being incomprehensible to us who liveth here on the green earth. Jah is not powerless in guiding us on the path of righteousness and he sends us signs all the time of the manner in which all things of earthly interest should be conducted. One must look and see what is true. We look and see one man, Haile Selassie I, who is the most recent incarnation of Jah message on earth. This is what is important."

AMA,3dksow,libbyschop,2,Fri Jul 17 14:37:31 2015 UTC,I and I refers not only to I self but to the collective consciousness of all things that dwell on the earth. There is quite a lengthy discussion on this on r/rastafarianism if you take the time to read and overstand.
AMA,3dksow,libbyschop,5,Fri Jul 17 14:44:14 2015 UTC,"Why did you miss the glorious opportunity to drop the second r in the sub name?  On a more serious note, does being rastafarian effect the kind of work you can/will do or the jobs you will take on?  I don't think I have ever seen a picture of a rasta in a metal shop, etc."
AMA,3dksow,Cheese_whistler,2,Fri Jul 17 07:11:15 2015 UTC,"You know, I thought of that shortly after I created the sub but at that point it wasn't important enough to make the change. Rasta is only limited in the work he does to those jobs which do not support Babylonian regimes or institutions. I and I and my brethren and sistren do not work for the government (Rasta no work for no CIA) directly nor would one partake in work with an unrighteous business who's product or manner of business is Babylonian, or does not further peace, love, and unity for all things. You will never find a Rasta working for an insurance company, for a gun store, etc. I and I personally work of a Tech Service Desk at a University."
AMA,3dksow,Thefattstuff,4,Fri Jul 17 12:15:23 2015 UTC,Does it bother you that the musical legacy of Rasta musicians like Bob Marley have been co-opted by people who just want to smoke up and party?
AMA,3dksow,maximuszen,3,Fri Jul 17 07:58:27 2015 UTC,"If the people want to hear Bob play and listen to his message and partake of the herb, then they are well on their way to the recognition of Rastafari.

AMA,3dksow,Esco91,2,Fri Jul 17 12:40:17 2015 UTC,"Very broad questions deserve very broad answers. A Rastafarian is one who recognizes Haile Selassie I as Jah Rastafari, divinity here on earth, and abides by the teachings of HIM."
AMA,3dksow,HitlerWasASexyMofo,3,Fri Jul 17 12:50:34 2015 UTC,I didn't mean to be rude. Who is Haile Selassie I as Jah Rastafari?
AMA,3dksow,vanillaacid,2,Fri Jul 17 12:52:01 2015 UTC,"Haile Selassie I was the Emperor of Ethiopia starting in 1930 when he was confirmed by the Ethiopian Orthodox Church as the King of Kings, Lord of Lords, and incarnation of God on earth. Originally many thought this was a presumptuous title but His Imperial Majesty was able to back up this title with great deeds and teaching until the day of his death at the hands of insurrectionists. Not only were his action divine but his coming was predicted by a pastor in the Caribbean a decade before Selassie I was a known figure. This man, Athlyi Rogers saw many visions of Selassie I and when the coronation of HIM occurred, Athlyi recognized him as the man in his visions, shown to him by Jah Almighty, God above."
AMA,3dksow,ryanmcgrim,3,Fri Jul 17 13:04:06 2015 UTC,"Why do Rastafarians use made up words such as ""overstand"" and ""downpression""? I understand that the real words have negative sounding connotations or pronunciations, but at the end of the day are just words. I find it hard to take serious an intelligent sounding person that chooses to make up their own words simply because of the way they are spelled or sound. Why not speak proper English?"
AMA,3dksow,vanillaacid,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:48:39 2015 UTC,"The way I and I choose to utter words is a representation of my mindset. My mindset must be of the utmost positive expression and if a word in a language does not justify this then I and I shall not use it. To ""understand"" denotes that one is not fathoming of their own volition but taking the beliefs of another as true without thinking critically or attempting to build ones own knowledge. To ""overstand"" is to possess complete and independent comprehension of the topic or subject at hand, to trust in ones own sincere ideologies.  There is no reason to condemn oneself to the tautology of a Babylonian thing like ""proper English"" If I and I speak and you are able to overstand what I am saying, it is incomprehensible as to why I would use the language taught to I and I self and I and I heritage by the bringers of oppression."

AMA,3dksow,HitlerWasASexyMofo,2,Fri Jul 17 17:59:21 2015 UTC,"As an Ethiopian-American with dreadlocks, I get asked about Rastafarianism every so often. I don't know much about the beliefs other than that Emperor Haile Selassie is viewed as a messiah. What do dreadlocks mean to you and other practitioners?  I notice a clear distaste for anything Babylonian in your answers, can you explain what it means for something to be Babylonian? And why you shun it?  Lastly, is there a hierarchy of leadership in Rastafarianism? Sacred text(s)? How would Rastas know if the messiah has been reincarnated again?"
AMA,3dksow,HitlerWasASexyMofo,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:18:55 2015 UTC,"Part of the overarching physical practice pertaining to Rastafari is the maintenance of he body in its most pure form. Rastaman does not get tattoos, does not get piercings, does not eat filthy foods, does not consume alcohol or synthetics, and does not cut ones hair. Instead one lets it grow naturally as the peoples of old and many Rastaman being of African decent, the hair forms into dreadlocks over time. It has come to be a cultural and social identity.  Babylon is the incarnation of all things evil and unrighteous. All things the represent the poisoning of the body, mind, soul, and mentality. Just as the ancient city of Babylon was filled with violence, sin, and transgressions, so to is much of modern, capitalist, industrialized society where one values money more than human life and consumes what one does not need until he is fat, lazy, and nihilistic. I and I shun Babylon because I refuse association with anything that strays from the path of righteousness.  While there is an international Rastafarian council there is very little structure in the hierarchical sense because one does not believe that  one man or woman is better than any other. All can come equally, naked and beautiful in their natural form and be recognized simply as a human. All are capable of conducting themselves in a righteous manner, evil is not inherent but Babylon poisons the minds of the weak and the vulnerable.  Sacred texts include The Holy Piby, The Promised Key, The Royal Parchment Scroll of Black Supremacy, the Auto-biography of Haile Selassie I, the Hebrew Bible, and the Kebra Nagast.   The messiah is always predicted in an explicit manner and we have followed a pattern called the Messianic Cycle of roughly every 2000 years. Selassie I appeared roughly 2000 years after Christ and Elijah roughly 2000 years before that. Jesus was predicted as was Selassie I by a preacher named Athlyi Rogers who wrote the Holy Piby."

Despite that I've been lucky and worked my way into a good job.  As an aside my mom is 52 so I'm also the product of an early pregnency.

I discussed solutions for the conflict with myself, friends and online. The best solution in my opinion is for palestinians to help Israel defeat hamas and then open a discussion about land. This dilemma is a very complicated one and i alone wouldn't be able to think about a solution.  The IDF is Israel's army and enlistment is mandatory at 18, so it's not a matter of want or not. Never the less, I would probably enlist if service wasn't a must. That's because i trust my army to do the right thing not only for Israel but also for the safety of the palestinians, and they've managed to demonstrate this until now. Of course the military is under the government, and our government is at a gentle state right now so i hope things work out for the better.  I understand that there were many palestinian casualties so far but the army's goal is to minimize casualties on all sides, that's why i respect our army."

The pain I can only describe as somebody trying to shove a pencil-top eraser into my skull from between the top of my eyeball and brow bone. Simultaneously, it felt like a glass mirror shattering into my eye from behind - from the back of my head.   Excedrin Migraine, silence, darkness, and waiting is how I treat all headaches now. Doctors told me that it may never happen again, or it could become routine, like yours. To date, it has not happened again. I get bad migraines regularly, but cluster headaches is a different monster entirely. I feel for you, even if my frame of reference is incredibly small."

AMA,3djjv2,speckleeyed,3,Fri Jul 17 14:15:43 2015 UTC,"I had one every night for a few years, it was terrible.  Within an hour or so of falling asleep I'd wake up as the pain ramped up and got sharper.  To avoid bothering my wife I'd make my way downstairs and end up propped up in the corner of the couch, waiting for the next wave to be a little less intense than the last.  Once that started to happen I'd usually fall asleep right there from exhaustion.  Talk about time dilation, those 20-40 minutes were the longest of the day.    Mine ended up tapering off and then ceasing altogether about 6 months after I moved out of the place where they'd started.  At this point I'm as certain as I can be that it was a reaction to a slow but significant leak in the condo's air conditioning unit."

AMA,3djjv2,IAMAHORSESIZEDUCK,2,Thu Jul 16 20:28:46 2015 UTC,"By far.  To give you an idea, put your finger into your eye socket (as if pushing down on your eyeball through your eyelid) right beneath the brow bone. Then push down. It starts to hurt when you do that - the pain is like 100x worse than that.  Feels like someone got a hook, shoved it into your socket and is slowly trying to pull your eyeball out...followed by intense waves of pain that shoot through your head down to your neck. I'd compare it to a storm. Shit hurts."
AMA,3djjv2,IAMAHORSESIZEDUCK,2,Thu Jul 16 20:36:51 2015 UTC,I've had migraines so bad I was admitted to hospitals. I've had doctors tell me they aren't sure if I have migraines or cluster headaches. But I've been on topomax for 3 years now to prevent them and it doesn't keep them away completely but 95% OTC drugs will work.   I think it also helped me personally that I breast fed my son for 2 years and went off every medication and watched everything I ate and basically did a 2 year detox before starting topomax.
AMA,3djjv2,pinkwaffles,2,Thu Jul 16 23:27:26 2015 UTC,"Yea, my mother suffers from migraines too... this is actually where i suspect I get the Cluster Headache tendencies; but to be fair, I've never had a migraine.

AMA,3djjv2,pinkwaffles,1 point,Fri Jul 17 05:47:25 2015 UTC,"No, it doesn't. But in order to try to combat the pain I was taking a HANDFUL of OTC painkillers just about every day and they had their own side effects. Topomax just reduced my appetite for me."
AMA,3djjv2,dewarsmaduro,3,Fri Jul 17 10:43:44 2015 UTC,"Oh, I meant to tell you... one way to differentiate a migraine from a cluster headache is light sensitivity.  CH sufferers usually experience the same pain with or without light/ the light doesn't make it worse. Migraine sufferers usually have an intensification of pain due to light sensitivity while theyre having one."

Well I am from a part of Australia that doesn't really see a lot of travellers so I may not be the best person to ask - People tend to go to places like Sydney or Melbourne. I think the best way to meet people is to strike up a conversation with them! If you are out at a club or pub and there is a group of people introducing yourself and chatting usually goes a long way. Also if you plan to stay in a certain area for awhile get involved in their groups such as a sports team or a theatre group.   Like I said I am from an area that doesn't get many tourists but I like when people are confident and say hey."

AMA,3dkyay,aragonkingofgonder,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:28:16 2015 UTC,It is very expensive here but living here you get used to it and work hard to find a job that makes life slightly easier.  If I was visiting Australia I would seriously go to all the little small towns that are around. The big cities are so overrrated and there are some beautiful places in Australia.   I guess we treat the military well? They are definitely not a huge part of our culture but they are well respected.

AMA,3dkyay,aragonkingofgonder,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:43:58 2015 UTC,I think Australia is a great place and if you have the opportunity you should definitely visit.

AMA,3dhu6r,Coobe,18,Thu Jul 16 11:50:15 2015 UTC,To help me understand agoraphobia (if that's even possible) can you please explain what it is that scares you about being outside?  Is it just a general feeling that pretty much anything could happen to you when you're out there or do you imagine/fear something more specific happening to you?
AMA,3dhu6r,pj_puttz,30,Thu Jul 16 12:07:26 2015 UTC,"i´m not sure i can explain it well, since i forgot how it is to NOT have agoraphobia. But i try:  It´s like a reflex, as soon as i see open spaces or specific patterns in my Environment i get dizzy, my heart rate rises and i get the feeling that i go insane or faint and lose control over my actions. It´s comparable to the fear of heights. If you stand on top of a Big building, some experience the anxiety to involuntary jump. It´s basically like that, just very extreme.  The most difficult situations, are the ones you cant escape that easily. Like traffic jam, red traffic lights, long waiting lines etc.  Additionally you are afraid to embarass yourself. One example:  You walk down the street and feeling anxious but still ok. Then you meet someone you know and engage in conversation. Now you have the pressure to stand there and talk. If you ""escape"" you look dumb. This starts a vicious cycle, the more you think about it, the more you are getting anxiety symptoms.   Hope this makes it a little bit more clear"
AMA,3dhu6r,pj_puttz,8,Thu Jul 16 12:14:10 2015 UTC,"Thanks man, that does make it pretty clear.  I cant imagine how difficult that must be in your day to day life!  Trying to hide it from other people to save embarrassment must be a big factor in you not wanting to go outside too.

AMA,3dhu6r,tommy2jeeps,2,Thu Jul 16 15:40:50 2015 UTC,"Hello! Just wanted to pop in and say that I used to suffer from severe agoraphobia. For 4 years from the ages of 17 to 21 I did not go outside of my flat at all. Not even out to the mailbox, not even outside for 1 second. After 21 is got slowly better but I, like you would avoid certain stores and have to go running back home after a little while. And now finally at the age of 28 I can do pretty much anything I want to. I do have bad days sometimes but for the most part im all good with leaving the house.   Question: You have a girlfriend. Do you ever worry that she is going to get sick of having to 'pick up the slack' so to speak, for you? You can't go to a grocery store or cinema...do you think she is going to get sick of this eventually? I had a boyfriend during my worst, we were living together. He eventually started screaming, yelling, being abusive because he couldn't handle or even understand my illness.   Best of luck to you!"

To your description and some of your answers, I can relate with my PTSD anxiety. It's impossibly hard to try to explain to a family member that you're shaky and hyperventilating about going into a gas station to buy a soda... and just be stared at like a freak. I'm going to look into agoraphobia more... it might make my anxiety triggers more understandable.

I guess I saw it as a new challenge, where I could use my previous experiences ""in the trenches"" to help others like me, and get paid.  The best skills?

I remember when I was 10 or 11 years old at the local mall the elevators were out and there were no regular stairs. It became quite the scene. I was so scared, I would just be stuck in Sears forever, why couldn't it at least have been Toys R Us or EB Games?! Or better yet, Chick Fil A or Spencers.   Now, I'm at the point where I can go down them. But I do get frightened and if there are stairs or elevators I always prefer that. It takes me a lot longer than others to make the step so if there are people behind me it can be embarrassing. ""Oh, sorry go ahead."" I just have to let them go ahead.

The first scene was kind of intriguing, I like the concept but when it started showing boobs and Bulk and Skull killing Jason it was just too much. I would like something like that taken seriously adn actually being accurate to who the characters were. Like the Power Rangers as adults, a little more serious and less cheese, but still having them as the same people they were on the show essentially."

AMA,3dl1xt,DonminD,1 point,Fri Jul 17 06:38:27 2015 UTC,"When I spent $650 on a DVD collection of all 20 (at the time) seasons. I spend a considerable amount of time on Rangerboard.com discussing the show, seen every single episode at LEAST once. Most people really only watched the MMPR episodes.  As a kid in the 90s I was also a huge fan, but pretty much every one my age in 1993-1995 was. At a certain point it became ""uncool"" to watch the show and kids would make fun of it. Me and my best friend/neighbor at the time talked about it and were both fans but we sort of kept it on the down low. It's funny, now as a 25 year old man most people don't seem to care and some even find it kind of cool, and I've even been surprised to encounter 3-4 fans of the show, some even older than me. And it's not like I'm from a large area or anything.   I lost interest as a kid after ""Power Rangers in Space"" in 1998. Basically, that season concluded everything from that point on and it was actually intended to be the series finale. The previous season Turbo was not a hit and Fox basiscally said we're giving you one more season to do what you want but that's it.   In Space's ratings increased significantly so they decided to keep the show going. The next season was essentially a reboot with only a few connections to previous years. It was still in the same universe though. I remember watching the show when I was 10 and just thinking it's so different, it's time to move on. The decreasing continuity over the years is what made me lose interest.   Several years later, probably around 2007 when I was in highschool, I was flipping channels late at night and I saw the guy who played Tommy. I immediately recognized him. He was driving around on a jeep and honestly at first I thought it was some cheap made for TV movie. Later I realized it actually was Tommy and this was a newer incarnation of PR. Something about that just raised my interest, finding out Tommy was now a teacher and the leader of a new Power Rangers team. I got online and started researching some of the past seasons and found out how much they still reference the older years. And some of the storylines sounded interesting too. And it all just progressed from there and now it's one of my favorite shows, but I do like a lot of shows."

On a more serious note, will you be watching the new film when it comes out, and what do you think it'll be like? Do you think they will try and stick to the roots or just end up making an over-the-top CGI extravaganza?"
AMA,3dl1xt,sweater_enthusiast,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:17:51 2015 UTC,"I will definitely be watching it even if it looks terrible to me.   I think they are going to take it a little more seriously than the show ever has. They are going to turn down the cheese and Japanese influences to make it something that most regular nonfan moviegoers could also enjoy. However, I think they will still retain the basic concept of the show, use the same characters with current actors, and they will up the effects and everything for modern times obviously. The guy who did Project Almanac is doing the movie, Dean Israelite, and that movie actually wasn't too bad. He did a good job with the ""team"" aspect of these teens and they had great chemistry which would work well for Power Rangers. So I have high hopes for it.   I'm kind of imagining it with a tone similar to the Avegners except in highschool. Maybe a little more light, but hopefully not as light as the first two Fantastic Four movies. And also hopefully not as dark as DC. Just up the drama a little bit and make the special effects better.

AMA,3dh3mu,NVNG-Pokerguy,5,Thu Jul 16 05:43:26 2015 UTC,What happened?
AMA,3dh3mu,Tommyandthe,14,Thu Jul 16 06:20:49 2015 UTC,It was a lot of things. The fish dried up and the players became better/tighter. A bad game will not survive. Credit was through the roof (bad players need it) which drove up house cut and down customer satisfaction. Ultimately I eventually flew too close to the sun and attracted the wrong kind of attention from some parties with vowels at the end of their names and bowed gracefully out.

AMA,3dh3mu,Ananymus,3,Thu Jul 16 11:06:00 2015 UTC,How much money did you make?
AMA,3dh3mu,bigwigzig,4,Thu Jul 16 06:22:16 2015 UTC,"It depends, during the boom every dealer everywhere was doing $500+ a night. Most houses were running a legit cut and making $150-$200 per hour per table and averaging a couple tables. My biggest location I was a 10% partner and they had 10 tables running + a night and stayed open 14 hours a day so you do the math. This was 7 days a week.  Also should add when running the game I averaged 1-2k most nights less expenses and credit."
AMA,3dh3mu,tdames,3,Thu Jul 16 06:38:36 2015 UTC,"Did you ever catch anyone cheating? What happens, introduce their hand to a hammer?"
AMA,3dh3mu,blagojevich06,5,Thu Jul 16 08:02:14 2015 UTC,"In fact over the course of all the games I was involved in there was only one incident of malicious cheating. In this case someone added aces into their hand. They had won a big hand with AA recently. It was discovered a couple hands later when two aces hit the flop and the only logic we could follow was ""who benefited from a hand with AA"". The guy was one of my best friends and loyal regulars too. As far as consequences were concerned we didn't pay him and we dispersed his money to the table/returned all the rake for the night until everyone was even. It was not easy to keep the table from beating his face in. The damage to the reputation of the game was staggering..  We started ordering European cards after that and swutching patterns randomly so no one could do it again"

Most are in denial but if you stare at cards 75 hours a week it takes a toll one you. Changes your brain with regards to how you approach money.   A lot of them are people you couldn't pay me to spend time with outside of the tables.  The real degens are the lifeblood of a UG game. I am talking about the guys who will ship 13 buy ins a night for weeks,  borrow from loan sharks to show up at again and ship all that and then go on the sheet. Then go home and scrap loose change up till they have $63.12 than drive an hour+ to the casino with a scenario in their head where they roll the $63 to $30,000. These are the guys we would cater too."

Also the casinos were great places to meet interested folks if your personable enough, owners ued to give out money and send the dealers to play and recruit.

AMA,3dkk0n,platypus-observer,2,Fri Jul 17 02:09:59 2015 UTC,"I've been raised very liberally and the college I attend is super liberal and understanding of LGBTQ individuals, so I don't factor that into my depression as much. If I weren't raised in such an environment, I'm sure I'd feel otherwise. In regard to the Supreme Court ruling, I'm happy that steps are being taken but overall still disappointed with the treatment of LGBTQ people in the country. Progress is progress, but I hope this isn't used as an excuse to stop further progress.  And I'm doing better, although my depression is episodic. I was in a suicidal state for a while, but I recently came out of that and am trying to work to keep myself in a positive place.  EDIT: In addition, it's also important to be able to laugh off insults (speaking directly to the LGBTQ aspect). For instance, if you notice the homophobe that asked if I've ""tried a gay treatment facility"", I'm able to laugh at that person's ignorance and bigotry instead of become offended by it."

AMA,3dhwyn,sweater_enthusiast,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:08:34 2015 UTC,"Well, I think you have to decide between studying something interesting or studying something that gives you an interesting job afterwards.   To my mind most media-related Bachelors are not specified enough. Which means you learn a lot about various stuff but you don't really learn anything in detail. This can be really fun but if you want to get a job later it can be difficult because they are searching for Designers or Video-Producers or Music-Managers or Public Relation Experts or whatever. So you might choose a subject to study which is very specific, it will help you to get a good job later."

AMA,3dhwyn,cmad182,1 point,Thu Jul 16 12:30:57 2015 UTC,"I use to get panic attacks when I have to do things I'm afraid of. In addition I'm afraid of a lot more things than 'normal' people. So I'm getting anxious very often and mostly when other people would say that there's no reason for it.  For example: When I go to a restaurant/bar and sit down to order food or sth, my body is starting to get hot and cold, my hands start to shake, I'm feeling dizzy, I'm getting the worst stomach pain and mostly diarrhea. When it gets really worse I start crying and have to leave immediately. So I'm not going to any restaurants anymore.  The reason for it is that I can't handle situations where I'm not able to leave when I want to. My body can't stand if I'm dependent on someone or something. It was also the reason why I couldn't work for a long time. If I know that I have to stay for quite a long time at the same place I'm getting a panic attack. Because I'm so scared that something could happen and I can't leave.   It's extremely hard to explain this in english :D So I hope you might understand why I'm trying to say."

I mean, I won't say it doesn't happen, I also caught myself being bitchy to a patient, because I've had a bad day, but I must say that, we usually are pretty quick to see if any of us has a bad day and we intervene. But never do we restrain patiwlents or sedate them or anything similiar, because of a bad day. There are 4 nurses on the unit and we all have to be in agreement that the patient is in need of such a radical treatment, so this is really taken care of."

We spend so much charting, writting, describing, reporting, analizing, preparing meds ... that we spend too litle time with the patients.  The first step would obviously be employing more people, and then there should be things like, extended vacations in the summer, because we only get 12 days and that's that. Then, the clinic should take care of our physical health, for example, we could have a fitness where we would go after a long day to burn some of the stress away. There is also food, they should provide us wth at lieast one meal per work day, just so we don't have to worry at home as to what are we going to eat at the job.

AMA,3ddumy,weareyourfamily,32,Thu Jul 16 03:43:43 2015 UTC,"There's a lot of crazy stuff going on! We have restrained patients, patients with severe schizophrenia, mania ... the craziest thing I witnessed was probably a patient, who was very agitated, she started screaming, spitting anf hitting the staff out of the blue. She had to be restrained by 6 nurses (2 male nurses also) and was imidately heavily sedated. The most disturbing thing to me is still watching the patients with sevete hallucinations talking to themselves and being frightened by the voices they hear. I feel sorry for them, but there is only so much you can do, aside from medicating them. There was also a patient who, when holding a conversation, wouldn't blink or look away from your eyes. It was extremely unsettling. (Sorry for my English, not a native speaker)."
AMA,3ddumy,thestraightarrow,5,Wed Jul 15 14:48:47 2015 UTC,Can you elaborate more on what you see about the people with voices that it is the most disturbing to you? I used to have voices during a drug induced psychosis that lasted something like a year.
AMA,3ddumy,Moxiecodone,17,Wed Jul 15 15:51:10 2015 UTC,"Well, I should probably put it this way; if the patient is only hearing voices and if they know, that the voices are part of an illness, they are usually relaxed about it and they tend to be more at peace and at ease.  If the patient has severe case of hearing voices/seeing things/distorted reallity, thigs get more complicated. If they are not aware of their illness or of the illness is so severe, that they can't tell it apart from reality, they can be so locked away in their own world, that you can't even comunicate properly. I remember two cases, that really shook me.  The first one was, when I only started and happened in a men's ward. There was a boy, 3 years older than me, who had drug induced psychosis so severe, that he had to be restrained for nearly 2 days. When I was talking to him, he kept thniking that I'm only there to kill him and he pleaded that I make it quick and painless. It broke my heart, but thankfully, when the drugs finally stopped working he was completely different person and even apologised to me for the way he behaved :) Then, the second case, which I found way more disturbing, was a girl, also 3 years older, who's been battling schizophrenia for the bigger part of her life. She had so many voices that it was extremely hard to comunicate with her. Like, I asked her if she had any sort of a diet, so we could feed her properly and she said 'yes', looked away, said 'no' then laughed and said 'yes' again. She than started arguing with the voice. She was constantly looking for the source of the voices, or keeping her head low and trying to ignore the evil voices. It was painfuly sad to watch, but if the schizophrenia is drug resistant - there is only so much you can do."
AMA,3ddumy,cucumbinator123,7,Wed Jul 15 16:19:06 2015 UTC,"Thank you for responding!  My psychosis started in my senior year after a mushroom trip. It lasted about a year, I would come in and out of it often. I was originally to be diagnosed with something else (doctor suggested paranoid schizophrenia) because of the length for which I was experiencing everything that I was. The worst it got was when I almost staked a kid laying down in a park because I thought he was a vampire. I wanted to hear your experiences or feelings about seeing someone that deeply immersed in their voices, because there were times I could not see any difference between reality and what was going on in my mind. Very scary times, i'm glad people like you exist to help the mentally ill.. I have a whole new respect and understanding for that world after my experiences. They shaped who I am today."

It gave me the sense of purpose and like I had come there for a reason, this teenager was the only person in the park at 8am.. it was also a very apocalyptic, misty morning that fit into him being someone evil. I had visible hallucinations too, but not with this vampire incident. Just before I visited the park and almost staked the teenager who was sleeping I had drove to a girl I had a crush on.. I believed she was expecting me (because of voices, 'feelings'), which she wasn't, and when I knocked on the door I was hallucinating that she was a decaying form of herself. Like, I could see parts of her skeleton and she was very... dead/zombie looking. It scared me, but when she came more into the sunlight it disappeared.  When I would hallucinate it was a lot of psychedelic distortions. Orbs, moving ground, disappearing forms, I believe there were some people I talked to or met that.. didn't exist.. which still sucks to think of."

The only time I was committed to a psyche ward was after I had a scared delusion that my brother was coming to kill me once he got home. His voice was in my head, mad at me for the way everything was, how I couldn't do anything right, had fucked up the world, and now it was his duty to kill me so everything would stop. When he came home, as soon as I heard his key enter the door.. I jumped out of my window in my boxers and ran faster than i've ever ran lol. That night is what scared my mom enough to take me in."

AMA,3ddumy,LowPriorityGangster,1 point,Thu Jul 16 05:05:17 2015 UTC,"I did not know that. People say anything is possible, but they don't literally believe that. In my mental illness, I did. When you are mentally ill, severely so, anything is fair game. Impulsive thoughts are on the table as something worth following because you create a meaning for everything you experience, especially the thoughts in your head. For me, I was desperately making connections to make sense of my world again. In my mind reality as I knew it was a complete and total lie, everything I had experienced showed me the ""the truth"" and I was going to pursue it to the very end. I believed everything was real, you just had to know what people had been talking about. I believed everything in fiction had a source in reality. So, when I heard my brother telling me (in my head) why this teenaged kid was laying down in a park at 8am all by himself on a very apocalyptic looking morning.. I believed the voice. Nobody else was in this park, and a teenager was sleeping on the ground there? He had his arms folded while laying on his back, hands balled into a fist with his thumbs inside of them. Sleeping. Like a board.   The context might help you understand how this stuff happens. I always juggled caution and sanity with extremely manic patterns of thought."
AMA,3ddumy,Shucklezzz,1 point,Thu Jul 16 06:11:31 2015 UTC,Could you comment on what drug it was that induced a 2 day psychotic episode? I am very curious about how much can be attributed to the drugs themselves and how much is actually the result of underlying medical/mental illness. What insights can you give for whether these people would have experienced psychosis no matter what... or if it was ONLY brought on by the use of drugs?  Which drugs are the most common for causing psychosis? How effective are the medications you use to counteract psychosis? What is the long term prognosis for someone who has presented with a severe psychotic break?
AMA,3ddumy,Shucklezzz,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:42:34 2015 UTC,"It was a new syntethic drug, but the pt was unsure of the name, I believe it's called Penthadron? The amount of drugs also contributes to the onset and duration of psychosis. You should know that, there are a lot of circumstances that contribute to mental illness. Genetics play a big role, also your past experiences, childhood (Freud had a point), the environmnet you live in ...And of course, the various substance abuse. There are still a lot of researches going on, on how much the drugs contribute to the onset of psychosis and other mentall illness. I believe that, even if you have all the other factors for the mental illness, but lead a healthy and happy life you have a good chance that the illness won't show itself, or if it does, it won't be as severe as it could be. But every individual functions in their own way and psychiatry is still not researched enough to be 100% sure on anything. The problem today is also that, there are so many drugs, containing so many chemichals, that are not supposed to be in your body, and they can mess up your brain pretty bad for life. So I do believe that some psychoses are brought on only by drugs, but these are not very common, I think.  The medications we use to counteract psychosis are more effective in illness that are not brought on by drugs. There is also a lot of biochemistry and physiology going on here. If you use drugs regulary, you burn the receptors in your body, on wich the medication should work, so they have a hard work reparing the damage. As for the prognosis of a psychotic break. If the onset of psychosis was sudden and quick, the prognosis is way better. It often happens that the person suffers only from one episode and then never again, but if the onset was slow and the symptoms started long before anybody suspected anything, the prognosis is worse, and there's a good chance that the person will have to be medicated for life. The drugs that most commonly cause psychosis are hallucinogens, like mushrooms, weed with a high concentration of THC and new synthetic drugs."

AMA,3ddumy,SkyPork,1 point,Thu Jul 16 09:09:11 2015 UTC,"The drug that set my psychosis in motion was psilocybin, ""gold-cap"" mushrooms.

I'll do an AMA if people are really curious. There is a whole year of funny, sad, and scary stories for me to write about.

AMA,3ddumy,Jacksonspace,3,Wed Jul 15 20:09:40 2015 UTC,If I may - 7-y-psych nurse here. Best advice I usually give: don´t play a role you can´t completely fill. psychiatric patients are generally very keen observers and very good at pointing out inconsistencies. And they don´t need more distance from the observeable reality than they already experience.
AMA,3ddumy,Jacksonspace,2,Wed Jul 15 20:15:21 2015 UTC,"Yes, that too! Thank you!"
AMA,3ddumy,sje46,2,Thu Jul 16 06:14:52 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your question! There are really not any guidelines for this. You should know that every individual is different and everyone is dealing with an illness in their own way. And the illness manifests in different ways. First, you should know that, no matter how ill, no matter how strange or scary or disturbing those people seem to you, they are exactly that; people. With their own troubles and worries and blessings and happines. Sadly, so many healthy people forget that there is a thin line between health and illnes and I've seen so many prejudices towards mentally ill people that it breaks my heart. There is still a stigma sorounding these people, and we have to work together to show the world that they are not dangerous or even stupid as I've heard before. You should treat them with the same respect and kindness that you would treat me or your friends. You should not be afraid of them. I hear so many stories, involving violent mentally ill people that it's just so sad. The TV isn't helping either. They are usually not violent, they are not scary. IF they happen to be violent is because of their illness. If they are scary, it's probably because they have a hard time telling reality from their illness, and the only way they don't feel vulnerable is hiding behind the mask of toughnes. Also, they are only violent in acute phases of their ilnesses, at which you probably won't be allowed to see them.  The next thing you should know, that nnot every one has the energy to function in every day life. It's sometimes hard for them to just get up in the morning, so don't judge if they don't have clean clothes, if they smell a bit ... They are not lazy, they are ill.  It's sometimes hard for them to hold a proper conversation, so be patient. This is the most important advice that I can give you. Talk to them normaly, like you would to anyone, but if you see them becoming confused or if their attention is driffting away, you should know that they are either sedated or are having a hard time following your words. Don't lose your patience, repeat a question if necesary, but if they don't want to answer - move on. If you see they don't understand -  slow down. But never or a minute think that they are stupid. Even if you talk to a patient in a catatonic state, from whom you won't get any response, know that, they are aware of their soroundings and they will remember the way you talked to them.  Also, some people like to be touched, some don't. Perhaps all somebody is craving is a human touch and a hug and someone other is scared to death of being touched by another human being. Respect their distance, they'll show you how they feel.  I hope I roughly answered your question, if I remember anthing else, I'll add!"
AMA,3ddumy,zp3wpd,2,Thu Jul 16 07:53:25 2015 UTC,"There is one thing in common that transcends social interactions between both victims of psychosis due to drug use and psychosis due to mental illness and that is a sense that you are willing to cross boundaries. Whether you are dealing with someone who is ill due to drug use or due to an underlying mental illness, you must present yourself as someone who is open to any and all viewpoints. Whatever it is that they may present to you as reality you must parse into a form that you can RELATE to. Your reaction should be one of acceptance and THEN you can challenge their perception. As long as you acknowledge that some portion of their belief system is valid they will respect you and this will open them up to being receptive to your own ideas.  My only other advice is that you should try to seek out experiences that alter your own consciousness so that you will have a more substantial platform to base your own philosophy on. It really doesn't matter what religion you subscribe to, every one of them always has a history of people altering their own consciousness using various methods as a vehicle to expand their understanding. It's entirely natural to seek out outside stimulus in an effort to better understand the reality that we all inhabit."

AMA,3ddumy,AllisonRages,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:57:44 2015 UTC,"I work in a hospital cafeteria, and the mental patients eat the same crappy (but healthyish) food as all the other patients.  Only thing is that they're not usually on special diets, and the unit apparently doesn't care what their patients eat, so a few of them will order something like meatloaf, and macaroni and cheese, and a cheeseburger, and a soup, and a salad, and two deserts, etc, for one meal.  And they WILL complain if something is missing.  They all eat communally and finish early, and the nurses/techs will count all the silverware to make sure none of them sneak a plastic knife.  Mental patients also do not get regular plates and silverware or soda cans, etc."
AMA,3ddumy,discofreak,5,Thu Jul 16 06:12:58 2015 UTC,"You mentioned you see patients on the street sometimes ... what's a locked ward, then? I assumed it meant patients aren't free to leave.   Also, how often are patients having sex there? How about your fellow nurses? I've read that it happens way more often than we'd think."
AMA,3ddumy,Thanks-Alot-Lincoln,5,Thu Jul 16 02:02:41 2015 UTC,"Well, the patients are locked only for a few days in most cases. When the acute phase pases they are transfered to open wards, where they can leave and come back at will, also, when the illness is under control they can go back to their old life if this is possible. Since I live in a small country in Europe it's hard to completely avoid them."
AMA,3ddumy,JesteroftheApocalyps,3,Wed Jul 15 18:55:35 2015 UTC,"As for the sex thing, I haven't heard of a nurse ever having sex with a patient or a member of the staff. I mean, we have a few married couples among the staff, but that's about that.  Patients can have sex, which is becoming a bit of a problem, because girls often get pregnant and they are in no way fit to care for a child. There are few cases of pregnancies a year."

AMA,3ddumy,frigofflayhey1,0,Fri Jul 17 17:08:19 2015 UTC,"We usually wake the patients up at 7am, tell them to go shower, beacuse that's the only time we unlock the showers. Then at 8am there is breakfast, ater that medication. The doctor has individual conversations with every patient during the morning, while the rest o them are 'free' to hang out, watch the TV, read, draw ... or use the computer for a short time. Then after the lunch there is not so much to do, really. We don't have therapeutic groups, since our patients are usually unable to remain concentrated for long periods of time. They get medicatons up to three times a day, four meals. They are sleepng and resting a lot. They don't have that much to do, since they are only allowed to have very few things on them (some clothes and candies if they want, but anything that can be used in self-harming/suicide/anything relatabe has to go). I'm not sure what you mean by free reign - the are free to walk the halls, if that's what you're asking, but they can't leave the ward. We have some rules that they have to respect, which involves not going to the men's ward and being nice to other patients and staff and jsut generally acting like a nice human being."
AMA,3ddumy,wefearchange,2,Thu Jul 16 02:04:50 2015 UTC,Have you ever had any seriously concerning interactions with patients? As in you thought you could potentially be in harms way from something that triggers them?

AMA,3ddumy,frigofflayhey1,4,Wed Jul 15 22:41:41 2015 UTC,"I'd say quite a few, especially among the male population. But drug induced psychoses tend to be mote treatable than the other kind, so the stay is usually shorter and they are hospitalised once, whereas there are patients who have been hospitalised 200 times in their life."

I was checking out our website and you can do searches by death age, death year, and so on. I stumbled upon young triplets all in one space, and it was fairly recent. I asked my coworker about it, and she said that a mother miscarried triplets maybe 6 months in or so. The babies were so tiny they all fit inside this little vault we have (Stillborn Vault) and they were buried next to their 20 y.o. uncle, who had died of an illness (I think it was cancer but it wasn't listed in the database). So, while I didn't witness it, I am aware of who the family is and where the kids are buried."
AMA,3di0ub,kaybeesam,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:48:54 2015 UTC,"There were also a string of young adult deaths (20s) by overdose that happened about two years ago when some laced heroin was going around, and that psyched me out because they were around my age."
AMA,3di0ub,trouty07,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:50:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah that's sad. I've actually been researching through funeral records over the past few weeks and COD used to be listed on them until about 1980. Some really sad stories in there. There are some stories that stuck with me. There are only a few notes taken about the deceased: place of birth, cod, place of death..etc. but you can get a lot of their story out of that. I came across a murder-suicide two weeks ago. There are so many suicides that you never hear about (I was finding between 10-20 per year for a town with not that big of a population). It really freaked me out when I saw people who were my age that died (mostly freak accidents or drownings, and health conditions). It really puts your life into perspective. Does your job affect you emotionally?"
AMA,3di0ub,trouty07,2,Thu Jul 16 14:01:45 2015 UTC,"Sometimes. That day where I found all of those deaths was tough, and sometimes when I'm working a burial I see a lot of extremely emotional family members, and I tend to get a little over empathetic and tear up. Also, taps and the gun salute. A lot of my deceased family members were veterans, so I can't hear/see military services without getting a little tight in the chest :'( But it's also why I love my job, because I feel like I get to connect with these families and help them navigate all the crap you have to wade through when someone passes (hence why people should pre-arrange, btw)"

I honestly don't have a problem with them, as a guy they're pretty much like wearing boxer shorts and an under shirt, which a lot of guys wear anyway. As I said earlier, I took a ""break"" from Mormonism to experience other Christian and non-Christian religions. In my experience Mormonism is one of the more ""extreme"" sects of Christianity (yes, we consider ourselves Christian) in that our devotion to Christ goes way above and beyond going to church or taking ""his name upon us"". Wearing the garment is one of those outward reminders of His sacrifice for us."

I like causally making fun of my forman ( although we have a great realtionship, who knows I wont say anything about him I wouldn't say to his face. and he knows that. )  I try to keep it 75/25 over the radio, between serious and joking.  it blows, it's a boring job, that you get alot of hate from, but its also important and should be treated as such."

Happiness, peace, a sense of accomplishment.   So think of all those things in your life that make you feel happy, peaceful and accomplished.  My question is this: If you had to choose between having all of those things (your partner, your money, your reputation, your dreams, ect.) but being unhappy or losing it all and finding happiness and peace, which would you choose?

For some inexplicable reason, I just happened to think about that word for a while and it sounded like it wasn't even English after reading it in my head. Then I started smiling because I realized that random rhymes with fandom (idk why I would find that funny, I just spontaneously start smiling when I think about things - just another one of my idiosyncrasies). The chain continued, with each thing I thought of leading to another random thought. I must have gone through at least 20 different topics in a matter of 10 seconds.  Now, imagine doing this whenever you see something that catches your eye - like an oddly shaped plant or a really smooth coat of peanut butter. It's not at all random to you since it's all in your head, but other people will start giving you funny looks (generally strangers as my friends and family are used to - and thoroughly exasperated - by my random weirdness). Especially when you start putting a used bowl in the refrigerator instead of washing it. Or tripping on a rock and knocking the books out of your friend's hands, while grabbing then for support, and all because you were fixated on how you could have phrased your essay on corruption in the Great Gatsby better."

Our own lives are governed by both ourselves and everything around us, with everything acting according to a set of natural laws.

This is only based on probability, however, as it's entirely plausible I could die before doing either of these two things. But since it's impossible to completely isolate myself from any surroundings, my life is also dependent on factors of a larger magnitude, such as war, financial status, physical state, etc. Life itself is incredible and awe-inducing because our individual lives are not inherently meaningful. Meaning is created through our dynamic relationship with everything around us."

The worst ones were the people who'd kludged together two atvs or bikes into one mutant and couldn't remember if they needed something from the honda side or kawasaki.

If the automotive side of the house is anything like outdoor motors, 7/10 people don't know what model their car is, let alone engine displacement. I always told people to keep a sticky note in the storage under the seat on their atv with serials/VINs, year, make, model, engine, and to write down any part numbers on a longer sheet of paper as they replace things.

I majored in econ at a state university and have taken (and continue to take) a lot of CS classes at my local community college, but don't have a CS degree and don't want to go back for another round of time-wasting gen-eds and a second degree.

My scope has good optics, but design of scope is not very good. It's very difficult to ajust optics and it takes a lot of time. I have 25mm, 15mm and 10mm eyepieces and 2x Barlow lens. It makes possible 76x, 126x, 152x, 190x, 252x and 380x zoom. But two last are unusable (too blurry) because of diffraction limit of aperture. My previous scope was 3,5"" DeepSky 90/900.

They were looking for my husband's ex wife. We had no idea where she was, or what city she was even in. We didn't have her phone number. We told them all of that.  Then they called the next day, asking the same questions.   And the next day.  And the next day.  And the next six months, 1-3 times a day, until we finally unplugged our landline.   Then they found my husband's cell number. And they called that for months. Once they even got nasty and said we knew where she was and we were protecting her. Told us to stop lying and tell them where she was.  Now I just get a letter from them once a week, at least, asking me to sign up for a Capital One card. I've started collecting each card they mail me to send back to them in one of their prepaid envelopes.   I guess my question is...Capital One...why do you hate us?"
AMA,3dbyc2,Tport17,7,Wed Jul 15 05:09:49 2015 UTC,"Wow I am sorry that happened to you. Actually your situation seemed very common when I was working. We would search out said person in debt. If there was any trace from a spouse parent or friend we would lock their account info in our system and the automated dialer (well at least the one we had)) would call constantly. I would call people 3 times a day sometimes. Even those that have made a payment smh.   As for the hate thing I think its just the dialer itself.

Tiffany who works 12 hour days, will now receive calls constantly throughout the day looking for Bob. Once Tiffany states that this isn't his phone ((most people, not I)) would leave it in to harass her to get in contact with him. Also the system doesn't update if you change your number since its a manual thing, some people grasp the concept of it being someone, but we aren't allowed to delete the number because we need some sort of contact info. It sucks because the dialer would constantly call these innocent people on the behalf of someone they don't know.."

Then when I learn the system completely you could clearly ser that majority of these reports where bluntly false. Even if someone stole the card, why not report it?  Well my agency handle accounts 6-12 months behind ((IIRC)) So majority would just hang up and ignore making any sort of payment. It was rare to get someone to pay the balance because it would be so high. If they where able to it wad because they owned some sort of business, had someone handle there debts in which was forgotten to be payed, or literally max the card and wait until tax time to build it up in an attempt to boost their credit score. Outside of those two groups everyone else would beg for a minimum payment, in which we would agree to wipe ONE fee off the account if they committed to it."

Having said that, I've always found that the most direct route to making money with mortgages is developing trust and then delivering the right loan for a borrower.  Sometimes the line can get a little blurry with the underwriting of a loan (ex: w-2 or pay stubs that look odd I might choose not to investigate for fear of learning something that would kill a deal)."
AMA,3debhs,bioton4,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:01:50 2015 UTC,what state/area do you work in? are you making the same amount of $ as pre 2007 or more $ now? do you think we're in another bubble? or this time more stable bubble?
AMA,3debhs,donkey_democrat,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:33:54 2015 UTC,"I'm in the Northeastern US.  I make more now than I did then, 2 reasons; It's mainly due to restructuring my team and dropping a partner that was dead weight,  there was a lot of dead weight around pre 2007.  But it's also because the barriers to entry to become a loan officer are extremely high now.  It would be very very difficult for someone to graduate college and go become a licensed loan officer.  It's hard for someone to jump from selling cars to selling mortgages.  So, as the years go by more and more people leave the industry and there is very little entry into the sales side of things.  I think any market that is tax payer subsidized is a bubble if the potential exists for that subsidy to end.  Housing is subsidized through federal guarantees of the majority of mortgage backed securities.  This brings interest rates down because it reduces risk to anyone investing in those securities.  If/when that ends we are going to see an impact on housing.    How drastic?  I'm not sure.  Depends on how private market lending responds, and that's hard to predict because; Since 2007 private lending has been only a sliver of the marketplace because it is impossible to compete with the artificially low interest rates offered on government backed loans.  So there is no real attempt by the market to compete.  Once, and only if, the gov't gets out of rate and risk subsidizing will we see what happens in the private market.  If the response is strong, then it will not be a bad adjustment, but if it isn't then it could be ugly.    This is a somewhat simplified explanation, there are also new regulations that appear on the surface to protect consumers but have a high risk of limiting open market efforts.  This, in the end, could prove to be more harmful to consumers than protective by limiting the private lending re-entry and thus worsening a bubble burst effect."

But then I realize what I would be like if I never would have started taking them, and I'm pretty content I'm on it now. The mental hospital was very difficult to get used to, and it's more of a prison than a mental hospital. I'm a minor so I wasn't treated too well, but most adults who understood my pain treated me with respect and treated me like a normal person. It's nothing like a hospital. You have a roommate in a generic, suicide/weapon proof room that you can go in and out of during free time. Other times during the day you're either eating, at gym, or at group therapy. It was really difficult for me to get used to, and I was throwing up and trembling with anxiety my first two days until I settled in and made some friends. It's really sort of humbling. In a mental facility there is no social status. You're all the same. It was a fairly interesting experience and I wouldn't be too hesitant if you consider admitting yourself.

AMA,3da0l3,MSsucks,12,Tue Jul 14 21:27:46 2015 UTC,"So DBT was developed specifically for people with BPD by a woman psychologist named Marsha Linehan, who herself is diagnosed with BPD.  For what it's worth, it has a degree of empirical evidence towards better emotional regulation for folks with BPD. It's a modified form of CBT that also has a strong mindfulness and distress tolerance component to it. One of the basic ideas of DBT is combining the ideas of both developing a sense of radical self-acceptance, & a desire for growth and change.  That's really sad that your therapist and psychiatrist has never mentioned it. My suggestion to you is to bring it up. Unless they have a VERY good reason as to why they think it's a bad idea (and I can't even really fathom why), it's time to find a new therapist. You want someone who give you treatment that is best for you."
AMA,3da0l3,excel958,2,Tue Jul 14 21:36:29 2015 UTC,"I have bipolar/ptsd and agoraphobia. DBT has, literally, saved my life on multiple occasions. You develop the skills to handle situations positively and make better decisions. I would recommend taking it. As a matter of fact, I think everyone should go through DBT around the puberty age. It's an amazing set of skills for going through life's challenges."
AMA,3da0l3,SumDankKush_,2,Thu Jul 16 15:18:58 2015 UTC,"Tbh I don't think a university therapy center may give you the care you need. What credentials or type of licensure does your therapist have? A lot of therapists at university therapy centers are interns, and that is not what you need. You need someone with a little more expertise."
AMA,3da0l3,bondfrenchbond,2,Tue Jul 14 21:41:10 2015 UTC,I could not agree more. I think the one's at my school are indeed interns. The one asked to record me as part of her training. I was required to go though as a condition with my school. Not much came out of it.
AMA,3da0l3,c4virus,5,Wed Jul 15 04:26:52 2015 UTC,"When did you first discover that you had anxiety and panic attacks? How old were you, what triggered your first panic attack, what does it feel like when you get the feeling of disembodiment?"
AMA,3da0l3,c4virus,9,Tue Jul 14 17:59:49 2015 UTC,"I don't remember much because I was young, but I do remember having one as early as the first grade. Most of the triggers were environmental such as stress. A lot was expected out of me and I would breakdown. Some times I don't know the triggers are, I just feel overly emotional and on edge a lot of the time.  Its random.  Disembodiment is hard to explain, and the best way I can say is like you're all in your head, but your body is gone. Or even better that feeling of being really high (from pot) and you forget where you are minus the euphoria. It's really weird, and distracting. I can't control it that well as far as coming out of it. Its a lot like day dreaming in the moment."
AMA,3da0l3,racheljoy08,2,Tue Jul 14 18:11:38 2015 UTC,Were you a premature baby by any chance?
AMA,3da0l3,ultrabangorangutan,3,Tue Jul 14 20:44:23 2015 UTC,Nope
AMA,3da0l3,ultrabangorangutan,4,Tue Jul 14 21:18:40 2015 UTC,"I read that mindfulness can help and am trying to help my sister who I'm 99% sure has BPD to use mindfulness as a tool to help her not get trapped by her emotions and thoughts.  She lives with me, is 17, and can be very difficult at times.  My question is do I call her out on her behavior or just let it go?  She'll say semi-mean things sometimes, and if we question her behavior she just goes into a state of justification where she won't even come close to admitting being at fault.  Even if we do it non-confrontational she is almost impossible to get to, although it does help to be very calm when addressing it.  Any advice?"
AMA,3da0l3,excel958,3,Tue Jul 14 20:49:47 2015 UTC,"I would suggest the two of you going to therapy. It's what helped me. Before I was less willing to admit I was wrong. The more people who told me, the more I realized I had to take personal responsibility. So don't let it go, but don't be harsh and punishing. It will only make her more hostile, and upset."
AMA,3da0l3,ultrabangorangutan,2,Tue Jul 14 21:26:19 2015 UTC,"Good advice, thank you."
AMA,3da0l3,excel958,5,Tue Jul 14 21:31:20 2015 UTC,I'm very surprised your dr hasn't mentioned DBT to you. Please look into it and find a dr or counsellor understands and supports it. How old are you?
AMA,3da0l3,ultrabangorangutan,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:27:07 2015 UTC,I definitely will and 21.
AMA,3da0l3,excel958,8,Wed Jul 15 04:27:14 2015 UTC,"I sincerely hope you seek out professional help and make an honest effort to try and better yourself.  I was in a romantic relationship with a woman who suffers from BPD for 2.5 years, and I broke it off 7 months ago.  That relationship was one of the most devastating experiences of my life (I'm 26 now) - mentally, emotionally, physically and spiritually.  She wasn't diagnosed until 1.5 years into the relationship, after she was held for a 24 hour psychiatric evaluation following winding up in the ER for a staging a suicide attempt.  Yes, you read that correctly.  She staged a suicide attempt and the ER doctors had quantifiable proof to back up their claims.  I thought I could help her, that maybe now that we had a diagnosis that we could make positive progress.  But she wasn't even capable of that, she had her own agenda and used her diagnosis for all sorts of drug seeking behavior.  She used her 'suicide' attempt as a way to come clean and truthful about some things.  She had cheated on me multiple times, she purposely alienated me from people I loved and cared about for no reason other than she wanted to see me in pain.  Three months into dating we were drinking w/ each other and I blacked out for 10+ hours.  When I snapped out of the blackout, she was accusing me of beating her, although she didn't have a mark on her.  She admitted to me after the 'suicide' attempt that she had slipped crushed Xanax pills into one of my drinks she had prepared for me, that she intentionally blacked me out and that I didn't actually lay a finger on her - I just fell asleep.  But she accused me so that she could blackmail me, ruin my reputation amongst friends and so that she'd have leverage if I ever tried to leave her.  These are just a small sample of the horror stories I went through with her.  The craziest part is that before she framed me for beating her, I thought she was the sweetest, nicest, most unique person I had ever met.  She was my soulmate.  The most soul-crushing part about it all is that those good, fleeting moments were all fake.  She saw me as a target that she could warp and use to her ends, that's all I ever was to her.  7 months later I still have serious trust issues with every single person I meet; I'm terrified that I could end up in that situation again.  Happened once, it could happen again, right?  I'll never forget the hollow, dead look in her eyes when I finally broke it off with her.  Some people just want to watch the world burn."
AMA,3da0l3,Blabajif,9,Tue Jul 14 19:32:03 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry that happened to you, and while I have heard of some horror stories about other Borderline people, just know that this is not all people. For example, I do not date anymore because when I do I become extremely jealous and clingy. However, I've never cheated on anyone or used suicide as a threat (I've been with someone for two years longest). Most of the men I chose to date however are much like myself or my parents- either self destructive or abusive. I would like to think of the psycho woman who cheats on her man as a stereotype, as most of us are compulsive but act differently with dating."
AMA,3da0l3,ultrabangorangutan,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:05:21 2015 UTC,"Thanks and I'm aware that not all people w/ personality disorders are like this.  There are spectrums and whatnot, I'm sure my ex was on an extreme end of the spectrum for her disorder.  It's unfortunate that you don't date, but I for sure can understand where you're coming from.  I honestly think that if my ex makes an honest effort to get better that she could have fulfilling relationships.  I'm sure you can too, although the road there will probably be a tough one.  Sounds like you're approaching your issues with a very mature attitude.  Feel free to PM me if you ever want to talk about anything, I wouldn't mind giving you some of my time if it means that we could prevent another person going through what I did."
AMA,3da0l3,wkpaccount,2,Tue Jul 14 20:22:28 2015 UTC,No problem
AMA,3da0l3,ultrabangorangutan,4,Tue Jul 14 21:20:19 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry you had such a horrible experience. In no way, shape, or form do I want to minimize the level of suffering you had to go through with all of this, nor do you deserve any of that. I hope that you are in a much healthier place right now.  But do you really feel like she was a cold-hearted psychopath who wanted to watch the world burn? The way I'm looking at it, if the BPD diagnosis is true, then a lot of her behaviors seem to be derived out of an intense fear of you leaving her--a fear that is quite common among folks with BPD. I would imagine in her mind, no amount of talk or discussion between you two would alleviate that fear in her. So in her world, drastic means were the only way."
AMA,3da0l3,DiscGolfFreak,6,Tue Jul 14 21:29:28 2015 UTC,"I think that she was/has been on a downward spiral for longer than most people could probably imagine.  I'll never forget the day that I stopped finding her attractive.  No matter how ugly she was on the inside, I always thought she was very beautiful from a physical perspective.  Blonde hair, blue eyes, petite and thin.  We were sitting having coffee and out of nowhere she starts ranting about how she just hates everyone and everything, that she tries to be mean to people 24/7 because she enjoys watching people feel bad.  Her eyes never looked so cold and hollow before that moment and not only did I lose my attraction for her, I thought she was repulsive.  Simply being in her presence and breathing the same air as her made me sick to my stomach.  This was towards the end of it all, and I knew she wasn't just having a bad day or something.  She was describing her philosophy of life to me and I knew it was real because I lived it with her.  That being said, I think that actions speak louder than words.  Maybe she was being drastic and it made sense to her, but it doesn't excuse her actions.  She was abusive and made no attempt to try and get better.  She would often justify her actions by arguing that she couldn't be held accountable given her disorder.  I think that you can only make that argument when you are making a sincere effort to get better, which she was not doing.  So yes, I do think she was a cold-hearted person who wanted the watch the world burn.  This isn't to say that all borderlines are like my ex.  /u/TameOranges is an example of that.  She is aware of her problems and from what I gather in the comments in this thread, she is trying her best to improve her situation for herself and for other people."
AMA,3da0l3,DiscGolfFreak,2,Tue Jul 14 21:45:35 2015 UTC,"That's fair. It's truly unfortunate she didn't make any sincere efforts to get better. Absolutely does not excuse anything, and it most certainly is abuse that nobody deserves.  Shit. I'm so sorry. =("
AMA,3da0l3,DiscGolfFreak,2,Tue Jul 14 21:49:20 2015 UTC,"Thanks, but please don't be sorry.  I'm not here looking for sympathy.  Just sharing my experiences as they relate to the thread.  I was down for a long time, but I'm slowly starting to feel like myself again."

AMA,3da0l3,aspirinmermaid,2,Wed Jul 15 17:12:42 2015 UTC,It's rough that you had such a bad time with your ex. But a personality disorder doesn't define a person or predispose them to being abusive. I really don't see the relevance of your post in this thread.
AMA,3da0l3,excel958,2,Tue Jul 14 20:04:09 2015 UTC,"I disagree with you.  I 100% believe that a personality disorder is capable of defining a person and predisposing them to abuse.  Not even considering BPD, there's also narcissism, sociopathy and psychopathy, all of which are personality disorders that list various kinds of interpersonal abuses as symptoms."

In the past when dealing with things like panic attacks and what I guess is dissociation, (idk never been diagnosed) they've to me I'm just being dramatic or that it's not real. they will probably be supportive of i come to them with medical advice but it's hard being rejected and shut down"

AMA,3dc40r,Kanye-Westicle,2,Wed Jul 15 02:52:49 2015 UTC,"Why oh why do writers always follow the same cliche?, this isn't my actual question it's just to get into the topic. I am not saying you do, but my experience with horror movies/series (and I am a major horror fan) is the same plotline for the same movie over and over again.  How about writing about something completely unheard of where the threat isn't just a supernatural force chasing teenagers in a house rather truly chaotic/insane manifestations of the human psyche coming to materialization. But no, most writers follow a pattern because it sells.  The real question is this, why is there a pattern?"
AMA,3dc40r,Louayhk,1 point,Wed Jul 15 05:07:05 2015 UTC,"This is the question I ask myself every time I sit down to write an outline for my episode. Now I take a lot of inspiration from marble hornets. The biggest similarity is our style. Only I'm somehow more low budget. And sometimes, that's what sells. Now I'm not looking to sell. I'm looking to entertain. To frighten. I consider myself a success if 1 person goes to bed frightened. And you can't do that with the standard horror tropes. Jump scares, loud music, cgi, etc. I'm able to skip that because of my budget. I'm the only character because I can't afford actors. I'm not in an abandoned hospital because I can't afford it. You'll never see whats lurking in the dark because I can't afford it. And that works to my advantage. We as humans are frightened not by dolls or clowns, but ambiguity. The unknown. The hidden. And that's what I'm trying to convey. My scenes take place in my home. My house is a normal looking house. This makes you think that you could be being watched. You don't know. That's the horror. There's also the terror of spontaneity. I don't script my episodes. I have a plot for each, but I ad lib the rest. I never know what I'm going to say. And neither will you. That's what I'm about. Getting rid of cliches. And I hope to show others what true terror is. Not LOUD NOISES. But the unnatural silence. Not bright flashes, but dim rooms and dark corners."

OR you are perceived by the society as a male? The two in my mind are not related and can be independent of each.
AMA,3dcwke,FuzzyCheese,2,Wed Jul 15 18:07:38 2015 UTC,"Both? I want to both be perceived as a male by other people, and by myself and the person I'm with."

Kind of an impossible thing to know.  The best one can do is ""think"" they feel like the opposite gender, they can't know   On a biological level there is probably no difference of ""feeling"" between the two.  Culturally, there is obviously a difference."

AMA,3dcwke,FuzzyCheese,4,Wed Jul 15 11:45:57 2015 UTC,"So you were born a male, and identify as a male, and are transgendered? Also, i feel like there is trend that is mostly pushed by tumblr but still seen everywhere. I feel like with people that are not popular in their real life they go to the Internet, i think in this escape to the Internet they want a few things, the biggest being acceptance. So with that in mind do you think people so aggressively pushing for the acceptance of lgbt members you get a lot of kids (literally 12 years old) that call themselves transgendered, gay, bi, and whatever else there is to be called? It might be a bigoted way to look at it but i think you cant even know what your sexuality is until at least your late teenage years and at such a young age theyre just lying to themselves to fit in somewhere."

I was just saying that the question shouldn't be ""What do you feel that makes you deny the sex you were at birth?"" it should be ""What do you feel that makes you feel like the sex you identify as?""  There's a subtle but important difference: it's not an innate protest against their biological gender, it's an acceptance of their ""real"" gender."
AMA,3dcwke,Vadhakara,2,Wed Jul 15 14:59:41 2015 UTC,"Nice points. I think a lot of people fall into rhetorical traps and I think you're absolutely spot-on. It's important to note that 'sex' refers to biological assignment at birth, whereas 'gender' is socially constructed around sex and culture."

I don't see how you can claim membership of a group when your only claim to it is that you have a feeling that you think aligns with that group.  Personally I don't think I feel like a male or female. I just know I can observe my body and tell.

You could be doing nothing and receive all the recognition they have to offer. They take care of people in terms of health benefits. It's great that you could work here full time and pay ~$50 a month for vision/dental/health, and this is the reason why most older folk stick around. I'd say fat chance on developing. You have to know the right people for that. They have raised minimum wage within the company, so a job here beats working at fast food.

As long as you researched the company that much, prepared to answer questions that related to the company values, you'll know if you got the job.  Did I mention values? If you didn't, as long as you participate in the interview, you'll be fine. They interview when they need people.   Passing the mouth-swab drug test is the next part. Once you have your acceptance letter, they test you. Most people fail this. Actually, lots of people fail this. If you do drugs, you won't get a call back after the screening.   Once you're on payroll, it's terribly difficult to get fired unless you miss a punch or come late all the time.   So, it's just like any other company. Don't be intimidated!

You then have to walk through what they call the market place (like a walmart where you can grab little things like cutelery, lamps, kitchenwares, rugs). you then get to a big warehouse, where all those little numbers your wrote earlier gives you picking locations to take the massive flatpacks, you tend to do at least 3 laps of the warehouse as you have fogotten somthing. You then queue for another 20mins to pay. You may then escape.  THe lunch stop tends to come at the end of the showroom before the market place.  NEVER try with a child under 7 they will scream from the first hour in and make it hell!!!!!  There is a cheats mathod of looking up the warehouse locations online, then going in the exit/customer services door and getting straight into the warehouse."

AMA,3d5osz,WobblySith,2,Tue Jul 14 11:35:58 2015 UTC,"Oh my apologies. Among many other things, that's the price we pay to keep our prices cheap. Especially with our minimum wage just being raised, we keep just enough to get the job done. Upstairs we have a minimum of 3 people in every department on a slow day aside from children's. They're usually just 1 which is annoying when you are just passing through because a lot of times we don't know much about other departments just because there is so much to know.  Downstairs we have as little as 1 opener and 1 closer and they're usually busy. It stinks but it is what it is."

AMA,3d5osz,echdinadonuts,11,Mon Jul 13 21:43:42 2015 UTC,"You can. Trust me it's frustrating for us too because we don't like seeing the customers get so flustered, but there are shortcuts all over the store.   The creator of IKEA knew that the store would be overwhelming because we sell so many different things, so he did what customers think is the ""maze."" It's not meant to be that at all. It is basically going to Walmart but instead of having a big open space where you just hope you find the department you're looking for, the walls we put up are meant to make it so you never miss what you're looking for. It makes you see everything, in theory keeping the customers from asking employees for help (since it is a self serve business)  When you know exactly what you want, just walk up to a coworker, tell them what you need, and we will be glad to tell you the shortest way to get there. It's not our job to make life more difficult for anyone. Just try to ask on a weekday when it's easier for us to walk through your entire shopping list with you."

AMA,3d5osz,BigHatsAndLittleHats,4,Tue Jul 14 09:12:50 2015 UTC,"Not trying to be argumentative, just genuinely curious. Is the way your store is set up a fire hazard? What does the fire marshall say? How would you escape if there's a fire?"
AMA,3d5osz,GirlnTheOtherRm,7,Tue Jul 14 01:56:17 2015 UTC,"In the case of a fire, we are all trained to handle the situation with as much efficiency as possible. We have ""safety and security checklists"" that I am required to walk off at 10, 2, 6, and 8 to make sure that all fire escapes and everything is clear and up to code.   I don't know if you've ever been in the store during a ""Code 99"" but it is a true testament to the company's ability to alleviate a situation. That announcement means a child has been separated from the parent and the parent is looking for them. In that case every manager calls an extension and asks for a description and they sweep the floor. As of today, my store has never not been able to retrieve a child that's gone missing, and that's pretty good considering we have one of those 6 times a day sometimes (parents should invest in those embarrassing but nifty little child leashes)"
AMA,3d5osz,6581sid,2,Tue Jul 14 05:24:52 2015 UTC,I work In an aquarium and we have our way of handling a Zulu 11 (our equivalent to your code 99). All employees with a walkie have to switch to a private channel to get a description and all staff in the offices upstairs come downstairs to search for the missing child. No customers are allowed in and there is one associate standing in the exit doorway keeping an eye out for said child. We have to handle a Zulu 11 atleast 3 times a weekend

AMA,3d5osz,Hyunion,3,Tue Jul 14 04:39:58 2015 UTC,"Not to hijack OP, but he's not giving you a good enough reply. Anyways, every store is designed to have two fire exit signs in sight at any given moment. Don't believe me? Go to any market hall and just look around. You just run out like any other place if there's a fire, but there's checks done by many people. The person in charge walks the floors to see if exits are blocked, security audits extinguishers, trains others in evacuation procedures, audits common sense, managers have safety meets and addresses situations/awareness, there are huge fans that will suffocate a fire, flue spaces for sprinkler water to pour out between racking space, gates that will deploy to block/seal off corridors, emergency response team doors, alarms that go off, temperature laser beams, panic buttons, etc. I would say your life is pretty safe. After a daisy-chain of electrical cords burnt up a store several years ago, they committed to telling everyone about it. It's one of the first videos you watch during training. After that accident, IKEA became really strict on hazards/liabilities. IKEA values reflecting on past mistakes."

I used to get them after drinking alcohol and I thought they were completely normal, then they started getting increasingly more violent & frequent. Now I get them when I am sleep deprived and I can't have any alcohol at all or else I'll get the jerks the next day. It has become a source of anxiety for me and sometimes stress can trigger the jerks, and it's all just incredibly embarrassing. I know I really need to go to the doctors about this.. but can you tell me, did you find any medication that helps alleviate the jerks? Do you drink alcohol at all? Has epilepsy affected your social life and stuff? How do you explain to people you've just met about epilepsy? Is holding down a job difficult? Can you drive? (Sorry about all the questions haha)"
AMA,3dabx5,urdeadcool,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:49:01 2015 UTC,"No problem, I'm happy to answer them! I've been there, man - I'll do my best to answer everything.   I know I really need to go to the doctors about this.. but can you tell me, did you find any medication that helps alleviate the jerks?   Yes, the jerks are definitely easy to alleviate if you find the meds that work best for you. Personally, I started with Keppra which worked wonders for the myoclonic jerks but ultimately made me very depressed. I then switched to Depakote, which has worked well for years.   -Do you drink alcohol at all?  Yes, as long as I'm properly medicated, I've been given the go ahead to drink responsibly by my neurologist.   -Has epilepsy affected your social life and stuff? Only a little bit. People initially get a little freaked out, but as long as you're calm and informative about it, people are understanding.   -How do you explain to people you've just met about epilepsy? I don't instantly tell people, but probably because mine is relatively well controlled. If I think I'll be spending enough time with a person where I feel it's a risk I just let them know straight up that I have it. Then I just let them know that they can ask any questions they want about it, and what to do in instance of a seizure.  -Is holding down a job difficult? Fortunately, no. However, depending on the severity, I hear it can be.  -Can you drive?  No, this is the one thing I'm absolutely terrified of doing.  It sounds like you might have a very similar form of Epilepsy that I do, and it's very controllable. Please see a neurologist ASAP though, those jerks can turn into full tonic/clonic seizures which are not fun.  Let me know if you have any further questions! :)"

AMA,3d68wi,rampaging_moon_buggy,6,Mon Jul 13 21:22:11 2015 UTC,I honestly miss my nurses and doctors a lot! Since I was 19 I was in this weird limbo area where I could choose to be a pediatric patient or an adult one and I chose to be a pediatric patient after being an adult on for about a month because they care more when you're a kid lol but there were definitely morning I woke up to clowns or Dora the Explorer knocking at my door asking if I wanted a visit. The people that work in children's hospitals are really amazing humans.
AMA,3d68wi,rampaging_moon_buggy,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:27:29 2015 UTC,"Ha ha yeah I can totally understand you choosing the paediatric ward again. I saw a couple of teens on the ward I was on too. I was told by the nurses that paediatricans are more down to earth than other docs as the kids keep them that way. I once heard a kid bellowing from another room ""you idiot!"" ""Don't touch it you idiot!!"" I think he had a broken bone or something, and didn't appreciate the doc poking around. So many moving things too. How do you feel your experience has changed your outlook on life, if at all?"

I was suffering with terrible headaches for about 3.5 months and I just knew that they weren't normal. After 4 ER visits and 3 clinic appointments they finally decided that it would be a good idea to do a scan and it turned out not only did I have a tumor the volume of a golf ball on my skull I have 6 other tumors all over my body. When I first found out I was just mad at all the other doctors that told me that everything was okay and that I was just stressed out. I wanted to go to all of them and give them a big fuck you because they didn't think anything was wrong. By the time I was diagnosed my cancer was at stage 4."
AMA,3d68wi,rampaging_moon_buggy,2,Mon Jul 13 21:23:07 2015 UTC,Holy shit stage 4! Your story illustrates how important it is to get other opinions and not give up when you know something is wrong. Do you think your age was a factor regarding doctors insisting that 'you're ok'?

I've heard we issue around 30,000 a week, and around 3 a second, which is more than most major cities. And as a result, we generate $11 million of income annually.  Enforcement is extremely tight. Parking 12+ inches from the curb will cost you $20, unauthorized parking on private property will cost you $250, and double-parking/unauthorized handicap parking will normally cost $500 (in comparison, Los Angeles costs around $350 for the same violation)."
AMA,3d86ox,400yards,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:00:28 2015 UTC,Do you feel your just a money generator for your employer or do you think you are doing valuable work which needs to be done?
AMA,3d86ox,Mississloppysex,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:19:05 2015 UTC,"Somewhere in between. Obviously, certain parking laws actually do need to be enforced because someone's blocking traffic, preventing a handicap person from parking, blocking buses/emergency vehicles, etc. However, I am required to ticket for a multitude of extremely technical and minor offenses due to ever-increasing quotas. While obviously the government is never going to acknowledge that we're doing this to generate revenue for them, I do think that's a major factor those types of tickets."

But if I park on the street, put my flashers on and pretty much climb on the curb, a ticket always seems too find me. Just curious if they might pay the city a certain amount of money too lay off there delivery guys."
AMA,3d86ox,Rocha_999,2,Wed Jul 15 02:48:24 2015 UTC,"Not given any instruction like that. FedEx is a private company and doesn't pay the government anything. However, they normally accumulate a lot of parking tickets over the year and each year have a settlement and are given a discount on tickets because they pay it with one big check. In general, I think ticket enforcement might think that it's not worth it to ticket the truck because they're likely going to be back in the vehicle in 30 seconds."

Just some advice, I found myself in a position to move forward in life while struggling to maintain that aspect of my lifestyle. In a perfect world I would have married someone into that with an open relationship.  But in reality, my wifes personality and what she offered was too much to pass up, plus the sex was too good.  If you ever do find someone with a great personality that isn't totally into what you are, don't be afraid to give them a chance, people tend to warm up to these types of things for the ones they love and there are other outlets out there.  Now for a question, does this ever translate to relationships other than sexual ones for you?  For instance, do you like a student more (not sexually in any way of course) because they are a complete dick to you? Or do you have friends that treat you shitty sometimes but you kind of enjoy it?"

And you do have a point about me being more into people if they're a little bit of dicks, especially guys. I do have male friends that sometimes treat me shitty, and I even them, and I think it's great. I can't deal with people that are just ""too"" nice. I haven't noticed it with the kids though, but some of them are a bit sassy and I kind of like that. I've never thought of this in this context before.   All in all I like people with an edge.

Although, it depends on the modifiers. What your friend orders isn't too bad. Now someone who comes in and orders a nonfat extra dry cappuccino with 2 and a half splenda and extra whipped cream, that's when it's annoying because let me tell you, nonfat milk doesn't make very good foam.  Second, I personally don't get annoyed by it. I live in a high crime city and so sometimes we get people who threaten other customers and are creepy who've been there for hours, so we have to kick them out.

I have only a few friends that even know about it because it is a disorder that has such a negative connotation that people will act differently towards me or be afraid of me. I am a teacher (yes it is safe, I am not dangerous and would never put my kids in danger) some days are worse then others and I have had to miss work because of it. The most negative thing that happens on a regular basis is that I have a difficult time waking up, I keep dreaming when I wake up and my dreams can last for hours. It's terrifying. It's like wearing Google glasses and they play interactive videos for you and you can't take them off but you can see everything else beyond them as well. It's distracting and if it's a nightmare. It's terrifying."

It was distracting in school and I thought ""oh that's what a day dream is"" and I said something to a friend about it and she was like ""no. That's weird."" Then I started hearing things that were not there and seeing things that were not there. I was so scared all the time I was getting like 1-2 hours of sleep at night. I thought someone was watching me constantly. Like someone I couldn't see. But someone who wanted to hurt me. Then one day I looked in the mirror and it was not me. It looked kinda like me but it was a evil scary version. Today with meds I have a 50/50 shot that looking in the mirror will be me or her."

I pretty much try things for a few months and if it doesn't help too much I try something new.  I chose not to go with perception drugs because they have negative affects as well as positive ones. They null your personalities that should be there but they also null your own that should be. You know? If my disorder was way worse I might try them but I am doing okay without them for now.

AMA,3d5zkp,lespectador,2,Mon Jul 13 23:51:29 2015 UTC,"www.https://www.aupairworld.com/en  I heard such great success stories about that site from other people but it took me about a month to find a family I felt comfortable with.  I did over 30+ Skype discussions with families.  I was becoming disillusioned but I finally found a wonderful family.  It honestly just takes a lot of persistence!!   They are not... but then again, I suppose I don't have many.  I paid for my flight and I will luckily be just ending a lease about 15 days before I have to leave so the timing was perfect.  I have not decided what to do with my car insurance yet which is my only 'financing' concern left.   I will receive 300 euros a week with free food, free room and board, a monthly metro card, private health insurance, and they are providing me with a phone.    The process:  Signed up for an account.  Consistently and persistently messaged families and exchanged contact information.  Went on 30+ Skype interviews.  Exchanged contact information with my host mom, got along with her well through e-mail... when it came time for our Skype discussion we had nothing to talk about because we talked about EVERYTHING!!! in those e-mails... we just knew we were a match.  It's like dating, honestly.  You just know which family is for you in my opinion.  I went purely with my intuitions/how the family made me feel on choosing them.  I was lucky enough to find a family who made me feel great and offered more than the others in sort financial terms.  I guess I lucked out?  I won't know that until I actually get into the position I guess but right now I'm still like... ""pinch me this isn't real!!""   I speak a beginner level of French.  I've took two semesters of it in college.  I didn't keep up with practicing it so I'm not good by any means.  You must be enrolled in a language course when you are there because you will be on a student visa.  So you become fluent when you are there.  Most families will be looking at your English skills as opposed to French skills.    Thanks for your questions!! If I can be of any help in your process, please let me know!  That's why I made this AMA... because I didn't have any help!  Luckily my host mom is fluent in English and a translator.  She helped me A LOT.  xx"

If you answered yes to either of those questions you should see a doctor. Not that there is anything wrong with not masturbating. But never trying it or wanting too might be a concern. Especially because its not due to religious reasons or you have a reason not too.  Not having sexual urges strong enough to have you masturbate may be indicative of low Testosterone levels or other problems. You should make sure you get it checked out because that behavior is atypical.  Don't get me wrong, there is nothing wrong with making that life choice or not masturbating, but make sure there is nothing wrong with your hormones and/or body first."

AMA,3d17xt,Fuck_Best_Buy,10,Sun Jul 12 22:35:41 2015 UTC,"They all tie together, Dope is all about profit and maximizing profit. It's non stop work, Get the product, Cut and cook, deal, rinse repeat. Someone plays with the profit they get cooked, If your not willing to do that you shouldn't be in the dope game. Robbery game is simple, run up on someone, get their pants off and put them in a bag and shoot them. You don't kill them, they'll kill you. Murder game is just how to get away with murder which I don't condone and don't want to explain. I don't condone anything I just explained, I'm just explaining it for educational purposes."
AMA,3d17xt,alisoncarey,2,Sun Jul 12 22:42:46 2015 UTC,So the Robbery game is stealing from other dealers. Or does it expand to other people as well?   How are drugs cut? Is it common to cut them with dangerous stuff?

Cutting drugs is fucking wrong though. Your excuse below of drugs already being dangerous is horseshit. Fuck you.

It's get or get got, If you threaten a life your losing yours. I'm a piece of shit, I understand that but this is a game for pieces of shit. This is a business, I'm not a doctor, You want to fuck up your life and do drugs, it's your fault when you sniff broke glass.

So youre going to turn yourself in and most likely be given bail or maybe not. after that the trial itself could take 2-3 years depending on circumstances and how efficient your attorneys are, maybe you cop a plea in which case you will definitely serve time. what type of respectable lawyers would already tell you that you will be spending little to no time in prison without even having so much as  prosecutor assigned to your case yet. Ive dealt with some of the best criminal attorneys in Miami and Atlanta and none of them would ever say anything so moronic. this entire thing sounds suspect.

I knew a guy who had ties in mexico, they would tape dope to a 10 year old, put a t-shirt over him and send him over the boarder. If he made it, the dope made it and the kid gets some money and sent on his way. If he was caught, boarder patrol would confiscate the drugs and the kid wouldn't be allowed in the US for 5 years."

I didn't grow up very wealthy and my parents never got to go to college. During my years in elementary school I was always the top student. Soon after I joined a program that helped me grow as a learner and as a person. I worked hard and applied to the top boarding school. A few months later I got accepted and decided to attend the high school. But why did I choose a boarding school? Going to a boarding school would challenge me more academically since the public schools in NY aren't that good. It would also give me access to tons of clubs and organizations I could join. Finally, I would have closer relationships to students and teachers alike."

Silver Linings Playbook     The acting by Brad and JLaw are exceptionally good!   Interstellar  The story and visual effects are amazing!!! Mad Max: Fury Road Charlize and Tom play believable complex characters and the action scenes are mind-blowing! Bridesmaids  Kristen Wiig is so hilarious.

Don't know your plans, but from my experience, there are many kids who stop around First Class-Life because they get busy with school/girls/etc. I have Eagle Scout right at the top of my resume and while some employers don't talk about it, I've been awarded 2 jobs heavily based on having that rank (one job the interviewer and I just talked about scouts for 30 minutes and he offered me the job on the spot). Long story short, congrats on Life, and keep going to finish what you've worked for!"

AMA,3d38p7,Juicewag,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:20:45 2015 UTC,"I feel that their views on homosexuality are based off of individual instances. They seem to think that all gays are pedophiles, which is obviously not true. A lot of the older cases of pedophiles were swept under the rug and just now being brought up to help keep gays out of the Boy Scouts. You have to remember though that most of the higher ups in the BSA are older men who were raised to not tolerate homosexuality. I'm sure the BSA will be much more tolerant in the future."

AMA,3d18sg,horse-opera,3,Sun Jul 12 18:16:35 2015 UTC,"I usually wake up feeling a certian color which depicts how my day might turn out. Throughout the day as I interact with people, their colors may fluctuate but it usually stays in the same pallet. Its a little hard to describe. In my head I see numbers as a 3D map all in order which makes counting and doing math slightly easier.   If I'm doing something I dont like or in an uncomfortable situation I associate that with being white or light gray and its usually a cold and hollow feeling. If its a comfortable situation,  I usually feel a dark red, green, black or navy blue and feel warm.  Memorably speaking, as a kid I remember meeting new people and feeling and seeing their colors right away. Its how ive always determined whether I like someone or not."

AMA,3d18sg,Lacquerista21,3,Sun Jul 12 18:23:04 2015 UTC,"Usually its the opposite.  If I see or meet someone I like, I usually classify them as a dark color (brtish racing green, a deep red, black). I see them as warm and comforting. If I dont like someone,  theyre usually white or a pastel color which means hollow or empty to me."

My stepfather was not particularly patient or kind with me.  My dad helped me by being one of the only people in my family who had faith in me and my capabilities, and by not belittling and bullying me for my odd interests and frequent, annoying questions.  My suggestion would be not to treat them as being different or a ""problem child"" and to encourage their special interests and not shoot them down. Also to realize that meltdowns, like seizures, are not voluntary and should not be regarded as connected to ill character or sociopathy, even though they can sometimes be violent and scary.

Anyway...... I was headed north on a Main Street with a 35mph speed limit so everyone does 40-45mph, there was a car headed south, the guy driving the car didn't see me and made a left, turning out in front of me like I wasn't there. We basically hit each other head on, I ended up about 80 feet from the accident site and when I looked at my hand while I was laying there, it was just barley hanging on by a few threads near my thumb and index finger. I could still partially move my thumb and index finger at the time too.   I will say that I know even though it was his fault, I should have been riding in a more defensive way. Had I assumed the driver was going to not see me and ridden accordingly I could have avoided this. So who's at fault only matters so much, the consequences of the accident matter more.

Having said that I'm not personally going after the driver who hit me, it was an accident and him having to live with his mistake is more than enlugh punishment as he wasn't drunk or neglectful, he just wasn't focused enough and studies show drivers look for cars, not bikes when driving."

It looks pretty cool. Has a relaxed setting for walking around so it looks normal. In the near future I'll know a lot more but for now I've just been reading online and watching YouTube videos. What matters to me is that I'll be able to ride a motorcycle again, and I understand if you don't ride it may sound kinda weird"
AMA,3cyzpx,Toxyoi,3,Sun Jul 12 10:11:31 2015 UTC,I'm a wounded warrior and lost part of my hand.    Touch bionics has been a great company.  They really have taken great care of me.  And they will help you find a good clinic to work with.     Word from the wise.  You haven't seen nothing yet for pain.  Wait a couple of months and then the phantom limb will start to set in.    Don't fall into the trap and let the doctors string you out on narcotics.  They will love to try and prescribe vicodin and oxycotin and all that shit.  But it doesn't work.   You just have to ride it out.  Maybe gabapentin to take the edge off.
AMA,3cyzpx,JezzaN1,2,Sun Jul 12 10:22:27 2015 UTC,Thanks for the advice. Sorry about wha happened to you. I'll for sure look into that company and once I'm out the hospital I'll be off the pain killers

Years later, he had to deal with a serious pill addiction (literally anything he could get his hands on on the streets or doctor hopping) that never would have come around if it hadn't been for the accident and lack of proper rehabilitation for the injuries.

Me and my friends who ride have had a lot of talks with family and girlfriends and amongst each other where we say that we know riding is dangerous and things like this happen if not worse, but we love it and it's our passion and we accept the consequences and do it anyway with no regrets. It's a lot easier to say that however when nothing seriously damaging has ever happened to you. This week I had friends ask me if I regret getting on a bike or if I would still make the same statement about my passion outweighing it's negatives. I still love riding and can't wait to get back on a bike as I regret nothing. If I could go bike I would ride more defensively and would have worn more safety gear so I will learn from this and apply it to my future riding"

But as you said its something I was passionate about. Then I started riding motorcycles and I got the lecture all the more often. But its something I love to do. If it has 2 wheels, I'll ride it.

I've always been a pretty optimistic positive person and this isn't going to change that. There's a surreal ness factor that's hard to get over. Everyday I find myself realizing there are a lot of things I can't do anymore. Today I was in a wheel chair being brought somewhere as I also broke my knee cap, and when I was waiting for a Dr. I thought I would do some wheelies like I used to in my grandpas wheelchair as a kid, and I realized I couldn't do that anymore as I need both hands to do so. Also I'm right handed. But there are amazing high tech prosthetics that will make life almost no different. I'll be able to shoot a gun, write, type, ride a bike, do almost everything I could before being controlled by muscles in the fire arm. The main issue I have is I feel self conscience about people staring at where my hand was. I'm worried about going out in public, but i get over that as my friends remind me, ""that's their problem, not mine"". My friends have been really supportive, making jokes about the drummer from def leopard and that one handed pitcher, they've made this a lot easier to process I a positive way"

I made upwards of 160k 1 year at the most"

AMA,3cyq19,ceptp3,16,Sun Jul 12 00:06:35 2015 UTC,"This probably isn't the kind of question you were looking for but perhaps you could be of help nonetheless. So a while back I got stabbed repeatedly, ended up in ICU as there was organ damage, couple surgeries, chest tube (lung got punctured 2x) and a lengthy hospital stay. The final 2/3 of my stay were in a ward where I had a nurse who I became friendly with. She had to dress the stab wounds a few times a day, deal with my catheter, actually shaved some of my pubes as one wound was along my belt line and the removing of medical tape a few times a day that would essentially tug on my pubes was unpleasant, so while it wasn't required she really seemed to go out of her way to minimize my discomfort as I was in constant pain most of the time. (IV dilaudid is more temporarily euphoric than pain relieving) I think she's really cute and I felt there may have been some mutual attraction, but I could be mistaken. Now that I'm out of the hospital, I've thought about going back to thank the staff, but also to ask her out as I know she's single. I'm 25 and she looks to be around my age, I'm not in a gang or a violent person, my attackers were random muggers so I don't think she'll judge my being stabbed. Would this be out of line or weird because she's dealt with me as a patient in a shameless yet mature way? Is this normal or common? Have you seen or experienced this? What I don't want is to be another guy bothering her, thinking she may be into me cause her job required touching my dick. Sorry for the long question but I thought context and some details mattered.   Lastly thank you so much for what you do. The nurses I dealt with while staying in the hospital were all so supportive, patient and gentle and really made my stay as pleasant as possible. It seems like a fairly selfless job that really does make a difference in peoples lives. I was in a lot of pain and in a weird place mentally and the nursing staff really helped me pull through. There's a sense of genuine caring and personal touch that the doctors, while vital but seemingly paid accordingly, seem to typically lack, at least in my experience. So thanks for being a nurse. Also something about it is kinda hot so you have that going for you too."
AMA,3cyq19,Huberocksf,11,Sun Jul 12 02:06:43 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry to hear the trauma you went through, however, I'm happy to hear you're on your way to recovery! I used to be a trauma ICU nurse so I understand the routine very well that you're talking about.  I feel that I speak for all of my former co-workers in the trauma ICU when I say that we loved seeing patients come back and say hi to us and to hear how you're doing now after the accident, during recovery, and after recovery and so on.  We've had many trauma patients come back and show a lot of interest in the career as well after the experience which is always a nice thing to hear.  As for your situation about asking your nurse out on a date, I don't think I qualify as Cupid, if you will, to say yes or no to you! Personally, I don't think I could ever date a patient when I worked in the ICU, I would see it as a conflict of interest or maybe have a hard time separating the intimacy of professionalism in care versus outside of work. It's a bit different in the ER though I've noticed, as you might have a patient and discharge them within an hour or two, and it's not so bizarre. However, you do you, at the very least, I'm sure she'd appreciate your kind words of respect towards our profession! :)"
AMA,3cyq19,Huberocksf,3,Sun Jul 12 04:02:25 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the response. When I look back on the whole ordeal, aside from the stabbing itself, I remember it being pretty positive and that's mostly due to the nurses. Even the few who seemed to permanently be in a bad mood's negativity was always outweighed by the majority of the genuinely pleasant nurses. Thanks again for everything you do, it really does make a big difference whether or not it's easily quantify able or measurable, your impact is big."
AMA,3cyq19,CupidKat,6,Sun Jul 12 05:43:13 2015 UTC,As a nurse who worked in an ortho-neuro trauma unit we had lots of young athletic and fun guys who's injuries required lengthy stays. You get to know them pretty well and friendships do develop. As far as I knew there were no personal relationships ongoing while the patient was under the acute care. After release some would come back and more than a few numbers were exchanged over my time there. My best friend married one of those sweet patients and now 30 years later and 2 kids they are still very happy together.If you are no longer under her direct professional care and you felt a mutual interest I say go for it! She could be the love of your life.
AMA,3cyq19,Huberocksf,1 point,Sun Jul 12 04:27:25 2015 UTC,"I've been out of the hospital for a while so we no longer have any professional relationship or anything. It sounds like you have many years of experience in this field so you may have a decent idea as to how nurses think on what I'm about to ask. So it was a little weird having someone I was attracted to change my catheter, give me laxatives and asked about my BM's (didn't for over a week) and just kinda saw me in my weakest lowest state. Do you make a disconnect or does that side of a guy that's been revealed change how you might see him. I'm not wording this super well but hopefully you get an Idea of what in trying to ask."
AMA,3cyq19,CupidKat,2,Sun Jul 12 05:34:37 2015 UTC,"Many of the patients on the big unit I worked on were multi-system trauma patients. It was very challenging taking care of them. Some had been there weeks or months and after awhile you get to know them, see the same family and friends visit, and develop a little friendly banter. You have helped this person from when they were most vulnerable to the point where they were healing up, doing physical therapy and getting their lives back together. There is absolutely a professional line that is not crossed and also there's nothing attractive about the nitty gritty aspects of a sick or broken human body. But as they get better and their personality, sense of humor and independence return then there may be a sense of mutual interest. It would be very unprofessional and pretty unlikely a relationship would develop in the hospital while the patient is acute. After discharge and a return to health a patient might drop a note and thank you bagels, chocolates or whatever off at the desk and chat with some of his caregivers. That's when I've seen those that may have shared a little inkling of chemistry might exchange numbers or go for coffee. It wasn't real frequent but would occasionally happen. More often they would incidentally run into each other again while out with friends or whatever. Did you have conversations as ""real people"" outside of the context of your care? Was there a connect that you felt? If so, maybe a thank you note with an offer of coffee might not be out of bounds. She can ignore it if she chooses."
AMA,3cyq19,Huberocksf,1 point,Sun Jul 12 06:15:07 2015 UTC,"You make some really valid points. I'm confident it was at least a little more friendly than normal. If I didn't have friends there she would often sit in my room with me until another patient buzzed her as my room was right next to the nursing station where other nurses waited inbetween helping people. She would jokingly say things like ""don't be a pussy, I've seen all the tattoos on you, you can't be that afraid of needles"" as I have a thing about overly anticipating shots, just stuff I feel like she wouldn't say to a typical patient. She was just playful and our relationship felt more personal than professional by the end. Also when I would thank her for things she would sometimes  jokingly say ""I like wine and chocolate for when you come back to thank me"" so I'll for sure take your advice and go back and ask her out for coffee or something casual. And as you said, she can always ignore the request. Thanks for the responses and advice"
AMA,3cyq19,Batmann11,2,Sun Jul 12 06:28:15 2015 UTC,"I just started working in nursing and we were told that we are unable to date patients,even after their discharge from the hospital.... Maybe different where she works.. ?"
AMA,3cyq19,CupidKat,2,Sun Jul 12 04:31:14 2015 UTC,"I think it is a general conflict of interest.  Despite this, I still know of some people who have done it. Again, it was more of a situation where they worked in the ED and maybe saw the patient for an hour or two and then out on the street later.  I don't know anyone who has dated a patient that they were assigned to/directly cared for, as again, that would probably be a conflict of interest, but maybe not after they're discharged? Idk, interesting!"
AMA,3cyq19,Nth-Degree,1 point,Sun Jul 12 04:34:57 2015 UTC,"So to put this in context it was in the late 70s in Colorado. Orthopedic trauma was treated differently than now so multi-trauma patients were in the hospital a long time. Sometimes the only injury was shattered lower extremities. Any of the nurses I knew who dated patients did so long after their release from the hospital. They would stop by months later to thank us and occasionally one would leave an individual nurse a note. These guys were in the hospital weeks and sometimes months after sustaining climbing, hang-gliding, extreme sports type accidents. They were in for long hospitalizations, long recoveries and long rehabs. Only when they had reclaimed some semblance of their lives back would they return. Hunky, athletic red-blooded young men. They like smart, beautiful, athletic women. Numbers got exchanged."

AMA,3cyq19,Demoncptn426,5,Sun Jul 12 01:55:20 2015 UTC,"To be honest, I think I might prefer the work of paramedics/EMS workers as they are very hands on and get to be at the start of the incident/in the field/at the scene! I respect them very much.  I think it's a difficult line to balance field work versus a more protocol/standardized care similar to hospital work.  I don't have any EMS experience personally, so it's hard for me to speak directly about the job.  However, I'm always thankful for the big bore IVs and stabilization of patients prior to arrival! :) My only negative to say about EMS is specific to a community volunteer service in the city that prioritizes the ""brand"" of the hospital over proximity to accommodate the acuity of the patient in the ambulance.  For example, driving past 3 or 4 hospitals to get to a specific one, despite the need for stat medical treatment/evaluation."

I'm hoping to go into primary care since I like that building of relationships, and I can't tell you the number of times I've wanted to know what happened to the patient on the other end. A few weeks ago, had a cardiac arrest pt and although we worked him up to a stable pulse before transport, I never heard if he made it (unlikely I know)."

It's rather befuddling."
AMA,3cyq19,TTTT27,3,Sun Jul 12 03:55:27 2015 UTC,"Not feeling well, especially if you are or feel you're near death, can really mess with how people act. Especially when you take into account money, money they or their family have to spend for medical expenses, money for many other debts if they die, worry about the family and what they'd do if you do die, etc... I don't think people realize what they're doing when they're in a mode like that. Which sucks, you know, because as you said the nurses really are just there to help. But fear is a mind killer."
AMA,3cyq19,agoodliedown,2,Sun Jul 12 04:13:25 2015 UTC,"I completely understand and agree! It's such a frightening and difficult time, and not just because of the physical stress to the body from whatever medical emergency is happening, but like you said, also the emotional and financial stress that builds up.  I am very empathetic towards this.  It still really stinks when the patient's are yelling at you.  And to be honest, it's usually not the patients that are having the emergency and multi-facet stresses that you describe.  It's usually the patients who are being treated for non-emergencies.  For example, one of my patient's came to the ED because they couldn't make an appointment with their neurologist until a week later for a follow-up CT.  The patient denied any new symptoms and stated that they did not have time to wait for the appointment due to their busy schedule, thus, came to the ED in an attempt to speed things up so they did not have to worry about managing the appointment into their week.  Well, this day was busy and we had a stroke patient come in after this patient was seen.  Of course, the stroke patient took priority to receive a head CT and neurology consult as they are a higher acuity.  After explaining that this was the reason why the other patient's imaging was delayed, the patient became agitated and angry because they were there first and began yelling and cursing and calling names because they weren't being seen by neurology/going to CT first.  I think this idea of entitlement or business-like behavior (aka ""I was your customer first, serve me first"" attitude) is what really makes my skin crawl.  Despite providing education and emotional support to the patient, the patient continued on with the verbal abuse.  Now, I'm not saying most patients are like this, because they are absolutely not.  However, I have noticed it is usually the patients with lower acuity, and decreased financial stress that have the higher rate of verbal abuse in the ER.  Similar situations such as a patient who came in for a hand injury and x-ray is delayed because a Class I trauma came in, etc.  I'm not quite sure if it's a personal challenge or perhaps a lack of education and managing expectations that reiterates this behavior."
AMA,3cyq19,el_student,1 point,Sun Jul 12 04:28:44 2015 UTC,"Well, I think they just feel entitled to everything at that point. 'you're a service and I have money, serve me'. They don't particularly care that someone else could die, they want what they want when they want it and they're probably very used to getting that. It sucks, though, you're right. That's just stupid imo."

AMA,3cyq19,EJA482,2,Sun Jul 12 05:44:47 2015 UTC,"I've never made any grand medical gestures in public, such as chest compressions or witnessed a multi trauma happen live! Of course I've ran into smaller incidences in public where I've applied medical skills, like helping with falls, breaks/sprains, first aid wound care, and seizure stabilization/care.  I have come across a friend in the ER! I've never come across a family member or friend in the ER who is experiencing something life-threatening.  My friend that I came across in the ER was for acute abdominal pain.  I did work with a nurse who had a family member who sustained a multi-trauma and was admitted to our trauma ICU.  Unfortunately, he did not survive.  She still works there to this day. I can't imagine how hard it must be for her to show up everyday to work.  As for interesting cases, I'd probably have to say traumas and burns are my favorite and the most interesting. Necrotizing fasciitis wounds are impressive, especially after debridement and packing. I once had a patient who's NF tunneled from his chest, down his abdomen, down and around the groin and butt.  It looked like something out of an anatomy book after surgery and debridements and wound care.  I'm one of those gross people who loves popping pimples, so I love debridements of burns and wounds! I once had a patient who made a homemade bomb and blew most of his penis off.  That was interesting. I also once had a patient that was drunk on a boat and playing with fireworks and accidentally lit one right into his face. That was the first time I squished brain matter (it was coming out of his wounds).  He survived.  There's also always the interesting sex-Rays, as I like to call them, in the ED...like ""what did he put up his butt that brought him here"" or ""that sex toy led to her vaginal hemorrhage"".  Those are always interesting x-ray pictures!"

AMA,3cyq19,wutae,1 point,Sun Jul 12 08:39:43 2015 UTC,"So I actually never wanted to be a nurse.  I was always the math girl growing up, more into engineering.  Then when I was in college, I took an anatomy and physiology course and absolutely loved it! I find the human body so fascinating.  Then I learned more about the nursing career as I was ignorant and had little to no idea how autonomous and challenging the role is.  I also really wanted to choose a career that had variety as I often change my mind and have a lot of interests.  You can really do anything in nursing.  It's not just a matter of switching specialities within or outside a hospital, but also roles.  You can work as an engineer, educator, researcher, informatics, management, clinical, public health, etc.  I really enjoy the variety of roles as well as the constant interaction with people and constant teaching involved; both for me and patients.  I really enjoy the life-long learning that comes with (any) healthcare job, as well as providing patient education on a daily basis.  As for obstacles, nursing school is rough.  When I got my BSN, you had two years pre-nursing, then two years nursing.  When you're in nursing school, you are kind of in a mini-grad school.  Anything below 80% was failing at my nursing school.  Also, the questions are different than any tests questions I've ever known.  It's basically a question with a list of answers that are, in fact, ALL correct, but you have to choose what would be MOST correct. A lot of critical thinking.  Other obstacles, non-nurses/nursing students just don't get it.  This is especially true in nursing school.  My friends who were studying biology/pre-med or psychology or business or whatever just didn't understand the stress level because they were normal college students.  Nursing students are forced to grow-up a bit because you're attending clinical and expected to act as a professional when in reality, you're only 18-22 years old and also, you're still in college taking multiple challenging courses at once.  So, overall, the biggest obstacle is the stress as it is mentally, physically, and emotionally stressful/exhausting, and also time management!   And I am currently looking to adopt a dog! I miss my dogs! They live back home miles away with my parents.  I used to have several dogs growing up and a chinchilla!"

I do however, keep in contact with pretty much everyone else especially my USGA family and some of the people I met through Mormons Building Bridges, and Affirmation.

One of my favorite ones is travelling around the country and simply meeting up with strangers.  Doesn't matter, if it's train, bus or blablacar - very likely you'll meet someone to discuss about life (usually it starts with complaing about delay-train connections mostly suck there). :) Manner of traveling in the train is very pro-social (wagons are divided into smaller closed compartments with 8 seats-4 on both sides, facing each other).  I really love biking on the countryside in the mountains, where my family lives.    Something which lots of people never heard of:  I once knew some people, historians, who were obsessed with seeking unexploded bombs preserved in the ground from the WWII.  I have no idea what they were doing with it, but they were very serious about it."

I grew up in the Southern parts of America, and now I just enjoy beef and steak too much to give it up. As far as the birth mother thing, I have my reasons for not really caring for her. Honestly I'm not sure, cause I've read in various places that Hinduism is considered more of a lifestyle than a religion.

AMA,3cu9pg,erichisalurker,5,Sat Jul 11 06:09:53 2015 UTC,"Sorry, didnt see that one. Well, they don't have hips and their belly button is under their throat, so finding their waste is quite hard. But the girth of the shark can be anywhere from under a foot to over 20, depending not the shark, size, and where you measure it.   Good poop question. First, active sharks eat about 6% of their body weight per week. Think about that....I weigh 170lbs, so thats 10.2lbs of food per week. I eat WAY more than that per week, they are quite efficient. Their poop doesn't really come out like ours, its much more 'processed', but it comes out on a similar schedule to us people."
AMA,3cu9pg,yasserkhan1,-1,Sat Jul 11 06:26:25 2015 UTC,"You are mixing up the words waste and waist. They are asking about the size of the poop from sharks, not their circumference."

AMA,3cu9pg,Caesar619,4,Sat Jul 11 01:34:40 2015 UTC,"Its a little hard to say with so little data. I believe the current number is 10 or 11? Most of the incidents, lets say 8, have been smaller blacktip or spinner sharks. The other two were tragic and a bull/tiger was the most likely shark responsible. So lets just ignore those two because they are so freakishly rare for the area.   I think 8 is within the normal range of incidents (true its a little high, but the summers when its a little low don't get reported) but they have had more light shed upon them because the 2 terrible incidents.   Now, if this trend continues it will definitely be outlandishly high. I don't think its because overfishing or fishing from piers (people have always been there). I think its because habitats are expanded due to rising temperatures and there are perhaps more sharks in the region.   Just my .02"

AMA,3cu9pg,turnpikenorth,4,Sat Jul 11 03:04:12 2015 UTC,"What can I do to help preventing being eaten by a shark while swimming or surfing. Also I hear the great white shark population has been increasing since the 70's and 80's due to conservation efforts, does that correlate to a higher chance of being a great white attack victim?"
AMA,3cu9pg,doesntthinkmuch,6,Sat Jul 11 03:09:51 2015 UTC,"So first, lets look at the facts. ~3 people die a year from shark bites. Think about how many people get in the water per day, those are damn good odds. You can look this up, but you're more likely to die from a toaster shock or a toliet seat than a shark but still....the best way to avoid getting bitten by a shark is to not mimic its prey. I would say 95% of all shark attacks are because the animal thinks its about to eat its prey. So how to do this 1. dont swim in murky water/at night/dusk/dawn 2. dont swim near mouths of rivers 3. if you see a school of fish, move away 4. don't wear shiny jewelry (scales) Just remember, its the sharks house. Its quite incredible that there are so few shark incidents per yer. If people's favorite rec activity was to sprint through South Africa, cheetahs, lions, and leopards would kill everything. Sharks are smart, just don't look like prey.  So technically, yes more sharks means a higher chance, but that is 1 in 3.7 million to 1 in 3.699999 million. So realistically, no the increase in population isn't high enough to impact the likelihood of a shark 'attack'."

AMA,3cu9pg,psylocke_and_trunks,7,Sat Jul 11 02:13:58 2015 UTC,"For my thesis, we found that lemon sharks prefer sharks that they live with vs. strangers. Pretend you go to a party with your roommates, you'd be more likely to hang with them v. strangers, sharks are the same way.  Probably lemon sharks since I worked so much with them to discover #1 (i like great hammerheads too.) Yes. I actually caught a 7ft tiger shark from the beach and went surfing the next day, on the same beach.  Shark repellent is great. Im down for anything that will decrease the potential of 'attacks' without killing sharks. In South Africa they put up nets to kill the sharks and keep them out, my buddy is working on something that looks like kelp, but repels the sharks. If you adopt a shark, you can name it and I will send you a picture of your shark and a video of me doing surgery on it to put the tag in. The price to adopt is $300, but thats because a tag costs that amount. I could send you a picture of a shark and tell you its name no matter what you contribute :)"

If they want to show how good sharks are, why do they play shark attack shows all day during shark week? It seems like every show I see is ""the worst shark attacks"".

AMA,3cu9pg,Cyhn0X,4,Sat Jul 11 01:42:30 2015 UTC,"So first I wouldn't recommend bringing it on the boat unless you have lots of experience. Bull sharks are really strong and its definitely not worth the risk, especially if you have high gunnels.   You have a couple options.  1. get the shark as close to the boat as possible and cut the line 2. Get a tailer and put it around the sharks tail and cleat the fishing line off to the boat, then cut the hook.   Its okay to leave hooks in their mouth, losing a hand or hurting an observed isn't worth getting it out."
AMA,3cu9pg,Cyhn0X,3,Sat Jul 11 01:57:47 2015 UTC,Do sharks have emotions? How important are sharks for the ecosystem?
AMA,3cu9pg,Cyhn0X,6,Sat Jul 11 01:53:30 2015 UTC,"There are 500 species of sharks and most are not apex predators. So if you have a food web, the most important animals are those that are the hardest to replace. The difficulty in replacing an animal revolves around how many other animals are on their same level. So lets say great white --> seal --> fish --> shrimp. It would be way easier to replace a shrimp in the ecosystem than a great white, so the higher an animal is on a food chain, the more important it is. With that being said, some sharks are very important for keeping the ecosystem healthy. Some sharks are just as important as ladyfish, which most people don't think are very important. BUT every animal is a key component of the ecosystem, and just because some are more important than others, all are important.   I don't know if sharks have emotions, but they have been shown to have personalities and advanced social structure. Its hard to test for emotions because everyone has a different definition and its not concrete. I can definitely say that certain sharks respond much differently to stimuli, whether it be a diver jumping in the water or being chased by a boat."
AMA,3cu9pg,Cyhn0X,3,Sat Jul 11 02:04:04 2015 UTC,"Ahhh, i love sharks and am very jealous that you get to study them for a living.

How are some divers able to swim with sharks without getting attacked? How do they know the sharks won't hurt them?   And how would you like to be a shark?"
AMA,3cu9pg,ryancarp3,3,Sat Jul 11 03:19:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I love my job too :).    Yeah, sharks are in trouble, but the media often exaggerates that fact. Its not all doom and gloom, the United States is doing a lot better on fisheries management than they were 10 years ago. This is the case for a lot of countries too. So yes they are in trouble, but its getting better.  Depends on the sharks. There are two ways to address this questions, gestation time and time between births. Some sharks, like the spiny dogfish, are pregnant for two years while the bonnethead shark is pregnant for only four months. The lemon shark gets pregnant every other year while the atlantic sharp nose gets pregnant every year. There is some individual variation in this too.  Being a shark would be pretty neat, but then I would know their secrets. I would rather be a human and try to figure them out."
AMA,3cu9pg,c-1000,1 point,Sat Jul 11 03:25:42 2015 UTC,"When you say the issue regarding shark population is getting better, do you mean to say that the mortality rate is slowly decreasing as the birth rate is slowly increasing?"

AMA,3cu9pg,RainBawZ,6,Fri Jul 10 21:49:07 2015 UTC,"Dusky sharks are quite cool. They are often confused with sandbar sharks, but the dusky shark usually lives farther from shore. Sharks have a unique way of regulating the amount of salt in their blood, which regulates their hydration level. They have rectal glands, which retain urea. This would be toxic to people, but they deal with this by synthesizing TMAO-- a compound which nullifies the effect of urea. If you want to learn more about the topic, you should read about bull sharks. Since they can swim into freshwater, they have evolved a modified technique to regulate salt contents in their body.   Sometimes sharks have to excrete urea, which we can think of as peeing. When they do 'pee', it comes from the rectal gland, which is located at the urogenital opening. So no, they don't urinate through their skin, but they are quite unique. I actually have a freezer full of rectal glands right now waiting to be analyzed."

I've never seen one, but I know two people who have caught them. We don't know that much about them, but from taking tissue/blood samples and satellite tagging them, we are able to learn a lot more. They are big, long-lived, and slow. The copepods that grow in their eye may seem like a nuisance, but it probably doesn't matter since light rarely gets down to their habitat. I hope to see one sometime in the near future."

AMA,3cvy3b,Daguvry,5,Sat Jul 11 05:50:18 2015 UTC,"I answered his question about best/worst crowds.  Copy and pasted for those who don't want to click link....  It's a long reply..... I ran the boards for thousands of concerts around the Pacific Northwest the last 8-10 years. I've worked around everyone from Sheryl Crow, Beck, Black Keys to Etta James and what's left of the Beach Boys. My all time favorite show was a Hawaiian band who consisted of 60+ year old guys playing their ""reunion/retirement"" show. It was in a high school gymnasium in Seattle's Chinatown area. I don't recall their name but they filled that place up, so there may have been 1000 people there. People were lining the hallways and I'm sure we broke every fire code Seattle has. The band was a couple of songs away from wrapping up and I could tell that they were ready for their final show to be over. Then, BOOM! All of the power drops out. The building maintenance guy starts leading me downstairs to the pit where all of the breakers are and I can hear the drummer kicking ass all over a drum solo. None of the breakers are tripped! I can hear kind of a rolling thumping above us getting louder and louder. Power is out in the buildings all around us. I can still hear the drummer just killing it upstairs, so we leave the basement and head back upstairs. The entire room is illuminated with cell phones bouncing up and down. This 67 year old drummer is going on like a 12 minute solo and the place is going batshit crazy for it! Power kicks back on and they all fall back into their second to last song without missing a beat. During the last song the crowd is in a crazy Asian Hawaiian mob bouncing up and down (if they weren't a bunch of 50+ year olds, there would have been a mosh pit). Saxophone solo in the last song had just him spotlighted and his fucking monitor caught on fire right in front of him! I ran up unplugged it and tossed it off the stage by a fire extinguisher and put it out. The crowd lost their fucking minds. I have never experienced anything like that show and probably never will. I have had really famous people thank me and a random fan or two at shows thank me, but after the Hawaiian band show I had a line of people thanking me and hugging me. TLDR: worked Bumbershoot/Sasquatch events with bunches of famous people. Best show I ever did was a 50+ year old band and crowd in a high school gymnasium."
AMA,3cvy3b,IvyGold,2,Sat Jul 11 05:52:10 2015 UTC,Dunno what to ask you but dayum there are that many Hawaiians in the Northwests?  Now that I think about it -- were you young enough to be there when the grunge thing happened?  Your thoughts and recollections?
AMA,3cvy3b,dude_pirate_roberts,2,Sat Jul 11 08:17:32 2015 UTC,"I missed the grunge era.  At least working during it.  I was in high school still while Nirvana, Soundgarden and Pearl Jam were just becoming popular.

AMA,3cvy3b,ForgottenPassword3,1 point,Sat Jul 11 14:15:52 2015 UTC,As for worst crowds..... Almost any free admission type festival.

He was always super nice and was just there to be happy and dance.  I let him go up on stage too many times to remember....

I took the spot dead center in front of the stage, about five feet off the stage so I couldn't get crushed against it -- and held that ground against all comers (or tried). I'd wear sweat pants with my volleyball kneepads inside so my knees wouldn't get damaged if someone knocked me over.  I attribute my not-too-severe hearing damage to the time that I was in the pit at the Ramones show, in my usual spot, and realized that I could not tell what song they were playing. I immediately left. My ears rang for four days. That was the only time I failed to bring earplugs to a show like that.  Kids! Wear those earplugs! Seriously! You don't want to spend your later years going ""What? What?"" all the time, annoying your family.  The Ramones are gone, but I hope that someday I'll be with a bunch of friends from the retirement home, listening to Jello Biafra and Klaus Flouride, moshing.

I haven't done that job for a couple years now and I still can't go see a show without my brain switching to ""work mode"".  I went to a local show but it drove me crazy.  Their set up had phase issues (no bass in between the speakers on the floor).  I could hear them sweeping slightly from left to right trying to figure it out and I just wanted to walk over and push the button for them.  Or rewire one of their main speakers so it sounded correct"

Because of this fact do you feel you are losing out on alternate life perspectives?  Are you regularly surrounded by people of similar financial statuses?  Do you ever wonder what the real world stresses of livng in extreme poverty are like?   I ask because ever since I was a kid I wanted the ability to experience life from every angle. The traveling hobo, the ultra successful playboy worth millions, and even the stressed out middle management family man. Unfortunately I will not be granted the opportunity to experience all of these, however I will always take advantage of any opportunity I get to better understand them."

How do you dead with people who are insensitive to your lifestyle?  Do you plan on having children with either of them? Both of them? If you had children with both, how would you tell your kids that they are both half siblings and cousins? You'd have to expect they have no sense of propriety and will tell everyone, and you're gonna end up in a bizarre parent teacher conference.  Did you marry the male because it was easier that way, or because you are more committed to him, or financial reasons, or something else?  What do you all do for work?   What state or area of the country or non-US country do you live in?  Do you wish you could marry the female too or are you content with the current situation?  Do any of you practice any religion?  If there is one thing you wish more people could understand about your situation/lifestyle/choices, what would it be?  What happens if you want to divorce one of them but not the other?"

I'm married to him. His sister is my BFF and lives with us. That's what distant friends think.  Those who we think would be insensitive don't know our secret. We're just a married couple who are roommates with the husband's sister.  We talked about kids and I will have kids with him. She doesn't like being pregnant. We will raise them as a three parent household. Hopefully our kind of relationships will be more accepted in the future so there won't be as many social problems.  Married him because it was easier and could fly under the radar easier. Lesbian couples attract more attention than straight ones in the neighbourhood or among friends.  I'm a decorator. He is a financial consultant. She is a biology research scientist.  We live in the UK.  If I could I wish to marry her legally as well but we're married in our hearts. We have rings as well.   I'm an Atheist.   If there is one thing you wish more people could understand about your situation/lifestyle/choices, what would it be?   That our love and compassion for each other is genuine and should be respected. Marriage isn't just between two people, more people can be in a marriage as well.

Is it just that she doesn't like being pregnant or does she not want to be biologically related to any children?  Because you could always carry the pregnancy with her egg (lots of lesbian couples, including two friends of mine, have done that in order for both of them to feel like the child is each of theirs, equally).   That our love and compassion for each other is genuine and should be respected. Marriage isn't just between two people, more people can be in a marriage as well.   I wholly agree and support you and others in helping others move forward in accepting these types of relationships.  A family is not just a male, a female, and their offspring!  I'm sorry to hear that you aren't close with your family and keep your relationship with your wife secret from many of your acquaintances, but I hope your environment becomes more supportive about polygamous and polyamorous relationships in the future.

We struggled for 3 years to have kids and now we are 6 weeks away from the due date. Based off all the classes, having three pairs of hand to raise a kid sounds like an advantaged parenting structure if society is accepting of it.  One stupid question.

The conservative arguments against gay marriage have long touted the ""slippery slope to polygamy"" as a reason to keep gay marriage illegal.  Maybe their fears will come true.  However, if anything were more traditionally Christian, it would be polygamous marriage, so I don't know what they are so worried about."
AMA,3cs8d8,IvanStroganov,2,Fri Jul 10 18:59:57 2015 UTC,"The conservative argument against interracial marriage was also the ""slipper slope to gay marriage"", that didn't stop it from getting mainstream.

It's quite common when you think about it.    The details of the personal relationship that you share with your husband/wife is your private business.

In normal relationships, it's easy - both can only be in love with one partner, another one comes along, relationship ends.

AMA,3cu2gj,Coxfiniwarn,3,Fri Jul 10 19:53:22 2015 UTC,"what was the worst thing you ever saw as an employee we all know how how customers feel, how did you feel when you worked there, do they treat the employees the same? do i really have to bundle?"
AMA,3cu2gj,D_LILLARD,2,Fri Jul 10 20:23:57 2015 UTC,"The worst thing i will answer twice. A) The worst i felt for a customer: dude moved, took his contract for tv internet and home security with him, gets to the house, its not cable ready, waits 2 months for us to get it fixed, we don't do it. He goes and gets another company who can get him internet the same day. Reasonable no? He calls and cancels. we say we'll take care of it (nothing in the way of this will have pending consequences, quite the contrary), and we issue him a 3 month bill for his service impossibly being on during the time we waited to transfer it, and on top of that, 1500$ in cancellation fees. (Note, in a situation like this, i am always at least the 7th person they've talked to in a 48 hour period) I transfer him to Billing after explaining to 4 consecutive representatives that we have to honor the waiving of the credits, rep after rep tells me that they won't take the call because since it's a transfer, sales has to take care of it, even though we don't have the permission on a team lead manager level to credit that much. Poor dude. i'll never know if it ever got fixed.   B) the worst thing for me - dude used over 5000 minutes of unlimited long distance landline service to talk to his new york friends from seattle. we cut off his line because he's using it like a business. nowhere in our terms of service does it say plainly that we will do this, so he talks to me just to tell me what a racist and dangerous bigot he is, and occupies my time for 3 hours. luckily someone cut his line so he went off halfway through, but i feared this man like most people who have been oppressed by the white man (i am caucasian, and he was zed and raynor of white people).   My heart goes out to everyone who has to interact with people. I always wish i was the first person everyone talked to, and that is only 50% of the case. People get mistreated by people reading off their scripts and trying to make a buck off everyone involved. My best sales days were the days i pretended that i was better and smarter and worth more than the people i talked to to try to crush my empathy. If i loved money more than i loved ""thank you, you're the best customer representative i've ever talked to"", i'd be at the top of the charts too. i was fine being in the top 1/2 most of the time. The benefits are hard to ignore though, free internet, free premium network, you just pay for the monthly service of the equipment (in my case, 1 internet modem, 1 dvr set top box, and 1 auxillary box for my roommate cost less than 30$, while others pay about 110 thankfully since the every day price range is somewhere around 170) No, you don't have to bundle. It's important to have done your research and ignore common human decency when dealing with a salesman over the phone. It hurts me when you don't bundle. I get paid $1.70 when you get just exactly enough internet to get you by, i get paid double that when you take double the internet speed, i get paid triple if i get you to take some kind of tv, quintuple if that tv involves espn and amc, and forget it, i get paid about 20$ if i convince you to take tv internet and home phone. and why not, they'll pay me 70$ if i can on top of all that convince you to take home security as well. We are motivated to tell you about every product you have, we are driven to talk to you about your needs and we will invent out of the feces of forgotten kings and aeons old stardust anything we need to say to get you to take them. No, you don't have to bundle, but we have to try to sell you the bundle and convince you that the bundle is the best thing on the planet and will give you a massage, keep your kids from disturbing your quiet time, and help your marriage with our camera system. You will never hear from a salesman you don't have to bundle. I am not a salesman, i said ""hey, does any of this make sense for your home? No? cool, we'll send out the modem for your internet and 3-5 business days."" and my supervisor says ""you should work harder to make them have a hard time saying no"". so i guess this goes back to question 2, my gripes about common human decency aside, no you don't have to bundle."

AMA,3cu2gj,nitegod,1 point,Sat Jul 11 00:58:43 2015 UTC,"I have heard of people getting discounts or even upgrades by threatening to terminate service. Is that something that happens a lot? What factors go into determining if a customer's service should be discounted (late payments, customer loyalty, current price package, etc)? Is there anything that can be said or done on the part of the the customer to encourage a positive outcome?   I would assume this is handled by a separate retention department but it's worth a shot."
AMA,3cu2gj,dude_pirate_roberts,2,Sat Jul 11 01:37:14 2015 UTC,"it is handled by a separate retention department, but i know what happens. Someone calls in, generally because their bill just went up after we told them it would go up in 12 months, or legitimately it is one of the 3 to 6 month promotional rolloff rates that we're supposed to cover (we have now started to get written up or fired for not making it explicitly clear what your bill would do in the last three months), they complain their bill is too high, My job is to make sure that i can't lower their bill or sell them something they don't have to give them more value for their bill, like taking over a phone service from another company and making that portion legitimately cheaper on a new promotion and making it all go away, or by selling something that you were thinking about and making it seem really good.   After that fails (which it does about 90% of the time), i transfer to loyalty. They say ""well, your bill did just go up, but it's still not at every day pricing, it'll go up one more time in 12 months, so you're still saving 20$"" this works on maybe 15% of people. ""I still want to lower my bill"" then they do the same thing i just did, try to sell them something, and sometimes they legitimately have different deals than the sales department has. this works on another 25% of people if they have something, and maybe 10% of people tired from talking to people.  When none of that works, they say ""well, sounds like you're in the deal you're supposed to be in if i can't get you anything else that i just listed."" then they say or threaten to cancel their account, then the last ditch efforts come in, this is their paycheck too, they make money off of how many accounts they can keep from getting closed. they get paid even if they reduce your bill, that's why they're so quick to appease people with free 6 months of hbo (that will also get your bill going up later, so continue the cycle), or ask their supervisor if they can get you into a contracted super deal.  for 95% of interactions that you have with someone about your account, they make a notation of it, we are looking for abuse of the system, previous credits, previous promo, we will sometimes shorten it to ""Promo hopper"" so that we can just ignore them.  The best way i would say to help yourself out is to not terminate the account, but just lower it to as little as you can without cancelling it. 3 mbps internet, limited basic tv (channels 2-20). wait an hour for it to process, then call back to the sales department where we look at your account and see an easy upgrade. you will get pitched everything, but it's the simplest way to be treated like a brand new customer. this will work about 60% of the time, the other 40 is when the loyalty department threatens you with contract breaks or other things (which is why i tried specifically to sell non-contracted offers first time around unless they said they owned their house and didn't plan to move and my deal was price-locked), or worse, if they put the order in pending and the next person you talk to is completely new and doesn't understand what you just tried to do and you have to call back  Working the system is work, but since i literally am trained to do just that, this is what i would employ when they turn off my employee account next week."

And Thailand is said to be extradite some fleeing Uighurs back to China and they get executed by Chinese governemt. Since Uighur's are Turkic people like us, a huge majority of nationalist Turks responded these rumors with a public outburst. Attacking Chinese tourists and shops, everything related with China. I'm a nationalist myself but i find this reaction unremarkably stupid and savage. Goverment's fault should not relied upon its people.

AMA,3cu7mv,Riddle0219,2,Fri Jul 10 22:29:02 2015 UTC,How do you feel about the Ottoman Empire? Armenian  Genocide? Ataturk?  Should Kurdistan gain sovereignty?  Where do you live in Turkey?  Where should a tourist visit?
AMA,3cu7mv,bokavitch,4,Fri Jul 10 21:59:59 2015 UTC,"-Ottoman Empire did so many contributions to the current state of modern Turkey but failed so hard during the last years so it was up to Ataturk to save the country and re-establish it from the scratch. I adore Ataturk so much he is the father of the Turks after all i can't deny what he has done to this country.   Armenian Genocide is a very sensitive issue in Turkey. Here most of -the people believe that Armenians were killed by bandits and the harsh conditions of the weather during the exile. It's the country's policy to deny Armenian Genocide. Turks also believe that if Armenia can prove the genocide they shoud open the historical archieves which Turkey forces it to do but the government of Armenia refuses anytime i don't know why. Personally i believe many innocent Armenians alongside the revolters were killed during the war. Because its a war. It kills people from both sides unfortunately. But i don't think it was a genocide because there were still a big Armenian population in West side of Turkey and Istanbul. To accept is as a genocide the whole Armenians population should have eredicated. Like Hitler did to jews.  -Kurds have been like brothers with Turks for the most of the time. But since the descriminative politics of the goverment and the establishment of PKK and declaring war to Turkish state. The whole country has become a battlefield. I remember waking up in the morning and seeing that 35 soldiers were killed in a PKK attack. and bombs exploding in cities. But since 2012. The AKP goverment has started a peace process with Abdullah Ocalan. PKK's leader in prison. Terrorist attacks and operations have ended since then and it has become quite until 2013 Siege of Kobane. The government didn't wanted to help PKK in Siege of Kobane because it killed so many people not only soldiers, but the civilians and even children. So it gained a huge hatred among Turkish people.   The war between PKK and the Turkish state is slowly growing up to become a Turkish- Kurdish conflict. Which i hate to happen but inevitably going to happen because majority of the Kurdish people are now PKK supporters (see HDP votes in 2015 elections) and Turkish people absolutely hates PKK and its supporters. And Kurdish youth hates Turks. (you can even see it in youtube comments) so i don't think things are gonna be good.   The sovereignity of Kurdistan doesn't bother me unless its in Turkey's borders (southeast Turkey)  -I live in a Black Sea region city called Sakarya. It's a beautiful small city with a good green nature. Closest sea is half an hour away so its great in summer if you like swimming :)  -That's the best part of Turkey. This country is such a paradise for Tourists. As a Tourist coming to visit, i would suggest starting from Istanbul then visit Izmir, Ephesus (a great ancient city ruins), Çanakkale (where gallipolli war occured in ww 1), Antalya (great mediterrean sea and beaches. Also great nightlife), Bodrum, Cappadocia (I can't even describe this just google it its awesome) and Trabzon. (A province in East black sea region with a magnificent nature and Sumela Monastery an ancient monastery with a wonderful view and some ancient churches like aya yorgi church)  If you like historical places i guarentee you will enjoy every time you spent in Turkey. Even i still got lots of places to visit  :)"
AMA,3cu7mv,Riddle0219,3,Fri Jul 10 22:27:22 2015 UTC,You do know you don't need to kill an entire group to be considered genocide right? Because Hitler didn't kill all jews as well
AMA,3cu7mv,eletricmojo,2,Fri Jul 10 23:22:29 2015 UTC,It's not he didn't. He had no time but if he had won the war he would have killed all aswell.
AMA,3cu7mv,Richard_Borrowitz,1 point,Sat Jul 11 01:24:57 2015 UTC,"Have you made any effort to study sources that refute the Turkish government's position on the genocide?  The Armenian archives are open btw, they've never been closed. This is just a lie made up by the Turkish government."
AMA,3cu7mv,Richard_Borrowitz,2,Fri Jul 10 23:24:36 2015 UTC,I read the both archives. Turkish archives claim that Turkish people living in east Turkey were killed by Armenian gangs and Armenian archives claim that Armenian people in east Turkey were killed by Ottoman soldiers. It seems like a hit and get hit back to me. But war sucks nonetheless.
AMA,3cu7mv,Richard_Borrowitz,2,Sat Jul 11 01:27:30 2015 UTC,How secular is Turkey? Are people very religious? How are women treated?
AMA,3cu7mv,Richard_Borrowitz,2,Fri Jul 10 23:22:59 2015 UTC,"Almost whole country is Muslim. But i wouldn't say all of them are religious (me for an example). There are conservative people at some provinces and there are secular people too. So i would say they balance each other.   Defining how women are treaded completely depends on the perspective of the looker. There are each kind of guys here as well as other countries. Some people treat girls well and kindly (but get rejected at the end lol) and some people treat them like jerks and get what they want. Majority of Turkish girls want macho men so they kinda like having a ''rough'' kind of relationship. Other than that im sure women are more free in here rather than Middle East countries like Saudi Arabia where women are not allowed to drive and leave home before telling their husbands or Afghanistan where, well you get the point."

We support businesses and corporations as opposed to residential customers so deal with different kinds of SLAs. Generally an SLA being met should only impact the customer in a positive way."

AMA,3cuuu8,2Poderozo,1 point,Sat Jul 11 16:50:59 2015 UTC,"I'd say nazism is very weak in Portugal - Particularly because nazi doctrine divides white people into several categories and Portuguese, Italian and Spaniards are classified as Mediterranean, which is an inferior white version compared to nordic and central European white people - For this reason, Portuguese people don't find nazi appealing, there's one party that is kinda nazi but they get little votes unlike France where the far-right is growing.  Another thing - Estado Novo was not nazi in anyway, our system helped Jews during the war and our leader allowed white Portuguese to procreate with black people in the colonies, granting citizenship to their children (mixed race) - Yes, there are some symphatizers of Estado Novo in Portugal but mostly I think people see Salazar as an important leader, the right man for his time and an important figure despite being a dictator - That's how I see him - It's like Napoleon in France, he was bad in many ways but good in others, what's important is to not criticize something according to modern moral standards.

Whenever a strong bond is created and then it is gone without an opportunity to emotionally prepare, it is devastating.

It's easier to act like you're a dick and she needs you out of her life, than to face up to the fact she's done a horrible thing to someone she presumably loved at one stage and at least cared for  It's hard to admit you're wrong, even harder to admit you've done a bad thing, and harder still to admit you've done it out of cowardice. She was a coward, unable to pull together the strength to end your relationship at the right time and treated you badly because of it.  Be angry at her for that, sure, but don't let it reflect on your opinion of yourself: this isn't your fault, it isn't because anything is wrong with you, it's because she didn't have the balls to do the right thing at the right time. Relationships break down, it's how we end them that reflects on us as a person.  I've only heard your side, obviously, but the fact is that you tried to give her space (no doubt suspecting to some extent that this was the beginning of the end) to try to let the relationship end organically while still giving it a chance. She just couldn't do that, she was too much of a pussy to risk being alone and that is something to be pitied, but don't blame yourself."

Last I heard she wasn't having a very good life due to a combination of poor personal decisions and health issues.  I'll just add that I've had two major breakups in my life and both followed similar patterns. In retrospect I'm glad I never stayed with either of them, because they both had issues that I was too blinded by love to notice. I also grew a much thicker skin and the ability to be a lot more level headed when it came to love and dating."

Eversince the CIA torture report came out, everyone has been slamming America for its part in Dihydrogen Monoxide poisoning (waterboarding). It was a horrible time in our history, but without it, we would have never found Iraqs WMDs. Unfortunately, while trying to spread democracy, we accidentaly let a few terrorists outta prison due to overcrowding, where they took their painful scars and hatered home, to spur a new terrorist movement, one soo powerful, the likes of which had never been seen, ALS... They started taking people from their homes, churches and streets, lining them up side by side, then proceded to torture them the same wag they were in gitmo, but they improved the technique in ways we wish we could, calling it Hypothermic Dihydrogen Monoxide (ice waterboarding). Ever since they brought the fight home, we have all been living in fear, waiting for the government to do something, but the pro-water lobby is keeping Obama from banning all water nation wide, but California is very progresive and has been getting rid of its water slowly by raising the fees to possess it, and lowering the amount legally possesible, and its working, there hasnt been an ALS related attack in months!

AMA,3cpneg,aaronsherman,10,Thu Jul 9 19:51:43 2015 UTC,"Yes, there are a lot of Masonic children's homes. They're not specifically for Masonic families or anything; they're just sponsored and kept up by local lodges. It's kind of like a methodist home for children.  I am a female, my adopted brother is 6 years older. I remember going to the Masonic family events when I was younger, but my parents kept me in Girl Scouts, rec sports, and community theatre. Our community doesn't have a large youth presence in the Masonic lodges. My mother is a member of OES, but you can't join until you're 18 and by that point my interests had moved elsewhere (our local lodges are very politically motivated, my views often differ from theirs.) It was pretty much a random element of the adoption; I still support my dad's freemason activities, I go to the events that include family and join in the charity events they do."

AMA,3cpneg,aaronsherman,4,Fri Jul 10 02:31:23 2015 UTC,"Generally, yes, they do look after the big picture, but each separate masonic lodge can consist of members who predominantly follow one belief or political party. These aren't endorsed by the masons, it's more of a ""birds of a feather"" type deal. For instance, my dad's lodge is predominantly older white republican Christians. Another lodge in town is majority black, most members are democrats. There is a third that is mostly Catholics. They all get together for state Grand Lodge events, or anything to do with Scottish Rite. Dad is also a Shriner, which is basically the Freemasons playground, more of a philanthropic social club with more events and members from a lot of lodges joining together to organize community events. When I say it's very political, I mean it's difficult to just show up and be welcomed into certain lodges. There is a vetting process for new members, the other members meet and interact with the person to make sure they're a good fit for that particular lodge. If they aren't, they may refer them to another local lodge, though it's rare for anyone to be turned away if they do have a strong desire to join that lodge. They pretty much have to prove themselves, their faith, and their dedication to making the community a better place."

I can say, though, that I no longer harbor feelings of ill will towards her, I just hope she's happy (if she's alive).

If you become a freemason is it true that you can't reveal it to anyone? and what happens if you do?  Why do masons require members to believe in some sort of spiritual force?
AMA,3cpneg,infib,3,Thu Jul 9 23:40:16 2015 UTC,"I wish I could answer more questions about freemasonry for you guys but unfortunately, as one of the wimmins, I'm not allowed into their regular meetings. I know there is a lot of ritual involved (not like blood ritual, more like ""light these lights in this order, say this passage, handshake"" etc.). I don't think there is a secret agenda, per say, but I am not going to lie, most of the higher-ups in my city are masons. A lot of cops are freemasons around here, and I've been excused from more than one speeding ticket because they know who my father is. I would say it's more like a regular boy's club, some secrecy, a lot of philanthropy, lots of drinking with the boys once the hard work is done, but no secrecy that's malicious or harmful to others. Everything I've seen from my dad's involvement has been incredibly positive, and they do a lot for our community and local organizations (even if they're not freemason related).   It's not true that you can't reveal it to anyone. Nothing happens if you do. They sort of have to reveal it, if they want to invite someone in to join the lodge (yep, they often invite new members, and if someone comes in to inquire about becoming a freemason, the guys will usually take that person under their wing and involve them in a few events to show them what it's all about).  I really can't answer that last question, because I don't know. I know they don't care what spiritual force you believe in, but you must maintain that belief to remain a freemason. (If I say I believe in and worship the earth as my higher power, they will absolutely accept that. I just have to remain staunch in that belief). The majority of my dad's lodge are Christians, though.  If I had to guess, I would think they are required to have faith in something because it's one of their key ideals. They believe in a supreme being, faith, hope, charity, relief, truth, freedom, and individual liberty. So they have individual liberty to choose who or what they believe in, but they must have unaltered faith in that being."

AMA,3csu62,suggarstalk,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:09:49 2015 UTC,"The best time to buy a car is when you are ready and confident in your purchase decision. There are seasonal times when it is beneficial to purchase a car; however, that is subjective to your location. Ohio has a lull in sales during the wintertime and I have seen some amazing deals.  Having a trade-in can be very beneficial if you live in a state that deducts the trade-in value from the car purchase before taxation. This is the case in Ohio. If you have a $500-$1,000 then throw it on craigslist and you'll get more for the vehicle (if it isn't to inconvenient). Thanks : )"
AMA,3csu62,VTECunleashed,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:28:03 2015 UTC,"What is your opinion of the ""extended warranties"" many dealerships often practically force on potential buyers?"
AMA,3csu62,kdawgca,2,Fri Jul 10 15:21:14 2015 UTC,"Extended warranties or ""extended service contracts"" can be useful but not to all byers. If you are purchasing a new Volkswagen, Mini Cooper, BMW, Chevy or Ford and find it would be easier to pay $30.00 more a month vs. a $1,500 service bill then buy a warranty. Volkswagens, which I have sold, typically have very costly repair bills but shockingly inexpensive warranties. BMW also has a 100,000 mile warranty/maintenance package that just makes sense financially. Chevy and Ford vehicles have very low hourly service rates and part costs and thus the lowest warranty costs. With those vehicles it truly is 6 in one hand and half of a dozen in the other. If you visit JD Powers you can look up a specific vehicles part failure/1000 parts and that may help your decision. Personally, I don't see the value of extended warranties with Honda, Toyota or Subaru unless the cost of a 7 year/ 100k mile warranty is less than $1,800 or around 7% of vehicle M.S.R.P. That would be a good formula to remember. In some states a law forbids the cost of a warranty to exceed 10% of M.S.R.P."
AMA,3csu62,motivatedsugar,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:43:20 2015 UTC,Electric Cars and Hybrids:   Less or more incentives for dealers to sell them compared to non-hybrids? Favorite fully electric(non-tesla) and favorite hybrid? Will a Hybrid truck ever come back/hit mainstream? Just thinking about soccer moms or people with trucks that look like they never put more than groceries in the back of their truck.
AMA,3csu62,SmartAlice,1 point,Sat Jul 11 02:25:57 2015 UTC,"Hybrid technology is vastly different depending on manufacturer. The Nissan Leaf and Chevy volt are both nearly 100 percent electric but can't be compared to a Tesla. The Honda civic and Prius both rely on an electric engine assist design. The problem with hybrid vehicles is reselling or trading the vehicle. Having said that the Prius generally does a little better with consumer to consumer sales but that is the only one. A manufacturer will typically have similar incentives on hybrid vehicles as non-hybrids but a consumer will usually fair with better discounts simply because few people buy hybrids. I had a hybrid waste away on a lot for 14 months before being purchased. You better believed that customer got a great deal. I don't believe hybrid trucks will ever be mainstream simply because the weight of the battery will interfere with the towing capacity.  In summation, hybrid vehicles can generally be purchased with greater savings due to inventory age. Hybrids are typically difficult to resell consumer to consumer because of technology concerns. Hybrid batteries rely on nickel and cadmium minerals that are mined in west Africa which raise concerns of pollution, mining corrosion and human rights.

My loving wife helps and reminds me to do thing like eat and sleep. I have a therapy dog as well and she helps a lot. I am not going to lie to you it's been rough. Sleep now comes in the form of a sleeping pill. Eating is generally not so much a desire but a chore of choking down food and trying to keep it down. I have started seeing a  psychologist once a week to. Talk out the pain. But what really at the end of the day keeps me going is that my little girl needs me to fight this battle for her.

For the first week, a very good friend stayed with me all day to talk to me, help me function - I was definitely severely depressed at the time. That helped a ton. I didn't use any maintenance or anything, and from prior experience/friends find that it rarely helps in the long term. My best before was less than 2 weeks. Sleep was terrible, one of the worst parts of wd for me and I had very rare, fitful sleep for the first two weeks. I was back to a pretty normal sleep schedule in maybe a month and a half. I know everyone's different, but I'd say the worst part for me was when the diarrhea of years of constipation hit me at the same time as intense vomiting. Nothing like needing to scratch my entire body, vomit, and shit at once for hours on end. It got better for me after 4 days physically. It felt like a very bad flu until a little over week after, at which point I was finally able to eat, smoke, keep things down consistently. At that point I started working out like a fiend, an insane amount of running. Also - this is huge - I joined the Navy. They made me wait 10 months of hell. So in the mean time, I started hanging out with the few people I knew not on anything. I volunteered three or four days a week on top of work. I posted lists on white boards on my fridge and walls. All of the things I lost because of heroin, every terrible thing I felt in withdrawal, all of the things I had wanted to do before but never could, and the plans that me and J had made that I was determined to do for her. I really wish I could offer better advice but... this is all I've got. Note that despite knowing a lot of fellow addicts in my day, I don't know anyone else who used more than a year or two that's quit on their own successfully, so definitely consider treatment."
AMA,3cmte4,CaVac0,7,Thu Jul 9 04:18:05 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the great response man, let me start by saying I'm very sorry for your loss, I know we all have lost one or more to this dangerous game. I've thought about a career in the military but since I went to detox already that's out of the question now. It's just the boredom that kills me. Getting clean is the easy part, staying clean is the hard part in my eyes. 3 in bed the rest in your head. Did you ever do NA, or thoughts on the program? I've dabbled a little in the program but when they state they are not tied to any religion but then spew that you have to submit to a higher power and get real preachy it throws me off. I know it's not for everyone, just looking for your opinion."
AMA,3cmte4,quietriotress,4,Thu Jul 9 04:30:06 2015 UTC,"I feel what you're going through there man, I made it through those first days a few times but honestly it's so much harder when you're over the physical symptoms, it's easy to forget/trick yourself into believing it wasn't that bad but just remember it's not true. Just try to keep busy and remember that you kind of have to relearn how to live a life. I did nothing, so I can't speak first hand for NA, but I guess it works for some. I know a couple people that have decades sober with them. That said, it was really bad in my high school and today I know quite a few people that quit through rehab, though worth noting most weren't shooting and didn't use all that much. Hang in there man. Just remember, you can do it."
AMA,3cmte4,chriszerocool,0,Thu Jul 9 05:04:08 2015 UTC,Cold turkey can be dangerous (like severe alcoholism withdrawal). You're lucky in many ways.
AMA,3cmte4,Ol-Spaghetsy-Hat,11,Thu Jul 9 13:36:49 2015 UTC,"To clarify this is a myth. There is nothing remotely dangerous about quitting opiates cold turkey, except that there's a very high chance you'll fail. The only withdrawals that can kill you are alcohol and benzos."
AMA,3cmte4,starrie,5,Thu Jul 9 15:59:34 2015 UTC,"It took a month before I got a solid nights sleep. I know it's near impossible but it felt like I got no more than 15 minutes a night for the first couple weeks. I felt insane. Showers helped me, it's like the one place where life doesn't suck so much. I'd stay in til I ran out of hot water then get out for 45 minutes then back in. Just focus on how awesome it will be to be normal again. It's been years and I often think ""what a beautiful day to be clean."" NA wasn't for me. Just felt like a lot of effort focusing on an aspect of myself I wanted to change. I, like a lot of others started drinking. It effects your brain similarly so it's a common crutch for a newly clean person. Bad decision, ended up making worse decisions as a result. I got clean 3 times, each was easily 5x more painful than the previous. The last time what kept me strong was knowing the pain I was experiencing was for something important and to quit trying would mean my suffering was for nothing. Good luck, shit is not easy."
AMA,3cmte4,MartyVanB,5,Thu Jul 9 09:48:33 2015 UTC,What made you decide to quit?
AMA,3cmte4,MobiusAurelius,7,Thu Jul 9 03:38:21 2015 UTC,"TL;DR version is someone very close to me died of an overdose, and it was bad enough to make me stop right there."
AMA,3cmte4,TheDivineRhombus,4,Thu Jul 9 03:46:10 2015 UTC,"Congrats! what you have accomplished takes balls. i am also a recovering addict, 8 years clean off of benzos - 3 years off of booze.   my question is - I have a friend that has a been on methadone going on two years. she wants to stop but is scared of the withdrawals and how long they will last. how long did you feel shitty for after you stopped? what took the longest to go away?"
AMA,3cmte4,mjingafala,2,Thu Jul 9 13:18:24 2015 UTC,"Thanks man! Well in terms of physical symptoms, it was just about 4 or maybe 5 days for the worst of everything to go away, then I felt a bit like I had the flu for another 5 days or so. I mentioned above, it took a very long time - month and a half, possibly a bit more than that - before I had a remotely normal sleep schedule. I rarely slept the first 2 weeks, after that some nights were alright, others I wouldn't sleep at all.  EDIT: I should have mentioned, methadone can really draw out withdrawals. I don't have personal experience with it so I can't speak on what that's like."
AMA,3cmte4,mjingafala,3,Thu Jul 9 14:34:33 2015 UTC,"Honest question.  I dont get why someone does heroin for the first time.  I have never tried it but i know it feels awesome.  I am sure i would love it but I damn sure know what it does to you and I damn sure know how addictive it is. So the question is, why did you even try it?"
AMA,3cmte4,chriszerocool,3,Thu Jul 9 13:40:48 2015 UTC,"Well it didn't happen over night. I started smoking a lot of weed the summer before I went off to high school and was hanging out with a bunch of potheads, people with older brothers, etc. Other stuff would come around, trips, pills, and so on and we'd try whatever. I slowly started using other drugs more often. I railed an oxy one day, then got my hands on morphine pills, and loved both of those so started to do it more regularly. After about a year I was hooked on pills, then you realize heroin is honestly just a lot cheaper. One day someone offered to shoot me up, once you're already doing all that already it's pretty easy to think it's ok. That went so far beyond anything I'd ever fault, and I was hooked.   Also worth pointing out I was only 14 when I took my first percocet, barely 15 when I was hooked to the point of getting sick on pills. I'd seen all the DARE movies and stuff but at the time I hadn't seen irl what it could do to someone's life."
AMA,3cmte4,chriszerocool,2,Thu Jul 9 14:53:20 2015 UTC,"Did you ever feel like people made light of what you were going through or how big of a challenge it would be to quit and stay clean? I wouldn't say I know a lot about heroin and have been fortunate enough to never know anyone who was addicted but in your post you called it a ""pretty serious addiction/ and I assumed all heron addictions were pretty serious.   I'm glad you have been able to quit and told your story here. Hopefully you've inspired someone to quit or never try it."
AMA,3cmte4,mjingafala,3,Thu Jul 9 15:55:17 2015 UTC,"I hope I'm not making anyone's addiction sound like a petty thing, because it's all very serious. What I meant by serious is that I was shooting up in high school while most kids would only be snorting afaik, and using more than most long term junkies I knew.  No one made light of my situation. I may as well come out and say, me and this girl were pretty much a thing since childhood. I came home one day to find her dead on the floor from an overdose. People knew what had happened, and while they may have not understood the addiction they could at least imagine what that was like."
AMA,3cmte4,chriszerocool,2,Thu Jul 9 16:20:32 2015 UTC,Did you have to cut out the other users from your life?  I've been clean for 3 months but my gf still uses.  She has been trying to quit but it seems like she's not taking it seriously.  Every time I hear that she's going to use I get really bad cravings.
AMA,3cmte4,RassimoFlom,2,Thu Jul 9 19:09:03 2015 UTC,"I mean... I mentioned in some of the responses that a girl I really loved died from it, I have a hard time dating anyone now and could never be with someone that uses. As far as friends - yes and no. Like I said I joined the navy, when I got out I didn't go back and live in another city about 5 hours away from home now. I completely removed myself from that social circle, but have a handful of very good friends that I knew before all of it that I've stayed in touch with from then that still use. I couldn't be around them on a regular basis."
AMA,3cmte4,Mad_Hatter_Bot,2,Thu Jul 9 19:52:28 2015 UTC,I met a new friend who asked me to try heroin saying its the best shit ever. Myself I know better than to try herion (religious beliefs allow for weed only) and I have pretty good self control skills so I turned her offer down. I don't judge my friend for her habit but I've never hung out with a heroin user before. What should I look out for?
AMA,3cmte4,mjingafala,13,Thu Jul 9 04:00:24 2015 UTC,"Hmm I'm not entirely sure what you're asking. If you're saying things you need to be concerned about for yourself - Are you a generally nice person? If this is basically a stranger, there's a very very good chance they are just hoping to use you for a fix. DO NOT ever loan them any money at all. Watch your valuables. There's also a good chance if they're offering you heroin right off the bat they're just a dealer trying to turn you into a junkie to come buy from them once they stop giving you free bags. Other than that I don't really know what else you're looking for in an answer."
AMA,3cmte4,lord1cyrus,7,Thu Jul 9 04:26:50 2015 UTC,That's what I was looking for.
AMA,3cmte4,the_wolverine88,2,Thu Jul 9 06:07:02 2015 UTC,"People who drink want to drink with others. It's like saying ""we're both being stupid so it's ok!"" I'm not saying to trust the person with the keys to your house, but a lot of people play with the drug and never become junkies. It's dangerous as hell and I would never suggest anyone try it, but of all of the people I know that have I'd say half of them developed dependencies. Pretty sure I read somewhere it takes 21 days of consecutive use to become addicted (average person, average body size, etc.). So it's like going from a weekend pot habit to pot head, blazing every morning and asap after work/school (i think we've all been there). It's very cheap in the beginning before you develop a tolerance, If your friend is new to the drug I highly doubt they're trying to work you for money. Don't get involved with junkies, but don't just assume that because they like it they are one. I had a couple months where I thought coke was awesome, but at the end I realized it kinda sucks and the hangover is not worth it."
AMA,3cmte4,JesteroftheApocalyps,5,Thu Jul 9 09:23:52 2015 UTC,"Dude. One thing I have to point out. Not sure where that comes from but there's no way it takes 21 days straight on junk to be ""addicted"". Most people get sucked in using every couple weeks, then few days, then are already starting to feel sick/feel like they need it. And imo if you shoot up twice it's game over.  EDIT: Edited to add though, thanks for saying that - one of the really rough things is coming to the realization that you lie to everyone you know that's sober and can only be honest with other people doing the same thing. It's great to be treated like a person sometimes."
AMA,3cmte4,bmike909,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:38:27 2015 UTC,"I don't doubt the 21 days thing is b.s., pretty sure I found that on errowid our some other ""drugs rock!"" web forum."

It was really rough at first because you basically have to relearn how to live - you have no beneficial habits or semblance of routine that doesn't revolve around scoring dope. But, now even if I see it my thoughts just jump immediately to the person I lost. I also still have a whiteboard with a list of reasons I'm clean that I read to remind myself."

I did every once in a while after I quit, but I ended up in the military and didn't want to screw my life up again over something as petty as weed. Now I just don't really care for it anymore. I'll drink sometimes, but that's definitely a slippery slope for some people. I've personally never had the slightest issues with alcohol dependency."
AMA,3cmte4,ruskeeblue,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:15:01 2015 UTC,"I spent 8 years in Cambodia and for the first 4 I was snorting heroin. I was working at a hotel and was buying it off of the banquet manager, who just about everyone knew was a heroin addict. But things were slowly getting out of control for me, and he eventually ODed. All the pharmacys there sell codiene over the counter, so I was able to wean myself away from heroin with that and a combination of vitamin drinks, alcohol, and codiene fizzy tablets with paracetamol.  How did you do it?"

You need to have something to live for and I guess there's not much choice but to find it in yourself. Personally I also love to write. I mentioned above I made some lists. But I also sat down to process everything before I signed up for the military, and wrote down everything that happened - how I felt about losing friends, how I felt about myself while I was using, what the physical dependence felt like, all the lies I told over the years, how I hurt, disappointed, and let down the people around me.

AMA,3cmte4,Saituchiha,3,Thu Jul 9 15:58:04 2015 UTC,"Most of the things I'm talking about here relate to IV users. I don't know if your friend is smoking/railing right now but it's a whole different ball game. I would try to talk them out of it, warn them how much harder it is to quit. If that doesn't work maybe tell them how hard it is to hide as well. It's one thing when you have to go to the bathroom every couple hours to snort a line, it's something else entirely when you can't let anyone see your arms or have to shoot into groin/feet/etc so that no one can see the track marks. I switched up where I shot and just got lucky, but for a lot of people those track marks and scars will be there forever. There's also a very serious risk of skin infection, and abscesses are probably much more common than the general public would think (think Requiem for a Dream but more common and less extreme, most people just cut and drain them themselves). They're disgusting.  If he or she is adamant, try to at least get them educated. Some people know surprisingly little about the health dangers. If they're doing it often, try to make sure they always have needles. DO NOT EVER SHARE A NEEDLE unless you're ok living with HIV or Hep C for the rest of your life. Find the location of needle exchange clinics. Try to get naloxone, it's an opioid antagonist that will stop the body from absorbing the chemical and can be a life saver as some people are adamantly opposed to calling 911 (or will hesitate too long weighing the consequences). Find locations here, it can be nasal spray or an injection straight into muscle."

You are restless, sweating buckets, feeling like shit. You vomit profusely and will probably shit your pants, as years of constipation comes to an end. There's also pretty serious joint pain, especially your knees. I believe he ended up falling asleep. There's virtually no sleep the first few days, and weeks of waiting to return to a normal sleep schedule.  I guess it also can't be captured in a movie but there's also the constant knowledge that all you have to do is pick up a phone to stop the pain."
AMA,3cmte4,Saituchiha,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:02:22 2015 UTC,"First, off congratulations man. I just want to share my hope, and strength with the rest of the addicts out there. Things will get better if you work for it. Four years ago I was a junkie, stealing things from my family and killing myself slowly. I decided I didn't want to waste my life and I sought treatment.   It took me two years to get it right, and I wasted a couple using the drug. I will never get back those years and that is the most difficult part.  But, after starting to recover I enrolled in college, excelled, and now I will be going to Law School at a reputable university in the Fall on a Full ride scholarship (I'm 25).   Moral of the story is things are not hopeless. There are hundreds of famous ex heroine users who lurk in the shadows: Charles lamb, Edgar Allen Poe, Samuel Taylor Cooleridge (just to name a few).  The secret to recovery is having a desire to quite; putting in the work it takes to recover what you lost; and then having a reason to stay sober.   For me, my reason for staying sober is myself. I love myself more than anyone and I do not want to slowly kill myself.   Looking back after four years clean I still have lots of issues: drinking too much, cocaine, relationship issues, the general malaise of an asshole. But, I'm a strong individual with a bright future, a reason to live, and a desire to do something with my life.   I never thought my life would be as good as it is today when I was sleeping in someones closet (basically) shooting heroine alone, detached from myself and everyone I loved. Best of luck to anyone looking to finally put the past behind them."

AMA,3cro8i,RandomRatGuy,1 point,Fri Jul 10 14:03:17 2015 UTC,"I work on a large dairy farm, and I had just delivered a heifer (girl) from an older cow. Since we don't have sonograms we have to check the cows via sticking our arm (with a glove on) inside them, for a possible twin.  To do this we herd the cow into a headlock feeder. It's just like it sounds, a trough of hay or grain that is connected to a lever system that locks the cow's head in place so that we can safely check the cow for health issues.  Well I tried to accomplish this (I was alone, and this was almost 4AM) but the cow was very stubborn and very likely in birth shock, and I did not want to beat on her to move forward, so I resorted to using the gate next to the headlock to push her against the wall and pin that instead. So I checked her through the gate (no twin), and planned to unpin her to let her rest with her newborn, but she was pressed so tightly against the gate and wall that I couldn't unpin her.  So I gave her a little tap to move forward to give me some more leverage, and she did. But as I went to unpin the gate from the wall she kicked/jumped into the gate causing the steel crossbeam to smack my shoulder. The force threw me to the ground and I just kneeled there in agony for a few minutes before calling for help."

AMA,3cplvb,Bmontbear,3,Thu Jul 9 19:35:38 2015 UTC,"I've done a lot of helping the homeless and I worked at a hostel for a few years. you would not believe the amount of people on the street who thought the exact same way that you are thinking now, and ended up stuck in some city with no money begging for change, or addicted to drugs, or beaten and robbed somewhere. The people who do this and have a great time are going in a group, or as a couple, or when they already have means of some kind and the common sense to go back when things start going downhill.   They all thought they planned better than anyone gave them credit for. they all thought they would be safe. They all thought they had no prospects where they were and nothing ahead of them in the life they were in. That thinking is ignorant and stupid. If cost of living where you are is too high or jobs are too scarce, move. If you don't like your parents, wait and move out. If you can't get your dream job, pick a different job. There are plenty of paths away from where you are now that don't involve throwing yourself to the wolves."

AMA,3cplvb,TigerGradKC,2,Fri Jul 10 03:05:34 2015 UTC,"Not saying you're ""running away"" from your problems, but have you ever thought of sticking through it? If that is absolute not an option, go abroad and be productive, if you've got a skill research ways you can get paid for it immediately in another country. Also, consider programs like [AIESEC](citizen.aiesecus.org) which will allow you to go abroad for an extended amount of time, and volunteer or work, while also sight seeing and just hanging out. It's awesome. You meet SO many great people and they're open minded and accepting and truly love you for who you are. Please consider it and ask me all the questions you want, I've got a lot of positive things to say about it. Good Luck!"
AMA,3cplvb,samusXaran,1 point,Fri Jul 10 01:18:00 2015 UTC,I have though about sticking with it. It's just hard to consider the prospect of there being no future when I'd be in survival mode 'out there' all the time. And that thought is incredibly appealing.

AMA,3cpkjz,JezzaN1,1 point,Thu Jul 9 23:03:36 2015 UTC,"I am corporate based.  The company I previously worked for had 2200+ stores internationally and only 3 IT offices served them.  The biggest location had about 1000 IT employees, the 2nd location had about 300 and the other had about 100.  I was located in the first location working as a Network Engineer.  It was a high demand, long hours and no work life balance type of job.  I was in engineering there so I was constantly researching new technologies  and putting those in.  Technology changed everyday and vulnerabilities were discovered every day.  Our organization  was structured as the technical engineers, architects, sr. architects, manager, sr. manager, director, sr. director, VP and so on.  I think management there was over done.  Getting a simple PO approved or engineering plan approved was a pain in the neck and took weeks.  It was ridiculous and overdone.  But the job taught me alot, I worked with alot of people that had 10+ years of experience in IT so wouldn't trade it for anything.  The company was huge as I told you earlier, we had 2200+ stores internationally.  The main corproate office I worked at had about 5000 people working there(IT, Business, Finance, HR, Supply Chain, Accounting, Media, etc).  The entire company probably has about 200,000 employees."

AMA,3cqqqc,herupandir,2,Fri Jul 10 00:55:26 2015 UTC,"Really depends. Average sale is anywhere between a gross of 1500-3500.  The minimum mini you can make on a car deal is $100.  During a month it varies on how much traffic we get. A good salesman should maintain a average of 15-20 car's a month. Again this depends on the type of dealership, if it's high end vehicles or a new/used dealer.   edit to be a little more clear to your first question, you get a commission % off the gross of a car deal, most dealer's have different pay plans, a ""master"" pay plan is usually a salary + 15-25%, but again, there is other pay plans where you can get paid on the front/back of a car deal."

AMA,3cqqqc,MicahMordecai,1 point,Fri Jul 10 00:57:21 2015 UTC,"Well that's where the sales process kicks in.  You want to do your best to not lie to a customer and get in the trick bag.  A heat case is never a good time. You must interview and fact find what they are looking for and trying to achieve.  As for ""push a feature"", that is part of being a salesman, you highlight average features and make them seem spectacular, even if every car comes with that same feature. example:  ""Ok, folks great thing about this car is it has a great safety feature in the hood called ""crumple zone notching"" what that entails is if you are in a head on collision instead of the hood shooting straight back through the dash into your lap, it causes the hood to bend Upwards."" even though every car has this on the hood."

AMA,3cqqqc,will_code,1 point,Fri Jul 10 01:14:21 2015 UTC,"No, most people are smart enough to do research online. It is much harder to sale vehicles and make a profit nowadays because of all the tools and internet research tools you have access to. Depends on the buyer also.  Are they looking for a sports car? well then they will most likely want a manual transmission and want to know the horse power and such.  Do they want a big truck with a lift to pull their trailer? Then they will want to know what the axel ratio is if its a 3.73 or a 3.74, what the towing capacity is, if it has Operator command regeneration for the exhaust?  Depends on the type of customer.  Which boil's back down to your interview and fact find."

If, as I've said in other posts, you're an asshole, that's another thing altogether.  However, you don't seem to be one, which leads me to believe that you're simply a person who...who doesn't get angry.  That's crazy!  :)  Do you have any siblings? brothers and/or sisters?  Do you get along with them and/or your parents, etc?  How about your teachers at school?  Are you in any ""special/developmental"" classes?  Your words don't strike me as ones coming from an individual with any ""mental issues"" in the least, but I ask the question about the school classes nonetheless because I know that society probably tries to pigeon hole you as having ""something wrong"" with you and I wouldn't be surprised if you get put in those sorts of classes, etc."

Other than that, I'm pretty happy about it, i often laugh at people who are angry wich makes them even more angry somehow."

Then, people with anger issues can train with neurofeedback to reduce their anger impulse, using your brain output as a model.

Condoms turn people off when watching porn so I keep myself safe by being on the pill and making sure that the guys are clean too. :D hope I could help, I'd really  like to see you're nude modeling portfolio, if you don't want to, it's cool but yeah, please?"

Years of therapy taught me some useful coping mechanisms during a panic attack, and the ones I found most helpful were: *Being aware of my surroundings-- that is, taking note of the things I hear, see, and smell, which usually leads to the realization that there is really nothing threatening around me and my thoughts are just exaggerating an imperceptible threat. *Deep breathing. This is important because it forces me to relax and it also immediately quells my symptoms of anxiety. *Distracting myself-- anything that takes my mind off of my macabre thoughts and lets me focus on something benign instead. For me that would be taking note of my surroundings (as indicated above), knitting, reading a book, etc."

Me personally, it doesn't bother me much. Being libertarian, my views sort of fall into the ""government go away and let people do their thing"", but that really only extends to the gay marriage thing.   Now, as it stands, I can still go out and get a gun just as easily as years ago. I'm from Texas, and believe it or not, it's actually more difficult to get a gun here (background checks, waiting periods, paperwork, and a hold on ammo purchases) than it is in some other states. If that right was taken away, quickly or slowly, then I would start to be upset.   So to the point. I feel as if it really hasn't been that quick of a change. This has all been sort of on the horizon for some time now. And at the moment, more rights for people doesn't bug me, when we start losing rights is when I will start to be upset.    Do people such as yourself experience a pain or depression regarding where the country is going? I know for me, the pain runs really deep, and affects me in ways you can't even imagine.    The way our country is going does scare me. Namely because the two primary parties are in the boat of ""spend more money we don't have"".

AMA,3cocca,ezcompany210,2,Thu Jul 9 14:31:06 2015 UTC,"What is your stance on trickle down theory and the wealth gap?    See this is interesting, because conservatives seem to be very split on trickle down. For the most part we're against it. I personally thought it was a good idea, right up until it didn't work. At that point myself and many others realized it wasn't a good plan. Now for the split. Some say ""give that money to people, they'll spend it"" and others will say ""leave that money in the government, we're in enough debt and trouble already"".  EDIT: I failed to answer the question about wealth gap. Our thoughts are, if you have a large sum of money/are earning a large sum, you earned it. In some instances this isn't the case, but for the most part it is. Thus, if you worked hard to get what you have, it shouldn't be taken away for use by others who didn't work as hard.   However, there's sort of a split between the top %1. Some say ""they earned it"" other say, ""when you have that much, you are really at a point where you wouldn't notice a fairly large sum of it bring gone to taxes"". I fall into the second category. I think there should be a gap between the rich and the poor. It gives people something to strive for. Just, not one as severe as we have now.   It seems rare to find people who still think trickle down is a good idea, but I'm sure there are some.    Also, I appreciate what you're doing here. I'm a liberal myself, but I'm always interested in talking with members of other parties. Hopefully this post won't get down voted all to hell.   I'm glad to do it.

AMA,3cocca,ezcompany210,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:46:02 2015 UTC,"Awesome! So I have two questions.   First is about gay marriage.   Many conservatives think that marriage should be a religion only thing. No government interference, no government benefits from it.   Then there should be a second process, that is under a different name. Government only. No religion at all, and through this process you would get your benefits.   That way, gay marriage wouldn't be legalized, but everyone would have equal rights.   Do you have/see any issues with this idea?   And the other is in regards to raising minimum wage. (I'm speaking in regards to a large jump, not a small increase).   We're generally opposed to raising minimum wage for a few reasons.   First, is the spike in unemployment that economists believe it will cause.   Second, the increase in price of goods would theoretically be equal to the increase in wages being payed out. Thus causing no increase in living standard for those people. This is thought because we see it as an increase in cost to sell the good, will cause an increase in cost.   Third and final is the concern over putting many small businesses out of business. A large hike over night in hourly wages would cause many small businesses to go under, and cause a large drop in jobs.   How would you debate against these 3 issues?   Also, I just realized I didn't answer your question about wealth gap. I'll edit my previous post to include that as well."

AMA,3cocca,infib,2,Thu Jul 9 15:10:49 2015 UTC,"Wealth isn't only a function of effort, otherwise we'd all be rich, or at least more of us. I tend to think of it more along the lines of luck (preparation + opportunity + action). It is easy to say ""my hard work got me here"" as a successful person, but without the opportunity for that hard work to return on the investment, a reflection up one ones effort can turn more along the lines of ""all this effort and for what?"". We all love the American Dream / hard work / bootstraps story, but systematically eliminating opportunities for growth and success can only frustrate the less fortunate at best. Not a statement of pity, more of math.   The crux of the wage issue probably lies closer to your view on the wealth gap than you might think. Rather than rich and poor, the gap is between the minimum wage and a living wage. If you are only just (or not) able to cover operating costs for your own basic expenses, there will be no surplus available for growth or upward mobility. Low wages and hours capped below full time force the most vulnerable into paying for needed services from already strained resources. Second jobs don't leave a lot of time for capitalizing on opportunities like continuing eduction, regardless of preparation. Health care (a benefit of being fully employed) can become a expense that has to compete with food, rent, and other luxuries like transportation, fuel and heat / AC.  Yes, there will be strain on small businesses... but businesses and corporations are NOT people, and no business has a right or guarantee to actually stay in business. Paying a living wage on full time hours with health benefits will not make the small business go extinct. Innovation won't stop. There will always be another million dollar idea put into action by someone with enough surplus to take that risk... And there will be someone else to fill their shoes when they leave to chase the American Dream."

Fire enough employees or raise prices enough, you can go equally out of business and the employees that we're all so concerned about are just as out of work. I'm going to argue that volatile resource costs (scarce materials, fuel costs, etc) pose a greater threat to business than a known cost of providing health care and benefits. Additionally, if part of successful business strategy is reinvesting and capitalizing existing resources... why is the investment in people considered to be more optional than equipment or advertising?

That is incredibly fair, but please allow for the reality that it does... and I agree, there is no need to have this devolve into an argument.  Not all towns are like yours. Where I live, it is not uncommon to see a 1k sqft house on a tenth acre lot sell for 650K and offer an hour long commute. I am reasonably well compensated for my work, but still wonder if I'll ever be able to afford a home in the area, much less my dream home. $70K would get you some nice roommates and maybe an easier commute (but it will still cost you $1500+ a month just in rent), but not much else in the way of luxuries. Affordable land and homes start around 2 hours out from one of the smaller employment centers in the area (2-3 hours from the ""epicenter""). Employment opportunities favor degrees and certifications in multiples due to a highly educated and motivated labor pool in the area, which does not entirely favor diplomas and trades.  If you're inclined to numbers, let's consider $14 hourly. Setting aside tax and 2000 hours being full-time and meriting benefits for now, that wage * 2000 hours = $28K annually, which is about $2250 a month.   $1500 monthly for rent leaves $750  calling HVAC, water and electric $100 each (on the lower side) leaves $450. cheap phone service takes $75 and we're at $375 my fuel costs run roughly $250 a month (50 mile round trip commute) which leaves $125 car insurance at $75 a month, and we're down to $50 left over   All this without ever putting a stitch of clothing on our backs or a morsel of food in out mouths. There's also no mention of a car payment, cable / internet, hobbies, modest entertainment... or other dependents (pets, children, family). Even with health care, a $25 copay could put a significant strain on this particular budget. Factoring in taxes drops the already strained monthly income by roughly $500.   Obviously some of these numbers can be fudged around some (cheaper rent, lower fuel costs, etc), but I think it illustrates the point - under these circumstances, $14/hour is not a livable wage. You'd need a second job. A different place to live, an older (probably less reliable) car. More education and training (not cheap). $70K would still present challenges, but it certainly qualifies as a livable wage... we're less worried about those.  Not all towns are like mine, many are like yours... As an exercise, how long would it take for someone working 40+ hours in my area to save up enough to move there, establish residence while looking for work, and cover all of their expenses during the search, much less find the energy required to pack and move? Wherever you live, how do you pay for penalties on late bills if the reason they're late is because of a seriously strained budget to begin with? Where do they get the extra money? What if you get sick?  This is how people get trapped.     Edit: also legally businesses are seen as people. It's why you can sue the business instead of the owner assuming it's registered properly. I get your point, but just wanted to point this out.   This is one I will fight about... but it isn't personal.  You have been able to sue businesses as entities long before Citizens United, and the notion of money as speech and the implication of personhood through this expression as a first amendment right is a gross misrepresentation of constitutional law (and creates abnormally loud voices). However, I'm willing to concede that however flawed the reasoning is, this is the current legal precedent, and I openly invite the great state of Texas (which I do love) to strap one on a gurney and spike it with a lethal dose of poison for any crimes so suitable for said punishment. It would be quite an elegant proof of personhood, no?  Also on the topic of personhood, the founding documents of this country secure the equality of all peoples regardless of race, creed or color... if conservatives love their country so much and everything that its stands for, why do they seem to so damn willing to discriminate on the basis of gender (women's health for instance), religion (islam and other non-christian faiths), race (black americans, immigrants) and let businesses become anthropomorphized through money and have a louder voice than those with actual flesh and blood?"

It's the fact that you would be demoralizing entrepreneurs and those working in the SMB sector.   If you're inclined to numbers, let's consider $14 hourly. Setting aside tax and 2000 hours being full-time and meriting benefits for now, that wage * 2000 hours = $28K annually, which is about $2250 a month.   $1500 monthly for rent leaves $750 calling HVAC, water and electric $100 each (on the lower side) leaves $450. cheap phone service takes $75 and we're at $375 my fuel costs run roughly $250 a month (50 mile round trip commute) which leaves $125 car insurance at $75 a month, and we're down to $50 left over   These numbers were staggering to me. $1500 in rent here is a 4 bedroom two story rent house on a half acre of land.  It still begs the question though. Why not leave? I understand the concern of small amounts of savings and the cost of moving, but payments on small short term loans shouldn't be a big deal if you're talking about increasing your monthly savings by thousands.  Actually, I know why. Our political views. You see it as an issue the government should solve. I see it as a solution that can be had through the economy. As people leave, pay would go up since employees would be harder to find.  We'll have to chalk this one up as an agree to disagree scenario.   Also on the topic of personhood, the founding documents of this country secure the equality of all peoples regardless of race, creed or color... if conservatives love their country so much and everything that its stands for, why do they seem to so damn willing to discriminate on the basis of gender (women's health for instance), religion (islam and other non-christian faiths), race (black americans, immigrants) and let businesses become anthropomorphized through money and have a louder voice than those with actual flesh and blood?   This makes me wonder if the only conservatives you've ever heard from were on the internet/TV. You're speaking about the people who believe only their way of thinking is right. You're also speaking about an incredibly small section of conservatives. Also, although you may not see it. The liberal side has them too. And they're just as bad."

AMA,3cocca,qweernstrom,3,Thu Jul 9 14:18:45 2015 UTC,"Some people shouldn't own guns. I'm going to get that out of the way. No one in their right mind wants mentally unstable people owning guns.   However, our thought process is pretty simple. Criminals don't follow the law. Reducing gun ownership won't effect criminals then.   I have personally been shooting (as in, grab a gun, some ammo, and a box. Go out back and shoot by my self) since I was about 7. I've never shot anyone, or anything that I didn't mean to. I've never had a gun go off on accident, and I've never had a close call.   It's better to inform people and have them know how to properly operate a gun than it is to completely remove that right.   I think that pretty much sums it up. All the incidents I've seen of people accidentally shooting someone or similar cases always seem to stem from people who were never taught how to handle a fire arm, or how to properly store one (unloaded, in a case, out of reach, and in a secret location)."

AMA,3cocca,lord1cyrus,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:17:26 2015 UTC,"So you're for gun control then?    I'm not entirely sure how to answer this. I think the best way to put it is, the system we have now seems good enough. I don't support tighter gun control, but letting your average Joe who's never held a firearm before go out and buy it, plus ammo in he same day isn't good either.   I think more people should own guns, but only if they're willing to learn how to use them and maintain them.   Also views on assult rifles?   Out of curiosity, do you know how the government defines assault rifles? I may be wrong, but last I checked I recall it having more to do with cosmetics than the actual firearm.   For instance, I own a rifle. It's considered a hunting rifle because the ammo is loaded into a slide below the barrel. It still holds 17 shots, assuming I put one in the chamber. However, if it was loaded via a magazine, my hunting rifle becomes an assault rifle. Also, certain cages around the barrels and other purely cosmetic changes cause the same change.   If you're referring to fully auto weapons, I see no reason someone with the proper training shouldn't be allowed to own one. They can be dangerous in hands that don't know how to control recoil, but really you can fire a semi auto very quickly and likely more accurately than a full auto. Not to mention, there are currently devices that attach to the slide of a rifle and the butt, then use recoil to turn it into a pseudo full auto rifle. They're legal in many states. So if people really want that feature, they can get it one way or the other."
AMA,3cocca,newmemph71,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:31:50 2015 UTC,"It sound like you believe the only danger with guns is that people aren't good enough at handling them. The problem (I think) is that in some states people with criminal records can get a gun as easy as anyone else, and in every state mental health isn't even taken into accord when selling a gun. If someone is prone to taking their life I don't think it'd be wise to give them a gun.  I was going to type a bunch of stuff, but my source for all that is this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pOiOhxujsE  So did this change your opinion in any way? If not, why?"
AMA,3cocca,jackwoww,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:40:33 2015 UTC,"I can't watch your video at the moment. I'm house sitting and the Internet here is very limited in how much data is allowed per day. Sorry.   I do believe the primary danger with guns is people's handling of them.   As for the criminals getting guns, it depends on the crime. I believe here in Texas, if you've committed a violent crime, you're just flat out unable to purchase a new gun. But that likely won't stop a criminal anyway. Actually legally purchasing a weapon would make it easier to track the person.   As for the suicidal people. There are so many ways to commit suicide, I'm not sure giving them a gun is really putting them into danger when there are many much cheaper, much cleaner, much less painless, and much easier methods.   To further that point. I don't know how it is in other states, but you're unable to purchase a firearm and ammo within a period of time from one another (I don't remember the length of time).  Obviously I haven't watched your video, but I will eventually. Odds are good how ever that my mind won't be changed."

I thought it was going to be much longer.  But no, it does not change my opinion.  Mainly because it's a clip from a liberal comedy show. It's heavily edited to make conservative ideas and people sound dumb, and sound like liberal ideas are the only right ones.  I think it's pretty obvious that a higher number of guns will increase gun violence. That's common sense. I think how ever, our concern should be the people likely to use the firearm incorrectly.  I'm not opposed to mental health being added to a background check for gun purchases, but not in the sense that someone should visit a psychiatrist before purchase. Instead, maybe people that are believed to have mental disorders should have that appear on a background check. Thus not changing the process, just the results from it.  Everything that I posted above still applies."
AMA,3cocca,TigerGradKC,1 point,Fri Jul 10 13:45:46 2015 UTC,What are your views on the Religious Right and abortion?
AMA,3cocca,TigerGradKC,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:46:57 2015 UTC,"What are your views on the Religious Right   I, and most others think there should be a separation of church and state. Religion shouldn't take part in government, namely because then we would have to choose one. It's better that everyone have freedoms so long as it doesn't impact others.  That said, I have a few family members that think their Christian values belong in government. They are the type of people you read about online. The far right bunch that thinks anything that varies from their opinion is completely wrong. Luckily this is a fairly rare type of person... From both sides.    and abortion?    I differ a bit from the norm on this one.   Personally unless the mothers life was in imminent danger, I would never recommend someone get an abortion. I don't think it's right.   Most of us think that an unborn fetus should have the same unalienable rights given to everyone else. Namely life in this case.   However, I saw a static that indicated areas with more lenient abortion laws had lower crime rates. That got me thinking. Eventually I came to the conclusion that, I'm not convinced it's better to live a life with a family that doesn't want you, than it is to not live at all.   When I point this out though, the general response is ""that makes sense"" not ""you're a heartless monster"". So I think the general opinion will change slowly over time."

AMA,3cm8n4,shoeboxolies,1 point,Thu Jul 9 03:50:19 2015 UTC,"Truth be told I've had trouble with negative internal monologue my entire life. I've more or less stopped however, and I stopped it by reading books about psychology. Instead of letting myself live out the negative emotions without any control, I step out of the emotion I'm feeling and question it's rationality or why it's being caused.  Example: Before I read my first book about psychology, I had a lot of struggle with an ex girlfriend I was dating a few months ago. Our relationship had gone on the rocks and she said that she needed some time alone to think about whether this was worth continuing.  This was in the middle of my depressed phase, and I had no idea that depression was exactly what I was going through. I made myself the victim in the story of my relationship between her and I, like I was being used emotionally. It got to the point where even when I tried to study, I would get distracted for an hour about how much fear or resentment I had towards her.  At some point in that process, I stepped back from my emotions and realized my internal outbursts were preventing me from completing what needs to be done (the recognition of being abnormal came far after). At that point, I immediately calmed down."
AMA,3cm8n4,TOgirl8,2,Thu Jul 9 13:29:32 2015 UTC,"Kregal,  I am not sure what books worked for you but two books that did wonders for me were the Untethered Soul and Flow.  The first one convinced me about something I suspect in my own self reflection phase. And that was the person saying negative things in my mind and the person listening...which one is you? the truth you! when I realized that every negative thought there is just as positive thought. For example, I am not good enough for my boyfriend. I would ask really? is that the truth or some bullshit...and sometimes that makes me laugh.  I started to relate more the one listening in my head than the one talking in my head. The talker was a trouble maker and the listener was more at peace."

AMA,3cm8n4,squigglylegume,2,Thu Jul 9 15:16:09 2015 UTC,"Good post. I also overcame a debilitating childhood wounds but self reflection and character change.  I also used writing articles, poems, and noting my dreams.   The first thing I decided was: Am I living my life the way I wanted?  Am I the sum of my childhood? How can I change it? Do I know what love is? How do I know? How do I find it? How would I recognize it? Am I a good person? How? If not how do I become a good person?  When I had a bad thought about a person or event, I would stop and question. Is this true or my imagination? Is it automatic thought or deliberate with facts and evidence?  I also read Alice Miller and Frankl and learned that no matter how hard your past is, it is not you. You can still change and become a better version of yourself.  The way I ask questions is long and deep and I must find a satisfying answer. I find the more I am blaming and externalizing the more I am in the deep.  For example: I was single for a long time. So I asked myself why am I single? I said because I have not met the one. But then I asked but you met j, m, and s...but they were not right. How were they not right? because I did not feel secure, or loved or understood. But what does secure, being loved or understood looks like? and did you give them secure, love and understanding? I do not know what that looks like and I definitely did not give any of those...then how did you know they were wrong for you? I do not know...I just did not feel it. But what is it? I do not know...I felt they were wrong, so what was wrong? maybe I was not right for them. How do you know? because I did not feel right around them. But do you ever feel right about anyone? Not really. So then how do you know you have not met the one? Maybe I did meet the one but I did not recognize or I was not the right one for them or I am scared or fearful. Are you scared or fearful? yes I am and what are you gonna do about it? I do not know. Well if you are scared and fearful do you want a guy who is fearful and scared? No definitely I do not. then why do you expect to him to want you. because everybody deserves love. but you are not giving the same chance, why would a person give you the same chance. hmmmm yeah right. I do not want a depressed guy but I am depressed so no one should want me. How do I stop being depressed? or should I accept another depressed guy? hmm I should learn how to stop being depressed. I think that will be easier than finding a depressed guy and dealing with him. but how do you do that? what am I depressed about? I am lonely. I am sad. I feel not good. I am worthless...am I really lonely or alone? I need to distinguish these two. I am sad today but am I sad all the time. No I am happy sometimes. so it is OK to be sad sometimes. I need to accept my sadness is part of me but not the whole of me. am I really worthless? who is saying this? I do not believe I am worthless. I am a good person. I am generous person.   This dialogue is of course much faster and more depth when it is in my mind but I sort of debate myself and use logic to debate myself rather than follow the negative thought. Of course also I just note, I am sad and stay with that and hope this too shall pass. But the minute I acknowledge my sadness and say I will cry for while, I already know there is an end. Cause I am also giving that permission to cry for while and get on with my life after.  At the end, I learned, I was the one judging, running and avoiding relationship. It was never a matter of not meeting men or not meeting the right one. I met plenty of men but I had my own negative narrative of why they were wrong. When I realized I was sad and running away anything reminding me of sadness...then I started to change my continues sadness and realized my happy state brought whole new set of men too and boom, I found him while happy and told him, I am happy now but I do get sad sometimes...he said that is OK we are human after all...and he is a keeper!"

AMA,3cmjmh,vegasmystery,2,Thu Jul 9 02:58:42 2015 UTC,"We do put one 480v panel in, and it's to feed the light poles. All the other panels are 120v and 277v. They are all 3 phrase panels, each one rated for 400-600 amps. The lowest voltage we do is 120v. All the terminations as far as the data and fire alarm and refrigeration, they have another set of electricians come in and do those. Yes I am paid by the hour. We actually do use aluminum wire on pulls like the main feeds and to and from the transformer pad. They allow us to do this as long as we upsize on the wire gauge and of course the pipe it's going in. The entire building contains 7 electrical panels. 4 of the panels are 120v, one of the panels is 277v, another one is 480v, and then you have the main breaker all by itself."

No, we don't use the IR to check our taps, but they do sonogram any concrete that we pour to make sure the rebar is correct and anchor bolts are set and whatnot. A shit load of pipe goes into that building, we get a little over 15k foot of pipe delivered, that includes all 1/2"", 3/4"", 1"", 1-1/4"", 2"", 2-1/2"", 3"", and 4"", pvc, rigid, and conduit combined.

Whether or not intelligent life exists is something entirely different.  But it'd be really freaking cool to know if there was any. I'm looking at you Area 51"
AMA,3codu5,Riddle0219,2,Thu Jul 9 18:33:31 2015 UTC,"So without proof, common sense would lead you to believe in a possibility of life elsewhere in the universe. I agree. I would think the mathematics of Earth being the ONLY instance of not only life, but also intelligent life, by pure chance is very low. I don't have numbers to support that claim.  Using that same logic, why is the possibility of God (and the burden of proof/evidence) a larger leap for you?

AMA,3codu5,sonny411j,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:02:36 2015 UTC,"Well, first off you need to understand that alien life and an omnipotent, omniscient, omnipresent deity are two separate things.  To believe that there is something else out there that is like ourselves, is pretty easy. I mean the proof for life is all around us, and there is always the possibility that life could exist somewhere else in the universe.  The problem is when it comes down to saying ""there is a god and he created us"". Well I don't see any proof of this. With intelligent life, we ARE the proof, if you understand what I'm getting at. Given the same conditions somewhere else in the universe (something that is a feasible idea), you'd expect there to be life there. With a god, there is nothing to support the claim.   Hope you understood this, I'm not great at getting my point across through text, sorry!"
AMA,3codu5,heather37marie,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:12:14 2015 UTC,"I understand you. :)  I, too, have struggled with the existence of God but had been agnostic theist.  I think what made me lean towards theism, and ultimately believe it, is this: Something had to have set in motion what we call the Big Bang Event. From what my mind is capable of concluding, that something/someone had to have existed before the big bang and had to exist outside of it. I could not find any logical basis for the existence of the universe to BE without this thing/person having started/created it. And I think that's a reasonable argument for the existence of God. It's not provable and but it is believable.  I think once you believe in the possibility of God having been the initiator of the big bang, the other qualities you listed naturally fit Him: omnipotent, omniscient, omnipresent."
AMA,3codu5,communityminded,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:33:48 2015 UTC,"What you're describing here is a mix of the ""god of the gaps"" argument and St. Thomas Aquinas' ""Argument from Causation""  Honestly, I understand what you mean. Its difficult to comprehend what caused the big bang, what was before, etc.  A god causing this is very believable, but my issue lies with: what started god?  If God is the exception to the rule of ""everything must have a cause"", then why isn't it just as plausible to say that the beginning of the universe of was this exception instead? Just because we don't know how something occurred, does not mean there was an external force starting it off. Maybe we're just missing something."
AMA,3codu5,communityminded,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:47:32 2015 UTC,"I can empathize with the argument that the beginning was the exception and not a preceding exception.  For me, it makes more sense that an intelligent being—arguably the most intelligent one—would be able to create the necessary things for a universe to exist—space, time, matter—than those three things themselves. And I guess I rationalize that based on human history; we create tools to do things or language to describe things. And it took a human person to create those tools or languages, not the tool/language itself. So it seems more logical that a person created the universe—via the Big Bang—than the alternative."

AMA,3cfxbl,MrNeedAbout350,41,Tue Jul 7 16:34:43 2015 UTC,"I'm posting this to give you an answer on why this happens. My SO is from Hong Kong. His parents were very strict, and he's gone through a lot in his life. Not many people outside of China, Hong Kong, & Japan understand the pressures that society puts on men.   Family reputation is a big thing there. Doing something to make your family look bad is a complete disgrace. So as a man in Hong Kong, China, Japan, you are looked at as the one who has got to pass your family name and reputation along. As a child families usually make you study harder, sign you up for things you might not even like, like piano lessons, and force you to do them. Mistakes you get punished harshly for. Some families even beat their children if the child messes up. (my SO went through this) The community looks at this like it's normal, as long as you don't really hurt the child. You are told all your life you have to study or you will fail. And actually you will fail which is the sad part. Hong Kong at the end of High School, you get a test. You have one chance to pass this test, and if you don't you can't go to the university there. So for people with no money to move to another country, or people who aren't allowed to go to another country that is basically the end of the line for you to get any good job. A lot of the women in Japan are gold diggers, not because they are horrible people, its just how they were raised and taught.. find a man with a good job, and that has money. So there is another reason for a man to feel like he has extreme pressure on him. Also based on how much money you make and the job you have, in your community you can be looked at different.   Also some other things I've learned by just watching which fucking wows me, my SO had to go to china for a month. The whole time he was there he basically was forced to drink. It's just part of the culture in China. Successful men, or men that want a job, are asked to drink. Sure they can turn drinking down, but they are less likely to get the job.. however drinking doesn't mean they have a higher chance of getting the job either... just if they don't drink it's 0 chance of getting it. My SO was sick so much. I was honestly fucking worried.   My SO during college, his parents called him every day and just bitched at him over his work. They even went as far as calling a counselor at his college because he got a B. They told him if he didn't go, they would make him move back to Hong Kong. Extremely protective and crazy imo. Then when he told them if they didn't stop he was going to quit and never go to school again, the he didn't care, and that they needed to just relax and give him space.. his brother called him and bitched at him for talking to his parents that way.  Then on top of everything, in a lot of these places there is public shaming. Your wife gets pissed at you over something bad, she will shame you in public. This is sorta rare, but does happen. Maybe some of you have saw videos of it. People think its funny when they see a video like that in America. BUT it is not fucking funny. Your wife gets pissed over like you buying something she didn't want you to buy, starts yelling calling you worthless in public, and instead of the people thinking she's crazy, they think the man is pathetic for not being able to handle his wife, or his family properly.  If you do anything wrong (and not only law wrong, but societies version of wrong), your family's reputation gets put down. And in Japan, Hong Kong, & China, yours and your family reputation is a huge thing. Being disgraced can cause you to lose your job, make it harder to find a job, or even be extremely criticized, or rare but possible publicly shamed. It can even make your childrens future harder if your reputation gets messed up.  The responsibility and stress that is put on men in Japan, Hong Kong, & China is extreme. It's no wonder that lots of men there commit suicide, or even hide out in their house (Hikikomori).   A lot of other stuff I could go into also. I probably left tons out. Now my SO isn't a hikikomori, but he understands the full culture, and has tons of anxiety and just overall issues now. I could answer a lot of questions if you want, and if my SO is up to it, he can also if you want to know more about certain Asian cultures.   Edit: Also women in Japan are known to treat their husbands pretty cruel. Which makes a lot of the men not even want to get married at all over there. Which as you can guess, makes them pretty lonely also in every day life. Which does play a part in hikikomori."
AMA,3cfxbl,HikikomoriAnswer,8,Wed Jul 8 05:48:06 2015 UTC,"You say reputation can lose your job or prevent future employment or mess up your kids lives. How does this work? I'm in the USA, I have 4 employees. Beyond the stuff on their resume and a criminal background check, I don't know what they've been up to for the past 5 years. I certainly don't know about their family and stuff that happened 20 years ago. How do people find out about this stuff? Why not just move to a different city or different neighborhood? China has 1.2 billion people, Japan has 200 million, there's no way they all know each other, so can't you just vanish into the numbers?"
AMA,3cfxbl,YouDontKnowZebra,1 point,Wed Jul 8 10:59:32 2015 UTC,"Okay so even in the states, who are the people you usually hang out with besides family? People you work with, or people who you met doing your hobbies (gym, gold ect). Usually if something small happens it's kept inside the family or group of friends, in the home, and no one finds out about it. But if you make a mistake at work, like for example in china refusing to drink, or just messing up with numbers.. because there is so many people looking for jobs, a small mistake like that can cause you to lose your job. Then losing your job shows up for other job opportunities, and unless you are in a very rare line of work, chances of you getting another job easily are very slim. Then losing your job or not having a job will eventually get around to your larger group of friends, which means its possible to get out-casted or looked at different.. because if you don't have a job you are basically looked at as worthless or lazy, even if its not exactly your fault. Also a lot of big jobs, are found for you after you graduate highschool, through your family friends. If your family's reputation is bad, it could be a lot harder for them to help you find a job. It really is a lot about social criticism, and where you and your family stand in society.   And yes there is cases where they can move.. but it's expensive. There is a lot of people. People don't have the time or money to just move, move, move.   Also jobs you look for in the future, will ask about previous jobs and ext.   When I mentioned kids.. I meant for example, your kid goes to school. They find out your parents are poor, don't have work, did something shameful (like cheat on their wife, which btw the women there sometimes make their husbands wear green hats if they cheated, showing everyone that they are cheaters.) Then you as a child, have it a lot rougher. Teachers might even look at you like you will head in the same direction, less time might be spent on you. Other children will not want to hang around you as much, because their parents don't want their children hanging out with the ""poor uneducated kid"". So it becomes a social issue also. Which means ofc he is less likely to do good, because that much pressure is already on him on such a young age."

As for why they do it? Social anxiety, depression, various other problems lead them to seek escape or relief. Where do they find this relief? They find it in online games, forums, chats, and through media. Say you have social anxiety, you go out and you feel uncomfortable, maybe get ill from it. You don't feel that same way while behind your computer screen, you'll eventually avoid what you dislike and do what you enjoy more. Escapism is an easy thing to get trapped in, especially when you barely even understand why you have the problems you do."

I did a bachelor's degree in Marketing and Management and a Masters in Intercultural Business Communication. Personally I think it has helped me out a lot, but every day I see more and more people coming into the marketing industry from a variety of backgrounds. As long as you are passionate about the subject, your degree shouldn't really matter.   3) I can tell you that until a few years ago I was walking in your shoes. I was in Uni and I find it really hard to get my foot at the door. My secret? Determination and perspiration. I was working as an unpaid marketing intern for my university while doing my bachelros degree and then I interned as a digital marketing specialist for a charity while reading my masters and these are the reasons why I get hired in my current job. So go out there and work for free, get the practical experience that will help you not only add something valuable to your CV but also gain insight into the industry and make some connections. This experiences have been worth their weight in gold for me. What you have to remember is that marketing is a popular field where 100 applicants fight over for 1 position. Consider going the extra mile! Here is a little something I wrote for Buzzfeed that depicts my journey (http://www.buzzfeed.com/dimitrinkazh/no-speak-americano-career-advice-from-a-foreign-1asxn). Have a read and let me know what you think. I hope that helps."

AMA,3cg20q,crlfromen,2,Wed Jul 8 00:10:04 2015 UTC,"What does ""support"" mean to you? If I can reflect on my own experience a little, my parents would give me money if I needed it and asked, but they would never bother themselves with things like showing up to my afterschool events or caring about my performance in a competition. Even now I feel torn between wanting to impress them and knowing no matter how well I do I'll be disappointed by their lack of concern. It's more than a little de-motivational and am wondering if it is at all relatable. I fully realize this is probably not at all like your situation, but it is one part of why I am so curious."
AMA,3cg20q,steve582,3,Thu Jul 9 00:46:37 2015 UTC,"I spent the better part of a decade teaching English to the Japanese. Of all the English-learnt Japanese quirks and idiosyncrasies, the tendencies, patterns, habits and all those myriad of little things  - this guy doesn't exhibit ANY of them. Not a single one. Even the ones who learnt overseas for decades have tell-tale signs. Yet this is a guy who's not left his room in 2 decades? Yeah fucking right.   In my mind, there's a zero % chance of him being Japanese. I'd swear on OPs grave he's an impostor getting his Japanese kicks."

AMA,3ciyq0,UnicornWiz4rd,1 point,Wed Jul 8 07:29:25 2015 UTC,Have you every been able to use reddit to promote the magazine?  Otherwise what does this entail?  Lots of twitter and Facebook?
AMA,3ciyq0,IvyGold,2,Wed Jul 8 08:02:03 2015 UTC,I spent alot of time researching what we can do best with social media and I still haven't found a way of using reddit in a beneficial way other than using the news posts for clients.  Not so much facebook but definitely alot of Twitter. Facebook has alot of methods to make it so you have to pay to get your stuff seen. Though that being said our followers from Facebook are all in places that are behind the european circuit on technology.  Twitter takes up alot of time but LinkedIn and managing some of our own sites take up some of my time as well as liaising with our clients who have needs that we can meet :)
AMA,3ciyq0,IvyGold,1 point,Wed Jul 8 08:21:33 2015 UTC,"Ah, LinkedIn.  What a resource!  You must be more professional than most mags.  I've always wondered what would happen if a magazine just created a /r/nameofmymagazine and simply posted its articles there to use reddit as a free comments section.   Unless of course you pay for subscriptions, which if you're a LinkedIn vet, you do.  Maybe a best of series of postings?     followers from Facebook are all in places that are behind the european circuit on technology.   What does that mean?"
AMA,3ciyq0,mjingafala,2,Wed Jul 8 08:27:20 2015 UTC,"LinkedIn is almost a hub of testimonials that we use as a ""Yes this is us we're not after your companies money we genuinely have good customer service""   The thing about journalism is you don't want anyone to know you're working with a company until release day. If we publish our stuff in a wide format where anyone can see it then we give away our clients name contact etc. and next thing we know we don't have that client.  Making an /r/ would be very bad for this because companies that sell information would have  a field day! Though we did toy with the idea a very long time ago.  Basically our followers outside of europe (Asia UAE etc.) prefer our Facebook whereas most european followers prefer twitter. Some even prefer LinkedIn and we publish across some specialist sites as well."

I was in Catholic school for K-8th grade and then I went to a public high school where I stopped my beliefs entirely.  So, my question for you is at what moment did you loose your faith?  For me it was when I met a muslim in high school.  He was so enthusiastic about his faith I could not believe it.  I had assumed all other religions were useless, but he showed me how much he loved his.  So, after talking to him I started doubting my own faith as it could not be true if it contradicted his."

You're taught that anything you think is wrong unless it goes with the Catholic beliefs. I think the moment I started losing faith was around my sophomore year. I never went to church on sundays or even holidays, my family isn't very religious. Being around other people that weren't just white rich Catholics opened my eyes to a lot of things I hadn't seen before. And just not being around religion in high school what so ever, I just lost interest in it as a whole."

Plus the skates need to be approved by Sonic. I worked my way up from carhop and then just rode the promotions. My life is a lot better now that I am gone. The people I worked with was good because they were all nice and willing to work (except for one or two). The problem was the head manager that ran the store. It made working there unbearable.

AMA,3cguup,ecnal321,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:45:20 2015 UTC,Worst part was the occasional insect being found in someone's food. It's embarrassing for everyone but especially the store. There are easy ways to prevent it and I don't know why they did not do more to fix that problem.   The best thing from Sonic I think is spicy chicken strips. When we had boneless wings those were amazing. Also the Pucker Pie blast and Brownie Berry Blast are both incredible. The grossest thing people usually got was a chocolate slush... A chocolate slush consists of x amount of pumps of chocolate topped off with sugar based slush water... It is pretty gross but people got it.

AMA,3chmds,wordlesswriting,1 point,Wed Jul 8 01:13:22 2015 UTC,"working, they have had a change in thepast couple of years that when your youngest child turns 8 you loose your parenting payment and go onto a job seeking payment, whick makes it so hard for single a parent that have been out of work for a long time, studying costs money and most jobs require a higher certificate of education just to apply for it.  then getting a job, we have to find a job in school hours, or pay top dollar for afterschool care, which is full cost when you no longer recieve centrelink payments..most places in the area wont just employ a 30+ yr old on junior part time wages.  other people are cracking it over the heathcare, they want to bring in a $7 fee for doctor appointments that when you are on a health care card are bulk billed (free) -that im not fussed about as my sons doctor is a flat fee of $150 anyway..   if i can think of any more that arrise i will edit  EDIT:: the basics card, this means that payments from centrelink will be put into an account that you have like a bank card to access it, the only place you can use it is the apporived businesses, that means no cash, will upset a lot of people on payments who dont use their money the way it was meant to ( alchol, drugs ect) it is an idea being thrown around at the moment"

AMA,3cdwyh,TheEmeraldRaven,13,Tue Jul 7 03:53:32 2015 UTC,A friend of mine worked there as well. He actually stole from them because it was so easy. No one kept tabs on discounts or stuff like that. Is it like that in most gamestops?
AMA,3cdwyh,Lideyuh,18,Tue Jul 7 03:57:43 2015 UTC,"I mean I'm not a thief and do not advocate it in any way. To my knowledge no, not at my store anyway. But one time a few years ago I walked into a Gamestop a few towns over and literally stood alone in the store for ten minutes. There was no one in there at all not even behind the register. Ten min. later the one employee on duty walks in through the store's front entrance with a coffee from the shop next store. I could not believe it."
AMA,3cdwyh,SHAAZZZAAM,11,Tue Jul 7 04:01:10 2015 UTC,"In a few ways, that employee is a hero. They're likely getting paid close the minimum they can be for their position, (I live in UK so am literally guessing that it could be similar to us, but if I'm making a faux pas and GameStop employees are paid a mint, please let me know) but expected to give the maximum. You give a little, you get a little, his comfort is worth more than anything in that store, to him, and he's not being motivated to care by means of fair pay so he doesn't. Plus if your stores are anything like UK, the boxes are on the shelves but all the discs and consoles etc are kept behind the desk in locked drawers or out the back behind coded doors, so literally no theft would occur if he left. Which when your being shit on by a company, is more than enough to make you go ""fuck it"" one day."

AMA,3cdwyh,Javin007,4,Tue Jul 7 05:02:35 2015 UTC,"Well to be honest I've always hated shopping at Gamestop. I dislike how their business model can really hurt game developers and I feel that buying something at gamestop borders on harassment with all the extra crap they try to get you to buy/pre-order/sign-up for at the register. So I really hated being a part of that. Why take the job? Well because I LOVE video games and until I worked there the idea of getting to talk about games and get paid for it was AWESOME. Other than that, real shitty hours, a very clique-y staff, and generally poor customer service provided by some other employees with tenure really got on my nerves. Many other things I could mention but I figure if I kept going on I should just write a book lol"
AMA,3cdwyh,Javin007,0,Tue Jul 7 05:08:09 2015 UTC,"I've always had excellent customer service when going to a gamestop, and generally find that the employees there are also gamers who are knowledgeable and enjoy talking about the hobby.    The ""upsell"" has never been more than, ""Would you like to sing up for Game Informer?  (yes please) or ""Would you like the strategy guide for that?  (Which is also usually ""Yes Please"").   Sounds like you may have had a bad experience at one specific store.    Really, if that's the worst you've got to say about them, I've gotta say they seem pretty amazing compared to what's out there in the skilled labor world.   Currently, I'm making an hour and a half commute because my company hasn't been able to get off THEIR ass to get my clearance crossed over for over a year.  I don't have an assigned desk, I have to provide my own laptop, I have to pay for parking, and I have to pay for the EZ-Pass (or take the 3 hour route).  I provide my own phone, paper, and pens.  I don't have access to my FTP from work (but strangely, do have access to Reddit) so have to do a small part of my work at the end of each day from home, which I'm not paid for.  The AC in this building doesn't work well, so it stays close to 80 (not enough to be dangerous, but enough to make it uncomfortable).    And this is par for the course.    Gamestop sounds pretty awesome to me right now."
AMA,3cdwyh,Kim_Jong_Uuuuuuuun,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:10:30 2015 UTC,I've had two room mates who worked at game stop. One (among many) of the awful things they had to complain about the job is that they were required to make so many up-sells just to keep their job.  If there was another game in town (pun unintended) I'd honestly shop elsewhere for my games. I hate walking in to game stop and the clerk is sitting there trying to push pre-orders and shit on me and I don't want to be rude because I know it's not his fault that he's required to do it just to keep his job but god damn is it annoying.

First of all apply to as many places as you can and if any of your friends are working somewhere, ask them to put in a good word for you.  Fast food and retail are your safest bets. Between the two I preferred fast food by a long shot. Its not glamorous but its also not difficult, you get decent hours, and people are generally chill. Also retail will give you shitty hours in the summer. Most important of all, LIE LIKE HELL when they ask if you will be able to keep working in the fall. 99.9% of places WILL NOT hire you to work for a few weeks since they get a ton of applicants who can work much longer. Just don't mention it and when the time comes, quit if you have to"

I understand that we all have to get, by any means necessary sometimes, but just quitting really screws over all of your coworkers who put in their blood, sweat, and tears day in and day out.

AMA,3cdwyh,imonmymobile,2,Tue Jul 7 09:07:40 2015 UTC,I wouldn't pull this shit if a friend hooked me up with the job but honestly when you're working somewhere that doesn't value you as an employee (won't give you hours when you need it and has no problem cutting your hours down to next to nothing just because there's been a slow sales week) WHY should you give a shit? If employees don't value themselves more than companies do then companies have no incentive to even make token gestures towards valuing their employees.  It's the same argument for working your ass off when you're being payed minimum wage. They only pay you minimum wage because they know there's always a sucker willing to put in 12.00/hr worth of work for 7.15/hr. There's no incentive to provide better pay and that's lead to the current system we have in the retail world of companies staffing their stores at absolute bare minimum needed to function and just over-working the chumps they have instead of just hiring an adequate amount of people to actually handle the workload.

Unfortunately your advice sucks and you're clearly a fucking moron. If you're especially skilled or have connections your line of reasoning might work, but it breaks down after that. A lot of people  don't have better options (I know, shocking news people might not want to be treated like shit at wal-mart).  Large companies are well aware of the plight of their workers but they don't care. They are only accountable to their share holders and making sure they get as wealthy as possible at the cost of all the people they are shitting on.

Far too many of my own dates felt like really awkward interviews instead of fun getting-to-know-you-better meet-ups. I'm curious if you have your own checklist.  Also, maybe you could define ""fuckboy"" and ""quality dude""?"
AMA,3chlbl,SkyPork,2,Wed Jul 8 00:41:05 2015 UTC,"That's something that I think about sometimes, too. Ok to be honest, I'm about an 8.5-9 (depending on how polished I look that day) and I have weird features because of my eastern european heritage. My problem is that people have told me that I look intimidating (I swear, this is what I have been told several times and I swear it works against me). I think people assume I have a boyfriend or that I'm a stuckup bitch. Guys typically don't believe me when I tell them I'm single and it confuses the fuck out of me. (If anyone has insight on this I would REALLY like to know why guys think this?)  With that in mind, I find that I have to approach guys first to disarm them and let them know I'm not a meanie (which sucks but oh well) and I do it casually, just a hello, start a small convo near the bar or at a meetup. So that's where the mental checklist comes in. I guess I look for how adaptable a guy is. Because I usually have to initiate conversation, I see if they can level the field. I let them know I'm interested in talking to them and see how they run with it.  If he sees me as a nice person, does he continue to stay relaxed or does he see it as an opportunity to fuck me and try to go straight for that? Does he introduce me to his friends in the circle? Does he make me feel welcome? I look for these things because I like a guy that is warm and inviting. If a guy is caught like a deer in the headlights when I approach him, I will usually politely end the conversation then walk away. It actually is good and attractive when a guy isn't easily intimidated. I have dated guys that were not super attractive because they made me feel comfortable and not like a freak, and were accommodating and I really appreciated that. And I let them know it ;).  Fuckboy: basically someone who knows they're hot and is arrogant about it, hits on as many women as possible a night with the goal of getting laid, texts them at 2 am with a ""wyd"", begs for nudes, won't make time for you unless he wants to bang you, checks out other girls in front of you or flirts with them (bye), keeps his life kind of vague so you don't get in too deep. your typical douchebag but it has a new term i guess.  A quality dude is the opposite of those things I suppose, but even moreso is selfless and willing to help people. A compassionate man is such a beautiful sight, it's unreal. Especially when he does little things for you like grabs your sweater for you when you both go out so he's thinking about you being cold in the restaurant, orders you your favorite dessert or gives you the ring in the Cracker Jacks box. It doesn't have to be a grand gesture, but letting her know that you're looking out for her is so sweet. I appreciate these things and it makes me happy, therefore I will make him happy and make him look good, too. Without respect and honor, a relationship is pretty much a fluke I think."

AMA,3chlbl,rndmguy1232123,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:33:35 2015 UTC,"My experience as an average looking guy who is socially successful with women when he tries:  The 8-9's are the most attainable because of the reasons that you stated, but primarily because there is a lesser instance of pathological insecurity that needs to be sated by dating a man that is out of their league (higher) or fragile ego that is threatened by dating a more average looking man. These women often need less external validation from whom they date. The issue is, as you stated, that guys are intimidated and thus they are approached less often by normal men. This also works in favor for the normal men who will approach them.  There is a phrase that goes ""6's acting like 9's"" that has arisen from the opposite dynamic of average to below average looking girls needing more external validation and thus being more difficult to attain. They tend prioritize the power game and short lived boosts to their self esteem over relationships, will be mostly treated poorly by the boys whom they do date, and will be both prudish and promiscuous depending on what the guy can do for her shaky self image (ie: rejection or acceptance is based purely on how powerful it makes her feel in the moment). Ironically, they are approached the most often for sex both due to her and his low self esteem. Dating these women offers no return in physical attractiveness nor personality for men. The loneliness, abuse, and low self-esteem of these women causes them to behave in ways that further the cycle and make them bad bets for any self respecting man."

AMA,3chlbl,ugh-_-,2,Wed Jul 8 00:04:59 2015 UTC,"I have tried Tinder, OKCupid and Plenty of Fish and finally Match. The other services are free, I haven't had much luck on there. Met some cool people but no one really worth keeping in touch with. Match however, you have to pay for, so I imagine people are more serious about finding someone worthwhile.  I have been a member for only 2 weeks and I get about 5-10 new messages a day from different guys. It's been overwhelming I'm trying to keep up and these guys really put a lot of thought into their messages. I have yet to encounter one rude or disrespectful person and that warms my heart. People seem pretty genuine here. So if you're looking for something serious, I would consider Match.  First thing I actually notice is their username. Sometimes guys will have something like WillLuvUForever or Perfect14U and honestly that seems kind of desperate. Have a username based on your name or something, nothing that suggest you will take what you can get. Second, the default profile picture of course. Use a clear image with only you. When I see pics with a group of guys or a guy with sunglasses I usually ignore them. Have at least 5 photos with a couple full body shots and show your teeth. When I see pics and guys aren't smiling I automatically assume their teeth are gross.   Fill out your profile and add your quirks! Don't be shy. Don't try to hard to play the good guy card, just be fun and and interesting. If you are really into collecting something random or have kooky hobbies or places you hang out at, mention it. This is what makes you stand out! Lists of things work really well, too... like a list of things of what you are in to, first date ideas, cool things you'e done, place you've worked, etc. A good headline would be ""New to this, open to whatever"" or something that isn't so romeo-ish. Keep it casual, like you're here just here to check it out. I've responded mostly to guys who have a relaxed headline like this versus ""Looking for the girl of my dreams"". That's just too corny for me.  I think that it's really important to sell yourself as someone fun who is easygoing. The intensity of how bad these guys want to meet someone makes me a little uncomfortable because I feel like there's so much pressure and they're too into me already, like I owe them a full date when I'm actually kind of scared of committing to a whole evening with them.   Start small with becoming acquainted with them. Most girls just need to know that you're not a really intense clingy guy and that you're fun and responsible enough to have a girlfriend. Definitely fill out your whole profile and mention things like old fashioned and old school morals, standup, classic, romance, honesty, easygoing, fun, feelings, communication. These are rare things to find in guys so that would give you a competitive edge.  If you want a response, by all means, avoid a generic message like ""Hey what's up?"" You have like 2 seconds to keep her attention. I get so many of those and unless their username or photo captures my attention I won't further look into their profile. Unless they send me 3-4 messages...then I will continue speaking to them just because there is so much clutter on the site. It's hard to stay focused. So use the time you have to message them wisely! I would suggest actually googling a list of interesting first date questions and use them here. Send one or send a few, she'll probably answer. For example:  What's your biggest goal in life right now? Where's your favorite place in the whole world? What kind of things really make you laugh? Do you have any pet peeves? What were you like as a kid? What should I know about you that I'd never think to ask you? Do you have a nickname, what's the story behind it? What do you hate the most about the dating process?  These are all really good questions and I would be excited to answer them and see their responses as well.  I've never ignored messages out of being annoyed with them, and the ones who have messaged me 3-4 times (and sometimes you have to to find something interesting worth talking about) have usually received my # at that point to take the conversation offline."
AMA,3chlbl,ugh-_-,1 point,Wed Jul 8 00:49:59 2015 UTC,"Firstly, let me apologize for the brevity of this response, as I am still at work and only have a couple mins to be on reddit.  Thank you for taking the time to write such a detailed answer for me, you have no idea how valuable that information is!  To give you some background, I recently graduated college (just last month actually) and found a job almost immediately in California, so I moved there from Canada (where nice girls are a dime a dozen) and from out of left field, I am finding myself meeting girls that are exclusively interested in me because of the field I work in, or they are the stuck up ""I grew up in beverly hills so i'm better than you"" type. It's actually disgusting how they feel so entitled, but I guess that's LA for you. I mentioned this to me neighbor and he suggested the online dating as a way to get to know the girl before actually meeting, so I could weed out the ones that aren't actually serious about any sort of relationship."
AMA,3chlbl,ugh-_-,1 point,Wed Jul 8 01:29:58 2015 UTC,"Sure, I am happy to help. Congratulations on your degree-- it's hard work. Mine took me 8 years ha. What did you major in?   LA is a different vibe. People there are funny. I live in the county over and worked in LA for a long time. What you see isn't usually what you get. People are wishy washy, looking for other sparkly friends to hang out with. If there was ever a place where there are too many options and not enough action, I think LA is it. But to be fair, there are some pockets of people who value really fun and deep relationships/adventures. If you are in the tech or TED speaker/tinkerer space, they are like that especially. I could point you in the right direction."

Like just because they opened your car door, you owe them nudes. They expect a lot for doing basic gentleman things. Guys, even if you buy a girl a $100 dinner, she doesn't owe you shit. Have the sense to tell if she will be good company or not then decide on that prior to committing to a dinner date. A good woman is an investment.  Respect yourself and women, basically. Have some class and style. Yes some girls are shitty, too and there are reasons fuckboys exist, many girls enable that kind of behavior. Similar attracts similar so if you're a nice guy, you'll find nice. If not, look elsewhere. Bars and clubs won't really work IME. Meetups and Toastmasters events have been really good for me in that sense."

I never took that many in that short of a time span, but I did keep a constant intake of about three to four good hits a day for almost a month. Needless to say, I failed out ofcollege with a zero gpa. It took a while to recover but I did. Best experience, during a snow storm watching the flakes melt and dissipate on my windshield with the defrost on.

I also helped a friend sell some blow, so it ended up getting mixed with other things. A buddy in the dorm had some adderol that I'd snort too. Plus maybe a case of corona per couple of nights. I got ceriquils from another friend to help me sleep. It was a wild time. Ever seen Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas... Needless to say, I am sober and a college graduate now, with honors. People are more resilient then you might think. Though I still can't spell the names of drugs. But it essentially comes down to knowing yourself and what to mix when to keep up the party without going nuts. I liked to day trip, then when I'd start to come down I'd maybe take one more, do about a gram and a half of coke. After I'd start to feel shitty from that, drink and take the sleep aid. Crash. Rinse. Repeat.  Maybe that's cheating, but I had a damned good time. It wasn't good for my body, but I'm alive and well, and that's the point."

Had I jumped, there's a good chance that my chute would have just opened up at 13k feet, and would have been a long trip down.  What could have happened though would be that the chute would have grabbed onto the tail and dragged me along with it (which I probably could cut away from).

We have so much corruption due to a major cigarette corporation named ""King Mountain"" and the owner is thriving off the no tax zone by not paying taxes on his merchandise. The owner also has a hand in the politics of the tribe by buying out the community to have them vote for his people into office. Every Christmas season he gives away a truckloads of gifts to our kids and these aren't just any trucks but they're full of Ipads, Ipods, bikes, PS4s, etc and he uses this to gain more support from the community. He actually threatened my grandmother when she spoke against him and he has been pretty ruthless on other people as well.   I don't think we can do much on our own until this guy gets what's coming to him, this is all very real and we deal with this type of tyranny. The sick thing is that the FBI are trying to crack down on him but they can't come onto the rez unless the tribal officials (a majority of his people) agree to let them.   TL:DR: No because we have a asshat on our rez who controls the offices and casino."

Even if they don't change it they're still going give off a bad image. The fans look ridiculous in the fake war bonnets and I think they're just punishing themselves.

I can dig it up if it would make a difference to you.  The reason I ask is we have something similar in my home town of Perth.  Our first governor was a guy called Stirling.  Depending on who you ask, he led a massacre or a police action against the Aboriginal people here.

I am not sure what to think of the situation but that hopefully whatever happens he just gets buried and put to rest, everyone deserves that.  As for the creation story what do you mean by that exactly?   For 4th of July/Independence day we celebrate it, not much else to say there.  We did have a protest a few years back around the Northwestern region (Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Montana, Northern Cali) about equal rights for Native Americans, treating the Earth better, respecting the treaties, and a few other things. You can look it up for more info it is called ""Idle No More"". It's still ongoing.

That is, it seems pretty evident that Native Americans will never again rule nations, relegated now to small reservations thanks to racism and 'progress'. Do you intend to integrate? I mean, you're a Reddit user. Do you intend to keep your family's traditions alive? Is there hope of returning to what was once yours or is the outlook just of survival now?   P.S. There's a Star Trek episode (that is admittedly not great. With a probably steorotypical NA first officer on Star Trek: Voyager) it involves the idea that after space colonization is easy, Native Americans are literally given a planet to do their own thing on. I think it's a cool idea, you?"
AMA,3cazwr,indie_pendent,5,Mon Jul 6 20:10:58 2015 UTC,"I don't mind answering it in all honesty and this question needed to be brought up! So thank you for asking it. I agree that I'll never see our people thrive and prosper like they did in the hundreds of years ago and the challenges of keeping our tradition alive is at a high level of urgency.   We have elders who are passing away who know our songs, traditions, and teachings pretty much and just last weekend I was helping get ready for the feast and no young men are stepping up. That is the problem, men on the rez (reservation) don't thrive or make it long before getting thrown in jail and that has to deal with trauma from generations and very few actually do make it out before the pressure of alcohol, marijuana, and other setbacks get to them. I am one of the few who actually have never smoked, drank, or even went to jail because of my parents and grandparents stepping up and others are joining in as well. I see a bright future for many tribes but it's going to take a lot to get back to where we once felt proud.   I am concerned for my tribe though and I do know the challenges. I record stories, songs, and words just so it doesn't die which is a huge worry. Integrating wasn't that hard for me because I wasn't always raised on the reservation but instead in areas like Seattle, Walla Walla, Los Angeles, and Portland so I got to see how other cultures act, how to speak for myself and just get used to the outside world.  The outlook for not just our tribe but all tribes is balancing on whether the kids and young adults get serious about their lives because the reservation is too much of a cushion and they don't realize that. A lot do not leave the rez and instead just stay to repeat the cycle. But I have been only saying the negatives and I apologize, but we do have a lot of others who plan on working with the youth and doing great things. We have a group called the Swan Dancers and I actually worked with them for several years, they're a group of young girls from the youngest at 4 years old to the oldest at 19 they have done numerous performances and they're widely known around our area and a lot of people love them. They sing traditional songs, they speak and practice our language, and they actually dance the correct way so we do have a lot of hope and I do want them to succeed.   I do plan on trying to keep the tradition alive so I can make my grandmother happy and my mom happy. I do have hopes for the future of our people.  I hope I answered that well.   Tl:DR: It sucks that we're in this stage. It sucks that I won't see a majority of our people proud. I know both worlds of being on and off the rez. I do plan on keeping traditions alive and teaching. There is hope and I plan I working to keep that hope strong."

AMA,3cexgs,ThumperLovesValve,1 point,Tue Jul 7 12:38:51 2015 UTC,"Well, it's just like it sounds, buy Adwords for pages with Adsense on them. Ensure you are making more than you spend. There are two issues you need to consider: 1) Making a site built exclusively for Adsense is frowned up, meaning you are going to need real, valuable content that offers something up(Don't build the site around adsense ads 2) Quality score, creating pages made to exclusively generate Adsense revenue will likely not have a QS high enough to make money. I think the best way to make money with Adwords is to obviously have a product or CPA program where the ROI is high enough that you can spend money to make money."
AMA,3cexgs,ThumperLovesValve,1 point,Tue Jul 7 13:21:02 2015 UTC,"Well, it's just like it sounds, buy Adwords for pages with Adsense on them.   This hasn't worked since like 2008. Even if you manage to find an exploit in site evaluation, you would need a large amount of websites or a huge amount of traffic to make it profitable for the short period of time before you get slapped by an algorithm update. In the scenario where you actually build a website with great content there are smarter ways to monetize it than AdSense."
AMA,3cexgs,WhiplashOne,1 point,Tue Jul 7 13:37:38 2015 UTC,"interesting would you care to elaborate on other ways to monetize a high traffic site, and what would be considered high traffic,  I have no experience with adsense as they are kept separate in the business so would love more info if you don't mind you are quiet right about getting slapped eventually as I have just finished up working for Google and I know they take this very seriously and would ban you for life in an instant"
AMA,3cexgs,kbergstr,1 point,Tue Jul 7 14:51:26 2015 UTC,"AdSense's model is pretty simple - You are basically renting out space on your website to Google for a percentage of the ad revenue.  As for high traffic or ways of monetizing a website, it really depends on the website in question. The main things to keep in mind is what type of content are you delivering and what type of audience do you have. For example, if you have a small niche blog you will probably go for AdSense. If that blog grows and you have a ton of recurring visitors, removing ads and focusing on sponsorships pays off more, as nobody really likes ads and a lot of people have ad blockers installed. I'm typing on the phone so its a bit clumsily put but you get the gist."

Unless something gets seriously screwed up on the hotel's end, or you're related to/banging or are one of the owners, the chances of you getting a full comp are minimal at best. Now, if you checked in to your room and something was atrociously wrong, like if there were a bunch of bugs or a dead body or something, then you would probably get a comp.

AMA,3ca2fy,aaron9410,10,Mon Jul 6 07:37:26 2015 UTC,"This would be really cool to hear. Fun related story!  When I was in college I worked at a small hotel and we had a couple of these giant washer extractors (think those things you see in the giant laundry rooms in the movie fight scenes where the hero inevitably punches someone with a hot iron). The manager was really cool and was okay with us doing our own laundry in them when they were idle, but they were seriously hot and powerful and would use bleach, so you couldn't do all your laundry in them.  I managed to track down the user manual for one, and the cycles were programmed by hitting combinations of the keypad in a certain sequence. You'd type in a code, then the cycle number you wanted to program (0-99), then you could type in other codes for what you wanted it to do and for how long (so like, 020 for wash with detergent, enter, 010 for ten minutes--it's been like ten years, so this isn't even remotely accurate).  Anyway, I designed a cold gentle wash cycle using just detergent, then one night when it was quiet went back into the laundry room, picked the lock on the keypad, and programmed it into cycle 99. It worked great.  I let my manager know what I'd done the next day and she was actually really happy about it because she lived on the property and didn't like having to go elsewhere to do half her laundry."
AMA,3ca2fy,userexec,8,Mon Jul 6 14:38:27 2015 UTC,My LG washing machine and dryer play cute little tunes at the beginning and end of a cycle. They also play a tune if you cancel the cycle.

AMA,3cdpfo,NoHandsNihilist,2,Tue Jul 7 03:04:38 2015 UTC,"I had actually met her for the first time last summer when I was taking a couple of language courses at a local university here in Beijing. I'm from the US and she is from Pusan, South Korea. At that time her Chinese was a lot better than mine, so she often helped me out with classwork and we also hungout on occasion with other classmates. She was always up for a good time and held her own with us younger folks. Before we left China we exchanged info and stayed in touch with the occasional email.  I came back to China about a month ago for an internship, same area. She had also mentioned that she had been planning to come back to visit for a few days, so last weekend she came to Beijing and we got together with a couple of other friends. We had a lot of booze, got drunk and fell asleep at my place. Not too much really happened that night. Woke up a few hours later lying in bed together. I started to do some more touching, etc., but she said she wasn't comfortable there and wanted to do it back at her hotel. We took a cab back to her place and from there got to doing the knitty gritty. Really interesting experience. Afterwards we stayed in bed together for a while, then later that morning went to breakfast. She was really open minded about the whole thing. We even chatted about it a little. That same afternoon we parted ways and she went back to Korea.  If y'all want any other details, feel free. I'm not shy."

AMA,3cdpfo,Clamdilicus,2,Tue Jul 7 14:21:16 2015 UTC,"Haha alright man I'll try. For starters I'd say she's somewhere around 5'2 and probaby weighs about 100lbs. Black shoulder length hair, very pale skin, wore red lipstick and with a hint of blush. Wore a blouse with slacks and traditional looking heels.  Very skinny. I remember I could feel her spine, and her hip bones protruded around her pelvis, which actually stung a little to hit against after laying it to her for a while. Legs were slender and had nice shape, especially around the calves. Tits were small but not old and gross looking, standard set of nipples, really soft. Not much of an ass but was proportionate. Overall she probably met most of the beauty standards of her time. Her snatch was pretty tight and she kind of helped me put it in right because it was a little tricky at first. Not a whole lot of room, and I'm just an average size guy. It wasn't soaking wet, but once we got going it worked pretty well. Just nice and warm and moist."

AMA,3cdpfo,redditors_r_manginas,2,Wed Jul 8 01:49:00 2015 UTC,So how did y'all meet?
AMA,3cdpfo,Naitra,1 point,Wed Jul 8 01:55:34 2015 UTC,"We met last summer when I was in Beijing. I was enrolled in a local university taking a summer Chinese language course. She works in Pusan, South Korea as a tour guide, so she had taken a leave from work to take the course for the summer as well. Her Chinese was already near fluent and mine was on the lower end the class, so she would sometimes help me out with homework or other classwork. She was always quiet but nice to me, so sometimes when me and the younger folks in class would go out I'd invite her to come with us. She spent most of her time alone but she was usually up for anything and was always a good sport. Rumor had it that she had never married. As the summer went on I got a reputation for being somewhat of a partier. One weekend me and a couple of guys went out to the Sanlitun bar district, got a little too fucked up, and things ended up going pretty bad. Could've been a lot worse. When I saw her the next time she warned me that I needed to be more careful; she had heard the story. After trying to explain to her that I understood drinking that heavy was a bad habit, she smiled and said, ""I can understand."" It turned out she was an alcoholic. It was also the first time that I learned she could speak English, as up until that point she had only used Chinese with me or used to Koreans with other classmates. That same night we ended up going out to dinner and drinking lots of baijiu (Chinese rice liquor). I had to get her back to her place, and meanwhile I was also a pretty buzzed. We kind of flirted some back and forth that night and I always wondered if I could've gotten some if I had tried. We only went out one more time after that, as the summer term was nearly over at that point. We exchanged email addresses before she left to stay in touch. Later that year around December I was digging through some of my old stuff and found her contact. I sent her an email, and from there we've exchanged the occasional message this year.  A year later since meeting her for the first time, I'm back in China. She planned to stop by to visit since Korea's so close, and I guess from there is how we ended up sleeping together. So, we started out as classmates, to casual friends, to whatever you call this situation haha. Maybe I'll see her again someday."
AMA,3cdpfo,Melancholyhill75,2,Wed Jul 8 07:55:57 2015 UTC,Was she a prostitute?
AMA,3cdpfo,taway1686,1 point,Tue Jul 7 03:43:29 2015 UTC,Nope. I didn't pay anything and she was too clean to be a prostitute. She also told me that she had been divorced for nearly fifteen years and had no interest in remarrying.
AMA,3cdpfo,taway1686,2,Tue Jul 7 03:51:19 2015 UTC,Do you know if she has had other people around your age?
AMA,3cdpfo,Jing-fong,2,Tue Jul 7 05:51:46 2015 UTC,"I'm not for certain, but I'm pretty sure she hasn't. She told me she has been single for a long time, and she commented that it was a really interesting experience for her as well, so I assume she hadn't been with anyone as young as me. I think she was initially unsure how to feel about the age difference, as she had emphasized beforehand that she was old enough to be my mother. But I didn't care and obviously it ultimately didn't bother her too much. To finish off your question, I really doubt she's had anyone as young as me, especially when considering that East Asian cultures and attitudes tend to be less open than those in the West. She even mentioned that people back in her country would probably think ill of her if they knew that she had slept with a guy as young as me."

AMA,3ce87d,tgjer,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:34:18 2015 UTC,LGBTQPZ when?
AMA,3ce87d,redditors_r_manginas,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:57:48 2015 UTC,"... when what? When did support for LGBTQ equality among religiously affiliated people start rising?  Since at least the last 12 years. Between 2003 and 2014 there was on average about 19% increase in support for marriage equality among all religiously affiliated groups polled by the Pew Research Center, with Catholics up 25% for a total of 62% in support of marriage equality, and white mainline protestants up 26% for a total of 56% in support of marriage equality. That puts them at or above national average for 2014.  Even among white evangelical Protestants, who are one of the most ardently anti-gay populations, support has more than doubled in the past ten years - rising from 12% to 28%. This is even more pronounced among young religiously affiliated younger white evangelical Protestants, among whom support has risen to 45%.  There are now more people of faith in the US in favor of marriage equality than there are opposed to it.  And those numbers are all from 2013/2014, and a lot has changed since then. General public support has risen sharply, though I can't find any surveys specifically showing change in average support for gay rights among various religious affiliations from 2014-2015. But I do know that just last week the Episcopal church voted to extend the sacrament of marriage to gay couples with an 85% majority. This is not just support for legal marriage equality, it's extending the full religious blessings of marriage, and it passed overwhelmingly.  A large and growing number of religiously affiliated people not only think same gender relationships and marriages are valid, they're coming to believe that defense of the full spiritual value, social dignity and legal rights of LGBTQ people and families is part of the religious duty to pursue social justice."

AMA,3ce87d,redditors_r_manginas,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:05:19 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say ""support"" so much as I would ""tolerance."" The majority of Christian denominations have no liking or support for homosexuals whatsoever. They all follow a holy book that denounces homosexuality and considers it a sin, and don't say that its not in the bible, it is."
AMA,3ce87d,Melancholyhill75,1 point,Tue Jul 7 17:38:08 2015 UTC,"Many devout Christians, including whole denominations, don't think a universal or eternal condemnation of same gender relationships is an accurate understanding or appropriate application of the texts.  Reform, Reconstructionist, and most branches of Conservative Judaism believe similarly. These texts don't condemn all same gender relationships, they condemn sex between men (and it's exclusively condemnations specific to men, except for one vague reference by Paul) under certain conditions that were historically and culturally specific.  And this really isn't just ""tolerance"" in many cases. This poll shows not just support for legal marriage equality, which might come from a ""I don't like it but it shouldn't be legally prohibited"" attitude, but also what percentage of people from various religious affiliations would agree that same gender relationships are morally acceptable. The poll is from 2012, but even then 66% of Catholics said they were.  That's significantly higher than national average; even in 2014 only about 40% of the general population would say that such relationships are morally acceptable. And about half of religiously affiliated Americans think gay and lesbian people should be eligible for ordination as clergy with no special requirements, with only 38% opposed.  Denominational support is also often ambiguous. Officially the Vatican is extremely anti-gay. In practice, lay Catholics are more likely to support both gay rights and the validity of same gender relationships than the general public. And many protestant churches are entirely decentralized, meaning it's impossible to definitively say what the denominational stance on anything is. In some cases, like the Baptists, every individual church is supposed to be an independent entity. And within these decentralized denominations, public support is growing rapidly.  The Bible says many things, and it's frequently very hard to tell what the purpose of a commandment is or when/how/if it might still be applicable today. It says slaves should obey their masters, and it says that after cleaning mold off your walls (""house leprosy"") you should sprinkle them with bird blood (Leviticus 14). It has detailed instructions for when and how to perform animal sacrifice, and unlike dietary laws nothing in the NT specifically says that animal sacrifice is no longer necessary.  Until less than 50 years ago, for centuries most people adamantly believed that the Bible specifically condemned ""miscegenation"" ie interracial relationships or marriage. This was not a lunatic fringe, this was the overwhelmingly dominant interpretation as understood by most Christians. Today these same passages are generally understood as commanding Israelites not to inter-marry with other tribes for religious reasons.  The Epistle of James contradicts Paul's letter to the Galatians, the book of Job is a vicious attack on the ethical philosophy of Deuteronomy, and Genesis 1 contradicts Genesis 2. Different denominations can't even agree on what texts to include; pick up a KJV, a Catholic bible, and a Luther bible, and they won't even contain the same books. Is the Chanukah story in your Bible? If it's a Protestant bible it probably isn't, because most of them don't include the story of the Maccabees.  And while protestant sects tend to claim sola scriptura, the Bible alone as the source of divine guidance, other branches of Christianity including the Anglican churches, the Methodist church, and Catholicism specifically don't. They hold the doctrine of prima scriptura, in which scripture is joined by tradition, reason, and in Methodism experience as well.  There is a hell of a lot more to Christian theology than just ""It's in the Bible."""

AMA,3c6y65,Haindelmers,50,Sun Jul 5 13:39:39 2015 UTC,It would have been a proper operation. Iran is pretty advanced in sex change operations. Since it's cheap actually people from all over the world come to Iran for operations.

AMA,3c6y65,Franco_DeMayo,3,Mon Jul 6 08:51:14 2015 UTC,"""English is hard to master"" means that it's hard for people who learn it as a secondary language, if you have been exposed to it since you where a baby then it's not hard.

AMA,3c6y65,Haindelmers,32,Sun Jul 5 17:04:16 2015 UTC,"No, just being Gay. Trans people are fine as long as they submit to an ASAP sex change surgery."
AMA,3c6y65,Ndrokk,12,Sun Jul 5 17:05:33 2015 UTC,"It feels as if Iran does not want anyone 'in between' sexes, and I am glad you left Iran without a surgery.  Like many have said, it's a double standard, but at least they allow trans people to get their change and live their lives normally."
AMA,3c6y65,submitizenkane,21,Sun Jul 5 18:49:13 2015 UTC,It wasn't like that for trans people until around 30 years ago when the Supreme Leader was visited by a trans woman activist and was convinced that trans people really need to transition. Before that they believed that gender is assigned at birth and that's that.
AMA,3c6y65,Haindelmers,14,Sun Jul 5 19:04:14 2015 UTC,"Now, if a trans activist can convince the Supreme Leadee that being born the ""wrong"" gender is ok and needs to be corrected, why is it so hard to convince them of other, even simpler social truths?"
AMA,3c6y65,SushiAndWoW,23,Sun Jul 5 19:46:00 2015 UTC,"Because Islam had no official statement on trans people as the concept probably didn't exist in Saudi Arabia 1400 years ago, it is something that the scholars need to sort out here and now by themselves. These are referred to as ""matters of the day"".  Other issues, like homosexuals, or a lot of simpler social issues are directly discussed in the Quran or Hadith so the scholars don't have the same freedom."
AMA,3c6y65,submitizenkane,4,Sun Jul 5 19:55:26 2015 UTC,"I see.  In a lot of ways, Islam is similar to Christianity. Almost a sequel."
AMA,3c6y65,SushiAndWoW,14,Sun Jul 5 19:59:35 2015 UTC,"Exactly like a sequel. Muhammad claims he is the successor of Jesus, Moses and Abraham."

No offense to transsexual people, but gays deserve the same rights as you! If being transsexual is considered genetic, then being gay should also be. I hope you are doing good in Europe. /u/Majid213"
AMA,3c6y65,shaggy0798,5,Mon Jul 6 09:48:51 2015 UTC,"Well there are no verses in the Quran or Hadith against trans people, so they're fine. There are tons against homosexuality (damn luck!), then it's not fine. It's arbitrary really."

AMA,3c6y65,rose-girl94,6,Sun Jul 5 20:51:54 2015 UTC,I know a lot of Trans women who are lesbians because their sexual orientation didn't change with their gender identity. Does Iran just assume people will always be opposite-gender oriented?
AMA,3c6y65,rose-girl94,3,Sun Jul 5 22:14:30 2015 UTC,Yeah. Iran always assumes that people should have opposite genitals in order to be with each other.
AMA,3c6y65,pm_me_for_confidence,9,Mon Jul 6 00:12:41 2015 UTC,What is the current overall mentality for hamjensbaazis in Iran?  I recently took a Persian class and had a gay classmate... and most of our ethnically Persian teachers didn't even try to hide their distaste towards him... I'm guessing there must be an underground culture for men like yourself in Iran? Do you see any improvement in the future?

If I have to guess I will say that 10% are fine with it, those are the liberal people who are typically following western news. Another 10% just don't care but don't want it for their own family.

AMA,3c6y65,Haindelmers,16,Sun Jul 5 19:48:35 2015 UTC,"Was it hard to leave Iran? Did you have to ""sneak"" across the border? Also, did you actually consider the surgery so you could stay home?

AMA,3c6y65,Sanyo93117,4,Sun Jul 5 22:39:57 2015 UTC,"I'm aware both are accepted, but that's just how languages evolve over time. The correct traditionalist past participle of ""sneak"" is ""sneaked."" I couldn't care less which is used, I just thought it was cool OP used ""sneaked."" It's not something you see that much anymore."
AMA,3c6y65,blumpkinowski,0,Sun Jul 5 23:03:31 2015 UTC,"I think in this case we're referring to past simple, not past participle. Though they're the same for many irregular verbs, they're not always. For example: break (present), broke (past simple), broken (past participle). The way Majid123 used ""I sneaked"", it was past simple (as opposed to ""I was sneaked"", or ""I was snuck""). But then he continued ""by a smuggler"", so maybe he left out the ""was""...  Nevertheless, I find it fascinating that ""snuck"" is the newer form, and ""sneaked"" is traditional. It seems like a trap for people wanting to appear erudite by knowing the ""correct"" irregular form, for what is in fact a regular verb - and because so many people have done so, the verb has now become recognized as irregular. :-)"

AMA,3c9zvy,CuntSlapper3000,1 point,Mon Jul 6 10:43:54 2015 UTC,G and M codes are not outdated I don't think.  But alot of that has to do with the fact that programs such as Mastercam do all of the program writing.

I realized the drug wouldn't change anything in my life. I still struggle here and there I have weeks where I feel like shit. But having a crappy day sober is way better than having any day high or drunk for me. I'm 23 and only have my family by my side and a job. I realize I have a problem and its two choices live clean and sober and try to enjoy life. Or use or drink and watch me destroy myself and take my family down while I do it. Oh and I did blow too.

I'll be doing social media and content creation for a few brands and an ad agency.  I was very fortunate in college to have a lot of great internships. I worked for Dell, Bud Light, and a department on campus doing social media and event planning. I also wrote for a few blogs/local magazines. For me, it ended up coming down to networking. I was chosen to present at a conference at my school and I knew the sponsors of the event were in the industry I wanted to be in, so I networked like hell.

I don't know how they do it, but I am wondering, does DiGiorno have a similar product?"
AMA,3c5ply,Reddittjj,7,Sun Jul 5 01:46:48 2015 UTC,"Yes, we do have rising crust pizzas. You must realize that almost all brands of frozen pizza do not actually cook their dough in brick ovens. If the crust is flavored, it is most likely treated with chemicals to give it that ""brick oven cooked"" taste.   To my knowledge, I do not recall having a brick oven cooked crust flavor. Since our pizzas come frozen, you could probably achieve this desired effect by cooking the frozen pizza in a brick oven. Of course, I do not expect you to have a brick oven in your home. DiGiorno has other flavored crusts however, for example our garlic bread pizzas are very popular."

Personally, I think it is a bit too much as this job does not require much culinary skill at all. In the kitchen at work, there are a handful of chefs that work at ovens and conveyor belts. Each chef has a specific job to do, for example putting on the cheese, and there is a kitchen hierarchy reminiscent to that of a restaurant. The factory I work at is huge, but in my kitchen area there are about a dozen chefs I would say. Most of the people who work there are mechanics that fix the machinery.

Everything returned back to being nerves,diet,smoking and alcohol consumption (I no longer smoke). My 20's were a period of high anxiety, piss poor diet, heavy drinking and smoking. Basically an indirect form of IBS (irritable bowel syndrome).  These factors basically reeked havoc on my GI trac and led up to the ""chronic"" point of the chronic diarrhea. I was tested for  ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, cancer. All were ruled out as factors as possible causes.  I've since learned to control my anxiety, quit smoking.

I know I will get downvoted to hell for this, but I have the feeling that the story isn't as big as people actually believe. It's far more plausible that Victoria might actually just fucked up and that's why neither Reddit/Pao nor Victoria actually comment. I'm sure V will find a way better PR-Jib anyways. If there is a bigger story behind it we will probably hear it in the next days. A real problem is how the ""transition"" went down, that's actually a very valid point.

AMA,3c0ys8,blackfogg,1 point,Sun Jul 5 20:20:24 2015 UTC,"I think the bigger story is that we're stuck with Pao, lost someone actually so essential that r/Ama can't rely on the ""replacement team,"" and Victoria can't say anything about it (most likely a nondisclosure in her hiring.).   Really though this just rings too true of Pao being her shitty self, reddit trying to sell a key piece that makes it unique, and Pao bringing down a well liked and devoted member/employee, who's also a woman ( much like she's done before.)

AMA,3c0ys8,oracle9999,1 point,Sun Jul 5 20:25:48 2015 UTC,"A nondisclosure agreement usually doesn't include things like reasons for getting fired, but is aimed at ceeping future buisness-plans, prototype's etc secret. We don't know the replacement yet. Why not wait until they are actually public to say they do a rubbish job? Victoria was not going to be CEO, she understands nothing of financial business. She was very good at her job, but she is no threat for Pao's position unless she knew something about Pao that would destroy her career. But that's a conspiracy until we learn otherwise.. IF Victoria actually fucked up Pao won't say anything so she doesn't destroy the future job-chances of Victoria because of some linch mob. Let me just remind you of the last reddit-admin that was fired and did an AMA. He lied, the reddit CEO made public that he was indeed a lazy fuck. Perhaps Victoria just didn't like the way Pao was going and the company just decided they want to try something new that Victoria wasn't capable/willing to do. There are thousands of much more plausible answers then calling Pao a woman-hater.  Yeah, as I already said, the transition was shitty, the should have informed Mods and they are not really in touch with the community the way they could be (Especially far a side that's about information and and communication)."
AMA,3c0ys8,blackfogg,1 point,Sun Jul 5 20:58:33 2015 UTC,"My reference to the replacement team being poor came from the mods themselves sayin their amas would be run by mods now as te team they saw wasn't near as adequate nor headed in the open style that they built for the reddit community.    Pao doesn't have o be a woman hater in this instance, but her history does speak for itself at other companies in this regard.    I never said Victoria was going to be Ceo or knew about financial matters, not having that knowledge but being well liked compared to someone considered hated could be enough to send someone with a history like Paos to feel threatened.  Past CEOs being good or bad is irrelevant at this point since we have one now and she's bad.  The news articles discussing the topic (In other threads,) and/or other mods have pointed out this largely stems from Victoria not being for paid AMAs so in this sense the whole thing boils down to money, and leads to poor AMA quality/trust."
AMA,3c0ys8,oracle9999,1 point,Sun Jul 5 21:09:37 2015 UTC,"That's the transition-solution, I already said the transition is a problem. But Reddit already announced that they will find a adequate replacement.  Her history only shows that she fired women for her interests, not because of personal preferences. So no, since popularity is not important for being in her position Victoria was no threat. Also many of the example's are quite shady, look up the sources.  You might state the sources for Victoria not being paid for AMAs. As much as I know she never complained about not being paid for her job. A workers salery is no problem for reddit's finances, the servers are the expensive thing."

AMA,3c0een,GetFreeFlights,14,Fri Jul 3 17:03:04 2015 UTC,What are the risks or potential consequences involved with travel hacking? Do airlines/credit card companies admire you or despise you?
AMA,3c0een,DevinRobbins,12,Fri Jul 3 17:25:11 2015 UTC,"The biggest risk is that you will start to change your spending patterns in order to earn more points/miles. Many people try to justify their spending by thinking ""its ok, I'll earn points/miles for this purchase"".   In reality, that type of thinking is incredibly dangerous. As long as you trust yourself with large amount of credit and are organized enough to keep track of everything (payment dates, money moving around, etc) there really are few downsides"
AMA,3c0een,dr_van_nostren,6,Fri Jul 3 17:29:57 2015 UTC,"Obviously everyone will be skeptical.  I'll give it a read because I know about the bonuses and such, it is fairly easy to rack up miles and whatnot, but they usually come from some kind of spending or just churning and churning and churning cards which probably isn't sustainable.    How applicable is your info to Canadians?  I don't wanna waste an hour reading a bunch of stuff only to find all the cards you apply for are strictly USA based."
AMA,3c0een,CHB9801,5,Sat Jul 4 01:21:18 2015 UTC,Is there a loadable card that offers the bill pay like you recently did with the Target card?
AMA,3c0een,CHB9801,3,Fri Jul 3 17:48:57 2015 UTC,"The target card is still usable with a quick workaround. You just have to buy Visa Gift Cards with a credit card, then use those to load the target card. Takes a little more time but you still get the same benefit."
AMA,3c0een,razorirr,2,Fri Jul 3 17:53:20 2015 UTC,I thought the bill pay feature was gone?? How does it work if you can't use the Target card to pay the credit card back?
AMA,3c0een,razorirr,2,Fri Jul 3 18:00:05 2015 UTC,Bill pay isn't gone. The ability to load it directly with a credit card is. That was the only change they made.
AMA,3c0een,razorirr,2,Fri Jul 3 18:00:47 2015 UTC,"This would require you finding somewhere that you can get the gift card at face value though would it not? For example I can walk into Walmart and get the 200 dollar card for 206.86 + tax. This fee isnt something that Walmart adds, but rather VISA themselves. This is a leak of 3.44% before sales tax, which is another 6 percent for me.  Looking at AA, the most expensive round trip I found economy is 75k miles. at 1 point per dollar, that gives you a leak of 2580 dollars. Plus 4500 in sales tax.  This would still work with signing bonuses such as what the citi AAadavantage executive world elite card has, where if you cycle 7500 plus pay the 450 fee (or talk them down to 2000 limit) you get 75k points for 258 dollars plus 7500*sales tax."
AMA,3c0een,razorirr,5,Fri Jul 3 19:29:43 2015 UTC,"Great question. Yes, there are certainly fees to buy the visa gift cards. The math still works out when you factor in the signup bonuses (usually ~50,000 miles for $3,000 min spend). We do have a workaround for avoiding the fees too. You buy Amex gift cards via a cash back portal (earning about 1.5% back on your purchase), then use those to buy Visa gift cards and finish the cycle. The 1.5% back from the cash back portal completely makes up for the visa gift card purchase fee."
AMA,3c0een,skiierguy3203,1 point,Fri Jul 3 19:37:20 2015 UTC,"My math must be off then, cause I could move to Oregon or Florida to avoid the sales tax but that the gift card fee is 3.44 percent, the 1.5%  you might get back from the portal (I'm looking into those now) still does not negate the 3.44%. though it does offset that some."
AMA,3c0een,PurePerfection_,2,Fri Jul 3 20:02:42 2015 UTC,"Maybe it's different in other states, but when I buy visa gift cards I pay a little under the 1% in fees. In some cases I actually get a small cash profit in addition to all the points/miles. Your attention to detail tells me that this hobby might be a good fit for you!"
AMA,3c0een,PurePerfection_,2,Fri Jul 3 20:05:31 2015 UTC,"Earlier this year i took out a AAdvantage citi card so i could spend 3000 buying airline miles from AA who had a buy 100k miles get 60 free thing going for two weeks,which triggered to 3k min spend to get 40k miles knowing full well that since i was buying miles from them I'd get double points. so buying 100k points got me 211k miles.   I do see the 1 percent cash back thing on ebates for the amex. if thats the current rate. Id see it as    use CC to buy amex cards, get 1 percent back from ebates (-1%) use those cards to buy visa card which the best one I can find sells for 206.88 for 200 dollars (visa labels these drain into redcard (feeless) redcard pays CC (feeless)   You probably know better, but can you just use the amex gift card to charge the redcard? I assume no, but if you could you can go to amex and buy a card directly though them for a 3.95 activation fee on a 3000 card, this works out to .13% markup.  The fun bit is this really, really looks like money laundering, and if you got audited and the state found out you weren't declaring probably 10s of thousands of dollars of purchases on your 1040, that's also then tax evasion."
AMA,3c0een,Enragedpixel,1 point,Fri Jul 3 20:35:49 2015 UTC,"Great questions. You know your stuff.   You're right, you can't use Amex gift cards to load to target. The reason is because they aren't PIN enabled, and therefore don't mimic a debit card.   Yes, this is very similar to money laundering. The only real difference is that I am not taking illegal money and attempting to hide it. It's legal > legal money throughout the process. The money also never hits any bank account so the odds of getting audited are very low. And of course if you were ever to be audited everything is 100% legal."
AMA,3c0een,Enragedpixel,1 point,Fri Jul 3 20:52:49 2015 UTC,"everything is 100% legal yes in the laundering sense. The part that would get you, or rather me since I'm the one in a state with sales tax, is the tax evasion part. buying a giftcard counts as a sale. The original method you had of cc to redcard to cc nothing was ever sold."
AMA,3c0een,Enragedpixel,1 point,Fri Jul 3 21:02:39 2015 UTC,"Wouldn't the tax only be on the fee? Because the rest of the balance is ""loaded"" to the card, that wouldn't really be a ""sale"". I'm guessing the tax. charged when you buy it. I also live in a sales tax state."

AMA,3c0een,PeacePhire,2,Fri Jul 3 20:57:03 2015 UTC,How do you avoid all of the credit card fees? Seems too good to be true
AMA,3c0een,LivingUnderSomeRock,2,Fri Jul 3 17:24:14 2015 UTC,"Great question. Most credit cards waive their annual fees for the first year. I simply close the cards ~11 months after opening them to avoid paying any money out of pocket. Believe it or not, this usually has little to no effect on your credit score."
AMA,3c0een,DevinRobbins,1 point,Fri Jul 3 17:26:31 2015 UTC,"Won't you run out of credit card promotions to exploit within a couple of years?  There are only a handful of airlines in the U.S. that fly to destinations outside North America, and I assume that once you've opened a card, taken advantage of the signup bonus, and closed the account, you can't repeat this strategy with the same airline. Perhaps I'm wrong about that, but I know with most retail store credit cards, the signup bonus is only available once. I've never seen comparable credit card offers from foreign carriers, so maybe that's an alternative I'm just not aware of.  There would be a similar constraint with hotels, eventually. Once you exhaust the major global brands that have properties in virtually every major city - Hilton, Marriott, Starwood, Radisson, etc. - your free/extremely cheap destination options will be very limited.  Personally, I've already gotten the signup bonuses for Delta and United, as well as for Hilton and Marriott.  Once I've done this with American, it'll be virtually impossible to fly internationally out of my city using your method.  Do you have ideas for what to do once you've used up all the credit card options?"
AMA,3c0een,alikoven,1 point,Sat Jul 4 17:58:20 2015 UTC,"Great question. Most credit card bonuses can be earned multiple times if you wait 12-18 months between applications. Pair that with the fact that you can earn the same points from multiple cards (for example, you could get the southwest card and the sapphire preferred, which has miles that transfer to southwest) and this is truly a never ending opportunity. I've had almost every major credit card 2 to 3 times in the last 4 years."
AMA,3c0een,DevinRobbins,2,Sat Jul 4 21:12:03 2015 UTC,"That's really surprising that you can take a large signup bonus more than once.  I still have my Delta card open because I use its other benefits like priority boarding and free checked baggage, but I closed the others years ago.  Thanks!"

I know for a fact if you use VISA to withdraw money at an ATM, you get charged the interest right there and then.  Won't similar ideology apply here?

But then after that I always thought ""sheesh there aren't too many people that seem to be very similar to me here"" but see the only reason I even say that is because I'm so aware of my personality at this point in my life. I didn't know if I was awkward or weird or whatever until I realised I'm just a really friendly guy that has a hard time getting the first hello out ahah. I REALLY enjoy encounters with new strangers. I have no idea what they did till now and I need some light shed on things that happen in life that only other people's circumstances can make happen.  Which is cool with me! Why shouldn't I accept that anyway hah. I reallllly enjoy cooking. But more then that I like what people tell me about it. ""Man this kinda sucks. Needs salt maybe? How about spice."" Peoples opinions are really interesting to take in. I like to hear you out and put myself In your shoes and see what you mean when you explain yourself and then give you my view. AFTER the fact though unless you specifically ask for my opinion on it I'm  neutral about all matters. I know what I think so I don't care to tell you unless you're interested. You know? I'd give you guys my name but that's not impossible to find should you want to know. I am however a 24 year old in new Orleans but I've mentioned that in a couple of posts before lol. I feel like I have a lot to say but usually psyche myself out thinking ""well if I say what I'm thinking what if they want a second opinion from you!? That's all I had!"" But I do try anyway hahah. I like to laugh a lot and speak in a bunch of manners I guess would be how to explain my speech pattern? It's like I don't want to say the same thing twice in the same tone. Kinda odd. But I like that. Ohhhhh man I loooove singing in my car on the way to work and stuff. It's so freakin fun because I try to imitate the way the singer ""sings"" but now imitate the voice. And then because I can't actually hit high or low notes I'm usually screaming or grumbling those parts of the song ahahah. I tell jokes to myself and talk to myself a bunch because hey, I know the humor I like right? Anywho I'll cut it here since I don't know how to properly format this so it'll be a huge block. Should anyone out there want to fix this please by all means! Welp, that's sorta some of who I am!"

I use that so I can tell you how much I hate traffic. God damn traffic and being the driver. It used to be so awesome because I didn't care if someone wouldn't let me switch lanes or if someone drove allow in the left lane but I just didn't know. I didn't know they were purposely being assholes. Like I had no idea just how often I would people would speed up when I signal to switch lanes only to match my speed and keep me from changing the damn lanes. This is likely happening everywhere but why? If I need to change lanes to get off an exit why can't you just let me over you bastard! Or if you stay in the left lane at 60 in a 60 zone as legal as that sounds I still hate when people do it. Half the people do 60 in a 60 on the right lane and half in the left lane and obviously it's not my road or anything but let me keep my pace while you keep yours in the slower Lane. Man. Fuck driving most of the time. AND THEN ITS LIKE PEOPLE HAVE ACTUALLY FORGOTTEN THAT SIGNALS ARE SUPPOSED TO BE USED BEFORE CHANGING LANES OR MAKING A TURN, NOT RIIIIGHT BEFORE OR AS YOU'RE IN THE MOTION. I don't tailgate but it's always the whole dude/lady in front of me driving and then without warning stop to 2 miles an hour in a 45 to make a right turn without a signal until their already pretty much done with making the turn.

AMA,3c5553,oliversjgilmour,2,Sun Jul 5 10:02:56 2015 UTC,"I started at oil fried sunny side up eggs. Then someone was like hey try butter to make eggs! The game changed but I missed the crispy edges oil gives eggs. After awhile I quit oil all together and stayed butter/margarine but now that I think about it I miss those crispy edges a lot. Butter just doesn't have the same crisp even though it can sorry of give the egg sort of the same crust. A lot of time I also just like scrambled eggs with some soy sauce mixed in cooked with butter. Adding the soy sauce on top of the egg just doesn't have the same flavor. That ""Gordon ramsey"" styled scrambled egg is my favorite way to make the soy sauce and eggs. So in the end my favorite style egg is just up to what I'm feeling the meal needs."

AMA,3c0s7k,bacon_over_hoes,3,Fri Jul 3 18:53:42 2015 UTC,The convent I was in turned out to be more of a cult than a convent. There was a certain amount of mental and physical abuse that went on.
AMA,3c0s7k,dorogov,2,Fri Jul 3 19:20:49 2015 UTC,"Woah. that sucks.   I went to catholic school all my life. I found it odd that a person would give up their life to serve others and just follow orders to serve god, when in reality there was just an elder giving out orders and the rest following blindly.  A few girls got knocked up in my high school, one of them from a priest.   Growing up and seeing religious people act like a herd made me steer away from any religious activity. Some of my friends say I'm an atheist, others an agnostic. I know there is a greater power but I cannot give up my will for another man to tell me I should or shouldn't do something when we are all free and face temptation on a daily basis.   How did all that affect your faith? What were the first signs of being part of a cult? and lastly, what was the last straw for you?"
AMA,3c0s7k,dorogov,6,Fri Jul 3 19:40:29 2015 UTC,"I was in an Orthodox convent. While I am still an Orthodox Christian, I can say that my faith is altered. I believe that every Christian synod/denomination is somehow flawed just as humans are flawed. Nothing will ever be perfect on this earth. I have constant struggles with my faith and my conscience. If I have to choose between the two, I will choose my conscience.   I started to realize that I was in a cult when I was asked to do things that went against conscience such as lying. Also, realizing that there was a hierarchy of ""important"" people who got special privileges whether it was deserved or not.   The last straw for me was an issue with a nun who had psychological problems. She made life miserable for all those around her. Things escalated to the point that I ended up having murderous thoughts about her. After years of attempting to work within the system to make things better, I attempted shouting profanity at the abbess. Still nothing was done."

AMA,3c0s7k,SwarleySwarlos,2,Sat Jul 4 21:07:35 2015 UTC,"1.How has being a nun influenced you religiously? Are you more religious now, or less? 2. could an argument be made that the strict ascetic ways of being a nun can actually weaken one's relationship with god? 3. You spent a lot of your sexual prime years as a nun. Did thoughts of men/marriage/children ever reach you? 4. What was your daily life like? 5. was there a lot of female drama/convent politics?"
AMA,3c0s7k,runawaywolf,2,Fri Jul 3 19:45:19 2015 UTC,"Being a nun has made me less religious. Not that I am revolting against it or anything. It's more that I've had enough of it to last me a long time. Also, having a bad experience makes me less likely to comply with religious ideals. I still maintain a Christian mindset and strive to do what is ""right"". I also still strive for self-betterment.   I think the ascetic way of life can have a different effect on each individual. You can't lump everyone together. There are different types of monasticism. Some are more ascetical than others. I don't believe asceticism weakened my relationship with God. I did not work that hard on prayer and such to be perfectly honest. I wasn't into it which is why I should not have been a nun for so long. I was not dedicated in that way. However, I was not allowed to leave. So, that did affect my relationship as I had some feelings of animosity which grew over time... not necessarily directed at God.   I often thought of men/marriage/children especially as I progressed in age. Time for children is limited. By the time I reached 32, I figured I had lost the opportunity for such things. I wouldn't say that I was depressed, but I did not have much hope in those areas.   Daily life was pretty much based on a schedule which could be changed if need be. Each person had certain responsibilities. This is the generic daily schedule. 5:25 Wake up 6:10 Church 8:00 Breakfast 8:30 Start work (dishes, laundry, sewing, painting, cleaning, etc.) 12:00 Lunch 12:30 More work 2:30 Coffee 3:00 Church 4:00 Work 6:00 Dinner 7:00 Church 8:00 Work Sometime after this we were to do our individual prayers 1:00 a.m. bed  Other church services were performed by several people throughout the day. The church was hardly ever empty.   There wasn't as much female drama as you would imagine. Everyone is always surprised by this. We were all there for a common goal. Yes we got into tiffs, but would work them out. There was the one nun that caused problems, but even she could be worked with on occasion. Politically... yes there was an ""in-crowd"". They got special treatment which did not go over well with the others. The people getting the special treatment did the least amount of work which was a big issue with the rest of us."
AMA,3c0s7k,Neokrw,1 point,Fri Jul 3 20:22:54 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much for your replies. It offers valuable insight into a world that I will probably never see. I have some follow up questions. What do you mean by you weren't allowed to leave? Who stopped you? When did you decide that you didn't want to be a nun anymore, and how long did it take you to finally leave? How did you leave in the end after 25 years?  It's still not too late to find love, and have children. I wish you the best in that regard. Convent life seems good in that it is simple, and you don't have to think about much except the present. It is a lot of work though still!"
AMA,3c0s7k,just_a_big_guy,3,Fri Jul 3 20:59:47 2015 UTC,"I was there 15 years, not 25.   I gave away all my money when I entered the convent. All phone/internet access was monitored. My mail was opened before I received it.  Permission was needed for everything. My life was not my own. To leave, I would need money to get a ticket to return home. This was not willingly given.  I started saying I did not want to be a nun in earnest when I was 20 (3 years after joining). I was talked out of it each time by the abbess. I was also told such things like I would go to Hell if I left.   I finally got the courage to take things into my own hands after 15 years. I was given an iPad at one point and I had the password for Wifi. I used this to make myself an email address. I emailed my mother. She did not believe it was me and though it was entrapment. The bishops and abbess did not make life pleasant for my parents either and basically bragged about holding me ""hostage"". I asked permission to take one of the dogs for a walk in the forest and took the cell phone with me. I called my mother telling her to contact me via the email address. I deleted the call from the phone history. I had to wait a week for her to come and get me. I left at about 2:00 in the morning when everyone was asleep so they couldn't stop me.  Yes, convent life in some ways made it so I didn't have to worry about such things as money, etc. In that way it was a simple life without much day to day variation. I'm sure that everything will work out just fine in my life.   Thank you for your kind words."

AMA,3bw78o,ProDigit,38,Thu Jul 2 17:49:21 2015 UTC,"The Elio weighs approximately the same as a VW Bug. The Bug suffered from the problem that the center mass was over the rear wheels, and the center pressure was at the windshield, and the distance between these two forces produced a couple that made it squirrly in high winds.  The Elio is front engine so the center pressure and center mass are nearly coincident which will greatly reduce this effect.   But if you want an Elio fun-house ride...wait for the Turbo!"

Having said that, I'm sure that could all be accomplished through the OBD II port and a visit to Pep Boys! #8753"

AMA,3bw78o,Canard427,10,Thu Jul 2 23:41:55 2015 UTC,Probably would handle crosswinds well because it has a small wind profile and is very aerodynamic.

I'm not trying to be derogatory, I would buy one tomorrow if it was available, but the repeated Facebook updates on helmet laws (doesn't matter if there's no product) and release delays have me thinking more and more that this is a money pit with no hope of production.   (I saw the prototype in Richmond by the way and it was great)"
AMA,3bw78o,cleithis,26,Thu Jul 2 18:06:32 2015 UTC,"Fair question.  The primarily cause of delay in the Elio Motors project is surrounding funding. Particularly this round. Because projects like Elio don't come along very often, there are not established pools of money that invest in these projects. In hindsight, I probably could have probably chosen better paths over the last year. But now with being able to take advantage of the JOBS Act (506(c) and Reg A+), we are now on our way."

AMA,3bw78o,superdeej,11,Thu Jul 2 19:04:50 2015 UTC,"Any thoughts on the road noise inside the prototypes, and the expectations for the production model?  Videos with sound available?"
AMA,3bw78o,BICEP2,14,Thu Jul 2 17:41:10 2015 UTC,"The main driver of in vehicle noise is the stiffness of the vehicle. Having a full space frame we are stiffer than most cars. Additionally, composite panels transmit noise less readily than steel body panels would. Having outboard wheels with fairings also gives us an extra barrier for road noise. All combined we expect the Elio to be very quiet in cabin."
AMA,3bw78o,rasselok123,2,Thu Jul 2 18:04:19 2015 UTC,"The thinner (radial) tires you're planning on putting on the vehicle (at least on the front two wheels), should also damp road noise a bit better than regular (and especially low profile) tires.  I hope the inside of the car can have sound dampening carpet, and the engine will be mounted off the car frame (using dampers, or just mounted on the transmission, mounted on the front wheels). That could reduce engine noise as well."

AMA,3bw78o,cablecore,10,Thu Jul 2 17:48:44 2015 UTC,When we announced this production date we said it was predicated on funding. Now the funding picture is getting clearer and we will be able to give a high-fidelity estimate soon.

AMA,3bw78o,Cubes941,4,Thu Jul 2 18:32:08 2015 UTC,"i'm guessing that's $500 over their cost target, which would probably translate to ~$1000 over list price target."

Precision Turbo attended last supplier summit and they are interested in offering a production turbo for the Elio. I don't have any insight into timing from them as of yet.

AMA,3bw78o,userexec,14,Thu Jul 2 17:48:23 2015 UTC,I don't know but I will find out.   The Elio will have a hole in its rear frame to accomdoate a pole with two small tires attached. So the Elio can go on traditional car lifts and car carriers. But I have not yet looked into the towing aspect.

If everything goes as planned and we have Elios on the market in near future...what do you see on the other side of the bridge for Elio (and the auto industry in general) in 10 years? 20 years?"
AMA,3bw78o,garydunn2000,22,Thu Jul 2 17:41:45 2015 UTC,"I think you mean an ""AND"" vehicle. And what we mean by that is that Americans buy large vehicles for a reason. They need to get plywood from Home Depot or take the family to church on Sunday. Because of our value proposition (price point and mileage) you are better off owning an Elio AND your larger vehicle vs. just your larger vehicle.  I think we are creating a new category. Best analogy is the Sony Walkman. That is personal music. They didn't stop buying home stereos or car stereos and that carries through today in the MP3 player. I believe the Elio will make a fundamental shift in transportation. Like the Walkman is personal music, we are personal transportation."
AMA,3bw78o,helmutkr,7,Thu Jul 2 18:07:56 2015 UTC,"I absolutely love this response for some reason.  Possibly because that's precisely how I look at it.

We have gotten poorer as a nation because we buy more than what we sell. This has to stop. We have to make things in this country. We have to make and export things from this country. Elio can be produced in America and sold around the globe. That is our long term goal. That's why I want to make things here."

The elio is supposed to be simple and cheap. And shouldn't require a lot of professional tools to fix.   I'm under the presumption that most of general maintenance can be done by the owner himself, without needing too much mechanical background info  (like changing brakepads, oil and fluids, and filters.

The main reason for P5 is that anytime you kick off a prototype you find errors in the CAD model. If we kicked off 25 prototypes all at once, everytime we found an error we would have to redo all 25. So, we are kicking off P5 to validate the solid model and we will be kicking off P6-30 late July."
AMA,3bw78o,binrobinro,6,Thu Jul 2 17:45:53 2015 UTC,So P5 will be done before late July? Will you be showing that one around the country like you are the P4?
AMA,3bw78o,Caseymiata,9,Thu Jul 2 17:47:32 2015 UTC,20 weeks is 5 months. Late July is 3 weeks away. But we are going to kick off P6-30 before P5 is done because there is a lot that has to happen before the parts come in and so we want to shortcut the timeline.

First, would you consider coming out with a model that sacrifices some miles per gallon in the name of comfort and practicality? Secondly, in Chris's video, he said the engine in the car he was driving was temporary. Have you decided on a engine to power the Elio? Finally, as a fun exercise, would you consider making a sports ""car""? Four wheels, keep it light and nimble? Thanks for answering in advance, I have huge respect for what you do, and I would think with your prices you will sell those by the truckload!"
AMA,3bw78o,BICEP2,2,Thu Jul 2 18:20:59 2015 UTC,"First, would you consider coming out with a model that sacrifices some miles per gallon in the name of comfort and practicality?   They could have come out with a version that sacrafices mileage using the GM motor in the prototype and been able to launch the thing by now but instead opted to stall the entire project and make it dependent on a $185 million dollar government loan to go through to design a custom engine so that they could get as close to their claimed mileage figure as possible. I think they should have compromised the mileage and just launched the thing and worked on the custom engine for v2 later on but it was important enough to them not to.   Secondly, in Chris's video, he said the engine in the car he was driving was temporary. Have you decided on a engine to power the Elio?    Yep, they worked with IAV to design a custom engine. They have built a prototype and benchmarked it (I think he said elsewhere here it performed as expected, slightly below their goal). They are now building a 5th prototype (P5) that will include their own engine and transmission. There will be 25 more prototypes produced later (for a total of 30).   Finally, as a fun exercise, would you consider making a sports ""car""? Four wheels, keep it light and nimble?   Someone in /r/eliomotors mentioned a potential turbo charged version. I think they hinted they could potentially look at alternative power trains in the future but I doubt they would consider a 4 wheeled version in the foreseeable future because 3 wheelers are technically considered motorcycles in many states (autocycles) and under much less regulation than 4 wheeled automobiles. Some of that is safety but the regulation to produce a 4 wheeled car is fairly significant and it would drastically change the aerodynamics and design of the car.   Trikes with the 2 wheels in the front are fairly stable. Trikes with 2 wheels in the back are mostly terrible for stability. The top gear episode on the reliant robin demonstrates this well.    I would think with your prices you will sell those by the truckload!   I think they are projecting over 250,000/year and if they can deliver on all their claims I have little doubt they would sell by the truckload but actually hitting all their goals I still think would be far from easy."

NOT very ""American"", to take away customer's 'Free Speech', especially when they have NOT violated any 'Facebook Rules'!"
AMA,3bw78o,Javin007,10,Thu Jul 2 17:52:49 2015 UTC,"The Elio FB page is a community and there has to be a standard of behaviors in every community. No process is perfect. We may have banned people unjustly. Since this has become a hot topic, we will ""un-ban"" everyone next week but we will ""reblock"" folks who attack others, use foul language, etc. We need to keep the community safe for the majority.  You can say whatever you want about Elio. Name a single other car company that has let the public in on the design process. We are very transparent.   Transparency is and will remain one of our core values. We love participating in forums like this one, we love answering questions from the fans we meet on tour and we've had several online and face-to-face ""town hall meetings"" to address fans and critics alike.  With Facebook, there was a small vocal group who was temporarily blocked, but their access will be restored. We hope we can continue to engage in productive conversations with them moving forward."

However, what a person says may have consequences such as being banned or blocked etc… on public forums.  Having access to Facebook isn’t a right, it’s privileged access.  Abuse the privilege and it may result in that privilege being taken away.    Understanding the difference between freedom of speech and privileges is a key concept far above many citizens comprehension."

AMA,3bw78o,Redvapes,5,Thu Jul 2 18:51:35 2015 UTC,"I'm obviously not Paul, but here's a couple thoughts...   This is pretty broad.  Do you have a more specific question?  What problems do you see being replicated? He answered this in a YouTube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLVMoP-zFJI  tl;dw It keeps the cost of the car down and allows you to upgrade without needing to buy a whole new car. Change in the law.  It was illegal for a private company to do this up until the day they launched their crowdfunding campaign.  Elio is among the first to ever do this. Assuming that this is a more refined platform that fits the requirements of the law.  I'm not an attorney, but that sounds a scam to just ""ask for money"" from their base of supporters.  This isn't a charity.  Elio Motors can't solicit or accept money without offering a contract with a tangible agreement with each individual.   The whole strategy seems to be to go slow and do things right the first time.  It's a new engine, and they're still making adjustments to get Elio up to the expected 84 mpg and $6,800 price tag.  Right now they are getting about 81 mpg and are a few hundred dollars over budget right now. This seems like an unnecessarily negative question.  Elio Motors  has been pretty upfront about the amount of money they've raised already, and the obvious necessity to raise more.  Between private investors, Reg A+ campaign, and the loan they're applying for from the Department of Energy, I'm not sure what else they're supposed to be including.  Any entrepreneurial enterprise is going to hit bumps along the way and still need to keep up customer morale.  They've asked for patience, and it's completely up to you if you want to give it to them or not.  Stop with the ""gotcha Paul!"" attitude.  Get off the train if you don't think it's taking you where you want to go. I don't have a source, but I thought they're only accepting reservations that can be filled during the first year of production. Paul said that reservation holders get their cars first.  It'll be a national launch."
AMA,3bw78o,cablecore,3,Thu Jul 2 20:27:46 2015 UTC,How real is the 84 mpg and what road and terrain conditions will achieve it consistently?
AMA,3bw78o,mrbigg3,2,Fri Jul 3 14:58:04 2015 UTC,"Supposedly it currently gets 81MPG at 60MPH, and probably around 100MPG with airco, heater and lights off going 45MPH in final gear."
AMA,3bw78o,triksterx,2,Thu Jul 2 18:10:17 2015 UTC,"Supposedly it currently gets 81MPG at 60MPH   There is a big difference between fixed speed MPG and MPG for EPA highway estimates. Fixed speed will always be higher because it ignore stopping/going, accelerating, speed fluctuations etc. that burn fuel.  Highway speeds are also > 60 MPH thus more wind resistance. If that figure is accurate I wonder what an EPA estimated highway mileage would look like. Maybe 60-65 MPG?"

AMA,3c032p,EzraWinter,3,Fri Jul 3 15:33:48 2015 UTC,"I worked in the automotive industry for a while, and there is one glaring inconstancy when it comes to ex salesmen speaking up.  They will make claims all day long about how they are ripping people off, overselling vehicles etc.  What they never do is actually break down just how much more you are wasting money on a car when you purchase it new from a dealer.  People want to know percentages and numbers, otherwise its hard for them to understand just how fucked the car sales world is."
AMA,3c032p,Zniped,2,Fri Jul 3 16:55:41 2015 UTC,What have you done that you regret the most to make a sale?
AMA,3c032p,Reddittjj,4,Fri Jul 3 16:31:17 2015 UTC,"The sale that made me quit.  We were near an army base and loved selling cars to military personnel, because they didn't understand finance too well (having lived an army bases most of their adult lives) and were easy to ripoff  I sold a fully-loaded sedan to a soldier for way more then he should have paid. Really nice guy but my manager locked him in to the price before I could really think.  Guy comes back 6 months later and says he needs an SUV because he was injured overseas and can't get into a sedan with his bad leg. We end up selling him a base model SUV that was CHEAPER than his sedan. But we told him ""Great news, we can swap you in to this SUV and your monthly payment will only go up $100 a month.""  TL:DR Ripped off an injured soldier, twice."

AMA,3c032p,bacon_over_hoes,1 point,Sat Jul 4 01:24:10 2015 UTC,"The amount that this one shocked me. Open use of the ""n word"" and many other racial slurs. Black families were thought to have bad credit, and therefore easy to ripoff.  No one wanted East Indian customers because they were known to be intense hagglers. It wasn't that people couldn't make money off them, it would just take forever.  Easiest to ripoff was people who don't understand finance or negotiating very well. This included the soldiers from the nearby army base. Makes sense that they would have much experience with civilian economics."
AMA,3c032p,mordorandpestle,2,Sat Jul 4 14:32:10 2015 UTC,"I'd love to not get ripped off by car salesman but even more than that I'd like to not have to spend an entire day at dealership negotiating with them. Is there any way to get them to stop going back to ""talk to the manager"" and just get the negotiation done already? Any way other than giving in and not getting as good a deal as you could have if you let them hold you hostage all day?"
AMA,3c032p,mordorandpestle,1 point,Fri Jul 3 16:45:56 2015 UTC,If that's the case just request to talk to the manager directly. Either the salesman will get the manager or he will stop beating around the bush.

Every company has its own culture; the center of ""power"" as far as decision-making is concerned can live in lots of different places.  As an external agency, we always have to walk a tightrope between honest feedback and addressing the scope of work. Some clients are more open to that sort of feedback than others. Some clients have the necessary political power to make or influence design changes; other companies have barriers between design, development, research, and marketing that makes that sort of feedback challenging. But if there is an opportunity to offer ""cultural feedback,"" we do.  I've been gaming for a very long time, dating back to a Sears Pong machine. I've played around 10,000 different games over the course of my life. So more often than not, I have to protect the client from my personal opinions and let the data tell the story."

Retention = engagement. What ""engagement"" means is very game-specific, though; for something like an MMO, it's more about socialization and communication/community; for a F2P mobile title it's often about ""the loop."" If you create an experience that draws people into a state of flow, that's a big win.  It's usually not our job to critique the game design, however. Our role is to evaluate the effectiveness of what has already been designed and, based on observation, offer guidance."

The larger studios probably have a user research team, that focuses on things like playtesting and UX and whatnot, but those teams are usually quite small. There are a handful of independent consultants in the space that generally started as employees within the industry, and built a reputation there. And there are some boutique agencies (like ours) that focus on games or media in one way or another.  But worldwide, you're probably talking about 1000 people or less."

AMA,3byb4a,PM_ME_A_HORSE,2,Fri Jul 3 04:07:35 2015 UTC,"My bedroom, mainly. There was one night I was asked by a prostitute if she could ""use my bedroom for business."" Being the shy 11 year old I was, I said okay, and stayed up all night on the kitchen computer.   On another incident, during a raid, several druggies asked to ""hide out"" in my bedroom. That was short lived, as my dog went hogwild when the cops kicked in my door, and I was afraid for the dog's safety more than a bunch of tweakers.   During a different raid, police banged on my bedroom door, saying they would kick it in if I didn't come out. I was sleeping in a night shirt with no pants, and (at age 12) was mortified when the police officer ordered me to put pants on in my little sister's bedroom doorway.   I was not involved in any dealings."

AMA,3byb4a,Metamorphis,2,Fri Jul 3 05:41:08 2015 UTC,"My parents? Still going strong together for 25 years. (For reference, all of this happened ~11-12 years ago.)   Due to a domestic abuse issue, my brother, sister and I were put into foster care. My parents were struggling to get sober and clean up their act at this time, and we had just moved to be ""under the radar"" from all those who would try to stick around for the drugs. After my siblings and I were taken, my parents were evicted from their current residence. They were homeless for a while, but eventually found a travel trailer and rented space on a private residence, where they were just stable enough to get us kids back. I wasn't too happy for it. I was ~15-16 at this point, so I bounced around at my friend's places, avoiding living with them. Eventually I graduated high school early because screw the drama, and went into college, and bought them a slightly more permanent trailer in the next county over with some loan money. We've been here for ~5 years now. They've been sober for about 7 years now, my dad is essentially bedridden with unrelated medical issues while my mom takes care of the household in general.   TL;DR -- They live in a trailer I helped them get, and have been sober for ~7 years, with no legal or drug issues to speak of."
AMA,3byb4a,runawaywolf,2,Fri Jul 3 05:48:30 2015 UTC,"Good to hear it's going better, sucks with the medical issues though. Nice thing to do getting them a better trailer, good shit man."

I didn't have very many friends aside from those on the street, and being in my awkward pre-teen years, I took to my computer primarily. I did whatever I wanted on the computer, though. At some point in it all, my dad told me that they were done trying to homeschool us, because we never did our homework or anything like that (which were lies, because we always did whatever homework they assigned us).   There was once I went for a very long walk starting at ~5pm that ended about 1am that same night, I was never questioned about ""suddenly disappearing"" or anything like that. Again, I never had very many friends, so hanging out with friends, staying out all night and partying and such, were never really very big options for me."

AMA,3by5km,taintosaurus_rex,1 point,Fri Jul 3 03:09:13 2015 UTC,"To be honest just about any time with my mom was a happy moment and many agree but one that comes right to mind was a vacation to Colorado.  By this time she knew her time was coming to an end but that didn't stop her from traveling. She always wanted to show me the world and tought me to appreciate the small things in life long before her sickness. She packed my gf, me, my aunt and her kids, my two nieces(that she adopted), and herself into the car and drove all the way from Indiana. When we got there, she had the whole trip planed with a ride on an old steam train, white water rafting, hiking to all the water falls, and staying in a remote cabin high in the mountains. My favorite part of the trip she surprised me with a trip through the mountains in a jeep. She planned on driving because it was narrow trails with steep clifs and she had control issues but when we got above 10,000 feet, her stomach would blow up like our bags of marshmallows did and she would lose her breath, so I got to drive. At no point was I even scared of messing up because I was so mesmerized by the veiws. We got to see all kinds of wild life including getting three feet from two full grown rams. Unfortunately when we reached the summit mom had such a hard time breathing we didn't get to stay long. We slowly made our way to small communities tucked in the mountains and through unbeaten paths. It was the greatest time in my life and its what i think of when I want to remember mom.   Another story from that trip came from a random act of kindness. We heard of a famous, small bar known for their giant prime ribs. We didn't know you had to have reservations but mom told the lady we would wait till anything opened up. We sat there for an hour and a half listening to the pianist playing songs from elton john and Billy Joel, when a random old man sat down by mom. He noticed her bandana covering her bald head and told her he just lost his wife. He traded stories with mom and then bought our entire dinner in honor of his wife. He made sure we didn't try to go cheap and then after we were finished eating insisted we got desert even though we were stuffed. I wish I could meet him again just to tell him how much that meant to me.   Sorry for the long response but I tend to ramble with my stories lol"

AMA,3by5km,taker4life,2,Fri Jul 3 04:30:55 2015 UTC,"Thank you. It was very tough. She slowly lost control of her body and slipped into unconsciousness. In the final week we tried to decide whether to end her life with this patch the doctor gave us but none of us could make the decision. On her final day i laid by her crying as she fought for every bre. My brother walked in and said ""get your ass up we're going golfing"". We made it to the third hole when we got the call.   It's amazing how much better I felt after she passed. I'm not religious but I knew that she was in a better ""place""."
AMA,3by5km,thetylerrose,2,Fri Jul 3 04:42:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah. The last few days she couldn't even talk. It looked like she was in and out of a daze or something. The only thing she said was her asking to put on makeup because she said she had to go somewhere and the angels where waiting. I'd like to think that was true. Yeah we also felt a sense of peace and bittersweet relief after she passed as well. The funeral was pretty tough though. It gets better after that. It's been 3 years and no longer do I feel a hole in my heart, but I feel at peace and appreciate the memories i had. I'd also like to think her and countless others are watching over me Keeping me in check. Ovarian cancer is a bitch. But my grandma didn't lose to cancer. She accepted it, embraced it and now is in a better place."
AMA,3by5km,Xandine,1 point,Fri Jul 3 03:53:59 2015 UTC,"It's funny what the mind thinks of in those times. My gf was watching my mom once and she said my mom just sat up once and said ""why are all these goats in here? Get them out."" my gf said the TV was off and it was completely Silent, so it must have just been a dream but mom kept arguing.   For me, the funeral wasn't that bad. The mortician did an amazing job with makeup and the worst part was over. Another thing is before Mom's funeral, my brothers and I went and bought new suits with our inheritance. Before then I never really dressed up and that was the first time. It made feel like I looked good, which I think just put me in a better mood and made it easier. I think the other thing that helped is my family. They are all very emotionally strong and it was more just saying goodbye rather than losing her.  I'm glad you could handle the loss. It's the hardest thing to go though and to make it out sane is an accomplishment in it self.   I'll never forget when my mom tried to tell me she had 3 months to live. I wouldn't allow her because I still had hope. It was weird just how happy she was too. She never was one for flowers, saying the were just dieing plants, but that day she loved them and would bury her face in them. After I left, I was driving home and a song I had never heard came on. It was dark day by 12 stones. If you get a chance give it a listen but the lyrics just hit me and I almost had to pull over because I couldn't see. It was so weird that it just happened to come on right then."
AMA,3by5km,Xandine,2,Fri Jul 3 04:01:58 2015 UTC,Lol at the goats. Yeah I guess we live and learn with life. The funeral was organized great and we were also very fortunate to have people around us being very supportive. I will definitely check that song out. Thank you

AMA,3by5km,infib,1 point,Sun Jul 5 03:17:41 2015 UTC,"My advice is spend as much time as you can and appreciate every second. With my mom, we went on alot of vacations with alot of people. Make lasting memories. You also need to be a strong shoulder for them to lean on.   I'll never forget the one time I seen my mom break down. It was almost closing time at work for me and she called me balling her eyes out and said that she was outside and needed to talk. I hurried up and finished up work and headed out there. She told me that she just learned that her intestines had quit working and she could never eat solid food again. It was a huge deal for her because she loved going to new restaurants and trying anything she had never tried. It took every muscle in my body to not cry but I knew I had to hold it together for her. I let her talk and just get it all out first, then I told her it would be fine and she could still taist food and just spit it out, then I made a few jokes to see her smile. Just like that she was back to the strong independent woman she has always been, she just needed a moment to break down.   About keeping sane, sanity during those times is just a front you put on. I was 21 when I lost my mom. When i was about 12 my mom adopted my two neices to give them a good home and I became like their father figure. I had to act like nothing bothered me because those two girls could read people like a book. even though sometimes I felt like I was in over my head ,I had to keep it together for them. Also my gf did more than anyone could have asked for for me and my family. She could see when I wanted to break down and was burying me feeling and she forced me to talk about them. That helped me more than I can explain ,which made it easier to help mom.   As for depression, don't let yourself be depressed, take control. Everyone dies, it's an indisputable fact. As my mom told me first thing after being diagnosed ""I could live another 100 year with cancer or die tomorrow in a car wreck"". She also said that knowingly your death is coming is kind of a blessing. You get a chance to live out your dreams, You don't have to worry what if anymore, and in the end you get to say goodbye the right way.   Also something I wish I would've thought of earlier is have your loved one write personalized goodbye letters to each one of thier loved ones. So when you need to talk to them you can atleast hear their words.   I'm bad about rambling and staying on point and I didn't want to make this too terribly long. If you need any more specific advice or just more advice in general, just let me know and I'll try my best to put it in words."

Do you envision the use case of these devices to be shared similar to an open wifi connection or each device setup for personal use? What is Rampart? Seriously... What are the potential vulnerabilities of the device? The first that comes to my mind is the device location being discovered and staked.   Thanks for the great work in advancing the privacy of the individual!"
AMA,3bwh6b,Bitcopia,4,Thu Jul 2 18:57:51 2015 UTC,"1 - Do you envision the use case of these devices to be shared similar to an open wifi connection or each device setup for personal use?  No, not currently.  We're currently using IPSec between the workstation and the Proxyham for authentication and encryption, preventing anyone from being able to hijack the device or even connect.  It's a thought we've considered but something we'd like to see implemented once released to the community at Defcon.  2 - What is Rampart? Seriously...  A Rampart is a defensive wall or bank around a castle, fort or settlement.  Ironic, with the PR damage it caused Woody Harrelson...  3 - What are the potential vulnerabilities of the device? The first that comes to my mind is the device location being discovered and staked.  Good question, and this is where operational security comes into play.  There will be loosely guided 'instructions' and documentation by the time release day hits, but the recommendation is to not retrieve it unless absolutely necessary.  It's objective as a tool is to provide a consistent location from which you can physically proxy traffic out to the internet - even if you're done using it, your safety should come before the $200 pricetag."

Will Rhino have any merch for sale at Defcon? Lol The range is up to 2.5 miles for ProxyHam but how open does it need to be for that to work? Is this the direction you'd like to take your company?

AMA,3bwh6b,ourari,2,Mon Jul 13 11:15:48 2015 UTC,"Hi stranger!  1 - I suggest packing light for Vegas.  :)  With the high demand and number of units, we'll be taking antennas which are more condensed than the yagi shown in the Wired article.  Altogether, shouldnt be larger than a shoebox.  If you really need to ship it, we will have orders through the site as well.  2 - Not sure yet - nothing planned, but a lot can happen in a month.  Let me know what you'd like to see.  3 - Do you mean open physically, or open in the 900mhz spectrum? I assume the former, but both are variables.  2.5 miles is pretty open area with few physical or wireless disruptions.  Think farmland, the desert, small islands, etc.  By no means a 'lab environment' but you won't get that range in Manhattan (or not yet anyway).  4 - While we love the technology and support the cause, I see us as creating Proxyham and letting the larger community to expand upon its capabilities.  I'm not looking to pivot Rhino Security Labs toward being a privacy company.  We have a lot of expertise at penetration testing and managed security and will be continuing that route.  5 - Ha, I'd be flattered, but not holding my breath.

AMA,3bwh6b,HidingKeys,2,Wed Jul 8 12:50:52 2015 UTC,"So a big question I have after about the ProxyHam, is how do you intend to make this product available to the folks living under harsher regimes? I mean I can't imagine it would be easy for people living in Turkey to get access to this and have it shipped to their front door. Will the blueprints and directions to set up be available to those that can't purchase it?  Also what frequency ranges will this work with?  Cool idea, I'd love to see it in action."
AMA,3bwh6b,knicpfost,2,Thu Jul 2 20:54:13 2015 UTC,"Yes, international access is exactly why we're making this open source and as modular as possible.

I use the example of the surge protector (similar to the ""Power Pwn"" from Pwnie Express) but we're also working on book casings, wireless routers, and a few other ideas we've been discussing.

It's not a trivial process to triangulate with a frequency scanner, but the bigger issue is ""how do you know what a Proxyham looks like?"".  The 900Mhz spectrum has cordless phones, baby monitors, walkie talkies, IOT devices, and a range of other devices which help obfuscate that signature.  Per FCC regulations, it's at the output cap of 1 watt.  You will be able to daisy-chain the units, yes - while not explicitly stated in the article, that's the whole reason behind the dual 900 antennas - daisy chaining from one proxyham to another.

AMA,3bwyzo,WheezinThaJuice,1 point,Fri Jul 3 12:15:32 2015 UTC,"Now I have time to write.  As I said in my previous comment, I'm worried because I have Myalgic Encephalomielitis (ME), or Chronic Fatigue Syndrome if it's better understood. I'm not in my best physiological and neurological conditions to receive news like this one. But this one is an important precedent in my decision: it's a catastrophic illness and I can't continue teaching at the University nor write code. I expected her to move on with her life and was OK with it, but she stood at my side and did quite a lot to help me feel better and to relieve my physical pain.  Despite that precedent, I didn't believe the news at first. While traveling, I asked many people to try to get some information from the hospital, and my mind was busy tracing conspiracy theories. When I arrived to the hospital, I had to be cold-blooded to support my girlfriend without questioning anything because I knew she was going to be in shock. And I had to be wise enough to be prepared to be a father even without the 40-week notice: ready to know how to prepare milk, how to change diapers, how to cuddle my daughter and be aware about the consequences of an uncontrolled pregnancy and the problems that my daughter or my girlfriend could have.  One thing that I'd love to remark here is the importance of knowing the post partum depression and what could a father do in that case. My girlfriend feels guilty for not knowing that she was pregnant and feels bad because something could damage the little girl. Men don't know how it affects them but we should have it in consideration not only for an asymptomatic pregnancy.  Finally, we're not planning to get married in short term (one would expect to do so but our economic situation after this episode isn't the best), but we will be living together by next month and raise our girl in her hometown.

There were no signs of pregnancy, she didn't throw up, she didn't have nausea nor any common indicators of pregnancy until last month but we wouldn't notice it either.  As the father, the only thing I could notice was that she was a bit more sensitive (she normally isn't) but since I'm ill (diagnosed with Myalgic Encephalomyelitis on May this year), I attributed that to a reaction to my condition, not to the fact that she may have been affected by hormones."

AMA,3bz94x,TerranRhys,1 point,Fri Jul 3 15:51:17 2015 UTC,"The job is very frustrating, The problem is that there isn't just one company that does insurance there are thousands and each one has a different price for there insurance,  You spend your day giving people prices for there insurance and when you have spent about 20+ mins on the call to someone only to find out that the price you gave them doesn't even come close to there best you feel like that 20 mins has just been wasted, and this happens every day.....  Its not a horrible job though far from it, you feel good when your giving someone a fantastic deal and they appreciate the fact you have gone all out to make there experience an easy and pleasurable one,  The wage various from each company and area, At the moment am on £16,000 a year but I know that companies offer £25,000 for the exact same job that I do, My current role is an insurance advisor so I mainly sell policies, but you could end up being an underwriter and there the people who make the insurance policies and they get a lot of money,  Getting into insurance is really easy now, you may have to start at the bottom doing admin but your learning about insurance whilst your in that role and then when you think your ready you could move up to doing sales and then its just a case of going up and up from there.  Hope that answers most of your questions :)  If you ever wish to pursue a career in insurance then I would say go for it because we will always need insurance so the job should never die."

AMA,3bwxk9,Shugbug1986,5,Thu Jul 2 21:06:20 2015 UTC,"Better training, and a much more stringent hiring process. Some of the worst people I have ever met, were my coworkers there. They were monsters. Criminals that just didn't get caught. You work there for about a year before they even send you to the academy to learn DOC,SOPs and GOs. Then you take your state and local/county test. Up until you enter the academy, you can only be as good as your training officer is. It is dangerous to inmates and officers"
AMA,3bwxk9,Shugbug1986,3,Thu Jul 2 21:09:04 2015 UTC,"Do you feel the system itself ""works"" to any degree? Have you ever met anyone Who was behind bars Who really changed his life around?"
AMA,3bwxk9,excel958,7,Thu Jul 2 21:11:14 2015 UTC,"I helped several inmates with appeals. I wasn't Officer Friendly, but I am a human and acted as such. Some were in there are clearly bogus charges. I would offer as much information as I could, tell them who to contact and where to send info. One inmate found me when he got out and called me. His charges were reduced, and he was remanded to probation. His probation officer was sexually harassing him, and refused to let his wife be at any of his meetings with her., I advised him to record her, since it is legal to record others without their consent in my state. He did, played it for her superiors, and was released from probation for ""honorary behavior"". I still keep in contact with him and his wife. He is doing very well for himself and has recovered his marriage and financials since his incarceration.   I do not think the current system works. They are so busy jailing people on first time offenses, but let the people with 16 DUIs sleep it off and then release them. The recidivism rate is unbelievable. You could almost guarantee that within a month of most inmates being released, they would come back. I do think that work release and weekenders (people that only have to come to jail for the weekends) are good programs. I think they can help wean the people out of their current lifestyle, and encourage a better one without making them go broke in the process"

He then used the jagged broken part as a knife, and cut his testicles open. He pulled on out. Got him to care right away.   A few weeks before this, I had a guy pop his eye out of socket with his spoon, rip it to disconnect it and try to flush it down the toilet. When it would not flush, he ate it.   There is another reddit user, I can not recall their name, that has a spouse that works at the jail and has heard from others about this incident.

AMA,3bwxk9,skynetneutrality,6,Thu Jul 2 21:55:36 2015 UTC,"I am American, yes. I think there is next to nothing in terms of mental health care. No one wants to deal with them, so they get locked away in single cells with little to no contact except chow.   I use to be against prostitution, until I saw how many women were locked up, and how many times they come back. It is a massive waste of resources. I was also against drugs for a very long time, but I think locking someone up for having a personal amount on them is insane.   There is really no rehab for them. The ones that are drunk when they commit their crimes, dry out and get out. There is no AA or NA. They do not encourage any personal development past their incarceration. No real world skills taught, not even a chance to develop a skill. I have noticed that a system of rewards is the best way to get the most uncooperative inmate to cooperate. Incentives are needed for some, not just punishment. I am not saying people should be rewarded with cookies for doing what they should, but the facilities should encourage some form of positive reinforcement to obtain good behavior."
AMA,3bwxk9,skynetneutrality,3,Thu Jul 2 22:02:57 2015 UTC,"I had two tanks of 48 inmates(each tank had 3 individual cells inside with their beds). The worst of the worst offenders in the county. They were puppy dogs with me, because at the end of the month I would throw a cookie party with the tank that had the least amount of write ups. I never had any problems. I even accidentally got locked in there once. They were calling the control  center to have them override the door to get me out. No one came near me. They just kept saying, "" We're gonna get you out, bosslady. Don't worry"""

Penalty to the owner of the car if they use it.   Faster hearings, trials, and bonds. There is no reason for someone to sit in lock up for two weeks before they finally get a bond hearing.

AMA,3bwxk9,planetface,3,Thu Jul 2 22:54:47 2015 UTC,"The only incentive the Department of Justice has is profit. They do not want to extend help, when there is no way to recoup that money loss. The system focuses too much on punishment, beyond the actual sentence, than it does on rehabilitation and release. The legal system is so overrun with petty offenses, that first time offenders get screwed. Get busted for pot, get the same penalty as a drug runner. It is not fair. Sending barely legal kids to jail for petty crimes is only creating a new, and true, criminal. Social workers and govt employees have no desire to go above and beyond their jobs, because there is no pat on the back or appreciation by their bosses. Going above and beyond can actually get you fired for wasting govt finances."

On average, the state of Texas spends 30k per inmate, per year. Why? You spend more on incarcerating a person that had three joints on them, than what they would make if they were truly a drug dealer. We spend more than the average family income to lock up ONE person.

AMA,3bwxk9,havana_fair,3,Fri Jul 3 17:40:10 2015 UTC,"The males were much more violent. The primary fights would be the whole tank, or majority, beating a sex crime offender. Often, classification would mess up and send up an agg assault to put in general population. The inmates loved watching the news. Sometimes their new tank mate would be on the news for what he did. We knew we had seconds to get to him before the tank could. More often than not, we didn't arrive in time and would have to call an ambulance.  The females would fight over petty things. Used sanitary napkins would be left in the middle of the floor. Someone refused to bathe. Simple things that should be taken care of, but were not. They would steal from each other constantly.

When there was a sexual problem I came to him about, one of the devas went and told the Teacher, who lectured me for not letting go of my ego.

This process takes up to two hours and it makes me feel bad for the customer service people I speak to. My question: Is there any way to make this process quicker?

They bonus from giving a certain amount of people retention offers because it looks as if they saved a customer from leaving the company.  What I would recommend is one of two things : 1) Call in and just ask for the retention department say you were on the phone with them and the call got cut off. When you get on the phone with Retention department is just tell them you were just on the phone with them prior to you being disconnected and tell them they offered you the same plan you had for the same price you had before for another year. The two best money saving retention that we have that you could ask for is a free cable box that saves you $11.25 a month and free 200 mbps upgrade (if in maxx area if not it's 50 mbps) this is $20 a month. Our month runs from the 19th of a month to the 18th, so I would recommend calling in around the 15th when people are pressured for numbers"

So then, I research more into it, and the more I found out, the more it clicked that this is that thing that I'd been searching for, that part of me that I could never pinpoint or figure out.

AMA,3bxske,zeinayoo,2,Fri Jul 3 03:22:16 2015 UTC,"Mentally, I'm still me. I'm just as pacifistic as I was, my temperment hasn't changed. There has been a few times where I wanted to cry but couldn't and, pre-T, it was really easy to get me to cry. I'm definitely happier. More confident in how I look, because before, I would look at myself and think I was fat and ugly and misshapen with giant hips and so forth. Comparatively to women, I wasn't bad looking. But I had been subconsciously comparing myself to the bodies of men.  There is an effect of testosterone which is called fat redistribution, which is generally explained as, ""The fat in your body moves away from female areas like the hips and face and ass, and moves to male areas like the gut"". But what actually happens, is you loose weight and when you gain weight, the fat goes to male places. My upper arms are less fat, my thighs and hips and ass are less huge. There used to be a full 10 inches between my waist and hips measurements, but it's evening out- my waist has gotten a little bigger and my hips have gotten a little smaller. My body is beginning to take more of a square shape. My ass doesn't stick out as much  xD  Pre-T (pre testosterone), my legs didn't grow hair, not ever, I never had to shave. But now they are pretty hairy, which is great. No chest hair, but my brother doesn't have chest hair either, and my arms are still pretty hairless.  My voice is a present annoyance. I can hit a lower range, which is neat, and I've lost a higher range completely. My voice is very cracky and squeaky, Its a little like relearning how to speak, because I'm so used to speaking at the higher range so I go there naturally and my voice is like NOPE. So I have to train myself to speak deeper.  Libido was an adjustment. I went from being apathetic about sex, I could go months and months without it. Being on testosterone, my libido sped right up, I think about sex a lot more, and it's unusual for me to go more than a few days without it now. The urge to have sex is so much stronger now than it was.  I don't understand your levels question?"
AMA,3bxske,ok2nvme,1 point,Fri Jul 3 14:34:44 2015 UTC,Thanks for the reply. I am just curious about the effects of testosterone on the human body.   Question re levels is; how high do you run testosterone? Do you measure your blood levels with your doctor?

I went to school with this kid who was an amazing baseball player, He had full scholarships to top schools and everything, all he had to do was stay out of trouble for a few months until he went off to college. He had a month or so left and he was arrested for being one of two gunmen in a shooting that killed two people. He got 60 years at the age of 18 and he won't be paroled for at least 30, If he gets out of prison he will be 48 years old. That's the worst thing I've ever witnessed."

AMA,3bplwe,Unexpected_Hat,3,Wed Jul 1 05:56:14 2015 UTC,"I went through something similar a while back. I'm by no means an expert and I have no real training with this kind of thing, but my advice would be to start focusing on the little things, anything at all that you might be grateful for and might make you happy. I know this is hard. Depression is a horrible thing to have to dig yourself out of, but I promise you it can get better if you focus on the positive things in your life, anything positive at all. If you don't have anything positive right now, I urge you to go find something. Take a class, join a club, do some volunteer work, anything that might interest you and give you a sense of purpose. Give yourself a reason to want to get out of bed every day.  More than anything, never give up. If you feel that you're losing your battle, please don't feel like you need to suffer alone. Find someone or some group who can help you through this. A counselling group, a support group, a crisis hotline, anything to be your ally in this battle. There are lots of people who are willing to help. Please just don't give up."
AMA,3bplwe,KuKuMacadoo,3,Wed Jul 1 06:02:59 2015 UTC,"OP gave some really good advice there. Work on some short term and long term goals, try to envision exactly how you want your life to improve and what you're willing to do to make it better. Ideally, where do you want to be next week... in 6 months... in 4 years?  I was depressed at one point too; a deep, long, and painful depression that lasted for a couple of years. My problem was that I was giving other people my locust of control and leaving my life up to chance and fate. You don't have to do that, you have more control over your environment and destiny than you think.  Shoot me a message if you ever want to chat, but pick yourself up by the bootstraps and start making plans. If your plans fail, make new plans. You deserve to be successful and happy, but it's up to you to make it happen."

So:   How many channels do you run? Which automation system? How secure do you feel with channel-in-a-box and all the station groups buying each other and all that? How's the money in your market? Most embarrassing mistake you've seen at your station (whether or not you were responsible)?
AMA,3btyjx,TheJokersChild,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:06:51 2015 UTC,"Ah, a fellow op - very cool! I guess I expected the low turnout, seems like most people had no idea what a ""master control operator"" was when I would tell them in real life.  Anyway, to your questions...   Our station ran seven stations, four of which were Spanish language stations like Univision, Telemundo and Telefutura. I can't remember the name of the automation system (been off the job for about eight months now) but it operated in conjunction with our Leitch system. Well I think it ultimately leads to the elimination of the MCO altogether, if that's what you were getting at..? It was pretty good, and we were first in our market, but once we were bought out we dropped to last pretty quick. Most embarrassing mistake was made by a colleague/friend of mine. We were supposed to go to American Idol for prime, and our HD network splicer went down at the transition, so when he rolled to network on the board we just had bars and tone. We had no idea what the cause was and he was frantically contacting engineering, TOC and anyone else he could think of. The bars and tone ended up being on air for 18 minutes, and the SNAFU cost him his job. I felt really bad for my friend but it was a bad mistake.

It seems to differ in severity from person to person.  If I DID drink water/certain juices though, the best way to describe the reaction would be a very dry feeling, the feeling of swelling, hotness and avery painful aching. It can get hard to swallow, but nothing life threatening."

When you took them out did your nipples stay errect or did they got back to normal. How long did you have them in and how long has it been since you had them removed?
AMA,3btrm7,Cushietushie,1 point,Thu Jul 2 02:19:04 2015 UTC,Why do you think it is infected? If it has yellow discharge coming out or smelly discharge then that means infection.

You can't tell they are pierced anymore unless I point out where the holes used to be.

If it's not enough they don't see you as a serious person they can settle down with. Communication is key. If you make your feelings known there is less of a chance of getting them hurt most people tend to not want to hurt your feelings on purpose. Nobody however, is a mind reader and when it comes to feelings/empathy men tend not to be as in tuned as women tend to be. You need to make your intentions known.

I would advise people who are just diagnosed to IMMEDIATELY request their tax records from the previous year. Given that state/federal programs require them to gauge eligibility, it's imperative that you get them ASAP.   Doctors have told me that HIV is more easily transferred if the person has syphilis (it basically acts as a superconductor for the virus.)

I contracted it as a result of this -- either through oral sex, or because I did not notice the person and I engaged in sex without a condom. (I'm guessing oral sex is the perpetrator, however.)"
AMA,3br6v8,Zinc2093,2,Wed Jul 1 20:09:16 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure that's not true. One can absolutely contract HIV from oral sex.  http://www.cdc.gov/hiv/risk/behavior/oralsex.html
AMA,3br6v8,bucksrox,1 point,Wed Jul 1 20:23:25 2015 UTC,"Nope. It is. HIV is transmitted through preseminal fluid as well. You not only have your mouth to worry about through transmission, but your throat and esophagus. It's transmitted through open wounds or sores, so if you have cuts in your gums (like I possibly did from brushing my teeth,) you risk transmission.  Edited to add: I was told and assumed the same. My doctor (an infectious disease specialist) said otherwise."

Why is it attractive to me? I guess there's the sense of adventure and a desire to practice trusting that I'll find what I need without stressing over trying to control how it comes.   I love meeting new and interesting people, and when you hitchhike in particular, you find interesting and kind people.  When I was a teenager I decided that I wanted to avoid the pattern I saw so often of taking a job that I didn't really care for that took all of my energy and not leave time for things I actually want to do. I don't mean to say that I'm not willing to work out even have a ""regular"" job, but that I decided a long time ago that I would have to care about the work for its own sake. My longest job has been tutoring a bunch of my friends' kids in science in a sort of homeschool collective (7 years).   I want to make choices because they make sense to me, not because ""that's just what you have to do.""

The only lasting effects that I know of are the scarring feelings of having a catheter be stuck into my dick and taken out. That my friend, scarred me, it was so fucking painful.

AMA,3bqhd4,Car_Exporter_Japan,2,Wed Jul 1 09:21:39 2015 UTC,"Hey, /u/Car_Exporter_Japan. I translate from Japanese over at /r/translator in my spare time, and we often get requests for Japanese car inspection sheets from car auctions. Do you get your used cars at those car auctions? Or do you simply export for suppliers?     I've learned quite a bit about auction inspection sheets over the past year, and I was wondering if you had any general advice to people who purchase cars at auctions on the basis of those sheets. What kind of things do you look for in general to find a car worth exporting?  Thanks for the AMA."
AMA,3bqhd4,---------MC---------,2,Wed Jul 1 09:43:27 2015 UTC,"Yes, all the cars we buy are from the auction. There are various types of auction sheet depending on the auction houses. We have guys in the auction who reports back to us if there is any engine problem so we let our clients know before the auction starts.   My advice, always know your auction houses. Like Nyusatsu auctions, they don't check the vehicle's history! USS is the reliable one. Honda is the toughest one out of the bunch, very strict about their grading policy. At the end of the day, always read your auction sheet twice! ;)   Cars that are worth exporting? It really depends on the client and the market. Market like NZ is very strict so I avoid any auction areas that has snow due to rust and only auction grade 4 and above. Same can be applied for Mauritius. But countries in AFRICA that doesn't require inspection, we buy cars that are cheap and in working condition."
AMA,3bqhd4,---------MC---------,2,Wed Jul 1 10:34:41 2015 UTC,"Cool! Thanks for the reply. I'll be sure to let people know when they request an inspection sheet translation.    We have guys in the auction who reports back to us if there is any engine problem so we let our clients know before the auction starts.    Oh, you have contacts that work for the auction houses? Does that mean that they sell cars with engine problems without noting it on the sheets or somehow letting the buyers know? That's worrisome."
AMA,3bqhd4,---------MC---------,1 point,Wed Jul 1 11:01:46 2015 UTC,"I work for a big company so we have contacts in all the auction houses.   The auction sheet does mention the engine noise or engine problem. But there are times when it is too vague! So usually, our contacts double checks the most popular bids and cars for the most important clients. ;)"
AMA,3bqhd4,---------MC---------,1 point,Wed Jul 1 13:44:31 2015 UTC,I see! Thanks for the answers. It's interesting learning a little about these auctions that we get so many translation requests for.
AMA,3bqhd4,24WheatBiscuits,1 point,Wed Jul 1 13:59:17 2015 UTC,Why are you doing someone else's job? The company you are importing your car from does the translation for you as this is included in your service charges.
AMA,3bqhd4,will_code,1 point,Wed Jul 1 15:45:23 2015 UTC,"I'm not entirely sure what channels people go through when they visit /r/translator with inspection sheet requests. It was simply my understanding that they were individuals looking for a car to bid on. The sheets they ask to be translated are usually low resolution images that I imagine were pulled from some auction website. I've never considered the fact that I might be doing someone's job. It's a sub for small translations, and we make it a point to turn down requests where money is involved.   I'll ask the poster next time we get a request and see what's up. I thought they just visited some Japanese website to browse cars but if they went through a company that translates for them I'd leave it up to them.   I suppose the other alternative is that someone couldn't handle their own translation request and tried to get help with their job. This is common on professional translation forums, but at least they knowingly help each other. I'd rather not unknowingly be doing someone's job for them!   Anyway, thanks for the heads up."

AMA,3bn0dy,mdmrules,2,Tue Jun 30 15:59:45 2015 UTC,"I studied at the University of Plymouth in the UK.  The monetary aspect of the job is a big influence for me, alongside I want to work with the oceans in some capacity.  The main employment in the sector is Oil and Gas, however there are obviously renewable energy sources like wind farms, tidal energy. Also there is always need for dredging, specifically in ports all across the world to maintain the water levels required for ships to pass through.   Currently there is an ongoing project in Papua New Guinea which is focusing on mining Seafloor Massive Sulphides, which are huge deposits of precious minerals and metals such as copper and zinc, alongside gold and silver and many others. My dissertation project was based on these deposits and in particular the cost effectiveness of the projects.  Hope that answered your question relatively well."

The fact is, like with most species, male rats are lazy creatures and while capable of great things, they much prefer laying around and eating when not being loved on. Not to say rats aren't extremely intelligent. Every rat I've owned learned it's name in record time and will respond to it. Sam more so than the others, but I've had him longer.

AMA,3bi1rm,Rimbobo,3,Mon Jun 29 16:21:34 2015 UTC,Did you speak the language of the other prisoners? (I don't know if it's Mandarin or Cantonese)  Who was your closest friend?  Did you feel safe for the most part?  Aside from being segregated after 9/11 were you treated any differently than other prisoners?  How big are you? Height/weight  Very interesting situation you found yourself in and this AMA is lacking the traction it deserves. These are a couple questions off the top of my head but I could keep going haha.
AMA,3bi1rm,Gilahof,9,Mon Jun 29 18:36:27 2015 UTC,"I learned Cantonese. There were some foreign prisoners, Pakistani, Portuguese, Thai. Ironically, a Pakistani was my closest friend. He ended up getting 6 years added to his sentence for extortion, but he was being extorted into extortion.   For the most part. Once, one group went off against another and I found myself with my Pakistani friend holding the cell gate closed between two groups wielding knives. I wouldn't have done it if I thought they were going to stab me. That was my luxury as an American, everyone knew if I got hurt there'd be serious hell to pay with the officials.   One night, too many people were tapping into the electricity and we blew a fuse. This was maximum security, where I went after protection. I was in the first cell nearest the guards, so they told me to call him. I knocked the lock against the cell and a few guards came a few minutes later. Usually, they just flipped the fuse which was right where they were supposed to be, and didn't make a big deal out of it. But they were looking to fuck with someone.  They had their sticks out and were asking, who called us? I kept saying I did, and they kept ignoring me. So I finally just shouted, it was me. They asked me who told me to. I said I just did it. The guy in the next cell laughed. They pounced on him. What you laughing about? They opened his cell and hit him a couple times each.  They go for the bottom of your feet if they want to hobble you, your thighs if they plan on keep it going and your back for the heavy licks.   I'm six foot, 180."

AMA,3bi1rm,inthe801,5,Mon Jun 29 14:41:04 2015 UTC,"The place was filthy. The prison didn't follow most of their own rules.   It got really bad for me on 9/11. I was moved to protective custody and spent 24 hrs a day in lockdown. We were supposed to get out once a week, but if any of the prisoners, there were six in the section, didn't want to, then none of us could.  Violence could pop-off at the drop of a hat. I saw guys stab each other over a banana. I stopped a stabbing once between two friends over a joke. One took it personal, started a fight. It was broken up and he went for a shank. I saw him with it and grabbed his wrist, twisted it out of his hand. He came to his senses within a minute or so.  Yes. I sold hash from about 16 to 20, when I was arrested. I was guilty, but they had zero evidence. Macau puts you straight in prison upon arrest and has a conviction rate near 100%."

I watched so many people miss out on parole, I didn't think I would get it. So many times my dreams ended with me being sucked back to prison just before I would wake up. This continued for a while after."
AMA,3bi1rm,sthome,2,Mon Jun 29 18:00:12 2015 UTC,Did you ever had do fight to win respect? What is the other best way to stay out of trouble?
AMA,3bi1rm,sthome,7,Mon Jun 29 21:23:21 2015 UTC,"When you first get into in new section of the prison, the cell boss will give you rules to follow, ask you to do 50 push-ups, make you clean the cell. The floor boss will do the same. They will also ask for money.  I got to about 25 push-ups before they stopped me and frm then n, the cell boss didn't ask me for much. The floor boss wanted cash. I didn't refuse to pay, I refused to ask anyone on the outside for money. Refusing to pay is dangerous: shows you don't respect them. They liked me more for not rolling over and eventually I arranged 1/2 key for them on the upside.  After that section, it got easier. People know you, claim you and you don't have to do much.   The people who went unclaimed or unliked got stuck cleaning toilets, handing out hot water, cleaning, etc. They got 2 cartoons for the work from the floor boss, each prisoner providing 2 packs a month if not working.   You have to stand up for yourself and let people know that it might cost them to fuck with you, but the idea of knocking the biggest guy out is for movies. Works well in a street fight, but not when yu are locked in the same few thousands square feet.   Not being a pushover, but not messing with the system will keep you out of trouble. You get to know people pretty quick when it becomes a matter of watching someone's back or getting stabbed in the back. People respect studious inmates, people with an angle (maybe they work in the kitchen and can bring back some garlic), people with money (but you have to be careful how you use it and how much you let people think you have).  Read a lot, respect the situation, don't look the guards in the eye."
AMA,3bi1rm,jatora,2,Mon Jun 29 22:04:13 2015 UTC,"These are good questions, but prison is about people. I saw a lot of crazy people and crazy situations. There was a Tibetan guy who added six 0s to a a dollar bill and tried to cash it. He got a couple years for that. There was the case of my good Portuguese friend:  I'll call him Tony. He was an amazing footballer and was contracted to a junior Benefica squad at 17. He got into heroin and his football chances disappeared. His mom finally told him to get his life together and thought that Macau would get him out of his lifestyle.   In Macau, he got a job in a restaurant. After work, his colleagues would smoke ice. Soon he was smoking it daily and starting to sell it. There are groups of Russian prostitutes in Macau that became his customers. He had a friend named Simon and they were making good money supplying the girls and would get freebies.   Tony told me his trick with women was to be shy. I guess this works if the women are in such a profession and you're their supplier. Simon wasn't as lucky with the ladies. Anyways, a pimp was getting wary of his wife and asked Tony to fuck her so he could have an excuse to leave her. He did, but the pimp had a change of heart and got pissed at Tony.   Tony and Simon went to pick up three ounces of ice from Hong Kong. When they got off the boat in Macau, Customs were waiting for Tony and Simon watched as they pulled his friend into a search, knowing that he had three ounces in his pocket. He had been set up by the pimp. Tony had smoked ice on the way and was talkative during the interrogation. Which is never a good idea. They repeatedly demanded to search his place and after a couple hours, he agreed.  Simon had gone back to the shared apartment and cleaned everything up. And put it into his own room. When they came to search, he tried to stop them from checking his room, but it didn't work. They busted them both.  In prison, Simon blamed Tony constantly and loudly. He was belligerent with the other prisoners and they beat the crap out of him. The infirmary did blood work while patching him up and found he had AIDS.   They spent five years trying to get transferred to a Portuguese prison. I got a letter from Tony, but don't know what happened to them after."

AMA,3bm9yx,StudentII,1 point,Tue Jun 30 11:52:12 2015 UTC,"I ask because I am curious if you have a psych background, and there curious what you think about how hypnosis is regarded as a treatment in the larger psych field."
AMA,3bm9yx,StudentII,1 point,Tue Jun 30 13:48:13 2015 UTC,"I have no other psych training or background, no.  I can only guess at what your psych colleagues think of hypnotherapy. I imagine they are worried that there are people who are unregulated and untrained out there. People who make claims to be able to cure different ailments etc.  I operate on strict guidelines. If somebody has some sort of psychosis then I am in no way qualified to deal with that client and will refer them to go and see their doctor. If somebody comes in with a medical problem (pain, depression etc) then i always advise them to see their doctor first. I offer complimentary therapy only and make no claims or promises to people.  I imagine your psych friends just think its placebo effect?"
AMA,3bm9yx,StudentII,1 point,Tue Jun 30 14:08:47 2015 UTC,"I think it's good that you refer out with serious problems and do not try to treat things outside of your expertise. What things do you treat?  As far as efficacy goes...I think at this point one could only speculate as to whether it's the placebo effect or some aspect of hypnosis, I'm not familiar with the research, nor am I sure that there is really that much high quality research out there looking at hypnosis. Mindfulness has been gaining popularity, which I think has some overlap."
AMA,3bm9yx,sirnokea,1 point,Tue Jun 30 19:32:36 2015 UTC,"Hypnosis can be applied to almost anything within reason. I teach mindfulness techniques to a lot of my clients and your right there is an overlap as mindfulness I think has evolved from self hypnosis. I have a lot of clients who want to quit smoking or to lose weight. I use a lot of suggestion with them and also something called ""parts therapy""  Parts therapy is where I would ask my client to bring forward that part of them that wants to continue that behaviour, to give it a voice, to acknowledge it and to hear the reasons why it does it and what ""benefits"" it feels it gets in return. Then I would ask the part of them that wants to quit or stop that behaviour to come forward and to hear why it wants to stop. Then It is a case of leading the client to find an agreement between the two parts and create a new way forward of thinking.  I treat phobias, nervousness, stress, confidence issues... to name everything is difficult. I recently helped a client with a ""filler"". He kept saying the word ""obviously""  in gaps of talking to the point it was driving him and everyone else mad. Im not sure how I would class that?  Your right there is not a lot of scientific research with hypnotherapy, however you might be interested in this... http://digest.bps.org.uk/2013/08/neuroscience-gets-serious-about-hypnosis.html ... and hopefully one day you and your colleagues may look at hypnosis with passing interest and have a go yourselfs. There are a lot of psychological factors that you will be able to explain way better than me."

AMA,3bm9yx,sirnokea,1 point,Tue Jun 30 13:54:57 2015 UTC,"I have always had an interest in the mind and consciousness. I started to study hypnotherapy about 4-5 years ago and practised some of it on my friends. I found that they responded quite well and was fascinated by what I had done. It was about January time last year that I had some sort of life review where I asked myself what I wanted to do with my life. Did I want to look back when I was old and retired and think I just worked for money, or did I want to look back and see myself doing something positive for people. I decided on the latter so saved up the money to attend the course that I did.  Before that I had various jobs. Tax advisor, binman, salesman and other various labouring jobs."
AMA,3bm9yx,eveningLamb,1 point,Tue Jun 30 14:18:50 2015 UTC,"Oh, also. What is happening when an arm/leg ""just likes"" to go back to deepened state? Is it a good sign, bad sign or just a sign?"
AMA,3bm9yx,TheDarkKitten95,1 point,Tue Jun 30 14:03:19 2015 UTC,Can you be a bit more clearer on your question please? Are you refering to a hypnotic induction?
AMA,3bm9yx,TheDarkKitten95,1 point,Tue Jun 30 14:22:20 2015 UTC,"Ah, sorry yes. It's hard to be clearer because it's quite strange :D I've been hypnotised a few times, have always forgot to ask about this really.   It happens after 1-2h after hypnotic session/tape listening and only on part of body (arm/leg). It feels like an arm liked the relaxed hypnotic state so much it wants to go back to ""sleep"".  It resolves easily if I pay attention to it. I've pondered if that means I should  pay more attention on my stress levels or if my (personalised) recording is a bit off and should contact the author or not.  Nothing worrying, merely interesting."
AMA,3bm9yx,TheDarkKitten95,1 point,Tue Jun 30 14:42:45 2015 UTC,"Hmmmm. To be honest I have never heard of something like this. When you come out of ""trance"" do you feel fully wide awake and conscious?   Without prying too deeply were you using hypnosis for stress?"

Had a one night stand with a boy from my high school. So, I'd like to say that I would change that, but to be honest we both learned so much through that experience that it's hard for me to say that I would change it. I guess I wish I would have been more selfless early on in our marriage. Also, I wish I wasn't a worrier, I think it must be hard for my husband to deal with me sometimes because I'm an anxious person."

For example you can apply to position civil related, chemical, electrical, manufacture related?  Currently entering last year of college undergrad BSME"
AMA,3bm4py,underratedintern,1 point,Tue Jun 30 13:36:47 2015 UTC,"Yes I graduated last year, I studied at the North West University in Potchefstroom South Africa. Well I think its a bachelors, however I've been told that engineering degrees include their honours as well since you have to do a detailed project in your final year, which I have done.  But nonetheless I've only been working 6 months, so I'm still very inexperienced and learning something new every day. It is true that you can apply for any field that you desire, however in this industry experience is crucial and will definitely determine whether you get the position.  But my boss is a mechanical year and has been in the field for over 40 years, I have seen him tackle complete projects containing mechanical, civil and electrical components on his own with success."

There was an Mennonite guy who killed himself with his rifle in his barn during the dead of winter. The barn was on the top of a hill and it was about two in the morning when we showed up. We had to use torpedo heaters to heat the barn up so that his remains would thaw from the rafters above us. None of the people would go back the next day except for me. They all said that it have them nightmares and refused to go. I had to y ake a completely different crew with me the next day.
AMA,3bghgk,Tozzybomb64,3,Mon Jun 29 03:31:39 2015 UTC,Did you not get nightmares? I'm surprised a Mennonite actually took their own life.
AMA,3bghgk,AGuyYouNeverMet,2,Mon Jun 29 04:59:32 2015 UTC,I have always suffered from night terrors so that scene didn't trouble me very much. I've always been pretty capable of detaching myself from an emotional situation.

AMA,3bghgk,DRUNKJESSE,2,Tue Jun 30 02:05:03 2015 UTC,"My father had a similar incident.  He lived next to a church in Illinois, and this guy who had been suffering from manic depression went to the church, and right by the back (or side, I don't remember) door, took a shotgun to his face.    Two women found the scene, but were too afraid to approach it, so they knocked on the nearest door (my Dad's) and he went over.  Said the guy's head just looked like a deflated balloon.  When they removed the body, they removed NOTHING else, so my dad went over to help clean up the pieces of brain, teeth, and jaw bone from around the place since the preacher couldn't stomach it."
AMA,3bghgk,AGuyYouNeverMet,2,Mon Jun 29 21:32:04 2015 UTC,That's pretty damn horrible. The easiest clean up I ever had was a guy in a small two bedroom ranch. He had gone into the main closet and sat down in a diningroom chair. He'd put a 5 gallon bucket on the floor in front of him and shot himself in the back of the head. The majority of the mess was in the bucket. We still had to replace nearly everything but it really disturbed me how aware and polite he was of the potential clean up.

AMA,3beq4v,ItalianKitten,4,Sun Jun 28 20:17:16 2015 UTC,"Good question! Although donation is a wonderful advance in medicine, I don't think people will ever be designated a donor be default. This is mostly because it would be a HUGE violation of the code of biomedical ethics via the violation of human autonomy and decision making about their own body. In my opinion, the main problem behind donation is that so many people don't understand it and they have no clue what can be donated. If more people were educated on it I think we would see a major increase in registry."

I feel like I blend in better, which helped my social anxiety, because I knew I wouldn't have to talk to anyone since nobody cares about fat people except other fat people.  I was really docile and almost pet-like with my wife, which she liked because she wasn't used to it from other men.  I enjoyed being fat during sex, too.  To me it was easier because when I was thin my wife complained I was too bony in bed, so I loved fat sex.  I got hot often, but chairs were more comfortable.  I ate and was hungry all the time after I got fat.  My sexlife skyrocketted after I got fat.  My muscles also grew from the new protein, but being lazy got me up to 230.  This was my least favorite.  I used to run a lot and was really light on my feet.  I was all boney everywhere, so sitting, was uncomfortable.  I was alway too cold and getting sick.  I sometimes ran 10 miles.  Sometimes drunk.  I couldn't eat as much as I can now.  I was physically weak.  Women were always treating me like a wuss. (I also had no game back then, though.)  I was about 150-175 in my skinny days.  After that I started putting on muscle and had a slight belly.  So average.  Muscular is what I am now.  I eat like I never have before.  I remember once having 4 beers and three bacon cheeseburgers.  I do pullups, deadlifts, curls, reverse curls, diamond pushups, and various gym machine and dumbell exercises.  I also work my legs, so I have great balance.  I can do acrobatics I never thought I was able to do.  I do 4 exercises at 5 sets 5 reps per exercise.  I try to lift for raw power rather than looking good.  I love being fit, but I miss the fat sex.  I'm about 180-190 pounds sometimes I bulk and get 199ish, but I always go back down fast."

She made a lot of starchy, bready, sugary types of foods and drinks and always tried to keep me on the couch, comfortable.  It embarasses me how much I let her control me.  To get muscular I started chugging milk, eating bacon more and just basically overeating anything with protein in it.  I eat plenty of real foods too.  Vegetables, fruits, nuts, fish.

I was much healthier then and stronger, but I wasn't buff while I was in.  I met my wife and dated her for a bit.  After the Marine Corps, we moved in together.  She was about 260 pounds. By contrast I was about 170 pounds.  She started interrupting my gym time and I got lazy, but I kept up that 1000 calories per meal.  My wife also alway kept me stuffed, docile, smoking weed, and sex-drunk.  She wanted to lock down a good provider husband.  I saw what she was doing, but I felt so good that I let it all happen.    Then my wife decides to get her about 290 pound behind into shape and I slim down with her.  We both start rebuilding muscle.  I got to maybe 200ish before I started to seriously lift and eat lots of protein.  My wife just got slim at first down to 140 pounds.  She is now starting to show signs of rippled muscles at the gym and she is more fun to wrestle with.    All of this took place from my teenage years of 16 or so until today.  I'm 24 now."
AMA,3bg5jh,TheAverageWhiteGuy,1 point,Sun Jun 28 23:32:29 2015 UTC,How long did it take you guys to go from the rolly polly to the muscle wrestle party?  Did you go to the gym every day?
AMA,3bg5jh,BUFF4LO,1 point,Sun Jun 28 23:37:57 2015 UTC,"My wife got thin before she got actually, so it took her a while and it was a real challenge for her because she wanted to lose weight the lazy way. (Lol)  It took me about 3-5 weeks to see it in my arms.  At first I was still fat, but I started to see muscles bulging at odd places in my arms.  I had a big bag that I crammed with clothes (really crammed) and put a few big rocks in.  I benched it, deadlifted it, and did other workouts in my apartment to get started.  I started going to the gym with my wife, but I was already strong before starting at the gym.  Went to the gym every other day and focused on compound heavy resistance power-lifting types of workouts like deadlifts, pullups... you know, man workouts.    It took me about 4 months to go from being a obese waddling fatty, to being fitter than I had ever been.  I can't run as far as when I was thin, but I feel healthier and I'm happier."

AMA,3bg5jh,BUFF4LO,1 point,Mon Jun 29 00:00:28 2015 UTC,Yeah.  I would do a combination of lifting and running.  Thats just what works for me though.  Don't give up.  The internet has a wealth of information out there.

Did physical therapy for 3 months, and then had surgery where I had all of the above repaired, and ended up having to stay in the hospital three days and go on short term disability for two months.

AMA,3bef29,yes_it_is_weird,2,Sun Jun 28 13:33:55 2015 UTC,Hey thanks for taking time to do an AMA. My question is why is it that you and a few other males in the industry have had relatively long careers and females seem to be much more short lived?
AMA,3bef29,Saituchiha,3,Sun Jun 28 15:31:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah for sure, it seems like the industry is pretty biased. I guess it's because the market is mainly female dominated so new stars are coming in and out, and also the fact that in Porn a lot of sexism comes into play from many of the directors etc. I think however we do have a few female stars who've been around for light years e.g. Nina."
AMA,3bef29,Gurgel007,1 point,Sun Jun 28 17:53:47 2015 UTC,Could you elaborate on what you mean by sexism by directors?
AMA,3bef29,BBCPhilly,5,Sun Jun 28 18:29:32 2015 UTC,Ah sorry I probably didn't explain too well. Generally directors are male and usually in the industry demand a more younger female which can cause a lot of bias in the industry. it seems like stars such as Lex Steele will never fade dependent on their age!
AMA,3bef29,BBCPhilly,2,Mon Jun 29 01:56:31 2015 UTC,"Oh, another question I forgot: some of pornstars have kids now - some retired, some still perform. Do you know how they cope with ""what does your mother do as a job""? Do they tell kids about it, do they hide it? I always wondered. Another one: is there any pornstar you'd love to work with? Any retired pornstars you'd love to work with? What do you like in girls most, tits, ass, face, or maybe something else? What's the most gross thing you did in porn (and off-porn)? What do you hate in porn most? (answering what you love in porn would be to easy ;)  Also: you're probably the most popular porn actor in Poland, known as Łysy z Brazzers (Bald from Brazzers). Think about filming something here, Rocco Siffredi gave it a shot, Lisa Sparxxx broke world record of gangbang in Warsaw ;)"
AMA,3bef29,RICKY_Nicholoff,4,Sun Jun 28 20:38:55 2015 UTC,"Generally it's best to tell your kids and get it out of the way. I can't really speak for pornstars with kids!  I'd love to work with Gianna Michaels again, I masturbated to our scene a good 20 times.   I love great thighs on a girl.  The thing I hate the most in porn is probably being recognized in awkward places, I've been recognized in Target, MiccyDs and even in church.  I fucked a polish milf a few years ago, can't remember her name though!"
AMA,3bef29,RICKY_Nicholoff,2,Mon Jun 29 01:53:56 2015 UTC,"A few years ago, it seemed like you were in just about every video that Brazzers released.

Did getting a blowjob increase the experience or did it ruin the steak?

I was very lucky that my family were 100% supportive but I have friends who weren't that lucky and I know it will be very stressful.

AMA,3bfbkk,ShaunSanDena,1 point,Sun Jun 28 19:11:52 2015 UTC,"Pedantic, but that's not really correct. It's more correct to think of female being the default. Without action the fetus will become female. However, the male chromosome is present from conception and the differentiation between the sexes occurs earlier than structures can be distinguished. To explain the last part more clearly, females and males are ""unsexed"" in that they have the same underdeveloped parts early on. With intervention those parts can become male, but without intervention become female. It's not like fetuses display female genetalia that then become male."

This is very funny and sad in the same time. And all this stuff is a result of putin's control.  US sanctions are not so tough for simple people, but it has effect in the prices. Our people's revenues are really low ( not in the Moscow or Saint Petersburg)  and it is hard for us.  US is a good country, maybe too martial, but stiil - top medicine, top IT, top education and others.  There are several reasons why I want to move to the US.

Vegetables, potato, some kind of meat (chicken or beef), and this red color is made by beet. Did you heard about ""pelmeni"" (ravioli)? Home-made pelmeni is a greatest food I've ever eat (in russian food of course).  I don't have any feelings about Serbia and Serbians at all. All I know is that we were friendly since the dawn of time I think because of spreading Slavdoms to three direction - West, East and South. West is the Poland now, East - Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, South - Balkans, Serbia, Yugoslavia, you know. We have similar language, similar words, similar rituals, all this stuff. Also we had strong friendship in time of Yugoslavia and USSR, I think this is another reason of matching Serbians and Russians."

When I uttered those words, the last of the three jumped up, teared me off his wife. He was breathing heavily and I think he was about to punch me.

AMA,3bem8h,PUBLIQclopAccountant,3,Sun Jun 28 17:15:58 2015 UTC,"Higher education usually is free. (At least every single undergraduate program is free at all levels, university level and higher ""technical"" school level).   Some of the better graduate programs have tuition but it's usually cheap, like 2.000-5.000 for the whole degree.   Now about the salaries. It is important to note that unemployment is really high in official numbers, and I say official because a large percentange of the workforce is employed illegally, without insurance. That's most of the waiters, or blue collar workers. They make anywhere between 400-800 euros a month.   The official minimum wage is a little under 800 euros a month, so most office workers make that. Now of course career professionals can make much more. In Greece anything more than 2k a month is considered a high salary.   But there is a lot of taxation, so people making career money pay a lot of it back in taxes. People pay part of their wages in taxes, property taxes for anything (cars, houses etc), and taxes just because Greece doesn't have money. Even poor people (AND UNEMPLOYED PEOPLE) are forced to pay emergency taxes (600-800 per year) the last 3 years in their electricity bill."

AMA,3bem8h,maximuszen,2,Sun Jun 28 20:51:47 2015 UTC,"Hindsight is 20/20, but this question takes a lot to answer to a decent degree.   First of all it's the very structure of the European Union. I for one would want to see one day a fiscal union to go with the monetary policy union. A 'United States of Europe' as people call it.   As it is, we have free trade agreements, tied monetary policy and loose fiscal policy. Countries that rely on exports benefit, countries without heavy industries suffer. If it isn't Greece now, it's Portugal in 5 years, or Ireland in 7 or something. That's the problem with the Union.   To get into Greece's problems, we have to start with it's public sector. Greece is an Island nation in a very hostile neighbourhood, so it's forced to invest and subsidice it's islands to keep people there, not to have it's territory contested (and it is constantly contested). Every one of those islands has to have a port, a school, many have small airports, doctors. Infastructure in general. Yes 600.000 public sector workers out of 11.000.000 people is a lot, but apart from bureocracy and ineffectiveness a large part of it is unavoidable.   Then we have the governments over the years, and the major part of the Greek people's blame. Again hindsight is 20/20, but our governments are deeply corrupt and nobody ever did anything serious about that. Remember all those public sector workers? Politicians put them there, qualifications be damned, as favors to buy votes. Our tax enforcement is a joke, businessmen basically own the rulling parties.   To get to today, and leave history behind. Everybody, and I mean literally everybody has always known that Greece isn't going to ever pay back their loans. It got to a breaking point in 2009, and we should have defaulted back then. It would have been really painfull but people who voiced that opinion were the minority.   Instead what happened and what kept happening until now, is foreign interests just keep barely steering the wheel to cover their ass. All those billions that you hear about go to pay back bank loans of French and German banks, and obligatory pay for new Ships and airlpanes from their manufacturers.   In those 5 years the EU barely kept Greece out of full default to enact their framework to handle it and limit their exposure. We got basically nothing out of it, only 5 years of heavy austerity.   It doesn't matter if it's this government that put an end to it, or the previous continued austerity until the camel broke it's back and every single asset was auctioned off, eventually Greece was going to default. It will do it now and it's 5 years overdue. It's going to be painful."

Is this the equivalent to American baseball heroes or is it more of a religion to greek culture?

AMA,3bem8h,HitlerWasASexyMofo,2,Sun Jun 28 19:24:16 2015 UTC,"Ok so that's a broad topic. Greeks are mostly focused on their ancient history, byzantine heritage, and their various revolutionary wars. So most heroic stories, moral stories etc come from (often exaggerated) historical and not mythological records.   We are being taught mythology ONLY in primary school, around age 10 so most people have trouble recalling all the names and the stories. But Greek children are being brought up with Aesop's Fables and those stories are part of our mainstream culture.  People who don't specifically study the mythology, probably won't have a deep understanding of it (myself included to a certain extent).   Ancient Greek mythology isn't really viewed with a religious aspect, Greeks are deeply religious (Greek Orthodox Christian dogma), and Christians were really hostile against the old religion, destroying temples etc."

AMA,3bbj8p,Ajs122,1 point,Sat Jun 27 22:06:18 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure I would say I ""cured"" my allergies as much as I outgrew them, but yes, it's possible that you're not allergic to shellfish anymore. My seafood allergy came only a couple months ago, so it'd be a while before I'd outgrow it, but I've been allergic to beef and soy for 7-8 years and I'm probably not allergic to them anymore (though since I don't know, I still avoid them).  You could ask your doctor how to be tested for shellfish- skin patch tests and ""food challenges"" (eating little bits of shellfish over a certain amount of time while being monitored by doctors) are some good ways to be tested, but I think you'll still need an endoscopy in the end to be sure.  Though the seriousness of your allergy is also important. For example, I have celiac disease, so there's no way I'm outgrowing my gluten allergy and I'm not sure about if you can outgrow an allergy in which you need an Epi-Pen, but it's definitely worth asking your doctor."

I haven't found any but one of my coworkers once witnessed a kayaker get throttled to death in a river during a storm. He tried to save the kayaker but couldn't reach him.

AMA,3baxqs,whenaboymeetslove,1 point,Sat Jun 27 18:11:01 2015 UTC,"I was obese for a long time as a child and I hated it. Between my 8th and 9th year of school was when I started. I have had the ability to regurgitate my food, and it made it easier. My parents kind of known but I convinced them that I wasn't doing it. Later on, I stopped and binged a lot of food in 10th year. I was eventually hospitalized for fainting one night. I eventually was hospitalized for low nutrients in my body. This was bad at school because it made walking hard to my classes. I found out that I had a condition called Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, a condition that affected the electrical signals in my heart. It could've killed me from cardiac arrest I believe. I was in a partial hospitalization program, but had a mental breakdown from deaths around my 16th birthday. At one point, I was 125lbs. Eventually I went to a residential hospital, which taught me a lot on mindfulness and I spent three months there. Now I'm better. I still have social anxiety and some slight PTSD. And I am going to college which will prove a challenge."

Although they don't know I'm a psychopath (I've done a pretty good job of keeping my diagnosis under wraps), I was never a normal kid growing up. For most of my early years I was always the ""quiet kid"" who sat by myself and didn't like talking with other kids. Originally I was suspected of being autistic because of this. It wasn't until around 7th-8th grade that I started to realize that I had a knack for manipulating people. From then on I became more violent and impulsive. I did a lot of drugs and ended up getting arrested for while in high school.So yeah, my parents knew that something was wrong, though I've definitely calmed down over the past few years."

AMA,3bd76p,123noodle,3,Sun Jun 28 04:23:03 2015 UTC,"A topic I want to go over more thoroughly is boredom, since it's  pretty big part of my existence and the driving force behind why I started this post.   Being a psychopath is incredibly boring. The human brain craves stimulation, and i think the majority of it comes from things that require emotion such as socialization or a feeling of being ""fulfilled""  through achieving or striving for a meaningful life. I, however, am more limited in my options for stimulation, leading to a constant state of boredom.   I can achieve short-term thrills through reckless/dangerous behavior or by keeping myself as busy as possible to take the edge off it, but for the most it only keeps it from building up too quickly. It's akin to being perpetually stuck in a empty padded cell. Once in a while this boredom reaches a certain point, and I start getting very restless. I have a strong urge to something, but there's absolutely nothing to do. It takes a lot of focus to keep this under wraps, which isn't very tough to break. Over time I'll slowly let it out through various activities. If something comes up that I would otherwise find annoying though, its sometimes enough for me to lose my grip, which leads into what I refer to as anger. This is when I would either lash out with violence or bury it under drugs, as a kind of emergency release.  I've never enjoyed this, mostly because a lack of control is something I detest. Though in recent years I've ""evened out"", and these outburst are now very rare. Although the boredom is a lot more prevalent as a whole, mostly because I've gotten good at restraining my more violent impulses, it doesn't really boil over anymore."

Also, they are filled with varying degrees of corruption and bribes. Ironically enough though, they are a necessary evil. Most are specifically designed to limit the power any one person can have.

We can't talk through our minds like so many people think we can.  That being said there is some sixth sense to us.  We constantly are finishing each other's sentences, thinking the same thing at the same time (one of will mention what they're thinking of and the other will reveal that they were thinking the same exact thing).  We've also on only a few occasions had the same dream on the same night. We both have pretty much the same group of friends, we have the same interests in books, movies, music, etc.  I think that these things definitely make us more identical in subtle ways. No we don't, our parents view us as the same age because we are.  However, I have feeling that he is the favorite child."

AMA,3b7378,redditors_r_manginas,11,Fri Jun 26 16:09:52 2015 UTC,"When we were in high school we switched places every now and then.  We'd wear each other's clothes, shirts, pants, shoes.  We would go to each other's classes and usually half the people in the class would know and the other half would be oblivious.  A memorable time when we switched was when I first started dating my ex girlfriend my brother dressed as me and went up to her and they hugged and she quickly realized it was him and backed away in horror.  She was just surprised we all laughed about it later.  And we're similar in almost every way, but we do have our own personalities."
AMA,3b7378,Taisubaki,6,Fri Jun 26 16:15:45 2015 UTC,How did people catch on there was a switch?  Like how did you ex know it was your brother and not you?  Do y'all's voices sound identical?
AMA,3b7378,Kindofalotofdave,5,Fri Jun 26 17:45:32 2015 UTC,"Our voices sound pretty similar as well, but people who know us well can just tell."
AMA,3b7378,myredditaccunt,3,Fri Jun 26 19:08:01 2015 UTC,How are you two in terms of personality? Are there any differences?
AMA,3b7378,ActorBasedReality,7,Fri Jun 26 17:48:12 2015 UTC,"We both have our own personalities like everyone else, but we have a lot of similar interests and friends.  He is more out going than I am, and knows a lot more people but we have the same group of close friends.  If someone knows one of us it's a good chance they know the other one as well."
AMA,3b7378,ActorBasedReality,3,Fri Jun 26 19:07:53 2015 UTC,"Why do you say ""identical mirror twin""? Is he literally an opposite reflection of you (mole on your left cheek appears on his right cheek) or do enjoy redundancy? Or are you emphasizing how closely you resemble each other?  Anyways, the real question: were you in the same classes throughout all of school? Are you both pursuing the same careers?"
AMA,3b7378,ActorBasedReality,8,Fri Jun 26 18:43:39 2015 UTC,"I say mirror twin because I'm right handed and he's left handed.  That's just what it's called I guess, there's nothing like he has mole on his left arm and I have a mole on my right arm, nothing like that.  Through high school and college (we went to the same college) we had many classes together and we are both pursuing the same career, teaching high school history!"
AMA,3b7378,airJordan45,6,Fri Jun 26 19:01:50 2015 UTC,"Not OP, but mirror twins are often more subtle things, like the natural part of their hair. Also, one will be right handed, the other left."
AMA,3b7378,jatora,5,Fri Jun 26 18:50:55 2015 UTC,"There's always subtle things that make the individuals of a twin set unique. My brother and I, /u/akutalji, had longer hair as children - both of us had wavy hair that eventually ended in curls. Mine curled outwards - and his inwards."
AMA,3bbmqk,AtomicEmerson,2,Sat Jun 27 17:50:08 2015 UTC,"I'm from Ohio so I'm very familiar with that park. First thing is to make sure you time your day properly, otherwise you might spend 3/4 of it waiting in lines and 1/4 actually riding rides. Millennium force is the best, really fun and suspenseful. Dragster is the most terrifying, but totally worth the 8 seconds or so. The two newest ones (the one opened last summer and this summer) are both pretty fun too. However the one opened this year is better in my opinion, and it replaced a pretty uncomfortable ride. The gemini is a classic, everyone loves a good race. And the one that's not a roller coaster but is really tall and drops you down (I can't remember the name) that one is scary as shit but leaves you wanting to go again. The raptor (if it's still there, I can't remember) is one of my personal favorites. It takes you for a lot of fun loops and flips while you're feet are dangling all over the place, it's pretty cool. Also, enjoy the 50s style diner! A lot of famous people have been through there, it's really neat. Hope this helps!"

AMA,3b89o7,mrklabb,1 point,Fri Jun 26 19:55:33 2015 UTC,I do take meds. I was on some pretty strong stuff before but had to stop. It was causing me to sleep all the time. Took over my life. Was not my real self for like 10 years.   I first realized i might have a problem when the doctors told me. Before that I was adamant that people were out to get me and didn't understand why no one would believe me. My parents and girlfriend took me to the hospital to speak to someone.
AMA,3b89o7,Mikmoo,1 point,Fri Jun 26 21:57:29 2015 UTC,How has the diagnosis and subsequent treatment impacted your personal and professional life?
AMA,3b89o7,mutantBaguette,3,Fri Jun 26 21:44:00 2015 UTC,"I had to take a leave from work last year (and I took one years ago). Things got worse a little for a bit there but I'm fine now. In hindsight i realize that it's really hard for me to make close friendships. My paranoia ends up causing me to sabotage the friendship. I can do my job fine, but I'm obsessed with getting fired or that my coworkers hate me. Which makes some days rough.  I stopped hanging out with my group of friends from when it first started. They never could understand it, plus they were bad for me anyways."

AMA,3b89o7,Disconnectedness,2,Fri Jun 26 21:44:18 2015 UTC,"I went to a day hospital program here in town. They helped me understand what I was going through and get my level of meds right. Then I've been seeing a psych ever since, but now it's only once every few months.  Talking to doctors and therapists helped. I stuck to friends I could trust and found new friends. The doctors suggested I tried Cognitive Behaviour Therapy but I never stuck with it. Buddhism and Meditation has helped a lot to get rid of thoughts running through my head over and over."

AMA,3b89o7,MuricanMaid,1 point,Fri Jun 26 22:10:03 2015 UTC,Are you asking if I was paranoid of the doctor?  It has taken me a long time to identify what is paranoia and what is real. Sometimes people are assholes and it's not in your head. Most of the time it's not as bad as what i'm assuming though.
AMA,3b89o7,cabbage_claw,1 point,Fri Jun 26 22:14:53 2015 UTC,"Yes, were you paranoid about the doctor? Was it easy to trust him (and his diagnostic)?"
AMA,3b89o7,cabbage_claw,2,Fri Jun 26 22:38:37 2015 UTC,"For a while I was. If you have no reason to be suspicious, like with total strangers, the paranoia isn't as bad. At one point I didn't even trust my dad and other family members."

I'm sure she'd have to stick to the abstinence line because that's the only one permitted by the Bible and she's still wearing her Christianity on her sleeve."

All of these are discovered through the use of transducers and  transceivers. The transducers send out a sound wave through the water, and the transceiver picks up the return echo, and based on the echo return time a picture can be seen.  It is also used in the oil & gas industry to locate new reservoirs of both commodities. As well as new ventures such as underwater mining."

AMA,3b8wej,Demonicblanket,1 point,Sun Jun 28 00:04:34 2015 UTC,"It's definitely not fair to my kids, and it's not something that I ever want to put them through.   In the past 8 years I have only gone of my meds twice that caused any kind of issues. Once I was out of town for 6 weeks without my family, and the other time I'm not even sure why I wasn't taking them.   The way I deal with things is to mostly just try to be conscious of how I am acting and just try to be the best parent I can be. I know I'm not the best and sometimes I'm an asshole to my family, but at least they are understanding and they have stuck with me. Especially my wife, she could have easily left me at any moment and probably would have a much easier life, but she loves me and I'm pretty sure she will always be there for me."

It breaks my heart because most children there have such a terrible life ahead of them...not to mention americans are banned from adoption since a few years ago.

AMA,3b3clm,Basdad,3,Thu Jun 25 19:25:02 2015 UTC,"I would agree with that. But the issue is that that is not a priority as it should it be. The disparity between rich and poor is much higher there, and alcoholism is everywhere (the stats are ridiculous) so there's not as many families that can raise them healthy. The quality of life, funding and assistance in school would be a wonderful start! But yes, the usa's foster care system isn't perfect either and that needs to be a focus too, here families are literally paid to take the kids and there seem to be many ""parents"" who are given the green light when they can't even support themselves"

AMA,3b3clm,Donna_N,4,Thu Jun 25 19:34:55 2015 UTC,"Putin said he wanted to keep ""Russian pride"" and not have people from Russia influenced by america, which is not well-liked there. Severing that connection was also a move to distance themselves from us more since tensions are high. I don't know a lot about Kalmykia besides them causing more tension there. The kalmyks are so different from the rest of Russia though, it's more the issue of taking land if they seek independence (think about Crimea and how it ""rightfully belongs"" in Russia's hands) that could cause conflict...if they were more central I can see it being a bigger issue"
AMA,3b3clm,cherokehall,1 point,Thu Jun 25 20:44:09 2015 UTC,"This ban on Russian / US adoption came about after the incident where American adoptive parents sent their ""dysfunctional"" adopted child back to Russia.

AMA,3b3clm,vkashen,3,Fri Jun 26 00:00:57 2015 UTC,"I am much better at speaking than writing. I didn't have the chance to learn the full language with writing and grammar rules but my new family would put me in play dates with another kid also from russia. The only reason I've lost some of it is because of the lack of someone to practice with. My family highly encourages me but when I was younger I wasn't as intent on maintaining it. Usually it feels very natural speaking because I don't have to think about what something translates to like I have to with english or a new language. As long as I listen to it in music or voice I can easily switch back and forth. My written russian is elementary, it's able to get by but fluency is my priority."
AMA,3b3clm,HitlerWasASexyMofo,2,Fri Jun 26 00:24:56 2015 UTC,"But you've been in the US for 15 years and left Russia at 5, you mentioned, so at this point, isn't English easier and your default as you've been here during most of your formative years?

I speak english, french (parisian french and quebecois, as I lived in quebec), and swedish, though at this point I thin I've spoken english more than any other language, so even though it's my second language, I think I speak english the best (I majored in it at uni as well). So........  I totally understand what you are saying. :) It's funny how one starts out translating in the mind and then one day it clicks and you don't realize you can think in another language.

I described in earlier posts how most of the other orphans have illnesses and especially tragic stories to why they are there. The kids were abandoned at different ages, picked off the street, or their parents had died.  All the clothes and toys were worn out and the time was unstructured. The people running it were very kind and I could tell that they care about the kids. I had a couple friends then and don't know if theyve made it and where they are now but pray for them.

I was confronted by security as I exited the store (wal-mart), brought in the back room and the police were called. I actually played this one off smooth as fuck, if I do say so myself. I lied my ass of and said that friends were daring me to fill a cart with random stuff and then ditch it outside the store. I was let off with a warning.   The second time I got caught was in a grocery store, I had hidden something for some reason, I wasn't thinking about it I guess. They saw me on the cameras.

AMA,3b3osm,XxGamingTownxX,14,Thu Jun 25 19:13:48 2015 UTC,You just walk out with it and make sure no one notices.   Explain more please. The alarms did not go off? Did you only get items you knew would set off the alarm? Orrr did you just run for it when they went off?
AMA,3b3osm,ManboyFancy,14,Thu Jun 25 19:31:53 2015 UTC,"I worked at a major chain before, and you'd be surprised how often this happens.  If it's busy and the thief calmly walks out, instead of running, a lot of employees won't even realize what's happening.  After working there long enough the sound of those pillar alarms going off just becomes a nuisance.   You aren't allowed to chase shoplifters.  It isn't your money, and you're not allowed to do anything about it anyway.  Most of the time you just glance in the direction of the alarm to see if anything crazy is happening and then move on with your day."
AMA,3b3osm,ManboyFancy,13,Thu Jun 25 19:53:55 2015 UTC,"I have never had alarms go off on me, mostly because I wouldn't take items that were heavily guarded. If i did want something that had security measure I would just remove it before leaving."

Pretty astonishing once you think about it. He started at a Dick's Sporting Goods Store where he could steal $300 worth of stuff in sports performance apparel just about every Tuesday. Then he would go to Banana Republic, Walmart, Target, Gordmans,  Best Buy, etc. (you name it he probably went there). His favorite night was Black Friday because he could steal about one grand in one hostile night going store to store. Some of the bigger things he took were $300 Oakleys, and I know they lock them up in glass cases but that didn't phase him, he always had a way. He had a natural talent for stealing and blending in with others so he gradually became more and more addicted to stealing. The irony of the story is.... we decided to room together in college and halfway through the first semester he was caught at Walmart for the first time for stealing some lousy $2 glow in the dark stars for our dorm room.... can you believe that?!?! He ended up having to pay walmart $100 and that was that. He hasn't stolen like in the past ever since. Just wanted to share that you wernt alone in the klepto world!"

So both girlfriends that I have had were understanding of that and actually let me live my life where as I find that some girlfriends want to spend every moment they can with their boyfriends (my friends relationships are like this).  I never though about puberty and development... I guess I was affected in some ways. One thing my friends ask me about or bring up is the fact that I never go out and hook up with random girls, and get wasted every weekend. They kind of emphasize the fact that I haven't lived my youth to the fullest as I should have. I am not sure if it is because of the 10 years of being in a relationship, but I literally have no desire to go out and get really drunk or party or do anything stupid.

If you had the level of introspection you're trying to come at me with you wouldn't have even made the original post in the first place.   What you're describing is at best puppy love, not a relationship. You don't know what a relation is until you and another person have to deal with life together on your own. 21 makes you old enough to drink, it doesn't automatically grant you the experience or wisdom of being an actual adult. Neither of the two of you have even fully figured out who you are. Even if you didn't break up I promise you it wouldn't have lasted to the age of 25.

All of them started out as happy kids, but as they hit their teens they began abusing substances, self-harming, going out with shitty people and doing sketchy things, acting crazy to other people at odd times, etc..  Still, the most prevailing aspect out of all of these was this strange need to see other people as trying to ""get them"" or ""fuck them over"" and would concoct stories about how this other person wanted to take something from them, or disenfranchise them in some way. It was the thing that caused me to have to leave, because being accused of really unpleasant things is unacceptable to me.  I guess my question is, do you have a similar tendency to see other people as predatory or abusive even when they're not? And if yes, do you know when the accusations in your mind are made up, or do they seem completely real to you in that moment? I guess I'm just trying to understand the mindset that's behind this part of BPD.   Thanks for your time."
AMA,3b5x1z,funkengruven88,2,Fri Jun 26 19:02:24 2015 UTC,"Sure.  I'm sorry you had to deal with that. It's unpleasant for everyone. That's why awareness and compassionate understanding is key.  Yes, it's part of the famous ""I hate you...don't leave me!"" thing. It's a subconscious attempt to protect from getting hurt so it's a pushing away only leading to feelings of abandonment. (Which most people frantically try to avoid. Basically, the way I see it, people with BPD haven't matured/developed emotionally. It's like a person on extremes of a situation. Seeing things as black and white, difficult to see the grey area in between situations."

AMA,3b5x1z,cupcake601,1 point,Fri Jun 26 06:56:12 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry you experience similar symptoms.  I'm not a mental health professional or suggesting anyone self diagnose but to raise awareness here is a bit from nami.org:  Symptoms People with BPD experience wide mood swings and can display a great sense of instability and insecurity. Signs and symptoms may include:  Frantic efforts to avoid being abandoned by friends and family. Unstable personal relationships that alternate between idealization—“I’m so in love!”—and devaluation—“I hate her.” This is also sometimes known as ""splitting."" Distorted and unstable self-image, which affects moods, values, opinions, goals and relationships. Impulsive behaviors that can have dangerous outcomes, such as excessive spending, unsafe sex, substance abuse or reckless driving. Suicidal and self-harming behavior. Periods of intense depressed mood, irritability or anxiety lasting a few hours to a few days. Chronic feelings of boredom or emptiness. Inappropriate, intense or uncontrollable anger—often followed by shame and guilt. Dissociative feelings—disconnecting from your thoughts or sense of identity, or “out of body” type of feelings—and stress-related paranoid thoughts. Severe cases of stress can also lead to brief psychotic episodes.  The problem with borderline and substance abuse is that substances are used to self medicate which end up exasperating some symptoms such as anxiety and depression and then it's just a horrid cycle from there."

AMA,3b55tu,cpadm,1 point,Fri Jun 26 01:49:05 2015 UTC,"1) I'd rather not say the name of my startup, as I could be giving various details regarding our financial arrangements. As much as I'd like to promote it, I hope you'll forgive me for that. We are a sports technology company.  2) I have a wife and a 2.5 year old. My partners also have families, and we're all above 30. I saved 6 months expenses.  3) In my area, it was difficult to find people willing to invest on an idea. They wanted to see proven revenue. In my dealings with investors, I have found that this is common in the south and east coast. West coast and Texas investors are much more willing to bank on an idea and the promise of large returns.  Our first investment came in the form of a 75k convertible note with a call date of 6 months out. We were pre-revenue at that time, so the 75k carried with it a personal guarantee from the founders. Meaning we would have to personally pay the loan back from our own pockets at the call date.  4) 3 months later, we completed our first angel round of 500k. The 75k note converted into equity. The 500k is a mix of equity and debt. The initial 75k holder and the angel both received preferred stock, whereas myself and the other founders hold common stock."

This is mainly used to keep us out of the bite zone, but it also comes in handy to keep their head still. We put a loop around their neck and adjust the height of it so that theres little slack, which keeps the dogs head up. If the dog is especially unruly or fidgety, we'll attach that to the hook in front of it so that it really has no choice but to keep it's head up and looking forward.

You need to find a place that is fairly cheap but not crap and a low security deposit. I would suggest go to some apartment complexes around a college because they normally have low security deposits, that come furnished, and they would find a roommate for you. If that appears to be working out normally you can ask them if they have any work for you (the apartments) they can line you up with maintenance or collect rent with decent pay. (Maybe a discount on rent as well). As far a food the apartments can help with that too they sometimes carry coupons for local places that are trying to get their name out there.

I have noticed that there are things I think about fitting into my future as a woman that men don't have to consider (childbirth being a big one).  My personal experience has been very good in regards to engineering, though I have found that sometimes older male mentors tend to take me less seriously or cut me more slack as they seem to expect less. But I've also had some wonderful mentors who were great at encouraging everyone. I guess if there is anything bad, to be a woman in engineering you do have to develop a tolerance for guys saying foolish things that can sometimes cross the lines of appropriateness.

AMA,3azjfx,whatdowegot34,3,Wed Jun 24 20:24:07 2015 UTC,"It's pretty cut throat but we are not paid on commission. Instead we have to meet certain ""expectations"" or we lose our job.

AMA,3azjfx,forshiggles,2,Wed Jun 24 20:45:46 2015 UTC,"Do most students end up getting grants or do they take out loans? Do you feel bad when they take out loans? Do you tell them inflated figures about how much money they will make with their certificates? What state are you in? I always wondered why these people do this to themselves when community college is free (in California), but I think it may be more expensive in other states."
AMA,3azjfx,whatdowegot34,3,Wed Jun 24 23:27:29 2015 UTC,"98% of the students I work with end up using Financial Aid which is a combination of loans and the Pell Grant. It is based on need, and the demographic I work with is largely unemployed or working minimum wage so most qualify for it.  I do feel bad sometimes, especially if I have doubts about their ability to complete. However, in my experience, it's the students I have the most doubt about that do the best and the confident people that end up screwing themselves over.   We are monitored for compliance so I do not inflate the figures. Those types of practices were rampant 5 years ago.   We offer accredited degrees but I can't be sure that they will find a position. Regular State Universities don't make any guarantees either.   I do not wish to say what State I am in, but states that offer tax incentives for this type of industry include: Florida, Colorado, Arizona, and California as far as I'm aware.  some people want the easy fix and they think online will be easy, some people have such busy lives and going online is the only option, some work and need online because of that. Yeah community college is cheaper but the people I deal with are largely uninformed or already have a bad relation with their local CC because they already attempted that and were kicked out or owe them money."

AMA,3b0uv0,robofat,2,Thu Jun 25 01:48:39 2015 UTC,Did you commit yourself? Or did you have a significant drug/alcohol problem? Depression?
AMA,3b0uv0,cwaz1212,5,Thu Jun 25 02:55:53 2015 UTC,"That is a long story, but I think it would be a long story for anyone who ends up in a psych unit. I was in college at the time, and I had initially been diagnosed as having Asperger Syndrome, which I think in the new DSM is just High Functioning Autism. From that point on, I was on Zoloft for years for severe social anxiety/phobias, tics, and depression. It dulled everything and made me not care about working on anything besides academics in high school, so I didn't develop great social skills or even a desire to maintain connections with other humans.   I went off to a university, and I soon began cycling between very high highs and very low lows. I didn't even know what I was feeling, since I had never had it very much before. I wasn't taking any other drugs or even drinking at all, and some days I would literally feel colors jumping out at me, I thought people were praising me in their heads (don't ask), I had infinite energy, and I would get these bursts of energy and felt like I could do anything. Then soon after the days would come when I couldn't go to sleep even after strenuous exercise, tossing and turning for hours, paranoid I was being watched, etc. I spent an entire night in my dorm searching for cameras and took all my clothes off because I thought they had sensors embedded in them. I became convinced someone was plotting to harm me, and I kept hearing all these noises that would go away as soon as I would start looking for them. Then everything felt dark, and I felt like everyone was whispering about me, and I felt isolated and alone and scared, and I barely had enough energy to keep my eyes open.  After a few weeks of this developing, full-on psychosis started up, and I was seeing all kinds of things, like dead people hanging in my room telling me I was next, people whispering in my ear who weren't there, etc, and I got immensely depressed. Some traumatic experiences from my past also started to manifest in my paranoia and hallucinations. I called my parents and told them everything was terrible and I didn't know what I could do, and I felt alone and trapped. They called the campus police, since this was odd behavior for me. I am generally a reserved person, and I hate attracting attention to myself usually.  That night I went off into a tall building and climbed to the top of it. I swore to myself I was going to jump off, and I left a rambling forty-minute audio suicide note about why I needed to do this, and I felt it was justified. I obviously chickened out, and so I went down into one of the office floors and went into an office. I just started to slam my head into the floor over and over, trying to get all this shit out of my head. I felt like I was going to explode, and I had a panic attack that lasted about an hour, as I drifted in and out of consciousness. I finally also called the campus police, who brought me to a hospital. I went there, got a benzodiazepine (Xanax, I believe) and was on my way.   I was ushered into the counseling center there, and the guy there really wanted to get rid of me, continuing to tell me to tell him I wasn't going to harm myself. I am not an idiot, and I knew that if I told him no, I would probably be committed. I had no energy left, I was miserable, and I honestly wanted to die. I just told him to go fuck himself, and that I would do whatever I wanted. They called my family members, and they agreed to not involuntarily commit me if I promised to voluntarily admit myself to a psych ward, so that is how I ended up committing myself.  I'm sorry if this is too long, but, then again, I said it would be a long story :P."
AMA,3b0uv0,bob-leblaw,4,Thu Jun 25 03:18:26 2015 UTC,Some things are worthy of long stories.  This is one.  How are you doing now?
AMA,3b0uv0,cwaz1212,5,Thu Jun 25 03:36:28 2015 UTC,"That's very sweet of you to say. It has been about 1.5 years from when that story took place. I went to over five psychiatrists and a few psychologists, trying to find the perfect balance between psychotherapy and pharmacological therapy. Honestly, psychology is a total minefield. Some people are great at it, some people are terrible at it, and some psychologists are unfortunately downright malevolent.   I went from seeing a psychiatrist twice a week and shifting medicines every few weeks (tried approximately 40 different medicines, can list in a later post) to now, when I have been on two medicines at the same doses for almost a year now, with psychiatrist visits every three months.   I still really do struggle, mostly with fighting social anxiety that I developed over all the years I squirreled myself away with the help of Zoloft and whatever other psychiatric and/or psychological problems I was fighting, and I still get bouts of depression and mild hypomania, but I prefer to be a bit undermedicated than to feel like a zombie.  I am happy to say that I am preparing to go back to a university this Fall and have been attaining credits towards a Comp Sci degree consistently, even during my hospitalizations; I have held a steady part-time (20-30hr/week) job for several months, and I am regularly getting out and playing sports and interacting with people much more than I ever have before."
AMA,3b0uv0,cwaz1212,1 point,Thu Jun 25 03:59:38 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I needed to hear that. Especially, ""I'm obviously not trying to kill myself."" I think about it a lot but I'm never going to be able to go through with it.."
AMA,3b0uv0,suigenic,2,Thu Jun 25 04:17:12 2015 UTC,"I believe that, for about four years, I couldn't go an hour or two awake without envisioning and even romanticizing suicide. I think it makes sense to have those sorts of thoughts if you are depressed, even if you do not want to die, because it has a unique finality that nobody but you can give yourself. It gives you a feeling of power when you feel like there is no other power source.  The one dead end I would always come to would be when I was envisioning my life completely terminating at my own hands. I imagined how I would feel, and I sincerely believe that, in my last few moments, I would feel even more alone and desperate than I ever had before.   I had to contemplate what I wanted out of my existence on this Earth. I had felt like I meant nothing; from being sexually abused at an early age to being mocked because of a stuttering problem I had to being marginalized for not thinking like most other people, I thought I was some shit societal reject and I would end up killing myself some day, when the pain got too great.  When I was in a locked psych unit, I got a chance to really think things through. I realized that I wanted my existence to be based on validating other people's existences. Sort of like that Robin Williams quote that eludes me, I think very sad people try to make other people feel better because they know how it is to feel like shit, and they don't want anyone else to ever go through that. That's why I try to reach out whenever I can to people who are hurting.  Oddly, the one quote that sticks out to me from a nurse who was talking with me was: ""You know that from its beginning, this Earth has been filled with pain, suffering, and misery. And you know why? Because the Earth is full of hurt people. And what do hurt people do? They hurt other people.""  It might seem pedantic, but it has helped me when I have felt low."

AMA,3b38nc,sicnimmons,2,Thu Jun 25 17:01:31 2015 UTC,"The best way is to never get there in the first place.

But, if you didn't do that, and now you're in the ""friend zone"" you need to break free of that. Compliment her, flirt with her, ask her out to lunch (specify just the two of us), smile more and initiate light physical contact."

Your goal is to get the government to give you what YOU want out of fear of backlash I.e. ""We'll take our ball and go home.""   You need to realize that this nation is built up of multiple ideas, and is a democracy. So if the majority of people want something done then that something is more likely to happen. In this case the majority of people want that flag off the Capitols. There's no government interference here, there's state governments listening to their people and giving them what they want.

To be fair, I know some people who buy into that who really aren't racist (or are just super in the closet about it to the point where I can't tell). I know because I used to be one of them. I never had anything against black people, I knew that slavery and segregation were bad thing, but that's what I was told the Confederate Flag meant while growing up. It's the same way for a lot of people. It was towards the end of high school and during my time in college that my opinion about the Confederate Flag (and the Civil War in general) changed. For one thing, the flag was first placed on the state house in 1962 in direct response to the Civil Rights Movement, not at the end of Reconstruction like I thought. I also began to see the Civil War for what it was. I learned early on that it really was about slavery. Yes, there were other issues but that was the main one. Also the average southerner had nothing to gain from the war. They would always be ""poor white trash"" in the eyes of the wealthy plantation owners. After that, it was only used by hate groups like the KKK, not regular southerners.  I'm also against it for practical reasons. Tourism is actually a big part of our economy but I'm sure many people are hesitant about visiting because of the flag. Both the NAACP and NCAA have boycotts on the state. There's a long list reasons but I think you get the idea.  As for other people's opinions on it, I'll try to answer as best as I can but I've been out of the country for a while so I don't know how people are feeling in light of recent events. I can tell you that two years ago, there was a small and vocal minority for it and against it and a lot of apathetic people in between. Apathy naturally favors the status quo. Occasionally the argument would flare up but most people looked at it as a special interest group on one side of the issue or the other trying to make headlines. Part of it is just obstinance. For some, it's not so much that they support the flag but they don't like being told what to do. Fortunately it seems like the apathetic people aren't so apathetic anymore and our elected officials are starting to agree on it. It will likely be put to a statewide vote.

AMA,3b08oz,I_Suport_The_Flag,3,Wed Jun 24 22:43:38 2015 UTC,Why do you support a symbol that stands for anti-union of the United States and the right to own slaves?
AMA,3b08oz,Justchill87,1 point,Wed Jun 24 23:02:51 2015 UTC,I do not entirely support what it stands for. I am not a racist or some one who wants a all white society. I believe that the flag stands for more than just that. Many southern people see it a a sign of heritage i see it as a way for people to demonstrate freedom of expression and i believe that it should not be taken away because of this. Many people can not get past the fact it was used in a multitude of racist movements and see it as a sign of hate. I think that it has very little to do with racism in present day and it is used more as a sign of heritage and in the case of monumental use and sign to show respect to fallen soldiers who should not be forgotten no matter the side they were fighting on.

Many british soldiers fought and died on the losing side of an American war.  How come we dont fly British flags to honor thier dead?  The swastika stood as a symbol of peace for thousands of years.  Would you support a swastika flag flying over a capitol building?"
AMA,3b08oz,yugtahtmi,1 point,Wed Jun 24 23:21:36 2015 UTC,I do not think it should be flown at the capital building but i do think it should be flown at fallen soldiers monument and other locations that are memorials to southern soldiers. And about the swastika that in my opinion is not even in the same ballpark as the confederate flag because the swastika was associated with something much more brutal and horrifying then the civil war. I also must state i do not think slavery wasn't bad in fact i think its awful but as i stated before the flag does not entirely stand for slavery. It also stands for rebellion yes but are we not we a nation founded on this philosophy? The reason people can protest the flag is one of the same things the flag represents.

AMA,3b08oz,Vandredd,1 point,Wed Jun 24 23:04:44 2015 UTC,It's not really about freedom of speech though.  It's about government buildings flying an anti-union flag.  It just doesn't make sense.  Leave in to the private world or museums and the like.

AMA,3au21j,dreamscapejanitor,3,Tue Jun 23 20:09:05 2015 UTC,"Not OP, but since he seems to have flaked on answering, I did the reading and I can explain it, I'm fairly certain: the sounds the larval stage of the weevil makes as it's munching on a tree are fairly rhythmic, and within a certain frequency range. So basically you attach a directional microphone to the tree, and then the app boosts the volume on the frequencies you would expect to hear crunching at. You compare what you're hearing to a pre-recorded larval munching sound, and if it sounds the same then you've got weevils, and you can treat the tree and kill them before they mature. Basically, it's a smart-stethoscope."

AMA,3au21j,DiscoYou,2,Wed Jun 24 20:36:23 2015 UTC,"Sorry for the late reply. We first looked at what frequencies are generated when the Larvae crunch the fibre. There are different frequency bands, but they come in certain periods. So, we pick only those frequencies and amplify. But it is not that easy, because a lot of other sound sources like water transportation up the trunk, activity of bees, and twisting sound of the trunk in wind also generate frequencies in the same range. Then we do another trick, that is to familiarize the farmer with a pure sound track taken in ideal conditions. This helps them to identify the Larvae activity even in a corrupt signal."
AMA,3au21j,Feartape,5,Wed Jun 24 20:34:36 2015 UTC,How does what you say in your OP pertain to bioinformatics?
AMA,3au21j,Feartape,3,Wed Jun 24 00:08:10 2015 UTC,"Obligatory not OP, but reading the site he linked, the bioinformatics comes in with how the device works. It hones in on the frequencies that are produced by the larva when they eat the wood of the tree, and is able to isolate them and amplify just those sounds, instead of everything else that goes on in a noisy jungle environment."

AMA,3au21j,gunju11,3,Tue Jun 23 22:38:14 2015 UTC,"Reading about it, I can pretty well answer since the OP doesn't seem terribly interested in doing so. The $60 device is a complete unit; the $10 app is just the sensor that attaches to a spartphone, which does the processing in place of the dedicated CPU in the $60 unit. Apparently, according to the linked video, smartphone's are in the hands of 97% of Sri Lankan's, so it's a viable solution.  As far as how it works... If I'm correct in my reading, the sounds the larval stage of the weevil makes as it's munching on a tree are fairly rhythmic, and within a certain frequency range. So basically you attach a directional microphone to the tree, and then the app boosts the volume on the frequencies you would expect to hear crunching at. You compare what you're hearing to a pre-recorded larval munching sound, and if it sounds the same then you've got weevils, and you can treat the tree and kill them before they mature.

At the time I was a manager at a convenience store called Wawa and I couldn't do it anymore but still wanted to work so I brought him the idea of me going solo and doing it for money, instead of fun like we were. Afterms discussing it, assuring him that nothing could impede on our relationship, and after him realizing that it really is just another job and people seeing what they already know I have isn't a big deal, I started.  However, masturbating and just being sexual in general for 4 hours 5 days a week has taken a small toll. My sex drive is much lower and for a while he felt as if I was no longer attracted to him because of it. So to remedy that, I've become much more vocal about my attraction towards him, we set aside time daily just for us to be intimate (which isn't always easy with a 1 year old) even if it's just cuddling."

Outside of really amazing nights as far as money goes, the best experiences have been all the friends I've made. I normally separate clients/toppers and friends though, so I'm speaking of other performers. It's really such an accepting, supportive community and I never dreamed of meeti MG such strong, beautiful women.  I've had quite a few bad experiences but I had one regular who happened to bump into me back when I was still working at Wawa, when I first started camming. I did decently, but I was new, still soft spoken and I wanted to do well so I could quit my job, and because of that I made the mistake of having a very blurred line as far as limits went. This guy took advantage of that usually, but even more so once he knew where to find me in person. He started harassing me at work, he would talk to coworkers to see if they knew where I was on my days off. He would find out where I was and interrupt my husband and I. I ended up having to get a restraining order that he fought tooth and nail, swearing he never meant me any harm, that I was overreacting. He even tried saying I was a prostitute to get me in legal trouble, which didn't hold any kind of water when I explained exactly what I do.   I don't know what happened to him. I never see him around anywhere, which is good. But it got really terrifying for a while and I was pretty sure my husband was going to kill him. A few times I had to hold my husband back when he approached us in public."

AMA,3avw8x,Stumpzzz,1 point,Tue Jun 23 22:44:24 2015 UTC,"I believe that the benefits were plentiful, in my case. I know that for some people HS might be a horrible time, but it was great in my case. People tend to assume that girls are catty, but we really weren't. I have a distinct memory shadowing my school and feeling this click inside of my chest like I knew I belonged. We were given an open learning environment, and weren't limited in any capacity. I never felt like I couldn't play certain sports or take certain classes due to being embarrassed at being ""the only girl"".   It was my choice indeed. I went to private (religious) schools from the time I was 3 years old, but going to an all girls school was definitely my choice. I applied to three different schools, and had my choice between them but ended up choosing the all girls one (the other two were co-ed)."

I, myself, wasn't much into boys in high school. My group of friends didn't worry about them. We usually hung out together and did things that way. However, if we wanted to meet boys there were a few ways. Up until my junior year (sadly, they shut down after that), we had a brother school (completely different schools, but we shared mixers with them sometimes) and you could meet boys that way. My school didn't have a lot of money, so we shared a track with them. You could sneak to the track after school to meet them if really wanted to. Otherwise, you'd just meet guys around your neighborhood or if you did outside activities."

For example, lewy body is the second most common type of dementia that effects mostly the frontal lobe resulting in loss of motor skills such as talking, and so on."

How do you think I got so good at fixing up your clothes? Yet you still rip your jeans up like some punk--and your grandma, Grandma Rita, fixed up my hair all nice. I never wore makeup but I did put some rouge on, just for that night. So I go there, to the prom, and I'm dancing with my girlfriends and am having a great time. Well, what do you know but word gets out that my date's upset that I'm not putting out enough. Huh! So you know what I do? You know what I do, Donna?

AMA,3arkic,thisisaonetimeoffer,3,Mon Jun 22 23:38:54 2015 UTC,"First of all thank you for asking a question that relates to my department!  It depends on where it is going/what size you had before/what you are watching. If you had a 32"" before that was 7 years old and you don't have the space for anything bigger you could get a 39/40"" and it would take the same amount of space because of the bezel.  If space isn't an issue then I'd recommend going for something larger like a 40. Manufacturers don't tend to focus on making the smaller ones good because they won't get a lot of money in return for it. If you get a 40 I'd recommend Sony' new range as they run on Android and are the best TVs out there imo. However if you do want a 32 go for a Samsung T31D310 it's £199.   I also recommend not going into the shop to buy but do it online so you don't get caught up in trying to be sold all the rubbish under the sun"

I think my family sence there is something cus I become agnostic after deep study .  For example and not a lot of people know that -even muslims-Mohammed said if we see a black-eyed dog we must kill it cus it is the devil ! Not to mention we should not have any in house cus angles dont enter a house where a dog in it. I love animals so i just change the subject whenever one of my family  talk about dogs .  Some of my sisters and my brother suspect of that Im not muslim so they keep spaming links about how Islam is great and I just ignore them . One of my weapons is that I like the posts that criticize islam but not in direct way  Another thing my brother loves eating dates , so once he told me that it very usefull blah blah blah so I was like ""ok you can eat poison and not die ? Nice "" cus it another thing Mohammed said 😆"

AMA,3arpf1,Kevincav,2,Mon Jun 22 23:47:22 2015 UTC,"I had put in my 2 week notice last week a couple weeks ago and Wednesday was going to be my last day. Everything was going good until I got to work today. Friday night before I left for the night I told the manager that I wouldn't be able to work Sunday (Father's Day) I had told her that I've asked every one that I could or knew to ask and they all said they couldn't but that I also won't be able to work even tho I'm scheduled. So I show up today and another manager calls me into the office and starts asking me why I wasn't there yesterday and I told him that I had already told someone that I wasn't going to be there and that I had tried to cover it but I didn't know what else to do and he starts telling me that it's a ""no call no show"" because nobody was there at the scheduled time and it's my responsibility even tho I told someone. We start going back and forth about who's right and during all this the manager that I told on Friday is just sitting there picking her fingers and didn't say a word. I walked out of the office grabbed my crap and left."
AMA,3arpf1,irivanho,30,Tue Jun 23 00:04:14 2015 UTC,You were scheduled and didn't show up. You're in the wrong here.
AMA,3arpf1,_Aggort,15,Tue Jun 23 05:13:16 2015 UTC,Right? I read it thinking something else was going to happen.  You can't just tell someone you're not going to show up for a shift or that you don't want to work one.
AMA,3arpf1,Firefoxray,11,Tue Jun 23 06:21:15 2015 UTC,"Yeah, just because it's a minor holiday doesn't mean you can just skip out on work. The other employees who could take his shift probably were out with their fathers cause they put it in weeks in advance. If you want a day off, you have to click it in about a week or two before going on it?, nor a day before"
AMA,3arpf1,SlothOfDoom,23,Tue Jun 23 08:50:01 2015 UTC,I had put in my 2 week notice last week a couple weeks ago   Wut.

AMA,3arpf1,_Aggort,3,Tue Jun 23 04:44:34 2015 UTC,Are you implying your former employer was in the wrong here?
AMA,3arpf1,Firefoxray,-6,Tue Jun 23 06:20:33 2015 UTC,"My main argument is that they had 2 days notice that I wouldn't be there and they didn't do anything to cover my shift after I already tried. Isn't it their job to make sure everything runs smoothly? If someone told me Friday night they aren't going to be there for their Sunday shift I would do what I had to do to cover it because that's my job as a manager. I would not just ignore the heads up wait until Sunday and scramble last minute to find someone,that's just dumb. I was trying to be professional and courteous in giving them a heads up and they did nothing and ended up screwing themselves and then yell at me about it when I show up for my next shift."
AMA,3arpf1,Firefoxray,9,Tue Jun 23 08:25:33 2015 UTC,"But they told you that their was no spots available and you still left and took the day. Your in the wrong here. So tip, if your gonna have a day off, reserve if a week in advance to iron out all the problems, not two days"
AMA,3arpf1,JonWesHarding,-1,Tue Jun 23 08:51:31 2015 UTC,"Had I known before that I would have told them sooner. Other employees call literally minutes before their shift saying they aren't showing up and the managers make calls and figure it out no problem but when I did it with 2 days advance its a problem. His demeanor towards me had changed since I put in my notice and I think that's why it ended up the way it did, because I was quitting to begin with so him being an asshole to me until I left had no negative effects. He is literally the only person that I've worked for that has ignored the fact that somebody said they aren't going to be able to work a shift and then flip out when they don't show up."
AMA,3arpf1,JonWesHarding,2,Tue Jun 23 09:11:19 2015 UTC,So everybody but you gets to reserve a shift. Yeah I'm not buying it.
AMA,3arpf1,_Aggort,1 point,Tue Jun 23 16:30:24 2015 UTC,"I'm not trying to be rude, but you shouldn't feel wronged in any way. You had a professional duty. You chose to disobey that duty for your own reasons. I've called in sick for work when I'm on my way out the door plenty of times, but I don't disrespect my boss for doing his job and managing me. He has a right and a duty to inquire.  I imagine once you put in your two weeks they started monitoring you a bit more to see if you did anything crazy. They do that, just to make sure. They know that people slack/stop caring/steal/etc when they're quitting soon, so that's likely why you got the impression that his attitude towards you changed. Not showing up and suggesting that they should have had the brains to cover it wasn't a wise move in terms of professional respect (you still want a good reference). If they have to call someone at the very last minute, it's usually at great cost to them (incentive for person coming in, overtime as it usually puts a person over their hours, and depending where you work/live there are financial and legal ramifications for making someone work more than hired for)."
AMA,3arpf1,Kevincav,1 point,Wed Jul 1 03:21:32 2015 UTC,"Overtime there isn't an issue (""full time"" to them means 25 hours) so the issue is that the manager I told didn't tell the opening manager. People ""call out"" all the time the night before and the managers say okay and get it covered for them. This was the first time i ""called out"" and they didn't do anything when I had given them a full day to figure it out.   In regards to people slacking once they know there last days are coming up I agree that some people do. But I was putting things in place and training people on what I was doing to make sure they were up to speed when I left. I feel I was doing more work towards the end then I was the rest of the time.   In the end people will have their opinions on whether what I did was right or wrong if everyone was there and saw or heard what had happened I think people's opinions would change in one way or another. I've been working for almost 10 years and have never had this kind of problem, they were mad when I put in my two weeks because they were already short staffed and struggling. Almost everyone from the original hiring staff had quit aside from I think 2 people. Management there just sucks overall and they are all on power trips (management has changed several times in the 7 months they've been open)."
AMA,3arpf1,Kevincav,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:51:30 2015 UTC,"Absolutely,  and I respect your opinion (after all, I don't even know where you work or what kind of business), I was just playing devil's advocate to see if it added any clarity. I almost always take a day or two off when I know that I'm leaving,  but I just don't get upset if I'm coached on it because I consciously made the decision. Best of luck with your next/current job!"
AMA,3arpf1,Kevincav,5,Wed Jul 1 17:20:50 2015 UTC,"It is not their responsibility to find a replacement for you,  it's yours.  They did assure things would run smoothly,  they scheduled you to work and as far as I can tell your only reasoning for wanting off is the same reason most others would want to as well,  yet you seem to think you were more important.   You don't get to just tell an employer when you can and can't work,  you can certainly request dates,  but it seems like you demanded a date too close to needing it off.   They didn't put themselves in the position you were in,  you did,  and without a doubt you no call no showed if you didn't call Sunday and call off at least. They could have handled it a little better,  yes,  but you were 100% in the wrong"

AMA,3ao542,HitlerWasASexyMofo,17,Mon Jun 22 15:13:19 2015 UTC,What is something you notice that non-black police officers don't notice?
AMA,3ao542,Eaton_Twot,40,Mon Jun 22 22:21:06 2015 UTC,"Um, I'm not sure really.    I sometimes feel like suspects think I'm going to side with them based on the fact that our skin color is similar."
AMA,3ao542,TA-93,14,Mon Jun 22 04:04:40 2015 UTC,Can you elaborate on this? Does anyone ever accuse you of being a sell-out or anything?
AMA,3ao542,iShootDope_AmA,54,Mon Jun 22 05:03:11 2015 UTC,I've been told that I'm just playing dress up with the white boys.
AMA,3ao542,underthesofa,19,Mon Jun 22 05:58:15 2015 UTC,that is fucked up
AMA,3ao542,underthesofa,7,Mon Jun 22 06:01:09 2015 UTC,"Well that was going to be my question. The classic NWA line is ""But don't let it be a black and a white one / 'Cause they'll slam you down to the street top / black po-lice showin' out for the white cop."" Have you ever felt any such pressure to prove your objective... non-racial-sympathy to white cops in that way? Are you aware of other black cops who have ever felt that pressure? Have you sensed any distrust from white cops that you won't do your job without bias? That you won't do it to 100%? That you will try to hold back from their level of enforcement out of a sense of broader allegiance with black perps? What can you say to the guys on the street who think that's the way it goes on the force and think that's the kind of pressure scenario you find yourself in and find yourself conforming to? If what they suspect is totally not the case, what would be your best argument/explanation to them about why it's not the case?  In general, how would you respond to black people who believe that a ""fuck the police"" stance is genuinely warranted based on how police interact with their community? Is that any different than what you'd say to any other race or sub-demographic?  On a tv show recently two cops were in the hood and found a kid with a gun that had been shot in the stomach, who initially pointed his gun at them, and the assumption in the show was that he was involved in gang activity. The one cop told the other to call an ambulance. The other cop was incredulous, saying an ambulance would never come to that area of town for a gunshot wound. So the other cop picked him up and put him in the cop car and they sped to the nearest hospital. The hospital initially said they wouldn't take him because they stopped taking gunshot victims because that overwhelming tide was draining their ability to provide care for every other type of patient in the hospital, and plus he was just a gang kid who was going to shoot more people anyway if he lived, possibly cops. This is fiction of course, but is there anything resembling any of those scenarios in real life?  What's the state of racial discrimination, if any, within the force where you are? Are there definite divisions in allegiance or does what you guys face basically overwhelm any of that like it would if you were pinned down in a trench together in a war? If you feel discriminated against, marginalized, distrusted, held down, etc., in what ways has it manifested?  As someone who has to be there when/after things go wrong, and possibly investigate the causes, what do you see as some of the top things that could be done to prevent crime, either via smart obstructions for people who want to commit crime or via changing things at the root so that fewer people want/need to commit? There's pie in the sky stuff about massive social change that's not going to happen anytime soon and then there are things we could implement more easily and quickly. What is some of the low-hanging fruit and maybe then what is some of the higher fruit? Anything innovative that nobody's really talking about?  You've mentioned the disparity between your area's demographic split and the demographic split in your jails and prisons. Black people make up a much higher percentage of the prison population there. In your observation, how much does that have to do with higher rates of offense vs. higher rates of conviction for the same offense? Are they there because they're committing the most crimes, or are there significant distortions in that formula, either at the enforcement targeting level or the judicial level?  There's race and then there's things like poverty, opportunity, education, household stability, neighborhood stability, etc. Do you see pretty much the same kinds of criminal patterns across races when they're poor, undereducated, underemployable, living in dangerous neighborhoods, etc? Or do you notice differences in the types and levels of crimes?  Sort of a mix of all of the above, how much do you ruminate through the lens of your job on what appears to be the troubled state of black people vis a vis law enforcement and the justice system as distinct from the state of other races? Does it make you sad, bitter, resentful, other? Do you feel any allegiance, either claimed or laid upon you? Do you have particular thoughts about it? Do you just do your job, a job that needs doing regardless of who the suspects/criminals are, and don't think too much about any broader social-cultural-racial analysis?  Race aside or not, if you haven't already answered this via one of the above questions, what's the #1 thing you wish you could make people understand about your situation as a cop? Like, what's the #1 way you or all cops catch shit for things that you wouldn't catch shit for if people just had to do your job for a day or a week or whatever? Everybody's an armchair quarterback about everything until they have to do it themselves, and then they see and they mostly shut up. And with cops the volume of the quarterbacking is really cranked up. In what ways are we wrong, ignorant, uniformed, stupid, unfair, unjust about your situation, either because we have it totally, ironically, and cruelly backwards or we just don't know because we can't really know unless we do it ourselves?"
AMA,3ao542,drfarren,9,Mon Jun 22 13:28:06 2015 UTC,I want to answer all of your questions. However I'm on mobile and doing my second job.   I love how well written and well thought out what you say is.    Is their any chance you can condense your post to just the questions and I will post my answers asap.   Thank you again
AMA,3ao542,Eaton_Twot,5,Mon Jun 22 15:04:44 2015 UTC,"Wow, it's almost like my post was... too long, meaning that people... didn't read it! If only there were a way to convey the same sentiment in a shorter message...  Well here's sort of a medium attempt. No need to answer this right away though, if that matters.   Have you or any other black cops you know ever felt pressure to ""show out for the white cops"" as NWA worded it? If not, how best can you explain to the guys on the street why that's really not the case? How would you respond to a black person who feels a ""fuck the police"" attitude is warranted based on the treatment they see? Is the answer different if the person isn't black? Will ambulances actually refuse to answer calls for gunshot wounds in gang-y hood areas like I saw in a fictional tv show? Will any hospitals refuse to treat gang-y gunshot victims because there are too many of them? If there is racial discrimination against black cops within the force where you are, how has it manifested? Given the crime you see, what are some of the most effective and practical things you think we could do as a society to stop or prevent crimes? Practical steps, worthwhile investments, intervention strategies, etc. Your area prisons are mostly black people despite a more even split in area demographics. Is this because they are committing more crimes or is it because they are targeted more or convicted more for the same crimes as nonblacks? If it's a combo, which is most responsible? In your observation, how much is crime a factor of poverty, education, opportunity, etc. irrespective of race? Said differently, are there different patterns of crime between poor communities of different races or does being poor etc. (if that's the cause) pretty much lead to the same kinds of stuff? As a black cop viewing the disproportionate involvement of blacks in the LE/legal/prison system, how does it make you feel? Do feel allegiance, like they are ""your own""? Or do you just see cop work as a necessary job irrespective of suspect/perp race? Do you have deeper and different thoughts about the state of black communities vis a vis law enforcement than other races? What's the #1 thing you wish you could make people understand about your perspective/predicament as a cop? What do we get the most wrong about you and your fellow LEOs when we armchair quarterback like we know WTF we're talking about?"

AMA,3ao542,mchandleraz,2,Mon Jun 22 23:45:31 2015 UTC,".I never have but, I can't say it's never happened.    I would say for me it isn't the case because I don't do this job for them. I do it for me.     . Almost anyone who says fuck the police isn't doing it just based on what happened recently.   I hear that one all the time.  It's become a ""'fuck authority"" thing.    . Ambulances yes.  Some times they won't go to certain areas or scenes.   Never heard of a hospital doing it.   .   Thankfully no   . Lock doors.   Talk to neighbors.   Lights are your friend.    Play music in empty shops.  Anything that simulates life with sound or lights helps prevent crime.    Basic stuff.  Carry a gun/mace/something.    .  African Americans commit more crime.   Not because of a racial thing, but our culture not only breeds laziness and makes crime look glamorous many of them are born into areas where growing up all you do is run the streets.

When in reality many many other factors go into a situation.   I would have shot Michael Brown.    I kinda wish It had been me, the race thing never would've started.   I'm not saying that because I wanted to shoot him, I'm saying that because I hate how much negativity came of it on Wilson, and on my community and profession as a whole."

AMA,3ao542,begotten42,15,Mon Jun 22 16:50:29 2015 UTC,"At different points in the struggle,  one where he was trying to take my weapon and also after being hit and feeling close to being knocked out when he charged.   If I wasn't feeling like it was already lights out for me I would have possibly reassessed the situation because I'm bigger than Wilson was.   However MB still out weighed me by 150 pounds.    Fighting someone 50 pounds bigger than you is a struggle usually.   150 that's insane.  Also, at that point he's already tried to have taken my weapon so it's not like he intends to leave me alive, so yes.  I would have.    Because my life matters too.   It's just sad to me that the people who crucify Wilson don't see that had he died, this would have been a blip on the radar.   Cops die all the time.  The citizens marching for ""justice"" don't give two shits about the men and women who wear a badge.   2 officers have been killed THIS WEEK. With 3 more being shot.   See any protests?  Any marches?  Riots?   Nope.   But the family of one of the criminals who did this DID try to crash a prayer vigil for the fallen officer.    I may be a bit biased but I can see both sides of the coin because I HATE bad cops.  More than anyone else they cause my job to be more dangerous, they get me more hatred.    However most civilians don't have a clue what we do or see,  and to be honest money don't want to or care.   Just don't give them a fucking parking ticket and they can keep their heads in the sand."
AMA,3ao542,PicaRuler,4,Mon Jun 22 18:06:53 2015 UTC,"I totally understand that your safety is priority, but if you were in the same circumstance as Wilson, I would still think it unnecessary for you to shoot at someone's back as they ran away, even if they did assault you prior. As far as MB going for Wilson's weapon and charging him, I have no comment since I can't say I believe one side of the story over the other, but I don't see a problem with an officer using force if that did happen to them. My only issue then is using a gun as opposed to other means (such as a taser). I get that the situation is always complex though.  I think the reason why people don't protest when cops die is because it's an understood risk of taking on the job. Cops know that going into it, you guys deal with dangerous people all the time. You do have to admit that a lot more citizens die at the hands of cops than the other way around though, and I do think there's a problem with that."
AMA,3ao542,PicaRuler,2,Mon Jun 22 18:24:33 2015 UTC,"What about the Eric Garner thing? Or Tamir Rice, or Walter Scott? Michael Brown after investigation seems justified and not racially motivated, however I would argue it was a spark that set off a powder keg of already simmering outrage for a number of reasons.  Michael Brown aside though, how about these other cases? Strangling someone to death for resisting arrest, or shooting a man who is running away.  I understand that fleeing is a crime, but couldn't we maybe... chase them instead of shooting them in the back and then planting a taser on him?"

AMA,3ao542,jct522,7,Mon Jun 22 18:29:32 2015 UTC,"I have two questions: Have you seen this video what do you think of it?  Do you believe in racial bias? I have no problem with police, in fact I have family members who are on the force, my uncle is actually a retired Caption so i have much respect for what you and every other cop does. I actually think its inane that people down your job, its very important that we have people that enforce the law. As a black male I have personally been harassed a few times by police officers when I was in high school (11 years ago). I was pretty clean cut in high school, never did drugs and didn't drink. getting harassed wasn't a great feeling because it made me feel alone. It made me feel like I couldn't call them for help because I thought that they would falsely accuse me of something or they woud think I was the one they were dispatched to subdue. I've been pulled over and given a bogus ""failure to inspect"" ticket (it was thrown out in court) been asked why I was in a certain part (the rich side) of town when walking to a buddies house after school, and asked to go home when hanging around outside with some of my friends who were white. He never asked the other kids to go and he followed me in his car around the block it was terrifying. I don't think most cops are racist and I have always treated them with respect, always ending a sentence with Sir (I grew up in a military household).

AMA,3ao542,changeisbadgood,6,Mon Jun 22 10:12:18 2015 UTC,I absolutely hate paperwork.  I do almost all of it in my car anyway.
AMA,3ao542,tymboturtle,8,Mon Jun 22 10:20:45 2015 UTC,Thanks for this. I'm Australian so I've never really understood add America's obsession with guns but I'd love to hear your reasoning behind your support for gun laws allowing concealed carry permits. Especially because you're a police officer and I'm assuming you have to deal with the consequences of gun violence and gun laws on a regular basis.   Edit - not in a judgmental way either. I genuinely would like to hear your opinion as I don't think I'd get the chance to hear a cops opinion on this very often.
AMA,3ao542,smilinobserver,18,Mon Jun 22 10:34:49 2015 UTC,"Because guns are entrenched in our culture.   I enjoy them as a hobby, I even shoot competitions.        Conceal carry to me, is the legal way for citizens to be prepared to defend themselves from criminals or people misrepresenting the law.      I've said it before the people who conceal carry legally are not usually the ones who would shoot an officer, those people usually have stolen/illegally imported weapons anyway.   I think an armed population ( done properly) would lower crime.  However I feel the systems in place hinder that.    Half of the people who vote on gun laws and such have never held one.    That's the other thing.  You should have to KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. To legislate anything.   Many anti gun people that want guns and such made illegal are the same ones who ask stupid questions like         ""Why didn't they just shoot him in they arm?""  Those people clearly have no first hand info to go on.     It's the same reason that despite the good it could do, I don't like the affordable care act... People putting laws into place they don't understand or that don't apply to them.    It's sketchy to me."
AMA,3ao542,Esco91,3,Mon Jun 22 06:59:05 2015 UTC,"Sorry, not trying to be one of those ""dumb people"" but what is the reason for a lethal shot vs a non lethal shot? I have found myself wondering that. I have many fire arms and go shooting on a regular basis. Just don't quite understand. Thanks"
AMA,3ao542,evoblade,14,Mon Jun 22 07:11:54 2015 UTC,"You shoot often, so it should be easier for you to understand. I'm going to assume that you use nonmoving paper targets. Let's say at one of those targets at 10 yards you are 100% shooter. Meaning 10 out of 10 rounds you fire at the target, hit every time.  When in a stressful situation with high levels of adrenaline generally your shooting decreases by at least 30% now take into account that your target isn't paper it is a living breathing person who is running at you. Let's say with a knife they just pulled or maybe are pulling as they run.    Your weapon isn't even clear of the holster yet and they started running from 10 feet.   Now in our drills the person is usually about 20 feet and it takes them less than four seconds to reach you.     But this is real life you were probably talking to this person so ten feet is more accurate.  Now in five seconds I want you to draw from the holster and shoot a man running at you in the arm or the leg.   Keep in mind if you choose the arm that has the knife they are moving in front of his chest so if you miss you may hit center mass which is what we are taught to shoot anyway.   So you go for a leg but wait if you hit high in his leg you could hit and artery and kill him.   So you go for the smaller part  maybe the knee or the ankle.   Are you a skilled enough shooter to hit man in one of those places in four seconds or less?    Assuming of course that you do it him once what if he doesn't stop then he's on top of you stabbing you.    If you are an avid shooter like you say you should realize the difficulty in the situation that I just mentioned and this is an even listing out all factors.    A good test for this is on paper targets do a bunch of jumping jacks push-ups or a run before drawing from the holster and firing a few shots within a six second time frame."
AMA,3ao542,bouras,6,Mon Jun 22 11:35:33 2015 UTC,"Thank you very much, this was a very informative answer for me. Sorry if it was stupid question but it was sincere. I guess I have just never really thought about lethal shots being in other areas of the body, the stress reducing your accuracy by 30% is a really good thing to know as well, I had no idea. I will definitely try the jumping jacks and pushups thing. Thank you for taking time to answer me"
AMA,3ao542,PureAntimatter,8,Mon Jun 22 11:53:58 2015 UTC,"Any time.    It's still an unrealistic exercise as your adrenaline won't be full blast just from working out.  However it does help give you some of the effect with the higher heart rate.   Also firing from a draw in 3-6 seconds is a lot different than aiming down and getting a good sight picture.    This is something that no matter how much explaining it takes I try to answer throughly because if more people understood this I feel like it would help quite a bit.    You're an avid shooter and didn't know,  imagine the people who have never shot a weapon and only know about them from movies and such."
AMA,3ao542,drfarren,1 point,Mon Jun 22 12:18:03 2015 UTC,"I know this is long after your original comment, but there are other drills you should probably work on before stress drills.   Set your target to 15 ft. Practice drawing and firing 1 shot in 2 seconds. Then 2 shots in 3 seconds, 3 in 4 seconds, and 4 in 5 seconds, all from the draw. Basically you want to get yourself as close to a sub-second draw as possible. This will optimize your aim when shooting. DRY FIRE THIS BEFORE LIVE FIRE.  Safety is paramount when doing speed drills.  When you can handle speed drills, then move to stress drills, as one carries into the other."
AMA,3ao542,eseehcsahi,4,Mon Jun 22 13:05:14 2015 UTC,"Not OP, but aiming is hard."
AMA,3ao542,bouras,4,Tue Jun 23 02:58:56 2015 UTC,"1) all shots are potentially lethal. If you blow up a major blood vessel, whether it's in my arm or my leg or my neck, I may bleed out. All shots are also potentially nonlethal - people have shot themselves in the face and survived. The whole concept it BS.   2) Cops are humans with human aim. Iirc the clear majority of shots miss completely. Center of mass is the most reasonable target to aim for.  3) Ricochet / hitting someone else."

AMA,3aq41v,care_leaver,2,Mon Jun 22 16:23:36 2015 UTC,Were you ever abused in the foster care system? Often there are stories about foster families being the worst because they use the money given for their own personal gain and treat the foster children as second class citizens.
AMA,3aq41v,Donna_N,1 point,Mon Jun 22 21:54:38 2015 UTC,"I was never physically abused, but in both of the foster placements I was in, I would often be the victim of mind and power games. It was obvious even at such a young age that in both foster placements my carers were in it for the money. With one of my foster carers, they clearly treated their own children much better, I was 15 at the time, with a bed time of 10PM, their 4 year old daughter could go to bed whenever she pleased, funny that. They would often exclude me from family activities and would try to reason with me by claiming that they would have to pay more for petrol (gas) if I went with them. A class example of one of the mind games they would use is this; Say I spent the morning in my room, they would challenge it and say something like ""why don't you play out with friends more?"" but If alternatively I had spent the morning with friends they would say something like ""why don't you spend more time with the family?"", either way I couldn't win regardless of my decisions, it often left me feeling like I didn't belong there."
AMA,3aq41v,Donna_N,2,Wed Jun 24 16:50:00 2015 UTC,Do you want to have children of your own one day?
AMA,3aq41v,Donna_N,1 point,Wed Jun 24 17:30:56 2015 UTC,"No, my time in care hasn't put me off though. I still want to happily get married and settle down with someone in the future, but the system where I live means that as soon as I have a child Social Services automatically become involved. I don't want that for a child, regardless of whether or not they would remember.   Another reason being I feel like I have bad genes. I was taken into care because my mum is a paranoid schizophrenic and couldn't look after me. I was also a rehab baby, meaning I was the result of two people who have addictive personalities. My mum still abuses drugs to this day, despite being in and out of mental institutions and rehabs for the past 30-ish years. I have anxiety and depression, possibly bi-polar. I have an addictive personality but I don't abuse drugs, I like a drink and a smoke but I've never touched anything hard.   My friend argued that I could still have kids, and that my mum probably has schizophrenia because of her drug abuse, which is probably true. Even though I have my problems I've always been smart, which would be a good attribute for kids. But I still feel like I come from a family tree of fragile minds (sounded less corny in my head haha). I still question if I want any children, but I firmly think I don't want any."
AMA,3aq41v,sonny411j,2,Thu Jun 25 13:45:48 2015 UTC,"You've got every right to be cautious and I commend you for it. If you know you don't want kids, don't have them. Too many people think that just because they know how to procreate means that they're good parents. As a teacher of small children, I can tell you there are so many kids that are going to be messed up because of that.  Just be sure to stand your ground if you get challenged or pressured by friends and loved ones about having children. No one knows you better than you. Good luck to you and God Bless."

AMA,3amath,omeletteparty,1 point,Sun Jun 21 22:46:18 2015 UTC,no secret menu like In-N-Out Burger but we do sometime make some odd/interesting pizzas if its slow
AMA,3amath,un_internaute,3,Mon Jun 22 02:53:06 2015 UTC,Can you name the most odd pizza and the most interesting pizza you ever made?
AMA,3amath,AnotherSmegHead,3,Mon Jun 22 04:35:30 2015 UTC,"Oddest: I made a 'suicide' pizza once. It includes all of our marketable ingredients and pasta noodles. If wasn't good at all.   Interesting: there are a few good ones.  Trady (traditional wing pizza): shredded traditional wings, onions med sauce as base and med sauce/ranch drizzle. Takes forever to make because you have to cook the wings then give them time to cool down before you shred them up and add it to the pizza but it's soo good   Cinnamon Rolls  Gyro pizza  Daredevil: burning hot sauce/sweet sauce base, cheddar cheese, jalapeños, banana peppers, and habanero pepper (brought in we don't carry them)   Thin cinnamon and icing pizza. So yummy   Edit: spelling/grammar"
AMA,3amath,AnotherSmegHead,1 point,Mon Jun 22 10:27:54 2015 UTC,Like a McGangbang? This question is essential.
AMA,3amath,AnotherSmegHead,8,Mon Jun 22 01:45:03 2015 UTC,"Is your store a sit in restaurant too? Those ole pizza Hut ones have basically gone by the wayside huh?  How does the wings, subs, and everything non pizza compare to that of true pizza sales?   Whats Ur Busiest day? Superbowl Sunday, New Years?"
AMA,3amath,tymboturtle,5,Sun Jun 21 17:53:16 2015 UTC,No luckily I work at a Del/Co (delivery/carry out) I have filled in at a dine-in and I must say I'm glad I don't deal with it on a day to day.   We don't have subs at the del/co's but wings are pretty big. They sell less then the pizzas but they are an entire different entity. People forget we sell pasta too. It's decent. We don't sell too many of them.   SuperBowl is by far our busiest day. NewYears is actually slow.
AMA,3amath,cockshittingmanatee,3,Sun Jun 21 18:12:03 2015 UTC,Thanks. I forgot about the pasta. I've never had anything but pizza from PH. Usually we just get the stuffed crust.
AMA,3amath,cockshittingmanatee,7,Sun Jun 21 18:19:27 2015 UTC,I will say that our wings are really good. Maybe a little on the expensive side compared to the market in our area but they are yummy.
AMA,3amath,G17RTF2,3,Sun Jun 21 18:29:41 2015 UTC,"Can confirm. Pizza Hut wings are great. They are expensive but that never stops me from ordering 16 bone in, breaded, honey bbq wings every single time I order from you guys. Out of all the chain pizza places, you guys are by far my favorite. Keep up the good work."

My younger brother couldn't find any job after highschool till someone in the family knew someone and got him in a small pizza joint. He couldn't get a job at an establishment like pizza hut or round table but a small business took him right away. Big businesses like pizza hut need to give more people chances man,"

AMA,3amath,selfcheckout,7,Sun Jun 21 21:25:41 2015 UTC,God I hate running out of dough. It's kinda true yes. We prep all of the dough overnight the night before. We have a revenue list that gives us projections on how many to prep. It's not always accurate due to weather and sporting events. Our store tries to take that into account. But yes we can run out of dough. We can always prep more but it takes a few hours to emergency prep them at night.

AMA,3amath,BigBroHo,2,Tue Jun 23 21:45:26 2015 UTC,Should I order the hot dog pizza?
AMA,3amath,calor,7,Sun Jun 21 19:30:55 2015 UTC,It's not the best cut of hot dog. 60/40 ratio of pork and beef. I personally prefer 100% beef hot dogs. But it was surprisingly really good. Comes with a side of mustard to dip the dogs in. I would recommend it but get it with the pretzel crust.   Edit: Math
AMA,3amath,Canadian_Infidel,4,Sun Jun 21 19:35:35 2015 UTC,Cool. Second question: what do you put in the crust that makes it so delicious but yet keeps me up all night with diahrea?
AMA,3amath,Chocrates,2,Sun Jun 21 19:41:25 2015 UTC,Hahahahaha the standard crust finisher is buttery garlic sauce and yeah it does that to me too. I usually pass on the garlic crust for that reason

AMA,3ar8zn,canadianhotwife89,3,Mon Jun 22 21:28:17 2015 UTC,"So when you tell him about it, does he openly masturbate? Has he ever sat in on a session where you have sex with Not Your Husband? Does your husband have other major fetishes, like orgasm denial?   Do you like having sex with a particular kind of guy? Is the sex that you have with others fairly impersonal, or do you have emotional or romantic connections with all of your partners?   Have you and your husband ever had a threesome or further than that? Would you guys consider yourselves swingers at all? What kind of toys do you and your husband own or use?"
AMA,3ar8zn,rayx3025,3,Mon Jun 22 23:22:50 2015 UTC,"Well when I am telling him we are usually having intercourse or he is masturbating with the idea of him cumming. That is what he gets out of it. He has sat and watched his friend fuck me and loved it always asks for it again. Another fetish of his is humiliation as in when I tell him he is smaller than other guys I have fucked. For some reason it gets him off like no other.   I have a certain type, usually fairly dominate big guys.I have had some impersonal relationships where I show up we do it and I leave. Others that I don't tell them I am married and carry on a very casual relationship that I break off before it gets carried away.   We have had a threesome again with a friend of his. Would not say we are swingers in a sense as he does not fuck other woman. We use dildos, anal plugs, and things to tie me down."

I have a similar humiliation fetish, as well! Does he have a fetish for being exposed at all?   Are either of you on the LGBT+ spectrum? What kind of body type is your husband? What's the thing that really makes you guys connect, in a romantic way, like why did you choose him to marry?   You guys sound like a lot of fun!"
AMA,3ar8zn,rayx3025,3,Mon Jun 22 23:56:05 2015 UTC,No fetish of exposure but he wants to do some nudists things.   I would say I lean towards the bisexual side but I love men yoo much to take it seriously.   We are romantic in the goofy silly way. We also just love to be naked with each other and talk.

AMA,3ar8zn,Marz23,2,Tue Jun 23 02:36:52 2015 UTC,What else are you into?
AMA,3ar8zn,Marz23,1 point,Tue Jun 23 02:44:29 2015 UTC,"I really dig the idea of multiple people seeing me naked and laughing about how I can't control my erection and how small my cock is. I also like the idea of those people tickling me, jerking me off, that kind of thing. Maybe, if the people can get my timing right, they plateau me a few times before letting me actually orgasm. Sort of the exact opposite of the cuckold stuff, where this relies on me being the center of attention. In the cuckold stuff, it's more that I'm ignored, there to watch a sexy scene that I can't join and can't touch myself to, to watch my partner(s) get off without the small help I can offer.   Being tied to something and giving oral to someone/multiple people. Perhaps being left there afterwards, pictures taken of me and my small, rock hard cock and how much I need to get off but can't because I'm tied up. Said pictures posted to the kinds of places where people would laugh at me for it.   I'm very not into the idea of pain, I'm really sensitive that way and I refuse to hurt other people (even if they like it, it's hard to do). Also, making fun of my small member is fun, but too much can just make me feel attacked. =/ It's necessary to talk over beforehand if I want to be insulted or not, because sometimes it's not what I'm into. Also, I'm not big into name calling, like being called a slut, whore, etc. That's too much, I'll get offended.   And as I've mentioned, I like to be embarrassed. A day where I have to be naked where my partner(s) isn't necessarily, or alternatively I can only wear a loincloth/jock/underwear that's too tight/loose. (Naked is a good way to do it because I'm more comfortable that way anyway). And I'm not allowed to touch myself that entire time, no matter how much my partner(s) tease me and touch me. And I do chores, watch my partner(s)  do sexual acts, etc. I can only orgasm after I am practically begging for release, and even then, I might still not be allowed to touch myself and someone has to do it for me.   Of course, after that kind of a day (or most of these fantasies), I'd need lots of cuddles and soft talking, conversation about what did and didn't work, to help pull me out of that pseudo subspace.   I'm also big into the idea of very chill, relaxing nights naked. Soft kisses on my skin and on my partner(s), getting each other off in a very gentle way. Cuddly stuff. Those are necessary because being exposed to highly embarrassing emotions so frequently can be exhausting and unhealthy, even with proper moves out of subspace afterwards. And sometimes, you've just had a bad day and need to be chill.   But you'll notice that a common theme is loss of control, willingly handing control over my body and sex to somebody else. I don't know why I love that stuff so much, but dang if it doesn't excite me."

After the local anesthetic wore off it felt like it does two minutes after getting punched in the balls. This only lasted the rest of the day and wasn't too bad, in fact, I was planning on taking a cab home but changed my mind and took the train home without problems. A dull ache came and went for two or three weeks but also wasn't too bad. Talking with other vasectomied men has led me to believe I had a relatively light recovery. Since you're planning on doing it you should look into Planned Parenthood. They perform them in some areas and the out-of-pocket expense was 25% of what other doctors were asking. If your insurance covers it you're very lucky. Also, congrats on the wedding and the mutual no-kid conviction!"

There's nothing wrong with waiting to do it and these days it's really easy to not accidentally impregnate someone. If you feel like it's what you really want though you should do it. It will change your relationship with women (I'm assuming you're into) though. As you get older more women will have decided that they don't want kids too but the younger set will be more likely to not want to be with someone who can never impregnate them as it limits their options."

AMA,3al9sq,Lisa_TK,2,Sun Jun 21 20:10:07 2015 UTC,"I work for an engineering company in the UK. Last year we had a health and safety inspection, where the inspector regularly voiced her 'feelings' about our equipment and processes. I got stuck with her because as one of the few women in our department they thought I'd be able to speak 'dippy blonde'.  When I quizzed her about her background, she told me that she was a humanities graduate, who'd move into Health and Safety after doing various courses.  So my question to you, is do you think you should have an engineering background before you wander onto a shop floor and start expressing your feelings about whether a process is safe or not."
AMA,3al9sq,Blast338,3,Sun Jun 21 09:05:35 2015 UTC,"In terms of a someone who is conducting a general inspection, they should almost certainly have a background in engineering or hard science.   My Major in university, which was specifically aimed at what I did, was called a Bachelor of Science in Safety Engineering. It focused on the three main studies of OSH:   Industrial Hygiene Ergonomics  Risk Calculation   To work for IOSHA, it was required that you be able to be a board certified Industrial Hygienist within 5 years of being hired. This meant that every new hire essentially had to meet, or be in the process of meeting the prerequisite requirements for ABIH. Here is the minimal requirement to start your board certification education:  1.You possess at least a 4 year Bachelor’s Degree from a regionally-accredited college or university: in Biology, Chemistry, Physics, or Engineering, or in IH or Safety from an ABET-accredited program, or with at least 60 semester hours of science, math, engineering, or science-based technology (15 hours at the junior, senior, or graduate level).  tl;dr Yes, they should have an engineering or STEM background."

AMA,3al9sq,Goldenboy_62,3,Sun Jun 21 12:35:57 2015 UTC,"Waste:  As much as perception of waste occurring is widespread, I think people always jump to the conclusion that Federal and State agencies have the biggest junk budgets. But when it comes down to it, waste is something much more widespread in county, city, and township governments. I never saw too much waste spending, but to a certain extent, OSHA itself is a waste (continue reading for explanation).    Bureaucracy: OSHA, particularly IOSHA, is a very weak and small organization. We had 82 inspectors (CSOs) (with 22 of them being devoted solely to Construction) while I worked there. I always laugh when people talk about how much they hate OSHA and how OSHA is just trying to extort them. We conduct, organizationally wide, less than 700 inspections per year. Within that, the order we conducted investigations and inspections went: 1. Death Investigations 2. Catastrophic Injury Investigations 3. Life Threatening Whisteblower Complaint Inspections 4. Targeted Industry Inspections 5. Whistleblower Complaint 6. Routine Inspection  I never once made it past life threatening whistleblower complaints. Essentially OSHA is like having a police force, but all that police has the manpower to do is to investigate the murders which occur, and respond to occasion violent rape and mass robbery. It's weak, has very little power, and continually weakened.   Why aren't you an employee of it anymore: Reverse middlelife crisis, jumped ship from having a stable well paying desk job with a 401K and retirement, to go back to being a Firefighter and working on an Ambulance."

Same reason there are laws which force you to wear seatbelts and make people wear helmets while riding motorcycles.   For instance, people love to fight about having to wear hearing protection. But study after study have shown exposures to as little as 85 dB per 5 hours a day and can result in deafness prior to age 50. The OSHA required hearing protection level doesn't even go into play until 90 dB for 8 hours. OSHA is the bare minimal level of protection which an employer must provide to an employee. It's not a best practice or even an acceptable level of protection, it's the bare minimum."

I  also know a lot of foremen that would gladly put you in deadly situations just to be quick about something if it wasn't for these rules.    Guess all in all they help and hurt sometimes.

If it lends any credence to my point, I've also encouraged / participated in a recreational activity with known risks, and it did lead to the death of someone I was very, very close to.

Also, it remains illegal at a federal level, just as it does in Colorado.  However, an Alaskan citizen can have 1 oz on his person, and have up to 6 plants at home.  I have indeed smoked my share.  I'll be very careful with my words, here.  The official policy of my union is that it is determined by the company drug policy.  most companies require occasional, ""completely foolproof"" drug tests.  My boss has never directly discussed it with me.  however I am currently dealing with pain from a workplace accident... you understand? As an avid supporter of personal health, and as a Christian, I have absolutely no reservations about smoking cannabis.  I have done extensive research, talked with medical people about it(including a psychologist who said that marijuana is MUCH safer for your body than most of the things she perscribed), and examined my reaction to it.  Marijuana is illegal because in the early days of our country, timber companies did not want the competition of hemp products sapping their profits.  It is illegal now because of that and the influence of Alcohol and tobacco companies who do not want the competition of a safer, healthier, more effective alternative.  how many angry MJ smokers have you heard of?  overdoses?  me either.

The thought of doing all this to inflate your metaphysical cock at dinner parties is childish, irresponsible, and pathetic.  my father was a hunting guide for 20 years.  I know of which I speak. I have never needed to kill a bear, but my father has.  at close range.  once dropped a 12' grizz so close that he could feel it's breath on his pants as it died.  I have had to deal with numerous moose and wolves, though. I have never seen slednecks.  ignore it.  it's as ridiculous as ""amish mafia"" or ""jersey girl alien sex house"".

I guess it's my chance!   1) Why are some rules more important than others for Christians? For an example being gay is still condemned, but women not covering their heads or not resting on the seventh day isn't considered wrong anymore.   2) Do you believe that people should be ruling over everything that has been created? Also, do you think that humans are the most important and holy forms of life? Many religions have planted this idea in our heads that everything created is meant for us so that we can have a better life. I think this view has lead to us destroying everything; thus, I found making myself believe that I'm more important than a cat extremely challenging. I would really love to read a rational Christian opinion on that."
AMA,3aobp7,highflyinduck,1 point,Mon Jun 22 11:23:21 2015 UTC,"I didn't start the AMA but I'm also a Christian and would love a crack at your questions:     First of all I don't think the Bible condemns ""being gay"". The Bible condemns gay sex.  I think this is an important distinction because I agree that feeling sexual attraction to the same gender isn't exactly something you choose.  However common theme throughout the New Testament as that people feel all kinds of urges, feelings and attractions to all kinds of harmful things.  One of the callings of the Christian life is to learn to control those urges rather than simply giving into everything you feel.  The idea is you can be attracted to someone of the same gender but as long as you don't act on it, you're fine.  Likewise you can be attracted to a woman who isn't your wife (who isn't?) but if you don't act on it, you're fine.  This might seem overly strict at first but I think this view has a high view of human beings and teaches us that we are more than just animals capable of living towards a higher purpose and not just do everything our urges tell us to do.  There's a freedom in that I think.   As far as the head covering are concerned that is certainly a tricky one.  However, keep in mind in 1 Corinthians 11: 15 that Paul is talking about ""long hair"" when he means covering.  He thinks men shouldn't have long hair and women should.  Back then men dressing like women and vice versa were frowned on culturally and Paul didn't want Christians blurring the lines between genders.  Now that culture standards have changed (men can often have long hair and women short) our call is to maintain a clear distinction between genders but the specifics have changed.  So we don't arbitrarily pick and choose some rules over others, we just take into account historical context, textual context etc.    I personally believe that human beings do have special and intrinsic value according to God over other kinds of creatures.  With this value I believe God tasked humans to ""rule of the land and subdue it"" as it says in Genesis.  However I think we go wrong when we interpret that passage to mean just consume resources to fuel our own selfish desires.  I think God had more in mind that man are to act as stewards or caretakers of his creation.  While the resources of this world our available for us to use, I think we have a calling to protect and help it flourish.  It's actually pretty frustrating to me that more Christians (especially in America) don't value taking care of the environment as I think that's a pretty explicit command in scripture.   Hope that helps!"
AMA,3aobp7,Nomanorus,1 point,Mon Jun 22 14:04:57 2015 UTC,"Thanks for answering! I feel happy that there are open-minded Christians out there that actually acknowledge that being gay is not a mental disease or choice. My question was actually more about what Christians find important rather than what the Bible says. Most Christians consider being gay a sin even though the Bible directly doesn't say that.   Now, about the long hair... Doesn't all important male figures from the Bible have long hair? At least in paintings they do. :) And Samson definitely had it long. I think that the reason why women have to cover their heads or why God finds gay sex gross hasn't really been explained anywhere. We could also say gay sex was forbidden because of the small population in the area and isn't relevant anymore (and many Christian gay communities do that or so I've heard).  Anyways, I loved reading your view on how a Christian should view the environment. I think you should spread that opinion in Christian societies."
AMA,3aobp7,highflyinduck,2,Mon Jun 22 15:40:39 2015 UTC,One thing I should point out is that I believe our very existence is sinful. Trying to separate this sin from that sin is picking gnat shit out of pepper.
AMA,3aobp7,Nomanorus,1 point,Mon Jun 22 16:29:11 2015 UTC,"""Most Christians consider being gay a sin even though the Bible directly doesn't say that.""  This isn't really the case in my experience but I'm sorry to hear that it is in your experience.  Hopefully more Christians will be willing to read what the Bible really says.    In regards to long hair, most paintings of biblical characters we have are several millennia removed from when 1 Corinthians was written so we don't really know what Mosses or anyone else looked like.  Even if Moses did have long hair he lived several thousands years before the New Testament was written so there were surly different social expectations and views for Moses than Paul.    It's hard to say exactly why gay sex was forbidden by God.  Population controls is a possibility but that's kind of just speculation.  I don't really think its because he thinks its gross as that strikes me as rather arbitrary.  I think it might have something to do with why God doesn't allow premarital or extra marital sex.  The Bible treats sex as really important and really beautiful.  Therefore to treat it flippantly or sort of go against the intended purpose kind of twists it up.  That's my view anyway, thanks for reading!"

What I found out after 20 years or so away from the church is that I still believed in Christ, I just started doubting some of his followers.  1 - In order to answer the first question I would have to take the entire Bible, including Leviticus, literally.  It's quite difficult for me to do that.  In my opinion (strong emphasis on the word opinion) gay men make some straight men uncomfortable but misogyny does not.  And I say gay men specifically because you never hear them complaining about two women together.  2 - I absolutely believe that we are most favored and have dominion over the Earth.  That by no means us gives us an excuse to use it any way we wish and discard it after a single use.  It is a gift from God and we should respect it as such.  We don't.  We're just jerks.

AMA,3anh6y,Finallyausername,1 point,Sun Jun 21 23:59:18 2015 UTC,"In basic terms, when somebody hurts themselves, most people will wince from the pain, associating themselves with that pain, like a 'friend' of mine once saw a man get hit in the balls and jumped and yelled because he said ""he felt that"". That is because certain areas in his brain (somatosensory cortex, anterior midcingulate cortex, anterior insula and the amygdala) activates when people, like you, see stuff like that but with people like me, they fail to activate. When people get hurt or killed etc, a part in our brains (vental striatum) activates, which is basically the part of the brain that associates things with pleasure. When it comes to behaviour, some say we are manipulative, destructive, charismatic, and 'empty;. WHen I say empty, I mean when people lie or kill someone, they usually feel a strong sense of regret, guilt even remorse, whereas Psychopaths have a lack in all of those subjects, which is why many of us have killed an animal or two when we were younger, because we don't fully feel remorse or guilt like others who love dogs and cats etc. Hope this helped."

They are both very similar but obviously have differences. Both have brains wired different from the normal human brain, in the way that Psychopaths don't have a sense of right and wrong whereas sociopaths do have understand the difference from right and wrong, but their 'right' is a little bit different that everybody elses.

I don't want to force it, but I'm trying to be more conscious about the fact that I'm not just going to end up with a wonderful wife and kids - I need to start working now to direct myself toward a more stable situation. Having said that, I think there are a few things I need to figure out before entering that phase of my life.  To be transparent, my personal life is not really in order. A typical day involves 2-3 hours of commuting and 10-12 hours at the office assuming nothing urgent comes up. By the time I get back to my neighborhood at night, I want to do something for a couple hours before going to sleep and starting all over the next day. There are two options: the gym or the bar. If I've been knocked out my gym routine then there's a good chance I hit the bar. The bar is fun because I can chat with the bartenders and whoever else is hanging out, and it's enjoyable, but it usually means a mild hangover the next morning.  It's not a sustainable way to live, but at the same time, my schedule isn't consistent enough to have regular appointments at 8pm MWF doing something I enjoy to keep me anchored. Unfortunately, I'm more efficient with managing my personal life when I'm semi-busy but able to maintain a routine. Once the routine is broken, everything becomes unhinged."

Let's be honest - I don't think there's any such thing as a ""wonderful wife and kids"" - this will involve work ...and a whole heap of selflessness. But the rewards are very significant, life-long and incalculable.  I should also add, I can relate to your story. I also have been a programmer / musician / producer and these days am a database architect who spends considerable time abroad working. I've been married for 34 years now, have a grandchild and I spend at least 3 months of the year in Thailand and am based in Oz. Where are you currently based?  I wish you good luck mate.

It wears on you a bit.  I appreciate your words and it sounds like you've seen all of this before. I need to get my head straight on a few things, but I'm getting there. I've been dating a girl here for nearing two years who puts me to shame in pretty much every facet of life that matters. But, I don't want to make a mistake that hurts both of us, so I really need to figure out a few things before taking the next step.  Regarding your own experiences, had you studied both programming and music by the time you entered the work force? Did you have to add any major new skills to get into any of the positions you ended up on career-wise, or were you able to take fairly logical steps to get from one path to the next?

But programming, I went back to studies as a mature age student before I entered the field of IT. Even though it was not my core skill, I always had an interest in databases (more out of necessity). I decided some years ago now, that I should specialize in it and eventually worked my way up to architect level. Luck played a significant part too. If there was one piece of advice I have learned which may be helpful to you - it would be to ""know when to leave a company"". I have now twice been stuck in a professional rut, mostly out of misguided ""loyalty / commitment"" and after leaving, always felt better (and wondered, how/why the hell did i stay there so long?). Never be afraid to ""jump"" into the unknown. Every single time I have become stronger for it.  The hurt I mention, related to the sudden loss of a loved one (car accident) - that sure put some perspective on my ""problems""."

It's interesting that you say ""I'd wonder why I'm watching other people doing things with their lives rather than doing more with my own"". So what more do you think should you do with your life?"
AMA,3akbze,metapatterns,0,Sun Jun 21 01:25:46 2015 UTC,"Perfect question. While I can't tell you exactly what I envision as being the ideal version of my life, I can tell you two specific things that bother me endlessly:   I don't know what hard, tangible skills I have that I can do better than the vast majority of people I don't feel like I'm creating anything tangible and lasting of value   Regarding the first point (which is actually related to the second), I look at programmers, architects, artists, musicians, and athletes and am envious of the fact that they have the tools in their mind to create and do real things from scratch that others can't do. Their value is relatively concrete. I think there's something about me that I would feel more comfortable knowing my skills are based on a tangible foundation (or maybe everyone is this way - including business people - and I personally am missing the tangible part of business).  Business is no doubt a real and valuable endeavor, but many of the skills that are needed to succeed are hard to define, without form, and difficult to practice in a regimented manner. Interpersonal skills, a desire to care about and make money, and being proactive in those endeavors is crucial. While I can hold up my end of a conversation, business meetings are not my natural environment. I do think I have certain natural skills that work well in business, but I'm not the complete package.  The second point is about creating things. I used to play guitar fairly often (and by that I mean an hour a day, not like a virtuoso in the making), and I enjoyed occasionally recording music. I still can listen to those songs and be proud of what I did, knowing they would not exist without me, even though they're amateurish at best. Now, the majority of my time is spent in the chaotic and back-and-forth business world where we're all fighting for a pie that no one will care about in a few years. My days are spent at the office or in a too-long commute, and all I'm really getting out of it is money.  So, maybe I'm on the doorstep of realizing the problem, but it's not as easy as deciding to be a programmer, or picking up the guitar again and deciding to make it my life's work. There's a lot at stake for changing course, and I'm behind everyone that figured it out sooner. So, I'd like to leave my mark, but I'm still trying to figure out how."

AMA,3akbze,Starstriker,1 point,Sun Jun 21 02:25:14 2015 UTC,"What kind of answer were you expecting?  And playing guitar is a good hobby, but it was never the core part of my identity, and at the time, I was satisfied enough with the other aspects of my life. For example, when you're growing up (at least for me), everything you do in life seems like it's part of the grand journey of becoming a successful adult. Just by going to class, doing your homework, getting into college, choosing a major, writing the report, getting the degree, every day it seems like you're working toward something important in your life.  The problem with my outlook began after I started working with stable jobs in large companies, earning enough to get by and save, and being right in line with everyone else to climb that corporate ladder. That's when I realized I was spending large amounts of time doing what I was supposed to be doing for the rest of my life, and I wasn't that happy with it.  Yes, I could play the guitar more, but noodling around on the guitar in my apartment and recording the occasional song that no one but me hears is not the type of thing I imagine as being my gift to the world."

AMA,3akbze,Malcoda,2,Sun Jun 21 13:17:18 2015 UTC,"The psychedelics remind me of comical attempts from college of trying to go down that path without having any contacts or real knowledge about what I was doing. I attempted to grow magic mushrooms in my dorm room at one point. This really pleased my friend and dorm neighbor who was in the process of trying to get an internship at a government agency. Regardless, all I ended up growing was mold. After that I ordered amanita muscaria extract, which I realize isn't the real thing, and had a nice playlist ready to go. I didn't have anything to use to smoke it, so I put that tar-like substance in some gatorade and gulped it down, then watched the sunset as the placebo effect took hold. Unfortunately that was as far as I got, and the trip never got off the ground… maybe I didn't take enough.  I've smoked salvia a few times which I thought was pretty crazy, but aside from learning that it's possible to really throw your brain off, I don't think that's the type of experience that lends itself to meditation and finding yourself.  Regarding the natural world, you're probably on the right track. I don't own a car here because I live in a large city with great public transportation. There are lots of beautiful natural areas in this country, but since I can only get to the ones accessible by buses or trains, there are always other people because of the country's relatively high population density. The places are still a great way to get away, but you're never really alone with your thoughts for very long. However, I think you're on to something that nature and quiet are two things missing from my life.  Actually, I just got back home from a business trip last night and couldn't sleep because of the jet lag. I was walking around my neighborhood this morning at 6:30 and there were almost no cars and no people. For one of the only times I can remember since moving to this country, I felt the kind of peace and relaxation that I associate with visiting my parents' house in a quiet small town."
AMA,3akbze,Wazzelbe,2,Sun Jun 21 13:31:38 2015 UTC,"Cool. When I get ""stuck"", I try to force myself out of whatever paradigm I'm using to get a new perspective and reconnect with a bigger picture.

AMA,3akbze,fb123uk,5,Sun Jun 21 20:51:46 2015 UTC,"You sound exactly like me. Businessman, in my 40s, with no ""real"" skills, making it hard to figure out the next step. The difference is that Im now blessed with a family, so I have no problems spending my time.  Maybe you should think about moving back home and settle down? Might sound dull, but thats what I did. I think it was a good move, but still I can miss my old life.  Right now Im figuring moving inte an entirely new field (properties), but it takes some time to let go of what Im currently stuck in....  Also, maybe you should think about getting a new hobby. Photo or something. That hobby can take you to the weirdes places if you are into it.   I have a small workshop here where Im learning some woodworking. Nothing fancy at all, but it gives me peace of mind.  My 5c :)"
AMA,3akbze,SMFishbone,0,Sun Jun 21 07:24:18 2015 UTC,"I get what you're saying and have definitely considered that the answer might just be to come home. I have a feeling that the biggest part of the dissatisfaction is office environment that I work in. Average things can be fun when you enjoy the people you work with but they can be miserable if the fit isn't right, so a likely next step for me is a similar line of work back in the US.  I want to try to fix one variable at a time if possible to try to get a better sense of what elements of my job I actually do enjoy, and then figure out from there whether I need to make small adjustments or still need to reconsider the whole career path.  And you're right, choosing a hobby that's a good fit for my interests could be a big way to alleviate the stress. The challenge at the moment is there's not a lot of free time or energy."
AMA,3akbze,giverous,1 point,Sun Jun 21 12:42:48 2015 UTC,"Seems like you have to take a step back and down the career-ladder. All that money aint worth sacrificing life-quality for.  I once lived in London, made $14k/month but I really disliked it there. Office environment sucked. (company was run by yanks/ex militaries. Imagine....)  It was all work and then pub 4 nights of 7...  I ended moving back to Sweden slashing my income with 60%, but I become happy again :)  How old are you?"
AMA,3akbze,giverous,1 point,Sun Jun 21 17:12:43 2015 UTC,"I'm in my early 30's. I work in Korea which also has a very militaristic style at the large companies. This isn't an accident, since all of them men in the country have to go through the military. The schooling system is also extremely regimented. So, you've got guys growing up in a regimented system, following it with military, then entering a corporate culture that came into its own while the country was dragging itself out of poverty. The result is an office environment that values loyalty and cohesion above all else, and while westerners can avoid subjecting themselves to the worst of it, it creates an environment where things change on a dime because someone up the ladder said so which inevitably affects your ability to follow through on whatever you thought you were going to accomplish for the month or quarter.  To make things more challenging - and obviously this is mostly my own ""fault"" - I don't speak the language. In my defense, I was hired because of my education and experience in the west, and initially the group I was in had a large number of other westerners. The challenge was moving to a more standard line job. You hear stories from other westerners about how chaotic it is and how they don't know how to utilize westerns, but you always think you'll manage better by carefully choosing where you go. The thing you can't really prepare for are the endless reorganizations that happen, and before long you find yourself in a team that didn't necessarily plan on having westerners, and isn't prepared to dedicate the time to support someone who obviously is going to have a different set of strengths and weaknesses.  The drinking culture here was also legendary but at least that's being cut down (although I maintain my own drinking culture a little more than I should since it's the most flexible way to unwind after a day of the madness)."

AMA,3ajifd,hobogoblin,4,Sat Jun 20 23:49:44 2015 UTC,"Word of advice.  I did the same when I was 16, am 31 now, my school never told me about selective service, they usually tell people about it when you're 17.  So I never even heard of it until 6 months ago when I applied for college and financial aid turned me down because I never signed up for it before the cut off. I explained that I've never even heard of it and my school never mentioned it to me but they didn't care.  Basically signing up for selective service puts your name into the draft list if a draft is held, you must do this if you ever want to apply for financial aid.  Just letting you know so you can make the choice I didn't know was a choice."

As in, are there breeds you have particular trouble with?  Are you a big dog or small dog person?  Do you have any amazing tales of brilliant/trouble dogs/owners?   Thank you!"
AMA,3aknoj,cmad182,1 point,Sun Jun 21 13:14:07 2015 UTC,"I don't have a single breed that I prefer working with, but if I had to pick then I would say a Maltese or Yorkie just because they are small. Smaller dogs tend to be easier, even if they are aggressive, because they can be handled better! My least favorite dog to work with would be a Golden Retriever. They are very friendly, but almost too friendly. They often wiggle and I have actually had a few aggressive ones. Also, their coat takes a long time to dry.  I would say that as a pet owner, I prefer big dogs. But as a bather, I will chose a little dog any day over a big one :)  I don't have any amazing tales, but one thing I do want to mention is that people don't understand the struggle we go through to care for their dogs. They think that their dog is having a relaxing time at the salon, when in reality, they are getting their butt pinched (anal expression), soaked in water, blasted with high velocity air dryers, etc.   Thank you for the questions! Hope I answered correctly!"

He wanted to drive multiple cars (2+ hrs I  test drives), not decide on a car that we had, negotiate on said non-existing car for 4 hours. Not buying it from me, buying it from someone else, then asking me to help him with everything. Told him to go back to where he bought it for help.

AMA,3agbnn,Thatnewgui,1 point,Sat Jun 20 01:37:04 2015 UTC,"Oh god, sorry for the delay. Forgot about your follow up comment. Well, this would have been many, many years ago when I was still young in the car business. We are taught to wear different hats for different customers and try to find common ground, you know, make a friend. One day, I had a gay client come in with his partner to look at SL500s. We looked at some, drove one, and started talking about numbers and how I can sell him a car. As time went, we bounced back and fourth, talking about figures, life, cars, and other randomness. Somewhere in the conversation, he asked me about ""if I've ever thought about men."" Not wanting to offend the guy as we were all getting along, I said something along the lines of ""no, but who knows what my mind wants."" and laughed it off. We continued to negotiate, but didn't end up working things out as it just got too late into the evening.  Fast forward to 2 days later or something like that. I make a follow call to the guy and we start off the conversation okay, then it got weird. To this day, I still remember the things he said. ""Pnda59, I'm a tough negotiator, so I'm not surprised we couldn't make the deal the other day. I'm still thinking about it. I'll make you a offer and it might not be right, but sometimes, you just have to bend over and take it."" I almost choked at what he said. He just laughed and continued like it was regular conversation. We talked some more and I was telling him that just because it wasn't the his first color choice, it was still a great car. His response to that? ""Well Pnda59, you might right. It's just like ice cream. You might not initially like the sound of the flavor, but at times, you have to lick it first to find out you love the taste."" It just went on like this for 45+ mins... The most awkward phone conversation ever.  What did I learn from all this? Make your intentions clear when working with middle aged gay males. They are f'ing aggressive! Since then, I've not ""worn a different hat"" when working with them. No problems with gay/lesbian clients, just can't deal with the advances. I did end up selling them a car though, so at least it wasn't for naught."

AMA,3agbnn,elmatador12,2,Sat Jun 20 08:24:28 2015 UTC,"With BMW's free maintainance, it's hard for them to over charge someone. If you are considering keeping the car beyond the warranty period, the extended maintainance and warranty options are well worth it - you are buying a ma made thing, chances are, it's not perfect. Your question falls to the individual dealer. There are shady ones out there and it is the service manager's job to ""upsell"".

Let me run your credit mr/ Mrs customer"
AMA,3agbnn,ReganK99,1 point,Sat Jun 20 04:17:06 2015 UTC,Why do they use different reports?
AMA,3agbnn,ReganK99,2,Sat Jun 20 06:29:29 2015 UTC,"3 credit bureaus are experian, transunion, and equifax. Auto ficos are determined by which auto scoring system the bank uses. It's just a different way of how the credit bureaus determine what variables make your credit score. You have zero control other than maintaining your balances and paying on time."
AMA,3agbnn,ReganK99,3,Sat Jun 20 06:41:48 2015 UTC,"I guess what I mean is, why do mortgages and auto loans use different ways to score a customer."
AMA,3agbnn,ReganK99,5,Sat Jun 20 06:46:03 2015 UTC,"There are different risks involved with each. With a home, you're purchasing an appreciating asset - thus the banks can assess if they will be in a positive equity position during the loan and how much they will make if you default. With a car, you're purchasing a depreciating asset - now the bank has to decide, based on your payment history if you are worth the risk for the amount of money they will potentially make vs what they could potentially lose if you default."
AMA,3agbnn,jpcrash5150,1 point,Sat Jun 20 07:42:40 2015 UTC,this makes so much sense now. My ex's mother tried to get a car and she paid off her house. So her credit we thought was good.

I've seen it. You can also have a good score, but no experience with that type of purchase, so no car credit."

AMA,3agbnn,mrevergood,2,Sun Jun 21 22:38:39 2015 UTC,"Leasing is a great option if you're not planning on keeping the car for the long run, or if you're not sure of the car you're getting in to. As Rockefeller said, ""Lease what depreciates, and buy what appreciates."" You will end up paying a little more in interest if you decide to buy at the end, but what it give you, are options. At lease end, you can hand them the keys and walk away, get another car in the same brand or different brand, or buy it. Whether you finance it or lease it, the bank owns the car. So why not have the bank take the associated risks as well. Let's say you get in an accident for example. Insurance will pay to have it fixed, but who will have to deal with it when it comes time to trade it in? With a lease, the car is repaired, lease is up, ""here's your keys."", time for a new one. Tons of benefits when it comes to leasing. On the other hand, if you're going to hold on to the thing for the next 8-10 years, certainly, you should buy it and not pay the extra taxes, and fees involved (unless you're going to write it off then buy it. Then definitely lease.)"

I loved doing the AMG challenge driving was super fun, BMW has great sale people incentives, the exotic brands bring me to special events and out of the country... it's hard to decide. My favorite would still have to be Lamborghini though. Super fun driving programs, travel, and amazing cars.  Each brand had its fair share of bad customers who felt entitled. Some Mercedes customers felt they owned the world, some Bentley customers felt we needed to bow down to them, and some lambo customers were complete douche bags. But when it came down to it, the Mercedes customers who were stretching to get the car were sometimes the worse. Not to be racist, but the hard negotiating Indians, chinese and Vietnamese were people I hated dealing with (I'm Chinese)."

Not sure what market you're in, but at $10k for a  2010 Jetta with 60k miles on it, isn't a bad deal, but it isn't a great deal either. You would be getting the car just a little over wholesale. IMO, you could get a new one with less miles for about the same money. Jetta's are good cars, but tend to have some issues as the get older in the tooth. You'd be better to get a 2011 (newer body style) than the last year of the old body style. However, the 2010s are slightly better equipped than the newer style ones, but you'd be getting a safer car in the new body style. Have you considered any other makes of cars?"
AMA,3agbnn,METATERREN,1 point,Mon Jun 22 18:29:07 2015 UTC,"Sounds reasonable. I have looked at some other cars; Hondas, Toyotas and some mazdas, this Jetta is the only car that had a reasonable amount of miles for the price which caught my eye. My sister has a Jetta and she likes it so I think this might be my best bet. I'm going to look at it on Tuesday and I will see if I like it. I'm not able to spend much more than  $10,500 so a newer model would not be an option. Thank you for looking around for me!"

AMA,3agbnn,graveyardking,1 point,Sat Jun 20 06:42:31 2015 UTC,"When you see the deal net on the screen or print out on used,  what other money is hidden away? This dealer has an $850 overhead detail fee and I negotiated a net -450 deal and they might have gone down more. There has to be more money because they wouldn't lose real money on a deal. I know with new there is hold back but used I don't know.    Where is money hidden on used?  How easy is it to manipulate the 'cost' of a used?"
AMA,3agbnn,Adamotron,1 point,Sat Jun 20 17:41:45 2015 UTC,"Each dealer runs their used car departments differently. Most however, will have something called a hard pack ($300-500 to cover the cost of advertising, detailing and fuel). This is a mute point to the customer, as it's calculated against internal gross profits and only effects the sales person as they get paid a percentage of profits. You need only think of what they paid for the car, and what they spent to get it ready in service. With used cars, it's usually market driven when it comes to price. Will dealers actually lose money on a car? Absolutely. If they feel they will lose more by sitting on something, if they feel they paid too much for it in the first place, or if they feel it's not too bad of a loss and the cars been sitting around too long, it's time for it to go.  Its almost impossible for car dealers to minipulate the costs, but it can be done of they take profits from other deals and move it to ""buy down"" the cost of a car they own where they feel they own for too much. Long story short, dealers are willing to lose money on both new and used cars if they serve an end goal."

He kept apologizing for making things weird and awkward. I kept the conversation light and focused on him seeing how he can fix his situation other than running to go hookup with someone.

AMA,3ai6ia,buttgoblin_eater,1 point,Sat Jun 20 12:24:26 2015 UTC,Very interesting background! I have a few questions to get the ball rolling:  *What is the biggest culture shock you've had to deal with during your travel? *What do you do for a living? *What has been your favorite destination so far?
AMA,3ai6ia,dodd1331,3,Sat Jun 20 12:49:52 2015 UTC,"Culture shocks for me are generally the little idiosyncrasies that I was raised NOT to do, but are common in the host nation.   For example, Germans LOVE to stare. It's not rude in their country, and they do it all the time. It seems as though it displays interest, and this isn't a bad thing. I remember one time a young paraplegic man rolled his way into a sporting good store, and everyone turned and stared at him for a solid 4 or 5 seconds. Seems like that would be totally unacceptable in the States.   In Russia, the stereotypes exist for a reason. Holy shit do these people love to drink. I lived for a small time in a small city called 'Ivanovo,' and stayed with a family there. I swear that every time the father and I had some alone time (the family did not speak english, but the father spoke some broken German, and as I did also, that's how we communicated) he would be handing me cherry vodka.   There are many 'culture shocks from different countries I can think of, and maybe I could give more if you'd like from whichever countries you'd like. Here is a list I just made compiling every country and what I did there (i.e., if i studied there or just visited) I know it's not too comprehensive, but I know I'll be in more countries in the future, as I am only 24 at the time of writing.   England (Born, lived, visited) Ireland (visited) Scotland (visited) Germany (lived, worked, studied) Austria (visited) Italy (visited) San Marino (visited) Vatican (visited) Norway (visited) Sweden (visited) Finland (visited) Denmark (visited) Belgium (visited) Hungary (visited) France (visited) Spain (lived, studied) Gibraltar (visited) Switzerland (visited) Russia (lived, studied) Poland (visited) Romania (visited) Latvia (visited) Lithuania (visited) Czech Republic (visited, studied) Slovakia (visited) United States (lived, worked, studied) Antarctica (lived, worked) New Zealand (hitchhiked) Australia (lived, worked) Japan (lived, worked)  My favorite? That's so hard, depends on what you want. If you want to meet beautiful women, definitely go to Latvia. No joke, every woman there is drop dead gorgeous... it's a weird phenomenon, and they are all dying to meet western men. Even the damn hobos are attractive. If you are talking about scenery, I seriously found many places, from United States to Antarctica, beautiful.   If I absolutely had to choose one place, it would be Gibraltar. Not just because it's so beautiful, (it's basically a giant rock on the bottom of Europe, that you can see Morocco across the water on a clear day from) but it's crawling with very friendly monkeys, beautiful and cool caves... and all British people. I was studying in Spain at the time, and just going a few miles to all of a sudden speak English and see 'fish n' chips' was super surreal. Also, I love how there aren't (well, there weren't when I was there) any barriers. You can just walk right up to the cliff rocks and sit, watch the ocean and spot Africa for the afternoon. So amazing. I knew I wanted to get married there as soon as I saw it.   Sorry for the delayed response! It's morning here in Osaka. Let me know if you have any questions about more specific places and I could tell some funny stories or quivering anecdotes about anywhere from Auschwitz to my current place I'm still getting acclimated to, Osaka Japan!"
AMA,3ai6ia,Wicksteed,1 point,Sun Jun 21 00:16:47 2015 UTC,So Latvian women are even more attractive than Norwegian or Sweden women? Is it a close call? I went to Iceland for a week (I'm American) and it made me assume that the ratio of hot women must be different in Norway and possibly Sweden too. But maybe it's just Iceland. I thought there was a lot of overlap in terms of recent ancestry between Iceland and other Nordic countries.
AMA,3ai6ia,Wicksteed,1 point,Sun Jun 21 10:56:31 2015 UTC,"In my opinion, I found so many Latvian women attractive it was rather stupid. I also had this information backed up by other people who told me that they were amazed also. I also distinctly remember my neighbor telling me the women are 'the most gorgeous in the world there,' before I went but upon informing him that I was going.   But Scandinavians are really attractive also, although I tend to be a brunette-man myself."
AMA,3ai6ia,milnetig,1 point,Sun Jun 21 11:40:08 2015 UTC,"Did you notice a lot more second hand smoke in Latvia? The smoking rates are really high in Baltic states compared to USA, I read. That's why I think the only countries I'd consider moving to are countries like Iceland, since it has a similar smoking rate to USA. That's one area where the USA really shines. Even really advanced western European countries often have a way higher smoking rate than the USA. Even in the USA I get sick of smelling other people's cig smoke so I can't really imagine living in a country where 40% smoke instead of 20%."
AMA,3ai6ia,khiladi-,1 point,Mon Jun 22 09:25:45 2015 UTC,How do you organise your accomodation?
AMA,3ai6ia,khiladi-,1 point,Sat Jun 20 14:26:34 2015 UTC,"Good question! So, the main way to organize accommodation is to call ahead to either a hostel (if you're really living on a budget) or an AirBnB, depending on where in the world you are. I have never personally done AirBnB, but I hear it is good. The best thing to get onto is called 'couch surfing.com.' Basically, make a profile, and message people about your status. You get to meet amazing locals, AND stay for free. Many times they will feed you and such just to learn a little about your background. These stays can be extended, or you can just jump from one to another and learn more about locals. Many times, the people on couchsurfing may be from your country (or a similar one, see Canada and America or Australia and New Zealand) and this might ease your visit if it is going to be prolonged.   Worse comes to worse, i've had my sleeping bag and slept in parks or under bridges. I know that sounds sketchy and foreign... and maybe even hobo-ish, but it's actually not bad in certain places if you can find a quiet location and curl up for a few hours. Big public parks with many trees are good places, just don't have a fear of bugs..."

AMA,3ai6ia,McDamsel,1 point,Sat Jun 20 15:13:33 2015 UTC,"I worked in food services for the scientists and other support staff. Basically, we're only in Antarctica for one reason; science. So, everything goes to making sure they are well taken care of, and that's what most of the jobs are. People running the waste, food, transport, safety ect. I just happened to do food services.   I applied on the Raytheon website! I think lockheed owns the contract now, but you just go on the main contractor's website (I think it is lockheed now) and apply for a job for the ASC, or Antarctic Support Contract.  Note: This only works for Americans, I don't know about regulations for other countries.   I decided that I wanted to go to Asia about a year ago, so I saved up and bought a certified TESOL course (about 800 AUD, or ~620 USD) and became a certified english teacher for ESL. Then, you apply for jobs in whatever country you want. Japan is definitely one of the most difficult to get into, due to their very strict and valuable foreign residency cards, but after about 5 months of perseverance, I got it! I have many friends in other countries doing this same thing, so if you're interested in one, I can provide more information!"

AMA,3afpso,mundanevelocity,4,Fri Jun 19 21:33:19 2015 UTC,I was born in Sudan but lived in the United States for most of my life.  The food is a mix of arab and ethiopian cuisine. I could only tell you food my mother makes but I have been in other Sudanese households and saw similar dishes. She makes aseeda (made up of flour and water) and makes a onion sauce that goes with it.   Here's a video of aseeda https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vft7TGRqCY4   We also have injera weekly and my mother makes a spinach sauce that goes with it. Falafel is a staple and Sudanese people love lamb.  Deserts: Baklawa (Arabic pronunciation also more widely known as Baklava) - a sweet pastry that is held together by syrup and fill in with nuts.  These are dishes that I could think of on the top of my head. There is more to Sudanese cuisine! :)

There are similarities between these experiences but they are not the same. I will never know how it feels to not know your heritage and the pain that comes with it.    Also being Sudanese American is complicated because Sudan is part of the Arab world ( whether Arabs agree with it or not). I identify closer with being Arab American than being Black American.  On paper, I usually check Black because usually the description says that you can check it if you are of African descent. It makes life easier for me.   I love this question."

First the sexual abuse, then keeping the secret, then speaking out, and finally going through a trial.   Seeing your father and sexual abuser on the dock must have been so hard.   Possibly a roller coaster of feelings and emotions.  I hope you will be able to overcome this terrible ordeal and go on with you life.   You have all my respect and admiration. You deserve it 💙"

AMA,3add79,DenryM,1 point,Fri Jun 19 21:07:40 2015 UTC,Thank you! My older brother and I luckily keep in contact. But my younger sister and cousins (all under age 9) I won't be able to reach out to until their adults as their parents won't let me see them.
AMA,3add79,TheSuperChronics,7,Fri Jun 19 21:13:27 2015 UTC,What made you come out about it now? Still in touch with him? Does he feel remorseful ?
AMA,3add79,DenryM,27,Fri Jun 19 05:41:49 2015 UTC,"That's one of the questions I was constantly asked when I first told my guidance counselor. And my answer is always the same: does it matter? I never understood the significance of finding out why exactly I spoke out when I did and I don't think I'll ever really question why. I'm just glad I did.  I am no longer in touch with him and I have not spoken to him or really anyone on my dads side of the family in two years. However, this is not my choice. They choose to block me out of their lives willingly.  As far as I know, he is not. He went as far to plead not guilty in the trial and somehow managed to convince the rest of my family (according to my older brother) that I was lying about it all. He has not reached out in any way in the past two years. He also fought against the 8 months of child support he was supposed to pay after I was taken out of his custody, which he still has not paid in full."
AMA,3add79,TheSuperChronics,5,Fri Jun 19 05:55:21 2015 UTC,"I don't think asking the question is always about questioning your credibility. I'm sure it was terrifying to speak up and that many people go their whole lives without ever coming forward about abuse. I'm sure abused children often don't want to rock the boat. I'd be interested in knowing what events or internal processes helped you overcome the fear. Was there any one moment where you realised that speaking up was the right course of action for you, or was it something that's been building up all along and one day just reached a tipping point? Did you have an ""aha"" moment where you were just like ""Fuck this, enough. I need to speak up!""? How did that happen? What set you on the path to finding the courage and overcoming to fear?"
AMA,3add79,bpoag,5,Fri Jun 19 08:23:27 2015 UTC,"I never really had an aha moment. I was going to a guidance counselor through my school since freshman year just to vent out about my life to a third party. But these counselors cycled out every year so I never really formed a bond with any. My senior year counselor was a very sweet woman and I trusted her very quickly. When I told her about what happened, it kind of just slipped out. If I had to answer what made me come forward now, it's just that I finally came to terms with what happened instead of trying to see if it would go away.   I was never scared of my dad, before or after. In all honesty, he treated me even better afterwards (I assume) out of guilt. And once the initial joy of that wore off, that I was finally getting attention from my dad (as a middle child, this was amazing), I realized it was wrong. If anything, I felt more disgust for my dad than fear of judgement for talking about it.  Part of this was also because of my little sister, who was 5 at the time and slept in the same room as my dad and stepmom. Ultimately, even if I didn't fully realize it when I spoke up, it was for her safety."
AMA,3add79,Pongpianskul,2,Fri Jun 19 16:33:26 2015 UTC,That's super messed up. I'm sorry.
AMA,3add79,Firefoxray,2,Fri Jun 19 13:38:53 2015 UTC,"I am no longer in touch with him and I have not spoken to him or really anyone on my dads side of the family in two years. However, this is not my choice. They choose to block me out of their lives willingly.   Do not take it personally.  He's most likely (or rather, obviously) told them that you lied and they are ""blocking you"" for it.  He is trying to save his reputation, and based on his wife being in denial, it's clear he didn't tell her it was true.  Or else she would have nothing to be in denial about, with no contrary evidence."
AMA,3add79,Firefoxray,3,Fri Jun 19 18:18:39 2015 UTC,"I'm sure of that. I remember the night it happened, he used the excuse that he thought I was my stepmom. He then said that he'd tell he about ""the situation."" When she came in, her reaction was more or less, ""Well I heard something happened...it's okay let's just move on.""  I later found out that he only said that he ""hugged"" me thinking I was her. Her confession of that on the first night of questioning (which she later denied saying) was what ultimately pushed the verdict in my favor."
AMA,3add79,bobjoeman,4,Fri Jun 19 21:05:42 2015 UTC,"Thanks for replying. Must be tough but keep trucking!   I think it's the most common question, cause after a certain time, people begin to question credibility. If it really affected someone so much, you'd think they would come out right away to try and fix it. Again, I have no experience with this and understand it's very difficult so this is just my perspective.   Kind of like Bill Cosby. I feel bad for the guy with all these women accusing him. We don't know if he did it, but after one comes out, then more and more follow. It's only normal to think the victims would want justice  ASAP. This isn't a common situation so why it makes it tricky for someone to come out right away, which I understand. But then after more accusations come after a certain amount of time, people begin doubting if it really affected someone so much then they'd want to fix it quickly   Thank for replying!"
AMA,3add79,AllisonRages,4,Fri Jun 19 06:07:10 2015 UTC,"What??? You are basing this on nothing. The vast majority of victims of rape and sexual assault do NOT speak up because they want it to go away as soon as possible. the less they think about it the better. The justice system is notoriously bad abt treating sexual assault victims with respect, and often coming out about it leads to becoming ostracized by people who like the rapist, like with OP's dads side of the family. Imagine this on a national or international scale when you consider how many people love bill Cosby and refuse to believe he can do evil. Of course all those women were scared to come forward when they thought they were alone."
AMA,3add79,AllisonRages,0,Fri Jun 19 15:55:15 2015 UTC,"Can you read?   Like I said, this is my perspective. I said I have no experience with this so difficult for me to understand.  And it's an opinion many people hold. I'm not the only one who wonders why people come out years later"
AMA,3add79,MonokuroMonkey,3,Fri Jun 19 16:14:36 2015 UTC,"But its NOT a perspective, its an assumption. ""Rape victims should want to get help right away"" is An assumption that does real actual harm to victims every day. Its 2015, you have the entire internet at your fingertips. When you wonder about something like that you have the ability to look it up and learn about things from professionals and primary sources instead of making shit up and assuming it's right because its your perspective. Your ""perspective"" is literally wrong and harmful. Plenty of people have answered that question and all it takes is a Google search to answer it."
AMA,3add79,MonokuroMonkey,-2,Fri Jun 19 16:47:43 2015 UTC,"Dude chill out... It's just my opinion. There's no right or wrong   Maybe instead of perspective I should have used my opinion, or my point of view, or my view on things... Relax   Edit: I clearly state it's a tough situation and hard to fully understand unless you're a victim. I have no clue what you're rambling about  There is not only one perspective to anything"

AMA,3add79,abc03833,2,Fri Jun 19 19:20:02 2015 UTC,"The first night was actually the day before my 15th and he was drinking with my older brother. My older brother passed out in my room and my dad didn't want me to be around him ""just in case."" So I slept in his room along with my stepmom and little sister. When sleeping there, he digitally penetrated me (fingering) and eventually told me to go to my room where I assumed he'd allow me to go to bed. However he followed me there and continued to strip, fondle, and digitally penetrate me once more. It was not until I finally spoke up and said, ""Dad what are you doing?"" That he stopped and left. I locked myself in my bathroom and he continuously asked to talk to me, telling me that he thought I was my stepmom, etc.  The second time we were in a hotel for my little sister's hula competition. I was sleeping on the couch, my dad in one bed, and my stepmom and little sister in another. He asked me to go to the bed and I assumed he would take the couch. He did not and the same actions were repeated.   It wasn't until a year later that I came forward to my school counselor who told my principal who told child services. He was arrested that night and I lived with my mom from that day on."

I'm on my phone so I can't cite anything, but psychological studies have essentially proven that patients don't truly believe their own stories of multiple personalities, and they are not consistent with other legitimate delusional conditions. For example, a  schizophrenic probably wouldn't make an AMA about what it's like to be completely disconnected from reality whilst in the throes of his condition.   It's kind of like a deep and elaborate cry for help.  It's also sometimes used to farm karma."

AMA,3agr3m,Picnic_Basket,1 point,Sat Jun 20 16:46:32 2015 UTC,"The Game: Penetrating the Secret Society of Pickup Artists:       The Game: Penetrating the Secret Society of Pickup Artists (also known as The Game: Undercover in the Secret Society of Pickup Artists) is a non-fiction book written by investigative reporter Neil Strauss as a chronicle of his journey and encounters in the seduction community.  The book was featured on the New York Times Bestseller List for two months after its release in September 2005, reaching prominence again in 2007 during the broadcast of the VH1 television series The Pickup Artist, which was hosted by Mystery, Strauss's mentor in the book.   In its original published hardcover format, the book was covered in black leather and bookmarked with red satin, similar to some printings of the Bible. Despite the reputation that The Game has gained as an exposé on the seduction community, it was primarily written as an autobiographical work. The follow-up book, Rules of the Game, relies more on the how-to side.    Image i     Relevant: Neil Strauss | Pickup artist | Rules of the Game (book)   Parent commenter can toggle NSFW or delete.

AMA,3agr3m,Picnic_Basket,1 point,Sat Jun 20 09:17:13 2015 UTC,"Do you view this as no big deal, or is it something that weighs on you a lot? Do you think you lack an ability to turn a platonic relationship/encounter into something physical/sexual, or is it easy for you to flirt with and kiss girls?  I also was a relatively late bloomer. For me personally, and perhaps not admirably, alcohol was the game-changer. Drunk Me is working on a respectable tally, but Sober Me has probably one instance of initiating the first sexual experience with a girl."
AMA,3agr3m,Picnic_Basket,1 point,Sun Jun 21 02:06:45 2015 UTC,"it weighs on me only  if i submit myself into situations where it's relevant...but at this point, i try not to think about it.  i don't know what it is really and i'm not going to go ahead and ask every girl i've dated what's wrong with me. i just don't have the patience for that at this point."
AMA,3agr3m,MonokuroMonkey,1 point,Sun Jun 21 03:58:31 2015 UTC,"You're only 24 though, so I'm not sure I would give up on having the patience to be introspective. I can relate to avoiding situations where this topic comes up, so I wouldn't fault you for that.  But you must have some ideas about what the problem is right? For me, I think part of it was I tended to stick to pretty safe, neutral topics when talking to women. That was fine if the goal was to be a likable guy to chat with on occasion, but if I wasn't going to flip the switch at some point, then it wouldn't even occur to them to think about dating me or going back to my place.  Might be something similar, where if you're not naturally oozing sexual attraction, you have to consciously steer the conversation and activities to something that isn't just standard water cooler chat.  Again, this is where the situations where drinking was involved seemed to really open things up. I was a lot more at ease and I can naturally be pretty funny when I just let things go and live in the moment. The combination of being warmer, funnier, more outgoing and confident and more effortlessly doing flirtatious actions or gestures completely changes the dynamics."

Favorite trait?: Would it be totally wrong to say I love that I can flirt my way out of anything? Because I can and I've always liked that aspect of me (It's gotten me out of a lot of trouble, after all.)   -Confusing about men?: The fact that so many of them don't think they're crazy too!

I start my graduate internship in the fall, so I'm taking the summer off  -Greatest dream/goal?: I don't know yet...winning the lottery would be nice.

Flirting is a great deal of fun, especially in social situations.  and charm has always helped me out, nothing wrong with helping yourself.  -Confusing about men?:  Oh. That is a good one!  Very true.    -Greatest triumph?:  Wow, that is fantastic!  Make good use of that time.  Do you rock climb or trek?    -Greatest dream/goal?: Survivor.

Tell you what, I'll be your right hand just cause i want to see you win.  As long as you're nice, of course. :)    So, honest girl, sheet would you say of a man who is planning to rock climb in California then deep sea fish in Alaska, then sail to new Zealand?

I have felt terribly ashamed and lonely because of these feelings and knowing they aren't reciprocated. It hurts to be totally honest.  What I'll do is probably cry deeply after getting rejected (99.5% chance), eat some ice cream, then move on with my life. If he surprises me, I'm not really sure what I'll do. I guess I'd see if he felt the same way about me, and work from there.  I'll be telling him in 2.5ish hours  I'm planning just to be honest as possible, tell him how I feel, let him have time to digest it, and go from there. I'm kinda just in the ""it'll be what it is"" area with this.  And I certainly can leave an update."

AMA,3abez9,artingerbill,3,Thu Jun 18 19:05:40 2015 UTC,"Our agency was very much focused on keeping regulars. I never saw a client that was using the agency for the first time. There were a few incidents, largely with outcalls and men not respecting boundaries. Shoving fingers up my bum unannounced was a typical one.  Men would often test me and try and push limits, it was just a case of learning how to handle them."

AMA,3abez9,fazshara,2,Thu Jun 18 19:49:09 2015 UTC,"Did you work in a place where prostitution is legal?   Prostitution is essentially legal in the UK, but the laws around it are complicated.   What drove you to it?   Financial problems.   Did you view clients with contempt, apathy, professional distance, something else?   The clients varied massively. Although I did form the opinion quite early on that a lot of them could be quite two faced and under handed. Some of them were adept at playing the agency against the women working for it, when they felt they weren't getting everything they wanted.  Contempt was not really a useful emotion, a few of the other women tended to have that attitude the clients picked up on it and ultimately it made things harder for them. Apathy and some sort of professional distance wouldn't work either because you have to stay engage and in control."

In the old fashioned sense, no school I know of uses fags anymore.  The last one is a big moral problem for me. My parents were brought up under the poverty line and worked really hard to be able to have enough money and security to give my brothers and I such a good childhood. They say they want to invest in our education, and I respect and am grateful for that decision. However, I recognise that I have a large advantage over many people. My belief that is that we need fundamental change in our whole education system. For example I would support the reintroduction of grammar schools, and believe that people should be given different support in relation to their abilities, which does not currently happen. If and when that happens, I would happily reenter state education. So I think we should start levelling the playing field from the very beginning, rather than just saying give more favour to state schools."

I do think you're right about state education needing an overhaul - I was lucky to attend an amazing state school but still feel slight ire at the idea of private schools (and their financial barrier) but that's mostly the cost barrier.   My father attended a good private school in Cambridge (purple and black) but went on scholarship and he found it good educationally if not socially and it launched and him into an Oxbridge education, and I've seen many state educated friends succeed without the push but that's all outside London where to make it it seems you need both contacts and financial backing.

AMA,3a7l8h,LauraMG,3,Thu Jun 18 02:08:20 2015 UTC,Spoke with the international producers about being the subject for an hour long IHH renovation show. We decided against it because they only paid $4K and we had to be on their schedule. Didn't want to be exposed to the world through the process for only 4K. I had a fantasy that lots of products and design would be included. They were very nice.
AMA,3a7l8h,SeagraveHolmes,2,Thu Jun 18 03:15:09 2015 UTC,They pay you?! I was under the impression that you pay them! Where was your international hunt and how'd it turn out?
AMA,3a7l8h,SeagraveHolmes,1 point,Thu Jun 18 05:19:20 2015 UTC,"Yes they do pay. It just wasn't enough to make it worth worrying about their schedule, and being on camera. If they had paid more, or offered building products or appliances, we might have tried to move forward with them.  As it turns out, we are also dealing with massive delays with our closing. We have moved to Baja. The Mexican real estate world is much different than the US. We have a contract on one home, hired architects, and have complete plans for total renovation, but because the delays we are again looking around. Just put an offer into another home yesterday. HGTV requests you are available a number of times throughout your renovation and that it is completed within their production schedule. Even if we had closed and could have completed in time, 4K just wasn't enough to make us want to do it."

Yep I'm from the UK, the surgery was remarkably non-invasive, it was all done in about 20 minutes under local anaesthetic, so just numbed the area then did it all.  I had the option to be sedated but I decided against it and didn't really feel any pain apart from the initial local anaesthetic needle!  The doctors are trying to rule in (or out) a certain kind of arrhythmia, I've got a myriad of other symptoms but one of the main ones is recurrent palpitations and dizzy spells so they want to try to pin down the cause if they can before working out the best treatment.  Thanks for the questions!"

Also with the stitches I could sort of feel the friction of the thread going through my skin, it didn't hurt at all but felt pretty weird!"

I think the data transfer must be via bluetooth or at least some kind of radio transfer, I also have a small box that can take the data from the recorder then be attached directly to their computers.  There is a newer model of recorder that's only going through trials at the moment in the UK that is quite a bit smaller, around the size of a AAA battery.

With the model I have I can't in real time, but if I feel any symptoms and record them myself I then have to be seen within 24 hours for them to read the data. It also does automatic recordings which I can't tell are happening if it detects something itself,  so they'd be read at one of the check ups I'll have every couple of months.  Have you been to a doctor about your palpitations? Maybe you could have an external monitor fitted for a week or two if your palpitations are frequent enough. Hope you're doing okay!  Edit: On a smaller model of internal loop recorder that's not available properly yet in the UK, but is in the US I believe, you can upload the data in realtime over 3g I think?!

AMA,3a7jjy,HalfBakedTurkey,6,Wed Jun 17 22:43:20 2015 UTC,Are you the stereotypical pastor's daughter? I dated a pastor's daughter in school. She was a nymphomaniac. We had sex three times a day most days.
AMA,3a7jjy,PUBLIQclopAccountant,3,Thu Jun 18 00:15:00 2015 UTC,"So is the stereotypical pastor's daughter a nymphomaniac? I've heard a lot of stereotypes, but that is a new one! I would have to say an emphatic no to that one. In fact, I believe very strongly in abstinence. I know, huge surprise. While we are totally for contraceptives (unlike the Catholics), I want to save my body for my husband. Sex is a really special and powerful thing, so I have no desire to engage just any guy in it. On top of that, I've known too many girls who have been absolutely destroyed by sex, even when they were ""protected."" Turns out boys can be real jerks and mess up a girl's life pretty badly with sex. In my logic, I will have a far better experience when I have sex with my husband who has also waited for me because I will love and trust him. I also totally understand that in our society, this isn't a particularly popular view. This is just how I see it and so far, it's worked out beautifully for me! No sexually transmitted diseases for this girl!"
AMA,3a7jjy,PUBLIQclopAccountant,2,Thu Jun 18 02:01:06 2015 UTC,Do you actually believe that stuff?
AMA,3a7jjy,hunter0328,4,Wed Jun 17 23:31:19 2015 UTC,"Let's get a little more specific: Do I believe that there's an angry, resentful god out there who is just waiting for me to have fun so he can pour out his wrath on me? No. Do I believe that there's a God out there who loves me so much that He wants to have a personal relationship with me and take care of me? Absolutely."

Even though we've never discussed it, I know that if I even stepped foot into a bar or club I'd be in huge trouble. Then again, in a small, town, that's not too big of a worry!

AMA,3a7jjy,thewalkerbait,2,Thu Jun 18 02:06:07 2015 UTC,"Bad: Smoking, drinking, having wild and unprotected sex at every opportunity, sneaking out late at night, partying till the wee hours of the morning.  Good: Doing boring stuff. I guess I'm a good one.  I mean, I have a job, I got into a good college on scholarship, I don't do stupid things very frequently, and I really like The Office. And sometimes, when I'm really edgy, I climb out my window and sit on the roof. Yeah, I know. I'm pretty cool. Yes, I'm a ""good one."" But I've met plenty of the bad ones, too!"

AMA,3a7jjy,JDeelish,1 point,Fri Jun 19 17:27:27 2015 UTC,"I've met several girls who would fall into the ""bad"" category that I laid out above. I'm sure you've also heard about them. For some reason, people really enjoy hearing how pastor's kids mess up."
AMA,3a7jjy,JDeelish,1 point,Thu Jun 18 01:46:56 2015 UTC,"I can tell you why people ask you this question, the simple answer would be movies, movies, series or stories just want to turn the pastor's daughter into a girl that has such cropped up sexual feelings, that she turns into a nymphomaniac with an entire list of fetishes.  They do this because it is interesting, and also because they think that that is what happens to people that are not allowed to do these bad things.  (It's not so much the pastor's daughter, it's more a 'religious girl', also here's an example)  Another reason why people consider it typical is because of human rebellion, people expect a pastor's daughter to be controlled by her father to not do any of the bad things, and then when she gets old enough, she will do the opposite of everything he had forbidden before, thus doing all the bad things."
AMA,3a7jjy,gabeiscool2002,1 point,Thu Jun 18 02:09:20 2015 UTC,Thanks so much for that explanation. That really makes sense! But it's really twisted and warped. Just because my parents didn't let me do stupid stuff when I was young doesn't mean I'll start doing stupid stuff when I'm older. I think this is how most people were raised!
AMA,3a7jjy,liptonlee,2,Thu Jun 18 02:34:41 2015 UTC,"Well there are a lot of people who specifically do stupid stuff because they were told not to (Especially smoking and drinking).  It's somehow just human nature to be rebellious and that shows through in our media.  But to be fair, I have no idea why people do that either."

When that's done I can do whatever I want. The fire fighters do have tasks but everyone here seems to be in pretty good spirits.   On days with no fire, I literally only do about a hours worth of work during my ten hour shift.   I should also note that when this contract is up I'll leave and probably come back next year. In the off season I'm back at our shop maintaining our fleet of about 25 helicopters or I can go out on another contract that's usually PG&E or DOJ."

On days with no fires I start my day at 9am at the base by preflighting the helicopter and making sure its ready to go. After that the day is pretty much mine.   I spend it by hanging with the USFS fire crew. They're all pretty easy going and laidback. Most of them are ski bums in the winter and fire fighters in the summer. Sometimes I'll do PT with them in the mornings if they're doing a hike. Back at the base, I'll read, play horseshoes, or nap in the napping room. We've also got a Risk game here and it has been amazing at time killing.   About a half hour before the end of the day I'll put the bird to sleep by covering the inlet and exhaust and tieing all the blades down. Then its off to the hotel to do the same thing tomorrow."

I can appear more distressed than I really am, and I can use a variety of other emotional technighes to get my way. I 'm very charming, and I'm good at reading people.

I don't care about a lot of people, but the people I care about (maybe 2 people) I really care about. But they tell me that I'm a cold person. How would you stop that?

AMA,3a2d6a,Asprightlychickadee,4,Tue Jun 16 18:26:48 2015 UTC,"I mean I would like to attribute it to stress but I'm just not sure. I think of myself at pretty neurotic and I can't help but run through things in my head as they're happening. I think that takes my head out of the game and with it, my erection!  Yes I have been to a doctor. I actually wanted to discuss the mental side of things with him to see of he could give me guidance on things to try to stop thinking so much. However, he just prescribed me some viagra (sildenafil I think my version is called). He said to give that a go and stop / start it to see if it helps me to stop worrying about not getting an erection as we're starting foreplay (always my first thought...).  It did work, and extremely well I might add (wow!) But it was never a long term fix.   I've had sex with my girlfriend a good few times now without the V, but I can't stay hard for long enough for my gf to cum and I usually end up getting 'home' first which is starting to affect our relationship. She's great though. I told her early on and she's been good with it so my first bit of advice to anyone would be to talk about it so it's not so taboo.   It's always going to be a sore subject and tends to be fairly distressing when it happens but you gotta keep trying I think!"

High on methamphetamine and forced to go through withdrawal ""cold turkey,"" Yarris was desperate to get out. While in the intake unit, he became aware of the murder of Craig from reading a newspaper left in his cell.  His desperation had taken him over the edge. He decided to concoct a scheme to be released. He thought if he told the police that he knew who the murderer was and was willing to cooperate in the investigation, they would release him.  He told the police that a drug-buddy, an acquaintance he believed had recently died of a drug overdose, had committed the murder. His story backfired when it turned out his drug-buddy was still very much alive and had an airtight alibi (it had been the buddy's brother who died of an overdose). Once again, Yarris was placed in solitary confinement.  Police then ""leaked"" to known motorcycle gang members housed in the same unit as Yarris, that he was a snitch. The act was designed to break Yarris, or worse. After less than a week of constant attacks, Yarris tried to hang himself, but failed. He was sent to the hospital in restraints for a short while, until Sergeant Gerald Murphy had him returned to maximum security.  Wearing only boxer shorts, Yarris was placed in a cell with a bare mattress. It was January, freezing cold, and he was again subjected to verbal, urine and water attacks from the outlaw gang members. After three days of such torture, Yarris asked to speak with Murphy, hoping for at least some clothes and a blanket. Murphy encouraged Yarris to ""tell the truth"" about the crime, to get himself out of the mess. Beaten down and weak, Yarris posed a hypothetical question to the sergeant: ""What if""he was a participant in the crime, but not in the murder? Would this be good enough? Murphy took the statement to the investigators and the next day Nicholas Yarris was arrested, based on Murphy's statement.  The attacks from the motorcycle gang members stopped once they learned that Yarris was charged with murder. At that point, he was also given clothes and a blanket.   Nice.  Jesus I just read the rest of this article...public attorneys refusing to act because they didn't want to ""alienate"" the judge, two writs of Habeas Corpus denied.  When having some delicate and extremely important biological evidence transported, some detective just kept it for two years and when Yarris attempted to have the court force the detective to turn it over he was denied.

AMA,3a04f2,Emplice,9,Fri Jul 3 21:19:48 2015 UTC,Do you believe in the afterlife and a higher purpose to life?
AMA,3a04f2,mrsyarris,28,Wed Jun 17 00:09:10 2015 UTC,"You know, I believed in that stuff for a while on death row, hoping that God would help me, but he didn't. It was a hard working doctor that helped me get released. Why would a caring, all knowing god put me through hell for 21 years for something I didn't do? Because of this, I just don't believe in that stuff. People ""thank god"" when their favorite football team wins, or when they get something they want. There are all these people in other countries, including America, who are just suffering. People who are starving, or being tortured under cruel dictatorships. I just don't believe in it. I don't want this to cause a big argument, so I won't answer any more questions about my religious beliefs, but thank you for your question."
AMA,3a04f2,rampaging_moon_buggy,3,Wed Jun 24 09:04:06 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the answer. I was just curious, as its such an extreme experience that you've had."
AMA,3a04f2,meatboitantan,-15,Tue Jun 16 06:16:09 2015 UTC,"Isn't it very possible that God sent that doctor to help you? Also, had you been released immediately, there's probably a high percentage chance the drug use would have continued and your life would not be as great as you say it is now.   Food for though."
AMA,3a04f2,Kalthia,15,Tue Jun 16 16:55:28 2015 UTC,"If god was going to help me, he sure could have done it a lot sooner. As for the drug use thing, all I really did was smoke weed, meth wasn't something I did a lot, and I was going to quit soon afterwards. I have no problem with weed, though I still don't do it anymore."
AMA,3a04f2,chinamanbilly,9,Tue Jun 16 17:09:16 2015 UTC,What the fuck are you talking about?
AMA,3a04f2,rampaging_moon_buggy,3,Tue Jun 16 17:22:49 2015 UTC,Were you given an approximate date for execution? Were you confined to your cell 24 hours a day? Did you mix with other death row inmates/prisoners? How are you now and how long did it take for you to adjust to freedom? I can't imagine what you went through all those years inside when you were innocent!!
AMA,3a04f2,kagurawinddemon,7,Tue Jun 16 17:39:42 2015 UTC,"I wasn't given an approximate date, and I wasn't forced to be confined for 24 hours, I chose to, though, and they just handed me my food in my cell. I didn't make friends with other prisoners, because most of them were just brutal, and I wasn't as sick as any of them were. I'm doing good now, I'm a millionaire after receiving a large settlement, and now I'm living in England with a wife and daughter. Even after being released, it still took me a while to feel like I was really free. And, I've said before on here how brutal it was. Trust me, those people who actually DID commit brutal murders really deserve to be there. It's awful."
AMA,3a04f2,kagurawinddemon,1 point,Wed Jun 17 20:09:00 2015 UTC,"Thanks for answering  Probably a good choice not to mix with people who are nothing like you (as in: they are monsters)  So very happy for you now to hear about you're new found wealth, although it's a horrible way you became one and you deserve it x 100!!

AMA,3a04f2,JonNYBlazinAzN,3,Tue Jun 16 05:48:42 2015 UTC,"What would you consider to be the least cruel option when it comes to killing inmates on death row?  For those who don't know, the execution methods currently available in the USA are lethal injection, the gas chamber, the electric chair, hanging and in rare cases and only in Oklahoma, a firing squad.    It should be noted that science does in fact offer a perfect killing method. This method is extremely quick, painless, not gory, affordable, effective and even leaves the subject with a sense of euphoria: hypoxia. It is explored in this BBC documentary Despite it's clear superiority, it remains unavailable as a humane execution method. What are your thoughts on this? Some experts believe part of the punishment is that the inmate suffers during their death."
AMA,3a04f2,RoidingOldMan,8,Tue Jun 16 17:17:38 2015 UTC,"Hanging. It is quick, clean, only a second of pain at most, and you can reuse the rope and equipment without using any electricity, which makes it cheaper. I'd say hanging is a very humane option. But if I had to choose my way of execution, without hanging as an option, I would choose electric chair, just because it's quicker and less painful."

AMA,3a04f2,animar37,2,Thu Jun 18 15:11:10 2015 UTC,"Getting shot would be more honorable, and perhaps cooler, if I had the choice I would choose this method as well, but it's not as clean as hanging, and bullets would cost more money, not a lot, but more."
AMA,3a04f2,Menox1944,1 point,Tue Jun 16 07:17:04 2015 UTC,The electric chair is quicker and less painful than other methods? TIL something

Just read about the FIRST guy who was executed with the electric chair, William Kemmler, his execution was HORRIFICALLY botched."
AMA,3a04f2,chinamanbilly,3,Tue Jun 16 22:34:54 2015 UTC,"In most states they dont use gas chamber anymore, because its cruel and unnusual. Seriously look up a description of what happens to a person, its kinda fucked."

I have all that now that I'm a millionaire, and my daughter is hopefully getting into a good college. Life is good now, but I still feel bitter about my past, though, there is nothing I can do."
AMA,3a04f2,safashkan,3,Tue Jun 16 22:35:22 2015 UTC,"sorry if these questions have already been asked, as i only scrolled through briefly..   what was the most extreme thing(s) you saw in prison? how do you not let yourself be consumed with anger / resentment / bitterness etc from being falsely imprisoned and being failed by the justice system? in what ways have you noticed changes in your life before and after being imprisoned?"
AMA,3a04f2,Godzuki17,3,Tue Jun 16 23:34:49 2015 UTC,"The most extreme things I saw in prison were the fights. All these big dudes would just fight each other, while other inmates would bet on who would win, and sometimes even the guards FORCED the inmates to fight for their own amusement. I am sort of bitter and resentful of my past, though I made the mistake of even mentioning the crime, it just wasn't fair, there are people who never get arrested for terrible crimes, and people who spend their whole lives, or get sentenced to death, for crimes that they didn't even commit, and that is not how the justice system is supposed to work. And, before my imprisonment, I was a young, drug using kid who dabbled in weed, LSD, and meth. I certainly wasn't no saint, but I was starting to give up the hard shit, and getting my life together, and after my imprisonment, I could barley function in the outside world for a while, but eventually I finally got my life together, and now I'm doing good."

AMA,3a04f2,The_Shape_Shifter,8,Sun Jun 21 12:19:23 2015 UTC,"Let's see, after I was released, I was picked up by my parents. They gave me some clothes and let me stay with them for a little while, before I got a job and after saving up money I bought a car and started renting an apartment. Soon I sued the county that prosecuted me, and received the settlement. Later, I moved to England, got married, and had a daughter. Life is good now."
AMA,3a04f2,The_Shape_Shifter,4,Wed Jun 24 04:03:09 2015 UTC,"It must have felt SO good when the counties lawyers slid you that paper with the settlement amount. I wouldn't even care about the money.

AMA,3a04f2,Golemfrost,3,Sat Jun 27 10:47:46 2015 UTC,"Oh god, yes. The money is probably the best thing about me spending all those years locked up, other than my family, since I probably wouldn't have moved to England had I not been caught, and would have married another woman."

After all those years, I did all my time in sealed, climate controlled units. They had the air conditioner on,  they had the heat on, but no air. They often changd the filters, so for years I was literally breathing the farts and breath of my fellow prisoners. There was no moisture, and after a while, I just became allergic to fresh air. My first 7 months after my release were torture. I would get headaches just from breathing fresh air, and couldn't stand the sun on my face.

I would says that you should put a lot of efforts on the video. So if you have very little funds, it should be directed at the video.  But do expect to spend a couple of thousand of dollars overall. It should also be proportional to the amount you want to raise. Don<t spend $20k if you want to raise $5K."

AMA,3a210p,tikiorange,2,Tue Jun 16 19:21:49 2015 UTC,"People have a macro view from the media summarizing it as a war under false pretenses, which it was. That doesn't mean that the  command with boots on the ground didn't try to do some good while we were there.  There were a lot of humanitarian missions where we would provide food, water, and medical attention to the people of the city.  This was a city under attack and held hostage by radicals who were beheading people in the streets.  We tried our best to eradicate those people from the city and give it back to the Iraqi people. That was the mission while I was there."

It was Brrrrrrrrt for a whole day.  There were about 3 or 4 cobras lighting it up, to lead the assault.  They took care of whoever was dumb enough to be waiting above ground for us to come in.  Then, we took the city street by street after that.  It was a great scare tactic if nothing else, and super badass to watch."

AMA,3a210p,cosmic_punk,0,Thu Jun 18 10:09:15 2015 UTC,"A large majority would show up to gain intel on us, and go missing soon after, fighting for the other side.  The ones that stayed were complete pussies.  During the battle we would have instances where we needed to run across a courtyard with rounds flying everywhere.  They would refuse to fight or even move because they were scared, and we would be dragging them by the collar to the next checkpoint.  It put us in danger and it was frustrating to think that after the conflict, we would be leaving them in charge of protecting their own areas.  Worthless.  It's almost no surprise that the town went back to the control of the insurgency."

AMA,3a3u9h,steggler,1 point,Wed Jun 17 02:47:05 2015 UTC,"TL;DR There's this girl in my class that I like. And then, there's this guy who's one of my good friends. And then they started dating.   It's kinda hard to explain this to people I don't know or people who don't know them personally.   So, basically, there's that girl. Her name's Ali. I've liked her for the past few weeks. I hang out (or at least used to) with her during lunch break, becoming good friends with her and her friends. So then, I told one of her good friends that I like her. She said that I should tell Ali about my feelings. So, I was planning to, and two days before I was going to tell her, MJ asked her to the school dance (which was a few days later.) That day, I had a bad day. After the dance, they started hanging out more. Skip later until yesterday, where my heart dropped so much. It was the end of gym class.   Here's some stuff to consider first.   Ali now knows that I like her.  My friend now knows that I like her too.  We're still friends.  Now here we go again.  It was the end of gym class, we were discussing about one of my other friends, and then my friend made a joke about Ali cheating on him. Then, she said the worst thing she could say in front of me:  ""I love you."" (To my friend, of course.)   That day, my heart felt like it broke into a million pieces. I told Ali's friend what happened, and also to some of my friends too. I then realized I would do, until the last day of school. I realized that Ali would only cause me heartbreak, if I kept hanging out with her, so today I stopped hanging out with her. She worried about me today, so I had to explain it to her. I also chose to not speak much at school anymore, because during this time, everybody's talking about relationships. I'm still going to do this. I'm asking for support."
AMA,3a3u9h,CommanderEwok,1 point,Wed Jun 17 03:02:36 2015 UTC,"You did the right thing by stopping hanging out with her because it would hurt you. If she was ever a friend, she would be able to appreciate that. She might like the attention, and want you to hang out with her under some pretense that you should be able to be her friend without wanting to be in a romantic relationship. This runs opposite of your best interests, and you should not be swayed by it.   You spent a few weeks infatuated with her. It might take that long for you to 'get over' her. In the mean time, there has got to be some other girl you find interesting, try striking something up with her.   You're doing great so far, telling your buddy how you felt about this girl, and telling the girl. You don't want to start losing friends over romantic relationships, especially if there is no wrong doing on the part of your friend.   Just remember that she said she loved your friend in front of you if you ever start to question your current direction. It should keep you on this path, and eventually you will get over Ali, you will still have your friend, and you will be more mature for all of it."
AMA,3a3u9h,steggler,1 point,Wed Jun 17 03:25:04 2015 UTC,"Hey, thanks for the advice. But, I didn't like Ali just for her looks. I loved her personality too. It'll probably be hard for me to find another girl who has a great personality and good looks again."
AMA,3a3u9h,jiihooh,1 point,Wed Jun 17 11:34:04 2015 UTC,"I know it feels that way, and to some extent it's true. Just remember you are 12 going on 13. You have only been interested in girls for a little while, hell you have only been interested in Ali for a few weeks.   Put that into perspective man. A few weeks out of your lifetime. Learning how to cope with unrequited love is going to help you a lot in the future. The pain you go through now should make you wiser and more self aware.   All I'm saying is, be open to the possibility of finding another girl. You don't have to go out actively seeking a girlfriend right now while your wounds are fresh, but if the opportunity presents itself, don't fear getting back on that relationship horse."

AMA,3a3kin,_Boo_,1 point,Wed Jun 17 01:06:20 2015 UTC,What was the career/education path going from being 27 to your current job? Are there a lot of similar paying jobs available?
AMA,3a3kin,_Boo_,2,Wed Jun 17 09:06:50 2015 UTC,"IT sales for 16-18 years and steadily moved into more strategic roles. No education beyond high school.   Regarding similar jobs - tons. It certainly takes building experience but IT sales is quite a lucrative industry. I'm not referring to working at consumer-facing companies - I mean firms like EMC, VMware, Cisco, Microsoft and dozens of other application, analytics, cloud and IT startup companies. If you have a knack for sales then you can even start in the IT VAR (value added reseller) world where you really cut your teeth then steadily move to the manufacturer side of the business.   Most early IT sales jobs can easily be in the $80-100k range and, depending on your success/drive, you can work your way into more enterprise roles that have starting pay packages of say $180-225k."
AMA,3a3kin,Kalthia,1 point,Wed Jun 17 12:34:21 2015 UTC,How would you recommend someone get started on this path?
AMA,3a3kin,Kalthia,1 point,Wed Jun 17 12:36:48 2015 UTC,"Would recommend you first understand if you're interested/curious about people in general.  Building relationships with people is a life skill that will take you far - in sales it's essential, especially corporate sales where you're selling to businesses vs. consumers.    Next, if you're interested in the IT industry, what specific technology are you interested in?  Network, compute, storage, apps, etc.  I'd approach some local VAR's in your area and talk to the area managers about opportunities for you to learn.  It might be an inside sales role or someone who does quoting.  I started in that kind of role - they're not the greatest roles but definitely a great way to get a lot of experience.  IMO, times at bat are the best way to learn how to deal with lots of different people, scenarios, sales deals, responses, challenges, etc.  Happy to give you some company names if I knew your general area."

I don't speak French. When we say ""aboot"" it sounds more like ""aboat"" haha. I've never learned how to skate, and I'd probably severely hurt myself if I tried.   I think all of the stereotypes are pretty funny and some actually do have some merit. I do find we are a friendly people, and yes we do apologize a LOT. It's more manners than it is fear of upsetting someone.   I'm tired of the ""free health care"" speech though because technically it isn't free. We pay into our health care system with taxes. Also, a lot of things aren't covered 100%. We do have private health care coverage available to cover those things that aren't included in the universal health care. Things like optometry, dentistry, chiropractic care and prescription medication are not free. And frankly, our hospitals aren't very great with wait times.

AMA,3a00ql,clearysh,1 point,Tue Jun 16 13:34:27 2015 UTC,"Technically, yes. Flying from place to place with alcohol might end with your alcohol being confiscated. Driving from place to place can be a little different. While we do have some borders between provinces, there isn't always someone working them so driving alcohol or tobacco through isn't even known.   Our liquor laws and legal age are different from province to province. Example: in my province legal age is 18, where some places in Canada is 19. Even my neighbouring province is 19 years old.   The selling of liquor is different from place to place too. Some places its government-run vendors ONLY. Then, in other provinces, you could have a supermarket with same-named company selling liquor in another building but in the same parking lot. They just have to keep the two buildings seperate. I've also heard, in some places in Canada you can buy alcohol in convenience stores like 7-11. Which to me, is unthinkable. I'd never see that here."

AMA,39xzc5,illstarttomorrow,1 point,Tue Jun 16 09:51:57 2015 UTC,"So then what does OP mean when she says ""I'm more of an escort""  it sounds to me like she doesn't want to call herself a prostitute, like she thinks it has a more negative connotation."
AMA,39xzc5,Gilahof,1 point,Tue Jun 16 09:55:40 2015 UTC,"The question she was responding to was:   You mentioned you made money - were you more of an escort, then, or just looking for a lot of good times and ended up getting paid for it?   The word ""prostitute"" wasn't mentioned. In the context of the question her saying she was more of an escort indicates to me that it was always strictly business, that she always gets paid for it, not causal sex that she sometimes got taxi fare home for or whatever, I think you could take it more as a confirmation that she absolutely was completely in this for business, rather than fun that somehow became profitable.  But honestly, if you are having sex for money it is all the same thing, the words are just euphemisms. There is no difference in the vast majority of cases between an escort and a prostitute. If they are having sex and money changes hands, it's prostitution. And again, nothing wrong with that at all."

AMA,39xzc5,my-alt,1 point,Tue Jun 16 10:05:58 2015 UTC,"Someone asked elsewhere if she always got paid and she posted that she did, that she didn't do this for free.  She's completely contradictory over the issue of whether she is a prostitute, it some places she says she doesn't consider herself one, OR a sex worker, while elsewhere she explicitly refers to herself a sex worker.  Some escorts have the conceit of ""you only pay for my time, and anything else that happens is something chosen freely between consenting adults"", but she doesn't even have that as she discusses specifically that she charges extra for various specific sex acts.   If she's getting paid for sex, she's a sex worker and a prostitute. She does seem conflicted and somewhat uncomfortable about the whole thing, which is a pity,  I don't think either of those things should have a negative connotation."

AMA,39ttnj,live4lifelegit,3,Sun Jun 14 20:53:15 2015 UTC,"I compose a variety of music and it is what I enjoy most. My favorite genres to compose in are ones filled with emotion. This is normally anything from heavy love ballads to soundtracks.   I'm still getting used to the technical side of things, so my editing is not as good as my compositions themselves. But I plan to upload them once I get in the 'swing' of things (pardon the pun)."

If I want to play a song I've heard, I can usually get the first few notes correct without any extra thinking, but beyond that I have to sit down and write it out. It sounds like BS, but you really do have to feel what note you want to play."
AMA,39ttnj,IAmTheWalkingDead,3,Sun Jun 14 23:44:07 2015 UTC,"Damn, I'm playing the piano for eight years, and I would love to be able to do that. When I hear a simple song I can figure out the melody line, but nowhere near as complex and good as you can probably. Is it trainable? Any tips?"
AMA,39ttnj,IAmTheWalkingDead,2,Sun Jun 14 22:24:57 2015 UTC,"The melody line is considered the easier part to memorise and play, so my tip would be to listen deeply to individual and independent parts that play. Try and imagine different instruments (bass for an example), playing solo in your head. This ability normally occurs to people who began learning an instrument before the age of 6, but can be found in hard working, or strong-minded musicians. To practice it, I would reccommend listening to your favorite tunes, waiting 10 minutes, then try humming the first note of the song. Keep trying and increasing the interval inbetween to improve the skill, and eventually your brain should store notes in your long-term memory."

AMA,39t3wi,themightyboo5h,7,Sun Jun 14 16:52:48 2015 UTC,That is not the case in America. Anyone can be an extra in a film if they are asked or hired to do so. Backstage.com is a good place to look for things like this.   Source: I'm a NYC based actor.

Waffles or pancakes?"
AMA,39v24t,LookAtTheRecluse,2,Mon Jun 15 02:31:44 2015 UTC,"I think the biggest pros all revolve around the great experiences you get to have! Random high school weekends exploring the strip and Fremont, driving around town on summer nights with friends, and everything is open late!  Some cons are definitely the heat, there's always construction, and adjusting to early evenings once you move away! The school system is pretty shitty. I'm pretty certain Nevada has one of the worst education systems in the country. I went to public school, but in the snobby rich area of town so it was considered one of the top PS's. I currently go to school in San Francisco at USF but when I'm home for summers and winters, I live in the suburbs in the Summerlin area with my parents  My friends and I were goofs; definitely into walking around random hotels, especially local ones like the red rock. We'd see movies and go bowling and have bonfires, typical high school stuff, just with a bit of Vegas flare.. Late night drives, scary movie nights, and random tourist attractions I'm not much of a smoker, but no one around me seems to have trouble finding any weed. We're too close to California to have issues with it. Nope! Never played that, and DEFINITELY waffles with extra whipped cream... Much like my hero Leslie Knope."

I didn't want to make fan-games but original games. Scott's story was that he was small at first, building a fan-base very very slowly, and he used his disadvantage to his advantage.

Personally, I have a kind of disgust forwards fat people. There are some fat people I can say ""whatever"" to, those are the elderly.

AMA,39u8ay,sonny411j,1 point,Mon Jun 15 18:54:01 2015 UTC,"I can't speak for my family members because I'm just now getting to work with them and learn the different aspects of the business.  My advice (as someone who's still young, in college, and just now learning the ropes) would be this:   Unless you have the wonderful opportunity of being the next Bill Gates / Steve Jobs / Mark Zuckerman / Elon Musk just land in your lap, go to college. Study business, get a degree. As simple as it might sound, I think people often overlook this. The things I've learned already just working on my bachelor's degree are immense. There is so much planning and preparation that goes into starting/running a business that you wouldn't believe. Go to school, stick it out for the 4+ years, and take it seriously. Start saving as soon as you can. You never know when a genuinely great investment opportunity will jump out at you, and you want to be able to make that investment. Even just put money in bonds/stocks. Look at the market trends. There are certain industries whose performance can be predicted if you know what to look for. I'll give you an example of an investment I should have made: Take-Two Interactive is the parent company of Rockstar Games, the one behind Grand Theft Auto 5, which did great in sales. The stock value for Take Two Interactive DOUBLED in the 12 months leading up to the games release. If I had invested $100k in that stock, I could've walked away with another $100k exactly a year later, just for sitting on my ass doing nothing. That's a pretty comfortable year's salary.  Still kicking myself to this day for that one. Anyway, not to keep rambling on about that, but I guess what I'm saying is just always be aware of opportunities. Find a need. Something that people have a desire for. An empty spot in the consumers' lives that a product (and hopefully YOUR product) can fill. This ties into a lot of other things with a lot more detail that I don't have the time to go into (once again, go to business school).   Honestly, and I'm sorry if this wasn't helpful (because I'm young and inexperienced) but schooling goes a long way. I'd also advise doing little things: reading the wall street journal every day, maybe other business media, and just doing your own self education as much as you can. It's these little things that can give you the edge over the competition or present you with an unexpected opportunity.  Oh, and one last thing: always be ethical and morally upstanding. When I asked my grandfather about the hardest decision he ever had to make in business, this is what he said to me:  (Paraphrased, and keep in mind this was from many many years ago so sorry if it offends anyone) ""A long time ago I owned, and was in charge of running, an ice storage warehouse. We owned the whole building, but subleased parts of it out that we didn't use. One day I leased part of it out to a black man, and shortly after that, a group of the warehouse workers came to me and told me that if that black man didn't leave, everyone who worked there was going to quit. I didn't know what to do. I was stuck between a rock and a hard place. I didn't want to kick him out, but I didn't want to lose all of my employees and end up having to close down. If I new how easy it would have been to find new employees, I never would have kicked that man out. But I did, and I still regret it to this day""."

AMA,39u8ay,Iamabioticgod,1 point,Mon Jun 15 04:59:58 2015 UTC,"The thing is, I'm just now getting to the age of being aware of most of this. I always knew we were well off but never knew exactly to what extent. Also my family is very frugal so no one is driving around in exotic cars or living in mansions. That's half the reason I never knew exactly how wealthy we were. If you saw any member of my family on a day to day basis you'd just think they made a good living, but nothing to the extent of what they have. We all live very much within our means. The hardships come with certain members of my family not helping out the less well off side of my family as well as they could. I'm hoping this will change once I get a little older and have more of the decision making responsibility. That's the major hardship I've experienced, as I sort of land right in the middle of that. On one hand I should be rich beyond my wildest dreams, but on the other I still have to be mindful of what I spend my money on.  At college I live in a townhouse with three roommates that costs us $500 each a month to rent. I drive a used car worth somewhere around $8,000-$10,000. I have a nice camera and computer, and some nice clothes. I'm definitely better off than some people, maybe even most people, but if you saw me, or any member of my family, walking down the street, you would have no idea that we're worth what we are. And sorry if this comes off as being cocky or anything like that, I'm just trying to explain the lifestyle/values that my family has."

These all in turn increase the chance of depression, so in answer to your question; yes."

AMA,39uimi,SoSoSoulGlo,1 point,Thu Jun 18 22:56:45 2015 UTC,"Hey! I found this comment after noticing your AMA.  How did you (and the OP) get tested to find your IQs are such figures as 169 and 173? :)  Results like this are usually produced by tests which use a standard deviation of 24, whereas most tests today use 16 or 15. The inflated score makes for good bragging, which I guess is why Mensa International uses SD=24 :) Actually, though, on a test where SD=24, a result of 172 is equivalent to 145 on a test where SD=15. Both are three standard deviations from the mean.  That said - I too happen to suffer from this malady (IQ 3 SD from the mean). When I dealt with depression as a teenager, it was for reasons similar to those expressed by Mechastronaut: uniqueness, feeling out of place, not being able to relate to most peers growing up. I could relate to some adults, but I was a kid to them.  I find it interesting that you struggle with depression even though you're in the company of good friends you can relate to. Can you identify any other cause in your environment that could possibly contribute to a lack of zest?  How far are you located from the equator? Do you get much sun in the summer?"

I've had a lot of sex, dozens of gf's (few long term of 5+ years), and even a marriage.  I'm here to tell you it's overrated.  You really want to see what sex feels like and for some reason you can't get a girl to do it with? Then go to a place where prostitution is legal and pay for it. You will walk out thinking that was the biggest waste of $200-500 ever, and this is with girls who get paid to fuck and yes they do it better than your average girl.  If you can't justify dropping that much $ on sex, I can tell you that having a gf/wife is going to cost you a lot more than a trip to a prostitute!  You only feel like a loser cuz the amount of shaming put on people who don't do exactly what they do. Soon you should get to a point where you don't give a fuck what ppl think of you and this won't be an issue.

Theres no amount of pretty that can fix a shitty person. Besides, you would wouldn't want to invest your heart and soul into a person that doesn't love you for the person you are, but only for how 'attractive' they think you are. It's not just the ""beautiful"" ppl that find love. ""Average"" people find love and so do ""ugly"" ppl. There is more to you and everyone else than their physical appearance.

That's one bonus; think of an ugly girl's problem - even a successful/rich girl will have a hard time in romance because men don't care so much about finding a provider.  Also, confidence & attitude can overcome more than you think.  One of my good friends I've known since we were 15 is truly an ugly dude.  He's short, had severe acne (now just scars from it), bad teeth, and lost his hairline in early 20s.  This guy has been with more hot chicks than I can count.  I'm an average looking guy and he puts me to shame in both quality (lookswise) and quantity of girls he's been with.  He knows what he is, but he still goes and talks to girls as if he's Chris Pratt.  He gets shot down most the time, but he is happy if 1 out of 50 girls says yes.

AMA,39pj91,randomnumberx,19,Sat Jun 13 16:11:14 2015 UTC,"A few months ago i took a roll of film to get developed at walgs, the machine was dirty and gummy and streaked goo across the negativs, which of course made a defect in the scans and prints. Nobody gave a shit, the mgr said ""oh we can take half off"" I'm like no, these are all ruined, I want a full refund. fuck that Seemed to me the perk of working in photo was a lot of goofing off time."
AMA,39pj91,autopornbot,18,Sat Jun 13 16:01:41 2015 UTC,"The film processors at Walgreens are owned by a third party. Years ago, the third party would send their technicians to do monthly/biweekly maintenance and cleaning. Walgreens decided to cancel the service to cut costs, and put the responsibility on photo technicians.   The photo techs obviously aren't trained well on how to care for the machine. And I doubt half of them even care. Plus, they're given so many other tasks on top of photo tasks, they never have time to do maintenance. When cleaning or maintenance reminders come up on the photo computer, the techs are pretty much encouraged to ignore them.  That's why your film came out bad.   As to the customer service, after the film is processed, all they can really do is discount it or let you have it for free since they ruined your memories. It's a shame.  Edit: actually, there are steps they could take to make sure film comes out okay. They could have ran a test strip of film before yours to make sure it wouldn't get ruined. Obviously they didn't take that precaution.   Again. It comes down to time. I'm sure if a manager saw a tech running a test strip, they'd probably get scolded for using time inefficiently."
AMA,39pj91,acal3589,5,Sat Jun 13 16:17:18 2015 UTC,"I worked in a semi-pro lab for a couple of years. I had to do a minor clean on the film processor each day, and a major one once a week. The print processor was not quite as often, but close. Even then, we would get junk on the film fairly often. We were surely a lot higher volume, but still."
AMA,39pj91,stoneyskyla,7,Sat Jun 13 18:12:28 2015 UTC,"But at your company, I'm sure you were all trained on how the machines actually work. And how film actually works. I have seen photo techs at Walgreens (not my store) who don't even know how film works, and have exposed rolls by pulling all of the film out first, then trying to process it.  At some stores, there's a disgusting pattern of ""not my film, not my problem"" spreading."

AMA,39pj91,HitlerWasASexyMofo,1 point,Sun Jun 14 01:20:09 2015 UTC,"In my personal opinion, I think it has to do with the recent merger with Alliance Boots. Both companies are cutting costs. Most of the Walgreens locations closing have never made profit. Also, 200 out of 8,000+ isn't too many.  I think the stores that are closing have been losses from the start. So not much could have been done to prevent it. Maybe they shouldn't have expanded so fast. I meant, they built a ton of stores in the last two decades. Maybe a little to fast, not enough planning, not enough foresight. There's a lot of factors.  The one thing I loved about my job was making customers happy. Frequent customers, new customers, visitors to the city, anyone. It just really made me happy as well.  If I could do anything, I would be doing tech support. It sounds dumb, and I know its a shitty job most of the time. But I like helping people. And technology is a huge part of my life. So if I can help someone with something they know little about, my day is made.  Thanks for the kind words. Thankfully, Walgreens gave us a lot of notice. And I think everyone at my store felt it coming. Almost all of the staff is transferring to local stores, I'm one of the few who chose severance. Also, I was able to find another job, I'll be fine :D"

AMA,39si3n,rawesome400,1 point,Sun Jun 14 12:09:07 2015 UTC,"First of all I think the whole system hast to be reformed. The Hauptschule has definitely become a school without perspective. You barely have a chance to get a job when you finish it without other qualifications. Then I think that the Abitur is to easy to get now, and so even jobs where you think you wouldn't need it now require the Abitur. NRW in particular is one of the places with the lowest level of education, compared to places like Bayern. I personally like my school, the teacher are mainly nice and helpful and we had a lot of renovations over the last couple of years. :)"

There is a male feet fetish industry but the female industry dwarfs it. I do quite well in the former"
AMA,39opjx,rampaging_moon_buggy,2,Sat Jun 13 08:12:28 2015 UTC,One time on a train journey to London I noticed a big guy couldn't seem to take his eyes off my feet (I'd slipped my sandals off). Is this kind is scenario interesting for a foot fetish enthusiast or is it only when in overtly sexual situations? Sorry I know nothing about foot stuff.
AMA,39opjx,rampaging_moon_buggy,3,Sat Jun 13 10:08:15 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your question! Yes this is an interesting scenario for those who like feet. It's clear he was into feet and checking your feet out, in a natural un-staged setting. Foot fetishists come in all shapes and sizes with different preferences, and many do prefer the ""candid"" or un-staged stuff (some even go as far as to film female feet without consent, which I don't engage in, but there is ample evidence of the popularity of candid foot fetishism online). Personally I would check out a nice pair of feet in public, just as a guy would check out a cute lady, if the feet were on display. It doesn't need to be an overtly sexual situation but having said that, some people can derive sexual satisfaction from things that are seemingly non-sexual"

Looking back I was quite naive at the time, as I decided at one point to wiggle my toes a little to see if he'd look up at me. I don't think I fully cottoned on at the time : D I was just rather pleased as he was good looking he he. The woman I was traveling with still mentions it now. Ah well it was pretty harmless a thing to have happened. It must be very satisfying to have a fetish, or has it ever caused you bother in yourself at any time?"

To me, the general shape of the foot and proportion of the toes, the height of the arch (I prefer a higher arch), as well as the appearance and softness of the soles, is very important. I find many different shapes and proportions sexy, my interest is quite broad. I also delve into the tickle fetish field and a pair of ticklish feet scores higher for me. I dislike toenails that are too short or in bad condition and soles that are too rough."

I go over the slides in between the lecture and the relevant practical.

But I wound up kinda throwing their 'Keep him at the age of his friends' thing in their face - Within 4 weeks my first year teacher phoned my parents and contacted some guy up in the education system about me. They approved me skipping a year, twice. Year 3 and an odd 5-6 technicality.  Edit: Reworded that. I can't shop and reddit at the same time, made me look like I had a huge ego then."

AMA,39n09c,bigdickpuncher,5,Sat Jun 13 03:20:43 2015 UTC,"i'll start with how i can recognise people and work backwards as that's easier to describe. i can recognise people with repeated exposure, in context. so after working with people for a few weeks or months i will be able to tell who they are if they stay close to their work station. gradually i will recognise them away from their desks, and after a couple of years i could reliably identify them if i bump into them in a store. this could work for up to about 8 coworkers. after i stop working in a place this fades steadily, so if i don't see a coworker regularly upon leaving, i will forget them after 6 months or so.   recently i remarried, so there has been a new set of people to become familiar with. i have met my husband's grandmother about 10 times but only 2 of those times were outside her home. so the othrr day we were at a grocery store and i thought i saw her but it wasn't her. 10 meetings in 3 contexts over 2 years was not enough exposure to generalise.   if i am watching a movie and too many characters have a similar ""look"" i can't follow the story very well. i do recognise some celebrities though.   since i am only borderline faceblind i should be able to compensate by remembering names, voices, details. but in general my memory is not good so i can't compensate. i get lost in my own neighbourhood after living there for 5 years.   it is impossible to explain this problem in a manner that doesn't offend or hurt people, so i don't tell them. if someone recognises me in public i just act friendly and answer questions generally. people have thought that something was wrong with me (like that i was upset or stoned) when this has happened though, because i can't always recover well"

Every time a big media company picks up on their local racing group and the video spreads around, we get a whole new batch of noobies on /r/multicopter and /r/fpv it seems.     As for what ive spent I dont like to think about it lol. I am a married, military father, so hobby funding is scarce at home. My Drone (I call it The Red Baron) in particular is a budget build, made with some the cheapest parts and even then I like to think I am a great contender in a race compared to the folks that spend thousands on the sport. So far with my ZMR250 ive probably invested close to $500 - $600 in just the drone itself. Not factoring in my $400 dollar Spektrum DX8 radio, and FPV goggle equipment.    Sponsors are mostly the teams local hobbyshops, and convincing them to sponsor a team can be difficult. The RC Hobby can be expensive, and for a Sponsor to hash out even the most basic of tools and parts needed to assist a team, the shop would still be taking a considerable loss in the free parts when you think of passing our bits to each team member, when teams can range from just 2 dudes up to 15 or 20."

AMA,39lcdi,Palatura,6,Fri Jun 12 15:44:05 2015 UTC,"I've tried to help him since I found out he was doing it. I've been as supportive as I can. Tried detox, rehab, quitting at home, letting him wean... etc. Within the last week I've finally come to realization that he has to want to help himself, that I can't do it for him, and right now he isn't doing anything to help himself. Everyone has their own opinions about the situation, but most people think I'm crazy for still standing by his side after everything he has put me and my children through."
AMA,39lcdi,rawesome400,5,Fri Jun 12 15:50:35 2015 UTC,"You are absolutely right that nothing will be effective until he really and truly wants to help himself.  Unfortunately, especially with a drug like heroin, that probably won't happen until he OD's, or loses someone very dear.  As an addict who has (more or less) tamed his demons, as much as this hurts to say, it will probably take losing you and the kids before he will seriously reflect on what he's doing.  Does your husband work at the moment?"
AMA,39lcdi,rawesome400,1 point,Fri Jun 12 23:01:54 2015 UTC,Even OD's don't really mean shit or losing a loved one to some addicts.  I'm probably considered a terrible person for saying it but I've missed a few funerals due to being either dope sick or having to go pick up.  Yesterday I went and got some dope and banged it.  One minute i'm in the driver seat and the next I woke up some time later in the passenger seat of my car with my friend telling me that my lips turned blue and we we're apparently about to head to t he 'spital.   Today.. shit.  I'm getting high.  Hopefully the cat isn't an idiot like me though and does get his shit together.  Especially having a family and all of that.

AMA,39kqis,ramonpaezrrt,2,Fri Jun 12 14:44:34 2015 UTC,The biggest culture shock for me was how orderly everything is. On the one hand it's good because things run much more smoothly but there's a lot less spontaneity and improvisation. Many Japanese people are reluctant to change plans unless there's no other way. My most memorable student was a girl who told me that she either wanted to be a manga artist or an anime voice actress. She was a very good illustrator and all around wonderful person who was kind to everyone. I went back and forth between being a teacher and joining the army (the professions of my mom and dad respectively). I was rejected by the army on account of my ADHD history so I decided to be a teacher.

Also, many English teachers have spent time in an English speaking country so they are quite familiar with the language.  My students often ask me questions about my dating life.

Some of the directors will try and push them into it. They'll shower them with great words and tell them how great they are. They're slimy, they will cajole young girls who are new to the business and don't have a clue.   That's why it's best to get yourself with an agency (even if a little one) that's been doing what they do for a long time and know what they're doing. It also helps to be headstrong, and not be meek. You really have to be streetwise, educated on the matter and don't be a pushover. If it sounds too good to be true, then it pretty well fucking will be and you should get out of there. Or if you director wants you to do something you didn't agree to on the spot, be firm and tell him NO. Then get the fuck out of there whilst you can."

AMA,39mip6,Hermit_Lailoken,3,Fri Jun 12 22:37:50 2015 UTC,How did you get into the business?   Has the experience of doing porn shifted the way you experience intimacy in your relationship?   What are some of the challenges you and other performers experience while on a shoot?   What have you learned about life and people from your experience performing sexual acts?
AMA,39mip6,Hermit_Lailoken,6,Fri Jun 12 21:24:14 2015 UTC,"Craigslist. I was reading an article on VICE about three months before about porn actresses and how much they can earn. I became interested in it from there, but I didn't act on anything. Anyway, I realised just how broke I was and constantly found myself struggling to have any money to do nice things or to treat myself or my parents or my boyfriend. I then thought about that article. Later on that afternoon I looked on Craigslist for agencies and directors of adult movies and signed up for a handful. I got a load of call backs. I went to about seven interviews and was successful with about three. They were all one-time only shoots, but it helps build your portfolio and many of the directors in the industry know each other, so words can be put in for you. I'm signed with an agency now, so I get work through them.   Yes, in a good way. What I do and what I feel on camera is completely different to what I do and what I feel in the bedroom with my boyfriend. At first I was frightened that sex between my boyfriend and I would become less enjoyable, but it didn't. It enhanced it more than anything, I'd say. When I have sex with my boyfriend, I do it with love. It's an act of pure love between us. On camera, it's just sex. Meaningless sex. With my boyfriend I give it everything. Everything is real. There's emotion. When you're getting fucked meaninglessly so often, there's something wonderful about having sex with someone you actually want to.   My biggest challenge on a shoot is probably getting into it. A lot of the times I'm genuinely not aroused at all. I can get aroused but with a lot of work and mental stimulation of my own. Luckily for me being a female, it's not easy to tell if my arousal is ingenuinie or not. I don't have to hold an erection. Which is what I'd say is a challenge for the male performers. Sometimes they just can't hold the erection. So we'll have to keep stopping and starting. Sometimes you see cutscenes in porn because the guy may have lost his erection. Other than that, I find everything pretty easy so far.   I don't know... There's really nothing deep or life-changing that I have encountered yet. I've really learned just how much people are actually doing porn. I've learned that some people are really desperate for money. I've learned that sex is a powerful thing."
AMA,39mip6,rawesome400,1 point,Fri Jun 12 21:48:02 2015 UTC,"Thank you, this has given me some insight. I am glad that the experience has improved your intimacy. I have read that about the shoots, it's all pretty well business and discomfort. I have read that about the male performers as well.   As for being desperate for money, working retail was for me often a demeaning experience. I made hardly any money and it burned me out. Good for you for earning the big bucks doing something that you like. Agreed, sex is powerful. Have a great day."

I actually have a low sex drive and don't really value sex all that much but oh the money! How hard is it for imperfect average women to get into it?"
AMA,39mip6,BaaGoesTheSheep,3,Fri Jun 12 22:04:53 2015 UTC,"No! Girl, have you seen porn!? Everybody is beautiful to someone, but many of the girls in porn are not good looking at all. A lot don't even have that great bodies. There is something for everyone in porn, regardless. Someone, somewhere has probably got some sort of fetish for something that may not appeal to wide audiences.   No, you don't have to be a ten. Imho, the top porn stars aren't even tens. They're average looking, to me. I consider myself decent looking - by no means a ten, more a 6. I have small boobs and a relatively small butt. My build is very slim. I mean, the better looking you are and the better your body looks, the more work you'll probably get that said, you can still get work if it's not. It's so easy to get into. Well, it was for me.   Low sex drive may make it hard for you. I have a high sex drive (although, that is not why I do it). I value sex, just not porn sex. I think that's important. Sex is valuable when it's with someone you really love and someone you really care about. Other than that it's nothing much. The money is the trap though. Once that first check clears you realise how fucking real it is."
AMA,39mip6,NoOneKnowsMeIhope,3,Fri Jun 12 22:28:01 2015 UTC,Have you ever been legit tuned on during a shoot?  Ever had an on camera orgasm?
AMA,39mip6,powderfresh_,3,Fri Jun 12 22:27:51 2015 UTC,"Very occasionally. I have been turned on and I have had a real orgasm on camera. I mostly get turned on when I'm shooting with super hot girls. The pay isn't as big for girl on girl shoots, but they're usually my favorite.   Because I know that I'm not really romantically interested in females, I feel a little better about doing it and I let myself get more into it. Do you get what I mean? Like when I'm with a really hot girl, I can get right into the sex because I know there's really not a part of me that could be emotionally tied with her. Although I know I love my boyfriend and I'd never cheat on him, I feel more guilty about it when doing guy-girl scenes, because I know I can fall in love with men.  The girls know how to give great head, and when she's cute and she's doing it right, I can't help but be turned on and subsequently orgasm. Hah."
AMA,39mip6,bhafc22,4,Fri Jun 12 23:02:43 2015 UTC,"I will start by not bashing you, but I wanted to share my personal experience. I was your boyfriend at one time except my (ex) girlfriend was a stripper. She was in the beginning process of being a porn star and started off with private webcam shows. Long story short she got into porn, continued stripping and I found out that she was even a prostitute. OP I loved this girl to the moon and back but I felt absolutely destroyed by the fact that she would choose money over me.   But I digress, OP your boyfriend and I shared the same qualities for the women we love. We stay honest, loyal and loving. From my experience you need to understand that you don't deserve him. That just because you're attractive that you can have anyone you want. In reality, your relationships will be with guys that just want ass. Anyone after your boyfriend will be dirty grimy low life's with money. They will grow tired of you and move on.  Where I'm getting at OP is my ex wanted to do what she wanted and I nor anyone was going to change that, After having a child with her tattoo artist and getting herpes i was gone. I recovered tho because her beauty slipped away and her ""career"" fell through. You're 19, you are not grown like you think you are. I seriously hope you understand the type of guy that's in your life.    My ex now has three kids with men she doesn't love and although I still have contact with her, she regrets everything that had happened between us. I seriously wish you the best of luck with your relationship but please take a step back and look at your situation and really look into what you're dragging your boyfriend through."
AMA,39mip6,thorin9,3,Tue Jun 16 20:19:36 2015 UTC,Has your boyfriend watched your porns?  Why do you say you are amateur if you are getting paid for it and since you are signed on with an agency?  your boyfriend clearly is unsupportive.  Do you think he is sleeping around in you since you are on him?   You should hook your poor boyfriend up with some of these girls you meet at these shoots since you are sleeping around hardcore.
AMA,39mip6,vkashen,-2,Sat Jun 13 04:14:55 2015 UTC,"He watched one and he wasn't into it.   I know he isn't ""sleeping around"". Argue it all you want, but I see our relationship as monogamous. If my boyfriend started sleeping with girls/guys on camera and got money for it, I wouldn't give a shit. I couldn't have the audacity to give a shit. If he was happy doing it, I'd be happy he's doing it.   If he told me he slept with a random girl on the streets, then I wouldn't stay with him because THATS cheating. If he wanted another girl involved in a sexual act of ours then by all means I'd be up for it, but he's really not like that."
AMA,39mip6,rawesome400,6,Sat Jun 13 11:13:35 2015 UTC,Does your boyfriend know? What are his thoughts on you doing porn?
AMA,39mip6,such-a-mensch,1 point,Fri Jun 12 20:07:55 2015 UTC,"Hey!  Yeah, he knows about it. Sometimes he'll even drop me to shoots and interviews. Sometimes if I'm doing work out of the state, then he'll come with me too.  At first, he was mad. I told him after my first shoot that I was going to start doing porn and I told him that I did one already. He got really upset - started crying and everything. He said he wanted to spend some time away from me for a little.   After about two days of not speaking, we sat down and had a grown-up conversation about it and I told him that I wasn't going to sacrifice the opportunity I was getting for our relationship. After about five hours of talking, he said that he'd basically just put up and shut up. He's supportive of what I do, but he isn't thrilled about it. Like, he doesn't make me feel shit or bad about it, but he doesn't exactly encourage me to do it. We don't really talk about it that much in detail at all, though - he'll just ask ""Good shoot?"", I say yes/no/okay etc. and then proceed to talk about other things."
AMA,39mip6,u-void,43,Fri Jun 12 20:28:33 2015 UTC,"So you actually already started doing porn before telling your boyfriend that you were going to do porn? I don't know the dynamics of your relationship, but that seems pretty dishonest to me. I personally would have left you for that alone, but to each his/her own. He must be a lot more attached to you than you to him, if you were going to choose money over him.  Do you honestly think that your relationship will last, with him not being all that comfortable with your job? How did you get started and how would your family/friends react if they found out?"
AMA,39mip6,u-void,25,Fri Jun 12 21:51:07 2015 UTC,"I was about to say exactly this, people seem to have overlooked the fact that you did it the first time without telling him, in a ""it's too late now I did it, either you deal with it or you can find someone else, because I value the money more than your feelings"". I am surprised he's capitulated in such a way but love can cause you to do stupid things. Do you ever feel bad for doing that first one prior to your adult conversation?"

AMA,39mip6,cleanedge,8,Fri Jun 12 23:29:02 2015 UTC,"I couldn't agree more. I was stupid enough to stay in a relationship with someone who cheated on me, and of course she did it again. This woman is essentially a prostitute and told her boyfriend that she prefers the money doing the work than him or his feelings, while already in a relationship with him. Wow.  That's got to be the worst kind of cheating. But I guess he's so whipped he lets her control him. He's going to be a very unhappy man down the road, one way or another."

AMA,39mip6,Daloowee,-10,Fri Jun 12 23:50:02 2015 UTC,"I did one porn shoot then told my boyfriend on the night I got home that I did it and that I will continue to do it. I never lied to him, so there was no dishonesty. If he asked me and I denied it; that's dishonesty.   Like you say, each to their own. He isolated himself from me for two days after I told him (I don't blame him) and then we came together to try and see where we'd go from there. I did tell him that I wouldn't stop doing it, even for the sake of our relationship. Deep down, I think I always knew he wouldn't leave me - which is kind of why I put it to him like that. Like I said, I'll probably feel shit about that for the rest of my life, but what's done is done.   I do think it'll last. I hope it'll last. I pray it'll last. He's not comfortable with what I do, he doesn't like to speak about it. Right now, it's not a problem as we have so much other things going on in our lives that we talk about and so much other things we do.   I got started through Craigslist ads. It was onwards and upwards from there and here I am 8 months later.   My Mom knows. I tell my Mom everything. My Mom is only 16 years older than me, she's more like my big sister than my Mom. We're so jovial about everything. I talk about sex and boys and crushes and all those things openly with my Mom. When I told her, I could see the sadness and the disappointment in her eyes. I really could. She didn't condemned me to the pits of hell, she tried to talk me out of it and told me my self-worth and how much it hurt her. I heard her cry for about three hours in the bathroom. She asked me if it was her fault for not putting real rules in place. I told her that it was my choice and I wouldn't stop doing it. Again, it's the same. My Mom will ask me occasionally about shoots. And mostly about my sexual health and relationship with my boyfriend. She doesn't like it, she tries to be supportive but I can tell she's disappointed. It hurts to be a disappointment, but it is what it is.   My Dad would probably have a cardiac arrest if he found out. My brother would probably try and sell my work to his friends (he's 13). A few of my closest friends know and they're the most supportive about it, to be honest."

You fucked dudes behind his back and then when you told him it wasn't ""I'm sorry"", it was ""I'm going to keep doing it so you can stay or go but you don't have a choice about my cheating""  That's dishonest, tell yourself whatever you want to be OK with it but you're wrong."
AMA,39mip6,Daloowee,-17,Fri Jun 12 23:51:18 2015 UTC,"He didn't ask and I didn't lie. I tols him on the evening after the shoot.   You can say what you feel, nothing will make me feel as bad as I did when I did it."

You sprung it on him that, ""oh, I slept with some dudes for money, take it or leave it"", and deem that honesty.  But keep lying to yourself I guess.

Porn is not real.... Well - it's real sexual stimulation, but it's all acting. Orgasms are over exaggerated/not real, most of the time I'm not aroused, and I'm not in love with my co-actors. So, yes. I'd be fine with him doing porn, as long as he didn't go falling in love with anybody! Hah.   But I don't think he'd be into it. He's quite introverted at times. I've never even asked him what he'd think about doing it, but if I know him well enough, he'd say no. He's doing his dream job right now, and he's super happy doing it."

I know there'll always be a part of me that constantly feels shit for asking him to choose between our relationship or accepting what I do. But clearly he loves me if he chose to accept it."

Our relationship is not open.   I have sex with people on camera for decent money, which is different to having sex with someone because you are sexually attracted to them and you want to give them sexual pleasure and you want you to give them sexual pleasure.   If I told my boyfriend that I slept with a random guy for no reason, then I'd expect him to leave me. Heck, I'd tell him to leave me. But I sleep with people for pleasure of others and like I've mentioned... The money.   I do all sorts. I do girl on girl, solo masturbation, oral on males and females, receive oral, PIV sex and anal. I do ffm threesomes; but I won't do mmf, gangbangs, double penetration, or swallow any guys cum / let any guy cum inside me. So yes, you can choose what you will and won't do."

That is not a trustworthy thing to do in a relationship.  You explained how hurt your SO got. Its obvious that while you may have no emotional attachment to the sex, your SO does and you didn't talk about the fact that your idea of a 'closed' relationship is on an emotional level and not a sexual one. The money is irrelevant. You are having sex with other persons than your partner and you said yourself that they are not comfortable yet with it. They may be going through the motions, but they arent happy.

They're not paid for by the companies in amateur porn, though. They're mandatory and you have to provide documentation proving you're clean and you have to pay for it. It's not cheap, either. So, there really is no high risk at all. Sexual health is my priority in all of this, and I wouldn't dare take the risk if I wasn't sure. I'm not a prostitute or an escort, I work for professional people, who I trust wouldn't put me at any risk. Besides, I won't fuck/suck bareback at all, so the tiny risk is once again reduced."

I made about $2000 give or take a few tens that day, before taxes were deducted. I usually do about one a day, twice to three times a week if I'm lucky.   Some directors / companies have a set payment all round which goes by hourly rates. Some directors / companies have pay that varies on the acts performed and who they're performed with. Some companies will pay $240 per hour, some will pay $100 per hour. Some will pay $300 for a girl on girl, some will pay $600. Some will pay $500 per guy-girl scene, some will pay in excess of $1000.

AMA,39k7eo,casualguy82,3,Fri Jun 12 14:04:28 2015 UTC,"The first time I wasn't surprised. I was fourteen at the time, and I basically vaguely mentioned suicide to a teacher. The second time was a bit of a surprise because it also happened at school, but for reasons that had nothing to do with my depression. I basically just got in enough trouble that the cop was called in, and I guess because I had a history, they called in one of those on the road councillors. I said nothing to indicate that I was suicidal, and they still committed me.   Was I truly at risk? To be honest, I'm not that sure. I was extremely depressed when I was younger and repeatedly thought of killing myself. I'd say upwards of 30 times a day I was thinking of it or visualizing it. Kind of an intrusive thought. I never had an actual plan or tried, though. I'd say that when I was committed, I was no more at risk than at any other time around that age."

AMA,39gamq,MINDCRIMEV4,38,Thu Jun 11 15:34:43 2015 UTC,"Best place to park is a 24-hour Walmart.  They usually have semi truck drivers park overnight in the back, so I stick over in that direction. There's a security truck that drives by, but that's just to make sure no one's breaking into stuff.  Rule of thumb is not to park on public property or on the street, or the police will bother you.  Other private property is kinda iffy, but really, any supermarket parking lot is usually fine, so long as I park in the back and stay out of the way, and of course don't cause problems.  Main thing is, if the Walmart isn't open 24 hours, it's probably because it's a high-crime neighborhood, in which case it's best to find another part of town to park for the night."

AMA,39gamq,pdmock,1 point,Fri Jun 12 14:25:47 2015 UTC,"What are your long term goals?  Depending on your answer you may consider working for yourself on the side.  If you have a laptop, even a chromebook with wifi that would be best, although if not, consider using the library - free internet access is your best friend, if you can find it, you prevent yourself from getting paid in 2015, not lack of opportunity.  Become educated in web design and/or application development. $25 dollars can go a long way to starting your own business, another $25 dollars even further.  All it takes is determination and a great idea to earn more than you could just having someone pay you their table scraps, aka salary, income, wage - if you have to compromise a few meals now to pay for your publishing then just do it, if you have to take a few crappy jobs online to earn some extra coin, do it!  Don't work for the man if possible.  I've not felt the need to leave my homely possessions although I do endorse minimalism and keeping things working or fixing what's broken before replacing it.  As long as you don't get caught up in the myth of a career path, sooner than later, you'll make something greater than compromising.  Be honest, if you had the money, you would at least buy an RV - that's my only middle way that I could see myself in your shoes at this point.  (Disclaimer: self employed for the last few months has been more exciting than any other job I've held)"

AMA,39gamq,pdmock,1 point,Fri Jun 12 14:41:50 2015 UTC,"Become a professional board gamer - seriously, that will lend you serious credibility and or allow you to network w/ buddies who also game and may perhaps buy wares long term.  Also, it doesn't hurt to consider pledging some volunteer hours and an existing games-arena closeby.  It may seem like you're working for free, but in essence you're building rapport and real-world experience in managing it without the headache of investing your own dime.  I know a guy who found a biz owner of exactly what you're talking about.  He is working with the guy directly to help him boost sales and turn business around.  Where I live its highly competitive and that business is far more common than I thought it would be.  He basically approached the person and had confidence in his business experience to demand a small but sizeable portion of generated income on the premise that 'You wouldn't have made that sales money had I not helped, so it's in your better interests to pay me just a bit more so that I feel it's worth my time and worth your trust to make us both wealthier""   you have a long term goal in mind which is definitely ahead of the average folks so good for you, keep up the effort, and keep your diet more rounded - consider that food banks closeby could give you free perishables and you could trade w/ others in the line to keep preserved foods in exchange for  the  fresh foods that would spoil in your car.  Its another way to save cash - also, don't knock soup kitchens, with a car, you have the dual benefit of being able to actually help day after day and feel positive about helping the community overall - and it's another free meal.

AMA,39kn9k,namer98,1 point,Fri Jun 12 12:28:49 2015 UTC,"Thanks, namer98. A lot here, so hopefully I can fully answer your questions…  RSI was founded by Rabbi Joseph Gelberman, a rabbi from Hungary who left Europe for America during the Holocaust. Lost his wife and daughter in Aushwitz. Was a big believer in interfaith work.  http://www.beliefnet.com/columnists/inspirationreport/2010/09/interfaith-pioneer-rabbi-joseph-gelberman-dies-at-98.html  What or why they required certain things in our program is not something I can speak with any knowledge about. I don't set the curricula :-)  Regarding legitimacy, like most things in life, I suspect it's on a rabbi-to-rabbi basis. Some Orthodox rabbonim think Reform is Amelek, for example (or hell, knit kipot! Remember that one?)   I can only speak from my own experience, which has been a great one. My experience with other rabbis of different movements has been fantastic. Particularly amongst retired Reform rabbis, who I have had the pleasure of being friends with and being mentored by, as well as Conservative rabbis here in my town. Of course, I'm also blessed by the rabbis that partner with Darshan Yeshiva, who span Reform, Conservative, Renewal and post-denominational.  ""How is a program that takes an average of two years a program where you learn all the various halachos necessary for being a rabbi? Your course of study does not make a Rabbi. It makes a well educated laymen with some counseling experience.""  I can handle that criticism. It's a fair one. There are some folks who believe that halacha is the root of all Judaism, and that there's no way that unless you have that kind of background you can really be a rabbi, smicha or not. Regardless, I'm not a spokesperson for RSI, so I'd be uncomfortable answering questions about them beyond my experience as a student. The one thing I will say is that if you read up on who our founding rabbi was, the nature of RSI, the school he created, makes a lot of sense. Agree or disagree, it's fine.  ""For online conversions, how does such a person get the actual personal guidance requiremed, let alone the teaching needed to know how to live as a Jew?""  Sponsoring rabbis (the mentors) and students are connected one-on-one. Some work via Skype. Others are directly in that rabbi's community. It all depends. Each case is unique.  While the online study of Jewish history, lifecycle, ritual, mitzvot, holidays etc. is a big part of it, truly what I feel is great about Darshan Yeshiva is connecting students with rabbis who they meet with and guide through what it means to be a Jew.   Hope that answers your questions! Appreciate you kicking off this AMA, namer98."

Really it's more of a chavurah (friend group) as ""shul"" tends to be thought of as a community with a rabbi as  the core spiritual/administrative leader. In our case, various volunteers go online to lead the services, teach, facilitate group discussions, etc. We're pluralistic, in the sense that at any given time, you can have a very traditional person teaching, or a very non-traditional person leading. It varies all the time -- almost like a JCC of sorts. We are lay led in the sense that one lay volunteer generally manages the site, while some rabbis, maggidim and kohenet do end up being teachers and facilitators.  The advantages are that if you don't live near a community, you can have one. Also for people who are homebound for some reason or another.  Are there disadvantages? YES! It's very hard to rally around someone when they are sick/major life issue. Yes, we can email, chat, call, Facebook. And often that's 'enough'. But there's nothing like someone coming to your home with a kugel, you know?  Hope to see you sometime, Yemenite!"

AMA,39kn9k,scotchsgreatestally,1 point,Fri Jun 12 12:27:41 2015 UTC,"Thanks thestraightarrow.  Fair warning: lots of text around this issue…too many to post. There's a few  good sites that have all the texts one might need to make up their own mind about it. I'll post them later if I have time to hunt them down (though you're probably better just emailing me and I'll put it in my phone to remind myself to contact you).  Having said that…  I believe that the texts related to tattoos in the Torah are about idolatry. Some argue that it's about not tattooing the name of a god on your body. I can see self-injury rituals as being lumped in with that (sacred bloodletting -- which still exists to this day in some cultures). That's how I treat the text.  When Jewish folks tell me they want to get tattoos, this is my response:  -Go study the texts, see what they say, find some people to talk to about it. Mainly, find people to talk to about it...people who know what they are talking about, not just hyperbole -Don't worry about Jewish burial. That's a myth. Burying the dead is a mitzvah, no matter what they did or did not do while alive -Remember that tattoos are like potato chips. Some people can have just one. But most people can't -Don't try to get a discount on tattoos. Don't treat it like a normal purchase. Find a great artist, who charges a ton of money, and get something good  Lastly, if you get a tattoo with Hebrew on it, be prepared to read it to people and explain it for the rest of your life. You may even have strangers grab you and interrogate you about it, if the tattoo is visible, that is. And actually, one more thing, stay away from tattoos on necks, face and hands.  Thanks again, thestraightarrow. Best wishes on your decision, either way."

""Do you ever get criticism from the ""main-line"" Jewish community because you're a convert with tattoos who is ALSO a Rabbi?""  You might be shocked to read that seldom do people criticize me, tattoos and all.  I'm thrilled by that. Frankly, I don't have a ton of time these days. Too busy with PunkTorah, OneShul, Darshan Yeshiva, my hobbies, my family, trying to travel, and also focusing on my health (I have something similar to Multiple Sclerosis). I do lifecycle, I'm writing a book, I'm doing a public speaking tour in October. I'm too busy for drama.  The Internet has an ability to amplify things and make them look much, much bigger than they really are. I think I probably get flack once a year and that's it. Your local pulpit rabbi probably deals with more nonsense than I do.  ""Do you think that you portray a 21st century representation of Judaism? Or just another branch?""  Nah, I'm not that interesting. I think the Jewish world is incredibly diverse. I'm just another fish in the pond. Reading hevria.com is a great way to realign yourself when you start to think you're original :-) The bloggers on there are beautiful souls.  ""Also, separate question. Do you think that Judaism as a faith can survive the 21st century in it's current form?""  It's like evolution. A single celled organism doesn't just become an ape. You have transitional forms in between one species and another. Religions work the same way.   Just take Reform. Within that camp, you have old school Classical Reform, neo-Traditionalists, the folks who are more Renewal than Reform but identify as Reform, the secular humanists who call themselves Reform because that's what their family is/was, etc. And yet we pretty much treat Reform as homogeneous. And don't get me started on the diversity in Orthodoxy. It's incredible, actually. We could learn a lot from that.  My big concerns are pluralism in Israel and conversion. If we can keep those two areas sound, we'll be OK.  Thanks for your questions, imdakota."
AMA,39kn9k,RevNfnRoach,1 point,Fri Jun 12 16:16:01 2015 UTC,"This may seem long winded but I feel like my questions need context.   Ever since I was young I got harassed and picked on because of my last name and how I look. People would call me a Jew like it was a bad thing, throw change at me, etc. I never knew why until a couple years ago. I learnt my greatgrandfather was Jewish. He married a Christian woman to protect himself after his family was rounded up and killed.   I've met some Jews who hear my last name they ask me if I'm Jewish and I say I don't know and explain the situation. I get one of two responses. 1) If your mom isn't Jewish neither are you OR I get told I'm Jewish and that I should embrace it. Keep kosher, observe Shabbat and the holidays.   So here are my questions: What are your views on Jewish identity/Who's right?  Why would HaShem give me a heritage that could be uplifting but ultimately leaves me excluded by both Gentiles and Jews?"
AMA,39kn9k,RevNfnRoach,1 point,Fri Jun 12 15:09:39 2015 UTC,"Yo scotchsgreatestally!  Thanks for telling your story. Two things stood out: who is right, meaning, which side am I on…and why me? (me, meaning you, that is).  So who is right? Halacha says if your mother is Jewish so are you. If you convert, you're Jewish that way, too. That's the simple answer. Reform and (I think) Reconstructionist Judaism accepts patrilineal descent, along with the Karaites who ONLY accept it.  Am I making things more complicated? Hope not! But suspect so. Perhaps this will make it easier...  ""Why would HaShem give me a heritage that could be uplifting but ultimately leaves me excluded by both Gentiles and Jews?""  You own your identity, and not anyone else. My question is: do you want to be Jewish? If you do, go for it! If you don't, then the answer is, ""I'm not Jewish, but I have Jewish ancestry""…or another answer might be, ""none of your damn business what I am."" :-)  What you make of your family's past is up to you. You get to decide that. All Jewish souls were at Sinai…so if you feel like you were there, then there's a good chance you were. Sometimes a name is who we are. Sometimes a name is just a name.

I know there is so much more to learn, and that it is an ongoing lifetime process..... But how ""equipped"" do I need to be/should I be, before signing up for a formal conversion program.

He said the pressure of having to learn as much as he thought he needed to know was just too overwhelming.  What he gained from this experience was this phrase, ""you have to learn how to swim in the ocean of Judaism without drowning in it.""  I've had this discussion with a lot of people. I think the key time to approach a rabbi/join a community is when you come to the realization that IF you are going to go somewhere for a religious service or celebration, it's a shul/chavurah. When you're there, you're ready.   My biggest thing with people is community. Find community. Abraham, Isaac and Jacob are great. But they make boring Shabbat dinner companions. I tell people to find the community with zero regard to what movement that community affiliates with. Find cool people. Don't worry about what label they have.

If the answer is something like ""I just get fed up with rabbis"" or ""Jewish community stinks"" or ""well, those rules are dumb"" then it's not theology that's the issue...it's not halacha...it's that person feeling, rightfully or not, that they cannot walk comfortably in Jewish community.  I read somewhere that 11,000 people per year convert to Judaism. Not sure how true that is. But I suspect there would be far more people converting if they didn't sense that they were not wanted.

What do you do for work?   Right now I work at a dog spa. I bathe the dogs, trim their nails, clean ears, etc. I went to college for my bachelors in psychology and bachelors in business management.

AMA,39idjb,Lurch454,2,Thu Jun 11 23:38:32 2015 UTC,"Gotta chime in. I am a therapist, certified, licensed etc. You absolutely can afford a therapist. Most likely not one in private practice but at a clinic or hospital. If you would like some pointers in finding one, let me know."
AMA,39idjb,manipulationcreation,1 point,Fri Jun 12 03:07:39 2015 UTC,"I'm so glad that you have such a good support system :) for starters, I think that it's extremely important to take care of your body. When you have a mental ailment (ADHD counts) then it doesn't help if your body is also suffering. I've noticed that when I eat right, exercise, get enough sunshine, and have fun, then I feel mentally better :)"

AMA,39idjb,Tip718,1 point,Fri Jun 12 01:47:04 2015 UTC,"That's something I struggled with immensely. What truly kept my motivation was the fact that I knew how bad I would hurt my mother. If I killed myself, she would be forever broken.   s for the day to day motivation troubles, I still struggle with that. But lately I've been just pushing myself to do things. I have realized that most of the time it's just starting something that is difficult. Once you start, it gets easier (for me, at least)"

AMA,39ldbu,sonny411j,0,Fri Jun 12 15:37:16 2015 UTC,"I think you may have posted this in the wrong place.   Conversion study should ideally happen in person, and a conversion absolutely has to be done in person, a conversion over the Internet would mean nothing whatsoever. Go talk to your local rabbis about next steps, and find a shul and rabbi that feels right to you. You can't become a Jew just by deciding you are one, it takes years of study and a proper conversion.   I also invite you to look into the Noahide Laws, which are a guideline for non-Jews who basically believe in the Jewish God and belief system. Judaism, unlike most other religions, doesn't believe someone needs to be a Jew to be righteous, in fact, we consider the laws of Judaism as a burden (a gift, but also a burden) and discourage conversion. Niahides are happily welcomed into most Jewish communities."
AMA,39i9da,MayBeGroot,5,Thu Jun 11 22:13:15 2015 UTC,Do you really think that black market hormones and treating yourself without a doctor's supervision are good ideas?
AMA,39i9da,TheReverendBill,3,Thu Jun 11 22:39:11 2015 UTC,"Medically? It's a risk, yes. But I take care to try to minimize risks (don't smoke, exercise, and lookout for any warning signs). I'm very healthy physically, but if that changed, I would have to quit and tell somebody, yeah. I am careful with my dosages and don't over do it.   But my family is pretty conservative and not accepting of this kind of stuff. I'm looking for better employment, but until that happens, I have to stay put as I couldn't afford to move out."
AMA,39i9da,Follygagger,3,Thu Jun 11 22:50:20 2015 UTC,Have you ever sought anonymous professìonal counseling for this decision?
AMA,39i9da,Follygagger,3,Fri Jun 12 03:34:00 2015 UTC,"Not completely sure what you mean by that. Like over the Internet? Or seeing someone but not giving my name? In any case, no. I'm 100% sure about myself in regard to being trans and I'm really the introspective sort; I'll probably see a psych down the road, but probably only as a gatekeeper to doctor-supervised HRT or surgery.  I don't intend to do this DIY stuff forever."
