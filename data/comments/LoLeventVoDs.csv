LoLeventVoDs,3cxq5u,LoLeventVoDs,-7,Sat Jul 11 18:45:14 2015 UTC,Is it just me or does LCS get boring? I just started watching and its kind of annoying seeing the same 20-26 champions every game. Seeing jungle Shyvana made the game so much more interesting.   They should add a rule that they can't pick the same champion they picked in a previous game. That would add a lot of strategy in terms of who you can pick in the future.

Another way to find out which games of the week were best or most interesting, you can check out the Countdown of Montecristo These videos recap the best games from NA, EU, China and Korea every week, but if you want to avoid spoilers, a link to all of the vods are posted in the info below the youtube video.

NACS started two days ago, first day wasn't broadcasted and VODs are available on Riot's channel while second one was broadcasted last night.  We should have a thread up, but I honestly don't have the time to maintain more threads than I already do, so we'll see if somebody from the team is willing to pick it up!  /u/MrRoyce"

LoLeventVoDs,39aft3,Staubsau_Ger,1 point,Thu Jun 11 19:02:32 2015 UTC,"Fixed that.  He was casting some NA games we used in other thread and since those VODs weren't official Riots ones but rather the ones he uploaded with his casting, that's why his name was listed there. And when Simon was creating this thread, he just copied that part without realizing RAPiD wasn't in these VODs :)  /u/MrRoyce"

We have all games within each week in the order they occur, because many users do not view the thread until all games in a particular week have been played (that way one can naturally go from top game to bottom game in each week).  We have experimented with different formats, and we've found that this format is the best for leagues.

LoLeventVoDs,37v9mt,PenisEngineMechanic,2,Mon Jun 1 12:36:34 2015 UTC,Anyone aware why it seems to be hit-or-miss over whether there is a  YouTube version of the Full Stream? It's always my preferred viewing method but seems to only randomly be available.
LoLeventVoDs,37v9mt,Christoph_Blocher,1 point,Mon Jun 1 04:12:58 2015 UTC,"Dozens of reports from people who tried to watch it and VOD started halfway through game 2 or something.  There's a note above the tables under ""Thread info:"" about it. And worst part is, those VODs aren't listed on Riots channel for some reason, so only way around it would be to save the link and add it the next day."
LoLeventVoDs,37v9mt,Candlemaster,2,Mon Jun 1 04:26:22 2015 UTC,"Could you maybe post them with the warning that that might happen next to it?  In my experience, they often start four hours from the end for a day or two, then go back to correct.  And yeah, you have to get the link during the broadcast to get those."
LoLeventVoDs,37v9mt,Christoph_Blocher,1 point,Tue Jun 2 16:27:41 2015 UTC,"Completely overlooked that note, thank you! And yes, I have noticed that at some point during the Spring Split the full streams for EU and NA LCS began being listed as private. This is different to the full streams for the other regions Riot hosts on their YouTube channel."
LoLeventVoDs,37v9mt,Candlemaster,1 point,Mon Jun 1 04:55:10 2015 UTC,Is the TDK v GV game on Youtube only available in 360p?
LoLeventVoDs,37v9mt,Thulack,3,Mon Jun 1 01:50:02 2015 UTC,Hi there.  YouTube takes anywhere between 30 to 60 minutes to process to higher quality (480p first and then 720p HD). This depends on video length and you'll only notice this if you open video shortly after it was uploaded!
LoLeventVoDs,37v9mt,inabox44,2,Mon Jun 1 02:07:04 2015 UTC,"Ah, cool!"
LoLeventVoDs,37v9mt,MrRoyce,1 point,Mon Jun 1 02:46:20 2015 UTC,No audio on the twitch stream for TDK v GV  EDIT: Fixed
LoLeventVoDs,37v9mt,inabox44,2,Mon Jun 1 01:06:08 2015 UTC,For some reason I thought these used to be recorded in 1080 p. Is there any reason why they're only recorded in 720p?
LoLeventVoDs,37v9mt,MrRoyce,4,Sun May 31 15:27:36 2015 UTC,They're streamed in 720p 60FPS and that's how they're recorded & uploaded.
LoLeventVoDs,37v9mt,Borror0,5,Sun May 31 15:39:13 2015 UTC,Thanks for the information! I'm not sure why I thought they used to be in 1080p... was some special event (like worlds or something) recording done in LoLevents or is that just my imagination?
LoLeventVoDs,37v9mt,ouch34,3,Sun May 31 15:48:13 2015 UTC,"Back in season 2, there was an MLG event that had 1080p streams for the premium pass, iirc. Perhaps other MLG events are broadcasted in 1080p as well, dunno."
LoLeventVoDs,37v9mt,Wayrow,3,Tue Jun 2 13:37:48 2015 UTC,I dont think I discovered this sub til s3 so not sure. Either way I'm just crazy :P
LoLeventVoDs,37v9mt,stralian,3,Tue Jun 2 20:50:52 2015 UTC,CRAZY ABOUT HIGH DEFINITION!
LoLeventVoDs,37v9mt,Kaylila,5,Wed Jun 3 03:40:30 2015 UTC,"As far as I know, Riot has never streamed in any other resolution than 720p in the last two seasons."
LoLeventVoDs,37v9mt,ouch34,2,Sun May 31 16:31:34 2015 UTC,"alright, just my imagination then, thank you! :)"
LoLeventVoDs,37v9mt,splitcroof92,5,Sun May 31 17:00:36 2015 UTC,"As we used to say back in the day, the technology just isn't quite there yet."
LoLeventVoDs,37v9mt,koticgood,3,Sun May 31 17:05:36 2015 UTC,"Well back in the day we also used to say ""we have the technology"" ... but that refers to rebuilding people, so we clearly just need to make vods a person."
LoLeventVoDs,37v9mt,AStupidHippo,1 point,Sun May 31 17:09:31 2015 UTC,Anyone else having issues with Twitch VoD's lagging out their internet connection? Seems like for the past week anytime i load a Twitch VoD it takes like 2 mins to load and then my wed browser doesnt want to open anymore pages it just hangs on the loading screen. Works fine with Youtube VoD's or when watching Twitch Live. It's only happening when i try and watch a Twitch VoD.
LoLeventVoDs,37v9mt,ouch34,2,Sun May 31 13:46:53 2015 UTC,Seems the current links only take you to the live stream?
LoLeventVoDs,37v9mt,bootsandskins,1 point,Sat May 30 20:53:16 2015 UTC,Twitch links? Just manually clicked on all 4 and they all work as intended.
LoLeventVoDs,37v9mt,ouch34,2,Sat May 30 20:56:20 2015 UTC,All four of them take me to the live stream. Maybe it's just me haha.
LoLeventVoDs,37v9mt,MrRoyce,1 point,Sat May 30 20:58:02 2015 UTC,"Give me more info please - are you trying to watch those from mobile? Tablet? If it's from PC, which browser do you use?"
LoLeventVoDs,37v9mt,phelski,1 point,Sat May 30 20:59:52 2015 UTC,I'm  not the person you were replying to but I can't seem to make 5ye Twitch links on my phone (Samsung Galaxy S6). It's the first time I've tried to do so maybe that's a known problem with the mobile site.
LoLeventVoDs,37v9mt,MrRoyce,18,Sat May 30 22:48:42 2015 UTC,anyone have any idea why twitch vod links sometimes dont have sound.  It happens to me often and the old unmute mute doesnt seem to work
LoLeventVoDs,37v9mt,zhouster,2,Sat May 30 20:44:33 2015 UTC,Links to twitch vods with timestamps don't have sound. Remove the timestamp.
LoLeventVoDs,37v9mt,ouch34,2,Mon Jun 1 08:31:26 2015 UTC,"Having the timestamp in the URL sometimes causes this. If you remove the timestamp it should start playing at the beginning, then you can hover your mouse over the bar at the bottom to pick the time to jump forward to. Pretty dirty solution but I havent found any other that works (besides watching youtube vods)."
LoLeventVoDs,37v9mt,hadenthefox,1 point,Mon Jun 1 00:53:15 2015 UTC,I can't get the sound to work - were you able to?
LoLeventVoDs,37v9mt,MrTubbehhh,2,Sun May 31 15:59:14 2015 UTC,yeah i just kept refreshing it took maybe 6 or 7 times to finally get sound on it
LoLeventVoDs,37v9mt,MrRoyce,24,Sun May 31 16:47:01 2015 UTC,there is no reason to watch the twitch vods over youtube
LoLeventVoDs,37v9mt,CPO_Mendez,2,Sun May 31 15:20:16 2015 UTC,reasons:  slightly better quality for me  loads faster for me  more accurate seeking when you mouse-click on the time-bar  re-chat for twitch  minimizes/maximizes faster  prefer the interface
LoLeventVoDs,37v9mt,godkidd,1 point,Mon Jun 1 12:57:01 2015 UTC,"if you have retwitch, you get twitch chat of that specific vod."
LoLeventVoDs,37v9mt,CPO_Mendez,8,Mon Jun 1 07:33:02 2015 UTC,i dont like the youtube vods since any jerk of the mouse can give away who wins based off the time the video ends.
LoLeventVoDs,37v9mt,leverpostejsmad,2,Sun May 31 15:22:17 2015 UTC,You can download HTML to hide youtube time. I downloaded one before and it stays in my favorites bar and I can click it whenever youtube is open to hide the time and it will not show even if you move your mouse. I don't remember where I got it from but I found a thread from r/starcraft that may work http://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft/comments/2hq22j/hide_youtube_progress_bar_to_avoid_time_spoilers/
LoLeventVoDs,37v9mt,CPO_Mendez,2,Mon Jun 1 02:49:27 2015 UTC,i love you <3
LoLeventVoDs,37v9mt,jeremiahjo,17,Mon Jun 1 02:59:15 2015 UTC,"But we include post game stuff such as interview or post game anaylsis, that means anywhere between couple of minutes up to 20-25 minutes of additional stuff in video. So it's really hard to know when the game is going to end because you don't know how much 'fluff' talk will there be once the game ends."
LoLeventVoDs,37v9mt,leverpostejsmad,1 point,Sun May 31 15:43:41 2015 UTC,"just wondering, is there a way u could add just a black screen to the end of vods so they all are like 1hr long, or something like that"
LoLeventVoDs,37v9mt,xympa,1 point,Mon Jun 1 15:08:34 2015 UTC,"Not without additional rendering and making the whole process much longer. We already need a lot more time since VODs include both pre-game & post-game stuff and our videos would need to be 1h30min then, since right now most of them are around 60 minutes or more.  We'll be working on something like this for special events like Worlds and will see if we can figure something out to make the spoiler-free experience actually spoiler-free :)"
LoLeventVoDs,37v9mt,nah_you_good,1 point,Mon Jun 1 15:14:42 2015 UTC,"Especially for the VODs from OGN, sometimes I prefer the Twitch VODs because the Youtube VODs don't include MVP, highlights, analysis, etc. Or I'll wait for Riot to upload the complete stream. I don't mind skipping ahead out of breaks to watch the analysis and stuff."
LoLeventVoDs,37v9mt,C00kieMonster,11,Sun May 31 23:37:07 2015 UTC,"I agree you don't know when the game will end, but its quite easy to predict if their will be a comeback in the game if you notice the video is getting towards the end.  you can never be 100% confident on the winner, but id say normally you can predict the outcome of a game based off of when a youtube video is reaching the end."
LoLeventVoDs,37v9mt,XsickxplayX,5,Sun May 31 16:50:49 2015 UTC,"Two points to try and help you:  Twitch sometimes does a weird thing with sound where if you watch the ad with sound muted then the actual video will be muted. To overcome this, try watching the ad with sound on or try turning the sound icon off and on. (or use adblock/ublock)  Secondly, you could watch the youtube video without the title and controls therefore you don't see how long you have left in the video. This guide will tell you how to do that."
LoLeventVoDs,37v9mt,RscMrF,2,Mon Jun 1 11:45:03 2015 UTC,while your point is valid i think what he means is if you hover over the timeline part of the video it can accidently show later parts of the game/end game interviews with the winners
LoLeventVoDs,37v9mt,PirateAdventurer,2,Sun May 31 16:14:48 2015 UTC,"Refresh a few times, change quality, open video without timestamp and jump in time manually to whatever time you want to start watching from. That does the trick for nearly everyone."

The guys behind /r/leagueoflegends put in so much work and unlike here, you don't even see it! When we make a new thread, add links and so on - it's all visible, but when they remove bunch of threads & comments, brainstorm about new rules and how to deal with ongoing issues, we don't really notice.

The only reason he has it because he never includes anything in video, no pre-game, post-game etc. He rather releases bunch of videos to maximize profit (I mean, I've seen him uploading 10 videos from PTL alone lol), while we have another approach - everything we can fit in one VOD for best viewer pleasure so you don't have to switch to another video if you want to watch interview or something. Due to that, our videos are longer and take more to process and be available.  We will improve on this though, should be a bit quicker from 3rd game forward. :)  /u/MrRoyce"

LoLeventVoDs,37knpe,DarthFroshy,1 point,Fri May 29 22:35:22 2015 UTC,"Hello,   I've been a supporter of your content because I can't watch live at work but the VODS come out on the same day.   I don't understand why the content is getting shorter and shorter. For example, the first game of the day almost always used to include the opening of the day and each game used to include the pre and post analysis desk segments.   What changes have transpired to promote cutting these off? Unfortunately, I'd rather wait for the official VODS if its going to be raw game, no fluff."
LoLeventVoDs,37knpe,SANPres09,5,Fri May 29 22:24:35 2015 UTC,"Hello /u/broknd.  I don't exactly agree that content has been getting shorter and shorter, because we've (almost) always used to include both pre-game & post-game stuff until this EU LCS week first two games/uploads processing took forever due to YouTube being a pain, so we figured we'd experiment with shorter videos from which we only removed pre-game discussion.   We couldn't draw conclusions from just a few uploads, so we've extended this testing period to W1D2 for EU LCS as well. Basically, we came to conclusion that we only save 9 minutes (on average) by cutting the pre-game stuff out and should get back to full length VODs for NA LCS.  Another reason why we were inclined to experiment with this was because according to Google Analytics, many (read as: majority) of people skip the pre-game 'fluff' and use timestamps either in video descriptions below or jump in time manually to find more interesting part of the VOD. However, seeing how we've received a decent feedback from you guys questioning this decision and after realizing that VODs won't be up much quicker, we'll be providing full length VODs again start with NA LCS W1D1.  Sorry for inconvenience and thank you for bringing this up, feedback is something we value a lot here!"
LoLeventVoDs,37knpe,th3cyclo,1 point,Sat May 30 05:04:42 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the detailed reply. I hope I didn't come off as disparaging, I didn't mean to. I was just a bit frustrated at the time.  I want to thank you guys again because I've been subbed to this place since it started, before Riot were actively working on getting their vods and youtube channel organized and it took half an hour of research to find out who was playing and where to find VODs.    I understand if you guys want to focus on speed since you are covering a critical blind spot (same day VODS) and I agree that it should probably take priority over other issues. I'm glad to hear that the full length ones will be returning though."
LoLeventVoDs,37knpe,MrRoyce,1 point,Wed Jun 3 15:22:58 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the detailed reply. I hope I didn't come off as disparaging, I didn't mean to. I was just a bit frustrated at the time.   No, it's perfectly fine. The thing we value the most here is feedback. If we do something good or bad, we want to know so we can continue to improve (or just get some praise because we did a good job :P).  If not a single person mentioned that they'd like to watch pre-game stuff, we'd definitely remove it at some point, but seeing how there are still those who enjoy the pre-game content, we will not remove it. If difference between uploading slightly shorter VOD was huge, then we would also consider it even more seriously, but seeing how difference is normally less than 15 minutes, it's perfectly fine to have them slightly delayed.  So yeah, thank you for your kind words as well, everything is very much appreciated :)"

There is a reason - YouTube has some issues again with long videos after broadcast ends and for some time video doesn't start from beginning but several hours later so people were getting spoiled left and right so now, usually we don't add YouTube links right away (or at all if nobody saved the link, since it's hidden from Riots YouTube channel).

LoLeventVoDs,37knpe,MrRoyce,1 point,Sat Jun 6 15:13:21 2015 UTC,"Hey.  They actually ""upload"", well technically, they don't need to re-upload anything, once stream ends it starts processing and based on broadcast length, it can take anywhere from several hours to 12 hours to be processed to 720p.  What happens here is that something messes things up in the process and once video is finally available, it won't play from the beginning, so we had to start linking the livestream URL because people were getting spoiled as it would start playing from e.g. end of 2nd game or something.  So now, the only way to get a link is if someone watched the livestreamer or saved the link and add it around this time (or few hours earlier). I personally don't remember to do this, but I asked around and found yesterdays link for you (and everyone else who asked for it or will want to use it): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-bM3nMA59g  Enjoy,  /u/MrRoyce"

LoLeventVoDs,37knpe,TyGuyhi,1 point,Thu Jun 11 19:12:46 2015 UTC,"Yes, exactly.  It shouldn't be too long to get to 480p and then finally to 720p. Normally it takes an hour for video to process from lowers to highest resolution - but it really depends on video length. If a video is shorter (e.g. under 40 minutes), processing to HD is done within half an hour. If it's longer, it can take up to an hour or even hour and a half.   But per visitors request, we include both pre-game and post-game stuff, so all videos are about 1 hour or longer and that means 60 minutes of processing time for most uploads.  Hope that explains it! :)  /u/MrRoyce"

If I took a sip of water every time I heard someone say ""certainly"" I would die of water poisoning.  There are more ""certainly""s per game than kills.  Certainly you can stop using the word so much especially considering every single time it is used it is superfluous.   ""They certainly are"" is not something you need to respond with every single time your co-castor points something out. It's just not."
LoLeventVoDs,36ur3i,bailst2,-1,Wed Jun 24 03:34:40 2015 UTC,At least we don't have to listen to Monte.  Just my 2 cents lol.
LoLeventVoDs,36ur3i,Muramasa_Myodai,1 point,Tue Jun 30 06:17:47 2015 UTC,"I don't mind when the casters expound upon the other caster's remarks, however it is true that they sometimes just rephrase the same thing, which is very annoying. There should be depth to casting that comes from comprehension of the game, not so much repetition."
LoLeventVoDs,36ur3i,Popkins,1 point,Mon Jun 29 03:00:45 2015 UTC,"They sometimes go on autopilot and just repeat ""He/they certainly are/is"" every time something is said by the other one.  When I hear the word ""certainly"" I know I'm about to hear it at least ten more times in the following minutes but sometimes there are entire games where nobody uses the word.   It's similar to an epidemic."
LoLeventVoDs,36ur3i,yellowdogyyy,2,Mon Jun 29 03:04:03 2015 UTC,Would it be possible to add who is casting?  I know this isn't that extremely important for the matches but I think it would improve the amount of information given and some people love and watch because of the casters.
LoLeventVoDs,36ur3i,Tjufta,1 point,Sun Jun 21 11:12:46 2015 UTC,"If you scroll to the top of the page, you got there names of the casters, their nicks and links to their twitters."

LoLeventVoDs,36ur3i,Tjufta,1 point,Sun Jun 21 12:00:54 2015 UTC,"That is really unnecessary. If you are not sure who is who when It comes to casters, may I suggest that you watch full YouTube or full Twitch vod's (you can find them right above tables). Casters always introduce themselves before a sets of games. :)"
LoLeventVoDs,36ur3i,gothic_potato,1 point,Sun Jun 21 14:20:47 2015 UTC,"While it is probably unnecessary, since it's very easy to find out who the casters are by going to the beginning of the match, I personally would also find the information informative. If one of the casters isn't Froskurinn then the games just really aren't worth watching."

Seriously, is Riot even aware of this? This is a joke. Chinese league is now the top league (with LCK) in the world, how can its english stream be so pathetic? If the connection in Australia is that bad, bring it to NA, there is a lot of professionals  willing to do the job even if the schedule is bad."

LoLeventVoDs,36ur3i,gothic_potato,0,Sun Jun 14 07:12:57 2015 UTC,"I wish Papasmithy and Pastrytime would cast every game, they are the best english language casters of League of Legends by far imo"
LoLeventVoDs,36ur3i,Muramasa_Myodai,1 point,Wed Jun 10 07:15:10 2015 UTC,"Not even close. They are basic play-by-play casters, and when they do dabble in analysis it is often incorrect in regards to predictions. If I had to choose two English casters it would be MonteCristo and Froskurinn. They both have an incredibly pool of knowledge regarding players' past actions, the current patch, and why certain decisions are being made over others. When Froskurinn first appeared on the scene I was incredibly skeptical, but she really has consistently blown it out of the water."
LoLeventVoDs,36ur3i,gothic_potato,1 point,Wed Jun 24 09:23:01 2015 UTC,"Froskurinn over plays herself a bit, and states things as if they were fact sometimes when they are not. Monte is just funny, hes not that great a caster but he's alright to listen to. I don't mind him. I believe your idea of good casters is a little bit skewed haha"
LoLeventVoDs,36ur3i,Muramasa_Myodai,1 point,Sun Jun 28 05:23:14 2015 UTC,"I believe your idea of good casters is a little bit skewed haha   I guess I have a bias in the fact that I like analyst casters, and MonteCristo and Froskurinn are the two best on the business so therefore I highly prefer their work. You seem to be a fan of the play-by-play casters, which is why you enjoyed the Australian duo who were the two worst analysts in all regions. I personally don't want League announcing to become that of baseball analysis (eg. ""And so-and-so hits the ball! It is going wide to the left field! Certain-outfielder is reaching for it! And...He catches the ball!"") just because I can physically see the game and what is going on, so I don't need the play-by-play discussion. What I find adds to the game are discussions that draw on seasons and seasons of detailed knowledge of players and team behavior, such as the logic behind a champion or item choice and whether it is good or bad in this specific situation - or how a specific player history in their solo que main account and smurfs indicates why they would lean towards a certain champion or a team comp as a whole. It is difficult for people to be good at the analyst caster style, since it requires good logic skills and a vast knowledge of the game and player details - but I am happy to see that LOL Esports is making the transition towards those types of casters."
LoLeventVoDs,36ur3i,drewb192,1 point,Mon Jun 29 18:50:35 2015 UTC,"I'm sad PapaSmithy left LPL but I greatly enjoy when he casts with Montecristo. They are now my favorite casting duo. ALSO Froskurinn makes dirty jokes on air occasionally, MY YOUNG MIND CAN""T HANDLE IT!!! To be honest I have muted games that she has casted with the new american caster. Luckily it seems they split up that duo so she is casting with the Australian dude now and its a bit more tolerable"
LoLeventVoDs,36ur3i,Muramasa_Myodai,0,Sun Jun 28 05:34:55 2015 UTC,"Personally, I think Froskurinn is terrible. I have pretty much started trying to avoid all of the games she casts. Reminds me of when Doris Burke calls an NBA game. She can be plenty knowledgeable but for whatever reason I just don't enjoy listening as much. Definitely miss the Papasmithy plus Pastrytime casts but the new LCK duo is pretty awesome too."

LoLeventVoDs,36ur3i,Muramasa_Myodai,1 point,Tue Jun 30 19:04:40 2015 UTC,"It's possible that I'm just a curmudgeonly, growly monster, but smithy drives me nanners, especially when he's casting with the guy who isn't Pastrytime.  A guy so annoying in cadence I've never bothered to learn his name.  All I know for sure is that if we played a drinking game where we had to drink every time guy who's not Pastrytime said, ""falls down,"" we'd be dead.  Smithy does know what he's talking about though and is most often accurate with his in game analysis, so that's worth enough to ignore the things I don't love."
LoLeventVoDs,36ur3i,Muramasa_Myodai,1 point,Thu Jun 11 00:51:36 2015 UTC,"I do think Smithy and Pastrytime compliment each other particularly well. I especially enjoy when they cast LGD games. (LGD is my favorite team, I think they do the trolliest stuff)"
LoLeventVoDs,36ur3i,Flashmagoo,-1,Thu Jun 11 19:15:14 2015 UTC,"I personally feel that some of the newer casters, while saying alot, are exaggerating in some ways, which is something I really don't like. For instance the woman said it was standard to rush Rylai's Crystal Scepter on Cassio and contrasted that with someone rushing Luden's... she is a caster not a pro player and I feel like this opinion is misleading and opinions like this should not be presented as hard facts. Papasmithy and Pastrytime are never overassertive in    this way, however they are extremely competent analysts that comment on the pros and cons of each build route, etc."
LoLeventVoDs,36ur3i,IeIgHtNiNe,1 point,Thu Jun 11 19:26:10 2015 UTC,"I don't disagree with any of this.  I'm pretty sure that my issue with Smithy as a color-com/analyst is preferential and not objective.  As long as the play-by-play guy isn't annoying the shit out of me with unnecessary and inappropriate-for-the-circumstance shouting my feelings for Smithy are safely back to neutral.  Come to think about it actually, I don't mind any of the LPL casters except guy who is not pastrytime who yells, ""falls down,"" every time someone dies. Also, it would appear that I am now going out of my way to avoid learning that guys name."
LoLeventVoDs,36ur3i,Flashmagoo,1 point,Thu Jun 11 21:39:10 2015 UTC,"I think you're thinking of Atlus?  Yea that guy is a fucking idiot.  He has nothing clever to say so he just repeats little phrases and memes that get so annoying I have to stop watching sometimes.  ""falls down"" is one.  ""silly"" is another, like ""oh that damage was silly"" or ""this is getting silly.""  Fucking hate that guy."
LoLeventVoDs,36ur3i,IeIgHtNiNe,1 point,Fri Jun 19 13:53:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I just clicked his name and got the link to his twitter.  That's the guy.  I think it's probably tough to call games in any sport without leaning really heavily on comfort filler phrases, sitting in silence is essentially giving notice for those folks.  I like to throw on full streams in the background five hours of this guy is upsetting to the point of distraction.   That's faux outrage by me there... But it is pretty annoying once you start attending to it."
LoLeventVoDs,36ur3i,Flashmagoo,2,Fri Jun 19 19:42:36 2015 UTC,"No, I completely agree. I too listen to streams in the background and literally every couple seconds, in his thick Australian accent, he screams:  ""Awwwohhhh my GAWD [insert description of play]!!!!""   or   ""THERE'S the [insert engage ability/damage ability i.e. shockwave, dragon's decent, dredgeline, etc.]!!!!""  I encourage you to watch an LPL stream and try to keep count of how many times he uses one of the above two stock phrases.  So goddamn annoying."

I'm not sure if I should condemn you or thank you for such artistry.  Either way, it's refreshing to find someone who shares a tendency to express a burning fury with regard to relatively innocuous things.  Good God stop saying falls down.  You know if we played a drinking game where you had to drink every time someone said, falls down, punished, win condition, or ""carving a side of beef"" in cow games we'd be dead before the first dragon."

So that's one play to start.  Aside from that, QG seems to be the darkhorse team of the split, and the strong teams are EDG, LGD,IG and Snake. So look for games where they face each other."
LoLeventVoDs,36ur3i,LuteFarm,2,Tue May 26 03:50:49 2015 UTC,"I watched MonteCristo's countdown once.  It's pretty full of spoilers.  It's not ""you should watch this game"" but more ""this was a good game, team <X> crushed team <Y> by doing <Z>.""  I wish it was more of a guide of games to catch in a spoiler free way, but that wouldn't be a very long video.  :)  Is it me, or are a lot of the games pretty one sided?  It feels like the china scene has 2-4 teams too many."

This is quite apparent a few times and in almost every LPL game and can completely ruins the game at times. ( dragon fight in game 1 of OMG vs VG ) Please look into this and try to fix.

LoLeventVoDs,36lav8,Pwndocksaint,4,Sat May 30 12:18:25 2015 UTC,I dont get why /r/loleventvods' setup. The weeks go from bot->top (week 1 at bot week 2 at top). Meanwhile the days go from top->bot (day 1 at top day 2 at bot). That would be my only suggestion to this sub is to put the most recent game at the top.
LoLeventVoDs,36lav8,jake13wagg,3,Sat May 30 12:52:26 2015 UTC,"Eh, the current way is likely to be most convenient for most people.  Having the most recent weeks nearer the top, with the days arranged in the order they were played, means that it's easy to find the most recent week of VODs, while avoiding accidentally watching Day 3 VODs before Day 1 VODs (which means that the results don't get spoilt for you).  It's more convenient that way for people who are up to date enough to be on the current week (or nearly on it), but not up to date enough that they're on the current day of games.  Using a ""W2D2-->W2D1-->W1D2-->W1D1"" format would be more awkward, since it makes it more likely you'll watch the Day 2 VODs first and have the results of the Day 1 games spoilt, and means that the number of games (which is really big in a best of 3) doesn't get spoilt for people who don't use the stylesheet.  TL;DR: I type too much :( The order they use is the most convenient for most people and least spoiler prone way of doing things."

We've experimented with bunch of different ways over the years and every single time we've had complaints or people who weren't able to understand how the hell we sort stuff.  This is why we also introduced red color in title for latest day so no matter where it is in thread, you will be able to find it easily. We're still struggling with consistency and figuring out what's the best way to sort stuff, so some threads may have days listed in proper order with oldest on top and newest at bottom, but normally that's done for shorter/simple events such as IEM."

LoLeventVoDs,36lav8,Squirrel-God,2,Thu May 21 06:36:16 2015 UTC,I always prefer Youtube VODs because of that. Live events I prefer on Twitch though.
LoLeventVoDs,36lav8,psychowei,2,Thu May 21 18:01:11 2015 UTC,just a suggestion for the highlight reel: preface the significant action with a 5-8 sec clip (before the action happens) to create a better buildup of the time/situation during the game.  like this!

LoLeventVoDs,36lav8,Kladias,2,Thu May 21 20:15:53 2015 UTC,Ashe is disabled because all new champions or champion reworks have a 2 week ban so that pros can practice playing/playing against the champion.

LoLeventVoDs,36lav8,DiggyB,-2,Wed May 27 17:44:22 2015 UTC,Yup a lot of the time monte thinks he knows what hes talking about when he actually doesnt. Still a smart analyst just overconfident and not on par with a lot of professional coaches/players

LoLeventVoDs,33cva2,Tecfan,1 point,Fri May 8 11:39:26 2015 UTC,"just an overall suggestion: make placeholder links for all games in series at once  because as the series goes and tables are updated here, one can see how much games was played already. for example here i see, that in finals series 4 games was played by now (have links in 4 games, no links in 5th), so before i started to watch i possibly have 3rd game's result spoiled"
LoLeventVoDs,33cva2,zloidooraque,2,Sat Apr 25 20:04:17 2015 UTC,"We add placeholder links continuously for each set regardless how many games were played in different intervals, so it looks like thread is being updated no matter how series ended. If there were only 3 games, you will still see 4th link added at some point with 5th missing (really depends when you refresh).  This is to ensure an actual spoiler-free environment.   /u/MrRoyce"

LoLeventVoDs,32qawj,MrRoyce,6,Thu Apr 16 16:42:38 2015 UTC,"Hi there.  LSPL (or rather, LPL Summer Qualifiers) is a lower priority tournament compared to e.g. LPL, LCS or LCK, so it gets very basic coverage (as you may have noticed, there are no Twitch, highlights or discussion links).  However, considering you requested to see highlights, I've added all of them to tables and will continue to include them for the duration of this event! :)"

LoLeventVoDs,32m2nk,KillerBYTE,10,Thu Apr 16 01:00:29 2015 UTC,Froskurinn's casting is actually really good
LoLeventVoDs,32m2nk,Rohbo,-8,Wed Apr 15 12:36:21 2015 UTC,"What's the ""actually"" supposed to imply, there?"
LoLeventVoDs,32m2nk,Geofferic,17,Wed Apr 15 12:45:50 2015 UTC,"That I had never heard her cast before only various 2nd hand opinions. Namely Thooorin advocating her and some people on reddit denigrating her. The ""actually"" implies that I have now had the opportunity to form my own opinion and I thought it was very good."
LoLeventVoDs,32m2nk,Rohbo,4,Wed Apr 15 14:15:40 2015 UTC,"Eh, her casting has its problems. She fangirls really hard to Alex Ich, she has a hard time ending phrases in a way that helps his co-caster to continue the flow of discussion and her off-topic commentary can sometimes create awkward silences. Note that this is also a negative for his co-caster, though.  On the analysis side, she usually omits information over minion wave control, build paths and win conditions.  She's not bad, but she's still a work in progress as a caster, I would say."

LoLeventVoDs,32jzcr,Popkins,6,Wed Apr 15 16:01:15 2015 UTC,All videos are available in 720p. Is that not good enough?
LoLeventVoDs,32jzcr,Estafreak,3,Wed Apr 15 04:40:36 2015 UTC,"The YouTube encoding may be 720p @ 30fps,  but you can clearly tell it was re-encoded from much lower quality source material. The source material looks like 360p @ 15fps, also the gamma is extremely high. You can't magically make a video high quality by re-encoding it at a higher resolution, so the question is why was such a low quality source used? Was that really the best available?"
LoLeventVoDs,32jzcr,Popkins,2,Wed Apr 15 13:23:45 2015 UTC,"Bitrate seems to be really, really low. It's like watching ~three frames per second.   Gamma also seems to be super high which is quite unfortunate."
LoLeventVoDs,32jzcr,Estafreak,2,Wed Apr 15 16:15:21 2015 UTC,That's the in-games settings quality. Kind of sad LPL doesn't use max settings.
LoLeventVoDs,32jzcr,Popkins,2,Wed Apr 15 13:43:10 2015 UTC,In-game settings would never make the video stuttery. :)

LoLeventVoDs,32jzcr,Whatduhfk,3,Wed Apr 15 15:35:09 2015 UTC,"That's not their fault... That's because the LPL english is just indirectly streaming the Chinese stream, it's the same quality as would be on twitch/official Riot VODs."

How do these Chinese teams spend millions on their superstar rosters and offices but we end up with two bronze players casting extremely high level games?  I can't stand them.

LoLeventVoDs,32jzcr,jammyj,1 point,Sat Apr 18 02:10:15 2015 UTC,"I think they were pretty ""on point"". /s  Seriously someone should count how many times that one guy says that throughout the series. Sometimes it didn't even fit the sentence he just threw an on point in there for no reason."
LoLeventVoDs,32jzcr,Sub_Salac,2,Fri Apr 17 16:33:29 2015 UTC,I like Atlus and Papasmithy. Pastrytime has an annoying voice and the other guy only casts a few games anyway. I will admit though Papasmithy has a really canned voice/tone.
LoLeventVoDs,32jzcr,Popkins,1 point,Thu Apr 16 06:17:17 2015 UTC,"One of them is totally obsessed with using dps to mean do damage. Including such gems as ""dps down the Baron"" to mean burst it with double smite consume."
LoLeventVoDs,32jzcr,Wilhelml,-1,Wed Apr 15 20:00:39 2015 UTC,"Only one I don't care for is Atlus. He's a Rivington with a better understanding of the English language. That is not a compliment, as Rivington is the one thing that ruins any casted game for me. I love Pastrytime tbh, his casting gets pretty genuinely hyped imo, which is crucial for a play-by-play. The one thing that separates good Play-by-plays from shitty ones is honesty. Genuine emotion. He has that. And Papasmithy is just a God, you sometimes don't even get the level of insight this guy has for the game in NA LCS, so seeing it in LPL is refreshing. Pretty sophisticated understanding of League(for a caster). The 3rd guy I don't mind too much, dont even know his name. He's just meh.  Seeing this game from way back from NLB Winter(I was around then, I just didnt watch anything other than NA/EU) made me respect Pastrytime and Papasmithy even more, specifically Pastrytime. He's just a loveable goofball who doesn't embarrass himself even close to as much as someone like Rivington does. I wish he'd get silly like he did in that old game on LPL, a-la Doa. It helps when Play-by-play casters have a knack for comedy."

That guy knows less about the game than silver players. He says something ridiculously stupid every other minute.   To each his own but I think this Papasmithy & Pastrytime casting duo is just gameruining."
LoLeventVoDs,32jzcr,Wilhelml,2,Wed Apr 15 10:49:35 2015 UTC,That guy knows less about the game than silver players. He says something ridiculously stupid every other minute   People said the same shit about Monte. Meanwhile nearly all professional analysts respect Papasmithy for his level of insight.
LoLeventVoDs,32jzcr,Sub_Salac,0,Wed Apr 15 13:03:35 2015 UTC,People said the same shit about Monte.   That would only be relevant if it was true at the time.   Meanwhile nearly all professional analysts respect Papasmithy for his level of insight   Can you name all/some of them? Seems pretty weak to me to use such weasel words in a discussion.   To each his own but I feel like that caster duo collectively say a ton of objectively wrong/dumb things in every single game.   Not to mention the generally poor casting.   I'm sure they have a lot of fans and people who like their casting and that's fine but boy would I love to have some alternative.
LoLeventVoDs,32jzcr,Airhwhipper,3,Fri Apr 17 18:13:03 2015 UTC,"Kelsey Moser, Froskurinn, MonteCristo, Raz, Drexxin.  Basically everyone who actually knows anything about Chinese League of Legends, which means you have to exclude pretty much every caster from NA/EU.  By the way, people still say the same things about MonteCristo, even though he's pretty much the single most knowledgeable person about any subject matter that relates to professional League of Legends."

LoLeventVoDs,31mf2e,ThePorphyry,5,Tue Apr 14 22:02:05 2015 UTC,RIOT GIVE THIS MAN REPLAYS FOR THE LOVE OF ALL THAT IS HOLY
LoLeventVoDs,31mf2e,ThePorphyry,-3,Tue Apr 14 16:01:33 2015 UTC,"@ 36 min of SK vs UOL Monte asks riot to give him replay system... THIS WILL NOT HAPPEN UNLESS THE COMMUNITY FORCES IT.  Riot has proven they do not care about high level analysis or pro level concerns, the COMMUNITY NEEDS TO DEMAND REPAY or riot will continue to ignore a vital feature for any esport viable game."
LoLeventVoDs,31mf2e,zloidooraque,2,Tue Apr 14 09:31:35 2015 UTC,"""repay"" for what? it's free to play game lol o_O  also it means you are free to play it or not"
LoLeventVoDs,31mf2e,ThePorphyry,7,Thu Apr 23 03:29:52 2015 UTC,"The reasoning is simple. Riot games is trying to produce a competitive eSport scene revolving around LoL. There are several up and coming mobas, but none have the viewership or player base of League. To maintain a strangle hold on this market Riot has poured tons of money into producing high quality English  broadcasts from markets around the world. They pay two full leagues worth of player salaries, and put up a significant amount of prize money for international tournaments.  Riot really cares about League being respected as an eSport, to the point where it is a primary  objective of their business model. One would think that they would look to past eSport games for essential features or examples for being successful in this market.  Replays are an essential function for competitive LoL players. This functionality would be a huge boon to team analysts and coaches. Just watch Monte's VoD's and see how often he's limited from doing anaylsis because the camera isn't watching an important aspect of gameplay.  If Riot wants to promote competitive play and constantly achieve higher depth of strategy and skill within the League community, giving access to replays is a common sense and fundamental feature that any true eSport shouldn't be caught dead without."
LoLeventVoDs,31mf2e,RandomGuyDota,3,Thu Apr 23 04:28:02 2015 UTC,Dota 2 has replays and really easy system to get into solo bot games. Dunno why Riot doesn't when they're basically printing out money. It's kind of embarrassing to see the most popular team game not have so many features and a really amateur client when their competitors have all these features.
LoLeventVoDs,31mf2e,zloidooraque,3,Tue Apr 28 09:24:05 2015 UTC,"i was just making pun of word ""replay"" incorrectly spelled as ""repay""  i understand what replays are for ((%  sry for making you type so much almost in vain. the most i can do is to upvote as apologies (=  p.s. and speaking of casters, riot may select them better.. there is one caster on LPL, who is whispering or SCREAMING all the way. it's impossible to watch, cuz it's impossible to tweak volume appropriately. and EU LCS casters a so downers. give us joe miller and deman back!"

Would it be possible at least to create links to 5 games if a series is bo5?

LoLeventVoDs,31mf2e,DraycosTFM,0,Wed Apr 15 23:14:53 2015 UTC,"I've gotta admit, Montecristo has always rubbed me the wrong way with the attitude he takes against TSM, plus with him being on the CLG coach, it was a bit hard to like him.  But, these VODs have really opened my eyes as to how knowledgeable he is.  He knows his shit, he's great at analyzing games, and the most important part is that he doesn't sugar-coat anything while maintaining honesty.  I look forward to him releasing more VODs like this in the future."
LoLeventVoDs,31mf2e,ThePorphyry,26,Wed Apr 8 03:35:04 2015 UTC,"I think it's really sad Monte has to piece all this together from vods because there is no replay system for him to show us real analysis.  Over half of his information has to come from the minimap because he can't control the camera movement, he has no way to check if off screen bushes are warded while there is an champion icon covering them, he can't play with the team vision like a spectator to know for sure what/when teams have vision on critical map movements.  Riot please, this is a great game, and the most popular eSport on the scene, when are we going to get such a critical feature as replays???"
LoLeventVoDs,31mf2e,MrRoyce,18,Wed Apr 8 01:37:19 2015 UTC,"I couldn't agree more.  The least they could do is enable replays for tournament realm where those games are played (I suppose) and allow people (content creators if nobody else) to download them. It's insane that after 5 years, we still don't have so many features we should've had years ago, while all others games do."

LoLeventVoDs,31mf2e,Silxnce,7,Mon Apr 6 13:48:42 2015 UTC,Can you expand on why you're not so keen on him?
LoLeventVoDs,31mf2e,IeIgHtNiNe,7,Mon Apr 6 14:21:38 2015 UTC,"My one and only problem with him is that he tends to turn his nose up at NA and EU a tiny bit, and it is just in those moments that I'm like, ""ugh this snooty douche.""  But to be perfectly 100% honest, those moments only come when others, specifically analysts and journalists, ask him about NA and EU teams as compared to Korean teams, or ask him his Korean-based opinion in kind of a jokey, baiting way.  So what is he really going to say?  That NA and EU are better than, or at least equal to, Korea?  No way. That would be a lie.  So I really don't fault him for that too much.  It's just the way that he does it and how his personality comes off in those times that irks me.  But I soon forget it.  Everything else he does is awesome."
LoLeventVoDs,31mf2e,Dr_Irrelephant,8,Wed Apr 8 23:14:27 2015 UTC,"My biggest issue with him is that he tends to talk like games are already over before they even happen. He's very disrespectful to underdogs (particularly against Koreans) and it's pretty annoying as a viewer. Then when upsets happen all he can talk about is how the favorites weren't trying/played terrible.  I honestly can't think of a single talking head in any other competitive sport or game who talks with such certainty about who will win a game that hadn't happened yet.   Honestly, he's probably right 99% of the time, it's just not very sporting or interesting to watch."
LoLeventVoDs,31mf2e,mathbandit,19,Mon Apr 6 16:09:40 2015 UTC,"It's a commentary style that harkens to the fact that LoL is a lot like chess. In high-level chess, if I take a Bishop from you without you getting something in return, the game is over. Period, the end. In top-level chess, even winning a single Pawn without compensation can mean the game is over.  A lot of the same ideas exist in high-level League play. If a hyperscaling lategame comp gets to 20 minutes against a team of lane bullies down by only 4k gold, the game is over."
LoLeventVoDs,31mf2e,sorator,1 point,Mon Apr 6 23:23:44 2015 UTC,"Of course, this can become a problem when people try and apply the same attitude to non-top-level League play... like Bronze.  But that's true of many elements of top-level play, not just this."
LoLeventVoDs,31mf2e,Dr_Irrelephant,3,Sat Apr 18 13:44:43 2015 UTC,"Oh that's not my problem at all, I fully understand that. I don't like when he counts teams out before the game has even started."
LoLeventVoDs,31mf2e,TheComputerLovesYou,2,Tue Apr 7 04:25:30 2015 UTC,"I've rarely seen that.  He's pretty clear when comps are better than other comps, but he usually says something like ""It will be an uphill battle for [Team X] here, since they don't have many ways to engage past a Janna and they risk getting poked out before a fight starts"""
LoLeventVoDs,31mf2e,Dr_Irrelephant,1 point,Sat Apr 11 03:13:44 2015 UTC,"Eh, go back and watch some vods of WE upsetting a Korean team at IEM, he gave them no chance and it wasn't their comp."
LoLeventVoDs,31mf2e,hubertstephen,1 point,Sat Apr 11 05:05:44 2015 UTC,I think a lot of people didn't give WE a chance.
LoLeventVoDs,31mf2e,Elfking88,15,Wed Apr 22 19:51:11 2015 UTC,"I just don't like his personality that much, what I've seen of it at least... I'm just not keen, I don't hate him or anything, I just don't normally seek out interviews with him, or his commentary and stuff, but I watched one his post game analyses the other day and then found myself watching all of them.  Despite my personal feelings, these videos are very good and I very much enjoy watching him go through matches and point the little things out and I do not deny that the guy knows what he is talking about."
LoLeventVoDs,31mf2e,TheHeavyMetalNerd,12,Mon Apr 6 14:42:19 2015 UTC,"I'm the exact opposite. I'd heard so many negative things about him from reddit that I thought he was some kind of especially smug snake, but after watching him in the LCK and Summoning Insight I actually like his personality."
LoLeventVoDs,31mf2e,isaaclw,6,Mon Apr 6 17:34:00 2015 UTC,"He is sorta smug when he explains stuff, but I wonder if you sort of have to be to judge what other people are choosing to do.   Which is why we watch him."
LoLeventVoDs,31mf2e,Geofferic,2,Tue Apr 7 12:35:20 2015 UTC,I think we impart the smugness to him.  It's sort of what we expect when we watch someone break down other peoples' performances so minutely.
LoLeventVoDs,31mf2e,BuckeyeBentley,8,Fri Apr 17 00:57:04 2015 UTC,"I'm not the other guy, but I think Monte is hilarious and he obviously knows his shit.  CHOO CHOO KOREAN HYPE TRAIN"
LoLeventVoDs,31mf2e,Geofferic,1 point,Tue Apr 7 05:52:23 2015 UTC,The dude is so funny and he doesn't take himself nearly as seriously as others take him.  I think he's a class act.

LoLeventVoDs,31mf2e,CleverTeller,42,Mon Apr 6 14:19:11 2015 UTC,"Haha, you almost got that right :)  On a more serious note, we definitely want  to include more stuff like this, just got to figure out what's the best approach. We don't want to 'spam' subreddit with non-tournament threads, but I'm sure there is a genuine interested in reviews like this - Rapidstar does great ones too, but not as frequent as Monte AFAIK.  If people would like, we could also include all podcasts and stuff in one megathread and have it updated daily/weekly. It's definitely something to consider and we'd love any suggestions and ideas you (and others) may have!"

LoLeventVoDs,31mf2e,ChrisCrossX,2,Tue Apr 7 05:07:37 2015 UTC,I enjoy these a large amount and learn a lot. I really hope that these can become more common from other people as well.
LoLeventVoDs,31mf2e,celtica311,-6,Mon Apr 6 19:00:10 2015 UTC,"No disrespect, but I do not think these kind of posts are the reason people are subscribing to this subreddit. People use this because it's spoiler free and greatly organized.  People can easily access all of MCs content by subbing to his channel, so why this thread? Don't think this really belongs here."
LoLeventVoDs,31mf2e,JaBoi_Jared,3,Mon Apr 6 17:22:34 2015 UTC,"I like having this here. I follow multiple leagues and already have LEV bookmarked so when I want to watch something like this it is, as you said, greatly organized.  If it shouldn't be here because I can access it on youtube, then LCS should either because it is on youtube and Riot's own spoiler free vod site."

LoLeventVoDs,31mf2e,2short4astormtrooper,12,Mon Apr 6 16:08:22 2015 UTC,"I am not a fan of that, since they do not talk about the games directly, can be drama, or just for the fans/casual players.  Of course, that is my opinion. I think setting up a megathread to discuss this would be the best course of action for this subreddit."
LoLeventVoDs,31mf2e,prowness,1 point,Tue Apr 7 07:58:27 2015 UTC,"What if they had a separate, related sub, like ""lol show vods"" or something?"
LoLeventVoDs,31mf2e,Geofferic,2,Mon Apr 13 07:30:20 2015 UTC,"That would be great. That way we can include the TSM reality series, house tours, etc. for those that want it."

LoLeventVoDs,31mf2e,MrRoyce,3,Fri Apr 10 20:41:25 2015 UTC,"If there is room, you could maybe include the links in the weekly threads you already put up?  Kind of a one-stop shop and keeps every a bit cleaner."
LoLeventVoDs,31mf2e,Sysfin,4,Mon Apr 6 15:16:08 2015 UTC,I'd just like to point out that we are not the ones doing those great weekly round ups. All credit goes to /u/ajsadler who keeps finding a way to create great compilations to submit to /r/leagueoflegends.
LoLeventVoDs,31mf2e,PinkyWitchy,4,Mon Apr 6 20:30:13 2015 UTC,"What about having tags/filters?  That way someone could filter out stuff they don't want. [TOURNAMENTS][ANALYSIS][SEASON] Sure that wouldn't do much right now but if more people do analysis... Like have 1 thread for Monte's analysis and 1 thread for Rapidstar, assuming he does enough to warrant a thread and 1 for misc analysis. Like say Udyr is played competitively, far fetched I know, and Trick2g does a good analysis of that game or maybe Yi is played and Cowsep does a commentary.  A misc thread could be an appropriate place for any of the high elo 1-trick ponies to give analysis at a higher level then they normally are able to give on their soloq streams."

Hopefully this will change in near future, because I feel like smaller regions deserve proper coverage as well (OPL has it!).  Also, since you were first to comment on a thread that most likely won't get much attention, it's only fair that you get a RP card as well! Can you tell me what server you're playing on (EU, NA, OCE, BR players are the ones we can gift at the moment)? Keep in mind you will receive code via PM here on reddit around April 12th when we'll announce/list all winners."
LoLeventVoDs,31ki2q,B2theS,4,Mon Apr 6 01:18:11 2015 UTC,I hope RiotTurkey hires some good english speaking shoutcasters. I'm a Turkish player and I can't stand the comentaries of turkish shoutcasters. Sometimes they're raging at players decisions while shoutcasting. I find them quite unprofessional but Turkish community loves them.

In this case, the spoiler was telling people that there was a Game 4 - meaning that you can figure out who won previous games..

LoLeventVoDs,31fbus,CapnWracker,2,Mon Apr 6 01:18:37 2015 UTC,"I agree. Even in the LCK it seems like there is far less ""caster analysis, fantasy league picks (OHO?), and just general bullshit"" in between games.  On a kind of related note the NA and EU LCS should follow the same format as LCK or LPL where the teams play more than a BO1. I think that this would make it more interesting as some teams are really good at BO3, but you really never get to see that from NA and EU unless they make it to intl tournaments or Worlds/Playoffs. I was thinking about just making a post about this because it seems the format of NA and EU lcs is outdated/watered down."

From time to time, when you open the link and it's buffering, you will see a part of the game/stream that happened way after that particular timestamp you're trying to start from. This is why I always recommend people not to look at the stream tab until they hear the sound, because that's when VOD loaded and will continue to play from that timestamp.

If a best of 5 is currently at 2-0, if the video has 40 minutes left, I know who wins game 3.  Even if it's 1-0 and the video has 80 minutes left, I know thats not enough time for 3 games, so again I know the winner."
LoLeventVoDs,31fbus,rollie82,3,Sun Apr 5 10:31:04 2015 UTC,"Sadly, you can find spoilers in any sort of VOD - even the YouTube ones, if you see a video is 40 minutes long, that's also sort of a spoiler since you know it's not going to be very long. Luckily, we include pre & post game stuff so it's hard to tell when the game is exactly going to end, but it's still not 100% spoiler free. Nothing much we can do about it, one of the possibilities is to make every video 1h 30 minutes long and add black screen to remaining part of the VOD, but we yet have to tackle that idea and see if we can do it for every game we upload (LCS, LPL).  /u/MrRoyce"
LoLeventVoDs,31fbus,gahlo,1 point,Sun Apr 5 11:40:56 2015 UTC,"Actually, something can be done about sidebar/comment spoilers. Youtube links can be made to occupy the entire browser window.  Take a youtube link such as http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vr3x_RRJdd4  and change it to http://www.youtube.com/v/vr3x_RRJdd4  by cutting out the watch?v= with v/  Unfortunately, the only way I've found to timestamp videos this way is by adding &start=X where X is the # of seconds. The &t=XmYs format doesn't work. So, starting that video in this format at 88 seconds would be https://www.youtube.com/v/vr3x_RRJdd4&start=88  Now the only things in the way of pure spoiler free are the duration bar and end of video suggestions. =]"
LoLeventVoDs,31fbus,rollie82,2,Sun Apr 5 12:17:52 2015 UTC,"Is that something you want to do, but it just seems like a lot of effort?  I can probably write a program that will allow you to do this easily, assuming the videos are in AVI format or something else easily manageable."
LoLeventVoDs,31fbus,MrRoyce,4,Sun Apr 5 12:33:27 2015 UTC,"I think videos are in .mkv format, I'm not 100% sure, but I can look into it.  We'd love to use this if not sooner, then for next playoffs or S5 Worlds, I believe it would be great for many people who can't keep their eyes away from the control bar where time is shown."
LoLeventVoDs,31fbus,LKBN,10,Mon Apr 6 12:24:46 2015 UTC,"For some reason, the first game's youtube link only has 360p (checked several hours ago and now), perhaps an error?"

LoLeventVoDs,30zot9,ThugaPT,4,Wed Apr 1 19:50:08 2015 UTC,"Probably because you only come to the playoff vod page if you want to see the playoffs, which kind of means you already know at least the team that qualified.

LoLeventVoDs,30y2kx,Demtrollzz,2,Wed Apr 8 19:33:49 2015 UTC,"Yes. EU CS is not high on our priority list and in order to have it properly updated (read: less work to do for updaters), we only include YouTube VODs - normally this tournament is not covered live (except during the playoffs), so grabbing bunch of twitch links afterwards would bring us back to 2014 when we had a lot on 'incomplete' tournaments since nobody wanted to bother with links that are only used by <20% (according to our survey in early 2014).  You can see this for many other tournaments too, OPL, CBLoL and so on. It would be too hard to maintain and keep updated otherwise."

I went ahead and created tables for today and have added Twitch links, but sadly, the whole game is still not available as Twitch didn't process next 30 minute segment. You can start watching right away and by the time you get to the end of the stream, simply refresh the page and you should have additional 30 minutes of VOD.  /u/MrRoyce"

LoLeventVoDs,2ywjmx,PRIV00,3,Sat Mar 14 18:07:33 2015 UTC,Are the twitch links working for anyone? The VoD loads so slow for me that it isn't even watchable.
LoLeventVoDs,2ywjmx,MrRoyce,21,Fri Mar 13 13:24:50 2015 UTC,"This is why most people will always choose YouTube mirror over Twitch VOD - it just has so many problems from stuttering, buffering slowly to showing a picture from somewhere later in the stream when you first open the link and potentially spoiling outcome of the game. Luckily, YouTube VODs are usually up within an hour, hour and a half after game ends."
LoLeventVoDs,2ywjmx,Golden_Kumquat,6,Fri Mar 13 13:34:00 2015 UTC,Also because I can watch the Youtube VoDs at 125% speed.

LoLeventVoDs,2ywjmx,catscratch182,2,Fri Mar 13 13:46:57 2015 UTC,"Oh, this happens because Twitch VODs are released in ~30 minute segments - you only need to remember where it stopped, for example at 2h29m, refresh the page and you should have another 30 minutes available right away or  shortly."

LoLeventVoDs,2ywjmx,abzchillout,3,Mon Mar 16 00:10:43 2015 UTC,"Hi there. From a visitors point of view, without knowing the outcome of BO5, it's hard to tell based on links available how many games there were - just because YouTube links are missing, you can only predict the outcome since YouTube VODs are always at least an hour or even two late compared to Twitch links (which were in table with timestamps).  Although I'll take the blame for this one since I simply forgot to add YouTube links an hour ago when I originally intended to do so (was trying to pretend that thread is being updated live even after games were over so people wouldn't be able to tell that it was over earlier just because there were 3 rows of links added in one update)."

LoLeventVoDs,2ywjmx,Sheepsaurus,1 point,Sun Mar 15 01:55:42 2015 UTC,The stream should start in 5 minutes
LoLeventVoDs,2ywjmx,Sheepsaurus,1 point,Sun Mar 15 02:26:05 2015 UTC,"Question here. Since the VoD's are set to private, is there any way you guys could upload filler videos of some typical times so as to not spoil the whole thing by seeing that there's not another video, so X team must have won?   Like if TSM is up 1-0, and we can see there is only 2 more videos, it's pretty obvious what happened. But if you filled out the rest of the 7 games with private videos that were around and hour-ish that were filler, it might help to not spoil it that way.   Just a thought."
LoLeventVoDs,2ywjmx,MrRoyce,1 point,Sun Mar 15 16:21:49 2015 UTC,"Hi there, which VOD is set to private? None should be!  As for your comment regarding videos that would serve as a placeholder, we already tried that, but someone reported them and YouTube issues as a community guidelines strike, since we had a misleading title (which makes sense in a way, people see there's a game that wasn't played and they're suddenly interested to watch it, but in return they get nothing from what was described in title). :/"
LoLeventVoDs,2ywjmx,Sheepsaurus,1 point,Sun Mar 15 16:55:36 2015 UTC,"I had thought that I navigated to a private video yesterday (WE vs GET).   And I guess I figured you guys had tried that already, but figured it was worth asking about. I appreciate the response!"
LoLeventVoDs,2ywjmx,rossmjr,1 point,Sun Mar 15 17:30:48 2015 UTC,"You actually had, there was a small problem with that video so we replaced it with fixed version. I thought you were trying to watch something now and had that issue :)  We'll definitely look into something like this for S5 Worlds. I know we have a lot of time until that happens, but it should give us enough time to explore other options and maybe ask YouTube and see how we can handle this issue."

LoLeventVoDs,2ywjmx,MrRoyce,1 point,Sun Mar 15 21:58:08 2015 UTC,"Oh, that makes sense. Although it's a spoiler placeholder, it can actually make people think that there were 4 games played since thread is still being updated as if games were being played.  I feel like the best way to avoid this situation is to not update anything after BO5 series ends and latest game is available and then an hour later just add remaining placeholder links.

I do use a different skin and it's more of a corner case (assuming plain reddit doesn't burn everyone else's eyes with its whiteness). I was just sad to have it spoiled. My plan is to turn it off before entering any threads in this sub from now on I suppose (or seeing if it's easy to edit the style)."

LoLeventVoDs,2ywjmx,gitykinz,1 point,Tue Mar 17 15:16:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah, putting in the false time code seems to work. Putting in times for all of the links would probably hide it for me even with the color changes (for the highlights I guess you could just use the same youtube link as the actual game with another time code).   I'm sure I could adjust to turning it off when watching some vods here(it's pretty easy to turn it off and on).. This is another potential solution though; it looks pretty effective. Slightly more effort required for it on your guys' part so it's up to you, this sub is pretty great either way. It probably comes down to how many people are affected by it. I haven't seen other people comment on it, though I doubt I'm the one and only."

Azubu is so unreliable and hard to record from that every attempt we've had on English stream ended with half of the stuff missing (KR stream had no issues whatsoever).

(The caitlyn had kill threat on the other champion if she could've landed one additional auto but he was just barely out of range for the second one otherwise an ace in the hole would've been gg).

Our biggest problem is 40k characters limit per thread, so if we were to include even more links, we'd run out of space even quicker - and I don't think people want to spend a few minutes every other time they come to this subreddit just to search for new VOD threads so they can find the latest games because we make new thread every few weeks. So we aim for two threads per split, but with some slight adjustments, we can look into making post-game discussion links available from start of the split without cutting LCS in more parts than what we have currently - I'll see what can be done about it, as long as people actually want those threads linked here."

I am also working on a different idea to help people find the best games for a particular week.  -/u/Rexozord

LoLeventVoDs,2xckeu,MalevolentLemons,2,Mon Mar 9 02:58:10 2015 UTC,"Hey there.  I'll make sure to keep this week up-to-date and include highlights as well. We definitely won't keep post-match discussion threads anymore, not because it's more work (it's actually matter of minutes to add links for that) but rather because not every game has such thread on /r/leagueoflegends.   Once LPL is into Playoffs, we'll make sure to include those as well again, as well as proper updates with Twitch & YouTube links to VODs and highlights on top of all that. Thanks for following LPL and leaving a comment - as long as people have interest in less popular tournaments, it motivates us to keep them updated!"

Either a youtube link or just a link to a column view/table. It would be nice, for instance, when I'd start to watch the 6th day of the Spring Split to know which teams are on top/at the bottom etc. This knowledge can make some games more exciting to watch."

Just PM me some basic instructions on how to format the pages, and I should be good to go.  How far back do you want these team pages to run? I think the easiest way to avoid missing any matches is to do it event-by-event instead of team-by-team, so it might be easiest if you gave me an event covered by LolEventVods and I can just start there and work my way forward (or backwards, if you want to start with most recent games) from there. If you would prefer I do it team-by-team, of course, that's fine too!"
LoLeventVoDs,2x8ymq,fl0rd,1 point,Fri Mar 27 00:41:30 2015 UTC,"Ok, so basically we used to have a way how to make things faster and it was possible to just copy/paste all tables in Notepad++ and somehow filter only ONE team. I will need to follow up on this with former member of the team, /u/rockin_munki and see if he still remembers how to do it since it was his method we used to create existing pages for LCS teams back in 2013.   http://www.reddit.com/r/LoLeventVoDs/wiki/fnatic  I think this is a good format and we can obviously improve this later on, as long as we have all games/tables created. But I really don't recommend investing much time into this until I find a way to use old way to do this which would make things go WAY faster!"

The Event Horizon really splits fights and if anything will stun people for 2-3 seconds. Also, he hits anyone that uses AP hard. The reason he's good as a support would probably be due to the fact that he doesn't necessarily need money to do either of these things, as his ult scales with targets AP and his stun is AOE Utility"

LoLeventVoDs,2x1sek,IFVIBHU,33,Sat Apr 11 13:31:34 2015 UTC,"I think a huge part of that quality comes from the difference between best of 3 sets vs the best of 1 in the NA/EU lcs.  Pick ban strategies have 10 times more depth, teams have to learn  different composition strategies or they will get banned out games 2/3, and they're so much more prepared and practiced for post season play at Worlds. I think the fact EU/NA plays Bo1 all season neuters their ability to compete at international events like IEM or Worlds."
LoLeventVoDs,2x1sek,Solypsys,10,Wed Feb 25 00:44:03 2015 UTC,"this  x1000 I LOVE the best of 3 format, you get to see teams adapt on the fly and what becomes priority for that set.  just think if the CLG vs TSM game was a best of 3 after that first game...."
LoLeventVoDs,2x1sek,proudfoot86,9,Wed Feb 25 02:09:24 2015 UTC,"Yup, I agree. Riot should seriously consider changing LCS format to BO3. Hell, if that's not doable, at least BO2 would make more sense because the current format is doing harm to EU/NA teams way more than most think, IMO."
LoLeventVoDs,2x1sek,MrRoyce,3,Wed Feb 25 02:40:33 2015 UTC,Yeah it really pays off when teams go to worlds since they will be more adapted to BO format
LoLeventVoDs,2x1sek,crimethinking,1 point,Wed Feb 25 08:25:56 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately there's not enough competition in the NA scene to warrant BO3s. Sure they would be great for TSM vs CLG vs C9 but no one would watch them for the other 80% of the matchups.  If they do anything they need to start with a bunch of teams and eliminate teams every week so as time goes on the matchups get more and more competitive, that's what Korea used to do though I don't think they do it now."
LoLeventVoDs,2x1sek,marjamrob,1 point,Wed Feb 25 13:13:07 2015 UTC,"I expect a challenge with doing Bo3s, or even Bo2s, in NA and EU is that they would have twice or three times as much content to broadcast, and there's no guarantee that the viewership is there to justify it. They'd probably be moving from two broadcast days per week to three or four broadcast days. It might not be financially feasible.  That's just me playing devil's advocate, though. As a fan, I'd love to see Bo3s in NA/EU."
LoLeventVoDs,2x1sek,ZombieTitan,1 point,Thu Feb 26 23:35:55 2015 UTC,"That's a good point.   If LCS didn't expand to 10 teams, it would be perfectly possible to run 2 x BO3 series in just two days as it is now, but with 10 teams for each LCS, that's 10 x BO3 per week and potentially 30 games (we already had an increase from 16 games per week to 20 this season). In theory, it would be doable if LCS was running for 5 days: EU 2 days with 2 BO3's and then on Friday one BO3 from EU and one from NA and then four more during the weekend for LCS NA.  There is obviously place for improvement, but I feel like Riot is not aiming for OGN's format but rather something more similar to how other sports work (hockey, football/soccer, basketball...). I personally don't think that's very good - there'd be way more excitement in community if TSM & CLG were to play BO3 twice over ~2 months and teams would also get prepared way better for international tournaments. Luckily, there's IEM so teams from EU & NA that are attending will be able to experience what Korean (and Chinese to some extent) are doing throughout the whole season.  As for viewership, I doubt there'd be a lot of issue, at least there wouldn't be for LCS NA :) However, you do have a good point when it comes to money and although Riot probably doesn't care about that aspect as much when it comes to eSports, they surely can't afford to throw it around as if we were paying $40 for just one (ultimate) skin. Oh wait...   :)"
LoLeventVoDs,2x1sek,Nimitz87,3,Wed Feb 25 15:56:00 2015 UTC,I would say that OGN > LPL (not by much) > EU/NA LCS (BY FAR).

LoLeventVoDs,2x1sek,laforge,1 point,Wed Feb 25 21:05:21 2015 UTC,"you know after watching this year for the first time and going back to the LCS everything is of higher quality. The play is more strategic, the shot calling is more knowledgeable , and DOA is a great play by play caller as well. I also enjoy the booth play , and camera work of OGN vs the lcs player web cam style setup.  watching the CLG vs TSM game really proved to me just how ahead  the korean teams are in team fighting and coordination, those team fights were abysmal at best and almost every team in korea can team fight better then what was displayed in that game."

Take care with how (and in which order) you insert the links for the VOD tho, because as it's done right now I got spoiled for the third matchs of the series (see http://imgur.com/1RHmEbm).  EDIT: And also the second match, because whoever win the first..."

We've prepared new flairs so it's easier to figure out which event is ongoing and which ended, new sidebar bot with official Riot's (more accurate, better updated) API, different header, new thumbnails and some other stuff! We're getting really close to maximum when it comes to visual appearance due to reddit's CSS limit, but we're working with what we have available!   Also, we are now covering TWELVE (12) ongoing tournaments and won't stop there. We want to make LoLeventVODs #1 VODs resource in all of League and so far, with all your help (visiting, upvoting, commenting, reporting spoilers & mistakes etc) we're on a way to achieve just that!"

LoLeventVoDs,2wexur,antisocialmogul,3,Thu Feb 19 16:42:36 2015 UTC,Hi.  Will be there any highlights for these matches like LCS ? I would like to watch them instead of the whole match. :)
LoLeventVoDs,2wexur,DeusExMachinae,3,Sun Feb 22 12:15:25 2015 UTC,Only some of the matches have casters?
LoLeventVoDs,2wexur,ThugaPT,4,Thu Feb 26 03:37:57 2015 UTC,"Not all the matches are casted, some are pre-recorded  /u/iaresosorry"
LoLeventVoDs,2wexur,macshot7m,2,Thu Feb 26 05:10:47 2015 UTC,Is there any way to tell which is which? The casters help to fill in the less exciting moments for me.
LoLeventVoDs,2wexur,Punistick,3,Thu Mar 26 18:42:46 2015 UTC,"Just a heads-up, the FSN vs NME from W2D1 is actually directing to the W2D2 game. /u/MrRoyce  /u/Punistick"

LoLeventVoDs,2wexur,Raymoondo,2,Thu Feb 26 12:22:46 2015 UTC,Quick question: these games are played online or are they played together in the same stadium that normal LCS games are played?
LoLeventVoDs,2wexur,Porphyrous,2,Thu Feb 19 18:03:38 2015 UTC,"The games are played online, so no need to have them in the studio. Usually playoffs are played in the studio."
LoLeventVoDs,2wexur,MrRoyce,1 point,Thu Feb 19 18:06:54 2015 UTC,Could you add in some feature that shows whether a game was casted or not please :D
LoLeventVoDs,2wexur,Porphyrous,3,Wed Mar 11 03:03:27 2015 UTC,"Hey. That would be a good idea if we didn't know which games will or will not be casted - so far, all games from Day 1 were/will not (be) casted by Riot, however Archarom casts EU games so we add those in table under ""Commentary"" column.  /u/MrRoyce"

LoLeventVoDs,2wcm4m,StyX_Shigeru,3,Wed Feb 18 20:41:14 2015 UTC,Why is there no commentary? I was watching live earlier and it had them.
LoLeventVoDs,2wcm4m,tehSQUEE,3,Wed Feb 18 20:45:47 2015 UTC,"Day 1 games were not broadcasted, that's why they have no comments. Day 2 are all fine as they were aired live tonight :)"
LoLeventVoDs,2wcm4m,Kenupisse,3,Wed Feb 18 20:50:56 2015 UTC,Any recommendation for the match to see?
LoLeventVoDs,2wcm4m,tachikoma01,2,Wed Feb 18 21:05:03 2015 UTC,Is it just me or are these delayed? Things in game happen many seconds before the commentary does and it could just be me but I'm not sure
LoLeventVoDs,2wcm4m,MeLlamoBigD,1 point,Thu Feb 19 01:05:40 2015 UTC,"Hey. Could you maybe recheck the videos again to see if you're having same issue still? Also, are you by any chance using Google Chrome?"
LoLeventVoDs,2wcm4m,MrRoyce,2,Thu Feb 19 12:41:48 2015 UTC,"I just tried watching all 3 games and none of them had the issue anymore :) I am using Chrome by the way, thank you very much for the fix."
LoLeventVoDs,2wcm4m,MeLlamoBigD,1 point,Thu Feb 19 15:07:04 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, we didn't actually fix anything - YouTube has some issues when video is uploaded and audio is out of sync from time to time. This issue has been reported almost only by Chrome users so we came to conclusion, after also testing it that it works fine for the most part with Firefox. I'd recommend you use alternative browser, maybe even Interner Explorer if you encounter such issue again, whether it's on our channel, Riot's or someone elses - or simply wait a few hours until YouTube sorts the issue itself :)"
LoLeventVoDs,2wcm4m,MrRoyce,1 point,Thu Feb 19 15:09:37 2015 UTC,I also have this issue on firefox for both the eu and na challenger series.

LoLeventVoDs,2wcm4m,PrayWithMe,1 point,Wed Feb 25 19:31:42 2015 UTC,"Hey there. It takes anywhere between 15 and 60 minutes for video to be processed (the whole uploading process takes couple of minutes, but YouTube needs quite some time to process the video afterwards) - this depends on video length.  Video should be available at least in 480p within an hour, if not 720p HD by then."
LoLeventVoDs,2wcm4m,MrRoyce,1 point,Wed Feb 25 19:52:48 2015 UTC,Thanks for fast answer! Looking forward to watching it!  And thanks again for all your hard work!

LoLeventVoDs,2wcm4m,PrayWithMe,2,Wed Feb 25 21:13:03 2015 UTC,"Hey, you're not annoying at all - you can ask ANYTHING at ANY time, I love reading new comments on this sub :)  Anyway, EU & NA CS don't/won't have official commentary for Day 1, however we're looking into possible solutions to have those games casted after all!  /u/MrRoyce"
LoLeventVoDs,2wcm4m,PrayWithMe,2,Wed Feb 25 21:19:40 2015 UTC,"Oh, perfect! Thanks for being so dedicated to it!   And I'm not new, but just was a lurker, haha."

LoLeventVoDs,2wcm4m,silasdoom,4,Wed Feb 25 18:23:57 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, it looks like that. Would you be interested in VODs with non-official Riot commentary (if the casting would be on decent level, that is)?"
LoLeventVoDs,2wcm4m,SmexyPro,2,Wed Feb 25 18:54:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah, if there's no official commentary, that would be a pretty awesome alternative."

LoLeventVoDs,2wcm4m,queen_ln_the_north,2,Thu Feb 26 00:08:57 2015 UTC,"The game was paused first due to Brokenshard having packet loss problems they restarted the game 10 mins before their pause time ranout, then Mousesports had to pause the game cause their mid laner got dced and they used all their pause time, wich made them forfeit the game.  TL'DR: Mousesports got Ddosed and had to forfeit the game."

Maybe if we can get more exposure for smaller Leagues all will have English casting at some point - like LPL does nowadays!"
LoLeventVoDs,2vg5fb,marjamrob,3,Tue Feb 10 19:47:17 2015 UTC,"Actually, they do exist, I'm not sure who is casting them, but there is an official Azubu channel. http://www.azubu.tv/LJLen"
LoLeventVoDs,2vg5fb,marjamrob,2,Wed Feb 11 01:22:08 2015 UTC,"Are those casted live? Or over a VOD like LMS was for a week or so? Azubu is pain in the ass for linking anyway, might be worth recording and uploading to YT instead - it would actually be less time and effort, haha :)  Thank you for the link!"
LoLeventVoDs,2vg5fb,Gallifrasian,5,Wed Feb 11 01:28:03 2015 UTC,"From watching part of the first one, it appears to be voiced over live, on the Azubu Japanese stream, almost identical to what is done for the English Solo King broadcast. (The upload times are the same for both)"
LoLeventVoDs,2vg5fb,icedpingu,3,Wed Feb 11 01:33:30 2015 UTC,"Yes, they are live.  I watched them on Azubu live.  Kind of weird though.  Might just be because the casters are new."
LoLeventVoDs,2vg5fb,marjamrob,1 point,Wed Feb 11 09:44:03 2015 UTC,"Yes they are live and sometimes casted with two people. Unfortunately I don't know their names, but they are really good. The only sad thing is, about 30 people watching this stream, where the one on twitch has around 1600 viewers even though the Japanese viewers have their own broadcasting site => niconico live"

LoLeventVoDs,2vg5fb,Noil75012,2,Tue Feb 10 23:03:14 2015 UTC,"At the moment, neither we or the guys behind eSports Recaps (and I assume LoLstatsGG) have those plans, but if this league grows and it's popularity, it's definitely a possibility!  However, there's a cool alternative called ""LJL Big Plays Montage"", Round 1: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEyCjYMNp40  & Round 2: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zi7iqdLMxU, so if you'd rather see some good clips from LJL instead of full VOD, that's something too!"

LoLeventVoDs,2uunlr,MrRoyce,4,Tue Mar 3 02:42:06 2015 UTC,"This is exactly the kind of comment I've been waiting for :)  Basically, we've had a small experiment where neither OPL or LJL were being updated for a little while (LJL specifically for 2 weekends now) and were wondering if people are still following the threads/updates - I mean, if there's not a single comment, there's not much point to keep things updated if nobody wants to watch those stuff. I know it's a weird way to look at things, but covering 12 ongoing tournaments is a bit more difficult than just LCS.  However, I'll update OPL with all latest VODs later today!"
LoLeventVoDs,2uunlr,brunothepig,5,Tue Mar 3 09:40:04 2015 UTC,"Just to note, I was checking back every week, but when I didn't see it updated I just watched the stream on Youtube since it's relatively short and easy to find. So your experiment may have been ruined by people like me being too lazy to comment. :P"

LoLeventVoDs,2uunlr,brunothepig,2,Wed Mar 4 04:26:29 2015 UTC,"I am terrible at remembering specific games. Immunity vs Sudden Fear in round 2 had some sweet Swain play, so if you like off-meta picks that's a cool game to watch. The top three teams are Chiefs, Dire Wolves and Legacy, and there's not a lot separating them. So any games between those three will probably be pretty good."

It indeed was forgotten - basically, only /u/lolw00t and me have interest to cover this thread and with so many other things going on recently and OPL being so low on front page it's no wonder we forgot to include latest set of VODs (final week + two semifinals), but I went ahead and updated thread to include all available VODs and will make sure finals are added in timely manner for your viewing pleasure! :)  We'll definitely have proper updates for OPL in next split!"

Thats how badass he is and thats how he lets the opposing team know that he is on the other side of champ select in normal(solo ranked) games.﻿"

LoLeventVoDs,2tx8ou,AstroPhysician,3,Wed Jan 28 22:08:43 2015 UTC,its so different to watch without the in-game sounds.

LoLeventVoDs,2tx8ou,LunaluxUmbrus,1 point,Wed Jan 28 19:43:46 2015 UTC,Spoiler tags please! Visitors of this subreddit will know that the first game was done after two games and because of your comment they would know the winner after watching game 1.

LoLeventVoDs,2tx8ou,LunaluxUmbrus,1 point,Wed Jan 28 21:04:26 2015 UTC,"Do they colors of the links look off to anyone else? The 3rd match links all look to be a different color than the first two, as there was no 3rd match in either case. Could be that the Reddit font changes brought this on.  Edit: Sorry this looks idiotic as a full spoiler, but the whole thing seemed like a spoiler."

Could be a problem only because of RES, but is this fixable in any way? Else you get spoilered by knowing that there is no third game..."
LoLeventVoDs,2tx8ou,MrRoyce,2,Thu Jan 29 16:00:15 2015 UTC,"Hello. First of all, I'm sorry if you got spoiled, it wasn't our intention! Second, this is the last tournament with such placeholder links, we will start using random YouTube links in order to keep things spoiler free all the way. And third, which might be related, do you have subreddits custom style enabled?"

LoLeventVoDs,2tjhh4,Zargone,12,Sun Jan 25 17:11:14 2015 UTC,"Reminder there is a known bug with Sivir.  If an auto attack hits her the same frame as her spell shield pops from a spell the auto attack is cancelled/blocked.  All teams have been made aware of this and the fact that there will not be a reset in the event the bug occurs.  The casters announced this during the pre-show.  Yes!  We are live into the action!   What was up with Rivington and the lipstick?  It was very apparent both casters were, did they lose a bet?"
LoLeventVoDs,2tjhh4,Grumblecakes,23,Sat Jan 24 20:41:05 2015 UTC,"Lip coloring for males is common when preparing for events under intense lighting that can make light colored lips seem to disappear (eg stage performances, broadcasting.) If done correctly it simply makes the lips appear normally colored."

LoLeventVoDs,2tjhh4,vegetablestew,3,Sat Jan 24 22:24:08 2015 UTC,Nah he just made out with a hooker backstage first. Hooker for confidence.
LoLeventVoDs,2tjhh4,Zargone,4,Mon Jan 26 20:50:52 2015 UTC,"Awesome!  I did not know this, would be reasonable why Rivington's lips were hot pink.  I was initially led to believe it was a bet/joke because he appeared to attempt to cover it."
LoLeventVoDs,2tjhh4,ProjektTHOR,9,Sat Jan 24 22:49:05 2015 UTC,Just because he tried to cover it doesn't mean it wasn't intentional. They probably didn't notice the gaff until he was under studio lighting.  Which is sad because they should have studio lighting at makeup to check for this...
LoLeventVoDs,2tjhh4,Grumblecakes,2,Sun Jan 25 01:03:27 2015 UTC,I'm not able to watch today but its possible that it was a bet and not just a pre-show makeup flub.
LoLeventVoDs,2tjhh4,itrv1,2,Sat Jan 24 22:52:26 2015 UTC,A simple prank of changing the label with another could lead to color mishaps.
LoLeventVoDs,2tjhh4,ProjektTHOR,2,Mon Feb 23 03:15:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah, like every episode of Dexter. Its like the makeup team forgot about that part of their face."

LoLeventVoDs,2tjhh4,Sweetune,2,Sun Jan 25 10:07:33 2015 UTC,I think it was done fine. I didn't even noticed till I read this comment.

Look at it like this, if you're looking for a week, you simply have to scroll from newest to oldest and if you want to watch Week 2, you just scroll all the way down and start watching from Day 1. Nobody starts watching entire week of LCS from Day 2, so it makes sense to have first day at first place, rather than second as some would automatically click on first few links thinking those games were first.

LoLeventVoDs,2tjhh4,MrRoyce,1 point,Tue Feb 24 03:11:51 2015 UTC,"Sadly, there's nothing much we can do about it. Poll title is ""Vote for BEST..."" and not ""Vote for your favorite team"" but you can see the outcome is always biased towards more popular teams. Even if for example CST vs T8 was the most exciting game ever played in LCS, TSM or C9 or CLG would get more votes regardless whether the games they played were shit or not.   We used to recommend games based on our personal preference, but people would always come up with some complaint so we just stopped doing that to save us the trouble and negative comments when all we tried to do was help those who don't have time to watch games. So now we have Strawpoll which is still not the best solution, however there's another alternative - if you go to /r/leagueoflegends you can see which LCS thread is highest and if you're lucky, you won't get spoiled by other stuff so based on post game discussion thread score you can figure out which game was worth watching (but this is also subject to fan voting..)."
LoLeventVoDs,2tjhh4,MockeKjellgran,2,Tue Feb 24 17:13:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm sorry I complained without offering any solutions. I understand there's not a whole lot you can do about it. It's a nice feature, either way. Just have to take the games of more popular teams with a grain of salt.  Thanks for all you do here!"
LoLeventVoDs,2tjhh4,MrRoyce,2,Tue Feb 24 21:40:07 2015 UTC,"Is there any one trusted person making recommendations after the initial broadcasts?  Not knocking strawpoll (well, not too much) it's something... just leans towards the popular teams more than usual lately."

LoLeventVoDs,2tjhh4,SpecterGT260,1 point,Sun Jan 25 22:00:55 2015 UTC,How long does it usually take for youtube to uploaded
LoLeventVoDs,2tjhh4,SpecterGT260,3,Mon Jan 26 00:08:47 2015 UTC,"Since we're doing full coverage, and that includes pre-game show and post-game interview/analysis, our VODs are a bit longer and take more time to process. Uploading part doesn't take more than 5-6 minutes, even for longest 1h+ VODs, but processing takes ages.   Under normal circumstances, you can expect YouTube VOD to be available about an hour after game ends. So let's say game starts at 10PM, VOD in non-HD quality should be available around 11PM. Processing to HD takes about 20-30 minutes, it really depends on length."

Right now, we don't plan to add it to thread itself but are rather looking at other ways how to incorporate them in our coverage, maybe post all discussion links below the thread in one comment and if it gets upvoted, everyone could see it. That's one of the possibilities, but we aren't able to include it in thread itself due to few limitations (number of characters and table width being too big on smaller screens for example)."

LoLeventVoDs,2tjhh4,Lord_Charles_I,1 point,Sun Feb 1 17:12:58 2015 UTC,"Hello.   We've tried the format you suggested and had people complain how they've seen games that happened after the ones from the day before because they automatically started watching that day from top to bottom, which makes the most sense in my opinion as well.   If you'd like to watch games from Day 4, you won't have to start from bottom, but rather from top and the only reason weeks are sorted from new to old (which is different compared to days) is because we don't want people to scroll down too far.  If we were to post them completely reverse chronologically, we would still have games sorted opposite of everything else and everything would be left and right. We're making sure each table is marked with proper title so people can realize what they're looking at and can also find stuff they want quicker, so I don't think format matters as much - it's something we talked A LOT about in 2014 and have actually changed it a few times since 2013 and this one seems to work for people the most.  /u/MrRoyce"

LoLeventVoDs,2taw1o,dyngnosis,6,Fri Jan 23 13:13:09 2015 UTC,I used this while traveling last summer and I found that it worked quite well.  My only complaint was that HTTP downloads wouldn't resume so if you are downloading in 720p and you've got the first 800mb  of a 1gb file and wifi drops you're screwed.  A torrent would allow for easy resume but may be subjected to torrent throttling in some regions.    I'm a big YES to torrents and could commit to seeding quite a bit.
LoLeventVoDs,2taw1o,PastaChieftan,2,Fri Jan 23 19:39:58 2015 UTC,I can seed pretty much around the clock. Got like 350Mbit/s down along with 200Mbit/s up.

We also have 10TB traffic, so that's should be more than enough to download 80 LCS games/month. Only thing to note is that we don't keep VODs on server for more than 24 hours, although we can make exceptions for Sunday and keep 'em available for another day or two.  It's definitely something to look into, considering so many people can't watch Twitch/YouTube VODs!"

LoLeventVoDs,2taw1o,Muscratt,3,Thu Jan 22 23:10:04 2015 UTC,I would be another who would appreciate an audio-only stream.
LoLeventVoDs,2taw1o,Lyghtsaber,3,Fri Jan 23 16:50:25 2015 UTC,Upvote and a yes to torrents. It's awesome to have top games downloaded for easy ability to rewatch and keep down internet usage.    I usually go over gb cap with family usage and my constant gaming and stream watching.
LoLeventVoDs,2taw1o,cnewz,2,Sat Jan 24 05:24:29 2015 UTC,Would love both!
LoLeventVoDs,2taw1o,LoLstatsGG,2,Thu Jan 22 19:25:22 2015 UTC,torrents would be pretty cool. I've looked into it before because of people in China that can't really watch many or any of the videos

LoLeventVoDs,2taw1o,dyfrgi,1 point,Fri Jan 23 13:26:25 2015 UTC,"Hey. If we make table any bigger, viewers with lower resolution/screen size will have issues and won't be able to see that. For example, something I checked at work today is that current table fits perfectly on 17"" and if there was another column, it wouldn't be possible to click on any links in it.  There's also bigger issue, and that's reddit limit of 40k characters per thread. We already have to split it on 2 parts every split and if we added another column, we'd risk possibility of having to create a 3rd part, and that would be just awful.  Sorry, we don't have a proper solution for that right now! :| I have something on my mind though, will see if it's doable.  /u/MrRoyce"

Is there a reasoning mixing up your format in (for example) the Champions Korea Spring thread? I mean you do oldest week at the bottom, but then go by oldest first per week. Is this just to avoid spoilers in the vods about an earlier day/game? I just tend to find the current formatting of that a bit confusing, though certainly not critical.  I feel it'd be easier to ""move upwards"" on the thread as I'm watching the vods, as opposed to going downwards to watch weeks 2, go back up for week 3, go down, back up to week 4, go down, etc.  Edit: Or going straight down the page, as would be the case here. Primarily I mean is there a reason for mixing the paths, it is disconcerting in my opinion to go up and down the page as opposed to just going down (or up)"

LoLeventVoDs,2s0vyl,dely5id,24,Sun Jan 11 03:58:32 2015 UTC,"I expect either Pobelter or XiaoWeiXiao. They know how to play mid lane very well and if they lose, that would be a major upset in my opinion."
LoLeventVoDs,2s0vyl,Saad888,2,Sun Jan 11 04:01:02 2015 UTC,"I woudn't say knowing how to mid would be as big of a factor here, playing mid lane involves more focus on map awarneess, team and enemy movements, lane and map pressure, and so on. I'd say it's a lot more to do with mechanics and creep wave knowledge than anything else.   In which case Pobelter and XWX are still the most likely ones to win since they have competitive experience and have practiced in traditionally more ""hard core"" reigons"

LoLeventVoDs,2s0vyl,Skulled13,2,Mon Jan 12 17:24:46 2015 UTC,"Hai too, but bjergsen is a really really good zed player, hes known for it"
LoLeventVoDs,2s0vyl,defsubs,7,Mon Jan 12 17:46:43 2015 UTC,Zed is arguably Hai's best champ..
LoLeventVoDs,2s0vyl,gayd3n,2,Mon Jan 12 18:02:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah but he has a champion pool or like, 4 champs."
LoLeventVoDs,2s0vyl,defsubs,2,Mon Jan 12 22:53:03 2015 UTC,Funny you say that because this shows Hai played 23 champions last season with positive KDA's on all but 2.
LoLeventVoDs,2s0vyl,xomega77,5,Mon Jan 12 23:34:41 2015 UTC,"saying Hai have positive KDA on champs is an invalid argument because hes part of C9 and theyve been winnning as a team and not just based off of Hai's plays.. so as long as his team does well, he can easily get positive scores. just like how ppl in solo q lose lane and go 0-4 and then end up like 10-5.. yea cuz their team wins lanes and carries and allows u to catch back up. that being said. im not doubting his skill or his champ pool but just saying ur argument is invalid"
LoLeventVoDs,2s0vyl,gayd3n,2,Tue Jan 13 02:41:08 2015 UTC,There's no need to use such language here. You can make your statement in a polite way as well.
LoLeventVoDs,2s0vyl,defsubs,-4,Wed Jan 21 21:52:49 2015 UTC,"I can play every champ in the game and get a positive KDA on most, doesn't change how big my champion pool is."
LoLeventVoDs,2s0vyl,gayd3n,3,Wed Jan 21 22:12:25 2015 UTC,You can't even begin to compare yourself to an LCS pro. Going positive in yolo queue isn't the same as going positive on the main stage. You likely aren't good enough to play 23 different champs and that level either.
LoLeventVoDs,2s0vyl,Whober,-1,Mon Jan 12 23:37:55 2015 UTC,"I am aware it's not the same, and of course I'm not good enough, I'm a low elo scrub. I'm just saying, it's a popular opinion that Hai is extremely good with a few champs (Zed, Orianna) and good but not great (at an LCS level) with the rest"
LoLeventVoDs,2s0vyl,sicaxav,1 point,Tue Jan 13 00:07:25 2015 UTC,"Well if he ever draws target bans with those champions its a bonus for his team and if he doesn't he gets to play his strongest champion. C9 as a team is so strong that even if you aim to shut down one player everyone else will more than make up for it. You can't target ban anybody on their team, especially not Hai. Being able to go even or win lane on champions you don't practice as much as Ori or Zed is really good."

LoLeventVoDs,2rqvjl,MikuMillian,3,Thu Jan 8 20:47:28 2015 UTC,The first day's games have already been conducted. How long until VoDs are posted?  Update: thanks op! jaja
LoLeventVoDs,2rqvjl,Treesrule,1 point,Thu Jan 8 20:00:33 2015 UTC,I'm also wondering; very excited to watch LMS but the times are difficult for live viewing.

LoLeventVoDs,2rqvjl,KyojinJaeger,2,Fri Jan 9 00:40:52 2015 UTC,Who do you see as favorites for this split? TPA or aHq im guessing?
LoLeventVoDs,2rqvjl,Christoph_Blocher,2,Thu Jan 8 16:37:27 2015 UTC,I would wait until the end of week one a lot of these teams have new rosters.
LoLeventVoDs,2rqvjl,marjamrob,1 point,Thu Jan 8 19:14:49 2015 UTC,"My personal picks are TPA,aHq, and HKE."
LoLeventVoDs,2rqvjl,Zargone,2,Mon Jan 12 03:55:41 2015 UTC,"AHQ vs MC and  LogS vs MC english VODs are reversed, the youtube video titles are incorrectly titled if you watch the teams that are actually involved"

LoLeventVoDs,2psl4t,LoLeventVoDs,13,Fri Dec 19 15:26:42 2014 UTC,"""Participants"" should list CLG and Gambit?"
LoLeventVoDs,2psl4t,toasted_nori_mufucka,5,Fri Dec 19 20:53:40 2014 UTC,Any Idea why CLG and Gambit got byes?
LoLeventVoDs,2psl4t,blckmatt,10,Sat Dec 20 02:53:23 2014 UTC,They were first place in the fan vote

LoLeventVoDs,2psl4t,HeyItsChase,25,Sat Dec 20 02:50:54 2014 UTC,Saint turned out to be an amazing caster
LoLeventVoDs,2psl4t,toasted_nori_mufucka,14,Sat Dec 20 07:43:51 2014 UTC,"Yup. Enjoying the hell out of his commentary. He's cocky, funny, and knows how to make a point and shut up (compared to most casters)."
LoLeventVoDs,2psl4t,StanStrangleson,6,Sat Dec 20 13:35:12 2014 UTC,Too bad he won't be doing it for a while after this :/
LoLeventVoDs,2psl4t,Stealthstriker,4,Sat Dec 20 20:44:22 2014 UTC,Why would he not be doing it for awhile after this?
LoLeventVoDs,2psl4t,alienwolf,7,Sun Dec 21 05:01:37 2014 UTC,I'm guessing because he got into LCS again.
LoLeventVoDs,2psl4t,Stealthstriker,6,Sun Dec 21 06:07:45 2014 UTC,"yea, i just remembered, Curse Academy qualified for NA LCS...  Well, when he retires as a player I'm sure he would be able to cast again..."
LoLeventVoDs,2psl4t,andKento,4,Sun Dec 21 07:37:44 2014 UTC,he stated he don't want to shout cast full time cause he'd run out of things to say or something
LoLeventVoDs,2psl4t,fredoindacut,4,Mon Dec 22 00:07:26 2014 UTC,that's kind of a silly reason.
LoLeventVoDs,2psl4t,andKento,5,Mon Dec 22 01:15:55 2014 UTC,"oh i agree, he might change his mind when his career as a player comes to an end though, you never know"
LoLeventVoDs,2psl4t,StanStrangleson,3,Mon Dec 22 04:10:37 2014 UTC,Because he'll be playing in the LCS.  Tough to cast and play.
LoLeventVoDs,2psl4t,Stealthstriker,5,Sun Dec 21 16:03:28 2014 UTC,"I think it would be hilarious... ""I'm going in for the kill! Can I get it? Yes I do!"""
LoLeventVoDs,2psl4t,Wispborne,3,Sun Dec 21 18:19:06 2014 UTC,In case you haven't seen one of the most incredible LoL videos out there.
LoLeventVoDs,2psl4t,lol_gog,-15,Tue Dec 23 15:08:31 2014 UTC,"What? You for real? His hubris makes me want to punch him in his fucking face. He's one of the worse pro junglers in NA yet he's trying to correct Crumbz' choice in ganks.  He's been a ""pro"" since the beginning and he still can't fucking smite. THEY HAVE THEIR HEALTH BARS ABOVE THEM YOU ASSHOLE STOP LOSING OBJECTIVES TO THE ENEMY MID LANER.   I'm a little butthurt as a curse fan."
LoLeventVoDs,2psl4t,larkhills,6,Sat Dec 20 10:06:07 2014 UTC,"Ok you seem a bit more than a little butthurt...  Every jungler misses smite sometimes.  It's not just him... He's also a fairly good jungler.  If he wasn't,  his team wouldn't be this far... If he wasn't as good a jungler,  he'd still be in the challenger series and lower tourneys struggling to make it"
LoLeventVoDs,2psl4t,SmexyPro,1 point,Sat Dec 20 13:09:25 2014 UTC,"Every jungler misses it sometimes, but when challenged he misses it way more often than other junglers. There was even a site telling you when the last time he missed smite was."
LoLeventVoDs,2psl4t,MrRoyce,2,Sat Dec 20 18:20:49 2014 UTC,I believe you mean this one: http://www.whendidsaintlastmisssmite.com/
LoLeventVoDs,2psl4t,toasted_nori_mufucka,5,Sat Dec 20 18:28:16 2014 UTC,"His ability to play isn't relevant to this. Honestly, I think the man is a natural. He times his commentary very well, no awkwardness, he's funny with the right amount of cocky (not arrogant, definitely doesn't suck up to the players either). Even just his tone feels right. And you can see that the other casters enjoy working with him, at least deman seems to be having a blast. Don't discard him because you're mad at his smites."
LoLeventVoDs,2psl4t,I-Am-Dickish,2,Sat Dec 20 17:03:56 2014 UTC,Yeah that sucks. I can see how he might seem smug if you had personal beef with him.
LoLeventVoDs,2psl4t,SpecterGT260,1 point,Sat Dec 20 13:36:18 2014 UTC,"I've been a saint fan since season two, but I can see why people would dislike him. The casual dick aura can piss people off.   As for missing smite, the changing health bar design probably plays a huge role. He used to be a god mode smiter (like me) because the jungle health bars didn't change significantly till season three. I'm talking about since beta. I've had trouble adjusting, and there is no real way to practice smite steals."
LoLeventVoDs,2psl4t,Neversetinstone,6,Thu Jan 1 08:05:21 2015 UTC,Video's set to private on youtube?

LoLeventVoDs,2psl4t,larkhills,3,Fri Dec 19 18:24:19 2014 UTC,"I hit the wrong button twice. My bad. Fixed, and links are back as well.   Sorry all."
LoLeventVoDs,2psl4t,Lord_Charles_I,2,Fri Dec 19 18:35:56 2014 UTC,"You mean 3 times..... Potentially... spoliers, etc... pls."
LoLeventVoDs,2psl4t,ThisIsHowWeDo,14,Sat Dec 20 03:20:21 2014 UTC,"Is Sjokz supposed to be saying something at the desk? Either she's just there to provide the segues between champ select and in-game, or Dexter and Deficio are straight-up talking over her. Bless her heart for trying but the guys don't seem like they're giving her space to talk."
LoLeventVoDs,2psl4t,xa3D,13,Sat Dec 20 02:18:07 2014 UTC,"She's essentially a host there on an as needed basis for questions/transitions. Sometimes,  things go well between the analysts and she isn't needed.  Krepo, dexter, and deficit are likely meshing so well that she isn't needed much.  If they're ever off topic or taking too long,  she'll step in"
LoLeventVoDs,2psl4t,toasted_nori_mufucka,2,Sat Dec 20 13:03:08 2014 UTC,deficit   Cracked me up :D
LoLeventVoDs,2psl4t,Dennis_Langley,6,Mon Dec 22 20:23:53 2014 UTC,"Wow, first of all I'm amazed nobody else has mentioned this yet. Secondly, yeah, I got the impression that it was more so they weren't giving her much of a chance to say anything. They never gave her an opportunity to speak, instead talking directly to each other the entire time, and almost every time Sjokz finally did try to get a word in one of the other two would start talking over her. Very unprofessionally done IMO. She's sitting there at the desk with you guys, as an equal, give her a fucking chance to say something instead of ignoring her existence just because she's new to the desk. Made me feel bad for her."
LoLeventVoDs,2psl4t,ElliotNess,9,Sat Dec 20 05:59:08 2014 UTC,"It's her 1st time taking on a desk role such as this. She'll grow into it. For comparison's sake, Riv3 would take control of the conversation as a mediator, but she lets them talk; which kind of shows how nervous she is. Hopefully she'll get better during LCS. She's essentially what quickshot and riv do at the analyst desk. Mediate the discussions, bring out points to talk about, etc., she does neither (yet)."
LoLeventVoDs,2psl4t,asuth,4,Sat Dec 20 11:13:00 2014 UTC,"Agreed. It takes confidence to run a panel featuring two or more passionate, opinionated, sometimes long-winded casters. Sjokz is being polite at this point. I'm sure we'll see her develop into a more self-assured mediator/leader soon enough."
LoLeventVoDs,2psl4t,dexterdoge,2,Sat Dec 20 13:33:58 2014 UTC,"It seemed like several times she started to say something, got maybe a few syllables out, before she was talked over. It didn't seem quite as bad in the first series, so maybe it's mostly Deficio, but it seemed pretty apparent she wasn't getting to talk when she wanted to."
LoLeventVoDs,2psl4t,asuth,3,Sat Dec 20 14:19:36 2014 UTC,Deficio certainly does like to talk.
LoLeventVoDs,2psl4t,Cetaphobian,4,Sun Dec 21 04:59:29 2014 UTC,Just out of curiosity how are teams selected for this?  Eg. how did CLG make it in over a much stronger NA team like C9?
LoLeventVoDs,2psl4t,asuth,5,Mon Dec 22 21:34:03 2014 UTC,"C9, TSM already participated on IEM San Jose so they can't be voted on IEM Cologne."
LoLeventVoDs,2psl4t,QQvsOO,3,Sat Dec 27 12:23:49 2014 UTC,ah that makes sense
LoLeventVoDs,2psl4t,QQvsOO,2,Sun Dec 28 19:19:51 2014 UTC,Teams are voted in by fans i believe.
LoLeventVoDs,2psl4t,Numite,3,Mon Dec 22 22:19:08 2014 UTC,"got it, thanks!"
LoLeventVoDs,2psl4t,Numite,3,Mon Dec 22 22:37:47 2014 UTC,Only A1 has highlights so far? I'm a bit lacking in the time department :(  Thanks for all the hard work!

LoLeventVoDs,2psl4t,iaresosorry,1 point,Sun Dec 21 22:15:45 2014 UTC,"Hi! Just wanted to make a comment in case anyone would see it before watching the VODs.   To get a ""vod"" of the twitch chat you can use the chrome/firefox/opera extension ""ReChat"": https://www.rechat.org/ It will show what the chat was like when the stream was live, so when a play happens you will see a reaction in the chat. It's no fun to have a tiny player just to be able to see the chat, so I managed to find a way to do that! First you need to download the Greasemonkey(firefox) or Tampermonkey(chrome) extension and then install the script from https://monkeyguts.com/code.php?id=288   You will then be able to get the player + chat covering the entire window :)! A spoiler-free example: http://img.ctrlv.in/img/14/12/22/5497799c1f0f4.png  Have fun!"

Using spoiler tags ([text here](/s ""hidden text here"")) are the best route and are respected by at least the mods I use.  I'm not sure why they are formatted differently to begin with."

Talking about other games, do you have any specific ones where you'd like to see such dedicated VODs subreddit? We have a 'sister' subreddit, created by us for Hearthstone: http://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstonevods/  And there's also SC2 subreddit, which is even older than LEV: http://www.reddit.com/r/SpoilerFreeSC  And as far as I know, CS:GO is getting one dedicated place for stuff like this as well (current sub is kind of..dead). There were other plans to create such subreddits for games like Strife or Heroes of the Storm, but we'll see what happens with that in 2015.   Your ideas (and from others as well) are very much welcome and whatever you have on your mind, you can write here or via mod mail.  Thank you again and have a happy Christmas yourself as well!"

Will try to give him some lovin ;)  Well in theory must watch games are known within the community so the top voted games can be shared. So all you need to do is aggregate them, but simple put it is an effort vs reward.  And i dont think the reward warrants the effort."
LoLeventVoDs,2pmcxk,IrateGod,1 point,Thu Dec 25 13:36:28 2014 UTC,"I would LOVE if someone would do for Magic the Gathering what you guys do for LoL.  take the grand prix, pro tour, (and maybe the SCG series events), make each event its own thread, link to the start of each game and also link to any produced video segments aired in between rounds.   Whenever LCS is on break I go try to check in on the MtG tournament scene but LoLVoDs has me so spoiled that I find the M:tG events unwatchable.   I have tried to suggest over at mtgsalvation that they copy what you guys are doing here just to get back a ""nah too much work"" or ""go do it yourself"" response. If it was 10 years ago and I was not married with kids I would LOVE to watch these events live and note the timestamps to make such a useful and appreciated threads but sadly I cannot be that person right now."

When I pointed out they had successfully billed my account for my OGN subscription literally a few days before, they went ""no, it was definitely billing fraud"" even though I showed them the PayPal receipt that showed they had been paid.

LoLeventVoDs,2o5nhu,conatus_or_coitus,1 point,Fri Dec 5 04:32:14 2014 UTC,The method doesn't work anymore... it was by directly accessing the file link on twitch servers. But now you can't get there just from the VOD link.
LoLeventVoDs,2o5nhu,Ewannnn,1 point,Thu Dec 4 11:40:20 2014 UTC,... Can you not just download them how you would download any other video on the internet? With an extension? They weren't just broadcasted on Twitch iirc.
LoLeventVoDs,2o5nhu,Gygun,2,Sat Dec 6 00:14:34 2014 UTC,Twitch cuts their vods in 30 min parts and stores them in differents servers. We can't locate them without their api.
LoLeventVoDs,2o5nhu,Ewannnn,2,Sat Dec 6 02:22:34 2014 UTC,Wasn't it broadcast on Dailymotion as well? How about using a program to record what is on your screen itself?

LoLeventVoDs,2o5nhu,MHG_Brixby,2,Wed Dec 3 15:36:19 2014 UTC,"While I understand, I'm fine with directly supporting the fantastic quality of ogn games. It's a nominal fee, especially compared to something like nfl Sunday ticket."
LoLeventVoDs,2o5nhu,LaNCL,18,Wed Dec 3 16:53:10 2014 UTC,not everyone can afford 8 dollars in twitch.... like me
LoLeventVoDs,2o5nhu,MHG_Brixby,3,Wed Dec 3 17:06:59 2014 UTC,And what incentive to you propose this business give people who do sub
LoLeventVoDs,2o5nhu,MrRoyce,4,Wed Dec 3 17:29:13 2014 UTC,"They could keep livestream @ 480p for non-subscribers and add VODs available in 480p to that.  And those who can afford/really want HD quality could become subs. Watching VODs at 480p gets boring rather quickly from my experience.  There's also another alternative, not sure how legal with Twitch' ToS that is though. One subscription for several people, shared login details.   Or maybe we should, instead of €10 RP cards giveaways throw in a month worth of OGN subscription based on winners preference (whether it's during qualifiers, preseason, playoffs etc). What do people think about that?"
LoLeventVoDs,2o5nhu,LaNCL,4,Thu Dec 4 21:33:47 2014 UTC,hd and ad free like you are already getting ? i dont mind a free 240p vod

LoLeventVoDs,2o5nhu,CountyKyndrid,5,Wed Dec 3 18:04:41 2014 UTC,"Well when Twitch has so many problems with ISPs like mine where I can't even watch past medium anyway.  (I get 2MB/s down and can watch azubu/afreeca on HD, it's purely a twitch problem and they are aware that it is pretty common)  So awesome that everyone only uses twitch right."

We're currently understaffed and are in process of preparing several changes for 2015, including recruiting additional help, especially for non-LCS tournaments. It's worth noting over the past two years we've had many people who would help out for a short period of time, but only a few would stick around without leaving, which is perfectly understandable, but is also one of our main issues as community ran project. Changes we're considering for 2015 should help us address this issue.  To anyone who's reading this, if you're interested to be a part of our team in 2015, please drop me a PM so we can talk about it. We're introducing a new rewards system soon to have everyone who's involved properly, rewarded on monthly/bi-monthly basis, so basically, you won't just volunteer, but will also get something back for all your contribution and efforts.  I apologize for the lack of coverage for certain tournaments, but we should be able to get back in the game when new season officially starts, if not sooner!"

LoLeventVoDs,2i65xn,zaerys,6,Sat Oct 4 05:57:09 2014 UTC,May I make a suggestion when creating these uploads? Since the twitch vods and youtube vods are not uploaded as singular games would it be possible to have a default time that every vod is set to so we won't know if it's a 3-0 or a 3-2 ahead of time?  Totalbiscuit does this for his starcraft uploads and it is amazing.

The youtube suggestions spoil the series because they sometimes show game 4 and 5  (meaning not a sweep) or they don't show up (its gonna be a sweep)

We didn't really work this one through, as Murrayz rushed those things a bit.  Sorry for inconvenience, we'll pay more attention for future videos. But there's no reason to swear."

LoLeventVoDs,2i65xn,SenorFedora,1 point,Sat Oct 4 00:33:58 2014 UTC,And the highlights T.T
LoLeventVoDs,2i65xn,Murrayz,1 point,Sat Oct 4 20:54:35 2014 UTC,"It's rather simple how and why. I'll try to explain!  Despite the fact we have about 12 experienced volunteers, there are only a few people involved with this years Worlds. Normally it was my job to fill in whatever was missing, but as I got caught up with other stuff RL, the main person in charge of coverage would normally go to sleep right after final game was uploaded and would update missing stuff the next day when he'd start coverage for new round of games.   Although I understand this is not acceptable for most, since one of the major advantages of /r/LoLeventVODs, other than spoiler-free environment is also speed of updates. However,  we have different priorities when it comes to which links are added first and ASAP: 1. Twitch, YouTube, Discussion threads, Highlights, Strawpoll, full length Twitch/YouTube. So basically, if there's nobody else to jump in at the end of the broadcast, certain things are left without proper update.   TL;DR Due to lack of activity of other volunteers, including myself, there are links missing left and right during this years Worlds coverage, but we've made sure that most important links (Twitch & YouTube VODs) are linked literally as soon as possible!"
LoLeventVoDs,2i65xn,LolEventModsAreDumb,0,Sun Oct 5 18:09:07 2014 UTC,"I think it would be beneficial to make all videos the same length (say 2hrs) by adding a varying amount of black silence to the end of every game. It is a form of spoiler to know how long a game is and I find myself subconsciously subtracting 10min from the video length of every game to sort of predetermine how long the game goes, despite not wanting to know."
LoLeventVoDs,2i65xn,MrRoyce,1 point,Sat Oct 11 16:44:04 2014 UTC,"If this is a big problem for you, you can always choose to watch the Full Stream on YouTube when it's done processing. Knowing the length of a video from the start is simply an inherent weakness in the VOD format.  /u/Rexozord"
LoLeventVoDs,2gquld,LoLeventVoDs,85,Thu Sep 18 08:40:33 2014 UTC,"Please keep any sort of discussion within the spoiler tags.

For everything else, such as feedback, suggestions or other constructive criticism, please reply to this comment, so we can keep everything in one place.  Spread the word about our subreddit and enjoy the Worlds with our VODs coverage!  P.S. At the end of the season, I'd just want to thank every single person involved with LEV throughout the past two years. From /u/silverdevilboy who created this subreddit to every single volunteer who participated in updating at least couple of times, especially the ones who are still with us and are active on daily/weekly basis. And another big thank you to everyone who used our subreddit as their source for VODs at some point over the past two years. Expect some contests/giveaways during the Worlds as well!"
LoLeventVoDs,2gquld,AbuDhur,21,Thu Sep 18 08:49:36 2014 UTC,Just a reminder of somethink you probably already thougth about:  Please include some links to possible tiebreaker matches at the last days of the respective groups - regardless wether they are necessary or not.   On a related not: What is the maximum number of tiebreakers possible? Not sure how they would handle a completely tied group. Would not put it past Group B ...
LoLeventVoDs,2gquld,MrRoyce,15,Thu Sep 18 10:06:29 2014 UTC,"Hey, thank you for the input. We'll throw in the tie-breaker regardless whether there'll be any or not, just like you suggested! It won't look nice, with all the spoilers and stuff, but at least nobody will get spoiled and it worked pretty well last time around.  And that's the tricky part, we'll try to include rows for as many ties as it would be possible in theory, gotta wait a bit to see how it will look like. I honestly don't know how many there can be, but we'll figure it out."
LoLeventVoDs,2gquld,pargmegarg,7,Thu Sep 18 10:36:55 2014 UTC,"On a related note, have you ever considered disabling comments on the youtube VoDs?  Those can sometimes contain spoilers as well and don't really offer much in the way of discussion."
LoLeventVoDs,2gquld,MrRoyce,7,Fri Sep 19 05:01:32 2014 UTC,All YouTube comments are manually approved. We normally don't approve any spoiler-ish comments until 24-48h passed since game was uploaded (there was a mistake where one uploader approved some comments which he shouldn't have).

LoLeventVoDs,2gquld,uberlordpi,1 point,Sun Sep 21 18:11:57 2014 UTC,"But I feel like adding them day of would prove the fact that the tie breaker exists, causing spoilers. If you have them from the beginning of the event it might be more beneficial, idk. :)"
LoLeventVoDs,2gquld,MrRoyce,1 point,Mon Sep 22 05:36:18 2014 UTC,"I understand your concern. But we don't do that, we don't add tables for stuff that aren't scheduled or supposed to happen that day. Therefore, nobody can get spoiled because tie-breaker table would appear regardless whether there are games or not (obviously, those who are new to LEV don`t know that, which is a problem). It worked fine in the past two years, I honestly don't see a reason we need to change it and make 1. thread more messy and 2. break phone apps temporarily because we threw in a random table that will happen at some point during the tournament :/"

There has always been one thing that floats on my mind when I click on a link: the length of the video.  Would there be any way to artificially standardize the length of the VODs (perhaps adding enough black screen after the end of the video such that every video is 2 hours) so that you cannot know hold long a match is if you accidentally see the length of the video.

With Stawpoll trolls vote for games that don't weren't played and skew the results. Putting the Recommended games in spoiler tags would offset this."

I'm aware that this could be solved by setting overflow: auto, but then there's a high likelihood that a lot of posts, including this one, get horizontal scroll bars on tables which break up the flow of the posts - ideally, we'd like all links to be available to click on from the get go without having to scroll.  So, my hands are kind of tied here - unless you have a suggestion?"

LoLeventVoDs,2fxwkw,GingerWithFreckles,4,Fri Sep 12 11:51:38 2014 UTC,My best guess is they are new lcs contracted casters. This is the time of year riot drops or picks up new casters
LoLeventVoDs,2fxwkw,chainer3000,5,Tue Sep 9 22:29:07 2014 UTC,"That, or guest casters. I would personally doubt they would put 2 aussie casters on the NA LCS caster draft by contract."

Riot has been known to try out casters on the challenge scene before on boarding them to lcs though. I do think they must at least be candidates.

LoLeventVoDs,2fxwkw,Kijn,8,Tue Sep 9 23:55:59 2014 UTC,"They're the current casters for the OCE Scene. I imagine Riot is just giving them some more exposure, as from what I understand, OCE Leagues don't get much viewership."

LoLeventVoDs,2eqebe,HELP_ALLOWED,2,Tue Sep 30 07:39:52 2014 UTC,"Because the regional tournament is for third place, Only the 3rd to 6th placed teams play in this tournament. That's why second and third had to be decided first  The tournament is a single elimination style, starting with 5th place vs 6th, the winner of that plays 4th place, winner of that plays number three.  KT A was #4, they'll have to win two Bo5's. For the record, they are heavily favored to do so."
LoLeventVoDs,2eqebe,Echohawkdown,2,Tue Sep 30 07:51:52 2014 UTC,"For reference, this is how the circuit points stood going into the tournament (esportspedia link) - as you can see SG White and SKT T1 K are tied for second, hence the tiebreak.

LoLeventVoDs,2edy7a,IamCosmonaut,12,Sun Aug 24 00:37:36 2014 UTC,This is also the reason for the weird side distribution for CLG and Curse? Curse chose blue for game 1 and red for games 3 and 5 and CLG chose red for both 3 and 5?

LoLeventVoDs,2edy7a,IamCosmonaut,2,Sun Aug 24 20:40:34 2014 UTC,Interesting. Red side is being highly valued.
LoLeventVoDs,2edy7a,zloidooraque,5,Sun Aug 24 20:45:12 2014 UTC,Red side means last ban and 2 picks at once vs 1 pick but first.

I know these games are long over, but this right here is a spoiler of sorts, you are basically saying it went to five games, so if I am watching game 4 I know who will win, in fact if one team is up 2 games I know they will not win again until game five. Although after looking through the comments it seems like these types of ""spoilers"" are quite common in the comments here, I guess just don't read these comments if you don't want spoilers.

LoLeventVoDs,2edy7a,Sinkers91,2,Sat Aug 23 23:25:37 2014 UTC,Why are Sona and Gnar disabled?
LoLeventVoDs,2edy7a,muckbeast,6,Mon Aug 25 02:48:35 2014 UTC,"Gnar is disabled because he's a brand new champion and they like to give the pros time to learn new champs and make sure they aren't crazy OP/bugged by testing them in live with millions of players or relearn champions that get a big overhaul (like when Nidalee was changed just recently). Sona was recently reworked to a pretty decent degree which might be reason enough to disable her, but a quick search shows her W seems to be a bit bugged at the moment as well."
LoLeventVoDs,2edy7a,Zargone,3,Mon Aug 25 04:56:48 2014 UTC,"For Sona, it's the rework. Riot typically doesn't allow recently reworked champions to see competitively play for at least 4 weeks to ensure that there are no bugs/balance issues to that champion on live.  That W issue has been around for ages, but so far hasn't led to her being disabled.  Otherwise, you're spot on about everything else."
LoLeventVoDs,2edy7a,Blarlack,2,Mon Aug 25 08:21:16 2014 UTC,"Not sure if it's been mentioned before but there are slight spoilers in the way the videos are linked even with custom CSS on. The ""games"" linked with the address back to reddit for games that don't exist don't pop up with the ""Play"" button to the side of them. I've not watched CLG V Dig yet but I know it's only going to be four games   It's not that big a deal really, but thought someone should mention it. Thanks for all the work you folks do!  Edit: Screen Cap for clarity.   Edit 2: For anyone else that may run into this.

LoLeventVoDs,2eczef,Hadarace,4,Mon Aug 25 15:19:20 2014 UTC,I cannot see any of the NA LCS playoffs either. I refresh it and nothing. I even tried re-downloading the app to no avail. Also the icon doesn't show up on my iPad like it does in the store. Instead of the L it just has a grid in front of a white background with three circles and an x through them. The re-download did not fix that either.

LoLeventVoDs,2eczef,Tsupaero,3,Mon Aug 25 08:22:14 2014 UTC,Why only iOS 7.0 ?!  Fancy looks/ feautures arent that Important in such an app... My iPad 1 gets more useless everyday :'(
LoLeventVoDs,2eczef,Blazini,12,Sat Aug 23 12:22:49 2014 UTC,"Because it's exceptionally more effort to support iOS6 as well. Many things in terms of aligns, controls and overall functionality needs manual development and the amount of iOS6 devices is only around 6% from what I know, which include iPods, iPads1 and iPhones 3. iPads1 generally struggle with today's video decoding so there might be alot of testing and bugfixing involved. Saying so, some developers don't even own an iOS6 device plus the iOS simulator (the heart of your dev-tools in first place) doesn't support iOS6 any longer after you upgraded to the latest libraries, etc. - it's a pity, but that's how technology devolves over time and yes, your iPad1 becomes more useless every day. With iOS8 shipping soon, iOS6 support is completely cancelled and you won't be able to even update current apps any longer.  My tip: Jailbreak and get iOS7, it's fairly stable, yet a little slow, but doesn't completely put you off."
LoLeventVoDs,2eczef,Always_Has_A_Boner,3,Sat Aug 23 12:54:54 2014 UTC,"with your insightful explanation i fully understand now the reasons behind not support iOS <7, so thanks for your detailed answer. :) never hooked me up with some jailbreak infos but since my ensuring period is over i guess ill gibe it a try, thanks for the advice."
LoLeventVoDs,2eczef,Glitch_Zero,6,Sat Aug 23 15:13:36 2014 UTC,"Hey, seems like you have some concern about jail breaking! I'm a seasoned jail breaker, I've broken every iOS device I've had since greenpoison came out for iOS 4.2.1. I just wanted to tell you a few things about it:  Jail breaking is not illegal. There is no law against it, and you legally own the device and can do whatever you wish to it.   Jail breaking, done properly, will not void your warranty. Always back up your data to both iTunes and iCloud before doing anything that alters the data on your device. In the event of something going wrong,  simply restore the device using iTunes and restore your data from your backup. A device restore will remove any evidence of a jailbreak from your device.   Finally, a jailbreak does not actually do very much. The main function of a jailbreak is to grant you access to Cydia. Think of Cydia as your jailbreak's new App Store. The packages included in Cydia do things not approved for use in the official App Store. In many cases, a reject from the App Store has actually gone straight to Cydia! As always, be careful with the software you install and do your research!  Hope this helps with your decision to jailbreak, and PM me with any questions you have!"
LoLeventVoDs,2eczef,micronas,1 point,Sat Aug 23 20:18:15 2014 UTC,"No reason not to trust a man who always has a boner. (that's very impressive by the way.)  My only advice to /u/Blazini is if you do jailbreak, do it more for the OS upgrade and utilities than shitty themes and icon skins and stuff. If your device isn't specced for iOS 7 (it isn't) it's already going to run a bit slower - there's no need to completely bog it down, and a lot of the themes and stuff are slow fluff."

On my mobile phone as well as my iPad, the layout of loleventvods links doesn't really work out well. The tables are cut off and I can't get access to the English casted YouTube version of OGN for example. Downloaded the app and figured it would be available there. No dice.   So, two things. Where I don't mind the resolution on the iPad because I know it was meant for mobile, I at least which English casted versions were available. Second thing is I wouldn't be in this spot to begin with if I could get access to those links via this subreddit :)"
LoLeventVoDs,2eczef,MaketheVids,2,Sat Aug 23 15:55:44 2014 UTC,"Hey, thank you for downloading our app. Sorry for the delayed answer, I'm on vacation and don't have internet access 24/7. The purpose of the app is to make the subreddit easily usable and accessible on a mobile device, so what you pointed out is a very important point and we're going to look into it and implement those links aswell. But it will take some time since I'm on vacation for a week and after that I'm moving to another country. On top of that, Apple needs 1-2 weeks to approve a patch, so I can't say for certain when this feature will come, but it will. Thank you for your feedback."

LoLeventVoDs,2dfj51,Exiledbrowncoat,4,Thu Aug 14 18:13:25 2014 UTC,"No, if you look at the strawpoll before watching the games that says to me you do not care about the result of that set (thus negating the need for a spoiler) as you are only looking to watch the most entertaining games - /u/miicah"

Again, I have to point out that anyone clicking on the stawpoll is already saying they do not care about the results, thus negating the need for a spoilerfree environment. Also if I don't put game 4/5 in the strawpoll that's actually a bigger spoiler, because then you know 100% those games weren't played. /u/miicah"

And im not sure how exactly you guys determined that there would be insuffiecient interest from the viewers, i would imagine quite a lot of people wanting to watch at least NiP's games.  You sure it's not an ""insufficient interest"" of people watching these games and bother posting them? :P"
LoLeventVoDs,2cw5e9,Demtrollzz,7,Fri Aug 8 03:34:32 2014 UTC,"Dude it's 2014, you need to up your internet skills because there won't be people serving everything in a platter.  The same twitch vod that contains this game also has the challenger game of NiP. Either manually move forward half an hour after the first series finishes so the next one starts or even better use a program like jdownloader to extract the whole vod and watch it. It's literally 3 actions, download jdownloader, right click on the twitch vod link, download."
LoLeventVoDs,2cw5e9,dRgNbRn_,-11,Fri Aug 8 18:19:11 2014 UTC,"""Dude"", it IS 2014 and i do expect that i can watch some spoilerfree VoD's when i can not catch the games live.   I am not sure what you understand about ""spoilerfree"" but since twitch vods do NOT have an option to fast forward for like 10 seconds with the click of 1 key, you indeed do have to click on the timebar with your mouse.  This means you have to LOOK at the timebar. Now again, if you look at the timebar you see the length of the vod, which pretty much tells you how many games there have been, provided you visited elementary school at some point.   Still not sure if you see the problem with that, and i'm sorry if this post sounds condescending, but since you talked to me like an idiot when clearly not understanding the problematic nature yourself, i could not help it."
LoLeventVoDs,2cw5e9,Demtrollzz,1 point,Sat Aug 9 02:52:48 2014 UTC,"If you don't have a problem with the way you responded I don't either.  Sure watching on twitch you can get kinda spoiled by the time length but the same to an extent happens in youtube vods. For example 10minutes in a team is ahead by some margin and you see there is 15min left in the game. 95% of the time the team ahead will win.  Personally I download the vod, it's like 15-20 parts. I put the first on on Potplayer and then fast forward as I wish, it loads the next part autmatically so I get ""lost"" that way.  Suit yourself."
LoLeventVoDs,2cw5e9,dRgNbRn_,-3,Sat Aug 9 07:21:31 2014 UTC,"When i watch on youtube, i cover the timebar with my arm and fullscreen it only watching at the ""fullscreen"" sign without seeing the timebar or the actual video length display (sounds nerdy? well guess what, i AM a nerd :P).  Basically i figured out how to watch vods FULLY spoilerfree, granted the start of the game is linked somewhere.  I do the same on twitch, but twitch does not have the very comfortable ""fast forward"" feature that youtube has with pressing a single key without having to look at the timebar. This really sucks when google chrome decides to crash at 30 minutes of the game (WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS GOOGLE?).  BTW: With ""Youtube does not have  spoilerfree vods"" i obviously caused confusion.  It basically has the same level of ""being spoilerfree"" as twitch but the topic is about the mods of this subreddit not being willing to link/post those games. The answer from one of the mods was a link to the official riot youtube page where these games are uploaded. Now, i am very experienced with opening linked vods and blocking out my vision to not get spoilered, but actually having to manually search for a video on their youtube site is almost impossible to do without eating a spoiler.  As for your suggestion with downloading vods: Since these programs always download these streams in a particular manner (30 minutes per part for instance) it ALSO is not spoilerfree. Basically, if you know how long the stream was going, you get spoilered, especially in a Bo5 series, but even in a Bo1 (Is it a fast game or is it a long one? That IS a spoiler)."
LoLeventVoDs,2cw5e9,Demtrollzz,1 point,Sat Aug 9 07:55:21 2014 UTC,"Nerdy or not, many times it's the best way to not get spoiled and I've done it myself plenty of times. I'm a big fan of esports, I've watched events in like 10 different games and sadly there's been proper spoiler free VODs in like 1% of them.  Downloading the whole vod from twich in segments has a bit of spoiling but it's acceptable imo. For example the last LoL VOD i watched contained two bo5 series and it had like 20 30min segments. You can guess roughly how many games were played but there are so many possibilities like first one 5 games, second one 3 games, first one 4 long games, second one 4 fast ones, long pauses etc.   If you don't give it much thought soon after you start, with the way it loads automatically the net segment you lose track of time left.  I suggest you give it a go."
LoLeventVoDs,2cw5e9,dRgNbRn_,2,Sat Aug 9 10:59:35 2014 UTC,"You sure it's not an ""insufficient interest"" of people watching these games and bother posting them? :P   This is usually #1 reason why certain things aren't posted on this subreddit or updated on time. Most of us got real bored after months or even years of doing same thing week in and week out, so forgive us if we're not doing as good as we once used to - we still care about visitors and what they want to watch, so we'll revisit certain things for 2015, that's for sure.  But from my personal experience with EU CS, I can tell you that people have little to no interest for most of the games, except maybe semi-finals and finals. Not sure about NA CS, as I've never covered that, but I've covered one entire split of EU CS and it totally wasn't worth the effort, if I'm being really honest. Echohawkdown knows this as well, that's why he made a direct, clear answer @ that linked comment.  But like I said, there'll be certain changes in very near future by the looks of it, so I expect to see every more important game and tournament available to end-user at any given time. Right now, we gotta figure out what to do with Twitch as they seem to be screwing VODs community over with every new decision they make."

LoLeventVoDs,2cw5e9,SatansF4TE,1 point,Thu Aug 14 12:31:24 2014 UTC,"Hey guys. I absolutely love what you do here and your dedication to being spoiler free. With that I have a very minor change request. Many times I start watching the Vods while you are still posting them either because I'm at work or because I'm not awake when they first started the matches (EU mainly). When you are first posting the vods for Bof5's that are currently happening, I noticed today that they turn into hyperlinks AS they are happening while the games that haven't happened are still normal text. I know at the end you turn them all into links, to avoid spoilers, but because I was updating the page to get the next vods, I got a (small) spoiler just in the fact that the game 4 vod turned into a hyperlink while the game 5 one didn't. This immediately notified me that there would be at least a game 4 in the series because if it ended there, you would have replaced the text with links to avoid spoilers. My recommendation would be to maybe make them all hyperlinks addressed as ""#"" immediately when you post the Bo5 series and then change them to their vod links when they are available. Or maybe just redirect the user if the vod isn't available. Then there would be no visual spoilers for people that try watching them while you are still uploading them.  Again, very minor but I thought I'd at least let you know to be as spoiler free as possible. Let me know if there is anything confusing about what I mean. /u/miicah /u/colblitz just so you notice.  Thanks!"

Picks and bans for B6 and B7 are fine. Game start for B7 is fine. I see what happened. The stamp is out by exactly one hour on B6.

LoLeventVoDs,28l2r3,MrRoyce,1 point,Sat Jun 21 10:32:45 2014 UTC,Why nobody uploads the games on streaming sites like rutube or things like that ? They're known to host a lot of series and movie so it's easier to have videos that are infringing copyrights on thoses sites. That'd be great !
LoLeventVoDs,28l2r3,Yutsa,3,Sun Jun 22 06:16:14 2014 UTC,Most likely because they can't monetize them there as they can on YouTube.

LoLeventVoDs,28bncq,MrRoyce,2,Tue Jun 17 01:20:45 2014 UTC,"Hi, I was there live and I have never seen so many boring games in one day. Boring crowd as well. It's obvious that riot doesn't care about Dreamhack, since they have their own bigger tournaments elsewhere.  Even the Dota games were way funnier to watch (and I know nothing about Dota). The crowd was awesome, loud and excited since the Swedish team was playing and did well."
LoLeventVoDs,28bncq,Read--it,2,Tue Jun 17 13:59:24 2014 UTC,"Wow, while I was updating the table and going through Twitch VODs, I was just thinking how awful it might've been to actually be there - mainly because pauses between games were so bloody long! What were you doing while you were waiting for games to start? And on top of that, considering most games weren't interesting either... Did you have to pay for entrance?"
LoLeventVoDs,28bncq,LupusX,2,Tue Jun 17 14:28:56 2014 UTC,There is plenty of things to do at Dreamhack during pauses... And you pay an entrance fee to access everything.
LoLeventVoDs,28bncq,MrRoyce,2,Tue Jun 17 15:42:02 2014 UTC,"Man, dreamhack is huge. You pay for entering the whole dreamhack event (140 sek for one day ~$21, about the same as the cinema, so it's quite worth it). Between games you either watched Starcraft, Dota, Hearthstone, looking around on other stuff, and hanging out with friends. And you have to eat as well so the schedule was quite full.  So if you like more games than just LoL it's worth visiting the last day (the last day has all the finals and therefore the best games imo)."
LoLeventVoDs,28bncq,Gjetarguten,1 point,Tue Jun 17 15:49:52 2014 UTC,"I see. I guess coming to DH only for League would not make much sense, and I'm pretty sure most visitors are interested in more than just one game. And $21 is not that much either for a whole day. Are drinks and food expensive or normal prices?"

LoLeventVoDs,26bj3k,Whitsoxrule,2,Sun May 25 21:40:49 2014 UTC,It generally spoils the game though. I mean a top 3 team vs a bottom 3 team and it has 2000 upvotes... yeah the bottom 3 team won. I know for OGN threads on LoLeventVoDs they have a straw poll and recommended games to watch each week. Maybe one of the mods will incorporate this into NA & EU LCS threads!  Edit: Nvm I just figured out that this would cause the same spoiler problem. They do recommended games in best of 3s and 5s so there isnt a risk of spoiling series outcome.

LoLeventVoDs,26bj3k,Christoph_Blocher,3,Fri May 23 22:17:11 2014 UTC,"Just gonna copy paste what I wrote in another post:   We would love to [include the full stream link], but Google/YouTube keep fiddling around with the timestamps on the VODs (without input from Riot), making it impractical to provide same day coverage. One time, it was so bad that the entire first 50 min or so were cut, which ended up spoiling ALL the day's games. In fact, we'd probably only be able to provide timestamps a week after the original broadcast - when we know for certain that the timestamps wouldn't be shifted.  In summary, unless Google/YouTube fixes it, that column will remain missing from the table.   We did get a lot of feedback asking for the full stream link - even without timestamps - so we'll likely be adding it back in in the future. -/u/Echohawkdown"

LoLeventVoDs,26bj3k,0bran,1 point,Mon Jun 16 02:00:17 2014 UTC,"Riot is absolutely OK with people recording and uploading games, interviews, highlights etc. They are not very much into monetizing their own content and running ads, for them, it's about spreading the word about the game, reaching out to the audience, have a lot of YouTube League of Legends videos and so on.  I've explained multiple times why are we even doing this - it's not about the money at all, there are no mid-roll ads and some other stuff is disabled. Being able to add annotations for pauses, cut where we think is necessary, have faster and reliable uploads and a lot more. We're now saving pretty much all money videos make to get our own website (again, we will have only ONE ad on entire website, so it's not going to be like solomid.net where you have 48 ads that make a fortune) - we just want to move from reddit to someplace where we have full control of content and where we won't depend whether reddit randomly goes down or decides to enforce certain changes. We will continue to provide Riot VODs and as soon as YouTube full stream gets 100% fixed like it used to be, we will also provide that one as an alternative.  Just to clarify, we will not shut down this subreddit in order to run a website, but more about this in a few weeks. And just let me tell you this - there are several people who work every single week on getting proper links up (if you ever tried to find something on Twitch VOD, you know how painful it can be if you have to wait 3 minutes for something to load, lol) and having our own uploads means we can actually reward them as we plan to do this week (I'm  talking about small RP cards, like $10 - $25 ones).  Without these videos, it would also be very hard to get iOS app released, as we've just bought iOS developer license last week and should be releasing the app in a week or two - and that license costs $99/year. It's not like someone is becoming rich from this, these videos are genuinely making us improve things and keep subreddit running.   To others: please don't downvote him/her for asking a legit question, it's perfectly fine. We have absolutely nothing to hide and nobody has made any money from LEV so far in almost two years now (ok, I'm lying, I actually made $1 last month due to PayPal transfer for iOS app haha)."

The idea is for people who can't watch every match every week to have an easy outlet to catch up, summarizing the lead stories, standings and big matches of the week. I've already got one video up about the EU LCS Week 1 here and I plan on doing one each week for both the NA and EU LCS!   I hope you guys will check it out and watch.

One time, it was so bad that the entire first 50 min or so were cut, which ended up spoiling ALL the day's games. In fact, we'd probably only be able to provide timestamps a week after the original broadcast - when we know for certain that the timestamps wouldn't be shifted.  In summary, unless Google/YouTube fixes it, that column will remain missing from the table.   We did get a lot of feedback asking for the full stream link - even without timestamps - so we'll likely be adding it back in in the future. -/u/Echohawkdown"

LoLeventVoDs,261b2g,Hoodie_Patrol,1 point,Tue May 20 18:40:36 2014 UTC,"Ah, sadly I'm aware of the issues with Android app and it's a fault on our end - every thread needs to have appropriate flair to be properly shown in the app and guys aren't doing it in timely manner unless I mention it in Skype group. Although it sounds rather simple, it's a bit complicated to keep track of all events, what type of VODs are posted and their progress (e.g. how flair selection looks like at the moment: http://i.imgur.com/fUhZqAv.png).  I'll make sure to keep an eye on it so it's updated properly and posts continue to be compatible with Android app, I promise. There really should be no reason to not use Android app for VODs and these hiccups will be resolved shortly, thanks for bringing it up!  And I agree with you, but it's always nice to see some sort of discussion going here - wish spoiler tags were properly shown on phones and were turned on by default, but since that's not the case, we may have to introduce a policy about discussing games, unfortunately.  P.S. Don't worry about few downvotes, your feedback is appreciated and noted!"
LoLeventVoDs,261b2g,dyfrgi,0,Tue May 20 18:48:47 2014 UTC,Will the app have chromecast or appletv support?

I've checked with iOS developers and neither feature will be supported at start right away, but it will be added eventually with next patch(es).

LoLeventVoDs,261b2g,Flame_More,7,Thu May 22 16:14:33 2014 UTC,"There are multiple reasons why we do this, I'll try to write most of them to explain to you and anyone else who may be wondering.   Speed - This subreddit is mostly known for it's fairly quick updates, especially for LCS and Riot normally uploads VODs several hours (up to 6-7h) later which makes it pretty hard for us to update tables - for example, nobody is going to stay awake during the entire night just to wait for Riot to upload VODs. So yeah, our uploads are way quicker than Riot's and are 100% reliable. Full control - We have full control over the videos uploaded, which means we can extend their length (e.g. include post game interview, analysis etc) and we can also add annotations whenever there's a longer pause (like we've been doing in past), so people can skip right to game without having to randomly skip through the time hopefully they won't skip a kill or something. Comments need to be approved, timestamps for P&B/GS are also posted in video description and so on. Income - We have a group of ~10 volunteers who work around the clock to update threads for various tournaments and to keep them motivated and going, we need to reward them somehow. Generating certain amount of money from videos (we're talking about only couple hundred dollars on monthly basis) allows us to purchase RP cards for them or OGN subscriptions and such stuff. We also need money for other stuff and we're quite hesitant to ask for donations, so this is the best way to earn little extra (why do we need money? for example, just today I/we've paid $99 for iOS developer license which lasts one year and will need to be renewed in 365 days and also few days ago our monthly subscription for OGN was also extended and we're also looking into possibilities to start a website of our own where we wouldn't be limited by reddit.com in many many ways). Keep in mind uploader gets to keep certain amount of % (I would rather not disclose this amount to public, but whoever is involved with LEV knows how much it is), where rest is going into ""LEV foundation"". So other than uploader, there's literally nobody making money directly from this. We're also preparing a nice iOS app giveaway for next month, so if you are one of the iOS device users, you might get lucky! :)   So yeah, having our own VODs means we have almost quickest uploads on YouTube, reliability, full control over content, length AND comments (you may have noticed comments need to be approved before shown, it's done in order to prevent spoilers for first ~24 hours after video was uploaded) plus we can make some money for whatever we may need. On top of that, Riot is OK with it! We are not recording OGN and other events which count on the money their YouTube uploads make. Hope I was able to explain this properly and if you have any questions about it, don't hesitate to follow up on our conversation in public."

LoLeventVoDs,251td8,Amateramasu,3,Sat May 10 14:19:22 2014 UTC,it says on the bottom of the post link : https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kox.zzreal

LoLeventVoDs,251td8,SummonersPimp,5,Thu May 8 16:07:32 2014 UTC,B3 has audio sync issues on youtube.
LoLeventVoDs,251td8,connorworley,2,Fri May 9 20:42:17 2014 UTC,At what time? I've quickly checked through random times until 20th minute and everything seems fine on my end =|
LoLeventVoDs,251td8,MrRoyce,15,Fri May 9 20:48:15 2014 UTC,I can confirm that. A replacement is on its way.  I'm very sorry for the subpar time and quality of this VOD.  Edit: The replacement has been added.
LoLeventVoDs,251td8,Christoph_Blocher,4,Fri May 9 20:49:15 2014 UTC,Christ almighty you guys are professional.
LoLeventVoDs,251td8,SamWhite,0,Fri May 9 20:54:31 2014 UTC,I think it's pretty fair to have spoilers in the comments. It's not that hard to avoid them if you haven't watched the video yet.
LoLeventVoDs,251td8,jeffreyge1,5,Sun May 11 23:59:25 2014 UTC,"Repost since i was asked by mods to change my post; not sure if i was supposed to edit my original comment or submit another comment, although i'll assume that since my original post is not visible, i was meant to submit it again.   Here's highlights for Grand Finals for anyone that doesn't want to watch entire games.  Game 1 Highlights!  Game 2 Highlights!  Game 3 Highlights!  Game 4 Highlights!  Game 5 Highlights!"
LoLeventVoDs,251td8,LeagueOfVideo,7,Fri May 9 20:57:42 2014 UTC,What's wrong with Shen?  Why is he banned?
LoLeventVoDs,251td8,crispy_llama,21,Sat May 10 00:25:12 2014 UTC,"There is a bug with his ultimate occasionally cancelling the teleport. This bug was fixed in patch 4.7, but as the teams are still playing on 4.6 he'll remain banned.   /u/satansf4te"
LoLeventVoDs,251td8,crispy_llama,1 point,Mon May 12 06:04:49 2014 UTC,"Ah, ok.  Thanks."
LoLeventVoDs,251td8,MrRoyce,-10,Thu May 8 16:10:40 2014 UTC,I believe he is only banned in URF.
LoLeventVoDs,251td8,peacku,3,Thu May 8 16:19:25 2014 UTC,Don't think it's just in URF match. I think it has something to do with that annoying bug where you can accidentally cancel his ultimate if you spam E or something like that - which is supposed to be fixed with latest patch (4.7).
LoLeventVoDs,251td8,peacku,4,Thu May 8 19:02:19 2014 UTC,"I might be the only one interested, but is there VODs of the official (French) coverage, and if yes, could it be possible to also have them added here?  (I would understand if you think it is not relevant)"
LoLeventVoDs,251td8,Zaurk,5,Thu May 8 16:11:35 2014 UTC,"Not any sources that we know of, unfortunately.   /u/satansf4te"
LoLeventVoDs,251td8,peacku,2,Thu May 8 16:12:34 2014 UTC,Yeah i just checked their website and neither the Dailymotion stream and the OGaming stream have vods... at least for now. I will report back if they add it later :)
LoLeventVoDs,251td8,peacku,2,Thu May 8 16:40:53 2014 UTC,"They actually post the VODs of LoL here: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW_Yh4jkvUekgVxuGrrC9bw Edit: Oh, forgot to say, they usually takes time to upload it"

LoLeventVoDs,251td8,MrRoyce,3,Thu May 8 23:17:13 2014 UTC,"Not sure what is better, the crowd or this subreddit"
LoLeventVoDs,251td8,Demtrollzz,3,Fri May 9 10:35:03 2014 UTC,"Definitely the crowd/casters. Seriously, I feel like LCS needs hype casters/OGN buff girl equivalent; just hearing the crowd in the background of the broadcast made it 10 times better.  Wish they had something like that at S3 Worlds tbh; only game that was like that was NJBS vs SKT. -/u/Echohawkdown"

LoLeventVoDs,251td8,BobDylan530,5,Thu May 8 22:23:53 2014 UTC,"In most cases our YouTube mirror is uploaded right after the game ended and can be watched after YouTube processed it. Our team is pretty quick updating the thread most of the time, but if you want to be the first to see the game be sure to check out our YouTube channel."
LoLeventVoDs,251td8,DeathsDemise,2,Thu May 8 22:24:40 2014 UTC,Appreciated! Nice app btw.
LoLeventVoDs,251td8,Robek42,2,Thu May 8 22:57:31 2014 UTC,Why is Shen disabled?  Am I missing something?
LoLeventVoDs,251td8,Suuperdad,2,Thu May 8 16:12:23 2014 UTC,His ult is bugged. Sometimes he doesn't teleport to the designated target with it.

LoLeventVoDs,251td8,KainFromNod,2,Fri May 9 00:55:49 2014 UTC,Recommended Games: Why is A2 listed as a recommended game when A3 is clearly much more popular? Even A5 is more popular.

LoLeventVoDs,251td8,KainFromNod,1 point,Fri May 9 00:58:24 2014 UTC,"I honestly have no idea, but this is why we also have Strawpoll included, so people can vote for their best games and others can use that as secondary, often more reliable choice for recommended games!"
LoLeventVoDs,251td8,Alainyy,2,Fri May 9 01:15:01 2014 UTC,"Hey, great job so far!  And, if it's not too much trouble, can you also include the pre-game Analysis Desk as well? One of the things that I love about All Stars and Worlds the most is the Analysis Desk and their casual banter while getting some serious analysis going on."
LoLeventVoDs,251td8,wutudoing,1 point,Fri May 9 04:45:25 2014 UTC,If you click on Picks & Bans for Twitch just skip back 10 mins and you'll see all the commentary. There doesn't seem to be an option for YouTube unfortunately since they only upload the Picks/Bans and Game. The best way is go to Riots official YouTube channel and pull up the full stream. Just search through YouTube for the channel so you don't get spoiled by going to LoLEsports.com or through the official page.
LoLeventVoDs,251td8,midnightmealtime,1 point,Fri May 9 11:49:46 2014 UTC,"The best way is go to Riots official YouTube channel and pull up the full stream.   Yeah, but we didn't stop linking full stream for no reason. YouTube/Riot has some serious issues with YouTube stream VOD recently and timestamps keep messing up once livestream is past 3 hours and VOD is nowhere to be found later on.  I mean, just check Riot's YouTube from yesterday: https://www.youtube.com/user/LoLChampSeries/videos  No sign of 8 hour long VOD. This is why we are temporary not adding ""Full Stream"" stuff to our table since it was causing way more headache than good."
LoLeventVoDs,251td8,MrRoyce,1 point,Fri May 9 01:23:47 2014 UTC,"Yea, I realized that after seeing all the timestamp issues. I ran into them a few times (I prefer YouTube to Twitch) but the set up now is perfect. I can skip to whatever game I want and if I want to see the commentary I can just skip back/forward. :)"

LoLeventVoDs,251td8,DopeyAC130,2,Fri May 9 04:40:39 2014 UTC,"just my 2 cents i love wathcing pick & ban phase and normally theres a 2 minute wait form picks to game but this tourny has like 10 minute waits so i would suggest having a popup thats like ""go directly to game"" as i don't always have time to listen to the casters...   by popup i mean like the thing you have during pauses"
LoLeventVoDs,251td8,GuyWhosNotThatGuy,1 point,Fri May 9 15:42:43 2014 UTC,That's a good idea! I'll add it to our to-do list for upcoming tournaments where breaks between P&B and Game Start are as long as here.

LoLeventVoDs,251td8,LeagueOfVideo,2,Sat May 10 20:13:59 2014 UTC,The list of casters is inaccurate. There should be Deman instead of Riv I believe.

LoLeventVoDs,251td8,LeCasualGamer,1 point,Sun May 11 22:17:43 2014 UTC,"We use [text]( / spoiler ) without the spaces for spoilers, but since you're posting links you gotta do something so you don't spoil other people. The finals was Bo5, so posting 3 links shows other redditors that there were only 3 games (and not 5). Your post can be fixed by adding two fake links."

LoLeventVoDs,251td8,X0dium,2,Thu May 8 17:23:54 2014 UTC,"That was my bad today, I've let some comments through that I shouldn't have (I saw like 30+ new comments and just selected all and approved without reading as I was in a hurry, sorry!). I'll make sure that comments during the next 3 days are 100% spoiler-free so you have nothing to worry about. I will approve them 24-48 hours after game ended, which should give enough time to most people to check the video without getting spoiled by comments!"

LoLeventVoDs,251td8,MrRoyce,2,Fri May 9 00:19:27 2014 UTC,"Yep, I follow a lot of these pro players and teams on Facebook and I had to start hiding their posts from my feed. Got spoiled on 3 out of 5 games already. :("

Spoilers below for Day 2 games (no results revealed).  SHC v C9E - I personally found these games to be really boring and wouldn't really recommend any.  CW v DNL - The whole series is pretty decent, but as for specific games: C2 is a good watch, but I may be biased because they picked my favourite champ! The game itself is interesting.  A must watch - C4! It's a great game. If you watch only one, it should be this. It's action-packed and not a stomp, which marks a good game for me."

I just spoke to the submitter and apparently there was a broadcast bug (of some sort) that prevented the entirety of Game 3 from being streamed.  I can't verify this right now (since my internet connection is pretty crappy), but I only saw 3 videos from last night's match and the submitter probably assumed that those were games 1, 2, and 3 instead of games 1, 2, and 4. And to be fair, how can you tell which games are which when it's at the end of a VOD's name?  And just to clarify, I didn't remove your comment because it was criticism - it's a perfectly valid complaint which I just fixed - but because it does spoil the number of games (which, ironically, we just did =/ ). -/u/Echohawkdown"

I don't think it's HTML or coding issue but rather RES automatically adds an expandable box for any link that's a youtube video or an image file. Since ""lol.eventvods.com"" isn't a youtube link, RES doesn't add anything for that.  I think a quick fix might be to either link the unplayed games to the last actual game played or even a youtube video that just has text saying ""Anti-spoiler video"". But you know this much better than I do and if there's a coding solution to it that makes it easier, then by all means."

It doesn't help that Clam-, who would've been able to fill in the past, has been shadowbanned, and that our previous submitters for OGN, /u/tapemeasured and /u/jodycwilliams, were unable to provide coverage due to personal reasons. (Btw, please don't harrass these guys; they were excellent submitters who did this stuff because they wanted to.)  To answer your questions: coverage for the 3rd place match has been added, along with the relevant information (patches, recommended game, etc.), but the finals will not be played until Saturday, May 24th.

LoLeventVoDs,2343wt,knobbodi,1 point,Fri Apr 18 02:00:28 2014 UTC,"Always hit ""report"" if you think something is partially spoiler. Mods will get informed if comment gets two or more reports and can investigate further and ask people to put comment in spoiler tag :)"
LoLeventVoDs,2343wt,Echohawkdown,1 point,Fri Apr 18 03:13:18 2014 UTC,Could you please elaborate on the different color? A screenshot would help me much better than a description.

LoLeventVoDs,2343wt,cgmcnama,1 point,Fri Apr 18 03:19:35 2014 UTC,"This is odd, this shouldn't be happening! We have a CSS rule in place so placeholder links wouldn't show in any different color, regardless if you click on them or not. Could you please switch to light, standard mode and check if problem persists there as well?"
LoLeventVoDs,2343wt,frogbrooks,2,Fri Apr 18 10:54:18 2014 UTC,"Okay, so the problem is only in night mode for Reddit Enhancement Suite"
LoLeventVoDs,2343wt,MrRoyce,1 point,Fri Apr 18 18:43:44 2014 UTC,Well shit; I'll get right on it.
LoLeventVoDs,2343wt,frogbrooks,1 point,Sat Apr 19 05:18:13 2014 UTC,I believe I just fixed it; mind giving it another go and see if the problem still exists?
LoLeventVoDs,2343wt,frogbrooks,1 point,Sat Apr 19 06:08:21 2014 UTC,You got it. It's fixed.
LoLeventVoDs,22ulgy,SatansF4TE,2,Sat Apr 12 12:13:26 2014 UTC,When you open this thread all of the videos auto play and cause my computer to slow the hell down. You might want to fix this if anybody is going to watch these VODs
LoLeventVoDs,22ulgy,Hoodie_Patrol,1 point,Sun Apr 13 11:22:02 2014 UTC,"Unfortunately that's not something we can fix, it's a setting within RES. Here's how to disable it: http://www.reddit.com/r/Enhancement/comments/22uy8m/disabling_automatic_opening_of_images_and_playing/"
LoLeventVoDs,22ulgy,Hoodie_Patrol,1 point,Sun Apr 13 11:38:14 2014 UTC,Oh great thanks!
LoLeventVoDs,22ulgy,TheWhite2086,2,Sun Apr 13 11:42:49 2014 UTC,The links for Game 1 of K3 vs Mouse (B1) are pointing to Game 2 of the same matchup (B2). Just thought I'd let you know.
LoLeventVoDs,22ulgy,TheGanzfeldMan,1 point,Mon Apr 14 17:07:29 2014 UTC,All fixed - thanks for pointing it out :)
LoLeventVoDs,22ulgy,benjiben,1 point,Mon Apr 14 17:18:52 2014 UTC,Did some of the games get delayed? I can't find VoDs or even results of the CSGvDNL game.

LoLeventVoDs,228na8,Do_You_Even_Downvote,11,Mon Apr 14 08:26:44 2014 UTC,Will there be youtube links for this weekend's games?  Twitch VODs don't load for me for whatever reason.
LoLeventVoDs,228na8,TheAbactor,1 point,Sun Apr 13 13:02:02 2014 UTC,"Absolutely. YouTube links for the Semi-Finals are now up. Generally, when I'm covering non-LAN events, I'll update the YouTube VODs the day after the matches are played. Similarly, I wouldn't expect YouTube links for the Finals and 3rd Place matches until 12~24 hours after the matches actually happen.  -/u/Rexozord"
LoLeventVoDs,228na8,dreamsplease,3,Sun Apr 13 20:48:34 2014 UTC,Is /u/Rexozord not doing the finals???
LoLeventVoDs,228na8,dreamsplease,5,Mon Apr 14 03:30:51 2014 UTC,"Okay, here looks like the first game of the finals: http://www.twitch.tv/riotgames/b/519583988?t=6h10m40s  Here is roughly the 2nd game of the finals: http://www.twitch.tv/riotgames/b/519583988?t=7h05m40s  Just screw with the timestamp a bit to find the appropriate game"
