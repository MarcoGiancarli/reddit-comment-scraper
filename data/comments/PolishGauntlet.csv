PolishGauntlet,3e2oc6,cupicakexx,1 point,Wed Jul 22 04:46:12 2015 UTC,"I wanted to try out some of the polishes I got from /u/cupicakexx in my awesome theme exchange box, and happened to see a design similar to this online so I thought I'd give it a go. I was a bit unfocused and made so many mistakes (painting outside the nail, smudging the bottom layer when the Senche was drying, misplacing the tape etc), but all those things considered I think it came out okay. Will definitely try this design again though and hopefully do better.  The polishes are OPI Mermaid's Tears and You're So Vain-illa. I think they go really well together! Both of them, and the striping tape, are from the theme exchange box so thanks again cupicakexx! <3"

K so I was chatting with somebody and showed them the ILNP summer preview and mentioned that Birefringence is considered their must-have and then I noticed spellcheck didn't have a problem with that word...so I looked it up. Something to do with refractive qualities within rocks/gems. I had totally thought it was a sci-fi reference or something. This was literally the morning I asked you if I could still join the exchange, and when I saw you wanted Birefringence and Mirrorball I really wanted to do Playing with Light as a theme!""  And omg. Did she nail it. Playing with light? Yessss. I totally thought that biregringence was sci-fish too. I love my box and everything in it!!!!"
PolishGauntlet,3db3iu,twerkysandwich,3,Tue Jul 14 22:14:32 2015 UTC,"So glad you like it! It was risky because it was toyish and not everyone appreciates that kind of thing. The kaleidoscope had me the most hesitant but I hadn't seen a modern one with a tube and it had good reviews, so... It's so awesome that it rings a sentimental bell with you!   I can also thank you for spurring me to place an ILNP order, I got Bi for myself too and it's also my first one. I also got Cameo and Cygnus Loop and they got me enthusiastic about nail polish again, I love them.   Love you! Let me know what Chris says about the laser!"

Actually, I think it was someone on here who linked me to the kickstarter. This was my first time using it. I really liked it, it dried things super quick and the color is very cute, but I'll wait with a full review (on Hubpages) until I've used it a bit more.   The deco is just stickers, but I quite liked how it turned out! I think this color suits me, even though I normally prefer purples that are more towards the blue than the pink."

PolishGauntlet,3bog52,DodgyBollocks,5,Tue Jun 30 21:15:28 2015 UTC,"I have mixed feelings about this. I have gotten ripped off on Reddit exchanges before so I think I'll sit this one out. Might do the sticker one though.   I think I'll stick to PG for my polishes exchanges, I know I can count on you lovies!"
PolishGauntlet,3bog52,Lolla-Lee-Lou,2,Wed Jul 1 05:52:17 2015 UTC,"Hmmm, I said no more exchanges for a while, but I may have to make an exception!"

PolishGauntlet,3bog52,Marisyn,2,Wed Jul 1 01:35:09 2015 UTC,That's also my fear TBH haha. I signed up anyway since I've never done an exchange through reddit exchange before. It just kind of spoke to me anyway haha.   Also hoping I get one of us. Just a wee bit partial to you ladies lol

PolishGauntlet,3bjaip,hollysglad,3,Mon Jun 29 18:08:41 2015 UTC,Its lovely! I got my Desert Sunset and Daydream today. I'm pretty disappointed in Daydream since it looks more mint to me than an aqua blue.   Wish I would've gotten entwined!
PolishGauntlet,3bjaip,beclyn,1 point,Mon Jun 29 21:03:07 2015 UTC,"I got Daydream as well but had to put the Entwined on first, lol!  It works perfectly because I just got my order of nail gems in that I bought back in April so I'll be blinging(Does anyone say that anymore? Lol) it up soon, haha!"
PolishGauntlet,3bjaip,beclyn,2,Mon Jun 29 21:05:36 2015 UTC,We can bling it back...   You see what I did there?? Hahaha
PolishGauntlet,3bjaip,lwarzy,1 point,Mon Jun 29 21:33:10 2015 UTC,I am still waiting on mine... but because I was also hoping to get a light blue holo instead of another minty holo (a la March 2015) with Daydream....... I wonder if I could franken it with a few drops of May 2015 to make it more blue? Hmmmmm....
PolishGauntlet,3bjaip,beclyn,1 point,Tue Jun 30 17:26:21 2015 UTC,Lmk how it turns out if you do!

PolishGauntlet,3a8l3c,Ihatejellybeans1,2,Thu Jun 18 07:52:27 2015 UTC,I have all my polishes on swatch sticks. It helps sometimes but I usually end up staring at my polish racks until I feel inspired.

I also like... non-glittering glitters? What are those called? Flakies? Like KBShimmer's Oh Splat or whatnot. My favorite types of glitter/flake polishes tend to be the sort that have several different sizes/colors/shapes in them at once. But I also like smaller glitters with one or two colors only.  Textured like those sand polishes? I have one of those and it's pretty awesome, but it's not something I wear often. Love crellies and creams! Never tried a holographic polish but would love to. Mainstream I own the most CG, indie I guess KBShimmer but I think I only have 3 of those. Favorite scent: Chai! I do quite like lavender too but I like a lot of things and chai's pretty awesome.  Day off... it's a toss-up between B and D.  Seasons: all of them, all of them, all of them, all of them. Sorry! I drink practically all my tea plain, no milk and no sugar. I do like a dab of honey if I have a sore throat.    Let me know if you have any follow up questions!"

PolishGauntlet,3a0dg8,lochnessie15,2,Tue Jun 16 17:31:34 2015 UTC,Oh its hard to pick just one...  I did this one with I Love NP Mutagen. I hadn't finished my clean up yet but I love how it looks like it's glowing.  This one reminds me of the 80s  Super simple but I loved it all the same.  Tentacles!

PolishGauntlet,39q6qx,hanstalhoffer,1 point,Sat Jun 13 22:42:41 2015 UTC,This is the whole reason I don't post there or anywhere on reddit with my stuff anymore. A lot of art work like paintings and digital art work stuff were stolen as well by other websites and actually SOLD prints of things without the artists knowledge or consent.

Least favorite polish brand(s): I have Essies and probably want some, but I do tend to find many of them a bit watery/thin D: Favorite color(s): Purple, blue, pink, green. Least favorite color(s): Yellow, orange. Current lemming: I meant to buy Lucky 13 Lacq​uer's Spir​itual Fore​st - which is an item that was only sold at Mei Mei​'s Sign​ature​s - ages ago. Idk if it's even available anymore D:  Polish-related items you could always use more of: Orly Bonder, Ain't Nobody Got Time for That (quick-drying topcoat DN makes), cotton balls, and orange sticks. Link us to any wishlist(s) you have that weren't listed in your sign-up info: You should have my Etsy and Amazon wishlists for polishes. Here is my non-polish wishlist if you want to see examples of some things I like. Do you keep a spreadsheet of polishes you already own? Link us: You should have this in my signup info! What are some of your interests? I love graphic novels, Stephen King books, reading in general. Big fan of nerdy TV shows (currently finishing SHIELD). I also sing in a women's barbershop chorus.  What are some of your favorite movies and TV shows? Movies: The Usual Suspects, anything in the Marvel universe (especially Guardians of the Galaxy), Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings, ALL THINGS DISNEY (especially Big Hero 6, Brave, Tangled), Harold and Maude, Thirteen Ghosts. TV shows: SHIELD, Once Upon a Time (I'm behind though, no spoilers please!), Fullmetal Alchemist, Soul Eater, Game of Thrones (also behind - we don't have HBO), Law and Order: SVU, Hawaii 5-0, Firefly, House of Cards. What are some of your favorite books? All things Stephen King, the Sandman series by Neil Gaiman, all things Batman, all things Alan Moore, the Harry Potter series, the LotR series, Oliver Twist by Charles Dickens, the Game of Thrones series. I also read a lot of philosophy! (Note: Spoil away on any of these series; I've finished them all.) Would you consider yourself a member of any fandoms? I'll geek out over anything Harry Potter or Marvel-related.  What are some of your favorite snack foods? I'm trying to lose weight, so please don't send me foods unless they're carb-free things (like beef jerky)! I do like coffee of all kinds and teas of all kinds (especially breakfast blends). Are you okay with homemade snacks? Definitely! Any dietary restrictions that were not included in your sign-up? (Allergies, low-carb, vegan/vegetarian, low-fat, gluten free, etc?) Low-carb, preferably! What non-polish item would make you smile if you found it in your box? If you hand-make something, I will love it. Same with hand-written things. Do you have any pets? One 8 m/o puppy (Winry), two cats around three y/o (Harley and Selina). The puppy likes all kinds of treats, especially meat-based all natural stuffs. She will tear the shit out of all stuffed/soft toys and throw fluff everywhere, so that's probably not advised if you want her to keep it for a while! She's great with Busy Buddy brand toys (puzzle toys designed for lots of chew time without breaking, she has the bone and the rope jar) and the rubber-y kind of toys that are designed for heavy chew time. For the cats, one of them loves catnip, but neither will eat treats. Do you have a significant other and/or little ones we should consider stuffing in treats for? If so, what do they like? My s/o, Andy, likes Reeses. But he's also starting P90X with me so Idk if they'd be a good idea (though he does like beef jerky like I do!). Anything else we should know about you? Not that I can think of, but feel free to ask me anything!"

PolishGauntlet,39binz,cupicakexx,2,Thu Jun 11 13:49:57 2015 UTC,Random questions....for science....  Favorite scent(s)? Shoe size? T-Shirt size? Do you like board/card games?  Plans for the summer? Favorite animal? Do you like the beach?  Pick one - Coke or Pepsi Iron man or Thor Green or blue Beach or camping Marvel or dc Summer or winter  Sweet or salty
PolishGauntlet,39binz,batdalek,2,Fri Jun 12 15:23:41 2015 UTC,"SCIENCE.  Uh lets see.    I really like warm scents (for example, my favorite E&A cuticle oil is Pumpkin Apple Butter). But it is summer so fruity and minty scents are great too! I would just say please avoid floral scents because they often make me sneeze. Shoe size is usually ~9.5 (US women's). I love board/card games!!! We have Cards Against Humanity and play that super frequently. I also have this game called Guillotine which is a card game that is amazing (but I'm missing 1 card and the directions lmao), as well as a board game called Last Night on Earth with zombies!  Plans for the summer... we're hoping to be able to go to Andy's international chorus competition which is being held in Pittsburgh in the first week of July, but it's awfully expensive so it's still a bit up in the air. Other than that, I'll have various chorus-related performances for my chorus and his chorus, we're still unpacking our house, and I'd like to get dog-training lessons for our new puppy (Winry). Favorite animal umm... I don't know! Probably elephants, foxes, or manatees? /random I love the beach! But Illinois is beach-less, unless you count something like Lake Michigan which I would never swim in lmao. I've been to the Atlantic Ocean multiple times because I have a lot of family out there, but still never the Pacific.   Pick one list:   I'm one of those people that like... really doesn't care. Is that bad? Uh, I guess Coke. Hmhmhm. This is tough. Idk I feel like if we're going by the movies, I'd pick Iron Man because RDJ is badass. But really, Thor is probably best. But Black Widow and Cap are my favorite Avengers :D Blue Beach MARVEL. With the exception of Batman/Batgirl/Catwoman/Joker/Harley who are probably my favorite set of characters in general. But Marvel is definitely far better overall. Summer Sweet (or both!)"

PolishGauntlet,38xjd4,Zoobles88,2,Sun Jun 7 18:14:43 2015 UTC,"Yesss I'm so excited! Hannibal is the only thing that will ease the pain when this season of Game of Thrones is over. This looks really neat and clean, is the stag head a decal?"
PolishGauntlet,38xjd4,Celladoore,1 point,Sun Jun 7 18:21:34 2015 UTC,"They are, yes!  These are what I used!"
PolishGauntlet,38xjd4,TheSilverLining,2,Sun Jun 7 18:25:46 2015 UTC,"That's a really nice mani!  I did enjoy the first seasons of Hannibal. Wasn't totally sold (I'll admit the visual gore was a bit much for me), but I did love Mads Mikkelsen in it. Will probably wait until the whole season is out and then binge. In the middle of too many shows right now, which is quite uncommon for me."
PolishGauntlet,38xjd4,TheSilverLining,2,Sun Jun 7 21:08:25 2015 UTC,"I totally sympathize with the too many shows thing haha  It is rather gruesome, season two has a lot of it as well - just so you know.  First episode of season 3 wasn't too bad, but I'm sure it'll happen"
PolishGauntlet,38xjd4,kimipixi,2,Sun Jun 7 21:16:58 2015 UTC,"Oh, I've seen S2, too. And yes, it really does, haha. I expect no different for S3, playing with visually macabre things seems to be their ""thing"". Still, it's a good show. I'm sure I'll get in the mood for macabre at some point! :D"
PolishGauntlet,38xjd4,greatfia,1 point,Sun Jun 7 21:45:18 2015 UTC,I just started the first season despite freaking out about it when it was just teasers.   Can we just take a moment to appreciate Mads? he's FREAKING gorgeous!

PolishGauntlet,38vjji,silentwail,2,Sun Jun 7 12:46:57 2015 UTC,I love your taping designs. Always so clean and each one matches! Maybe drinking is the trick to striping tape without the urge to murder. 😉
PolishGauntlet,38vjji,silentwail,2,Sun Jun 7 16:22:26 2015 UTC,Maybe it is... you're relaxed enough to just keep rolling with it.

PolishGauntlet,38racv,secretagentkitty,2,Sat Jun 6 22:42:06 2015 UTC,You're welcome! I may have to add them to my wishlist. I'm on a never ending quest for better clean up brushes.

PolishGauntlet,3850m4,TheSilverLining,2,Tue Jun 2 06:58:31 2015 UTC,"Yes, inquiring minds want to know"
PolishGauntlet,3850m4,snonymous,2,Tue Jun 2 08:10:21 2015 UTC,"Thanks!  Everything but the ring finger is just dry brushing.  On the ring finger I kind of blended three colors together to make a gradient, then dry brushed a bit on top. :)"
PolishGauntlet,3850m4,TheSilverLining,2,Wed Jun 3 04:18:32 2015 UTC,Awesome!
PolishGauntlet,3855u3,princessbubbleguum,2,Mon Jun 1 22:50:15 2015 UTC,I did last week!  My middle one broke almost immediately after I polished and I wanted to cry!  It looked horrible so I had to cut and repolish :-(
PolishGauntlet,3855u3,hollysglad,1 point,Mon Jun 1 23:11:07 2015 UTC,"I just cut mine because one broke really bad. So I'm left with super short nails, and I needed my nails looking fabulous for the weekend :/"
PolishGauntlet,3855u3,hollysglad,2,Mon Jun 1 23:24:24 2015 UTC,What about acrylic tips?  If not then I'm sure you could figure something out!  Good luck!
PolishGauntlet,3855u3,hollysglad,1 point,Tue Jun 2 00:08:20 2015 UTC,"I haven't worn any before and literally don't know how to use these, I will have to get some though ! Do you use them? Know of a good brand, I don't want my nails falls off lol"
PolishGauntlet,3855u3,fairyrebel,2,Tue Jun 2 19:54:18 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately I don't have any experience in purchasing any and putting them on myself.  I had fake ones put on by a salon for my wedding but that was it, sorry!"
PolishGauntlet,3855u3,doombubble,2,Tue Jun 2 22:11:40 2015 UTC,I have to cut mine every time I fly for work because otherwise I am guaranteed to break at least one on my luggage. Sometimes that's every week for months. :(  I took up a hobby that makes me keep them short just so I wouldn't feel as bad about it.
PolishGauntlet,3855u3,kagenails,2,Tue Jun 2 00:44:52 2015 UTC,I have tried (without success) to try and ignore my broken nail...then a few hours later I cave in and cut them all down a bit.
PolishGauntlet,3855u3,corporatecrocodile,2,Tue Jun 2 00:51:13 2015 UTC,Just happened to me this weekend and I'm glad I'm not the only one!! I felt stupid because I want to cry every time I look at my poor tiny nubs :(
PolishGauntlet,3855u3,TheSilverLining,2,Tue Jun 2 01:46:34 2015 UTC,"I guess I'm the odd one out -- whenever one nail breaks, I just let one nail be short and continue about my business. Right now, both of my middle finger nails are stubs, while I have luxuriously long thumb, ring, and pinky nails. Oops."
PolishGauntlet,3855u3,LolaBunBun,2,Tue Jun 2 02:26:14 2015 UTC,"I do the same thing! Up to a point. Usually up to 3 shorties, I leave the others, but if number 4 or 5 break while the others are still short, then I cut them all short."
PolishGauntlet,3855u3,LolaBunBun,2,Tue Jun 2 06:56:49 2015 UTC,Throw a falsie on until it grows out.
PolishGauntlet,3855u3,LolaBunBun,2,Tue Jun 2 15:17:56 2015 UTC,"I already cut them all, now I have stubby nails. I needed my nails to look nice for the weekend  :/"
PolishGauntlet,3855u3,LolaBunBun,2,Tue Jun 2 15:38:46 2015 UTC,"Throw some falsies on for the day. Maybe those ones that have the ""nice to nails"" glue already on them."
PolishGauntlet,3855u3,Blackwaters28,2,Tue Jun 2 15:40:19 2015 UTC,I will have to do that! Thanks girl :)
PolishGauntlet,3855u3,vash_the_stampede,1 point,Tue Jun 2 19:52:22 2015 UTC,People always boo when falsies are mentioned but it's the only way I can have nails at all lol. They are good for a quick fix!

Cuteness:   Pibbles are adorable. Enjoying life   Compliments (yay!):   /u/netters_nails was one of the first people to welcome me when I was new here! She engaged me in conversation, and it helped me feel like part of the community so much quicker! I have never seen a mani by /u/lerin that I didn't like. Like, evry single one of her manis I love. Her photos are so clear and crisp, too!   Favorite Manis! So hard to choose!   Circuit Board Mani Golden Koi. I still think this is my favorite manicure I've ever done.

My first and only attempt at galaxy nails - they also had a glow-in-the-dark top coat, so they were extra outer space-y 2.

PolishGauntlet,37xi4c,silentwail,3,Sun May 31 21:05:30 2015 UTC,"This day three years ago I had a 9lb 8oz 20 1/2 inch growth extracted from me.  We decided to take it home, feed it, and give it a name.  Now it's all walking and talking all over the place.  So I guess I'll be busy with my son today, I hope things go better for you!"
PolishGauntlet,37xi4c,vash_the_stampede,1 point,Sun May 31 12:51:10 2015 UTC,Happy birthday to your boy! 🎉 My daughter was also 9lb8oz (not 80oz)...did having such a big baby make you scared to ever hold a 6 or 7lb baby after? I had friends that had baby's soon after but I was always weary of holding something so little!
PolishGauntlet,37xi4c,silentwail,1 point,Sun May 31 17:47:32 2015 UTC,"Is that a 0 instead of an O? Cause that's a big big baby if so! Haha   My daughter was 7lb4oz and she felt just right, but her dad was terrified to hold her. :)"
PolishGauntlet,37xi4c,hollysglad,2,Sun May 31 18:13:56 2015 UTC,"Oh shit hahaha, I didn't even notice that.   Any baby over 8lbs feels perfect in my arms but if someone tries to hand me a 6lb baby I freak out. They're too tiny!"
PolishGauntlet,37xi4c,silentwail,1 point,Sun May 31 18:18:58 2015 UTC,My daughter was only 7lbs 13oz and 17 1/2 in but she is my oldest (will be 5 in July).  But one year (off by one day) after my son was born my husband's cousin had a little girl and she was about as big as my daughter.  It was a little awkward holding her and it wasn't until she was 2 months old that we got to see her but she was still only about 8lbs.
PolishGauntlet,37xi4c,unlodgical,1 point,Sun May 31 20:10:34 2015 UTC,"I had never held a newborn before I had my daughter...only 3 months or older. So her, at 9.5lbs and already in 3-6 month old clothes when she left the hospital was like never having a newborn. Tiny babies freak me out now. She's 16 now though, so maybe I'm ready to try holding another one again. 😜"
PolishGauntlet,37xi4c,hollysglad,1 point,Sun May 31 20:26:38 2015 UTC,OMG. I was so scared for you. It took me too long to figure that out lol. Congratulations!!!!

PolishGauntlet,37xi4c,fairyrebel,2,Sun May 31 21:03:55 2015 UTC,"I've been away from PG for a while due to a super busy semester, followed by three weeks of summer camp. I'm an environmental science major so we spent three weeks in the mountains doing all kinds of different field work. It was super fun, but took up pretty much all my time and energy, so I'm glad to be home... But now I leave for California on Tuesday and need to pack for three months away. Bah! Between that and trying to find a summer job and everything, I'm just in a constant state of stress. Things should start calming down once I get to California :)"
PolishGauntlet,37xi4c,breedlovehoops,2,Sun May 31 05:43:52 2015 UTC,"Yay! What part of California? This state is so huge, it's pretty ridiculous. I'm in the San Diego area, myself, but I grew up in Mammoth.   How do you even begin to pack for 3 months?? I would just take everything with me lol"
PolishGauntlet,37xi4c,breedlovehoops,2,Sun May 31 18:15:57 2015 UTC,"Central coast, right between LA and San Francisco! I'd love to visit San Diego, especially the zoo. I don't know much about Mammoth, but it seems nice. It's one of the places that I always see jobs for when I'm looking for jobs in CA, haha.  And yeah.. packing is hard. The worst part is my polish collection is so big now that I can't take it all. :("
PolishGauntlet,37xi4c,fairyrebel,1 point,Mon Jun 1 01:41:42 2015 UTC,"Hey I live on the Central Coast! :D  It's nice here and the weather has been wonderful, but if you could possibly bring some rain along with you I'm sure nobody would mind..."
PolishGauntlet,37xi4c,silentwail,2,Mon Jun 1 04:25:57 2015 UTC,"I noticed when I was looking at your wishlist!! My SO's grew up in the five cities area. Probably getting dinner in Pismo on the day I fly in!   Yeah, the weather is amazing, but I did miss the rain a bit after spending last summer there. I wish I could send rain! We had a super snowy winter and a super rainy spring :("
PolishGauntlet,37xi4c,fairyrebel,2,Mon Jun 1 06:02:47 2015 UTC,"Nice! If you have a chance while you're here I highly recommend Ember restaurant in AG. It's a bit pricey but it's easily the best restaurant here and it's only been open a little over a year.  Next door to Ember there's a little bakery that is awesome too called Sweet Pea, you can't go wrong if you make a day of those two places. :)  Enjoy your time in the area! We should be looking forward to some beautiful beach days for the next couple months!"
PolishGauntlet,37xi4c,silentwail,1 point,Mon Jun 1 06:07:09 2015 UTC,Thanks for the recommendation! We thought about hitting up Ember a couple times last year but ended up passing on it. I'll definitely try to make time for it this summer!
PolishGauntlet,37xi4c,fairyrebel,1 point,Tue Jun 2 02:23:41 2015 UTC,"I'm not entering, but I wanted to chat.  What fun things are you doing in California? I would love to take a extended vacation down there some time to do a little of everything. Touristy things of course, but hiking and camping would be fun too."
PolishGauntlet,37xi4c,LolaBunBun,1 point,Sun May 31 16:07:18 2015 UTC,"Mostly just spending time with my boyfriend! We're long distance through most of the year so I spend the summer there so we can be together. Maybe a trip to Disneyland and one trip to the bay area for some touristy stuff, but mostly just working and hopefully some hiking in the area where I'll be :)"
PolishGauntlet,37xi4c,beclyn,1 point,Mon Jun 1 01:39:59 2015 UTC,That sounds like a great way to spend the summer!
PolishGauntlet,37xi4c,unlodgical,2,Mon Jun 1 01:43:38 2015 UTC,"The last few months have been busy and terrible for me, but things are finally normalizing. In October the company I work for switched me to a new project that was just insanely busy, and now that project is over and I've been switched back to my old project which is insanely dis-busy.  My dog got turbo-sick on Christmas and she's been critically ill since then, but she finally had her very first ""things look good and almost normal"" blood test a couple weeks ago. It's been one test every week to two weeks since we discovered she was sick so I'm glad to finally hear good news. Now if only she wasn't on a million medications ridiculous times a day... At least I can go back to sleeping in my bed now instead of on the couch.  I'm going to a birthday party for my friend's adorable baby tomorrow so I'm going to have to paint my nails tonight. I even have a new color to try, Zoya's Rayne!   Hope all you chickies have been well!"
PolishGauntlet,37xi4c,breedlovehoops,2,Sun May 31 07:34:13 2015 UTC,Poor puppy! I hope everything continues to get better! ❤ It's so heartbreaking when animals get sick because they don't always let you know quick enough that something is wrong and they're always putting on a happy face through the pain.
PolishGauntlet,37xi4c,unlodgical,2,Sun May 31 17:50:05 2015 UTC,"It was crazy because we took her in for routine bloodwork the week before Christmas in anticipation of having her teeth cleaned after the holidays, and it revealed she had like zero platelets in her blood. We started seeing bruising from internal bleeding on Christmas day and if we hadn't come in for the bloodwork she probably would have died before we could do anything about it. We got really lucky. There were no symptoms until it was almost too late.  The medications to suppress her immune system were the worst. She was so weak she couldn't make it upstairs to the bedroom at night, and she had to go out to pee like every 20 minutes for weeks at a time. She's doing really well though, she's much stronger now and almost back to her regular self even with all the meds she's still on."
PolishGauntlet,37xi4c,breedlovehoops,1 point,Mon Jun 1 03:54:31 2015 UTC,Routine checkups are so important for this reason! It's wonderful she's progressing. You sound like a wonderful pet parent ❤
PolishGauntlet,37xi4c,unlodgical,1 point,Mon Jun 1 11:48:44 2015 UTC,"Ohhh no, work stress and pet stress are awful on their own, I can't imagine dealing with both. :( I hope your pup feels better soon! And enjoy Rayne. It looks gorgeous :D"
PolishGauntlet,37xi4c,breedlovehoops,1 point,Sun May 31 21:07:38 2015 UTC,I think it was probably the hardest thing I've had to deal with in years. I travel for work so part of the time I was out of state and just hoping my bf could handle her insane medication schedule and the all night pee party.  She's doing much better now! Oh gosh and Rayne is pretty! I'll have to take some pictures when it's not dark. :)
PolishGauntlet,37xi4c,unlodgical,2,Mon Jun 1 03:56:16 2015 UTC,Hurting but herbally medicated to function.

PolishGauntlet,37v2h9,netters_nails,3,Sat May 30 17:28:01 2015 UTC,I love Gauntlettes!!
PolishGauntlet,37v2h9,princessbubbleguum,3,Sat May 30 18:36:18 2015 UTC,This is what I need to do to get back into nail art.  I've lost my mojo for it.  Thanks for mentioning it!
PolishGauntlet,37v2h9,cupicakexx,11,Sun May 31 16:23:00 2015 UTC,"Honestly, this place is toast. The mods harassed a very active member (a good friend of mine) for not fulfilling a gauntlet that happened over 9 months ago. The reason it was brought up? Oh, it was because the other mod had won the gauntlet. Pretty shady shit huh?  Many people left because of confrontation, hence why not a lot of people are getting polished anymore.   I used to love this sub, but the actions of certain mods disgust me.  Bringing this to light is probably going to get me banned. Nettersnails knows where to find me."
PolishGauntlet,37v2h9,breedlovehoops,3,Sat May 30 18:45:59 2015 UTC,This...makes me so sad :(
PolishGauntlet,37v2h9,Zoobles88,4,Sat May 30 23:37:14 2015 UTC,I had contacted the mods a few months ago because I had not received a gauntlet prize. They advised me to contact the person and I did. Never heard pack from that person. I contacted the mods again and didn't hear back from them either.
PolishGauntlet,37v2h9,breedlovehoops,3,Sat May 30 20:28:28 2015 UTC,That's nuts :-\
PolishGauntlet,37v2h9,vash_the_stampede,2,Sat May 30 22:34:51 2015 UTC,"Oh, is that why this sub is so quiet? I haven't been super active for a while, and now that I have time, this place is like a ghost town.  Same thing at /r/redditpolish where no one is really there anymore. That makes me sad, my two favorite subs going quiet :("
PolishGauntlet,37v2h9,DarthVaderette,2,Sun May 31 18:28:23 2015 UTC,"That isn't even remotely how it happened, so feel free to PM me for the whole story."
PolishGauntlet,37v2h9,breedlovehoops,9,Sun May 31 00:46:09 2015 UTC,"I know the whole story. I also know that you contacted every winner in that Louis Vuitton gauntlet but me. I think it's kind of strange to be bringing up a gauntlet that was over 9 months old when you failed to chose a winner in your own gauntlet a few months back. The only reason I know that is because I was one of the few people who entered.   One of the subs number one rules is to not ask for prizes. We are a community built on generosity. There's no place for rude behavior. You don't need to pm me, everything that needs to be said can be stated publicly."
PolishGauntlet,37v2h9,DarthVaderette,0,Sun May 31 01:30:58 2015 UTC,"the two other winners I spoke to (because I knew off the top of my head who they were) hadn't received them either. She knew who the other person was and another winner knew you hadn't received it either. So I'm not sure how this makes me a shitty person when I even told her I personally didn't care if I got the prize or not. And being as she's someone I speak to and considered a friend, I sure as hell did not harass her. It was more of a ""I was messaged by someone who said she didn't receive anything from a year ago, and the 3 winners from the louboutin gauntlet didn't get anything either so uh, just take care of it when you get a chance""   So no. You obviously don't know the whole story if you think I harassed her because I gave a fuck about a stupid polish when I haven't polished my nails since January."
PolishGauntlet,37v2h9,breedlovehoops,4,Sun May 31 01:43:35 2015 UTC,Why was it even brought up then? The sub rules clearly state not to ask about it.
PolishGauntlet,37v2h9,DarthVaderette,3,Sun May 31 01:51:46 2015 UTC,"Because if there's multiple people that haven't been polished for different gauntlets and have complained, I am going to say something to the gauntlet host about it. Yeah I can't force someone to polish someone, but it's possible they forgot about it. A lot of times people have already polished the person and just forgot to post a polished post.   The person in question, I was messaged by 3 people who won a gauntlet hosted by her and were never polished. The big issue was that they felt slighted because she continued to polish other people and hosts contests but they never received anything. Because it was multiple people and someone I was friends with, I figured I'd just let her know. But I guess that makes me a shitty person?"
PolishGauntlet,37v2h9,breedlovehoops,6,Sun May 31 01:59:35 2015 UTC,"I never said you were a shitty person, I just said it was shady to only speak up when your friend was involved. You are a mod. You should be setting a good example by completing your own gauntlets. If your fellow mods aren't helping they should have been talked to, and then replaced."
PolishGauntlet,37v2h9,Bocconcini,8,Sun May 31 02:06:41 2015 UTC,"I'm going to just jump in here for a second........  I messaged Darth a few weeks ago asking about it... I know she's the most active Mod here, which is how it got brought up so late in the game. Because I entered another gauntlet and won, and didn't get anything, a update message, sorry it's not coming message, nothing. I was giving the person the benefit of the doubt because life happens, I completely understand that part. I'm not around that much myself these days because of work, but do come around every week or two.    I pretty much assumed a long while ago I wasn't going to get anything. I don't really care about not getting polished, but I do think it's shady when you run lavish gauntlets and don't follow through with it, multiple times. And then continue to run other gauntlets when you haven't fulfilled your prior commitments.   I am as much friends with her as I am with you, on Facebook and Instagram, with casual interaction, few comments, likes, hearts, whatever.   So..."
PolishGauntlet,37v2h9,breedlovehoops,0,Sun May 31 06:30:35 2015 UTC,"I guess the big thing that confuses me is why it's now suddenly a problem. I dug back to figure out what gauntlet you last won from her and it was 10 months ago.   We aren't talking about someone who is inactive and intentionally screwing people over. Why would she continue to come back and polish people if she was trying to pull a fast one?   No offense to Jess, but she can be forgetful. That's what happens when you are taking care of that many kids and aren't getting enough sleep.   Another thing I would like to note is that during that whole period she was dealing with a lot of medical stuff. She actually went completely inactive on reddit for quite a few months because of it."
PolishGauntlet,37v2h9,Bocconcini,1 point,Sun May 31 16:00:44 2015 UTC,"Okay, fine, i'll message her directly and say something."
PolishGauntlet,37v2h9,Blackwaters28,3,Sun May 31 16:45:34 2015 UTC,"I am pretty new to this sub, but it does seem pretty quiet..."
PolishGauntlet,37v2h9,DarthVaderette,4,Sun May 31 01:41:52 2015 UTC,"As of right now, I believe I'm the only mod who even checks PG. everyone else has life stuff going on or has just drifted from PG. I haven't had time to sit down and really involve myself like I use to because I too have my own things going on and am going through a bad bout of anxiety/depression as well. I haven't forgotten about the gauntlettes. I haven't even done my nails in months.   I try to throw something together quick in the next few days or so."
PolishGauntlet,37v2h9,batdalek,9,Sun May 31 00:54:59 2015 UTC,"Have you thought about asking for more mods to help with activity and, well, moderation? Life gets in the way, especially during the summer, and anxiety/depression really screws up everything, so it's understandable that you've been away."
PolishGauntlet,37v2h9,cupicakexx,4,Sun May 31 01:12:32 2015 UTC,"Depression and anxiety is awful.  I hope you start to feel better.  If you ever need help with anything, I'm here.  You can always get me on FB.  I'm more active on FB, because it's easier for me to be there since I use it for part of my job.  I love this place, and hadn't heard about any kind of disagreement/problem until I read this post.  I'm sorry to hear something went wrong somewhere...and even worse, it seems to have caused negative opinions/feelings amoung members.  :(  I hope whatever it was/is, can be worked out."
PolishGauntlet,37v2h9,hollysglad,2,Sun May 31 16:21:41 2015 UTC,"Life happens, we all understand that.  You're awesome for doing what you're doing.  I'm sure the other mods do have things going on as well.  Have you communicated with each other at all?  I have anxiety/depression as well, I COMPLETELY understand, it sucks!  Do yourself a favor and pamper yourself a bit.  You need some way of destressing."
PolishGauntlet,37v2h9,Lolla-Lee-Lou,2,Sun May 31 01:31:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I noticed that you seem to be doing all the work yourself these days. :( Don't stress about getting stuff out. You and your mental health come first, no matter what. I can't speak for everyone here, but I love the hell out of PolishGauntlet and I plan to stick around, even if we are going through a bit of a rough patch. :) I hope you feel better soon. 💞"

PolishGauntlet,36os2r,DutchLaquerista,1 point,Thu May 21 21:18:25 2015 UTC,"It's just dry brushing. :) I used 7 shades of green to do it.  I started with OPI Amazon... Amazoff as my base then, with most of the polish wiped off the brush, I randomly brushed each color on to the nail (probably 3-4 times per color per nail) . For this I layered colors from darkest to lightest, then added a few extra swipes of the darkest two colors to give it some depth."
PolishGauntlet,36os2r,DutchLaquerista,2,Fri May 22 07:42:39 2015 UTC,"Ahaa, wauw I would never have guessed this was dry-brush! Thank you, I'm definitely going to try this out :D"
PolishGauntlet,36q0fu,unknownrocker69,6,Thu May 21 05:03:44 2015 UTC,My advice to you would be go pick up a quick dry top coat like Sally Hansen Insta-dry or Seche Vite. A quick dry top coat was and is the only thing I've ever used that actually worked. Unfortunately aside from that I don't know what else to suggest to you because none of the tricks I've heard have actually worked 😕 if this ever happens again where you aren't 100% happy with a salon mani don't be afraid to go back in and ask them to fix it. Usually they will ☺
PolishGauntlet,36q0fu,netters_nails,2,Thu May 21 05:50:17 2015 UTC,"I 100% agree, you need to get yourself a quick dry top coat or some drying drops.  You can get them at any pharmacy that has a basic nail polish selection. I'm a huge gamer and if I didn't use these products my nails would get smudged allllll the time, they really help.  /u/netters_nails has some good products listed there. The drying drops I use are Essie and the quick dry top coats I use are always Sally Hansen."

I think the most embarrassing was my first visit to the obgyn at the tender age of 16. I was so mad at my mom for forcing me to go (I wasn't sexually active but she was convinced I was having sex). I had heard that you're supposed to go to those appointments with a full bladder, I didn't realize that was only a rule for the pregnant people. So I go in and I tell the doctor that I haven't had sex but my hymen was gone from horseback riding. He decided to do a pap smear anyway and when he inserted the speculum I peed all over him. I mean all over, they had to call in a janitor to mop the floor and they moved me to a different room. The doctor was really concerned and asked if I had problems controlling my bladder and I was so indignant and said ""Well, you guys are the ones wanting us to come in with full bladders!!"" He looked so confused then started laughing once he stopped busting a gut he explained where I went wrong and had another chuckle at my expense. The story made it's way all over the floor and all the doctors and nurses were laughing at me."

We went to a great sushi bar met some hot guys, they where hanging out with us. And we where hitting it off. I was kinda buzzed as we where walking on Hollywood Blvd, all the stars on the floor and everything I totally slammed into frank Sinatras star, my heel had broken! I totally  limped  away horrified.

One of my most embarrassing ones was when I was working at a radio station (this is kinda semi inappropriate)...  I was a studio that was different studio than mine which was like a harder-rock studio. It was mostly run by 25-35 year old guys They had a big poster of the movie 'Pirates'. Not, pirates of the Caribbean but the porn movie pirates. I had heard of it because I was 19 at the time and my friends who were living in a dorm were talking about it so it was fresh in my mind. Anyways, the poster was signed and I mentioned it was cool. It didn't don on me until everyone was starring at me that I had just admitted (me, a 19 year old, fresh faced they-all-think-i'm-naiive-girl) that I knew about porn. Awwwwwkward.   HAPPY BIRTHDAY!!

I love the water, the beach and just hanging out with loved ones during the summer.    I know it's a bad pic but this I'd my all time favorite place to be in the summer. Its in the middle of the river a couple miles from my house. You can't tell but its pulling me super hard and if you go to just the right spot you can find a place to hang onto a rock and just let the water rush and pull you. It's so freakin relaxing. Its one of my all time favorite places in the world.  I love all colors but my favorites are purple, blue and pink.  A fan. I have to have something to keep me cool during the hot times. Also a water spray bottle. In the summer me and my family mist and spray each other with water spray bottles. Its a lot of fun and helps you stay cool.  I don't know why but I love these colors in the summer. Especially orange, something about wearing orange means summer to me. Its always been that way for me.  I love to sing ""Girls just wanna have fun"" in the summer. It just reminds me of memories of me and my mom driving around and singing it as loud as we can. Plus its just so much fun to sing.    Thanks again for hosting this contest. It was a lot of fun and now it makes me want summer early! :)"
PolishGauntlet,36c0hw,Ihatejellybeans1,2,Mon May 18 06:04:19 2015 UTC,"That place is really pretty. I love the water so anywhere near it I feel at home.  That orange and pink is so cute, I have colors similar to both those. I might have to copy your mani!!"

There aren't any water parks nearby so we go there to relax and beat the heat. Its strange, but I feel at home in the water too. My friends sometimes tease me for being part mermaid. If there is water and I have a change of clothes then regardless of the weather they know I am jumping in... Plus I love mermaids in general.   Ohhhh you should totally copy it. I had such fun doing this mani. It was my favorite of the ombre nails I have done so far. It was just so freakin fun and bright!"

My favorite summer jams is hard to pin to just one.  I'm a sucker for anything from the 90s, lol.  EDIT: Summer mani posted :-)"

During the summer it gets somewhat touristy, so I go either early morning or late afternoon. Favorite colors are purple, blue, pink, and glitter (that's a color, right?) I cannot live without my ceiling fans. I do not have air conditioning, and although it doesn't get horribly hot, I need that breeze. I just did this memorial day mani yesterday for a friend's barbecue. It's a slow one, but TLC Waterfalls--can't not sing it!"

Teal and jelly/crelly-ness and gorgeous glitters and an awesome KBShimmer formula!  As far as movies, hmm. I understand that Pitch Perfect 2 just came out, so that's an option for actually going to see a movie. Staying in, how about Pitch Perfect (the first one)?

The book doesn't start sinister but after a few pages becomes very unnerving, it's about a creature/man called The Babadook. After reading it the mother tries to get rid of the book in several different ways and strange things begin happening... That's pretty much all I can say without giving away too much. It has some pretty frightening scenes but I wouldn't say it's that bad. Then again, I am a Horror fanatic so my view may be skewed. :P"

PolishGauntlet,35gla4,DodgyBollocks,2,Sun May 10 12:59:29 2015 UTC,Those are so awesome! What stamping plate is that?  PS: I would love to see swatches of that polish!
PolishGauntlet,35gla4,katja31,1 point,Sun May 10 19:13:31 2015 UTC,"The plate is Winstonia W-01.  Here it is on Amazon.  I'll probably be using the polish in my next mani, so keep an eye out later this week. :)"
PolishGauntlet,35gye0,TheSilverLining,2,Sun May 10 06:35:51 2015 UTC,Love it! Way to support such an awesome cause!
PolishGauntlet,35gye0,unlodgical,2,Sun May 10 15:21:25 2015 UTC,Thank you! :)
PolishGauntlet,35g0if,secretagentkitty,2,Sun May 10 00:10:01 2015 UTC,Beautiful color. It looks great against your skin tone.

PolishGauntlet,35cdk1,lochnessie15,2,Fri May 8 23:20:32 2015 UTC,"/u/lynlyn6 - I totally just put Edie on my toenails (and Edie the pup approves)! I already used the Nail Envy, too, and have some serious stamping plate organization to do. Thank you again!"
PolishGauntlet,35cdk1,lynlyn6,1 point,Sat May 9 01:53:29 2015 UTC,"Awesome!  You're very welcome!  I might have to get myself some of those organizer pages after I get a few more big plates, and I'm likely going to start with the MoYou you suggested with all the tools."
PolishGauntlet,35cdk1,DodgyBollocks,2,Sat May 9 02:08:51 2015 UTC,"Yay! That MoYou plate looks really awesome - such a big selection of tools! It might be hard to grab individual images, but decals could totally work, too. I'm going to keep an eye out for their next free shipping promo, that's for sure."
PolishGauntlet,35cdk1,DodgyBollocks,1 point,Sat May 9 02:42:30 2015 UTC,Those three pocket currency organizers look great! Where did you get them/how much were they? I'm on mobile and can't stalk wish lists. Those look like just what I need for my moyou  plates.
PolishGauntlet,35cdk1,DodgyBollocks,2,Sat May 9 22:46:15 2015 UTC,"They were on amazon! Linky. They're mostly showing up as an add-on item right now for $5.80, or $7 + free shipping for non-add-on."
PolishGauntlet,35b3p0,LolaBunBun,5,Fri May 8 16:58:53 2015 UTC,"Since she probably got shafted, I was thinking maybe we could do like last time where instead of one rematch everyone send an item and I could package it all up add some extras and what not and send it on to her since receiving a box is nicer then random items. I could be the mule, no biggie. It's fun :)"
PolishGauntlet,35b3p0,dnd1980,3,Fri May 8 17:05:00 2015 UTC,"I'd totally be game for another rematch if it has to happen! We've had packages get lost before and it really sucks. One way or another, we'll take care of our dear /u/LolaBunBun!"
PolishGauntlet,35b3p0,lochnessie15,2,Fri May 8 17:29:26 2015 UTC,Yay!
PolishGauntlet,35b3p0,dnd1980,2,Fri May 8 17:33:25 2015 UTC,Whoa whoa whoa /u/LolaBunBun didn't get a box? I totally missed this. We must rematch immediately!
PolishGauntlet,35b3p0,itsok_imapirate,1 point,Fri May 8 23:57:42 2015 UTC,No! It's cool! Got updated and just feel like it's best if it's not sent. Real life is WAY more important than polish!
PolishGauntlet,35b3p0,netters_nails,1 point,Sat May 9 00:00:27 2015 UTC,Oh yeah it's happened to me before. Just wanted to touch base.
PolishGauntlet,35b3p0,netters_nails,2,Fri May 8 17:33:51 2015 UTC,You're a super sweetheart. I'm hoping it's just a huge delay and my Santa is ok.
PolishGauntlet,35b3p0,lochnessie15,2,Fri May 8 17:07:20 2015 UTC,Dean does not approve that you don't have a box yet
PolishGauntlet,35b3p0,DarthVaderette,2,Fri May 8 17:08:24 2015 UTC,"I knew it would be late but I can't get ahold of anyone to see if it's still delayed, my Santa could have sent it, it got lost, and they are thinking I'm a huge bitch for not posting a thank you."

PolishGauntlet,357hqk,Zoobles88,2,Thu May 7 19:41:45 2015 UTC,I'm PA just north of the border!
PolishGauntlet,357hqk,Zoobles88,2,Thu May 7 19:44:45 2015 UTC,Ahhhh gotcha :)  I'm about 20 mins south of Baltimore :)
PolishGauntlet,357hqk,Zoobles88,2,Thu May 7 19:52:07 2015 UTC,Still pretty close!  That's about a two hour drive from here.  I love Baltimore.  Everything about it.
PolishGauntlet,357hqk,Zoobles88,2,Thu May 7 20:13:58 2015 UTC,"I do too. It's home <3 last week broke my heart, but I'm so proud of the city for already getting back on it's feet"
PolishGauntlet,357hqk,spottedspot,2,Thu May 7 20:21:07 2015 UTC,"They built that city from the bottom up.  They can do it again, and maybe even better."
PolishGauntlet,357hqk,Zoobles88,2,Thu May 7 20:25:55 2015 UTC,Truth!
PolishGauntlet,357hqk,spottedspot,2,Thu May 7 20:56:10 2015 UTC,Uhhhh... We might be neighbors. Howdy!
PolishGauntlet,357hqk,Zoobles88,1 point,Thu May 7 21:37:10 2015 UTC,Oh my goodness! Midway between Baltimore and DC? :-D
PolishGauntlet,357hqk,spottedspot,2,Thu May 7 21:42:39 2015 UTC,"Much closer to Baltimore than DC. Literally 20 min from the city. Originally from MA, though, so I'm a pats fan. Go Pats! Jk, iknownothingaboutfootball."
PolishGauntlet,354zjr,Lolla-Lee-Lou,2,Thu May 7 03:45:26 2015 UTC,"I use a razor like that, I really like it. It's early in the morning so I can't think straight, but that one is really pretty.   Edit: slightly more awake now. Double edge safety razors are awesome, mine is a vintage Lady Gillette. I'd recommend buying a blade sampler, so you can try a couple different blades before committing to a whole bunch. Luckily they're cheap. One more tip: the razor doesn't need you to apply pressure. The weight of the razor will do most of the work, you just have to keep an eye on the angle you hold it. If you don't have anyone to show you, watch some videos and /r/wicked_edge is a great resource.   Edit 2: obviously not terribly awake. My favorite multichrome is Ludurana Show."
PolishGauntlet,354zjr,dyannnnna,2,Thu May 7 10:34:36 2015 UTC,"Thanks, will definitely check out that sub :)"
PolishGauntlet,354zjr,dnd1980,2,Sat May 9 23:18:44 2015 UTC,Uhh I totally want that. But i'm scared of it lol. Looks like i could do damage with it.
PolishGauntlet,354zjr,dyannnnna,3,Thu May 7 16:20:58 2015 UTC,"If wielded improperly, yes, a safety razor can cause damage. But I've cut myself more/worse with multi blade razors. Just don't shave while drunk. ;)"
PolishGauntlet,354zjr,princessbubbleguum,1 point,Thu May 7 18:07:04 2015 UTC,I think this one would match The Bosom of the Sea Multichrome Color-Shifting by DoctorLacquer or this one  The Head of the Sky Multichrome Color-Shifting by DoctorLacquer
PolishGauntlet,354zjr,DodgyBollocks,1 point,Thu May 7 04:35:51 2015 UTC,"That's beautiful! My earrings I wear 24/7 in my lobes (second holes) are just like that, I couldn't resist them either even if they weren't wisest decision money wise. I would try doing a water marble with your ultrachromes/multichromes if you can. As I have been reminded tonight by my many failed attempts I suck at water marbles.   My personal favorite is ILNP Birefringence because it's f-ing gorgeous! I love picture polish aurora as well and wore it for my birthday last year. Seriously no pictures do it justice."
PolishGauntlet,354zjr,starregazer,2,Thu May 7 05:55:11 2015 UTC,Both of those are gorgeous!!
PolishGauntlet,354l8f,SirRealNailPolish,3,Thu May 7 01:35:07 2015 UTC,"My concerns would be-  damage to the nails during the peeling off part.  If I don't peel it off, what can I remove it with?  Alot of us also use a top coat or base coat that has all the naughty chemicals in it, how would that affect the nail polish?   What's the wear like with no top coat/with a low chemical topcoat/with normal top coat  Aside from that, the colors are really pretty. But there needs to be a ton of testing done possibly even adding a special formulated base/top coat to get the best results.   I normally don't leave self linking blog posts of non members up, but I am curious about this and I'm sure others will be as well."
PolishGauntlet,354l8f,DarthVaderette,1 point,Thu May 7 03:47:58 2015 UTC,"First off thanks for allowing this post. I had no idea where to put it.=p Luckily I have done tons of testing with as many people as I could before even bringing it to the internet. heh To answer your questions, If you decide not to peel it, you can scrape it off with a wooden or plastic ""edge"", your own nail, or even soaking it in hand soap water for a minute will do the trick. Using the Mohs scale, as long as its softer then your nail, I.E. a chopstick, it won't do any damage to your nail. Some base coats have shown to make this polish stick firmer, however the combining methods like soaking first before using a chopstick helps substantially. So far I haven't found a top coat that seems to interfere with my nail polish. I have my own base and top coat or even a gel top coat if you prefer which are also both VOC free and non-toxic. Thanks very much! I view this like piggy paint for adults. I have been thinking of sending out introductory ""testers"" for $5 for 15ml. I think considering that it's a ""green"" alternative that could be a good introductory price. Thoughts? So far I only have one ""negative"" with the polish which is more or less a positive. Under harsh water conditions, the nail polish can become soft and chip easier. That being said to reapply it takes under 2 minutes to dry to the touch.  Any further questions, please fire away!!! Thanks again!"
