MaddenUltimateTeam,3e3yev,UltimateTeam,10,Tue Jul 21 19:45:02 2015 UTC,The styles 95 Kuechly was my man for so long....   For a card that I got for free by doing the solos it was a beast MLB to user for so long in the game....  I kept him until the 97 came out as my #1 MLB....   Bo came to mind first but that was a no brainer....
MaddenUltimateTeam,3e3yev,akaCDub03,2,Tue Jul 21 20:07:42 2015 UTC,I second this. I've had him on my roster most of the year and on like 12 promo weekends I've been able to buy a few only to sell them for 2x a week later. Bought 3 a couple weeks ago for 10-12k and sold all 3 for 23k

MaddenUltimateTeam,3e3yev,rthaw,2,Tue Jul 21 22:09:47 2015 UTC,Hey I'm on ps4! Favorite card all year has been my #1 cornerback 95 Charles Tillman. That card always got me picks. On offense it's gotta be 95 Alshon Jeffery. Such a reliable receiver and solid blocker for the run game.
MaddenUltimateTeam,3e3yev,owned_at_worms,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:17:39 2015 UTC,Sorry to disappoint but the stuff is gone. Alshon is a great WR and Tillman is a top nickel CB in my eyes. Thanks for the input.

MaddenUltimateTeam,3e3yev,Justanotherjustin,2,Tue Jul 21 22:27:20 2015 UTC,My favorite card this year was SB Otto Graham. He was the QB that got me from AP2 into AM1 for the first time and he was a total beast until all the insane ULs came out.
MaddenUltimateTeam,3e3yev,Justanotherjustin,2,Tue Jul 21 22:53:59 2015 UTC,RS Vaccaro. It took a while before I could find a better upgrade.
MaddenUltimateTeam,3e3yev,Finklewink,2,Tue Jul 21 23:29:25 2015 UTC,Honestly Draft Trae Waynes has been outstanding for me. He has gotten so many picks and pass break ups I can't even count how many. He's been an absolute boss for me. Hopefully he can get a good card in MUT 16.
MaddenUltimateTeam,3e3yev,Finklewink,2,Tue Jul 21 23:32:20 2015 UTC,Yeah hopefully one of the starting game choice players.

MaddenUltimateTeam,3e3yev,Justanotherjustin,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:48:20 2015 UTC,"My favorite player is Cameron Wake but since I don't have him, MUT wise, it would have to be a tie between Todd Gurley or Steve Largent boss. Gurley is just a beast, so much that I sold my 99 FE Lacy. He can break off a lot of runs and is pretty good catching the ball out of the backfield. Largent has been a beast for me, almost ungodly. I cant even begin to tell you the times ive put it up on a lob and hes made a spectacular one handed grab to save me. Screens are even worth it with him and he was my returner for the longest time, breaking off two td's on kicks"

But he's super fast, has great play rec, and great hit power... I played him at 3-4 LOLB and he killed it.  QB contain on lock.  Picked off Screen Passes like his job.

Plus all of his other starts like Str Block Shed Tackle Pursuit. He's a must have if you user your SS. And on Offense it had to be 4OJ RG3 for me. I'm a scrambler. I'll sit in the pocket all day and pass when I can but once I feel the pressure in out of there looking to roll out and pass. He's Accurate on the move which is great. And he's my first QB that can run like a HB. I thought FE Luck was good. This mother fucker is an animal.

MaddenUltimateTeam,3e3yev,young_sav_mut,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:48:29 2015 UTC,"From the beginning my favorite player would've been AR Mosley, but now I would say Boss Peppers and Boss JJ Watt both make plays all game. Would've like to have tried the Boss LT though because his stats look ridiculous!"
MaddenUltimateTeam,3e3yev,young_sav_mut,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:46:30 2015 UTC,"I just recently found Mike Wallace in a pack and even though I've only been playing for about month or so, he is a BEAST! I'm more of a ground and pound guy so when I get a good run game going and my opponent tries to stop the run, I switch it up to a streaking route. Nothing feels better than seeing Mike Wallace break away for a bomb to fall right in his arms for a TD. Gotta love that 99 speed. Hnnnng lol  Btw, I think I see you play Rocket League online every now and then. Hit me up and we'll play if you get bored of Madden."
MaddenUltimateTeam,3e3yev,cko026,2,Tue Jul 21 20:48:25 2015 UTC,"He really is a monster. For me, he seems to shake a lot of tackles after the catch."
MaddenUltimateTeam,3e3yev,T3lue,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:40:05 2015 UTC,"I never really had too many higher end players but I enjoyed everyone I did play with. Recently, though, I have been experimenting with budget 90+ running backs. For a cheap, 90ovr HB, I had a ton of fun with Roy helu jr.  He played like a 95+. He didn't have the best speed, but he made up for it in yards after contact. His stiff arm was fun to use. Most of the time he would give the arm and then body slam the guy. His trucking was great for extra yardage. Very very fun to play with on a budget.   Up now for a budget back is Ridley."
MaddenUltimateTeam,3e3yev,Llcoolaj,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:49:08 2015 UTC,"I've used the Ridley, and he's pretty good...like 99 TRK I think but only like 88 carrying...better not let him get tired!"
MaddenUltimateTeam,3e3yev,Llcoolaj,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:52:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I have noticed he swaps out a lot for the backup. I don't remember once when helu swapped out for backup. But Ridley had been good so far. No fumbles and had also done very well catching passes."
MaddenUltimateTeam,3e3yev,jhale92,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:50:51 2015 UTC,I highly suggest 94 Ingram. High acceleration and 98 trucking. He's short to do he has that really quick agility like sproles. He's a truck man.
MaddenUltimateTeam,3e3yev,drcobb40,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:13:28 2015 UTC,Ridley's a beast. I pulled him during my pack suicide chasing Bo and ended up keeping him because of how low his value is.

MaddenUltimateTeam,3e3yev,JackFX,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:56:13 2015 UTC,I'm late to the party. My favorite player was CJ Mosley MUT wise because he was a deadly combo of speed and catching. His animations just helped him catch everything in the vicinity. However in real life my favorite player was Jay Cutler. That dude is a character but I do enjoy watching him as a player and what everyone doesn't understand is that he's above average but he does however throw a lot of picks

I haven't used him on PS4 yet since I just moved up from X360 but he was pretty good, even if he moved at the speed of a snail. Really fun to just run up the middle and somehow break free. People don't seem to like him though, haha."

PH Dez had 98 speed and Julio is much faster. Dez ran a 4.5 and Julio ran a 4.37 on a fractured foot! I was so disappointed with that card."
MaddenUltimateTeam,3e567z,dont_make_cents,3,Wed Jul 22 01:42:26 2015 UTC,Definently 97 Marshawn Lynch. Dude wasn't even a hard runner

MaddenUltimateTeam,3e567z,Potated,3,Wed Jul 22 01:22:49 2015 UTC,Easy! 99 Jared Allen! 105 pmv should be on that QB every other play. Barely does better than 98 Von... Scratch that Von is better.
MaddenUltimateTeam,3e567z,DIEGOMORA,2,Wed Jul 22 01:24:16 2015 UTC,"I agree. With those stats. I expected him to get passed the opponents 85-90 linemen within a few seconds. Don't get me wrong, he makes plays sometimes, but I had better success with flashback peppers"

MaddenUltimateTeam,3e567z,qpx,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:09:23 2015 UTC,He's the same way for me. The only reason I still have him is because he forced a fumble at the one yard line that sent me to the Super Bowl.

MaddenUltimateTeam,3e567z,hugbug92,2,Wed Jul 22 02:35:13 2015 UTC,99 CJ2K. He can't do anything but run straight. A 95 o - line won't cut it with him.
MaddenUltimateTeam,3e567z,Whalenesss,2,Wed Jul 22 01:42:22 2015 UTC,"Felt like PH Bell's stats were a little crappy for the way he played last year. Still a good card, but he had the second most yards from scrimmage last year. Maybe the worst 99 RB of MUT."

His release feels slow, and he can fumble by getting tapped. He does have good accuracy, but it doesn't feel like the amazing stats that the card shows. The biggest letdown though is his throw on the run. In real life he is amazing at that, probably only being beat out by Rodgers. Not in Madden though."

MaddenUltimateTeam,3e55b5,owned_at_worms,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:42:26 2015 UTC,He'd be good. If you are looking for a budget guy to do it with get the 94 ovr Emmitt or the 91 overall MJD. They will both mash it up pretty good.
MaddenUltimateTeam,3e55b5,Joshvapes,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:45:05 2015 UTC,Okay. I'll probably pick them both up before I get deangelo and see how it goes. Thanks Worms!
MaddenUltimateTeam,3e55b5,Joshvapes,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:46:34 2015 UTC,"I'd go Jamaal Charles man. That 94 overall that he was given is bullshit. He's at least a 97 overall in my mind. I wouldn't go as far as saying he's a 99 because his trucking is like a 74, but you're not getting him to be a power back. You're getting him for that lights out homerun speed which he definitely has"
MaddenUltimateTeam,3e55b5,Joshvapes,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:55:13 2015 UTC,"Hmmm... You're making it harder for me lol. I love Jamaal. Haven't used his 94. Not gonna lie though, that 74 trucking scared me off."
MaddenUltimateTeam,3e55b5,I_Am_Hank_Hill_AMA,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:59:40 2015 UTC,"I definitely understand. I paired him up with AR Hill for those close 3rd downs. I believe his stamina is 94 though. That's excellent considering his speed, accel, and price. He also has very nice catching for a HB"
MaddenUltimateTeam,3e54db,KehJay,5,Wed Jul 22 00:58:22 2015 UTC,"Before the season, pick who you think the leaders will be for rushing, receiving, tackles, passing, and whatever else. If you get it right, you can add that collectible and however many coins to get a 99 overall version of that player. They should be rare enough that they can be really good, and it would add another incentive to play early. Also, gives hope to people throughout the year that they'll get a great version of their favorite players."
MaddenUltimateTeam,3e54db,somesevenyearold,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:09:37 2015 UTC,Do you think these players should be auctionable when they are obtained?
MaddenUltimateTeam,3e54db,somesevenyearold,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:11:07 2015 UTC,"Yes. Collectibles should also be actionable and tradeable throughout the season, allowing people to capitalize and take risks if a great plater has a bad week or a bad player has a great week.   Maybe it should be the leading player of those collectibles offered, because there's always a small chance an undrafted receiver gets a billion yards."

MaddenUltimateTeam,3e54db,RuffWater,2,Wed Jul 22 02:13:38 2015 UTC,"I'll say what I always say: famous player groups. For example, putting in 60 Cowboys gold and silver and elite cards gets you Aikman Emmit Irvin. For the Guants it would be LT Harry Carson and Carl Banks."

MaddenUltimateTeam,3e3xtf,UltimateTeam,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:48:03 2015 UTC,Base Deangelo Williams and base Chris ivory. I think those are the only two I have left now
MaddenUltimateTeam,3e3xtf,Finklewink,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:08:37 2015 UTC,I will be on the lookout and if I find them there yours
MaddenUltimateTeam,3e3xtf,UltimateTeam,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:09:21 2015 UTC,Thanks man! I appreciate it. Hard because everyone's pricing ridiculous. Jonathan Stewart cost me 28 thousand yesterday....

MaddenUltimateTeam,3e3xtf,UltimateTeam,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:15:38 2015 UTC,I sold most of my studs though so I have like 500k for these last two haha
MaddenUltimateTeam,3e3xtf,Finklewink,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:20:14 2015 UTC,Yeah good luck finding them. Neither up right now
MaddenUltimateTeam,3e3xtf,UltimateTeam,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:21:11 2015 UTC,Thinking about selling my whole team and pulling pro packs till I pull them lol
MaddenUltimateTeam,3e3xtf,Finklewink,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:30:35 2015 UTC,Not much to pull is the problem
MaddenUltimateTeam,3e3xtf,UltimateTeam,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:40:18 2015 UTC,"And thanks man! Sold off Michael Vick, my offensive line, bo Jackson and Deion to try and get this done before the next madden comes out. I'm like 3/4 ways done with the solos too. But that parts the easy part"
MaddenUltimateTeam,3e3xtf,Finklewink,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:09:44 2015 UTC,"I'm right there with ya, waited too late to start. But as God as my witness, im going to finish that mother fcker"
MaddenUltimateTeam,3e3xtf,Llcoolaj,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:13:02 2015 UTC,That's what I'm saying lol just bought a 60 pro pack bundle with coins and no luck
MaddenUltimateTeam,3e3xtf,Finklewink,2,Tue Jul 21 23:52:23 2015 UTC,im right there with you. I need two more gold players to finish the Dolphins MVP set and they haven't been anywhere and the only one I can find is 250 k in the AH
MaddenUltimateTeam,3e3xtf,Sponky92,2,Tue Jul 21 19:44:10 2015 UTC,What cards are they?
MaddenUltimateTeam,3e3xtf,Justanotherjustin,2,Tue Jul 21 20:03:47 2015 UTC,"RTTP Joe Berger (RG Vikings) Base Gold Zane Beadles (RG Jags)  I know Beadles is rare, and I'd honestly trade a relevant, usable card for him, or spend 50-100K, but there's literally none on either blocks."
MaddenUltimateTeam,3e3xtf,Matthew3358,2,Tue Jul 21 20:14:43 2015 UTC,yeah thats why you gotta finish them earlier if you can.
MaddenUltimateTeam,3e3xtf,Llcoolaj,2,Tue Jul 21 20:21:20 2015 UTC,"I wasn't planning on doing the RG PH set, but I had so many of the common golds for it, I figured why not. Should've done my research prior to starting it though."
MaddenUltimateTeam,3e3xtf,TangerineDiesel,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:23:30 2015 UTC,Base Gold Zane Beadles    might as well be a unicorn

MaddenUltimateTeam,3e3xtf,Mccgarringer,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:12:14 2015 UTC,I feel your pain.  I've been searching for a few missing UT cards like the 2nd James Harrison and Jack splat nickname since Saturday and nothing.
MaddenUltimateTeam,3e3xtf,DurantTheGOAT,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:02:49 2015 UTC,Yea I just got some QB's but I need 2 more to finish it

MaddenUltimateTeam,3e588k,Itwasaverygooday,2,Wed Jul 22 01:30:25 2015 UTC,Trae Waynes or Cromartie or milliner
MaddenUltimateTeam,3e588k,UltimateTeam,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:44:41 2015 UTC,Second Trae Waynes.  Looking to upgrade to 94 Cro soon from Perrish Cox.  Need someone who can stop 4oJ VJax.
MaddenUltimateTeam,3e588k,please_waste_my_time,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:59:20 2015 UTC,"Get rid of Trent Cole. He doesn't belong in a 4-3. I'd suggest 95 Bruce Carter.  Who do you user? That can help me make more suggestions. You should also upgrade your tackles on offence. Also, what's your budget?  Edit: one thing I didn't notice. Redding doesn't belong in a 4-3 either, get a Von Miller (team of the year, CW), or maybe CW Clowney at RE and move McPhee over to the left."
MaddenUltimateTeam,3e588k,Iknowwhereyoualllive,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:35:36 2015 UTC,I user davis
MaddenUltimateTeam,3e588k,Iknowwhereyoualllive,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:39:21 2015 UTC,"I'd get someone else in that case. Harris is fairly slow, has bad agility, and horrible jump. Get AR CJ Mosley.  Also if you have the coins I'd suggest 97 Atwater for FS."
MaddenUltimateTeam,3e588k,dont_make_cents,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:44:28 2015 UTC,"AR Mosley changed my defense when I got him. He's great to user or you can let him be. His high zone, catching, and CIT make him a pick machine. He's also solid against the run."
MaddenUltimateTeam,3e588k,Iknowwhereyoualllive,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:02:36 2015 UTC,"I don't have him, but I'm about to buy him when my stuff all sells. It would be either him or Shazier."
MaddenUltimateTeam,3e588k,dont_make_cents,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:04:38 2015 UTC,Can't say enough good things about Mosley.
MaddenUltimateTeam,3e588k,KehJay,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:29:54 2015 UTC,I've had both CJ and Shazier and I felt like CJ played a lot better for me
MaddenUltimateTeam,3e588k,Joshvapes,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:18:48 2015 UTC,CW Miller is a beast. I'd also consider CW Bucannon for SS. He is God
MaddenUltimateTeam,3e588k,Iknowwhereyoualllive,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:41:19 2015 UTC,"I've never actually used Miller. I should get him as I currently have 95 Mario Williams who isn't that amazing, but I guess he gets the job done.  Also, I don't see much of Bucanon on the field, but I'm not sure that's a bad thing, he just doesn't really make any plays."
MaddenUltimateTeam,3e588k,Joshvapes,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:46:21 2015 UTC,"Oh, he does for me. He always has interceptions and he breaks up passes and everything, but I hear where you're coming from"
MaddenUltimateTeam,3e588k,Iknowwhereyoualllive,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:49:01 2015 UTC,"It's probably because I have 4OJ Lott at FS, and I mostly get beat on shorter stuff and never deep."
MaddenUltimateTeam,3e50lm,BubetisLife,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:27:59 2015 UTC,Link to your team would help :)
MaddenUltimateTeam,3e50lm,KehJay,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:55:32 2015 UTC,Just know I'm a 92 overall highest card is 95 dumervil not looking to upgrade team just doing the gauntlet for that one player everyone thinks I should have. Just wanna hear some opinions
MaddenUltimateTeam,3e50lm,KehJay,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:58:00 2015 UTC,One player that is crazy good : UL Barry.
MaddenUltimateTeam,3e50lm,KehJay,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:01:18 2015 UTC,I've had 97 faulk which is my favorite player of all time. I really wanna try the 99 faulk out tho
MaddenUltimateTeam,3e50lm,S2klvr,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:11:09 2015 UTC,Is there a 99? I thought there was only a 98?
MaddenUltimateTeam,3e2b71,Authoritis,2,Tue Jul 21 12:21:11 2015 UTC,I had Jared Allen in at HB/TE in my 99 overall because no backups got some 50+ yard rushing games longest rush was 32 yards.
MaddenUltimateTeam,3e2b71,UltimateTeam,5,Tue Jul 21 12:54:05 2015 UTC,"I used to always have Style Peyton go in as the nickel back and he would just start the play exactly where he needed to be and wait. Every once in a while, he'd get an interception or something, but more often than not he was getting destroyed by a running back or something. Still fun to watch, though."
MaddenUltimateTeam,3e2b71,somesevenyearold,3,Tue Jul 21 13:11:07 2015 UTC,"Peyton can read the defense, but can he read the opposing offense is the question!"
MaddenUltimateTeam,3e2b71,UltimateTeam,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:17:16 2015 UTC,"I should probably get him a back up on offense because  he definitely gets worn out. He's been my favorite out of position player yet, Mosley at TE is fun too."
MaddenUltimateTeam,3e2b71,ak360,2,Tue Jul 21 13:22:23 2015 UTC,So how do you do this? Just make sure there is no backup mlb and run the 3-4? I have boss Bo and I'm very interested in trying this out.
MaddenUltimateTeam,3e2b71,LetsTalkMarkets,2,Tue Jul 21 15:59:33 2015 UTC,It's completely random (I think) based on all your 99ovr players that aren't on the field.
MaddenUltimateTeam,3e2b71,LetsTalkMarkets,2,Tue Jul 21 16:11:51 2015 UTC,I definitely get it to happen on purpose now. He only leaves the field when I switch packages or formations. He's in on nickel downs too.
MaddenUltimateTeam,3e2b71,LetsTalkMarkets,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:35:58 2015 UTC,"I meant random in the sense that it is one of your best players on the field (once determined, it never changes). It defaults to  your best 99 ovr player so it is 4OJ Fits/Vjax/RG3 for most people I bet"
MaddenUltimateTeam,3e2b71,Bizzlebomb,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:55:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah absolutely, happened to me with Kaep and Winston a lot earlier in the year.  So I was only partially surprised, but damn! This has been a blast. Why didn't I know this months ago, would have done it then."
MaddenUltimateTeam,3e35gl,Iknowwhereyoualllive,7,Tue Jul 21 16:29:04 2015 UTC,I think you just need to turn your tv right side up and you should be fine...
MaddenUltimateTeam,3e35gl,rthaw,2,Tue Jul 21 17:06:52 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I had my phone vertical but for some reason it took the picture horizontally."
MaddenUltimateTeam,3e35gl,Teajam,3,Tue Jul 21 17:32:00 2015 UTC,Looks like the game froze but the console didn't.
MaddenUltimateTeam,3e35gl,Matthew3358,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:54:50 2015 UTC,"He didn't even pause the game, but I picked my play on 4th and it just froze like this. The camera isn't flying around the stadium, it's just stuck on that.  Also, my phone took the picture sideways for some reason. Sorry about that."
MaddenUltimateTeam,3e35gl,yoitsmedannyp,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:29:43 2015 UTC,"if it is just continuing the stadium cinematics and the clock is stuck, yes."
MaddenUltimateTeam,3e35gl,oCaLLMeSkiLLz,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:30:13 2015 UTC,"Screen's just frozen. It isn't even doing the stadium cinematics, but the clock is stuck. I can exit to the Xbox home, so my console didn't freeze."
MaddenUltimateTeam,3e4rbj,geohul,5,Tue Jul 21 23:12:45 2015 UTC,That's rough man sorry to hear it but ya never go first on 2 for 1 unless you have a trusted middle man or they go first
MaddenUltimateTeam,3e4rbj,sicilianbadguy,5,Tue Jul 21 23:17:17 2015 UTC,"Lmao you actually went through with giving a dude 700k, then thought he'd actually trade Mariota for NTL?  The MUT guy can't help you, you just bought an auction for 698k, the other guy didn't make you. Can't really have sympathy for you."
MaddenUltimateTeam,3e4rbj,Kerk_Ern_Berls,4,Tue Jul 21 23:18:54 2015 UTC,Honestly there's like 2 weeks left in the game and I was like fuck it.  I'm moving to ps4 for 16 abd just was tired of waiting for a NTL to go up for Auction. Didn't think anybody would find it worthy of their time to fuck me over.  Forgot that this game is comprised of mostly dickheads.
MaddenUltimateTeam,3e4rbj,JackFX,2,Tue Jul 21 23:27:41 2015 UTC,"i mean id give you an hour of my time for 700k, you came to him with the deal; am i wrong?"
MaddenUltimateTeam,3e4rbj,KehJay,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:37:03 2015 UTC,Your are right.  He was asking 850.  I offered 698 plus Marriotta.  Put Mariotta up for trade.  He wanted me to go first.  I said I would.  He asked if I'd rather him put him up on the AH for 698 or a uniform.  I said uni because I didn't want him to get screwed and me to miss NTL.    Ha.  Jokes on me.  It was stupid but at least I have pics of our messages and his name.  It's Kaleb Nicholson.  If any of you on 360 are bored please inundate him with messages and make him do the right thing.  My Marriotta card is still up for trade amd I'm willing to let bygones be bygones if he follows through.
MaddenUltimateTeam,3e4rap,jdiditok,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:12:33 2015 UTC,UL RE PEPPERS at OLB is amazing. Thats is all.
MaddenUltimateTeam,3e4rap,DC4realz,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:17:17 2015 UTC,Here's a neat trick. Put Ut peppers at lolb and when using dime formation do the lolb package. It puts peppers at MLB :)
MaddenUltimateTeam,3e4rap,UltimateTeam,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:10:05 2015 UTC,Peppers and CW Von and if MLB Clay Matthews can pass rush.

MaddenUltimateTeam,3e4rap,ntslade,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:18:35 2015 UTC,It is a 43 and I thought the lolb peppers was the FO edition which I am not going to get lol. I have the ut peppers at lolb already. I have the 4OJ MLB at MLB and Ham at rolb. Go Ravens
MaddenUltimateTeam,3e4njs,Toad930,2,Tue Jul 21 22:43:43 2015 UTC,Man up the wheel and streak and then user the breaking in route.
MaddenUltimateTeam,3e4njs,UltimateTeam,2,Tue Jul 21 22:52:00 2015 UTC,man I am never fast enough to set up the defensive pre-snap adjustments.  Guess it's just practice and becomes 2nd nature.

MaddenUltimateTeam,3e3jym,modrewgnu,8,Tue Jul 21 18:07:08 2015 UTC,Usually the rating in Madden aren't the same in MUT right?
MaddenUltimateTeam,3e3jym,qman99,5,Tue Jul 21 18:12:01 2015 UTC,Yah these are not MUT ratings. Last year AP was the highest overall running back at 98 overall and his base elite was 90 overall in MUT.
MaddenUltimateTeam,3e3jym,seakucumber,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:15:23 2015 UTC,These wont be their mut ratings
MaddenUltimateTeam,3e3jym,UltimateTeam,4,Tue Jul 21 18:30:29 2015 UTC,Seems like they all have pretty low speed. Is this normal for regular Madden ratings?
MaddenUltimateTeam,3e3jym,DontTestTheUser,3,Tue Jul 21 18:40:21 2015 UTC,"Having Jamaal at 92 speed seems crazy low, but maybe they're actually going to have a meaningful stat system again, where 99s and 98s are much less common. That'd be cool."
MaddenUltimateTeam,3e3jym,somesevenyearold,4,Tue Jul 21 18:44:32 2015 UTC,Doubt it since they gave Vic Beasley and Mariota like 88 speed.
MaddenUltimateTeam,3e3jym,TheVetNoob,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:57:11 2015 UTC,"I noticed that too, last year AP had 97 speed now he is down to 90."
MaddenUltimateTeam,3e3jym,seakucumber,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:46:55 2015 UTC,"Seems like they kept everything the same but brought down speed for everyone, ex. Lynch has 98 trucking but 85 speed. Obviously Lynch is a power back but it shouldn't be that polarizing."
MaddenUltimateTeam,3e3jym,DontTestTheUser,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:49:31 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind their speeds might not be really high, however in normal mode anything over 87-88 with high acceleration is enough to take it the distance... In regular there wont be 7 plus defenders as fast as your RB."
MaddenUltimateTeam,3e3jym,akaCDub03,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:25:36 2015 UTC,Is this normal? Players to have this high of a rating at launch? do these ratings translate to mut? Game is getting cheesier every year
MaddenUltimateTeam,3e3jym,yoitsmedannyp,3,Tue Jul 21 18:13:19 2015 UTC,No these are not MUT ratings. Last year AP was the highest overall running back at 98 overall and his base elite was 90 overall in MUT.

MaddenUltimateTeam,3e490a,NovexD,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:24:43 2015 UTC,Have you checked out the info on mut manager.  Someone wrote up a nice cheat sheet on making styles without needing style coaches. Rising stars was my trick.  Also double the player so that you can use him multiple times to the fullest.  Mixing styles is a poor choice.
MaddenUltimateTeam,3e490a,NovexD,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:53:41 2015 UTC,"That's what I was going to do, but I should make them just one style so I can use them twice, I suppose. Sucks you can't auction the Rising Stars once you've made them, but at least RS cards are relatively cheap, because I only have 14,000 coins after buying UL Atwater yesterday. It'll be worth it because you either get ET3 or another guy that I can't remember."

MaddenUltimateTeam,3e46kt,Llcoolaj,2,Tue Jul 21 22:26:11 2015 UTC,I'm going to put it simply. Aaron Rodgers can't stay healthy all the time and the Bears are just going to whoop everyone's ass
MaddenUltimateTeam,3e3xab,ccpr53,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:37:25 2015 UTC,"Great video man I agree with pretty much everything you mentioned. I thought there were some great additions to MUT 15 like making cards from sets easily searchable, and binder organization, but many things like pointless sets sucked. As someone who has been playing MUT since 12, I still can't believe multi card trading isn't going to be an option yet again. I've never been scammed, mainly because I'm almost 30 and know better to trust random people, but I'm really surprised to see this wouldn't be included."

MaddenUltimateTeam,3e3xab,chaymoney86,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:16:12 2015 UTC,Great video. What I would like them to do is make 2 binders. One is your normal 1200 card binder. Another would be more like a set. Its a binder where you can add one of each and every single card that was made through out the year. I think that would help from kicking your self in the ass when you quick sell one of those cards that belong to a set later down the road.

MaddenUltimateTeam,3e3tj6,owned_at_worms,4,Tue Jul 21 19:16:59 2015 UTC,"Yes, it does matter. You know why? Because if you drop 11 back into coverage on 360 or ps3 you can still somewhat contain the run. But if you are on ps4 or xb1 and drop 9, 10 or 11 guys into coverage and the offense calls a run play, all of your defenders will get pancake blocked and it will be an easy touchdown. So in a situation that you described, I would try at least 1 run play if I felt like they were rushing less than 3 guys.  Some people I fuckin' swear..."

As far as Luck goes, I haven't used him yet but from what I've seen and heard he's awesome except for his slow release. If you want a QB with similar speed and accuracy Honors Rodgers has just slightly worse stats and is a little more expensive, but I remember him having pinpoint accuracy and a pretty fast release. I would also recommend trying out CW Kaep, he has way better accuracy than his stats say and at 45k he's a steal for a dual threat QB."

MaddenUltimateTeam,3e1c8n,Joshvapes,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:32:04 2015 UTC,"More love for Tebow, that card is so good. I teased it a long time ago but this weekend hopefully ill have my Tebow highlight video ready.  The card is the most broken thing I've ever used in 3 years of MUT, and his high awareness makes his passing stats moot. He threads the needle and pulls off All of the Bullshit throws, after shaking off a DE and a LB."
MaddenUltimateTeam,3e1c8n,Joshvapes,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:32:37 2015 UTC,"For real man, I did a video review of him and it only took me a couple games to get enough highlights to fill the 5 min of audio. He just makes plays"
MaddenUltimateTeam,3e1c8n,yoitsmedannyp,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:31:03 2015 UTC,"Surprised you didn't mention 4OJ RG3. I know he's a little expensive now, but I got him weeks ago for 92k and I have absolutely no regrets. I'm considering trying out FB Peyton just because the hype is unreal, but I don't think it's a move I can do. I can't go from someone with the incredible speed and accel of RG3 to Peyton. I will say though, the style Peyton was so damn good, so I can only imaging how insane FB Peyton is"
MaddenUltimateTeam,3e1c8n,Pestilence_XIV,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:23:27 2015 UTC,"When 4oJ RGIII came out I was so hyped to try him out. But instead I ended up grabbing a CW Kaep for 40k while everyone was trying to load him off. After 4oJ RGIII was released practically every opponent I played(and a lot of people still playing now) used him and I noticed he was overthrowing a lot of passes which is why I've decided to hold off on him. Don't get me wrong, I've been wrecked by people using him and he is definitely a top tier dual threat, but I've seen too many bad throws from him for me to consider switching from Russ or Manning. Maybe I'll try him if I can get a good deal, but for now I'll stick with what I've got."
MaddenUltimateTeam,3e1c8n,theathleticjew,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:28:21 2015 UTC,"Yea that's how I feel with FB Peyton. RG3 is excellent for me. I think the problem is that people use him as a pocket passer and they overuse him, when in reality he's best when he has 10-15 throws a game. I've won so many games with him throwing less than 15 passes a game and my QBR has been between 120-155. When used correctly, he's definitely one of the most lethal QBs in the game"

MaddenUltimateTeam,3e0a4x,bobloblaw101780,0,Tue Jul 21 22:38:33 2015 UTC,"Indeed. But the problem is that you're confusing the number of sales with the scarcity of the card.   What he is saying is that the card isn't as rare as the sales indicate; its just that a lot of people have quit the game so the card is likely in binders or was quick sold.   I showed you examples of sales where the person had no idea the value of the card. Mostly to give you hope that someone will sell it to you for cheap, just keep looking."

MaddenUltimateTeam,3e0hom,TheCard,3,Tue Jul 21 00:36:59 2015 UTC,I might try some of these since my offense is trash most of the Time :(
MaddenUltimateTeam,3e0hom,UltimateTeam,3,Tue Jul 21 00:41:37 2015 UTC,"Same here. Some cool stuff I haven't ever thought of. It's never occurred to me to switch which side I run to based on man or zone coverage. I always just count the players in the box and see if theyre loaded in one way or the other. This is a new concept to me, and I'm eager to try it out."
MaddenUltimateTeam,3e0hom,Tomservo5447,2,Tue Jul 21 01:53:17 2015 UTC,Flipping strong power in trips based on the defense is nearly unstoppable most of the time.
MaddenUltimateTeam,3e0hom,dont_make_cents,3,Tue Jul 21 03:12:44 2015 UTC,"also from the Broncos playbook...  Singleback Jumbo  PA Y Corner   Hot routes: R1 on an out route. Optionally, circle on a streak. The streak should clear out the deep DB and then you have 3 receivers flooding the right mid side of the field.   PA Misdirection   Hot routes: Triangle (or whatever's the HB) on a streak.  This keeps the auto-motion but removes the play action. Funky times  ensue.   Singleback Deuce  PA Broncos Post   Hot routes: Triangle on a curl. Roll out to the left. The  triangle receiver creates a nice screen for the slanting X receiver. Has potential for an easy 10 yard QB scramble. The square receiver also runs a killer comeback in this play and even if you're throwing on the run, the pass to square is very hard to pick off, so worst case it's an incompletion.   Pistol Ace Twins  Slot Under   No hot routes, just a solid play. This is the play /u/owned_at_worms used to win one of his streamed games in the final seconds,  hitting the X receiver who's on a streak.   Gun Bunch Wk  Close Mesh   Hot routes: Triangle on a streak. Square on a streak. R1 on a drag. Optionally, circle  on a streak or fade. You can go 2 ways with this. The first approach is rolling out to the left, where you'll have 2 receivers running drags. If the user comes down to defend these, very often the streaking HB (triangle) will be open for a 20-40 yard gain. Just make sure to pass to triangle before the deep DB can make a jump on the ball (remember he's busy with the streaking square receiver). Other approach: Don't roll out at all (or fake roll out) and try it deep to square, especially if your opponent has brought down the deep left DB closer to the LOS.   Gun Empty Slot (?)  Dbl Slot Unders   Just a nice passing play, especially against Cover 2 defenses.   If I think of anything else  I'm going to add it here, because I should write this down so I don't forget lol."
MaddenUltimateTeam,3e0hom,blaine64,2,Tue Jul 21 02:04:59 2015 UTC,Thanks! Going to give these a try man
MaddenUltimateTeam,3e0hom,dont_make_cents,2,Tue Jul 21 03:13:20 2015 UTC,"I was only able to play a couple games earlier but will be jumping on here shortly. I'll let you know how it goes.

MaddenUltimateTeam,3dytna,LordOfThenn,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:29:37 2015 UTC,"Lacy will always fall forward, and he's just a bulldozer. His speed is perfect. He's not too fast to the point where he'll run into his blockers. If you see an opening in the line he's pretty good at being able to hit it. What I've noticed with all the speed backs is that they always run into the line before anything opens up, but Lacy is just ""slow"" enough (for lack of a better word) for your line to develop.   As for CW Johnson. He's just my fun back for when i get bored. I love running counters and the occasional screen with him. He's fragile, so he's only good for 2 maybe three plays at a time. He's speed is just stupid though haha he's fun for whenever you get bored of any other back."
MaddenUltimateTeam,3dytna,njhorn,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:46:57 2015 UTC,"Lacy is the perfect back. He has 99 acceleration and 95 speed, which is a great combo for hitting the holes. His trucking is unreal of course at 101. Carry is 100. The thing that really makes him special is his 99 spin move, which is a perfect combo to his trucking."
MaddenUltimateTeam,3e0ji7,Matthew3358,4,Tue Jul 21 00:52:02 2015 UTC,It's cheese. It doesn't emulate real life football and the people who defend it are the people who couldn't win without it.

MaddenUltimateTeam,3e0ji7,the_wop,5,Tue Jul 21 00:59:14 2015 UTC,in 05 if you formation shifted over and over it drained all the energy from the defense. So you could literally run around the defense with carson palmer and never get caught. lol.

MaddenUltimateTeam,3e0ji7,UltimateTeam,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:03:04 2015 UTC,I agree with this.
MaddenUltimateTeam,3e0ji7,Politipals,3,Tue Jul 21 03:24:37 2015 UTC,"That depends. In a perfect world I would hope that no one does these things and I wouldn't do them. But competitive gaming is no where near perfect most top players and H2H players I face will do anything to win. If I am playing normal H2H I see the same stuff 90% of the time. PAEA Strong Power Counter and Cover 3 every down on defense. even when I win it gets old fast. Then when you throw face catch and nanos into the mix I really just don't enjoy it too much. Is there anything I can do about it? No, so if they start with nanos or FC I can hit em back and block them and do my best.  I am never going to start the bug abuse fest but I can hang in there most of the time. If that's how you play I am not gonna give you to many props that's just me. Not my Favorite style of play."
MaddenUltimateTeam,3e0ji7,cush2push,2,Tue Jul 21 00:58:46 2015 UTC,nah i dont want to run PAEA. i want to try to run a legit scheme but if i play a nanoer ill nano right back and same with facecatching. thats what im going to try to do.

MaddenUltimateTeam,3e0ji7,SHanKeRSauRx,3,Tue Jul 21 01:03:44 2015 UTC,"I get that it's a game and that anything that can technically be stopped should be fair, but what's the fun in playing a game where you know exactly what your opponent's going to do every play. When people facecatch and do nothing but run PAEA, Y trail, & strong power on offense the game becomes less about strategy which ruins it for me. If some guy runs a facecatch play 3 times without it working, but then gets 1 facecatch for 80 yds I get pissed. I like adjusting to someone's scheme, going against different unknown plays and learning from each game. If I go up against the same 3 plays every game player after player it gets boring. Furthermore, when someone runs nanos against me and I have to send literally everyone to block because of a flaw in the blocking AI of linemen it means my playbook is severely limited which sucks because then I'm forced to run the same plays over and over. In the end, nobody becomes a better player, one just gets a meaningless W."
MaddenUltimateTeam,3e0ji7,sportsgamerpat,2,Tue Jul 21 03:38:47 2015 UTC,I have always face caught since Madden 95. Never thought of it as a glitch.
MaddenUltimateTeam,3e0ji7,sportsgamerpat,2,Tue Jul 21 01:38:01 2015 UTC,"In order to make it at the top of the leader boards, you will have to not only learn how to stop the cheese, but you'll also have to cheese. All of the top 100 players use exploits and aren't ashamed of it.   You just aren't good enough to beat ProblemWright, Animosity_XL, DomePiece (who didn't play much Madden this year), etc. by playing sim style. The reason something is cheesey is because it's easy for them to run compared to how difficult it is for you to stop.   Think about Pistol Bunch TE. It took more than half of the madden season for anyone to figure out how to consistently stop it. I don't think Madden really announces its patches, but I feel like it got patched rather than anyone actually lock it down. Or think about PAEA, I also think it got patched rather than defenses working against it.  This will be even more true when you have 80 awr / 80 prc players for the first half of the madden season. You can call the perfect defense and still have them dice you up.   I personally stopped trying to consider myself elite and focused more on having fun rather than thinking I have to win 80% of my games. The latter was too stressful and took the joy out of it for me. But I'm also just not that great as it is.   My goal next year is to build the team I like, run a unique scheme, and spend no additional money. But everybody is different. You might dig the cat-and-mouse game of coming up with the OP stuff and trying to stop the OP stuff. One thing I can guarantee is that the Problem Wrights and Sirus the Virus's of the world probably ""lab"" 3x more than they play. To get to the top elite, IMO, you'll have to lab up your own stuff rather than riff off of what's common."

MaddenUltimateTeam,3dyx3y,UltimateTeam,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:44:00 2015 UTC,I've been trying to grab AR Woodson for about 3 days now. He's been up for 450 but fair price according to mutmanager is around 375. I'll message people asking to pay 375 and they think I'm a moron lol

MaddenUltimateTeam,3dyx3y,mrnegley,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:17:02 2015 UTC,Might actually be cheaper to make him.  Make a quick spreadsheet and price out the components and then look for little snipes
MaddenUltimateTeam,3dyx3y,qpx,2,Mon Jul 20 17:49:14 2015 UTC,Yeah I'll take a look today and see what I can manage lol. Just wanna use him before everyone jumps to mut 16

MaddenUltimateTeam,3dyx3y,mrnegley,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:00:16 2015 UTC,Yeah there's some days where prices are low and some average and then some high. It's good for snipes though

MaddenUltimateTeam,3e0lm7,nuthinbutsmooth,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:08:48 2015 UTC,Fun idea but it is a little easier to just have a 93-95 overall team and still be able to hang with the best teams and not necessarily have ballets at every position but not be exposed to super high rated teams. I have like 210$ worth of coins in players really wish I could dump it all but I don't have any way to do that so I will just hang with them and give it away once i reach my breaking point.
MaddenUltimateTeam,3e0lm7,UltimateTeam,3,Tue Jul 21 01:13:31 2015 UTC,"That's fair enough man. I completely understand which is why with friends it would be better, but at the same time the ridiculous 99ovr teams you will still face will probably be too rough. I'm hoping madden 16 with that draft day mode is something like this, where not all the players are so overpowered."
MaddenUltimateTeam,3e0lm7,UltimateTeam,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:19:40 2015 UTC,Yeah my friends and I do crazy FIFA challenges no one else would do. Yeah draft champions will be fun once it comes out check out /r/maddendraftchampions for organizing games if we can or draft Tips

Sell both your DTs and Get CW Poe and pickup another MLB UF Clay for budget or CW Shazier for more. Then Get AR Haha Clinton Dix he's a Stud. And when you get a chance upgrade Warmack to AR Martin

MaddenUltimateTeam,3dzf96,Teajam,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:56:20 2015 UTC,"Is it worth it to have Jack Ham in a 3-4 defense? I upgraded from AR Mack. Also, I just bought CW Mathieu because he was only 44k so I figured that was a solid price and I've heard good things"
MaddenUltimateTeam,3dzf96,Teajam,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:08:39 2015 UTC,Yeah he works well if you put him in coverage. I usually only rush the 3 down lineman and put everyone else in coverage. And he's great against the run.

MaddenUltimateTeam,3e03oi,Joshvapes,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:00:38 2015 UTC,SB Brady same short and mid Brady has better deep and throw power OP SB Brady is the answer
MaddenUltimateTeam,3e03oi,UltimateTeam,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:04:57 2015 UTC,Man I had him and he was good. But that Peyton looks fun and I heard his release is super quick.
MaddenUltimateTeam,3e03oi,TheBrickWahl,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:06:18 2015 UTC,Agreed. Currently using SB Brady and he is an amazing pocket passer. Probably cheaper than both of your options and I highly recommend him. If not I would choose FB Manning. His stats look better and both cards sit around the same price.
MaddenUltimateTeam,3e03oi,SHanKeRSauRx,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:08:27 2015 UTC,I never get fumbles... but when I do its from sacking brady lol
MaddenUltimateTeam,3e03oi,LongtimeLurkersacc,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:21:54 2015 UTC,If you want a really good pocket passer i'd get Marino. Out of those two though i'd go with FB peyton

MaddenUltimateTeam,3e03oi,expectantsneer,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:17:45 2015 UTC,Thanks. I'll probably buy him if I see one for 100k
MaddenUltimateTeam,3e03oi,Heightsman09,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:20:26 2015 UTC,FE Romo gives you enough scrambling when needed but he isn't like vick where you feel like you can out run the defense every play so it keeps you more disciplined.

MaddenUltimateTeam,3dz3dt,somesevenyearold,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:47:33 2015 UTC,I think it's a combo of play rec and awareness.
MaddenUltimateTeam,3dz3dt,Phillip_34,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:32:11 2015 UTC,Play rec is what leads players to jump routes know when it is a run or pass and not react against play action. You should strive to get higher play rec players if you can
MaddenUltimateTeam,3dz3dt,UltimateTeam,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:33:04 2015 UTC,Atwater gets beat over the top a lot with all the high 90 speed cards or if you face a stacked as fuck team.

MaddenUltimateTeam,3dyj36,Lobodomy88,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:08:51 2015 UTC,Yeah true but it's not even close to be worth 50 bucks.
MaddenUltimateTeam,3dyj36,retrowolves,0,Mon Jul 20 16:10:55 2015 UTC,so for 50 bucks you get maybe 100k if you pull the good final edition then lets say you get the lombardi pack thats 20k for the elite badge then like 20 for the elite maybe then if your lucky youll pull some elite badges and some more fe so if your really lucky maybe 400k
MaddenUltimateTeam,3dyj36,mjbland05,3,Mon Jul 20 16:20:27 2015 UTC,Im really surprised that they haven't dropped the price point on packs & bundles.  I plan to stay with 15 probably until 17 -i spend too much time on the ah too do this every year - and the prices seem crazy even in that context.

Only complaint was he didn't break a lot of tackles, everything else though he's great at. Good for counters, would fall forwards for extra yardage, and great for receiving out the back field.   UT Lynch severely underwhelmed for me. Always got caught in the backfield, couldn't catch well, and fumbled 3 times in a season for me. I'd go with Murray, haven't had experience with bell or Payton though"

MaddenUltimateTeam,3dyzzv,Chowder76,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:32:40 2015 UTC,"Yes, he always seems to break more tackles. I think it has something do with the fact he runs up-right and it almost seems kinda glitchy the way he breaks tackles some times. I'd also say he feels more like 96 speed and 98 acc rather then his normal stats"
MaddenUltimateTeam,3dyzzv,Chowder76,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:46:42 2015 UTC,I started late in the season and went with 97 lynch then onto ul lynch. I wasn't happy with his lack of catching on either so I moved on to honors Murray whom I was happy with until I sold him to make ul barry. I didn't like him too much for my style (run towards the defender ) so I sold him for legends Bo last week when his price crashed. Bo is the happiest I've been and has reignited my interest in the game. Hope this helps!
MaddenUltimateTeam,3dyzzv,ace_sanders,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:44:42 2015 UTC,"I actually had Bo for quite a long time and he's by far the best runningback in the game.. He is literally a game changer, has an impact no matter what. The only reason I sold him is because I wanted to try new people, I'm gonna narrow my choices to PH Bell and Murray because they seem to get the best reviews"

MaddenUltimateTeam,3dzef3,yoitsmedannyp,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:03:57 2015 UTC,"Don't press. In my experience, successful pressing causes the corner to always be too slow to turn around and get the ball, and unsuccessful pressing has them run past the WR when he turns around for the ball. This might just be a problem for me, but you never know.   Odd note: my slower corners get beat on curls and flats A LOT less."
MaddenUltimateTeam,3dzef3,somesevenyearold,2,Mon Jul 20 19:46:19 2015 UTC,"I tried not pressing too, but I get my ass kicked on those. Drives me crazy. Those are my weakness"
MaddenUltimateTeam,3dzef3,somesevenyearold,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:47:38 2015 UTC,"Putting your defensive ends or 3-4 outside linebackers into curl-to-flat zones can help, but it also weakens your pass rush. However, it will help against pocket-breakers and doesn't weaken your run game TOO much if your ends/olbs have play rec enough to pursue the run."
MaddenUltimateTeam,3dzef3,cdj5xc,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:50:45 2015 UTC,"If you are running Cover 3, then the curl-flat combination is specifically designed to beat it.  I'm pretty sure they're aren't any pre-play adjustments you can make to consistently defend it. If a particular opponent is frequently utilizing this play, the best thing to do is to mix in some deceptive Cover 1 defense (or even better, cover 1 blitz).   I find that opponents who throw a lot of curl routes aren't really making any reads, they just stare at their target and try to jam the ball in there as quickly as possible when he turns around."

MaddenUltimateTeam,3dxtzd,Authoritis,3,Mon Jul 20 12:38:04 2015 UTC,"The run game is one of my favorite parts of Madden. I don't know how much I average or if I am even that good but i will throw some tips. Make sure to change up the run. My friend used to run the same 3 run plays and be surprised when he would continue to get stopped for negative yards. When i mean diversify, I mean a total change up. End around's, between the guards, between the tackles, outside the tackles, weak side, strong side, draw, counters,  pitches, etc. Make sure to really change it up and dont spam the same type of run. Bo can do all of those so just make sure to try it all. I noticed that I have had less big runs, but more consistent 5-8 yard gains. Take what you get. Lastly, know when to incorporate the pass and utilize it to set up the run. With the chiefs play book you can capitalize on the short passes to set up a decent run game. Targeting outside routes(curls, comebacks, outs) can help open up the middle of the field for the draw. I pretty much just run so many different types of runs that my opponent doesn't usually guess correctly. Also if you can utilize a FB. Those guys can really help get the block on the hole to break off a 20+ yarder."

I only play sim type ball and MUT and usually most do as well, but every now and then you get guys using plays that exploit the ai and you just gotta adjust the best you can.  Most of those guys only practice offense and you can score at will on them with a ground and pound based offense, the trick is getting them into a turnover."

MaddenUltimateTeam,3dwc2j,ActionBasedSon,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:40:20 2015 UTC,Not at all. The Broncos and Raiders both have the Under-Odd which can be nasty in the right hands. The Cowboys have the 46 Bear which can get insane pressure. There's more but I think you get the gist of things.
MaddenUltimateTeam,3dwc2j,TheCard,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:55:13 2015 UTC,This. its the playbook i use. the 4-6 is really nice as there is a formation sub called speed package that puts 2 db's in at your outside linebacker spot

So 3rd and 4th down I couldn't hot route, ran fb dive 2x times on 3rd and 4th and 2 and got stuffed and turned the ball over.

Base Devin McCourty was the only FS I would use at the beginning because he has superb coverage skills and Earl Thomas is another option if you're looking for a little less coverage and more run support. At WR, I highly recommend Brandon Marshall because he holds on to everything but he's slow. The best bang for your buck receiver  would be TOTW Demariyus Thomas. Good speed, solid hands, and a deep threat at all times. His price might be a bit steep for you, but he is worth it."

MaddenUltimateTeam,3dw7x8,dont_make_cents,2,Mon Jul 20 01:24:31 2015 UTC,"Who are your receivers, QB? And I typically only throw deep if it's press cover 2 so I have a 1-on-1 with the safety"
MaddenUltimateTeam,3dw7x8,ItsBiggy,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:37:19 2015 UTC,4th RG3. 4th Fitz mike Wallace and amari cooper. A lot of times it looks like cover one but is cover 3. Is there a key defender I should look at to determine the coverage?
MaddenUltimateTeam,3dw7x8,ItsBiggy,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:01:41 2015 UTC,"When I had 4th RG3, he under threw the ball a lot resulting in picks. You want a guy who can lay the ball out in front of your receiver in stride like SB Brady or Bryce Petty if you really really want to build your offense around the deep ball. Your receivers are good and fast, but release and route running seem to be more important this year for getting open deep. And for the coverage thing, just check how many safeties are up top. If there are 2, it's cover 4, 2 man under, or cover 2. You want to avoid throwing deep against the first two listed so you tell them apart by the other player's tendencies and the corner's alignment. If they are facing your receiver straight up, it's probably man, and if they are just a shade inside with their backs angled to the sideline, it's probably zone. I say probably because it's not 100% because the pre-snap adjustments seem to affect the alignment of the corners to mask the coverage, so I rely a lot on player tendencies typically mixed with what I just said. Most people call similar coverages all game anyway. Finally, check out the match ups pre snap. You can get a good idea if your receiver can beat man coverage against certain corners. Sorry for the wall of text!"
MaddenUltimateTeam,3dw7x8,Politipals,2,Mon Jul 20 03:35:36 2015 UTC,"No thanks! I didn't realize the position of the corners showed whether it's zone or man, that's a big help."
MaddenUltimateTeam,3dw7x8,Politipals,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:44:02 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say getting a new QB is necessary, but if you're really having a problem with interceptions/bad passes I'd recommend FB Manning if you're ok with switching to a pocket passer. I've noticed RG3 is wildly inaccurate when I've played against him, but that Manning card is the most accurate card in the game(miles ahead of even UT Brady to my surprise). FB Manning can make passes no other QB can make, every pass is a perfectly thrown laser that goes directly into the receivers hands despite double or even triple coverage. He always finds a way to get the ball exactly where I need it, and he's so good I went from mobile QBs to him because I was picking up so many more yards with the passing game. The real kicker is his 99 PAC stat, which fools the defense every time meaning on any play action pass my receivers are much more open to the point where I barely have to make reads. With the FB topper he's pretty cheap now, definitely worth the 80-100k price tag."
MaddenUltimateTeam,3dw7x8,kingtut211011,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:47:41 2015 UTC,"I'm thinking about going back to Manning. I used the 95 forever and I don't run enough to have RG3. I do have 98 Otto if I do want to run some, using the zone read with RG3 and Lacy is the foundation of my scheme, but Manning was on point."

MaddenUltimateTeam,3dw7x8,TheCard,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:08:34 2015 UTC,"Forget luck, Manning has you covered. Feed him a balanced diet of play action and runs to really see where he shines. Also, though he can scramble remover to slide because he will cough it up if he gets hit sticked."
MaddenUltimateTeam,3dw7x8,TheCard,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:31:12 2015 UTC,"So far so good. My YAC has really improved. He's got a nice quick release as well. On slants he hits them and they don't drop a step. Of course his PA is bonkers, I think he had 96 or so on his 95 card. Good advice, dude."
MaddenUltimateTeam,3dw7x8,yoitsmedannyp,2,Mon Jul 20 09:09:20 2015 UTC,"I've found its best to do all short routes and if you go deep it's either a streak or face catch. Running plays for 15-30 yards are so easily recognized.  I run the Broncos playbook. Out of the pistol 5/6, not sure what it's called has a play called pa read. It has a wr on wheel route that is completely unguarded against cover 2 zone and cover 1 man. It also beats cover 3 rather consistently unless they give cushion."

MaddenUltimateTeam,3dw2jr,coolskater23,5,Mon Jul 20 00:35:59 2015 UTC,"He is the most amazing pocket qb. He has super quick release, never misses, awareness to get those sack breaking animations, and enough speed to get a first down."

MaddenUltimateTeam,3dw2jr,qpx,3,Mon Jul 20 00:39:54 2015 UTC,I think sb Brady is the better thrower but Peytons pa rating and acc give him the edge for me.
MaddenUltimateTeam,3dw2jr,Kdings,3,Mon Jul 20 00:43:47 2015 UTC,"I remember him being able to lead passes beautifully so your receivers could catch them in stride rather than put in effort to catch. He's also slippery in the pocket and has the mobility to pick up 10. If you get him and do scramble, don't go up the middle unless you're on the 5 yard line or closer. Fivehead WILL shit his pants and put the ball on the ground."

MaddenUltimateTeam,3dw2jr,Politipals,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:05:29 2015 UTC,"Dude, he is the best pocket passer in the game. I've tried a lot of 99 QBs including UT Brady, Honors Rodgers, PH Wilson, UT Vick, FE Romo, SB Brady, etc... and Manning is without a question the most accurate and possibly the best overall. Every throw is a perfectly thrown laser that's guided to my receivers hands. Double coverage? Lol! Triple? Fuck it, if I can see his hands Manning will get the ball there. I love watching the replays after the game because he literally can throw it an inch outside of a DB's hand to get it to my receiver, it's like looking at art being made. The 2nd fastest release in the game means that his passes teleport out of his hand the second you press the button(compared to a long throwing motion of Romo and Brady which leads to sacks and incomplete passes). 95 AWR means he'll always throw a perfect curve right over a DB so that only your receiver can get the ball. 99 PAC means the defense bites every time on play action passes, my receivers are so open I barely need to make reads. 77 ACC and 70 SPD means he can scramble when needed(man this guy has some wheels). I thought the 96 THP would be a problem, but it feels way faster and he always puts the ball right on the money with the deep ball as long as you don't wait too long before throwing( his max is like 65-70 yds)."

But this late in the game it might be cheaper to buy him. I know his price is super inflated right now but if you're patient you can get him for a good price.   If you want you can try to snipe the pieces it might take a while, and if you buy them at average value you'd pay more than buying him outright."
MaddenUltimateTeam,3dw1kd,Tissuebox007,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:55:24 2015 UTC,"Thanks man, i was wondering if I should just buy him outright. Sitting on about 300k so I'm not that far off after some grinding and flipping."
MaddenUltimateTeam,3dw1kd,Tissuebox007,2,Mon Jul 20 01:04:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah no worries. sometimes it's cheaper but that's really with sets where cards have no use, like Positionsl Heroes. With the all rookie people use the players, like Mosley, Mack and HaHa would cost you 150k already, then you've got to buy the other 29.

MaddenUltimateTeam,3duqfp,jdiditok,3,Sun Jul 19 17:45:45 2015 UTC,A scheme is just really plays you trust or know how to read. Just keep changing it up to confuse the opponent.
MaddenUltimateTeam,3duqfp,UltimateTeam,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:54:52 2015 UTC,"I switch it up on offense a lot too. I like to keep the opponent guessing. But I do have a couple formations and plays I really like when I need to get something done. First it was just trying out playbooks until I found a balance of passing/rushing plays that fit with how much I call of each. Then its finding formations with good passing and running plays, good being subjective. Ideally I like to find a formation that fits that AND has decent audibles so I don't pain myself into a corner on third and long.   For me it's a lot of trial and error with plays and players, i'm definitely no offensive expert. But I just find what I like to do and keep mashing pegs in holes until everything generally fits what I want to do in a game."

MaddenUltimateTeam,3duqfp,TheCard,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:55:53 2015 UTC,"First is, on first down do you like to run or pass?, then its do you prefer a speed or power run game? these are the first questions i ask myself. For me i like to play an inside run game, mixed with a few counters and stretch plays, all while baiting the defense to run commit, then look to beat them over the top or with a quick passes that have YAC potential.   I use the seahawks playbook which also has jets sweeps and end arounds i can mix in if they start stacking for inside runs.   Sometime i get into a ""ask madden"" rut and have to remind myself to get back to what i do best.(run the rock) I also use Gilliam as my Te2 so in all 2 te sets its like having an extra lineman."
MaddenUltimateTeam,3duqfp,DC4realz,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:06:58 2015 UTC,I always throw in an ask madden on first down to see what my opponent usually calls them I just keep track of his previous plays and adjust my game plan to that
MaddenUltimateTeam,3duqfp,supremedreamteam,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:24:39 2015 UTC,Personally I use the premium west coast offense PB. Lot of routes and plays that many haven't seen before. In H2H I just run random ones I like when going through the concepts. Once you find a style you like stick to it. Although my playbook is based around my style (pass first) the runs are decent.
MaddenUltimateTeam,3duqfp,Matthew3358,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:23:19 2015 UTC,"Check out my raiders scheme- YouTube.com/iflash3 . I use run n gun now, but I still love that scheme.

I have him on the AH just chilling and I get a message saying ""220k for NTL. or my easter emmitt.""  I just go ""wtf?"" then ""double wtf?"" He says NTL averages 220k and I politely tell him no he doesnt. He then says he made a mistake and that he averages 247k. Now I'm getting annoyed and I say definitely fucking not, please go away.  He says it's the end of MUT, I wasn't getting 300k for NTL. I'm thinking wtf 300k is a steal, imo. I called him a tard and said look at MM. He says ""Get the fuck out of here u shit face."" I said fucking learn to use the internet lmao.  He then says and I quote looking at my messages right now: ""U been tryna sell dat shit for weeks u crack pipe dick suckin cumstain"" (Never had him on the AH before this...?)  That sent me into my old troll ways. We got into quite a verbal tussle involving any racial slur you could think of. I was banned for a day, and then two weeks because of it. I'm sure he was too.

He was just terrible, tried to face catch but Charles Woodson was having none of it! Had like 6 picks. Anyway I beat him and he messages me ""gg fagg"" and I'm like oh no you didn't. ""So I call him a face catching ass"" and we go back and forth for awhile. Finally he messages me saying ""stfu you 5 yr old"" and I message back my favorite line. ""Motherfucker I'm 6."" Banned fo 2 days. Totally worth it.  TL;DR: got banned for saying ""motherfucker I'm 6"". Not even mad."

MaddenUltimateTeam,3dubzi,Matthew3358,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:49:50 2015 UTC,I think play rec is the most important stat
MaddenUltimateTeam,3dubzi,dont_make_cents,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:12:30 2015 UTC,All depends on how much you value height

MaddenUltimateTeam,3dsv6y,dont_make_cents,7,Sun Jul 19 03:17:23 2015 UTC,"I never quit. the longer i stay in a blowout the more i learn. I just played a game where i was picked off six times, but I was only down 14-28 on his 20 at the start of the 4th. Then i had a network timeout lol. It was still a fun game, i probably still would have lost."

This is the first year I've played Madden since Madden 05, and when I started I would have never finished a game if I quit. I think I'm slightly above average now, but have a ton more room to improve, particularly usering the defense. I always overrun interceptions!"

It was one of those games where everything went right. The back juke was strong this game. Lacey's spin move annihilates., though. I love this card.

When a military guy said what about when I'm away from the country and want to play, and a ms guy told him to play 360 lhh  Only after a ton of preorders got cancelled then they changed it, but let's see what happens when they get a nice install base in place."

MaddenUltimateTeam,3drrso,SHanKeRSauRx,2,Sat Jul 18 21:05:31 2015 UTC,"And what about Arian foster, his highest card is a 92 base elite. Really ea? Wtf?"
MaddenUltimateTeam,3drrso,thesellector,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:46:20 2015 UTC,He might get a FE card. I think they are planning one more set of FE's

MaddenUltimateTeam,3drrso,thesellector,2,Sun Jul 19 00:45:08 2015 UTC,Is there no more new cards? I need a Brandon Browner.
MaddenUltimateTeam,3drrso,Potated,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:55:55 2015 UTC,No more UL's or movers. A few FE's left.
MaddenUltimateTeam,3drrso,UltimateTeam,2,Sat Jul 18 21:04:00 2015 UTC,5 more FE cards total 1 hero :(
MaddenUltimateTeam,3drrso,DontTestTheUser,2,Sat Jul 18 21:19:06 2015 UTC,I think just one more FE hero sadly
MaddenUltimateTeam,3drrso,Potated,-3,Sat Jul 18 21:07:24 2015 UTC,"Wow... Fuck EA games get worse every year and they are SO bad at picking players to make. This will be the last Madden I buy for sure. Not going to buy a redone version of the same game, supporting a shit company that wont make a good football game bc they payed to be the only Football game maker. Done ranting. Aghhggha"
MaddenUltimateTeam,3drrso,The_Lotto,2,Sat Jul 18 22:25:23 2015 UTC,I will never get my speed Marino. Why EA Why?!?!?!!!?!??!
MaddenUltimateTeam,3drrso,nfarber,0,Sun Jul 19 15:54:41 2015 UTC,I don't think that ea would make a new card that is worse than a previously made card of the same player.  Why would u have a golden ticket lesean only just to release a worse version as a movers.  Same thing for browner.  I may be wrong but I am pretty sure that every card released had been an upgrade to the players previous best.  There isn't much better than a golden ticket so they shouldn't get one
MaddenUltimateTeam,3drrso,Mutcraft24,4,Sat Jul 18 21:42:10 2015 UTC,Rg3 and Bo got new and better cards than their gt's
MaddenUltimateTeam,3drrso,jmcd123,6,Sat Jul 18 21:49:53 2015 UTC,The 24 hour mover stats have been underwhelming though. (Except Tebow)
MaddenUltimateTeam,3drrso,nfarber,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:50:11 2015 UTC,Exactly.  But now worse cards.  It would be outrageous to have a maccoy or browner with better stats than their golden tickets.  They are godly

While it may be tempting to rock out with an 84 Alshon Jeffery when your other receivers are 73 overall, you will be able to sell him for 25k and in a month he will go down to 10k. I made this mistake early, as I tried to build my team with the times (I kept my high golds and suffered later). If you can spend money to be competitive during all of MUT then go ahead, but if you are a casual player I suggest saving until Christmas at least if you want a decent team during the 2nd half of MUT (when 99s come out)."

MaddenUltimateTeam,3dr44d,rickyhou22,3,Sat Jul 18 19:43:59 2015 UTC,You'll see players that are low rated but with good (90+) speed going for more than they should. For example Cromartie and DRC will usually go for 20k+
MaddenUltimateTeam,3dr44d,owned_at_worms,2,Sat Jul 18 17:33:24 2015 UTC,"I ran their base cards until amerson rising star and the 88 cromartie came out, they were so awesome."

MaddenUltimateTeam,3dr44d,UltimateTeam,1 point,Sun Jul 19 08:12:47 2015 UTC,Base Elites are expensive atleast 20k+ sometimes 45k+ for skill positions. Legends are 85k+ top players are 89-91 overall and cost 300k+ base Sherman was 600k for a while. Sometimes there are captain sets this year 90 overall that went from anywhere around 60-150k. H2H is way better because not many users are using the same play over and over and many glitches are unknown. I will personally be stocking coins hoping to get 500k+ from solos and trading by Thanksgiving. I will probably not start buying top players until christmas or RTTP. The AH is very busy even day 1 gold are 10k+ for the first few weeks.

MaddenUltimateTeam,3dr44d,bburchibanez,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:35:48 2015 UTC,"In the beginning, work on getting your team solid all around and try to find great budget players. Big purchases in the beginning of the year are often ill-advised. The earliest promos, like initial team of the week, can be used to make A LOT OF coins, but only if you can figure out the market and play things well.   It's the most fun part for me, because it's all still unknown and you always feel like you're making progress."

MaddenUltimateTeam,3dpoo0,Imfreakenbad13,3,Sat Jul 18 06:14:18 2015 UTC,"I've had a really good experience with Harrison. Fun to user, pulls down picks, good run stopping and lays the boom. Great overall card"
MaddenUltimateTeam,3dpoo0,Tissuebox007,1 point,Sat Jul 18 06:24:52 2015 UTC,Here's a comparison of the two  http://www.mutrank.com/15/compare/6257/6229 Looks like the only huge edge peppers has on Harrison is catching and a few physicals
MaddenUltimateTeam,3dpoo0,Tissuebox007,1 point,Sat Jul 18 06:30:20 2015 UTC,Ditto with what this guy said. I actually play UT RE Peppers at the ROLB and UT Harrison at the LOLB. Harrison is good at rushing the QB and can play in coverage.
MaddenUltimateTeam,3dpoo0,pt_guard10,2,Sat Jul 18 07:50:19 2015 UTC,"Either Harrison or Honors Davis. Imo Davis is one of the best players in the game. Covers like a cb, great pass rush, great play rec, very fast. picks off wr screens all day. Plays qb contain great."

MaddenUltimateTeam,3dpoo0,sportsgamerpat,1 point,Sat Jul 18 08:24:22 2015 UTC,"I keep hearing lots of love for Harrison.  This makes me want to try him there, but CW Von makes so many plays at that position it would be hard to give him up.  By the way, UT Peppers flourishes at 3-4 ROLB for me."
MaddenUltimateTeam,3dpoo0,TangerineDiesel,1 point,Sat Jul 18 08:52:58 2015 UTC,"I'm heavily considering buying CW Miller, maybe even within the next few hours as I wait for the auction of one of my cards to sell. How is he? I know his catching isn't that great, but I'm not really looking for picks out of him. How's his blitzing and his tackling? Does he live up to his stats and overall rating?"
MaddenUltimateTeam,3dpoo0,Joshvapes,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:46:30 2015 UTC,I send him nearly every play.  He gets no less than 2 sacks a game.  He wraps guys up extremely well.  The few times I drop him in coverage he holds up.  He once made a game saving int in a superbowl.  He honestly out plays UT Peppers on the other side though he does have fe Wilkerson's help and Peppers only has 4ofj Allen.  I'd buy him without hesitation.
MaddenUltimateTeam,3dpoo0,TangerineDiesel,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:14:11 2015 UTC,Thank you
MaddenUltimateTeam,3dpoo0,Joshvapes,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:27:50 2015 UTC,I play Peppers at ROLB and Boss Harrison at LOLB. Obviously the Boss card outplays Peppers as a pure pass rusher but I actually prefer to user Peppers due to his length and coverage ability. Peppers gets more picks in my system and Harrison gets more sacks.
MaddenUltimateTeam,3dpmdx,Sp3nsah,1 point,Sat Jul 18 05:45:41 2015 UTC,"All depends on your scheme. Think about what your WR1 or WR2 usually do for you in a game. If you get them in open space a lot, then yes elusiveness matters quite a bit. However, if they are mostly running streaks something, where they are basically catching the ball and getting tackled, then no it doesn't really matter."
MaddenUltimateTeam,3dpmdx,Tdailey3296,1 point,Sat Jul 18 05:57:04 2015 UTC,"Alright, then it seems that elusiveness won't matter. Mainly use the guy in the slot for YAC. Thanks."

MaddenUltimateTeam,3dp8qa,Joshvapes,2,Sat Jul 18 03:21:15 2015 UTC,Best 3-4 right end IMO
MaddenUltimateTeam,3dp8qa,Cheehu,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:31:57 2015 UTC,Afwul user for me aswell but good for his price at 34 end. Also high play rec/awareness makes him decent for contain if you set your ends on it (he wont spill out by himself)
MaddenUltimateTeam,3dp8qa,young_sav_mut,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:23:50 2015 UTC,I litterally just got him... Have not played one game with him. I'm gunna be upset if he is not good because his stats looked amazing to me!
MaddenUltimateTeam,3dp8qa,Potated,2,Sat Jul 18 03:52:51 2015 UTC,I can't agree more. I feel the same exact way

MaddenUltimateTeam,3dp8qa,TearsofLyys,1 point,Sat Jul 18 12:25:20 2015 UTC,I just upgraded to him from 96 Leonard Williams. The difference is definitely noticeable. Smith's blockshed actually allows him to get pressure on the qb.

MaddenUltimateTeam,3doah7,khizpe,6,Fri Jul 17 22:10:58 2015 UTC,I was just thinking this today actually. If they would do a topper for like $20 and guarantees you a boss card or GT or something. You think it would be the smart decision by them but then again this is EA we are talking about lol
MaddenUltimateTeam,3doah7,sicilianbadguy,2,Fri Jul 17 22:13:10 2015 UTC,That would crazy lower prices would be nice though
MaddenUltimateTeam,3doah7,UltimateTeam,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:14:24 2015 UTC,You will alienate so many people when you make their teams worthless. I really doubt EA would do this.
MaddenUltimateTeam,3doah7,LetsTalkMarkets,2,Sat Jul 18 00:15:23 2015 UTC,Aren't their teams going to be worthless in a month anyway?
MaddenUltimateTeam,3doah7,shrike3000,3,Sat Jul 18 05:39:43 2015 UTC,"Shhhhhh, don't give them ideas.  Actually, I don't buy packs with money, and some cheap 99s would be nice. Hell, go for it EA! I want to make some upgrades!"
MaddenUltimateTeam,3doah7,Iknowwhereyoualllive,3,Fri Jul 17 22:12:41 2015 UTC,"I know ea loves money, but they will NEVER bring back limited (24hour) cards, especiallu not with a gaurantee. They may find a way to get people to buy into packs maybe with like a final edition or combine warrior weekend. Like last year they took fan votes on what they should put back into packs."
MaddenUltimateTeam,3doah7,jmcd123,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:08:22 2015 UTC,How did the fan votes work and when was it? It's already getting late in MUT
MaddenUltimateTeam,3doah7,jmcd123,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:26:54 2015 UTC,I think it was just people responding to one of ea'stweets about it
MaddenUltimateTeam,3doah7,chaymoney86,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:22:24 2015 UTC,Most wanted weekend. They put in a bunch of promo cards from throughout the year. They also put the easter egg back in which essentially gave you the cornucopia pack.  It was a neat promo.
MaddenUltimateTeam,3doah7,UltimateTeam,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:18:41 2015 UTC,Eh I hope not but I would not be surprised. Would be cool if they released something new brought something back.
MaddenUltimateTeam,3doah7,unsafewhale16,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:12:32 2015 UTC,yeah if they did this i think it could hurt there sales for the next year
MaddenUltimateTeam,3doah7,Bizzlebomb,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:46:24 2015 UTC,I had this thought as well I see it happening seems really cool as an idea. Tppper is a 24 hour card can be anything from 24 hour Kelce to 24 hour Jamal to GT Deion.
MaddenUltimateTeam,3dplbd,Itwasaverygooday,1 point,Sat Jul 18 05:33:14 2015 UTC,"Your offense looks solid, aside from the offensive line which I don't think is that big of a deal. Maybe save up for Ditka, but you could roll with what you have for a while and not have any problems.   I would get All-Rookie HaHa Clinton-Dix at FS, he plays way above his stats. I might also go get a better DT, movers Dan Williams looks like a beast for his price."
MaddenUltimateTeam,3dplbd,Tdailey3296,1 point,Sat Jul 18 05:44:45 2015 UTC,"I'd get TOTY Peters for LT and Movers Iupati for LG. Of course those suggestions are biased of me because they're both on my team, but they've seriously been excellent. Also on defense I'd think about getting AR Khalil Mack and UL Bruce Smith (biased again because they're also on my team), but they've been getting the job done. At first I thought Bruce smith wasn't that good, but he's been getting better and better and has shown why he's worthy of a UL card. Those are the moves I'd make for now"
MaddenUltimateTeam,3dplbd,Joshvapes,1 point,Sat Jul 18 06:56:18 2015 UTC,Better FS Atwater or Weddle
MaddenUltimateTeam,3dplbd,UltimateTeam,1 point,Sat Jul 18 12:26:45 2015 UTC,You can get some really nice DT's for under 40k right now. 95 Dan Williams is fairly solid for around 34k. A cheaper option would be 92 Wilfork. He balls out and you could snag him around 15k. Good luck!
MaddenUltimateTeam,3dpjnm,Joshvapes,2,Sat Jul 18 05:13:55 2015 UTC,93 Rahim Moore has been beastly for me
MaddenUltimateTeam,3dpjnm,Itwasaverygooday,1 point,Sat Jul 18 05:35:13 2015 UTC,Fs Calvin is not that good when not usered I'm pretty sure.
MaddenUltimateTeam,3dpjnm,Mutcraft24,2,Sat Jul 18 05:16:00 2015 UTC,PFFFT! Calvin is a beast 50% of the time when not usered. Who knows where he's at the rest of the time though.
MaddenUltimateTeam,3dpjnm,owned_at_worms,1 point,Sat Jul 18 05:33:01 2015 UTC,"Yea that's why I want to change him. He's been pretty weak. Even when someone throws it his way and I click on him and go for a swat, he just stands there like a fucking idiot while the opponent gets the catch, smh."
MaddenUltimateTeam,3dpjnm,Mutcraft24,0,Sat Jul 18 05:17:39 2015 UTC,"In all honestly I'd recommend combine warrior Tyron mathieu. Don't let his height fool you, that card is a straight beast. Highly recommended him. Jumps routes and really helps out on those lob streaks believe it or not"
MaddenUltimateTeam,3dpjnm,marlins15ss,1 point,Sat Jul 18 05:20:51 2015 UTC,Maybe I'll save for him. I spent my coins on the nice upgrades I've made so far. Thanks for the recommendation
MaddenUltimateTeam,3dpjnm,Tdailey3296,1 point,Sat Jul 18 05:30:21 2015 UTC,"Just get Final Edition Eric Reid, better than all three."
MaddenUltimateTeam,3dpjnm,Potated,1 point,Sat Jul 18 05:32:53 2015 UTC,Just looked at his stats. Just looked at his price. Just bought him. Lol he looks like a beast
MaddenUltimateTeam,3dpjnm,UltimateTeam,1 point,Sat Jul 18 06:49:08 2015 UTC,"I'd still go with Calvin. His height and speed more than make up for the rest of his lackluster stats. Clark is awful, and Reid is not very good at this point either. If you don't want Calvin, check out the 86 overall HaHa Clinton Dix, he was really good for me when I had him."
MaddenUltimateTeam,3dpjnm,Scopics,1 point,Sat Jul 18 06:00:12 2015 UTC,"I'm gonna go with FE Reid. He looks like a beast. Thank you for your suggestions. Tbh, I don't really agree with your view on Calvin. I respect your opinion, but I feel differently. His height, speed, and catching are all obviously ridiculously good, but he just doesn't cut it for me anymore. He lets players catch balls that he can easily intercept or swat if he'd just jump when I press Y or RB. FE Reid looks sick and he's also really tall"

MaddenUltimateTeam,3dnvy6,Joshvapes,2,Fri Jul 17 20:16:49 2015 UTC,"Depends if it's a 3-4 or 4-3. In a 3-4, Mack will be just as good or slightly worse than Ham, and in a 4-3, Ham is like a fricken black hole on the left side. Imo he's wasted coins in a 3-4 because Mack plays lights out right there and does everything you need him to"
MaddenUltimateTeam,3dnvy6,ItsBiggy,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:19:01 2015 UTC,Ham is way better 4-3 arguably a worse 3-4 then Mack depends how much you blitz.

Maybe I'm just not that good or I was using Mack wrong, but he wasn't really what I was looking for. His tackles were legit, no one ever broke a tackle when he was in the way, but he forces no fumbles, got no interceptions, and didn't have that many sacks. He didn't really make his presence felt."
MaddenUltimateTeam,3dnvy6,dominus24,1 point,Mon Jul 20 08:46:59 2015 UTC,"I ended up buying AR Mack and UL Bruce Smith instead of getting Ham because I needed more upgrades rather than just spending it on one player. I have one question. I played only one game with these players so far, Mack is really good, but I usered Bruce Smith and got pancaked back to back times. Did I make a mistake with the release or is he not that good? I really hope it was my fault and maybe it was a freak thing because I'm usually perfect with the timing of when to try to shed the block. I don't want to find out that Bruce smith isn't that good. I'm upgrading from SB Chandler Jones who was a huge disappointment for me earlier in the year"

MaddenUltimateTeam,3do9yt,khizpe,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:46:40 2015 UTC,I would upgrade the slot cb but how much do you like Sproles because it might be a good idea to upgrade to someone like 94 Charles
MaddenUltimateTeam,3do9yt,DontTestTheUser,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:15:18 2015 UTC,Sell your backups. You can get a good amount of money by selling those players that see like 2 snaps a game.

MaddenUltimateTeam,3doxp2,Clasher1,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:54:07 2015 UTC,"If you really just care about fun for 150k you can grab SPD Brady, an ok line, some good blocking receivers along with a good blocking HB and FB. You'll have to deal with a bronze defense, but man is it fun to scramble with 95 SPD Brady. Nobody expects it(including the d-line so they'll bite on the read option pretty much every time) and you might get a few rage quits."

So basically I'm running the 4-4 with DJ as sort of an MLB2, then Lott as the LOLB. This has been my favorite setup and Lott and DJ GO NUTS. SO MANY PICKS. I would recommend to everyone."

MaddenUltimateTeam,3dmv0i,Teajam,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:56:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I usually user my MLB. If I user anything other than my linebacker, I usually mess everything up"
MaddenUltimateTeam,3dmv0i,UltimateTeam,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:00:05 2015 UTC,See I did too. But then I started ushering whoever was I. The middle Hook zone. So sometimes my SS would be covering there so if user him. Then I became comfortable ushering a Safety. And I started ushering the blue flat zone sometimes. So I could move even more people to the middle of the field or cover corner routes better. And it helps bring more people in the box on a run play.
MaddenUltimateTeam,3dmv0i,dude_bro16,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:13:38 2015 UTC,I user DJ and he just is not as agile as I need my MLB to be he is sub par sometimes

MaddenUltimateTeam,3dmtnz,WalrusRider,7,Fri Jul 17 15:29:55 2015 UTC,"I think now would be the best time to finish the 4oJ sets and open the lombardi packs. WHen I opened them I got complete garbage and almost all base elites from the beginning of the year. If there is pack ratio adjustments going on, I would assume they would be back to normal where you would get newer cards now.  Hopefully I can snipe some flashback cards this weekend."
MaddenUltimateTeam,3dmtnz,owned_at_worms,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:36:50 2015 UTC,I would only need RG3 and VJax to do the set but I would lose a lot of starter. I might not even do the set atleast not til real late.
MaddenUltimateTeam,3dmtnz,UltimateTeam,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:58:45 2015 UTC,I wouldn't doubt it. Pretty sure they did the same thing with the Easter Pro Packs . I'm too scared to get rid of my players for the Lombardi packs. I'll probably just do it the last week or two of MUT and give whatever I get away
MaddenUltimateTeam,3dmtnz,owned_at_worms,2,Fri Jul 17 16:03:16 2015 UTC,"Same thing happened to me at easter. I opened an obscene amount of the bundles I got from the egg sets, and didn't really pull anything worthwhile. Probably at least 10x bundles, I know I had to clean out my binder 3x times."

MaddenUltimateTeam,3dmtnz,owned_at_worms,2,Fri Jul 17 16:30:31 2015 UTC,"Usually when I open packs, I'll get some 80-84's, 85+ and an elite sprinkled here and there. about 90% of the packs from easter bundles that I opened had 79 or below golds in them."

MaddenUltimateTeam,3do65j,UltimateTeam,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:45:21 2015 UTC,No idea if there's any reason to wait or not. All you can really get is the FE from this week (AJ Green is the set hero) and all of the movers that aren't 24h.
MaddenUltimateTeam,3dmb9r,neboo11,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:50:02 2015 UTC,I have about 75k to work with right now. If I need more coin I would probably sell Woodson and downgrade at CB1.

MaddenUltimateTeam,3dmb9r,yoitsmedannyp,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:54:50 2015 UTC,Good suggestion. The RnG book is worth 100k just as much as any one player you can get for 100. Soo many plays

MaddenUltimateTeam,3dnqti,yoitsmedannyp,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:44:40 2015 UTC,"For sure, best coverage linebacker in the game... You'll want a run stuffing mlb2 tho, that's why i suggested clay. He's a beast but, higher overall guys to check out are 99 Demario, 98 shazier, any of the 99lamberts... Hightower is good, just a bit slow at this point"
MaddenUltimateTeam,3dnqti,MiseryAd,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:47:46 2015 UTC,"Is the 70 awr for Clay noticeable, since I don't user the mlb2, just the 1  Also, wouldn't 97 Mecklenburg be a good mlb2, I think the new fb topper will drive his price down so I might pick him up"
MaddenUltimateTeam,3dnqti,yoitsmedannyp,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:17:46 2015 UTC,"Yeaa Mecklenburg is good, 93 clay is a monster against the run and plays very much like kuechly in coverage. I never noticed his low awareness"

MaddenUltimateTeam,3dnh59,TheBrickWahl,2,Fri Jul 17 18:26:30 2015 UTC,"Switch Donald and Williams. how's cb3 playing for you? Rod Woodson is a killer cb3. You can downgrade ogletree to 94 Jenkins (dolphins) and not notice a difference. If thats only the 94 Donald, you should upgrade to the 97 or 96 Fairley (rams) 95 Williams (Vikings) 96 Suh(lions) 95 or 99 mean Joe green"
MaddenUltimateTeam,3dnh59,yoitsmedannyp,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:35:04 2015 UTC,I love Johnson at Cb3 and yes that is the 94 Donald. Williams and Donald do quite well together but I should probably get a better DT. Thanks for the suggestions!
MaddenUltimateTeam,3dnh59,yoitsmedannyp,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:48:02 2015 UTC,"donald is just too small to play the dt2 spot in most 4-3 formations. DT2 is lined up between center and LG, which is probably everyones strong spots on the oline, and normally gets double teamed by them. you want a big, strong, fat guy here to soak em up"
MaddenUltimateTeam,3dnh59,Teajam,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:17:27 2015 UTC,Upgrade Donald to his 97 and move him to DT1

MaddenUltimateTeam,3dmho3,mambo_matt,5,Fri Jul 17 13:52:31 2015 UTC,"Stay away from packs man. Once in a while they are ok, but it's easier to build a team through the AH.

MaddenUltimateTeam,3dmho3,theonlyoptionistopoo,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:11:19 2015 UTC,That card has great stats for a 93 too
MaddenUltimateTeam,3dmho3,UltimateTeam,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:52:34 2015 UTC,Do you get that kind of turnover everyday? That pretty close to my best day haha even now when there are few good cards up. what are you flipping
MaddenUltimateTeam,3dmho3,owned_at_worms,2,Fri Jul 17 14:55:12 2015 UTC,"I think it just depends, I hit FB, MVP, SV, Captains, totw, toty, FO and legends pretty regularly. I have been killing it the last couple of days, have landed about 5x toty cards for 10k and have been able to sell for 30k+.  I have also started adding the totw cards for Pat Pete, Sherm, Calvin to my quick search list, and legend dierdorf I have finished for around 30k and it sells for 39k, so thats about 5k profit on that set. The Pat Pete I finished this morning for 20k total, and the sherm/Calvin I should be able to finish for around the same. The program collectables in all pro packs sell dirt cheap."
MaddenUltimateTeam,3dmho3,UltimateTeam,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:59:03 2015 UTC,Impressive once I get some coins I will target the smaller deals and build up 5k a deal from there. Not even sure who I would get haha probably someone like if I could gather tons of coins GT Calvin or UL Peppers
MaddenUltimateTeam,3dmho3,owned_at_worms,2,Fri Jul 17 15:01:34 2015 UTC,"I started sunday doing only rising stars, then when I got built up to about 60k i started hitting the other sets. I have all toty OLINE except for Vollmer now, once I snag him I am just working towards the GT Calvin."
MaddenUltimateTeam,3dmho3,UltimateTeam,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:02:42 2015 UTC,GT Calvin is good. Hope you get to him worms. Vollmer is solid. Thanks for the tips
MaddenUltimateTeam,3dmho3,owned_at_worms,2,Fri Jul 17 15:04:20 2015 UTC,"No problem. I actually decided this morning that I was going to flip my oline as well to get to the Calvin quicker, but we'll just have to see how it goes. It's hard to sell someone that I got such a good deal on. My Mario sold for 29 this morning, and even though it's a nice profit, I got such a score on him that I hated to let him go."
MaddenUltimateTeam,3dmho3,owned_at_worms,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:05:48 2015 UTC,Also don't turn your nose up at the smaller deals. I still buy cards that I can get a quick 1k profit

MaddenUltimateTeam,3dmho3,callmeRichard,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:43:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah you're right. I need to stop trying to hit big with them. I don't have much skill with the AH though. Although, I do have some 90+ players that I've accrued from the AH, it seems the higher the overalls, the harder it is for me to come by them for cheap. Never had a snipe before and auctioning is a pain with how little time I have to play (have a toddler). Something about packs brings me back to my younger days playing Pokemon and Yugio, opening up packs you save money for and finding a rare card. That feeling is awesome :) But again, you're right I need to stop lol"
MaddenUltimateTeam,3dmho3,owned_at_worms,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:27:47 2015 UTC,You can either spend time (grinding the AH and solos) or money (packs) to build a good team.  My old ass barely has any time to play H2H let alone grind... but I have plenty of disposable income to buy bundles with.  But buying packs this late in the season doesn't make much sense.  Last money I spent was during the Ultimate Freeze promo.
MaddenUltimateTeam,3dmho3,callmeRichard,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:02:17 2015 UTC,"So do you just play enough to buy players and adjust your lineup? Not being sarcastic, but you said you barely have time to play h2h.  I've spent well over 3k this year buying packs/bundles, and I also spend 2-5 minutes between h2h games in the AH and make a good amount of money. This week alone I have went from 30k to 750k working in between games in the AH. It's not typical, but it is very easy. My comment was based more for the people who spend coins on packs, which is what it seemed like OP was referring to. I always say ""spend real money on packs, coins on players""."
MaddenUltimateTeam,3dmho3,UltimateTeam,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:10:26 2015 UTC,"On average, I probably play two days per week.  Usually 2-6 games per day.  Though there are times where I do get to binge on Madden.  And when I'm in the AH I'm just looking to buy and sell at market rates.  I don't put in the effort to snipe or buy and resell at all.  I actually look directly at Mutmanager and go off their rates for buying and selling.  So I've spent quite a bit this season... my team is a 99 overall but no GTs or really crazy cards.  And I have grinded some solos (Style Master and Gauntlet once).  I only spend cash on packs... coins on players.  I remember the beginning of the season when I posted any gold player I was selling for 1100 because I didn't want to spend the time looking up market rates (before I was aware of /r/MaddenUltimateTeam and Mutmanager).  I'm sure I made a lot of people happy during those first couple months of Madden."
MaddenUltimateTeam,3dmho3,callmeRichard,2,Fri Jul 17 20:32:58 2015 UTC,Cool personally I never open packs just use the AH

MaddenUltimateTeam,3dp271,Teajam,0,Sat Jul 18 02:40:06 2015 UTC,"can we just do trade block. no offense, but you seem like you will just take over my email"
MaddenUltimateTeam,3dp271,Teajam,3,Sat Jul 18 03:32:29 2015 UTC,He's a trusted member of the community. It's all good it won't get flagged for selling players like if you do it over the trade block. You can try it but you'll get permabanned by EA or you can let him to the account transfer for no hassle.

MaddenUltimateTeam,3dn91b,OptimusChip,3,Fri Jul 17 17:26:42 2015 UTC,"For corners, some of it is scheme dependent. Universals for outside corners that always matter: play rec, awareness, height, speed/acc. For a bump n run scheme (lots of press) then press is important as is acc/spd. For a scheme where you sit back in cover 3 and don't press, then zone is going to be more important. If you play more than 10-15% of man coverage, then man coverage would be important, too.  Guys you may enjoy: Marcus Peters (Draft), Charles Tillman (Movers), Vontae Davis (24 hr), Chris Harris (TOTY).  For FS - I think hit power, zone, play rec, awr, are the most important. If you user the FS in hook zones or use cover 2 invert a lot, then Id also include pursuit and block shed.   For SS - Hit power, play rec, awr. My favorite SS is Polamalu because he has like 90 spec catch so if you play him in a hook zone near the LOS, you can defend a lot of turn with his spec catch abilities if you user him."
MaddenUltimateTeam,3dn91b,expectantsneer,2,Fri Jul 17 18:30:39 2015 UTC,"Imo, its play rec."

I would either make Vandershank somehow not shank that field goal, or stop Nick Harpers GF from stabbing him in the leg before the game so Big Ben couldn't catch up to him on the fumble return.  That was the end of probably the most talented Indy Colts team of all time.  Also was Edgerrin James's last game. Would have loved to have sent this dude out with a ring.  Also to comment on that play you are talking about. Easily one of the most unexpected an amazing plays I've ever seen. While they should have run, that wasn't really a bad play call. Butler just played it better than I could imagine. And what a time to do it.  I have to hate the Pats, but I respect the hell out of them."

I was on the go ahead drive with a minute to go and I threw a pick to end the game :( Never really been that devastated in a game before then. Needless to say, it was my fault and if I could go back to that moment and redo it again, I would in a heart beat.   P.S.

The way he reads holes and takes his time before he goes in is amazing.

Doctor told him there was a 25% chance he would regain full strength and ended up taking back up money as a pro bowler to play for the saints. He supported new Orleans thru Katrina with countless charities and won a flipping super bowl! The guy continues to lead every year no matter who his teammates are. I'll never forget the scene after won the super bowl and the camera caught him holding his son and them staring at the confetti falling. The guy has played the game the right way and been  great role model.

So in a way Eli was just like me as a kid growing up I had a brother was popular and was great in anything he did so people wanted to see if I would be exactly like him or be just some scrub that people would forget about. So I looked up to Eli as a kid and although he never will be in the same category as Peyton he will have always been the person that did something Peyton could never do and that's beat Peyton's greatest rival Tom Brady in the Super Bowl twice.

Aside from football and baseball, he played several other sports on his spare time, even though his schedule was always impacted. Don't let me get started on his persona. This guy was humble. He wasn't cocky like most NFL players are today. He never spoke that often on the media because of his stuttering issue. When he did speak, it would be friendly words.

What separates him from Forte is that you'd always hear about Marshall getting mad about the losses and would bring it to the attention of the team. So much so that people started saying he was a bad locker room presence, but dude is a stud and a winner.

I love watching him play and seeing just how dedicated he is to the sport. I have never seen a player play the game as smart as he does. Love him or hate him everyone can admit how smart and talented the guy is. Plus it helps that he was an SEC boy (even if he was a vol haha)

MaddenUltimateTeam,3dk2kx,1i_lu,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:05:56 2015 UTC,"Julio Jones. Firstly, I grew up in Alabama so I saw him play high school and in college. He was as big as he is now in high school, an absolute freak. He also had a good reputation for being a nice, if not shy and socially awkward kid. As his fame grew, he didn't let it get to his head. I don't mind TD celebrations, but I've always loved how he'll pull the most ridiculous catch then act like he's ""been there before"". I also respect what a great run blocker he is. Fun fact: in college he caused more fumbles than he had himself.  Thanks for the giveaway, regardless."

MaddenUltimateTeam,3dlhrz,DeezNuts1,4,Fri Jul 17 06:10:31 2015 UTC,Cover two invert gives the safety a yellow zone so you can cover the middle of the field. Just make sure you have athletic corners who can come back to the middle of the field
MaddenUltimateTeam,3dlhrz,ItsBiggy,2,Fri Jul 17 06:32:02 2015 UTC,"My problem when using the FS is I would have the tendency to leave my zone, try using FS blitzes and audible out of it and have free roam of the field."
MaddenUltimateTeam,3dlhrz,Wannabe_Physicist,1 point,Fri Jul 17 06:18:17 2015 UTC,I user my safeties on plays where they are in yellows or flats. In flats cover the quick routes but when those are done go roam for baits.
MaddenUltimateTeam,3dlhrz,joshmcd13,2,Fri Jul 17 06:30:37 2015 UTC,I love usering a player in a flat zone. Most of the time there aren't even any routes to his zone so it's basically like you have a free player to user
MaddenUltimateTeam,3dlhrz,Tdailey3296,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:52:01 2015 UTC,"I only user in the red zone, it's way easier and if you are good at reading plays you will notice a big improvement  your run defence."
MaddenUltimateTeam,3dlhrz,sportsgamerpat,1 point,Fri Jul 17 06:33:45 2015 UTC,"To start out, use cover 2 inverts so you don't have to worry about getting burnt. Once you get comfortable with that and move on to different coverages, here are some of my tips.   Strafe strafe strafe. Take a sec, strafe and read what's going on. Don't start at safety depth. I usually start at about 8-10 yards out. This helps tremendously with the run and you can pick of slants and streaks much easier. Don't be afraid to get aggressive. If you start to get aggressive, I guarantee you'll generate more touchdowns as a result than you'll be giving up. Don't be stupid. Just a general rule of thumb. Usering the safety is somewhat high risk, high reward. You need to stay smart and read the offense, try not to be compulsory.   Good luck!"

MaddenUltimateTeam,3dk8d7,UltimateTeam,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:08:10 2015 UTC,"Hey man, first of all let me just say that I'm jealous of your team. Second, do you run a 4-3 or a 3-4? You are build for a 3-4 with the exception of Mack, but I noticed you have a DT2 showing but not a MLB2, which makes me think you run a 4-3. If this is the case, I suggest you either change your lineup or your defensive playbook. As far as helping your run game, it just takes practice. You have to pick the right running lanes and know when to juke/spin. Also, if you use your fullback a lot, I would suggest upgrading. I use FO Miller and have no complaints. And to stop the opponent's run game it might help if you get more physical corners. That's all I really have to say, so I hope it helps."

MaddenUltimateTeam,3dk8d7,dont_make_cents,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:53:33 2015 UTC,"My best advice for rushing, wait to hit the turbo button. Firstly, especially with a fast guy like CJ2K, you need a split second to let the lanes develop. Also, you can change directions much faster to hit the hole. Once you get to the hole, gun it. Waiting to hit turbo has helped me the most by far, once I learned to wait, a lot of other nuances opened up. I run a lot more controlled, ""calm"" now. Nice team BTW. I honestly had fun with CJ2K, but I don't think he's a very good every down back."

MaddenUltimateTeam,3diw9b,Matthew3358,3,Thu Jul 16 17:09:44 2015 UTC,"Sometimes I will come out in Gun Ace and do the following reroutes: Wr 1 - Streak, TE1 - run block, TE2 - in route, Wr 2- Slant. Keep the PA with the RB who will go into the flats. This absolutely destroys cover 3. If the RB is open (ie with cover 2 sink) you get 6-8 yards. If they are playing cover 3 you hit the slant route because the deep safety/corner will cover the streak and you get about 22."

I do it sometimes, although not as much as I should. Usually, I will re-route the slot receiver if I don't like his route, or the TE if he is already set to block from the huddle.  I went to take the dog out, came back in, and saw you were already loading a second game. I was wondering what happened..."

MaddenUltimateTeam,3dk4d7,owned_at_worms,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:36:21 2015 UTC,"Yea, sometimes the defense I run does send in a completely random nano. It's nothing I do but a combination of what the offense calls too."

MaddenUltimateTeam,3dk4d7,UltimateTeam,2,Thu Jul 16 23:09:01 2015 UTC,I mean if they are nano like less then 2-3 seconds for the sack to me thats cheesy. If it is just a solid blitz that get in after a few seconds then thats all good.
MaddenUltimateTeam,3dk4d7,UltimateTeam,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:37:58 2015 UTC,"It's a solid normal blitz that is super effective that I built a scheme around. Once I blitz you enough to start throwing where I blitz, I change it. It's a super fast blitz and you also have to remember the LBs I have doing it are Gt Mack and UL Lewis. The blitz is the easy part. It only takes two adjustments to do it. The zones and manning up people is what I enjoy."

MaddenUltimateTeam,3dk4d7,bigfatbas,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:09:36 2015 UTC,In my opinion anybody who complains about blitzes shouldnt even be taken seriously. It's part of the game and It's not like it's impossible to stop just throw to the flats. The real cheese plays are when people get instant pressure with 3-4 people rushing no matter how much you pinch your line or send other blockers for help.
MaddenUltimateTeam,3dk2y3,peyton18broncs,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:21:26 2015 UTC,You need a capture card to stream from 360. The One and PS4 have built in Twitch apps that allow you to stream directly. But for last gen stuff you will need a capture card. I recommend the Elgato :)

MaddenUltimateTeam,3djl33,ItsBiggy,5,Thu Jul 16 20:08:52 2015 UTC,I would stick with Brady unless you really want a running QB
MaddenUltimateTeam,3djl33,UltimateTeam,2,Thu Jul 16 20:12:24 2015 UTC,Luck isn't a running QB.  He's a pocket passer who can run if needed.  Sort of like he is in real life.
MaddenUltimateTeam,3djl33,callmeRichard,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:12:19 2015 UTC,91 speed 95 accel scrambler to me
MaddenUltimateTeam,3djl33,UltimateTeam,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:19:11 2015 UTC,"You're focusing so much on two stats you're missing the bigger picture (I'm pointing at the moon and you're staring at my finger).  You're ignoring Luck's 69 trucking, 78 elusiveness, 58 stiff arm, 80 spin, 89 juke, and 75 carrying.  Compare those stats with actual scrambling QBs like Wilson, Kap, Vick, RGIII, or even Otto.  Luck can run when he has to.  But it's not his strength."
MaddenUltimateTeam,3djl33,callmeRichard,2,Thu Jul 16 21:38:36 2015 UTC,Juke and carry solid for a QB you are right but if OP doesn't ever scramble he should just use Brady heck I can get 10-15 yard runs with Brady if the middle is open.
MaddenUltimateTeam,3djl33,UltimateTeam,2,Thu Jul 16 21:39:48 2015 UTC,"I had SB Brady for quite a while before I switched to FE Luck. If you like to scramble every now and then, Luck is the way to go. He does miss a throw every now and then but other then that, he's a solid quarterback. If you're strictly and pocket passer and never leave the pocket, stick with Brady."

MaddenUltimateTeam,3dinsz,Justanotherjustin,2,Thu Jul 16 16:56:37 2015 UTC,Suction tackles wont be in m16. You-tubers who went to E3 and played the game already confirmed it

MaddenUltimateTeam,3dhhi2,UltimateTeam,3,Thu Jul 16 11:06:41 2015 UTC,"If you haven't already and are into cartoons, /u/NeonNytrox recommended Rick and Morty to me and I loved it. Not exactly watching it right now because I killed it in like two or three days, but it was still great nonetheless. Season two is coming out in a week or so too (forgot the actual date), so you can finish just in time for more. It's available on Hulu+ or various Anime sites."
MaddenUltimateTeam,3dhhi2,Lobodomy88,0,Thu Jul 16 13:59:08 2015 UTC,I like American Dad and family guy. You should check them out too. Really funnt
MaddenUltimateTeam,3dhhi2,UltimateTeam,2,Thu Jul 16 18:55:43 2015 UTC,I watch all the episodes of True Detective now I am bored because I have to wait for the new ones. Amazing show

MaddenUltimateTeam,3dhhi2,UltimateTeam,2,Thu Jul 16 11:55:47 2015 UTC,I want to see the rest of S2 but like you are saying S1 was just amazing TV. Season 2 just seems to not be sure where it is going sometimes. I really love both but season 1 is better.
MaddenUltimateTeam,3dhhi2,DeezNuts1,2,Thu Jul 16 11:57:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah you're right, it's still some episods left on season two. Mcconaughey and Harrelson are amazing together but I really like Vince Vuaghn too."

Same with the sets and solos completed?"
MaddenUltimateTeam,3di7pq,Iknowwhereyoualllive,2,Thu Jul 16 16:04:07 2015 UTC,As far as I am aware the loyalty programs do not carry over generations. Meaning any loyalty cards put into sets on the 360 would not be picked up when you start M16 on XONE.

MaddenUltimateTeam,3div91,rthaw,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:02:11 2015 UTC,"It would only be fair of EA to make them available again in the near future. To complete all those player sets and the Master set requires real money for a good 90% of the community, I would say. IMHO, that's reason enough to allow those who barely missed the set such as yourself to compete it."
MaddenUltimateTeam,3div91,WatchMeFumble,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:08:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah, hopefully they bring it back."
MaddenUltimateTeam,3div91,WatchMeFumble,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:12:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I don't think it's fair to not give players another chance. I mean, the promo was in summer. People have lives. AND, they most likely paid some money for this promo."
MaddenUltimateTeam,3div91,mjbland05,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:22:05 2015 UTC,"honestly it's not really even about fair.  If EA thinks their best chance to sell a few more bundles involves independence day badges, they'll do it.  i think it's a reasonable bet that they will release a bundle with them sometime between now and m16's release; probably closer to the release, but they won't want to wait too long i would guess either.  edit: this is not even meant to sound salty; it just makes good business sense."
MaddenUltimateTeam,3div91,WatchMeFumble,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:07:55 2015 UTC,"I agree. For EA, it really is all about the money. But, take my personal experience with the 4th of July promo:  I didn't have the in-game coin to complete these sets by a longshot, so I bought that Old Glory bundle that was 8,000 Microsoft points. I already knew that if I was getting an 85 Jared Allen in Madden '16, I was gonna have to spend real dollars.  Now, I will say this. All those 4th collectibles from that bundle did make it easy to complete most of the 6 players, with selling ones I didn't need and all and using that coin to buy the ones I needed. I managed to get all my collectibles the first day or two and just waited for the set to unlock.  Then, I realized that I was 3-6 badges short. I purchased a few pro packs but didn't get any Ind. Badges. I bit the bullet and purchased the next bundle that came out, thinking I couldn't pull the badges out of Pro Packs.  Point being: I invested a good $100 into the next Madden, and I haven't even paid for that yet, so I believe it is kinda warranted. Not saying EA agrees, just my two cents."
MaddenUltimateTeam,3div91,mjbland05,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:20:37 2015 UTC,"ouch, yea, got it, i hear ya.    not that this helps you now, but i would highly recommend making farm accounts next year.  they are absolutely essential for promos like this.  with 5 farm accounts the free badges from logging in and playing the solos gave something like 90 badges - 18 per account or so.  likewise with the easter promo with the daily eggs.  if i could help you with the final set with the extra badges i have i would (i'm not planning on buying another madden until after 16 because i get too caught up in mut to buy it every year), but everything i have heard indicates that the 85 jared allen won't be tradable."
MaddenUltimateTeam,3div91,WatchMeFumble,2,Thu Jul 16 21:25:01 2015 UTC,"I got my set completed. Thanks, though, but it was /u/rthaw who was short on badges.  I just recently made a farm account out of boredom. I definitely will be using multiple next season. The badges aren't tradable for this particular promo, though, so that wouldn't help."
MaddenUltimateTeam,3div91,mjbland05,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:52:29 2015 UTC,"ah ok cool, glad you got it completed.  it would help though because the players were tradable, so finish the players on the farm accounts & trade the players back to the main account to finish the main set with the badges you have there."
MaddenUltimateTeam,3div91,WatchMeFumble,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:54:11 2015 UTC,"Of course. I was thinking for the actual Master set, though. My assumption was that whatever account the set was completed on would receive the Jared Allen in '16."
MaddenUltimateTeam,3div91,mjbland05,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:57:47 2015 UTC,"yes, correct.  all i'm saying is that with farm accounts it was possible to make all of the players and do the master set if you wanted for 100k coins and no $.  obviously that is based on the cards that i pulled in the packs from the solos; if you got only bears cards it would cost more, but you get the idea.  you would only get the master set on your main account from that; not on every farm account, but you would get enough independence badges to do the master set on two accounts for free."
MaddenUltimateTeam,3div91,mrnegley,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:10:06 2015 UTC,Ea had 3-4 bundles available where you could get extra badges. The badges were also available in pro packs for over almost 2 weeks. There was ample opportunity to get the badges. There's a slim to none chance those badges will be available again. Just like the draft badges. It sucks but take it as a lesson learned to plan collections better in the next madden.
MaddenUltimateTeam,3div91,mjbland05,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:14:43 2015 UTC,"the difference here is that there's probably going to be more demand for these as there's the m16 incentive, whereas there was probably a pretty significant diminishment of return on the draft badges."
MaddenUltimateTeam,3div91,The-Bigdeal,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:28:01 2015 UTC,Doubt it helps but i have an extra bears collectable I can trade
MaddenUltimateTeam,3div91,UltimateTeam,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:52:31 2015 UTC,Maybe a future bundle that's basically your last chance

MaddenUltimateTeam,3dhslw,eaglesk,2,Thu Jul 16 11:30:25 2015 UTC,"3 NFL draft players to look at who put in work and are in the low to middle of your price range... 96 - Amari Cooper 95 - Dorial Green Beckham 95 - Kevin White  My top choice would be White due to his impact blocking...   And as an added bonus without looking people will think he is Fitz (#11 and same hair and build)..   He is an undercover beast, fast also....."
MaddenUltimateTeam,3dhslw,akaCDub03,2,Thu Jul 16 13:59:59 2015 UTC,"Save a little more and get Rice. His stats are nothing crazy at this point, but he plays way above them. He catches everything and turns upfield super quick ,and has the moves to turn a 10 yard play into a 50 yard TD."

MaddenUltimateTeam,3dhslw,ItsBiggy,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:53:04 2015 UTC,I wouldn't mind that but at this point I have other positions at the team that need to be tended to before I spend 100k on a wide receiver.
MaddenUltimateTeam,3dhslw,Imfreakenbad13,2,Thu Jul 16 20:17:21 2015 UTC,I would recommend 96 Amari Cooper. Great receiver and good in the slot
MaddenUltimateTeam,3dhslw,rthaw,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:02:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah I remember looking at him, but didn't like his blocking stats enough. But since then I have gotten a little less picky, he seems like a great pick up"

MaddenUltimateTeam,3dg4oi,WalrusRider,6,Thu Jul 16 00:25:23 2015 UTC,"It's there and anyone who doesn't see it is in denial or doesn't play enough. I was up 21-0 last night and my second AND third string players played 30% of the second half because my starters were gassed after a couple plays. I've played every Madden since 05 and I'd say every 1 in 4 games, I'd blow someone out, but this year that happens once every ten games. You can count on your HB fumbling or the other team getting a miraculous play once you go up by 20. Rant over."
MaddenUltimateTeam,3dg4oi,ItsBiggy,2,Thu Jul 16 01:06:04 2015 UTC,"I know some people think this is true, but this is not the case for me. I'm a 99 OVR and I've faced a TON of scrub teams. I have Boss Bo Jackson. He never gets tired. Flat out, never goes red. The only times he does is when he runs a 70-90 yard play without a TD, and any player would obviously be tired from that.    It's there and anyone who doesn't see it is in denial or doesn't play enough.   I'm top 300, played many games. I've used other pleb RBs, like 97 Ahman Green. He gets tired twice per half. I run 70% of my total plays. I average 20-30 runs per game."
MaddenUltimateTeam,3dg4oi,NeonNytrox,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:49:55 2015 UTC,"I wasn't referring to the RB position. My LB's, WR's, DB's, and DL were all getting subbed out frequently and it has happened many times. I use 94 Jamaal and my experience has been the same as yours for RB's."
MaddenUltimateTeam,3dg4oi,ItsBiggy,2,Thu Jul 16 01:55:44 2015 UTC,Well my defense never gets tired unless they run hurry up. But that makes sense because they haven't gotten time to rest for many plays in a row.
MaddenUltimateTeam,3dg4oi,NeonNytrox,3,Thu Jul 16 02:03:15 2015 UTC,Kinda funny you mention my 99 overall has a lot of trouble with stamina I gotta get some backups now :( I have not had to do that all year
MaddenUltimateTeam,3dg4oi,UltimateTeam,3,Thu Jul 16 01:16:55 2015 UTC,Ive noticed that when I face low overall teams it seems like my players awareness goes down. My O-line will just not pick up rushers on the D-line letting them through for the quick sack. Also on defense my LB's and DB's are usually out of position. Anyone else notice this?
MaddenUltimateTeam,3dg4oi,fape,1 point,Thu Jul 16 12:19:33 2015 UTC,I've noticed this but it's kinda hard to prove compared to stamina

MaddenUltimateTeam,3dgb0q,WorkRedditEqualsFun,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:12:19 2015 UTC,Does anyone know what the deal is if you have EA access? Are they just going to put the game in the vault once it comes out or what?
MaddenUltimateTeam,3dgb0q,Tdailey3296,2,Thu Jul 16 01:55:32 2015 UTC,"Its about 5 months after release,"
MaddenUltimateTeam,3dgb0q,young_sav_mut,0,Thu Jul 16 02:57:46 2015 UTC,That sucks. EA Access subscribers get to play it before it's released though right?
MaddenUltimateTeam,3dgb0q,Tdailey3296,2,Thu Jul 16 03:02:08 2015 UTC,"I believe EA Access subscribers get to play '16 FIVE days early, but only FIVE hours of gametime. That's 5 total, not each day...  http://www.gottabemobile.com/2015/06/15/early-fifa-16-and-madden-16-release-dates-confirmed/  The 5 hours part is maybe 15-20% down the page."
MaddenUltimateTeam,3dgb0q,WatchMeFumble,2,Thu Jul 16 03:38:06 2015 UTC,Why would EA give a $60 game at release when the subscription costs $30 for the year. Of course they're going to delay putting it in the vault.
MaddenUltimateTeam,3dgb0q,mrnegley,0,Thu Jul 16 11:54:59 2015 UTC,If you buy multiple games throughout the year then you need to get the gamer's club from best buy. You've missed out on some of the best deals to get it. Last year it could be had for $5-$15 it's currently $30- I stacked my subscription for 4 years when it was $5. You save 20% on every video game purchase and usually get $10 rewards certificate when you pre-order a game.  With best buy I got the deluxe edition with pre-order bonus packs and $10 rewards certificate for $55.99 before tax. So madden 16 and 48 packs for $60 plus $10. You can get the regular edition for $48 before tax with 11 packs and $10 rewards certificate.  Last year they offered a trade in bonus for madden 14 to get more people to pre-order 15. I think they ended up giving $20 for the trade in bring the cost under $30 for the basic game. If I see they run a similar deal this year I'll post it.

MaddenUltimateTeam,3df1y6,Imfreakenbad13,3,Wed Jul 15 20:30:49 2015 UTC,Same here. He plays really well for me. I've been using him since his release
MaddenUltimateTeam,3df1y6,Teajam,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:37:14 2015 UTC,i wish he was a monster for me lol ):
MaddenUltimateTeam,3df1y6,Itwasaverygooday,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:34:38 2015 UTC,Agreed. That card fumbled so much for me.
MaddenUltimateTeam,3df1y6,Matthew3358,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:10:12 2015 UTC,Just have to use him right. He isn't an every down back at all. Perfect for passes out of the backfield and screens though. One of my favorite 3rd down backs in the game.
MaddenUltimateTeam,3df1y6,aznonprobation,2,Thu Jul 16 04:20:33 2015 UTC,Also didn't like Barry fumbled off regular tackles
MaddenUltimateTeam,3df1y6,LetsTalkMarkets,5,Wed Jul 15 19:49:58 2015 UTC,You need to use a Spell HB so that Barry doesn't get gassed and fumble. All HBs have this problem.
MaddenUltimateTeam,3df1y6,Whalenesss,4,Wed Jul 15 19:50:56 2015 UTC,94 Calvin Johnson. More expensive then 94 Perriman yet worse stats. People who pay just for the name are dumb
MaddenUltimateTeam,3df1y6,Teajam,8,Wed Jul 15 19:55:04 2015 UTC,It's bc they pay for the height not the name   But yeah kelvin is better and he's same height and he's cheaper
MaddenUltimateTeam,3df1y6,Whalenesss,2,Wed Jul 15 20:01:44 2015 UTC,Kelvin is better imo.
MaddenUltimateTeam,3df1y6,skeptical_views,2,Wed Jul 15 19:59:03 2015 UTC,I posted a comp before. He literally is better. They have equal stats for 85% of ratings. Makes no sense.

MaddenUltimateTeam,3df1y6,Gutfoxx,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:40:44 2015 UTC,This is the correct answer.  If Mays is on the field he HAS to be usered or he's useless.
MaddenUltimateTeam,3df1y6,Matthew3358,2,Mon Jul 20 03:13:37 2015 UTC,"Completely agree, mays was trash for me!"
MaddenUltimateTeam,3df1y6,Politipals,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:47:17 2015 UTC,"mays seems to be a hit or miss, Ive seen lots of gameplay and either he jumps routes and makes crazy picks with his 50 something catching (like he did for me) or he gets burned and receivers destroy him on routes.He is a pretty great user, but usering the safeties can be difficult"
MaddenUltimateTeam,3df1y6,expectantsneer,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:41:14 2015 UTC,"Yeah seems a lot of players are hit or miss because I played my brother when he had flashback pollard and through 3 games he picked me off 10 times and I make good reads,I got him and he was good just never jumped anything"
MaddenUltimateTeam,3df1y6,young_sav_mut,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:46:23 2015 UTC,"I would say any rare cards like high end flashbacks don't produce to what they cost. For example, D'Qwell Jackson did not preform very well for me despite his high cost at the time I used him."
MaddenUltimateTeam,3df1y6,Matthew3358,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:09:31 2015 UTC,yeah u/thatdudesly said byrd was dissapointing
MaddenUltimateTeam,3df1y6,young_sav_mut,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:40:05 2015 UTC,I tried UT Brady and hated him(and this is from a huge Brady fan). Sometimes his throw power felt way below his stats but when I threw it deep 3/4 times he'd overthrow it even without leading. Sold his ass and went back to FB Manning who is a fucking wizard with the ball.

MaddenUltimateTeam,3df1y6,VinceCherubini21,1 point,Thu Jul 16 06:06:46 2015 UTC,97 Atwater was the worst for me.
MaddenUltimateTeam,3df1y6,Mutcraft24,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:44:26 2015 UTC,Just picked him up because hes a classic Bronco and was so upset at how little he did for me. Gave him one last game to prove himself and got a diving pick to save the game. id rate him a 6.5/10 but I cant get rid of him because of his height and his user capabilities
MaddenUltimateTeam,3df1y6,Teajam,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:46:10 2015 UTC,"Gt Berry, He wasnt bad but when i had him he didnt live up to that 99 rating."

Great on the run but coverage wise not as great as I thought he would be. Honestly his 93 card had way more picks for me"
MaddenUltimateTeam,3df1y6,joshmcd13,1 point,Thu Jul 16 07:38:13 2015 UTC,Every single Kueckly card had been trash for me.  And UF Berry was garbage as well.

MaddenUltimateTeam,3df1y6,Potated,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:42:20 2015 UTC,Yeah his speed was really his only weakness I guess. And his hands weren't the best.

MaddenUltimateTeam,3df1y6,mr-gillespie,0,Wed Jul 15 23:31:44 2015 UTC,Yeah he also seems very clunky to me.
MaddenUltimateTeam,3df1y6,somesevenyearold,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:45:31 2015 UTC,Lets see... I've moved my team around a lot haha Gave away my whole team about a month ago.. Budget is for sure the eay to go this year.  99 CW DRC (Let me tell you.. This guy is SHIT for how much he goes for. People lit him up the whole time I had him. Went from going thru seasons with 1-3 losses to losing every game. Idfk how but he got beat deep all the time)  99 Revis (Now I know.. I've been told I suck bc I could not make him work.. But when 94 Allen beats you two times in a row on the outside for a touchdown.. You suck at CB for a 99. 99 Woodson was SO much better it's kind of funny)  99 J.Allen  (with those stats.. He should have like 5 sacks on a slow game.. Barely does better than 98 Von Miller.)  99 UL Lott (not boss) (Made Mays look like a god.. Can't play the deep ball alone to save his life)  99 CW Bucannon (Once again 95 Mays is better for 1/5 the price.. 99 HP was not noticable)  97 CW Trufant (Gets beat way too often for 97 speed. His agility was glitchy.. Would often over cut for man coverage and gets shaken easily by defenders. Not as good in the runnin game as I expected)  Honerable mentions: 99 UL Jack Ham(not boss) Levy kills him 98 Mo Wilkerson(and I'm a Jets fan) 92 S. Smith (height is only thing he got) 93 P.Cox (beat deep too easily for ratings)

If you weren't able to score back, then wouldn't that be the reason you lost? Don't get me wrong, I definitely agree with the fact that that was a ridiculous animation, I'm just saying it was only the 2nd quarter. I thought that that was gonna happen and then the game would lag out and you'd get the L because you were losing at the time"

The safest and most effective way to get that kind of coin is to do the gauntlet on your account (or a farm account if you've already done it). Even considering the time that it would take to transfer some key players over, you would definitely have the time. Plus, to make 60k in the gauntlet, you don't even have to play teams thaaaat hard where you'd need to transfer a lot of players over so I think that this is seriously the best option IMO"

MaddenUltimateTeam,3dgjko,Joshvapes,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:40:52 2015 UTC,"Oh also I have another idea. You can do the UL solos. I think there's something close to 60k in there. I'm not sure because I haven't been on Xbox for a few days. And if it's not quite 60k, you can do other solos"

And they'd all have xbox live because of Xbox home gold. Then just transfer them over to your account. The only reason I asked if you have 360 is because I always thought that 360 is the system where you can only do it 5 times

MaddenUltimateTeam,3dgcpr,T3lue,3,Thu Jul 16 01:32:41 2015 UTC,Maybe not worth it for you but no player is good for everyone. I recommend Barry because he is great for me.
MaddenUltimateTeam,3dgcpr,UltimateTeam,4,Thu Jul 16 01:56:22 2015 UTC,"No no no. I'm trying to say he's worth it lol. I know, it was very misleading. My fault. Even if Alfred did put up more yds, 170+ yds is still insane. Especially considering it's only 4 minute quarters. I've had Alfred since he released though. Running with him is like second nature by now. That was my first game with Barry :) Plus, as a Lions fan, I'd NEVER badmouth Barry."

MaddenUltimateTeam,3dgcpr,dskowdley,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:54:20 2015 UTC,Alfred is a hoss. I'd definitely recommend him. Never used Demarco. But Alfred gets some ridiculous animations. Something that happened when I used his gold totw card as well.

MaddenUltimateTeam,3ddseq,EASports_MUT,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:37:49 2015 UTC,Will we see some of these cards on stream? Or are you not allowed to show them?
MaddenUltimateTeam,3ddseq,Pagecrushers,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:41:16 2015 UTC,IDK - I'm not the one streaming so I can't show you my lineup. Maybe /u/jhale92 will show you guys
MaddenUltimateTeam,3ddseq,EASports_MUT,2,Wed Jul 15 14:41:58 2015 UTC,So those players will remain in the lineup? Was wondering if EA would or would not allow that but it seems it's ok! /u/jhale92 you must show the lineup now!

They are licensed players - EA doesn't create players who we don't have the rights to.  They are just two different versions of Jerry and Steve... I'm a sucker for all things Niner.

MaddenUltimateTeam,3df9mv,sandyssandy,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:49:13 2015 UTC,Not sure probably a little over 100k Because the L.T. set is expensive to make. If you got it for 20k thats pretty good i think

MaddenUltimateTeam,3dft1y,UltimateTeam,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:10:45 2015 UTC,Similar but he cheated in that same defense and no QB Walter and Insane backups like his boss Bo backing up. Plus it was for a game. I would go all out

MaddenUltimateTeam,3dffty,Whalenesss,2,Wed Jul 15 22:08:06 2015 UTC,94 Antonio Cromartie is the truth. That 90 awareness really shows up in game and he will shut down the verts with the 98 jumping and 6'2'' height  Edit: I also hate playing Byron Jones but I've never used him

MaddenUltimateTeam,3dfdmi,Tdailey3296,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:55:41 2015 UTC,"I probably should have said around 100k, but pretty much.  QB: Warner  HB: Walter Payton or Le'Veon Bell are close  FB: nope  WR: Garcon, Rice, VJax  TE: Ditka  O-line: Only Webster is under, Dierdorf is close.  FS: Harrison Smith is close  SS: UL Lott  LOLB: D-Ware  MLB: Lambert  ROLB: Aldon Smith  CB: None under about 250k  RE: Jared Allen  DT: None, but 98 Dareus is.  LE: Mario Williams  Okay so I was wrong, but about half the positions have a player sub 100k. About 3 or 4 have a player within about 40k."

MaddenUltimateTeam,3ddua3,UltimateTeam,3,Wed Jul 15 14:30:40 2015 UTC,To stop general y trail I prefer running cover 3 out of 34 Bear simply bc the one hook zone also trails to the left so it follows the slant and then the safety in the hook zone can be usered for the trail route.
MaddenUltimateTeam,3ddua3,UltimateTeam,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:48:09 2015 UTC,best way outta a 4-3?
MaddenUltimateTeam,3ddua3,Matthew3358,2,Wed Jul 15 14:49:23 2015 UTC,I would man up the lolb/mlb on the slant and leave him where he is and then user the trail route.
MaddenUltimateTeam,3ddua3,UltimateTeam,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:06:19 2015 UTC,yeah its kinda glitchy. i usually just bait the two routes. its so hard to stop if they roll out left tho

MaddenUltimateTeam,3df1s4,Teajam,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:36:38 2015 UTC,Sell Jennings in a packers fan to but he's trash. Put Cobb in the slot and buy Fraft Parker for your no.2 WR Dwight Freenny is trash get Ar Mack or his Totw and get CW Millet for your LOLB upgrade Reid to AR Haha or Reid's better card. Sell your RE and pick up 93 Richardson or if you can afford Draft Williams get him. And sell nagata and get 92 wilfork.
MaddenUltimateTeam,3df1s4,Teajam,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:41:59 2015 UTC,Jennings has actually done the best out of the three idk why and alright I'll check mack and miller out
MaddenUltimateTeam,3df1s4,Teajam,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:43:33 2015 UTC,Trust me that's because you don't have Cobb in the slot. If you want to keep him switch him and Cobb
MaddenUltimateTeam,3df1s4,Teajam,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:44:30 2015 UTC,Alright I'll try it what playbook uses a lot of 3 wr formations because I'm using the panthers now and slot is rarely on the field
MaddenUltimateTeam,3df1s4,KehJay,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:45:49 2015 UTC,I use Eagles and it runs mostly out of the Shotgun. So a lot of 3 WR sets. And they all audible to a good run play like zone run and not a stupid draw. And if you use this playbook PA is your friend. Slots over and more are deadly. Good read option plays too.
MaddenUltimateTeam,3df1s4,KehJay,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:49:11 2015 UTC,Sounds like the style I like to run I'll get it
MaddenUltimateTeam,3df1s4,Barronboy,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:50:26 2015 UTC,And a tip is to throw your TE on a deep route to bring up the Lbs so your crossing WRs are open or he will be open on the streak.
MaddenUltimateTeam,3deys1,rthaw,2,Wed Jul 15 19:16:08 2015 UTC,UL NTL AR Woodson GT Browner GT Pat Pete are the top corners your corners are really good I would not worry too much unless you are stacked.

If you are not already you will want to user the MLB and hold the catch button the whole play on defense and follow WRs and TEs and HBs around the field. You will also want to run a combinations of Cover 2 Cover 3 Cover 4 Cover 2 sink and mix in a little bit of man.   For offense you will want to try to be run heavy because you have a large advantage with the oline vs rookie 2nd teams. Traps dives ISO counters are all good runs you will want to try. Passing the ball is difficult because you want to make sure you have a system of ""reads"". On each play there are primary and secondary receivers and you have to look at each and decide which is the best option to throw to.   Good luck"
MaddenUltimateTeam,3ddn9w,UltimateTeam,3,Wed Jul 15 13:49:43 2015 UTC,"I have only a retail XONE at work, but at home I have a PS4. Most of my playing of the game will be at work during my lunch hour, though.  I never thought about just holding the catch button... I figured something negative would come of that kind of action. Shows how much I know!"
MaddenUltimateTeam,3ddn9w,TheCard,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:51:47 2015 UTC,Yeah if you ever want to play thats cool. Yeah holding the catch button triggers the animations and if the ball is in the air most of the time the defender will guide themselves toward it. Somewhat of a downgrade but I learned to user with UF Hester he is very fast and great hands. I played a lot of nickel and had him as the CB3 and usered him. Or you can go with the traditional MLB user very effective. Who is your MLB?
MaddenUltimateTeam,3ddn9w,the_wop,2,Wed Jul 15 13:55:38 2015 UTC,Who is your MLB?   M25 Navorro Bowman. Gotta rep those Niners!
MaddenUltimateTeam,3ddn9w,yoitsmedannyp,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:09:28 2015 UTC,If your holding catch and your a little to far though he'll do the animation and miss the tackle and the pick.

MaddenUltimateTeam,3dcjiv,rthaw,2,Wed Jul 15 05:20:14 2015 UTC,"I've had all three and went back to UF Bo. I'm more of a run towards the defender type of runner, so that made it an easy decision. I've also returned 3 kick offs to the house in the last two days with him, which the other 2 would never do."
MaddenUltimateTeam,3dcjiv,Tissuebox007,2,Wed Jul 15 05:20:48 2015 UTC,"IMO, its Bo or Barry, your choice based on your run style.  Quick and shifty or fast and powerful.  Lynch is a good back if you like power backs, but IMO, he's a less fast Bo that can't catch."
MaddenUltimateTeam,3dcjiv,happymongorian,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:16:24 2015 UTC,"I had honors demarco for about 3 seasons and he was great. Good at everything, my only complaint was his 99 trucking wasn't noticeable. He could still run between tackles but he would go down quick, occasionally giving a second effort.   I had UF Bo for a season and while he was decent, I really didn't like that he kept getting suction tackled in the backfield and could never make it out. Idk if it was user error or not but that was my experience.   Haven't used Barry or lynch but I've heard Barry is a stud. All depends on your style though."
MaddenUltimateTeam,3dcjiv,mjbland05,1 point,Wed Jul 15 05:32:20 2015 UTC,Lynch is best if you need someone to reliably pick up a few yards every run after meeting contact. The other two are probably more explosive.

MaddenUltimateTeam,3dawhv,denvernastay,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:45:17 2015 UTC,Congrats.  I loved that Bruce Carter until deandre levy came out.  That vereen is really under rated too
MaddenUltimateTeam,3dawhv,Royvin,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:17:05 2015 UTC,why is bo not your running back? he is just your kick returner? cause that would skew your value a bit
MaddenUltimateTeam,3dcgvx,Tissuebox007,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:43:38 2015 UTC,"He's pretty solid. Amazing receiver, seemed to go down pretty quick though. If you have used Marshall Faulk, he's really similar to him, I would say he's slightly better. I didn't really like his player model, he seemed too big to big to be so fast."

MaddenUltimateTeam,3dcgvx,Tdailey3296,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:58:35 2015 UTC,"They are pretty different types of players. If you can get your HB in open space a lot, Bush will be great. Just don't expect him to break many tackles. Lynch has enough speed to break a long one and a few tackles along the way, but lacks the elusiveness and moves to really pick up big plays."

I was looking for UL AP or Barry and everyone had them way over value. 350k for Barry when he averages 280 and 500k for AP when he goes for 380k.   Some dude tried to tell me he paid 400k and expected to get 400k back for AP, not understand you'll take a loss buying a guy at market value and selling him back. It's like talking to a bunch of idiots with no sense of the market"
MaddenUltimateTeam,3dav1s,Tissuebox007,0,Tue Jul 14 21:13:59 2015 UTC,Yep totally this guy says all he does is snipe and I about told him yeah um me too but I'm not gonna have an Xbox Messaging pissing match lol. Just sell me the card for 140-150 when I know you only paid 100 - 106k thats good profit still.

MaddenUltimateTeam,3dav1s,Matthew3358,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:37:13 2015 UTC,Yep and I try and be that guy and I keep all my messages and one time a person I messaged about him coming down on a card said nope buy it or get it from someone else messaged me asking me to lower the price on a card. That was priceless.

MaddenUltimateTeam,3dav1s,LetsTalkMarkets,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:22:25 2015 UTC,Yeah I usually know card prices pretty good I work the AH a lot but if I don't know I go off Muthead and Mutmanager. I check both for recent sales and take an avg and put it at that. I flip a lot of cards and it's how I make my coin so I'm not the guy who has to have every last cent.
MaddenUltimateTeam,3dav1s,LetsTalkMarkets,2,Tue Jul 14 23:57:44 2015 UTC,"Rant- Ugh, I hate it when someone tries to negotiate a price for a card that I specifically set at a specific price. Seriously, if I was willing to sell a card for the price you're offering, I would have set it at that price."

MaddenUltimateTeam,3d9edd,jgarcia_2,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:40:22 2015 UTC,87 Payton was so fun!
MaddenUltimateTeam,3d9edd,jgarcia_2,2,Tue Jul 14 20:49:59 2015 UTC,I sold UF Bo when GT Bo came out and wasn't able to get another HB I liked until UT Barry.
MaddenUltimateTeam,3d9edd,nfarber,2,Tue Jul 14 15:44:58 2015 UTC,Ouch the worst mistake I made at HB was dumping my combo of 90 lynch with 93 lacy
MaddenUltimateTeam,3d9edd,ak360,2,Tue Jul 14 15:47:03 2015 UTC,"UF Steven Jackson. Being a big Rams fan, I was sad to get rid of him. He was a stud!"
MaddenUltimateTeam,3d9edd,LetsTalkMarkets,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:26:43 2015 UTC,Bo jr
MaddenUltimateTeam,3d9edd,ak360,2,Tue Jul 14 17:20:47 2015 UTC,"I replaced my Gurley with Walter Payton. I saw that Payton is 1 or 2 up on Gurley in just about everything.   Gurley still performs so much better. He gets at LEAST 7 YPC in my games. I simply cannot replace Gurley. I sold Payton after one, yes, one game. I gave him 20 carries against a mediocre team and he got 45 yards."
MaddenUltimateTeam,3d9edd,LetsTalkMarkets,2,Tue Jul 14 16:46:12 2015 UTC,Still using Gurley too lol
MaddenUltimateTeam,3d9edd,jokerswild2505,2,Tue Jul 14 16:51:34 2015 UTC,"He's the best HB I've used this year and I have no clue how lol. I didn't think much of him originally, the only reason why I got him is because I got Blue and Gold Rams unis and I wanted a Tre Mason and Gurley backfield just because Rams. Good thing I found him, because he is just so damn good"
MaddenUltimateTeam,3d9edd,Bizzlebomb,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:56:30 2015 UTC,I know I bought him just as a snipe looking for mason and he's been my best back
MaddenUltimateTeam,3dape1,EmbryTheHoe,2,Tue Jul 14 20:29:53 2015 UTC,No nudity? That was a selling point for me
MaddenUltimateTeam,3dape1,theathleticjew,2,Tue Jul 14 21:16:58 2015 UTC,The nudity is when Larry Allen fucks volhar that is on the back I thought

MaddenUltimateTeam,3d8d78,aznonprobation,6,Tue Jul 14 08:32:06 2015 UTC,Congrats man. How much in total do you think the set cost you?
MaddenUltimateTeam,3d8d78,Mutcraft24,1 point,Tue Jul 14 08:53:09 2015 UTC,I have had some of the players all year long. I was just waiting to replace most of them. I had already about 15 players that went into the set and I spent about 200K additionally for the rest of the players I didn't currently own.
MaddenUltimateTeam,3d8d78,maplemaster64,3,Tue Jul 14 16:58:45 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure at some point I've used every single one of those cards, never really thought about that"

MaddenUltimateTeam,3d8d78,UltimateTeam,2,Tue Jul 14 18:13:29 2015 UTC,Awesome! He is the best corner I have used this year.
MaddenUltimateTeam,3d8d78,Mccgarringer,2,Tue Jul 14 09:11:32 2015 UTC,Congrats he is an amazing corner
MaddenUltimateTeam,3d8d78,ridemooses,2,Tue Jul 14 11:32:41 2015 UTC,Congratulations dude! I got him about a month ago and he's been great! Even gets me a bunch of kick return touchdowns!
MaddenUltimateTeam,3d8d78,Meggason,2,Tue Jul 14 16:29:24 2015 UTC,Greatest playmaking CB of all time!
MaddenUltimateTeam,3dacsz,Whalenesss,7,Tue Jul 14 19:04:54 2015 UTC,Noooo. We have enough WRs already. A CB would crash the cb market which is easily the most inflated position.
MaddenUltimateTeam,3dacsz,HopkinMyVan,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:20:08 2015 UTC,Who would you suggest as a corner I tried but the ones who came to mind have a fe or movers card
MaddenUltimateTeam,3dacsz,HopkinMyVan,3,Tue Jul 14 19:21:06 2015 UTC,Maybe joe Haden?
MaddenUltimateTeam,3dacsz,Iknowwhereyoualllive,2,Tue Jul 14 19:29:06 2015 UTC,Not a bad idea...I would say maybe cromartie also
MaddenUltimateTeam,3dacsz,HopkinMyVan,3,Tue Jul 14 19:30:12 2015 UTC,"Not gonna happen. Cromartie already has a UL, and a 24h boss."
MaddenUltimateTeam,3dacsz,IAmTheDoctor34,2,Tue Jul 14 19:32:15 2015 UTC,Yeah I can dream...I just wanted a cromartie besides the 94 in my price range
MaddenUltimateTeam,3dacsz,MadeInCanaduh,2,Tue Jul 14 19:33:36 2015 UTC,Or browner. His only card above 86 is a GT.
MaddenUltimateTeam,3dacsz,Tdailey3296,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:34:37 2015 UTC,But his 86 is nice af just wish it was a little faster.
MaddenUltimateTeam,3dacsz,LordOfThenn,3,Tue Jul 14 19:36:41 2015 UTC,"Chris Harris Jr had 0 TDs against him all year, the longest completion against him was 22 yards and he held QBs to the lowest passer rating when throwing to his side, in the league. He deserves one more than anyone at this point"
MaddenUltimateTeam,3dacsz,HopkinMyVan,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:18:12 2015 UTC,Verner could use a 97 at least. Too bad he's short so they won't do that.
MaddenUltimateTeam,3dacsz,LordOfThenn,5,Tue Jul 14 20:09:59 2015 UTC,99 pro bowl dalton please. two pro bowls means he is better than cam newton
MaddenUltimateTeam,3dacsz,HopkinMyVan,4,Tue Jul 14 19:13:11 2015 UTC,EA is biased to mobile QBs but Newton is still better than dalton.
MaddenUltimateTeam,3dacsz,Andrew_2131,3,Tue Jul 14 19:16:35 2015 UTC,I was just joking lmao
MaddenUltimateTeam,3dacsz,bburchibanez,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:57:23 2015 UTC,I thought you were at first but the guy who replied to you took it a step further.
MaddenUltimateTeam,3dacsz,Tissuebox007,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:00:43 2015 UTC,I'm a huge newton fan and I'll say Dalton is a better quarterback hands down but newton is one of the most gifted athletes in the NFL and needs to figure out how to lead a team correctly
MaddenUltimateTeam,3dacsz,sportsgamerpat,3,Tue Jul 14 19:15:14 2015 UTC,A new Matt Forte would be cool or a CB.
MaddenUltimateTeam,3dacsz,mjbland05,2,Tue Jul 14 19:24:47 2015 UTC,A center lol. Go out with that famous EA fizzle.

MaddenUltimateTeam,3d5vap,Bizzlebomb,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:21:01 2015 UTC,savage! what system? ive tried playing on my n64 and im awful its hard lol
MaddenUltimateTeam,3d5vap,Matthew3358,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:12:36 2015 UTC,I put tons of hours into Madden on N64 when I was a kid. I didn't know a lot back then but I pretty much only ever got wheel routes out of the backfield to consistently gain yards. Running seemed pretty much impossible. I made the jump from Madden 2001 N64 straight to 2004 on PS2 and it was like visiting the future. The field felt so much more open and everyone was more agile. I loooved open field running in the old Maddens I am dying for them to bring it back. Its almost impossible to win a game based on offensive stick skills anymore.

MaddenUltimateTeam,3d7kdt,Matthew3358,3,Tue Jul 14 03:22:05 2015 UTC,"Here's some criticism. For starters you do well, but I am going to give you some actual criticism to help you improve.   You talk too closely to your mic. What this does is two fold; firstly, we can hear you breathing into the mic and that isn't fun to listen to; secondly, for sounds like ""p"" or ""b"" it's really harsh sounding when you speak that closely to the mic. You're really monotone. Try to change up the emphasis you put on words to vary the way you sound. When you scored, there wasn't much in the way of excitement in your voice, so it can be a little drab. Most people have this issue. Quit apologizing. You're doing fine, but if you think you're doing bad and you keep bringing it to the audience's attention then they'll follow your lead and you'll lose subscribers that way. Sell yourself, you want the audience to think you're worth spending their time watching, right? You say, ""I don't know a lot"". Either find out the answer or leave it be. For example, you said, ""I don't know why he's so good at kick returns. He just is, I guess"". That isn't a very interesting way to sell that play. You can either not say anything, or say, ""WOW! WHAT A KICK RETURN"" or something like that.  In minute 2:26, you completely shut him down because he was calling the same play. I like that you highlighted that.  Around 3:20-30, I think that was your best commentary. The opponent got a nice sack because it looked like he pass committed and your commentary was clean, concise but you didn't yell or scream or get angry that it was a sack. I like that in yt commentators. Your opponent was trying to shake blitz, I'm surprised you didn't call him out on it.  I like the text joke at 10:20, I thought it was funny you could take a laugh at yourself.   Overall, you're a good madden player. The criticisms are aimed more towards your speaking, which will improve with practice. I subscribed."
MaddenUltimateTeam,3d7kdt,expectantsneer,1 point,Tue Jul 14 06:07:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah thanks. I did realize it sounded monotone, need to work on that. I'll work on all those Things thanks for helping. And what exactly is a shake blitz? Madden first year for me and I hear about it a lot but I've never bought any e books or watching any videos about it so I don't really know what it is."
MaddenUltimateTeam,3d7kdt,expectantsneer,1 point,Tue Jul 14 06:25:04 2015 UTC,"You know how he was constantly was moving his entire defense? That's shake blitzing. It basically is using show blitz then backing up the coverage over and over, which is how he's getting his line backers and DBs to move like that. That's how he got the 4 man pressure on you.   Here's a quick video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYuSMy0Ecfw  Had he done it well, he would have gotten that instant pressure every time but he wasn't that great at it. IT's been in madden since like madden 11."

MaddenUltimateTeam,3d8ely,Gutfoxx,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:42:07 2015 UTC,"i got rid of him for ryan shazier to user and heres my intake. with peppers, he literally shuts down the middle of the field with good position. i was using shazier because that speed attracted me and damn he was good, but a lot of balls would sail over his head and he didnt get the good spec catch teleportation animations that peppers did. one thing i noticed about peppers is that if theres play action and theres a crossing route, even if youre like 15 yards off the receiver he will 9 times out of 10 get you the pick. he doesnt have too many dropped users, just 1 so far since ive repicked him up. shazier just wasnt getting me the production i wanted. a pro to shazier is that he can definitely catch up to receivers or trail them the entire way, where peppers could get beat if you wanted to follow a receiver, however i still like peppers more"

MaddenUltimateTeam,3d7nsh,marlins15ss,2,Tue Jul 14 03:50:56 2015 UTC,I'm going to guess its because there is already so much stuff in the game that they couldn't get all the animations they wanted in and a lot of them look like shit. Either that or they are lazy
MaddenUltimateTeam,3d7nsh,Itwasaverygooday,2,Tue Jul 14 03:52:16 2015 UTC,We are in the 21st century. Where physics engines like Euphoria-Natural Motion exist that allow real time organic physics. Madden is so far behind on this because of the lack of competitors to drive the EA development team to improve gameplay.
MaddenUltimateTeam,3d7nsh,aznonprobation,2,Tue Jul 14 04:14:15 2015 UTC,Roses are red Giants are blue Fuck facecatching Glitches up my ass EA are cunts I preordered madden 16
MaddenUltimateTeam,3d7nsh,HopkinMyVan,2,Tue Jul 14 04:32:15 2015 UTC,Animation based engines are ridiculously outdated.  Which is why they are still around and being used. Why invest in a new vehicle when the 20 year old Honda still runs.
MaddenUltimateTeam,3d7nsh,cush2push,2,Tue Jul 14 04:43:16 2015 UTC,Because dunking a football over the goal post is better than MJD's mamushka dance
MaddenUltimateTeam,3d7nsh,WaimeaNovember1,2,Tue Jul 14 05:32:30 2015 UTC,"It's ridiculous from our perspective because we've become accustomed to advances in practically all sectors of games, but for a company like EA there is no incentive to overhaul it since there'll be people dropping $50+ dollars on bundles every other week. Either way, they can eat a bag of dicks."
MaddenUltimateTeam,3d7nsh,Possum_Pussy,2,Tue Jul 14 05:44:38 2015 UTC,"It is stupid that sports games still have these because it creates an unnatural, unrealistic game. It makes it super easy to exploit the game if the same animation happens(face catching and the stupid spectacular catch).   The reason games don't have it is because it takes time to develop a new and improved physics based engine and the push to get a new game out every year gets in the way of that + it is more costly to the company to attempt something like that, especially if they sell as well as 2k or madden"
MaddenUltimateTeam,3d7nsh,mr-gillespie,2,Tue Jul 14 11:08:30 2015 UTC,It sucks because half of the damn time the animations never work! Or they are OP like face catching or ball hawking
MaddenUltimateTeam,3d7nsh,tmajr3,0,Tue Jul 14 13:44:56 2015 UTC,"Joe:Our crowds look real and our animations are in the game! Wait... I SENT THE PROTOTYPES!!!!! NOO THE GAME WILL BE BAD NOW!  jumps on desks and belts  ""Like a good neighbour State Farm is there!""  Jake from State Farm pops out with a Mcchicken  Jake: What? I'm on my lunch break!   Joe: Your commercials cover the peoples situations no matter what, I need my situation covered. I sent EA my prototype animations and they released the game.  Jake: Bitch you believe in advertisement?  We have your money now! Life isnt a damn comedy show! You are screwed. That said, I bought you a Mcfrisbee! That's covered!   Joe: What about my job?  Jake: They will never know....  Joe: Scammers!  Jake: TOO LATE a magical unicorn appears with Kim Jong Un  I AM MOVING TO KOREA NOW AND LAUGHING AT YOUR FAILURE!  RIDE KIMMY RIDE!  camera fades and scene shows Joe with his son  And thats how babys are made son!  Timmy: But what about the animations?  Joe: TIMMY LEARN SYMBOLISM!  And nobody lived happily besides Kim Jong Un, Jake from State Farm, and the baby unicorn whom they loved and raised. THE END"

MaddenUltimateTeam,3d76i8,Kerk_Ern_Berls,0,Tue Jul 14 05:23:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I was stubborn running my variation of it over and over. He's tough and a cool dude to boot."
MaddenUltimateTeam,3d76i8,Fret_Shredder,1 point,Tue Jul 14 05:28:36 2015 UTC,"Great video man. I've played SDW 3 times this year, and he's beaten me every game. First game he absolutely obliterated me, but that was when I was drinking, and probably shouldn't have been messing around in H2H. Second game, I actually had a 10 point lead on him for most of the game but he is just so difficult to stop on offense like you said in the video. It's almost as if you don't score at least a FG every drive, you're going to lose. His adjustments and audibles just give you a fucking migraine. He's a fucking surgeon out there with Brady, and he doesn't do any roll-out cheese or PAEA, just straight up makes amazing reads and follows his progressions. P0ker and SNAPONIC don't have shit on this guy (#1 and #2 guys on XB1). He might be the best Madden player I've ever encountered, but great gameplay...you could've won had you gone for it.   EDIT: I wish you had beaten him because I really enjoy your commentary. Very laid back unlike ToKe or Cullenburger, but it works for ya."
MaddenUltimateTeam,3d76i8,Matthew3358,1 point,Tue Jul 14 04:31:15 2015 UTC,Yeah it's odd to run into top level competition that plays a fairly straight up game. This was our 3rd game we've played all year and he took the season series 2-1. He's one of the few that has a winning record vs me (besides some 0-1 series). I appreciate the feedback on the commentary too. My goal with comms is to be me and help bring a different view to the game and share my insights. I see the game a little different than most and feel that adding a more strategic commentary into YT is refreshing.
MaddenUltimateTeam,3d76i8,Matthew3358,1 point,Tue Jul 14 05:31:28 2015 UTC,"If you've ever played me then you'd probably think I'm cheesy as well...but the version of PAEA I run (and the one I taught Snap) was so much better and more read based than the simple roll out, rinse, repeat that others do."

MaddenUltimateTeam,3d6ftx,joshmcd13,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:37:25 2015 UTC,"To judge what my pricing should be today (other than >70 ovr silvers):   I price them all roughly the same (silvers 70 and below and bronzes) For DTs as an ex, you need ~80 non-rare cards and your rewards from the set are worth ~120k coin. People completing the set have some of their own common cards which represents their profit. Thus, I set the starting price at slightly less than 1.5k (1.2k since I get >1k per sale) with a buy it now of double. DE set is trickier because LEs appear significantly more often than REs in packs so I estimated that REs are worth at least 2x vs similarly rated LEs. In the case of today's DE set, I came up with a breakeven price of ~1.8k (non-rare REs) so I priced all my REs at 1.4k and 2.9k BIN. Just worry about breakevens calculations and forget what the cards are currently selling for. None of the silvers/bronzes are worth anything outside completing the set which makes for a crazy speculative market. Keep consistent pricing and when your cards become relative bargains you'll profit. If you try to undercut others in the bronze/silver market you might sell a particular card quicker but it will temporarily destroy the market for similarly rated cards and hurt aggregate profits for yourself. Pick a logical strategy and stick to it! Don't undercut for one card and destroy your profits from your other 40!"

Here's the link to the tweet about FE: https://twitter.com/EASPORTS_MUT/status/620590008269963264"

MaddenUltimateTeam,3d7b18,erskipper,4,Tue Jul 14 02:06:32 2015 UTC,Honestly neither is worth it. There's really nothing worth pulling this late in the year. The chances of getting something worth anything is slim. Id say hold on to those coins and buy players straight from the auction house
MaddenUltimateTeam,3d7b18,CAL_ien,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:11:36 2015 UTC,Your best bet at this point is to wait till Wednesday so you have a chance to pull a new final edition while they are at their price peak.  Those are the only things worth pulling right now. Also I would go 7 pro packs. Legend packs are the worst packs of the year IMO

However, I'd line him up as a DT1 and put the bigger DT at DT2 because Donald was being doubled with the LG and C. Still ended up getting a sack with him, so I think it's good for a card at sub 20k."

MaddenUltimateTeam,3d5hmn,UltimateTeam,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:05:34 2015 UTC,"Military I believe. It was a promo that people first abused to get Veteran Packs that included an Alternate Uniform but it then apparently was released into packs as a set collectible (though I've never seen anyone pull it). Madden got wind of it after the first couple of hours of the abuse of getting multiple free packs and put an end to the ""free pack"" sign up and I believe due to the domestic violence cases, P&G (the site sponsors for the program) removed association with the NFL."

I think he didn't deserve one, just cuz he'll probably be cut by the regular season. Also, its kinda bullshit he got a Mover but not Shady or Kiko.

MaddenUltimateTeam,3d5oro,young_sav_mut,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:33:07 2015 UTC,I have been running with small oline and small backs all year and rarely see a bad fame running the ball.

MaddenUltimateTeam,3d5oro,nfarber,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:42:13 2015 UTC,"I think it's Player model and elusiveness, maybe agility.

Bo has an obvious edge on receiving stats (although UL Barry and Boss Barry are both great), but I honestly think you can't get any better than Barry's player model. He's so small and shifty that he very often spins and ducks under tackles and blocks, making him much better for my play style. I have never been very successful with power backs this year though, so I'm probably not the best person to evaluate."
MaddenUltimateTeam,3d4x5e,MtCamany,2,Mon Jul 13 15:42:14 2015 UTC,yeah man i like running between the tackles more with barry than anyone he can fit through any gap.

MaddenUltimateTeam,3d4x5e,yoitsmedannyp,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:55:14 2015 UTC,True...   I run on probably 75% of my plays so for me I can't spend too much on a running back...   For me even 1 point better if I can tell the difference is worth it.... Also I thought the freeze Bo was as good as the UT Barry and they are similar in price...

MaddenUltimateTeam,3d4x5e,blaine64,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:15:10 2015 UTC,I think they are the same Bo vs Barry...  I prefer Bo way more than Barry...  I really think tho it depends on the user between which of these two backs is the better option...  I run between the tackles and if I run outside I never run sweeps or tosses so for me Barry couldn't handle the pounding I put my back thru and Bo usually never gets tackled in the backfield as Barry did for me...   But for someone who uses jukes and spins more often I can see where Barry would work better for you....
MaddenUltimateTeam,3d4x5e,akaCDub03,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:54:23 2015 UTC,Luckily Barry is my backup so I just sub him in... Keep wondering if I should just sell Bo.

MaddenUltimateTeam,3d5oil,UltimateTeam,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:57:40 2015 UTC,yeah i want to but dont think i can  will he get more sacks than an entire dline of 86's?
MaddenUltimateTeam,3d5oil,mjbland05,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:59:03 2015 UTC,Probably not
MaddenUltimateTeam,3d5oil,mjbland05,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:13:24 2015 UTC,"the von cards are very good.  you should be able to grind enough coins for a ~90 ovr dline by doing a handful of rttp solo challenges.  there are lots of good, relatively inexpensive dline players because of all the movers, FE and all rookie players that were released."
MaddenUltimateTeam,3d5oil,Matthew3358,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:06:55 2015 UTC,ok thanks  what if i just grinded for 98 von  i have a feeling that would be better for pass rush
MaddenUltimateTeam,3d5oil,BubetisLife,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:08:24 2015 UTC,"i haven't used 98 von in a 4-3, but 96 totw Suh probably got me more sacks than any other player i've had.  for the price of 98 von, you can probably get 96 suh and 96 von at this point, or at least 92 von; if it was me, that'd be the route i'd go, but 98 von's stats are impressive.    most important thing is to be patient and watch prices on the AH, they can fluctuate a ridiculous amount."
MaddenUltimateTeam,3d5oil,mjbland05,2,Mon Jul 13 19:43:15 2015 UTC,ive had 96 suh and 98 von is even better. 94 speed and 100 FNM is godly

MaddenUltimateTeam,3d5aw1,CAL_ien,2,Mon Jul 13 17:16:13 2015 UTC,Barry is almost a consensus Best. But try and use both for a little. AP is more of a powerback. Barry elusive.
MaddenUltimateTeam,3d5aw1,Teajam,2,Mon Jul 13 17:22:27 2015 UTC,AP is Barry elusive too!
MaddenUltimateTeam,3d5aw1,CrustyTowel,2,Mon Jul 13 23:54:29 2015 UTC,Barry
MaddenUltimateTeam,3d5aw1,UltimateTeam,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:30:40 2015 UTC,Depends on your play style. I had both and found Peterson to be a better fit because he is more of a power back
MaddenUltimateTeam,3d5aw1,Bheld88,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:35:35 2015 UTC,"Barry all the way, I was very disappointed in AP. He never breaks a tackle unless he's within 10 yds of the endzone. 90% of the time he gets taken down very easily, even on tackles 94 Jeremy Hill can break. He does fight for yards running up the middle like a champ, but for 200k cheaper so does Easter Emmitt and he won't fumble 5x as much. AP fumbles a lot, he doesn't break tackles, the only positive things are his speed and trucking, but there are much better options for cheaper so I'd reccomend UT Barry. I did a review of 8 99 ovr HBs yesterday, you should check it out."
MaddenUltimateTeam,3d5aw1,Politipals,-4,Mon Jul 13 17:36:51 2015 UTC,I am not the best player... I think you should give 84 mcknight a try..  He has been my runningback for a while and is VERY good even in pro first  I use him and totw ivory
MaddenUltimateTeam,3d5aw1,Barronboy,2,Mon Jul 13 17:29:54 2015 UTC,lol wut.
MaddenUltimateTeam,3d5aw1,mrnegley,2,Mon Jul 13 17:49:45 2015 UTC,no offense man but those are not very good runningbacks this time of year.

MaddenUltimateTeam,3d5aw1,mjbland05,-1,Mon Jul 13 18:47:30 2015 UTC,mcknight plays better than his stats
MaddenUltimateTeam,3d5aw1,Barronboy,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:25:58 2015 UTC,"Dude, at this point in the game the only reason you should have a below 90 HB is if you just got the game and haven't invested more than 2 hrs into it. Asking about AP or Barry and then suggesting 84 McKnight is like an NFL Scout asking a college coach about a HB and the coach telling the scout his son scored a TD in Pee Wee football. Not even in the same league"
MaddenUltimateTeam,3d5aw1,Politipals,0,Mon Jul 13 18:53:11 2015 UTC,ik it sounds like that but youse him on one drive  he is good
MaddenUltimateTeam,3d5aw1,Barronboy,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:54:04 2015 UTC,"Listen man, I get some cards play better than their stats say, but you can't seriously expect an 84 ovr to be anywhere near a 99 ovr. I'll give him a try later just for funzies, but there's a reason these 99 ovr backs cost 300x more"

But you've got to understand most of us have been playing for months and are at the all madden level which is a completely different game. At pro 1st a 99 ovr HB would be like driving a truck down the field, whereas at the all madden level an 84 ovr HB would be asking for fumbles."
MaddenUltimateTeam,3d5aw1,Politipals,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:06:48 2015 UTC,Yeah 85 carry would get worked.

MaddenUltimateTeam,3d5aw1,Barronboy,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:14:15 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying he's bad, but pro 1st is like pee wee football compared to all madden. Your 84 McKnight is going up against gold defensive players, but going against 99 ovr defensive players he would get flattened like a pancake. I'd be surprised if every run with my 99 ovr HB didn't go for at least 30 yds in pro 1st."

MaddenUltimateTeam,3d39po,dannyboy15,3,Mon Jul 13 05:22:32 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure Youtube is his job. Consdering episodes like this that draw views make him more money he wastes more money on the game to provide content for the viewers. He might also sponsor video game key selling sites like G2A. Also streams where people donate he makes money to put into the game. Or he can probably be  an auction guru but who knows.

Just google it of you want to research it any deeper."
MaddenUltimateTeam,3d39po,Tissuebox007,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:28:23 2015 UTC,Donations and probably ripping packs using the money he makes from youtube.

He doesn't care about his viewers and just wants them to double up on watching him on twitch and the shitty YouTube videos he releases.   Tells people they are donating to a find for his child to Go to college while he spends all fucking day playing games and not spending time with his child.

The big thing that annoys me is that he'll throw an errant pass or two into a lineman's back. I'll give him a full season before I decide to do anything with him though haha

MaddenUltimateTeam,3d2qgb,TunifusII,8,Mon Jul 13 01:32:24 2015 UTC,Just overall H2H players most of the time. Majority of players ran maybe 4 plays on offense I can't remember the last time I played someone who ran a run besides O1 Trap/Strong Power/Counter really those are 95% of the runs that everyone calls it gets old seeing the same animations over and over. On passing it was always 4 verts Y trails PA Fork PAEA and verticals. Then if you stop them the first 3 downs and it is 4th down they just throw it up and convert a ton of 4ths from their own half something you never see in real life. Majority of random H2H players I meet go for it almost every time.   Playing people from here has been a great change of pace and I am glad to be able to play against all of you guys lots of fun. Overall random H2H just is so much of a chore more then fun especially after seeing the same plays 1000+ times this year.

MaddenUltimateTeam,3d2qgb,UltimateTeam,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:31:27 2015 UTC,Blame EA.  They seriously do a shitty job of programming the interaction between the offensive/defensive lines.  I'm a guy who wants to run the ball 60% of the time and thus im basically forced to use 3 runs because the rest dont work even vs fronts/forms that I should be able to run against.  I really feel that people would run a greater variety of plays if the programming was better and there weren't plays that are just OP for no reason.
MaddenUltimateTeam,3d2qgb,skeptical_views,3,Mon Jul 20 03:21:27 2015 UTC,Nm. Solid game
MaddenUltimateTeam,3d2qgb,ItsBiggy,3,Mon Jul 13 01:45:04 2015 UTC,"Playing h2h. The most frustrating part is when your non cheesy, legit offense has to go against someone who sits in cover 3 all game and sends nanos and locks your tackles. Then on defense your absolutely locking them up, but then they break out PA end around, facecatches, and route switching. It's annoying to know that someone who justs looks up exploits is good, while you make good reads and good users"

MaddenUltimateTeam,3d2qgb,Cambyrley,1 point,Mon Jul 13 12:10:04 2015 UTC,"For the first two months of the game, you couldn't choose your own play on defense. The playbooks mess up. Sometimes, when you want to see plays in quarters, it'll show you plays from your base defense, etc. This still occurs. Sometimes, you can't hike the ball so you have to burn a time out. The auction house sometimes has times where it doesn't recognize button pushes so this is what I think happens in game. That's why I think people say their players don't react on defense. Suction tackles ruin the game.  Suction interceptions ruin the game. They nerfed user catching. You see a post wide open, nah actually it's going to trigger an animation you can't get out of and it's actually a pick.  That's why the only real user catch you can do is face catching."

PAEA was annoying, but so many people ran that scheme poorly that it was too frustrating People who just sit in Cover 3 all day are annoying because it makes offense too easy Lob streaks with tall WRs.  Again... more to do with those games becoming one dimensional than with the strategy being overpowered Nano blitzes.  Defenders getting a free release while your lineman blocks no on is pretty awful."

He got ball at half. Ended up winning 30-24 in OT after putting up 24 unanswered. Sherm got a ridiculous pick when I was still down 7 on a crucial play so he basically gave me the opportunity to win. Only reason I didn't win in regulation was because he got a hail mary at the end into my redzone to kick a FG lol.

Look, people have their own opinions and A LOT of people on this subreddit complain about him, but he's just been killing it for me. The only time he messes up is when I do something completely idiotic, not him. His accuracy is SPOT ON and he flies when he runs. I don't see why you wouldn't love him. I've also heard very good reviews for FE Andrew Luck and he falls in that price range"
MaddenUltimateTeam,3d3288,Joshvapes,1 point,Mon Jul 13 05:13:37 2015 UTC,"Mobile: 4oJ RGIII: has great speed and decent accuracy stats but I see him overthrow a lot of passes even within short to medium range.  Pocket Passer: FB Manning: Will turn should be interceptions into huge gains, could probably hit a quarter from 30 yds away. Seriously, this dude is scary accurate. I've never noticed much of a difference in the accuracy of 99 QBs until I played with him. He can literally throw the ball an inch outside of defenders hands to get it to your WR in heavy coverage. Just got UT Brady but thinking of switching back. This is my personal favorite here  Combo: FE Luck, good accuracy and speed. Not the fastest QB, but given space he can scramble for a decent gain. Will also make pretty much any throw you want him to, only downside is that he doesn't have the best deep ball."

I didn't have a fumbling issue with him even after he broke for big runs. Used him for about 4 seasons before switching to legend Bo this weekend and he was well worth the coin."
MaddenUltimateTeam,3d3bua,Tissuebox007,1 point,Mon Jul 13 05:04:32 2015 UTC,He's really good. But he fumbled a lot for me ;/ really good Running back.though
MaddenUltimateTeam,3d3bua,KehJay,1 point,Mon Jul 13 04:50:47 2015 UTC,Really? Hopefully he won't fumble as much with me
MaddenUltimateTeam,3d3bua,aznonprobation,1 point,Mon Jul 13 04:53:01 2015 UTC,"I played with both UL Lynch and Honors Murray. Both ran great. As a pure workhorse I would recommend  Lynch. He broke many tackles and at times would give me animations I have never saw before due to his strength attribute. Never fumbled. Though he would get caught from behind, but who doesn't? Murray was great, but would often have a hard time breaking tackles to get out of the backfield. Moreover, he would fumble in crucial moments, allowing my opponents the opportunity to win. Overall, both comparable great backs but I would rather run with UL Lynch."

MaddenUltimateTeam,3d3bua,Politipals,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:56:57 2015 UTC,"He is really good, but I'll say to my surprise after playing with him, non boss AP, and Easter emmitt among many other 99 ovr backs that Easter Emmitt is better than all but UT Barry. If you want a speed back, get UT Barry, but if you want someone to run up the middle and hold on to that ball like it was his first born son Emmitt is you man. He fights for extra yards like no other back I've played with, and running to the sides he's effective too as you'll see when he throws defenders to the ground with the meanest stiff arm in the game. I didn't think I'd like him a lot, but damn his stats are underwhelming. Honors Murray is good but Easter Emmitt is definitely better"

MaddenUltimateTeam,3d0z8e,pearldrum,3,Sun Jul 12 16:47:06 2015 UTC,"What's gets me the most is when they cheese the whole fucking game, always going for 4th downs and the shitty quick plays with the QB scramble. Then you end up winning and they call you a fuck boy and get all mad. Like seriously fuck off"
MaddenUltimateTeam,3d0z8e,Ol_Dirty_Forty,2,Sun Jul 12 17:57:02 2015 UTC,"QB contain man. It's magic and destroys the scrambling attempts.    I play a lot of 2-4-5 nickle, and that formation puts out two D ends and 2 OLBS on the line. It eats any qb that rolls out or drops back more than 5 yards. Vary vulnerable to the run, but roll out cheesers are not running very often or are not content with 5 yard gains."
MaddenUltimateTeam,3d0z8e,cmaddog111,3,Sun Jul 12 20:17:50 2015 UTC,I have 99 Allen and 99 Bruce Smith they still fail on the contain a ton it is really annoying.
MaddenUltimateTeam,3d0z8e,UltimateTeam,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:20:41 2015 UTC,99  allen does little for me... but my 90 peppers on the outside kills it.
MaddenUltimateTeam,3d0z8e,cmaddog111,5,Sun Jul 12 20:27:10 2015 UTC,"I don't get why people do the downgrade overall plus subs, it does not affect match making in any way. When I was a 90 overall I played 99s and 75s now that I am a 98 I still match up with bronze and gold teams and amazing stellar teams at the same rate. Seems like a waste of time."
MaddenUltimateTeam,3d0z8e,UltimateTeam,4,Sun Jul 12 16:50:53 2015 UTC,When I had my 99 overall I went 1-11. Sold all my linebackers and oline and bought regular legend night train and bo and I'm 10-0 lol I don't think I became that much better a player. I'm a 96 overall now
MaddenUltimateTeam,3d0z8e,Finklewink,2,Sun Jul 12 17:05:29 2015 UTC,Yeah I am not impressed so far with my really high rated players giving up a lot of runs and cannot move the ball on offense.
MaddenUltimateTeam,3d0z8e,UltimateTeam,1 point,Sun Jul 12 17:14:19 2015 UTC,You want to get a game in sometimes add me zFlash3. And idk about that. I think part of it is when I go on a big losing streak and get demoted I play worse players and go on a big win streak. Idek tho matchmaking sucks
MaddenUltimateTeam,3d0z8e,Matthew3358,3,Sun Jul 12 17:12:16 2015 UTC,"Mabey to stop the equalizer?  I notice when the matchup stick isn't showing the speed difference between my wr and the dudes cb, it's usually because the guys team is garbage"

MaddenUltimateTeam,3d0z8e,cush2push,1 point,Sun Jul 12 18:04:22 2015 UTC,Yea those guys are by far the worst. On offence they usually take control of the wr after they throw it deep then then run into the cb pushing him out of position.
MaddenUltimateTeam,3d0z8e,sportsgamerpat,2,Sun Jul 12 18:37:11 2015 UTC,"The worst are guys with multiple bosses that shows they've spent serious $$ on the game, then all their scheme consists of is PAEA and face catching"

MaddenUltimateTeam,3d0z8e,JackFX,1 point,Sun Jul 12 17:29:38 2015 UTC,Sorry. I hate to be a dick. But he had a 99 OVR team. He should have a huge advantage over you
MaddenUltimateTeam,3d0z8e,theathleticjew,0,Sun Jul 12 21:21:23 2015 UTC,Matchmaking is not effected by overall in any way. He was nice to give you a chance by running his lower overall players. If the game filtered match making by overall there would be no inventive to get a better team.
MaddenUltimateTeam,3d0z8e,kingtut211011,1 point,Sun Jul 12 18:31:48 2015 UTC,"What are you talking about ""being nice"". He spent the first 5 minutes of the game pausing to sub in his 99 overall players. People are saying that it doesn't effect match making in anyway, but sure as hell was not nice."
MaddenUltimateTeam,3d0z8e,kingtut211011,1 point,Sun Jul 12 18:36:17 2015 UTC,It was nice to even play the low overall players.

When I had around the same rating I remember using 94 Anquan Boldin and keeping him for a long time. He's not the fastest but his 99 Catch in traffic comes in handy over the middle. He's pretty cheap so with the leftover I'd try to find an upgrade at oline, like AR Martin."

MaddenUltimateTeam,3d1omw,Teajam,1 point,Sun Jul 12 22:17:19 2015 UTC,I thought pause clutching only worked on 360 how does it work on PS4? Why do you have to call timeouts?
MaddenUltimateTeam,3d1omw,LacedGod,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:20:59 2015 UTC,It would reset the clock but then he'd just do it again and I ran out
MaddenUltimateTeam,3d1omw,nemtep,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:22:07 2015 UTC,Well I don't understand what happens. Like with (360) if you don't hit resume fast enough you are just stuck on the pause screen. Pausing doesn't have anything to do with anything on (360)?
MaddenUltimateTeam,3d1omw,DeezNuts1,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:24:31 2015 UTC,It would just keep going around the stadium over and over and the play clock was stuck. Like the stadium cinematic a before the offense calls the play

MaddenUltimateTeam,3d2ftp,foltzie14,3,Mon Jul 13 00:00:47 2015 UTC,"Happened to me one time, usually can stop it every other time.  Basically, there is a glitch where you can pause the game, unpause immediately, and then hit ""cancel"" immediately after that. It freezes the playclock and pause timer basically to where someone can just sit there and fuck with you. Truly obnoxious. I think there's like 3 or 4 different variations of it, but the jist of it is unlimited pause time.  Usually people who are bad at the game or people who have trouble accepting a loss will attempt it. Easiest way to counter it is to resume the game immediately, so when they resume, they can't hit cancel."

Apparently it's something where they do a glitch and it stops the play clock, so they never have to run a play.

A couple weeks ago I sold off my all 99 OL and put money into 99s during the 4th of July promo.  Got UL Lott for like 60k the day the new card dropped.  Sold UL Willis and got 4th D. Johnson, used the coins to buy FS Woodson cheap too.  Today I got 99 Upshaw to start rebuilding my OL and it put me up to 99!"

I like having a ton of depth at corner and safety for sub packages and player fatigue.  2 99 DTs since I run a 4-3, and then some 95+ players aren't worth much at this point.  I just kept those guys for depth or to trade around to try different players out.  I flip cards for coins and make over 100k a day when I work it actively, so the extra coin wasn't a big worry."

MaddenUltimateTeam,3cywrp,TunifusII,7,Sun Jul 12 01:14:01 2015 UTC,Blows my mind people are still willing to spend hundreds on the game at this point in the year. You are literally just falling straight into EA's trap at this point.
MaddenUltimateTeam,3cywrp,Die4MyTiggers,1 point,Sun Jul 12 01:25:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah I was talking to a friend yesterday and said, ""Watch it be a 100 dollar lombardi bundle tomorrow fucking rofl""  And it wasn't Lombardis, but lol at how many people actually threw 100 dollars at this game about a month before it dies. That is the Deluxe Edition of MUT16 plus some other shit."
MaddenUltimateTeam,3cywrp,Kerk_Ern_Berls,3,Sun Jul 12 01:34:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah I love MUT and if someone that plays it as much as I do wants to even spend 100-200 on it throughout the season I totally understand. There are a lot of people that straight up spend $2000-3000 on it and that is just a straight up problem. A lot of them will never even notice the difference in attributes they are paying for its just an addiction.  Like some people admitted to spending over $4,000 and this was back in the spring time. I can't imagine how it would feel knowing you could have gone backpacking through Europe for a month but instead chose to buy virtual cards that will carry zero value in just a few weeks."
MaddenUltimateTeam,3cywrp,Die4MyTiggers,0,Sun Jul 12 01:39:33 2015 UTC,"I don't necessarily have a problem with the amount of money people spend, as I have spent probably 500-750 throughout the year, but I spent almost 100% of that cash from August through March. If you're still buying one hundred dollar bundles a month before the next game comes out, come the fuck on! As badass as these cards are, they are only relevant for one more month!"

MaddenUltimateTeam,3czad1,TheCard,1 point,Sun Jul 12 03:41:25 2015 UTC,Yes. Boss JJ is a good example. You could see he briefly sold for over 2 mil then plummeted. http://www.muthead.com/15/players/6277-j-j-watt
MaddenUltimateTeam,3czad1,zach1209,5,Sun Jul 12 03:45:47 2015 UTC,LE is a very different position. Boss NTL will not plummet.

MaddenUltimateTeam,3d1mws,Teajam,3,Sun Jul 12 20:05:23 2015 UTC,Hey thanks for the Barry recommendation the other day. So glad I got him instead of CW Chris Johnson. He fucking slays. Best coin Ive spent this year
MaddenUltimateTeam,3d1mws,WalrusRider,2,Sun Jul 12 21:10:58 2015 UTC,Man. I heard about him since he came out and I was unsure of the hype. But /u/UltimateTeam kept recommending him. So I'd see it recommended at least once a day. And I was like fuck it I'll try out Barry before I pick up Lacy for cheap. And goddamn does he ball out. Now I just have to grind again for Lacy as my 3rd down back.
MaddenUltimateTeam,3d1mws,Teajam,0,Mon Jul 13 00:04:57 2015 UTC,Lacy is also very good I can imagine him being a great backup against tired defenses. Barry does ball out.
MaddenUltimateTeam,3d1mws,UltimateTeam,1 point,Mon Jul 13 00:09:01 2015 UTC,Yeah I'll probably have 120k to work with so I'm just gonna work on getting lacy

MaddenUltimateTeam,3d0xhb,Zockman175,7,Sun Jul 12 16:30:26 2015 UTC,"You asked ""What do you guys think?"" on a MUT forum. Most will be getting it, there is really no reason not to if you liked MUT. A lot of people haved posted fat paragraphs about how ""I'm not doing it."" Those are just dumb. As much as EA likes to fuck us, it's a fucking we like. People wouldn't be here if they didn't like getting fucked."

A lot of people say the beginning of MUT is the best I personally feel everything before Golden Tickets and Boss cards come out is a waste of time.

MaddenUltimateTeam,3d0tze,Royvin,2,Sun Jul 12 16:09:29 2015 UTC,$5 a month or 30 a year and I know you get to play the game for so many hours before it comes out not exactly sure how many. You also get 10% off all EA Games and Packs.  http://www.ea.com/eaaccess/
MaddenUltimateTeam,3d0tze,njhorn,2,Sun Jul 12 16:11:55 2015 UTC,5$!!! Thats a steal for 10% off packs and early game. Guess Ill be ripping packs for that month Edit: Sorry 1 more Question. Would I get 5% off the deluxe edition.
MaddenUltimateTeam,3d0tze,Royvin,3,Sun Jul 12 16:14:44 2015 UTC,Yes
MaddenUltimateTeam,3d0tze,Iknowwhereyoualllive,3,Sun Jul 12 16:38:09 2015 UTC,You get 10% off any edition of an EA games that are in the vault
MaddenUltimateTeam,3d0tze,Royvin,2,Sun Jul 12 16:44:17 2015 UTC,"You get 10% off of anything EA, don't you? Like you could buy a full game at a 10% discount and then there would be the 10% discount on stuff in-game?"
MaddenUltimateTeam,3d0tze,njhorn,1 point,Sun Jul 12 17:11:27 2015 UTC,Yep 10% anything EA it's really a great deal
MaddenUltimateTeam,3d0tze,njhorn,3,Sun Jul 12 20:07:36 2015 UTC,Ea access on Xbox one will let you play it 3 days early I think for a total of 10 hours
MaddenUltimateTeam,3d0tze,DirkLimpwood,1 point,Sun Jul 12 16:06:34 2015 UTC,How much does that cost and do you know how it works?
MaddenUltimateTeam,3d0tze,njhorn,2,Sun Jul 12 16:09:40 2015 UTC,$5 a month or $30 for the year. I buy the yearly. Benefits: Access to a bunch of games in the EA Vault.  10% off buying EA games through Xbox store 10% off ea points for buying bundles Early access to new releases
MaddenUltimateTeam,3d0tze,jmcd123,1 point,Sun Jul 12 16:36:25 2015 UTC,It's 5 days early for 10 hours.

MaddenUltimateTeam,3d0tze,Warwolff,1 point,Sun Jul 12 17:34:53 2015 UTC,I would guess that with EA Access on the Xbox One you can play Madden 16 like 5 days or something earlier. As they do with all new EA games.

MaddenUltimateTeam,3d0tze,Thatdudesly,1 point,Sun Jul 12 16:09:32 2015 UTC,"It is 3,99 €, should be 3,99 $ aswell, I don't know. It's a monthly thing and there is a vault with some older games like Madden 25 and NfS and stuff, they recently added last years games like Fifa 15 and Madden 15.   You can download the full game 5 days in advance and you can play for 10 hours I think. When you buy the game you can start off where you left."
MaddenUltimateTeam,3d0sv5,Jay33Ajayi,1 point,Sun Jul 12 15:48:39 2015 UTC,"Probably not until august when they are trying to hype it. Last august, Ea did like an hour long twitch stream all on mut, which was pretty cool. Also, about two weeks before launch, the ""ea gamechangers"" on youtube get a copy of the game early and can post content."
MaddenUltimateTeam,3d0sv5,jmcd123,0,Sun Jul 12 15:51:09 2015 UTC,New on what? We already know how rewards will carry and no cards coins or anything transfer over. Points might transfer I forget. I have never bought points so I don't know. We learn ratings once the game/database is out. You can look up some of the draft champions promo videos to see some player cards. What else do you want to know?
MaddenUltimateTeam,3d0sv5,UltimateTeam,1 point,Sun Jul 12 15:50:56 2015 UTC,I was wondering if ratings for players are released early. I noticed madden mobile's reset comes before the release of Madden 16. Will the ratings in that be the same as Mut 16
MaddenUltimateTeam,3d0sv5,UltimateTeam,1 point,Sun Jul 12 15:54:22 2015 UTC,Nah Madden mobiles ratings are weird not like console MUT. Some ratings are in the draft champions videos and more about 2 weeks before release when some people get the game and post MUT packs then MUTHEAD gets full ratings for everyone around then.
MaddenUltimateTeam,3d0sv5,HaveAGreatDay123,1 point,Sun Jul 12 15:59:34 2015 UTC,Alright very cool. Thanks for the info.

MaddenUltimateTeam,3d0s6i,Mccgarringer,2,Sun Jul 12 15:42:03 2015 UTC,He has the stats and I hear he can also play SS at this point in the year why not try him?
MaddenUltimateTeam,3d0s6i,UltimateTeam,1 point,Sun Jul 12 15:43:47 2015 UTC,One of the best strong safeties! I prefer him at SS because it utilizes his hit power a little more.

MaddenUltimateTeam,3cyw41,LetsTalkMarkets,2,Sun Jul 12 01:49:20 2015 UTC,I am going to get some runs in tomorrow. Then I might try to scale down my defense so Lott can get in at HB imagine the speed truck and catch.

Haha really though I wish my players would cutoff routes like this they all seems so lazy. Webster in our game was a revolving door to let Dareus in :(
MaddenUltimateTeam,3d092z,UltimateTeam,1 point,Sun Jul 12 13:08:46 2015 UTC,Wow that's weird. http://www.muthead.com/15/lineups/147890-run-heavy-4-3-4-6 Here's my final team I think. We have similar players and same LB core. Run stopping is insane w ham and levy

MaddenUltimateTeam,3d092z,jhale92,2,Sun Jul 12 14:55:27 2015 UTC,Well yeah but that's more expensive and I run a 4-3. It's good compared to what I upgraded from.
MaddenUltimateTeam,3d092z,Matthew3358,1 point,Sun Jul 12 16:56:54 2015 UTC,i'm guessing you run a 4-3? I'm thinking of switching back because my second mlb never sees the field

MaddenUltimateTeam,3d092z,UltimateTeam,1 point,Sun Jul 12 14:19:11 2015 UTC,I think you might need a 99 cb. Actually you should be ok because of 98 dareus

MaddenUltimateTeam,3cxutq,Bizzlebomb,-5,Sat Jul 11 19:25:00 2015 UTC,This makes no logical sense lol. RS cards can't be pulled in MUT why have those? At least they don't cost anything
MaddenUltimateTeam,3cxutq,jgarcia_2,2,Sat Jul 11 19:33:58 2015 UTC,It's a muthead pack.
MaddenUltimateTeam,3cxutq,Bizzlebomb,-1,Sat Jul 11 19:41:30 2015 UTC,I know but why add players that can't be pulled?
MaddenUltimateTeam,3cxutq,LongtimeLurkersacc,2,Sat Jul 11 19:52:24 2015 UTC,muthead packs add all players from their data base. So for high scores basically
MaddenUltimateTeam,3cxutq,Bizzlebomb,-2,Sat Jul 11 20:04:18 2015 UTC,Oh that makes sense
MaddenUltimateTeam,3d04bb,Joshvapes,2,Sun Jul 12 10:35:53 2015 UTC,"I've always tried to have an O-Line with good AWR so I can't speak from experience, but from what I've read, Linemen with low AWR (like AR Bitonio for example) tend to miss more blocks.  As far as Strength goes, EA stated that it helps with the blocking so a 5 point difference in Strength and an 8 point difference on Awareness could very well be the difference between getting a 20 yard run or a -2 yard run or the difference between having a clean Pocket and having a Blitzer in your face instantly due to a missed block.  The big advantage I see on picking Solder is the +4 Impact which maybe helps compensate his lack of Strength compared with Peters. With that being said, I don't think Peters should be worth 20K more than Solder since the differences are not that huge so If I were you I would pick up Solder and if you see that he misses a lot of blocks, try to pick up Peters"
MaddenUltimateTeam,3d04bb,curuxera95,2,Sun Jul 12 11:56:18 2015 UTC,Awareness is the first thing I look at for my lineman. Second thing I look at is impact blocking. I run a very pass first scheme and need people to hold their blocks. Those stats are the most important imo. Hope that helps.
MaddenUltimateTeam,3d04bb,Scopics,1 point,Sun Jul 12 12:20:12 2015 UTC,Wouldn't it make sense to look at pass block before impact block for a pass-heavy scheme?
MaddenUltimateTeam,3d04bb,blaine64,1 point,Sun Jul 12 16:52:38 2015 UTC,I would take Solder. Using him right now and can't really complain about how he's playing.
MaddenUltimateTeam,3d04bb,Lobodomy88,1 point,Sun Jul 12 11:27:25 2015 UTC,But then why is Peters so much more expensive all the time?
MaddenUltimateTeam,3d04bb,Lobodomy88,2,Sun Jul 12 11:31:06 2015 UTC,Probably because he has a higher overall.
MaddenUltimateTeam,3d04bb,theathleticjew,1 point,Sun Jul 12 12:16:09 2015 UTC,Solder is average. Get Peters. He misses way less
MaddenUltimateTeam,3cyrz3,BVSENUG,2,Sun Jul 12 00:25:34 2015 UTC,"Just a quick backstory, I transferred my 360 Account over to my xb1 account, since I sold my 360. I couldn't buy any players to mule my stockpile of coins over, because I forgot that was a thing. So here I am. Thinking damn, I can't fucking work the auction house with 50 effin coins, should I even play anymore? Mind you I've only worked the auction house and never spent a dime on UT points. But I said fuck it, I'll buy one of these legend card pack things, sell them, and work my way from there. Then....

He flat out shrugged off a tackle from Ronnie Lott and took it to the house for 50 yards. I use him as my power back in the triple option as well as a pass catcher, and he has not disappointed. He is like a faster Steven Jackson who can catch and has a sick spin move."

Nice squad though."
MaddenUltimateTeam,3czscl,Joshvapes,1 point,Sun Jul 12 08:01:10 2015 UTC,I was thinking of getting the Movers Hudson when I can get it for around 10k.  How noticeable of a difference would the TOTY Yanda be over AR martin? Does it justify the price?

MaddenUltimateTeam,3cy474,Politipals,3,Sat Jul 11 20:48:07 2015 UTC,"For people who don't have hundreds of thousands of coins to spend, I bought FO Jamaal Charles today and I like him a lot. He'd be better if my O-Line didn't suck, but I'm working on my O-Line and bought TOTY Frederick and TOTY Boling. Still, Charles is fast as hell and is especially good on counters. In my opinion, I think he should be teamed up with a good power back who can get a 3rd down carry. I use the budget beast himself, AR Jeremy Hill. I love having both of them. So yea, if you're on a budget, make a farm account and do the gauntlet and then you can afford many good HB including Charles and have enough to get a few good O-Linemen"

MaddenUltimateTeam,3cy474,Joshvapes,1 point,Sat Jul 11 22:08:54 2015 UTC,"I agree. Last night before I went to sleep, I checked the market for XB1 one last time and saw that FO Charles was going for 57k. Although that's a nice deal, I assumed there would be a chance he'd go a bit lower. Well I was wrong and ended up buying him today for 62k. Not a big loss, but still slightly unexpected."

MaddenUltimateTeam,3cy474,cush2push,2,Sat Jul 11 22:27:57 2015 UTC,"I've been asking about him so often for the last few days. From what I've heard, FO Jamaal Charles is a lot better. CJ has a higher trucking, but you're not gettin CJ2K for his power stats, you want that crazy speed. Charles stamina is +6 more than CJ2K so he can break a few nice gains and still be good to stay on the field. This is just what I've heard and read. Also, I bought FO Charles today and he's been nice so far"

MaddenUltimateTeam,3czisp,DarthRedimo,3,Sun Jul 12 05:03:47 2015 UTC,"I use UL Lott at FS and he makes a lot of plays for me. Sometimes it's just your opponents playstyle that makes you think he sucks. For example, I rarely throw over the middle of the field, I tend to throw corners, flats, or run the ball. Someone who plays me might think their linebackers suck, when really I just don't throw near them so they have no chance to make plays."

MaddenUltimateTeam,3cz6xc,Teajam,1 point,Sun Jul 12 03:24:34 2015 UTC,Pouncey and Boling.
MaddenUltimateTeam,3cz6xc,Volhar,1 point,Sun Jul 12 03:57:26 2015 UTC,Orlando Franklin and its closer between Hudson and Fredbeard but I'd go with Fredbeard

MaddenUltimateTeam,3cy255,Matthew3358,6,Sat Jul 11 20:29:47 2015 UTC,"It's frustrating. A lot of people who do this ""pack suicide"" almost expect to pull a boss just because they're throwing tons of coin at it. It's all luck. I've only pulled one boss, and it was the 2nd pack of the day, it's just luck.   I don't sell any of my cards to pull packs just because what happens when you don't pull jack shit but you still want to play? I've seen at least 5 people in the last couple months come back and say, ""hey I decided to come back and build a budget squad. If anyone has any cards they could give me, let me know!"" Like what the fuck? You HAD cards, but you sold them to play the lottery. The only coin I spend on packs is the expendable coin I have at the time. If it's 15k, awesome. If it's 50k, awesome."
MaddenUltimateTeam,3cy255,Kerk_Ern_Berls,1 point,Sat Jul 11 20:40:04 2015 UTC,exactly. People make posts and get gifted cards when they sold all their cards off already and then lost their coins
MaddenUltimateTeam,3cy255,owned_at_worms,0,Sat Jul 11 20:52:36 2015 UTC,"I haven't really complained, I know it's a gamble. Thought I'd have a shot pulling 260 packs so far today but no luck. Probably have about 20 packs left after I sell last couple of cards.  And I won a 99 Lacy today and declined it to save it from me putting it in the ah. It's Bo or bust for me today."

MaddenUltimateTeam,3cy255,NordicDong,3,Sat Jul 11 22:18:56 2015 UTC,People expect pulls and then when they don't they are understandably upset. I think it is easier to avoid packs entirely.
MaddenUltimateTeam,3cy255,theathleticjew,2,Sat Jul 11 20:41:22 2015 UTC,"This is going to sound insulting, but I promise I don't mean for it to be.  I think there is a lot of young MUT players who haven't yet learned their lesson on gambling."
MaddenUltimateTeam,3cy255,LongtimeLurkersacc,0,Sat Jul 11 21:53:48 2015 UTC,"I mean I'm only 15 and I don't expect shit. I hardly ever open packs. If I do I spend a tiny bit of money I made, at least then I don't think of it as much as a return on investment, just some added coins. Like when I first got madden this year I pulled a 90 totw Bruce carter in my only pack it was so worth it because I thought it was so much bc this is my first year playing. Now I'm 99 ovr with like 30$ spent and in AM1!"

MaddenUltimateTeam,3cyek5,qpx,1 point,Sat Jul 11 22:19:58 2015 UTC,I just go for a lot of swats when ever the ball is in the air and it seems like the offense can make a play. Sometimes the WRs just get ridiculous catches and I do my best to swat it out of their arms it really helps when you have high zone/man coverage.
MaddenUltimateTeam,3cyek5,UltimateTeam,2,Sat Jul 11 22:23:02 2015 UTC,I tried it going for swats and it made it 10 times worse. I never get animations and sometimes I get this glitchy animation where my defender runs to the side and then he just falls and it's a touchdown. When I'm throwing deep passes their defenders often jump with me and knock the ball of out of my hand or my receivers just straight up drops it. I would be happy just being able to do that where I at least have a chance to cause a drop but it's like my players are in high school or something they just get dogged.
MaddenUltimateTeam,3cyek5,UltimateTeam,1 point,Sat Jul 11 22:31:57 2015 UTC,Dang thats ridiculous I don't know what to do then.
MaddenUltimateTeam,3cyek5,UltimateTeam,2,Sat Jul 11 22:32:41 2015 UTC,Damn dude this sucks. I enjoy playing this game but it's no fun getting beat by bullshit every game.  Lob streaks and my game freezing are single handedly ruining this game for me.
MaddenUltimateTeam,3cyek5,Kdings,1 point,Sat Jul 11 22:36:08 2015 UTC,Yeah the guys that throw streaks every down are no fun to play.
MaddenUltimateTeam,3cyek5,Kdings,1 point,Sat Jul 11 22:37:31 2015 UTC,Hold down L2 while you swat or go for the pick and you'll get more animations.
MaddenUltimateTeam,3cyek5,DarthRedimo,1 point,Sat Jul 11 22:41:56 2015 UTC,L Trigger I think.
MaddenUltimateTeam,3cyek5,theathleticjew,1 point,Sat Jul 11 22:43:47 2015 UTC,99 receivers used to cost over 300k and now they are cheap.

MaddenUltimateTeam,3cxpap,Bizzlebomb,1 point,Sat Jul 11 18:47:16 2015 UTC,"Oh sorry. Idk if you've seen the other posts I've made the past few days. They've gotten a lot of comments and people seemed to like them so I just assumed people would know what I'm talking about. I'm doing this thing where because it's the end of MUT, everyone can name players they went through this season. For example, for quarterback, I went from Chase Daniel, to Matthew Stafford, to Style Peyton to 4OJ RG3. And we'd do it day by day with a different position. 2 days ago was QB, yesterday was HB, and today I want to do WR, except I don't want to make it too long (like this post lol sorry) so I want people to just name their #1 WR instead of their whole receiving core. Sorry for the long explanation, this was the best way I can describe it fully."

If you pass 20+ times a game, he probably will have a few bad passes, but if you ground and pound, and drop the occasional play action, he's perfect. It also helps that I sniped him for 92k. Not much of a crazy snipe, but still, I went all in to get him and then did the gauntlet for the second time and I don't regret it at all. I love him"

The goal of calling out Elites on hover and the pack score count-up is to increase the anticipation factor. Since you're not actually getting anything, I put a lot of thought into how to make the experience as exciting as possible. I've watched a few people streaming the pack simulator, and they seem to find their Elites, and slowly open them last, then watch the pack score fly. Definitely the kind of thing I was going for."

If not you could see if anyone has the collectible lying about (although thats fairly unlikely) but you would have to trade all the cards over and it would be quite tedious. They rereleased the ph solos a month or two ago if i remember correctly, but with the rerelease of the UT solos it is possible they will do it again. Stay hopeful but i would concentrate your efforts elsewhere right now"

Don't pull packs and then get nothing and feel like breaking something. 1.3 mill is soooo much more than a LOT of people have including myself. I know this game is basically done, but still, you can build a CRAZY nice squad with that. Just my opinion. I don't even think you should open half and then build with the other half because if you don't get anything with the first half, you're prob gonna just blow the other half on packs and have nothing"

MaddenUltimateTeam,3cw6ib,Royvin,1 point,Sat Jul 11 11:01:43 2015 UTC,After you buy a card you want it to be as expensive as all mighty hell that way you could exchange and possibly make money. Maybe he wanted to switch to UL barry eventually but if legend bo falls below ul barry he can't do that.
MaddenUltimateTeam,3cw6ib,kingtut211011,1 point,Sat Jul 11 13:43:55 2015 UTC,I don't see legend Bo falling below UL Barry unless they make UL Bo as simple to get as UL Barry.

MaddenUltimateTeam,3cw6ib,kingtut211011,1 point,Sat Jul 11 14:58:52 2015 UTC,When Barry came out there was a bundle for $30 I think that gave you 2 pieces toward the set so the market was flooded with prices and everyone under cut each other I built UL Barry for 180k that weekend
MaddenUltimateTeam,3cw6ib,Royvin,1 point,Sat Jul 11 15:12:00 2015 UTC,Besides there is no garuntee bo will be better than barry

I might just start a new account and transfer my dudes over because I've done two season in am1 and I have to win with my defense.

Like yall can talk through it and find out what's going on in her head and what made her decide to do something like that. Like if she was drunk, you know shit can happen. But if she wasn't then you should dig into the relationship and figure out why she isn't satisfied or why she feels she needs to go to other guys for attention. And if you are busy with work and can't provide that attention the two of you can work out a solution together. Communication is key brother. The answer may be something that you don't want to hear, but it's a lot better than having to deal with a horrible situation like this."

MaddenUltimateTeam,3cuhyp,Kdings,1 point,Fri Jul 10 22:16:36 2015 UTC,That would be pretty cool expensive though.

MaddenUltimateTeam,3ctfl6,theathleticjew,2,Fri Jul 10 17:13:00 2015 UTC,RIP in Pepperonis :(
MaddenUltimateTeam,3ctfl6,Teajam,4,Fri Jul 10 17:50:59 2015 UTC,Try to run near the sidelines so if you do fumble it can go out of bounds.
MaddenUltimateTeam,3ctfl6,UltimateTeam,3,Fri Jul 10 17:08:27 2015 UTC,"Yes. And If you run a lot and don't sub in your backup when Ivory is tired, you'll have fumble issues. I had UT Lynch with his 98 carry and was fumbling all the time. I never subbed in my backup until the computer did it for me. Now I rotate my HBs and don't have a big problem with fumbles unless I get blasted by Atwater or Lott. Lol"

MaddenUltimateTeam,3ctfl6,ItsBiggy,3,Fri Jul 10 17:26:38 2015 UTC,"Do you keep chew clock on? I did it at the beginning of the year and I averaged a fumble a game. Don't know if there is any correlation, but it seemed like it"
MaddenUltimateTeam,3ctfl6,cdj5xc,3,Fri Jul 10 17:31:20 2015 UTC,"Coming from a guy who practically never fumbles (once a season, maybe), I seriously believe that ball security is an underrated skill in the Madden community.   There are a lot of things you can do to affect whether or not you'll fumble. Here are a few I think help me the most:   When your WRs receive the ball, you can tap X/Square to have them limply fall to the ground. Never let your WR get hit throwing over the middle.  Same idea and control mechanics when you scramble with your qb Unless you see that your player has a huge size/strength advantage, avoid direct hits at all cost. I see too many people hoping to truck their opponent and run head on into contact If you are forced to face a dead on collision, definitely avoid sprinting into it. Sprinting + hitstick = ""you're gonna have a bad time"""
MaddenUltimateTeam,3ctfl6,callmeRichard,2,Fri Jul 10 19:13:10 2015 UTC,Try a HB with high elusiveness even if their carrying stat is low.  I think it leads to fewer hard hits... FO Jamaal CHarles never fumbled for me and his carrying wasn't great.  And UT Sanders has never fumbled for me at all (high carrying and elusiveness).
MaddenUltimateTeam,3ctfl6,Toad930,2,Fri Jul 10 20:09:23 2015 UTC,Rotate your running backs. Carry about 3 backs and sub your starter out when he's tired. There's always a random factor though; I watch my brother use UT Barry and he fumbles on arm tackles somewhat frequently.
MaddenUltimateTeam,3ctfl6,GridIronGreat,2,Fri Jul 10 20:14:52 2015 UTC,Do u have back ups on your Oline? I noticed this when I didn't have backups

MaddenUltimateTeam,3ct3yj,semishock,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:52:08 2015 UTC,Exactly this for me.  I got the $60 version with the extra packs.  The most I'm going to spend on MUT is those extra packs.  Hold onto the packs until special promotions and just build my team through AH like I did in M15.
MaddenUltimateTeam,3ct3yj,ScreaminDemonLp,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:11:00 2015 UTC,If its anything like Madden 15 you can't stockpile the free packs you get. You have to use them in a week I believe

MaddenUltimateTeam,3csuly,WalrusRider,1 point,Fri Jul 10 14:33:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah, only thing about DJ is his low jumping. I'm thinking about getting Davis when I round up the coins, hopefully my silvers sell."
MaddenUltimateTeam,3csuly,UltimateTeam,1 point,Fri Jul 10 14:35:05 2015 UTC,Nice I had Demario he did very well off and on user control
MaddenUltimateTeam,3csuly,UltimateTeam,1 point,Fri Jul 10 14:36:28 2015 UTC,DJ is great if you user around the field. I can feel comfortable usering a different position knowing that he can hold it down on his own

MaddenUltimateTeam,3cqd98,Politipals,3,Thu Jul 9 22:51:49 2015 UTC,"Ended up winning 21-0 after the guy rage quit in the 3rd quarter, capping off an undefeated season. I'm done posting about SPD Brady now  Also, this game winning play with 11 sec left in the 4th of a playoff game  http://gfycat.com/ZestyEdibleKoala"
MaddenUltimateTeam,3cqd98,SHanKeRSauRx,1 point,Thu Jul 9 22:54:33 2015 UTC,"I have no clue how your so good with him, I've had  2 60+ yards games in the season I've had him, and there was 3 30 yard games but In the rest I've only got like 10 yards (probably because I have the worst fumble luck and I'm too worried to fumble so I don't even try to juke and because I have no patience and once he can't get anything I just bust out vick lol)"
MaddenUltimateTeam,3cqd98,Matthew3358,1 point,Thu Jul 9 23:09:07 2015 UTC,"its awesome and he really is good with them, but it seems like some of these dudes are god awful at stopping read option lol"
MaddenUltimateTeam,3cqd98,Matthew3358,1 point,Thu Jul 9 23:12:02 2015 UTC,"They are, and the read option is hit and miss. If it works then Brady's gone, but a lot of the time he'll get dropped after like 5 yds and fumble. I also don't abuse it as much as it may look, I play the way I normally do except for throwing passes over 15 yds, but mix in the read option and scramble a tad more. That way the defense doesn't expect it so often"
MaddenUltimateTeam,3cqd98,SHanKeRSauRx,1 point,Thu Jul 9 23:16:09 2015 UTC,yeah.sounds like youre using him decently. it was easier to run read option with otto g than 99 rg because they always bite on it with otto. with rg3 i have to run up the middle alot to set up read option
MaddenUltimateTeam,3cqd98,garrettk10,1 point,Thu Jul 9 23:17:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah, they probably are just bad  but when I was using him in one of the games i got 63 yards and the guy I was playing was really good (nice non-cheesy offensive scheme, great users( he baited tf out of me one time), had defense for every run in my playbook except read option and 01 trap occasionally and he had some nice blitzes and he made good adjustments) he probably just didn't realize that brady had 95 speed and he probably figured that I'll eventually fumble with brady"

MaddenUltimateTeam,3cra17,Matthew3358,3,Fri Jul 10 06:25:03 2015 UTC,3-4 means three down linemen and four linebackers  4-3 mean four down linemen and three linebackers  Let me know if you need any help.
MaddenUltimateTeam,3cra17,moist_salad,1 point,Fri Jul 10 08:01:25 2015 UTC,but i can help you alot. 4-3 means you have 4 defensive lineman(two DT and ends.) you want your  ends to be quick pass rushers and you want your DT to be able to rush pass and stop run. you want good coverage linebackers. 3-4. 3 d line. you want big guys with good run stuffing abilities.4 linebackers. OLB need to be good pass rushers and still good against the run. (much like 4-3 end)
MaddenUltimateTeam,3cra17,BigOrca14,2,Fri Jul 10 03:32:54 2015 UTC,"Adding on to this comment, 3-4 outside linebackers play really well as 4-3 defensive ends (Von miller, Aldon smith, etc). Switching up you defense is key. It's easy to dot up a guy sitting in cover 3 all game, if you toss in some cover 2 and the occasional blitz your defense gets much better. Also on offense the biggest problem people have is picking one reciever and staring down that route, try making reads and not forcing the ball"
MaddenUltimateTeam,3cra17,Matthew3358,1 point,Fri Jul 10 03:40:18 2015 UTC,"One thing that will make you a better madden player is creating an offensive scheme and sticking to it.  Since you have RGIII, you might want to create something like a run n gun scheme, a balance between runs and deep bombs that spaced out the field by having 4 wide receivers and a running back in the back field.  Good playbooks for these include the saints, Eagles, and the Broncos.  Alternatively, you could go with a heavily centered run playbook, which you could pull off by running a variety of options with RGIII, counters and cutbacks, and outside zone plays.  The run can set up pa passes to get quick yards.  Good playbooks for this include the Eagles, panthers, Redskins, and the 49ers.  Hit me up if you need anymore help."

That shit is way too important to ignore.

MaddenUltimateTeam,3crt8n,Noyps,1 point,Fri Jul 10 06:56:23 2015 UTC,"On Muthead, it shows that Charles has +6 more stamina than CJ2K, but 8 less trucking and also some other stats. It's a pretty close call, but CJ2K is a bit cheaper so he might be who I go with. Have you played with either of them?"
MaddenUltimateTeam,3crt8n,Bizzlebomb,1 point,Fri Jul 10 07:05:32 2015 UTC,I played with both and Charles was a lot better. I felt like that extra stamina helped for his longevity on longer drives. I would get Charles
MaddenUltimateTeam,3crt8n,KingDurantula,0,Fri Jul 10 09:13:53 2015 UTC,I used both and Jamaal was better for me as well
MaddenUltimateTeam,3crt8n,KingDurantula,1 point,Fri Jul 10 11:06:33 2015 UTC,Cw Dmc is a budget burner. He's been a beast for me
MaddenUltimateTeam,3crt8n,KingDurantula,0,Fri Jul 10 08:10:42 2015 UTC,"Is he fast too though? Because I compared him to AR Hill which is who I'm rocking right now and they seem pretty even. I just want someone fast as hell, u know? My favorite thing in madden is to break off a HUGE run and Hill can't really do that for me"
MaddenUltimateTeam,3crt8n,WeDemHawks,1 point,Fri Jul 10 08:12:06 2015 UTC,He has 97 speed and acceleration. He's always been able to break off huge runs outside on counters for me
MaddenUltimateTeam,3crt8n,TangerineDiesel,0,Fri Jul 10 08:15:54 2015 UTC,"Does he feel it though? Now I'm seriously considering getting him. My main concerns are if he feels as fast as his stats say or if he runs like a power back. For example, Jeremy Hill has 95 speed, but I don't really feel that way. Another concern I have is the fact that Darren McFadden has an 85 injury rating. That's significantly lower than all other running backs I named. Have you had any problems with him getting hurt and also fumbling?"
MaddenUltimateTeam,3crt8n,MrT-pitythefool,1 point,Fri Jul 10 08:41:42 2015 UTC,"In 10+ seasons he's fumbled maybe 2 times and has never been injured. You can definitely feel the speed once you get him running up the side line, his accel also makes for a nice stutter step and juke"

MaddenUltimateTeam,3crrr0,yoitsmedannyp,1 point,Fri Jul 10 12:35:10 2015 UTC,I have a hard time believing this. Against single blocking they should be peeling pretty easily regardless of who it is. As soon as you hit the scramble button the dl has an easy time disengaging unless they are being double teamed
MaddenUltimateTeam,3crrr0,jgarcia_2,1 point,Fri Jul 10 12:50:32 2015 UTC,im not kidding i know its hard to believe but its what just happens i tried a bunch of right end and 98 von miller and 96 khalil mack i just want to know what everyone else uses for their right end

MaddenUltimateTeam,3cpvoq,modrewgnu,7,Thu Jul 9 20:38:23 2015 UTC,"This is why I hate the ""but espn 2005 was the best football game ever!"" bullshit. Yes, it had a half time show. The same half time show that I button mash to skip because I don't care about it and I doubt that many people care about it. The dynamic camera and the player lock in M15 was a waste of time and resources and almost everybody that plays competitively turned it off.   So all this focus on ""presentation"" is a waste of resources. If there's suction tackling in next year's game because they didn't know that the presentation stuff is cool for the first week then everybody button mashes to try to skip it, I'll be a little upset.   I wish Madden would realize that the ""espn 2k5 was the best video game ever because of its half time presentation"" goons are always going to hate madden no matter what and just focus on improving the physics engines and game play issues for those of us that want to love madden but can't because of the horrible glitches that arise because we're so focused on camera angles."
MaddenUltimateTeam,3cpvoq,expectantsneer,4,Thu Jul 9 20:56:04 2015 UTC,It can't be that good if Phil Simms is still commentating
MaddenUltimateTeam,3cpvoq,theathleticjew,4,Thu Jul 9 20:54:24 2015 UTC,"I realise most people are going to be concerned that gameplay improvements are taking a backseat to oreeentstion, but I'm actually glad to hear this. For a few years now that stadium environments have felt a little sterile, and it never really feels any different playing in Soldier Field or whoever the hell is sponsoring Seattle's home now (Century Link?). Seems like this is a step in the right direction on that front."
MaddenUltimateTeam,3cpvoq,DragsyTwoSeven,2,Thu Jul 9 22:47:13 2015 UTC,"Completely agree, gameplay should be the focus but if they can make the stadium environment authentic then it can only help the game, it can also create more realistic gameplay if you actually notice the 12th man because there are more false starts when you play at the seahawks"

MaddenUltimateTeam,3cpvoq,Juribe91,4,Thu Jul 9 21:57:36 2015 UTC,Thats cool and all but I am way more concerned with how the game actually plays and if they have fixed players not reacting to the same things over and over.
