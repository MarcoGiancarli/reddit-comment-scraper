DJs,3dzm58,bigchipshi,4,Mon Jul 20 23:51:13 2015 UTC,This all depends heavily on the direction you want to go in and what your ultimate goals are.  What scene are you getting into?  What type of music do you produce?  Are you planning on dj'ing too or only producing?  Are you looking for home speakers or for speakers to use when you play out at parties?  What kind of parties?    The more you can tell us about where you are currently and where you plan to go will help us to answer all of your questions.
DJs,3dzm58,bigchipshi,2,Mon Jul 20 21:10:39 2015 UTC,I want to get into the electronic music scene because I produce Dubstep and some electronic music but I wouldn't mind changing it up a bit. I plan to be both a DJ and producer but mostly a producer. I already have some home speakers so I'm gonna need some speakers for small parties. I'm not gonna be playing at raves or huge parties anytime soon haha so I guess like family and/or friend parties.
DJs,3dzm58,dj_soo,0,Mon Jul 20 22:25:10 2015 UTC,"The best value for speakers are going to be the ev-zlx 12s.  Be sure to buy the active powered ones and not the passive version which require a separate amp to run them.  Those will run you $300-$400 each, cheaper if you can find used ones.    You're probably going to want to get a sub too if your doing anything bigger than house parties.  But subs are tricky, first off you need to be able to transport them.  So unless you have a large vehicle, your going to have to get a smaller sized 12"" sub.  EV has a value priced 12"" sub called the zxa1 which is great on size and will run you about $600.  Yamaha has the dxs12 which will give you significantly more power at $650, but is also considerably bigger in size.    For djing hardware and software.  I would suggest that you not go with the traditional format of djing using a mixer and some form of turntables (vinyl, CDs, or modern midi controllers).  Since you're going to be producing anyway, become more familiar with perfoance pads which can be utilized for both producing and djing if you use a program like abelton.  Djing in the traditional sense is a whole other beast on its own and will take a lot of time and dedication to become even remotely decent on the decks.  But I'm getting the idea that that's not what your looking for anyway."
DJs,3dzm58,dj_spin,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:09:12 2015 UTC,"that zxa1 isn't going to make a dent paired with the ZLX12s - which are pretty quiet to begin with.  They were designed to pair with their 8"" zxa1 tops and even then, a single isn't the greatest - better off with two.  I'd at least look at a 15"" sub to pair with 12"" tops."

DJs,3dzm58,Tjhendrix,0,Mon Jul 20 21:20:18 2015 UTC,"My biggest advice is if you're just getting started, go look on the local used sites and don't blow too much coin right off the bad. Enough that you can get the basics going. If you're looking to play clubs, get a couple of CDJs and a simple mixer - You can probably find an old DJM-600 cheap that will help you transition to a 900 nicely.  Or if you want, drop all the $2k right off the bat and if/when you end up giving it up a year down the road, be a sweet deal for someone like me looking to upgrade gear. (joking of course... or am I?)  Point is the real investment is the time for honing the craft and learning the basics. Being able to drop all the money on all the best gear is pointless if you don't know how to use it. And until you've got a real sense of whether you enjoy it or not I wouldn't recommend dropping ridiculous amounts of coin right away.  Fuck, I got started 10 years ago on some dying gemini turntables and a rundown Numark mixer I got for 400 all said and done. After that it was all building a record collection and learning the music. Then when I emerged from the bedroom, it was all learning how to read and work a crowd. Nowadays I'm starting to see where my technical limitations really are, so it's become more about the gear and the tools. But don't dive right into it thinking you can be a master right away because there's a lot of stumbles along the way."

DJs,3duv7z,PeteyWinkle,5,Sun Jul 19 18:26:21 2015 UTC,In the same room?  Probably nothing you can do.  Best practice would be for everyone in the room to monitor through headphones but you'd probably want to hear the mcs in the mix rare than just you DJing.
DJs,3duv7z,dj_soo,2,Sun Jul 19 22:08:31 2015 UTC,Yeah the mcs were listening to my beats through headphones. I didn't need vocals in the phones since I could hear them out loud. It was just hard to hear myself and it made transitions a bit tough
DJs,3duv7z,FourAM,5,Mon Jul 20 01:12:49 2015 UTC,"Learn to DJ with only headphones. It will come in very handy in many situations, as you've just seen.  Personally, I can't beatmatch as well if I don't have my master channel in my headphones."
DJs,3duv7z,ebbomega,4,Mon Jul 20 02:04:54 2015 UTC,"Headphone mixing is a solid skill to have. I'm constantly surprised by how many DJs I come across that freak the fuck out when they don't have proper monitors. Don't get me wrong, they're nice to have, but I've played way too many janky venues (especially restaurants) with crap booth sound. If you can headphone mix, you're sorted no matter where you play."
DJs,3duv7z,dj_soo,2,Mon Jul 20 07:04:34 2015 UTC,I was the opposite for a long time where I could only beatmatch with an external monitor.  It took me close to 12 years before I started practicing how to mix in my headphones.

DJs,3duv7z,r08zy,1 point,Mon Jul 20 10:54:06 2015 UTC,"So could you hear the MCs in your headphones?  The best gig setups I have played on have the DJ mixer and monitors for the DJ only, the master out from the DJ mixers runs into another live mixer which has the mics connected to it and in clubs it's monitor output goes to the stage monitors (in your case it would go to a headphone splitter/amp and to the MCs headphones.)  I also mix in my headphones a lot of the time (I learnt this by wanting to mix late at home when I was learning and couldn't have my speakers on). I have played some smaller gigs where the MC mic is plugged into the DJ mixer so I could hear the MCs in my headphones... not good."

DJs,3dtztp,nuglo,12,Sun Jul 19 13:23:14 2015 UTC,"The main problem is that actually taking a controller or club is seen as unprofessional. Professionals are seen as people that can use the house 2000s with usbs just like the other djs. Although you may just prefer to use controllers at the end of the day DJs are super judgmental group and will most likely write you off, like how people using virtual dj are treated.  I would say that the DDJ-SR is a solid controller and maybe it might be worth upgrading to some second hand CDJS to use with traktor or serato."
DJs,3dtztp,beachedazd,2,Sun Jul 19 13:47:09 2015 UTC,"Ah fair point. I've been reading a lot online, and people are saying due to the nature of the XDJ setup, the learning curve of going from that to some CDJ's would be a lot less than an SR per say. Because theoretically I would have all my music on USB's and formatted for Rekordbox, so if I needed to I could step on to some CDJs I could.. to some extent. Agree/Disagree? I'm still pretty new to this and not too stubborn to shun contradictory opinions haha"
DJs,3dtztp,beachedazd,4,Sun Jul 19 14:00:37 2015 UTC,Its a good piece of inbetween kit. Will give you the confidence and skills to just drop into house gear but not cost the earth. However its key that you don't get dependent on how the waveforms are stacked and beatmatching off that because thats a sure fire way to go down in flames at the club.  I was in a similar situation to you in terms of upgrading (went from DDJ-SB to DDJ-SX) and felt that the SX was close enough to 2000s  but had enough flexibility in terms of house parties and what not with the built in hardware mixer. In the end I picked up a second hand ddj sx mk1 for $650.
DJs,3dtztp,Kyderra,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:16:57 2015 UTC,"Agreed,   I have a XDJ-R1 (the old version of RX) and I can just take my USB stick to use it on a CDJ 2000.  And if it comes down to it for a house warming party at a friend, I can take my mixer to it as it's a lot more portable then a 2000 set.   It's still heavy, but it fits in a giant backpack so taking the bike is actually an option.  Some buttons might be in a bit of a different position but overall if you can mix on a RX, you can mix with the other pioneers that allow for a USB stick."
DJs,3dtztp,ebbomega,2,Mon Jul 20 15:08:28 2015 UTC,"This is what I see as the correct answer.  The idea here is - how much are you interfering with the other DJs? That's what will get the other DJs rolling their eyes. If you bring out your controller and you've gotta shuffle aside all the CDJs so you can make room for your controller, and that's all gotta happen right when it's time to changeover, the other DJ will get pissed. If you just show up, throw your laptop on, plug into the SL4, pop in your timecode discs and boom, you're ready to go, nobody will bat an eyelash.  I find 95% of being a professional DJ is showing up to soundcheck. Like, honestly, that's most of it. Then you can bring your setup, make sure that you can do a seamless transition from whatever other gear the other DJs have, and be ready to go when it's time for your proverbial needle to drop. Until you're big enough to demand a rider or have roadies to do the work for you, that is the best way to make it all go down.  Storytime! One time I got asked by a local group who was putting on an event if I would DJ a dance-party on the first night of the event. They're not typically DJ-literate; their idea of music for the night was some volunteer playing a playlist on shuffle off iTunes - worked for most of their purposes. However, they wanted to do something different, and I had connections with their scene, so I get hired. In checking with them on their system they say the venue has a house system I can plug into. Well, when I get there two hours early the house system was a hotel conference room system, essentially designed for voice projection and absolutely no bass. I bring in my gear in, and the sound is shite. So I say ""fuck it"", it's still a bit early, so I run off to L&M and rent a couple Yorkville monitors - not a lot but enough to make a party happen. This is all still well within my budget with the amount they're paying me, so I don't really think anything of it.  Before me is a couple guys who had a ""mobile kareoke"" thing they wanted to do. Well, they have a couple stumbles to get it going, realize the speakers they brought are not enough, and we try to power it through the gear I had just brought. After half an hour of hassling to get it going from their end (not nearly enough power nor the right connectors to get hooked into my system), they get about two or three songs in and finally decide that their system doesn't give enough juice to really get enough sound of it. They should have been going for 45mins at this point, and they just nix it, and say ""Alright, you go for it.""  At this point the crowd had dwindled quite a bit, kinda gotten discouraged by all the mishaps. So, I throw a track on, knowing full well how my system is going to react to what I've brought, and within 5 minutes of them throwing in the towel, there is a whole dancefloor of people rocking out.  Afterwards the organizer of the event came up to me, thanked me profusely for saving the party, and commented on my professionalism. The fact that I had the foresight to a) go and make sure everything worked perfectly before my set time was supposed to happen, b) knew what I had to do when I discovered the sound wasn't working and took the steps to rectify it, and c) knew how to get the party going once I was put in the driver's seat.  Thing is, the gear I used had nothing to do with the professionalism there. It was entirely attitude and ability to make sure that they get what they're paying you for. THAT is what makes a professional."
DJs,3dtztp,ebbomega,2,Sun Jul 19 19:53:37 2015 UTC,"PS: The XDJ-RX looks real sexy from a standpoint of being able to transition from your home studio to a club, especially since you'd just be able to (theoretically) pop in a USB stick and away you go, but for personal controller use I really like the DDJ-SR. A whole ton of advantages with the Serato DJ software that it brings. From the standpoint of someone who already knows how to operate a club setup (and typically uses serato when playing out), I would much prefer the SR in my studio over the RX. But, to each their own. As I said, the real advantage that brings is that when you go to the club you just need a USB stick or two (provided they've got the CDJs to support it of course)."
DJs,3dtztp,ebbsc,5,Sun Jul 19 20:00:15 2015 UTC,"For you, XDJ-RX will be the best of both worlds, learn to use USB and then get the ""professionalism"" of rocking up to a club and dropping into their house CDJ2000 system, and the convenience of an all in one to take to a bar if they don't have their own system.  As much as I love my CDJ900s/DJM800 setup, not only would I kill for some of the DJM900 features, when I'm taking places it really is a ball ache (even in a wheeled flight case). I think it weights about 30kg all in."
DJs,3dtztp,oinkbane,6,Sun Jul 19 14:10:09 2015 UTC,"Will I get laughed off stage for using a XDJ-RX?   Fuck no man, I think they're sweet as hell!  Besides, who the fuck cares what you're using as long as the music is good? I remember once exchanging nervous looks with the promoter when our ""special guest DJ"" turned up with some tiny little budget controller and a beaten up laptop to play to 1000+ people, but he played on of the best sets I'd heard in years."

DJs,3dtztp,playap0wnr,3,Mon Jul 20 17:36:23 2015 UTC,"I think the XDJ-RX is the exception to the 'CDJ Eliteist' mentality. It's literally two XDJs and a mixer smashed together. Is it a controller? Yeah, but you can't get much closer to using the ""real thing"" than that, so that gains a lot of respect (for me, at least). As one of the other commenters said, the XDJ-RX will also let you learn how to use a CDJ/DJM system so that if they're available to use in a club, you can use them with little to no hassle.  If I were in the market to get another controller, the XDJ-RX is one of the only ones I'd look into."
DJs,3dtztp,pantan,2,Sun Jul 19 15:27:59 2015 UTC,"I'll be blunt, there aren't many circumstances where bringing a controller is seen as professional. This is coming from a guy who's been playing out for a few years and works as a sound and lighting tech at a big club.   It's a good training ground, theres no reason you need a nexus setup at your place, and it's easier to transition than it was for me with Traktor. But honestly as long as you can beat match by ear, you're going to be all set."
DJs,3dtztp,marymelodic,2,Sun Jul 19 15:27:49 2015 UTC,"If you're doing a gig at a club that has CDJs, you won't need to bring your XDJ-RX - the layouts of the two are similar enough that you should be able to mix on CDJs with no problem.  If you're doing a gig somewhere that doesn't have its own equipment, the XDJ-RX will definitely look professional enough. My only concern would be the difficulty of getting it to the event. The XDJ-RX weighs 8 kg (18 lb.) plus the weight of the case, whereas CDJs are 4.5 kg (10 lb.) each. A DJM is 7 kg (15 lb), but it's fairly small."

Make sure you are there with time to set up without inconveniencing the crowd or the other DJs. Make sure you are prompt, professional and on and on.  Granted, I run in the underground and nobody gives a shit as long as you play good music, and do it well.

DJs,3dqzx1,flipperkast,13,Sat Jul 18 16:49:18 2015 UTC,"AFAIK He's using those Launchpads two different ways. The left one to trigger samples (2:50, 4:45, 9:35) and the right one for a MIDI effect (3:13) like Stutter Edit (and the mixer for FX too). Since he doesn't have headphones on, I have to imagine that he has the Clip Quantization adjusted for whenever he triggers samples since he is obviously not beatmatching anything. You can also tell he (probably) has follow actions configured in Ableton because of the constantly blinking lights on the left launchpad. Those are ""queued"" clips set to automatically play after the others are done (in case he fucks up). In addition to all this, I would think all the music he is playing is pre-warped in Ableton, as well as detuned to harmonically mix with all the other stuff he is playing. So, he did some MIDI mapping for the FX (for the Xone mixer and right launchpad), assembled a harmonically-mixed playlist, and adjusted settings for each sample to cover his ass. I'm probably missing some stuff, and in fact, could be totally wrong, but these were all educated guesses."

DJs,3dqzx1,TheSilvermanCometh,4,Sat Jul 18 20:27:00 2015 UTC,"Personally before buying another launchpad I would buy something with faders and knobs if you don't have one. It would give you a much better control over volume and eq which would make mixing much easier than having to use the mixer function of the launchpad to control volume, fading in and out,  etc.    That being said, I think he is using his left launchpad for songs and his right one for one shots effects etc. A blank clip with no sound can still contain midi data and instructions, so by running one track into another track with a dummy clip, you can use that clip to trigger beatmashers, reverb,  automation you wrote out before... Etc."
DJs,3dqzx1,TheSilvermanCometh,2,Sat Jul 18 18:30:02 2015 UTC,Thanks for the info! I do have 2 CDJ's 400 and a DJM400. The thing is that after 4 years those CDJ's became quite boring to mix on and I don't have the money to buy me a pair of CDJ 2000. I also have an Oxygen 61 Midi Keyboard so I can also map some knobs. But thank you very much :)
DJs,3dqzx1,pokeyjones,2,Sat Jul 18 20:25:38 2015 UTC,"Ohhh.... OK, I have a better idea of where your at now!  Mcgillicudy did a much better job explaining the dummy clip thing than I did, so I'm glad that worked out.   I was going to mention 1 other trick you may enjoy.... Check out launchpad95, it's a script for the launchpad that adds  tons of functionality. Lately I've been using the step sequencer to create drum loops live for whatever I'm mixing in serato. Two launchpad's running the script would be much more interesting than cdj's for sure."

DJs,3dqzx1,dj_soo,4,Sat Jul 18 20:51:06 2015 UTC,"How do you play such a DJ set?   I tend to be fairly blunt and often sound like a dickhead, take with a grain of salt.  DJ'ing is (typically) not about equipment or technique or mixing like so-and-so. In fact, traditional dj'ing is simply impossible without headphones. Given the same setup I could teach my senior citizen parents how to ""launchpad dj"" on that thing and sound pretty ok their first go of it. To me what dude is doing is like figure skating, there's no real sport or danger to it, you just go out there without opposition and do your rehearsed routine of stunts for praise. Now, do you really want to spend your time ice dancing when there are sports like hockey and speed skating where you can get your dick hard for a bit?   If you want to be a dj totally take off your blinders about dj'ing, flush your head completely, focus on the music, focus on the music, focus on the music. DJ'ing is interaction and crowd reading and predicting and creating drama and creating... something new. Are you a competent dj feeling contempt for the world tonight? Instead of playing your usual house play a set of 90's Florida Bass. Make them pay, they'll love you for it.   You know how you like the good songs from any genre? You know there's speed metal you like, hip hop you like, jungle you like, reggae you like... good music is just plain good music. And that is what your dj sets need to be.   Learn how to beatmatch, learn it from the ground up. Then instead of deciding what to buy, you'll decide which tools you need to do your thing.   get busy child!"
DJs,3dqzx1,djfil007,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:04:15 2015 UTC,"Thanks, that really was helpfull. When I DJ myself I don't trend to hop on the bandwagon like Big Room, Deep House, Future House, etc etc... I just do my thing. I always play some Future Bass or like Neo 90's/80's synth music and people never complained about it being bad music. You always have some of those guys who dislike the music because if it's not in the Top 40 radio hits, they don't like it but to be honest most of the music on the radio is pure crap. Shitty produced but only because someone famous is singing a vocal for it, it sells millions.   And yea I see what you mean with focussing on the music. Been using Ableton for 3 years now and finally it's getting somewhere. Thank you for this wake-up call and helping me and all the other DJ's out."

Thing is Madeon and Porter Robinson are using original content, that they created from scratch.  this is more towards the line of what would be known as Live PA (live performance artist).  2 launchpads would likely mean that you now have 16 tracks available at your fingertips at one time, instead of 8 at a time (and needing to scroll around to select which ones you want to control)."

I didn't like Serato to much, take a look at dJay.  Does the same thing only different.  If you can afford the money and can use OSX I would say a macbook Air is right up your alley.  If not go with an Asus, they have been making some quality products.  I am a PC master racer through and through, but OSX just does some wonderful things.  Like others have mentioned, getting a good spec'ed ultraportable for $1200 that is better than an Air is going to be a challenge.

DJs,3dq9ww,ShiftyAsylum,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:57:12 2015 UTC,"The value for the money has been really good for a long time. The marketing gimmick by Microsoft is that it's impossible to get a laptop from Apple for less than a grand. The reason, however, is that Apple doesn't make a laptop worth less than a grand because they refuse to make cheap (as in quality) products. This means that no matter what you get from Apple you get a high quality product. THAT is the power in Apple branding.  I got a Macbook for DJing because of that - I don't want hassle with my laptop, I just want something that works. MacBook Pro provides that.

DJs,3dpoku,smellybulldog,6,Sat Jul 18 06:13:05 2015 UTC,"The vast majority of pro riders for mixers include the DJM900nexus, followed by either the A&H xone92/db4 (quite often in EDM this is actually requested first - John Digweeds rider has a DB4 for example), then the DJM2000nexus, and finally the DJM900 SRT (mostly stateside in open format clubs).  Most of the major stateside & international venues rent their mixers locally if an artist requests anything other than a 900nexus.  As for CDJs, no question - it's the 2000nexus - 2 to 4 depending on setup/who's booking.  Most artists carry their Serato interfaces with them if they use it, however if you want it already in the booth - your best bet is an SL4.  Then again, if your budget is large enough, and you're using a live sound guy/booth (you mentioned having a sound background)..get two or more mixers and sum them both in the sound booth over XLR - just bring up whichever mixer is in use and have both up during transitions. This is what most festivals do now with multi dj setups that aren't just DJM900 + CDJs"

Any DJ will feel comfortable playing in your booth.  Plus a Serato SL4 and the equivalent Traktor box.  As to the the debate between the DJM 2000 and 900, It's your call. As the proud owner of a 2000NX, I'd go the the 2000 even if it's overkill (it really is), but the 900 is badass in it's own right.  Your call."

Configuring Traktor well can do more for your DJing than spending an extra $100 in a better processor.  You'll get better performance if you use the audio card of whatever DJ hardware you are using.   If you use the computer's onboard audio card and, for example, the controller audio card at the same time (this is sometimes the default option in Traktor), the load meter will be almost full. Use just the most powerful audio card that you have available (which will almost always be the DJ hardware one)."

Not every crowd is the same; one might like actual mixing and such, one might just want to dance to the right tunes and hate that the DJ is messing around with the tracks.

When it comes to mixing, when it's in the middle of the night I always mix out in the second chorus, if not the first.  You'll bore a crowd real fast if you play a song start to finish.  I learned that many times when I first started playing."
DJs,3ditku,sinetwo,2,Thu Jul 16 22:50:00 2015 UTC,Mixing out at first chorous keeps the crowd guessing and on fire (if you play the right stuff). I love good reactions when people can't sit down cause there's too much hype being thrown at them :-) I guess they're used to start to finish mixers
DJs,3ditku,dj_soo,7,Thu Jul 16 22:53:00 2015 UTC,it kind of depends on the crowd.  Some crowds will be pissed if you mix out too early of their favourite tunes.  It all goes back to reading the crowd and seeing what they're into.
DJs,3ditku,ClownTaint,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:46:16 2015 UTC,Mixing out of the first chorus all night sounds like a nightmare. You'd practically have to have your entire set planned out in advance. There'd be no time to dig.
DJs,3ditku,sinetwo,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:20:39 2015 UTC,"Well the entire night means you play like 40 songs in an hour or so. That gets tiring (for both the DJ and the crowd).

DJs,3dll8v,_Be_,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:43:26 2015 UTC,That's redundant (and therefore may degrade sound quality a bit). Why not plug the SL3 into the mixer or plug your turntables into his DDJ SX without the SL3?
DJs,3dll8v,dj_soo,2,Fri Jul 17 20:24:14 2015 UTC,Probably because he wants to use timecode
DJs,3dll8v,_Be_,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:36:02 2015 UTC,The DDJ-SX has 2 stereo input pairs with phono preamps. What's the problem?
DJs,3dll8v,dj_soo,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:59:53 2015 UTC,Sx doesn't support DVS - only the sx2 - so he still has to use the sl3
DJs,3dll8v,dj_soo,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:27:50 2015 UTC,"If the sound card has phono preamps, it does. Whether Serato lets you use it is another matter."
DJs,3dll8v,illGATESmusic,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:26:31 2015 UTC,What? No it doesn't.   Having preamps means it can play vinyl nothing more nothing less - doesn't mean it supports DVS which the sx does not.  Meaning he has to use the sl3 as the serato playback device and use the sx as a standard mixer.  The sx2 will allowed direct plunging in of the laptop to the controller and give you full DVS control - the sx does not.
DJs,3dll8v,illGATESmusic,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:31:46 2015 UTC,"Not sure what you meant by ""the mixer"" also if he had a DDJ-SX2 then it would have been perfect but he had the DDJ-SX which doesn't support DVS plugin (at least I don't think)"

DJs,3djv5z,pfunkk,2,Thu Jul 16 21:22:43 2015 UTC,"What is your budget?   Honestly if you know the foundations of DJing well you don't need to have either of anything. Having played on CDJs, Traktor and Serato now there isn't much of a difference in the basic functionality of how music is played. There is small differences at the very core of the program but playing tracks is essentially the same.  If you want the CDJ 'club' feel then I'd go with what others have said. The XDJ-RX is a controller that uses Rekordbox and if you want to learn to use CDJs in a bedroom setting it is a solid controller. Otherwise you could get a XDJ-1000 setup with a mixer. The XDJ 1000s are great because you can also attach them to Traktor or Serato if needed.  If your budget is sub-1000, then I'd suggest getting a DDJ-SX/SX2 for a CDJ feel provided in Serato. It's my goto controller for gigs where I need to bring my own gear.  Between venues the equipment varies. I've played at pubs where you just plug in your own gear into the house (they have no gear there), and other clubs have a pair of dusty Tech 12s that are probably broken and a mixer. Most clubs will likely have a CDJ setup, and possibly other options (DVS/Timecode, for example). Knowing at least 2 systems of DJing well is a good tool to have. If you really want to be versatile you could just lug a controller everywhere and plug it into the house system as it calls for at each venue."
DJs,3djv5z,Methionine,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:07:52 2015 UTC,"My Budget is flexible so that does not really matter. I won't like spending over $2k but with CDJ's I would wait until I could get good deals on a used pair probably.  I am pretty torn between a mixer/cdj combo and a Pioneer controller. I like the club feel of owning the CDJ's but wonder if it is a better idea to own the controller. The XDJ-RX Could be one of the better ways to do it right? It is portable and still shows me the CDJ Feel, but does it have the same functionality?   Rekordbox can still be used with a laptop or flash drives right?"
DJs,3djv5z,thereallazor,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:55:05 2015 UTC,"one thing about the XDJ-RX that you may want to think about is that you lose the modularity that comes with a CDJ setup and is considered a pretty big benefit to it. an initial CDJ setup is pretty steep but since you can swap out the components individually you shouldn't have to spend that much on it ever again(except for some of the high-end mixers), whether it's because something breaks or you want to upgrade. As a bonus, if/when you upgrade the CDJs in a CDJ setup, the old ones can serve as additional decks if you want to do 3 or 4 deck mixing.   That said, an XDJ-RX is probably the cheapest gateway to the feel of a high-end CDJ club setup, so it's not a terrible choice, but it does have its caveats."
DJs,3djv5z,Methionine,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:49:29 2015 UTC,I think I will be going with the CDJ setup! Thanks for all of your help
DJs,3djv5z,Jet_Set,0,Fri Jul 17 14:36:27 2015 UTC,The functionality is nearly identical. The layout is similar to what you find in an actual CDJ setup in a club. I haven't played with an XJD-RX at all so I can't give much on how it performs but at first glance it seems like a happy medium. My biggest gripe is the lack of upgradability (although it's something you will find with every controller). I don't like how you are locked to 2 decks on the controller and cannot expand to more than 2 inputs.  As for Rekordbox it is the track prep software for Pioneer CDJs. I prep my tracks on laptop and export to flash drives.
DJs,3djv5z,SequenceBros,2,Thu Jul 16 23:07:13 2015 UTC,I like the idea of being modular with the CDJ and Mixer setup. I think I will be keeping an eye out for deals and going with that. Thanks a ton for all of the info.
DJs,3djv5z,gigabyte898,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:36:02 2015 UTC,I just got a pair of the pioneer xdj 1000s and they are pretty sweet. They have all the functionality (and then some) of the 2000 nexus for half the price. They are the same size but with fewer buttons. They compressed everything on to a touch screen to compensate. You just can't use cd's anymore.
DJs,3djv5z,Junkymix,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:32:10 2015 UTC,"The Denon DNS-1200 is about 6 years old now, but it plays CDs, USB, is a midi controller/soundcard, and has a built-in timecode control tone for some reason. My only beef is with the jog wheel, but it's overall a solid unit. It's also tiny compared to a Pioneer CDJ."
DJs,3dj8k0,sckaterbean,2,Thu Jul 16 18:37:36 2015 UTC,"What do you use for DJing? Mixemergency for Serato DJ is just the thing you might need. I use it exactly like you described.  I have my sample banks loaded with visual videos and I usually pick a new one for every track. Mixemergency has insane amount of effects. Many of them are beat synced too, meaning that the visual will actually look like it has something to do with the audio.  You can also midi map almost anything, so I guess a Nanopad wouldn't be a problem."
DJs,3dj8k0,Dzlsh,1 point,Fri Jul 17 09:59:26 2015 UTC,"A combination of Magic Music Visuals and AutoHotkey might work.  If the nanopad is also triggering audio, you will need something to split the MIDI signal since Windows will only send the MIDI info to 1 app at a time."

Hopefully they will one day bring Bridge to Serato DJ but I've heard nothing from Serato about them doing that.  Before anyone suggests it you can't use Jack Audio or Soundflower either because Serato will only speak to a Serato approved audio interface and won't even give you the option.  You can either run 2 interfaces and plug the one Ableton outputs from into the line in of the controller. The downside is you potentially get the latency of both interfaces stacking up.  The better option is to use the ""interface sharing trick"" of setting Ableton to output from the same interface as Serato. You can't process the sound through Serato this way but it prevents latency issues."

DJs,3dgh79,reddit1reddit1,1 point,Fri Jul 17 06:01:25 2015 UTC,thanks for responding.  Last time I tried this it didn't work.  Could you get more specific?  Do I set audio output in ableton to the ddj sx and it should just work?

If that doesn't work on PC you might well be stuck with having Ableton go to a separate interface and then mixing the audio externally, or routing one interface through another."

(I'm using one right now at a slow-ass karaoke/DJ night.)  The DDJ-SB, however, most definitely does the trick at a low price point.  But I do hate that the only output is RCA (those connections seem to wear out much more easily than XLR or 1/4).  Also, I'd note that the SB only comes with the Serato DJ Intro, which really sucks compared to Serato DJ proper."

Since you said you were having issues with the controller buttons not working yesterday and now today your having sound problems, I think its the cable, cause that was the same issue I was having.

While all of the functionality is available, accessing it is just flat out hard. And I'm sure it's not going to be any easier for Stems.  That being said, there are some tips I can give you for workflow. While the Maschine mikro doesn't have dedicated Group buttons, you can still use the Group button to switch remix deck pages. If you are planning on having a stem deck on top of a remix deck, that shouldn't be very hard. Just have the top row of pads change the page of the remix deck when you're holding the Group button down, or activate the Stem control when you press the second row.  We will need to see the workflow they recommend before we can give any details on Stems."

DJs,3d5v9w,farmerdaniel,3,Mon Jul 13 21:43:52 2015 UTC,"As soon as I posted that last comment I put in Imperial Dub Sessions and United Djs of America 9. They're not the same set, but I swear UDOA9 was a previous Farina set that was repackaged. I have all the 'big' ones on my phone, as well as the unreleased Mushroom Jazz sets I've compiled over the years. While you're changing your bag, can you grab my cane out of the bathroom? Haha."
DJs,3d6lg1,rmva,5,Mon Jul 13 22:44:32 2015 UTC,"The concepts for most scratches are the exact same as on turntables - it just takes lots of practice.  Personally, I'm not a fan of the sx platters for scratching, but if you have no frame of reference (didn't learn on turntables), it might not be so bad.  The best way to learn tho is to start on turntables."
DJs,3d6lg1,dj_soo,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:57:19 2015 UTC,"Definitely agree, not an expert by any means but I was able to execute scratches much easier on turntables.  Never gave much thought to honing that skill on controllers until I saw some DJs pull off some scratches flawlessly on a DDJ-SZ recently. Will keep at it!"
DJs,3d6lg1,dj_soo,1 point,Tue Jul 14 12:18:42 2015 UTC,The sz is much easier to scratch with due to the larger platters and the tension adjust.

DJs,3d6lg1,Methionine,2,Tue Jul 14 15:16:51 2015 UTC,"I've spent about an hour a day for the last month practicing scratching on an SX. I've learned that watching the needle marker on the platter is what matters most, but I can only get so far as the basic scratches down -- anything that is considered 'intermediate' is quite hard without the frame of reference of the turntable."
DJs,3d6lg1,dj_soo,1 point,Tue Jul 14 04:48:48 2015 UTC,"I'll definitely give that more focus, I guess time spent is key.  The biggest challenge has been in keeping persistent I guess when I'm not getting the results I'm looking for. The lack of tactile feedback of a moving platter just throws me off. Thanks for the advice!"

But also, if you don't want to use a mix, I've found that Spotify premium (easily worth the $10) works quite well for parties if you go into the settings and set the crossfade to 5 seconds or so. You just have to be a bit selective about the songs you pick since the crowd is gonna hear the whole track. In my experience it's about 70% as good as a real party DJ and probably better than a prerecorded we set because you can easily skip songs, add requested songs, etc."

DJs,3d325z,7Fifty,4,Mon Jul 13 16:14:00 2015 UTC,"Just reading some of the responses here, your question has already been answered.   You will not be able to buy good speakers for $200.

DJs,3d325z,butternips,1 point,Mon Jul 13 06:43:54 2015 UTC,Mid range speakers start at $700 apiece.  $250 a speaker is entry level and not great.  $400-$500 a speaker is getting to the top end of entry level.  You get at you pay for.
DJs,3d325z,the_bigwiggle,1 point,Mon Jul 13 06:48:26 2015 UTC,"Best you can do is behringer euro lives and mackie thumps and those usually start at $350 apiece.  They are by no means good, but they are pretty much the bottom end I'd recommend.  Better to just rent till you can afford something good.  The thing about cheap speakers is that they don't last long and you'll be needing to replace them within a year or two so you might as well put the money you would have spent on a cheap set of speakers towards a set of speakers that can last you 5-10 years."

I'm talking about the 400W versions that came out in 2010. The newer 1000W versions are $349 but they don't sound noticeably better. I used a pair of those for about 5 years before upgrading to EV-ZLX12Ps ($399/each). Everyone here is right though.. you just can't get anything decent for under $700/pair unless you go used.

DJs,3d325z,Dantejb,0,Mon Jul 13 03:50:16 2015 UTC,"baranger, kustom, peavy, and fender all make good budget shit. Nady makes the most budget shit and you get what you pay for with them, its super cheap and it gets the job done but it's no where near audiophile grade. I wouldn't buy nady for their mid / high speakers but their subs get the job done.   Honestly here's what you do if you need a budget PA if you don't find something on cragislist: Buy This: http://www.musiciansfriend.com/pro-audio/fender-passport-conference-portable-pa-system?pfm=sp  Then run that headphone out on that setup into a powered Subwoofer that ideally has a crossover built in, if not buy a crossover as well. If your on the go though get a powered sub and not a passive one so you don't have to lug an extra amp around.. cause that sucks.   Something like this sub should work: http://www.musiciansfriend.com/pro-audio/kustom-pa-pa112s-powered-sub  I mean a lot depends on what kind of room your playing, I personally run 250 watts to my mid / high speakers and 500 watts to my sub and i'm able to play a room for about 250-600 people. It doesn't sound the best, but i got what i paid for.   Another option is to build your own sub, find an amp that can do like standard speaker wire out then buy a car subwoofer box then buy some 12-18 inch subs off ebay (if more than 1 sub make them match) throw all that shit together and you have a ghetto live sub box.   By comparison the music venue i work at has 5900 watts going to 2 4 18"" sub racks. Then the rest of our speakers run about another 6kish watts. I'm not sure what kinda music your trying to play but my rule of thumb is always take what your mid / high speakers are and double their wattage for the subwoofer.   Also make sure you have speaker stands in your budget. It'll improve the sound drastically for a low price."
DJs,3d325z,Dantejb,1 point,Mon Jul 13 08:48:51 2015 UTC,"You can buy a used set of Yamaha Speakers.   They are workhorses from 10-15 years ago that will still sound really good and you can get a pair close to your budget.  The cabinets are carpeted and corners are protected; great for mobile DJ gigs.  You will need a power amplifier if you don't have one.  You can get a good power amp for $150.  Go for brands QSC and Crown, they are workhorses and in my experience very reliable.  Make the cables yourself or utilize Monoprice.  Good luck!"

It's that I do want to get started playing and my hope is that whatever speakers I do buy (If they're cheap) they'll last me the rest of the summer/fall and then around the holidays I can buy a new pair with some money I made and I'll hopefully have more money saved up by that. I just want to get started so I can get practicing in front of a crowd. I can do a lot of practicing at home but reading a crowd is something I can only practice live at a gig.
DJs,3d325z,ClownTaint,1 point,Mon Jul 13 04:57:57 2015 UTC,"Then you will be able to read the crowd's disappointment when you accidentally blow one at a gig and they're wondering where the sound went. For real, if you can't afford something that is relatively good quality, just rent speakers out for the gigs. It'll be like $25-$50 per gig depending on what you need."

Basically, they have a water gun and the doctor will shoot warm water into your ear at a regulated pressure. This loosens the wax and it all comes out into a dish you're holding under your ear. Super easy, but if the wax is stubborn and dry the syringing might not work. You can throw some wax softening oil in to your ears before you visit the doctor to ensure a good cleaning.   NEVER FUCKING STICK Q-TIPS IN YOUR EARS. All you're doing is pushing the wax further into your ear at the risk of damaging your ear permanently.  Also, forget those fucking ear wax candles. They don't do shit man. I've tried multiple brands and different techniques. Don't buy those lies."

I had been to the doctors about it and had been told it was just and ear wax blockup. I actually caused it initially with q-tips when I was cleaning.   I used some hydrogen peroxide based ear wax softener from a chemist and planned to get it cleaned in the same way Slynk mentioned. One day it just cleared itself while I was sitting listening to music. It was the coolest sensation I think I've ever experienced after months and months of no hearing in my right ear. I couldn't stop stroking my shirt because it sounded so cool!  fuck q tips
DJs,3d0e9s,giallo_nero,1 point,Mon Jul 13 11:44:51 2015 UTC,"Definitely a wax buildup then. You just pushed the wax deeper and completely blocked the ear canal. It cant be cleaned from outside or with fluids. The doctor will suck it from your ear with a ""mini vacuum"" thingy. Its simple, fast, and painless."
DJs,3d0e9s,Aerryq,1 point,Mon Jul 13 06:17:47 2015 UTC,Some years ago maybe 7-8 years ago [I dont remember the correct years] i had a surgery in my throat and also after the surgery was completed i had some infection in my ear and my ears were blocked by water and they did put some pipes for the water to dry and infection to go. They removed one pipe 4 years ago i think and other pipe in my right ear is still there maybe that's troubling it?

DJs,3d0e9s,Vekked,2,Sun Jul 12 16:06:22 2015 UTC,Sounds like an infection or a wax build-up. I wouldn't worry too much unless the doctor says otherwise.  Some people are more prone to this than others. It happens to me every few months.
DJs,3d0e9s,ixforres,-1,Sun Jul 12 15:13:59 2015 UTC,"When you visit your doctor, /u/CRYTEK_T-REX and if it turns out to be wax build up, ask him if he can suggest any safe way to clean it out at home.

DJs,3d0e9s,ixforres,2,Mon Jul 13 10:03:31 2015 UTC,"Happened to me once, in my case it was fluid build up from a cold that drained into my ear blocking it. It's a good idea to get it checked out tho in case it's an infection which could cause permanent damage."
DJs,3d0e9s,houseaddict,2,Sun Jul 12 22:06:33 2015 UTC,"If you're cleaning your ears withal a qtip or cotton bud, stop. Your ears do not need cleaning. If you need to clean your ears just pour a small quantity of olive oil in and wait 5 mins, this helps soften the wax. It's easy to damage your ear and hearing permanently and severely by ""cleaning"" with a cotton bud.  In any case you clearly need to see a doctor and probably get referred to an audiologist for a hearing test and a thorough ear exam. Look after your ears. Partial loss and tinnitus is a horrible thing, full loss in one ear is utterly horrifying. Don't let it happen to you, visit your audiologist and wear earplugs when around loud speakers!"
DJs,3d0e9s,turbotrixie1,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:16:15 2015 UTC,I already did clean with ear buds and made it more worse and right now i also got my left ear getting blocked. I can only hear 50% on my left ear and 0% on my right ear.  What is tinnitus?
DJs,3d0e9s,houseaddict,1 point,Mon Jul 13 07:25:19 2015 UTC,"Tinnitus is hearing a continuous, unending ringing noise at a certain frequency or range of frequencies. It's a hugely debilitating condition in its most severe forms, and hugely annoying in its most minor forms.  Just for the love of all that is holy STOP USING COTTON BUDS. Never put anything in your ear smaller than your elbow. The ear is incredibly sensitive, especially to blunt trauma (like sticking a cotton bud through your eardrum).  If you've not seen a doctor now, you should. Losing your hearing completely in one ear is grounds for making an emergency appointment with your local doctor and being seen same day; I'd go to an emergency department if you've not been seen yet. If you've damaged your eardrum there may be nothing that can be done except to wait and hope. If you've just got wax buildup they can clean it correctly using irrigation."
DJs,3d0e9s,averynicehat,1 point,Mon Jul 13 11:47:37 2015 UTC,"Tinnitus   Is it possible for that to come and go? I had it for years but I haven't noticed it for a while until yesterday. I could hear a high pitched tone in my right ear for about 30 seconds.. then it went away.   I could be wrong but I think it went away after I got my ears syringed in thailand, I went diving and a couple of hours later I went deaf. Basically deposits of wax in my ears had been pushed in by the water pressure.  I don't go clubbing so much now and I am careful with volume but I always thought tinnitus was permanent."
DJs,3d0e9s,Attendant,2,Tue Jul 14 10:58:06 2015 UTC,The damage is permanent but perception is affected by many things especially if it's minor. Your brain will learn to ignore minor tinnitus over a few years. I only get it in quiet spaces or when wearing earplugs in quiet areas and even then not much but mine is minor and it's been some years since the damage that caused it.

I'm too lazy to plug it in right now and test. It's sitting less than a foot away from me, so that's pretty damn lazy.  Check this out though, because even if it works, you still won't get what you want. The headphones only work when you're cueing a song. So to get sound out of your computer speakers, you'll have to hit the cue button for that track. This means you'll hear the same output in your headphones and your speakers.  You can still play around though while waiting for your adapter. Just skip the headphones for now and play both tracks at the same time through your computer speakers.

DJs,3cvsp1,salmonsole,3,Sat Jul 11 04:48:42 2015 UTC,"Never experienced this myself but here's what I can offer:  Check your mixers EQ settings, although I am sure you have already.   Unplug everything and start the process over again. Maybe try new wires  Try connecting something other than your mixers to the speakers (iPod, phone, etc). Preferably, something with a different input than the mixer   Worse comes to worse, go out and buy new speakers and then return them a week or so later."
DJs,3cvsp1,TheGreatGoldenBabyy,2,Sat Jul 11 05:41:55 2015 UTC,"Is it a 2 way speaker? As in does it have 2 different drivers? Sounds like you've blown your mid driver and all that's working is the HF. Does it have multiple inputs on the back labeled with different things? Does it have a little silver switch, or ""passive crossover"" written on it anywhere?  Edit: if you give me your system specs including the amp then I can probably work it out."
DJs,3cvsp1,poejaxton,1 point,Sat Jul 11 06:27:16 2015 UTC,"yes, it's a 2 way speaker. this is the exact model. on the back it has an input 1, input 2, 2 volume knobs for each input, a ground and a contour button. i don't see a little silver switch, doesn't seem to have ""passive crossover"" either.  EDIT: just gonna throw this out there, i used these not too long ago for a small party, there were no audio or clipping issues, used pretty lightly. they haven't had any issues since, in fact the one that's having a problem has been sitting in my room untouched. i can't find any similar problems online with this model of speaker, they seem to be pretty durable and reliable. i truly have no explanation or idea as to why this could have happened."
DJs,3cvsp1,poejaxton,1 point,Sat Jul 11 06:35:07 2015 UTC,"Huh weird. So this inputs can be used with either jack or XLR, have you tried using whichever one you don't normally use?"
DJs,3cvsp1,poejaxton,1 point,Sat Jul 11 07:03:49 2015 UTC,"The only inputs on the back of the speakers are XLR, the 1/4th inch jack connects to my console. I've tried both XLR inputs on the speakers, nothing..."
DJs,3cvsp1,poejaxton,2,Sat Jul 11 07:07:28 2015 UTC,"So, looking at the pic if the inputs that you provided, they have jack/XLR inputs, both in the same socket. The hole in the centre if your XLR socket is so you can use a jack in the same input.   If that doesn't work then it can only really be one if two things:  1) You've blown a driver  2) You've got a loose wire at the driver end on the larger driver.  Remember that the speaker itself doesn't have to be clipping, the DJ mixer clipping will still be sending clipped signal, which will be bad for the driver."
DJs,3cvsp1,dj_soo,1 point,Sat Jul 11 08:06:55 2015 UTC,"Wow, i wasn't aware that the XLR input also served as a jack input, i will try that. We've opened up the speaker on both the back end and the front, there seems to be no damage whatsoever to the bottom driver. There didn't appear to be any loose wires on that end although I suppose we should check again.  Could the issue possibly be a blown fuse somewhere in the power unit? We're currently looking through the backside of the speaker, looking for any lose wires/signs of damage, although nothing has seemed to turn up.  Thanks a lot for your help so far, really hoping to get this fixed."
DJs,3cvsp1,thirteenthirty7,1 point,Sat Jul 11 08:14:55 2015 UTC,"Well I mean it could be but I don't really see how that would affect only one driver unless t had some pretty funky wiring. Have you tried using more than one input into the speaker, I.e. Not your mixer?   Something you won't be able to see that could have occurred is that you may have fried your voicecoil. That's the large heavy bit at the back. Basically a speaker has two ways it can break, the cone can rip ( obvious to see) which is the result of one sharp shock, or the voicecoil can melt which is the result of it being pushed too hard over a period of time. It's possible that this has happened although if you take care of not clipping the fuck out of it, it's unlikely.   I'm afraid that without being there with you there isn't really much else I can offer you man."
DJs,3cvsp1,boomboommusica,1 point,Sat Jul 11 08:51:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah I don't think clipping was the problem, the last event I did I was wary of my levels an kept everything nice and smooth. There didn't seem to be any damage to the voice cool although I'm not sure if that type of damage would be visible. I haven't tried plugging anything else into the inputs besides a couple mics a while ago, I don't have anything else to test out. That, along with testing out a jack in the input, are the only two things I have not tried. I'll let you know how everything goes."

In Logic I use the stock Multipressor with a genre specific preset, then I pop the stock Adaptive Limiter on it with 3-6 db gain depending on what doesn't completely distort the track or crush the drums.  Generally speaking that will get your volume up higher but every track is different so you should really be shaping things appropriately to the context of the music. There's no magic bullet.  The BBE Maximizer is great but it's not a catch all either. It works great on certain tracks in certain situations but you shouldn't be slapping it on top of the Master on a mix. It's just a tool like every other plugin."

If only channels 1-2 appear as options, you probably got the wrong device. Depending on the software you're using, you might be able to output to your speakers on the external sound card and output to your headphones on your computer's onboard sound card, but this is not ideal because every sound card has its own clock that is never exactly in time with any other sound card.  I'm skeptical of the quality of a $23 sound card anyway. Here is a list of sound cards that could be good for you."
DJs,3curhz,_Be_,1 point,Sat Jul 11 00:36:57 2015 UTC,"I don't know much about Windows, ASIO, or surround sound cards, but my guess is that ASIO sees separate channels but the hardware is only actually wired for 2 channels and processes them for output to separate speakers for surround sound. My suggestion is to use your onboard sound card and this thing together for now and get a good 4 output sound card when you can afford it."

DJs,3cu8w6,thedjally,1 point,Sat Jul 11 02:07:29 2015 UTC,"I've got an DDJ-SR and I honestly like it. The big difference to me has to do with gigging. If it's a house party, restaurant gig, or something else where you're providing the setup and are likely the only DJ playing, it's great. However I also have an SL4 that I'll bring to when I'm playing a club or a rave or something with multiple DJs. From a stage manager perspective, there's nothing more annoying than a DJ who shows up with a big-ass controller there's no room for when everybody else is playing off CDJs or even records. Unless you're big enough to be able to demand performance riders, don't be that guy who makes all the other DJs suffer just because you can't be arsed to learn on a standard setup.  I do really love the controller. I almost feel like I'm cheating with it because it makes the whole DJ process so goddamn easy - I'm not even using sync and beat matching has become trivial. But that's just pushing me to find new ways to innovate in my set.  If you're already familiar with CDJs to the point that you can interchange into them with ease, I'd say go with the controller. But if you're still learning for the love of God learn how to use what venues typically have."

Your life will be much simpler. That and it has a built in stand alone mixer. So if you wanted to grab CDJ's or turntables down the line you can. I have one and I love it.

Seems like if you keep the channels out of the red then you'll be fine for clipping, pretty sure a club mixing desk will be able to deal with a hot input signal like club mixers give out (that or they'll use the master ATT switch on the back/in the ctrl panel)"
DJs,3cpqq9,ebbsc,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:49:56 2015 UTC,"Think of the signal flow though.  If your output is too hot coming out of the mixer, it's already clipping. The engineer at the mixing desk can't really do much about it at that point."
DJs,3cpqq9,Operader,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:59:28 2015 UTC,"Not necessarily, if the mixing desk was capable of handling a higher dBV, then it wouldn't be clipping at these levels. The mixer itself is capable of sending out a hot signal without clipping. Obviously it's bad practice though, as you have limited headroom, and you're working on the assumption that anything downstream can handle a hot signal.  My point is just that with (in this case) Pioneer equipment, in the clubs I've played in you could send a ""redlined"" signal off the master and still not be clipping."

Besides, higher bit depths actually DO allow digital signals to exceed 0dB (see any DAWs inter-channel routing, where you can go up to +64dB - or somewhere in that range, I don't know the exact number - without causing clipping, so long as your output to analog equipment is below 0db).  Want to see for yourself?   Open Ableton Put operator on Channel set to sine wave Put Utility on Master set to max gain reduction possible Put Utility on mixer channel set to max gain amplification possible.

In an ideal world, the output of the mixer should be 0dB, for good gain structure. With pioneer mixers there is enough headroom on the internal channels and the master channel, that you could be running the across the board and also on the master, but with the attenuator switch set to -9 (or whatever the lowest is) the master out with be 0dB before it heads into the club system..."

DJs,3cpqq9,inkosana,3,Fri Jul 10 09:18:46 2015 UTC,"Well, first off, every mixer is a little bit different in how it reacts to high levels of gain. Some analog mixers sound better when you play into the yellow and only occasionally hit the red, so that's actually arguably good practice, provided you're not constantly flashing red.  Additionally, I've heard Pioneer realized how often DJ's were redlining mixers, and their solution to the problem was to sort of shift the meter down so that the red lights would come on well before the mixer actually clips hard, so that you can safely run two lights into the red. IMO, that's kind of a dumb ""feature"" and it reinforces terrible habits, but oh well. Just keep in mind that on newer Pio mixers, the DJ can be keeping a red light lit constantly with no ill effect.  Also, if the mains are way too quiet, sometimes the only way to get more loudness out of it is to run the DJ mixer hot. Often times, DJ's will want to louder than everyone else and run into the red when the mains are already plenty loud.  I've also heard DJ's claim it sounds better when they're playing tracks deeeeeep into the red and distorting them badly.  Other DJ's might not know any better, and/or care. You don't need to be a tech nerd to be a DJ.  Probably the most compelling reason I can think of is that if you don't have control over the mains level, it's reaaallly hard to bring down the levels after another DJ has been hammering the red. Maybe the sound guy has already gotten pissed off and turned the mains down, and now you have to either play 6dB softer than the guy that lead you and ruin the energy but have clear sound, or keep the levels up."

DJs,3cpqq9,GDIBass,3,Thu Jul 9 22:08:49 2015 UTC,"Is it that much of a big deal?   No, not really, assuming you're just in the first red.  Redlining on a pioneer mixer does not mean clipping.  The newer ones have a default of 19db of headroom.  If you take a look at a mixer you see that even the first red marker means you're at +10dB, so still 9dB under clipping levels.    You should still try to keep it out of the red, just because you don't have any visual cues to tell you if you're nearing clipping past the 2nd red, but ""kissing"" it won't cause distortion.

DJs,3cpqq9,archpope,2,Thu Jul 9 22:55:48 2015 UTC,"Redlining is not at all unavoidable. The important thing to remember is that the earlier it is in the signal chain, the more important it is that it not redline. Any distortion introduced at any stage is carried to the next stage. So, if you're redlining on your controller, there is nothing that can be done downstream that will remove that distortion. If other components are also redlining, that distortion will be additive."

The only ""point"" in redlining is when you use analog gear, that creates saturation which can create interesting tones and colours, but never, never apply saturation to a full mix at once, only on isolated instruments!  They just do that because they think that by redlining the crown will perceive greater loudness, but when you don't have a good understanding of what's happening, obviously you do mistakes ...  Basically they try to go past the Sound Engineer and level up the master volume, but then the sound guy will turn down the master progressively when he hears that this is getting too loud (Looking at you, Hardwell, Martin Garrix, and especially DV&LM)"
DJs,3cpqq9,_Be_,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:46:54 2015 UTC,"People usually want it louder, so they crank the initial gain knobs, I see so many people with the initial gains turned up to redline and the master gain is down at -16db... Its just a matter of turning it up in the right point of the signal chain. if you run relatively low channels (hitting -10 or so at each channel) then you can turn it way up on the master/in your monitors, and then if it still needs to be louder turn up your amp/powered speakers. If you are at a club get the sound guy to turn the system up.  Its super easy to not redline stuff, most DJ's just don't have an audio background/dont care if their music is clipping as long as they make it louder.

If you run it into red, eventually it will meltdown electrically and cease to work. So in order to protect expensive soundsystems, pretty much every club in the world places limiters on their soundsystems. So while the DJ thinks, “Let’s turn it up by pushing it into red,” in reality it won’t be any louder on the dance floor because the limiters will prevent that from happening.

Your sub bass will begin to distort which is not good. Sub bass should remain a sine so it has rumble and kicks should have punch and snares should snap. This is what your losing.  This is just a case of shitty djing because they think any one can do it and people don't know what real quality is.

I've never (ok once at a festival when Duck Sauce came on) been at a club or playing a party where the music doesn't gradually get louder as the night progresses. And while you may have well mastered tracks, and try to cue the right levels before transitions, you don't want your drop to be quiet and you're gonna turn it up from time to time. When you're redlining, all that compression from the mixer and house system is starting to kick in, evening out the levels from track to track. It may not be good for the sound, but it works to keep the dancefloor energy up.  This is my hypothesis anyway..."

For most private boat rentals, you're looking at the cost of the boat, staff, security, sound, and Djs - so not that different from most parties other than the cost of the venue is going to be a lot higher than most generally.  Other things to consider - if it's a boat party in a body of water close to a city, noise may be a concern - at least while you're leaving dock til you get out further into the water so make sure to ask the crew the details and plan your set times accordingly.  With that amount of people, I'm assuming you'll want a couple rooms of Djs. Keep in mind that depending on weather, any indoor rooms tend to get screwed in terms of people while if it rains, the opposite happens.  Never a bad idea to look into headliners to book as a draw...  Due to movement, CDJs/controllers are probably a better option than turntables and vinyl.

It's not so much as a fuck you as it is a business decision.     Online music stores typically offer downloads in FLAC nowadays.   they do?  Cause beatport sure as hell doesn't, neither does itunes or google play nor popular sites like Junodownload."

DJs,3ckzce,thrillzone,4,Wed Jul 8 19:09:39 2015 UTC,"Here's a pretty neat trick. Though I don't claim to know everything about how Soundcloud crawls and analyzes the mixes, they definitely take a look at the first song in the mix and try to match it with something from their known list of copyrighted songs. Something as little as 15 seconds of dead air before mixing or having a non-copyrighted song at the beginning can be enough to get things to ""pass""  I've definitely noticed that a lot of the big players have those little intro bits at the beginning. Probably serves couple purposes for them: introducing their show, building a brand, tricking soundcloud , etc."

DJs,3clhj2,_Be_,3,Wed Jul 8 21:39:59 2015 UTC,I have the A&H Xone XD2-53s and they're great. The metal headband makes them more durable than most headphones. AFAIK most headphones with plastic headbands tend to break after 2-3 years. The Xone XD2-53 cups also fold down flat for easy storage. I transport mine in a $2.50 hard plastic container from a dollar store. They have a detachable cord too.
DJs,3clhj2,MSD_,2,Wed Jul 8 22:55:05 2015 UTC,Could personally recommend shure srh440s. Though I never took too much of a look at the competing options
DJs,3clhj2,seltzzer,2,Wed Jul 8 21:24:34 2015 UTC,I've tried the HD-25s for a few months and they are overrated IMO. Their sound signature gives me VERY little confidence on mixing accurately.  I prefer the V-Moda M-100s or the Senns HD8s BY FAR. I prefer the bassier sounds for beat matching.
DJs,3clhj2,Djrussell,2,Thu Jul 9 08:33:46 2015 UTC,"A couple of years ago when I started a 3 night a week residency I picked up some in ear monitors from westone for $275.  I'm still using the original cord and original batch of foam ear inserts.  I am a radio guy and have gone through a lot of headphones over the years.     I figured if I bought bulky plastic phones I would of worn them out by now, so paying $275 once was better than paying for 3 different bulky headsets...  Plus you can run in ear monitors at a lower volume than over the ear headphones, saving ear fatigue."
DJs,3clhj2,ebbomega,2,Thu Jul 9 18:12:07 2015 UTC,"Can I just use this opportunity to bitch about the Senn HD25s? I hate hate hate them and it bothers me that they're always the first and most common thing to come up in these conversations. They don't fit well on my ears, I find them a tad annoying to slip on/off my ears for when wanting to split my ears between cue and monitor, and they slip off my head when I do that.  I get the reasons that everybody loves them so much - high quality sound, modular - and I can't argue with those points, because those are great features. But as far as sound quality goes I'm not looking for perfect sound when I'm DJing, I just need good balance and volume if my monitors are thumpingly loud. And for modular, 99% of the time if something is going to fail beyond faulty hardware it's going to be the cable.  For these reasons my preferred headphones are the Technics DH1250. Detachable cord, fits nicely over the ear, does a good job with both volume and cutting out bleed (not noise cancelling but is adequate), solid sound quality, durable hardware, fits nicely in one-ear configurations and slips on/off single ear easily."

I hope they measure up! It looks like the prices will be $200/300/400 respectively according to this article (http://www.musicradar.com/news/tech/summer-namm-2015-akai-announces-ultra-sensitive-new-mpd-pad-controllers-624558/2)  Anyone found info on the release date yet though?

DJs,3ckcr8,oatmealfoot,2,Wed Jul 8 18:00:40 2015 UTC,"I would say that the benchmark is the original MPC pads.  While Akai does also make the MPD and MPK stuff, I did find their last run of pads weren't quite as sensitive as the older MPC stuff.  Hoping they improved with this new iteration."
DJs,3ckcr8,dj_soo,2,Wed Jul 8 21:35:15 2015 UTC,"I could understand that for sure. I have used their newer pads on a number of different devices, and they just required way too much force (at least pre-modification) for it to feel like a true instrument.  How do the old MPC's compare to the feel and playability of the Maschine line?  I've only ever gotten to try Maschine through friends or when I was hanging out in Guitar Centers, but as a life-long finger drummer I always really enjoyed the way that they feel"
DJs,3clo8q,erratic_calm,3,Wed Jul 8 21:44:37 2015 UTC,"If you don't plan on playing out in clubs much, the amx might be right up your alley.  Compact, sdj compatible, innofader included for only $350 ($250 + $99 for DVS upgrade).  If you do plan on playing out in spots with their own gear, the box might be more practical.  If the ds1 is $399, I'd just try to find a used sl2.  Those boxes are near indestructible - just look how long your sl1 lasted..."
DJs,3clo8q,dj_soo,1 point,Thu Jul 9 03:06:02 2015 UTC,All good points. Thank you. Have you messed around with the AMX at all?
DJs,3clo8q,dj_soo,2,Thu Jul 9 03:56:24 2015 UTC,"Only in the store d it wasn't plugged in - just played with the faders and knobs.  It feel alright for a $250 controller/mixer combo.  You'll want something to prop it up on to raise it to the level of your turntables.  Faders and knobs feel nice but the unit is plastic and not exactly built like a tank, but that's to be expected for the price point.  It's the cheapest serato enabled mixer on the market tho.  It's lacking in any additional controls, but your mpd will work fine with it although you won't get all the features like you would a licensed add on controller like an afx or sp1.  You can also map internal mode to your mpd and basically run it as a controller without turntables for those tiny gigs.  I've also been told the output is a little on the low side since its usb powered only."
DJs,3clo8q,dj_soo,1 point,Thu Jul 9 04:03:24 2015 UTC,"Cool. I think I'm gonna go DS1 or SL2. It seems like the DS1 is gonna be released end of the month and that it's still $299 so fingers crossed. I guess I just have to be patient at this point. The AMX is tempting but it also might be limiting if I end up hating it as a mixer. I have a Z1, Traktor DJ and an iPad for when I'm feeling sync'y."
DJs,3clo8q,dj_soo,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:05:31 2015 UTC,"The most attractive thing about the amx to me is the price point and portability.  Otherwise it's a basic, tiny 2 channel mixer that requires a laptop to use.  At least it has filters..."

DJs,3clo8q,_Be_,2,Sat Jul 11 05:22:14 2015 UTC,it's nice for smooth blends.  I like to use it in conjunction with an echo or delay and maybe a loop roll to get a swishy transition.
DJs,3clo8q,thedjally,1 point,Sat Jul 11 10:24:24 2015 UTC,"Ended up grabbing the AMX and DVS. It's pretty impressive for a $250/$350 controller. I saw the DJ City/Mojaxxx review where he was talking about lack of volume but for me it's actually loud as shit. I have to keep the master at half in SDJ when going into powered speakers and the master on the controller is barely turned up.  Only limit of the mixer imo is the upfaders. They're just fine for fading tracks in and out but there's a bit of resistance so they're not really for scratching.  If I'm feeling lazy it's so nice to be able to scratch in a track and pop the sync button so the track slides right into the grid. Best of both worlds. It's really a nice controller. It came with a bonus $29 FX pack too so that was a nice surprise.  I built a stand for it out of wood 5.5"" w x 10"" l x 2.5"" h and put rubber feet so its non-slip. Going to paint it enamel black."
DJs,3clo8q,thedjally,2,Thu Jul 16 18:07:22 2015 UTC,"You should generally keep your software master at 12:00 to prevent internal clipping.  I kind of want one just for smaller gigs where I don't want to lug out my 62, but still have turntables.  Would be nice to just have it to work on mixes and practice on say a plane ride when I'm going on the road.  Totally unnecessary purchase for me tho so it's way down on my priority list."

If you're looking to host professionally it's a good idea to avoid using torrented files since all it takes is a legit host who wants to take your gig or a rep from sound choice figuring out that you're using pirated tracks and reporting you to sound choice. I've seen venues and karaoke hosts get sued over it."

I said this when they first launched and it's still true - I can't believe someone OK'd this as production-ready.  It's barely beta-ready."

DJs,3ch8s9,thedinnerdate,2,Tue Jul 7 22:56:08 2015 UTC,I just checked out your profile and noticed you have images behind you tracks as well. I find it interesting you were approached for this considering you have such a low number of followers compared to a lot of other artists that don't have the premier benefits. Can you give any insight as to why you think you were chosen?
DJs,3ch8s9,davidkop,1 point,Wed Jul 8 02:57:50 2015 UTC,"Thanks for boosting my self esteem! :D Lol, no but seriously, I wasn’t chosen. My distribution service offered to me because they partnered with SoundCloud, so they could include a few artist that release under them.  I’ll be honest though. I have to admit if you listen to my music you’ll probably be surprised why all of it is on iTunes, all stores and I have a SoundCloud partnership but it’s really more about luck and being at the right place in the right time."

A huge EDM DJ's set has much more in common with a Vegas strip magic show than it does with the roots of club DJing. Which is fine, kids want to rave to huge lights and massive drops.   It's dumb to hold those dudes to the same standards as underground DJs because it's explicitly not the same thing. It's a massive colorful spectacle, not someone picking records for you at a party."

For one in excellent conditionally functionally, but with signs of wear - $500 - $650 without cartridge.  Look at eBay sold listings (not what people are asking as a buy-it-now) as a guide.  Real bargains can be had from Japanese sellers (even factoring in postage), but you just need to factor in two 240v to 100v step-down transformers (about $50 - $60 each)."

Earlier this year I picked up a pair of mint condition 1200MK5s.   Technics have a different feel to them and are rock solid performers. I'd go with Technics above everything else, followed by the LP-1240s and LP-120s.  Prices are going up, but personally I would shell out big money to get a pair of mint condition Technics.

DJs,3celji,Dubliminal,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:16:36 2015 UTC,"I've discussed the concept of this with tons of my local DJ friends and it seems to be a mixed bag. At face value it seems like a great concept for the DJ who is now pocketing extra cash for playing a song, and the patron now gets to hear his or her favorite track.  The main reaction that I get from other DJs is that they don't like the concept of an application like this. They don't like that you remove the ""human"" factor in this and instead remotely push requests to him. On top of this they also worry that they'd just become an overglorified jukebox. I've been bouncing modifications to this idea for a long time but I haven't come up with a solution that caters to both the DJs need and the customers need at the same time.  That being said, in places where requests are taken more seriously, as /u/_weed had mentioned, it would work."
DJs,3celji,Methionine,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:58:20 2015 UTC,"I think it has a market. I personally don't have any animosity towards requests as a club dj as long as people are nice about it..and if a tip is involved that goes a long way. It's also nice to be able to read the requests and have a list of them handy instead of trying to remember things that drunk people shout at me over my booth monitors.   One thing to consider if it gets funded - some sort of ""availiability"" api that will automatically tell a user if the song is in the DJ's library. This would only work with wi-fi enabled clubs but it's something to consider."

I believe that playing at events/festivals/etc like that gives you way more fun than playing at a club or private party.  I don't know about other countries, but here in Denmark, if you play at a club or private party, then you'll have 2-3 people next to the booth wanting to hear exactly what they like, because ""you're not playing anything that people can dance to"", even though you have lots of people on the dancefloor. If you didn't play top20 all night, people would just disappear from the dancefloor immediately.  That shit drove me down and actually made me stop playing as a normal DJ here :/   But regarding preparing. I usually do two ways.   Pre-calculated playlist (for single 1-1.5 hour performance) Multiple playlists (warm-up, crowdpleasers, slows, go nuts, shut-downs, etc)   often I also end up using a specific bpm (+- 4% or so)"

If I'm not feeling it, how are the crowd going to?!  At this one, I was told to go from ~80 BPM to 110, slowly, but still keeping it relaxed. One of the last songs I played was Halley Road by Asura, which has this really ecstatic build up - it could probably never work in a club setting but outside here it was perfect, mixed with some drum machine craziness of an Aphex Twin track :)  I see how making lists based on the 'mood' of the track makes sense. Two songs with a similar BPM and key doesn't necessarily work together, especially if the energy in them are totally different. anyway."

DJs,3c7d88,rabidbasher,4,Sun Jul 5 18:43:44 2015 UTC,More like mid/late 00s.  Cdjs were around but not as ubiquitous until the late 00s and serato basically killed vinyl for all but the most ardent fanatics.
DJs,3c7d88,dj_soo,0,Sun Jul 5 19:40:23 2015 UTC,I'm in general agreement. I know a lot of people switched around 2004-2005 to CDJ (some even earlier) but vinyl really fell out of vogue (for all but the fanatics/purists) a couple years later.

DJs,3c7d88,rabidbasher,-11,Sun Jul 5 23:31:36 2015 UTC,"As a dj, I still use vinyl. I still go to record stores and record shop. Two turntables, a mixer. Not some fucking laptop using button pushing bullshit.. djing was an art, and still can be, but it's becoming over saturated with everyone using a sync button and cues.. no one listens to a beat, and beat matches. It's unfortunate and sad."
DJs,3c7d88,igetbitches469,5,Sun Jul 5 22:10:04 2015 UTC,"There's nothing wrong with still using vinyl, and I wasn't trying to imply that. Really, though, listening to your beat and beatmatching should be just as much of a part of mixing on a controller as it is a CDJ or turntables. Cues and sync buttons be damned, they aren't perfect, and will never get you synced in perfect phase.  DJing still can be an art, even with a controller. Just because something adds functionality doesn't make it any less valid as a performance. It would be like saying a digital artist is less valid because they aren't painting in oil."
DJs,3c7d88,rabidbasher,0,Sun Jul 5 23:01:29 2015 UTC,"I would agree with you in the respect of the art... however my main issue is when ""djs"" rely on cue and sync buttons. Otherwise yea cdjs are the new age turntables, more convenient, and easier to transport."
DJs,3c7d88,Sam_T,1 point,Mon Jul 6 00:56:52 2015 UTC,"Not to mention FAR easier to find media for.  I can't name a single record store within 100 miles of me that sells EDM. LOL.  Regarding the cue and sync buttons... Cue is a matter of convenience. I only really use cue markers just to mark my first downbeat personally. Others use them to skip back and forth in songs (not really my style) or chop up vocals, which can be cool. Sync button is only a 'rough' sync in my experience. It always takes a few bars of fine tuning to get it to sound right.  All that aside, it frees up the hands and mind to do more creative things in your mix as well, when you aren't dicking with a pitch fader or dragging constantly just to get your sync perfect.  I'd say both are equally valid with a bit of value-added for the digital media just because the automation takes some but not all of the 'busywork' out of mixing."

Honestly, getting it now would be fine, and that setup should future proof you pretty well for whatever pioneer rolls out next. I was able to save ~$800-1000 by buying used from craigslist and eBay, and knowing how to use CDJs is definitely worth the investment. Also, CDJs and Pioneer mixers always hold their value for a few years, so you should be able to get your money back (or close to it) if/when you decide to upgrade.  Also, everyone I've talked to says to go with the DJM 900 over the DJM 2000. The 2000s are supposedly pretty clunky, and the 900 is the standard anyway.  I hope this helped!

DJs,3c4ft5,_Be_,0,Sat Jul 4 18:03:36 2015 UTC,"Are you a developer, or somehow involved with the development team?  Im own a Native Instruments S4 and a S4MK2, and I'm interested in software alternatives, since Traktor isn't stable for a final, commercial product.  I never tried Mixxx. Does it have a ""Learn"" feature so I can start the mapping easily? Does it work with the same protocols NI uses, or does it need to be in MIDI mode?"
DJs,3c4ft5,kirlefteris,2,Sun Jul 5 01:39:55 2015 UTC,"It has a learning wizard that allows you to individually map each control, either from scratch or from an existing map. Afaik it needs to be MIDI though yes"
DJs,3c4ft5,JoshG273,2,Sun Jul 5 01:56:04 2015 UTC,"I am not a Mixxx developer but I've been contributing bug reports/feature requests; rewriting, organizing, and updating the wiki; helping users on the forum; making a mapping for my Electrix Tweaker; and fixing small bugs that don't require knowing C++ (the programming language that Mixxx is written in). I also made Crossfade GNU/Linux, a GNU/Linux distribution for booting from USB drives and DJing with Mixxx.  Mixxx does have a MIDI Learn Wizard but it is only for MIDI. Native Instruments' controllers do not use MIDI. From the page: ""Native Instruments' newer DJ controllers [including the S4 Mk2] are USB HID class compliant devices. The Windows and Mac OS X drivers can translate the HID signals to MIDI, but this is not available on GNU/Linux. So, if you make a mapping for these controllers, please make an HID mapping so it is compatible with every OS that Mixxx runs on.  Native Instruments' older DJ controllers [including the S4 Mk1] use a proprietary protocol called NHL that Mixxx does not support. The Windows and Mac OS X drivers can switch these controllers to a MIDI mode by pressing certain buttons (see the Native Instruments website for the button combination for each controller), which could be mapped to Mixxx. Unfortunately, because this is done by the driver and not the controller firmware, these controllers cannot be used as MIDI controllers on GNU/Linux. However, the snd-usb-caiaq driver in Linux supports the audio interfaces in at least some of these devices. It also registers the signals from some of the controllers as generic Linux input events. To get these devices to work with Mixxx on GNU/Linux, either the driver would need to be modified to translate these signals to HID or MIDI, Mixxx would need to be able to read Linux input events, or a program would need to translate the Linux input events to HID or MIDI.""  Someone did start a mapping using MIDI for the S4 (presumably the Mk1 judging from the date of the post). I have no idea about the quality of that mapping. Using the MIDI mode of the Windows or OS X driver and Mixxx's MIDI Learn Wizard would be the easiest way to map it, but it wouldn't work for every OS that Mixxx runs on. I have also read that the MIDI signals sent by the Windows and OS X drivers are not as high resolution so the jog wheels don't work as well as they do with the default Traktor mapping.  Unfortunately, no one has yet written good documentation for how to make an HID mapping and it requires writing JavaScript. I don't know much about HID but it seems to be more complicated than MIDI. HID support was added in the latest stable version, 1.11. A handful of HID devices have been mapped (see the original link) that you could use as examples. If you decide to go this route, you could ask for help on the mailing list. Reading through common-hid-packet-parser.js would probably be a good idea.  I actually did try to write a Python program to translate the Linux input events to MIDI for an old Native Instruments Kore controller that I got in a moving-away sale for $15. It was an interesting and kinda fun experience, but I gave up for a few reasons. I couldn't figure out any way to calculate an absolute position from the Kore's encoders and the encoders send small signals when adjacent knobs are touched, so I couldn't effectively turn two adjacent encoders (which kinda defeats the point of having a controller). The Kore has a pretty nice 4 output audio interface with balanced 1/4"" TRS outputs though so I use it as my sound card."

DJs,3bzozy,archpope,1 point,Sat Jul 4 06:51:43 2015 UTC,"what are you talking about?  Smart playlists don't pick any music for you.  They are a way of organizing tracks easily via your own criteria without the need to manually drag and drop shit.  You still have to know your tracks and know what works, you just don't have to go through your tracks and move them into the disco folder.  You tag them with ""disco"" and they automatically get put in a smart playlist that looks for the word ""disco"" in the genre field."

DJs,3bzozy,dj_soo,0,Sat Jul 4 18:47:33 2015 UTC,"Clunky   How?   completely outdated   That's 100% factually untrue, as all of your files are stored in file folders. Don't say stupid stuff that is straight up false.  Your digital music files are just that, digital files, which need a location on the device they are stored on.  Do you just throw all of your music into one single folder?  Also, file folders is just for having it structured and organized on the storage device.  Browsing for tracks while DJing will obviously be done within Traktor."
DJs,3bzozy,dsprox,2,Sat Jul 4 19:12:43 2015 UTC,"the file/folder/desktop paradigm was conceived before storage was as large as it is now.  If you only have a few hundred files fine - if yours start numbering into the thousands and more, a searchable database system with metadata makes more sense.  It's all the same at the end of the day - you need a place to access your data quickly and efficiently and ""physical"" files and folders (I say this to represent the desktop files and folders) simply aren't that efficient when it comes to managing huge numbers of files.  There's simply no point painstakingly copying and moving your files around various folders and sub folders when it can be done via a more feature-rich database manager that simultaneously allows you to organize and edit your files.  Yes, all my 25,000+ music files are thrown into a single folder - or at least I let itunes organize it in it's way - I don't really care, I rarely if ever actually go into the folder.  There's simply no point when a media manager like iTunes or media monkey or whatever you use will allow you to browse, edit, search, sort, and organize the files within the program.    You have a master list and can then place tracks into playlists, search, batch-tag, and create auto-populating lists for yourself without wasting the time dragging and dropping files into separate folders.  A lot of people like to organize by genre.  When you deal with ""physical"" folders and files, what do you do with the tunes that can be considered multiple genres?  Say you have a house track with a reggae vocal and trappy breakdown.  Does that track go in your house folder?  Your reggae folder?  Your Trap folder?  Do you copy it twice so it goes in all three?  With a media manager and playlists, I simply put it in my house, reggae, and trap lists and I don't need multiple copies of the same file.  Better still, i tag house/reggae/trap in the genre field and it automatically gets sent to their respective smart playlists.  These programs allow you access to the ""physical"" files for copying and moving to other devices so I never have to open a single folder to access my stuff.  I have a very extensive system of tagging and smart playlists that allows me to access the music I need to access when I want making it very easy to freestyle and go through genres easily without having to open a single folder and move a single file."

Like, your library in Traktor?   simply aren't that efficient when it comes to managing huge numbers of files   I think it's far easier to be able to pull files from specific folders rather than just one huge folder.  I'd rather all my Techno tracks be in their folder, that way when I go to search for a track title that I have multiple tracks of in different genres, I don't have to further browse through multiple results of tracks in different genres.  If I know I'm looking for the dubstep version of ""Raw Power"" it will be found faster if searching just the dubstep folder, rather than an ""everything"" folder that would then be pulling up the Dubstep version, the breaks version, and the house version I have.   There's simply no point painstakingly copying and moving your files around various folders and sub folders   That only needs to be done once, as soon as I download the track I throw it into its' genre folder.  If it's ""dark"" techno, I'll put ""dark"" in the comments section in the Traktor library, as you are right, no need to waste time throwing it into a sub-genre folder.   I rarely if ever actually go into the folder.   I frequently go into the folders to pull files for listening, so that's why I prefer simple easy to manage folders.   A lot of people like to organize by genre.   Makes the most sense really.   what do you do with the tunes that can be considered multiple genres?   Electronica, boom, problem solved.   I have a very extensive system of tagging and smart playlists that allows me to access the music I need to access when I want making it very easy to freestyle and go through genres easily without having to open a single folder and move a single file.

Yes most of this can be done in Serato or Traktor, but nothing comes close to the customization of smart playlists in iTunes.  I can create a smart playlist that's specifically for tracks that are around 70 bpm and 140 bpm that were made in between 2010 and 2015, that don't include top 40, and are tagged with 3 stars or higher with a few drop-down menus and they automatically populate.

The only thing I have to do is tag the tracks according to my system which I would be doing anyway.  If in that playlist, I only want to find Trap (and not dubstep say), I'll type Trap in the search field and now it only lists tracks that are tagged with trap.  Since I adopted smart playlists, and manual playlists, moving shit around folders just seems clunky and inefficient.

Traktor and Serato and all these folks should learn from the iTunes features that people still use over the build in dj app features.  That to me shows that they're not truly focused on the actual priorities of DJs, and are more about pushing DJing technologies for their own bottom line.   I don't think you understand - I don't pull anything from folders. I never open them up. The files just live there. I never have to look at it or organize it or anything. All the browsing, managing, editing, sorting, etc is done through itunes.

There's no need to know where the files are or where they live or where they go. ALL management is done within the manager - not the desktop   I should have been more clear when I was speaking about managing the files outside of the software, and browsing for tracks while actively mixing.   So you have multiple copies of the same file in different folders because they happen to follow different genres?   No, multiple different tracks that happen to share the same track title or different remixes of the same track.  Easier to find what you are looking for when you don't have to sift through results that you know aren't correct because they aren't the genre you know you're looking for.  Again, that's for managing files while not DJing.   When I want to find a track, I type the name of the track and it appears.   Yup, same as in Traktor, but I wasn't talking about in Traktor as I have already stated, so I don't even know why I'm quoting that and writing this paragraph.....moving on.   again, I don't use folders - playlists replaces them. If I have my master list up and want to browse through dubstep tracks and for whatever reason don't want to click down on my dubstep playlist. I type ""dubstep"" in the search field. Boom. All tracks tagged with dubstep appear, all tracks without dubstep don't appear. I don't have to open a single folder ever.   I find it easiest to select the genre folder in the Traktor browser.   every new track - put in itunes. Automatically copies/moves to the main folder. Still don't care. Don't have to open anything, don't have to open a folder or sub folder or drag and drop it into the specific genre folder. With smart playlists, i type the name of the genre in the field and that's it. It automatically gets put into the relevant playlist.   I like placing my files exactly where I want them, so on this point I say to each their own.   Why when you can just listen in the media manager?   Stuck in my ways, I do it how I do it because that's just how I do it.   absolutely not - if I'm knee-deep in a house mix and want to go into a reggae-influenced house section that means I have to remember which multigenre songs i put in the ""electronic"" folder and then pull that up and root around with all the other multi-genre songs that aren't relevant? Why?   That's not what I was saying. I'm saying throw the track in your electronica folder, and then tag it in Traktor.   I type ""house reggae"" in my search field and all songs tagged with ""house"" and ""reggae"" appear and the ones that aren't don't. If I want to go back to just playing house, I just type ""house"" and there you go.   Exactly, tag your tracks in your browser. Once again though I'm sure there's no need to state this, I wasn't exactly clear on where I was speaking on storing the physical file for organization outside of the DJ software as compared to for organization and search purposes while DJing.   Yes most of this can be done in Serato or Traktor, but nothing comes close to the customization of smart playlists in iTunes.   Again, Serato and Traktor have to step up their game, though that may not be possible due to Apples evil patenting policy which destroys the non-existent ""free market"" which is actually a heavily regulated and severely manipulated market.   I can create a smart playlist that's specifically for tracks that are around 70 bpm and 140 bpm that were made in between 2010 and 2015, that don't include top 40, and are tagged with 3 stars or higher with a few drop-down menus and they automatically populate.    Now that is awesome, I've never had anybody fully describe smart playlists to me, and that is sweet. Perfect for people who do 90s only dance mixes and stuff.   Since I adopted smart playlists, and manual playlists, moving shit around folders just seems clunky and inefficient.   Now I see and understand, and largely agree.   People use them cause that's all they're used to, but when you wrap your ahead around the idea that you never really need to see your files or folders - you just need a way to organize and access your tunes according to your own criteria, it's actually a much more streamlined system.

DJs,3bzozy,dsprox,1 point,Sat Jul 4 21:35:15 2015 UTC,"Traktor and Serato and all these folks should learn from the iTunes features that people still use over the build in dj app features.   Serato's library functions are actually fantastic.  They do have smart playlists, they just aren't as robust as iTunes.  That's one of the reasons I prefer serato just for how intuitive the library system is (although it's not as good if you want to mirror your file/folder structure).   I know and understand, I'm talking about when you actually want to put the file onto another device for listening purposes or what ever your reason may be.   Which you can still do via a manager - you can drag and drop directly from itunes, or you can click ""show in finder/open window"" and it pops open the track in the desktop if you really need it.   Easier to find what you are looking for when you don't have to sift through results that you know aren't correct because they aren't the genre you know you're looking for.   That's simple.  You tag the genre of the remix in the genre field.  That said, if you type the name of the track in the search field, it will just pop up the 4 or 5 versions you might have - not really hard to look through that - especially when genre tags are readily visable.   Stuck in my ways, I do it how I do it because that's just how I do it.   I think that's the main reason people don't like these kind of managers - they were raised on the file/folder/desktop paradigm of computing.  I remember a few years ago, Apple really wanted to to drastically change OSX to something similar where it was less about a desktop and something closer to iOS where everything is accessed within the apps and searchable lists and it was met with a lot of criticism.  Personally, I wouldn't want it either simply because I do want access to the file level to troubleshoot, but for day-to-day music stuff, I'm fine with never having to open a folder.  I use my computer for 4 things on a daily basis:  DJing, Production, internet, and writing.  I can't think of a single one of those where I ever need to root through my folders.  I either access files within the app, or I do a quick spotlight search for what I want and open it from there.  The thing about using folders and traktor is that you are essentially organizing twice.  You need to organize into the file structure, and then you have to create playlists.  I would rather do it all at once and be done with it.  I set Serato to read itunes and it all just mirrors.  I will still create crates within serato when I'm building lists on the fly - like while I'm practicing or at a gig.  It's also useful for file organization offline too - I can create a smart playlist that ensure nothing under 256 gets into my DJ folders and delete the rest, I can quickly find dead tracks through smart playlists and figure out what to ditch or keep.  Add in something like Dougscripts and you have a powerful file management tool.  I get the hate - itunes is bloated (especially for windows); they continually remove or change around layouts and features despite them working perfectly fine; it's obnoxious that I'm forced to use it to manage my iphone; they do shit like change stuff around at the core level breaking compatibility with other programs (like dj software) forcing developers to scramble; it's also ridiculous how they default the program to reorganize your files - a lot of people don't realize you can use iTunes and maintain your own file structure, but because they don't tell you and default that to on, people have lists years worth of file organization due to loading up their collection in itunes.  I've had my database corrupt a few times forcing me to spend hours fixing dead files and re-deleting old tracks because I had to use an older backup and that completely messes up the Date Added field (something I like to sort by).  The only thing that keeps me with iTunes is the smart playlists and the integration of dougscripts.  If Serato's ever get anywhere near as customizable (and they allow nested smartcrates), I might ditch it entirely, but doungscripts are pretty hard to give up..."

It strikes me as someone who is themselves still very new to DJing providing advice to other newbies which is admirable but not always the most helpful (we'd generally call this ""the blind leading the blind"".)  As an example: in the getting started page when talking about cables it says the only real cable a beginner needs is a ""jack cable"" to go from the controller to the speakers... There's no such thing as a ""jack cable."" There are 1/8"" (3.5mm) TRS cables (the kind of connector headphones use to plug in to a laptop or phone,) there are RCA cables (the red/white pairs), XLR cables (one of the most common in audio setups,) 1/4"" TRS cables (sometimes called ""patch cables"" they're the bigger version of the headphone jack type,) and so on.  You need to know what type of output connectors your controller has and what type of input your speakers take. It could be RCA -> RCA, RCA -> XLR, TRS -> XLR, TRS -> TRS, or any number of combinations depending on the controller and speakers. Saying you need a ""jack cable to go to the speakers"" isn't really complete information.  The site needs some work still which I think will come when the person doing the writing gets a bit more experience of their own."

Also depends what mixer you want. If you want to mimic a club setup the least you should be getting is a DJM800, but the XDJRX has the more modern effects in line with the industry standard DJM900... DJM800 has more channels over the XDJRX, though.  I've got 2 CDJ900s and a DJM800 and I love them, but I'd really like a DJM900 but it's too expensive. Personally I love things that are more modular (much more flexibility), and when I want to get some Turntables it'll be easy to add them to the DJM800/900 I'll be rocking at the time."

When playing around with it, I found that the waveforms didn't exactly line up when the songs were matched anyway. If it's really an issue, hit browse and have your library cover the waveforms. Overall the RX feels tight and workflow is very similar to 2 CDJs and a DJM."

I'd go with the XDJ-RX, because it allows you to hook your laptop directly into the unit and use your Rekordbox library from your laptop. No need to use USBs. With 850s you have to export your library every time you add new tunes, even when playing at home. 900s do have the link port though, but you will still need a mixer and ethernet hub in order to use your laptop instead of USB sticks.  I strongly recommend you to go with your laptop at home, as it will save you insane amount of time."

Because I've seen a lot of well paid DJs not use them and progressively turn the system up until it's clipping or just imbalanced in general. And when I say seen, I was the one who had to remind them that it was sounding like shit in the rest of the club and then try to get them to turn it down or use the gains, and about 5 minutes later they would be blasting it again. Yeah people will dance, but it will only dudes and the three girlfriends that were nice enough to stay with their bfs.  Ugh, that was too ranty, but the question stands, do people learn about this and then think they will never have to balance things by ear?"
DJs,3bzcr6,iBeFirinMah4k,1 point,Fri Jul 3 15:50:11 2015 UTC,Lots of songs are simply produced and mixed differently - especially when you start playing older tunes.  It's why gains/trims exist - to even out volume.  Too much reliance on auto this and that has made it that a lot of new Djs don't really understand level control.  Entry level controllers don't even have gains these days...
DJs,3bzcr6,dj_soo,2,Fri Jul 3 23:17:17 2015 UTC,"i use plat notes for everything. Where i feel as if it does from time to time take away some punch, the long term goals, and never having to worry about music not being the same volume/gain while you spin is a huge thing for me. It gives all the tracks an even dynamic which when played through any sort of club system, will be great because it sucks pulling up a track that is too quite.  also in term of loss of punch, i feel some music it happen and some it doesn't, all comes down to how the track was produced and how it was mastered."
DJs,3bzcr6,DJ_Vitu,1 point,Fri Jul 3 15:13:22 2015 UTC,"Can you post some examples? For starters, the volume on the post tracks should usually be lower, so that could possibly be a factor, if you aren't playing them at the same volume. Also, by fixing clipping, it is possible that the post track isn't as punchy as the original. I've noticed that only really in trap though, with some instant party/subtomik/party favor tracks, but this is the exception, not the rule. Personally, out of 1000+ tracks that I've used PN on, only maybe a dozen sound noticeably worse, and I just rerun those tracks to only adjust the volume on them, and not add any warmth, etc."

DJs,3bymqv,SupaSandeep,1 point,Fri Jul 3 06:34:01 2015 UTC,In serato itself. I actually didn't think about looking at the dots to see if it was really effecting my turntables lol. I haven't used real vinyl in so long I didn't think of the obvious analog answer lol. The only reason I thought something was wrong was because for the first time since 08 I used someone else's techs and it didn't do that at all.
DJs,3bymqv,djnickynick,2,Fri Jul 3 07:09:48 2015 UTC,"Look up if there is a turntable repair shop in your city. Call them and make sure they work with 1200s in particular. If so, they should be able to run a diagnostics and check on what is the issue."

DJs,3bymqv,abyde,1 point,Fri Jul 3 07:07:25 2015 UTC,First thing I would do is set your pitch so one of the rows of dots on the platter is completely static. Watch this for a minute or so and see if it wavers at all. If the dots move then you know the turntable is the issue. Also try using a different vinyl as the type of pitch fluctuation you are talking about could be caused by the record itself being slightly warped .

It turned out that the drive was just old and/or kinda shitty and ended up having to be replaced due to corrupted segments.  It was a good seagate hard drive (although I got it on sale from groupon). Have you ran a chkdsk on the drive to see how she's holding up?   EDIT: also, if your version of Traktor is pirated it may also be a bug. If it's not just a recent problem I'd suggest finding a new copy of the software."
DJs,3bx3sk,BentonLewis,1 point,Thu Jul 2 23:42:01 2015 UTC,I see you fixed it. Just so you know:  Traktor tells you that the songs must be in your collection for analyzing to work. Replacing locked values is for when they were locked in Traktor.

DJs,3btfnh,camDaze,6,Thu Jul 2 01:35:22 2015 UTC,"Dude is being a jerk to be sure, but isn't the crux of the issue conflating artistry with performance? Say 100 years ago or more, a producer/composer would command an orchestra. It's a spectacle. Now the orchestra is in a computer and there's little performance to accompany the artistry. People still want to enjoy it communally, but there just isn't much to perform."
DJs,3btfnh,Dawnbreaka,6,Thu Jul 2 06:36:08 2015 UTC,"I disagree.  It's true producers/DJs these days can 'just push play' and walk away, but that's a lazy approach which most likely will be frowned upon by fans.  People go to see live shows because they want the experience of seeing how a producer approaches their own music in a live space.  What songs does the producer choose to surround their own work in a mix?  How excited do they get when the mix sounds great?  What parts of a song do they feel is most important?  How well do they feel and control the energy of the room?   This is the same spectacle as the conductor from 100 years ago really getting into it with the orchestra, only now we get to see the joy and energy of the producer as they conduct two orchestras simultaneously creating something new right in front of our eyes."
DJs,3btfnh,SnarfingChicken,12,Thu Jul 2 09:14:58 2015 UTC,unfortunately this is not true at all in the environment of an EDM festival.  the biggest stage will always be for the biggest name at that moment.  they will likely be a producer with no dj chops and they could not touch a single fader and the vast majority of the crowd won't know the difference and will say they played the best dj set they've ever seen.
DJs,3btfnh,anderson7,4,Thu Jul 2 10:35:59 2015 UTC,"I think it's a stretch to say that mainstage DJs likely have no DJ chops. Even producers who are mixing averse like Avicii have learned to beatmatch and actually mix.  3lau is taking this to another level...basically flaunting the fact that he is not mixing (besides using Ableton) and also saying that mixing and playing with spontaneity is pase.   But you're right - people will still respond if it isn't ""live mixed"", but the large contigent of people who say that DJing is easy will also be validated, which sucks.   Also - wouldn't it be boring and awkward as hell to just stand on stage while your mix plays?"

DJs,3btfnh,dsprox,4,Thu Jul 2 05:09:48 2015 UTC,"Ableton live and a launchpad   That's okay when you are Daft Punk and you are using more than just a launchpad to do actual real live remix sets.  Or if you're producing a studio recorded mix for commercial sale and you're trying to present the top mixes from your top producers for your label.  If you're just a DJ though, yeah, do it live.  My sets are pretty prepared, but not to the point where I can just press play and step back.  The preparation is getting songs together I know will be able to be mixed together, so the most preplanned aspect of the set it track order because that is more or less determined by track selection if you're doing a themed hour long mix.  The transitions, effects, and actual mixing are all live though."
DJs,3btfnh,CDClock,1 point,Thu Jul 2 06:39:24 2015 UTC,So basically what you're saying is its not live lol
DJs,3btfnh,dsprox,5,Thu Jul 2 11:54:55 2015 UTC,"So basically what you're saying is its not live   No, I'm saying it's as live as you make it.  Every set is prepared in some way, even sets where you are randomly choosing tracks from your library, because you still prepared the set by having those tracks purchased and in your library ready to play.  Daft Punk Alive 2007 was live and awesome.  My mixes are done live though. I prepare what tracks I want to use first if I'm recording a mix to put online, but past that the only ""preprogrammed"" aspect will be track order.  Other than that, the mix itself is entirely live, me cueing up the next track and bringing it in where and how I want."
DJs,3btfnh,tagme420,2,Thu Jul 2 14:50:03 2015 UTC,True. Pre planned set means that if the crowd is not digging the vibe you are going down you are not going to be receptive to it and just keep mixing your playlist. It's nice to have a backup plan and all but I usually only pick the first 2 or 3 songs and flow from there during the set.
DJs,3btfnh,CDClock,2,Thu Jul 2 13:37:59 2015 UTC,Ya same or I'll group similar songs together in my playlist so I have like 5 options to choose from if I can't think of anything
DJs,3btfnh,antieverything,3,Thu Jul 2 13:47:19 2015 UTC,"First off...he uses Ableton and an APC80. That said, yeah, his sets are preplanned so it doesn't really matter what he uses. One could, however, use that setup to do a lot of really impressive and improvisational stuff...stuff I would argue goes far beyond what is possible with more traditional gear. Ableton =/= automated or even preplanned sets.  Second, saying ""even Skrillex"" seems meant to imply that he is low-skill when the reality of constant touring sort of makes that impossible after a year or so (this accusation gets levied at a lot of guys but there's no way a guy doesn't know his way around the booth after months of playing every night). Also, he plays real instruments which is already far more skill intensive than any form of djing short of turntablism. Switching from Ableton to CDJs in no way invalidates Ableton as a legitimate and powerful performance platform. His actual stated reason was reliability and consistency. I can imagine some people would really enjoy CDJs more but anyone who has experienced how powerful Ableton can be isn't going to switch just because they suddenly realize they need to get serious. Ableton is really fucking serious."
DJs,3btfnh,krixo,6,Thu Jul 2 06:24:33 2015 UTC,"You're not wrong in your point about Ableton being a serious and possibly more inventive way to DJ. But I'm pretty sure 3lau is simply mapping his songs to the pads on the APC and just pushing them in order. I saw him in a small club once, and he at times wasn't even twisting knobs on transitions, making me wonder if even his EQ and volumes in transitions were pre-mapped.   He did use the smoke cannon a ton tho..so there's that."
DJs,3btfnh,RDVST,0,Thu Jul 2 15:30:18 2015 UTC,Maybe he's just very subtly calling out Z-trip's smoke cannon usage?

I haven't been posting regularly on /r/DJs in the past few months, but is this not a prevailing viewpoint among plenty of people on here, and particularly the DJ Tech Tools crowd?  I'm almost certain I've seen people on here claiming that actually playing records like a normal person is ""boring as fuck"" and totally antiquated, and that live remixes or whatever you want to call mashing hotcues on four different loops is fresh and original and sounds much better and it's the way of the future.  As absurd as you think the viewpoint is, I suppose if enough people believe in it, it is paradigm-shifting. I guess this is something we're going to have to deal with as pop-EDM continues to co-opt the music scene, and newer EDM personalities get booked along side established DJ's and artists."

We've had several Chauvet products do what you're describing over the year. You're welcome to call Chauvet service. At 24-36 months old, they'll still assist you, likely for free or for a nominally small charge.  Fair warning, they're French and expect ever cliche thing you've known about telemarketing, terrible tech support and the French COMBINED.  We've sent a few products back to them, first one they held for 6 weeks, and returned it to us in exactly the same broken state as before. We sent it back a second time, on second time they kept it only 2 weeks. (mainly because I constantly called their office for updates). They sent it back to us again, claiming to be fixed, even with a breakdown of what they replaced. BS. Still broken.   Finally, I flipped lid and refused their suggestion to send the unit again for a third time and demanded they send me a new one. They actually did.   Ironically, I compared the new one to the old one and was able to repair the logic board to the old one and now how two functioning units.

Better get used to this, kid... 99.99% of Djs are douchebags, especially on the auld interweb.  If you're only starting out, best to just get yourself a budget controller of some sort. Spend maybe a hundred bucks on it and then chose your software(Traktor is good, I'm not advocating cracking it. But if you find yourself lacking a certain moral fibre you could do that). The software should will be easy enough to get your head around unless you're a complete dope(millions of tuts online) So main thing to focus on first will be what tunes you're playing and the quality of them. Rule of thumb is never play any mp3 below 320kbps(and for gods sake DO NOT rip off youtube or similar) and really you should be using a lossless format like wav or flac. Mixing lots of different styles is cool, but you might want to focus on something a bit more uniform first like techno, house, dubstep or whatever floats your boat the most. Listen to other people's mixes, learn more about tunes and although I said DO NOT(please don't) rip from youtube it is an invaluable resource for coming across wicked new tunes.  Once you're comfortable with all that, then start looking at getting a more serious set up. By then you should have started to learn what it is you need anyways...  Hope this helps!"

There is a groove in the brass motor spindle that the belt needs to be seated in. If the belt is able to ride up or down on the spindle, so it is wrapped either above or below the groove, the platter will spin too fast.   Re-position the belt so that it is wrapped around the spindle's groove.   If the belt slips out of the groove when the turntable is played, and is able to ride up or down on the spindle, you'll need to adjust the position of the belt on the inner ring of the platter. The inner ring of the platter is quite a bit wider than the belt itself. The belt should wrap around the middle part of the inner ring. If it is wrapped too high or too low around the inner ring, it could cause the other half of the belt to ride up or down on the spindle."

Even if you're not mixing, it's nice to be able to preview tracks in your headphones even if you only need to occasionally. For that reason alone I'd recommend a proper DJ mixer assuming you're using a standard two cd-player/turntable and a microphone setup. You'd only need a traditional mixer If you're using more than three inputs.   Now if you're playing your music off of a computer, I'd seriously recommend looking into a controller instead of a mixer. Even the most basic controllers usually come with compatible software and you'll find having a controller makes a world of difference in convenience.   Also don't fixate on XLR outputs. A balanced TRS is exactly the same thing with a different connector. You'll just need a TRS to XLR adapter if you're plugging into a device with only XLRs. You'll also find most modern mixers and powered speakers use a hybrid XLR/TRS input."

I simply just what to replace the mixer with something simply small and light that will give me the same sound as what I'm using now. I really don't need anything too fancy. Just some rca inputs and some outputs
DJs,3botk5,robots_nirvana,1 point,Tue Jun 30 23:57:59 2015 UTC,"In this case you could think about dropping both mixer and controller and get any controller that has a standalone mixer function & XLR outs. e.g. Denon MC 6000 which is a popular choice of wedding DJs.  If you want to keep the mixer in your setup I would recommend one of the smaller XONE (XONE:22) or Pioneer Mixers (DJM 350) they have a great build quality and you are on the sure side regarding your sound quality.  I know there is a lot of shit talk about Behringer Mixers, but my experience with those is really bad too.  I think the bit more expensive Numarks, Reloop, Denon are always a save choice!"
DJs,3botk5,BTallack,1 point,Wed Jul 1 13:10:42 2015 UTC,So would a Denon DN-X120 DJ Mixer work just as well? I could go from that output to an xlr correct?
DJs,3botk5,djdiggla,1 point,Wed Jul 1 00:13:43 2015 UTC,"Yes it would.  You might however consider just buying a better controller than the one that you have.  I myself just use a Pioneer DDJ-SX for everything eliminating the need for a separate mixer.  There are several options under $300 that would have a microphone input and balanced outputs.   Even more options if you're willing to buy used.  I picked up a used Novation Twitch as a backup for under $200 shipped and despite being a bit older of a controller, it unlocks the full version of Serato DJ"
DJs,3botk5,brkdncr,1 point,Wed Jul 1 04:38:36 2015 UTC,I'd consider a used Pioneer DJM 400 or 909. Pioneer has pretty great sound and efx which especially if you are not mixing or doing wedding the efx can be a nice transition. I know the 909 has XLR in addition to rca. Mic input too. They are nice mixers and I've seen them going for around $400 on eBay and even as cheap as $200. Just to put it in perspective the 909 was $1500 when it came out so that's a pretty great deal. Sturdy and will last a long time. I'd go with the 400 first because usually they are cheaper and sometimes the touch screen on the 909 can get glitchy.
DJs,3botk5,brkdncr,1 point,Wed Jul 1 02:51:12 2015 UTC,I checked out that mixer you already have. Why not try and find a replacement power supply? Wharfdale makes decent equipment.  For what you're doing you don't need anything special. Something as simple as a denon x120 would probably be more than enough. Just make sure you have the right cables to connect everything.
DJs,3botk5,playuhh,1 point,Wed Jul 1 04:39:41 2015 UTC,"I was also looking at a Allen & Heath zed 10. What would you recommend going with, between the zed 10 or the denon x120? I looked at the other board you recommended but sub powered birds make me a little nervous (have had two numark mix pros go on me already). I like that Allen one a lot but worry if it will be loud enough or comparable to my current board."
DJs,3bpih7,dp6194,8,Wed Jul 1 02:49:16 2015 UTC,The promoter mentioned that I'd be paid based on how many people I begin. I will probably bring around 70 people.    This is when alarm bells should go off and you tell the promoter to go suck a bag of dicks  ... politely of course.

DJs,3bpih7,mcflyjr,4,Wed Jul 1 03:15:31 2015 UTC,"I used to DJ and did a fair amount of gigs.  Being paid per person brought is an alarm bell ringer for sure.  They're not paying you for your DJing, they're paying you to populate the show.  It's the wrong way to get into the business, and not the type of ""in"" you should look for.  IME, these types of shows tend to be absolutely bare ass empty venues that no one shows up to..."
DJs,3bpih7,ClownTaint,2,Wed Jul 1 04:47:24 2015 UTC,"Right, you just have to politely say ""I'm not a promoter. I'm a DJ, and not a particularly well-known one. I have a lot of friends but they don't want to come watch me DJ the same place every weekend. Sorry but if you want me to promote you're also going to have to pay me for that."""
DJs,3bpih7,mcflyjr,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:37:40 2015 UTC,"The guy who contacted me was actually really cool. He was looking at a bunch of other DJ's but picked me after hearing my mix. Like I've mentioned before, even if I don't get paid that much I won't be salty but is there anyway I should have negotiated? I just wanted some exposure. The venue is pretty legit."
DJs,3bpih7,Dubliminal,1 point,Wed Jul 1 22:08:43 2015 UTC,"They were just looking for a last-minute opener and I guess I got lucky. The venue is actually a well-known venue, that's why I thought this was a good opportunity to get some exposure. I would've done this event for free if it meant networking and getting some experience.   By the looks of it though, the venue does get packed out week-in/week-out. Is there any other way I should have negotiated compensation? Again, I really won't be salty as long as they pay me something lol."
DJs,3bpih7,Getto425,1 point,Wed Jul 1 22:07:17 2015 UTC,"Arguably, in many places throughout the US and probably elsewhere have this new ""standard"" and that's that the DJs are required to promote the party.   The issue with it is that when you start buying into these events, if you can't bring anyone you can't get gigs. No one cares about talent in this type of setting. It's all about how many people you can bring.   Is this entirely a bad thing? It can be. But realistically you have to adapt or get left behind.   How would I have negotiated it?  Depends. Take my advice with a grain of salt, but ideally I would have pushed for at least a base pay that I'm guaranteed, and then set something like a bonus for bringing more people.   In my town nearly every party thrower is sketchy as fuck. I've been screwed out of pay multiple times. There's horror stories of countless other things going on.   There's no shortage of new meat DJs to help support these event managers by filling in slots, either paying for free or for drinks.   What I'm proposing sets the stage of a professional approach. Pay me no matter what for my job, which is to DJ, and create an incentive to help promote your show.   If I took that approach, I may have gone much further. Instead I was willing to take all these crummy gigs and ended up not progressing anywhere because I didn't know enough people locally to singlehandedly fill a bar/club.   Playtime is good more often than not.   But you have to be careful about what you're willing to accept and what may be the consequences of playing a show."
DJs,3bpih7,Getto425,1 point,Wed Jul 1 22:18:32 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the solid advice, it's a rough one. But since I want to work in the event industry I guess this is a really good experience for me to learn the ins and outs.  Well I want to clarify I'm just opening up for the night, so I'm very easily replaceable especially in the over-saturated industry.  On top of getting ""paid per person"" I'm planning on networking with the team so that I can get more opportunities in the future (they work a lot of events in the area). Also maybe ask for some free drinks too..However, if I am getting paid-per-person why would that mean I'm playing for free? I'm going to get my money at the night's end haha"

If I'm tuning into a DJ set, I'm looking forward to the tracks which the particular DJ likes to play, maybe some unreleased stuff and mixing/scratching/transitions, depending on who's playing. With the model-covered videos, I listen to those to hear songs I probably haven't heard before but I treat it as a continuous playlist which will hopefully contain similarly themed tracks. I'm not expecting anything out of the actual mixing in this case. So, even though some of the ladies there are very attractive, having them on the thumbnail suggests to me that the author is compensating for whatever the set itself lacks."

Some people mistakenly assume that musicians and entertainers must obtain licenses to perform copyrighted music or that businesses where music is performed can shift their responsibility to musicians or entertainers.

Since it is the business owner who obtains the ultimate benefit from the performance, it is the business owner who obtains the license. Music license fees are one of the many costs of doing business.   Edit: Spotify has limitations on how their music can be used.

DJs,3biljs,WattageandTwattage,1 point,Mon Jun 29 15:38:33 2015 UTC,Lately I've been trying to scratch in more tracks to change tempo but I'm not that great at it yet. I use a lot of transition tracks because the right ones sound awesome. I usually play electro and twerk so 128 and 100
DJs,3biljs,Oldmangramps,1 point,Tue Jun 30 00:08:30 2015 UTC,"personally I don't like them just because it screws up with organizing my library.  that being said, they're useful tool to getting in/out of 100 to 128 bpm which can be a little difficult sometimes"
DJs,3biljs,IAmAFuckingGenius,1 point,Tue Jun 30 00:31:38 2015 UTC,"Sometimes they hit right but djs today, (speaking as a dj and production designer of a major night club),abuse them to be lazy and make the night easier. Playing chart bangers in succession and failing to dynamically program your sets to make the night yours is just a plain waste of time and space."

DJs,3bjb3i,DrazeSound,5,Mon Jun 29 18:12:37 2015 UTC,"I'm expecting an upgraded version of the XDJ-1000 to drop this year and possibly a refresh of the CDJ 2000 nexus, but I don't know what kind of functionality could be added in.  If it's a new mixer the only thing I'd possibly predict is them putting some of the RMX-1000 functions into the mixer. I'm not sure what else would happen. I'd love the CDJ/DJM system to have a price decrease overall.  Also should be noted was the Pioneer acquisition this year in terms of the holdings company that now owns shares of it. Possibly they will want to take some of their efforts towards more ""mid-level"" gear that can be used by consumers, rather than focussing on equipment being sold and used in clubs. Just some 2 cents."
DJs,3bjb3i,Methionine,4,Mon Jun 29 20:12:03 2015 UTC,"The upgraded version of the XDJ-RX is a shure bet. 8 pads full RGB, a 7"" inch platter, color screen and (maybe) 4 channel support with Traktor. Not shure if I wanna call it a flagship, but its shurely an expected upgrade if you look at the DDJ-SX/SZ. And also a ridicolous pricetag not to forget !"

DJs,3bkb1f,legndjo,5,Mon Jun 29 22:34:06 2015 UTC,"If your looking to go laptop, why not just go HID mode with the setup you have?  Get yourself a Serato Box, and you are set. You can now use HID, Timecode CD or vinyl in a club. Most venues should have some kind of CDJ.  While controllers are great, I am a fan of modular setups in this case you still have your CDJs, which can use CDs and Rekordbox if you need too.  Maybe chuck the extra cash at some bags/cases."
DJs,3bkb1f,gus_honeybun,2,Mon Jun 29 22:57:06 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the quick reply.  Modular setups are pretty nice considering you can replace a single piece if it breaks instead of everything.  I guess I will be doing HID in the future with a Rane Sixty Two or SL Box + other mixer.  I guess my main concern is portability because one of the reasons why I was considering getting a DDJ-SX2 is that I currently only do small gigs/parties. (Probably what I'll be playing at for the next year too)  Also, to clarify, I would be selling my CDJs + mixer in the process to get a laptop and DDJ-SX2"
DJs,3bkb1f,gus_honeybun,3,Mon Jun 29 23:10:41 2015 UTC,"Well if you are keen on a SX2, It is a very nice bit of kit, I use one regulalry. If you are used to CDJs you will feel right at home with it."
DJs,3bkb1f,AGreen513,3,Mon Jun 29 23:43:23 2015 UTC,"This is true.. But if you're like me, heavy-handed and likes to rage when djing, the SX and SX2 is too tiny. Everything is bunched together and that causes me to f up by accidentally hitting buttons. And the platters are complete ass. But to each their own... My vote is the Sixty Two over the SX2"
DJs,3bkb1f,gus_honeybun,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:22:32 2015 UTC,"Ahaha well, this SX2 is not mine, it gets left setup in a bar i work at by another resident midweek, so I just plug into that, over using the crap equipment this bar has, its nice, but I still prefer my Timecode/HID setup."
DJs,3bkb1f,AGreen513,3,Fri Jul 3 00:03:11 2015 UTC,"Don't sell your js.. get a better mixer like the 62 that you want.... I'm a 1200's guy but I started small and worked my way up. I'm on my 4th pair of 1200's now so buying and selling is something I do a lot. But I think you will regret selling your j's. I have always kept one set of 1200's to have on hand at all times... You want to get better and practice right? Keep them in your crib to practice with the 62, I swear you will love this setup... Also, I've bought and sold all of the big controllers and I'm not a fan of the ddjsx. The sx2 is pretty much the same with a couple more bells and whistles...  IMO, keep your cdjs and buy a 62 first. Then save and buy an SX2. You can gig with the cdjs... Beside my 1200's, my 62 has been my best/favorite investment. It's such a great mixer. The SL57MKII is dope too."
DJs,3bkb1f,bxc_thunder,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:19:28 2015 UTC,"I have been thinking about that too. I really like the modularity of my current setup. A TTM57SL MK2 would basically give me all the features of Serato and the feel of my CDJs. Also, in response to your other post, individual cases seem like the way to go vs. flight cases."
DJs,3bkb1f,bxc_thunder,2,Thu Jul 2 22:46:32 2015 UTC,"IMO you should go with the SX2. You get more bang for your buck, and as you said, it's way more portable than 2 CDJs and a mixer. There was a thread on here not too long ago comparing controllers to CDJs and the general conscientious was that people preferred owning controllers."
DJs,3bkb1f,AGreen513,1 point,Tue Jun 30 04:31:20 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the suggestion, I'm leaning more towards the SX2 now. Can you link the thread? It would be an interesting read."
DJs,3bkb1f,Usagii_YO,2,Tue Jun 30 06:03:27 2015 UTC,No problem! Here's the thread. It's definitely an entertaining read.
DJs,3bkb1f,marcusthejames,2,Tue Jun 30 06:36:24 2015 UTC,"Not a chance. Buy two single flight cases for each CDJ and one for that 62 you want.    Flight cases for the SX2 arent' as portable as you think. The one I had didn't have wheels and it was still heavy. And you have to carry it one handed.... I carry two flight cases with turntables, one in each hand to balance the load. Mixer and laptop in back pack or I just make two trips."

DJs,3biaku,nannaloora,3,Mon Jun 29 13:25:20 2015 UTC,Just buy a pair of cheap CDJ's that have USB support. Few years ago I got some NDX400s and a mixer for like £400 which is pretty reasonable. Even though I now mainly use Technics with vinyl and serato I still use my cdjs frequently enough.  Controllers are very boring in my eyes but that's a matter of preference!
DJs,3biaku,Swindel92,1 point,Mon Jun 29 14:06:10 2015 UTC,"Can you store cue points or do you have to set them each time you load a track? I've got American Audio Radius 2Ks, which read from USB/memory cards but it's such a ball ache having to set the cue points that I'm looking into using them with Traktor."
DJs,3biaku,daddy-dj,1 point,Mon Jun 29 17:00:26 2015 UTC,Nah I'm afraid not. Don't get me wrong you can store like 3 or something while they're on. I usually just cue on the spot so I've not bothered with it.   It would be easy enough to just overwrite them each time you've used one though. Traktor would suit because you can save all that!

DJs,3biaku,daddy-dj,2,Tue Jun 30 07:11:00 2015 UTC,"If you do go for the controller option, then look at Pioneer XDJ-RX. It's not really a controller, but its like have a CDJ/DJM bundle. you can use USB's, Rekordbox etc as normal CDJ's. It just does not have CD slots.  I've used it before and it really feels like normal CDJ/DJM.   I know its a bit over your budget, but I think its worth it."

DJs,3biaku,CRYTEK_T-REX,2,Mon Jun 29 17:48:52 2015 UTC,"Came here to say this.  These are what I use and love them.  Cd, mp3 cd, and USB support.  Relatively cheap, you should be able to find them used on eBay for under $300 each."
DJs,3biaku,alu_,1 point,Mon Jun 29 18:20:51 2015 UTC,"What exactly is your budget? For fairly cheap (regarding DJ hardware, and a full set up) you could grab some cheaper USB playback CD decks like the Numark NDX 500's and a cheap mixer. This will probably still run you about $600. There are some all-in-one controller/station things. 1st one that comes to mind is the Stanton SCS 4DJ which appears to be on major clearance or something right now."
DJs,3biaku,junglizer,1 point,Mon Jun 29 14:08:53 2015 UTC,"Preferably less than €500. I'm wondering if there's some nice table somewhere that lists specs for the most commonly used decks, so that I could directly see which ones have the USB feature.  What are the major differences between Stanton SCS 4DJ and XDJ 1000?"
DJs,3biaku,junglizer,2,Mon Jun 29 14:13:38 2015 UTC,"Gear changes pretty frequently, so I think it would be difficult to find such a table, especially a current one.   If you're referring to the Pioneer XDJ-1000, it's a standalone player, basically just like a CDJ but w/o the CD drive, and a touchscreen for some controls. Since they're about $1,000 USD, and you'd need a pair and a mixer pretty far out of your range.   As some others mentioned there are the Pioneer standalone units like the XDJ-R1 or the newer RX."

I would get a continuity checker and make sure they are good from cartridge connector down to the rca jack, and then make sure that the two hot leads have zero continuity. And then make sure the hots have no continuity to ground. Grounds are common so they will show continuity with each other.   Also check the cartridge to tonearm connection. Those contacts should be clean and clear.   Outside of these things, check the preamp or somewhere else in the audio chain.   But honestly it sounds like one of your wires is shorting to ground."

DJs,3bgd2d,Jdazzle217,1 point,Mon Jun 29 08:12:53 2015 UTC,"It's a problem with prog house and even people like Avicii know it. The Avicii by Avicii remix album of True was basically created to make the songs more danceable so he could actually play them at concerts (source: one of his Levels podcasts).  IMO prog house is on way out. Deep House and Future House (hate that term but guys like Oliver Heldens and Tchami etc.) are filling the niche prog house had. I could be totally wrong and Avicii's new album could be a genre saving album but to me it seems unlikely. I loved to listen to prog house, I loved the feel good melodic sound to it, but that's exactly the problem.   The best solution I've come up with is looping a kick from another track or different part of the song. Mixing in a build up like halfway through a long breakdown can help sometimes. Also editing the tracks yourself can be helpful. If all else fails make heart hands, dance around and act like you're actually doing something.  TL;DR it's tricky and everyone knows. Try looping a drum to keep the beat going or editing the track. If that doesn't work go full Aoki and start throwing cake at people."
DJs,3bgd2d,kiune_pickupdance,1 point,Mon Jun 29 22:01:24 2015 UTC,"This is a super common question I get by my dance students, and yeah, I timed the quiet sections on some tracks, and it can go on for 2 minutes or more sometimes.  I dislike DJs that do it too frequently - a rest, OK.  Every other track, cuts the energy. For beginners, I recommend my shoulder rolls lesson  Do them slower than the rhythm (off-rhythm) until the beat starts coming back in.  Then build up your dance as the music crescendos.  As you get better, there's a lot more you can do, such as doing liquid popping (again, slow).  It's a good question.  Hopefully, I can get around to teaching basic liquid on my dance channel or on my House Dance/EDM programs"

When prepping my 2 hour show,  every track gets analysed and checked in traktor, then arranged in order by genre and musical key.   Every track gets a load marker and a fade out marker so that the whole set would play itself on traktors auto cruise mode with sync turned on, I tend to listen to it first this way to check for any issues (incorrect key etc) before the live gig.

From there I arrange by key so that the songs can transition effectively. That's when I'll start playing to see if the songs then work together rhythmically and with solid phrasing. A few runs and I'll see that certain songs fit better, I'll do a bit more arranging, and then I'll have a set list and play that through and record it, generally once or twice."

Even with my 1000s of videos, I currently just have mine set up in decades folders (1950s, 1960s, etc) because even the artists with the most videos in decade don't really top 30.

This is just another neat idea that will never really take off- the bit rate on the stems is not something I'm crazy about. I want to be psyched for the stems, if only for easier to get acapellas in the future.  Edit:I realize that they may go lossless in the future for even more $...we will see when the time comes."
DJs,3b735e,digitude,8,Fri Jun 26 16:31:52 2015 UTC,"Man, the comments on that article are just sad. This should've been standardized along with AAC a long time ago and will make for literally seamless sets, though I kinda like how surround sound handles it better (2 center mono channels and 2 stereo channels). Hell, it's what a lot of people already do except they either have to cut up their own tracks or take up tons of cues and loop like a madman. The only thing I can think that would let the world of creativity thrive more is if quantum computing allowed you to dry a wet sample. Oh, and of course if we fixed all our broken copyright laws."
DJs,3b735e,djfluffl3,8,Fri Jun 26 15:29:04 2015 UTC,"The comments are pretty accurate IMO. Realistically, how many producers are going to export their tracks like this? All the stems are going to have to be mastered, so apart from the labels listed here (major labels in terms of electronic music) which ones are going to have the stems mastered at additional cost? One of the benefits of playing a liveset and using unmastered stems in Ableton is the sound quality. There's no headroom left in these mastered stems so you lose sound quality. This is going to end up as another one of NI's failed experiments."
DJs,3b735e,ih8ericsdog,9,Fri Jun 26 16:26:00 2015 UTC,"This is the big problem. Anyone who thinks this is a good idea does not understand how mastering works. If you play all four stems tracks simultaneously, chances are it's going to sound like unbalanced, unmixed hot garbage. Mastering the tracks separately to be played simultaneously would be a huge problem for engineers.  This is a good look for remixers who'll now have access to isolated elements; but for DJs, it's really a pointless tool that's not going to sound good."

Like that's stopped anyone before? It's a definite improvement over playing three looped tracks over top of each other with flanger on one, short delay on the other, a resonant filter on the third, with drums in kontakt added in, all playing into a redlined mixer."
DJs,3b735e,inkosana,2,Fri Jun 26 19:03:15 2015 UTC,They are not going to be mastered; Traktor runs a basic mastering chain inside when it runs a stem file.
DJs,3b735e,golergka,2,Fri Jun 26 19:56:04 2015 UTC,"Do you have a source for this? If they're unmastered then that's a plus. However: I'm not sure how many people here have had their tracks mastered professionally - some studios do NOT do transparent mastering. I've had tracks returned to me with a lot of nice analogue saturation from the gear they've used, they sound amazing but way different than the premasters. Could mean a bass stem sounds way different under Traktor's mastering chain than it does from the studio."

DJs,3b735e,djfluffl3,1 point,Sat Jun 27 01:49:37 2015 UTC,"Steps to add headroom: turn the gain down. That aside, it's not going to be mastered so your compressors/limiters/autogain/etc can easily process them with the rest of the remix decks. It really not any extra expense because they're essentially agreeing to multi-format their releases with the same stems as they're produced.  Honestly I absolutely love NI's remix decks, just that there isn't much you can use them for without essentially becoming a producer yourself (or more technically, an audio surgeon)."
DJs,3b735e,djfluffl3,1 point,Sat Jun 27 01:46:46 2015 UTC,"Turning the gain down does not add headroom if the sounds have been compressed to peak at 0db (I know they're not going to be mastered but I figured it's still worth mentioning). I use the remix decks too - even if you aren't a producer surely they're still easy to use? You can literally download any loop pack and load it up, it's not difficult at all."
DJs,3b735e,ih8ericsdog,1 point,Sat Jun 27 09:25:12 2015 UTC,"Didn't mean they're hard to use, just that there aren't enough tracks released to use them so you either need to build your own track (your way) or open a track in a DAW and cut, phase-invert, etc until you have some layers separated (and it takes a lot of skill to make them clean).  I personally want more variation beyond 4bar loops; it'd be nice to have subtle, natural variation across tracks so it feels more like one long song than a mix glued together by loops. I guess you could argue the same for individual tracks from some producers haha."

Don't really look it tho thanks to my Asian genes.  The shows and nights I go to tend to be more mature with more forward thinking music tho.  The thought of listening to ""edm"" with a bunch of high 20 year olds definitely doesn't appeal in the least.  Problem is I often get mistaken for a drug dealer...  A lot of it is social pressure - clubbing and partying is something you do when you're younger and then you're supposed to grow out of it.  It's stupid tho - music, dance, revelry, and community is something you can enjoy at any age.  It's just that the scene is often associated with abuse of alcohol and drugs which is something that tends to occur more with younger people.

DJs,3b86pk,GirtyGirty,2,Sat Jun 27 07:23:11 2015 UTC,"This may sound pretty depressing, and my evidence is mostly anecdotal, but I think its pretty common for people to loose interest in seeking out (new) music as they get older. People grow up, priorities change. It's harder to go out every weekend when you know you have to wake up on Saturday/Sunday morning to take care of a dog or a kid or errands or whatever.   Some people are into dance music because its a fun/easy way meet girls (or guys), maybe get lucky. As you get older this increasingly less successful/important. (One of my best friends used to always be down to go to shows and try to meet a cute girl, now he's got a relationship lost his interest in dance music.)  The artists that are performing are older because it takes time and hard work to build a solid body of work and a fallowing. For every touring 30-40 year old DJ, there are probably hundreds of dudes with crates of old records in their basement collecting dust, or who just play at home.   Though the drugs are not essential to enjoy the music/scene, there are a lot of people who are into the music, because its a fun setting to do fun drugs. As you get older a lot of people stop casually doing drugs (and may or may not leave the scene/music behind), or end up developing a problem.   There's an older crowd out there that still truly loves the music and is stick with it, going to shows and partying, but they just party with different crowds and with different tastes. They aren't going to EDC, they are at Burning Man (and bringing their kids along with them!) or going to small clubs to see good underground DJ's (Kevin Saunderson playing at Public Works in SF on Function 1 Sound System), rather than going to 'Popular Nightclubs' or concert venues to see the latest EDM superstar (i.e. Tiesto headlining 1 night at the Bill Gram Civic Center).  These are just some of my thoughts."
DJs,3b86pk,Jamerb75,3,Fri Jun 26 22:51:30 2015 UTC,"I'm one of those 30 somethings that is still into new music. This might sound odd to you but my music playlist consists of songs and mixes from anything ranging from underground dnb and dubstep and chill out to breaks and bro-steppy glitch hop and trap... I've been into electronic music since listening to house mixes in the 90's, though oddly I don't really follow current house or trance. And even more odd I would like to see Bro Safari perform (on the other hand I know he started out as Evol Intent from his neurofunk days).   It's all a big blend to me.   Before the bros and hipsters got into it, electronic music was a big past time for me, but still wasn't big enough as I wasn't into doing drugs and did not know anyone who would want to club with me. (aside: if you listened to music that neither mainstream or hipster folk listen to, would you just be ""weird""?)   So I set myself with a lose-lose situation right there. I've kept the music so isolated from every activity usually associated with the music that I feel I'm not getting the full experience. I held back a lot in my college days, and then I had more freedom after I graduated. I started going to some clubs after that. From my few experiences in clubs, I find the club scene mostly sucking in my town. With that said, EDC and Lolla are still on my bucket list. But I still want to check out local DJs who might be playing some neuro or deep dubstep for example."

It's not just music - it's movies, books, food, etc.    Although I know plenty of older people that still party like they're 20, it definitely takes it's toll on you.  When you're younger you could go to a multi-day festival and take 4 pills on friday, drop acid on saturday, and snort ketamine on sunday all the while chugging back alcohol like water and then rest for a few days and be ready to party some more on Wednesday.

If it's close enough, I'll sometimes just go for a night and I've had my fill.

Most of my friends are around my age but we definitely see the younger crowd moving in. The nice thing is there's also an older crowd, in their 40s and 50s, who come out and rock out with us, so it becomes like one big family. But none of us really do the whole festival DJ thing because none of us like that music.   DJing takes time to master, and older DJs have spent a lot of time practicing and working to be great. Younger DJs will get there, but those DJs in their 30s are only a small group of what was probably MANY more that stopped.  And having families and full time jobs switches your priorities something fierce."

(I started out with a Mixtrack Pro 2)  I'm not a big DJ by any means and I've only done a few small gigs so I'm not sure if I'm the best person to be asking but I will give my insight on it. At small parties, I feel that one of the most important pieces of gear is speakers. It doesn't have to be anything really special but it certainly shouldn't be your computer speakers or studio monitors.  Lights are a nice touch too!

If your chosen genre is the ""new hotness"" then you more often than not get a proportional amount of douchebags spinning that genre because they want to ride the popularity wave.  When Dubstep first started, it was mostly backpackers and elitists. Then stuff like Skrillex and Zedd came about and everyone jumped on the hype train.

DJs,3b7wb8,tsstx,8,Fri Jun 26 18:18:50 2015 UTC,you need to change it. Xone is a really popular DJ line and Xone mixers are in clubs all over the world (albeit a lot less popular than pioneer mixers in the US)

If people went to search for dj xone they would get the product line many times before getting to your content. The problem with that is you want your fans and new listeners to be able to find you with ease.

DJs,3b9ww9,BernieArt,3,Sat Jun 27 21:00:52 2015 UTC,"it's basically fidgeting and being a bit anal about the mix.  Most of the changes won't really be perceptible, but some of it might improve the overall mix even if no one really hears it.  Bring down the bass just a little bit might clear up some mudiness, tweaking the gain just a titch might make the mix blend a little better.  Overall, most people wouldn't notice the difference, but mixing can sometimes be about the most minute adjustments that overall will have a implicit effect of the audience experience."
DJs,3b9ww9,dj_soo,1 point,Sat Jun 27 21:36:20 2015 UTC,"Maybe it's because I'm still a beginner, but my experience in clubs has been that the music is loud enough to where most changes are pretty inconsequential to the audience and almost imperceptible to me. I can see if he was in a closed off booth where he has his monitors to hisself, but in open air, is it really that noticeable that the bass and stuff is that off?  It also brings up the question that if he needs to tweak that much, how well was the song mastered in the first place? I can see someone having to do that with one of my songs, cuz I'll be honest and say that I ""mastered"" them myself and have no clue what I'm doing. But, a song coming from a Simi respectable label shouldn't need that kind of adjustment. Or at least it shouldn't need you to mess with it the whole song. That's just my observation as a new guy whose eyes recently opened."
DJs,3b9ww9,BernieArt,2,Sat Jun 27 23:33:45 2015 UTC,"a song on it's own - probably not - a mix, perhaps, but that's debatable.  A lot of the time it's just habit and an unconscious thing that DJs do when they're really into the music.  I highly doubt the people doing this (and a lot of DJs do) are thinking to themselves ""I need to look busy so I'm just going to fake tweaking knobs to pretend I'm doing something to the music.""  More often than not, it's akin to tapping a foot or bouncing your head but just doing it with your hands.    Other times it's simply ""maybe I should turn down the bass just a bit. wait not enough, wait, too much, ok good""  And that's 3 knob motions to do something that not really noticeable, but the intent is still there.  When I see DJs fake-twisting knobs, it's usually a more big, exaggerated motion when they're actually just tweaking a mic knob or something (and I have seen that)."
DJs,3b9ww9,dj_soo,1 point,Sun Jun 28 00:15:37 2015 UTC,great analogy with the head bob/foot tap
DJs,3b9ww9,anderson7,1 point,Sun Jun 28 02:17:20 2015 UTC,"I do that alot, because I can hear the difference. I mix mostly with EQ -- I prep the channel with almost every knob at 8, slam the channel fader up and start blending the tunes together.  Doesn't work with top40/pop though, sudden changes are better when doing that kind of set."

DJs,3b6anm,nlax76,1 point,Fri Jun 26 12:50:24 2015 UTC,"Because when you can't even run it through a channel and 'play' on empty ones, you're probably not even capable of pushing sync. Also, /r/djscirclejerk Also you kinda have to fake it when you're working with a real lighting system. All these festival djs? 99% fake and the other 1% has a ridiculous amount of money to waste and an entire A/V team doing the real work behind the scenes. And pretty soon the lights are gonna be fake too and it's all gonna be run by winamp. #future"
DJs,3b6anm,djfluffl3,2,Fri Jun 26 13:43:13 2015 UTC,you kinda have to fake it when you're working with a real lighting system.    I can't believe people have bought into this propaganda to excuse all the bullshit pre-made sets by shitty producer-turned-Djs.  Of course you don't.  Professional visuals and lighting guys are there for a reason and are able to adjust visuals and lights in realtime in accordance to what's going on during the set.
DJs,3b6anm,dj_soo,2,Fri Jun 26 18:34:27 2015 UTC,Yeah. Lighting tech in a club here. I'm a DJ myself and know enough about dance music song structure that 90% of the time I could fool you into thinking it was pre-planned. Festival setups are obviously more complicated but really it's not that difficult to sync lights to the music. That's why you have a human being operating the lights.
DJs,3b6anm,chuckgravy,2,Fri Jun 26 19:13:45 2015 UTC,"I have a friend who tours with big acts like Pretty Lights doing visuals at festivals and although there may be some specific visuals he is asked to use, very little of it is pre-planned and he'll sit in his booth and manually beatmatch his visuals to the music while they perform.  The whole idea that these big festival sets have to be pre planned to work with the visuals is rather absurd and kind of insulting to the vjs and lighting techs who are able to improvise just as well as good djs...."

DJs,3b6anm,ithinkmynameismoose,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:38:13 2015 UTC,"It's not buying into it, it's true. I have friends that do a lot of lighting work and you might be able to get by with a shitty setup where the lights have rise/fall times and you can strobe some parts to hide the seams, but when you're prepared to talk about precision lighting, such as anything with lasers, it'll either look meh or the laser software itself is what's playing the music.  I hate that people can't accept that that's just how the industry works; it's been decades of stages being far more concerned about appearances than just presenting a good show."
DJs,3b6anm,djfluffl3,1 point,Sat Jun 27 01:56:08 2015 UTC,"Except it's not. I know many lighting and visual techs that do things on the fly for some of the highest end festival settings.  This idea that everything has to be pre planned is simply erroneous.  I have no doubt that some people function that way, but I have been to and played many a high profile festival where I know for a fact the visuals are not pre planned and they look pro as fuck.  The fact that you attribute visuals and lighting on the fly to ""shitty setups"" is a complete insult to the talented and high profile artists doing visuals on the highest level."
DJs,3b6anm,dj_soo,-1,Sat Jun 27 02:44:36 2015 UTC,"So you're gonna just ignore my original comment about spending ludicrous amount of money just for the ability? The idea that a show has to be live is itself an erroneous idea, especially because at the point of technical ability, the DJ gets all the credit for the least talent (from out-of-the-know goers). Seriously, you think the odd realm of light, sound, and electrical physics is so easy to do that any jackoff can do it? There's delays all over the place and the software options for the 'automated' solutions alone are thousands per console, that of course are also thousands each on top of the hundreds/thousands for each light fixture... it's simply absurd to either spend that much money or to risk a technical error fucking up that large of a budget.  Having talked to industry insiders, the vast majority of big shows are confirmed to be pre-planned and no where is that more apparent than the biggest of them."
DJs,3b6anm,djfluffl3,3,Sat Jun 27 03:30:11 2015 UTC,"Again, I have no doubt some shows are completely pre planned but I have spoken to many high level insiders and have been involved with the back end of some large festivals in my area as well.  My point of contention is that you seem to think these large shows have to be completely pre planned which is simply not true.  Risk of technical error?  That's the whole point of performance - to mitigate the risk of error through skill - not automation."
DJs,3b6anm,dj_soo,0,Sat Jun 27 04:37:44 2015 UTC,"Again, I've got a lot of business insiders as well on all the famous festivals and the overall consensus is almost all are pre-planned, usually several months in advance. Everyone involved signs NDAs and the artists are told they can only perform if they pretend. I'd drop specific big names everyone thinks so highly of for being 'true' if it wouldn't literally be risking my friends' careers.  My point of contention is that you seem to think less of a preplanned show when they are vastly more complex and entertaining. Also I've acknowledged several times that they can be live but it just doesn't happen, for a lot of reasons most DJ's don't use live drummers or play keyboards.  Festivals are not performances, they are art exhibits - it requires no less skill or artistic merit to design a festival than it does to pretentiously release some of the controls to a few buttons and press them in series to one another, with the more controls you have to operate manually, the less you can do at one time totally.  If you want a performance piece, go see an orchestra - that's where the natural talent is."
DJs,3b6anm,djfluffl3,1 point,Sat Jun 27 05:30:50 2015 UTC,"There are ways of having pre planned visuals that are still done on the fly, that is, a visual track is pre planned, but may only get used if the DJ drops the track its planned for, I'm not really into the whole AV show thing myself, but I think if you have a look for a video where armin van buren shows how he DJs with it, and how it syncs to his AV guy  link  I imagine there is a way you could extend this to laser shows etc, I'm no expert, but I doubt it'd be difficult to pre-program visuals and then drop them in as and when, not having to rely on something pre planned all the way through"

DJs,3az2ps,djjd805,2,Wed Jun 24 22:35:11 2015 UTC,"I'm an Indian wedding dj in Vancouver and I have got to say, some Indians are complete fucking assholes when they want their songs played.   When I'm mixing and I just got song after song popping in my mind, I tell them I'll mix it in within the next 5-7 songs or next 5-10 minutes(if it's good) and they most of the time are fine with that. If I like the request and know people are gonna love it too, I play it next or after the next track.  Some people just won't leave our stage or space until we play their song and just start arguing. I remember(2 months ago) I was with my brother and some dudes request didn't get played. While he was leaving the party and carrying is daughter, he starts rushing the stage, but only stopped by his wife and me before things got VERY serious.  The gigs where I got into fist fights were when I was just starting out and doing booth gigs.   I'm very polite when I talk to people and never talk down to them, they will understand, shake my hand or not and walk away. Only time I'll raise my voice is when they start getting really into my face and start touching shit.  /endrant"

DJs,3b2vrc,Baskerbosse,3,Thu Jun 25 15:03:45 2015 UTC,"Mp3gain or just use auto gain in your program.  Unless you want to be converting your mp3s to wav which would be silly, I wouldn't try to normalize your MP3s and then convert them back to mp3s as you'll be transcoding and losing quality.  Either that or take the original wavs and normalize, then re-import."
DJs,3b2vrc,dj_soo,1 point,Thu Jun 25 17:58:00 2015 UTC,"I feel like the Traktor auto-gain is a bit 'off'. I can manually set gain but then I still have the issue of the track being low in volume when analyzed, so the track 'image' that you can see scrolling through is just a long line, and the peaks are much harder to spot."

DJs,3b2vrc,H1deki,1 point,Fri Jun 26 07:49:07 2015 UTC,I thought Ableton seemed interesting in doing live mashups and stuff. Way more interesting from a live perspective than FL Studio which I've been playing around with up til now.
DJs,3b2vrc,Methionine,2,Fri Jun 26 08:00:23 2015 UTC,"with ableton's warping interface, the ease of editing audio, and live performance features, it's probably one of the better DAWs out there for straight mashups.  Might want to check out Bitwig too which is essentially an ableton clone designed by some of the original developers of Ableton.  It has some cool features that abelton is missing although it's not quite as robust yet."

DJs,3azdgg,burniemcburn,2,Wed Jun 24 18:58:50 2015 UTC,"You would not believe that a promoter once told me that I was getting paid $30/hour because I only had 100 likes on Facebook (granted I'm new to the whole social media thing and have gotten by well through word-of-mouth), and that I would get paid $50 or more an hour if I had 300-500 likes on Facebook.  That day I honestly did ponder buying Facebook likes. In the end I dropped that promoter and am much better off."

It'll rarely be quite so blatant as that, but your social media presence and how many people you can bring has a huge effect on the likelihood of getting booked. Unless your friends with the promoters, and even then..."
DJs,3azdgg,burniemcburn,1 point,Thu Jun 25 06:01:06 2015 UTC,"It seems like a ridiculous concept to me and it's waaay overblown in Vancouver. We're talking promoters who won't let you play an unpaid opening set for 30-45 minutes unless you sell 'x' tickets.  The problem is that the scene has matured into that way that it's so ingrained into how most events are promoted. I am lucky enough to have networked myself well with DJ friends and have established myself through legitimate bookings rather than having to slosh through unpaid shitty gigs out of the wazoo.  The amount of promoters I've told to fuck off is way too many. As one promoter once told me ""If you're not ok with this there's plenty of other DJs who we can pick up"". Truth is that right now even if I do say no, there's about 5 other mediocre DJs who are looking for their shot to 'make it big'."

Not cause I bought any likes or anything, but because I got hit with the fake like scourge of '13  It's more pointing out how stupid it is to base pay off likes since anyone can have fake likes and you can overpay for someone who is faking their popularity.

Sound-Bar is cool too if you enjoy Trance, they also bring in some good house talent occasionally as well.   Avoid the Mid at all costs unless you enjoy dancing on a 3x3 dance floor that caters to bottle service and the worst crowd in the city."

Not just looking for venues to listen at, but for places to spin that style of music.  It seems that everything downtown is the same shit, either generic house , bigroom and trap, hipster shit, or top 40.  Dear Lord, I NEVER want to go to a hipster music event ever again, one circuit bending show was enough and one show that was supposed to be cool chiptunes and 8bit music but wasn't actually that cool and was too AMV style.  This is the same problem with Indie Dance, great genre with tons of awesome music, but let it be spun by a hipster and it'll probably turn out being more of a vaporwave set than anything.  In my opinion, if you're out gigging and doing a specific style of set that isn't straight up 4X4 danceable, it should at least be some sort of groovy, have something for people to be able to get down to rather than just being hit by a stream of odd amalgams of noise."

DJs,3ay79s,thehookwink,4,Wed Jun 24 16:45:43 2015 UTC,"Check out this blog post. It gives you a really good idea on the current state of club music in Chicago. http://boilerroom.tv/you-cant-stop-the-house/  In my opinion: Smartbar, while a bit elitist at times really holds it down for Chicago house and techno heads. No frills, just dancing in the dark to some amazing music. Legendary doesn't begin to describe it. Check out Queen! (Gay Night) on Sundays for one of, if not the best house party in chicago.   Spybar - an amazing sound system. Brings in a lot of ""new"" talent to the underground house and techno community. They also run paradigm which is an offshoot that does warehouse/loft parties. Spybar can be a bit more bottle-servicey...but they do generally have good lineups and I always have a good time.  Primary, just celebrating their 3rd anniversary tends to sit in between the two. They book a lot of obscure stuff, but you'll also get them bringing in artists like Butch, Shadow Child, Max Graef, Machinedrum, etc etc. Kind of all over the place, but the Void Soundsystem is really nice and I always have a good time.  The Mid - bro club and lolla afters. Think Skrillex, Prydz, etc. Not my favorite, but if you're looking to have a wild night...the 20 something age bracket of girls really like it :)  Soundbar - I personally avoid this place. If you really want my scoop on it, you can DM.  Fun promoters: Tied - Mantas, Max and Ari throw pretty fun minimal techno parties. They are affiliated with spybar and paradigm..but do throw their own events in lofts, etc. Worth checking out on RA.  Naught Bad Fun Collective - This is a WORLD CLASS party crew. Sassmouth is an amazing selector and does really fun techno/house. Their industry brunch party in detroit every year is always super memorable. They are affiliated with smartbar and are known to do loft parties  Them Flavors- Affiliated with Primary but also do loft parties - they tend to book artists like bok bok, night slugs type of stuff, but also shiba san, max greaf, etc etc. Kind of all over the place but they do a really nice job"

DJs,3b02la,doggypuff11,3,Wed Jun 24 21:56:21 2015 UTC,I've found the best way to get into the scene is help out with others parties. I've been helping with a couple promo companies in Chicago. I made an agreement with them to volunteer in return for them getting me gigs. It's been working pretty well and it's great to network with your peers in the industry.
DJs,3b02la,Kennymester,3,Thu Jun 25 02:44:02 2015 UTC,"Look up the DJs playing in the area, find out who represents them, then reach out to those people and find out if they're looking for new talent. Make sure your demo material is current, and relevant to the scene you're trying to break in to. (I.e. Don't send a house/techno/edm mix to someone who is managing top 40/pop/hip hop DJs in bottle service clubs.) Also, appearances and social media presence are almost more important than audio these days. If you don't have original logos/artwork, a significant amount of followers, and professional photos, they probably won't even listen to your demo."
DJs,3b02la,Couch_King,2,Thu Jun 25 07:40:49 2015 UTC,"I know it sounds cliche, however making personal connections are much more likely and appreciated when trying to get into the music scene let alone when doing anything in life."
DJs,3b02la,KrazyTrain18,1 point,Fri Jun 26 00:30:53 2015 UTC,"I live in SF too! The best way that that I got involved is going to loads of parties in SF (there's a solid one every night), making friends with people and talking to them, which embedded me into the community, then eventually people find out that you mix records, and you'll get booked. There are plenty of weeklies (i.e. Housepitality) where many of the promoters, dj's, and agents hang out and shoot the shit.   I also throw a party in the city, and the way we book people is through the network of friends whom we know who are musicians, label owners, synth weirdos. Sometimes it will be off a reputation of release or some crazy live set. So same thing, from a promoter standpoint: I'm more likely to book someone, if I vibe with them, come to the parties and have genuine intrest in the experience being created, and mix. I'll often invite people over who I might want to book, to see how they mix and pick their brain.   As far as agents go, they're mainly intersted in representing established acts that have music out, publicized, and have demand already. They're role in the game is to sell a performance in various markets (i.e. book a national tour). Agents will more times than not approach an artists if they want to work with them, it rarely comes the other way around -- unless they are working with another agency. Cold calls rarely make it to agents (source: interned at a booking agency and I was the filter cold calls).   So I guess what I'm trying to get at is that you just want to go out, be a nice genuine person & make friends. Eventually you'll find out who does what in the city, and shows will come if it's meant to be, but there's no worthwhile shortcuts or emails to coldcall to garner that respect, and trust from the community.   Best of luck :)"

Of course the sound is not comparable to high end headphones, but:   They are VERY durable (seriously, these things are not named ""massive"" for nothing) The bass is pretty strong (depending on your preferred genre this can be a pro or a con) They shut off surrounding sound really good (nice if you are mixing in a loud club) They are flexible (you can twist basically everything in any direction, comfortable when only wearing one shell on your ear while beatmatching) They come with two different cords You can get them for less than 100 bucks   The only downside for me is that the leather is fake, so if you are sweating a lot in your head/neck area, you might not like them."

Absolutely do not go below ~250 kbps, and even then, use these files only as a last resort if you can't find a better quality.   Don't rip audio from youtube.   128 might sound ok on your laptop, but pumped through a big club sound system will sound terrible."
DJs,3awhct,thirteenthirty7,18,Wed Jun 24 03:28:42 2015 UTC,"If you're playing a mobile setup with clean, high-end equipment, you should stick with the best source you can get.  But not everyone is playing on JBL speakers driven by Crown power amps. So maybe you don't have to go that far.   If you're playing through a house system that's been beat the shit out of, the EQ is out of whack from what the original engineer tuned it in to, and maybe they've thrown some compressor/limiter combo in there to keep idiot DJs from completely borking the speakers, these things affect (or ""color"") the output you're going to hear, to the extent that even with super human hearing, by the time it goes through all those amps, and processing, you're not going to be able to tell the difference between a well produced 128k and a 320k.  The mids and highs are just not that accurate in a club system to make a shit of a difference.  Now on the other hand, if you're producing a mix-show, recording it, editing it down, and having it go out on the air of a local (or even nationally syndicated) radio show, you probably want nothing short of 256k.  Why don't I say 320k minimum for radio? Because radio, even nice crisp sounding FM radio maxes out on the high end around 15khz, and with a 50-60db Signal-Noise ratio. Also consider there's HD radio and online streams that come out of these, and they may or may not be subject to the same lossiness of the FM modulated signal. So it's best to keep the broadcast stuff up to snuff.  Source:  Have done club DJ, have produced and mixed radio shows, and have done mobile setups -- with JBL speakers and Crown power amps."

You know, a secret I learned was to give the big amplifiers as much power as you can get. For mobile, that meant locating 4 or 5 dedicated circuits in a venue. 1- subs amp, 2, midrange amp, 3, highs amp plus electronics, and 1 or 2 for lighting.  Most guys don't do this. It makes a huge difference when you can actually lean on your shit and not pop breakers.   Edit:  2 separate circuits for subs if running double / extra subs.  (Eg 4x 18s per side). And:  all audio has to be on the same leg of the feed or you'll get hum. I can discuss how to locate discreet circuits so time if anyone cares for such a thread."

Combining shitty source files with shitty equipment with shitty pa systems results into lets say 0.5x0.5x0.5xQuality. So stick with the best you can find, especially when playing with a low quality setup. I almost solely use lossless  nowadays. It sounds better in all setups, and especially when time stretching heavily."
DJs,3awhct,kirlefteris,2,Wed Jun 24 04:29:06 2015 UTC,especially when time stretching heavily   This needs to be emphasized. Any sort of manipulation of the source is going to enhance any sort of lossy compression applied to the original track. Better just to pony up for lossless and then have perfect quality from now until the end of time.
DJs,3awhct,reductase,3,Thu Jun 25 18:22:22 2015 UTC,"it depends, you could have a 320 kbps mp3, or even a lossless file that doesn't sound good cause it came from a poorly mastered compilation. you gotta listen to every file."

DJs,3awhct,burniemcburn,2,Wed Jun 24 05:10:57 2015 UTC,"Wav's/AIFF. and other lossless file types are nice in theory, but the file size gets insane and the differences between wav and 320 are negligible on the vast majority of systems, and indistinguishable to 95% of listeners. Aim for 320 as standard. I'd gotten by with the occasional 265. Back before I knew about all of this, I had some songs that I could tell were just lower-quality recordings, but I managed to get by passably by boosting the highs, giving the semblance of a sharper sound. Granted, these were mostly on low price PA's and home theater systems, but there are tricks. Stick with 320 in general though."
DJs,3awhct,Thefriendlyfaceplant,-2,Wed Jun 24 05:16:35 2015 UTC,I prefer to stay away from WAV's due to the instability. They are more prone to crash if not played directly on a CDJ. I take the minimal loss in V0 mp3.
DJs,3awhct,reductase,2,Wed Jun 24 11:34:01 2015 UTC,"That must be a problem with your setup, as WAV is the simplest file to play. There is only minimal decoding that must be done as it is completely uncompressed audio unlike FLAC or MP3."
DJs,3awhct,dust4ngel,2,Wed Jun 24 14:28:17 2015 UTC,"it's less CPU I tensive but more I/O throughput on the disk/USB port.  but yeah, if your system can handle streaming uncompressed audio, you are mixing on pretty janky hardware."
DJs,3awhct,reductase,1 point,Wed Jun 24 23:13:49 2015 UTC,"I mean, a 1x CD player from the 80s can stream data at a fast enough rate to handle WAV playback. Sequential reading at 10mb/min is not taxing whatsoever."

DJs,3awhct,dddamnsonnn,1 point,Wed Jun 24 13:53:37 2015 UTC,"I still don't understand. By system do you mean a computer, as in you're playing the wavs off of a controller hooked up to a computer, and the files are stored in a USB or HDD hooked up to the computer?"
DJs,3awhct,Thefriendlyfaceplant,1 point,Wed Jun 24 23:20:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah correct. You play the files on a laptop with an USB controller. The laptop usually is connected to an external soundcard linking it to the venue's audio system.     That's just about the only real advantage to a CDJ (apart from looking really cool), CDJ's don't crash but laptops do if your files get too big to handle.    Playing one large WAV or FLAC file is okay, but once you try mixing them life, or godforbid, have four of them going on at the same time then a lot of ordinary laptops will be prone to shutting down. Memory leaks and such."

DJs,3awhct,burniemcburn,0,Fri Jun 26 15:45:18 2015 UTC,"True, the larger file size means more resources allocated to analyzing and reading the data into ram, so they can get pretty resource heavy."

DJs,3awhct,Santero,2,Wed Jun 24 07:53:02 2015 UTC,"I only buy lossless, and try to get my promos lossless if possible, usually if you email them they will hook you up.   But you know what? Nobody ever stopped dancing because the track was a 128kbps MP3. In truth, most people in most rooms won't even notice the difference.  Obviously, aim high. If I'm paying, I want at least cd quality audio.   But people get so ridiculously anal about this, and I'm not sure it's justified. To give an example from a different time, in the age of vinyl, records would often be crackly as fuck and sound rubbish next to the brand new 180g re-master of something else. But people are dancing to the music, not the audio fidelity of the medium which the music is on.  I doubt I ever play anything less than 320kbps out, and mainly play lossless. But if I somehow found the best song I'd ever heard, perfect for this weekend's sets, and it was a 128/192 or whatever with no way of getting it in better quality, then sure I'd play it."
DJs,3awhct,1001lee,2,Wed Jun 24 11:07:57 2015 UTC,"On the mids and highs maybe, but the lows will just disappear if you mix a 128 into a wav. Trust me on that."

And crucially, those times when it was clearly a crap MP3 being played, nobody stopped dancing.

Of course to the untrained ear you wont be able to tell much of a difference until the next DJ comes on and starts dropping the 320s and all of the sudden its ""what did you do to the speakers? it sounds so much louder"" - Promotor"
DJs,3awhct,1001lee,1 point,Wed Jun 24 10:09:15 2015 UTC,"In my experience, most people say they cannot hear the difference between 320's and wav until you play one after another, then the most common reaction is ""wtf happend, this is so much louder than the previous song"" and such. If you are gonna play wav, play only wav, if you ""have"" to play mp3's, play only mp3, to avoid situations like that."
DJs,3awhct,Thefriendlyfaceplant,1 point,Fri Jun 26 15:52:25 2015 UTC,"V0 is the standard. It's variable below 320kbs but better than constant bitrate of 320kbs.    Below V0 becomes less and less acceptable. Some songs CAN get away with being 128kbs, like really minimal technical stuff. Complex songs really sound like shit on 128kbs.    If you're new it's also important to have a (external) soundcard. You can't plug your laptop directly into the sound system."

DJs,3av5mr,noodleface4,8,Tue Jun 23 20:52:10 2015 UTC,"everyone always brings him up, but that's one guy out of how many thousands of touring DJs out there?  He's an outlier.  The days of becoming a touring DJ based off just DJing is long gone outside of maybe the scratch and hip hop circuit, but most of those guys are also producing.  There will always be exceptions, but it's just not very likely anymore.  The fact that few people can think of anyone other than Ben UFO (or guys who came up in the 90s or early 00s when touring purely as a DJ was still possible) just proves the point that you pretty much have to produce to get big these days and even then, you have to produce something that takes off.  There are thousands of bedroom producers who aren't touring at all."

Some people just get breaks through luck, some people are great at self promotion and networking, and other do it through sheer work ethic and determination.  More likely it's a combination of those and more.  You have to know how to market yourself in one way or another.  Dj talent doesn't get you very far anymore because everything is saturated.  Everyone thinks they're a dj or thinks they can dj.  Everyone is putting up mixes of varying quality and there's nothing all that special about DJing anymore to most casuals.  A lot of your responses sound like the kind of guy who's a little bitter that someone with less ""skills"" is more successful than you are.  It's pointless worrying about what others are doing - espeically if it's causing negativity.  Use that time and energy to improve yourself whether it's practice, self promotion, or learning to produce.  There will always be someone more successful even if you think it isn't deserved.

DJs,3av5mr,iamdjcred,1 point,Wed Jun 24 02:32:58 2015 UTC,"Thanks for asking! I have a cautionary tail on me stopping in 2005. Be careful how long you stay single! You will end up being the 'go to guy' to take care of your aging parents!   I should also point out that 9/11 was like a bomb going off in the US rave scene, such as it was. So was the TIME magazine cover with club kids and the supposed horrors of x. By that point D&B was getting violent and ridiculous. The clubs were full of K and meth and night of the living dead teens. While at the same time, all the indie bands were buying up analog gear and co opting the production techniques as fast as they could. Even had 808 kicks and loops in country songs there for a minute. By then I was playing chillout and downtempo (K&D and Nightmares On Wax etc.) at loft parties and art galleries.   I'm overjoyed that 'sea level' is so high. I hate to admit but I didn't know. I thought festivals still got busted and harassed. I'm so out of the loop now I could use direction concerning the good stuff. Seems like maybe Sander Kleinenberg and Plump DJs was about where I left off.  As far as the future goes. I really want to hear a true mashup masterpiece. I want a kid to take Abelton Live and draw from the collective culture of humanity, in real time, to a good beat, and make a symphonic masterpiece that cuts across race and place and results in a new form of storytelling."
DJs,3av5mr,brkdncr,2,Wed Jun 24 03:03:53 2015 UTC,"Oh man! I'll try and catch you up as best as I can but you might know some of the stuff I'm about to say or you might not care so I'm just gonna drop a disclaimer so I don't come off as snobby/pretentious/ know it all.   IMO there is some solid middle ground between underground and mainstream now. There are small collectives with solid music all over the world, there are very influential indie labels, and everyone and their mom is a producer now a days. I've seen a few people who have been willing to make the time investment go from obscurity to being able to make music a full time job, which is (embarrassingly enough) what I'm trying to do as well.   The chillout scene is thriving with tons of different genres (Tropical House, Deep House, Future Bass, Future Trap, Minimal House/House, Liquid DnB, etc., might not be your cup of tea but it's what I feel is chillout.) People are starting to acquire a taste for stuff that is more musical and distinct in quality (Music from labels such as Roche Music, Future Classic, and artists such as Jamie XX, Flight Facilities, Kaytranada, Sam Gellaitry etc. [very biased picks, as these are some artists/labels that I'm into right now, but this is a raindrop in the ocean of great music that is out there) and you don't absolutely have to make the popular mainstream sound to break out into a tasteful and solid pocket of the industry.  I hear the DnB scene still runs strong in places like ATL. I'm waiting quietly for a full blown mainstream comeback though because DnB is so great, and the mainstream kiddies are getting a taste for faster and more aggressive music. (Hardstyle kicks are starting to bleed into big room/ festival sounds, and have been for a while.)  Free music is also slowly becoming a thing. Climbing artists find that releasing high quality free music is also a great way to get exposure. Twitter and social media in general has allowed artists to connect with the fans in new ways so it brings consumer and producer to new levels.   Festivals have been the new (or maybe not new, but still is) ""cool thing to do"". I'm sitting here working an internship while I'm watching pics of EDC Las Vegas and other festivals pop up on my facebook feed, being attended by people I never would expect to attend/ people who are more in for the fun than the music. It's kind of become an ""Oh that's a music festival? That looks cool I'll go too"" kind of thing. Example: Burning Man is slowly turning into an electronic music event and the purists hate it lol. Fashion culture for these events is thriving as well. I know it has been in the past but with the internet it has opened up access and coverage to a whole new level.   This recap is spotty at best. I'll add to it if I think of anything, but the gist of it is that there is a lot of music now. Said music is also great and accessible, which was a result of that huge mainstream boom which, and I'm paraphrasing from Carl Cox  here, kicked down the doors for electronic music and has allowed people to explore the nooks and crannies of niche genres and for it to flourish like never before.   That last bit: You've heard Madeon's Pop Culture right?   PS: You should definitely pick up where you left off. Chances are that your favorite artists back then are on Soundcloud."

This will be what separates the mainstream and underground DJ's in 2020.  At a minimum a DJ will make a song specifically for a commercial and drop it during sets.  Be paid to drop it during sets.

While there was that Beyonce cell phone song once, even the biggest wigs at the greediest corps realize that ads aren't very ""rock n roll"" so they pay artists to shill hard for their products and fund everything related to them, their lifestyle, and their tours. But actual ads in a song immediately ruins any thought of musicianship. While we all really know better than to think that even our favorite artists don't get extensive production assistance (while actual ghostwriting is limited to certain festival acts, I think the internet has really blurred the line on what each persons role in production is. Mastering guy can now tweak that patch for you as well and so on) we all still like to think that they are always they sole brain power behind a track. Ads in music belays the other, ruining any sense of the artist being anything other than a paid shill, thus less effective"

DJs,3atj3x,xxkirexx,4,Wed Jun 24 01:23:37 2015 UTC,"new dad here.  Still making a living off DJing and producing.  It's hard, and my output has dropped considerably, but one of the best things for me right now is I get to spend so much time with my daughter compared to people working regular jobs.  My work day tends to start after she's in bed so I don't miss out on too much outside of when I'm on the road or have an all-day or all night gig.  I don't have an extensive touring schedule right now tho and I essentially stopped going on the road for the last year, so I'm a little apprehensive about how that will work out when I try to start that up again..."
DJs,3atj3x,dj_soo,2,Tue Jun 23 22:22:43 2015 UTC,"Any tips for a person who hasn't reached that level yet and is still just trying to break out and still has a fulltime day job? What are some things you should be focusing on to reach the next level? I can't get out all that much to support other DJs or promoter's events and network the way i'd like to. I support via social media as much as i can though, and try to get and stay in touch with people whenever possible."
DJs,3atj3x,dj_soo,2,Wed Jun 24 11:15:00 2015 UTC,"Sometimes i get very discouraged. I feel like i may have missed my window of opportunity and that there's no place for people like me, in my position within the scene. I just can't play to empty rooms/bars where no one cares about the music or that there's even a dj and the mobile dj thing isn't really for me. But sometimes i feel like that's as far as i'll be able to go given my situation."
DJs,3atj3x,Whitestep,2,Wed Jun 24 11:18:27 2015 UTC,"Yea, I do too.  I'm not getting younger and I've seen my career eclipsed by my colleagues over the years.  Some of my friends are currently touring the world and making waves in their scenes and even though I've been at it longer, I'm still playing weddings, mobiles, and boring residencies to make ends meet.  But they're still single and don't have anyone that really depends on them while I have obligations to my daughter and my wife, mortgages, debts, etc.  Really it comes down to time management and dedication - both to being a father and your craft.  Ultimately, you have to make the time to do it, and with 3 kids and a job, it sounds like a lot of work, but it's not really impossible.  I have friends who are juggling the kids, job, and music and they still find the time to make music, dj, and tour albeit not as extensively as others.  You basically need to sit down with your family and work out a real schedule and stick to it. Pick a day or two a week where it's music day and focus on your music be it DJing, production, promotion, etc.  I find having a studio outside of your home helps a lot.  Take the little moments at home to do some work when you can (say naptime) and just really stay focused during those lulls.    Unfortunately, a lot of DJing these days is networking - going out and supporting other nights and getting face time with people in your scenes.  Which is difficult when you have a family that depends on you and you can't be out all hours of the night.  I can do it because I don't have to go to work the next day, but I honestly only go out on days that I have earlier gigs and pop by after and even then, I only show up for a half hour and head home.  I'm not even going to pretend I know what it would be like with 3 kids (especially a set of twins!), but I've seen it done and it's possible.  That said, I have also seen many marriages fall apart among my dj friends who are touring and doing well in their careers so there is that.  Music is a passion and you can be caught up in it, but remember to put your family first..."

DJs,3awljo,robkabob,1 point,Wed Jun 24 03:16:56 2015 UTC,"My approach to DJ laptops is that they're for business. I don't put other things on them. As such, I prefer refurbs.  I picked up a pair of Toshiba Tecra 840's that were lease returns. Put in 120 gig SSD's and maxed out the RAM. All told I spent about $950 CDN on the pair and all the upgrades. They both have identical images on them, so I can reset them if I have to. All they have installed is Traktor Pro, Chamsys MagicQ, VLC, Acrobat, iTunes and Chrome. They've been absolutely bomb proof."

It should all arrive on Friday and I'll let you know how it goes.   A second question though, for doing small gigs such as grad parties for friends or house parties for friends. Is it acceptable to use an old Mixtrack 1 that my friend gave me? Or do I need to invest in a cheap controller such as the Pioneer DDJ-SB or Behringer CMD Studio 4a? Thanks!"
DJs,3ave1m,Hair_Farmer,3,Tue Jun 23 20:28:59 2015 UTC,Yeah this is correct to my knowledge.   To load tracks from rekordbox on your computer you have to be connected through Ethernet. And since you can't daisy chain Ethernet on the CDJs (there's only one port) you need a simple network switch to connect to your computer. This works on my 900nxs -- and it should on your player as well. Drag and drop tracks using the rekordbox app on your computer or browse on the device.
DJs,3ave1m,chuckgravy,2,Wed Jun 24 19:12:10 2015 UTC,"This Guy is correct.  You need to use a switch! After that, your whole library should be reachable through link.  Mind that you won't see the waveforms on your computer as you would with serato. In this case, rekordbox will basically have the same functionality as itunes ;-) (You will see them on your cdj's though)"

DJs,3atozs,thatguynamedguy,2,Tue Jun 23 17:22:50 2015 UTC,"Try stretching before and after a sesh. Try yoga. Try swimming. Try a professional massage. As far as specific stretches, slowly rolling your neck, SLOWLY, around your shoulders both directions probably can help with neck pain. Sun salutations, updog, down dog, cobra and such will probably help with posture and other stiffness. Feel free to hit me up if you have any questions."
DJs,3atozs,superfuels,1 point,Tue Jun 23 14:36:22 2015 UTC,"I have been doing the neck rolling recently, it does help somewhat but more just delaying the onset of inevitable neck stiffness. Ill try doing more stretches beforehand as well, maybe go for a little jog haha."
DJs,3at3dr,playuhh,4,Tue Jun 23 08:02:06 2015 UTC,"Yep, should do it. We had a little open air party last saturday and the generator was about 15m away from the 'dancefloor'. Music was probably a bit louder than it will be in your case, but you have a lot more room."
DJs,3at3dr,GemeinesGnu,2,Tue Jun 23 08:30:12 2015 UTC,"Probably works. Make sure to have disconnected all equipment when powering up the generator, some can produce a peak when starting that could potentially damage your equipment.  Plus, modern generators are actually pretty quiet."
DJs,3at3dr,mymomisyourfather,2,Tue Jun 23 12:40:23 2015 UTC,"Having thrown many outdoor parties, I suggest building a sound baffle  (a 4 sided box with no lid) to muffle the sound. Grab 4 pieces of plywood and screw hinges to three of them so you have a side that's unconnected and can easily be moved around. 200ft distance from your set up should be fine.  You'll need to leave the top open so air can flow. Also, make sure you keep a foot or so of space between the box and the generator (especially the side where the vent lies).  This should give you an idea of what I'm referring to: http://www.accesswave.ca/~ve1adh/HPIM0441.JPG. Have fun and be safe!"
DJs,3at3dr,iambillybaroo,1 point,Tue Jun 23 14:35:11 2015 UTC,"In pinch, you can use a 6' folding table turned on its side. That's usually what I do when we have outdoor events. That way, no exhaust gets trapped, but the surface of the table blocks most of the sound of the generator operating. I usually place the genny about 100'-150'  away from where the music will be."
DJs,3at3dr,Prancemaster,2,Tue Jun 23 15:10:08 2015 UTC,yea you should be fine.   a 3000w generator shouldn't make that much noise anyways
DJs,3at3dr,Gmonie5,1 point,Tue Jun 23 20:32:39 2015 UTC,"It really depends on the generator's engine.  Hondas and Suzukis are pretty quiet; Tecumseh's are loud as fuck.  The rest fall somewhere in between.  Note that this is the brand of the engine not of the generator as a whole (e.g. a Generac generator may use a Tecumseh or a Honda, depending on model)."
DJs,3aun7s,TSP123,2,Tue Jun 23 17:22:01 2015 UTC,"I think you need to provide alot more information what you want.

Once you are willing to provide that info it would be alot easier."

Whereas..if you framed it another way, like promoting my DJ name at your workout club or embedding my soundcloud on your website or something like that, I may be compelled to do it."
DJs,3aun7s,nowhdaking,0,Tue Jun 23 18:28:51 2015 UTC,"I am open for all suggestions guys.. You let me know what you want for a mix. I was under the assumption that a lot of the DJ's would already have mixes made and would just send me something they've already completed.. so $25 or $50 would have been just extra cheese.   Let me know whats fair and reasonable. This is for a friend who is a spin instructor. Their instructors are currently using their iphones and spotify. They litterally build playlists and skip from track to track.. I wanted someone to simply build in the transitions. If they got creative with it, that was a bonus."
DJs,3aun7s,nowhdaking,1 point,Tue Jun 23 18:31:55 2015 UTC,"I have a bunch of mixes already made, as I'm sure many people do on this sub. But your post is very prescriptive about what songs the mix needs to include and how many bars of drops and intermissions you need.   It's an interesting job and I'm not saying you won't find someone to do it, but it would probably take at LEAST 2 hours to complete to your specifications when you consider both planning and recording the mix. Consider that $50-$100/hr is about the lowest you can hire a professional DJ for and you understand why the $25 figure feels low right?   If it was just me sending you an hour long mix that I already have made (which is fantastic for working out, I hear from many people), then that's a much more attractive proposition."

DJs,3aun7s,nowhdaking,0,Tue Jun 23 18:45:07 2015 UTC,Yeah but when you say 25 I already know you won't be willing to pay anyway near what true value is. If you had started at like 75 and said room for negotiation then people wouldn't scoff as much.

Everything under Electronic Dance Music is what most DJ's will work with, and it's range is from happy hardcore to minimal navelgazeware.  Yes, there are different sounds and structures but to try to fit all those different sounds into their own categories that everyone agrees upon is going to be impossible, so why try?  It's also a little insulting to an artist to say ""your stuff sounds like this other stuff.""  I also have begun hating the new definitions of old music.  For instance, there is no ""trap"" music, that's just hip-hop with no MC and somewhere in the middle the break consists of emptyness then loud synth bass notes."

DJs,3ap2r8,roadtorichards,3,Mon Jun 22 14:41:28 2015 UTC,It's actually better practice to reduce the gains of the other EQ bands than boost anything. Same effect

DJs,3ap2r8,Wetenhall,0,Tue Jun 23 06:15:56 2015 UTC,"It is actually more effective to increase overall volume instead of pushing it on one EQ, in my opinion. Leave headroom on your board to be able to do this, as well as to be able to add gain for tracks that aren't normalized to the same volume level as others. You should not have to ""push the bass"" for a drop, the bass will already be hard, so if you absolutely want that extra force, push the whole volume. If you don't think it's loud enough after setting up that extra volume space when you're doing a soundcheck, have the volume pushed up by manipulating the soundboard/amp instead, with the sound guy, and within reason (he will have to test what his raised volume + your max output is to make sure he's not pushing it).  When working with hard, distorted basses, it's easy to over-eq that low end if you are trying to use eq only for emphasis, to where you can't always audibly tell the difference (but a different area of the room may be better able to hear it). I find that even volume-raising is more of a self-placebo, and if the volumes are set right at the start of the night, you shouldn't have to boost anything at all other than gain on quiet tracks that need it. Most songs will actually get louder when they ""should"", so instead of turning up the actual output volume on a drop, turn up your cue/monitor volume instead...you'll get the same feeling, and the crowd will likely not notice the difference as the music is loud as hell to them anyway.  Remember, the volume you hear from the floor is not the volume they hear...if the system is tuned to be loud as hell to the patrons, you turning it up is not making any distinct or wanted emphasis. 99.99% of the time just leave the volumes to the sound guy and use subtractive EQing only.  (note: the above is MY opinion and style, others will feel differently, but this has been successful for me.)"
DJs,3ap2r8,--LAZER--,2,Mon Jun 22 14:52:57 2015 UTC,"What I tend to do to add that ""force"" over a drop with bass is that I gradually reduce the bass EQ and then push it back on and a bit over as the drop goes.  As I'm a small DJ I always did DJ + Sound guy with my own amps and speakers, and I'm leaving a headroom of 3-4 dB for the compressors to do their work, like I'd do mastering on my tracks.  Raising the volume won't do much to me because it is already normalized by the mastering chain, however I found that playing with the bass levels was more efficient to give that extra ""force"" on the drop.  To each their own styles I guess. (Note: I have a small budget as a student so I only have my computer to do the mastering before sending it to the amp, so everything is done by software. That works great so far)"

DJs,3ap2r8,ebbsc,5,Mon Jun 22 17:15:10 2015 UTC,"I agree that keeping it the green is good practice, however  the modern Pioneer mixers are digital mixers, as a sound engineer you should know that that means that it will only start to 'clip' at 0dBfs.  Way different than 0dB. As you mentioned, the 0dB on a Pioneer DJM 900 master level meter is actually at -18dBfs, leaving you with 18dBs of headroom. that 0dBfs is an absolute maximum, it cannot go higher. But anything under it is fine.  This means that you can absolutely and safely run it full on in the red. Just try to make a DJM 900 'clip' its pretty much impossible"
DJs,3ap2r8,brkdncr,1 point,Tue Jun 23 06:25:23 2015 UTC,Hmm. I'll have to do some more digging into this. Why is then I've had some DJs redline the piss out the mixer and it sounds like shit?
DJs,3ap2r8,ebbsc,2,Tue Jun 23 09:51:04 2015 UTC,"I specifically mention the DJM 900. Do the same on a DJM 800 and it'll sound like shit. Or you use low quality source music (youtube rips? wouldn't be a first). Or the acoustics are shit.  Or the famous 'bump up the 4khz so it sounds louder' trick, which obviously makes it sound like shite.   Numerous reason thus. But redlining a modern digital DJ mixer does not result in shit sound."
DJs,3ap2r8,MikeElliot,1 point,Tue Jun 23 10:40:27 2015 UTC,"but it must. because I've done sound for hundreds of big name DJs using djm900. I don't think these larger artists are bringing youtube rips of their own songs. and I've watched their EQs seem to be fine. but a few have definitely had distorted sounding sets.  are you sure each individual channel before it hits the gain goes to 0dbfs? or does the A>D conversion happen after? Because if what you're saying is true, then I can essentially put a loudly mastered track into the mixer, turn the gain up 100%, turn each EQ knob 100% and turn the master 100% and it will not distort"

To those of us who understand sound design, and even the most basic concept of gain stages, yes, it makes them look like an amateur.  However, we are far and away the minority, and as you said yourself, a huge number of the pros redline the mixer.    In effect, redlining the mixer does make you look like the pros, so DJs emulate what they see and pass that along to other DJs.  I can't count the number of times I've heard the mixer (Pioneers, specifically) having the headroom to handle it, and every time I have to sit down with them and walk them through what you just explained.

The sound was distorted but however no one complained and i was like wtf why is even the sound so distorted. But when i went and saw i took a picture and said that red levels are not good they produce distorted sound and also are not good for the speakers but he was like the party people want it loud and also he doesn't care about red levels all he wants is the loud sound coming from the speakers i couldn't complain!

DJs,3ap2r8,fcisler,1 point,Mon Jun 22 18:12:36 2015 UTC,"Alright so I have a question for anyone that I've never been sure about. I'm clear on keeping out of the red on my NS6 and always make sure to do so. But I am always confused about the process of what gains should be turned up first... so can someone walk all the way down the line from speaker volume to gains on the NS6? My main confusion is where the master gain on my laptop screen at the top right of serato should be. I've never quite understood what that affects. So, where should my channel gains, master controller gain, serato onscreen master gain, and speaker volumes be (or which ones should I be turning up first when I want more volume without distortion)?"
DJs,3ap2r8,EllisDelta,2,Mon Jun 22 19:13:18 2015 UTC,"My rule of thumb is to step the volume down at each point of amplification going back from the speakers. Basically, you don't want any signal source to be louder than the next stage, so you wouldn't want your controllers master at full with the speakers at 25%, for example. If anything, have the speakers set to be the loudest thing in your signal chain, and go back from there. Once you've set up your speakers, turn the master on you Numark down completely, play a track at the full volume you're going to be running during your event (channel gain at 50% and the volume fader up all the way). Then slowly turn your master volume up to either the appropriate level for the gig, or until it starts brushing the red, whichever comes first. If it then still needs to be louder for some reason, don't turn the master up any more, but go back to the speakers and start turning them up. That's my general workflow for getting my gain staging sorted cleanly."
DJs,3ap2r8,fcisler,1 point,Tue Jun 23 04:39:18 2015 UTC,"Excellent, thank you! This is exactly the type of explanation I was looking for."
DJs,3ap2r8,fcisler,1 point,Tue Jun 23 09:24:14 2015 UTC,"Happy to help! Let me know if you have any other questions.   Another way I'd word it is that distortion is most typically caused by one gain stage being louder than the next point in the signal chain. While there's plenty of headroom built into devices and software, it's just safer to go from an even volume level and boost it later down the signal line. There are certainly exceptions I'm sure, based on equipment and such, but driving a quiet speaker with a super loud master channel is a surefire way to make the final signal sound terrible, if not actually damage the speakers themselves."
DJs,3ap2r8,djbeefburger,1 point,Tue Jun 23 09:31:37 2015 UTC,"You can turn all of them up as long as they don't go into red. At that point you are close to, or are distorting the signal"

If the DJs are playing over-saturated, over-compressed, distorted music to begin with, they probably like the way it sounds when it's crushed even further, and most carnival/festival/whatever crowds don't notice or can't tell the difference, anyway.  It's like playing an old punk rock recording through blown speakers - does it really sound worse - or is it just more cranked and no less shitty than the original?"

It can be extremely stressful at times.

But of course, there are many many factors that play into a smooth transition beyond just the general key, might be alterations to the bassline/ melody which give the key a different modal relationship. What I find most irritating is when I find 2 solid tracks in the same key and similar BPM's and the drum grooves are just very messy when the tracks overlap."

DJs,3alozt,CoffeeAddict64,1 point,Tue Jun 23 03:12:42 2015 UTC,Why are these threads always full of MiK referrals?   I thought a large percentage of people here were using Traktor  ...  which detects key and allows you to sort your collection accordingly.
DJs,3alozt,Dubliminal,1 point,Tue Jun 23 08:34:24 2015 UTC,Vdj comes with the library already sorted like this as well.
DJs,3alozt,FNKTN,1 point,Wed Jun 24 00:59:08 2015 UTC,"I would stray away from software and trust your ears. Software analyzes things too literally and doesn't take into account the actual movement of the track, you'll find yourself going through a lot of tracks supposedly ""in key"" that don't work because the beats are different, Start trusting your vibe and instinct and the right key/beats will find there way to you"
DJs,3alozt,Wapiti-Wisdom,1 point,Sun Jun 21 19:40:15 2015 UTC,"No, if the harmonics clash then either the software missed the key or you're mixing 2 modes that don't translate well. This is why I use Rapid Evolution instead of Mixed in Key - you get a lot more specific information than '12a 130bpm'  Software won't replace your sense of rhythm if you're mixing cross-genres and a lot of the time, one keyed track will work better than another because of timbre, but seriously, at least look at the f'in software!"

There are a couple halls in my city for 50 or so people that are essentially converted hotel suites. Works great in there. Also good for wedding ceremonies and receptions where they may have a guitarist or harpist playing.  They're not cheap but they do work well in certain applications.

A par can is something like this that shines a wash of different colored light. It can be one color all the time or change colors with the music (via a built in microphone). An incandescent version of the par can is the older one that uses light bulbs, so they're very hazy (like in 80s music videos) compared to the sharpness of  modern LED lights."

Gel them to be Red Green Blue Amber and focus them to cover the dance floor individually, not just one area. Black is your favourite color here so spread them out.   Here are a few form factors that were popular though they are now LEDs and a little different. The spirit is there though. If you want truly classic ones look for used one in these form factors with halogen bulbs, but be forewarned they will drink up the amps on your circuits so plan ahead and request addition dedicated circuits and very often the halogen models come with duty cycles so you can't leave them one all night or they will over heat and melt internal circuitry. LED's can stay on all night. Also, get a disco ball and few pin spots. Should be about $100 - $200 Have fun! :)  Derby  Roto Ball  Helicopter"

BTW, my friends and I once bought seven hot air, oil less popcorn poppers that were popular in the 80's and turned them all on to cover the dance floor in popcorn.

DJs,3ahbzn,djfluffl3,1 point,Sat Jun 20 14:43:30 2015 UTC,"All of them are loose? I'd suspect whatever they're attached to is what's loose; if you don't have a warranty or anything and have some caution (to not rip out wires etc) then I'd open it up and see what can be tightened. If the pots themselves are bad, read the part number and look online for a bag of them; identical specs can be interchanged. Take some pictures as you remove pieces just to be sure you can put it back together.  But what I'd suggest is having 2 controllers - I keep a Numark Total Control specifically for screwing around/practicing/planning sets/etc, I bought it for $40 and it's been well worth it. I only use my main decks for live/recording or when I have to practice 4 decks."

If I'm in a professional enviornment with a monitor system then it's one earcup to beatmatch (whichever works best with the monitor placement) and two, if needed, for the EQ and mixing.  But it really does matter where the monitors are. If there are no monitors then I am using both earcups almost the entire set because there's no other way to really hear what the crowd hears."

The albums found high popularity with hip hop producers, with the release of a new volume in the series usually leading to many various hip hop records featuring samples of the breaks.  Re-releases of the LPs, some packaged in pairs for DJ scratching and mixing convenience, became available and are currently found in many record stores. CDs of some of the volumes may be found as well, including a 2-CD and DVD box set featuring nearly all the tracks on the 25 albums.

DJs,3abzli,General_Exception,6,Thu Jun 18 23:19:03 2015 UTC,I would be worried about latency in a setup like that.
DJs,3abzli,they_call_me_dewey,1 point,Fri Jun 19 01:16:30 2015 UTC,"If everyone is using the same app, from the same wifi, they would all in theory get the same latency so it shouldn't really matter as long as the DJ's monitors are from before the broadcast."
DJs,3abzli,me-tan,2,Fri Jun 19 06:20:57 2015 UTC,I wouldn't assume that.  Different device specs will yield different latencies due to different buffering.
DJs,3abzli,Phreakiture,2,Fri Jun 19 10:04:09 2015 UTC,True. Perhaps give everyone the same wifi enabled android MP3 player with the same app on. They have to be given back when the punters go out.
DJs,3abzli,me-tan,2,Fri Jun 19 10:12:23 2015 UTC,"That might do it.  The trick, to my thinking, is to make sure that whatever you hand out ends up coming back -- it needs to be unusable once they leave the venue."
DJs,3abzli,Phreakiture,2,Fri Jun 19 12:53:10 2015 UTC,I would ensure that they come back by requiring a deposit that they get back when they return the phones.
DJs,3abzli,me-tan,1 point,Fri Jun 19 17:54:59 2015 UTC,"Indeed. Hey you could probably do it with Raspberry Pis, or those stick of gum sized mini computers that were on kickstarter a while back"

DJs,3abzli,BentonLewis,3,Fri Jun 19 00:31:41 2015 UTC,Mixify is good too.  You can adjust the latency.  I used to use it for college gigs.
DJs,3abzli,iScopedThePope,2,Fri Jun 19 01:43:56 2015 UTC,"MixIr can be streamed to as far as I know, might be a bit tedious but it'd work."
DJs,3abzli,me-tan,2,Fri Jun 19 01:04:03 2015 UTC,Pretty much all Internet radio apps are examples. ServeStream on Android and HiDef Radio on iOS are the ones I use.
DJs,3abzli,memo001,2,Fri Jun 19 06:17:43 2015 UTC,"SuperStereo is a good one. It automatically syncs the streams so the latency is minimal, say 10ms. Supports local network play and world streaming."
DJs,3abzli,khantzaey,2,Fri Jun 19 09:38:37 2015 UTC,"Even if the latency was the same for the audience, as a DJ you will be waiting seconds (which is a life time) for a drop to hit the crowd that you've already heard...    FM would be a good choice but you would have to look at licensing laws in your country."
DJs,3abzli,fatdjsin,1 point,Fri Jun 19 09:17:10 2015 UTC,yeah go fm ... so much easier... and no bandwidth problem (wich is sure to occur if you have a medium crowd or bigger
DJs,3abzli,fcisler,4,Sat Jun 20 16:24:46 2015 UTC,What you want might exist....but not anywhere near that price point. Look at in ear monitors. They are $250+ a receiver.   Your best bet is going to be FM. You can use low power transmitters and source a bunch of small fm radios.
DJs,3abzli,Phreakiture,2,Thu Jun 18 23:49:48 2015 UTC,"The biggest problem you will encounter here is going to be finding an empty channel to use.  I would recommend staying at 91.5 or above (in the US anyway) because there is a crush of lower-powered stations below that point on the dial, and someone nearby may be trying to listen to one of them.  It's doable, just do your homework on frequency choice."
DJs,3abzli,fcisler,2,Fri Jun 19 10:07:10 2015 UTC,"Assuming your using anything more powerful then a portable unit to transmit to your car radio, you need to contact the FCC for a broadcast license. They will assign you a frequency."
DJs,3abzli,Phreakiture,2,Fri Jun 19 12:49:43 2015 UTC,"Are they willing to do that for one-off things like this?  I don't know; I've never tried to ask them for this sort of thing.  The theoretical range of a legal-power no-license transmitter is actually better than you would expect, as long as you have decent receivers.  That's the tricky part."
DJs,3abzli,fcisler,1 point,Fri Jun 19 12:57:03 2015 UTC,Yes. I rented a unit once to cover an event of about an acre. They were very helpful in coordinating the frequency and making sure I was within the law
DJs,3abzli,Phreakiture,2,Fri Jun 19 16:29:35 2015 UTC,That sounds like exactly what the OP needs.    Hey /u/crasch4 check this solution out!

DJs,3abzli,sgamer,1 point,Thu Jun 18 22:06:53 2015 UTC,Still a 3 second delay though :(
DJs,3abzli,Phreakiture,3,Fri Jun 19 09:22:10 2015 UTC,"I would have to think that FM would be the cheapest, other than the transmitter (potentially):   Scales far beyond what you would need Receivers are dirt cheap (You could give out FM radio headsets with every ticket and still make money) No issues with bandwidth, user connectivity (who's got service in the crowd? everybody?), etc, just give everybody a pre-tuned headset and jam out, with some extra batteries lying around   The drawbacks are how much transmit power you'd actually need (calculate this based on venue area size), especially to sound GOOD, and the cost of that power. But, having a low-power FM transmitter is much cooler than just a silent disco...  Otherwise, broadcast it to the net via a shoutcast/icecast relay and let people use their phone to tune in. Assuming everyone has good service in the venue, with a connection that isn't dropping the feed, that would be OK, but everyone would be hearing it with a bit more delay between each others' plays than through the FM system, imho."
DJs,3abzli,sgamer,2,Fri Jun 19 06:57:34 2015 UTC,The cost of the power for the transmitter should be negligible.  Anything that doesn't require an FCC license is going to be using less than a watt.
DJs,3abzli,Phreakiture,2,Fri Jun 19 10:08:48 2015 UTC,"I'm not speaking to the cost of the power, but to the cost of the transmitter itself. A small one like those used in toy microphones for kids might be cheap, but the range is tiny. I know you can build your own for a fairly inexpensive cost, but buying one made for more than talking through a radio across a room could be pricier. I don't know the real price of these things, however. IIRC from when I was researching lowpower FM solutions would be anywhere from $200-1200 depending on output power."
DJs,3abzli,khantzaey,2,Fri Jun 19 10:25:20 2015 UTC,"Oh, I got what your saying.  My bad.    Yes, a good transmitter could be costly, maybe.  I don't know.  I have only ever built one from a kit, and that was a long time ago.  The same company (Ramsey Electronics) still makes kits -- $270 will get you a nice one with a built-in compressor if you don't mind spending some quality time with a soldering iron.  If you're not skilled that way, then I'm not sure what's out there."
DJs,3abzli,Phreakiture,3,Fri Jun 19 12:51:47 2015 UTC,"I would take an RCA out from the DJ mixer (rec or tape out to prevent clipping - on some mixers this won't allow the microphone to be used)  I'd then get hold of a cheap FM transmitter such as this but be aware of your local laws.    Headphones Any wireless FM headphones from amazon or eBay that work within 88 - 108FM. eg:  These    Just set all the headphones to the correct FM (go for the lowest FM frequency available so if users change theirs by accident, they only have to push their select wheel all the way back down).  You could even put tape over the selector.    This will mean there will be 0 latency.  So you could actually run other speakers at the same time so your DJs are able to interact live with your crowd."
DJs,3abzli,marymelodic,1 point,Fri Jun 19 09:29:31 2015 UTC,"go for the lowest FM frequency available    Be careful below 91.5.  In the US, there will be a lot of lower-powered stations below there.  If someone is trying to listen to that and hears your music instead, it may yield a complaint to the authorities.  Even if your transmitter is legal power, your right to use it ends when it causes interference."
DJs,3abzli,drr777,2,Fri Jun 19 10:11:38 2015 UTC,I've done it before a few times with pre-recorded mixes. Everybody just presses play at the same time.  Agreed with /u/General_Exception that it seems easier to use an existing online broadcasting platform than to try to build dedicated radio broadcasting/receiving hardware.
DJs,3abzli,memo001,2,Fri Jun 19 01:31:59 2015 UTC,Have no input on anything current. The first Silent Rave I went to was done over a low level FM transmitter and was theorized/organized on a rave listserv by Captain Crunch  It was a really good time actually.
DJs,3abzli,pigferret,2,Fri Jun 19 02:30:07 2015 UTC,"If you don't want any delay, SuperStereo might be good one. Automatically syncs the stream for minimal latency.   I think this is the app store link https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/superstereo/id821744176?mt=8"

The headsets we wore had three different channels and 3 djs spinning three different genres. The main channel was able to use subs so you could feel the bass.  It was great not having to yell at the bartender to get a beer, and was great being able to have a quick conversation before putting the headsets back on.   It's a niche thing, but not pointless.

EDIT: even if you're worried other DJs will ""steal your style"" (whatever that means) by IDing all your tracks and then playing them in their own sets, if the music is unreleased, most people will have a really hard time obtaining it. And besides, I don't know who you really are, but I doubt you're at a level where other DJs will even want to ""steal your style"". Even if someone IDs and somehow obtains all your tracks, by that time you've probably stopped playing those ""stolen"" tracks and you're playing a completely new set. I really don't see any reason to be selfish and not reveal the tracks you're playing. You say it's unreleased stuff - it was probably given to you for a reason, and that is to promote it. That is actually a fairly big part of a DJ's job - to promote music.   EDIT2: you say you're doing if for the love (of music, I presume). One of the joys of music is also to share it with people around you. I think it's utterly narrow-minded to keep it all to yourself, and can't see any real love for music in that case."

They are, believe it or not, perfectly happy with the way they are, and with the plays they get. Most of this tracks are white labeled, I hope you know what that means, and to be completely honest, even I do not know the name of some of those tracks and even producers, because I got them hand to hand or such. Not all types of electronic music (I am talking electronic music, I say again) go along with the need to be listened to from millions of people. Most of tracks I play and like have around 300-500 views on youtube. Some of those tracks actually made it ""big""(or should I say bigger) with time, but usually that took more than a year or so from the time I played them, most commonly as reissues included on some compilations, rarely as singles.   You may say, if it only has 500 views it sucks, and I will not disagree with you, because my point was not talking down on anyone or any style of music, I was just stating that exclusivity of tracks makes a difference between me (and djs alike) and the so called Beatport top100 djs. Being original is what counts, because with the gear today any douchebag can make a semi-decent mix, but any douchebag wont spend 8-10 hours per day just diggin and diggin for music in the most obscure fucking shitholes you can imagine on the internet.  If you want a more clear example of what I am saying, you can even go check out some of the more ""commercial"" djs, that have a wide audience and are famous worldwide, and rarely make under 10k € per gig, let's say Seth Troxler (I actually like him and respect him, maybe not that much for the music he plays, but for his persona, and his not giving a fuck attitude). Now, go find his newer mixes, and check the tracklists please. You will not be able to ID at least 60% of it(at least for the next 6-7 months), and he plays all the major festivals, has his own stages at those festivals etc etc. Why do you think that is so? And do you think that he does not want to support the people whose music he plays? It is not about the money bro, it is, and always will be about music.  Bedroom producers, and even some producers that actually sell more copies of their tracks don't make too much money. But when they hear and see their track getting played at a party, and the crowd goes mental, into a different state of existence, the so called bliss, then they get their paycheck man, and that is all that counts. And trust me on this, no matter how materialistic and brutal the world seems today, PLUR still exists, not so much on super-festival level, but on smaller more private events level.  Don't take me wrong, I support anyone who follows his dreams, does what he likes, and stands behind what he is doing. This is just my view of things, the view I built from countless parties I attended, played and even organized to some extent. Respect, I'm out."
DJs,3aagv1,1001lee,1 point,Fri Jul 3 15:42:52 2015 UTC,"So you're saying that none of the producers whose music you play never ever want to get recognized for what they do ever? And that they're perfectly happy that only a DJ with 7 followers on SoundCloud is playing their tracks? And that if a big-name DJ (or label owner) approached them, they'd say ""no, thanks""? I find that impossible to believe.   What if a big name DJ or label owner approached you and inquired about some of the tracks you played? You'd send him away? This is all completely backwards.  But I guess everyone is entitled to a way of doing things. I'm of the opinion that DJing is about promoting the artists you play, you are of the opinion that the artists are unimportant and that their music only serves to promote you. In my opinion, that is a very selfish and self-centered point of view, but to each their own.  The number of views has nothing to do with the quality of a track, and the amount of recognition it might deserve. I'm also of the opinion that many of the tracks I like and play deserve much higher views. It's great music and it deserves to be heard.  About Seth Troxler, do you honestly believe that the only thing that separates him from other DJs is that he guards his tracklists? He's not a really good DJ if he feels he has to do that. I'm thinking it's probably more because most of the mixes you hear are live recordings, recorded by who knows who, and maybe even without the consent of the artist. All of his studio mixes have tracklists. Also, he even posts his charts on various sites (Beatport among others), so it's not like he's totally unwilling to share his tracklists.  While we're on the subject, whatever you might think of Richie Hawtin nowadays (and deservedly so; he's a mockery of his former self), but he never felt the need to guard his tracklists - he even posted the track he was playing as he was playing it on Twitter. Explain to me how did this negatively affect him in any way?  As for the bedroom producers, do you honestly think that all of them don't want recognition of any kind? I agree it's a great feeling to be on the dancefloor, to hear your track really loud and to see people grooving to it, but if someone offered me to sign that track, I'd do it in a heartbeat. I honestly don't know of any producer who wouldn't. The R in PLUR is respect, I don't feel that you respect the artists whose music you play and whose music actually allows you do to your thing.  And again, explain to me the harm of sharing your tracklists if most of which is unreleased stuff? Explain to me how will I obtain those tracks if, as you said, the music is unreleased?"

Soundcloud has copyright filters wihch are a bitch but it has the best technical platform in terms of the app/desktop/responsiveness and a bigger audience than mixcloud. Youtube has the biggest audience but on mobile it can't run minimized and you can't just upload an audio file so it has an additional step to upload (which probably isn't a huge deal for a tech-savvy DJ)."

If I know the first couple tracks I want to play, I can focus fully on what people are feeling and plan from there.  If it's an unfamiliar crowd, I take a similar approach to a mix -- come in at a high energy level (appropriate to the time slot) for the first couple songs to win them over, then back off (again, appropriate to the energy level) and ramp back up. I'll usually have a loose ""set"" of 10-15m in mind, though most times I'll drop that once I feel out the crowd and start improvising.  Does that help? :)"

Some days I start DJing at home and nothing sounds right and I have to step away, clear my head, and come back to it. I never try to mix frantically, whether practicing or live, because if I can't hold a steady feeling or start amping things up, the crowd won't be able to settle.  As far as live goes, if I have an hour I do the best set I can in an hour based around the time. First hour? Then it is going to be a build-up, start slow and get them moving kind of set. If it's peak hour then it's peak hour. I have a residency with a friend where we split a 3-hour night, 90 minutes each. It isn't the same as the 4 hour sets I used to do, but anything less than an hour makes it difficult to really experience a set.

The latter of those shouldn't technically be required on a calibrated deck but the problem comes when the pitch is out of calibration and therefore the center sensor will adjust the pitch to zero when you may have already hit that point on the slider. You can either just do those two mods (not rocket science, takes about an hour if you're decent with a screwdriver) or you could just buy a M3D pitch and install that on each deck."

It's a minor annoyance at worst, even with double zeroes on uncalibrated decks. Totally personal preference if you think it's worth seeking m3d's or mk5's out."

DJs,3a50xy,dj_soo,1 point,Wed Jun 17 14:09:50 2015 UTC,The first option wouldn't work unless you were using two laptops - even if you were playing strictly vinyl with the amx cause it needs serato open to play vinyl.  You can only use one controller at a time with serato dj.  Easiest option would be to get a DVS capable controller like the sx2

DJs,3a50xy,ronconcoca,0,Thu Jun 18 20:22:04 2015 UTC,I'd output the SR to the Left Channel on the AMX and the Turntable would be connected to the Right Channel on the AMX. The AMX would then be output to the PA/Stereo/Whatever.  I'm assuming I could control two decks in Serato DJ with the SR and a Control record to control a third deck … ?
DJs,3a50xy,dj_soo,2,Wed Jun 17 08:10:08 2015 UTC,I dont think that would work.

Then I have a 4tb thunderbolt as a back up at my house. I don't use the thunderbolt as my main bc all it did was give me problem for playing long sets. Then I have another 4tb USB3.0 at my parents house hooked up to a computer with team viewer and Dropbox. The. I just Dropbox any updates and move them over using team viewer. My dads also a Dj that uses my main since we Dj at totally different times so this works out really well.

DJs,3a3kav,SuperEliteMegaPoster,2,Wed Jun 17 14:49:31 2015 UTC,"Get a NAS, network attached storage. synology disk station is a good product. It hooks up to your router or network switch and acts like a harddrive that your computer can access over your home network.  A bonus is that many smart TVs, modern consoles and similar devices can connect to it aswell and stream all your vacation videos that you recorded yourself! Your family can now access all data. Custom access per family member can also be set up in some cases.  Many people reccomend the cloud, and thats great because you can access your files anywhere, and you get off site backup, keeping your files safe from example a fire. But the speeds you'll get will be low compared to a NAS, something to consider if you dj with highquality WAV files. And you will not be able to stream your videos over the network to your devices."
DJs,3a3kav,ClownTaint,1 point,Wed Jun 17 11:41:21 2015 UTC,"This is what I was going to recommend as well. If you're strapped for cash, buy a NAS from Best Buy or something, back everything up to it, reinstall your OS, transfer all your files back onto the machine, and take the NAS back the next day.  It's a pretty shyster thing to do for sure, but not illegal."

DJs,3a3kav,ClownTaint,1 point,Wed Jun 17 21:01:00 2015 UTC,OP's dilemma is that he has no working USB ports because of a driver failure. His normal backup is to a USB drive. The NAS is a temporary solution.

DJs,3a50w3,Djblee,4,Wed Jun 17 07:35:43 2015 UTC,Nope you're right. Sync is for little else than two songs 5 bpm or less apart. Not super beneficial for open-format.
DJs,3a50w3,sbFRESH,2,Wed Jun 17 07:55:03 2015 UTC,That's what I figured but wasn't sure if I was missing something crucial.
DJs,3a50w3,erratic_calm,1 point,Wed Jun 17 08:05:25 2015 UTC,Yes and no. If you use Serato DJ and mark all the downbeats properly it can work pretty well.

DJs,3a50w3,sbFRESH,2,Thu Jun 18 03:50:32 2015 UTC,"Next time you use sync to mix reggae and rock at 20 bpms apart, and it sounds good, you let me know.  Sync was developed to make trivial transitions more trivial. I don't mean that as a knock to people who use sync, it just simply wasn't meant for gymnastics."
DJs,3a50w3,dj_soo,2,Thu Jun 18 04:34:54 2015 UTC,"why would you want to beatmatch anything that's 20 bpm apart?  just using sync on two rock tunes at the same tempo would show you that it's pretty useless for anything but electronic music and even then, it's mainly just house beats that don't require a bunch of extra work setting beatgrids.    People go on about how much time is saved using sync to do other things when most people who have practiced enough can get things matched in seconds.  I'd rather have more time digging for tunes and practicing than setting a bunch of beatgrids."
DJs,3a50w3,sbFRESH,2,Thu Jun 18 05:24:25 2015 UTC,I think you misunderstood my comment. I agree with you. I was saying it's pointless to try using sync with a gap that large.
DJs,3a50w3,Dubliminal,1 point,Thu Jun 18 15:09:21 2015 UTC,"So you're going from 5BPM difference to 20?  Four times that amount?     It's quite reasonable that a leap beyond 5BPM and well below 20 is feasible, is it not?"
DJs,3a50w3,sbFRESH,1 point,Thu Jun 18 06:09:01 2015 UTC,"It is, but generally when you start altering BPMs 5+, it becomes very obvious and quality degrades exponentially from there. There are exceptions, but it's a pretty common rule of thumb. (This is unless you're altering bpms of both songs to meet in the middle.)  When you're getting beyond 5 bpms, especially in an open format set, it's time to start thinking about not using traditional methods like beat matching or sync."

DJs,3a50w3,DJHouseArrest,1 point,Wed Jun 17 15:28:14 2015 UTC,Yeah if you are trying to beat match double time... ie. 140 over 70 I can't imagine sync would help out a lot.  Best to just do it by ear.
DJs,3a50w3,dj_soo,1 point,Wed Jun 17 15:50:10 2015 UTC,it works fine in serato actually.  They take doubled and halved mixing into account.

DJs,3a50w3,sbFRESH,2,Wed Jun 17 18:29:20 2015 UTC,"I will do so in very occasional cases. I was taught long ago, that the best time to make a quick pitch shift is the second the vocals start. So I'd sync something up, let the into transition over, and immediately drop back to actual time as the vocals started. It took some practice, but it works reasonably well.   That's the only time sync is capable of doing much of anything for me though. When I'm lazy and with a reasonable BPM."

DJs,3a50w3,Sognarly,2,Thu Jun 18 04:36:43 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it works surprisingly well. It’s a great little trick and occasionally even has DJs scratching their heads to figure it out when they hear it."

Yeah I guess it's pretty open format)  I don't use sync cause it just fucks me up!   Sync is a tool, not a crutch. And you don't have to use all the tools."
DJs,3a50w3,sbFRESH,2,Thu Jun 18 00:04:36 2015 UTC,"I don't use sync in my sets but I do use auto tempo to transition while making very high BPM jumps.  Usually goes like this  -Have 100 BPM song playing  -Drop 128 BPM song slowed to 100 on top  -Use auto tempo on 128 song  -bring pitch back up to 128, other song begins to rise in BPM with 128 song  -transition"

DJs,3a50w3,endmass,1 point,Thu Jun 18 04:38:31 2015 UTC,"Yes, however it depends on the song. Those with a lot of vocals tend to not work, but I've done it with drum breaks relatively easily. Going from 100 to 128 to 70 really helps vary the set."
DJs,3a50w3,dj_soo,1 point,Thu Jun 18 15:54:03 2015 UTC,"Might be beneficial to say what I use opps. I use serato scratch live and serato Dj depending where or what I'm doing.

DJs,3a50w3,endmass,2,Wed Jun 17 15:37:33 2015 UTC,"when you're playing music between 70 and 180 bpm, it helps to at least know the ranges of your music at a glance - either by having the bpms printed, or at least by ordering your tunes by tempo ranges.  I used to write the bpms on the sleeves of my records - it was never an exact tempo, but it made it easy to know at a glance what I was mixing.  Open format DJs also tend to have and bring much more music to gigs than genre DJs - even in the vinyl days, I would bring 5+ crates of records to a gig simply because I was usually playing open to close.  If you mainly stick to one genre that doesn't have drastically different tempo changes, then you don't really have to know them.  Fo instance, hip hop can be anywhere from 70 bpm to 130 bpm."
DJs,3a50w3,dj_soo,1 point,Thu Jun 18 05:28:11 2015 UTC,"... Unless you are either not mixing at all, or mixing a genre that only has one bpm, you HAVE to pay attention to tempo. What are you talking about?"
DJs,3a50w3,sbFRESH,1 point,Thu Jun 18 04:40:11 2015 UTC,"I couldn't honestly tell you what bpm any of my collection is. Never paid attention.  All counting is done in the back of my mind. Just know the music and you'll know what you can get away with.  No op, sync sucks for this sort of thing. Even anything with syncopated bass will mess it up. You are far more accurate, depending on skill of coarse."
DJs,3a50w3,dj_soo,1 point,Thu Jun 18 04:48:53 2015 UTC,"it's possible to pay attention to tempo without paying attention to the exact bpm of tracks.  When my record collection was smaller, I had them ordered by general tempo range.  I couldn't tell you what exact bpm a record in my ""midtempo"" section would be, but I knew it was somewhere between 105 and 115...  Same with my drum n bass records - I had no idea the exact bpm other than know they would mix together because they were all drum n bass.  When my collection got a lot larger, I started using a tap-tempo device and just writing it down on the sleeve, but even then it was never all that precise - I just wanted to know the general range of the track."
DJs,3a50w3,dj_soo,1 point,Thu Jun 18 05:34:08 2015 UTC,"Fair enough. I assumed this OP was suggesting that, with a working DJs collection, it was completely normal to just have no idea what BPM or range you were in. Just * know * whether or not every song can work into every other song, which is ridiculous with a moderate to large library."
DJs,3a50w3,dj_soo,1 point,Thu Jun 18 15:23:33 2015 UTC,He said somewhere that he mainly plays house and techno so it's all roughly in the same Bpm
DJs,3a50w3,bartykutz,1 point,Fri Jun 19 00:08:16 2015 UTC,The only time I use the sync button is if I want to mix a tune that's a little further apart in Bpm than my pitch slider goes.  I use sync to centre the slider at 0 - make sure sync isn't activated on the other side and then pitch ride it with the slider comfortably at the centre rather than pitch riding it at +7 where I could run out of room.
DJs,3a50w3,the_bigwiggle,1 point,Wed Jun 17 15:45:46 2015 UTC,This would come in handy when in using vinyl where I only have +/-8%
DJs,3a50w3,DJSnap,1 point,Wed Jun 17 18:32:04 2015 UTC,"Yea, I mainly do it with turntables since controllers let you increase the pitch range - although when riding unquantized tunes, it's nicer to have the smaller range for better resolution..."
DJs,3a50w3,statsfodder,1 point,Wed Jun 17 19:02:05 2015 UTC,"yeah, when i get a dustball in the needle and the time to mix is coming up. knowing how to make ""sync"" work is as important as knowing any of your other tools. I don't rely on it but if I have to use I know exactly how it's gonna work."
DJs,3a50w3,marcusthejames,1 point,Thu Jun 18 02:16:23 2015 UTC,That's a good point I should probably practice this. Always have used the pitch bend keys on my keyboard in that scenario.
DJs,3a3fad,nathansimm,3,Tue Jun 16 22:37:24 2015 UTC,Just be straight forward with whoever you're talking to. What is the event? What's the expected music? Who's opening for their client? What's the venue? How many people are you expecting? Stuff like that.
DJs,3a3fad,sixsixmusic,3,Tue Jun 16 23:37:24 2015 UTC,"This and then make an offer based on your budget or request their ask price. Often you can negotiate prices by offering volume, i.e. either you confirm several gigs throughout the year (and pay a percentage upfront) or you are reaching out to other clubs in the surrounding cities and ask if they are interested in a second gig on the same weekend. Then you guys can do travel and accommodation cost shares. The gig price might go down too if you can offer the artist more than one gig."

""    Hey label name if generic email or name of artist representative etc.  Im interested in booking ""NAME OF DJ"" at ""NAME OF VENUE"" on ""DATE OF EVENT"". We have a budget in mind for our event and were wondering if you could please confirm if the artist is free on this data and his booking fee.  Thanks for your time,  All agencies are different. Some require the strangest information which i personally don't like giving. This is partially to ensure the artist they are representing upholds their image of being a ""super star dj"" and not end up playing to an empty club as it looks bad on them even if its the promotors fault.   Others just want to know if you can pay in full, up front to secure the booking.   If they want more info from you they will ask for it. I generally like to keep it short and sweet.

DJs,3a3fad,bonestx,2,Sat Jun 20 05:50:13 2015 UTC,"You need to provide specifics so that they know you are serious. Your already ahead of the game with the date, and venue. But also, it helps if you mention other artists that you have booked at the venue as well as the capacity. The bigger the artist, the more information that it is necessary that you provide.   Finding out the booking price is going to take some more research.  Agents will typically tell you one of three things if you contact them about a price, they will give you a range on the higher end, or tell you to send in an offer and they will look at it, or simply just not respond at all. You need to have an idea of how much you will pay for the artist before contacting the agent. How do you get an idea of what the price of the artist is? You need to look at where the artist has performed before (look at capacity, and ticket price), and also see what other artists in the same lane as that artist are going for.   I recommend you read this article on drafting out an email for emailing a booking agent here: http://blog.bookingagentinfo.com/email-celebrity-booking-agent/. Hope that helps! and let me know if I can provide you anymore info.   Thanks"

DJs,3a0urf,h_greg,2,Tue Jun 16 20:00:52 2015 UTC,"This is decent advice if you're actually experiencing a cpu temp problem that isn't fixed by cleaning out the airflow paths. I would not generally advise someone to do this under any other circumstance because it's somewhat labor intensive and there's always some risk involved when pulling apart a laptop, especially if it's not something you're very experienced with. Use software to monitor cpu temps during heavy load to determine whether there is really a problem. If the CPU isn't breaking 60C under full load there's no reason to replace the paste. For Windows OS, use Core Temp for monitoring and try to push your laptop cpu using a  benchmarking or burn-in app. There are probably Mac equivalents. Be aware that most laptops are not built to run continuously under the maximum possible cpu load, but your audio software is unlikely to create such a load. The most brutal burn-in software I've come across is prime95. I have not ever met a laptop that could run it on full blast without overheating very quickly."

Sometimes drive failure is a slow creeping problem which may manifest as some files taking longer and longer to read, rather than just a total machine failure all at once.  SSD upgrading most laptops is relatively possible, and that makes you much less exposed to mechanical risk as well as improving general speed of the machine overall. If you're not a highly techy person, it might be worth getting a nerdier nerd to help you out with that upgrade."

Yes it's a bit sad when he thinks he's invented a thing or cries out that the sky is falling, just because he isn't full-time on top of following the serious research mailing lists and news sources, but he's damn good at explaining technical details in an audio-only forum, and Spinrite most assuredly DOES work because I've had it dig me out of sector-failure holes and make files readable once more which would otherwise crash the PC when trying to read them.  If there's any alternative security podcasts you'd suggest in place of Security Now, please do share.  But I do fully concur that Spinrite is not an alternative to a back-up. It can't stop something being accidentally deleted, or Cryptolocker et al from crushing your hopes and dreams, or from someone stealing or physically damaging your computer.

If you care enough to write 5 paragraphs defending it, all the links in the world aren't going to change your mind if you think it helps.   The things you're talking about it fixing are nothing that checkdisk, dd and the like can't fix. I mean, when the entire premise of the app (in the name no less) is that it does things like adjust interleaving and things that we haven't had to worry about since the 80's, I call BS. I don't like to speak negatively about people, but I have to maintain that SG is spouting outdated pseudo-tech help to people that aren't well informed enough to know better.   If you want a security podcast, you're kind of already barking up the wrong tree. Most people who know their stuff are actually DOING security, not making a tenth of the money doing podcasts.

DJs,39y8x8,lemonjalo,13,Tue Jun 16 15:01:02 2015 UTC,"Not entirely relevant to your post, but I'd still like to share..  I became a DJ three years ago, using Traktor and a Kontrol S2. I used sync almost all the time, and while I got the hang of some parts of DJing (such as phrasing, making clean transitions, etc.) I never really understood what the big deal about not using sync was.  That is, until I got a pair of CDJ-2000s and a DJM-900 mixer over the past few months. For those of you that don't have much experience with CDJs, the 2000s don't have any sync buttons. It was a pretty hard transition at first, but I'm having more fun using them now than I've had in the past three years. Manual beatmatching and manual looping is pretty technical, but making a good transition with them is immensely gratifying and it's actually made DJing fun for me again!  If you're reading this and have never manually beatmatched, I really encourage you to. Cover your laptop screens except for the song info (and maybe BPM reading) and go for it. You'll see what I'm talking about!  Again, doesn't totally fit your question, but it's just my two cents ;)"

Step 3: check it to be sure  There's also an option to 'mark grid' but make sure the tempo comes out right/half/double. Generally, I don't care if it's not in 4/4 time sig, I'd rather the grid be on 4/4 with the bpm right for the measure than all the phasing issues traktor generates."

DJs,39y8x8,MOSF3T,2,Tue Jun 16 04:51:10 2015 UTC,"I use both styles together. Like if I don't leave myself much room for a transition and I know the grid is right on the track, I'll use tempo/beat sync. If I've got time to work on it, I won't use either and dial it in, usually with loop and/or flux.  I personally think tempo sync is a godsend, but phase sync is something to be avoided for artistic purpose (it's not bad, just limiting). But I really think the magic happens when you let off sync and keylock and feel the transition taking you somewhere new; a little tension makes for a rewarding release."

DJs,39y8x8,nowenknows,3,Mon Jun 15 20:26:22 2015 UTC,"Beatgrids are the problem in those cases. They have to be set right. If the kick is too melodic, or the song has an intro that's loud but not a kick, the beatgrid could be off. It only takes a couple keyboard shortcuts to adjust them, at least in serato dj and in traktor.   Even if you continue to beatmatch manually... I'd look at them for other functions. Like auto loops, especially loop roll buildups, if you have buttons for those they won't be perfectly on unless the beatgrid is."
DJs,39y8x8,Prancemaster,1 point,Mon Jun 15 20:30:13 2015 UTC,I had a suspicion I was going to have to look in to all those functions as Serato Dj and traktor become more prevalent over scratch live. I just don't want to have to let go!

With the effects, picking the next song and finger drumming, I still have free time as it is. I even deliberately leave a song lagging or sped up a hair just so I can keep feathering it in.

So what if you're just standing in the booth? Chances are, nobody gives a shit except you and they're only looking in your direction because the sound and lighting are generating from that area. It's not like they can see what you're doing inside the booth unless they're either right up on the booth or inside of it.   Would 'doing something' be adding to what the song is already giving to the listeners? If not, just enjoy the song.

I never use sync either, it's unnecessary, keeping the beats on time by looking at the waveforms is too easy."
DJs,39y8x8,Prancemaster,2,Tue Jun 16 10:18:04 2015 UTC,I cant beatmatch by ear to save myself   Practice without the waveforms then. Beatmatching using waveforms does not count as beatmatching
DJs,39y8x8,rothwick,1 point,Tue Jun 16 13:04:26 2015 UTC,"Eh, im not too fussed, is my performance any better or worse if im matching by ear or by eye or by sync button, if i can do it quickly i can spend more time on things that matter, like song selection and phrasing and looking good."
DJs,39y8x8,Prancemaster,1 point,Tue Jun 16 13:08:49 2015 UTC,"It's not about taking shortcuts. By avoiding beatmatching you are just skipping ahead to where so many others practice for hours and hours to get to. But, you are worse off because of that choice. What happens when the venue only got CDJs? like 99% of clubs for example? What happens when technology fails you, will it just sound like shit and you go ""sorry"" then play next track after some awkward silence?   Learn to beatmatch, it's step 1 of DJing."
DJs,39y8x8,rothwick,2,Tue Jun 16 13:14:34 2015 UTC,"Yes. I have never met a single person that learned how to do it claim that it was a waste of time. It literally can only make you better. It's like a guitar player learning to read sheet music. Tabs are fine, and there are some amazing guitar players that can't read music, but none that took time to learn it will ever tell you they wished they hadn't."

Step 3: If they do, send yours in, at least 1 every week, and don't stop til they play one.  If they don't play mixes, go to step 4.  Step 4:  I have no idea why I did step 4, I'm outta ideas.  I suppose the next step is trying to get exposure, get enough people talking about you, and your local station would be more than happy to play your mix, but we're talking at least 1,000 likes on facebook, or twitter followers, and this is to get on a small station."
DJs,39ytrv,DJRobOwen,2,Mon Jun 15 22:32:26 2015 UTC,"Step 2: Do they put on mixes that they're sent in?   Used to work in radio in the US in a medium-sized metro area with lots of young people  Trendy stations (pop, top 40, electronic, etc.) tended to have one or two resident mixing DJs tops or would syndicate some famous DJ's sets from across the country or internationally. Where I worked and where I got to know other stations where people I knew worked, they were never open to taking demos.  That's not guaranteed to be the case everywhere but just imagine how many demos that a station would receive from aspiring DJs in their area if they were open to receive them. Basically half of the entire DJ and wannabe-DJ population from the entire region of the country would submit something.  The station where I worked had at the very least one person per week physically come into the office asking to work there, varying from being willing to basically be their garbage boy to asking for a weekly show with basically no following, history, or resume of involvement in music or playing music. Every single time they were turned away because we weren't hiring, but every single week they came even though we had no help wanted ads anywhere.  Submitting to internet radio is the way to go if you ask me!"

E: Amazon is always a good place to start."
DJs,39tzqj,jonmitz,2,Sun Jun 14 21:19:50 2015 UTC,"Are you buying the 4trak new or used? I'm assuming used since the 4trak would be far more expensive than the S2 if you're buying it new. With that being said, I wouldn't suggest buying a controller used. You never know what you're going to get if you're buying it used, and controllers aren't exactly easy to repair. You can get a new Numark NS6 (which is basically the 4trak without the effects rack) for $500 as an alternative, or go with the S2.  To answer your question, like /u/jonmitz said, Amazon is a good place to start. If you end up going with an NS6 over the S2, Guitar Center's website is the cheapest that I've seen at $500 opposed to $600. That brings me to another point:   I've gotten both of my controllers in person at Guitar Center for less than what I would've paid online. When I purchased my ddj-sz, I asked if they could go any lower with the price. The guy said that he would match the lowest price that he finds online. IDK what shady website he found, but I got it for $1,780 instead of $2,000 and used the savings for their warranty which has saved me twice already. It's worth checking out, but I'm not guaranteeing that you'll have the same experience. Just something to contemplate.   Also, camelcamelcamel is pretty good (but not perfect) at helping you see if you're getting a good deal. Good luck!"

DJs,39tzqj,kfc_spork,1 point,Mon Jun 15 00:00:05 2015 UTC,I recently bought an S4 at Guitar Center. I normally buy through amazon but was interested in their Pro Coverage plan. (I didn't end up buying it because I was unsure of whether it covered incidental damages like spilling liquid on the controller. The guy in the store claimed it did but the terms on the site seemed to indicate otherwise.)  Ultimately I was very glad that I at least visited GC as playing with the various controllers eliminated all doubt in my mind - the NI controllers just make the Newmarks look like crappy toys. I bought the S4 because I thought I'd like to have 4 channels but tbh rarely use more than 2. However the $300 price diff is entirely worth it for me just to get the cooler transport knobs with 2-digit display. It sounds silly but it's sooooo useful to have. The tight integration between Traktor and the NI controllers is unparalleled. It wasn't fun to swallow the price tag but now that I spend so much time working with it I'm really glad I coughed up the cash up front.
DJs,39tzqj,fatdjsin,1 point,Mon Jun 15 17:41:03 2015 UTC,The reviews on the 4trak say it is a well built controller that it the best option for traktor. so idk. I started looking at the Pioneer ddj-s1 and ddj-t1 now too. and the pioneer ns6 looks good too.
