If planets were out of resonance they would be unstable and be slowly brought into the closest and most stable resonance for their distance and speed.

It makes a lot of funny noises and it's hard to adjust just right to get the right amount of heat. I'm always fighting with the interface and computer that controls everything. I feel like IT comes first, and my needs come second.   Some dishes are not a problem, others it just doesn't work.   It also likes to turn itself off every now and then. Like...cooking soups for 4 hours and stuff like that. You come back and realize that nothing has been cooking and you have no idea when it shut itself off.   Cooking with a wok? Forget about it. As soon as you lift the pot 1/2 inch from the cook top the heat is gone. The pan has to stay on the cook top. So...there are rules.   Gas (fire) is still the clear winner in my book.   That said, clean up is super easy and they are a bit more safe. Just not for the professional or home-pro cook."
BeAmazed,3di6eg,INTERNET_TRASHCAN,7,Thu Jul 16 16:51:15 2015 UTC,"Ugh. I'm right there with you. I can't wait til it starts to go so I can replace it with a gas unit. My wife sold me on the safety aspect, but it's taken half the fun out of cooking for me.  I do love the cleanup, though."

I can still make the induction system work, but the richness of flavor and the quality of the cooking just seems to come out better with fire.   Can't figure out why that is...unless it's all in my head.   Obviously, grilling meat is proof of this to some degree. Maybe it's just my inner cave man."

I used all the same pans, all the same ingredients, but everything all of a sudden tasted better. The main difference, I believe, is the texture that is produced in the food. Noodles don't get over boiled and hold a firmer texture, sauces seem to get thicker and richer. It's hard to explain, but I'm right there with you."

BeAmazed,3di6eg,NEVERDOUBTED,7,Thu Jul 16 19:40:47 2015 UTC,"This is another good point. With induction you have to use certain types of pots and pans or there is no heat. Cast iron would not be a problem, but I do think the heat from fire into cast iron is better than magnetic/electrons.   Induction is neat shit, but the bottom line - fire is the where it's at.  And nothing will ever top grilling over an open flame. Think about how much better even a wood fired pizza is."
BeAmazed,3di6eg,CrimsonScythe,5,Thu Jul 16 20:56:14 2015 UTC,"I used to have one of these in my house when I was younger. It is terrible for traditional cooking, as it only works while the dish is actually making contact with the surface. Though we also never had any of the technical problems you did.

The only issue with it is that I can't use a traditional round-bottomed wok with it, but you get induction hobs for that as well. (Although, they're insanely expensive.) I think I wouldn't mind getting a single large gas burner in addition, for wok cooking. Otherwise, I wouldn't change the induction hob for anything in the world...  Except for the issue of lifting the pot too far off the hob, I haven't experienced any of your other issues. (Neither have I heard of anyone having those problems. Induction hobs are very common where I live.)"

BeAmazed,3di6eg,NEVERDOUBTED,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:18:52 2015 UTC,", Guess you basically just got a crappy product there. A hob really shouldn't behave like yours, and most definitively not catch fire. Though on the other hand, you may end up cooking with fire after all...  What I don't like with gas is keeping the hob clean, not to mention all the heat it puts out in the kitchen. Kinds sucks in the summer, I think. (Not to mention having to get gas bottles for the hob, since we're not connected to any gas lines here.)"
BeAmazed,3di6eg,binkledinklerinkle,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:25:31 2015 UTC,When I remodeled my other place we installed a five burner GE Monogram unit that was gas on glass. That was a much easier clean-up than I see with other gas units.  But..you are right...the cleanup on the unit I have is crazy easy.
BeAmazed,3di6eg,Jg283641,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:32:51 2015 UTC,Do you have to be careful about burning yourself on the glass? Sounds like something I would do.
BeAmazed,3di6eg,Skullriot,2,Sat Jul 18 01:03:02 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind that the glass on induction gets hot because the hot pan heats the glass. The unit I have keeps an ""H"" on the panel after the pot has been removed to warn you that it's hot.   So yes, when you put half a pot on induction, the one half without the pan doesn't heat up. But...the glass under the pot is always hot.   Gas on glass. You don't ever come into contact with the glass as there are grills above the glass. So...when sometime boils over or spills, it just lands on a non hot glass of which you wipe up later. Smart.   http://www.specsserver.com/CACHE/FRYEHOGHQEDL.JPG?width=800&height=-1"
BeAmazed,3di6eg,Lukimcsod,6,Sat Jul 18 01:43:16 2015 UTC,"My parents had an induction range, it really sucked. They eventually switched to gas  (which is king imo)"
BeAmazed,3di6eg,notwithstupid,5,Thu Jul 16 18:23:09 2015 UTC,This guy has no clue how to make smores
BeAmazed,3di6eg,just_testing3,13,Thu Jul 16 16:54:28 2015 UTC,Explanation for those of us who don't understand why the whole thing isn't melting?
BeAmazed,3di6eg,notwithstupid,26,Thu Jul 16 15:54:22 2015 UTC,"Basically my understanding is you have a coil of wire in the stove which runs electricty through it making a magnetic field. This induces a magnetic field in the cookware (hence induction) and this causes the reverse effect and the cookware wants to make an electrical current. But since it has nowhere to go, the energy turns to heat. Sorta like shorting out a battery."
BeAmazed,3di6eg,rxt_ian,10,Thu Jul 16 16:09:39 2015 UTC,"That doesn't quite make sense to me. There is no changing magnetic flux, therefore there should be no induced current.   Do I have a bad understanding of maxwell's laws?"
BeAmazed,3di6eg,just_testing3,10,Thu Jul 16 17:19:01 2015 UTC,"There is an alternating electric current, that runs through the coil of metal inside the stove, creating a fluctuating magnetic field which in turn causes the induction."
BeAmazed,3di6eg,eternalbachelor,3,Thu Jul 16 17:29:27 2015 UTC,The current in an electrical heating element is AC? Is this true for most electric stoves?
BeAmazed,3di6eg,Skullriot,5,Thu Jul 16 17:44:58 2015 UTC,"Yes but most stoves have a resistive element which directly emits heat. Induction stoves have an inductive element, which converts to electrical energy into a magnetic field. The magnetic field is converted back to electrical energy in the pan itself, in the form of eddy currents which generate heat due to the resistance of the pan."
BeAmazed,3di6eg,warplayer,2,Thu Jul 16 18:18:39 2015 UTC,"The current in an induction stove has to be AC or you won't get any induction due to the stable magnetic field that occurs with DC.   I don't know if the current that runs through a normal electrical stove is AC or DC, but I assume it is AC, too."
BeAmazed,3di6eg,Buttraper,2,Thu Jul 16 18:19:42 2015 UTC,"Yep they're AC.  Fun fact: I work with industrial sized induction heaters for removing studs from steam turbines.  Only it steps up the frequency of power from 60hz (normal AC) to around 25kHz.  So now the magnetic field is expanding and collapsing through the metal 25 000 per second.    It takes about a minute and half to heat a six inch diameter stud hot enough that it can't be touched, and the wand that goes into the stud has to be water cooled."

BeAmazed,3di6eg,likeikelike,9,Thu Jul 16 17:14:02 2015 UTC,"A magnetic field is produced by the stove top, the pan heats up because of the fluctuating magnetic forces it experiences.   This is very safe, the stove top doesn't heat up, only the pan. It works on the same principle as induction welding."
BeAmazed,3di6eg,Mad102190,3,Thu Jul 16 18:38:08 2015 UTC,That can be a future of cooking right there. I can see it now

BeAmazed,3d5e9v,Jg283641,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:14:31 2015 UTC,Find the closest flight school.  Tell them you want to go on a Discovery Flight.  Expect to spend $125-$175 depending on the type of airplane and the duration of the flight.  Spend another $15 on the ground to buy a logbook.  Log the hours (the instructor you flew with will gladly sign off on the dual).  You'll get to fly the plane and everything.  It'll last an hour to an hour and a half.  It'll be one of the best experiences of your life.  If you live outside of (or below the shelf of) busy airspace there shouldn't be any trouble taking you over your house.

BeAmazed,3d5e9v,coolsoundingme,-3,Wed Jul 15 05:19:44 2015 UTC,"Dad Teaches 4 year old about gravity and centripetal force   The toothbrush or spoon or whatever it is, would normally slide off the dash at that pitch, however the centripetal force exerted on it is keeping it from falling off the dash, not gravity (alright, maybe a little gravity). Notice how the ring by the window shifts before the plane hits its apex, the force is gone, the item starts to move, then it goes flying when they experience that brief moment of weightlessness at the apex, that's where the lesson about gravity (or lack thereof) is."
BeAmazed,3d5e9v,mrMouseR,6,Mon Jul 13 22:59:18 2015 UTC,"There isn't a lack of gravity at any point in the video. The toothbrush appears to rise and move backward because once it leaves the dash at the apex of the climb, it enters free fall. At that point the motion of the brush has 2 parts.  Part 1. It's accelerating straight down, but so is the plane, which is why it appears to float. It can't hit the floor if the floor is falling away from it.   Part 2. Then it's moving forward with left over speed from when it was ""attached"" to the plane and moving WITH it at 150 mph or whatever. Now that it's no longer attached to the plane, its forward motion is slowing down, but the plane's forward motion is not slowing down with it because it's engine is still driving it forward. As a result, the back of the plane is ""catching up"" to the toothbrush, making it APPEAR as though the tooth brush were floating backwards."
BeAmazed,3d5e9v,Quothefool,0,Tue Jul 14 00:42:15 2015 UTC,Ah...so...I don't see how gravity or any force has anything to do with the brush floating in the air.   There is always gravity...and the only forces acting against something are the plane and passengers and anything else that is tied down.   The brush is just simply falling slower than the airplane and the kid.
BeAmazed,3d5e9v,NEVERDOUBTED,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:49:08 2015 UTC,"Ugh, we get it, there is ""always gravity"". But that brief moment of weightlessness is essentially equal to being in a zero-g environment."
BeAmazed,3d5e9v,mrMouseR,0,Wed Jul 15 20:51:43 2015 UTC,"Consider this. If you hold your hand out flat and place a toothbrush on it, then very quickly drop your hand towards the ground, the toothbrush seemingly floats away (above) from your hand.   Same thing is happening in this video.   Gravity in both cases is always present and acting upon the plane and brush. Both the plane and the brush are falling, but the plane is able to fall faster because of the forces acting against the wings.   That said, I assume there are different meanings to ""zero-g"", as there are those moments where you are not experiencing any gravitational forces despite gravity being present, and also those cases where there is no gravity at all, such as space."

If you hold your hand out flat and place a toothbrush on it, then very quickly drop your hand towards the ground, the toothbrush seemingly floats away (above) from your hand.   No, that's completely different. Go take a physics 101 class please."
BeAmazed,3d5e9v,mrMouseR,0,Wed Jul 15 21:38:14 2015 UTC,"Ah...no...it's exactly the same.   Both the plane and brush are falling towards the earth due to the earth's gravity, but the plane is falling faster due to the down force on the wings.   This makes it appear that the brush is floating.   Hope this helps."
BeAmazed,3d5e9v,NEVERDOUBTED,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:14:25 2015 UTC,"Ah...no...it isn't. You can clearly see the brush accelerating upward after the plane stops, aka it is experiencing a moment of weightlessness just like the passengers, until it hits equilibrium and gravity begins to pull it back towards earth. It really is physics 101. Hope that helps."
BeAmazed,3d5e9v,mrMouseR,0,Wed Jul 15 23:14:47 2015 UTC,It doesn't help. You're wrong.   You seem to think there are some other magical forces at play here.  Accelerating upwards? Really? Have you never been in a small plane and done this?   The plane is in a climb. The plane goes into a radical decent (also known as falling). Possible stall.   Everything in there not tied down is falling slower than the plane itself. It appears to float.   See that little card holder on the wall?   Same shit as this.   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reduced_gravity_aircraft

BeAmazed,3d08yu,PiERetro,8,Sun Jul 12 19:47:30 2015 UTC,They are always floating. The anchors just prevent it from floating away and hold it in position. I've worked on these things for 10 years now.
BeAmazed,3d08yu,Ileach,8,Sun Jul 12 21:44:34 2015 UTC,"I thought the anchor lines were under tension, so it is lower in the water than it would be when free, and therefore doesn't move around as much."
BeAmazed,3d08yu,PiERetro,5,Sun Jul 12 23:04:26 2015 UTC,"The anchor lines are under tension and these hold the vessel in position. The draft of the vessel is controlled by flooding or pumping out ballast tanks located in the pontoons and legs.   Edit: the anchor chains and lines on these are very long. On one contract, we had one of our anchors over a mile away. If you were to see an overhead view of the mooring diagram, it would look a bit like an odd 12 legged spider."
BeAmazed,3d08yu,Ileach,3,Sun Jul 12 23:13:16 2015 UTC,"Amazing vessels! Was Borgholm Dolphin at Shearwater last year? If so, that's the vessel I stayed on!"

BeAmazed,3d08yu,Ileach,10,Sun Jul 12 23:23:16 2015 UTC,"I assume this isn't a production rig?! Regardless, when this thing is doing what it's suppose to, will anchors be enough to not bend/stretch pipes and such beyond breaking?"
BeAmazed,3d08yu,Bjens,10,Sun Jul 12 15:08:12 2015 UTC,It's an accommodation. It's moored by a 12 point mooring system. 3 anchors/chains on each corner. These things will hold position in weather that will send most other ships back to port. They are by far the safest and most stable floating objects in the North Sea.

BeAmazed,3d08yu,abdbatman112,9,Sun Jul 12 15:21:07 2015 UTC,"Having worked on it, I assure you it's definitely moving. It's usually attached to an oil production platform by a gangway. They use it when there is a need for a lot of personnel, more than can be accommodated by the platforms facilities.   In weather like this, everyone goes back to the accommodation barge (which is what it is), the gangway is retracted, and the barge is moved away from the platform by the anchor winches to a safe distance. Then, everyone watched videos and chills out until the seas go down. It makes a nice break from working 😊"

BeAmazed,3d08yu,Ileach,9,Sun Jul 12 18:12:59 2015 UTC,"The video was taken from a fixed oil platform (The Lomond Platform if I remember correctly). This platform produces/processes oil. The rig being filmed is the Borgholm Dolphin. She is a moored semi submersible accommodation platform.   When a platform such as the Lomond requires maintenance or modification, it will not have enough accommodation on board to hold all personnel required to carry out the work. As such, they will hire in an accommodation platform like this which will be positioned alongside the fixed platform and connected by means of an articulated gangway which allows the accommodation platform to move in relation to the fixed platform. The extra workers required for the project will eat/sleep/stay on the accommodation rig and then transit across the gangway to carry out work on the fixed platform.  In this case, the rig is positioned by means of anchors. It can manoeuvre itself in relation to the fixed platform by heaving in on certain winches while paying out on other winches. When the weather gets really bad, it will lift the gangway and pull itself away from the platform using the winches. It will then de-ballast up to survival draft in order to prevent waves from hitting the underside of the rig and causing damage.  Other rigs use DP (Dynamic Positioning) and hold position using thrusters. Others use a combination of anchors and thrusters in a system known as TAMS- Thruster Assisted Mooring System."

BeAmazed,3cwsx6,wardrich,539,Sun Jul 12 08:07:57 2015 UTC,"Has the technology gotten that good?   No. What happens is that when the laser hits the skin it vaporizes the water in the skin, turning it temporarily lighter. In about 20 minutes that discoloration goes away, and there is NO IMMEDIATE VISUAL REDUCTION TO THE TATTOO.  The removal happens as your body slowly rids itself of the pigment. The laser breaks the pigment up enough that the body can deal with it. The laser does not blast the pigment away.  Every time this gif gets posted it's rife with misinformation in the comments.

Tattoos are effectively ultrafine needles that penetrate a layer of skin and deposit ink. Laser tattoo removal surgery breaks up the ink into small pellets (So that your body can break up the rest) by introducing it to vaporizing heat. Your body has plenty of insulating fat, and by holding the heat in, it causes some pretty bad damage to the skin and surrounding layers - Like radiation therapy, it destroys surrounding cells to break up the pigment."

BeAmazed,3cwsx6,hangerbaby,1 point,Sat Jul 11 18:10:28 2015 UTC,"Straight edge:       Straight edge (sometimes abbreviated sXe) is a subculture of hardcore punk whose adherents refrain from using alcohol, tobacco and other recreational drugs, in a reaction to the excesses of punk subculture.   For some, this extends to refraining from engaging in promiscuous sex, following a vegetarian or vegan diet, and/or not using caffeine or prescription drugs.  The term was adopted from the song ""Straight Edge"" by the hardcore punk band Minor Threat.   Straight edge emerged amid the mid-1980s hardcore punk scene. Since then, a wide variety of beliefs and ideas have been associated with some members of the movement, including vegetarianism and animal rights.   While the commonly expressed aspects of the straight edge subculture have been abstinence from alcohol, nicotine, and illegal drugs, there have been considerable variations on how far to take the interpretations of ""abstaining from intoxicants"" or ""living drug-free"". Disagreements often arise as to the primary reasons for living straight edge. Straight edge politics are primarily left-wing and revolutionary but there have been conservative offshoots.   In 1999, William Tsitsos wrote that straight edge had gone through three eras since its founding in the early 1980s.  Bent edge began as a counter-movement to straight edge by members of the Washington, D.C. hardcore scene who were frustrated by the rigidity and intolerance in the scene.  During the youth crew era, which started in the mid-1980s, the influence of music on the straight edge scene was at an all-time high. By the early 1990s, militant straight edge was a well-known part of the wider punk and DIY scene. In the early to mid-1990s, straight edge spread from the United States to Northern Europe,  Eastern Europe,  the Middle East,  and South America.  By the beginning of the 2000s, militant straight edge punks had largely left the broader straight edge culture and movement.

BeAmazed,3cwsx6,autowikibot,8,Sun Jul 12 00:40:38 2015 UTC,"Straight Edge used to be a legitimate faith in believing that drug abuse of any kind is immoral and disgusting and being promiscuous was also immoral in the underground music scene. Many people lived and died that way, but now it's a trend just as being vegan or vegetarian are and the whole gluten-free craze. Breaking edge was uncommon and often resulted in shunning of a person or something less extreme (as extreme as it gets.) Can someone more informed than I elaborate more on this subject?"

BeAmazed,3cwsx6,elastic-craptastic,7,Sat Jul 11 18:19:34 2015 UTC,"Yea I could def see a tattoo taking 30 sessions. When the tat gets blasted with the laser it really does disappear like that in the gif. But by the time you get home it will go back to looking like normal just really swollen. And then the next day it might even blister a bit but it's just raised and swollen but it looks just as dark as it did before. Over the next 6 weeks is when your body SLOWLY starts getting rid of the broken up ink. It ""fades"" slightly and itches like effffing crazy.  Then you're ready for your next session. Dark colors especially black are the quickest to fade. Colors like yellow green red and blues take longer. I don't know why lol. But yes, I could def see a large tat take 30 sessions. I'm about to have my 7th session and I would say it's about halfway faded. That's why I laugh when people get worried about keeping their tats out of the sun."

The laser is designed to destroy the pigment, so basically the ink stays but the color is gone.  The last I heard the jury was still out regarding weather this ink was any good for long term/lifetime. I'm guessing that's why this tattoo looks fresh or at least it's obviously not ""old""."

BeAmazed,3cwsx6,hadtoomuchtodream,29,Sat Jul 11 14:46:04 2015 UTC,"A lot.   There's a documentary on Netflix called Erasing Hate about an ex-white supremacist whose face and body were covered in tattoos, making it hard for him turn his life around. He eventually found a donor to pay to have the facial tattoos removed. The pain he goes through with each session is clearly excruciating."
BeAmazed,3cwsx6,ithinkimay,15,Sat Jul 11 16:40:49 2015 UTC,"It literally feels like getting splattered by bacon grease, in the same spot, over and over. It HURTS.   They give you numbing cream but in my experience, it was not worth it. The good thing about getting tattoos removed is it is a lot quicker than getting one. So even though it's excruciating, if the tattoo is relatively small, it's only 45 seconds of pain. It's a loooong 45 seconds though."
BeAmazed,3cwsx6,octowussy,2,Sat Jul 11 16:55:12 2015 UTC,"Their websites say that it feels like ""a snap from a rubber band"", but they don't tell you that rubber band is made out of hot grease.  My doctor was able to prescribe EMLA for me and it was a game-changer. You have to put it on a couple of hours beforehand and then keep it tightly covered in order for it to work, but it makes a huge difference. My removal was on my stomach and even though the first session only took about a minute, I had asked to take a break. After the EMLA, I could pretty much breeze through the remaining sessions without breaks."

BeAmazed,3cwsx6,JustBreatheN,5,Sat Jul 11 23:23:49 2015 UTC,"Depends on your laser and the treating facility. I've researched them in my area and the picosure laser, newer laser that is supposed to do well, costs about $350 per session. There is another laser similar to the picosure that is called QX Max and it is about $175 per session. They both focus on different colors. Picosure does well with blues and greens. QX Max does well with red. Both do well with black ink. Most black ink will be treated and mostly taken off by treatment number 7. The problem is you may have a ghost looking scar after. All that is, is the damaged pigment from the treatment. Hope this helps.   Edit: it also depends on how much ink they are treating. They charge per square inch of ink."

BeAmazed,3cwsx6,JustBreatheN,1 point,Sat Jul 11 16:18:48 2015 UTC,"Oh, I'll also add, between each treatment you wait 4-6 weeks. The body needs enough time to clean out what it can before the next treatment. So 7 treatments could take 7-9 months. Slow process but effective. Not everyone gets the ghost like scarring.

And with a special motorized adapter, its standard three finger gripper can be swapped out for one made entirely of Lego.

BeAmazed,3csixv,dunkelweiss,2,Fri Jul 10 23:03:02 2015 UTC,I believe each camera is recording video simultaneously and then they just take the same frame (or most similar frame) from each one when they're done.  At first I thought the guy filming had amazing timing or something.

BeAmazed,3c3qk6,Ghost_Animator,18,Sat Jul 4 14:01:35 2015 UTC,"the speed of light is the same through both of the mediums, correct?"
BeAmazed,3c3qk6,AtTheLeftThere,9,Sat Jul 4 14:57:16 2015 UTC,I'm going to be honest I had to look this up a bit because their explanation doesn't really describe what you're seeing. The index of refraction through several mediums is what's going on. You're going from air (gas) to glass (solid) to oil (liquid) to glass (solid) to oil (liquid) and all that again but in the reverse order. What I think is happening is a magnification of the shot glass in the middle similar to how if you have a hollow sphere filled with water you can put it up to objects to bend the light to magnify objects juxtaposed to the sphere with water. If you pay attention to the edge of the wine glass you can see a new edge forming right next to it on the inside and I believe that's the magnified edge of the shot glass inside and since it's so close to the edge of the wine glass it seems as if it completely disappeared.  Some n values for glass and cooking oil - vegetable. I'm sure different sources will show slightly different n values but you get the point.  Edit: I wanted to point out that everything has a different n value associated with Snell's Law. I didn't want to imply that only the medium or fluid have different associated values. In English I'm just trying to say that even though air and helium are different fluids of gas doesn't imply that their n values are going to be the same though they belong to the categorical medium of gasses.
BeAmazed,3c3qk6,foulrot,3,Sat Jul 4 18:40:22 2015 UTC,"It is a magnifying effect; the bubbles give it away. Right after the big bubble disappears to the left, another one forms on the right side; if you follow that bubble it will move to the top edge of the liquid and then you can see it in the shot glass, but it's size is much smaller than it looked in the wine glass."
BeAmazed,3c3qk6,AtTheLeftThere,22,Sat Jul 4 19:28:46 2015 UTC,Yes the refractive index of both the medium is same but you are a bit wrong. Here is the full explanation Edit - So here is a video explaining this phenomena  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wif_yGZcK18   (Explanation is in description)
BeAmazed,3c3qk6,puffdonut1,5,Sat Jul 4 15:06:22 2015 UTC,best use of this gif I think I've ever seen
BeAmazed,3c3qk6,le_renaissanceman,4,Sat Jul 4 15:08:28 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty late with a reply here, but you're right that the effect is due to the indices of refraction (and thus speed of light, as you said) being the same in both the glass and oil. I wanted to clarify though, because the magnification explanation given by the other replies to your comment aren't correct.   The amount of reflected light at an interface between two media is related to the mismatch of the two indices of refraction (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fresnel_equations). When the indices are the same, there's no reflection. The same phenomena applies to other types of waves as well. Anyway, normally you see the glass because of the light that reflects off of it. When it's submerged completely in oil that has the same index of refraction, there's no more reflection, and it seems to disappear."

BeAmazed,3c3qk6,Kapalka,2,Sat Jul 4 16:50:49 2015 UTC,"WHY THIS HAPPENS:- The real secret behind this science experiment is the index of refraction. When light travels through the glass, and then through the oil, the speed of light slows down and then it hits the glass and refracts or reflects and this is why the glass looks invisible."
BeAmazed,3c3qk6,EastCoast2300,2,Sat Jul 4 19:00:49 2015 UTC,"The thick liquid bends light the same amount as glass does (edit: coming from air), so there is no change in direction when the light goes from glass to oil or oil to glass. It also means that light doesn't reflect back at all (e.g. reflections on a glass in air). So you can't see the inner glass since there are no reflections and no bending of the light to give away its location."

BeAmazed,3bzknw,WIT_ARCH,3,Fri Jul 3 17:01:37 2015 UTC,"Essentially they're following the lead pilot. * The lead pilot flies the specific route for the routine in relation to the center point of the show runway). * The other pilots have specific points on the lead pilots aircraft and their aircraft.  They focus on matching these points while flying.    So in the video the first person pilot is trying to match his cockpit with either the wingtip of the plane to the right, or the midpoint between wingtips of the left and right planes.    If the lead pilot were to be doing a dive and not be able to recover (and not let the other pilots know) they would all crash.  IIRC there is a video out there somewhere where this happens.    EDIT: I found a link. Its the Thunderbirds, not the Blue Angels (as seen in the video) but they do the same thing but with different planes."
BeAmazed,3bzknw,GlassEyeLicker,3,Fri Jul 3 17:19:36 2015 UTC,"A shit ton of practice. They have only the lead pilot talking and giving out orders, as well as a ground spotting crew. They also get to pick the best of the best pilots to fly with. The cream of the cream of the crop. They also start out at ~30 feet with gear extended (much more forgiving if you bump another plane with a soft rubber tire than a stiff steel wing), and over weeks they tighten it up until  they get this great spectacle of a formation.👍👍 hope this helped"

BeAmazed,3bzb2z,Bwibb,4,Fri Jul 3 16:02:59 2015 UTC,Except he didn't really do a good job.. Murphy just made a stupid mistake and didn't keep his glove on the ground.

BeAmazed,3bzb2z,deadtree123,7,Fri Jul 3 15:50:25 2015 UTC,"That would only work if there was someone running to second base at the same time. He would have been ""forced"" out. Because that wasn't true the third basemen needed to tag him out with the ball."
BeAmazed,3bzb2z,IU_walawala,1 point,Fri Jul 3 17:02:06 2015 UTC,"Looks like there were runners on first and second base before the pitch. Does the 3rd basemen need to stand on the base to force an out, or can he brush it with his glove?"
BeAmazed,3bzb2z,Gigglestheclown,3,Fri Jul 3 17:48:52 2015 UTC,"I think what happened is that the batter swung and missed, which resulted in a strike. Meanwhile, the runner on second base tried to ""steal"" third base. Since the runner on first stayed on first, there was no runner going to second base, which means this wasn't a force out."
BeAmazed,3bzb2z,M_T_ToeShoes,7,Fri Jul 3 19:28:30 2015 UTC,"Actually, even if the runner on first also ran to second in this situation, there'd be no force out at third.  A force out only occurs when the batter becomes a runner.  Because both the runner at first and second (at time of the pitch) had the option to return back to their original base (since the batter did not become a baserunner), it is not a force out at third."

BeAmazed,3bzb2z,M_T_ToeShoes,3,Sat Jul 4 21:38:15 2015 UTC,You know I was so focused on what was happening at 3rd I didn't even realize that it was a strike until you just pointed that out.
BeAmazed,3bzb2z,Gigglestheclown,2,Fri Jul 3 20:42:41 2015 UTC,Actually after I read your question I realized I had done the same thing. It took me a few times rewatching to realize that the catcher threw it to third.
BeAmazed,3bzb2z,M_T_ToeShoes,1 point,Fri Jul 3 21:15:49 2015 UTC,Also touching the base with a glove is never required. Stepping on it does the same thing
BeAmazed,3bzb2z,EZOOC,1 point,Sun Jul 5 06:21:46 2015 UTC,"If the runner has the freedom to move between the bases, the force out doesn't exist. The runner on first base doesn't have to steal a base if the runner on second decides to. But even if they both stole, it still wouldn't be a force out because both runners can freely move between the bases. They just can't both be on the same base at the same time, they need to carefully coordinate their movements together."
BeAmazed,3bzb2z,ToTheRescues,1 point,Sun Jul 5 12:35:53 2015 UTC,could it be that it was just his arms momemtum that kept his hand moving.

BeAmazed,3bzb2z,Milkshakes00,-1,Fri Jul 3 21:49:43 2015 UTC,"That's what I was saying.. The stupid mistake is that he raised his glove because the running man started to retract his feet.  He reacted in a way that says 'If he pulls away his feet, he's going to be safe!' which is not the case. He would have had to keep sliding, and the feet would have ran into the glove regardless."

BeAmazed,3bp56p,HolyGhostofButtress,8,Wed Jul 1 10:10:29 2015 UTC,"There were a lot of things we couldn't do in an SR-71, but we were the fastest guys on the block and loved reminding our fellow aviators of this fact. People often asked us if, because of this fact, it was fun to fly the jet. Fun would not be the first word I would use to describe flying this plane. Intense, maybe. Even cerebral. But there was one day in our Sled experience when we would have to say that it was pure fun to be the fastest guys out there, at least for a moment.    It occurred when Walt and I were flying our final training sortie. We needed 100 hours in the jet to complete our training and attain Mission Ready status. Somewhere over Colorado we had passed the century mark. We had made the turn in Arizona and the jet was performing flawlessly. My gauges were wired in the front seat and we were starting to feel pretty good about ourselves, not only because we would soon be flying real missions but because we had gained a great deal of confidence in the plane in the past ten months. Ripping across the barren deserts 80,000 feet below us, I could already see the coast of California from the Arizona border. I was, finally, after many humbling months of simulators and study, ahead of the jet.    I was beginning to feel a bit sorry for Walter in the back seat. There he was, with no really good view of the incredible sights before us, tasked with monitoring four different radios. This was good practice for him for when we began flying real missions, when a priority transmission from headquarters could be vital. It had been difficult, too, for me to relinquish control of the radios, as during my entire flying career I had controlled my own transmissions. But it was part of the division of duties in this plane and I had adjusted to it. I still insisted on talking on the radio while we were on the ground, however. Walt was so good at many things, but he couldn't match my expertise at sounding smooth on the radios, a skill that had been honed sharply with years in fighter squadrons where the slightest radio miscue was grounds for beheading. He understood that and allowed me that luxury. Just to get a sense of what Walt had to contend with, I pulled the radio toggle switches and monitored the frequencies along with him. The predominant radio chatter was from Los Angeles Center, far below us, controlling daily traffic in their sector. While they had us on their scope (albeit briefly), we were in uncontrolled airspace and normally would not talk to them unless we needed to descend into their airspace.    We listened as the shaky voice of a lone Cessna pilot asked Center for a readout of his ground speed. Center replied: ""November Charlie 175, I'm showing you at ninety knots on the ground.""    Now the thing to understand about Center controllers, was that whether they were talking to a rookie pilot in a Cessna, or to Air Force One, they always spoke in the exact same, calm, deep, professional, tone that made one feel important. I referred to it as the "" Houston Center voice."" I have always felt that after years of seeing documentaries on this country's space program and listening to the calm and distinct voice of the Houston controllers, that all other controllers since then wanted to sound like that, and that they basically did. And it didn't matter what sector of the country we would be flying in, it always seemed like the same guy was talking. Over the years that tone of voice had become somewhat of a comforting sound to pilots everywhere. Conversely, over the years, pilots always wanted to ensure that, when transmitting, they sounded like Chuck Yeager, or at least like John Wayne. Better to die than sound bad on the radios.    Just moments after the Cessna's inquiry, a Twin Beech piped up on frequency, in a rather superior tone, asking for his ground speed. ""I have you at one hundred and twenty-five knots of ground speed."" Boy, I thought, the Beechcraft really must think he is dazzling his Cessna brethren. Then out of the blue, a navy F-18 pilot out of NAS Lemoore came up on frequency. You knew right away it was a Navy jock because he sounded very cool on the radios. ""Center, Dusty 52 ground speed check"". Before Center could reply, I'm thinking to myself, hey, Dusty 52 has a ground speed indicator in that million-dollar cockpit, so why is he asking Center for a readout? Then I got it, ol' Dusty here is making sure that every bug smasher from Mount Whitney to the Mojave knows what true speed is. He's the fastest dude in the valley today, and he just wants everyone to know how much fun he is having in his new Hornet. And the reply, always with that same, calm, voice, with more distinct alliteration than emotion: ""Dusty 52, Center, we have you at 620 on the ground.""    And I thought to myself, is this a ripe situation, or what? As my hand instinctively reached for the mic button, I had to remind myself that Walt was in control of the radios. Still, I thought, it must be done - in mere seconds we'll be out of the sector and the opportunity will be lost. That Hornet must die, and die now. I thought about all of our Sim training and how important it was that we developed well as a crew and knew that to jump in on the radios now would destroy the integrity of all that we had worked toward becoming. I was torn.    Somewhere, 13 miles above Arizona, there was a pilot screaming inside his space helmet. Then, I heard it. The click of the mic button from the back seat. That was the very moment that I knew Walter and I had become a crew. Very professionally, and with no emotion, Walter spoke: ""Los Angeles Center, Aspen 20, can you give us a ground speed check?"" There was no hesitation, and the replay came as if was an everyday request. ""Aspen 20, I show you at one thousand eight hundred and forty-two knots, across the ground.""    I think it was the forty-two knots that I liked the best, so accurate and proud was Center to deliver that information without hesitation, and you just knew he was smiling. But the precise point at which I knew that Walt and I were going to be really good friends for a long time was when he keyed the mic once again to say, in his most fighter-pilot-like voice: ""Ah, Center, much thanks, we're showing closer to nineteen hundred on the money.""    For a moment Walter was a god. And we finally heard a little crack in the armor of the Houston Center voice, when L.A.came back with, ""Roger that Aspen, Your equipment is probably more accurate than ours. You boys have a good one.""    It all had lasted for just moments, but in that short, memorable sprint across the southwest, the Navy had been flamed, all mortal airplanes on freq were forced to bow before the King of Speed, and more importantly, Walter and I had crossed the threshold of being a crew. A fine day's work. We never heard another transmission on that frequency all the way to the coast.    For just one day, it truly was fun being the fastest guys out there."

He said his dad had great stories.  The one that sticks out in my mind is that when the plane was fully fueled and taxiing, it was leaking fuel like crazy from the fuselage.  The panels on the plane were manufactured such that they would only fit tightly together when the air frame expanded when heated up from friction.

BeAmazed,3bk7kn,fireforfear,7,Tue Jun 30 02:30:14 2015 UTC,Yes and yes
BeAmazed,3bk7kn,kevinxb,17,Tue Jun 30 02:54:55 2015 UTC,"Indeed. Brakes convert kinetic energy primarily to heat energy. You can actually see glowing brakes on a lot of racing cars. When you see the metal glowing like this; it usually means something called ""brake fade"" is happening. The brakes decrease in effectiveness because there's less kinetic energy being converted into heat energy; the metal is basically saturated with heat at this point. You often hear of ""carbon-ceramic brakes"" which are designed to minimize fade by increasing the amount of heat energy it can keep. Cooling systems are also employed in a lot of cars, often you see big tubes going to the brakes or vents in the front of the car which lead directly to the wheelwells. These are for cooling the brakes almost exclusively. Additionally brakes often have holes in them like this that serve to increase surface area for cooling in addition to allowing surface area inside the brakes to be cooled by outside air. All of this is to reduce that braking glow you see, but it still obviously is there. It is quite cool, though to see glowing brakes in the middle of the night like at the 24h of lemans!"
BeAmazed,3bk7kn,ArchmageNydia,6,Tue Jun 30 02:58:03 2015 UTC,"Wow. Thanks for the explanation! Absolutely amazing.  Do you think they'll ever reach the limits of this setup and have to develop some different type of braking system? Something that doesn't use slipping friction, maybe recapturing that energy into induction using electromagnetism? I don't know what that's called exactly, but I've heard they use something like that in hybrids?  Maybe whatever impels monorails, to slow the wheels to a halt? I guess it would be electromagnetic braking."
BeAmazed,3bk7kn,fireforfear,5,Tue Jun 30 03:33:51 2015 UTC,Yes actually. They are already racing hybrid and electric cars which use the braking energy to return some power to the battery of the vehicle. It's called Regenerative braking and is already in use in several civilian hybrid and electric cars.   FIA Formula One and Formula E both use it.
BeAmazed,3bk7kn,HandBanaba,1 point,Tue Jun 30 03:48:59 2015 UTC,"Section 10. FIA of article  Regenerative brake:       Formula One have stated that they support responsible solutions to the world's environmental challenges,  and the FIA allowed the use of 81 hp (60 kW; 82 PS) KERS in the regulations for the 2009 Formula One season.  Teams began testing systems in 2008: energy can either be stored as mechanical energy (as in a flywheel) or as electrical energy (as in a battery or supercapacitor).   With the introduction of KERS in the 2009 season, only four teams used it at some point in the season: Ferrari, Renault, BMW, and McLaren. Eventually, during the season, Renault and BMW stopped using the system. Vodafone McLaren Mercedes became the first team to win a F1 GP using a KERS equipped car when Lewis Hamilton won the Hungarian Grand Prix on 26 July 2009. Their second KERS equipped car finished fifth. At the following race, Lewis Hamilton became the first driver to take pole position with a KERS car, his team mate, Heikki Kovalainen qualifying second. This was also the first instance of an all KERS front row. On 30 August 2009, Kimi Räikkönen won the Belgian Grand Prix with his KERS equipped Ferrari. It was the first time that KERS contributed directly to a race victory, with second placed Giancarlo Fisichella claiming ""Actually, I was quicker than Kimi. He only took me because of KERS at the beginning"".   Although KERS was still legal in F1 in the 2010 season, all the teams had agreed not to use it.  New rules for the 2011 F1 season which raised the minimum weight limit of the car and driver by 20 kg to 640 kg,  along with the FOTA teams agreeing to the use of KERS devices once more, meant that KERS returned for the 2011 season.  This is still optional as it was in the 2009 season; in the 2011 season 3 teams elected not to use it.  For the 2012 season, only Marussia and HRT raced without KERS, and by 2013, with the withdrawal of HRT, all 11 teams on the grid were running KERS.

BeAmazed,3bk7kn,autowikibot,1 point,Tue Jun 30 03:49:47 2015 UTC,Regenerative braking is more for keeping all the energy you can to finish the race then it is for brake quality because current batteries are really shit when compared to traditional chemical power storage(gasoline).
BeAmazed,3bk7kn,meltingdiamond,-6,Sat Jul 4 08:21:50 2015 UTC,"Glowing brakes do not indicate brake fade.   Edit: sorry reddit, they don't. If they indicated brake fade then no race car would ever be able to finish a race. Some brakes don't even start working properly until they get up to temperatures like this. It's amazing just how many people think they have a clue what they are talking about. Glowing brakes indicate heat and heat does not indicate fade. Uncontrolled heat leads to fade, these cars don't have uncontrolled heat problems simply because they glow. They are glowing because they are turning energy into heat as this poster said, but simply have hot rotors does not mean they are fading. These cars, all racecars, generate heat to cause the rotors to glow but they do so in a controlled manner. Saying they are fading because they are this hot is incorrect. If it were true then that would mean literally every time they get this hot performance would significantly degrade and that's not what is happening here. They can and do heat like this for races that last 24 hours like in Le Mans. The reason they change the brake pads and rotors in that race is due to loss of friction material. This is not brake fade, the poster above is wrong with that statement.   Here is a good explanation of brake fade and ways it is prevented. Glowing rotors do not indicate fade."

BeAmazed,3bk7kn,TagSmile,9,Tue Jun 30 00:48:35 2015 UTC,"Front brakes are often more powerful than rear brakes, even on everyday cars. You can see this if you look at your car's brake discs; the front's will be much bigger. In addition, you can adjust something called Brake Bias which changes how much brake you get at the front vs. the back. Different situations need different biases, but in general a front bias is normally used; it prevents oversteer when you're braking into a corner as well as being a prevention method when you're going faster; Just brake and your car will usually stop sliding around with a front brake bias."
BeAmazed,3bk7kn,ArchmageNydia,5,Tue Jun 30 00:54:54 2015 UTC,"I guess ideally you would have automatic realtime biasing based on turn radius or something like that. Although, I guess ideally, you wouldn't have a human driving at all. :P  I guess you would need a brake pedal that you could rotate or tilt your foot to adjust brake bias, and use a clutch-less transmission so you wouldn't need to heal toe...but that probably wont happen."

BeAmazed,3b3fnr,NEVERDOUBTED,2,Fri Jun 26 04:44:51 2015 UTC,It's pretty expensive. $60 for 2 minutes of flight time.
BeAmazed,3b3fnr,Chimpee,5,Fri Jun 26 18:59:23 2015 UTC,"If you were to study a video of them like this and mimic their body posisitions doing it for the first time, would it make it easy?"
BeAmazed,3b3fnr,PM_Me_OK,6,Fri Jun 26 00:00:28 2015 UTC,"Not at all. It's a lot harder than it looks. These guys have had TONS of training and most likely work there. Perhaps that would work if you have prior skydiving experience? Regardless, it's a lot of fun even just going in it and floating without doing a bunch of tricks and I would definitely recommend. It can be pretty expensive though especially if you want training to be as good as these guys (I think this can vary a lot so don't take my word for it)."
BeAmazed,3b3fnr,Imfinalyhere,16,Fri Jun 26 08:01:18 2015 UTC,"These are the instructors for indoor skydiving places. It's super hard to do this stuff and these guys definitely practice a bunch! Not as expensive as you might think! $50 dollars gets you 2, one minute flights. Which seems ridiculously short but it's actually plenty and worth it! Average free fall time of an actual skydive is less than a minute anyway, which was an interesting fact I found out."

BeAmazed,3atn9d,Kaeliss,5,Wed Jun 24 08:35:06 2015 UTC,"I did my chemistry coursework on this reaction :/.  What happens (at least in the version I used) is that the reaction mixture in the flask contains hydrogen peroxide, potassium iodide, sodium thiosulphate and starch.  When all of these solutions are mixed, the hydrogen peroxide reacts with the potassium iodide to produce iodine- so if the sodium thiosulphate was not present, the mixture would turn black almost immediately.  However, sodium thiosulphate reacts very quickly with the iodine produced, and turns it back into iodide ions to prevent the colour change.  Therefore, the solution only turns black when all of the sodium thiosulphate has reacted, or been 'used up'.  Hope that's clear :)"

BeAmazed,3ajxbt,HoodieGalore,2,Sun Jun 21 04:09:19 2015 UTC,"Ice calving:       Ice calving, also known as glacier calving or iceberg calving, is the breaking off of chunks of ice at the edge of a glacier.  It is a form of ice ablation or ice disruption. It is the sudden release and breaking away of a mass of ice from a glacier, iceberg, ice front, ice shelf, or crevasse. The ice that breaks away can be classified as an iceberg, but may also be a growler, bergy bit, or a crevasse wall breakaway.   Calving of glaciers is often accompanied by a loud cracking or booming sound  before blocks of ice up to 60 metres (200 ft) high break loose and crash into the water. The entry of the ice into the water causes large, and often hazardous waves.  The waves formed in locations like Johns Hopkins Glacier can be so large that boats cannot approach closer than 3 kilometres (1.9 mi). These events have become major tourist attractions in locations such as Alaska.  Many glaciers terminate at oceans or freshwater lakes which results naturally  with the calving of large numbers of icebergs. Calving of Greenland's glaciers produce 12,000 to 15,000 icebergs each year alone.

The machine was rather difficult to operate.  For years radios had been operated by means of pressing buttons and turning dials; then as the technology became more sophisticated the controls were made touch-sensitive -- you merely had to brush the panels with your fingers; now all you had to do was wave your hand in the general direction of the components and hope. It saved a lot of muscular  expenditure, of course, but meant that you had to sit infuriatingly still if you wanted to keep listening to the same program.   -Douglas Adams"

Anyone care to try and CMV that this would be totally pointless, and that the design/manufacturing time/energy/$ spent developing this novelty would be better spent on any one of the panoply of crises currently on humanity's plate?  It seems frustratingly like an attempt to capitalize off of tech glitz that's sure to make people shit their pants and fork over their wallets, but that neither brings any new functionality to the table, nor streamlines existing processes in any real way. Also smacks of trying to make things aesthetically reflect all of our culture's sci-fi fantasies just because. Seems childish af to me."
BeAmazed,3ae8d4,lunarcurtain,2,Fri Jun 19 18:01:46 2015 UTC,"Same thing can be said about a lot of tech stuff. I used to work at a hospital and I manned a project to bring new tech into operating rooms. I spent the better half of a month calling around just to track a single man in Canada down (I'm in United States) to get more info about this tech he was building. What tech you say? Using the Microsoft Kinect.   Something harnessed for games in the living room aimed towards children was being used to allow surgeons to do handless manipulation of scans. What this means is, if you are being worked on your bill will be smaller, less chances for you to get an infection and quicker in and out. It takes a surgeon at minimum 20 minutes to scrub down to work on you. The depth of field tech which Microsoft has created in conjuction with hand recognition software makes it possible to cut out the long rescrub process just because they needed to check a scan on your procedure.

BeAmazed,3ae8d4,lunarcurtain,2,Fri Jun 19 19:51:37 2015 UTC,"I dig that humanity and technology are about continuous improvement and innovation, and that sometimes you need to innovate just because you're interested in a question, not knowing what uses your efforts might eventually have.  Certainly working on this isn't going to pull anyone who's pursuing anything else away from their efforts. I'm not even trying to argue that Google should just stop working on this. But we have a team capable of developing this, working for one of the most influential companies in the world, and it all seems to amount to nothing more than cash in their future pockets; because it doesn't seem to be any more useable than knobs and buttons - it seems like it would lack the satisfying tactility of physical interfaces and be prone to problems and such. It seems like it might be less functional. Is it contributing anything more than initial cool factor?  The thing that seems annoying about it to me isn't that it's a waste of time to develop, but if the main way this technology is going to be implemented is to add a superficial impressiveness to consumer products and rake in a bunch of cash, what's the point?  What I'm mainly curious about is whether anyone knows if this technology will be somehow easier to operate, more reliable, less prone to malfunction, easier to repair, less disposable, less expensive and wasteful (for constructive reasons) to produce etc. than mechanical and touch screen interfaces?  It's not about wasting time per se, it's about doing the most good, wasting less, and making progress within a particular context."

Perhaps this sort of thing is in development too? I like the way you think.  It's interesting though that what Google is mainly showing us is how this tech can Jetsonify consumer products and make them cooler. I'm still not convinced on that level. In fact I think I actively do not want this on my watch, music device, etc. ever, and am already bored with that moment when I see a cool dude out and about adjusting his coolguy Google theramin status symbol novelty watch...

The arts concern a different facet of our experience from technology, the specialization that goes into each is much different, etc. I don't really see this as being about wasting time. I'm thinking about it as a question of using resources in the most effective possible ways within each unique context, and that means something much different in technological development than in the arts.

If you've ever tried to use a smart watch, you'd realize that poking at a tiny screen (or turning the little wheel thing on the apple watch) is a pretty terrible user experience.  The screen size compared to the size of your fingertip is pretty small, so differentiating between touches intended for different parts of the screen is pretty difficult.  Moreover, you can't even really see what you're tapping on because your finger covers up most of the screen.  Having this kind of fine-tuned interaction that's decoupled from the actual screen is HUGE.  It may or may not ultimately become ubiquitous in regard to user interaction with wearable tech, but it's definitely a step in the right direction and totally worth exploring."

BeAmazed,3ab7az,Ramsfield,32,Thu Jun 18 18:35:08 2015 UTC,"It's basically a dry ice bomb suspended underwater but that's not the interesting part. As with any explosion underwater, the expanding gas would be stopped eventually by the hydrostatic pressure, then contract inward because of the low pressure in the explosion cavity caused by the expansion. And because of the mass of the water pressing inward there is a second high pressure expansion, then a third, then a fourth etc etc until the energy of the original explosion is used up.  I'm not a physics major so I suck at the terminology and can't be as precise but this is baiscally what it is.  Here's a neat retro video explaining the phenomenon.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPJjMJ48CdY"

BeAmazed,3ab7az,electrodraco,4,Fri Jun 19 11:29:43 2015 UTC,I don't get it. Is the dry ice in the bottle? Is that an entire pool of liquid nitrogen? What's in the box thing at the bottom?
BeAmazed,3ab7az,Technojerk36,6,Thu Jun 18 21:13:24 2015 UTC,"I think the liquid nitrogen was used to supercool the dry ice so you'd get a much bigger reaction, an explosive one in this case. I think the pad at the bottom is a pressure pad to measure the force of the explosion underwater. It would be massive though! Water is about 300 times denser than air, also water is extremely hard to compress whereas air can be compressed pretty easy. Barring things like shrapnel, you're much more likely to be killed by an explosion underwater than one in air just because of the pressure you experience.  As far as I can tell they put the supercooled dry ice in a bottle, put the bottle under water and waited until some of the dry ice turned into gas until the pressure inside the bottle was enough to burst it and let the water in. Then explosion."

BeAmazed,3a5srq,DrDeth666,16,Thu Jun 18 00:02:56 2015 UTC,"Unless I'm missing something I don't think this would work properly. The Key you press is associated with a striking arm that hits the ribbon which contains the ink and presses that ink into the page. In this picture we see that the striking arm and the ribbon both have a rainbow of colors, so the arm would hit the ribbon, putting color on the ribbon.  The ribbon doesn't move on a typewriter based on which key is hit, so a rainbow of color on the ribbon just doesn't make sense."
BeAmazed,3a5srq,Ratonhnhaketon,1 point,Wed Jun 17 17:01:41 2015 UTC,There is a possibility that the ribbon is being colored by the striking arms and it is just set in to loop in circles. That would at least explain why the ribbon has coloring in areas that have not yet been used. However if this was legitimate I would imagine it being a lot messier.

BeAmazed,39zbqs,Ghost_Animator,22,Tue Jun 16 00:31:07 2015 UTC,This still blows my mind. Like how does this work?
BeAmazed,39zbqs,Waitwhatsausername,16,Tue Jun 16 04:07:37 2015 UTC,"ELI5 from 2012.  edit: about the electrical part, the first answer points to something very interesting: the transducer that turns mechanical signals into electrical signals (""reading"" the contents of the vinyl through the movement of the needle) operates under the same principle as the transducer that turns electrical into mechanical signals (the voice coil of the loudspeaker), but in reverse.  So what really happens is: the movement of the needle is transformed into an electrical currents (or two in the case of stereo) and this current is transformed into movement at the voice coil.  But the more interesting answer is a bit below, from a [deleted]:   the needle is an actual needle (a pointed metal object) and the record has really really really thin grooves in it. When you run the needle across these grooves, the sound of the needle scratching the grooves literally makes the music. It's the same idea as when you scratch your fingernail across a couch, except really focused and precise. The stereo simply makes it louder.  If you want confirmation, play a record, turn the stereo off, and put your ear next to the needle."
BeAmazed,39zbqs,protestor,4,Tue Jun 16 05:23:33 2015 UTC,This STILL blows mind.  Like a cd or mp3 is easier for me to conceptualize.
BeAmazed,39zbqs,A_complete_idiot,-8,Tue Jun 16 11:33:24 2015 UTC,"Since a cd is just zeros and ones, it loses all the nuances and warmth.   Any audiophile will tell you they have a record player in their setup and thats what they use the most. Most major albums are still created in vinyl because its a better medium for music.  The closest thing in digital format these days is .FLAC because its lossless audio, but it still lacks to nuance of vinyl.   Go to best buy and have them set up the record player in their high end area. Itll blow your mind!"
BeAmazed,39zbqs,akilyoung,1 point,Tue Jun 16 13:42:29 2015 UTC,"it loses all the nuances and warmth   ELI5 please, what is in the vinyl recording that isn't in the digital? I've been messing with records recently and can't hear any differences.   Most major albums are still created in vinyl because its a better medium for music   Could you source that, I heard the direct opposite - that music is mostly mastered in digital and when it is released on vinyl it's converted from digital to analog."
BeAmazed,39zbqs,ImSpurticus,-1,Tue Jun 16 16:03:14 2015 UTC,"1- If you cant answer that, I cant tell you. With a proper high end stereo system, theres quite a difference. If you cant hear it, or think it sounds worse than digital audio, you arent an audiophile. Thats fine though, lots of people arent.  2-I should clarify, yes in some regard youre right. Some studios record exclusively in digital, some in analog, some in hybrid (usually using VHS tapes believe it or not)/ All formats can be turned into quality vinyl, but analog from the start is the best.  There are great digital tool that we use to add analog warmth to a track, they help pretty decent, but theres still a big difference.  Understand that studios usually record tracks at ultra high sample rates usually around 88.2. With a clean master at those rates, a studio can 'bounce down' to a vinyl, whereas you cannot do that with an mp3 or anything as remotely as compressed as that.  When it comes to some non-linear audio processors like a super-fast compressor, a saturator, a super-high-frequency EQ, or a vintage synthesizer emulation, oversampling can be a major benefit."

BeAmazed,39zbqs,akilyoung,2,Tue Jun 16 13:43:10 2015 UTC,"As a song writer and producer I dont get how this makes sound. I know how a record player works but I didnt know it moves side to side like that, I always thought the bumps were up and down. When I record, the sound waves oscillate (graphically) up and down, but its amazing how a needle moving side to side creates enough sound to be amplified and heard. And such sweet sound it is, theres nothing like analog vinyl. Its mind boggling how the needle stays in that groove without popping out."
BeAmazed,39zbqs,akilyoung,1 point,Tue Jun 16 13:35:54 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure but it might have something to do with the fact that sound waves in reality don't move in that up and down sinusoidal pattern.  They move longitudinally instead, like stretching a slinky and firing a compression down it."
BeAmazed,39zbqs,TypewriterQueery,1 point,Tue Jun 16 16:48:02 2015 UTC,"A bit late, but essentially each channel is one side of the groove.

And i bet the do it likeone or two nights a month, and have multiple sets of diners that night, since it is only for an hour.  My wife and I got a five course meal at one of the best places in town for less than $300, so $289 a head doesn't sound cheap."

If they do 3 nights a week for 6 months (not all months are suitably for this), that's $1.5M in revenue. That is not a lot for an upscale ""restaurant"". Add in a likely high insurance premium and the exclusivity premium, $289 seems reasonable to me. Still not for me but I would have expected it to be gold flake, truffle, and beluga pizza expensive."

BeAmazed,39g5o6,AyeAyeLtd,9,Thu Jun 11 18:38:31 2015 UTC,There may not be any such thing as a perfect square wave in the real world. Perhaps the energy shifts within electron shells would happen in near zero time and thus we would get a signal rise rate of infinity because a quantum value can not be fractional and thus is never at a level other than integral. That would be a perfect square wave style signal. Nothing else physical can move in zero time and produce a square wave signal. Just my thoughts.  edit: yes I majored in physics and then did post grad in signal processing and materials physics.

BeAmazed,39g5o6,aboldmove,2,Fri Jun 12 00:16:32 2015 UTC,"Fourier Analysis is used to decompose a signal into a sum of sine/cosine waves with different frequencies and amplitudes. You can use this to analyze and modify the signal.   For example, if the amplitude of the low frequency waves in the signal is high, that means the signal has some larger-scale changes going on. If the high-frequency amplitudes are high, some small-scale stuff is going on. A signal that is composed of low frequency parts will be smooth, while a signal with high frequency parts will be jaggy or noisy. To form a sharp corner like in the GIF, you need a combination of an infinite number of low- and high frequency parts. Since that's not possible, you see the residual error as small waves at the edges.  What can you use it for:   Measure a sound wave and see how much bass (low frequency) or treble (high frequency) there is, and modify these amounts. This is what the equalizer in your music player/sound system does. Measure a light source and find out what colors of light (wavelengths) are in it. This can be used for example to determine what chemical compounds are burned in a flame, and is probably also used in determining the composition of stars (this is just speculation). Smooth an image. The GIF shows a Fourier Transformation of a 1D signal, but it also works for 2D, 3D and so on. You can smooth an image by reducing the high-frequency (fast-changing) parts of the signal, while keeping the low frequency parts (this is therefore sometimes called a low-pass filter, because only low frequencies pass through it). The nice thing about this is that doing such a filtering operation on a signal that has been Fourier-Transformed is much faster than doing it on the original signal. If you want to do repeated filtering of a signal, it might pay off to transform it to Fourier space first, then do all of the operations there, then transform it back.    There are much much more applications for Fourier analysis, but these might give you some idea why it is useful."

And I don't know the difference in the balls' weight, texture, speed, etc relative to a hard hit straight foul shot. Just because many people can do something after training themselves for years to do so, that doesn't make it unimpressive. The reason the original post is notably cool is because this guy is a spectator, likely untrained and extremely likely not a cricket player. The ball coming right to him isn't very likely, but he rises to the occasion not with a glove, not even with two hands, but grabs it from the air one-handed without issue.

BeAmazed,390uzs,belnc,2,Tue Jun 9 12:28:37 2015 UTC,The only problem with that is that those tabs are then shading other windows while reflecting light into some.
BeAmazed,390uzs,GratefullyGodless,1 point,Tue Jun 9 14:10:36 2015 UTC,"True, but they'll only completely block a window for a short period of time per day. And you'll notice that the tabs are reflecting into larger windows, likely windows into large common spaces, and the smaller windows are likely bedrooms or even bathrooms, maybe a kitchen. I'm on mobile right now otherwise I'd look more into it. So you're right, it may not be ideal but I think it's a cool way to keep more light in the shared spaces throughout the day."
BeAmazed,390uzs,belnc,1 point,Tue Jun 9 14:39:10 2015 UTC,"Probably for shading, but interestingly they aren't shading much. Maybe the contractor installed them on the wrong sides of the balconies. They might just be screens that can fold in to cover the balconies, too."

BeAmazed,38dpf0,JLSMC,27,Wed Jun 3 23:14:49 2015 UTC,"I live in Surrey BC Canada. For those unfamiliar just think a large city across a broad river from Vancouver. Now, in Surrey there happens to be a very large East Indian population. One day, at highschool, maybe fifteen years ago, I observed an incredible feat...   From my second story vantage point on the second floor of the school  there was heard a great commotion. Directly across the street from our open windows was a house in the process of being built. An enraged argument. All the students (and the teacher) in the class pressed against the long windows to see two home-builders of Indian descent raging on one another. This is where it gets interesting...  One of the two men, both clearly on top of their physiques, raised a framing hammer (a big fucking hammer but not a sledge hammer) with both hands above his head, posed to strike the other man down. The second man drew a machete, and held it at his side seemingly to counter the coming blow. But this Sikh man... A third party on happenstance had been walking peacefully down the sidewalk. He must have been sixty years old, in a white robe (I apologize, I do not know the proper name of the garment) with a ceremonial dagger hanging from his side. This man was a large man. One whose 6'4""ish stature had been diminished by his age only in girth. I would like you all to think about that moment in the first Lord of the Rings movie when Gandalf flexes his might and Bilbo is suddenly aware of his friend's ability. Now I won't lie to you, the dagger was never even touched.  The man with the machete however thinks he has the upper hand and suddenly raises his weapon to striking pose. He swings it, but something impedes his blow. The passing Sikh Gentleman catches the blade in his palm before it can reach that murderous velocity and he is  quickly bleeding heavily cor his troubles.  Now I swear to you, this Sikh saviour didn't so much as flinch. If I were close enough to have seen his eyes, I would not have seen them blink... He held the man's now powerless weapon, and calmly, in a dialect which I could not understand, uttered a three second lecture, wagged impressively his finger at the man whose machete had been immobilized, and we watched the angered man PLACE his machete to the sidewalk. Well, the man with the hammer had a child-like tantrum.  He began smashing his own hammer down onto the sidewalk high both hands, stuck the pavement exactly three times. The wise Sikh turns around, points at the man, then points the school, then points at the sidewalk and slowly advances toward him. The man holding the hammer proceeds to almost bow as he tenderly and with both hands relinquishes his hammer to the sidewalk while facing the stern glare of the once merely passing Sikh's eye.  The Sikh gentleman had the two shake hands, perhaps a custom he had felt necessary for the oggling students, and proceeded to slowly and peacefully walk on down the road without even looking at his profusely bleeding hand.   The police arrived shortly thereafter but I'm not sure what happened to the aggressors. However, with many witnesses on hand, the gentleman was recognized by a student no less, and wasset to receive a city commendation (months down the road). He, of course, was naturally declined.  TL;DR: Sikh man catches machete strike bare-handed and diffuses a terrible situation, then refuses award by city. Respect people like him and their respective communities."

BeAmazed,3823hx,jerbookins,22,Mon Jun 1 11:54:01 2015 UTC,"I went into it with no expectations. I only watched the first trailer but it gave be goose bumps. I thought it looked really exciting. I was pleasantly surprised to see that 99% of the footage from the trailer was in the first ten minutes of the film, not one of those trailers that gives everything away.  I was basically high off the movie for two days and it was all i could think about. From the music to the cars to the non-stop action i fell in love. The car design in particular whet my whistle, they're so bad ass looking. I'm still really excited about it and want to see it again.  Afterward, i learned that pretty much the only cgi used in the movie was for environmental effects like weather. All the cars were real, all the shit they built had to work, and if it blew up it was a real explosion. That alone is such a huge deal for me with movies these days over using cg.  It's not my favorite movie ever, and the plot is thin, but they don't hold your hand and explain everything to you about the world. They dip you chrome and strap you in for the ride. And what a fucking ride it is."
BeAmazed,3823hx,LordKwik,2,Mon Jun 1 12:49:02 2015 UTC,"That about describes how I felt about John Wick. Plot was thin, but that didn't stop the movie from replaying in my head for a few days. The choreography was great (unlike a lot of movies these days where somebody hits the other guy and the camera changes, then another hit and a camera change. Freaking changes every .5 seconds and I have no idea what's going on.)  As events early on in the movie occurred I found myself saying out loud, who the fuck is John Wick. Its one of those movies you don't want to turn away from while you're watching it.  But yeah, I should probably go see Mad Max."

BeAmazed,37tem5,Ghost_Animator,29,Sat May 30 06:15:50 2015 UTC,"This is a SawStop. The scene shop at my school has one and it is amazing (most of the time). It works by sensing conductivity, so when skin touches it, it senses it then triggers the blade and drops the saw. This can sometimes get annoying when there is a random staple in your lumber or sometimes paint even sets it off (although you can bypass the brake for this stuff). And it is LOUD when it goes off. The scene shop manager has a chain full of brakes that have been tripped, we are up to 8 brakes in the past 10 years. This thing has saved 8 fingers.  Edit: source. The inventor of the SawStop demonstrates it, first with a sausage, then with his own finger."
BeAmazed,37tem5,urbanbumfights,8,Sat May 30 08:50:29 2015 UTC,That is incredible.
BeAmazed,37tem5,gee1973,6,Sat May 30 12:56:23 2015 UTC,When you say you are up to 8 brakes do you mean that the brake is destroyed when it is tripped and it can't be used again? Or am I misunderstanding altogether?
BeAmazed,37tem5,Loves2Poo,9,Sat May 30 15:03:43 2015 UTC,"It means the saw has dropped 8 times and they've had to replace it ($60) 8 times. Course losing a finger is way more than that.

There may be some that are better ( I am not a wood worker), but the sawstop saws are well engineered and highly functional.  Luckily he has not had to use the 'stop' part of sawstop.  Though he does keep and extra  brake and blade in the garage."
BeAmazed,37tem5,miices,6,Sat May 30 06:56:13 2015 UTC,"how come he has the spare brake and blade? when it senses a voltage change (eg hits a sausage / finger / penis) does it do something irreversible to the brake? from what i'v seen of this (on the inventor's youtube and other media, not in real life) it works in a similar way to those touch lamps  i have children. seriously considering getting one of these."
BeAmazed,37tem5,thesuperevilclown,9,Sat May 30 12:14:30 2015 UTC,"Yes, the brake is a block of aluminum that the blade is embedded into.

BeAmazed,37tem5,Tralan,9,Sat May 30 08:26:24 2015 UTC,"Because I like knowing how things work too.    SawStop Saws Detect Contact With Skin. The blade carries a small electrical signal, which the safety system continually monitors. When skin contacts the blade, the signal changes because the human body is conductive. The change to the signal activates the safety system.    So you will get cut but, yeah."

BeAmazed,37tem5,Tralan,3,Sat May 30 08:57:35 2015 UTC,"It works a lot like touch screens on a phone.  If you touch it, the capacitance changes and the solenoid fires to bring the brake to the blade."
BeAmazed,37tem5,miices,5,Sat May 30 15:04:00 2015 UTC,This kills the blade.
BeAmazed,37tem5,tr41t0r,8,Sat May 30 12:33:24 2015 UTC,It does.  I'd be pissed if I had to replace the blade and brake because I forgot to remove all hotdogs from my material again.  You probably remember to after a few though.
BeAmazed,37tem5,djdes,2,Sat May 30 13:18:22 2015 UTC,"Most expensive hotdog slicer ever.  Fortunately, you can purchase pre-separated hotdogs nowadays."
BeAmazed,37tem5,yParticle,5,Sat May 30 16:37:31 2015 UTC,Does this work even if your hand is moving very quickly? Obviously you shouldn't be doing that around a blade but just curious if the hotdog would have been sliced if it was moving at 3-4 times the speed in the video.
BeAmazed,37tem5,Loves2Poo,10,Sat May 30 15:07:00 2015 UTC,This mechanism stops and retracts the saw blade in 5 milliseconds. :)
BeAmazed,37tem5,yParticle,8,Sat May 30 15:10:06 2015 UTC,what does that translate to in blade revolutions?
BeAmazed,37tem5,hawken50,31,Sat May 30 16:38:45 2015 UTC,"A 10"" table saw goes about 3500rpm.  3500/60 = roughly 60rps.  60x0.005sec = .3 rotations from activation to stoppage.  That translates to roughtly 9"" of blade hitting your finger.  That seems like a lot, until you look at the pile of saw dust you've left.  each little particle of saw dust amounts to the material removed by 1 pass of 1 tooth.  Depending on TPI of the blade, you may end up with a tiny brushburn as opposed to losing your whole finger."
BeAmazed,37tem5,RedDogInCan,25,Sat May 30 17:13:35 2015 UTC,"It would actually be less than that.  As the blade is stopping, it isn't running at the full speed for the whole 5 milliseconds.  Given that it goes from 3500rpm to 0rpm, an approximate of its average speed would be 1750rpm.  This gives us 0.15 rotations or 4.5"" of blade in contact with your finger.  A typical ripping saw blade will have 24 teeth, so the blade stops by the time 3-4 teeth have touched your finger.  The damage is even less because the blade is retracting away from your finger at the same time as stopping.  If touching the first tooth triggers the mechanism, it is likely that the second tooth barely touches you and the third is no where near you."

BeAmazed,37tem5,Milkyway_Squid,5,Sun May 31 00:27:05 2015 UTC,"Also, to half-sever your pinky (~8mm radius), your hand would have to travel 1.6m/s (or 63 in/s).  If you want to keep any cuts below 1mm, keep your hands moving at less than 20cm/s (7.9 in/s)"
BeAmazed,37tem5,yParticle,2,Sun May 31 11:11:42 2015 UTC,That's a really great answer!  I didn't even consider the quantity removed by a single tooth.

BeAmazed,37tem5,hawken50,1 point,Sun May 31 18:36:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah.  Assuming a 10"" (diameter) table saw, it has a circumference of 31.4 inches.  Times that by the .3 of a rotation that happens in the .005msec and you get roughly 9"".  Obviously the # of teeth that hit your finger over that 9"" in dependent on the teeth per inch of the blade."
BeAmazed,37tem5,Loves2Poo,3,Sun May 31 19:14:44 2015 UTC,Thanks. That's amazing. If I had one of these I'd have to try one day. Maybe on my pinky on my left hand.

They had been riding razors since the age of 3, and they were damn good at it.   They came rolling up to the spot one day and immediately everybody started laughing and giving them a hard time.

BeAmazed,37mq1h,ciavs,12,Thu May 28 20:42:57 2015 UTC,I would guess they are lights that turn off when it is light outside and it was bright enough to shut them off for a few seconds.

BeAmazed,37mq1h,MistaJinx,3,Fri May 29 12:53:14 2015 UTC,"tl:dr the ground was saturated with electrons, temporarily disturbing the flow of electricity which disabled the light.   So my new understanding is that electricity's route is always to ground. With the light in the church, it flows through the fixture, back to the panel, to the ground bar then to the ground rod that is anchored outside the church. When the lightning struck the church, all of the electrons when to ground and very temporarily saturated the area so the flow was unable to continue from the light to the ground rod so the bulb wasn't producing any light. But because the earth is the final ground, always, it can never be saturated permanently which is why the light turned back on. Make sense? I'm not 100% but that's my understanding."

You can get a box of 500× 9mm rounds for ~$150.  Would you rather have a night out on the town or a few hundred bullets for the range?   I know my choice.
BeAmazed,37bt5j,WakeAndVape,7,Tue May 26 15:57:39 2015 UTC,Definitely a night out on the town. And one can be had for much cheaper than that. My favorite nights out have always cost less than half that price.

BeAmazed,37bt5j,Orgell_Evaan,2,Tue May 26 21:44:37 2015 UTC,So does that count as more than one bullet per trigger pull? Or maybe those have two triggers each?
BeAmazed,37bt5j,AVeryHeavyBurtation,1 point,Tue May 26 18:18:55 2015 UTC,They do have 2 triggers each but they are linked so that pulling either trigger will fire both barrels.
BeAmazed,37bt5j,nodstar22,2,Wed May 27 03:25:59 2015 UTC,Last I heard about these it was still under some kind legal ambiguity.  Since it fires more than one round in a trigger pull with the ATFs weird laws it could be considered an automatic weapon.  Which requires different paperwork and more money than a regular firearm.
BeAmazed,37bt5j,Vorsai,1 point,Tue May 26 19:36:15 2015 UTC,Since it was manufactured after 197? (forget the exact year) if it is decided that it's an automatic weapon it'll be completely illegal full stop.
BeAmazed,37bt5j,InfanticideAquifer,1 point,Tue Jun 2 08:44:41 2015 UTC,Hardly any weapons are actually illegal.  If you have the money and time to go through all the hoops you can have just about anything you want.  Edit:  In the US anyway
BeAmazed,37bt5j,Vorsai,1 point,Tue Jun 2 09:02:01 2015 UTC,And full auto weapons manufactured after the passage of the National Firearms Act are one of the exceptions. Unless you hold an FLL as a weapons dealer or are using one in the course of your job as a member of the Armed Forces or as an agent of the state with police powers there is absolutely no legal way to own one. There is no tax stamp. There is no may-issue license. There is no anything.

If he was to steal the base (run to it at anytime of play) or advanced by the ball being hit, he could run past second base leaving a runner on first, not forcing him to run means the opposing team has to tag the player to be considered 'out'."
BeAmazed,3732q5,Spectator404,6,Mon Jun 1 20:08:47 2015 UTC,What's happening here?
BeAmazed,3732q5,SuperSeriousUserName,17,Sun May 24 16:40:17 2015 UTC,"This is amazing for multiple reasons.  The baseman has to catch the ball and tag the runner when he's not touching the base.  Note this can happen at any time, even through a little bit of trickery: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5wGxsxjmy0  So the runner is sliding in, and the baseman catches the ball and reaches down to tag him.  Instead of going straight through (where he'll be tagged), the runner reaches around and touches the base from the backside as he's being touched, so he's safe.  But wait, there's more!  As he's sliding forward, his hand is going to release the base, which means he'll get tagged and out.  So he reaches up and touches the base with his FOOT before his hand releases, so he's still safe.  But wait, there's more!  He's continuing to slide, and he has to keep touching the base with is foot...and he JUST BARELY DOES.  Stays safe."

BeAmazed,36z5u7,OfficerDarrenWilson,-1,Sun May 24 08:41:15 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I got a ""collectors' cup"" at a ballgame that was printed kind of like that - actually, I think it was just a regular 2D print ""wrap"" around a plain plastic cup.   By the third time I used it, the ink started flaking off. I hope OP's process is far more permanent. Looks like an oil based paint laid out on a water based liquid bed. Which should give an excellent, long lasting, durable print that won't fade for a long time - if the print medium the 3D object is made from has good adherence for oil based dyes or paints. My guess is that with high quality 3d printing processes, this is addressed.   Is there a protective clear coat over it? How long is the ink/dye/paint rated to stay unchanged?  I think that 3D printing will be a uber-smash-hit with artists, as it gets adopted. In a very analytical way, it's the ultimate form of 3D sculpture - lacks all of the spiritual activity of shaping something with your hands, but makes up for that by allowing almost pure thought to be transformed into a three dimensional object - you could make almost anything.   Unfortunately, artists who aren't limited by their medium suffer greatly from the curse of ""too many possibilities"", and it's easy to get a sort of writer's block. Art is a lot easier to make when most of the decisions about what you can make have already been made by the choice of media.  I look forward to seeing 3D printed sculpture evolve as the fine art community explores the limits of the process."

Originally, recorded live-action film images were projected onto a frosted glass panel and re-drawn by an animator. This projection equipment is called a rotoscope. Although this device was eventually replaced by computers, the process is still referred to as rotoscoping.  In the visual effects industry, the term rotoscoping refers to the technique of manually creating a matte for an element on a live-action plate so it may be composited over another background.

BeAmazed,36m235,TheLawlrus,-8,Wed May 20 19:35:14 2015 UTC,"Well, he had no other option and had to do something.  There was always a tiny chance that the refs wouldn't notice it or they might rule it as unintentional. I've seen guys get away with kicking the puck in."
BeAmazed,36m235,root88,2,Wed May 20 14:09:35 2015 UTC,"This is in the 2nd overtime in a Stanley Cup Playoffs game.  The goal was going to be reviewed.  If he had let the puck drop to the ice, there is a chance it would organically find its way to the net either by deflection or it ending up on the blade of his teammates.  Instead, they have to halt play, allow the other team to regroup, and hope they get another good chance in front of the net."
BeAmazed,36m235,The-Strike,-1,Wed May 20 15:27:16 2015 UTC,He could have tried to bat it in with his stick.

BeAmazed,36hokc,cchillur,14,Sat May 23 17:03:23 2015 UTC,"True, but that extra layer of security could produce two things - time spent accessing bike, and volume of access. Someone tried to pinch my bike from outside my house, and the only reason I caught them was because they couldn't smash two locks and a heavy chain quietly. If someone wants the bike, they'll get it anyway. This could help someone stop an opportunistic thief. Down the line though, if they caught on, it'd be like putting a padlock on a tent - you're advertising that it's a tin can full of tools and a bike."

BeAmazed,36hokc,cchillur,1 point,Tue May 19 15:49:56 2015 UTC,"I've got my motorcycle outside, in front of my house under a tarp at the moment; I'd rather have one of these. In both cases though, the insurance would require a certain grade chain with lock attached to something secure - in my case it's slung around a lamp post, if I had a shelter like that I'd get a wall anchor.  What I'm saying is, secure is kinda whatever your theft insurance would cover."
BeAmazed,36hokc,Cthulhu__,2,Tue May 19 16:02:11 2015 UTC,"Sadly, I agree that IS the definition we should all go by. Whatever our insurance company will cover."
BeAmazed,36hokc,cchillur,1 point,Tue May 19 21:06:31 2015 UTC,"Or, put another way, ""secure"" is only ""more effort than when the thief wants to put out.""  I think the obscurity helps a lot here.  When you see a bike, you want it.  When you see a silver box, unless you know what it is, it doesn't look like something you want.  Even if you do know what's in it, it might contain a bike.  That's a lot of effort to break in, making a lot of noise, only to find out that I'm out riding it.  It's not better than an actual garage.  My bikes are in the garage... because I have one.  But if I had to keep it outside, I think this thing would add a lot my bike's security, and would keep an awful lot of weather off of it.  (That cage is going to breathe a lot better than a tarp, too.)  Would it ""be secure?""  No.  That's an impossible standard.  Someone is always willing to do enough to break it.  But it would be more secure."

BeAmazed,36hokc,Mr_Again,1 point,Tue May 19 14:18:06 2015 UTC,"It only saves space outside of riding season.  During riding season, it saves space in your garage (if you have one), or perhaps saves you from having to dink with a storage unit, in addition to providing some shelter for the bike and making a space for small tools (battery charger) outside.  An even better use is in a space where you're only there during the day.  Then when you aren't riding (which is most of the year), you get the space back.  If I owned a shop, I might put two or three of these on the side of my building for staff who want to ride to work."

I'm thinking like... how could she have guessed that. So she tells me one of her clients called in a couple hours prior and transferred over like $100k to reserve one of the first ones or something.   So anyway one day people with money and a dream to fly a jetpack are going to be doing it. It's happening.gif   Also in case anybody was wondering, I did not end getting anywhere with that girl; I think i found out later she was either married or engaged.

BeAmazed,35l4lo,Ek_Los_Die_Hier,4,Mon May 11 14:51:45 2015 UTC,"Here's the thing. You said a ""tortoise is a turtle.""    Is it in the same family? Yes. No one's arguing that.    As someone who is a redditor who likes turtles, I am telling you, specifically, in science, no one calls tortoises turtles. If you want to be ""specific"" like you said, then you shouldn't either. They're not the same thing.    If you're saying ""turtle family"" you're referring to the taxonomic grouping of Testudines, which includes things from pig-nosed turtles to Aldabra giant tortoises to Green Sea turtles.    So your reasoning for calling a tortoise a turtle is because random people ""call the shelly ones turtles?"" Let's get crabs and clams in there, then, too.    Also, calling someone a human or a redditor? It's not one or the other, that's not how taxonomy works. They're both. A tortoise is a tortoise and a member of the turtle family. But that's not what you said. You said a tortoise is a turtle, which is not true unless you're okay with calling all members of the turtle family turtles, which means you'd call red-eared sliders, northern river terrapins, and other reptilians turtles, too. Which you said you don't.    It's okay to just admit you're wrong, you know?      Damn, that was both hard to do (seems that turtles are much more isolated on the evolutionary tree) and interesting.  But I concur, tortoises are turtles."
BeAmazed,35l4lo,i_drah_zua,4,Mon May 11 15:40:15 2015 UTC,"You seem to have inferred a lot from my 4 words.

Basically, I adapted the now famous comment from /u/unidan to make a joke, like it's often done.    I'm not an expert either.    Also, my native language is German, and all turtles and tortoises are called Schildkröte (lit. ""shield toad""), so it's easy to see they are the same.

Wait for your opportunity and grab a fish when it comes to take food.   2:   Catch a fish normally. Hold fish by it mouth in the water. Start the camera. Wait until the fish thrashes and then pull it up.
BeAmazed,35apce,bonez656,1 point,Fri May 8 19:22:39 2015 UTC,"Noodling:       Noodling is fishing for catfish using only bare hands, practiced primarily in the southern United States. The noodler places his hand inside a discovered catfish hole. Many other names, such as catfisting, grabbling, graveling, hogging, cat-daddling, dogging, deepthroating, gurgling, tickling and stumping, are used in different regions for the same activity.  The term ""noodling"", although today used primarily towards the capture of flathead catfish, can and has been applied to all hand fishing methods, regardless of the method or species of fish sought. Where the name ""noodling"" originated is not actually known, but the name is not at all illustrative of the dangerous craft.  Noodling as a term has also been applied to various unconventional methods of fishing, such as any which do not use bait, rod & reel, speargun, etc., but this usage is much less common.  Due to concerns over either the safety of noodlers or sustainability of fish populations, or both, the technique is illegal in some states where it was once traditionally practiced. As of 2002 [update], it was legal in some form in eleven states, sometimes with restrictions on the species or sizes of fish, and on the specific methods that may be employed: Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Illinois, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Wisconsin.  It has since been legalized in Texas.

In the axolotl, metamorphic failure is caused by a lack of thyroid stimulating hormone, which is used to induce the thyroid to produce thyroxine in transforming salamanders.

If you put a bomb under a car, it might bounce up in the air, but it will fall back down again.  You are correct in that at some point in time there would be a ""cavern"", but it would be full of expanding energies and what could probably best be described as hellfire from the nuclear chain reaction.   Once that energy stopped filling the ""cavern"", gravity takes over and fills it back in with the dirt that was previously occupying it (now with bonus radioactive material!)"

BeAmazed,33xcpd,bassoonbuffoon,12,Sun Apr 26 16:08:42 2015 UTC,"via /r/motorcycles   There's a bit of a hill there. At the crest, he and the bike lifted a little, which reduces the load on the tires. The rear tire slipped out b/c he was on the throttle. After the crest, he and the bike come down and compress the suspension. Rear tire bites at the same time, front tire is out of alig and causes a small high-side situation. Again, rider and bike bounce up lessening the load and the whole thing starts to oscillate due to front suspension and steering sort of bouncing back and forth (front wheel is likely out of alignment with rear like in a tank slapper). The amazing thing here is that the rider had the composure and throttle control to be able to put more power to the rear, which lifts the front and allows the bike to settle down."

BeAmazed,33xcpd,Good-2-B-King,2,Sun Apr 26 21:00:54 2015 UTC,I imagine kicking wouldn't do anything at that speed - he is probably hitting the throttle hard before he falls and the forward acceleration prevents the bike from falling over

He wanted to go around the corner smoothly, but he nearly crashed when his lost grip with the front tire.  He regained traction and the bike started bucking and his legs flew off the foot pegs causing him to slide backwards on the bike a bit and apply more throttle and prolong the wild ride.  He was stuck in between ""lowsiding"", where you just continue tipping over and slide away, and ""highsiding"" where you are sometimes violently toss into the air at high speeds."

It can effuse through solids like a gas, and dissolve materials like a liquid. In addition, close to the critical point, small changes in pressure or temperature result in large changes in density, allowing many properties of a supercritical fluid to be ""fine-tuned"". Supercritical fluids are suitable as a substitute for organic solvents in a range of industrial and laboratory processes. Carbon dioxide and water are the most commonly used supercritical fluids, being used for decaffeination and power generation, respectively.

For comparison:  9mm handguns produce ~500 joules of energy at the muzzle.  .22 caliber handguns ~150 joules  Even a BB gun produces ~20 joules  I can't speak to how much energy it would take to actually kill someone, but I imagine it's probably more than this thing can produce."

BeAmazed,33j7wn,Faps_McTickle,1 point,Thu Apr 23 11:25:58 2015 UTC,With a bullet being so small one joule of energy could translate to a lot of speed which could then mess something seriously up if aimed right

BeAmazed,33czdv,enclavedzn,3,Tue Apr 21 18:48:50 2015 UTC,Does that mean a quad backflip from switch to switch (no lateral rotation) would be a Quad Underflip 1440 or would it just be a Quad underflip?  How about a regular backflip? Would three backflips be considered a triple backflip 1080?
BeAmazed,33czdv,yammerant,2,Tue Apr 21 19:06:41 2015 UTC,"No it would be a Quad Underflip, because no horizontal rotation had occurred, same as a triple backflip.

BeAmazed,33cxos,Theobromin,9,Tue Apr 21 20:10:44 2015 UTC,The flaps that control vertical tilt are extended in balance to counter act the lift pulling the plane to the ground.
BeAmazed,33cxos,Stokholmusic101,6,Tue Apr 21 20:27:54 2015 UTC,"Here's a link. Here's the pertinent sections:   When air rushes over the curved upper wing surface, it has to travel further and go slightly faster than the air that passes underneath...  creating the lift that holds the plane up. Although this explanation of how wings work is widely repeated, it's not the whole story.  the wings aren't completely flat, as you might suppose, but tilted back very slightly so they hit the air at an angle of attack: As a result, the wings direct the airflow downward, which pushes them upward and produces the lift."

BeAmazed,338kyn,Kovhert,8,Mon Apr 20 19:08:36 2015 UTC,"German Shorthaired Pointer:       The German Shorthaired Pointer (GSP) is a medium to large sized breed of dog developed in the 19th century in Germany for hunting.  The breed is streamlined yet powerful with strong legs that make it able to move rapidly and turn quickly. It has moderately long floppy ears set high on the head. Its muzzle is long, broad, and strong, allowing it to retrieve even heavy game. The dog's profile should be straight or strongly Roman nosed; any dished appearance to the profile is incorrect.  The eyes are generally brown, with darker eyes being desirable; yellow or ""bird of prey"" eyes are a fault. The tail is commonly docked, although this is now prohibited in some countries. The correct location for docking for GSP is after the caudal vertebrae start to curl, leaving enough tail to let the dog communicate through tail wagging and movement. [citation needed] The docked tail should not be too long or too short but should balance the appearance of the head and body. The GSP tail is carried at a jaunty angle, not curled under. When the GSP is in classic point stance, the tail should be held straight out from the body forming a line with the pointing head and body. Like all German pointers, GSP have webbed feet. They are known for going after water fowl in the water.

Obviously I can't make any that large, but I did manage to perfect a mix that can easily give people-sized bubbles. My kids and I take it to the park all the time and let anyone who wants to come up and play, since making about 4 gallons of it costs me like $0.25. :) I love playing with bubbles."
BeAmazed,33asv3,47attemptslater,1 point,Fri Apr 24 21:45:53 2015 UTC,Would you mind sharing the recipe?  I came into this comments section hoping to find a decent one.
BeAmazed,33asv3,NinjaAmbush,3,Fri May 1 13:36:01 2015 UTC,"Sure thing! I wrote up a post about it on my Facebook some years back so I'm just going to copy/paste that (though it's a touch long as the instructions were very clear and detailed). While this looks long, in reality it'll take you like 10 minutes to make up (not including letting the mix rest for 15 minutes) and like I say at the end it's best if made up at night and left overnight, or at least for a few hours, before using. The mix sort of thickens up that way and makes stronger bubbles. I've also included some instructions for DIY big wands.  Also, make sure you write the recipe/instructions on the outside of the milk jug or whatever you're using because you'll get asked by SO MANY PEOPLE that it's easiest to just have it already there so they can take a picture with their smart phone. ;)  INGREDIENTS:       1 tsp. Guar gum, $3.50-$4 @ grocery/health food store  (You'll find it where vegan/alternative foods are sold. It's used as an alternative to eggs; it binds ingredients together).     2 tsp. Glycerin, $2-$4 @ grocery store   (Don't buy this at a pharmacy, it's twice as expensive there for some reason).     15.5 cups warm-to-hot water   (Tap works best!)     2 tsp. Baking Powder     1/2 cup + 2 tbsp Dawn or Joy dish soap (We tried a dozen different soaps and Dawn Ultra - NOT antibacterial, just as plain as you can find - works the best by far. FYI, Sunlight was the worst!).   DIRECTIONS:       Mix the guar gum and glycerin together in a small bowl or measuring pitcher. Use one that can contain about 2 cups. It'll be VERY thick, almost semi-solid - make sure there are no lumps, and the powder is completely mixed in before continuing.     While stirring constantly, slowly add two cups of warm-to-hot water to the slurry. I cannot stress those things enough! As before, this'll thicken up real fast, and if the water is too cool or you're not mixing constantly, it'll form lumps! If that happens it's almost impossible to break them up, so you'll have to redo these steps!     Let the mix rest for about 15 minutes to thicken up a bit more.     You'll probably want to transfer the mix to the bigger container now (like a milk jug; anything that can hold about a gallon). Add the rest of the water, warm-to-hot works best, and slowly stir until it's completely mixed.     Add baking powder.     Add detergent and mix slowly and evenly, try to avoid foaming it up (don't shake the container!)     Put the lid on your container and slowly turn it upside-down and back again: this helps to mix it slowly without creating foam.     ENJOY!   You can use this mix immediately, but you'll get way better, bigger, and stronger bubbles if you make it up when the kids are in bed and let it rest overnight. The bubbles just aren't as thick or big when you use it right away. Guar gum is hygroscopic, which means it absorbs moisture, and we find that we get better bubbles if the mixture is left to absorb for at least a few hours - but the best by far come after 12-18 hours. :)  DIY GIANT BUBBLE WAND:       Grab an old cotton t-shirt you don't use anymore and lay it out flat.     Cut the hem off the bottom and discard, then cut an even strip off the bottom about 1/3 to 1/2 inch in size. It doesn't need to be perfectly straight. Now you have a nice, thin little loop of fabric!     Gently stretch it, so the edges curl in on themselves.     Grab a pair of ""handles"". This can be virtually anything: skewers, dowels, pencils, chopsticks, actual sticks...     Tie one end of the cotton loop to a handle using a cow hitch knot (visual here: http://goo.gl/4WxGW1), you'll use both sides     Grab one 'string' of the loop about half-way down and tie it onto the second handle using another cow hitch knot (this one will be a bit harder since you have to pull the other handle up through the knot when tightening it).     Your finished bubble maker should have an oval-shaped string hanging down that's about twice the length of the string between the two handles.    ADDITIONAL TIPS:       If you're having trouble with step two, try just adding one cup of water at a time, mixing it up completely, then adding the second one. Make sure to keep stirring constantly, slowly and evenly.     I like to add the detergent and baking soda over the course of step four. Each time I measure out another cup of water, I pour in a few table spoons of the detergent and mix it up, then add it into the jug. By the end of the 15.5 cups, I've already mixed in the other ingredients and avoided the risk of foaming it all up.     When making bubbles, use a 'butterfly' motion with the sticks/wands: gradually opening and closing the circle as you walk backwards, or hold it up to a light breeze. If the bubble is too large and doesn't get ""closed off"", eventually it'll get too big to stay stable and pop before it leaves the wand!     Cotton t-shirts work best when making your own wands; the absorbency allows you to draw up more mix for each dip!"

BeAmazed,336q0m,autowikibot,1 point,Thu Apr 23 04:19:12 2015 UTC,"Flux pinning:       Flux pinning is the phenomenon where a superconductor is pinned in space above a magnet. The superconductor must be a type-II superconductor due to the fact that type-I superconductors cannot be penetrated by magnetic fields.  The act of magnetic penetration is what makes flux pinning possible. At higher temperatures the superconductor allows magnetic flux to enter in quantized packets surrounded by a superconducting current vortex (see Quantum vortex). These sites of penetration are known as flux tubes. The number of flux tubes per unit area is proportional to the magnetic field with a constant of proportionality equal to the magnetic flux quantum. On a simple 76 millimeter diameter, 1-micrometer thick disk, next to a magnetic field of 350 Oe, there are approximately 100 billion flux tubes that hold 70,000 times the superconductor's weight. At low temperatures the flux tubes are pinned in place and cannot move. This pinning is what holds the superconductor in place thereby allowing it to levitate. This phenomenon is closely related to the Meissner effect, though with one crucial difference — the Meissner effect shields the superconductor from all magnetic fields causing repulsion, unlike the pinned state of the superconductor disk which pins flux, and the superconductor in place.

These sea slugs are pelagic: they float upside down on the surface tension of the water, where they are carried along by the winds and ocean currents. Glaucus atlanticus is camouflaged: the blue side of their body faces upwards, blending in with the blue of the water. The silver/grey side of the sea slugs faces downwards, blending in with the silvery surface of the sea.  Glaucus atlanticus feeds on other pelagic creatures, including the venomous cnidarian, the Portuguese Man o' War. This sea slug stores stinging nematocysts from the cnidarian within its own tissues, which is additional protection from predation attempts, but a human picking up one of these sea slugs that has accidentally washed up on the beach may receive a very painful and potentially dangerous sting.

BeAmazed,32tbwd,accidentpronehiker,25,Thu Apr 16 17:14:04 2015 UTC,"First aid treatment is pressure on the wound and artificial respiration once the paralysis has disabled the victim's respiratory muscles, which often occurs within minutes of being bitten. Tetrodotoxin causes severe and often total body paralysis; the victim remains conscious and alert in a manner similar to curare or pancuronium bromide. This effect, however, is temporary and will fade over a period of hours as the tetrodotoxin is metabolized and excreted by the body. It is thus essential that rescue breathing be continued without pause until the paralysis subsides and the victim regains the ability to breathe on their own. This is a daunting physical prospect for a single individual, but use of a bag valve mask respirator reduces fatigue to sustainable levels until help can arrive.   Wow"

I kind of feel bad, because I made several posts on space related pictures in the past few days calling them out as fakes. I do not mean to be an ass or try to imply anything, but these pictures are quickly butchered composites. I do photo forensics regularly and also professionally and just can't sit back and watch this. Now onto the photograph,  The black disk to the right is simply the black layer of the original file where the yellow disk of 'whatever' was pasted in. You can tell by looking at it that something is wrong. Compression analysis and the fact that EXIF data was butchered out confirms a 100% fake. Sorry, guys....can't buy this one."

A light helicopter like the Robinson R22 can carry about 70 liters of diesel. Diesel has an 35.86 MJ/L density which gives 2500000000 joules give or take.

Our windows got blown out but that was about it. I live about 3 miles from the store and I watched this monster tear the only city I've ever called home to shreds. A lot has been built back but you can still ride down 15th and through some of the neighborhoods in the area and see foundations where homes and buildings once stood. The most chilling moment was the first time I drove down 15th at night. It was a street that was full of stores and just tons of lights that lit up the night. I remember it being the most desolate looking place I've ever witnessed in person. No lights for as far as you could see other than traffic lights. It was depressing."

In a car it would be a hell of a lot easier because you have downforce and 4 wheels at your side (no pun intended.) Here you have to lean the entire vehicle around extremely high speed turns as well as very sharp 90o turns. Too slow, you'll fall. Too fast, you either crash or cannot lean enough to turn. With no downforce it just makes it crazier since most of these turns would just be dominated by, say, an LMP because they handle so well."
BeAmazed,32fdlc,ArchmageNydia,7,Mon Apr 13 12:25:24 2015 UTC,You don't fall off your bike if you enter a turn too slowly. You'll just... be slower.
BeAmazed,32fdlc,432334323432343,0,Mon Apr 13 13:48:10 2015 UTC,"That's not entirely true. Entering the corner at a certain speed requires a certain effort to lean the bike the proper amount to make the corner. If you apply that same effort at significantly reduced speed you can essentially over-lean the bike and lowside yourself. It's rare because it takes a special level of stupid, but it does happen. Got a little too eager myself once and I don't know if I thought I was going faster than I was or just hit the brakes harder than normal, but I damn near slammed myself into the pavement a few years back."

Putting rolls the ball along the ground and the club never touches the grass. Miller thought this shot was too far/difficult to putt and wanted to chip it closer to the hole, using a club and a shot that would have torn a small hole in the green. Jack Niklaus helped design this course, it was newly opened, and maintaining a green that nice is very difficult and very expensive, so he showed him it could be done with a putter."

BeAmazed,32e4c7,aligatorstew,10,Mon Apr 13 03:38:54 2015 UTC,The only scenario I can think of is if you have a downhill putt and the slope of the green makes the ball accelerate too much so when it hits the hole it jumps over. That would be an impossible putt.

It surrounds the irregular variable star AE Aurigae and is located near the emission nebula IC 410, the open clusters M38 and M36, and the naked-eye K-class star Hassaleh. The nebula measures approximately 37.0' x 19.0', and lies about 1,500 light-years away.  It is believed that the proper motion of the central star can be traced back to the Orion's Belt area.

It consists of two major volcanic cones: Greater Ararat (the highest peak in Turkey and the entire Armenian plateau with an elevation of 5,137 m (16,854 ft) and Lesser Ararat (with an elevation of 3,896 m (12,782 ft).   The Ararat massif is about 40 km (25 mi) in diameter. The Iran-Turkey boundary skirts east of Lesser Ararat, the lower peak of the Ararat massif. It was in this area that, by the Tehran Convention of 1932, a border change was made in Turkey's favour, allowing it to occupy the eastern flank of Lesser Ararat.   Mount Ararat in Judeo-Christian tradition is associated with the ""Mountains of Ararat"" where, according to the Book of Genesis, Noah's Ark came to rest. It also plays a significant role in Armenian culture and nationalism. The mountain can be seen on the coat of arms of Armenia.

BeAmazed,3243ik,jodobrowo,2,Fri Apr 10 21:06:58 2015 UTC,"Section 9. Energy dissipation of article  Spillway:       As water passes over a spillway and down the chute, potential energy converts into increasing kinetic energy. Failure to dissipate the water's energy can lead to scouring and erosion at the dam's toe (base). This can cause spillway damage and undermine the dam's stability.  To put this energy in perspective, the spillways at Tarbela Dam could, at full capacity, produce 40,000 MW; about ten times the capacity of its power plant.   The energy can be dissipated by addressing one or more parts of a spillway's design.

BeAmazed,31pbku,Baerstad,-1,Tue Apr 14 23:38:58 2015 UTC,"WRONG the description is wrong  They mixed up alpha and beta decay.  Alpha decay is practically a helium nucleus and can be stopped by a sheet of paper while still being highly ionizing.  Beta decay on the other hand is a neutron turning into a proton while emitting an electron and an electron neutrino(last one could also be an anti electron neutrino, not quite sure) and will penetrate a few cm of steel.  So if it truly is beta decay causing the fluoresence you will have a raditation source with quite some penetration power on your wrist."
BeAmazed,31pbku,MrEppart,2,Mon Apr 13 19:13:18 2015 UTC,Nope. Beta penetration depth depends on the energy of the beta particle. Tritium's decay energy is only 18 keV so it definitely wouldn't get to your body from the vial.
BeAmazed,31pbku,PandaSchmanda,1 point,Tue Apr 21 20:23:12 2015 UTC,"And it probably is beta decay, considering tritium is only a proton and three neutrons; there's not enough mass for alpha decay."

BeAmazed,30xay1,Facerless,15,Tue Mar 31 18:11:14 2015 UTC,Possibly there was magnesium burning in the fire as well. If a block of magnesium is on fire we use a Dry Chem extinguisher rather than water. However those are mainly in VW engines.
BeAmazed,30xay1,Splatapotomus,4,Tue Mar 31 19:09:54 2015 UTC,Based on the sparks I would guess the battery.

In 1990, he began what he is known for today: building large mechanisms out of PVC that are able to move on their own, known only as Strandbeest. His animated works are a fusion of art and engineering; in a car company (BMW) television commercial Jansen says: ""The walls between art and engineering exist only in our minds."" He strives to equip his creations with their own artificial intelligence so they can avoid obstacles by changing course when one is detected, such as the sea itself.

When you're going fast enough and you quickly turn the board like that and keep your balance the wheels literally slide sideways and if you hold the slide too long the wheels can go flat.

In this gif, and the source video, we can clearly see that there is a lot of traffic they're riding by, and that the road is only about 1 lane wide. These two factors make it unlikely that they used a car, though doing so on a wider road with less traffic certainly makes much more sense."

BeAmazed,30ortd,tacosfalafels,5,Sun Mar 29 11:30:13 2015 UTC,"As someone who collects and maintains his own knives, I have a few comments to make.  There's a saying I used to use... 'invisible edge'.  That used to be the metric when I polished a knife sharp enough.  While you can't see the actual edge., if you look at it in the right way in good light you can usually see the differences in the edge, where it isn't straight.  That dulls up a knife, but if you get it really sharpened properly, you'll no longer see it.  Nowadays the edges I put on are actually mirror polished.  Now while he said that it was 'only the tip', to make a knife sharp you want the full /\  that he showed... cause that's still going to get dragged through whatever you cut... and the smoother it is, the better it'll perform.  There's also a microedge that some people put on their knives, just another edge on top, very small with a more acute angle.  Also the most important thing I can say about knives is sharpen them less, hone them more.  Honing is when you see a butcher use his steel... some people think this sharpenes - it doesn't remove metal like sharpening does.  It just pushes the metal back, realigning the edge.  This means your knives will stay sharp for like 6 months if you do it every time, as opposed to one month.    a sharp knife is a safer knife.  oh and one final thing... the sharpest thing pretty much is obsidian, and that can get down to 1nm edge.  They make special scalpels out of it - for when they need superfine cuts.   glass is also very very sharp when broken in the right way."
BeAmazed,30ortd,Silverlight42,1 point,Sun Mar 29 12:04:42 2015 UTC,"Out of curiosity, how do you get a blade that sharp? Most atoms are between 0.1 and 0.5 nm, and obsidian is made up of several different atoms, so it seems like getting a blade that sharp would require a non-traditional process."
BeAmazed,30ortd,nefariousdestiny,1 point,Mon Mar 30 22:03:45 2015 UTC,knapping.  Basically chipping away a blade.  looks like this in the end.  You can't sharpen obsidian.  I don't think.   maybe I used the wrong term.. could be 1 atom wide.. or something else I don't remember for sure... but it's pretty close to the sharpest you can get.

Appearance and size of article  Mekong giant catfish:       Grey to white in colour and lacking stripes, the Mekong giant catfish is distinguished from other large catfish species in this river by the near-total lack of barbels and the absence of teeth.  The Mekong giant catfish currently holds the Guinness Book of World Records' position for the world's largest freshwater fish.   Attaining an unconfirmed length of 3 m (9.8 ft), the Mekong giant catfish grows extremely quickly, reaching a mass of 150 to 200 kg (330 to 440 lb) in six years.  It can reportedly weigh up to 350 kg (770 lb).  The largest catch recorded in Thailand since record-keeping began in 1981 was a female measuring 2.7 m (8 ft 10 in) in length and weighing 293 kg (646 lb). This specimen, caught in 2005, is widely recognized as the largest freshwater fish ever caught (although the largest sturgeon species can far exceed this size, they are anadromous). Thai Fisheries officials stripped the fish of its eggs as part of a breeding programme, intending then to release it, but the fish died in captivity and was sold as food to local villagers.

Known since the 1960s, the generally accepted model of their formation was proposed by the US oceanographer Seelye Martin in 1974.  The formation of a brinicle was first filmed in 2011 by producer Kathryn Jeffs and cameramen Hugh Miller and Doug Anderson for the BBC series Frozen Planet.

BeAmazed,2ueq0d,Ghost_Animator,25,Sun Feb 1 14:28:59 2015 UTC,Does that mean he has less to lift or is it harder because he isnt pivoting around his feet.
BeAmazed,2ueq0d,jammyasdfg,13,Sun Feb 1 18:26:18 2015 UTC,My guess is that it's a little of both. He likely has less to lift but then he is forced to have a balanced distribution of weight which means there are more muscles active in the motion. Lots of stabilizer action.  (Someone please correct me if I'm wrong)
BeAmazed,2ueq0d,whatwatwhutwut,10,Sun Feb 1 21:20:22 2015 UTC,You're right. He's gotta stabilize. This is likely as hard as a normal pushup would be for you and me.
BeAmazed,2ueq0d,tjenator,3,Sun Feb 1 21:22:55 2015 UTC,"Old post, but its basically a planche pushup. Its way harder than a regular pushup. Look at the angle of his arms. They aren't bellow his shoulders but more like waist level. The lever arm makes it much harder. Don't believe me? Try to do a planche or even pseudo planche pushup. It will be easier for someone without legs, but still years of work harder than a pushup. A full planche with legs is an elite level gymnastics move."
BeAmazed,2ueq0d,Fmeson,0,Tue Mar 31 02:40:57 2015 UTC,"I can do a planche~ish, with my feet still on the ground. But by removing the weight, counterbalancing becomes a lot easier, which is arguably the hardest part. Certainly it is impressive, and I'll admit probably harder than a normal pushup. But I'd say easier for him to do a planche than for me or you."
BeAmazed,2ueq0d,tjenator,3,Tue Mar 31 03:04:06 2015 UTC,"It ain't a planche if your feet are on the ground. You are just doing a planche lean which is significantly easier.

BeAmazed,2ueq0d,Fmeson,4,Tue Mar 31 02:41:17 2015 UTC,I'd love to see this answered by /r/theydidthemath.  Seems like a pretty straightforward physics problem.
BeAmazed,2ueq0d,NettleFrog,6,Mon Feb 2 00:07:27 2015 UTC,"alright i'm going to have a go with this because snow day tomorrow.  it seems most of the work is done for me. according to this post a 5'10 155lb male (we're assuming this is his height and weight, although he looks bigger) doing a pushup is effectively bench pressing 56 lbs. That's 36.12% of the body weight.  he weighs due to his lack of legs.  According to this your legs are 17.5% of your total body weight. So that 5'10 155lb male without legs would weigh 127.87 lbs. And he is lifting all of that. He's even got some leg left, so his weight would actually be higher, but since we dont know what percentage of leg remains, we'll just let leg = 0.  So a man his size with legs doing pushups is lifting 56 lbs, but him without legs is lifting 127.87.   The pushups the marine is doing in the gif are 2.28x more difficult than standard pushups. Not to mention the factor of him being to balance himself because he lacks a 3rd point of contact."
BeAmazed,2ueq0d,tdvx,2,Mon Feb 2 06:33:46 2015 UTC,Thanks!  That makes this gif even cooler!
BeAmazed,2ueq0d,NettleFrog,1 point,Mon Feb 2 13:42:14 2015 UTC,That would be a good idea.
BeAmazed,2ueq0d,jammyasdfg,1 point,Mon Feb 2 01:16:45 2015 UTC,"There's a lot of factors involved that both make it easier and harder.  On the one hand, the man is lighter. That should make it easier. But, the movement is different. Previously, he was pivoting on his feet. When he had legs, the center of his mass was closer to his feet than where he was pushing. That  means that the his body weight was being moved a smaller distance. Now he's just moving up and down, which means more work since work is force times distance. These factors would be pretty easy to factor in since it's just simple physics as you said.  On the other hand though, there's the fact that he now has to stabilize himself. This changes the game a lot because it engages extra muscle groups. Try curling a dumbbell when resting your upperarm on a surface then without. The latter will be much harder even though the same distance moved the same amount. The reason is that one was just an up and down movement, and the other involved a bunch of other lateral movement where you needed to keep the weight in balance. Those small corrections left and right that you unconsciously make to keep the weight balanced  add up to a lot. But at the same time, this guys those muscles would be hella more developed than yours or mine.   Basically it's not as simple as it seems. I'd say that in the end it's all a wash, and that this is about as difficult for this dude as a normal pushup is to a normal healthy person"
