Shenmue,3e02r9,mavoti,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:37:34 2015 UTC,Here’s a post about one of his speed runs: Playing Shenmue I and II. Simultaneously. As speed runs.
Shenmue,3dyh2n,mavoti,10,Mon Jul 20 15:48:44 2015 UTC,Now we continue to push the paypal donations. That way we can get that 10 million.
Shenmue,3dyh2n,-SPACETARD-,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:30:53 2015 UTC,The crowdfunding is keeping on? Did I miss something?
Shenmue,3dyh2n,TheDalekCaan,2,Wed Jul 22 00:49:04 2015 UTC,Yes.  There is going to be a paypal option now that the kickstarter is done. Kinda like Star Citizen.
Shenmue,3dyh2n,-SPACETARD-,-10,Wed Jul 22 04:18:47 2015 UTC,"Sure go ahead but I'm not going to do that. Look, I know you're excited but continuing to throw money at them will be a bad idea in the long run."
Shenmue,3dyh2n,WoodAdhesive,6,Mon Jul 20 21:48:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah what a terrible idea to give them more money to put into making the game even better, am I right!"
Shenmue,3dyh2n,vanillabear84,3,Tue Jul 21 02:45:59 2015 UTC,How's about the HD remake of 1&2??? Come on how are other supposed to know the story?
Shenmue,3dyh2n,Masterofunlocking1,3,Tue Jul 21 03:32:26 2015 UTC,This needs to happen. #SaveShenmue isn't over until this generation of gamers has a chance to play those games on current hardware.
Shenmue,3dyh2n,notafingah,2,Tue Jul 21 04:06:39 2015 UTC,Cedric Biscay about it:   This is a fair article.
Shenmue,3dyh2n,TweetsInCommentsBot,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:49:24 2015 UTC,@CedricBiscay   2015-07-20 15:35 UTC  This is a fair article. https://twitter.com/guardian/status/623115957309837312     This message was created by a bot  [Contact creator][Source code]
Shenmue,3dyh2n,iwillneverpresident,2,Mon Jul 20 15:49:29 2015 UTC,The article has a link to another Guardian article last year from a guy who had just then tried out Shenmue I. It's a good read too. It's interesting to look at news articles before the KS announcement and see where everyone thought we were in terms of Shenmue III
Shenmue,3dyh2n,Shinjukoo,3,Tue Jul 21 23:22:14 2015 UTC,"the article wasn't very well researched, Kickstarter backers are NOT investors."
Shenmue,3dyh2n,anh86,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:29:05 2015 UTC,"For a mainstream media story, this is surprisingly fair and well-researched."
Shenmue,3dyh2n,Boofpatrol,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:18:06 2015 UTC,"Hasn't Suzuki specifically said in the last month that Shenmue III will NOT be the conclusion of the story?  Also, this is video gaming's highest funded Kickstarter. Exploding Cats is gaming's highest funded Kickstarter."
Shenmue,3dyh2n,anh86,3,Mon Jul 20 19:06:07 2015 UTC,"Yep, it's been confirmed that Shenmue III will not conclude the story. I don't have a source for you but Yu Suzuki has said this in one of his Q&A sessions for Kickstarter backers."

Shenmue,3dyh2n,Boofpatrol,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:14:41 2015 UTC,That's what I thought. It seemed weird that this article was semi-hopeful about this being the conclusion.

Shenmue,3dv9ln,DarkSouls88,10,Sun Jul 19 20:53:19 2015 UTC,And with an option for Japanene with English subs please dear God.
Shenmue,3dv9ln,HydrogenxPi,2,Mon Jul 20 00:07:19 2015 UTC,"Seriously. Both games are way better this way, not just for authenticity and immersion, but the audio is better as well."
Shenmue,3dv9ln,notafingah,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:12:52 2015 UTC,"Is this actually true, or is it just that most players don't speak japanese so they couldn't tell bad japanese audio from good audio in the first place?"
Shenmue,3dv9ln,iwillneverpresident,0,Mon Jul 20 07:40:04 2015 UTC,"I've always wondered that myself, the inflection and phrasing could be just as bad in Japanese."

Though I don't recall Shenmue I being so bad in English, Shenmue II seemed way off for some reason."

Shenmue,3dv9ln,TweetPoster,2,Sun Jul 19 20:28:42 2015 UTC,"That picture is everything, really hoping for some PC releases with those."
Shenmue,3dv9ln,sheizlegend,1 point,Mon Jul 20 08:44:30 2015 UTC,"Thing is, I dunno if Sega is in a position to financially bank on doing an HD release. It's gonna be a lot more complicated than a simple texture swap. They gotta rerecord the sounds and dialogue, and most likely remodel lots of things as well as recreate the UI for hi-definition.   I have a feeling for a game of Shenmues size...it's not gonna be cheap."
Shenmue,3dxxzz,Masterofunlocking1,2,Mon Jul 20 13:17:04 2015 UTC,"Unless you have a very late hardware revision from the last months before the Dreamcast went away, your Dreamcast can run unpressed, non-retail game discs. I recommend theisozone.com, burn a copy!"
Shenmue,3dxxzz,anh86,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:50:45 2015 UTC,Thanks! I'll check that. I hope sega brings them back in a HD collection since the kickstarter went so well

Shenmue,3dtqvq,falloutfawkesss,4,Sun Jul 19 11:11:10 2015 UTC,"I'm currently replaying Shenmue 2, the Xbox version playing on the 360. I completed it back in the day but it's been a long time since I played it and felt motivated with Shenmue 3 on the way. Glad you finally got to see the end of Shenmue 2 :)"
Shenmue,3dtqvq,Calzvicsius,1 point,Sun Jul 19 11:58:14 2015 UTC,Both games still look beautiful after all these years. I think I will make a habit of replaying them every couple of years. My Xbox version crashed a couple of times towards the end so I had a bit of a anxierty towards the end since you go so long without saving the game.
Shenmue,3dtqvq,kongsnutz,2,Sun Jul 19 13:32:18 2015 UTC,Did the same and tag teamed the game with my wife. had the game since it launched though just never finished it.    So glad I did it now though and never spoilt the ending either after all these years I escaped spoilers.
Shenmue,3dtqvq,iwillneverpresident,1 point,Sun Jul 19 12:36:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah, me too. I think that is the beauty of Shenmue a huge game with a loyal fanbase but not so big that the end is common knowledge."
Shenmue,3dtqvq,dodg3r_de,2,Sun Jul 19 13:33:22 2015 UTC,"I'm ashamed to say that I mostly forgot the details about Shenmue II. Don't have my stuff right now so I watched a Lets Play over the last couple weeks. I totally forgot how long, deep, exciting, and overall awesome that game is."
Shenmue,3dtqvq,anh86,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:57:22 2015 UTC,"I never played Shenmue, but heard a lot of great thinks about it. Did it age well? Are the mechanics good? Any tips for a total noob?"
Shenmue,3dtqvq,dodg3r_de,2,Mon Jul 20 11:52:57 2015 UTC,The only tip I have is to play it. The controls in the first game take a little bit of getting used to but it's worth it to push through that initial struggle. The graphics definitely hold up if played over VGA connection (Dreamcast) or component connection (Xbox). The story is outstanding.
Shenmue,3dtqvq,anh86,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:21:31 2015 UTC,"Thank you. I will have to try the Xbox version, i sadly don't own a Dreamcast."
Shenmue,3dtqvq,dodg3r_de,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:00:55 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind you can easily burn and run any Dreamcast game so if you don't want to spoil it by starting with Shenmue II, the consoles are pretty cheap... At least in the US."
Shenmue,3dtqvq,anh86,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:23:44 2015 UTC,"I'll try to get a Dreamcast cheap, i am a little bit low on cash right now :/ Worst case i will have to watch a Let's Play for Shenmue 1."
Shenmue,3dtqvq,anh86,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:42:41 2015 UTC,"Shenmue II (Xbox) actually comes with a DVD catching you up on the story. It has also been uploaded to YouTube in its entirety but I think it's a pretty poor substitute for playing the game. You have at least 30 months until Shenmue III drops, you might as well take your time and acquire what is needed to truly enjoy the games. You've waited this long, what's another few months.   Of course, this is just my opinion. Enjoy it--however you end up experiencing it."
Shenmue,3dr5p2,Grifkilla51,4,Sat Jul 18 17:40:34 2015 UTC,If they don't Sega is far more stupid than I could have ever imagined lol
Shenmue,3dr5p2,JohnnyPappis,3,Sat Jul 18 19:45:11 2015 UTC,Especially since they had said it was basically already done when they had released the hd jet set future. They could make bank easily.
Shenmue,3dr5p2,JMaboard,4,Sun Jul 19 00:04:29 2015 UTC,Lets hope soon tho... because I'm still thinking what Yu said in a interview that he wants to make shenmue 4
Shenmue,3dr5p2,RDC-018,2,Sat Jul 18 17:47:30 2015 UTC,Didn't they say they will have a big annoucement for the Tokyo Game show ?

Shenmue,3dr5p2,BlizzardOfDicks,3,Sun Jul 19 00:29:43 2015 UTC,There's a high probability they're going to show a new Sonic game.
Shenmue,3dr5p2,sheepheadcg,1 point,Sun Jul 19 07:19:22 2015 UTC,"Yep, could be many things. I hope for their sake that it is something grand lol"
Shenmue,3dr5p2,Ebolafingers,2,Sun Jul 19 10:30:48 2015 UTC,What are the chances   Higher than they've ever been. If it's going to happen...its going to happen during Shenmue 3's development cycle.   The kickstarter turned heads no doubt.
Shenmue,3dr5p2,jackiejack1,0,Sun Jul 19 03:07:55 2015 UTC,if they will release them at all it would be before shen 3 comes out.  There's no reason for them to introduce the games to the new generation of folks only to have them forget about em by the time shen 3 is out.
Shenmue,3dr5p2,jamnesiac,2,Sat Jul 18 18:49:41 2015 UTC,"What you're saying makes no sense. Have you forgotten about games you played 2 years ago? Or hell, have you forgotten about Shenmue 14 years ago? With updated graphics, the game will be an enjoyable experience for newcomers. They're not going to just forget about that during the 2 year frame to S3. Have more faith in Shenmue."
Shenmue,3dr5p2,jackiejack1,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:02:52 2015 UTC,"Well, here's the thing right - Shenmue is amazing. You know it. I know it. We know it. But the game is more of a cult classic.  A fair bit of people out there will pick it up now and say ""why do i have to open all these drawers""?  It's kind of like how if you go play some Genesis games you love em but people who haven't played game X don't really enjoy it.  They were amazing when you first played them and that feeling stuck.  Both Shenmue games are awesome but for people entering them for the first time now the gameplay feels dated I'm told. Granted I think that is due mostly to the controls but my point is that a fair bit people who enter it now will play it and not really keep it in mind for the third's release."
Shenmue,3dr5p2,jamnesiac,1 point,Sun Jul 19 09:36:58 2015 UTC,"You're probably right to an extent, but if they update the graphics and controls/gameplay in the HD release, I think it'll still be fun for most newcomers. Obviously not for the FPS crowd, but I think it has appeal to people that love, say, the Bioware games."
Shenmue,3dr5p2,jackiejack1,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:37:37 2015 UTC,I agree 100% but I don't think Sega would put in the effort to do that (and YsNet is too busy with Shen3). :(
Shenmue,3dr5p2,anh86,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:56:08 2015 UTC,"Maybe I'm an anomaly but I'd never played Shenmue until the fall of 2012. I loved it and rolled right through into Shenmue II. I liked Shenmue II even more, in fact, it's the best video game I've ever played and I instantly became a Shenmue superfan. It's not nostalgia for me, the games hold up for modern audiences. Even the graphics hold up pretty well, IMO. If the games were re-released with a widescreen aspect, were given the improved controls from Shenmue II and also were given the time skipping feature from Shenmue II for those who just want to get the main story rather than seeing everything in the game--modern audiences would embrace it."
Shenmue,3dr5p2,jackiejack1,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:11:56 2015 UTC,Did you play Shen 2 on the 360?  It updates the visuals to hd and looks great.  I can understand people wanting to play it on dc though but I have played it on both.  IMO Shen 2 is a much better game than the first.
Shenmue,3dr5p2,anh86,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:56:13 2015 UTC,"I agree, Shenmue II is the better of the two games. I have the Xbox version but I still always play on the Dreamcast. It runs in 480p just like the Xbox version when run over a VGA output cable so it looks great on Dreamcast too!"
Shenmue,3dr5p2,jackiejack1,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:14:04 2015 UTC,"Right, but I am talking about playing shen 2 on the Xbox 360 which up-converts xbox original games to HD"

Shenmue,3doz9m,yodifatcatz,4,Sat Jul 18 01:53:43 2015 UTC,Hell yeah. Maybe we can get all the battle systems with the pay pal addition.
Shenmue,3doz9m,wadester007,9,Sat Jul 18 04:09:22 2015 UTC,I check on this campaign about 15 times a day. Are you saying I have to go back to 'life' now?
Shenmue,3doz9m,jamnesiac,4,Sat Jul 18 02:23:11 2015 UTC,"I wonder if there'll be an option to check the kickstarter status from within Shemue III at a dial-up Internet cafe? I mean if they have Sega Saturns they should have dial up, right? It could happen! ;)"
Shenmue,3doz9m,SuperDerek86,3,Sat Jul 18 02:36:49 2015 UTC,Ha! Wouldn't that be great.
Shenmue,3doz9m,jamnesiac,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:43:45 2015 UTC,Nope. Now there'll be a paypal option we can obsessively monitor.
Shenmue,3doz9m,Ebolafingers,8,Sat Jul 18 21:16:25 2015 UTC,"So amazing guys! It just went up like a rocket today and I was so happy to see us meet the 6 Million goal. Seeing Yu cry on stream really shows how much he wants to make this game, and how happy he is to get this weight off his shoulders.  With the official confirmation of payment via Paypal opening up soon, I have no doubt in my mind that we will knock out all the stretch goals in the coming months.  In the next few days I hope one of the fan sites gets a campaign together with the goal of contacting Sega about a Shenmue 1 and 2 remake or Port. This is by far the best time to do such a thing and hopefully there will be some progress soon!  Let's make S1 and S2 come true, just like we helped make S3 become a reality!"
Shenmue,3doz9m,sheepheadcg,7,Sat Jul 18 03:07:44 2015 UTC,Would be hilarious if Sega re-released the two games and wound up making back its original investment in those games.
Shenmue,3doz9m,Colorfag,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:18:53 2015 UTC,He cried on stream? I must give him more money!!!
Shenmue,3doz9m,Ebolafingers,7,Sat Jul 18 21:17:24 2015 UTC,Very happy to see that it got to 6.3M! Now to wait 2 years...
Shenmue,3doz9m,mrkotfw,3,Sat Jul 18 01:59:56 2015 UTC,And then its the wait for Shenmue 4
Shenmue,3doz9m,Colorfag,3,Sat Jul 18 04:18:14 2015 UTC,God damn it. One step at a time I suppose.
Shenmue,3doz9m,itwasquiteawhileago,1 point,Sat Jul 18 05:54:53 2015 UTC,It should be enough time to play through the first 2 games again.
Shenmue,3doz9m,curlybegills,5,Sat Jul 18 14:33:56 2015 UTC,"I went out with some friends for my buddy's birthday and I was checking the Kickstarter all night, and announcing the totals and everything. I know nobody else cared, but that didn't stop me. It was a one man celebration.   We did it!"
Shenmue,3doz9m,Capthowdy1027,3,Sat Jul 18 15:14:00 2015 UTC,Congrats everyone! Will be strange to go from 1-2 updates per day to nothing for months.
Shenmue,3doz9m,anh86,3,Sat Jul 18 02:14:44 2015 UTC,"Nah, I feel like they'll keep in touch with some regularity."
Shenmue,3doz9m,aresef,2,Sat Jul 18 03:26:02 2015 UTC,This campaign has definitely been a bumpy ride from start to finish.
Shenmue,3doz9m,PhotoVideoSamplesEtc,3,Sat Jul 18 05:43:17 2015 UTC,What do you mean? I agree that the campaign started out rather weak but almost all adjustments and updates they made I thought were positive.
Shenmue,3doz9m,MrCruesliPants,2,Sat Jul 18 06:51:57 2015 UTC,I probably didn't use the best words but what I meant was that it went up and down concerning the way the Kickstarter was handled and the way some of the media was treating it. Some good points about the campaign and some bad points. Some positive media about the campaign and some negative media especially concerning how much involvement Sony really has with it and outside funding. Some other big KickStarter games have gotten outside funding as well but it sort of feels like this game gotten singled out just because Sony had some involvement.
Shenmue,3doz9m,PhotoVideoSamplesEtc,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:16:28 2015 UTC,Co-producer Cedric Biscay believes the same thing. He estimates 2 million was lost due to misinformed negative media coverage overwhelming the message of the Kickstarter campaign.
Shenmue,3doz9m,breakYODAy,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:26:59 2015 UTC,"There really was 15 days in the middle of the campaign after Sony's Andrew House kind of implied that Sony was financing the game where the kickstarter staled, it took them too long to clear everything up (r/ps4 is still very negative about the campaign and believe Sony is footing the bill).  The last 8 days were really good but I can't stop thinking that the game could have made an extra 2 million."
Shenmue,3doz9m,elkalb,2,Sat Jul 18 12:37:45 2015 UTC,the last 48 hours were crazy.
Shenmue,3doz9m,caat9,2,Sat Jul 18 08:36:08 2015 UTC,Although its close to the amount the first two cost back in the day it dose prove one thing that Sega missed for far to long.  THIS GAME WAS WANTED AND WANTED BY MORE PEOPLE THAN THEY THOUGHT!!!!  Although I may not be able to play it on my console of choice I will STILL be getting it once its out no matter what :)  I am so glad this is happening.
Shenmue,3doz9m,morpheus2n2,0,Sat Jul 18 11:29:27 2015 UTC,"Although I may not be able to play it on my console of choice   Yes, Playstation is a rather odd choice. I know it's the best selling console on the market but there's something wrong about Shenmue on Playstation for me (QTE with triangle, square, circle, cross is terrible). I will get my ps4 physical copy anyway but I secretly hope that once the Sony deal is up, we'll get ports to the other consoles."
Shenmue,3doz9m,elkalb,3,Sat Jul 18 12:41:10 2015 UTC,":) I still can't believe it's actually happening, this and the FFVII remake announcement turned me from a 34 year old father to a hysterical little girl lmao."
Shenmue,3doz9m,morpheus2n2,2,Sat Jul 18 14:03:16 2015 UTC,"Not that odd.  The choices are pretty much the PS4 and the Wii U.  Keep in mind that we are talking about a Japanese developer here, and the XBox One's sales in Japan have been so bad that you may as well consider the console a non-presence.  Hell, Microsoft isn't even going to the Tokyo Game Show this year."
Shenmue,3doz9m,ScarsUnseen,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:06:08 2015 UTC,"The kickstarter was announced in the US and the campaign was very west oriented. I'm sure if you looked into it, the majority of the funds for this kickstarter came from the west.  I read a French interview of Cédric Biscay and he just said he can't announce and doesn't know if the game will come on other consoles... that usually means it'll come to other platforms in the future."
Shenmue,3doz9m,elkalb,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:20:18 2015 UTC,Forbes guy (I think it was a different guy than hat dumb piece a while back) says he has sources putting the actual budget for the game at around $20 million.

Shenmue,3dozjk,aresef,8,Sat Jul 18 01:53:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I can see why they waited until the end. Get as much money possible through Kickstarter and then do the Paypal. Not a bad idea."
Shenmue,3dozjk,PhotoVideoSamplesEtc,2,Sat Jul 18 01:55:56 2015 UTC,"Some campaigns put up the PayPal buttons before the campaign ends long as they have reached their goal, but I guess they wanted more emphasis on the main campaign."
Shenmue,3dozjk,Ifkl,3,Sat Jul 18 01:56:39 2015 UTC,"Makes good sense--breaking that record brings a lot of hype and marketing.   I'm not sure why you'd want to use paypal before the kickstarter ends, but I'm sure people have their reasons. Wonderful to hear that there's going to be continued crowd-sourced funding for Shenmue, I can see that getting us into the Choubu expansions."
Shenmue,3dozjk,jamnesiac,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:40:00 2015 UTC,"If you're not trying to break a record or aren't particularly worried about making more money if it's a project with no real specific stretch goals, yeah, you can totally put the button on there before the project is done. Bubblegum Crisis did it, Otaku no Video did it. I think the PayPal option was available for Yooka-Laylee before the campaign ended."

Shenmue,3dm9r0,Brianthelion83,2,Fri Jul 17 15:17:16 2015 UTC,"Yes. Kickstarter doesn’t allow edits to the rewards in the sidebar. On the campain front page, near the top, it says:   Update News:  PS4 physical copy now a platform choice! All tiers $60 and above will include your choice of the following:    PS4 Physical Copy  PS4 Digital Copy  Windows PC Physical Copy  Windows PC Digital Copy   *Changes to Reward pledge buttons are not allowed after they are pledged for, so please see the ""Rewards"" section below for complete Reward details."
Shenmue,3dm9r0,mavoti,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:05:07 2015 UTC,"I was wondering this as well as I chose the $100 reward and, based on my research, it appears that we DO get the choice for a physical PS4 copy."

Shenmue,3dm9r0,PersianSpice,3,Fri Jul 17 15:23:20 2015 UTC,Hopefully this really helps everyone to see just how wanted this game actually is.
Shenmue,3dm9r0,Ebolafingers,3,Fri Jul 17 16:36:15 2015 UTC,Yes. I really hope outside investors will see that a 14 years old game managed to break records when everybody thought it was dead and invest in Shenmue III to make it the game we dream it can be.
Shenmue,3dm9r0,elkalb,2,Fri Jul 17 23:04:27 2015 UTC,I thought it said the record was 8 million? That's what the kickstarter page says

Shenmue,3diesm,Feathertop,3,Thu Jul 16 15:00:37 2015 UTC,"Good piece. Ticks all the boxes of the concerns, legitimate or no, that are out there."
Shenmue,3diesm,aresef,-2,Thu Jul 16 21:20:05 2015 UTC,"I think most people werent affected by the whole Sony thing at all.They were grossed out by how the KS was handled in the first 3 days of it launching post e3.Because there wasnt any disclosure from YsNet or Awesome japan or whoever about their external partnerships....I mean if you ask money from any organisation in the world for a business they ask u to disclose your external sources.Now granted KS works differently.on one hand they want you to fund the game on the order of 10 Mil(again a PR disaster the day that news came out) and on the other hand they didnt disclose any partnership details until the 2Mil goal was met.  Even today, can someone please (with sources) inform your fellow redditors (since everyone is soooooooo knowledgable on this here), who else apart from Sony is providing external support to YsNet and in what capacity.  If you are considered by them as primary donors that will fund DEVELOPMENT and you consider development a huge thing right? Why not disclose appropriately."
Shenmue,3diesm,babubhai111,3,Fri Jul 17 03:43:45 2015 UTC,"I think the Sony thing absolutely had an impact. Just google Shenmue Sony and you'll see what a mean. So many media outlets went full retard and Suzuki-san had to spend 10 minutes answering a Red Shirt Guy question clearing shit up and a statement doing the same.   Other investors are also unknown contractually. And think about it, despite the KS, while the game is happening, it isn't a commercial success yet. Just over 60,000 people have chosen to back its DEVELOPMENT on Kickstarter. That does not go to those investors; rather, it's supplemental to them. Either way, that wouldn't even raise so much of an eyebrow on the NPD list. Would you, as a private investor, like to tie your name publicly now to something that might flop later?"
Shenmue,3diesm,aresef,1 point,Fri Jul 17 11:45:04 2015 UTC,"Well What perspective are you trying to address this situation from matters.If you are talking about the same perspective as I am (aka a donor towards DEVELOPMENT only) I 100% need to know exactly what the deal is with these ""contractual obligations"" towards only one set of backers(i.e. external entities not associated with the KS).Put out a pdf doc like any publicly listed company does.I think people should be allowed to raise concerns in accordance with disclosure. If it was done on day 0 with a clear assessment and notification about money needed/raised so far/external companies involvement etc. even if the names arent disclosed the amount all the external forces are putting into the pot or an estimated valuation of services rendered if we are to believe the sony deal is exactly what they tell us it is(No way to verify it is, vis-a-vis ""Contracts"",but that isnt the problem anyway).  If some people even youtubers raise questions it is ultimately good for every individual investing. Also to answer your question, If i am investing in something and its a company I am going to take into consideration that they have to disclose to some one sometime of my involvement so its fine by me personally. But I think you were hinting at a generalisation so in that case I cannot answer as one shouldn't speak for many. I do not gain anything by drumming this up.But a counter point is necessary and mistakes were clearly made.If this was any other kind of funding process through any other means aka banks,Venture capitalists,stock markets etc. they would never in a million years get away with non disclosure of external entities involved (or atleast how much they are putting in combined) to their so-called PRIMARY BACKERS in those cases. Try that the next time you go to a bank for a loan or a private investor(venture capitalist).Maybe you could be successful with non disclosure on day 1 and on that day I will admit that I was indeed completely wrong in judging this situation,I promise :)"
Shenmue,3dj8tb,DouWingGau01,6,Thu Jul 16 18:39:39 2015 UTC,The first one because that's where the story starts and the story is really important in the Shenmue games.
Shenmue,3dj8tb,FruitDove,3,Thu Jul 16 20:27:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I heard that. It's one of the reasons I'm interested in the games. Well, also because I got this Dreamcast from Europe and I want to use it a bit, and heard Shenmue is a must play game."
Shenmue,3dj8tb,FruitDove,3,Thu Jul 16 22:01:55 2015 UTC,Both of them are must-play games. You'll appreciate Shenmue 2's story and general improvements from Shenmue 1 better if you play 1 first.
Shenmue,3dj8tb,sheepheadcg,3,Thu Jul 16 23:36:52 2015 UTC,"You have to play 1 first lol The story won't make any sense, not to mention, why would you want to skip the first game?

Shenmue,3dj8tb,fittersau,2,Thu Jul 16 18:50:42 2015 UTC,"Aye, I think I'll get both then and just start with the first. They're really, really cheap (10 SGD per game)."
Shenmue,3dj8tb,piichan14,2,Thu Jul 16 18:57:45 2015 UTC,Link? Is that an online store? I wouldn't mind two extra copies lol
Shenmue,3di339,aresef,2,Thu Jul 16 13:22:13 2015 UTC,The problem still remains that the rewards in the lower regions never really improved. (200-300 dollar range). But it's too late for that now. I still think we can hit almost 6 Million.

Shenmue,3ddng2,NoPlayTime,2,Wed Jul 15 14:40:16 2015 UTC,"People have speculated Sega will announce it at TGS because a top executive recently and surprisingly said in an interview that they wanted to re-engage the core fans of old Sega and they were sorry for making games that the true fans really didn't want. He said at that time he didn't have anything big to announce but they had a big announcement ready for TGS. That's what started the speculation. To me, that pretty much guarantees an announcement from one of Sega's beloved and ignored franchises but who knows if that will be Shenmue."

Shenmue,3ddng2,NoPlayTime,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:53:51 2015 UTC,"Sonic Unleashed, Sonic Colors, and Sonic Generations are all better than Sonic Adventure, in my opinion. A Sonic game for next year, his 25th anniversary, is pretty much a given. And if it will be anything like the 20th anniversary game (Generations), then it's going to be good.  But yeah, I'd still like Shenmue 1+2 HD as well."
Shenmue,3ddng2,rokama,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:53:36 2015 UTC,"Sonic unleashed was terrible, colours I've not played, and generations was good (well the side scroll ""2d"" was)"
Shenmue,3ddng2,anh86,1 point,Thu Jul 16 06:02:29 2015 UTC,"I strongly disagree, Unleashed wasn't terrible at all. It was a bit too heavy on the Werehog levels, but apart from being too long and featuring too much beam-balancing over bottomless pits in later levels, the Werehog gameplay was actually good. The Sonic daytime levels were just great. Both Colors and Generations are thinly veiled updates of that. Generations uses the same engine as Unleashed and is so similar, that fans managed to port Unleashed levels from the Xbox 360 to the PC version of Generations.  If you don't like the Unleashed-style Sonic gameplay, that's your loss, but many fans do. You should at least check out Colors, though. It's not as crazy fast and more 2D than 3D. You might enjoy it."
Shenmue,3ddng2,Aspersio_,0,Thu Jul 16 09:55:31 2015 UTC,"I really hope it's not Sonic and don't think it will be. They've made so many uninteresting Sonic sidescrollers lately that I can't possibly see the big and surprising announcement being another one of those. A new Sonic Adventure would be somewhat interesting but I never really thought Sonic translated well to 3D. Sonic Adventure (1) is a legitimately good game but SA2, Sonic 3D Blast, Sonic R, etc. are all pretty bad.  Given Sega's recent track record, I will be surprised if the announcement is anything that we want but at the same time, I don't think it will be Sonic."
Shenmue,3ddng2,mfbranscombe,2,Wed Jul 15 19:23:02 2015 UTC,"Dude, SA2 was superior to SA1 in every way, what do you mean ""pretty bad?"" It was a phenomenal game with lasting value thanks to the multiplayer and chao competitions."

Shenmue,3dbxv0,anh86,2,Wed Jul 15 03:04:41 2015 UTC,It's still a little jarring to see Shenmue characters modeled in very high resolution and with modern polygon counts. It looks beautiful but it's just something we'll have to get used to. Can't wait!!
Shenmue,3dbxv0,fluidmint,2,Wed Jul 15 15:51:20 2015 UTC,Even though I'm a massive fan and I'm as excited as much as anyone for the game. I don't see the point in this small trailer. It isn't anywhere near finished and from an outsider who doesn't know anything about Shenmue but has heard a lot about it; this could look about disappointing.
Shenmue,3dbxv0,jamnesiac,2,Wed Jul 15 07:57:47 2015 UTC,"I actually agree. It's good fan service, but I don't see it helping the KS any. They would've been better off developing a new tribute to the series to show why it's so special. Everyone knows the graphics will be improved from 2001."

Shenmue,3dbm5f,jadamsmash,3,Wed Jul 15 00:31:23 2015 UTC,"Firstly I'd question whether Shenmue fits into the 'Open World' genre as it is known today. I think when most people hear Open World they immediately think GTA or Skyrim as recent examples. Both wildly different games from each other and Shenmue. They are however both massive worlds with minimal loading screens and I think that is the key to make people think of it when you talk about Open World. Shenmue is a series of 'small' environments with a loading screen between each.  I don't agree with this definition but that seems to be the general view.  My point being, the term Open World limits the scope of the answers to what people view as an Open World game.  Majora's Mask is a pretty good suggestion it even has a time limit in which the game has to be completed. My suggestions,  Yakuza:(I've only played the first)   The game takes place in a fairly concise area so you really get to know it and it's inhabitants. It has mini games. Day and night sections (though these are dependent on the story progression). You can train with some NPC's to learn new combat moves (just like Shenmue).   Persona 3 or 4:   Has the 'slice of life' gameplay where you go to school and live a normal life making the world feel real and relatable. NPC's and party members have detailed personalities. Goes through Day and Night (limited by story progression). A time system where by you only have so many days to reach your goal (same as Shenmue).   Final Fantasy VII:   Had memorable NPC's I thought. They certainly don't do much they're generally in the same spot the entire game but they have distinct personalities and there are some memorable characters. Great mini Games. Collecting Materia, Weapons and the Final Limits could be considered similar to collecting scrolls in Shenmue? Maybe...   Shadow of Memories  Been too long since I played this to give an accurate break down of it but I remember being very invested in it and the world.  Edit: Formatting"
Shenmue,3dbm5f,Leham1986,1 point,Wed Jul 15 10:10:31 2015 UTC,"I specifically like the mention of Persona 4. Not only is it an absolutely amazing game, but I think the biggest parallel to Shenmue is how in both games you play through the story day by day. You wake up, go to school or work or other activities and the story evolves as the days pass.   Are there any other games in which day-to-day activaties are an essential part of the gameplay other than the Shenmue and Persona games?"
Shenmue,3dbm5f,MrCruesliPants,2,Wed Jul 15 12:17:14 2015 UTC,"Although cartoony, Animal Crossing has a similar level of detail. Characters notice when you've been absent, change their routines based on time of day, have activities they persue etc, also the environment has a day to night cycle and seasons."

As you all know, the end of the Shenmue 3 Kickstarter quickly approaches.  We would like to create a last massive Twitter event for Kickstarter campaign scheduled on Wednesday July 15 in an attempt to raise awareness that it is important to collect as much money as possible for the game to meet its potential.  To this effect, two admins of the Shenmue Collective (Reef and Markus) have generously offered to give away their spare Dreamcast / copy of Shenmue 1 respectively, for the lucky winner of a contest!"

Shenmue,3d8ybn,Aspersio_,7,Tue Jul 14 12:50:30 2015 UTC,Some people feel like Sony is being cheap. They're doing as little as possible to score a big exclusive that garnered a lot of buzz while still requiring the fans fund the game. I don't know if that's true or what went on behind the scenes but that is the perception.  The anger has come from people outside the fan community who really don't understand. The core Shenmue community has been begging for the chance to fund the game for years!
Shenmue,3d8ybn,anh86,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:23:10 2015 UTC,"I agree with most of this. I have no issue with Sony funding, and i'm not convinced much of the core fans do either, so i fit your last paragraph.  However, I don't really see Shenmue 3 as being a big exclusive and i'm not sure why Sony ""should"" be contributing more. They're not even getting an exclusive since there will be a PC release, I for one wouldn't have hesitated to buy a PS4 solely for this game if there wasn't, and I can't see there being a rush of people who will be doing this still.  Don't get me wrong, I know there are thousands of people so excited for this game that they might explode and ~$5mil is an incredible amount to be raised by fans. The reactions to the announcement of this installment were incredible and i certainly reacted in much the same way.   But going by how many people have pledged towards this project so far it certainly not as popular as many other projects I certainly feel that Shenmue fans are a minority in gaming and regardless of how awesome the game series was/is, it seems it hasn't been played by the majority.  I appreciate that the kickstarter for a project does not set it's success or failure in concrete, and i only hope that it's popularity explodes when it's released.  In my close group of gaming friends (say around 30 people) I know of only 1 other person who has even heard of Shenmue (prior to all the press it's been getting) and none of them are interested still (despite my best efforts).  tl;dr Shenmue isn't as popular as some fans seem to believe (despite its awesomeness)"
Shenmue,3d8ybn,NoPlayTime,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:23:56 2015 UTC,"Well yeah, Dreamcast is to blame for it not being mainstream. If Shenmue was released on Playstation, a system that everyone had, it would have been a lot more popular.   My gripe is with people who were angry at the thought of Sony funding the development of Shenmue 3, rather than just marketing. Shenmue 3 doesn't need marketing. Game reviews, word of mouth, and social media are free marketing. If Sony just gave their support to ""development,"" Yu could do whatever he wanted. But instead, people were angry at the thought of there being more money added to development outside of Kickstarter. People better wish there is more money funding this game, because Kickstarter isn't enough to do justice to Suzuki's vision without settling for less."
Shenmue,3d8ybn,NoPlayTime,2,Tue Jul 14 15:53:56 2015 UTC,"Granted the dc didn't help, but that too was unfortunately an item that didn't do as well as it should have. It was easily the best console of its generation, it just got absolutely shadowed by the success of the ps2"
Shenmue,3d8ybn,NoPlayTime,2,Tue Jul 14 18:38:12 2015 UTC,"In terms of utilization of hardware, the Dreamcast had no superior. The DC had inferior hardware to all other consoles, yet superior graphics in basically every game. The complete opposite of the Gamecube, which had superior hardware and inferior graphics. I personally loved the DC. Had not had a single issue with it."

Shenmue,3d8ybn,NoPlayTime,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:47:56 2015 UTC,"If my comment made it seem like I thought Shenmue was extremely popular, that's not what I meant to convey. It did, however, get people talking about Playstation and did generate a lot of buzz in the gaming world. Sony has shown that they aren't afraid to get involved with fan-focused projects and this is just one in a nice line of those. Just because something makes headlines in the gaming media doesn't mean the mainstream audience (the biggest audience) takes notice or cares.  At the end of the day, Shenmue will probably still be a niche game with a very dedicated fanbase. Perhaps that fanbase could grow if we get a port or HD remaster of the first two games but even with that, the game won't appeal to everyone. I also know just one gamer who is a Shenmue fan and others have shunned my attempts to get them to play it. They don't know what they're missing."

Shenmue,3d8ybn,mavoti,3,Tue Jul 14 18:36:55 2015 UTC,"I grappled with this question too. Actually, I ended up getting a little carried away researching the subject. I was scouring forums and online magazines trying to figure out what the big deal was.  The main reasons people were upset were because they either felt Sony was using Kickstarter as free advertising; or they felt that Sony was stealing donor's money, in a way, since they were planning to fund Shenmue III no matter what; or, by using Kickstarter to gauge interest, Sony was passing off the market-testing bill to their consumers. These complaints mostly came from non-Shenmue fans, but there were still a few who were worried that Sony might bully Yu Suzuki into making a game closer to their vision instead of his.  I did my best to see if these complaints had any merit to them. A few days ago, I posted my conclusions online, if you're interested. It's a long, thorough article, but I essentially concluded that Sony was in the clear, and that, if anything, their involvement in crowdfunding should be encouraged."
Shenmue,3d8ybn,m---p,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:58:20 2015 UTC,"My impression was that people were angry because they thought (!) Sony would give the money needed for everything minus the money coming from the Kickstarter. So if fans give more, Sony would have to pay less."

Shenmue,3d8ybn,rokama,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:25:06 2015 UTC,I don't have an Issue with Shenmue being KickStarted and am in fact currently backing the project at the $300 tier. But I have A huge problem with larger companies/publishers using Kickstarter as a tool to gauge interest.   And for the record both Sony and Shibuya productions are providing financial support for this game to some extent so don't try to deny that.It hasn't been disclosed exactly what either of their involvement is except that Sony admitted to helping with advertising and the PS4 port.  In fact I wrote a forum post about it just yesterday and why it feels wrong if any one is interested in my more in depth personal opinion.  http://kindafunnyforums.com/viewtopic.php?f=17&t=3011
Shenmue,3d8ybn,mjqmjq,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:52:38 2015 UTC,"Sony didn't ""admit"" anything - that makes it sound as if they were guilty of something and had to confess. Some Sony employees simply stated some things.  Also, you wrote ""the biggest reason this KickStarter left such a bad Taste in my mouth is that Sony even openly admitted that they could have funded the game themselves it would have just taken longer.""  That is wrong! What Adam Boyes said was that they could have spent two more years of internal fundraising at Sony, convincing higher-ups and so on, but a. they might not have greenlit the project anyway and b. then Shenmue 3 would have become a Sony 1st party project, which would be weird for several reasons: It's Sega's IP, they would have to license it to Sony somehow (assuming Sega was even willing to do that!), and then the project wouldn't be directed by Yu Suzuki anymore (he would need to be hired or contracted by Sony, but even then he wouldn't have full creative control anymore).  You might just as well complain that Microsoft didn't fully fund the game. They could have, and they got the same fan requests. In the end, it was Sony who gave Shenmue 3 a chance. A small one, yes, but that's still better than nothing."
Shenmue,3d8ybn,TechJennings,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:19:26 2015 UTC,"I think most of the people complaining are Xbox fanboys and people who haven't followed the long, sad Shenmue saga.

Demul won't work as it's D3D10/11 only, which Wine won't support until around November (and may be buggy and/or slow at first).  Installing Windows using Bootcamp is another option and you'll be able to use Demul there as well. That will give you the best compatibility, but will require rebooting and maintaining an additional OS.  Extending TheDalek's comment:  LXDream probably isn't viable; it didn't work with Shenmue last time I checked and it struggles performance and compatibility wise. Reicast is also being ported to desktop machines and will be a good option in the future, but it's still under development."

I've been playing on NullDC and the speed is fantastic (60+ fps) but there's some issues with rendering.  You can kind of see through Ryo's head and shadows sometimes look off.  It's not that bad, it's probably about 95% perfect. Can you set up the controls as you want?  I've been playing with an Xbox 360 controller and being able to move and control the camera with the left and right analog sticks makes the game so much nicer.  I currently use Xpadder with nullDC. Do the emulated games in Shenmue work?  NullDC crashed whenever I try to play Space Harrier or Outrun."
Shenmue,3d1v15,JohnnyPappis,3,Mon Jul 13 12:04:00 2015 UTC,"Well, Demul does fix indeed all graphical glitches of NullDC. However, it's very much slower than NullDC. Yep! You can map it to any kind of controller you want. It's much better than NullDC in that regard. I haven't tried any of the minigames yet, but no crashes so far and I haven't heard of anyone else crashing as well."

This one-off Quick Timed Event brings a new twist to the successful #SaveShenmue campaign, seeking to make your followers sit up, take notice, and actually pledge for a game they had no interest in before. Our mission here is to educate and inspire, and with your help we can achieve both on a grand scale.  This Wednesday, please return to this page at the following time in your location, for a globally synchronized launch of the #SaveShenmue QTE. You can join in at any time thereafter, but keep this in mind: the first 10 participants, plus 4 random others, will be entered into a raffle for a special prize to be announced very soon."

Shenmue,3cny4d,aresef,3,Thu Jul 9 11:20:26 2015 UTC,"This was a fascinating one! Takimoto really nailed the design in the previous games. They were so detailed and, like he mentions himself, had that lived-in quality that makes so many areas memorable. I wasn't aware they had an actual architect on the team until recently but it totally makes sense since many of the design sensibilities are things an architect would be mindful of.  Happy to hear that they recognize their environments need to be even more detailed because we aren't in the standard def era anymore. The original games still have a spectacular amount of detail in them but they could get away with reusing lots of assets and writing a bunch of nonsense on posters since they would become blurry and illegible in the game anyway.

Shenmue,3cmx41,Prytanian,11,Thu Jul 9 03:45:44 2015 UTC,"Yakuza is said to be the spiritual successor to Shenmue but I don't think they're all that similar. Both are made by Sega, have open worlds and star a Japanese protagonist and really that's where the comparison ends. Yakuza has a lot more action and over-the-top arcade beat-em-up style fights (a la Dynamite Cop). Shenmue is slower-paced. You explore the world, gather clues, forge relationships, and only fight when necessary. Shenmue is much less about the action and more about people and the world itself. Both are story-driven but story is everything in Shenmue."
Shenmue,3cmx41,anh86,8,Thu Jul 9 04:29:19 2015 UTC,"Pretty much. When I finally played it, I was really disappointed by the people that hyped it as Shenmue's spiritual successor.  Not to say Yakuza is a bad game. I enjoyed it, it's just not all that similar to Shenmue imo."
Shenmue,3cmx41,chaosz3ro,5,Thu Jul 9 06:31:02 2015 UTC,The Yakuza games are like Shenmue without the soul. Not my cup of tea at all.

Shenmue,3cmx41,iwillneverpresident,3,Fri Jul 10 00:16:19 2015 UTC,Wasn't Shenmue initially supposed to be a Virtua Fighter RPG?
Shenmue,3cmx41,AluminiumMk1,1 point,Thu Jul 9 08:27:14 2015 UTC,"Yes, it started out as a Virtua Fighter RPG with Akira as the main character, this was probably around 1995 - 1996.   Everything I recall about the game then was from gaming magazines that date back to 95 - 98 so i'll let you look it up yourself as there's probably more reliable info out there."

One thing that I would add is a universal control scheme so that you could use the improved controls of Shenmue II in Shenmue as well. To make it more accessible to newcomers, they might also bring the time skipping feature of Shenmue II.  EDIT: Oh, and bring the improved game saving scheme of Shenmue II"
Shenmue,3cksb6,anh86,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:32:31 2015 UTC,"playing through Shenmue I again, after playing mostly Shenmue II for the past few years.  Jesus time skipping is useful."
Shenmue,3cksb6,The_Duke_Leto,9,Wed Jul 8 19:56:51 2015 UTC,"I see it both ways. Not being able to skip time feels more ""Shenmue"" to me in that it maintains the realism. It forces you to explore the world, practice your moves and speak with people rather than rush through the main story points.  Time skipping most likely makes the game a little bit more accessible to outsiders and also gives veterans the option for a quicker playthrough so it does have merits."
Shenmue,3cksb6,anh86,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:30:23 2015 UTC,"Only issue with the load time thing is, they always need to tell you where you are.  So I'd lean more towards faster as opposed to nonexistent :p"

On a related note, every cut scene in every game needs to be something you can skip if you want. Seriously. Why is this not a thing now?

Shenmue,3cjnlv,CollyVII,1 point,Wed Jul 8 13:04:53 2015 UTC,"Hmmmmm, that's a really good question. Would it be smart of them to cannibalize the hype off something we can presume they are also making money off of? Maybe they want to wait until after the KS? I don't know."
Shenmue,3cjnlv,aresef,1 point,Wed Jul 8 13:06:03 2015 UTC,"I've said since the start that there has to be somebody at Sega who is thinking ""yeah, we really dropped the ball on this one"" I also like you think they are going to be coat tailing on the back of this to make a quick buck. Now I know it is only recently that they have come out of the wood work and said they have let down fans and the announcement at TGS is only a maybe... but given that this has come so close to a Shenmue III announcement - I think its a good possibility.."
Shenmue,3cjnlv,CollyVII,3,Wed Jul 8 13:15:40 2015 UTC,I'd say the chances of a remastered Shenmue I and II are better than they were a few weeks ago.
Shenmue,3cjnlv,aresef,1 point,Wed Jul 8 13:24:18 2015 UTC,"Plausible? Yes. Likely? I dunno. I mean, it seems like a no brainer, but it might be more involved than we think. For example, The Silent Hill 2/3 HD remakes couldn't reuse the original voice recordings. Would Shenmue be able to, or would they have to dub everything over again with new artists?  Also, I have no idea how long it takes to bump something to HD. Ideally if they want to get this out, it needs to come out before Shenmue III, so people have more incentive to play the first two and then the third shortly after. People jumping right into III, even with catch up movies, are probably going to be lost. Hell, I'll probably be lost after (by 2017) 16 years.  Also, as much as I like Sega of past, they have a long way to go before they can turn themselves around. They're barely relevant these days. I can't say I have a lot of faith in them to back up their words with anything substantial. I'm more than a little skeptical. Happy to be proven wrong, of course."
Shenmue,3cjnlv,itwasquiteawhileago,2,Wed Jul 8 19:24:58 2015 UTC,"Sega has not made any mention of it. In one of the Q&A sessions Yu Suzuki has held for backers of the new project, he said he was going to bring it up with them. As far as I know, he's still on the board there so he should have some pull. A Sega executive also just said in an interview this week that Sega has dropped the ball lately and has only been making games that the fans hate. He said they had projects in the pipeline that would excite fans of the old Sega so I guess we'll see what those happen to be. They are announcing something that will supposedly be exciting to the fans at TGS in September so perhaps that will be our moment! I'd love to see a remaster of the first two games."
Shenmue,3cjnlv,anh86,2,Wed Jul 8 15:37:52 2015 UTC,"I'd like to imagine Sega is so out of touch that the first they hear of this is when Yu comes to ask. They're like, ""Huh? What? People want us to re-release Shenmue? I guess we'd better get on that then"""
Shenmue,3cjnlv,iwillneverpresident,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:48:18 2015 UTC,"It's pure speculation but it does seem like a strange coincidence that people are suddenly excited about Shenmue and Sega is pivoting to try to reclaim the hardcore fans who were once loyal to its beloved first party series. If any company has been out of touch with what its core fans want, it's Sega so it wouldn't surprise me if there was some shock at the positive reaction to Shenmue III."
Shenmue,3cjnlv,anh86,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:13:24 2015 UTC,"I said something similar to my friend earlier on today... its too much off a coincodence that after the success of this kickstarter that sega has come out and trying to reclaim fans... i imagine someone at sega sat there saying ""oh look at that, turns out they did want shenmue despite us telling them they really wanted sonic, sonic and more sonic"" its interestingto note though, they havent actually commited to a TGS annoucement and given Segas rich Cataloge and what has been asked of it... Skies 2, PSO2, Yakuza to name but a few... the annoucement could be anything"
Shenmue,3cjnlv,CollyVII,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:59:58 2015 UTC,"If they really want to win back their old fans, it would be all those things and more. I don't think announcing any one thing is going to do much to revitalise their fanbase, even if it was Shenmue I & II HD."
Shenmue,3cjnlv,ElephantStone,2,Thu Jul 9 22:14:08 2015 UTC,"Right now I play them via emulator, there are a few bugs here and there but it plays very well.

Shenmue,3cfru0,ConceptualTrap,2,Wed Jul 8 12:57:47 2015 UTC,"I really like the $80 tier, unfortunately, I would only want the PS4 physical copy of the game (for collecting purposes) but I also want the PC digital version as well as that's the primary system I want to play on.  They should almost make the PC digital version included with any of the $60+ reward tiers.  Eitherway, it looks like they gave me a good solid reason to bump my pledge up to $80 regardless.  I'm just a bit irked that doing cross platform will cost me $110.  Edit: Worse yet, it doesn't appear that the Telecom card is included in any of the higher bundles.  =\  Oversight maybe?"
Shenmue,3cfru0,anh86,2,Tue Jul 7 16:38:06 2015 UTC,"I think everybody pledged at $80 and higher will be given the chance to select their platform and delivery method. I realize the phone card tier says ""$60 reward included"" but I think that's simply to let people know they could get the physical game. Obviously if you pledge at $60 or $30, you're going to get physical or digital, respectively, but beyond that I believe that everyone will get to select."

I wonder if this is the cinema flashback stretch goal that we unlocked.   In either case, I like the phone card idea. It would be cool if they designed a physical phone card that had a redemption code on it but I suppose they will save money by not doing that."
Shenmue,3cfru0,anh86,1 point,Tue Jul 7 17:32:15 2015 UTC,I don't think it is. They're pretty clear what they mean when they say digest movie. The recap in Shenmue II was also called that.

Shenmue,3cayri,mavoti,2,Mon Jul 6 14:21:39 2015 UTC,"Shenmue is an official limited edition art print drawn by artist John Sweeney based on the classic Shenmue™ game series. Sweeney made this print under direction of Cook & Becker and with official license from SEGA.  John Sweeney - lead concept artist for Sony's The Last of Us and Uncharted 4 - is a huge Shenmue fan. He will donate his proceeds of any copy of this artwork purchased before July 17 to the Shenmue 3 Kickstarter!  Sweeney says about his Shenmue artwork: ""I'm so excited that Shenmue 3 is finally happening! I wanted to capture the moment just after Ryo's father Iwao is killed by Lan Di. In the game the scene stops with Ryo cradling Iwao and screaming ""No!"". I wanted to imagine a shot where Ryo is standing just outside the dojo where is father was just killed. It is cold and very early in the morning. Snow is falling. The morning light is still weak and only some of the wood interior is catching light from the outside. Ryo's pose already hints at him seeking revenge."""
Shenmue,3cayri,mjqmjq,1 point,Mon Jul 6 14:22:27 2015 UTC,Amazing.
Shenmue,3cayri,PersianSpice,2,Mon Jul 6 16:39:40 2015 UTC,That's such a great idea. And what a great piece of art to boot. Love the idea of capturing Ryo alone right after Iwao is killed. Not something I've thought of before but definitely fits the kind of character exploration that Naughty Dog is so good at (especially with The Last of Us).

Shenmue,3cc2jw,mavoti,3,Mon Jul 6 19:16:58 2015 UTC,"Yes, I'd really like to know about DRM for the PC version, especially the physical PC version. When Yu Suzuki hinted at the possibility of a DRM-free PC version, that implied that YsNet and Shibuya Productions currently have a plan in place for some sort of DRM. Is this going to be an online thing (e.g. Steamworks), or an on-disc thing (e.g. Starforce Disc)? And what are the chances, realistically, that we could see a DRM-free PC version?"
Shenmue,3cc2jw,Pocchitte,1 point,Tue Jul 7 11:07:37 2015 UTC,"Yes, this.  Shibuya Productions didn’t answer to this back then, but they made the FAQ after that. So now it would be interesting to know who we have to convince. Ideally they would announce that it will be DRM-free before the Kickstarter ends (I will pledge more in this case; and likely many other people will also support it that won’t consider it unless it’ll be definitely DRM-free).  Everyone, vote on GOG.com for a DRM-free Shenmue III!  #Shenmue3DRMFree"

Without further information, it's going to be difficult even for Chinese speaking fans to be sure where the game is taking place.

Shenmue,3c8s4y,autowikibot,2,Mon Jul 6 05:32:11 2015 UTC,"Nevertheless, good work OP! Seeing these pictures, you really do get a sense of how Mr. Suzuki might have become inspired to make his magnum opus in the first place. These photos depict a rural China, closer to nature and its cultural traditions, which sadly we don't often see more of being depicted in Western media.   I personally think that the villages ""Bailu, Baisha, and Choubu"" are most likely made up, albeit, its not hard to imagine actual locations in real life being named as such.  If anyone is interested, Bai Lu - literally means ""white deer"" Bai Sha - literally means ""white sand"" Choubu - or in Mandarin, ""Niao Wu"", literally means ""Bird's dance""  These names have kind of a ""mythical"" feel to them and such naming conventions (a better description escapes me) are quite common throughout Chinese culture and history. There's a district in China called Xuan Wu (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Tortoise), whose namesake is a mythical tortoise."

It is known as Xuan Wu in Chinese, Hyeonmu in Korean, Genbu in Japanese and Huyền Vũ in Vietnamese  . It represents the north and the winter season.

Shenmue,3c2c28,jamnesiac,2,Sat Jul 4 14:52:43 2015 UTC,Its not troubling at all. Just relax and dont over expect anything to great from this. That way you are not going to be disapointed. There is simply no chance we have the means to make this a AAA game :( so under expect and be suprised rather than over expect and be disapointed. though i agree with you on stretch goals.

Shenmue,3c0qu7,anh86,6,Fri Jul 3 19:09:46 2015 UTC,"Great day, I expect quite a few more pledges if the big gaming news websites run this story! $30 digital backers who want physical will probably bump up. Holdouts who wanted to buy physical at retail will pledge. Many members of the Shenmue community are bumping their own generous pledges by $30 right now as a coordinated effort. This is a huge day for the Shenmue community, bring on the next milestone!!"

Shenmue,3c0qu7,Phyte,3,Fri Jul 3 21:27:45 2015 UTC,"It's exciting, but let's keep the eye on the prize. I imagine this will get us to 5 million. But my ultimate goal is about 7 or 8, with hope that other funding will drop in after to make Shenmue 3 a complete Shenmue game true to its predecessors!"
Shenmue,3c0qu7,mfbranscombe,2,Fri Jul 3 21:41:16 2015 UTC,"We just have to hope that this momentum carries on. If they slowly unveil some more backer tiers, especially some lower end ones, this could really pick up :)  What I would REALLY like to know, looking at other kickstarter campaigns, is how Bloodstained managed to get an extra million on their last day.. And what can we do to ensure this campaign gets a similar surge??"
Shenmue,3c0qu7,SODual,4,Fri Jul 3 22:15:31 2015 UTC,"Bloodstained was just a really, ridiculously well-run Kickstarter campaign. They had a system of goals, community challenges, and social networking initiatives setup right from the very start.  Hey also set up a system where stretch goals had to be earned – and the stretch goals were really good. Great even.  Towards the final day they had a few really high stretch goals revealed including new ports to the WiiU and PS Vita, and a whole extra 8-Bit accompanying game — and the really high ones, rogue like dungeons and boss revenge mode — based on how well the campaign was run I was not at all surprise in the result. Bloodstained made close to $100,000 a day for most of the campaign.  In comparison to the Bloodstained Kickstarter, the Shenmue 3 one is more an average, normal campaign. It's not bad, and Awesome Japan are not doing a bad job at all – but in comparison to The exceptional Bloodstained, you can see where a lot of criticism is creeping in.  It also helps that Bloodstained didn't really have any bad press. Everything about the Shenmue Kickstarter is getting trolled for clicks pretty successfully, so there is that.  I think that the Shenmue 3 Kickstarter will experience a big up spike in pledges on the last day — it always happens. In the end I think it will surpass Bloodstained, but I think we can probably rule out the 10 million stretch goal."
Shenmue,3c0qu7,Kitaoji,-1,Fri Jul 3 23:27:25 2015 UTC,"not bad?   The pitch video is a disaster. It took them 18 days to put something for the newcomers. Ten days or so to move the stretch goals to the top of the page. Stretch goals unexplained or unexciting or in weird positions. They are uploading the videos dubbed and you can't hear the person you are watching at all, like is some kind of action movie or something (hello? subtitles?) ""Other platforms have not been decided yet"", or if the windows version will be on Steam or what. I guess they will decide when the kickstarter is over. The twitch they did.   ....  So much nonsense."
Shenmue,3c0qu7,Moobyghost,2,Sat Jul 4 00:57:33 2015 UTC,Only good stretch goals are the Battle System Expanded ones. Which is from 6m - 7.5m. I would love it if we could make 7.5m.
Shenmue,3c0qu7,nintrader,1 point,Sat Jul 4 01:58:55 2015 UTC,"I pledged $30 and would gladly pay more if i could. I was i could afford $60 for a physical copy, but i can't by the cut off date. It all feels so surreal. Could it make it to $5M? What is the game going to be like. Will it satisfy us after all of these years? What a long strange trip it has been."
Shenmue,3c0qu7,Aspersio_,1 point,Fri Jul 3 22:04:22 2015 UTC,I'm pleasantly surprised by the huge bump! Hopefully they keep spicing it up and drawing people in.

Shenmue,3c0qu7,MyCodenameIsIan,1 point,Sat Jul 4 13:20:19 2015 UTC,The physical PS4 copy was an X factor in all this.  It will be interesting to see if it brings in more pledges or if the big push we saw yesterday was from the $30 on the 3rd pledge.
Shenmue,3c0qu7,Ryukenden000,1 point,Sat Jul 4 18:09:50 2015 UTC,"So looks like the PS4 Physical Edition has brought in around $500,000.  I can only see an Xbox One tier bringing in anything close to that kind of bump now."

The $100 one will get you in the credits and a physical copy, the extra $60 will get you the remaining phsical... its either $160 or $120, you'll have to decide how much you want to be in credits, get the early bird.  however its better to put the money in now and help development, rather than buy it later..."

Shenmue,3c2l7d,BrendanH117,1 point,Sat Jul 4 18:38:22 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'd say playing Shenmue 1 & 2 is well worth it – and much, much better than the recap videos or the DVD movie that was released with the Shenmue 2 Xbox version. You'll never get the feeling of Shenmue any other way than playing for yourself.  One thing: the Xbox version is a very convenient way to play Shenmue 2, but it is greatly inferior to the Dreamcast versions – it looks worse (textures are lower quality, the Dreamcast version has depth fog - which makes the game look less flat), and the Xbox version is buggy (just yesterday I was walking around Aberdeen and loads of NPCs were totally headless - and Ryo too!).  The best would be if SEGA came up with the HD remasters before the release of part III. Otherwise a Dreamcast with either and original copy of the game, or. cdi will do. I've never tried emulation – but I've heard good things about NullDC, which can apparently run both Shenmue games at 1080/16:9."

Either way, you're not going to enjoy III as much if you didn't play/watch the first 2. It's unlike other series, because in Shenmue you live through the story by the calendar day, through every moment of the protagonists' life. This is what separates it from games like Metal Gear Solid, which is plot driven but like an action movie, and modern open world games, where  you just roam around but aren't living the character's life as much as free roaming in a massive playground. Shenmue is an open world but it's driven by the characters and the plot and it's a fully functioning world where NPC's have their own schedules and so does the player."

They're jealous that their indie friends don't get money like this for their crappy games on kickstarter or indiegogo, so they do their best to try to insult games that people actually want to play.   I recommend never going to those two sites again. There is an app for it for chrome. I believe it's ggblocker or something.

Also I've never played Shenmue so my opinion is totally the correct one.""   Funny how they will shit talk a game they 'have no interest in' because it will result in clickbait.

Shenmue,3buzmx,aresef,6,Thu Jul 2 11:02:28 2015 UTC,Arguably the most memorable thing about Shenmue is the soundtrack. The full songs like Shenhua and the main theme are timeless.  Perhaps even more impressive is the 30-90 second scores for the different areas and buildings. I don't know how they have something on an endless loops and not have it be an annoyance.  I'm really looking forward to the new music.
Shenmue,3buzmx,hailXenu,5,Thu Jul 2 12:14:05 2015 UTC,His orchestral soundtrack remains among the finest video game music I've ever heard. It's ambitious and sweeping like an adventure movie without being self-important. Iuchi can do subdued and poetic like Shenhua or big and sweeping like A New Journey or Flag of the Lions.
Shenmue,3buzmx,anh86,3,Thu Jul 2 13:23:58 2015 UTC,"I pre-ordered the vinyl soundtrack from Data-Discs back in May when they first went up on pre-order. I had no idea then, I'd be listening to that great music knowing Shenmue III was coming! I can't wait for September to get that album, best video game music of all time!"
Shenmue,3buzmx,jamnesiac,2,Thu Jul 2 14:22:35 2015 UTC,I ordered it too! So excited to hear it. My only problem is that it's only a selection of songs. Wish it was a double album with everything.
Shenmue,3buzmx,anh86,2,Thu Jul 2 14:25:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm sure there will be some favorites that are missing. Honestly, I was just so jazzed that an official Shenmue item was coming that it seemed like an obvious purchase. Little did I know the frickin third game was mere weeks from announcement!"
Shenmue,3buzmx,phoenity,2,Fri Jul 3 01:28:16 2015 UTC,I find myself humming varied parts of the soundtrack pretty much since I played the games back in the day. Looking forward to the new music :D
Shenmue,3buzmx,the_new_mr,2,Thu Jul 2 12:59:20 2015 UTC,I LOVE the music! Sometimes just stick my headphones in and transport myself. Great for working at the computer or walking around. You can pretend you're Ryo in the latter :)
Shenmue,3buzmx,jamnesiac,1 point,Thu Jul 2 13:24:15 2015 UTC,"I knew they would save the big updates for the 3rd. It's do or die tomorrow for our little Shenmue campaign. Buy less beer this holiday weekend & spend more on Shenmue, folks!  If I see an HD release announcement, I may just hand them my entire bank account. (unlikely, I know)"
Shenmue,3bv6l4,Phyte,7,Thu Jul 2 12:26:48 2015 UTC,"Some people like having games on their shelves. As a collector, I'm among them. With a wide physical release there's also the possibility that randoms will see it at a retailer and take a chance on it. A physical release affords fans the opportunity to purchase multiple copies to inflate sales numbers, which lead to a Shenmue 4. Plus there's the issue of having the first 2 games as physical copies, sucks to not have the third.  I don't understand why someone would withdraw their pledge or not pledge at all, but there are a lot of reasons to want/demand a physical copy."
Shenmue,3bv6l4,BaronVonWeiss,5,Thu Jul 2 12:41:39 2015 UTC,"I'd add that it is also a support issue, at least for the ps4 version.  If i buy S3 on the psn, and 5-6 years from now my ps4 dies OR the local file becomes corrupt, it is effectively lost forever. [Once the ps4 is no longer supported] I like  a physical version because i can use it as long as i have a working console of its era.  Aka I can whip out a dreamcast now and play 1 and 2 today. I doubt the digital version will be that 'future-poof'.  Having said that; I pledged my money knowing I'll likely have to buy a physical ps4 version on release."
Shenmue,3bv6l4,hailXenu,4,Thu Jul 2 13:47:11 2015 UTC,"Agree 100%, this is the biggest reason. We're still playing the copies of Shenmue that sold in 1999/2000! How many people still have their original Dreamcast console and would be able to play it today had they somehow downloaded it to internal storage? In 2030, I hope to still be able to play Shenmue and physical disc is really the only way."
Shenmue,3bv6l4,anh86,2,Thu Jul 2 15:52:33 2015 UTC,"Yes! This was part of the reason that I pledged $100. So, I was rather dismayed to see the question, ""Will there be a DRM-free version for PC?"" along with the answer, ""Maybe,"" on the FAQ. I'm so used to Kickstarter games being DRM-free, and the physical PC version cost so much more than the digital version, that it never even occurred to me that the physical copy would have DRM. If it's some sort of ""in the disc"" DRM (e.g. Starforce Disc) that would still kind of suck, but at least the physical disc would be playable for as long as I have a compatible PC. If it's just Steamworks (or worse, some other, more invasive online service) then I'll be fairly unimpressed."
Shenmue,3bv6l4,Pocchitte,2,Thu Jul 2 20:04:19 2015 UTC,"I'm getting the physical PC game too even though I will buy it again physically or (reluctactly) digitally as needed to actually play the game on console. I'm just not a PC gamer but if PC ends up being the only physical version of this game, I want to have it. I also presumed the physical PC copy would be completely DRM-free. It wasn't until people started asking if it would be that I even questioned it myself."
Shenmue,3bv6l4,anh86,2,Thu Jul 2 20:10:14 2015 UTC,a drm-free pc digital version would be more future-proof than anything else
Shenmue,3bv6l4,yots-it,2,Thu Jul 2 19:20:46 2015 UTC,True. But some people won't get or have the PC version.
Shenmue,3bv6l4,hailXenu,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:49:28 2015 UTC,"DRMs nowadays might get in the way, even if you own a physical copy."
Shenmue,3bv6l4,MairusuPawa,1 point,Thu Jul 2 21:29:42 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the detailed reply, some good points. I do understand the collector thing, I just find it a bit unbelievable and disappointing when some say it's a dealbreaker for them. If Shenmue 3 ends up not as good as it could have been, because some people basically said ""physical or nothing"", that will be very sad.    Also, I think that people that really care about Shenmue 4 would not be prioritising a physical release so much. It has a lot of risk attached - all it would take is for Sony/whoever to over order, and suddenly they have loads of units left unsold, money not recouped, and Shenmue 4 more unlikely to happen than ever. This doesn't happen with digital release, where there is basically no extra cost for more or less units being sold."
Shenmue,3bv6l4,SpaceAnimal,4,Thu Jul 2 12:57:30 2015 UTC,"Final point - this game will NOT sell to the masses. Anyone who thinks it will is deluding themselves.  The first one didn't sell, and that was a state of the art game requiring no prior knowledge. Now we're asking members of the public to buy an almost certainly NOT state of the art game, with 2 game's worth of unseen backstory. It's not gonna happen."
Shenmue,3bv6l4,hailXenu,2,Thu Jul 2 13:01:03 2015 UTC,"I think, as long as it stays at the top of most anticipated game on all the sites that it is listed on right now, it will definitely reach many many hands that have never played the originals. I think it's best to keep it digital on release and then release a limited hard copy for the hardcore fans. But if it does reach a commercial success level shortly after release, there will definitely be a demand for a physical copy regardless."
Shenmue,3bv6l4,jamnesiac,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:50:06 2015 UTC,"I can't disagree with a limited physical release for hardcore fans, as long as the cost is weighed."
Shenmue,3bv6l4,dnekuen,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:50:36 2015 UTC,"I'd argue that it depends on the final product.   A significant portion of gamers [both pc and console] are always looking for a new and different experience, if shenmue 3 is true to the formula of 1 and 2 I think we may get some new fans.   It won't sell like Call of Halo 7:  Black Pirate Ops 3 but it may expand the fan-base some."
Shenmue,3bv6l4,scv102,1 point,Thu Jul 2 13:53:02 2015 UTC,"Open world games are HUGE right now. And reviews are far more accesible these days and a big source for the consumers decision. I think with a physical release, a good review, and the eventual and inevitable re-release of the first two games, this thing could sell a TON. However, if they can't make a ""truly open world game"" for under 10 million, it may not fair well."
Shenmue,3bv6l4,mfbranscombe,3,Thu Jul 2 14:28:20 2015 UTC,I would RAISE my pledge from $300 to a higher one if it included a physical copy on PS4.
Shenmue,3bv6l4,Rock3tPunch,2,Thu Jul 2 12:45:02 2015 UTC,"Shenmue is my favorite game of all time. I would have backed for $5 if they only offered a digital copy. I don't support digital games at all, but I would have felt obligated because as much as I refuse to support digital I would want to see the other fans get to play. With that being said I did donate $100 for the PC physical copy and while that's not ideal (I'd much rather have a PS4 copy) it's at least a somewhat solution to my problem.   Like other users have said I don't support digital because I like being able to play my games as long as possible. My launch Dreamcast broke a year or so ago and I was able to purchase another and still play all my games. If those would have been digital not only would my entire library of games be gone, but I wouldn't be able to redownload them."
Shenmue,3bv6l4,anh86,2,Thu Jul 2 22:50:30 2015 UTC,"I'm with you OP. Of course I'd like a physical copy of the game on PS4 — but I'm still going to back the game as much as I can even if that never happens.  I would be willing to raise my pledge though, if a physical release was announced. I think a lot of the 29 dollar crowd might too — which would be good for everyone."
Shenmue,3bv6l4,anh86,4,Thu Jul 2 22:56:56 2015 UTC,"You don't actually own anything when it is just a download, you merely bought the right to use it indefinitely until you get locked out of it for whatever reason.  The ability to transfer the ownership of something is a good test to see what you actually ""owns""."
Shenmue,3bv6l4,anh86,2,Thu Jul 2 16:59:00 2015 UTC,"People want them for archival and collection purposes. The collection reasons are obvious but perhaps archival is less so. Consider Shenmue I & II. Maybe you bought the game recently or maybe you've been a fan for a long time--either way, you bought a physical copy and as long as you had the disc in your possession you could play the game forever. Digital copies are less permanent. PSN will stop hosting the game one day. At that time, you'd better be prepared to keep meticulous backups of your HDD forever if you want to play through this saga again should the internal drive fail. IMO, it's much easier to keep a hold of a disc copy of a game so that I can play it forever. It hasn't stopped me from pledging all I can but I would love a physical PS4 version. I'd even buy a second copy at release if it's available and not offered as a backer reward."
Shenmue,3bv6l4,AhCup,-4,Thu Jul 2 15:50:15 2015 UTC,"Emulation bro. I bought Shenmue 1 and 2 when they came out, but when I wanted to play them this time round with the announcement of 3, I couldn't be bothered to drag out the dreamcast and find VMU with space. I followed a tutorial and had the games running absolutely perfectly on my laptop 10 minutes later. I have no guilt about this as I paid for the games already. In the future, there will always be emulation or similar ways of acquiring and playing S3."
Shenmue,3bv6l4,nintrader,4,Thu Jul 2 17:31:10 2015 UTC,"Emulation is not the same as playing on original hardware. There are weird graphics issues even when the game is running well. You don't have the same controller or the helpful features provided by the VMU. It's just not the same. If you like it, that's great but emulation is no substitute for really playing the game."
Shenmue,3bv6l4,samuelniemi,2,Thu Jul 2 17:35:58 2015 UTC,"Fair dos. I'm not denying that physical release has its upsides, I guess my my larger point was this:   When we have limited funds to work with, and the stakes are so high to get this ""right"" (another sales flop = no more Shenmue ever), a physical release shouldn't be a priority, and definitely not a dealbreaker. I can agree with the guy above that suggested limited physical release for backers, as long as the cost isn't too high."

I wonder if people with the coin to drop will be able to pick what they want him to say, like when you win the Carl Kasell voicemail greeting on Wait Wait Don't Tell Me.

Shenmue,3blxt6,Inkerlink,4,Tue Jun 30 07:55:10 2015 UTC,"I own one. Purchased it for PAX East 2015.   I was impressed with the detail that went into the jacket, especially around the sleeves and the front. The jacket is a faux-leather, but still very breathable. The vinyl (?) emblems on the jacket are quite thick, so for now, they seem like they will hold up over time. Would much rather have a few cloth patches instead of the printing directly on the jacket, but can't complain for the price (Especially with the current price of the Kickstarter replica jacket!)  Be advised that Insert Coin's sizing is very accurate. I typically purchase Medium t-shirts/clothes in the US, but jumped up to a Large for this jacket. It's a perfect fit, with just enough room for layering a t-shirt or button-down underneath."
Shenmue,3blxt6,JosephFleury,1 point,Tue Jun 30 11:19:21 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the detailed description, I'm also very interested in it. Would it be possible for you to share a picture or two of the jacket?"

Not the dark ones at the beginning.   I'm kind of short and skinny so I ordered a small and it fits everywhere except the arms which are a bit tight, but I do go to the gym so they're a bit bigger than you'd expect on a regular person who'd order a small.   Just my two cents."
Shenmue,3blxt6,LittleGreenNotebook,2,Tue Jun 30 18:03:42 2015 UTC,"Solid point, thanks for pointing that out, /u/LittleGreenNotebook. Only had a few minutes between conference calls to snap a few photos :)"
Shenmue,3blxt6,JosephFleury,1 point,Tue Jun 30 20:32:47 2015 UTC,"I would definitely say order a size up. Being a medium with most all things, i ordered the medium sized jacket. They really cut into the arm pits making a bit uncomfortable to wear. The lining is a bit cheap as well and with the slight snugness in the arms can cause it to tear if you bend down. I also wasn't a fan of the arm emblems being painted on either. It made it look a bit cheap. Overall a little disapointed in the jacket"
Shenmue,3blxt6,mrsaucytrousers,1 point,Tue Jun 30 21:34:01 2015 UTC,"My comments:  Pros: I love that it's Ryo's jacket and that Insert Coin did it.  It contributed to the SaveShenmue momentum so have to applaud them for that. The jacket is quite warm. The emblems are nicely detailed.  Cons: The build quality is cheap.  I ordered a medium (correct size) and the lining tore on me... twice!  It wasn't that it was too small.  I tried the large and it was way too big.  The medium size was fine but the lining is very bad quality and stitched too tight.  Got a replacement and on the second tear, I ended up switching the lining for that of another jacket I had at my own expense.  Much better now. Side pockets are not lined. My brother's side pocket button tore right through. The emblems are printed (not badges - they told me that this helped keep the price down.  Fair enough I guess) The colour is a little too dark for Ryo's jacket.  Overall, I'm happy I got it but was disappointed with the quality.  You might need to replace the lining like I did."

Shenmue,3bhzn6,colacube,2,Mon Jun 29 12:33:53 2015 UTC,"Baisha is not the name of a single place, there is a list on the Chinese wikipedia here of various subdivisions referred to by that name; one of these is near Guilin.   Guilin is a ""prefecture level city""; it's hard to draw a direct comparison, but it's somewhat like those cities in the US that also function as counties; or to put it another way, it's like saying you live within the city limits, although you're in a rural area.  There are multiple Bailu Villages.   Choubu is not Chinese, it is a Japanese reading of the Chinese characters. The area appears to be fictional; the top results for it are discussing Shenmue 3.

Also I think Suzuki said Choubu is on the banks of the Li river, so that rules out Nepal and India.  i think it's most likely that it's a fictional location, as you say, but apparently there is place in China called Choubu-  http://aroundguides.com/27400776  the game's definitely not referring to that place though."
Shenmue,3bhzn6,Ifkl,2,Mon Jun 29 14:08:44 2015 UTC,"鳥舞 If transcribed from Mandarin, it is ""Niao3 wu3"" (The numbers represent tones); in Japanese, these have an onyomi of ""Choubu""; チョウブ. Literally, it means ""Bird Dance"".   The 'Choubu' you have found appears to be 仇堡; Choupu. Choubu is most likely an older form of romanization (many of these sorts of mapping websites have outdated and downright bizarre transliterations of Chinese place names)."
Shenmue,3bhzn6,OnLakeOntario,0,Mon Jun 29 14:20:20 2015 UTC,Yu Suzuki specifically said that we're not leaving China in this game... Which kind of sucks. I preferred small town Japan and culturally diverse Hong Kong to communist China.
Shenmue,3bhzn6,anh86,1 point,Mon Jun 29 16:05:57 2015 UTC,"i don't think that sucks, Shenmue was about China even before Ryo left Japan. although I initially (i mean when I was 13) disliked that after just one game in Hong Kong it was going to China, I now think it's interesting that the game is going for such an extreme contrast (metropolis to village) and that keeps with the spirit of how at first it was home versus strange place. I really love the game's use of setting rather than the settings themselves- it's what makes the game still relevant after all this time, while generic urban sandboxes, well they're fun but they're not Shenmue.  if you want games set in contemporary urban Asian sandboxes, you could try playing Yakuza, which is like Shenmue without interesting characters and story, there are 5 of those games, and to me that series proves why Shenmue is special, that it's about more than the technological achievement of an explorable Japanese town.  As for communism, I think with the game's logic China will neither be communist nor not communist, they'll just avoid mentioning it, and setting the game in rural villages is a good way to avoid the topic. that said, Suzuki said Choubu is going to have hotels and shops, and that one's a bit tricky, there were some privately owned hotels and shops in 1987 China, but not so much in rural areas. Most people in urban areas had never seen a foreigner before, so hotels and shops in a village is a bit odd.  Also, 1987 is definitely a weird year for a story to be set in China if it isn't going to acknowledge communism."
Shenmue,3bhzn6,Baryn,1 point,Mon Jun 29 20:16:11 2015 UTC,"I think they will go for the feel and culture of the place rather than a GPS-accurate representation. Yu Suzuki has said that he chose the time and setting because he wanted to convey the culture of that place and time through a game. Settings are a representation of themselves rather than a mirror image. In a way it's a fictional world set in generalized areas that happen to be real but still conveying the real thinking and culture of the people of the time. That also makes it easier to ignore certain problematic realities, such as the political climate. I am certain that Shenmue III will not reference Communism at all."

Shenmue,3bfzp5,mavoti,7,Sun Jun 28 22:02:31 2015 UTC,"""1. Physical release in 3 tiers $70 for ps4 disc""  Holy crap, some people are morons.. That basically means you're giving the kickstarter money, just to get the game abit more than the usual cost.. Ye it's gonna give a lot of money to the kickstarter, but lose out on many sales..  If they'd ever add a physical for ps4, it should be like 200 dollars."
Shenmue,3bfzp5,Kitaoji,3,Mon Jun 29 03:19:52 2015 UTC,"Agreed. If they introduce PS4 physical (personally, I'm fine if they don't) it should be in the $200–300 tier range.  Just as a side note, I also think the $29 tier is way too low even for a digital download of Shenmue 3. Just taking a look at the PS Store you can see any mid-high budget games are way more than that, and even some low budget games are more."
Shenmue,3bfzp5,mfbranscombe,2,Mon Jun 29 09:10:44 2015 UTC,29 dollars is for the backers. It's too encourage funding by knowing you get the game for cheaper. I doubt the game will be that cheap when it launches.
Shenmue,3bfzp5,Basspro518,3,Mon Jun 29 10:43:50 2015 UTC,"Basically a 25 dollar game, as the cheapest to back them is 5 dollars. It's a pretty dumb price. Kickstarters should be about giving money, while getting something in return. Kinda like donating only with a benefit. Not give 29 dollars, and get the game."
Shenmue,3bfzp5,Kitaoji,1 point,Mon Jun 29 14:15:09 2015 UTC,I agree with that. Honestly I wish they introduce a ps4 version before the 3rd. I feel that will be the next big day for the ol kickstarter
Shenmue,3bfzp5,Basspro518,1 point,Mon Jun 29 14:28:39 2015 UTC,Exactly. The game was undervalued from the start. A tier of about $60 would have made more sense.

I'll be glad to get my (hopefully DRM-free) KS exclusive PC version and then will buy it again in some form to play it on PS4--hopefully physical form will be available.

It's not as simple as them streaming it on twitch. Conan's network would have to work with Sega, and I doubt it would be free for them because they charge other publishers to have their game featured, so they're not going to let Sega do it for free.   I don't see Sega really getting anything out of it unless they plan on releasing an HD collection because they aren't seeing any money from part 1 or 2 or even the kickstarter. So why would they pay to be on Conan promoting a game that was released a long time ago?  I'd love for Conan to do it, but I don't see it happening so easily.  Why don't we get a popular youtuber to play Shenmue, like Robaz or something?  TL;DR it's not as easy as streaming it on Twitch."

Shenmue,3beiib,EdenSB,1 point,Mon Jun 29 18:09:06 2015 UTC,"If the disc and the drive's lens are clean, then perhaps the laser is to blame. Optical discs are read by a laser, emitted from a laser diode. That is subject to aging, leading to decreased brightness, though I don't know the specific mechanisms involved.   Anyway, those optical drive laser diodes usually have a potentiometer (pot for short) in their vicinity. That's an adjustable resistor. If you decrease its resistance, the laser diode will receive a higher electrical current, which means more brightness. You can use that to counteract aging, or to make CD-Rs readable (they have a lower reflectivity). But don't overdo it, if the laser diode current is too high, it will burn out.  If you look around, you'll easily find articles or videos showing how to do the adjustment on the Dreamcast. I hope you have an ohmmeter to measure the pot's resistance - you should absolutely not change it blindly."
Shenmue,3beiib,rokama,1 point,Sun Jun 28 15:24:56 2015 UTC,"I actually dug mine out a couple of weeks before the Shenmue 3 announcement. I just can't find any of the wires or controller or games.

Shenmue,3beiib,Trenton182,2,Sun Jun 28 23:52:44 2015 UTC,"yeah there was just as much piracy on the PS2. and nintendo's DS, which was one of the most popular consoles ever was even easier to pirate on through R4 cards. Dreamcast failed because neither pirates nor paying customers were interested in the console on a level where it could sustain itself in the market."
Shenmue,3beiib,delukard,1 point,Mon Jun 29 02:20:45 2015 UTC,"The ps2's piracy was more expensive and less reliable, at that time dvd burning wasn't that advanced. Also the average consumer didn't knew how to use the fc mboot. So piracy didn't affect the ps2 as much as the dreamcast."
Shenmue,3beiib,Trenton182,1 point,Mon Jun 29 11:35:29 2015 UTC,"afaik, it was pretty common for non chain game stores to mod PS2's.  I do agree that it was much easier to pirate on the dreamcast- but I still stand by my point that by 2001-2002 the PS2 wasn't difficult to pirate for if you could get it modded, which most non chain stores did, as well as online mail in services (a few badly burned discs here and there, but if they're dirt cheap and replaceable to begin with...) and also that for the Dreamcast, Piracy or no, there just weren't many people that bought and used the console.  All those PS2 pirates? except for the ones in third world countries that couldn't buy non pirated games, and the ones that had serious financial problems, most pirates still bought games sometimes, just not as frequently as manufacturers and publishers would've preferred, and they usually bought them just to be able to get them on day 1 but sometimes also because of being big fans or wanting to support. and there were so many PS2 owners that the numbers made up for piracy. The Dreamcast's install base was small enough that piracy managed to lower overall sales to the extent that publishers stopped supporting it even before the end was near. EA never even bothered."
Shenmue,3bbt7j,aresef,2,Sat Jun 27 18:46:34 2015 UTC,"I think Awesome Japan's lackluster Kickstarter skills have harmed Shenmue 3 more than anything.  On the other hand, I think Sony's involvement has been the biggest thing going for Shenmue 3. It allowed the game to hit $2 million in less than 24 hours, breaking records and ensuring the game will see the light of day in some form. That E3 announcement was a marketing masterstroke."
Shenmue,3bbt7j,mjqmjq,1 point,Sun Jun 28 06:40:09 2015 UTC,"While I agree that the E3 marketing move was brilliant and made me the happiest I've ever been, ever, in any E3. After the dust settled, and with a grounded mind, I think the lack of information of the game's funding ultimately hurt the crowdfunding effort. Had it been clarified from the start, major news outlets wouldn't have used it as cannon fodder for the masses, which is what we were trying to do from the beginning. Getting the masses' attention.   The good part is, and this is just my assumption, that since this has never been done before, at least at this scale, Sony might take some part of the blame and responsibility and fully support the game to insure the game DOES NOT FAIL. It can't. It would hurt their name and the game's hopes to ever have a sequel to the 3rd installment."
Shenmue,3bbt7j,handforpleasure,2,Thu Jul 2 16:46:33 2015 UTC,"I think it did impact it slightly.  The morons that wrote tons of opinion pieces about not supporting the project probably influenced some people.  Some people are willing to die on the hill of ""Kickstarter is for crowdfunding projects only with no additional revenue streams.""  They don't like that this project has anything to do with Sony or outside funding yet conveniently forget that Bloodstained, Yooka-Laylee, Mighty No 9 (Deep Silver), hell even fucking Oculus Rift had outside funding (and was eventually sold to Facebook).  Kickstarter projects with additional outside funding, in my opinion, have a better chance of success than those who are only taking money from the Kickstarter funds and have no additional revenue streams available.  I don't know how much impact it had, maybe the appeal of Shenmue is just less than a Metroid-vania game but there has definitely been a steep drop off in funding here after the first five days.  The other problem here is that their PR guys have not been able to control the message.  The Shenmue 3 kickstarter has been communicated about as well as Microsoft's original Xbox One plans.  Yu Suzuki and co have been stuck explaining the game's funding model more than the actual game itself.  The other part has been brought up about what are we actually getting without the stretch goals versus what we are.  People are concerned that Shenmue 3 will be missing many of the charms that the previous two games had without $10MM in funding.  I think if the game came out with the same gameworld size as the previous two games but still kept the charm many people would be satisfied but are we getting that at $2MM?  Do we only get that at $10MM?  Does $10MM get us, say, a GTA-like open world while $2MM gives us a world similar to Shenmue 1 and 2?  It is something that could use explaining though I'm not really all that concerned.  They did mention on the twitch stream that they are looking into a physical PS4 release.  That to me is a massive bonus if they can pull it off and include it as a kickstarter reward.  It is something that very few kickstarters can promise, a physical console release, and may just tip the scales a little.  A physical PC release is nice but Shenmue is a console game at heart and it will really get people behind it if a physical PS4 release can be confirmed."

Shenmue,3bbt7j,Trenton182,1 point,Mon Jun 29 11:39:53 2015 UTC,"Yes i agree with you 100% the urgency is just not there....The fans such as people on this subreddit are driving the KS campaign with almost no backing from the actual bloody campaign.as much as it pains me i am actually happy people are withdrawing money and the Kicktraq page indicates a negative number eeryday as the day begins.the larger that daily negative number due to withdrawals the more chances the KS campaign people get fired and someone competent steps in(Bloodstained/Yooka-Laylee).Until then i withdrew my cash, gonna wait till the KS campaign shows managerial improvement, else will wait till the game comes out, read the reviews and then decide if i wanna buy the game"
Shenmue,3bbt7j,babubhai111,1 point,Mon Jun 29 11:47:17 2015 UTC,"I hear you and think that the milestones could have been better communicated. However, setting the goal at 2, if conservative, was the right move. It was bare minimum to have a game."
Shenmue,3bbt7j,Trenton182,1 point,Mon Jun 29 12:13:12 2015 UTC,"it was a great way to make 2 million, but not the best way to make 10 million. like a lot of people might look at the page, see that it's funded, and not look into it any more. either way, it just comes across as incoherent, but marketing is also about how you frame things i guess. like emphasizing that they raised 2 million so quickly as opposed to saying they haven't raised 10 million."
Shenmue,3bbt7j,phoenity,1 point,Mon Jun 29 13:55:57 2015 UTC,"I find the lack of faith in the creators disturbing. The man who made the masterpieces we know and love is in charge, and the minimum budget he determined has been achieved! If you don't trust that is enough, why are you even backing the man?  If people keep the ""Shenmue is going to suck because it lacks X or Y that I wanted because I know better than anyone"" attitude when it comes out though, it may hurt sales and the franchise altogether. But hey, just my 2 cents."
Shenmue,3bbt7j,phoenity,1 point,Mon Jun 29 12:39:56 2015 UTC,"We know they've reached the minimum budget, but there's a difference between that with a little extra and what would be enough for the game to be as great as we know it could be."
Shenmue,3bbt7j,onthecorner11,1 point,Mon Jun 29 12:50:27 2015 UTC,"The same could be said if the game reached $10 million in the first day, and then someone came along and said ""Imagine how great this could be if we had $50 million! It could truly be the scale of a modern open world game!"".  I think the main problem is the light people choose to see stuff, being sad or angry about what could've been is charged with negativity. We need a positive attitude, the baseline is: our beloved franchise is getting a continuation! All the extra money we can get is for the the proverbial icing on top of the cake."
Shenmue,3bbt7j,twotecks,1 point,Mon Jun 29 13:40:08 2015 UTC,"man, no offense to anyone here as you all seem level headed, but gamers are the WORST. just trolling for controversy and conspiracies 24/7."
Shenmue,3bbt7j,kl4user,2,Mon Jun 29 17:34:38 2015 UTC,I knooooooow
Shenmue,3bbt7j,mrkotfw,1 point,Mon Jun 29 17:51:42 2015 UTC,All it really did was make sure people that weren't gonna donate to the Kickstarter didn't donate to the Kickstarter.  Nothing changed.
Shenmue,3bb2a6,ryo_soad,6,Sat Jun 27 14:42:07 2015 UTC,"I'm still concerned that it sounds like we won't get a ""true"" Shenmue game like the first 2 unless we hit 10 million, which seems extremely unlikely.  Obviously anything is better than nothing, but knowing we probably won't get that legit Shenmue experience does kill my hype a little bit.  On another note, I'm so happy to hear they're still working on Ryo's face because I really hate the way it looks in the original trailer."
Shenmue,3bb2a6,IkananXIII,1 point,Sat Jun 27 15:55:50 2015 UTC,"Thanks for this. The volume was really low. Then at one point my wife wanted to talk to me about her work. Then I put it on my Xbox One and all is well.  Also, though I kind of get why they were asked again, I wish people didn't waste time with all the old questions like the funding, though it was nice to get some new answers re: Marshall and the physical PS4 version."
Shenmue,3bb2a6,aresef,1 point,Sat Jun 27 18:32:58 2015 UTC,"If be curious to know if Kickstarter is the only place to get physical releases, or if they'd be available at retail."
Shenmue,3bdi0v,wadester007,4,Sun Jun 28 04:45:23 2015 UTC,Yeah it's been brutal today. I think we're just going to have to accept what this game is going to be at 4-5 million.
Shenmue,3bdi0v,jamnesiac,1 point,Sun Jun 28 05:23:22 2015 UTC,Alot of people are gonna kick in another $30 I think on the 3rd. J want a full game and am willing to pay full game price for it.(and also the ps4 physical release will make more money happen.)
Shenmue,3bdi0v,Basspro518,2,Sun Jun 28 05:41:08 2015 UTC,"The PS4 release is probably the X factor in all of this. If it happens, there's still a shot we could get 7 or 8 million."
Shenmue,3bdi0v,jamnesiac,1 point,Sun Jun 28 06:07:58 2015 UTC,"Hey, at least it's funded. If Shenmue III ends up being at least Shenmue I level, that's fine. I think it's more than doable with modern game engines, and digital distribution will give the game legs.  We won't reach that dream of a modern AAA Shenmue, but maybe over the course of a few more sequels, we will have something very substantial in aggregate."
Shenmue,3bdi0v,Baryn,2,Wed Jul 1 18:31:29 2015 UTC,it's on minus 1000 at the mo. Does that mean people have reduced their pledges? https://www.kicktraq.com/projects/ysnet/shenmue-3/#chart-daily
Shenmue,3bdi0v,ploig,3,Sun Jun 28 08:20:55 2015 UTC,Yeah. They have been doing that.
Shenmue,3bdi0v,mfbranscombe,2,Sun Jun 28 08:57:52 2015 UTC,"The Kickstarter only earned $10,321 yesterday. I had really hoped that it wouldn't lose momentum so quickly.  Clearly, there is still time, and there are still things that can be done to get more pledges in. I hope they happen."
Shenmue,3bdi0v,mjqmjq,2,Mon Jun 29 22:31:50 2015 UTC,http://www.kicktraq.com/projects/ysnet/shenmue-3/#chart-daily  Where'd you get that data? It made $50K yesterday and $44K the day before. Today has pretty much just begun.
Shenmue,3bdi0v,Kitaoji,2,Sun Jun 28 05:36:24 2015 UTC,"I have a feeling these charts are not good, because it's been 3.7m for quite some fucking time now lol. And it's only 3.74 atm. People give, and keep taking the money back."
Shenmue,3bdi0v,babubhai111,-1,Sun Jun 28 17:19:03 2015 UTC,"Yea..I think with the way the KS has been managed more people should take their money out.With the money in the negatives it will send a strong message to YS Net to fire those idiots managing the KS.Then we can wait till the game comes out,hope that it isnt broken at launch esopecially with the track record of sony as an investor or possibly publisher(aka Driveclub).We can then proceed to read/watch reviews from multiple sources and then probably buy the game/collectors edition"
Shenmue,3bdi0v,anh86,3,Mon Jun 29 11:42:42 2015 UTC,"I think people are overreacting to the quality of the Kickstarter. You have to remember that this was not Yu Suzuki's preferred method of creating a game. He's never done this before. He didn't know what Kickstarter was before this process began. Kickstarter is a western phenomenon, they had to create a Japanese-language site that actually explains what Kickstarter is and how a Japanese person could create an account to help the project. He's relying on a third-party to create his KS project, manage it, engage with social media and keep it all together. If anyone hasn't done a good job, it's them and not YS Net. When it's time for a live stream, he shows up and they ask him questions through a translator. He doesn't have direct control over the quality of the stream, he just wants to make a good video game. He will make a good video game, he just needs to get through this funding phase so he can actually get to work. Pulling funding negatively impacts the game and serves no other purpose."
Shenmue,3bdi0v,babubhai111,0,Mon Jun 29 13:04:20 2015 UTC,"Wow a whole paragraph full of excuses for Ys Net.They should certainly hire u as PR.You do realise he is a fully grown intelligent man with lots of experience.Also most of , if not almost all of the KS campaigns that have done well have done it on their first attempt.You talk about Japanese people as if they live in a parallel dimension and have no idea whats going on around the world or know much English which is totally false.If the KS managers are rubbish that doesnt give Ys Net an excuse to not fire them.If you buy an Iphone(knowing its made in China) and then it for some reason doesnt work.Do u sit around look at a wall and make excuses in defense of apple as if Apple executives were kindergardeners being led astray by Foxconn? or would you rather get a replacement/repair/refund.If you do the former then well this whole paragraph wont make any sense to you anyway. As for hurting the campaign how is that possible they have reached their goal for a game so the game will be made.If it turns out to be a good game, +ve reviews = more people buying the game= sequel being made whenever they find the time to do another KS and the get external funding as well ,because why not. And if the game turns out to be shit, well it wouldnt be the first hiring mistake Ys Net would have made so atleast there would be consistency and you can play that game and relive the nostalgia."
Shenmue,3bdi0v,anh86,1 point,Mon Jun 29 19:09:59 2015 UTC,"I'm not making excuses or saying he's not a competent professional. At the end of the day, his company is responsible for the people representing them. All I'm saying is that it would be difficult to be in this particular situation. If I had a product that I wanted to make and the only means to that end was to develop a presence on a Japanese social medium I'd never heard of, it would be difficult for me too. I would have to rely on outside support and, not knowing the language, I would have a hard time knowing how effective they were. All of your irrelevant examples and general nastiness are unnecessary."
Shenmue,3bdi0v,babubhai111,1 point,Mon Jun 29 19:42:23 2015 UTC,"Actually they werent examples at all....more like analogies with some sarcasm involved which i agree could come across as nasty but i didnt mean it that way i think we are taking ourselves too seriously especially with regards to this KS...sure you have a problem with a non native language website and i am sure you would take appropriate action as soon as you get a hint of community unrest while your copy pasting every comment into google translate..and... If you wouldnt I am sure someone on reddit would defend you and tell the other ""nasty"" people with irrelevant analogies trolling that you're in a difficult position and please please cut you a break...would you call your own so called ""example"" irrelevant now that i've attempted to counter you using it?"
Shenmue,3bdi0v,Kitaoji,2,Mon Jun 29 20:14:41 2015 UTC,"I really don't see what issue people have with the kickstarter. People seem to overthink it so much. THe stretch goals are barely gonna be important. Besides 6m to 7.5m as those are actually things that can really improve the game, whereas all the others are just extra's."
Shenmue,3bdi0v,jamnesiac,0,Mon Jun 29 14:13:04 2015 UTC,"Well it made a ton early after those new rewards, but hardly anything the rest of the day. Either way, 50K a day isn't going to get us anywhere near that goal."
Shenmue,3bdi0v,mjqmjq,2,Sun Jun 28 06:07:11 2015 UTC,"Ok. But I don't get why it matters it's only made $1,000 today, considering the day has pretty much just begun. I assume we'll probably end up with another $25-30K by the end of the day. It looks like we're not getting an update today, so that definitely won't help.  I don't think anyone believes it'll make it to $11 million. Awesome Japan sealed the project's fate, but even a great team would've been going into uncharted territory after $5.5 million."
Shenmue,3bdi0v,jamnesiac,2,Sun Jun 28 06:13:26 2015 UTC,Yeah I was more referring to yesterday after about 10 AM. Today's numbers certainly aren't relevant yet.
Shenmue,3bdi0v,aresef,1 point,Sun Jun 28 06:32:27 2015 UTC,shrug  Party ain't over yet. People are gonna ramp it up around the 3rd and when they put up some more rewards.
Shenmue,3bdi0v,Kitaoji,1 point,Sun Jun 28 14:19:05 2015 UTC,"Ye this kickstarter sucks. Not entirely sure why so many people are crying over the kickstarter and reducing their pledges or even removing. Saying they ""lied"" to them. I see nothing wrong with their kickstarter.  8 hours left in the day and it made 4k, rofl."
Shenmue,3baloj,blitzchamp,7,Sat Jun 27 10:51:40 2015 UTC,What a fantastic podcast. I'm really impressed.
Shenmue,3baloj,ElephantStone,3,Sat Jun 27 18:50:14 2015 UTC,"Me too. Spot on about nigh everything about the Kickstarter. Like if Sony's cutting a check, who gives a shit? People phrased headlines like Sony ADMITTING like it was a huge scandal. No AAA game can be made for $2m PERIOD. It should have been obvious that they were getting help."
