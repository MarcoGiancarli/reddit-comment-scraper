These claims should be treated with the utmost suspicion.  While the button's counter ticks, there can never be peace. As long as the button continues to segregate and divide, people will continue to fight one another over the divisions it creates.

FollowersOfTheShade,37n7r5,questionmonger,2,Fri May 29 06:02:48 2015 UTC,"And yet, their pressing created more strife, as a new faction was borne of their efforts. New factions bring new conflicts, or at the very least reignite old ones.  If anything, their pressing was a result of their perverse desire to press in the red, and the subsequent fallout following the first incident with the Cassandra database.  If something must be praised as a result of this phenomenon, it is Cassandra, whose efforts have removed so many potential reds from the field. The pressers themselves remain pressers, and can only be redeemed in the eyes of some of us by actively working to destroy the button."

It will come when it comes, and we shall embrace it when it does. I merely find the efforts of the Assassins to be somewhat futile, just as is the efforts of their rivals, the Knights."

FollowersOfTheShade,35of9r,Zylamos,7,Tue May 12 06:28:04 2015 UTC,"Our position is not as secure as you may think. The longer the button goes on, the more opportunities there are to weaken the Shade and convince or trick loyal greys into pressing.  It is true that the end of the button is inevitable, but if the Knights have their way, the life of the button may be extended for such a long time that the coming of 0 has little or no meaning or impact."

That is why the threats and temptations make us stronger."

I have given the test of their loyalty my blessing, as I have stated in the original post. Nevertheless, it behooves us to strengthen the Shade as much as possible, which means fighting against those who would weaken it as much as possible.  Strength or death is our way. Do you not agree with this?  Even now there are newcomers to the Button who may yet bolster our ranks, or the ranks of our enemies. Undermining our enemies makes it easier to convince these newcomers that the Shade is the true path.   You are too kind - or perhaps weak and delusional, to try to stop them.   I would advise you not to tempt my wrath or question my faith, brother.  You are otherwise free to disagree with my decisions, here. It is your right as a Shade."

I am sure the pressers would describe us as passive, apathetic, and uninvolved, but that is most certainly not true. Especially when matters of our beliefs are discussed like now.  There are some valid points in your words. Strength or death. Preservance or fall, to ascend or to become degenerate. I still believe it is a truly personal battle each of us must fight on his own, but I have outright forgotten about the newcomers, many of them blank slates, unaware of the immensity of choice placed before them. Some of them perhaps need only a little push to realize their true potential and join us in the Shade. Their eternal souls must not be left to the mercy of pressers."

FollowersOfTheShade,34esu5,Hyflyr,6,Thu Apr 30 15:37:17 2015 UTC,"It may very well be my current greatest desire to contribute to a project such as this.   Though, I am not sure what I can offer that hasn't already been posted to, if not death, at least into a severe concussion.   I can give you my perspective so far, if that will be helpful:  I believe that the Button is, semi-intentionally, the single greatest social experiment that has ever been undertaken.   Add to that the wealth of statistical data and anecdotal content that is being documented here.   It is very possible that this subreddit and the related data will be a treasure trove of psychological, economic, and eventually historic interest in the coming years.   In fact, I want to place a very subjective and likely highly erroneous prediction that the greatest exposure the Button will ever get in the wider world media will be three years after the timer actually hits 0.  Secondly, it demonstrates that the same motivators that cause us to spend time and energy on real world tasks can easily be simulated by a low practical value result tied to a personal choice with imagined consequences.   It also demonstrates exactly how easily people can be arbitrarily organized and immediately begin to form factions, declare intents, and ponder deeper meanings.   If reddit were to, next april fool's day, give everyone a random colored flair with six variations, I predict people would act just as they have here, but with more intensity as mandatory flair would have greater exposure, and generate greater interest.   How the Button has affected me, personally:  I have been endlessly fascinated by the reactions to the phenomenon. Not by the Button itself.   For a short period I was interested in the mechanics, which little was known of at the time, and dug through the posts and marveled at the creativity and complexity of the response.   The human factor is really the most important part, to me. I have to admit I wondered for a while if I wanted a specific flair, or even purposefully get cheater flair for lulz.   In the end I decided that I was a lot more interested in reading responses and psychology texts to really bother with the button.   In the first few days after my resolution, I would stop and watch the Timer. The aesthetics are actually quite pleasing, including the lock mechanism and button color.   I then recalled a post about 'Forever Holders', who hypothetically unlock, click but don't release.   Then hold it there.   Forever, apparently.   I figured I'd give it a short go of a few hours to get the 'feel' of it. And I guess I viewed it as a furnace to test my resolve to not click.  If I was ever to imagine myself regretting being a non-presser at 0, then now would be the time to press.   I have to say it was an unexpectedly intense and personal experience.   As I watched the Timer, and held my mouse tight in hand, Button unlocked and half-clicked, many thoughts came to mind. At first rarely, and then with greater frequency as my hand began to cramp, I began to wonder what I really wanted.   Questions of: Would my hand slip? What if the browser glitched, or the mouse. Yeah, that's a pretty old mouse... the finish is rubbed off on the button tops... maybe the switches aren't as spry as they once were...  Then onto: How silly is it that I am spending hours staring at the Timer? What value is the flair, really? Will there be an April Fool's day twist? What about an interesting number? What if... while I was holding the timer dropped down to 0001, would I press?  Thoughts of the psychological aspect of the posts began to kick around with my own personal turmoil (not a lot of turmoil... but real nonetheless), and I began to identify with the emotions expressed on all parts of the spectra.  I realized the nobility of the /r/Knightsofthebutton, the carefree joviality of the early pressers, the communities that welcomed their new arbitrary members with (usually) open arms and genial discussion.   I realized that people will often, before arbitrary grouping, form groups based off of shared values, interests, and ideals.   When a great degree of arbitrary grouping occurs, then people will often justify the values of their group as their own.   Since the Button has both a measure of intent (you control your Press), and arbitrary grouping (ANYONE can be a 60s, no matter when they choose to exert that control), and the various /r/thebutton communities are not shy about communicating their values and ideals. People gravitate to one or another based on their own values and ideals, and then contribute their own creativity to the community.   Around this point I realized my hand had cramped so hard on the mouse that I had to literally grab myself by the wrist and slide my mouse off the button to the left. My clock showed that a little under three hours had passed.   I might one day wright a book about what went through my mind in that time. Final outcome: Now and Forever Grey, and a thoughtful observer of the grand pageant unfolding.   As I sift through the various community posts, I see a lot of them (including this one) have 'lost steam', with little content being posted. This may lead to a restructuring of communities, with many falling into disuse.   By their very nature the /r/knightsofthebutton and the redguard are going to be active at least until the end. As we Followers are often content in inaction, it can be said that this cool-off was inevitable.   That is really all that I can come up with now. Let me know if you have anything else specific, or want more detail on any portion."

FollowersOfTheShade,34esu5,Grumpy_Kong,1 point,Sat May 2 04:32:45 2015 UTC,"While I have no proof of this, I can conjecture that this is the exact kind of data that will be the foundation for next generation advertising.   It may be a complete coincidence, and just an interesting idea to try. Though, the rules framework of the Button seems too well designed as a social experiment.   Give a low effort challenge depending on personal choice to emotionally invest the participant. Provide a forum for them to post about their experience. Sounds like the perfect recipe for a sociology experiment. Plus, it is functionally free and comes with a huge and somewhat enthusiastic pool of participants.   And the metaphor would be more like observing animals in the wild. Hardly anyone FEELS like they are in an experiment, and most people wouldn't mind if they were."

FollowersOfTheShade,33ll2q,WC44,1 point,Thu Apr 23 14:48:15 2015 UTC,Their crusade will only strengthen my righteousness and my dedication to remain pure and unsullied by The Button.
FollowersOfTheShade,33ll2q,shellspark,1 point,Thu Apr 23 20:39:58 2015 UTC,Hah. As if anything these Pressers could say would convince me to even remove the lock!
FollowersOfTheShade,33ll2q,iorilondon,1 point,Thu Apr 23 21:57:58 2015 UTC,"This subreddit is at risk, but more importantly, so is /r/thebutton.  They will be making propaganda efforts against you, and will likely try to sway loyal greys to the Redguard."
FollowersOfTheShade,33ll2q,geckoswan,1 point,Thu Apr 23 14:50:00 2015 UTC,"The wont sway me. If what you say is true, then we have a true test of our faith ahead of us. When the battle is done, we shall see who is left standing in the shade."

FollowersOfTheShade,33eq88,The_Punicorn,2,Sun May 3 01:14:37 2015 UTC,"I must admit, I have uncovered the Lid. I do this so that I can watch as the Button's timer falls to 0, calling out for help, plea-ing to be saved, for anyone and everyone, to press, and save it. And I shall not. I shall watch with a joyous heart as the button ultimately crashes and burns, and the in the aftermath those who follow in the Shade shall be rewarded eternally!  But it has not been so pleasing. I watch, everyday, as more and more press the Button, falling into temptation and ruin fighting over measly flairs, arguing over who is the lowliest among them. It makes me sad to watch. But I know that I can not help those who fell to temptation. They were tainted beyond saving long ago. I count the days until this blight can no longer tempt those of the Shade. One day it will all be over.  But until then, my watch continues."
FollowersOfTheShade,33eq88,gummybearsyumyum,2,Wed Apr 22 07:42:42 2015 UTC,I suspect these recent posts are an attack by a Colored Faction with the attempt to divide the Shade. ಠ_ಠ
FollowersOfTheShade,33eq88,shellspark,1 point,Wed Apr 22 13:16:44 2015 UTC,"Shade was never a whole. Grays are divided from the sole beginnings - ones are pure and honest The Lid Avoiders true non-pressers-non-hoverers, and the others are lying gullible non-pressing-lid-pickupping-hovering-over-the-button scum!"
