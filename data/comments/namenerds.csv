namenerds,3e5qtf,ellumina,1 point,Wed Jul 22 04:23:56 2015 UTC,"I have encountered at least one child with each of those names except for Arya. As you said, Olivia is super common. Generally speaking, all the names you listed are at least somewhat popular. The only real names you can give a baby that would be uncommon for children nowadays are names that were popular in the past few decades. But to our generation, they are stale. Jennifer, Pamela, Karen, etc. you kinda just have to suck it up and come to terms that the name you end up choosing will probably be at least somewhat common.   That being said, Mara is my favorite."

According to babycenter.com its really skyrocketed in popularity in the last few years, being #53 for girls names for 2015 so far, but was in the 70s last year and #106 in 2013 so if it continues to trend up at that rate it could be in the top 25 for next year."

I really like Eleanor, but I don't like the Elianor spelling (it just looks incorrect to me). I really like Eliana though! Maybe that's an option? I also prefer the Aria spelling over Arya (despite my love for Game of Thrones, I just think Aria looks sweeter and more graceful). If I had to pick one out of all of your choices with their spellings, my pick is Alice. A spunky, beautiful classic that you can't go wrong with!

namenerds,3e2rt6,flapjacksal,5,Tue Jul 21 16:17:39 2015 UTC,Another thing to take into account with William Wallace is the historical figure about whom Braveheart is based.  This may be a plus or a minus for you.

Easy to spell, easy to pronounce, well known but not too popular (unlike Thomas and Nicholas).  To me, Walter is a little more ""out there"" than what you may be looking for.  I've known a 5 year old Walter for a year now and it still seems odd to me.  Speaking as someone who LIKES old fashioned names, Walter makes me think of denture cream, pants pulled up way past the belly button, and also farts.  Was trying to think WHY farts and I remembered the book, Walter the Farting Dog, which your kid's classmates will likely read.  Just something for you to consider when there are 3 other names you're debating between.  Walter isn't a bad name by ANY stretch, you just may be happier with George or one of the other two?"

Marj wouldn't be a ""creative"" shortening, it doesn't really matter how nicknames are spelt.  I don't think Marjorie Swenson is too similar to Simpson (unless she does end up Marge/Marj).

I love the fact with some names you have 10 different nicknames with it.

She came with the name Auburn, which we thought was nice considering her coloring, but our allegiance lies with a different SEC school. We like two-syllable names, and it needs to be something we can shout at her from across the yard. So far we've liked Stella, Millie, Josie, Eyeball, Hazel, and Koshka. We already have an -ella and an -illie, which is why we decided against Stella and Millie. We appreciate any suggestions!"

namenerds,3dyk3n,2ndstartotheright,7,Mon Jul 20 16:10:19 2015 UTC,"Maybe start off with having a conversation about the pronunciation of Laszlo. If you decide to go with it, you'll need a strong agreement on which way it will be pronounced.   If I were you, I would approach the conversation by just confessing that you're having anxiety about the name and explain why. I assume your husband will either respond by agreeing with your worries (in which case the two of you would probably consider other names) or by trying to find ""answers"" or ""reasons"" to stick with the name despite your concerns."
namenerds,3dyk3n,Emmylu91,5,Mon Jul 20 17:24:21 2015 UTC,"We considered Laszlo and love it, in case you want more encouragement! I also pronounce it like your husband, fwiw. I would think that trying to fight this pronunciation would be hard, bc I don't know that people would think of this as a name with multiple pronunciations, but I could be wrong.  I think at this point, you have two great contenders so I'd take an 11 day break (give or take) from name convos and see how you feel then. If you want/need to keep thinking about it, try ordering a coffee and telling them your name as Laszlo and then Taavi (on different days) and see how you react to the barista calling out your name. I did this for a name we were considering and realized that my fave girl name was hard to get right and understand quickly. I don't know that I would have realized this another way as quickly.  Good luck and update us with your choice!"
namenerds,3dyk3n,percythedog,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:28:31 2015 UTC,"Well, husband is completely against any variant of his first name, so it won't be Taavi :(  Looks like unless some other truly inspired option hits us in the next few days, it will indeed be Laszlo. I think I just need to say it out loud as much as possible (not around the kiddos) with the Americanized pronunciation and commit mentally. I did love it once, after all!"
namenerds,3dyk3n,percythedog,2,Tue Jul 21 03:28:27 2015 UTC,That's too bad about your husband not liking Taavi. Best of luck!

First off, I’ll acknowledge that Taavi is cute…. But Laszlo has a much more traditional sounding name, even for an American. It’s great because it’s uncommon but was still recognizable to my friends/fam when I introduced him. AND if you like the name Taavi, just know that my husband’s nickname has always been Laci (pronounced “Lot-see”).  I also noticed this is a little closer to that “ah” sound that you’re looking for. Don’t want to offend, but I’m not sure where the “Lahs-low” pronunciation is coming from…? My husband’s Hungarian half of the family pronounces it “Lass-low” which is closer to the “Lazz” pronunciation anyway…. Not sure why they swhtch up the A sound for the nick, but thought it might help if you’re on the fence. It’s classic! Go for it!"

I don't know where you live but if you live in an English-speaking country a name like Taavi might be really confusing to people in the pronunciation department.

namenerds,3dyk3n,a_is_for,2,Mon Jul 20 22:10:48 2015 UTC,"You should definitely tell your husband that you're having second thoughts. The sooner he knows, the sooner you guys can work on finding a new name. Have an agreement with him that if you don't find a new name that you both love, you'll use Laszlo. This way you'll have a fallback name and there's no reason for your husband to disagree, since he gets veto power. And if you wind up using Laszlo, don't worry, it will feel right when it's attached to your baby."

namenerds,3dyaw8,appleappleapplepear,9,Mon Jul 20 15:20:15 2015 UTC,"I made that switch when I went off to college. It was easier to introduce myself with my full name when meeting people that didn't have any previous history with me. It's likely that you won't be able to influence your old friends and family members (I haven't been able to!) but you can influence how you are known professionally, and you can at least ask people that already know you to make the effort to respect your wishes."
namenerds,3dyaw8,Allegretta,16,Mon Jul 20 15:37:50 2015 UTC,"I think, as others have said, introducing yourself to new people as ""Madison,"" and telling older friends and acquaintances, ""I really prefer Madison now that I'm older."" If your friends and family still call you ""Maddy,"" maybe let them know why you want to change. ""Maddy is a nickname that makes me feel like a little kid; I feel more like a Madison now."" The reasoning behind it may resonate with them more and although they may call you by the nickname out of habit, it'll help them start breaking it.  Relevant: I had a high school student whose dad's name was Richard and so was his, so all throughout grade school, middle school, and early high school, everyone called him Ricky. He realized by his junior year that Ricky sounded little kid-ish to him, so he started referring himself more as Rick. Once he told me why, I immediately stopped calling him Ricky and encouraged other teachers to try as well. Honestly, the reasoning of him wanting to present himself as older was what made it stick better. Kids still slipped up, but it progressively got better throughout the year. Just a similar situation that may help you out. :)"

Would it seem weird?  In the end, I just mentioned it in a group chat - someone used my nickname, and I said ""Can we not call me Nickname anymore - it doesn't feel like it fits me anymore, I think i've outgrown it""  And everyone was just like ""yeah, sure"".

Tell your friends you prefer to go by Madison and that they can't introduce you to other people as Maddy anymore. Tell them you really appreciate it when they use Madison.

namenerds,3dx5m1,tomato_water,2,Mon Jul 20 17:30:13 2015 UTC,"Oooo, I didn't think I'd see another Bengali in here! My family is from Bangladesh. I think the Arabic name has to do with the fact that many Muslims believe that it's more desirable to give their children a Muslim/Arabic name. There's a hadith that says which names are preferable- mostly names of the prophets, their wives, their companions, etc. Many actual Bengali names have Sanskrit roots, which may end up sounding distinctively Hindu. I know some Muslim Bengalis who avoid using Bangla names for that reason.   When it comes to most Bangladeshis though, they almost always have a ""good"" or proper name that hardly anyone ever uses and then a nickname that serves as their actual name (as is the case for my husband haha.) So a child's legal name will usually be something Arabic and then have a Bangla nickname. Like the full name could be Mohammed Imran Khan (I just made that up but I'm sure there's a few hundred people named exactly that), but everyone will call them Akash (Bengali for sky).   I specifically chose an Arabic name and then an English middle name for my son because I didn't want him to have a Bangla name (they're way too common for my liking). And what do you know? My parents/in-laws still ended up giving him a Bangla nickname haha."

namenerds,3dw1ek,molodets_molodets,19,Mon Jul 20 00:25:40 2015 UTC,"Generally speaking here, but:   It's more accepted overall to give a boys name to a girl than vice versa, and  People are more inclined to get creative with girls' names, and stay traditional with the boys'.  This opens up the options for the girls quite a bit as compared to the boys.  WHY these things are the case, I have no idea."
namenerds,3dw1ek,Ildri4,13,Mon Jul 20 00:42:15 2015 UTC,"It's sexism. Not on purpose, obviously, but sexism is still the root of it.  Girls names are more ""creative"" and boys names are more ""traditional"" because of the underlying idea that men need to be taken seriously and women don't. Boys need to be competitive in the workplace, have a strong, masculine traits and be authoritative. Girls are decorative; women are only meant to look pretty and don't need to worry about being taken seriously, professionally or intellectually, therefore they get a decorative name.   Again, I'm sure that parents don't consciously think that when choosing their child's name. That is how we're conditioned to think by society, however, and it is reflected in how we choose our children's names.   Edit: It's acceptable to give a girl a boy's name because that is naming up - she gets more authority by having a male name, and she may be viewed as being strong and independent. A boy cannot have a girl's name because that would be naming down - he would be perceived as weak for having a female name."
namenerds,3dw1ek,Gavrielle,3,Mon Jul 20 14:03:20 2015 UTC,I agree.  Unfortunately.  It's ridiculous.
namenerds,3dw1ek,Ildri4,2,Mon Jul 20 20:02:24 2015 UTC,"This is 100% why I am dead against naming girls with boys names. Until I see an equal amount of little dude Elizabeths and Vanessas running around, I will never put a boys name on a girl."
namenerds,3dw1ek,flapjacksal,4,Tue Jul 21 19:56:14 2015 UTC,"This is a really interesting theory, but do you have any sources or something? Or is this something you learned about in a class?"

namenerds,3dw1ek,Gavrielle,15,Mon Jul 20 14:58:15 2015 UTC,"Depends on the person. I find boy names way easier than girl names. I think you're just more likely to see a bias if you say ""girl names are so hard!"" - you'll get more people agreeing with you that yes they're hard vs people saying ""they aren't as hard as boy names!"" It's similar when people say ""why are girls clothes so much cuter?"" and everyone comes in talking about how adorable the little girly outfits are.    Though that does make me think... I wonder what the result would be in a poll of which is harder to name for."

namenerds,3dw1ek,Kadamba,8,Mon Jul 20 11:26:55 2015 UTC,"This is something I’ve wondered about too, and my main theory is that overall there are more familiar, “acceptable” names for girls than for boys. The pool is more limited when it comes to boy names.  Check this out: here are the top 10 names in 1904. What’s cool is that you can get the percentage of male or female babies born (and also recorded) who were given each name.  30.27% of boys born 110 years ago were given one of the top 10 names. Only 18.8% of girls born were given one of the top ten names. So almost a third of boys were named John, William, James, George, Robert, Charles, Joseph, Frank, Edward or Henry. For girls, there was just shy of a 1 in 5 chance of having a top-10 name.  Let’s jump ahead 50 years and look at 1954.  Okay, so now 32.04% of boys have a top-10 name. These names are popular! And again, a discrepancy. 22.45% of girls were given one of the 10 most popular names.  So if you had boy-girl twins in 1954 (in some town that is perfectly proportionate to the national name distribution average) and named them David and Susan Smith (both number 5 names), it would be nearly twice as likely for little Davie to be David S. in his kindergarten class.  As names have gotten more creative and rules less traditional, it has become WAY less likely for a baby to have a top-10 name. But I believe a lot of that is due to kree8tyv spellings and sounds-similar-but-is-made-up variants of top-20 names (e.g. Madisynn, Jaykob; Avabella, Kayden), and if you accounted for those, a discrepancy between gendered names might still exist.  But without proof, all I can say is the difference has narrowed SIGNIFICANTLY.  Back to the future: 2014. Now only 8% of baby boys have top 10 names, compared to 7.73% of baby girls. If I had all day, I’d go through the list and lump names into spinoff categories (like Jayden/Jaiden/Jadon, Isabella/Isabela/Izabella). But I don’t so I won’t.  I’m curious as to your thoughts on what influenced this now-narrowing gap between how many boys and girls have had top 10 names."
namenerds,3dw1ek,glorioid,2,Mon Jul 20 04:53:50 2015 UTC,Maybe it has to do with more equality between the sexes?  But I dont know enough about either topic to say something solid about it.
namenerds,3dw1ek,Kadamba,10,Mon Jul 20 11:31:25 2015 UTC,"I think it may have to do with the fact that in general, females are inherently taken less seriously in society sO there's more room to gwt a little creative. If you give a girl a bit of an out there name it's not as damaging to her future as say a boy who is expected to fit a tighter idea of what it is to be male."
namenerds,3dw1ek,awkward_thunder,3,Mon Jul 20 04:01:26 2015 UTC,I see what you're saying but found the opposite to be true for us.   Boys names were easier for us because there are so many strong names to choose from since it's considered ideal to be a man. His gender alone gives him a step up. We found there's more pressure to choose a girl name that won't hold her back more than her gender already might. Does that make sense?
namenerds,3dw1ek,jessimacar,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:58:43 2015 UTC,"I can see that but it kind of makes my point that some people want strong names for boys and as for girls, it depends on how you see the role of females in society. You obviously get it, that a silly name will hold her back in how she is veiwed. Its not expected to give a girl a strong name because strength is a trait not typically expected from girls. If you name a daughter something ""cutesy"" it's fine because girls are expected to be cute. the way see it, a lot of boys names are too traditional  for my tastes. There are at least 5 Michael's in my family. I like names that are uncommon but not weird or hard to pronounce."
namenerds,3dw1ek,awkward_thunder,2,Mon Jul 20 14:19:49 2015 UTC,Bingo!
namenerds,3dw1ek,bbbabalu,4,Mon Jul 20 06:22:03 2015 UTC,Boys definitely get the short end of the stick on 'acceptable/modern-traditional' names while girl's can have anyone under the sky it seems like.  I'm having a boy in September and it only became easier to think of name by going earlier than 17th century or so. I personally found a lot of good Shakespearian/mythological names I enjoy. I'm also a sucker for literary names for boys.
namenerds,3dw1ek,RainbowRaider,3,Mon Jul 20 02:40:09 2015 UTC,"I found the opposite was true for me.   My two boy names were solid, loved them and was excited by them.  Girl names were a bit more,  ""thats the girl name and the back up name doesnt offend me.:"

This ends up just seeming kind of odd.  The second is to choose a really unusual name, or one that has particularly strong associations with something else.  Both of these little mistakes will make people really curious about your name and ask you a lot of questions about whether it's your ""real"" name.  It seems like people who moved to the US and then changed their name from their birth name do this a lot, especially accidentally choosing a name that's really odd.  For instance, I have a male Korean friend who wanted to pick an American name so he'd fit in better.  He chose Amethyst.  Mission not really accomplished.  I've also met a Hercules.  I would stay away from Jayden and Damien.  Jayden really took off in popularity a few years ago and meeting an 18 year old Jayden would seem odd because most Jaydens are much, much younger than that.  I just looked it up, Jayden really zoomed up in popularity quickly.  It wasn't even in the top 1000 until 1994, and by 2010 it was #4.  It was #522 in 1997, which is I'm guessing when you were born.  I would also stay away from Damien.  Admittedly I like the name, but most people associate it with the evil child from The Omen.  Your best bet I think is to check out this website and click the tab ""Popular Names by Birth Year"" then type in your year of birth and select Top 500.  Most of the names on that list should be good choices for you, though you may want to stick with one in the top 300 or 200.  That advice aside, I think Joshua or Jacob would both work well for you.  I don't actually like either of them, but they'd be good choices for someone in your position and wouldn't stick out too much.  How about James, Justin, Jonathan, Jesse, Jason, Joel, or Julian?"
namenerds,3dusu8,charcuterie_bored,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:26:12 2015 UTC,Thanks for the advice.. I toyed around with Damien kinda to piss my mom off (idk why). I really like some of the suggestions you gave me. Thanks!
namenerds,3dusu8,injest_,3,Sun Jul 19 21:32:04 2015 UTC,"Damien may not be the best/most popular name because some people associate with being a little devil child (See wiki page for The Omen)  I'm gonna second what /u/WhoapJr said and check out the popular names by birth year website.  Edit: Have you considered Daniel? It's kind of similar to Damien but more classic, masculine and sexy, IMO."
namenerds,3dusu8,axel_val,2,Sun Jul 19 21:33:44 2015 UTC,"Speaking of Daniel.. My cousin is named Danny, like that's his actual name and he wants to change it to Daniel when he's 18."
namenerds,3dtu8y,Zenoasulil,14,Sun Jul 19 12:07:23 2015 UTC,"I really wouldn't go with Ulysseus, because that really does look wrong. The Latinised version of Odysseus was Ulixes or Ulysses. Adding the extra -u could be a hypercorrection of the name, I personally wouldn't go with it.  Either way, I think it's a name with a lot of weight, maybe a bit heavy for a little boy. The eponymous hero didn't exactly lead a blessed life either, I'm not so sure it's a good one to be named after...  If I had to pick, I'd go with Odysseus, but it's not my style."
namenerds,3dtu8y,LiddedPotArena,8,Sun Jul 19 12:27:18 2015 UTC,"I'd rather be a Ulysses than an Odysseus, but I can't really say why. I think maybe because there are other Ulysses, but I can only think of the one Odysseus."
namenerds,3dtu8y,Emergency_Ward,3,Sun Jul 19 12:48:48 2015 UTC,Definitely Latin!
namenerds,3dtu8y,QuirkyQbana,3,Sun Jul 19 12:46:22 2015 UTC,"I work with someone named Ulysses right now actually and it's a fun name.  Especially hearing our Mexican supervisor say it as ""oo-lissis"" haha.  Depending on where you live you might get different connotations though, like Emergency_Ward said ""there are other Ulysses but only one Odysseus"" but I can only think of one Ulysses (other than my coworker) - The president Ulysses S Grant!  Ulysseus does sound a little fake in my mind though."
namenerds,3dtu8y,axel_val,2,Sun Jul 19 16:06:23 2015 UTC,"Ulysses is one of my guilty pleasure names, I just like how it sounds.  I think it would definitely be best in the middle position, for reasons others have mentioned, though!  Odysseus is a really cool name and I think it could pass as a middle as well, but would be a LOT for a first name."
namenerds,3dtu8y,WhoapJr,3,Sun Jul 19 19:50:41 2015 UTC,"Ulysses.  But I'd not want to be either, in spite of my sincere love for The Odyssey. There's a level of pretension with both that stomps down the coolness of it.   Excellent middle name material, though."
namenerds,3dtu8y,Creepthan_Frome,2,Sun Jul 19 18:03:52 2015 UTC,Pretentious if you're using either for a kid. Fine for a dog.
namenerds,3dtu8y,frysdogseymour,1 point,Mon Jul 20 09:15:23 2015 UTC,"Ulysses is more palatable as a name, though I fully admit I would be over-the-moon excited if I encountered a real-life Odysseus."

namenerds,3dtn3l,Zenoasulil,21,Sun Jul 19 10:01:14 2015 UTC,I think it sounds like a disease or a medication.   Do you have a history with the name?
namenerds,3dtn3l,Axenus,3,Sun Jul 19 10:30:34 2015 UTC,"The name derives from the Hebrew word ""shalom"" meaning peace. The name (salome) was mentioned in the bible in mark.   From Wikipedia: The name is currently among the top 10 names given to newborn girls in 2011 in Georgia[2] and Colombia.[3] It is ranked among the top 100 names for girls in France.[4] It is less popular in the United States, where it does not rank among the top 1,000 names; just 82 newborn girls there were given the name in 2010.[5]"
namenerds,3dtn3l,Axenus,1 point,Sun Jul 19 11:02:26 2015 UTC,"I meant a personal history, something that made the name special for you. :)  Edit: I can see you've posted in other comments that it has a family connection. If you like it and it has a good meaning to you, go for it. My first thought / personal opinion is just that. And frankly there's no name I couldn't get used to if I knew a person with it."
namenerds,3dtn3l,catfishingyou,7,Sun Jul 19 21:27:09 2015 UTC,"Is it a cultural connection? I don't really like the look of it, but you could nickname her Solly or Mia, I guess."

namenerds,3dtn3l,buZZRd,5,Sun Jul 19 10:57:51 2015 UTC,"I like it. It doesn't sound like a disease to me personally.  I definitely wouldn't spell it correctly the first time hearing it though, if that matters to you. The combination of having an i and y would throw me off. I could also see that throwing off some Americans on pronouncing it for the first time. Not sure where you're from, disregard if it's easier there."
namenerds,3dtn3l,apinkelephant,3,Sun Jul 19 12:40:35 2015 UTC,"I'm Ukrainian so I had no trouble pronouncing it and I think it's lovely, but I would spell it Solomiya. I like having nickname options so Miya is a good one."
namenerds,3dtn3l,girlfrodo,4,Sun Jul 19 13:24:30 2015 UTC,"I agree with -miya being better than -myia.  I'd pronounce -miya as mee-ah, but to me -myia would be more like my-ee-ah."
namenerds,3dtn3l,WhoapJr,7,Sun Jul 19 14:47:05 2015 UTC,It made me think of the song 'O Sole Mio'   https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E2%80%99O_sole_mio
namenerds,3dtn3l,Emergency_Ward,5,Sun Jul 19 14:25:50 2015 UTC,I'm not super fond of it.  It kind of makes me think of salmonella.
namenerds,3dtn3l,potato_couch_,5,Sun Jul 19 19:49:22 2015 UTC,"Ahh, see, I would (possibly wrongly) pronounce the biblical name Salome as Sal o may.  Your pronunciation makes me think of Italian opera.  But it sounds like it's big in the Ukraine, which is cool.  If you are in America, she would get lots of people bursting into big opera libretto impersonations."

Doesn't matter how uncommon it is, you don't become Lord of the Name because you give it to one of your kids (or plan to give it to one of them in the future, since I've seen that drama too).  It's kind of doubly dumb in this case since it's a middle name.  I mean seriously, think about how many people in your daily life actually even know what your middle name is.  For most people, your middle name is nothing but a piece of personal trivia.  I couldn't tell based on what you said here, but do these people even know each other in real life, or is this just a facebook friendship?  Because this is triply dumb if they have never actually met each other."
namenerds,3ds3s9,apinkelephant,2,Sat Jul 18 22:57:18 2015 UTC,Lord of the Name. hehe  Good one...
namenerds,3ds3s9,holycrapolaness,4,Sun Jul 19 05:12:30 2015 UTC,I think they met they were talking about clothes fitting each kid so it sounds like they had visited each other at least once. So Mom 2 is the one on the right here?
namenerds,3ds3s9,apinkelephant,19,Sat Jul 18 23:06:09 2015 UTC,"I guess it would be one thing if they were close friends that hung out together or something, but if they're just facebook friends who met up at some point, this really doesn't seem like a big deal.  If there is no overlap in their friend/family group, who is even going to know about the name, let alone care?  And yeah, I don't think Mom 2 did anything wrong.  Mom 1 is being silly."
namenerds,3ds3s9,apinkelephant,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:11:11 2015 UTC,So in case I'm wrong and this are closest friends would that change your idea or still Mom 1 the bad guy here?  I'm mostly asking because there had been questions of who to ban from the group and we might put it to vote so I want to have a different take if I need to vote against one. I'm guessing you think Mom 1 should go right?
namenerds,3ds3s9,Erger,7,Sat Jul 18 23:54:08 2015 UTC,"I still don't think Mom 2 did anything wrong.  Them being close or not doesn't give ownership of the name to Mom 1.  I was just saying it's sillier if they're just facebook friends who met up once or twice and are not otherwise connected socially.  But yep, I'd stand by my stance that you don't get ownership of a name by using it, regardless of how uncommon it is."
namenerds,3ds3s9,savsavsav,2,Sun Jul 19 00:54:46 2015 UTC,Got it! Thanks!
namenerds,3ds3s9,savsavsav,14,Sun Jul 19 00:56:30 2015 UTC,"Even if they're close personal friends, it shouldn't be a big deal. In that case, I think it would be kinda cool for my kid to have the same middle name as my friend's - it could be something to bond over!  If this happened to me I might be a little miffed that my friend didn't say anything to me beforehand, or if they claimed to think of it themselves, but it didn't have to turn into a huge thing."
namenerds,3ds3s9,hitsworth,-1,Sun Jul 19 00:00:45 2015 UTC,Mom 2 didn't tell anybody she 'borrowed' the name when praised over her choices so there is that adding salt to the wound. I wish mom 1 would had just unfriended her or something if she was that furious no sure what she expected by dragging us on it :/
namenerds,3ds3s9,kaseyyeaaah,12,Sun Jul 19 00:04:32 2015 UTC,"Idk.. I don't think she should have to tell them she ""borrowed"" the name. Because I mean... It's a name, and as long as mommy number 1 didn't literally invent the name, it's free game. We all heard our childrens names somewhere at some point in time, which gave us inspiration for them. I don't see any reason not to praise her, she found a good name for her child she is happy with, and that's pretty awesome. I want to know the name though! My daughters name is a poets name too, Auden!"
namenerds,3ds3s9,fuzzybloomers,-5,Sun Jul 19 01:35:45 2015 UTC,Well is just how she put it and nope not sharing. I don't want more drama about that please and she will know I did it. The chances of this same issue happening to someone with the exact same middle name are slim to none.
namenerds,3ds3s9,Oblivinatior,3,Sun Jul 19 01:40:41 2015 UTC,"You don't want any more drama about that? I was nothing but friendly, and you made this post inviting opinion.

namenerds,3ds3s9,Oblivinatior,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:35:19 2015 UTC,Sorry I meant to say goodbye to the war not the ones answering me here. I posted it online because we were talking about voting on the issue in the group and because I'm close friends with two people involved (Mom 1 cousins and one of my costumers is friends with Mom 2) and I wanted some input. I think better when I can banter ideas with others. Not my intention to sound insensitive.
namenerds,3ds3s9,Oblivinatior,4,Mon Jul 20 17:35:36 2015 UTC,"Neither should be banned, imo."
namenerds,3ds3s9,because__science,3,Sun Jul 19 09:31:44 2015 UTC,"I think Mom 1 should be banned for starting a crazy bullshit immature fight. Mom 2 did absolutely nothing wrong, just used a name.

namenerds,3ds3s9,fuzzybloomers,1 point,Sun Jul 19 11:02:53 2015 UTC,Amen. Starting drama once means there's likely more where that came from.

namenerds,3ds3s9,2ndstartotheright,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:22:35 2015 UTC,It started on their walls but some of them had made friends from the group and one of them brought it as a question: (we do sometimes surveys about mom stuff like when did you started potty training and things like that ) Mom 1 and Mom 2 started to comment and all hell broke loose.
namenerds,3ds3s9,fuzzybloomers,0,Sun Jul 19 19:58:41 2015 UTC,"Yeesh, I'd ban whoever asked about it on the group."

namenerds,3ds3s9,Allegretta,13,Sun Jul 19 22:34:34 2015 UTC,"This is ridiculously childish. No one owns a name. The most common name advice you hear is never share a name before the baby is born because someone always has something negative to say about it and it's less likely they'll talk shit once it's attached to a child.    Unless mom 2 specifically chose the name to piss off mom 1, she's not in the wrong at all. Even if her choice was because she heard it from mom 1 and loved it. That's a fine reason to use a name. Especially because it's a middle name... when does anyone ever hear that anyway? Not a big deal at all."
namenerds,3ds3s9,fuzzybloomers,-4,Sun Jul 19 01:49:35 2015 UTC,Well that is for us to guess some people think she liked the name more than she liked the mom so even if she didn't do it to piss her of it seems she knew she was going to be pissed of so yeah...
namenerds,3ds3s9,Allegretta,0,Sun Jul 19 02:00:19 2015 UTC,"If she knew mom 1 was going to be pissed off, all the more reason that mom 2 actually really loved the name because she was willing to risk it! If she loves the name, let her have it."
namenerds,3ds3s9,fuzzybloomers,0,Sun Jul 19 17:17:15 2015 UTC,"She has it already I doubt a friend is going to be flattered of someone willing to risk their friendship over anything, but that is just me."
namenerds,3ds3s9,fuzzybloomers,0,Sun Jul 19 17:28:58 2015 UTC,"I just meant that goes to show you how much she really loves it.  She knows a friendship is in jeopardy, but she loves the name enough to risk it."
namenerds,3ds3s9,violetmemphisblue,0,Sun Jul 19 17:38:15 2015 UTC,Well she got the name and lost the friend so it all worked out as she wanted.
namenerds,3ds3s9,aquapuma,2,Sun Jul 19 17:45:15 2015 UTC,Except that now she's potentially getting banned from the group which she maybe didn't realize would be collateral. It kind of seems like you've already sided with mom 1 from the way you are replying to people here haha
namenerds,3ds3s9,kaseyyeaaah,-1,Sun Jul 19 17:55:37 2015 UTC,Heh sorry I was trying to counteract a bit. But she did responded kindly I haven't heard from Mom 2 so there is that...
namenerds,3ds3s9,aquapuma,6,Sun Jul 19 17:58:40 2015 UTC,I think it's absurd that the first mom thought no one would ever name their kids the same name - that's totally bananas. How would the obscure author feel that some random toddler has his name?! Ha!
namenerds,3ds3s9,Kadamba,0,Sun Jul 19 02:56:30 2015 UTC,Well he was around in the time of Pythagoras I think even the more strict namepsycho would think thousands of years is fair game. :p
namenerds,3ds3s9,NeenerBeaner,6,Sun Jul 19 03:40:03 2015 UTC,That's a bizarre thing to be upset about. Mom 1 needs to chill out and get over it. Especially since it's a middle name.
namenerds,3ds3s9,NeenerBeaner,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:59:35 2015 UTC,Like I said I just want it to get over with. Part of the problem is the fact that we all know now so it has become the only thing the group discusses....so boring.
namenerds,3ds3s9,mrsgrundee,9,Sun Jul 19 00:02:18 2015 UTC,"Um. Mom 2. Clearly.   There are plenty of cousins in my family with the same first names. Jr's, 3rd's etc. are a thing.   I would take it as a compliment. Mom 1 needs to get her head out of her ass. And all this over a middle name. How many people will ever even hear their middle names?!?   Sounds like some people just craving drama."

namenerds,3ds3s9,aawillma,6,Sun Jul 19 01:41:04 2015 UTC,The Name of Discord is Rigel https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rigel#Names  Mom 1 is studied Astronomy and hubby mythology so they are naming all her children after stars and constellations that also have a mythology connection. Her other 2 boys are Orion and Antares and if she has a girl she'll name her Polaris or Adara. Here is a link to some of the origins of the names. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orion_%28constellation%29#History_and_mythology https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antares#Traditional_names https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epsilon_Canis_Majoris https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polaris#Names
namenerds,3ds3s9,dmf95742,2,Sun Jul 19 14:55:19 2015 UTC,"Yay! I'm so glad you shared it!  I went through this EXACT scenario with coworkers recently - including the bit about Mom 2 keeping it a secret and the name not being as personal for Mom 2. I definitely think it's a betrayal trust to do this, but I also think that Mom 1 IS being childish for holding a grudge. I mean the kid is already named... Throwing a fit isn't going to change anything - does she want Mom 2 banned from the group or something??  Mom 1 of my coworkers eventually decided that she was glad someone else thought the name was beautiful (to Mom 2's face) and decided to be smug that the other Mom didn't have the same personal meaning (behind Mom 2's back). They're now friends again."
namenerds,3ds3s9,dmf95742,0,Sun Jul 19 16:25:53 2015 UTC,The banning talk is coming from the mods and other members. Problem is that we only have two mods and they both had picked one of the mom's side. It doesn't help that until recently this women never rocked the boat before so yeah...  I think the get back part might had being a better approach but Mom 1 didn't thought about it I guess.
namenerds,3ds3s9,Antisera,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:35:30 2015 UTC,"Wow that is crazy. That is not a bannable offense. Jesus. Do these people know each other irl?  And if this is precedent, where do the mods draw the line? Any time anyone chooses a name that has recently been chosen? Only if the name is rare by some standard of rarity? Only if the original mom gets mad? It's a ridiculous rule.  I guess mom 1 should be happy... Mom 2 will probably always associate the name with this drama now haha  Edit: I saw you say in another comment that one of them needs to be banned. If anyone gets banned it needs to be mom 1. Because as others have said, she doesn't own the name and mom 2 can't change it so mom 1 is just starting drama that a Facebook group doesn't need. Additionally, as I said above, banning mom 2 over this leaves the door open for many other ridiculous bans. Maybe instead of banning anyone, implement a new rule that says if you share a rare name and ask others to please not take the name, that members must respect that? Or that if it is a rare name and you are considering using it, ask the other mom's permission FIRST? That way there are actual rules in place and you're not banning people willy nilly."

namenerds,3ds3s9,kaseyyeaaah,0,Sun Jul 19 17:27:57 2015 UTC,This is the first time in the group where this happens so no idea if there will be seconds. :/
namenerds,3ds3s9,YoAwesomeSauce,3,Sun Jul 19 17:31:04 2015 UTC,"Wow. I'm a bit late to the game here, but I'll weigh in my opinion. I can see both perspectives pretty easily and could make a case for both moms being in the right. However, after thinking about it, I say that Mom 2 is ultimately more in the right than Mom 1. Nobody, and I mean nobody, owns a name. It doesn't matter if the name is madeup, obscure, or a deeply personal family name. There are seven billion people in this world, and it is damn near impossible to be unique, regardless of how strange a name you use. Now, would I be somewhat taken aback if somebody used my beloved name without asking me? Perhaps. But then, they have that right. Each child will be forging their own destinies and making their own friends. They may never see each other into adulthood, and people may never even know their middle names. If Mom 1 chose the name just to be ""unique"" then she picked it for the wrong reasons. If she truly loves the name and it means something to her, it shouldn't matter that another child is wearing it. Mom 1 will still have a child to proudly carry on that beloved name and it won't be any less special. You all are not teenagers anymore, and the idea of banning people and arguing over stuff like this sounds extremely childish and immature. Focus on raising your children and get over petty squabbles like this. It doesn't matter who is right or wrong. What's done is done and it's better for Mom 1 to just move on."

Mom 1 will still have a child to proudly carry on that beloved name and it won't be any less special.   I think this is a great point, and nothing else really needs to be said. Someone else having the name shouldn't make it any less special to her. You know what is making it less special? Dragging it through drama on Facebook. She's going to remember this now :/"
namenerds,3ds3s9,YoAwesomeSauce,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:32:27 2015 UTC,"Well the mom in the side of Mom 1 says something similar there are literally million of names why pick the one your friend already told you she selected for being unique? Why spoil that for her if in the end she will find other people the came to the same conclusion as her? Is a bit like picking the same dress you'll friend will use for a party. Sure is your right but why go out of your way to exercise that right?  I do agree that at this point Mom 1 was not gaining anything out of making a big deal out of it, but people are people so...  The banning is a group's problem. There is a fine line between making sure no one feeling's get hurt and echo-chambering but I'm hoping this is just a stage..."
namenerds,3ds3s9,kaseyyeaaah,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:13:55 2015 UTC,"Mom 2 loved the name. Sorry, but if I love a name, I'm going to use it. Mom 1 can't call dibs. The same goes for dresses at a prom. If you like the same red gown, nobody has any right to tell you not to wear it. Sorry, but, I'm sure Mom 2 didn't just give the name to her son as a malicious way to stab Mom 1 in the back. She probably heard the name and fell in love with it. That's a good enough reason to use it. Unless Mom 1 and 2 are sisters, or have been close friends for years, there is absolutely no reason for Mom 2 to need to spare the feelings of Mom 1. I can guarantee that if this name is not madeup, someone out there is using the same middle name. Just because they happen to be in the same stupid Facebook group doesn't make a difference."

namenerds,3ds3s9,Spookychilies,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:29:59 2015 UTC,"It's a bit more like picking the same shoes. Because most people won't notice them because they're looking at the dress (ie the baby's first name). Only they're the same shoes you're going to wear for the rest of your life so you better love them. Even if your friend loves them too. If she's truly your friend, she'll eventually forgive you because she wants you to be happy with your choice."
namenerds,3ds3s9,Spookychilies,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:51:34 2015 UTC,"Why not say ""Hey we love the same shoes! Isn't that awesome?! friends forever..."" Is the keeping quiet that made the whole problem IMO."
namenerds,3ds3s9,kaseyyeaaah,2,Sun Jul 19 17:59:47 2015 UTC,It sounds like the mom was going to be upset regardless of how the other mom broke the news to her.
namenerds,3ds3s9,Remued,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:09:41 2015 UTC,Don't know about that. If you had a friend that knew that you make the effort to order special unique shoes because she hated having the same shoes all her life if she went to tell you that she is not trying to hurt you but you really love her shoes vs showing up with the shoes out of the blue wouldn't be different?
namenerds,3ds3s9,Lilyantigone,9,Mon Jul 20 21:06:56 2015 UTC,"I think they're both in the wrong, kind of. Mom 2 should have let Mom 1 know beforehand that they were considering using the middle name and explain why (like, maybe she's also a fan of the author or she found it on her family tree or something), especially as there had been a direct question about the name. On the other hand, Mom 1 needs to realize that no name is totally unique. I mean, she got the name from someone else, too!"
namenerds,3ds3s9,ching_chong_peruna,2,Sun Jul 19 01:21:06 2015 UTC,Another good point.
namenerds,3ds3s9,Remued,11,Sun Jul 19 01:45:31 2015 UTC,"Although no one owns a name, in general I think it's pretty rude/mean/inappropriate to use a name you know someone else is really attached to. I mean, there are thousands of names out there to choose from so there's rarely a need to duplicate with someone you know.   In this case it does seem rather cruel to me especially as Mom 1 had expressed her opinion openly that she'd chosen names to be unusual. So yeah, whilst she doesn't own the name I do feel like Mom 2 has been a bit of a bitch about it (eg not answering direct questions before the birth and then calling her immature when it was pretty obvious she wasn't going to be happy about it)."
namenerds,3ds3s9,amgov,2,Sat Jul 18 23:59:03 2015 UTC,I personally wish Mom 2 wouldn't had said anything and kept the middle name as a secret I mean like you say she knew Mom 1 was not going to be happy and few people care about middle names anyway. But is too late for that :/
namenerds,3ds3s9,Oblivinatior,2,Sun Jul 19 00:01:29 2015 UTC,"Mom 1 IS being immature, and SHE is the one being a bitch.   For all you know Mom 2 chose that name before she even knew Mom 1 and just didn't say anything because clearly this would have happened either way.   And why does the fact that she's chosen names to be unusual give her the right to be upset? That's stupid.   She clearly didn't want to announce the name until the kid was born, why should this woman she only knows on facebook get a headsup? Because it's her kids MIDDLE name? No.   A cousin just used my chosen girls name. I'm pregnant, it's a boy, but prior to that I was open about my choices for both genders. While they were still struggling with their name choice. It's a uncommon name. I could EASILY say they stole it, with evidence - they were undecided when I was decided, and everyone knows it. But I'm not going to throw a hissy fit, because that'd be immature and stupid, as Mom 1 is acting.   Another cousin was going to use my boys name two years ago when she was pregnant. She had a girl. I didn't say anything. Now I'm pregnant, as I said, still using that name. She has said I stole it. Nooooope, planned on using it all along. I'm just not close to her, why would I tell her that? Besides, my reason is pretty clear, it's MY Dad's name. She was going to name her son after MY Dad, and now she's mad that I want to do that. Am I being a bitch because the name CLEARLY means more to her since she was going to use it first? LOL NOPE."

My grandma's dad was raised by his grandma and her name was Claire.

I think they sound lovely together and work wonderfully for honoring those names, which is important. At the very least, most people won't know her middle name unless she tells them, so it shouldn't really be an issue."
namenerds,3doz52,Call_me_Cassius,8,Sat Jul 18 01:57:29 2015 UTC,"It's definitely floral, but gosh it's pretty. I'm not fully grasping the relationship between Rose and Ronald other than the fact that they both start with ""Ro"". Also, maybe a way to try and offset the floralness could be to use another Rose name that isn't simply the name ""Rose"". Rosa, Rosalie, Rosalia Rosalind, Rosaline, etc."
namenerds,3doz52,ellumina,9,Sat Jul 18 02:35:45 2015 UTC,"Problem is I dislike all of the other options (plus pretty much every other R girl name).  :-/. No direct link to Ronald, but we are Jewish, so it's the initials that you usually go for in honoring names."

They're lovely together but perhaps a little too floral, have you considered Rosalie Marigold or something?  You could still call her Rose but I think Rosalie tones down the floral theme substantially.  Oh and it does not seem hippyish to me at all."
namenerds,3doz52,harleyqueenzel,2,Sat Jul 18 04:02:00 2015 UTC,I love it! Marigold Blossom is also a combination that's quite floral but equally beautiful. Somewhat related: friends of mine named their daughter Scarlet Rose :)

namenerds,3dp54d,NeenerBeaner,7,Sat Jul 18 03:03:38 2015 UTC,I knew a Roxanne and can verify that this happened all the time.
namenerds,3dp54d,__sesame__,10,Sat Jul 18 03:44:12 2015 UTC,"Though I love the song, I wouldn't let it dissuade you from the name. Roxanne is a really strong name, and even though the song is famous enough that your daughter will probably at least hear of it (if she ever googles her name, for example, it's gonna come up), it's not the kind of thing that's going to haunt her. I don't think it'll be a strong connection for people her age."
namenerds,3dp54d,molodets_molodets,5,Sat Jul 18 03:02:44 2015 UTC,Roxana is also pretty and doesn't have as much of the song reference.
namenerds,3dp54d,wholikespancakes,3,Sat Jul 18 04:12:01 2015 UTC,I don't know the song. I work with a Roxanne called Roxy and she's pretty cool. I rink its bad ass. You could always just name your kid Roxy!
namenerds,3dp54d,I_eat_lemons,3,Sat Jul 18 02:50:04 2015 UTC,"I think the name is the thing people will think of when they first hear the name (I'm currently singing the song in my head!) and even if her peers haven't heard of it, I reckon anyone she meets who was born after about 1985 will potentially sing it to her thinking they're being awfully clever.   However, I think it is a really great name and that you shouldn't let that dissuade you from using it. People who know her (her family, social group, school friends, co-workers, etc) will very quickly associate her with the name rather than the song. So it'll only be the odd random stranger who sings the song and she can just smile politely to them and move on (source: my name is the title of a pretty rare song from the 50s and I get it sung to me a couple of times a year!)"
namenerds,3dp54d,aquapuma,3,Sat Jul 18 06:24:57 2015 UTC,"Think of all the other name songs- Caroline, Jude, Lucy, Maria, more that I'm sure I'm going to be remembering all day.   I think that 1) most kids won't have heard them. It'll be 2020 or later by the time your kid is in kindergarten. Maybe in middle school/high school someone will make the connection because that's when kids explore music, but it can be a good thing. Boys can woo her with a rendition ;)"
namenerds,3dp54d,kaylatastikk,3,Sat Jul 18 16:48:09 2015 UTC,Boys can woo her with a rendition ;)   This would be very romantic until you listen to the words and realize it's a song about prostitution!

Yes it came out a long time ago, but it's been repopularized several times in pop culture by movies like Moulin Rouge. It's pretty much ""the"" Roxanne reference, so there's going to be a lot of people who think of it when they hear that name. I don't think it should necessarily stop you from using it, but it's not as old or uncommon of an association as some people are making it out to be."

The attitude in this song spoiled a really nice name for me. :/  Oh well, that is life."

namenerds,3dp54d,east_side_sunsets,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:25:21 2015 UTC,"I think it's a perfectly fine name, and I doubt kids these days will hear the song often enough to make the identification automatic."

namenerds,3doh57,nikkichita,7,Sat Jul 18 00:05:13 2015 UTC,"Intuitively that is the pronunciation I would go with based on your spelling, however I am sure that you will come across people who are confused by it and try to say it one of the other ways, so I would probably spell it more how it sounds, Jayna. I do think it's a very pretty sounding name though, and unique enough that it might pair nicely will a more classic middle name, for example Jaena Marie, Jaena Lynn, Jaena Rae, Jaena Rose."
namenerds,3doh57,perplexing123,8,Sat Jul 18 00:14:50 2015 UTC,Kind of. I prefer just spelling it Jayna.
namenerds,3doh57,miss_galaxy,6,Sat Jul 18 02:46:41 2015 UTC,I like the spelling but my brain also read it as Jeana first.
namenerds,3doh57,WhoapJr,4,Sat Jul 18 03:33:47 2015 UTC,"I think Jayna would be your best bet.  On first glance, I thought Jaena was Janae.  Jayna seems to have less opportunity for mispronunciation as well."
namenerds,3doh57,EBofEB,2,Sat Jul 18 04:03:53 2015 UTC,It's very weird and will be prone to misspelling.  I would probably hear it as Jeana when spelled.

I'd choose Jaina or Jayna, as suggested by /u/nikkichita, over using Jaena. Pronunciation seems more intuitive and they look cleaner. I will give my middle name suggestions for the Jaena spelling though:   Jaena Alice Jaena Catherine Jaena Chloe Jaena Danielle Jaena Evelyn Jaena Grace Jaena Hazel Jaena Iris Jaena Ivy Jaena Josephine Jaena Lucy/Lucille Jaena Mary Jaena Noelle Jaena Olive Jaena Ruby Jaena Scarlett Jaena Sophie Jaena Therese Jaena Violet"

namenerds,3dkx00,injest_,2,Fri Jul 17 06:04:41 2015 UTC,"I think Laszlo is really nice and knew nothing about the cartoon until I just looked it up.  Personally, I wouldn't be too worried about a cartoon that ran for 3 seasons and finished up in 2008.  If it helps, I don't know anything about Zoltan either, except that I think it's nice!  Erno is not my favorite, I'd prefer one of the other two.  Laszlo has the benefit of being a name probably most Americans have heard before, where as Erno and Zoltan are more unusual.  Laszlo also seems to be easier to pronounce based on the spelling.  Good luck!"
namenerds,3dkx00,WhoapJr,2,Fri Jul 17 06:24:46 2015 UTC,I like it.  It's not hard to pronounce and it will be distinctive in an American classroom without being weird.

namenerds,3dkx00,Poefi,1 point,Fri Jul 17 10:03:34 2015 UTC,"I like Ernő. Some might have trouble with it in the United States, but it does not seem that difficult.

He'll definitely have to deal with pronunciation issues throughout his life, but that goes for anyone with a more ethnic-sounding name. My last name is quite Italian and I've had to correct people my whole like, but it's totally nbd. The punctuation over the 'o' may get tricky when the name is types, but I don't think that's something to be overly concerned with.   I also adore the name László. I have no idea what the cartoon monkey refers to and neither will his peers."

Not one I've ever heard before, but not really strange looking or anything.  Maybe you can use the accent when you're writing in Hungarian (if that's an issue) or in a formal setting like on a birth announcement or wedding invite but leave it off the birth certificate and the official name you give his school to avoid difficulty?"

My great-grandmother was named Lillian and no one ever called her Lily.  When I said Lillian has a botanical feel because of Lily, I meant because it contains that sound, not because you have to call her that or because people will automatically call her that or anything.  Edit: Silly me, I thought you'd been considering Lillian and then changed your mind because of Lily being so popular.  Don't want ya to feel like I'm shoving you towards Lillian!

namenerds,3ditvn,travel_and_champagne,11,Thu Jul 16 16:52:05 2015 UTC,I see Niko frequently as a shortname for Nikolai (a fairly popular name where I am at)
namenerds,3ditvn,cpfay,8,Thu Jul 16 17:03:22 2015 UTC,I love that name. I named my son Dominic and wanted to use Nico as his nickname but my brother called him Domo and that stuck. I tried! Lol
namenerds,3ditvn,momcantdecide,6,Thu Jul 16 17:31:21 2015 UTC,"I think Nico is probably a lot more popular than you realize.  Just looked it up on the SSA website and last year it was #456, it's been steadily increasing in popularity for years.  In 2000, it was in the 800s.  So no, I do not think it is weird and won't get you strange looks.  The only thing I think could cause problems is the spelling of Niko.  It will probably be misspelled as Nico, plus the k looks feminine to me.  I've heard of girls with the name before, so it may be something for you to consider.  I actually named a baby bird Nico about 5 years ago when I didn't know if it was a boy or a girl."
namenerds,3ditvn,WhoapJr,6,Thu Jul 16 17:38:31 2015 UTC,"It doesn't sound weird at all to me, even if you don't have the right ""background"". Don't give up on a name you love just because you're worried some people might not like it. I like Niko, it has a lovely meaning and the advantage of being rare in North America (I'm European and over here it's a pretty common name/nickname)."
namenerds,3ditvn,Aefensteorra,3,Thu Jul 16 17:04:06 2015 UTC,"I particularly like the meaning of Niko as it relates to victory, since my first name also has a victory-related meaning."
namenerds,3ditvn,snikkih5,3,Thu Jul 16 17:25:25 2015 UTC,What about Nicolai or Dominic? Something that shortens to Niko.
namenerds,3ditvn,chibighibli,5,Thu Jul 16 21:23:02 2015 UTC,"We're naming our little girl Nicola, Nico for short (due next week!), so I've done some research into Nico/Niko. It's Greek in origin, but has been adopted pretty widely across Europe, especially Eastern Europe and the Mediterranean region-- so if you're like most Americans and are a mostly Euro-mutt you shouldn't have to worry about being culturally irrelevant. It still hasn't caught on over here in the US, despite there being a big trend in short names ending in ""o"", which is a bonus in my book. It's not very popular but isn't obscure either, the best of both worlds."
namenerds,3ditvn,chibighibli,3,Thu Jul 16 19:26:42 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the additional info, and congrats on your little girl!"

namenerds,3ditvn,ReginaGloriana,2,Thu Jul 16 19:29:57 2015 UTC,"Niko isn't too weird. If he thinks it's weird, he can always go by Nik if he really wants to...The other names on your list don't really have the same feel, to me. They're all really cute and lovely (I personally really love Ollie) but they all seem kind of main-stream and more popular, while Niko verges on being a bit off-beat, if that makes sense. There's nothing wrong with that, but since the other four names kind of fit a classic theme, you might want to make sure you really love Niko, as it is slightly different, if that makes sense..."
namenerds,3ditvn,ArtisticD,2,Thu Jul 16 17:43:33 2015 UTC,"I absolutely know what you mean in terms of Niko being off-beat. Finding any name that we both feel strongly about has been difficult. We've crossed off a few more unusual names, like Asher, and have bopped around between the names listed above. Because of that, we won't rush into naming him, but thankfully we still have a couple more months to really decide."
namenerds,3ditvn,awkward_thunder,2,Thu Jul 16 18:05:20 2015 UTC,"Niko isn't too weird, but it's not my favorite.  I keep thinking of a story a teacher told about her sons naming their dog this only for their grandmother in the Middle East to freak out because (supposedly) it was an Arabic cuss word.   My favorites on your list are Benedict (love!) and Oliver.  I do not like Logan, and as to Jack...Jack is handsome but I would prefer it as  a nickname for John."

I wouldn't worry about that though as I am sure most Arabic speaking people living in Western countries have heard of Niko as a name and would be fine with it.  I personally love the name Niko. We will be naming our son Nicolas, nn Niko. My dad's side is dutch, and my great grandfather was Nicolaas - but always went by Niko <3"

namenerds,3ditvn,rabidfawn,3,Fri Jul 17 00:44:54 2015 UTC,I wouldn't think Niko was weird coming from a white couple. It's not overly ethnic sounding at all.   One rather unfortunate association though is that Niko was the name of the main character in one of the Grand Theft Auto games. Just something to keep in mind but it doesn't ruin the name by any means.

I actually have four initials myself (coincidentally two of which are WS), I rarely ever have to write out all 4 of them in any official capacity.

namenerds,3dj588,vousetesbelles,27,Thu Jul 16 19:58:32 2015 UTC,"Honestly, it makes me of the McCain/Palin campaign, and I just hear Sarah Palin saying it.  That association ruins it for me, but it may be a plus for people on that end of the political spectrum."
namenerds,3dj588,Ildri4,8,Fri Jul 17 01:55:19 2015 UTC,"Came here to say basically this. I can't even read the word ""Maverick"" without hearing it in Sarah Palin's obnoxious voice.   Fortunately, if you did name your son that, it wouldn't be relevant knowledge for anyone of his age group. Only parents and teachers would probably even make the connection."

namenerds,3dj588,tortugastation,11,Thu Jul 16 21:22:59 2015 UTC,"Maverick is a guilty pleasure for me. However, it's not a name I would personally use as a first name. I don't think it would be too bad as a middle name. The main issue is that the meaning is a bit ""loaded"". Imagine a really awkward, shy, and nerdy kid with the name? It just seems like one of those names where you have to be cool to pull it off. I also think that while it sounds very cool on a teenager, I can't imagine it on a serious adult. Something like Edward Maverick would be much better, since the cool factor of Maverick would spruce up the traditional Edward, without sounding like you are trying too hard.   But that being said, it's not the worst name a person could have. I'd much rather meet a Maverick spelled correctly, than a crazy made-up or misspelled name. I also think as ""cool"" names go, it's better than something like Ace. Ultimately, it's up to you. Your son will grow into his name and people will learn to accept and embrace the name when it's associated with a person. So if you truly like it, go for it."
namenerds,3dj588,Allegretta,30,Thu Jul 16 23:15:57 2015 UTC,"Aside from the heavy association with sarah palin, Maverick just strikes me as the type of name a teen mom would give her kid because it sounds cool. Maybe use it as a middle name instead."

How about the guy responsible for health & safety at your company? Or your airline pilot!

It's ballsy and a lot of people are going to be scared to take the risk themselves but in reality if I met someone named Maverick I wouldn't laugh or think ""oh that's weird"". I'd think ""that's actually a cool name"".   And I read some nonsense about Ricky as a nickname. I'd call him Mav and we'd be bros."
namenerds,3dj588,Axenus,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:24:53 2015 UTC,"Thanks. I am glad that everyone doesn't think it is horrible. I guess it is one of those names that you either hate or you love. I guess I thought my fellow name-nerds would love it because it's different. Oh, and Mav would def be the nickname."

I hate that good names like this one are downvoted for being different or unusual meanwhile other names like Braydon, which I'm sorry is trailer trash looking and I can't get over it, are fawned over here. Maybe the population of namenerds is getting a bit young and we need to put xxs, ks, and ys, in every name to satisfy them. That or choose old british names like Henry.  /endrant"

I get that it has a certain cowboy/cool-guy/rule breaker connotation, but that was in 1986!! Seriously, 30 years later and it still has that appeal? I am not the parent who wants to name their kid some trendy name (no offense) that 4 other boys in his class will share.   I am at a loss for a name that fits our style. I like Gabriel, he doesn't. He likes Colt, I don't. I tend to lean towards more traditional/biblical names while he tends to lean towards last names as first names or very obscure old names.   We need options! Please help!"
namenerds,3dio34,TyQuil,20,Thu Jul 16 16:09:42 2015 UTC,"My guess on pronunciation would be YAH-dee-el.  My first impression would be that it sounds made up (which I'm not a fan of).  I see from googling that it isn't, so I'd be wrong, but that is my honest first thought."
namenerds,3dio34,apinkelephant,17,Thu Jul 16 16:36:24 2015 UTC,"Huh, my first thought was that it was probably, like, Yiddish."
namenerds,3dio34,jrl2014,3,Thu Jul 16 17:36:37 2015 UTC,"I haven't been exposed to much of anything Yiddish, so that connection wasn't there for me."
namenerds,3dio34,apinkelephant,3,Thu Jul 16 19:48:48 2015 UTC,"It is apparently a Jewish name, I thought the same as well."
namenerds,3dio34,bystandling,2,Fri Jul 17 00:57:41 2015 UTC,This is the correct pronunciation.  It's a Jewish name; it roughly translates to 'God is my hand' or 'God is my guide' (ידיאל.)
namenerds,3dio34,SirInfamousOne,9,Thu Jul 16 20:15:16 2015 UTC,"I would pronounce it ""yah-dyel"", or /'ja.djɛl/ if you prefer IPA. It reminds me of Hebrew/biblical names."
namenerds,3dio34,Aefensteorra,3,Thu Jul 16 16:53:31 2015 UTC,I feel like we need a pronunciation reference in the sidebar because I never know how to read those and have to look it up every time anyways haha
namenerds,3dio34,fuzzybloomers,5,Fri Jul 17 13:27:20 2015 UTC,"I'd think yay-dee-el. My first assumption would be that the kid was Jewish, tbh. It's got the same ending as Gabriel and Uriel, so I'd assume it's an Old Testament archangel name. If not Jewish, then Catholic. It's got strong religious connotations for me. But in a good way! I love angel names."
namenerds,3dio34,Call_me_Cassius,3,Thu Jul 16 18:45:05 2015 UTC,I'd probably think Ya-dyell (like Daniel) or Ya-Di-ell (like Gabriel)
namenerds,3dio34,Erger,2,Thu Jul 16 21:25:24 2015 UTC,"Exactly how I'd think to pronounce it. I wouldn't like the American English spin on it, my white friends would hate saying it."
namenerds,3dio34,corkscrew_heart,3,Fri Jul 17 00:41:33 2015 UTC,"My immediate thought, without looking it up or anything, is it's of religious origin or some similar significance. I'd pronounce it ""Ya-deal"". Which when written phonetically, seems odd, but when said aloud it doesn't seem so strange."
namenerds,3dio34,charcuterie_bored,2,Thu Jul 16 18:43:56 2015 UTC,Yah-dee-el  Kind of similar to Ariel.

Caleb John -I like this too but it's not my first choice cuz Caleb is so popular these days. And if he goes to school with lots of other Calebs he might become CJ to differentiate himself. I know people either love or hate initial NNs, so just something to keep in mind."
namenerds,3dii4s,charcuterie_bored,5,Thu Jul 16 17:08:15 2015 UTC,I actually hadn't thought of initials! Thanks!

namenerds,3dii4s,ceose,4,Thu Jul 16 16:13:36 2015 UTC,What about Caleb Dean? Those are two of my very favorite names.  I was actually going to name my son that but didn't in the end.  His middle name is Dean but we used a different first name.
namenerds,3dii4s,WhoapJr,3,Thu Jul 16 19:20:59 2015 UTC,"Caleb Glenn :)  I'm very fond of Caleb, if I ever have a second son, he'll probably be Caleb.  I picked Glenn just because it's a little less common than John, but Caleb John and Caleb Dean are really nice, too."

namenerds,3dii4s,dakrdbcd,2,Thu Jul 16 20:09:58 2015 UTC,Caleb John. Either Cal or CJ as a nickname.
namenerds,3dii4s,cuntbubbles,4,Fri Jul 17 19:02:30 2015 UTC,Definitely Caleb. I teach elementary school and it seems like every single grade level has at least two Jacobs.

I don't think my school has any Calebs though. It could be my area though; every area has its own quirks. In the end, if you're ok with your son going by Jacob R. for his school career then go for it!"
namenerds,3dii4s,chickadee_delight,3,Thu Jul 16 17:47:19 2015 UTC,Jacob Dean (I'd even go with J.D.). I think Caleb is a bit over played right now!
namenerds,3di5gb,whycantwebenice,15,Thu Jul 16 13:43:38 2015 UTC,"My favorite is Jane Marie. I'm not sure about your area, but Maryjane is slang for pot where I live. I'm not a huge fan of Evan at all, but I love Elizabeth and Mara as middle names, and coincidentally those are the names of my sister and mother."
namenerds,3di5gb,belleonhertoes,15,Thu Jul 16 14:31:01 2015 UTC,"Woo, Jean/Jane Marie! I'd never expect to see either of those.  On a side note - I'm pretty sure naming a daughter Evan is basically naming her John."
namenerds,3di5gb,Creepthan_Frome,3,Thu Jul 16 15:46:08 2015 UTC,"I love Jane, Husband loves Jean. Both we feel are known but uncommon!"
namenerds,3di5gb,Creepthan_Frome,3,Thu Jul 16 19:10:05 2015 UTC,Indeed! There's also something to be said for the equally lovely and simple Joan and Jill.
namenerds,3di5gb,Spookychilies,32,Thu Jul 16 19:46:38 2015 UTC,Maryjane is not a good idea because Maryjane is usually used as a term for marijuana.  I generally despise the boys' names used for girls trend because it doesn't go the other way for boys.  Jean Marie and Jane Marie get my vote.
namenerds,3di5gb,Hanner12,14,Thu Jul 16 13:52:19 2015 UTC,"I don't really like Evan as a girl's name. However, could you maybe switch the order since with your list you seem to really like Evan?  Eliza Evan  Mara Evan  Elizabeth Evan  I think those three are cute and then if she likes Evan better she could go by her middle name."
namenerds,3di5gb,RaineyDays,4,Thu Jul 16 14:26:38 2015 UTC,"Ooh, I like Eliza Evan when put that way, I think it flows much better."
namenerds,3di5gb,percythedog,10,Thu Jul 16 17:31:37 2015 UTC,"Jean Marie sounds fresh and unexpected! (Confession, this is my name!) I love it. Easy to spell and recognize but very uncommon!"
namenerds,3di5gb,LiquidFromAStream,6,Thu Jul 16 14:02:13 2015 UTC,Jean Marie for sure!   Boys names for girls; please no.
namenerds,3di5gb,WhoapJr,7,Thu Jul 16 16:24:52 2015 UTC,"I'm going with Jane Marie, beautiful and timeless!"
namenerds,3di5gb,jediwife,6,Thu Jul 16 17:52:30 2015 UTC,"I'm generally not a fan of boys names for girls so Evan isn't winning me over. I really do like the name Mara though. Mara Jean could work (although it could be too close to Maryjane which I probably would avoid as other people already stated). I don't like the flow of Mara Eliza because of the ""a"" at the end, but what about Mara Elise for something similar?"
namenerds,3di5gb,glorioid,3,Thu Jul 16 18:38:06 2015 UTC,"I am not a fan of traditionally male names on girls. I'm old-fashioned like that. So I can't get with Evan. Why not Eliza Jean, or Elizabeth Mara, or something like that?  Jean Marie and Jane Marie are my favourites on your list. I also kind of feel iffy about alliterative names (if by ""pronounced like Joffrey"" you mean it starts with a J sound), but I don't think it's necessarily bad and it wouldn't be rhyme-y in this case. I love that Jane, and especially Jean, are rather unexpected names right now--they're both due for a revival. Here in Canada, when you see Jean it's usually an elderly woman or a middle-aged French-Canadian man. But it's a nice name with a lot of history.  Maryjane, while I would like to like it, is just too marijuana-y."
namenerds,3di5gb,Aefensteorra,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:55:03 2015 UTC,Thanks for your input! I believe we are settling on Jane :)
namenerds,3di5gb,jerseycowboy,3,Fri Jul 17 13:26:39 2015 UTC,"I like Jane Marie and Evan Eliza. By the way, in French Jean-Marie is a boy's name!"

I'm partial to Henry as it's one of those classic names that everyone knows, but few children have these days. I also like Harrison for the same reasons, but I tend to think of it as more of a surname than a first name.  Everett and Ethan Are more popular names from my experience, so if having another Ethan/Everett or two in his class is something you want to avoid I might stay away from those. I've also been seeing more Donovans and Adrians lately, but not to the same extent as Ethan or Everett. Overall my vote would be Henry William, or maybe Henry Everett!"
namenerds,3dj25h,Aktaie,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:16:31 2015 UTC,"Thanks! I agree, I really like the names Ethan and Everett but I am worried about their rise in popularity."

The biggest issues I've run into are having to include your last initial or looking over every time someone calls for someone else with the same name :) If you're really in love with those I'd say go for it!   Otherwise, maybe another strong 'E' name that's a bit less popular would work? Easton, Eames, Edmund, Elliot, or even something like Ian that has an E sound?"
namenerds,3dj25h,dakrdbcd,2,Thu Jul 16 19:23:41 2015 UTC,"I also grew up with a popular time, although it has fallen back in popularity a lot but I had to go by ""First name Last Initial"" or by nickname so I understand it's not the worst thing in the world. Thanks!"
namenerds,3dj25h,rubyder,3,Thu Jul 16 20:16:46 2015 UTC,Henry William is my vote. I also like Adrian Michael.

namenerds,3did82,WhoapJr,6,Thu Jul 16 15:02:47 2015 UTC,"All of these are beautiful, the only one I'd possibly avoid based on the awesomeness of your other choices is Adeline.  It's cute and pretty but I think on the trendy side.  I think I like Eliza June best, but only because those happen to be two of my favorite names.  The others are all lovely as well and I like the idea of you using Leona, you don't see many little Leonas running around.  Perhaps Leona June?"
namenerds,3did82,QueenSoup,2,Thu Jul 16 17:54:43 2015 UTC,I second Leona June! It seems like it would flow with any last name too.
namenerds,3did82,percythedog,6,Fri Jul 17 00:55:42 2015 UTC,"I like all the names.  Leona is sweet sounding to me while an Eliza sounds more spunky.

namenerds,3did82,Allegretta,2,Thu Jul 16 14:52:57 2015 UTC,"Thanks! Yeah, I love Adeline but not crazy about Addy. I guess it's probably unavoidable, though..."

namenerds,3did82,WhoapJr,4,Thu Jul 16 18:59:58 2015 UTC,"I guess I'm one of the very few who doesn't care for Leona. To me, it's a grandma name.  However, I don't think of Eliza, Jane, or Adeline as grandma names, even though they are just as classic. Go figure."
namenerds,3did82,cmcg1227,3,Thu Jul 16 23:52:24 2015 UTC,"I love Jane, I think its so cute. So, Jane Beatrice is my favorite. I also think Beatrice is really cute - especially with the NN ""Bea"", if you wanted to consider that as a first name. I really like how classic Jane is, as well as how pretty it sounds. Janie is a cute nn too!  Otherwise I think I really like Leona - either with Rose or Jane (I have a preference for Jane because its less common than Rose, but I also think Rose is very pretty. I definitely think Leona will age well (as will Jane), more so than Eliza or Adeline. I also think its a perfectly unique name - not ""out there"" at all, but also not common.   Honestly while Jane Beatrice is my favorite, I think depending on your style Leona may be a better choice, if that makes sense. Leona just isn't a name I would/could use, but I would use Jane, which is why I picked it as my top choice."
namenerds,3did82,WhoapJr,3,Thu Jul 16 15:35:22 2015 UTC,"Why wouldn't Eliza age well?  Too me it's one of those names that works on anyone, especially adults."
namenerds,3did82,cmcg1227,3,Thu Jul 16 17:59:44 2015 UTC,"Its not that it doesn't age well, it just doesn't age as well as Leona or Jane, IMO. Its likely just my own bias, but I can picture an Eliza very well as a child, but less so as an adult."
namenerds,3did82,PrahaPrincess,2,Thu Jul 16 18:08:20 2015 UTC,"Oh, okay :)  To me, Eliza is a grandma name (I like grandma names) so it ages VERY well in my mind.  Everyone's different, though!  I'm with you on Adeline and Jane though.  If I have a little girl, her name will probably be Jane."
namenerds,3did82,injest_,2,Thu Jul 16 18:12:27 2015 UTC,"I ADORE Jane as a first name, but my only misgiving is that it might sound a tad strange with my last name...something about it being so short and both ending in -n, I think. I'm definitely not willing to give up on it yet, though."

namenerds,3did82,ReginaGloriana,2,Thu Jul 16 15:33:19 2015 UTC,I just love Leona. It's my grandmother's name and seems so timeless to me. Either of the middle names you've paired it with are lovely.

namenerds,3dinyu,DoublePlusGoodly,26,Thu Jul 16 16:08:44 2015 UTC,I don't like Kallisti at all.   Kallista is okay but I prefer it spelled Callista.
namenerds,3dinyu,charcuterie_bored,34,Thu Jul 16 17:15:39 2015 UTC,"Please use Callista!  The i at the end of Kallisti is just not good.  Kallista is a great improvement, but spell it with a C and you have a fantastic name :)  I'm not fond of the gratuitous K in names, it makes it look misspelled, juvenile, and trendy."
namenerds,3dinyu,WhoapJr,7,Thu Jul 16 18:04:59 2015 UTC,"Usually I would agree with the K looking juvenille, but in this case, the k is used in the Greek origin of the name (as per the golden apple in the myth of the judgement of Paris). I appreciate the feedback."
namenerds,3dinyu,WhoapJr,13,Thu Jul 16 19:11:42 2015 UTC,"Ah okay, I see.  I'd still go with Callista, personally, but it's up to you of course."
namenerds,3dinyu,ReginaGloriana,6,Thu Jul 16 19:21:58 2015 UTC,"In that case, have you considered Kallisto/Callisto?    Thing is, most English speakers spell the name with a C as per Latinate transliterations.  I do have some knowledge of Ancient Greek so I like both spellings, but I get the feeling that for many, the K spelling might be pedantic, recognized as accurate only by a few.  It would be like naming a child after Achilles but spelling it more like Akhilleos - only someone attempting a literal translation of the Iliad would spell it that way."
namenerds,3dinyu,ReginaGloriana,2,Thu Jul 16 20:25:07 2015 UTC,"But Kallisto/Callisto would be the male variant, wouldn't they? And, I appreciate your perspective on the spelling variations - very helpful!"
namenerds,3dinyu,vokietija,13,Thu Jul 16 20:31:14 2015 UTC,"No, in fact Kallisto/Callisto is the feminine form, unless you're Italian in which case it would be male.  I don't think Callista is actually from the original Greek...it's a modern feminine form.    Going from the original Greek and Latin, Callistus/Callixtus/Kallistos is the masculine.   Edit - I also suspect Kalliste is an old feminine form."
namenerds,3dinyu,girlfrodo,4,Thu Jul 16 20:38:30 2015 UTC,"If you want to keep with the Greek, why not Kallisto/Callisto? Then you can have both Kallie/Callie and Tonie as nicknames."
namenerds,3dinyu,nikkichita,12,Thu Jul 16 21:49:30 2015 UTC,"Of the two, Kallista. Far prefer the Callista/Calista spelling though - does it have to be a K? Could have the nickname Lissie."
namenerds,3dinyu,Allegretta,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:38:10 2015 UTC,"The K keeps with the Greek mythological origin of the name. But, I will consider the alternate spelling. Thanks for the nickname suggestion as well."
namenerds,3dinyu,jgonz85,12,Thu Jul 16 19:16:17 2015 UTC,"Definitely prefer Calista over Kallista, but up to you, Kallisti reminds me too much of Khaleesi like Game of Thrones. For nicknames, I love Liss/Lissie/Lissa, you can use Al/Ali/Allie, Cal, or even Izzy."
namenerds,3dinyu,idiotsonfire,10,Thu Jul 16 17:55:47 2015 UTC,"I, too, prefer it spelled Callista, and would go for that over Kallisti/Callisti. You could also call her ""Calla/Kalla"" which is a flower. You could also go with Lissie or even Lily at a stretch."
namenerds,3dinyu,travel_and_champagne,5,Thu Jul 16 18:54:42 2015 UTC,I prefer Kallista.
namenerds,3dinyu,g33kch1c,6,Thu Jul 16 16:38:28 2015 UTC,"Kallista, but the spelling of Callista is probably the best option.  Calli is a very easy nickname, and a possible unfortunate implication I can see being drawn with 'Kallie' is being further shortened to 'Kali,' which isn't the best thing."
namenerds,3dinyu,broadzillajones,4,Thu Jul 16 17:50:52 2015 UTC,"I would go with Kallista. Maybe you could call her ""Kay""?"
namenerds,3dinyu,ogcllr,5,Thu Jul 16 16:55:22 2015 UTC,"I feel like Kallisti could easily be mistaken for Kristi. I am a Kristi and a receptionist. Despite saying my name clearly, I have been called Vicky and Misty many times. Not a big deal, just one of those things that might happen. That being said, I don't like Kallisti at all.  Also, with GoT being so popular, it might be mistaken or heard as Khaleesi. Hey, you never know. People are weird.   I would vote for Kallista.. but as Calista/Callista."
namenerds,3dinyu,ReginaGloriana,2,Thu Jul 16 21:40:01 2015 UTC,"One reminds me of Game of Thrones, the other reminds me of Miles from Tomorrowland."
namenerds,3dinyu,rbesaw,0,Thu Jul 16 18:02:22 2015 UTC,"Game of Thrones, I'm familiar with, but will have to look up the Tomorrowland reference. The name/word is actually from Greek mythology. Thank you for your perspective.  Edit: I get the Tomorrowland reference now - nice catch! Callisto is the male variant of Callista (I think the C spellings come from Roman mythology, and the K spelling from Greek mythology). Callisto is also the name of one of Jupiter's moons."
namenerds,3dinyu,mrsgrundee,8,Thu Jul 16 19:13:16 2015 UTC,"Kallisto is actually feminine, as someone already mentioned; o can be a female ending in Greek (q.v. Juno).   Just putting out there that if you want the K for philological reasons, ending it with -a doesn't make a lot of sense."
namenerds,3dinyu,Tedis,2,Thu Jul 16 20:42:24 2015 UTC,Kallista...I've never actually heard of Kallisti.  Is it meant to be a conjugated form of Kallista?
namenerds,3dinyu,sailor_emily,2,Thu Jul 16 20:26:42 2015 UTC,I love the name Kallista with a K! I actually had an old friend in grade school with the same name and spelling.
namenerds,3dinyu,violetmemphisblue,2,Fri Jul 17 14:22:08 2015 UTC,"Kallista, Kallisti to me sounds like a made-up/uunikkqueee version of Khaleesi, and it would bother me if people always asked about ""Khaleesi"" or mentioned how similar they are if my kid was ""Kallisti.""  I agree with the other posters that I prefer it with a ""C""  instead of the ""K,"" but I see that you want to keep the ""K"" for certain reasons."
namenerds,3die1l,clickitout,9,Thu Jul 16 14:54:43 2015 UTC,Afsen for a middle name is cool. Or maybe Aften as a form of Afton that still nods to your grandpa's name.
namenerds,3die1l,LeonardoDiCatrio,5,Thu Jul 16 17:21:52 2015 UTC,Came here to suggest Afsen as a middle name. Aften works as well.
namenerds,3die1l,MisoPlas,5,Thu Jul 16 18:50:53 2015 UTC,"Hmm that is a tough one. It's a little bit of a stretch, but how about Alfie or Alfred? They're still pretty unusual (although Alfie was really popular in the UK recently, I think), but recognizable."
namenerds,3die1l,compton_cityof,4,Thu Jul 16 15:19:17 2015 UTC,How about just using Afsenski for the middle name?
namenerds,3die1l,WhoapJr,2,Thu Jul 16 18:01:12 2015 UTC,"Afra?  Middle, please."
namenerds,3die1l,Emergency_Ward,2,Thu Jul 16 15:47:38 2015 UTC,Afsenski doesn't really lend itself to any first names that I can think of. It's an odd combination of letters that aren't really common in English. I keep trying to think of names but not much is similar except for the first initial A.   Alessandro  Alfred  Alfie  Abel  Addison  Adrian  Adonis  Alfonso  Alastair
namenerds,3djgs0,ellumina,7,Thu Jul 16 19:37:29 2015 UTC,"Depends on how strongly related to the culture it is. If it's one of the more iconic names or has a particularly strong religious or cultural meaning, I would avoid it. If it's a name that is relatively easy to spell/pronounce in your own culture/language and just happens to be from elsewhere, I think it's perfectly fine."
namenerds,3djgs0,ooples_and_banoonoos,4,Thu Jul 16 20:04:17 2015 UTC,"Well, I got a name from a different culture - Indonesian name, Flemish girl - and people generally seem to like it. It does sound similar to a set of more common western-European names, which I guess makes acceptance easier. The (admittely very few) Indonesian people I have met actually really liked my name an didn't think of it as cultural appropriation at all. I love my cross-cultural name!"
namenerds,3djgs0,LiddedPotArena,4,Thu Jul 16 19:58:46 2015 UTC,"That's great to hear :) I'm glad it works for you and that there's no issue surrounding it! I generally try my best to narrow down my favorites names to ones that aren't overly ""ethnic"", but I've been crushing on Fiorenza lately after visiting Italy and wonder if it'd be pushing it for someone who isn't Italian ><"
namenerds,3djgs0,WhoapJr,5,Thu Jul 16 20:05:46 2015 UTC,"Already replied, but I think Fiorenza is really pretty and would be fine for your daughter!"
namenerds,3djgs0,WhoapJr,4,Thu Jul 16 20:58:43 2015 UTC,"I would not think twice if I met a Chinese-American child named Francesca, Matteo, or Katarina.  It may be worth it to choose a name that's easy to pronounce/spell by Americans, and perhaps avoid super stereotypical names, but I think an American child of any background (other than ""my other parent is from Germany/Russia"") named Guenther or Igor would be kind of odd."
namenerds,3djgs0,violetmemphisblue,2,Thu Jul 16 20:56:59 2015 UTC,"I don't think there's a problem with it. It would be so boring if everyone had to strictly name within their national/cultural confines... Having said that, I think it's generally worth considering how easy a name is to pronounce in the local/dominant language. Like, there are some really great, beautiful Icelandic names. But some of them may be difficult for the average American to say, and if you don't have any Icelandic heritage, you may just be setting your kid up for a lifetime of having their name mispronounced and misspelled..."
namenerds,3djgs0,Invalides,1 point,Fri Jul 17 04:02:25 2015 UTC,"I think it all depends. A German named Francois would be odd to me. People should name their child however they wish but I personally like to name my child within my fiancé and i's heritage. In the U.S. It really seems like there are so few rules compared to France, so maybe I would think less about it if we only had the U.S. to worry about.  I would encourage you to explore names and see if something you like from another culture fits."
namenerds,3djgs0,istara,1 point,Sun Jul 19 06:43:24 2015 UTC,"Generally I think it's fine, unless the name has a super weird spelling/pronunciation in English.  Calling an English/Anglo kid Soraya or Bilal or Miyako - fine, whatever.  Calling them Kryszytyna or Eaoiîelhhdh is just foolish."
namenerds,3djgs0,ivegotbabyrabies,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:41:18 2015 UTC,"I don't think anything of it - look at all of the popular Irish names used on non-irish origin children.  It surprised me that my husband was really against using names that wasn't our background (he doesn't like Irish or Italian names on jewish kids, apparently....)  Using a traditionally Asian name on a non-Asian might be a little odd, now that I think of it, to switch your scenario around.  Something like Chin or Hideki might be out of place on a german kid."
namenerds,3djgs0,jrl2014,2,Thu Jul 16 21:05:42 2015 UTC,"I sorta agree with your opinion, but it makes me wonder why? Why is it generally more acceptable to use an Irish name on a non Irish child, but not so acceptable to use a Chinese name on a non Chinese child?"
namenerds,3djgs0,Invalides,2,Fri Jul 17 04:01:31 2015 UTC,"Irish names might not be the best example, but basically its acceptable for you to use an Italian name because in the West, Italian first names/Roman stuff was highbrow culture. Since the West colonized parts of China, still stereotypes Asia and has disgusting ""orientalist"" appropriation, that's why its not cool to use a Chinese name on a child with no connection to China.  Its basically a question of power. Its not appropriation for anyone whose society has gotten the short end of the colonialism stick to use a Western name."
namenerds,3djgs0,Call_me_Cassius,2,Fri Jul 17 21:31:23 2015 UTC,"I think it has to do with immigration in the 19th and 20th and the fact that these languages have basically the same alphabet, so it turns into a bit of a melting pot and rules tend to go out the window. China is a relatively isolated culture and hasn't immigrated in as large of waves. Also, I personally don't know many Chinese names because many Chinese I know adopt American names for facility. Martin is easier for Americans than Yangtien."
namenerds,3dg4i6,SonOfHender,10,Thu Jul 16 00:24:05 2015 UTC,"You two should both privately make a list of like 20 or so names and then compare to see if anything overlaps.   Also, never start planning around a middle name. MNs are so rarely used. First name and how it pairs with the last name is infinitely more important."

He gets called Percival when he's in trouble.  I think it's a cute cat name but unfortunately don't think it has the best associations as a human name.  Percy Weasley pretty much nailed the view I had of the name before even reading the books.  I do know of two children (one a boy, one a girl) named Perseverance and both go by Percy.  Can't think of any other longer forms of the name, but it may be a good idea to give him a formal name to fall back on in case he doesn't want to be called Percy.  I'm pretty lenient with what I consider reasonable nicknames to be for any given name, so if you wanted to, you could probably pick any P name and have Percy be the nickname."

It's maybe a stretch, but it's not the longest stretch I've ever seen...but as to my reaction to the name: I first think of Percy Jackson and Percy Weasley. However, Jackson might not be popular in even five years time and while HP probably will be, Percy was not a super prominent character.

Don't give in just because it's the only name he can come up with, especially since you don't sound sold on it; if he wants to pick the name then he can help you come up with a good one, but don't feel pressured to go with the first or only name he likes.  That's not fair to you or the kid.  If you use Exia because it's the only one he likes, then use Alara too.  Alara Exia. Though I really urge you to try to find something besides Exia, I really do."

He knew his client would be the victim of public scorn and regardless of the outcome of the matter he was making a black man call a white woman a liar in one of the worst times for black people in history.   As a lawyer my needs NEVER come before a clients and it is ny job to explain all of the risks a client faces. In this particular space of history it include managing their media outcomes.

Something you have to remember is that while you should picture your child's name on a doctor or lawyer or engineer, you should also picture it on a chubby, acne ridden teenager working at McDonald's. I just finished reading a book about two teenagers named Aristotle and Dante and while it works out for the characters in question, both of them struggle with the legacy of their names. I find the fact that I'm named after my grandmother and have to live up to her stressful. Even if you just like the name, there's still history and hell of a legacy to live with there. And while it's positive, unlike say, Adolf, it's still a hell of a lot to live with.   While I'm sure you're not, it sounds like people trying to be intellectual and sophisticated. And it seems on the way other end of the spectrum from Kestrel Fern, which seems like a very hippie, nature based name.  Ultimately it's your call and you'll know what's right for your baby.   Other Names-  Leonardo/Leo/Leonid- I'd avoid Leopold even though I like it, because it reminds of Leopold II.

I think Galileo has too strong of a link to the scientist. Are you prepared to sign up your son to discuss why he's named Galileo every day of his life?

The same way that you get Elizabeth -> 'liz' -> Lizzy, you'd get Elizabeth -> Beth -> Bertie. IMO anyway.  Sometimes names dont perfectly match their nicknames, think like Jack/Jonathon, Dick/Richard, I think a little Elizabeth called Bertie would be lovely!  I also like Beatrice - It's my Grandmother's name, but she hates it!"
namenerds,3dbo03,izzit5yet,2,Wed Jul 15 12:46:19 2015 UTC,Jack comes from John and is seperate from the name Jonathan as far as I know. I do agree with you on the rest :)
namenerds,3dbo03,thatpurplegirl,3,Wed Jul 15 13:15:07 2015 UTC,"I was mistaken thinking that John was short for jonathon, and hence Jack would've been a twice-removed nickname, but I was wrong - oops! x"

I looked it up on behind the name to be sure and Jonathan is indeed a Hebrew name coming from the Bible (a son of Saul).  However it does list your spelling, Jonathon as a legitimate spelling variation, which is nice because I never saw it spelled with an -o, I thought the only spelling debate was about the -h :)"

I am not sure about Winston because of the cigarette association, but that probably shows my age.  I'm sure it's a nice place name for most people.  I do like Remington, and Colten is OK though I prefer it with a second O.  They do have gun associations, but I've got a Remington 1911 in my closet so that's not a bad thing to me.  It's something to be aware of, though.  I think Remy makes a nice nickname."

namenerds,3d9stj,asiankim,2,Wed Jul 15 08:49:09 2015 UTC,All of these names have been shut down by my dear husbeast.   He's got a weird nickname stipulation (name has to be able to be shortened) as well as have a great meaning behind it.   He wants something unique and powerful too.

Of course if we were having a daughter that was already chosen and we were both completely happy lol...Once we learned he was a boy we dabbled and looked at other names...but to my husband everything is either ""old"" or ""hipster""   Then after our middle name drama we reconsidered Lucas again....but we just can't find anything we like better."

Earlier in a post on here someone recommended me tying him to a chair and forcing at least five he was okay with.   I did, and he came up with Jarvis, Raziel, Colton, Grayson and Isaac.   I fell in love with a couple, but then the next day he was not in favor of them. Damn bridezilla.   Everyone including him keeps telling me that ""it will come"" but I don't think some people understand that actually FINDING the baby name actually ties together the whole pregnancy for some people. I mean, it would be great to be able to say my child's name. I've grown tired of ""Good Morning, baby"" or ""I love you so much baby"" >_>"

All except Alexander Biblical, I dont know if you mind that?  Isaac isnt that popular, but it is very trendy in some areas and a well known classic, so if you dont like Biblical names I would love to think up some more names who are more in the classic but not too trendy territory, or any other style you like. :)"

I call him the namezilla, comparable to the bridezilla.   Names must be able to be shortened and have an acceptable nickname (Vincent = Vin/Vinny) < this has been vetoed due to an unacceptable nickname... Names must have great meaning behind them No family names Names must have powerful, mighty, unique, epicness to it. (Maximus, Leonidas, Apollo, Thor, Odin all vetoed)   He actually came home today and said he was warming up to Kal'El.  (Please hear me out before judgement)   We're both gamers, comic book home bodies. I'm an islander and I honestly feel like we're old enough now to be able to get away with a name like Kal'El.    Only people into comics and such even movies would only know the origin of Kal'El It sounds ""island-ish"" enough to say, hey he's got some islander in him anyways. Nickname would be Kal.   Is this too out there? What do you think if you heard it first hand?"
namenerds,3d9stj,NewMotherNature27,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:51:00 2015 UTC,"If Vin is not okay, how about Vince? I personally love that nickname.  Isaac means ""laughter"" if I am not mistaken so that is a nice meaning. :)  Haha it is kind of funny that the name must have an epicness to it, and names that are that to me are names your husband thinks of as not epic enough (Maximilian maybe? Alexander for Alexander the Great? Thor was/is pretty mighty...).  I dislike apostrophes in names, so that is the first thing. Other than that I am very used to out there, unique names (I have one myself, and tons of my friends. I could PM you there names if you want) so I think they are fine. Only thing that would bug me beside the apostrophe and the 2 capitol letters is that it is so associated with the one Kal'El... Just like Galileo is only one person for example, so is Kal'El. And I dont know if I would appreciate having such an obvious namesake. What if he doesnt like his own namesake? And I think Kal'El is obvious enough that most people in the US would know where it comes from.  Other than all those words of caution, I do like the nickname Kal.  Personally my route would be to pick a traditional name from the island you are from, that would be awesome and totally epic imo :)"

But those have been shut down. Clark and Franklin would be a no go (because family members)  He knows I'm somewhat partial to the Greek names, but Apollo, Atlas, and Adonis were thrown out.

Maximus is too ""mainstream"" for him (and he doesn't like the nn)  Dominic, Darren, Darian, Vance, Jaxon, Grayson, Kal'El, Mason, Dante, Tyrion, Tiberius, and Vance have also been denied.   Yeah...

Hearing the name I would assume a boy, not a girl, but it also sounds like a nerdy kid who gets bullied (or, like in Fairly Odd Parents, a mismatched name for a bully.) Jesse- For me Jesse is masculine and Jessie is feminine. I would assume, reading or hearing the name, that Jesse was a boy, but also wouldn't be surprised to meet a girl. Masculine, to me. Gabriel- This is 100% masculine. Gabrielle is feminine, Gabriel is masculine. Thing it's a very strong name and would definitely think a little less of parents who would name a girl Gabriel. Casey- My little sister's name is a spelling variant of this, so my first thought is always feminine, but my second thought is of Kasey Kahne, so I definitely wouldn't bat an eye at a guy named Casey. Peyton- I know three girl Peytons, and the only male Peyton I know is Peyton Manning. I definitely consider it more of a girl name."
namenerds,3dal2i,Call_me_Cassius,6,Wed Jul 15 00:13:34 2015 UTC,"The only one that I'd think ""hmm, I wonder if that is a boy or a girl?"" is Peyton."
namenerds,3dal2i,emwater,3,Tue Jul 14 22:48:18 2015 UTC,"Francis for boys and Frances for girls. Despite that distinction, IMO Francis is a more ""feminine"" boys name. I don't why I think that, but I do.  Jesse and Gabriel are not feminine in the least.  Casey and Peyton are both unisex names. I've known both boys and girls who have them.  Peyton is too trendy for my taste."
namenerds,3dal2i,Helena_MT,3,Tue Jul 14 20:29:56 2015 UTC,"Francis: The few Frances' that I've known were all women. So I do find it a bit feminine.   Jesse: I associate it more with men. The first person I think about it actually Uncle Jesse from Full House.  Gabriel: totally masculine to me. The feminine would be Gabrielle, and pronounced differently.   Casey: I'm in between with this one. I've known male Caseys and also many female Kaseys (nickname for Kasandra/Cassandra)    Peyton: masculine because I think of Peyton Manning."
namenerds,3dal2i,Ron_Weasley_,3,Tue Jul 14 22:18:04 2015 UTC,"-Francis: Definitely a boy with this spelling. It's the same name of the current pope who is a very popular figure. That's what it immediately makes me think of now.  -Jesse: Again, definitely a boy with this spelling. Jessie would be for girls. This name makes me think of Uncle Jesse from Full House (John Stamos), Jesse from Breaking Bad (Aaron Paul), Jesse (Rory's sexiest boyfriend) on Gilmore Girls (Milo Ventimiglia).  -Gabriel: 100% a boys name. I went to school with many boys named Gabriel (or NN Gabe). The pronunciation is so different than Gabrielle.  -Casey: This definitely strikes me as a girl name. That ending sound is so feminine. So many girls name have that sound (Lacy, Macy, Katy, Molly, Haley, Amy, etc.)  -Peyton: This name is actually 100% unisex to me. I've never personally known a man nor a woman named Peyton. However, Peyton Manning is a pretty huge name in football, so I imagine in the US people might perceive it as more masculine."
namenerds,3dal2i,charcuterie_bored,3,Wed Jul 15 01:10:08 2015 UTC,"Francis - This can go either way for me. It is a bit softer and feminine as a boy's name, and a bit on the old-fashioned side, but I don't immediately think girl when I hear it.  Jesse - Despite this sounding like Jessie, it seems very masculine to me.  Gabriel - Completely strong and masculine.  Casey - This is another true unisex name that can go both ways. Being that my husband has a name similar to this, I still see it as masculine.  Peyton - I think it sounds masculine, but it's become popular as a girl's name. Either way, it's a bit on the trendy side."
namenerds,3dal2i,Allegretta,2,Wed Jul 15 20:56:10 2015 UTC,"To me Gabriel is very masculine, no question about it.  Gabrielle/Gabriela are good feminine versions.  A girl named Gabriel would probably get a sigh out of me.  Jesse and Francis are masculine, but I think can work for a girl.  I would wonder why the parents didn't spell them Jessie and Frances, though.  Casey and Peyton are gender neutral to me, with Peyton leaning more towards feminine."
namenerds,3dal2i,WhoapJr,2,Thu Jul 16 19:23:14 2015 UTC,"The first thought that came into my head when reading these names:   Francis - Male when written down with this spelling, but would probably assume female if I heard it out loud with no context (I've met more female Frances' than male Francis' in real life).

namenerds,3dal2i,ooples_and_banoonoos,2,Wed Jul 15 04:46:57 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say Casey is particularly feminine but it's definitely unisex - like Robin. The others all sound male to me, except Peyton, I've never met anyone with that name and don't really have an association with it."
namenerds,3dal2i,g33kch1c,2,Wed Jul 15 14:59:25 2015 UTC,Casey and Peyton are feminine in my book.
namenerds,3dal2i,jewel1997,2,Wed Jul 15 15:20:59 2015 UTC,"Francis: on paper it is masculine, but I think the fact the the male and female version are still pronounced the same way makes it seem feminine. Although the only Francis I have ever met is a guy, so I would probably assume it was male because of that association.  Jesse: this name comes across as pretty masculine to me, probably because it is a standalone name for a boy and a girl going by Jessie is usually named Jessica. Gabriel: definitely a masculine name. To my ear Gabriel and Gabrielle sound completely different.  Casey and Peyton: these two land in the unisex category for me. I have never met a Peyton and I know a female Casey, but to me neither name is particularly masculine or feminine."
namenerds,3dal2i,istara,2,Wed Jul 15 16:37:50 2015 UTC,"Francis - 100% male (Frances is the female name)  Jesse - male, but obviously sounds like Jessica  Gabriel - 100% male, and Gabe is very manly  Casey - male, but I think you get girls called similar  Peyton - 100% female, and an awful name to boot"
namenerds,3dal2i,nikkichita,2,Wed Jul 15 17:04:31 2015 UTC,"Just a note, Gabriel is very masculine sounding when pronounced in English, but for Spanish speakers, the pronunciation is more akin to Gabrielle, which could be potentially confusing."
namenerds,3dal2i,injest_,4,Wed Jul 15 18:24:16 2015 UTC,"Francis: kind of feminine, but because Frances has fallen out of common use, I think it could work for a boy, especially if paired with a strong middle name Jesse: doesn't feel particularly feminine to me Gabriel: not feminine at all, literally 0% feminine Casey: a bit feminine but I think it works for both genders Peyton: despite the fact that the most famous person with this name is a male football player, I have a difficult time imagining it on a boy; this name is almost completely feminine to me   Why does your friend think that Gabriel is feminine? Are they confusing it with Gabrielle (the girl version of Gabriel)?"
namenerds,3dal2i,girlnamethrowaway,0,Thu Jul 16 16:02:04 2015 UTC,"I don't know. It's not terribly common around where we live.

namenerds,3d9893,awkward_thunder,7,Tue Jul 14 14:18:34 2015 UTC,"So it's nothing at all to do with parents picking a name for their child and everything to do with hospitals using indistinct identifiers for neonates.  (Even when you go into the hospital knowing the kid's name, that's not what goes on the ID bracelets.)"
namenerds,3d9893,Grave_Girl,3,Tue Jul 14 16:56:50 2015 UTC,"Yep, this is exactly the issue.  We picked out my daughter's name months before she was born.  One of the first questions from the midwives after her birth was, ""What's her name?""  Her hospital bracelet still said Babygirl (Lastname)."
namenerds,3d9893,apinkelephant,3,Tue Jul 14 18:09:37 2015 UTC,A better convention might be the way Icelandic surnames work: an unnamed baby girl of Jane Doe would be Janesdaughter Doe for the duration of the hospital stay. That way it's obviously a placeholder name and ties the baby to the parents.
namenerds,3d9893,maimonides,5,Tue Jul 14 17:53:13 2015 UTC,This is not even remotely true. The hospital does not care about baby's name (I mean that in the nicest way). Your nurses may ask out of curiosity and to be nice and to call baby by his/her name around you. But in no way is that how we identify baby. It is ALWAYS based on moms name.
namenerds,3d9893,rainy-daisies,2,Tue Jul 14 20:19:02 2015 UTC,"Hm, this is interesting. My hospital automatically made our daughter babygirl last name, even though we had a name picked out for her. We didn't fill in her birth certificate or anything until over 24 hours after she was born.   I wonder if automatically referring to the baby by last name helps with that at all."
namenerds,3d9893,momonomicon,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:31:54 2015 UTC,"My hospital already has my baby's initial bands printed and in my file (I saw them at preregistration).

namenerds,3dacol,Happygirl16,2,Tue Jul 14 21:11:40 2015 UTC,My SIL is named Parker after a family surname. I like it for a boy or a girl and with a masculine or feminine middle to disambiguate you should be good to go.

I may do this for my future kids, but as a middle name.  If you can't convince your husband to use Parker for the first name, he would hopefully be on board with it as a middle.  Good luck!"

namenerds,3da2cr,charcuterie_bored,2,Tue Jul 14 18:02:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I am partial to that one. Although now that I am thinking this through more -- Justice comes from my husband's side, as did my daughter's middle name, so maybe it would be good to pull from my side -- and there is a Jayna from my side who I would love to honor. So, maybe Juniper Jayna?"
namenerds,3da2cr,Oblivinatior,2,Tue Jul 14 18:35:01 2015 UTC,I prefer Juniper Jayne/Jane. One syllable for the MN kind of balances out the length of Juniper. Juniper Jayna is a bit clunky.

Aurora Blaire is nice too- I've always wanted to name a daughter Aurora with the nn Rory :)  For the boys I think Morgan goes well with all of them. Elliot Morgan is my favorite for sure.

Double edit: I forgot to mention that I really loved the sound of Rose-a-lind, but didn't want to give my hypothetical girl-child a name with ""wrong"" pronunciation, so I was thinking instead I'd go with Rosamond (like Rosamond Oliver in Jane Eyre, ""rose of the world indeed"").

namenerds,3d6v13,Call_me_Cassius,7,Tue Jul 14 00:03:13 2015 UTC,Two Ts looks more feminine to me.  I actually love Elliott as a girl's name thanks to Scrubs!

Although I've also heard of people spelling it Elliette, which is also very feminine but definitely a break from the more traditional spellings.  Since Elliot is more commonly a boy's name I would definitely stick with a more feminine MN such as Grace. IMO, Harper and Quinn are too masculine to be paired with Elliot for a girl."

Elliot/Elliott is currently being given to more girls than boys, and this is not the first time it's trended for girls. There's also the relatively well-known Elliott from Scrubs contributing to its popularity as a unisex name. Elliot/Elliott has soft sounds that could befit a boy or a girl. Richard is much harsher, so it's not being given to girls, but if it was, especially if it was being given to more girls, then yes, Richard would be unisex."

So I would definitely go with Solomon, it is a wonderful name and Sol as a nickname is lovely.  Both the nickname and the full name have a lovely meaning (Solomon=peace, Sol=sun), it is an old classic name, not used that much but still familiar. What more could you want in a name? :)"
namenerds,3d529n,Ron_Weasley_,2,Wed Jul 15 15:04:38 2015 UTC,"True, it does have that connotation for most people. But I was just offering it as a suggestion to the OP because they received feedback that Solomon sounded like ""an old Jewish name"". (Btw OP, the more obviously Jewish name would be Shalom/Sholom/Shlomo. Solomon actually sounds pretty Biblical to me.)  As for Salem, I think of the cat from Sabrina the teenage witch...which is also a witchy association, but it's not really a negative for me.  Regardless, I do agree with you that Solomon is a fine name."
namenerds,3d529n,Kadamba,2,Wed Jul 15 23:28:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah to be honest I like the sound of Salem a lot, I just cant get over the association.  Shalom is also really nice, just clearly Jewish.

I agree with you about Jemma and Jameson being a bad pairing, and I think both Jameson and Jackson are very trendy and would be so much nicer as James and Jack.

namenerds,3d6gnt,Allegretta,3,Mon Jul 13 22:38:49 2015 UTC,"We're still undecided on G or J. The only reason we're leaning toward J is because my name begins with J.

My advice: if you like it, then go with it. Plus, I know a girl going for her PhD in sciences right now named Jemma. I don't think anyone has blinked twice about her spelling.

When we got home she decided she didn't like that name and named her something different. So to family and everyone who met her before she went to preschool, she was called by the new name. At school she was known as the name on her birth certificate. It wasn't until about she was 16 her friends would come over and it would be so weird to hear them call her by her original name because that's what is on her birth certificate and needed for school. She does indeed go by two different names till this day lol."

Felicity sounds so sophisticated to me. Let's just ignore the fact I also watch the TV show Arrow.   I never really thought about Aubrey and Harvey sounding similar-ish and both ending in -ey and they don't really flow. But, they are their own people and I don't think I would freak out about having children whose names clash. Something to think about though! Thanks!"

I had a couple of girls and then we were SHOCKED to find out our third would be a boy. I know exactly what you're feeling!

It's already happening, but I expect it to become even more ubiquitous.   Charlotte, Violet, Scarlet, Juliet will lead the charge for girls, with Bridget, Elisabet, Garnet, Harriet and Janet all making gains as well. I think the frillier versions - Cosette, Colette, Yvette, etc. - will become hyper-common as middle names.   Everett, Emmett, Bennett, Beckett, Rhett, Wyatt for boys will all sky-rocket as part of the Southern trend. Garrett, Jarrett, and Jett will gain ground as a somewhat trashier take on the trend. And Benedict, Albert, Gilbert will make gains among the hipster crowd.   Elliot for both boys and girls will enter the top 25."

Not just Robert or Jon- I mean Catelyn (which I think is a variant spelling), Melisandre, Brynden, etc. GRRM does a great job of taking common names and giving them a fantasy twist, which makes it easier for people to feel comfortable using them. Some of them, I believe, are also just old versions of common names."

Also, this is probably a local phenomenon, but Duncan is about to explode in the Chicago area, due to NHL star Duncan Keith. I already know several couples planning to name sons after him. Charlotte will probably be the #1 name soon across the Anglophone world, as both Chelsea Clinton and the Duchess of Cambridge have daughters by that name, and it's already hugely popular. Adding to the Game of Thrones idea mentioned in this thread, I think we'll definitely see Sansa and Brienne appear on the charts as the show/books continue. Ultimately, I think children's names will continue to diversify, with a smaller and smaller percentage of kids born being named the top-ranking names."

I don't think it should be a problem. I'd advise against Sasha if for no other reason that because your husband is eventually going to have to tell Sasha the name, and even though you wouldn't be naming the kid after him, I know if I was Sasha I would find it weird. Sasha also seems to fit stylistically with the last name the least. Emile would be my second favorite, as long as one of you compromises on the pronunciation.

namenerds,3d257k,MsBaltimore,6,Mon Jul 13 21:41:01 2015 UTC,I think all but Beau for your boy names sound very feminine. Not sure where you live (American here) so it may be cultural.

namenerds,3czh0i,YetiYogurt,4,Sun Jul 12 21:46:08 2015 UTC,"I would stay very far away from Lester (the whole molester association), but think Sebastian Walter sounds really nice and matches your other son's name fantastically.  Old fashioned but not too musty first name with an old fashioned, more mothbally (but not in a bad way!!) middle name.  Very nice.  I actually shared your older son's name with my husband because I like it so much."
namenerds,3czh0i,smallstakes,6,Sun Jul 12 19:22:33 2015 UTC,Here are some names that have the same sort of feel and also have short versions: Frederick Alexander Nathaniel  Augustus Vincent Julian Maximus Donovan Harrison
namenerds,3czh0i,Helena_MT,10,Sun Jul 12 06:14:55 2015 UTC,I really like Nathaniel. I can see Nate and Teddy as brothers.
namenerds,3czh0i,Call_me_Cassius,3,Sun Jul 12 06:26:03 2015 UTC,I prefer Sebastian and Oliver. IMO Walter and Lester are old man names.
namenerds,3czh0i,Redditors_Wife_IRL,2,Mon Jul 13 01:03:22 2015 UTC,"I love Walter. Have you considered Oscar, Alfred, Arno, or Timothy?"
namenerds,3czh0i,corkscrew_heart,2,Sun Jul 12 06:16:07 2015 UTC,I think Sebastian Lester would be a great blend of the names you both like.  Another name nerd mentioned Augustus and Nathaniel which I think would be great sibling names.  Other names I like as sibling names for Theodore are: Benjamin Edmund Quentin Thomas William
namenerds,3czh0i,lamerfat,2,Sun Jul 12 18:39:49 2015 UTC,"What about Oliver Walt? It combines a bit of both and maintains the classic feel you two have going while also diverging from tradition a bit. Plus, Oliver, Walter, and Lester all end in 'er' which would make it hard to pair together. By using 'Walt' you're still paying homage to your grandfather. Just a thought, good luck!"
namenerds,3cxaf7,HailtheMagpie,6,Sat Jul 11 16:28:09 2015 UTC,I like giving people bait names to mess with them. Like Merle Fartenhousen Lastname. Or Pegasus Ezekiel Lastname. Or Optimus Beyoncé Lastname. Mortimer Takei Lastname. Or just Hodor. No middle or last. It'll be like Cher or Jesus.  Anytime someone asks I'll just tell them something rediculous. That way when I announced the real name they're more receptive. Also it's fun to fuck with people.

It is not an affront to you as a person or your unborn child.  I am pro sharing names.  I took votes from family members and friends, but ultimately chose what we wanted and what felt right.  I love names too much not to talk about them.  My mom and sister HATED the name we chose for my first.  But I disliked ALL their suggestions.    His name is pretty divisive, some people hate it, others love it, but everyone remembers his name.    I couldn't care less what other people think of the names I picked for my kids (though I admit it feels nice to be complimented on them)."

namenerds,3cxaf7,tortugastation,1 point,Sat Jul 11 21:25:54 2015 UTC,I like this advice much better than the OP's advice. I get annoyed with people who make a big deal about how they have the name but aren't sharing it.
namenerds,3cxaf7,tortugastation,9,Sun Jul 12 00:26:19 2015 UTC,"If you're confident and don't care what other people think, good on you. However, I've noticed many posts as of late on both this board and other name boards that have parents second guessing their choices due to outside influences. Neither advice is better.  Btw, just because names aren't a big deal to you, names can be a big deal to other people. Having others close to you not like your name choice is sometimes quite upsetting, especially during an already emotional time like pregnancy. So, either parents keep the names to themselves or face judgement and disappointment. You should consider that before you get annoyed with people who choose not to share their names."
namenerds,3cxaf7,GingerCookie,4,Sun Jul 12 00:58:44 2015 UTC,"I think it's odd that you assume names aren't a big deal to me, considering I'm an active member of namenerds.   I also think it's a good idea for prospective parents to vet their top choices with some people they trust. Especially first time parents who are often comically unaware of current name trends. I know several couples who chose laughably common names (Jaden, Olivia, Jackson are a couple of them) when their intention was to have unique, creative names that would make their kids stand out. If they weren't so terrified of criticism, they might have found out that what they were going for was the exact opposite of what they ended up with. Maybe they would have made the same choice, I don't know and I don't particularly care, I just think it's ridiculous to not prepare yourself with knowledge because you're so scared of someone else's opinion. And good luck with parenting in general in that case, where your every decision is seemingly open for judgement.   I have another example of parents who had to keep their baby's name secret because they feared judgement and it royally backfired on them. They chose the name Thierry for their first son, thinking it was pronounced ""Theory.""  In our social circle there were several native French speakers (I was not one of them, for the record) who of course knew the correct pronunciation, and would after a few glasses of wine make fun of the ""theory"" pronuncuation. She took it so personally and was so humiliated (and I do agree it made her look stupid and pretentious, although I never said so until now) that she changed her sons name after the age of two to Theo. maybe if she had shared her choice with some trusted advisors before naming another person she would have realized she had no idea how to pronounce it.   And lastly, I think it is totally naive to think people won't tell you they don't like your choice once the baby is born. My son is 15, my daughter 6 and I'll still get the ocassional raised eyebrow or crinkled nose or ""what an... Interesting... Choice"" response when introducing them. Hell, I get that with my own name from time to time. I'm pregnant with number three and I publicly refer to her by the name we've chosen. Not everyone likes it, but I'm an adult and can handle dissenting opinions.   Edit: formatting and correcting the auto-correct."
namenerds,3cxaf7,tortugastation,3,Mon Jul 13 18:33:52 2015 UTC,"Whoa, calm down there slugger. You have very black and white thinking and I just don't view things that way. Totally fine, but no need for the variety of passive aggressive insults you peppered through your post. I only stated that names ""aren't a big deal"" to you because, well, that was your exact quote in your post. See:   I get annoyed with people who make a big deal about how they have the name but aren't sharing it.   Keeping your quote in mind, one would make the postulation that you are not one of the people that ""make a big deal"" out of names as it would be folly to be annoyed with yourself over an issue you could easily correct. Perhaps you meant the statement in a different way.  Good luck with your third baby."

A name nerd might get annoyed when someone won't share the name, but that's because they're probably respectful of differing choices and styles. You never know who's going to dish out inconsiderate comments, especially friends and family who think that it's ok to say your choices suck."

namenerds,3cxaf7,pigby411,3,Sun Jul 12 06:44:17 2015 UTC,"I don't know on this one. If anything I think you need to be able to separate useful, valid criticisms from the pointless ones that are based on personal preference.  e.g. I hate the name Charlotte. Can't stand the sound. Hate all the nicknames. Every Charlotte I've known has been horrible. This is a valid reason for me not to name a child Charlotte, but not for anyone else not to. The name won't hold them back in life at all, people will be able to spell/say it, it's a perfectly fine name.  On the flip side, I like the name Xanthippe. I like how it sounds. I like that it's a bit different. I think the right girl would wear it beautifully. However, I would never give it to a child. They'll spend their life spelling/pronouncing it for people, it won't be taken as seriously as a name like Charlotte in the workplace and it's just all around a little awkward. If I wanted to name a child Xanthippe I think it would be a valid and useful criticism for someone to point all of that stuff out.  Basically I think that the only people whose personal opinion on the name matters are the parents of the child. However, you still have a duty to the child to give them a name that won't hold them back in life, and I think getting input and opinions on that is very important."

namenerds,3cxaf7,Allegretta,3,Sat Jul 11 17:04:54 2015 UTC,"I tend to agree with you on this. No children yet, but my folks are the type to come up with some annoying rhyming nickname that they'll use to ruin the name before the baby is born, or tell me about some person who is terrible who shares the name.

I never want to tell anyone the names I have stored in the back of my mind for my future kids because of this very reason: people judge.

Sure, if you ask a friend what they think of the name, that's one thing. But if you excitedly announce your top choices and everyone has something negative to say, how do they think the expecting mom feels? Surely they don't want to piss her off, so why comment? I get it if you want to name your kid Yogurt or something, you might get some interesting looks, but a regular name? Your kid, your choice."

I am certainly not against the English pronunciation but somehow I suspect it may be easier for the English side to get used to Caroleena than vice versa for the Portuguese side.

Hudson makes me think of the Hudson river. It's not a horrible name, but I don't find it particularly compelling. What matters the most is that you are happy with these names, and your children certainly won't be unique in having them.   I don't know your style, but I can give some middle name options that sound nice to me. Since Avery is a masculine name, I would pair it with something more feminine:    Avery Isabella Avery Camille  Avery Catherine Avery Alexandra  Avery Allison  Avery Noelle  Avery Madeline Avery Juliet    For your son, something classic or biblical to balance out the trendiness of Hudson:   Hudson William Hudson Alexander Hudson Luke  Hudson Michael Hudson Keith  Hudson Bradley  Hudson Oliver"

Both of my names are obscure and I go by a nickname instead of repeating my name several times on introduction.   Both of my children have names in reference to pop culture and naming her Lauren after Lauren Bacall seemed right. Cambria is from The Amory Wars comic series, Alexis just flowed with it in my opinion. So it was really deciding if I wanted a name I loved or a name she could easily say."

namenerds,3cws89,belleonhertoes,12,Sat Jul 11 13:23:36 2015 UTC,"It highly depends on the name, and it is an actual concern. Madeline gives you trouble because it does vary in pronunciation, whereas a name like Olivia would have no such issue. It's not so much about how common the name is, but whether the pronunciation is intuitive or whether there are multiple ways to say it. For instance, I love the name Aurelia (pronounces Or-AY-lee-a), but it can also be pronounced (Or-EEL-ya), so a girl with that name in the US, where I live, would be correcting people regularly.   I would never think to pronounce Anele the way you have it explained. My guess would be either Anna-LAY,  Anna-Lee, A-NELL-ah or A-Nelle. Keep in mind that you can't add the accents on US forms. I don't see how you get the extra ee-ah sound from just an accented E at the end. I would expect it to be spelled Anelia. So, people were right that you would always be correcting others. On the other hand, Ailish is spelled exactly the way it is pronounced.   Does that mean a name is off-limits? No, and people can be corrected. There are many foreigners with unusual names and people learn to pronounce them just fine. But you do have to be prepared to repeat yourself multiple times and hear it butchered from time to time. If that doesn't bother you, then I wouldn't worry about it."
namenerds,3cws89,Allegretta,1 point,Sat Jul 11 13:57:07 2015 UTC,"Well having known the Ailish in question since primary school, she always did have to explain the spelling the first time, especially the first A. And when teachers would read her name off it was always Uh-lish, that they'd say. So my point is that while she did have to explain it, the name was distinctive enough that she'd only explain it once."
namenerds,3cws89,Allegretta,8,Sat Jul 11 14:01:52 2015 UTC,"And that is a prime example of ""always having to correct people"" since life goes beyond school. You will be applying for jobs someday, perhaps starting a business or dealing with people on the phone, and people will get your name wrong all the time. That is true of both common names with multiple pronunciations and unusual names. Again, not the end of the world, but it can get old. My name is Amanda, and I can't say I've ever had to correct anyone or spell it out. Of course, my name is boring compared to some."
namenerds,3cws89,staying_positive,0,Sat Jul 11 14:10:37 2015 UTC,"Also lots of names don't make sense with their spelling. Where's the h sound in John? Why isn't Sean pronounced See-an? We accept those weird spellings because Irish and English names are ingrained in the cultures of anglophone countries. Meanwhile Anelé is Lithuanian where that spelling and pronunciation has always been used, but it's not believable. There really isn't logic to many names' spellings but when they keep appearing people forget that."
namenerds,3cws89,Allegretta,2,Sat Jul 11 16:38:10 2015 UTC,"Er, slightly off topic, but Anelé is actually not a Lithuanian name. If it were, (going off the pronunciation you gave) the spelling would be Anelija...but I've never heard of that name within a Lithuanian context. I googled it and came up with Anelia, which has Hungarian, Slavic, and Polish roots, but that's the closest I could find."
namenerds,3cws89,AlotOfPhenol,0,Sun Jul 12 16:32:43 2015 UTC,"I've asked people from Lithuania, who all said it was a name, just one common in older women. I've also found a hotel in Lithuania owned by woman of that name, and it was the name of my great grandmother who was born and grew up in Lithuania and always spelled it that way so..."
namenerds,3cws89,BananaBoggle,2,Sun Jul 12 18:26:35 2015 UTC,"That's true. There are vast numbers of languages and cultures with different spelling and pronunciation rules, and you're right that it does come down to familiarity. However, that's part of the reason people tend to stick within the familiar. Eventually, if certain ethnic names are used enough, like Siobhan, they become more familiar and workable. But it's always hard to be the first and only person to have a name in the country. That's why many foreigners adapt easier, common, Anglo-sounding names when they come to the US. I don't think that it's impossible to correct people, and I don't think that having to do so is a deal-breaker. But I can understand why it makes people hesitate. At least with Madeline, Mad-ah-lin is a known and accepted pronunciation. Yes, you have to correct them perhaps, but nobody is going to struggle to pronounce it. But some names defy logic completely if they are unfamiliar enough. Take the Gaelic name Caomihe, for instance. Perhaps in Ireland and England, the name wouldn't be that rare. But if you brought it to the US, you would constantly be correcting people and telling them how it's pronounced. But if I celebrity suddenly becomes big here with that name, and enough people start to use it, it will become as well known as Sean.   The fact is, you will often have to correct people anyway, so I agree that it's not a big deal in the end. It just comes down to how badly that bothers you, and how patient a person you are. Some parents are sensitive to it because they don't want to hear their child's name butchered on a regular basis. But times are changing, and with multiculturalism growing and the increase in unusual names, I would say that it won't be a huge deal in the future and people may become more brave."
namenerds,3cws89,charliebeanz,4,Sat Jul 11 17:03:56 2015 UTC,"To add to the discussion, I think the constant correction can be avoided if the person pronouncing or spelling the name has heard you talk before.  For a personal example, my job requires me to take down a lot of names and you usually have to make a split second decision on how to pronounce them. I deal with a lot of international clientele and this decision is usually based on the accent you are using to speak to me. If I hear you have a french accent, I'm not going to pronounce or spell ""Aurelie"" the American way (Aurelee). If I detect a hint of Spanish pronunciation in your speech and you tell me your name is ""Sarah"", I write it down as ""Sara"".  I like African and Japanese names the best. Though they look intimidating, are quite easy to pronounce and spell.  That said, I don't frequently deal with Germans, so them I always have to ask to spell their names simply because I don't have any reference points as to the phonetics.   But to your point, the most ambiguous names come from Americans, to be perfectly honest. We have a habit to take ethnic names and "" Americanize"" them in their spelling. For example, I once had a woman say her name was ""Hitomi"", which from experience I know is a Japanese name, except the woman didn't pronounce it how I expected it to be pronounced in Japanese. I turn the screen around to ask her if I spelled her name correctly and this brief look of annoyance passes by her face.  ""It's spelled H-E-T-O-M-E."""
namenerds,3cws89,suite-dee,2,Sat Jul 11 15:52:31 2015 UTC,"I have a fairly common name, and people constantly get it wrong if they read it on paper first because there are 3 common pronunciations for it.  So, yeah.  Totally understand where you're coming from here."
namenerds,3cws89,charliebeanz,4,Sat Jul 11 13:58:11 2015 UTC,"I have a weirdly spelled name (one of the Caleigh/Kayleigh names you mentioned), and my daughter is named Charlotte. I've never met anyone else with my exact spelling, but the name Charlotte has been around since the 1700's. So, my name is weird and her's is fairly common.   Last year, every note her teacher sent home had her name spelled wrong on it. People constantly ask how to spell her name. People call her Charlene or Charlynn and other things frequently.

namenerds,3cuq72,istara,4,Fri Jul 10 23:36:31 2015 UTC,This sounds like a quintessential southern name to me.

You can certainly call her by both names, but I doubt others will adopt that unless you insist. It doesn't have the sound of a double name like Mary-Kate or John-Paul. I wouldn't use a kid's middle name, even if their parents did. (My grandparents and occasionally my parents call me First Middle, but it would feel very odd if friends or acquaintances did.)"

She's not even southern, she's Filipino! When she was naturalized she had the option of turning her second first name into her middle name but I told her not to. She doesn't use both names casually but I think it's unique enough that she should keep it on some documents. This turned out to be an irrelevant decision because...  FUN FACT: >95% of all official/government institutions don't care how many first, middle, or last names you have. They consider the first first name as your first name, your last last name as your official last name, and all other names as middle names. Unless there are hyphens involved.

I don't disagree, but I also feel like ""commonly"" (not always, note the quotes) people are given a first and a middle name in the US, and replacing one of those two names with the mother's maiden name is taking 1/2 of the child's name from them so the mother can hold on to whatever feelings she has for her last name that weren't important enough to hyphenate the last name for.  If you want the kid to have both last names go for it, hyphenate, whatever you want, but I see making the middle name the mother's maiden name as taking one of the names from the child.  Give the kid their own name! They are independent people and should be treated as such."

Just looking for objective opinions, but I guess some people are more interested in making fun of me/a potential name (even after I acknowledged the company) than offering their opinion.  ETA: Michael is one of my husband's favorites, but we nixed it bc of the actor. I'm not the biggest fan of the name, but I told him that was fine as long as his middle name was Jackson. I'm usually the first between us to make lame jokes, and having one if the very few names we agree on (Hunter) come with home improvement baggage is frustrating. Why is naming kids so difficult?!"

I'd spell it ""Milos"", because common practice is to spell names with international/non-ASCII characters using the ASCII character equivalent, rather than spelling it out phonetically. For example, at least in the U.S. and at least among people I know, ""François"" would get spelled ""Francois"" on a form which didn't permit accented characters, not ""Franswois"". I also think spelling it ""Milos"" will cut down on confusion if his name has an  š on some forms; I think spelling it ""Milos"" on some forms and ""Miloš"" on others will lead to less confusion than ""Milosh"" and ""Miloš""."

namenerds,3cpopt,Helena_MT,6,Fri Jul 10 01:05:54 2015 UTC,"Definitely agree! Most people are smart enough to keep their mouth shut if you say ""this is our child, we named them xyz."" But if you say the name before they're born, everyone will tell you exactly what they think!"
namenerds,3cpopt,dmf95742,1 point,Fri Jul 10 04:14:09 2015 UTC,"Definitely.  Though I did have one little old lady in the grocery store say ""oh that's too bad, (his middle name) should have been his first name."""
namenerds,3cpopt,beadmaze,16,Sat Jul 11 12:05:57 2015 UTC,"My answer- no.   I do know some female Ryans, but I am tired of the masculine names being used for girls trend because the feminine names being used for boys concept is not even a trend. Most people will harshly judge a man for having a girl's name, but they will find it adorable and cute if a woman has a boy's name. Unfortunately it is reported that women with masculine names do well in the workplace because people usually think they are males based on their names and when they find out that they are women, the mindset that men do well than women in the workplace has already been set in place by then.   Really, in the end it is your decision. I already have some people hating on the names I want to use for girls because they are too feminine and frilly. Although one name is unisex, but I am willing to use it on either sex if it suits the baby.   We will always have somebody who hate the names we pick out for our kids, so..."
namenerds,3cpopt,Spookychilies,33,Fri Jul 10 02:39:46 2015 UTC,"Ryan is unequivocally male. The meaning is ""Little king."" The sound of the name is also very masculine. Yes, a lot of people use masculine names on girls and the girls have no issue with it. However, I think it is silly to steal names from the boys when there are so many beautiful, strong, and feminine names out there. There are plenty of girl's names that are not too frilly if that isn't your thing.   In the end, it is your choice, and you aren't alone in naming your daughter Ryan. It is likely that female Ryans will start popping up all over the place, so you won't have to work hard to justify it. I just hope it doesn't go the way of many other great boy's names that become entirely for girls because they're deemed too feminine."
namenerds,3cpopt,Allegretta,14,Thu Jul 9 20:29:15 2015 UTC,"Thank you for stating this position so eloquently and intelligently.

namenerds,3cpopt,injest_,8,Thu Jul 9 20:47:57 2015 UTC,"Thanks. Indeed. I love the name Camille, which is technically a unisex name in France. But can you imagine, as an American, if I decided to name my son Camille? It's unfortunate, but our society is biased towards masculinity."

namenerds,3cpopt,comfyovereverything,8,Thu Jul 9 20:20:12 2015 UTC,No. People are always going to assume she's male. I have a coworker with a male name and people call and asked for Mr. ____ and mail comes addressed to Mr. ____.   BUT if you are really dead set on Ryan.. why not try to make the name feminine with Rhian or Ryane or something she could change the pronunciation of if she wanted to? I've seen that before.

For example, I have friends whose last name sounds very close to balls. They were going to name their boy Harry. Luckily, they mentioned this to a few people and one of them pointed out the name sounds like Hairy Balls. They didn't catch that on their own. That being said, we are having a baby in 2 months. We have shared our favourite names with a few close friends/family members, but we are by no means broadcasting it.

namenerds,3cp7o0,WeavesByNightAndDay,2,Fri Jul 10 12:48:53 2015 UTC,First thought- syrup.
namenerds,3cp7o0,heytherehothere123,2,Thu Jul 9 20:58:59 2015 UTC,"There are certainly some serious issues with Aunt Jemima and racism. It would probably cause less fuss in Canada than the US. However, just because a character that is associated with some bad stuff is named Jemima, doesn't mean that name is totally off-limits. It's a name, it exists outside of the character. We only associate it so strongly because it isn't very common, so the syrup is the only place most people have heard it.  So you'll just have to decide whether the association with syrup is a problem for you. If you love the name, maybe you don't care.  To me, syrup aside, I think Jemima is a big name, and would do well on a kid with a big personality. It's not my style, but I can definitely imagine some people who would fit the name.   I like another commenters idea of Gemma, it's a bit more subtle."
namenerds,3cq4li,sdaeru1,6,Thu Jul 9 21:44:31 2015 UTC,"Are you just using the first name when you search? If so, I think it it would be a bit pointless if there's a famous person with the same name, as you'd just be wading through page after page of said celebrity, e.g. Jennifer (Lawrence, Aniston, Garner, Lopez, Love-Hewitt).  An alternative could be plugging the name into a social media platform like Facebook, so long as you took the results with a healthy pinch of salt.  ETA I do think it's worth Googling the first and last name together in case it brings up a really negative connotation that you hadn't been aware of before. However excessive Googling of images/social media will probably just cause unnecessary angst, as I'm sure you can find a less than appealing image/profile associated with any name if you dig deep enough."
namenerds,3cq4li,__sesame__,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:59:18 2015 UTC,"We've tried it different ways, with FN+MN, and FN+LN, and the full name. That does change things, although I don't think it gives the same ""pure FN"" association. It's a good thing to think about, though.  I really like your idea of trying different social media platforms--it might be more nuanced or something.   UPDATE:  So, I tried a few other searches. Twitter was very useful as a counterpart to web search engines. There were some similarities, but in general Twitter gave a better sense of how a name is being used and encountered in everyday peoples' everyday lives.   The only caveat is that Twitter search results will change more often, so if there's a current event involving a name (e.g., a news story), you might have to filter those out somehow. That happened with one name I tried as a comparison."

I know you didn't ask, but I like Helena the best.  Seems like you're looking for a kind of quirky, old fashioned name.  I think Lydia is going to get pretty popular.  Harriet feels like it has a fair bit of potential for teasing (Hairy, Harriet the Spy), and I just like Helena best though I suppose of the 3 it's the most likely to have spelling/pronunciation issues."
namenerds,3cp5zu,pixiestargirl,14,Thu Jul 9 17:30:08 2015 UTC,"I honestly wouldn't have gotten the pun right away if you hadn't explained it in the post. I feel like this particular pun only works when you say it out loud, when I just read the words I didn't really get it."
namenerds,3cp5zu,katipiff,2,Thu Jul 9 19:33:36 2015 UTC,Thanks for the feedback! I'll head back to the drawing board :)
namenerds,3cp5zu,__sesame__,8,Fri Jul 10 17:33:08 2015 UTC,"Agree about the pun, I didn't get it without the explanation.   Also, ""housekeeping"" on its own doesn't necessarily mean ""residential"" to me. I would probably be boring and put somewhere: ""Business and Residential""."
namenerds,3cp5zu,magical_realist,8,Thu Jul 9 20:18:25 2015 UTC,"I didn't get it at first either. I don't think ""business acumen"" is a common enough phrase for this type of pun. And I would definitely think it was just commercial cleaning. The words are quite long and syllable-heavy... something short and snappy, maybe rhyming, would work better in my opinion. Like Clean Scene. It doesn't have to be that of course, but as an example it's only two syllables total, rhymes, sticks in memory, and doesn't imply one type of cleaning over another."

namenerds,3cp5zu,sidebraid,6,Thu Jul 9 22:20:21 2015 UTC,"Hmmm...I don't think people will get the pun. I get it, but wouldn't have right away if you didn't explain it (or ever, I'm not sure).   I also think it DOES suggest (heavily) that you vacuum only businesses, not residential. I think that will be your biggest problem with this name.  I'd keep hunting for another idea. :-)"
namenerds,3cp5zu,Preglant,2,Thu Jul 9 23:50:05 2015 UTC,"Read up a bit on marketing. One of the things you shouldn't do is name a business based on a pun. Sometimes people have the name of the business long before they actually go into business and it's hard to let go of the idea that you had for months or years.  I didn't get the pun, btw.    There is a disconnect between Business vaccumin' and the slogan — business name has to work as a standalone.    This might be incredibly simple or dull, but you should name your business that will appeal to your target demographic. And you know what? — The name that will work the best will probably be not the smartest, punniest, funniest name, but it will get you customers.    Advertising expenses wise—SEO (search engine optimization - so that your business comes up when I google for cleaning services in my area) Business Vacuumin's comes up, followed by the slogan ""Housekeeping, odd jobs, and more"" — that means you just spend half of your ad justifying your business' name and explaining to me what it is that you do, instead of getting into more important details, like your pricing, why you're the best for the job, etc.  If you're to advertise in Yellow Pages (don't dismiss the old folks who are retired, have cash but no strength no clean their own house) you once again are spending half of your ad on an vague description of your business just to support the pun.   As a consumer, if I am to google cleaning services in my area and Business Vaccumin' comes up as one of the top results ( because you paid top money to place it there) , my thought are —    Search engine screwed up and gave me a B2B listing that might do an odd house cleaning.  I don't even have carpets in my house, who's next on the list? Housekeeping, odd jobs, and more? Nuh, these guys are spreading too thin, I better find someone who specializes in cleaning a house, like a maid would.     Hiring a maid is a luxury item. People don't care about your being clever, they care about you whether you're trustworthy enough to come into their house and whether you can do a good job.   Research the area you want to serve— demographics, age, household income, price range you're going to charge and how you're going to position your company — quick and cheaper, able to come in at the last minute, or expensive and have to be booked way in advance, but all my rich friends are using it and so should I?   Research your competition and see what the common trend among the names is — and then either go with something similar - if you're providing very similar offering, or something completely different.   Play with people's senses - what does it feel like coming back to a clean house?  Make your potential customers call you just because your ad made them smell the clean house (Breeze Cleaners) or see the spotless house - Posh Polish Cleaners, etc.   Good luck.

Katrina was ruined for me by the hurricane, I came to the realization that I'm not actually a fan of using masculine names for girls and only liked Charlie cause I knew a cool girl named Charlie, Jason sounds very 16-year-old-scene-kid to me, and Levi just sort of lost its zest.

Helena and Ilias are still my top names) or atleast still like (David, Ronia).  But some names I have no idea what I was thinking...Seriously typical names 13 year olds like.  I have fallen out of love with plenty of decent names (Lydia, Vince) so for the purpose of keeping these atleast semi-short I will only list the cringe-worthy (imo) ones.  Boys:  Riano  Divani   Romeo  Dari  Ralph (decent name but I only liked it because a handsome guy I saw on TV had that name)  Ravi  Dajo  Reno  Rico  Nadjaro (in Dutch the j is said as y so to have it pronounced with an English j you have to write ""dj"" to get the same sound. It is seen as very lower class.)  Jiro  Moreno  Isajah (again spelled this way to get the pronounciation clear. I still love this name but cringe at my spelling of it)  Rivas  Rowin  Shai (said the same as the word shy. It is an old hebrew name I have read, but damn essentially being called ""shy"" for a name wouldnt have been fun for a boy in an international world.)  Cyrano   Kayne&Davin (why these spellings?! And so everyone can see, even one of the biggest Kayden/Kaedinn haters there is once loved Kayne)  Zico (sounds way too much like sicko)  Harm (Totally normal name in Dutch, but not s nice word in English)  Daric   Mowin&Vasco (I will get my vasectonomy after I am done mowing the grass anybody?)  Seenem (say-nem. Nice Turkish name but it is way too close to semen. Ofcourse I didnt know that at 12)  Vitorio (Italian boys names, especially Lorenzo are the Dutch equivalent of the German Kevins...If anything screams low class over here its this :/ )  So as you can see I loved R names, many ending in -o (which is also pretty not done over here)  Luckily most of these date from when I was 11-12 and I fell out of love with them quickly. I got most of these names from all kinds of naming websites so I have no idea if the majority are even real names. But if not, who made them up? This is getting too long as it is so I will not write the girls names down, I have loved far less cringeworthy names for girls. Maybe Tasha but the only thing that is wrong with that is that it is a nickname for Natasha. But it is also an ok stand alone name."

Even when given permission I still often use the whole name. I actually prefer longer names.   For example, I have a friend named Antonia. Almost everyone calls her Toni and all of her social media uses Toni, but I hardly call her that myself. She doesn't mind at all.  So it wouldn't really even occur to me to call your little Josephine Josie or Joey or anything other than Josephine."

Most strangers won't shorten her name, but some will.  Who you have to watch out for are people who feel comfortable around your child - well meaning extended family, teachers, babysitters, school friends...  Now, if you're thinking ""eh... I don't mind correcting people once and awhile."" Then go for it!  Josephine is a beautiful name.  The corrections will probably be a once and awhile thing.  However, if you know it will drive you crazy, maybe put the name of the back burner.  Yes, it is possible to be a Josephine that never goes by Josie.  However, people will still ask...  Source: grown woman with a beautiful three syllable name."
namenerds,3ckrbh,paperd,3,Wed Jul 8 20:53:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah, this is what I was thinking.  Maybe they would be less likely to call her Josie if we call her Jo occasionally?  Does that make sense at all?  She'd already have a shorter nickname, and it would be Jo.  I don't HATE Josie, just not a fan, and I do like Jo though prefer Josephine.  I think if it weren't for Josie and the Pussycats and Josie Duggar (don't like the Duggars, nothing against the child specifically of course), I would like Josie more.  Side note, how is everyone pronouncing Josie? JO-zee or JO-see?"

If she wants to go by Josie when she's older she very well might, but I think if you raise her calling Josephine she'll probably want to stick with it. That's my experience with people using full names instead of nicknames.

I have 4 brothers and we all were given Polish names by my parents who didn't care about Americans pronouncing them horribly wrong.  My oldest brother is Maciej (Mah-chay), nickname Maciek (Mah-check).  Most people pronounce his name fine after hearing it being pronounced.  My name is Beata (Beh-ah-tah), but I have Americans call me Bee-ah-tuh because it makes everyone's lives easier.  I personally don't mind, but my mom hates that I don't correct everyone.   My three younger brothers:  Piotr (Pyotr) goes by Peter with anyone who doesn't speak Polish.   Krzysztof gets turn into Kristof by everyone but other Polish people.  My brothers and I call him Chrissy though.  My parents call him Krzysiu (rhymes with tissue).  Robert (pronounced with more rolling R's and an 'o' sound that I can't replicate in English) has the easiest name, the lucky duck.  I personally love the name Lukasz because it's easy enough for Americans to pronounce but still Polish looking.  A suggestion based off Krzysztof:  Krystian.  I had a friend in college with this name who went by Krys.  He loved having a different name that was still easy to pronounce.  And here are some popular Polish names that are easy on English mouths:    Adam  Michal (Mee-how) Aleksander Henryk Jacek (Yah-tsek) Sebastian Mateusz (Mah-teh-oosh) (not the easiest, but doable) Jakub (Yah-kub) Tomasz (To-mahsh) - same o as before... still can't think of an easy way to describe it Leon (Leh-on) - same o again   (edit: those stars were supposed to make a bulleted list... not sure what's going on there--FIXED!)  There's obviously way more, but these are just ones that came to my mind or names of Polish guys I know.  I hoped I helped at least a little with this big long comment!  EDIT:  I just want to add that while I sometimes grow tired of always having to pronounce/spell both my first and last name, I couldn't imagine having any other name.  I love having a name that ties back to my culture.  My brothers also have never complained or wanted to change their names.  We are a VERY Polish family though, in that we all spoke Polish first.  It might be different for a child who isn't raised as Polish as we were."

namenerds,3ckewo,bm1992,2,Wed Jul 8 19:28:50 2015 UTC,"As an American who speaks a little Polish, I think most American native English speakers will have a problem with the 'rz' sound. Some will be trainable, but most will say something like ""Krishtof."" I would solve this by weighing the bother of correction/error against the joy of the name. If that error is going to bother you more than the enjoyment you'd get from the name, then go with a different name. If that will bother you but the name matters more, then use the name."
namenerds,3ckewo,rlytired,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:34:58 2015 UTC,"As a Polish-American with a brother named Krzysztof, I have yet to meet anyone who could make the proper 'rz' and 'sz' sounds, but it's funny to hear them try.  I also applaud you for knowing any Polish at all because it's a really hard language."

namenerds,3ckewo,VividLotus,2,Wed Jul 8 19:01:02 2015 UTC,"I think Lukasz is a world less painful than Krzysztof.  Seriously: outside Poland, I'm afraid that is one that needs anglicising. Particularly as your kid is going to be half Anglo-American, I think to saddle him with one of the trickiest Polish spelling names out there is unwise and unfair. People will also presume he's Polish rather than American, which could actually present a problem for him (they might see his name and think he doesn't speak English fluently).  How about using Krzysztof as a middle name?  By the way, just to give you an idea of how nightmarish that name is to a non-Polish person, I ended up cutting and pasting it in the above paragraph, because it was too much of a hassle to type."
namenerds,3ckewo,himisscas,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:12:29 2015 UTC,"My personal opinion: there's never anything wrong with giving your child a name that honors your cultural heritage. There are just two exceptions:   Stay away from names that have either a humorous, confusing, or negative association in the culture/language of the place where you currently live (example: I wouldn't choose the name Lazer out of the names in my family tree, because it sounds weird and not like a name in the U.S. I wouldn't choose Chava if I lived in the UK, because it's one letter off from a negative slang term). If you live in a place where the majority language does not contain accented characters, don't put any accented characters in your child's legal name. This just sets them up for a lifetime of official document-related hassles.   So anyway, if you like Krzysztof, go for it! People have the capacity to misspell any name; I wouldn't let that be a deterrent."
namenerds,3ckewo,belleonhertoes,2,Thu Jul 9 00:10:03 2015 UTC,"Thank you for this!  We are still considering this name, simply because in my mind it is still fairly easy to recognize no matter how people choose to pronounce it (Krisstof, Kreestof, Kreeshtof, etc.) and also names are misspelled ALL THE TIME anyways so having an easy spelling isn't top of my list of priorities.   You make some good points! I had considered Kristóf but I know I shouldn't living in the Texas. Haha"

namenerds,3cjsyo,LiddedPotArena,4,Mon Jul 13 03:28:16 2015 UTC,"""Traditional but not too popular"" rules out Everett and Theodore in my mind; both of those names have ben experiencing spikes in popularity (I wouldn't be surprised if Theodore breaks the top 100 over the next few years; Everett seems like it'll stay in the low 100s/200s for a little while). Lucien is very close to Luke, Lucas, and Luca/Luka, all of which are quite popular, ruling it out as well. Leonard is wonderful, but will all the little boys called Leo running around, in my mind it also breaks the ""not popular"" rule.  Lawrence is one of my favorite names; I love the nicknames Ren and Rory for it. Frederick feels very old-fashioned to me, but in a good way.

I would take all that name research with a grain of salt. I won't say it's not worth paying attention to--a lot of it is pretty solid--but some of it will likely not replicate, or I'm skeptical of for various reasons.  Another thing to keep in mind is that you're going about things in a sort of roundabout way. Those studies are trying to make large generalizations over a lot of names to explain the impressions people have. However, if there are names you like, you can find out what impressions people have directly -- they're right on naming websites. That is, if you want to know how positively people think of one name versus another, just look.   For example, although people don't rate Ace as a bad name, it's right at about the 50%th percentile in terms of overall ratings at one site. According to that direct data, there are about 600 names that people would perceive as better than Ace.   I honestly think you should do whatever you see fit--I like the research you're posting, and it's good to keep in mind. You certainly have a better rationale than most people.

And Amara Davin Shae has a lovely flow aswell. :)  Oh just read the middle name initials must be A.S  Then I vote Amara Susannah, or maybe Sylvie/Sylvia or Seraphina?  Soraya or Soyala are also really pretty but they clash with Amara.  I also really like Amala/Amalia and Amaya aswell."

I think that Albert, like Arnold, is similarly old-fashioned but not necessarily coming back (yet!). We plan to call him Albie when he's little and then maybe at some point he'll grow into being an AJ. I feel like there are enough nickname options that it won't matter if Albert is old or nerdy or something. Maybe you could give Arnold a middle name that would lend to an initial option too."
namenerds,3chwxj,evemachine,5,Wed Jul 8 01:58:18 2015 UTC,"I don't think Arnold is too old fashioned. I think Harold is more old fashioned than Arnold. That being said, my first thought is of Arnold from the show Hey Arnold. But it's not a bad connection."
namenerds,3chwxj,Ron_Weasley_,4,Wed Jul 8 06:13:20 2015 UTC,"It's definitely old fashioned, but I don't think that's a deal breaker. I knew a guy named Herbert in his 20s, and he pulled it off just fine."

Sort of a strange side effect that people who rename themselves later in life have to deal with.  *I was in an LGBT positive space when I deduced these things and it was not disrespectful or out of place.

Caitlyn Jenner's name choice seemed rather peculiar to me because it's much more common among 11 year olds than 65 year olds.  I guess I sort of fall into this category because I had my name legally changed at 18 because I hated the one my parents gave me at birth.  They gave me a very trendy, common name.  The name I've been ""wearing"" for the past 12 years is pretty unusual, but a few years ago a famous celebrity gave their kid my name so it suddenly spiked in popularity (as in, now in the top 1000 when it never was before) but its popularity ranking has remained pretty consistent since then.  I'd be VERY displeased if it ever actually became common!  Happily for me, not a single person has ever mentioned this famous person's child when they hear what my name is so it hasn't had much of an impact on me."

Rudolph is unfortunately too tied with the red-nosed reindeer.   Angus sounds too much like angus beef.   Jasper is trendy due to twilight.   Edit: I am American, but would pronounce Cecil and Basil the way you prefer automatically, as that is how I have always heard those names pronounced."
namenerds,3cgzab,Allegretta,9,Tue Jul 7 21:29:23 2015 UTC,"Cecil: I think of Cecilia, which I pronounce Seh-see-leeya. So I'd pronounce Cecil as Seh-seel.   Basil: I could never get the correct pronunciation for this. Even though I know it should be Bah, my mind says it like Bay-zil.   Rudolph: I'm going to go against the grain here and say that I actually like this name. I live in an area full of Hispanics and I've met 2 or 3 Rudolfos. So Rudolph doesn't remind me of the reindeer at all. I like the nickname Rudy.   Angus: It reminds me too much of Angus beef.   Jasper: Apparently this has a Twilight connection, but I've never read the books so I wouldn't even know about the connection. I want to really like the name, but for some reason it reminds me of a really Southern old man, maybe a little hillbilly-ish.   Out of all of these, my favorite is Rudolph followed by Cecil and then Basil. Not much of a fan of Angus or Jasper. I live in the Southern US if that helps."
namenerds,3cgzab,Ron_Weasley_,3,Wed Jul 8 06:09:35 2015 UTC,"There was kind of a Basil in my father's family tree--he spelled it ""Bazzel.""

namenerds,3cgzab,Ron_Weasley_,5,Wed Jul 8 20:36:09 2015 UTC,"Honestly, yeah. Bazzel looks too made up and also reminds me of the word bedazzle because of the zz. I'd just stick with Basil."

One of my favorite movies as a kid was The Great Mouse Detective, in which the main character was Basil of Baker Street. His name was pronounced the way you like (everyone in the movie was British) so people who have seen that will most likely get it. I'm 24 if that gives you an idea of the age range."
namenerds,3cgzab,girlfrodo,6,Wed Jul 8 21:52:40 2015 UTC,"I would pronounce both Cecil and Basil the way you prefer, but that's because I'm English. You'd probably have a problem getting it pronounced that way consistently in the US.   Rudolph - not a fan personally, literally because of the reindeer, but Rudy's pretty cool.  Angus - very Scottish connection in my mind. Nickname Gus could work really well, and I think it sounds good with your current surname   Jasper is trending, but you'd be an uncommon 19 year old with it :) as long as you don't hang out with many 0-2 year olds, you're unlikely to meet many other Jaspers. It's a cool name IMO."

It's up there with Cyril, Clive and Percy as ""best left in the past"" Basil - it's a bit of a quirky character name, think Basil Fawlty and Basil Brush (boom! boom!) but it's doable. Nature/plant names are in vogue right now, like Rowan, Willow etc Rudolph - I just don't think you'll easily get past reindeer unless you're obviously Germanic and living in a Germanic community. Outside that, you're going to be the amusingly-named Austrian guy Angus - fine, quite Scottish. I don't know how Scots/Irish feel about it with O'Shaughnessy (does it match? clash? does that matter?) Jasper - a great name, currently becoming quite popular again. Julian is another alternative with similar resonance that's also getting very popular recently"

Unfortunately, now it feels like every time I come on here or other baby name sites someone says Eden is trendy, slutty/trashy, tacky, or stripper-like, which is really hard for me to wrap my head around because I'm just used to it having a biblical connotation and it being very unpopular.

I only know 2 other people my age-ish with my name, so I feel very unaffected by its massive popularity.   That being said, when all the people with my name graduate college and enter the workforce, the boom could be much more relevant to my life."

My name shot to popularity when I was 9 or 10 years old, eventually reaching number 30 or so. I have spent the majority of my life having a relatively rare name. Now the generation ten years younger is graduating college and entering the workforce and so I anticipate meeting more people with my name. I think it will prove to be a good thing eventually as it means that people will assume I am younger than I am."

However, the meaning behind the characters would be more along the Iines of wanting your son to grow up to be strong and powerful, like a large tree. The kanji 樹 has more literal connotations than 木, and evokes an image of a large, fully grown or old tree, which in turn conjures associations of strength, power and the ability to grow while weathering storms."

Masaki is nice, but I prefer the kanji 正喜 (""true happiness"") or 正輝 (""true radiance"").

He pronounced it ""Leef"", probably out of convenience, in the US, thats how most people pronounce it.  Most people I've heard say ""Leef"" Erikson, not ""Layf"" Erikson, so I don't think it's too weird to pronounce it ""Leef"". When said quickly, ""Leef"" and ""Layf"" don't sound too different anyways.  I think the only spellings you should use if you want to call your kid ""Leef"" are Leif and maybe Leaf, as Leaf could be considered a nature name, rather than a misspelling or made up name."
namenerds,3c8g2m,Apasstles,6,Sun Jul 5 22:40:38 2015 UTC,I think most people in North America would pronounce it LEEF. I think it's an okay name but kind of unusual on someone without the heritage/surname to match.

It's nice to have meaning attached to a name, but I prefer it be subtle.  Out of curiousty: will it be ME-ra or MY-ra?

Ariella could get lost in a sea of Ariels and Arielle's. Arianna is becoming quite popular too and they have the same feel to me.

Girls: Cecily (love Cecilia even more), Emilia, Bridget&Harriet (not really love these names but I hink they could be very refreshing, and I like the Goddess association for Bridget and the Harriet Tubman association for Harriet. Her birthname was Araminta by the way), and last but not least: Savannah, it is such a sweet name. I also really like Elodie.  Only 4 names I am not a fan of: Cade and Jameson. First one sounds too much like Caiden/Kayden/Caydinn, and for Jameson I have never been a fan of the last names as first names trend unless it is your maiden name. And I heard it is a brand of alcohol? Kimberly and Blair: Kimberly sounds reallyyy dated to me and of Blair I just dislike the sound, for some weird reason I am not a fan of names starting with B.

As for the other option: that is my favorite movie too, and I love that name idea! I honestly really, really doubt that 99.99% of people in the world will ever catch the association, so therefore I don't think there's any problem there. Firstly because it was more of a ""cult classic"" kind of movie (and one from many, many years ago), and secondly because it's rare for a person's middle name to really come up in conversation much, and without the middle name, ""Dade"" just sounds like a regular-- but nice, and not too common-- name."

It's a family name, and I've always wanted to use it. In America, though, there's strong association with a friendly ghost...but I'm not sure that that was a big thing elsewhere in the world? Barnaby is also a good name, but it kind of seems upper class stuffy, like he should be Barnaby Hilt-Witherington IV and wear bowties to kindergarten.Benedict, as a general rule, is a great name, but at this moment in time, it's kind of tied to Cumberbatch. Will this be a problem when your kid's a teenager? Probably not. But you might get asked five hundred million times before he's one if you're a big Sherlock fan, so it's just a matter of if you want to deal with it...but these are all American thoughts. The names could play out totally differently in the UK..."
namenerds,3c1l10,violetmemphisblue,3,Sat Jul 4 02:36:07 2015 UTC,"Ha! Yes, Barnaby is quite a stuffy name here too. My tastes seem to veer towards upper-class, public school type names but this one is perhaps a bit much for our working class roots. Same with Benedict, lovely name but people will automatically say 'Cumberbatch'. I think we'd pronounce Cassian as Cass-e-un as I've never heard of the cash-un version before and don't like it that much. Caspar is beautiful, I agree. Very friendly ghost here too but a lot of Polish immigrants have babies called Caspar so it's not as unusual now and children don't know the cartoon so it's still a strong contender.  Thank you, this has helped me narrow down my choice a bit more."

I try not to question it too much because sometimes you dislike a name and you can't really explain why but obviously it's not the one for us. Lovely name though. Leander is nice too but, like Lysander, it's too close to my second son's name. Some of the names on the 'can't use list' are names of my other children. Raphael is definitely one I'll think about a lot more as a middle name, great suggestions, thanks! So, I've got to decide whether it'll be Jasper, Caspar or less likely- Cassian/Caspian."

I'm not such a big fan of Caspar, partly because of the friendly ghost, but mainly because I (UK midwife) see so many Polish ladies having baby Caspar's (to go with big brother Oskar 90% of the time!) and I think it's going to be a very well-used name by the time your wee man gets to school.   I like Cassian a lot too though! I also think Benedict is fab and I don't think the Cumberbatch connection is that strong, really. Nor is it a negative connection!"

But, actually, it probably wouldn't be such a clever choice in a country where immigration is such an emotive topic. I think he would be forever correcting people on his nationality as well as the spelling, our surname is tricky enough to spell so I need to make it easy on him.

And be sure to have a good story as to why you adore that name (""it was the name of the city we met in"" ""it was his saint's day"" or whatever).  Even if your sibling wants to use their own name for their future kid, it's still your choice to use it first/as well. After all, your wife's beloved, recently deceased grandfather may have had the same name as your brother. These coincidences happen. It's not the end of the world for cousins to share a name (in fact historically, it was pretty usual).  But if you're only choosing a name as a tribute to someone, then it's pretty weird not to run it past them first. Some people don't even like their own names, as /u/injest_ points out."
namenerds,3c0y93,istara,8,Sat Jul 4 09:37:25 2015 UTC,"We wanted to name our son Haven, which was my great grandfather's name and also my brother's middle name. We asked him first though, in case he was planning on using it himself someday. He was honored but said actually he had been thinking about doing just that! He asked for some time to consider it. After a few days, he came over for dinner and essentially ""gave"" us the name saying he would be honored for us to use it since kids are nowhere on his horizon yet! Of course I cried like a big blubbery pregnant lady and we all hugged it out. He was also the only one we told the name and sex of the baby before it arrived, which was fun for him! I think asking is the considerate thing to do and I am sure he will be so flattered."
namenerds,3c0y93,GooseOnTheLoose,3,Fri Jul 3 20:59:51 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I can only really see one reason for naming the kid after the brother: You're really close and want to honor him, in which case...why wouldn't you just talk to him about it? I'd find it really weird to be faced with something like that after the fact."
namenerds,3c0y93,bbthrowaway1984,2,Fri Jul 3 20:48:29 2015 UTC,"I think its good to ask.  I was named after a parent's sibling, and it turned out great.  I asked my SO's grandmother because I loved her name, and she confessed to me she HATED her name growing up, and would feel terribly guilty if our daughter had to go through the same thing."
namenerds,3c0y93,SeoidsGem,2,Sun Jul 5 04:56:16 2015 UTC,"First name or middle name? I think if your baby will have the same first name as his uncle, it's worth having a conversation first in case the older one has strong feelings about it - middle name I think it doesn't matter."

namenerds,3c0y93,monkeyinprocess,2,Tue Jul 7 15:35:53 2015 UTC,"My grandfather's name was Rocco.  He had a son named Rocco (Jr.) and a son named Pasqual.  Rocco (Jr.) and Pasqual both started having children around the same time.  Pasqual had the first son between the two of them, and named his son Rocco--who was born shortly after Rocco (Sr.) died.  [[Jr and Sr are in parentheses for clarity, but were never used in practice.]]  I am sure Pasqual and Rocco (Jr.) discussed naming Pasqual's son after their father, because Rocco (Jr.) was just starting his own family when Pasqual's wife gave birth to their first son.  But I assume either Rocco (Jr.) agreed that it was a nice way to honor their dad, or that he did not plan to name any son of his Rocco III, because I am very confident that there was no bad blood when it came to the final decision.   We usually call them ""little Rocco"" and ""big Rocco"" or sometimes refer to ""little Rocco"" by his childhood nicknames Rocket or Rocketman, to differentiate between the two, if there might be any confusion.  Sometimes, someone will use qualifiers like ""cousin Rocco"" or ""my brother Rocco"" or ""Rocco and [Rocco's wife]"" or ""Rocco's family"" (since little Rocco is unmarried it's pretty clear who you're referring to--since they're pretty patriarchal, we would instead refer to little Rocco's parents and siblings as 'Pasqual's family').  But really, even though they're all pretty close and live nearby and see each other not-infrequently, the only times it really becomes confusing is if there is literally NO context to clue you in on who is being spoken about.  It never really crossed my mind that it was odd.  But when I tried to explain to my husband that little Rocco is not big Rocco's son, he thought that was bizarre and confusing."
namenerds,3c0y93,jamaicanoproblem,1 point,Fri Jul 3 20:21:49 2015 UTC,"I would definitely talk to him about it beforehand. In addition to him maybe wanting to use the name himself, he may feel weird about his name being used. I mean, for a lot of people, names are used to honor the dead (and it seems like he's still living)...And this is probably not the case, considering they're brothers, but a similar thing happened in my group of friends from high school. One girl had a baby and used another friend's name as the middle name. She posted on Facebook that she chose the name to honor one of her best friends who'd always been there for her, etc etc. But the friend totally did not see their friendship the same way. To him, she was just another part of a group friendship, not anything particularly special. So that was awkward..."

If anyone WERE to comment on it (which I'm not sure they would since Alice is a name with much more history), then you can (rightly) answer that it's a family name and (maybe a little white lie) say that you didn't even think of the names being similar."
namenerds,3c05ug,freckledcupcake,4,Fri Jul 3 17:32:19 2015 UTC,"I am hoping it doesn't come to that, but I agree leaving it at saying it's a family name should be plenty to anything said.

namenerds,3c05ug,gdolly,15,Fri Jul 3 19:00:43 2015 UTC,"They sound alike, but the ""essence"" of the name is so so different. Alyssa is much much more modern (1970s+), where Alice is a classic. I wouldn't worry about it."

I also like your suggestion of Mara, and I don't think of Star Wars or Mary at all when I see it. However, I am pronouncing it ""Mah-ra"". Hazel is also nice, and  I don't see anything wrong with using a dead grandmother's name. In fact, I think it's a nice gesture to name for a dearly departed relative.   Have you considered:    Clara  Flora  Violet  Olive  Rose (It's a flower, but it feels like it would age well) Aurelia (It's a long name, but it is related to Aurora and has less of that ""princess/stripper"" vibe your wife doesn't like).  Phoebe Daphne   For the record, I'm an American and have never met or heard of anyone called Callisto. I see Cadence popping up on name boards, but have never actually met one and I work with children.

Sound pattern might be a little too close to Isla, but I’m a bit fussy about that sort of thing.  Poppy - I’ve never been 100% sold on this name, as I think it’s a bit cutesy; however I’m shamed to say that once I found out that Katie Hopkins had named her daughter Poppy it put me off completely!  Amber - I think this is a bit dated  Seren - LOVE Seren  Pippa - I know a Pippa in her late 20s/early 30s who is just Pippa (not Philippa), and she’s awesome. If Charlie, Alfie, Millie & Evie can make it into the top 20, then there’s no reason why Pippa isn’t acceptable.  Esme - I like  Freya - I know Freya is in the top 20, but I don’t think it’s all that common really. Only 2,266 babies in England and Wales were called Freya in 2013 so, unless there’s a plethora of baby Freya’s in your immediate area, I wouldn’t discount it if you both like it.   Rae - I like this as a middle name, but not as a first name. I can’t explain why!  Erin, Willow, Chloe & Autumn I’m ambivalent to, but Erica is great.

By the way, I like the name Sylvia. I considered it for my second daughter, but went with Clara instead."
namenerds,3bzv3p,heliotrope5,2,Fri Jul 3 20:50:37 2015 UTC,"I like your choices! For boys I prefer Miles to Cyril. Cyril sounds a bit like Cereal to me, but that's a quibble. For the girls, I prefer Sylvia since it is less common than Eleanor. Frances would make a good middle name for Maeve too!"
namenerds,3bzv3p,JenjaTheNinja,2,Fri Jul 3 15:10:24 2015 UTC,I'm partial to Isaac since that's what I named my son.
namenerds,3bzv3p,Allegretta,3,Fri Jul 3 16:37:33 2015 UTC,"I like both Cyril and Miles, but since Miles is becoming a bit more on trend these days, I would go with Cyril. Cyril Isaac has a nice ring to it.   Of the girl's names, I would go with Sylvia. While Eleanor is nice, it has become so popular and there are tons of Ellies around. Sylvia is a lovely classic that needs to come back into use.   I like Maeve. The meaning is the only downside to it. But then again, a lot of names have negative meanings and are still well used. Is Frances a family name for you? If so, I could actually see Maeve Frances working just fine. I also like Meave Eleanor."

Second thought was Rose, but that is the Marie of this generation. So maybe Celestine or Rosamund instead?  Noelle Ophelia sounds so light it almost seems like a fairy. Which brings me to Fay/Faye/Fae. How about Noelle Fay? Or Ray, Ramona, Esmeralda...  Noelle Seraphine is pretty angelic too, so maybe Gabrielle and Rafaella or Michaela are inspiring aswell. I dont think Uriella is used as a name?  Araceli is really pretty too.  Which reminds me of all Spanish names associated with Mary, which is quite a list but there are a nice names on there.  Sorry I just let my brain run wild haha, this has nothing to do anymore with sound or flow, just associations. I hope it was helpful anyway, and if not, I really like Evangeline with Noelle :)"
namenerds,3by0kr,Allegretta,5,Fri Jul 3 07:42:53 2015 UTC,"Noelle is very pretty.

And people are much less likely to be negative about it once the deed is done (had this happen to a friend - negative feedback, until she went ahead and named the kid and now I can't imagine him being named anything else - it's perfect). I do agree that people will likely misspell it, but that may not bother you. As for the middle name, I also agree that it kind of runs into the first name,but really - how often are they announced together? And if it has sentimental meaning, people will get over it. I have a friend and all three of her names start with R. Seems weird, but again - the deed was done and people don't judge. Congrats!"

namenerds,3bv9mm,Allegretta,14,Thu Jul 2 15:21:23 2015 UTC,"If you don't plan on ever using those nicknames, it should be fine IMO.    Olive and Vivienne look and sound so different.

Vivienne is the spelling I prefer and the one I have seen most often, however I have also seen it spelled Vivian.   I think it would be fine to go with those names, provided you don't plan on calling them Viv or Liv at home. Whatever happens at school will happen, but it is unlikely they will be in the school context together and so the two names would be seen as separate anyway (different ages, different friends etc).   Out of curiosity, what middle names are you considering for Vivienne? If it is a name we decide to go for I'm stuck choosing middle names!"

No one owns a name, and frankly every single time I see this come up, it's always with a popular name, so everyone has to expect someone else to use it.  My oldest child and one of her cousins share a name.  It's not confusing at all.

Its not a popular name in England. They choose saskia,  my hubby and his cousin are not close anymore and live about 8hrs drive away.

namenerds,3bt9vz,nomorechocolatebars,4,Thu Jul 2 08:21:40 2015 UTC,"Just use it anyway. It's fine (and historically normal) to use names within families.  They seem like the kind of people to be flattered rather than offended, so go for it.  Think of it this way: if your sister had recently called her son Charles, and then you got pregnant with a boy as well, and then your wife's beloved father Charles died suddenly, should she not get to use it?  No one ""owns"" a name.  The only thing I think is shitty is copying someone when they have really gone all out to come up with something unique.  So if they dug up the name ""Boloceuia"" from some ancient Etruscan naming book, and used it, I think it would be fairly unreasonable for you to then use it.  Unless you happened to be a professor of Etruscan studies and by freak coincidence were already aware of the name and had loved it for years."

Being said, a close cousin of mine wanted to name his daughter Lauren which is already my daughter's name. I wouldn't have minded at all but his mom (my aunt) wasn't for it so they picked another adorable name.   It really depends on how much you love the name and can live with the same name in your family, in my opinion. I'm all for it if you love love love the name or want to name in honour of someone.

namenerds,3bt9vz,jacobbaby,1 point,Thu Jul 2 22:31:37 2015 UTC,I'm doing the opposite. I won't tell anybody the names we plan to use for our children because I'm terrified they'll steal them. Guess my family's just not as nice as yours. :P

namenerds,3bt9vz,jacobbaby,1 point,Mon Jul 6 03:04:14 2015 UTC,"It depends a ton on whether it's a close relative as in ""close in terms of genetics"", or ""close as in you see them multiple times a week and at every holiday and they are a huge part of your life"". For example, I am extremely close to one of my second cousins; I talk to her almost every day, and we don't live too far apart. I could never name a kid the same name as her hypothetical kid. But I know some people who barely know or rarely see/speak to their much older half-siblings, their first cousins, their aunt, etc., in which case I don't think it's a problem to duplicate a name."
namenerds,3bt9vz,VividLotus,1 point,Fri Jul 3 03:22:59 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I wouldn't use it unless it's the only name you both love (which doesn't seem to be the case). It's not because they somehow ""own"" the name (they don't) or because I want my child to be the only one in the world with their name... It's not really rational, but not repeating a name already in use by people close to us was one of the rules my husband and I had when choosing our son's name. And it was difficult, because my family is large, plus our friends and friends' children... My mother in law's first name suggestion was my cousin's son's name and was promptly discarded. I don't think it's wrong to use the name, especially since you asked and they don't mind. It wouldn't be a problem at all, but I, personally, wouldn't do it."
namenerds,3bssm0,throwawayrollaway,19,Wed Jul 1 21:20:26 2015 UTC,"Definitely a misspelling. Of all the many variants of Jacqueline, Jaclyn has to be the most awkward looking. I don't really like any of the spellings besides Jacqueline, but they're all better than Jaclyn somehow. It just sort of looks wrong.  All the variations you listed of all those names may be socially acceptable, just as Jaclyn is probably socially acceptable, but with most names, the original spelling is almost always best. Unless you want to name your kid Ruaidhrigh (rory)."
namenerds,3bssm0,Apasstles,35,Wed Jul 1 22:25:09 2015 UTC,a horrible spelling of a beautiful name (IMO)
namenerds,3bssm0,Darkcatnip,22,Wed Jul 1 21:53:23 2015 UTC,Definitely a spelling variant of Jacqueline. I have seen it anglicised into Jacklin or Jacklyn before but Jaclyn just looks wrong to me.
namenerds,3bssm0,ooples_and_banoonoos,8,Wed Jul 1 21:30:00 2015 UTC,"My name is Jaclyn. As a kid I hated my name because there were never any other Jaclyns, and no key chains with my name in it. I preferred Jackie and in my teens I started to go by Jak (because there was a girl named JackiLyn at my school and she went by Jacki. It was a very small school.) I still mostly go by Jackie (or Jak) but because people have called me Jackie all my life.  No one has ever mispronounced my name but I do have to spell it out for people or they butcher it. They either expect 'Jacqueline' (and cannot spell it) or something ridiculous like Jaklin.   I like my name. I think it is an acceptable spelling variant that is not ridiculous. Also, Jacqueline and Jaclyn can be (and are in my opinion)  pronounced differently.  I was named after Jaclyn Smith, kinda. My mother wanted to name me Emma but we have a very Amish last name and I was born in an area with a large Amish population. She was watching Charlie's Angels before a doctors appointment and poof, I had a name.  Edit: I forgot about being a supplanter. My Grandmother once bought me a stone with my name in it and it means supplanter. She got it from a Bible-y/Religion store. All my cousins have cool name meaning, seven year old me thought I was going to grow up to be a plant.  tl;dr My name is Jaclyn and I love my name."
namenerds,3bssm0,kotacoette,2,Thu Jul 2 01:23:21 2015 UTC,"LOL at seven year old you! The main reason I was thinking of these names is because I love the nickname ""Jackie"" too. I also pronounce them differently in my head."

namenerds,3bpwvk,Kadamba,2,Wed Jul 1 07:02:38 2015 UTC,"I love Noah but it was popular so I would go with:   1) Leo. 2) Noah.  3) Abel. This would be much higher but I just dont think I like the English pronunciation for this one, I am so used to the Dutch the English one sounds off to me. If this wasnt the case, it would be my first choice for you.  4) Oliver and Everett. They are both nice names, but soooo trendy right now and I dislike that. Noah is also popular, or atleast has been, moreso even but I have always LOVED Noah so I make an exception for that name. With names I just like and not love, like Everett and Oliver, I dont do that.  So basically it is between Leo, Noah and Abel for me.  This is all just my opinion ofcourse.  OP why did you pick these 5 names? Perhaps the reasons behind the names could narrow it down.  Do you also need a middle name? If so you could use 2 ofcourse, for example Leo Everett has a nice ring to it."
namenerds,3bpwvk,moccasinspaws,2,Wed Jul 1 10:03:01 2015 UTC,"They were a combination of names I liked and my wife liked. Leo I have also loved.

namenerds,3bpwvk,Apasstles,0,Wed Jul 1 18:04:50 2015 UTC,"If you like unique or atleast not too common, then it is between Leo and Abel :)"
namenerds,3bpwvk,LissieRae06,2,Wed Jul 1 23:14:06 2015 UTC,"Abel is going to be our baby's name (if it's a boy)! It's my number one pick.   Noah is an awesome name, I love it, but it's suuuuuper popular right now, like as in, one of the top baby names the past several years and not slowing down. It's probably going to be a name like John or David in a decade or two.   Leo, Oliver, and Everett are good."

Oliver - I've always thought this name was super cute Leo - I like this name but its one of those names I could never use - you should though! Noah - Not a huge fan of traditionally biblical names, plus this one is just so popular.  Abel - Again, traditional biblical name, plus I associate the name with Son's of Anarachy which I strongly dislike."
namenerds,3bn8i7,freddylou,6,Tue Jun 30 16:07:00 2015 UTC,"Caspar Huxley definitely stands out to me. It fits right in with your other kids' names as a full name, and with the nickname Huck.  Second to that, I like Linus Jude or Arthur Lewis. I'm a sucker for Linus and Arthur. My favorite nicknames are Link and Bear. If you went with Caspar Huxley for the first twin (which I so hope you do), Caspar & Arthur is a little -er heavy. But Huck and Link is a little -k heavy. I'm leaning towards Linus because as a full name it sounds best with Caspar and fits the style of your other kids' names best, and the K heaviness isn't bad, especially when said as a full sibling set - Scout, Fox, Huck & Link. It actually sounds awesome.  I kind of love all the names you're considering. Caspar Huxley and Linus Jude just work the best with your kids names in my eyes."
namenerds,3bn8i7,Apasstles,3,Tue Jun 30 17:44:14 2015 UTC,"We are almost definitely naming one twin Caspar Huxley; we agree, it fits with the others both ways :) Now the only problem is the other twin, we never really thought of the K/er heaviness but now that you have mentioned it it seems so obvious! Arthur now seems like too many Rs with Caspar as well so that's out, but, like you we don't really mind the Ks with Huck and Link - our only problem with Link is that it is too much of a stretch from Linus? Thanks for your input: you helped us narrow down the list :)"
namenerds,3bn8i7,Citruslatifolia,1 point,Tue Jun 30 18:20:38 2015 UTC,I agree with Caspar Huxley and Linus Jude. I love both! I think Link is a fine nickname for Linus.
namenerds,3bn8i7,helpmenamemybaby,6,Tue Jun 30 21:27:00 2015 UTC,"I don't like the nickname Rocco at all. It is awkward and doesn't fit in with the other nicknames. It isn't one syllable like them and is just as long as Roscoe when you say it, and Roscoe is a much better name.   Huck is great and fits in with Scout and Fox perfectly. I like Huxley as a first name, especially if that's where the nn is coming from. Maybe Huxley Alcott or Huxley Jude.   Arthur Lewis is my second choice, with Bear as a nn."
namenerds,3bn8i7,helpmenamemybaby,1 point,Tue Jun 30 21:38:38 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply, what nickname would you suggest for Roscoe instead of Rocco?"

namenerds,3bn8i7,allt,6,Wed Jul 1 13:51:39 2015 UTC,"Congrats! You guys have such awesome taste in names.  I personally like Roscoe Alcott and Arthur Lewis the best, with the nickname Bear for Arthur. That would keep your nicknames balanced (2 animal nn's and 2 fresh and awesome sounding nn's) plus Roscoe and Arthur sound great together.  Good luck!"
namenerds,3bn8i7,sailor_emily,2,Tue Jun 30 16:19:41 2015 UTC,"Thanks, we love the idea of balanced nicknames so no one is left out! We also think we are leaning more towards Bear rather than Art if we go with Arthur. Thanks for the reply!"
namenerds,3bn8i7,allt,4,Tue Jun 30 16:27:03 2015 UTC,"My son has a nature/animal name, so I love this sort of thing.  But I think children named Fox, Bear, and Scout is a little too on the nose."

namenerds,3bn8i7,kalanitres,1 point,Tue Jun 30 17:53:16 2015 UTC,"I absolutely adore Huck :)  And I think all four of those names go well together, because they all have hard consonant sounds.    Congrats on the twins, btw.  I love boys!"
namenerds,3bn8i7,belleonhertoes,3,Wed Jul 1 17:14:59 2015 UTC,"All of your names are so fun. Going to miss your posts once you've made a decision. Have more babies!   Anyway, if I had to choose, I'd vote Caspar Huxley and Roscoe Alcott. Otherwise, my only suggestion is to either give both of them or neither of them animal nicknames, since their older brother is Fox."
namenerds,3bn8i7,istara,2,Tue Jun 30 16:20:54 2015 UTC,"Aw thanks; though probably no more babies for a while, twins are apparently a handful! :) Thanks for your input, we are definitely leaning towards Caspar! Would you think that someone (either Scarlett or Felix) will feel left out if we give the twins animal nicknames or not animal nicknames rather than balancing it with one having an animal name and one not?"
namenerds,3bn8i7,people1925,1 point,Tue Jun 30 16:35:08 2015 UTC,"You're right, I can see Scarlett feeling left out if she is the only one without an animal nickname or a twin feeling left out of the brother animal nicknames, but I would think Felix would be less likely to feel left out of non-animal nicknames. This is just speculation, of course."
namenerds,3bn8i7,jacobbaby,2,Tue Jun 30 16:41:48 2015 UTC,So you think two non-animal nicknames? That is what we were thinking too; maybe Huck and Rocco (Caspar and Roscoe)?

namenerds,3bnqly,JneedsaBRA,5,Tue Jun 30 18:14:42 2015 UTC,"I once had a German Shepard and something else mix named Nala which seems to fit your criteria. Other than that I love Atlas and Aspen the most! I would suggest practising saying the name and then the commands (such as ""Ava, Sit"") you would use and removing names which sound similar or are hard to say with the command. So for me, Quartz is hard to say as ""Quartz, Sit"" as the S sound flows together. Also imagine calling the name in public and other ways in which you would use the name. Just some suggestions :) Hope this helps"
namenerds,3bnqly,freddylou,2,Tue Jun 30 18:30:43 2015 UTC,That's a really good suggestion about practicing the name with commands and a perfect point about Quartz + Sit.

namenerds,3bjepq,Apasstles,7,Mon Jun 29 18:45:22 2015 UTC,"Serena Juliet by a mile - what a beautiful name!   Runner up would be Athena Rose. I like Athena, but Rose is kind of boring in he MN spot.   I just don't love Delia or Desiree, though I do love the other MNs you've chosen. If I could mix and match, I'd do Juliet Rhiannon or Juliet Fiona."
namenerds,3bjepq,imapumpkinseed,14,Mon Jun 29 21:32:32 2015 UTC,"Athena Rose - Beautiful, classic name. What better ""role model"" is there than the goddess of wisdom? Serena Juliet - Graceful, dreamy name. However, it might not fit her personality. Also, doesn't have a nickname. Delia Rhiannon - This would be second if it was Cordelia Rhiannon. Delia Rose - Again, I think Cordelia with the nickname Delia would be better. Desiree Fiona - Fiona is a wonderful first or middle name. Desiree would be a hellish name to have to carry through adolescence. Look at your or your husband's least attractive female relative and consider how much worse her life would have been if she'd been saddled with the name Desiree."
namenerds,3bjepq,endlesscartwheels,8,Mon Jun 29 19:47:10 2015 UTC,"Wow! Thank you for taking the time to comment on all of the names. We really appreciate it! Desiree Fiona has been taken off the list. I love the name Fiona as a middle name, and it doesn't sound good with the other names. I think Desiree is lovely, but it would be a difficult name to have.   I think Cordelia is beautiful. I am hesitant to use it, however, because I'm afraid people will call her Cori. My ex best friend is named Cori. I LOVE Delia as a nickname for Cordelia so much that I decided to go ahead and use it on its own.  Thanks again!!"
namenerds,3bjepq,bitterwinterchild,5,Mon Jun 29 20:17:55 2015 UTC,Usually people will call her what YOU call her. Usually. :)

namenerds,3bjepq,BruisedxEm0ti0ns,2,Mon Jun 29 21:06:05 2015 UTC,I think with Serena you can nickname call her Reina which means queen in spanish.
namenerds,3bjepq,Erger,3,Mon Jun 29 22:14:27 2015 UTC,"The thing about Delia is that it doesn't look/sound incomplete, like you gave her a nickname instead of a name (Madi instead of Madison, Sammy instead of Samantha/Samuel, Tom instead of Thomas). No one would look at you twice if her name was just Delia.  And if you have bad associations with the name Cori, it's perfectly reasonable to not want to name your child something close to that!"
namenerds,3bjepq,istara,1 point,Mon Jun 29 23:51:43 2015 UTC,I think Delia or Dee is more likely than Cori. But all she has to do is request what she prefers to be nicknamed.
namenerds,3bjepq,kalanitres,5,Tue Jun 30 01:51:51 2015 UTC,"I agree with your feedback, but could you elaborate on what you mean by ""saddled with"" Desiree? It's NMS, but I'm just curious as a namenerd. Do you think it's stipperish? Or too lofty?"
namenerds,3bjepq,endlesscartwheels,6,Mon Jun 29 20:23:09 2015 UTC,"It's the former, unfortunately. In Sweden, where Desiree is a popular name often used by royalty, it would be a great choice. Unfortunately, in English-speaking countries it may make people underestimate her and focus on her appearance."
namenerds,3bjepq,kalanitres,5,Mon Jun 29 21:06:21 2015 UTC,"Okay, thanks! I'm not sure if it's the root word ""desire"", but something about it does seem a little... erm... adult."

namenerds,3bi7fw,istara,7,Mon Jun 29 13:23:20 2015 UTC,Not a fan of Bryce or Faith. Mainly because I think the two syllable names with the 'ah' ending sound best when paired with Joyce.
namenerds,3bi7fw,tomorrowgirl,5,Mon Jun 29 14:03:36 2015 UTC,I think that Hannah Joyce sounds the best (although the flow with your last name is far more important).
namenerds,3bi7fw,__sesame__,3,Mon Jun 29 14:00:43 2015 UTC,Hannah and Leah are both really pretty.
namenerds,3bi7fw,nomorechocolatebars,3,Mon Jun 29 13:57:13 2015 UTC,"Faith Joyce - They're both fine names, but they don't flow together great since they're both one syllable.  Hannah Joyce - This one's nice  Bryce Joyce - Nope. If you named your daughter Bryce and your son Logan, I'd assume they were both boys or Logan was the girl and Bryce was the boy. It also just flows really badly. They're both 1 syllable and end in the same sound  Neala Joyce - This one sounds nice. I'm not sure how I feel about Neala though, I like it better as a nickname. Cornelia would be the obvious full name, but it could also work as a nickname for anything that shortens to ""Nellie"": Daniela, Eleanor, Fenella, Penelope, Helena. I also found Nelia, which I like a lot and could shorten to Neala (Nela) or Lia/Leah. Some other options that are similar but don't really shorten to Neala: Nola, Nell, Nella, Nina, Nona, Mila... My personal favorites are Nola and Nelia.  Leah Joyce - I like this one best, it flows well, it's simple, it's a nice name."
namenerds,3bi7fw,Apasstles,2,Mon Jun 29 15:17:13 2015 UTC,"Faith is not my style - I don't like ""virtue"" names.   Hannah is a timeless classic, can't go wrong there.   Bryce feels like a boy's name to me.  Neala makes me wonder about pronunciation. Would it be Nay-AH-luh, or KNEE-luh? I'm guessing the latter, which kind of feels like you wanted a boy named Neal, but you got a girl so you added an A at the end. NMS.  Leah is pretty. I'd probably go without the H, but it doesn't look wrong or anything."
namenerds,3bi7fw,LiddedPotArena,2,Mon Jun 29 13:02:33 2015 UTC,"My top name for a girl was Leah Joyce, until my husband wanted to honor a friend.  If we have twin girls one will be Leah Joyce, and the other will be for his friend.  I might be biased.  I like Hannah and Neala.

namenerds,3bi7fw,stridersriddle,2,Mon Jun 29 15:04:28 2015 UTC,"Hannah, Leah, & Neala are my favourites. I've not heard of Neala before, but it's very pretty. Where's it from?

Faith I'm not a huge fan of mostly because I don't like this type of naming (Faith, Hope, Serenity, etc.)  Neala - I've never head of, how do you pronounce it?  Hannah/Leah - both great choices!"

namenerds,3bi7fw,Citruslatifolia,2,Mon Jun 29 18:15:50 2015 UTC,"I like all your choices except Bryce (clashes with the middle name). How about Brynn instead?  Faith is often used as middle name, it is top 100 but I hardly hear of it as a first name and I like that, and it meaning ofcourse.  Hannah is lovely and very international.  Neala is unique, there might be some pronunciation issues, but if you dont mind that, this is my favorite for you.  I have always loved the name Leah, and it flows well with Joyce, so that would be my runner up."

namenerds,3bgomt,amgov,4,Mon Jun 29 02:01:08 2015 UTC,I think she really likes it because it's a 'strong' name and she thinks people live up to their names. I don't necessarily agree with her. Just wanted to show her that it's not just me who thinks the name reminds people of Nazis/Hitler

namenerds,3bgomt,ach_wirklich,7,Mon Jun 29 04:29:24 2015 UTC,"Here's the thing: I'm aware of its Sanskrit meaning and history, yet I still instantly think of neo-Nazis when I see it.  I would 100% take that name out of consideration for any child who lives in the U.S. There are lots of names that have a wonderful meaning and sound nice in the language/culture from whence they came, but have a negative connotation (ranging from sounding like a negative slang term or unpleasant thing, to an extremely negative connotation like this one), and just really can't be used without potentially subjecting the child to a lot of baggage. I'd put this name at the very top of this list."
namenerds,3bgomt,CopyRogueLeader,12,Mon Jun 29 14:53:47 2015 UTC,"As a German, I find it mind-boggling that someone would even consider that name. It's offensive and exclusively linked to nazis.

namenerds,3bgomt,goldjade13,1 point,Mon Jun 29 02:31:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm definitely familiar with the name. My brother named his son Aaryan and we live in the US. Little Aaryan just turned 1 year old so I can't tell you how it has affected his life outside of home, but I don't think he'll have too much trouble. I think maybe that's why my brother went with the double As...personally, I thought the name was kinda cringey, but it actually suits my nephew pretty well.   If I was given the pressure to use the name, I'd prefer it to be a middle name. Or if you do want it as a first name, pair it with a more common, less negatively associated middle name.   Aside from all of that, it really is a beautiful name with a nice meaning. It sucks that it's been ruined like that."

namenerds,3bgomt,etaketone,2,Mon Jun 29 09:53:58 2015 UTC,You could try the spelling Arian (just as common) to move away from any dodgy connotations.

namenerds,3bgomt,momonomicon,1 point,Mon Jun 29 15:11:13 2015 UTC,It's a shame really as its a nice name. I wonder if people would make the link when first meeting the kid though. Out of context and on the Internet with the suggestion already planted it is clear. Then again I'm used to it being on kids with an Asian background and so would make any links to Hitler...
namenerds,3bgomt,myh2oisblue,1 point,Mon Jun 29 15:44:24 2015 UTC,"Yep, I immediately think of the negative connotation.  I agree with another poster about the alternative spelling Arian being much better. I would pronounce that spelling ar-ee-an though instead of air-ee-an"

You can essentially end up with a few different letter combinations to change the inflection of the name, such as the 'y' to an 'i' to make it Arian.  Few people would immediately draw the connection, but using it as it is probably would present a problem."

Nah, it's a name of it's own that existed before the movie, and it's a nice freaking name. Even if people do quote it, so what? Have a name used in popular media or something and you WILL hear those jokes.   I'm a Kasey, I've heard Casey Anthony jokes, and Casey & Finnegan jokes (puppets from Mr.Dressup, where Mom actually got my name anyways aha), Casey Jones, Casey Casem, etc.   Inigo Montoya is not at all a bad thing to be compared to, he was a strong and respectable swordsman.

I'd never really considered the name Mary until a few years ago when I met a little girl named Mary who was probably 7 or 8. I was really pleasantly surprised to hear the name on a kid, it seemed fresh and unique on someone so young.

It's simple, but I think it's simplicity is part of what makes it beautiful. I knew a girl named Mary in high school and, although I'd never really thought about the name before that, I thought it sounded so pretty on her and started to consider using it.

Btw is Campion your surname or a name? It's a lovely flower, so a winner either way.

It's got heaps of international variations. The most basic one in English would be John, but would probably also be too normal for your style.  Behind the name has a long list of names in the same name family. Some remarkable ones are:   Jannik/Jannick/Yannick (First two spellings are Danish, as is Soren, but the Breton/French spelling might be more convenient in English) Jens (also Nordic, just like Soren) Hank (trace Jean up to Iohannes then down to Hann to Hankin to Hank) Jonas Sean / Shane / Shaun / Shawn Jack / Jake Ianto Iwan / Ivan / Ivo Jussi (this is a Finnish diminutive, I quite like it) Yannis"

Don't know if it's too Russian for your huband's liking though, but it's a name that would be pronouncable in all three languages (even though it would sound differently in English than in Swedish and Russian).

Stanislav- This name would work for Swedish, and Russian, but may be akward for english speakers. To remedy this I'd call your child Stan/ Stanis/ Stanley as a nickname.  I hope one of these were helpful. I wish I knew more about russian/ swedish crossover names."

As for others who are saying it is plain...how often is a person's first and middle name said together? Sarah Iftimie doesn't sound plain at all, which is what people will say more than Sarah Anne. So if Anne has a special connection, or you simply just like it, then I think it is great!"
namenerds,3bagke,ArtisticD,0,Sat Jun 27 12:31:14 2015 UTC,"It's not about it sounding plain, so much as a higher risk of getting mixed up with someone of the same name. I'll agree that with a last name like Iftimie, it should be less of a problem. But if you have a pretty common last name, the chances of running into several Sarah Anne Smiths, for example, are extremely high. Why is this a problem? You can get your credit mixed up with someone else, and it is easier for people to commit fraud under your name. I've also heard of people with common names getting turned down for jobs because someone with the same name committed a crime, and the criminal's records accidentally became associated with them."
namenerds,3bagke,Allegretta,9,Sun Jun 28 15:03:19 2015 UTC,I've always loved the name Sarah. I think it's sweet & classic.

I also don't care for the repetitive sounds between Sarah and Anne. Something like Sarah Joy would flow better. If I were to use a very common name like Sarah, I would make the middle more interesting - Sarah Magdalene, Sarah Camille, Sarah Genevieve, etc. But it's ultimately up to you. If you love the name, then that is what matters."

I only ask because I feel like Sarah Anne has a bit of a hiccup in the middle - maybe it's because the a sounds at the end of Sarah and beginning of Anne are really similar so you have to really enunciate the ""ah"" in Sarah to avoid it coming out Saranne?   I still like it, it's just something to think about. Would something like Sarah Joanne or Sarah Jane work?"

I'm pretty sure no one would ever consider it a boy's name now, it's not even listed as a boy's name on Nameberry, which lists Evelyn and Vivian as boy's names.  Basically I just said ""for a girl"" out of habit, but - if you look at this website showing Cleo's popularity very closely - you can see that the line for boys hasn't been completely flat in the past 10 years, meaning someone must consider it a boy's name (O endings are quite popular with boys now I suppose).

That also gives her the benefit of having a more common middle name of her generation (Mathilda/Matilda isnt popular yet but people seem to like it so I predict it will climb. Wont be top 10 though, I think. probably top 50 and maaaybe top 20.)  if she ever wants that. Which I hope not, because Cleo is lovely :)"
namenerds,3b8uw6,walkthroughthefire,1 point,Sat Jun 27 22:19:38 2015 UTC,I like it.   Although I prefer Clementine over Cleo.
namenerds,3b8uw6,MereDuchesne,1 point,Sat Jun 27 05:14:19 2015 UTC,"Have you considered Clea? More recognizable as female, but not common at all."
namenerds,3b8uw6,LiddedPotArena,1 point,Sat Jun 27 23:47:37 2015 UTC,The first thing I thought of was the fish from Pinocchio.
namenerds,3b8uw6,MereDuchesne,1 point,Sun Jul 5 05:37:11 2015 UTC,"Not too out there, but I would consider it either a boy's name or a nickname for Cleopatra. I would go with Clio for a girl, though it would be associated with the muse in that case."
namenerds,3b8uw6,istara,3,Sat Jun 27 02:29:51 2015 UTC,"Interesting, you're the first person who's said that.  I know it's traditionally a boy's name, but I've never heard it on a man (except, apparently, my great uncle, who I never knew) and looking at the historical usage, at least in the US, it's nearly always been more popular for girls, so I'm not too worried about it being a boy's name. Is it more popular for boys somewhere else?  Either way, at this point I'm considering Clio/Cleo as a middle name (I'm split on the spelling at the moment), so that's another reason not to worry too much about spelling & genders."
namenerds,3b9ao4,Casalot,6,Sat Jun 27 00:54:18 2015 UTC,"What nicknames in particular for Felicity have you already thought of? If you haven't already thought of them, here's a few more uncommon nicknames for the name (they're all sort of stretches but lots of nicknames are): Effie, Felix, Fox, Izzy, Ellie, Elle, Cici, Lissie/Lizzie, Ty, Lacey, Faye. My personal favorites would be Effie, Felix, Lacey and Faye.   You should also consider what her middle name would be, and you could sort of combine them to form a nickname. For example, Felicity Nicole might by Finn or Flynn, Felicity Laura might be Flora, ect.  I love the name Felicity by the way!"
namenerds,3b9ao4,twitsshit,1 point,Sat Jun 27 01:11:00 2015 UTC,I also thought of Lily: also a stretch but still lovely in my opinion.
namenerds,3b9ao4,Kadamba,3,Sat Jun 27 05:42:48 2015 UTC,"My friend Felicity was known chiefly as Flick by her friends for lost of her childhood. When we were about 16, she asked us to call her Felicity, and we did and do! Now and then I still call her Flick, but she doesn't mind. Felicity is such a lovely name and doesn't necessarily need a nickname!"
namenerds,3b9ao4,girlfrodo,3,Sat Jun 27 04:29:14 2015 UTC,Fliss?
namenerds,3b9ao4,alice-in-canada-land,3,Sat Jun 27 04:53:44 2015 UTC,"You'll figure out something once she's born.  I started out planning out nicknames, but they never really stuck.  Bobbie became Booboo, Esther became Ro, Doug became Biscuit.    You could call Felicity Tee, Fefe (it will seem less silly with a baby falling on her butt), Leelee, Fillie, maybe even Lissa."
namenerds,3b9ao4,Grave_Girl,3,Sat Jun 27 05:02:46 2015 UTC,Fliss is the one most folks go for here in the UK. I've never gone by it.  Flick is an excellent nick name for it.

My sister and I both have 3 syllable first names and have never gone by anything else. I've known plenty of Alexandras, Victorias, Elizabeths, etc."
namenerds,3b9ao4,imapumpkinseed,2,Sat Jun 27 03:21:35 2015 UTC,You could use an unrelated nickname. Get to know her and then make one up based on her personality.

namenerds,3b9ao4,istara,1 point,Sat Jun 27 08:22:37 2015 UTC,My son also has a 4-syllable name with crappy nicknames (IMO). I either use his full name or things like Baby Pants. Nick names are organic. Felicity is great. Don't stress.
namenerds,3b9ao4,monkeyinprocess,1 point,Sat Jun 27 23:54:21 2015 UTC,"Nicknames are pretty unpredictable.  They can be based on a name, characteristic, a story, or something else.  I'd say go with Felicity and see how the nick name shakes out (if any)."

namenerds,3b7l9k,Dino_vagina,16,Fri Jun 26 21:44:55 2015 UTC,"Rhett is very recognizable. I think most people would know the name even if they haven't read or seen GWTW. Even if they don't, the name is spelled phonetically and makes a lot of sense. I think it's very handsome and underused."
namenerds,3b7l9k,Allegretta,4,Fri Jun 26 18:32:22 2015 UTC,"Exactly. I would think for an American, it would be quite bizarre to not be aware of ""Rhett Butler"". I'm English, I've never even seen Gone with the Wind, yet it's an iconic name to me."
namenerds,3b7l9k,istara,5,Sat Jun 27 08:26:13 2015 UTC,"Rhett was ranked 338 in the US in 2014, with 975 boys being given the name. It looks like it's been growing steadily in popularity for a few years now. Between that and the Gone With the Wind connection, I'm pretty sure people will recognize it."

namenerds,3b7l9k,ihopeihavetime,5,Sat Jun 27 00:42:20 2015 UTC,"I think most people will recognize the name, however, most people's only association with Rhett will be Gone With The Wind. That isn't necessarily bad, just something to consider. I really like the name!"
namenerds,3b7l9k,zoyaheaven,4,Fri Jun 26 17:41:30 2015 UTC,"I actually went to school with a Rhett Butler. Always wondered why his parents did that to him. I'd say, as long as your last name is not Butler, go for it! Rhett is a nice, masculine, recognizable-but-not-overused name."
namenerds,3b7l9k,noodletune,3,Fri Jun 26 20:26:33 2015 UTC,"of course it's a name. I even know one. And yes, I make the GWTW connection too, but that is very dependent on movie/book choices. Yes, Rhett was a bit of a jerk (but in his defense, Scarlett was no picnic herself), but that wouldn't stop me from using it.  The Rhett I know is athletic and kind."
namenerds,3b7l9k,LilMissMath,3,Fri Jun 26 17:35:12 2015 UTC,I know two little boys named Everett that go by Rhett which I think is pretty cute. But I like the name on its own if you're the Southern type!
namenerds,3b7l9k,northern_belle,2,Fri Jun 26 23:56:17 2015 UTC,I recognize it and I like it.
namenerds,3b7l9k,thepriceforciv,2,Fri Jun 26 19:10:18 2015 UTC,"I absolutely recognize it. My first association is Gone with the Wind, but I think of it more as just a southern name than really tied to the character."

namenerds,3b7l9k,World_Of_Amie,2,Fri Jun 26 23:07:38 2015 UTC,I love Rhett mainly because oh Rhett Butler. (It also does remind me of Rett Syndrome.) But then I learned that Rhett can be a nn for Everett. So if I love the name Rhett I would go for it as a nn.

namenerds,3b7mha,Rrg7pitt,7,Fri Jun 26 16:55:14 2015 UTC,"I like Maxine a lot.  It sounds good with your last name, and I think Max is a cute nickname if you're okay with masculine nicknames for a girl.  I honestly think Quinn Cramer sounds fine, too.  If you husband can't pronounce it without lisping I get wanting to rule it out, but if it was just one random slip up I don't think it's a big deal.  I think it's a real stretch to say kids would use that as their go-to if they want to poke fun."
namenerds,3b7mha,apinkelephant,6,Fri Jun 26 19:02:50 2015 UTC,"I like Maxine! I think Max and Maxie are adorable nicknames. And it's nice that it's a family name for both of you.  I'm not sure what your preferences are.... but what about Scarlet, Arya, Annabelle, Iris, Charlotte?  Unfortunately, kids can always find something if they really try, whatever the name. My cousin Lucas was teased with ""Lucas Mucus"" growing up-- I mean, come on. Who was that creative evil genius? Anyway, my point is, unless it's super obvious, I wouldn't worry too much about it."
namenerds,3b7mha,howverycleverofyou,3,Fri Jun 26 19:51:14 2015 UTC,"I like Charlotte but I'm afraid it will be too popular with the royal baby being named that.

Just don't want to start her out in life with a speech impediment from a tongue twister of a name!"
namenerds,3b7mha,howverycleverofyou,2,Fri Jun 26 21:20:46 2015 UTC,That's totally fair. I can see Quinn being a bit of a tricky one.

Cause if it helps, Charlotte was already number ten last year before they named her that, and that accounts for like 10k births in the US in 2014.   While Emma, the number one last year, had 20800 births with that name.  That's out of like 318 or so million, and I doubt Charlotte will get that much of a spike in popularity over it. So I mean it's not like she'd be one of six Charlottes in her class, as it was with Jennifer and Jessica when I was little.."

It might even breed resentment.  Why don't you wait until the baby gets here and see if a name comes to you?  Otherwise Abigail seems close."
namenerds,3b6u5k,istara,15,Fri Jun 26 14:35:40 2015 UTC,"Preaching to the choir here. I can't believe my husband is serious about this. I keep waiting for the ""....just joking!"" but he swears he's serious. That's why I'm hoping there's a nice name that could be shortened to Abda but she'll still get a normal name. Either that or he comes to his senses and we choose a name based on nothing to do with Abda!"
namenerds,3b6u5k,WillowsBoredNow,11,Fri Jun 26 14:49:31 2015 UTC,"I can second the resentment notion. I was seven when my mom asked what my new little sister's middle name should be. Of course, I dreamed how amazing it would be to one day tell my sis that I chose part of her name for her. How close we would then be!  The name I chose? Marie. To match my own. Marie. The same middle name of basically half the female population born in the 90s. My little sis is now a teenager and while we get along well enough, she positively hates me for picking Marie. I don't blame her. I'm not a fan of it myself.  I also second Ada and Abigail as very pretty variations of Abda."
namenerds,3b6u5k,Chabopple,24,Fri Jun 26 21:13:50 2015 UTC,"I love the name Ada, and it’s pretty close. I also love Aubrey, which wouldn’t be too far a stretch to nickname Abda.     Or Abigail and Abbey are options too.   I agree with you. I don’t think you should name your child after some random sound a toddler made. I think if your daughter ends up not liking it, and knows you just let her brother name her whatever random thing he liked…..well, if it was me I wouldn’t like that."
namenerds,3b6u5k,Chabopple,6,Fri Jun 26 13:32:28 2015 UTC,"Aubrey is really pretty!

Luckily my parents didn't listen to me and named her something totally normal, but nonetheless my entire family called her Boo until she was old enough to make us stop. I mean like teens.  My point is, a family nickname doesn't have to translate to an actual legal name. You can let her brother call her whatever he wants! But name her something that you and your husband  (and most importantly the baby herself) won't hate when she's older."

namenerds,3b6u5k,BabyNewf,5,Sat Jun 27 06:26:03 2015 UTC,"Adelaide or Adaline could be Ada. Toddler's can't quite say things right, so Ada would probably sound like Abda. I think Abigail would be the perfect choice- my neighbor's baby is named Abigail, and her older sister calls her what sounds like Abda/Abga to me.  I let my 3 year old name her baby sister. She overhead a discussion in the car about names and latched onto one and kept referring to the baby as that name, and it stuck. Luckily, it was an actual name and we liked it, but it's not nuts to let the older sibling help pick a name. My oldest likes to talk about how she named her sister."

namenerds,3b6u5k,kalanitres,2,Fri Jun 26 18:15:30 2015 UTC,I'd say Alba or Abra. Both real names and very close to Abda!

namenerds,3b6u5k,TwoCoffinsForSleep,2,Mon Jun 29 04:55:09 2015 UTC,Do you like the name Abigail? I could see Abda as a sibling nickname.
namenerds,3b6u5k,georgelovesgene,1 point,Fri Jun 26 13:17:15 2015 UTC,I don't really care for Abigail (I don't like names that end in -gail or -lynn) but Abbie isn't bad. But then it sounds quite similar to my son's name so that probably doesn't work. Thank you for coming up with a suggestion though! I feel a little hopeful now that maybe there is some sort of compromise.  Either that or I'll just fill in the paperwork after birth and give her a nice normal name.
namenerds,3b6u5k,SansPantsAfterWork,4,Fri Jun 26 13:22:35 2015 UTC,I also think these could work:  Adrianna/Adrienne  Adeline  Adelaide   Aubrey/Audrey  Addison

namenerds,3b78gi,RobinKilliams888,4,Fri Jun 26 15:12:08 2015 UTC,Shiloh is one of my favorite names despite the connection to the dog. The other names on your list don't really speak to me. Here are some suggestions:   Alistair Dashiell Kingsley Lionel Preston Sterling Vaughn Wesley
namenerds,3b78gi,injest_,3,Fri Jun 26 15:52:34 2015 UTC,Kingsley Shaklebolt?!  I'm going to bed now.
namenerds,3b78gi,bnm3424,3,Sat Jun 27 05:50:44 2015 UTC,"Jude can be a nickname for Julian (e.g. John Lennon's son) if you like it, and it's maybe more substantial.  I'd also suggest the following:  Patrick  Beckett  Donovan  Franklin  Otto  Dorian  Darren  Cormac  Theodore  Callum  Elliott"
namenerds,3b78gi,kalanitres,3,Fri Jun 26 16:01:17 2015 UTC,"My favorite from your list is definitely Shiloh! I also love Atticus, Jude, and Jonah as well. I'm not a fan of Liam, it's a fine name but just seems lackluster to me.   I agree about Atticus being everywhere lately, that got it taken off my own list. Jude and Jonah are a bit plain, and they're both rising in popularity a lot lately. Some of the 'longer versions' of Jude may work for you: Judah, Julian, Julius.  Other suggestions  River  Atlas  Caspian  Amos  Thaddeus  Miles  Langston  Truman  Rafferty  Cillian  Casper  Forester  Foster  Harvey  Malachy  Cormac  Inigo  Boaz  Luca  Lucian  Enoch  Dominic  Reid/Reed  Phineas  Felix  Hugo  Arthur  Elliott  Linus  Lionel  Jude and Jonah are both short, strong, well known but not too common. Atticus is long and distinctive sounding and almost never used until everyone started hopping on the bandwagon a few years ago. Shiloh is probably the strangest, it's somewhere in-between Jude and Jonah & Atticus, it's short and strong like Jude and Jonah, but about as uncommon as Atticus was 10 years ago and just as distinctive. So I tried to find you some names names that fit somewhere in that spectrum."
namenerds,3b78gi,Apasstles,2,Fri Jun 26 18:16:49 2015 UTC,"I adore Jude and Jonah. Liam is way too popular for my taste, and Shiloh I think is trending more feminine.

namenerds,3b78gi,Jewert,2,Sat Jun 27 00:17:59 2015 UTC,"I LOVE Jonah!   How about using an Irish or Cherokee middle name?  Cherokee especially seems cool to me, but everyone on here knows the Irish also have some name gems no one in the USA is ever going to spell right so it might be nice to pick one as middle name instead of a first name."
namenerds,3b78gi,Kadamba,1 point,Sat Jun 27 13:15:27 2015 UTC,"Some names with an 's' sound in the middle:  Aesop  Ashton  Augustus  Austin  Casimir  Cesar  Cosmo  Crispin  Desmond  Dustin  Ernest  Eustace  Gustav  Hassan  Isaac  Jasper  Jesse  Moses  Oscar  Preston  Russell  Sebastian  Sylvester  Tristan  I also really like Oisin, but that one might cause some pronunciation difficulties if you’re not in Ireland."

Luca Kai St Clair is just too much, I think."

I know a grown male Carson and I have to say the name ages really well. I would go with James as the middle name from your options. Carson James St. Clair sounds wonderful to me.   I would automatically get rid of Jackson with both of your suggested spellings. Jack on its own is a better option in my opinion.   And I understand your hesitation with Luca and would scratch that too. You've got a good list going! Good luck finding one you absolutely love. It can take a LONG time."

We're pretty set on it now, we both love it and it's a lot better than my husband's initial ideas - Tasman for a boy, Oceania for a girl, Zeal for either. If we hadn't've found Tui, we would probably have just gone with the initials NZ.  I'm surprised that it's not even listed on any of the baby name sites I frequent. It's a nature name, it's unusual but not 'made up', it's short and strong and a bit exotic sounding, it has a lot of the things people are looking for in a name now days yet I never hear anyone mention it."

Either way, it's only three letters, and I think it's a name that once you hear it and see the spelling together, it makes sense.  I have a somewhat common 6 letter name with a pretty straightforward spelling & pronunciation, but it's misspelled, mispronounced, or mistaken for another name all the time. I'm sure if I gave my kid a name because it was easy to spell & pronounce, it would get misspelled & mispronounced all the time anyways.

namenerds,3b3fnl,Grave_Girl,11,Fri Jun 26 11:16:35 2015 UTC,"Vander literally means ""from the"".  Any time you meet someone whose last name is Van der _____ or Vander_____, it's a surname telling you where they're from.  I don't see it translating well as a first name."
namenerds,3b3fnl,istara,3,Thu Jun 25 21:02:48 2015 UTC,I agree. It looks like part of a Dutch surname to me.
namenerds,3b3fnl,Creepthan_Frome,7,Fri Jun 26 07:55:36 2015 UTC,"That's part of why I like it.  My maiden name starts with VonDey.  I am the third daughter of an only son of an only son, and the lineage of my last name ended when I got married, so I want it to carry over some how.  And it's not like I made it up.  It is a first name. English meaning is archer. Greek meaning is good man."
namenerds,3b3fnl,Creepthan_Frome,1 point,Fri Jun 26 11:14:26 2015 UTC,"Where did you get those translations, out of curiosity? Because I only see the translation of EVANDER as yielding those meanings."

But Vander is also considered a nickname for Evander, so I'm assuming that's where the good man part came from.  I'm not huge on meanings anyway.... the other name I really liked was Everett and most baby name books had the meaning as ""boar"""
namenerds,3b3fnl,daybeforetheday,3,Mon Jun 29 13:06:03 2015 UTC,"In the same camp as you, but I might be prejudiced because I speak Dutch. Vander just looks really weird to me!"
namenerds,3b3fnl,flapjacksal,2,Fri Jun 26 08:42:21 2015 UTC,"I can see where confusion might come in on that part, but that's part of why I like it.  It's like my last name which is German/Dutch.  I live in Ohio.. I doubt we get many Dutch speakers there!"
namenerds,3b3fnl,pamplemus,5,Fri Jun 26 17:34:56 2015 UTC,I like it. I'm a sucker for V names though. And Van is a badass nickname.

I don't think so, but I could be wrong, I should google it."" But then I realized that if I have that thought (i.e. that it's not a real/full name) so will many other people, so regardless of whether it's an actual full ""real name"" or not, I'd go for ""Evander"" instead and then of course you could use Vander as a nickname."
namenerds,3b3fnl,Kadamba,2,Fri Jun 26 15:02:12 2015 UTC,It IS a name though... I'm just not a fan of Evander
namenerds,3b2b09,RoDoBenBo,9,Thu Jun 25 11:56:42 2015 UTC,"Some of my thoughts:   Ania- love it on its own or as a diminutive. Would you be willing to compromise by naming her Anna and calling her Ania? Anna seems to be more international. Malina- I personally dislike Mal- prefix names due to the ""bad"" meaning, but this is just the opinion of one internet stranger. Does Melina appeal to you? Lena- love it and think it's plenty feminine. Also very international. Would it bother you if her first name and surname begin with L?   Edit: black sticky poo per /u/sticklittlenugget"
namenerds,3b2b09,kalanitres,2,Thu Jun 25 12:45:06 2015 UTC,Anna is nice but seems too obvious and a bit of a boring choice.  The L alliteration with Lena might be what's bugging me about it...I dunno. I can't put my finger on it.
namenerds,3b2b09,sticklittlenugget,4,Thu Jun 25 13:57:48 2015 UTC,"I like Ania a lot. Just FYI, Malina is (I assume) pronounced the same as Melena, which is a word for black sticky poo. You might get medical professionals raising an eyebrow though I don't think it's commonly known in general. My friend named her daughter Melina and a lot of her friends had a private giggle at the name. To them it was a very odd name to choose."
namenerds,3b2b09,EebilKitteh,4,Thu Jun 25 13:38:33 2015 UTC,Oh crap (pun not intended)! Good to know! In Polish it means 'raspberry' but it might not work so well internationally!

namenerds,3b2b09,megananimous,3,Thu Jun 25 17:17:07 2015 UTC,"I think my favorite of the ones you listed is Ania. Lina, in my opinion, sounds more like a nickname.

namenerds,3b2b09,PetiteCaresse,3,Thu Jun 25 13:23:45 2015 UTC,"Helena is nice but we're trying to avoid certain sounds that would make the name be pronounced differently in different languages. In French it would sound exactly like Elena which is also pretty but the name of one of our friend's girlfriends.  I also really like Hanna, which also has the 'h' problem but SO vetoed that one anyway!   We're also avoiding 'j' which is pronounced like 'y' in Polish and also 'v' which is written instead as 'w' in Polish. It certainly limits our options!"

namenerds,3b1nu0,makinthebakin,3,Thu Jun 25 06:59:11 2015 UTC,I really like this name for someone 18 or older. I have trouble imagining a little boy named Warren and strongly dislike the nickname Ren or Wren for a boy. Any other suggestions for nicknames?
namenerds,3b1nu0,errthingbagel,11,Thu Jun 25 10:57:07 2015 UTC,What is it with this sub and nicknames? Who cares really if a name doesn't have good nickname potential. My kid's nicknames developed organically and have nothing to do with her name.
namenerds,3b1nu0,senorita_nips,2,Thu Jun 25 13:44:56 2015 UTC,I agree about the nicknames! I have a really short name and basically have no nickname. Life has never been a problem not having one.

namenerds,3b1nu0,makinthebakin,1 point,Thu Jun 25 19:51:32 2015 UTC,"It's not that I need this name to have a nickname, more that I find Warren to be a very adult sounding name and I think would be easier on a young boy if there was a younger sounding nickname. I personally don't have a nickname because my name works well on a baby, child, young adult, and older adult but not all names have that vibe so the nickname compensates through different life stages."

namenerds,3b1nu0,NameIdeas,2,Thu Jun 25 06:42:15 2015 UTC,"Warren is a great name.  It's an older sounding name, but a lot of them are coming back into style.  Reminds me of Warren Buffet (the second richest man in the world, first richest from investments) and Warren Worthington III - Angel/Archangel from the X-Men comics.  It's also one of those names you don't hear often.  I often see people say...""but it doesn't have a nickname"" and my response is...""Who cares?""  Not all names need a nickname.  Go for it."
namenerds,3b1nu0,Allegretta,2,Thu Jun 25 13:59:02 2015 UTC,"I actually really like Warren. It's strong, masculine, sounds like it would age well, easy to spell, but isn't common at all."
namenerds,3b1nu0,ching_chong_peruna,3,Thu Jun 25 17:44:54 2015 UTC,Classic and underused. It's an older name but one that I don't associate exclusively with old men like I would with Marvin or Melvin.

I like alliteration, but the -g- -g- with Carrigan Margaret kind of makes me think of a train chundering along a railway line. And with Tagg it almost sounds comical.  I really think you need to offset Tagg somehow (soften it).  Eg ""Caroline Tagg"" adds elegance, whereas ""Carrigan Tagg"" sounds like something from a Dickens novel."

It's not terrible, but it's just kind of there to me."
namenerds,3azuwx,darkpurple_,8,Wed Jun 24 20:58:19 2015 UTC,"Colby: honestly just makes me think of the cheese (I would probably snicker a little if I met someone with this name, sorry if I come across as mean, but really, I'm just picturing a giant block of cheese walking and talking...) Avery: I much prefer this for males, to the extent that it makes me a little bit disappointed that America has decided to feminize it. I love this name, but for boys. On girls, it's okay, I suppose, but there are other names that I like a lot more. Rhyan: purposely misspelled/""yoonique"" names are not my style. Ryan becoming a bit trendy for girls in America, but I don't see it as gender neutral. Shea: interesting. I quite like this equally well for both genders. River: a little bit hippyish, but not excessively so. Not my favorite name, but a nice choice. Riley: I will always consider this to be more of a dog name than a human name, but it's quite popular, so clearly that's just me having a strange association. It's decent. Morgan: if you're brave enough to use this for a boy, I think it's awesome. On a girl it's not anywhere near as cool, though I do like it. Taylor: I don't like the association with either Taylor Swift or Taylor Lautner, but you might (or you might not care).   If I was giving my child a gender neutral first name, I would want to give them an obviously feminine/masculine middle name, depending on their gender. The kid might not be as enthused about gender neutrality, so the middle name would them an option that clearly reflects their sex. Discounting my preferences for the names as individuals, I think the following combinations flow well together:   Avery Shea Shea Morgan Taylor Morgan   It's difficult to pair them up because of all the ""r"" and ""y"" sounds that bleed together. Plus using River makes it sound like I'm describing a location (""the banks of the River Morgan are home to a number of indigenous species..."" ""located to the south of the Riley River, the town of..."")."
namenerds,3azuwx,injest_,6,Wed Jun 24 21:22:02 2015 UTC,"Just FYI you don't come across mean at all. In fact, I was laughing along all the way through your reply. You brought up some really good points. Thanks!   Added an edit to clarify, mostly in the case of Rhyan, that we aren't attached to any spellings in particular. I'm actually not even sure why I chose to write this as Rhyan vs Ryan.  As far as River in particular goes, I've noticed from the people we talk to it's realllly hit or miss. Me and SO are both very hippy-ish so it totally fits in with our lifestyle and parenting styles and just our whole vibe as a family. I have a friend whose son is named Bridger, and that actually kind of inspired our choice in this name!  You pretty much summed up my feelings on Morgan. It's SO's favorite, but I guess I prefer it as a middle name.   You also nailed my favorite combo (Taylor Morgan) so fist bump lol. But I wasn't going to put that in the post because I didn't want to sway anyone one way or another.  Thanks for your thoughts! I appreciate it!"

If River fits with your family's image, then I think it's a fine name. I just found it difficult to come up with a second name that works well with River and doesn't sound too much like the name of a place.  Taylor Morgan is solid. If Morgan is your SO's favorite, I think it'll be nice to include it somewhere in the name."
namenerds,3azuwx,istara,2,Wed Jun 24 22:49:16 2015 UTC,"Morgan is one of the more neutral/unisex names on there, though I tend to see it as female (Morgan Le Fay etc).  Taylor Morgan I would 100% expect a girl."

If you are okay with that, it's pretty for a girl and cute for a boy. Beware of Taylor Swift connotations- I don't think she's going away anytime soon.  I love the name Morgan for a girl, but for some reason not as much for a boy. I know a boy named Morgan, and it's fine, but for some reason I don't like it as much.  Shea and River are awesome middle names!  Avery is getting very popular for a girl.   How about Ryanne for a girl or Ryan for a boy? Rhyan is very, very nice, I love it, but people are going to misspell it. As long as you don't mind, use it. (Honestly people are going to misspell just about any name anyway.)"

Taylor Swift is popular amongst our generation, but probably won't be important to baby's generation, and same for Taylor Lautner (eyeroll). Obviously these names will be more popular than others we like, but as far as I know they don't top the list, so we're not really worried about it :)  Shea and River are definitely my favorite middle names. I'm glad you agree!  Ryan is one of the least neutral names on our list. The spelling will probably be changed, depending on what the sex is. I really love Ryanne, although the pronunciation might get skewed to ri-ANNE, but I'm not sure that's really a problem besides that it's fairly similar to our older daughter's name (Deanna).

I also only see Riley and Taylor being suggested for girls, and possibly Morgan too.  Just bear this in mind for a boy. If you choose two names that are ""crossing the fence"" it will cause confusion, particularly if they are firmly established as female names in a decade's time.  For example, you'd be highly unlikely to call a boy Meredith Jocelyn these days, even though both were originally male names. They've crossed over completely.  For sheer unisex, your best bet is River.  River Morgan would be pretty much 50:50 neutral to me if I heard it. I don't think I would guess the gender.  River inclines me very slightly male, Morgan slightly female, so it balances out."

I thought it was totally weird that they thought if I didn't know the sex I'd be looking at a unisex name.  I feel like there are unisex names on my list, but I like them better for one sex than the other. I couldn't just choose a unisex name and slap it on the baby no matter if they were a boy or a girl."
namenerds,3azuwx,RageKage,5,Thu Jun 25 02:12:06 2015 UTC,"Jamie is actually my SO's name! lol. It's a great name. I definitely think the approach we are taking is unique, but I think the idea of picking any name ahead of time, and just slapping it on a baby regardless is weird - yet that's what most people seem to do. We want to narrow it down so that we are prepared, but don't plan on choosing any one in particular ahead of time regardless of sex. I don't know if it came off that way in my post, but our intentions are not to avoid personalization, but rather the typical femininity/masculinity that comes with most names."

I've never met someone with that name, so I have no reference point for which pronunciation is the norm, if there even is a ""norm.""

However, I met a person with the name recently and they pronounced it ""Lay-ton."" I'd guess that is the more common pronunciation for the name, but it could probably go either way!   P.S. - I should add that it's an extremely small town, so there's probably not many people who would be able to make that association. Also I just thought of the actress Leighton Meester, which is also pronounced ""Lay-ton."" And the person I met with the name was a guy, so I do think of it as a more of a guy's name.

namenerds,3assfl,Oblivinatior,3,Tue Jun 23 11:04:54 2015 UTC,Having a croatian grandmother I really should have read this correctly. But I didn't until you mentioned slavic movie. I thought Zenga! Which I'm fairly sure isn't even the right way to read it in english so I'm not a clever man it seems.   That said it looks really cool but plenty of other idiots like myself will read it wrong.
namenerds,3assfl,Axenus,3,Tue Jun 23 05:47:38 2015 UTC,"With the X pronounced like a Z? Xenja/Xenia is a not uncommon Slavic name, but it's pronounced Ksen-ya, not Zenya. If you want Zenya, definitely spell it with a Z. There's also Zhenya, though that's supposed to be pronounced differently, but you'll probably get it pronounced Zenya anyway. But no, I definitely don't think it's too weird of a name."
namenerds,3assfl,Call_me_Cassius,2,Tue Jun 23 16:56:08 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's too different. Definitely not that hard to pronounce, even if people might say it wrong the first time around, they'll pick it up after being corrected once. And honestly?

namenerds,3assfl,LiddedPotArena,4,Tue Jun 23 07:49:12 2015 UTC,But people know Tchaikovsky. Every teacher who reads the roll is going to have to work it out. I reckon half of them are going to get it wrong the first time.

namenerds,3apzwc,Allegretta,14,Mon Jun 22 18:55:59 2015 UTC,"I think you are taking it too literally. I'm not saying that kids can't reflect the parent's interests, but there is a point when it becomes too much. Music is our life, and we live and breath it. Using names that are so overtly musical just seems cheesy. If we were to pick something more subtle like Clara (for Clara Schumann), it would be one thing. But naming them something musical just seems trite and uncreative. That's my opinion. Others may have a different one and that's fine. I would be annoyed if my parents named me after their careers. Kids should have their own identities, which is a big reason I also don't like using family names. But to each their own."
namenerds,3apzwc,ElScorcho84,6,Mon Jun 22 19:36:54 2015 UTC,Agreed - I know 2 music teachers who named their daughters Harmony and Melody and their son is named Lyric. Yuck.

namenerds,3apzwc,Kadamba,7,Tue Jun 23 04:30:27 2015 UTC,"Could you please explain the part about them being Dutch? Is it something about how ""x"" is pronounced?"
namenerds,3apzwc,Allegretta,4,Tue Jun 23 02:03:03 2015 UTC,"Nope, just giving a little context! It's just as cringe-worthy having the names be mirror images of each other in Dutch as it is in English."
namenerds,3apzwc,BrownieBawse,0,Wed Jun 24 15:18:21 2015 UTC,"In Dutch the ""x"" is pronounced ""ks"" I always assumed it was the same for English but I have only heard of Xander being pronounced with a ""z"". So maybe they are diffferent?  Or maybe I am just sleepdeprived."
namenerds,3apzwc,Casey25,3,Wed Jun 24 15:54:56 2015 UTC,"It highly depends on the word in English. For instance, Xavier is Ksavier, but Xenia is Zenia."
namenerds,3apzwc,Kadamba,1 point,Wed Jun 24 16:12:42 2015 UTC,"You need another letter before the x for it to sound like ks. Otherwise, it'll just sound like a z. The reasoning behind this is that it'd be really hard to go from silence to a ks sound. A vowel at the front makes the transition easier.  Eg: Spanish  Xilofono - Xul. X in the first position so it's pronounced like a z  Extraño - oximoron. X is not in the first position so it's pronounced like ks"
namenerds,3apzwc,Allegretta,1 point,Mon Jun 22 17:14:16 2015 UTC,"You're right that it's challenging to pronounce a word starting with ""ks"". However, /u/Kadamba is also correct to say that in Dutch, words that start with ""x"" are nevertheless pronounced as starting with ""ks"". An example would be ""xylofoon"" (""xylophone""), which is pronounced ""ksilofoon"" (""ksilophone"")."
namenerds,3apzwc,Kurisuchein,0,Mon Jun 22 17:55:24 2015 UTC,"Oh so that is why X is sometimes like ""z"" and and sometimes ""ks"", interesting. Thanks for telling me!"

Now that we have gotten older, though, and our circle of friends and acquaintances has widened, I don't mind going by Alexandra, and she goes by Cassandra sometimes. Our middle names do rhyme too, though, and mom just chalks it up to ""I was young and stupid."" In the end though, I don't think either of us hates our name."

Would that make the ""Theo"" nickname THAY-o?   If so, I feel like that might be a lifetime of correcting people's pronounciation, and I wouldn't be into that.  But--maybe not. Google shows ""real"" LoTR fans complaining about how it's said in the movies (Thee-oh-den) v. how Tolkien intended (Thay-oh-den).

But our last name is very common, so I fear running into someone with the same First, middle, and last name.    I'm a big fan of one-syllable middle names following longer first names.   Almost everyone is, which is why those names become common fillers."

Besides Clarice I don't think any of the middle names sound too french, and I've met some people with the name Celeste, and Simone, so I wouldn't worry about that.   Out of that batch I like Genevieve Simone and Claire. I don't think Claire sounds like a filler name. I would use it if it flows well with your last name.   For the longer combinations..... I like Cornelia. It's a classy name you have some family ties to, and it doesn't have too many vowels. Since it's a harder sounding name it would fit well beside a more flowery first name.

namenerds,3aq7lg,Kadamba,2,Mon Jun 22 18:05:30 2015 UTC,"Thanks! I'm glad to hear someone else that likes it. I've always loved Cornelia, but so many people hate it when I mention it."
namenerds,3aq7lg,Kadamba,2,Mon Jun 22 18:10:51 2015 UTC,I really like Genevieve Claire.  I think it's because it's the only one on the list with a single syllable.  I really like shorter middle names paired with longer first names. Some other short options:  Genevieve Belle  Genevieve June  Genevieve Rose
namenerds,3aq7lg,sweetiebear,3,Mon Jun 22 17:38:07 2015 UTC,"Thanks! I'm more of a long name person, and I usually hate filler names. Rose doesn't work with our surname, since it uses the same sounds. Plus, every child I meet has the middle name Rose. But I can understand why people love them so much, since those names sound nice with a lot of first names."
namenerds,3aq477,thebabywithbathwater,5,Mon Jun 22 16:24:42 2015 UTC,My votes are for Morgan Rose and Maxwell Ryan. I don't usually like when names start with the same letter but Morgan Matilda is really cute too. I can totally picture a little spunky pigtailed freckled Morgan Matilda toddler. The only names I don't really care for on your legit are Harper and Asher mainly because of popularity. Are you guys Jewish? Asher is a very traditional Jewish name to me. Harper is very trendy with the bohemian Instagram loving mamas in my area.
namenerds,3aq477,liabenn,3,Mon Jun 22 16:34:21 2015 UTC,"We are actually jewish, but pretty reform/casual jews.  Asher's probably the least likely of the list anyway because it's a bit of a stretch with the initials.  The names we are trying to honor with initials are M, R, and G with the possibilities of H."
namenerds,3aq477,imapumpkinseed,2,Mon Jun 22 16:36:45 2015 UTC,"Maxwell Ryan - Maxwell is nice, though Max is too trendy for my taste. Ryan seems dated to me. I would prefer Maxwell Graham.  Gabriel Malcolm - This is my favorite! Love both names.  Asher Graham - I love this one, too. I would slightly prefer Asher Gabriel, but Graham is OK.  Girls:  Morgan Rose - Eh. It's not terrible, but it doesn't excite me. Morgan seems slightly dated, maybe mid/late 90s to me. Rose is nice but very filler as a MN. Would you consider it for a first?  Rowan Matilda - love this one. My favorite by far. I don't usually love Rowan on a girl, but Matilda is so sweet, feminine and old fashioned that it balances out.  Harper Rose - Honestly I'm getting sick of Harper! Seems like every other baby is a Harper Grace or Harper Rose. Verrrry trendy in many areas.  Gabrielle Rose - this is nice, I just don't love Gabrielle. Actually I like this one reversed - Rose Gabrielle :)"
namenerds,3aq477,istara,2,Mon Jun 22 19:51:00 2015 UTC,"I love Gabriel Graham - the GG is cool.  Or Gabriel Ryan is glorious.  For girls, LOATHE Harper, it's hideous and trendy, LOVE Rowan, Gabrielle and Rose.  I would go for Rowan Rose for the beautiful alliteration and assonance. It makes it much more unusual but still very elegant."

namenerds,3aq477,BurnBrightNight,1 point,Mon Jun 22 17:28:58 2015 UTC,"Boys:  Maxwell Ryan - It works, Max is a name you can never really go wrong with.   Gabriel Malcolm - Eh, just my personal taste, but i'm not feeling it.  Asher Graham - Asher is a name that always makes me think it's unfinished, as if you're dropping a syllable or two because of poor speech. I'd prefer Graham.  Girls:  Morgan Rose - I don't think Morgan is pretty at all, and Rose is a filler middle name. Rose as a first name however, all for.   Rowan Matilda - Matilda should be a first name to me, Rowan is a name I associate with men more, namely because of this wonderful man.  Harper Rose (not sure on the alliteration with our last name?) - HRH, Her Royal Highness. Yes, leave be. Harper - given it's recent popularity and a common filler middle name... it doesn't inspire me.   Gabrielle Rose - Gabrielle has such an awful nickname; Gabby. it's just a slur for someone who speaks too much, like gobby. It's just such a pretty name though.   I have to ask, Rose appears three times in your girls names; why not consider it for a first name? It's beautiful and timeless."
namenerds,3aq477,BurnBrightNight,1 point,Mon Jun 22 18:41:12 2015 UTC,"I actually considered Rose a lot for a first name - I just COULD not find a middle name that I liked with it. Like, at all.

namenerds,3appxq,corgidogmom,9,Mon Jun 22 14:31:04 2015 UTC,"I adore the name Niamh. Let me suggest, though, that you consider an ""easier"" middle name to pair with it. That gives your child options.   Now, if you actually are in Ireland, go for it! 😃"
namenerds,3appxq,BabyNewf,1 point,Mon Jun 22 15:14:36 2015 UTC,"We don't live in Ireland, but we are heavily in the Irish American 'scene' I guess.  Most of the babies I know have very Irish names (Mícheál, Blaithin, Mallaidh, Eilidh, Aoibheann, Maeve etc) so I'm not too worried about it being an insurmountable burden. It is likely this baby will grow up playing traditional music and spending a lot of time in Ireland each year. So it might be an annoying first day of school, but it should be fine outside of class.  I always found my name to be obnoxiously American sounding in the context of where I spend my time etc. I always hated having my name called at competitions because it sounds so American. (Maybe I am heavily projecting my feelings onto this baby, but it's ok)"
namenerds,3appxq,BabyNewf,3,Mon Jun 22 16:31:08 2015 UTC,"My daughter has a traditional Irish name, although we use the Latin spelling. (Is é a ainm Ánora, i nGaeilge.) We made sure to make her middle a bit more accessible, so she had options later in life. Considering the difficulties with her name, I'm glad she has that option.  To each their own, though. If she's really annoyed, she can always choose something else as an adult."
namenerds,3appxq,BabyNewf,3,Mon Jun 22 19:26:59 2015 UTC,"One thing we have been talking about is having an easy to pronounce name first that is still Irish (because I feel like having such an irish name with something else will sound odd - like Niamh Brittany just seems weird to me).  So something like Fiona Niamh or Brigid Niamh etc so the first name is easy to say and she can let acquaintances call her that if she wants.  My husband does this - his first name is John but he goes by his Scottish middle name.  If he's just at the doctor's office or something he just lets everyone call him John, but if he is actually interacting long term he will introduce himself as his middle name.  That way there's no butchering of pronunciation and any correcting is easy (Niamh is easy to say just not easy to read)"
namenerds,3appxq,PrahaPrincess,3,Mon Jun 22 20:12:13 2015 UTC,"That's a good plan. Do you like Orla? (That's really hard to mess up, I think.)"
namenerds,3appxq,istara,6,Mon Jun 22 20:24:45 2015 UTC,Is (Neeve) how you pronounce Niamh? I'll be honest I have never seen that name so I wouldn't how how to say it!
namenerds,3appxq,PrahaPrincess,2,Mon Jun 22 15:46:21 2015 UTC,"Yes it's pronounced somewhere in between ""Neeve"" and ""Nee-uhv""  It's one syllable, but the v is sort of broad like it would be after the 'uh' sound."
namenerds,3appxq,lesballoonssportif,3,Mon Jun 22 16:19:41 2015 UTC,"Interesting! I never would have guessed that. I'm supposing Irish/Gaelic gives it the ""v"" sound? Sounds very pretty!   If it has a long Ee sound, I would maybe not use Fiona because that also has the same sound - it might blend into NeeFiona."
namenerds,3appxq,kalanitres,5,Mon Jun 22 17:10:40 2015 UTC,"""Mh"" is either ""w"" or ""v"" in Irish, depending on the nearest vowels."
namenerds,3appxq,PrincessMa,3,Mon Jun 22 19:28:29 2015 UTC,That's a really good point.  Maybe if we use Fiona we would put it first to avoid the f/v hybrid.  The heavy EE is the biggest obstacle I'm hitting with names.  It's a very common emphasized vowel in Irish so I'm finding lots of names end up being too heavy on the EE to go with Niamh.
namenerds,3appxq,nikkichita,2,Mon Jun 22 18:25:20 2015 UTC,We have that problem with our last name - it ends in Er and a lot of boy names that we like end in Er!

namenerds,3aox0v,am1986,9,Mon Jun 22 09:38:46 2015 UTC,"This is the perfect opportunity. Just introduce yourself as Lily! If a professor calls out Leslie, pipe up ""I go by Lily."" Tons of people will be telling the prof what they go by, it won't be awkward. As for the friend from high school - one person calling you Leslie (if she's rude enough to do so) isn't going to negate you introducing yourself as Lily. People will just think she's weird.   My sister changed her nickname in college. I still call her by her full name or her ""kid"" nickname, even around her friends. It doesn't make an impact on what they call her at all."
namenerds,3aox0v,imapumpkinseed,10,Mon Jun 22 11:31:40 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't even mention that you're called Leslie. Just ""Hello, I'm Lily.""  As for people who already know you as Leslie...

After changing it to my actual name, as hard as it has been for some people to get used to, most of my friends now understand that this is my name, and have adapted. =] I introduce myself to new people as that name [obviously], and they don't need to be any the wiser of the name I was given before it."
namenerds,3aox0v,Somegeezer,5,Mon Jun 22 09:50:19 2015 UTC,"Lily is perfect. I would just switch to that and see if you can change it formally.  Just tell the girl if you see her that you've switched to your nickname of Lily, and have taken it as a full name."

No one ever batted an eye.  I also knew a girl with a very feminine name who had a very, unrelated, gender neutral nickname.

My family still called me ""Leslie"" but eventually after all the people in my life started calling me by ""Lily"" they moved over to that name, too.  I got my name changed to ""Lily"" as something called my ""preferred name"" on my university records (I think you can just ask for this), and the same when I signed the forms on my new job, so things like my email signature at work and name badge/etc all say ""Lily"".   It was really easy and to be honest I didn't think twice about the whole thing!   My boyfriend's name is Andrew but his nickname is Sparky, and he often does what you do: he says ""Hi, my name is Andrew, but everyone calls me Sparky"", or, even worse, he just says ""Hi, my name is Andrew"" and then people are confused when later on I talk about ""Sparky""!

I always hated my nickname growing up, but that is what I was exclusively called by everyone from childhood.

The only thing I thought of that might make it a problem is if your surname is also a noun. Flux rhymes with a naughty word, and I can see some issues if his name is Johnny Flux Bush or Johnny Flux Katz."
namenerds,3andfu,SugarandSass,5,Sun Jun 21 23:05:35 2015 UTC,"Nope, surname is neither a noun nor something that could be used as a first name, so I don't think that'll be a problem. Thanks!"

We have agreed upon a first boy and first girl name (Henry Milan and Norah Elizabeth, respectively), but I am in love with Maris as a second girl's name and he wasn't very receptive to it.

It sounds like you prefer more classic but popular names and he likes trendy and popular. There's gotta be somewhere you can meet in the middle.   How are you searching for names? My suggestion would be to get a big list from somewhere (SSA ranking perhaps) and pick out all the names you like. Give that list to him  and ask him which he likes.   Also try this tool: http://nameberry.com/namehunter/#/boys  You can put in names you like and it will give suggestions similar in style. Try putting in a few names you like and a few your husband likes and see what comes out.

Henrietta sounds old fashioned in a non-trendy way, Freya is good, but you husband hates it. if you were going  go with Esmerelda, and just call her Zelda it makes much more sense to just call your daughter Zelda in the first place. (Unless you were naming her after someone, which is a bit different)"

namenerds,3aj5eb,nannywife,6,Sat Jun 20 18:26:01 2015 UTC,Our first babe is Evelyn Veronica (Evie). I just loved the name Evie and back in 2011 when we named her it wasn't popular at all. Husband wanted a more formal name and so we went with Evelyn. We wanted her initials to be EV like Evie and went with Veronica because it's a family name.   Second baby is Marlena Shae (Lanie). This little one was hard to name! Our first was named by 10 weeks but we didn't pick her name until 39 weeks. This time around it was switched; husband wanted Lanie but it felt incomplete to me so I picked Marlena because I think it's just a beautiful flowy name. Shae is after my brother.

Aubrey after my husband's sister who passed away before he was born. Violet Emilia. I suggested Violet because of Downton Abbey, but it's also my husband's great grandmother's name, so he okayed it. Emilia is my great grandmother's name."

Durice was my late mother-in-laws name.  Cadence Shiloh: Cadence because I like themed names and this one was one of the few names we both agreed upon, and Shiloh for my husbands late grandmother Shirley (again, naming for someone by using the first letter, or first three in this case).  Our third, if/when we have it, will probably be either an L or B first name, and most likely a V middle name for loved ones who have past since we were last expecting."

namenerds,3aizr1,jewel1997,1 point,Sun Jun 21 03:41:35 2015 UTC,Ultimately it is up to you what you decide to go by. I think it is a nice name and would consider it to be a male name because I know it is used for males in a few different cultures. The only association I have with the name is the character in the musical RENT who is a drag queen. Although I'm not sure how popular of an association that would be and overall it wouldn't be a big deal.

namenerds,3ai6gj,thepriceforciv,5,Sat Jun 20 12:39:16 2015 UTC,"Ideally, I wouldn't.  But in the interest of simplicity, Braden. At least then it doesn't have ""bray"" right there."
namenerds,3ai6gj,Creepthan_Frome,5,Sun Jun 21 02:04:37 2015 UTC,My first instinct would be to spell it Brayden because that's how I've seen it the majority of the time. I've seen Braden a couple of times too. Braiden might be mispronounced a lot as Bryden and and Braydon just looks like you're misspelling Brandon

namenerds,3ai6gj,hitsworth,5,Sun Jun 21 07:55:03 2015 UTC,"The most attractive spelling I've seen for it is ""Braeden,"" but honestly it's become so overused that it's one of those names now where you just roll your eyes and gag."

If someone named their kid Indiana, I would assume they really liked Indiana Jones. To say that you'd think someone was a big fan of the movie if they named their kid Inigo, after the main character isn't wrong and I would think the same.

I too would think of the state, but the Indiana Jones ref fit as well and I would think of the movies too. Inigo feels odd to say to me and I do want to say indigo. I don't really like the name.

Kruz does sound a bit funky to me, but I have meet a few Mavericks, so I think that name is more mainstream then some may give it credit for.   Out of all the girls names I like Indigo the most. Indigo is the most unique, but not so much that she'd get teased, and I love the nickname Indie. Evelyn just sounds too old fashioned, and Evie sounds like a pet name.

namenerds,3aedu6,olympiaa,11,Fri Jun 19 13:10:29 2015 UTC,"I used to worry a lot about popularity. One of my favorite names for a boy is James. It's a classic name, but I'd never met anyone with the first name James under the age of 30 (I do know one teenage Jimmy now though).  When I started really looking into baby names, I realized James was very popular according to the social security listings. Now it's number nine. The most popular it's been since 1992, supposedly.  But then I looked at how many boys were actually given the name. just over 7 thousand in 2014. The year I was born, it was #17 at 11,302 baby boys. It's actually less common now. The thing is, more and more people are choosing uncommon names, so the big, popular names, aren't actually as popular as you'd think."
namenerds,3aedu6,notnickjonass,5,Fri Jun 19 16:50:31 2015 UTC,"Thanks. This is also the conclusion that I am coming to as well. Names are still popular, but not as popular as they used to be so my fear of multiple kids in a class with the same name is probably unfounded."
namenerds,3aedu6,Allegretta,3,Fri Jun 19 16:56:14 2015 UTC,"Think about how many popular names there are compared to the one you like. Sure, Emilia may be well loved, but in a class of 30 or so kids, there's unlikely to be five or six. There are just so many other names in circulation."
namenerds,3aedu6,Erger,1 point,Fri Jun 19 19:11:57 2015 UTC,"Exactly! There was a point in time where something like 20% of baby girls were named Mary, and in the 1600s, almost 80% of baby boys born in England were named one of 5 names (I think they included Henry, John, Edward, maybe Charles and George?).  So even though a certain name might be #1, the percentage of babies born with that name is waaaaaaaaaaaay down from what it once was, since naming rules have relaxed and parents have gotten more creative."
namenerds,3aedu6,Allegretta,6,Mon Jun 22 03:02:19 2015 UTC,"It really does depend on the area you live in. It's also partially luck. My name was number 4 in popularity when I was born, but I was the only girl in my class with the name. All through university, I've often been the only one in my class with the name because there are so many international students. As an adult, I am surrounded by people of all ages, so I don't often meet people with my name, even though it is a very common name.   On the other hand, I've heard of people with unusual names not even ranking in the top 1000, managing to land in the same class as someone with their name. Sometimes it happens and you end up with a neighbor with the exact same name taste. The chances are smaller, but you never know.  I used to be so against giving common names, purely because I thought that they were somehow less special. But as I've aged, I realize that it isn't a big deal in the grand scheme of things. Having a common name never had a negative effect on me, and it didn't make the name any less special to my parents. If anything, it was easier because people always knew how to spell my name and I never had to repeat myself.   So, while there are many striking and beautiful unusual names, it's better to pick a name you love that's common, than to pick an uncommon one that you don't like as much just to be unique. You will ultimately regret giving up the name you love. Also, you can never predict what will rise in popularity in the future."
namenerds,3aedu6,playingdecoy,3,Fri Jun 19 19:06:21 2015 UTC,"I don't know if it is because of the Reddit population or what else it might be, but I have seen soooooo many Amelia/Emilias on /r/babybumps lately, I got the impression that the name is super popular right now. I guess I tend to notice it because my sister is Amelia, but she's 22 and the only one her age that I know. Meanwhile, I have two friends who have newborn Amelias, and I've seen at least three or four on BabyBumps in the last 3 months."
namenerds,3aedu6,drag0nslovetacos,2,Fri Jun 19 21:51:51 2015 UTC,It might be Reddit. I also browse the name website Nameberry and some names that probably aren't so popular in general seem to be really popular there.   I know only one Emilia in real life and she's 8. I don't think I've ever met an Amelia.

namenerds,3aewdh,fuzzybloomers,1 point,Fri Jun 19 15:56:57 2015 UTC,"I could see a pronunciation of eye-oh-nah if it were double l's (Exillona) but it still wouldn't be my first guess.

If it were Xilona it could maybe be pronounced like Ximena, which apparently has a ton of pronunciations but I've only heard he-men-uh irl, so eh-he-lo-nuh (which I think sounds really pretty!)

namenerds,3aewdh,BrownieBawse,2,Fri Jun 19 20:23:53 2015 UTC,It could be A-she-lona (with a long A sound). It looks Spanish to me.
namenerds,3aewdh,golocalsportsteam,1 point,Fri Jun 19 16:30:08 2015 UTC,If it sounds Spanish then the E can't be pronounced like an A.

It ended up taking us 16 hours after she was born to finally choose between the two names. My husband ended up saying 'she's Mabel' to which I agreed.  My mum was really touched that we used her Nana's name, and thinks her mum would have been so touched that we used her mother's name.   We've had so many good reactions to Mabel's name - it's old fashioned, but pretty. I've had a couple of new mums tell me it was their girls name if they'd had a daughter.    In my new mums group there's only 4 girls, and 2 of the girls are Anna and Anya - it would have been hilarious if we'd had an Annabel too.  One thing I didn't expect was people misspelling her name, which was definitely a possibility for Annabel. On a few occasions people have written Mable! o_O"

His parents had a bit of a tense divorce and he was getting a lot of snide remarks from the other side of the family. He never flat out said that was why he changed his mind but we both know it was. He also didn't like the chosen middle name but it's my great grandmothers name and since both our kids were to have names from his sides of the family then mine was going to be represented as well.  We ended going back to the drawing board completely, talked about names every single day, had a few settled on and didn't pick a new one until a week before she was born.  He had always loved the name Lanie but I felt like it was juvenile and incomplete so we decided on Marlena Shae and we call her Lanie. We had wanted another lyn name to match our first daughters but he liked Madelyn and Adelyn and I liked Jocelyn and Rosslyn so we scrapped that idea entirely.

Both of these guys are German so I don't think ethnicity will matter too much. So I don't think it would be weird if you named him Nicholas but called him Nico.  I do think Enzo would sound a little strange if you're not Italian at all.  There are plenty of other motorsport inspired names to choose from though, if that is his thing."

So I guess that could work; I don't think it's really been used since Wallis Simpson.  What was her middle name? Jo?  If so you could go with a variant like Joanne or maybe even Josephine (it's too popular for me, though, at 147 & rising).  Or maybe Jocelyn?  Or Joy?"

I'm personally not a fan of fruit names in general (Apple, Clementine, Olive, etc), so I'm biased against Persimmon as a first name I'm afraid. I think it would make an interesting and meaningful middle name given the context though.  How about Simone? Or even Persephone?  Sally can also be a diminutive of Sarah."
namenerds,3ac7ph,BruisedxEm0ti0ns,4,Thu Jun 18 22:47:25 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your condolence and reply. I have thought about the Sarah connection but that is my sister-in-law's first name. Some of the other variants might work, though, so I'll take a look at those. While I do really like both Simone and Persephone, those don't have the same connection to me. I am wondering if I could find some kind of connection through her birth month still - January. I do like the name Winter, which seems to be much more prevalent and lends itself to nicer nicknames.   I agree with your advice about keeping Persimmon as a middle name. I feel like Persimmon might seem too pet-like of a name to give to a child, but it definitely could be a safe middle name. Thanks again!"
namenerds,3ac7ph,Yarsl,6,Thu Jun 18 23:22:05 2015 UTC,A bit of a stretch but January is named after the Roman God Janus. You could name her Jane or Jan and that would be close.

What about using it as a middle name and going with a classic first name? Alice Persimmon, for example, would be a great combination that honors your grandmother."

It was already number 10 and thats like 10k births in the us or something, don't worry about it things will probably neeeever be on the same scale as Jennifer and Jessica and such were."
namenerds,3a9zva,kaseyyeaaah,3,Thu Jun 18 16:08:07 2015 UTC,"Exactly. Charlotte isn't popular because the royals used it, the royals used it because they liked it (on the shortlist of traditional names available) and are part of a bigger trend.  And some names are WAY more popular than parents might expect because of the diversity of spellings. When you adjust for for those spellings, Sophia (Sophia, Sofia) outranks Emma by over 7000 births, or 35% more common. This generation is NOT ""hi, I'm Sofia B."" but instead ""hi, I'm Sofia with an F""."
namenerds,3a9zva,Yarsl,1 point,Thu Jun 18 17:55:54 2015 UTC,"Yep. My name is very popular, and I still don't constantly meet people with the name or get lost in a sea of them."

namenerds,3aafp9,doessomewebdesign,5,Thu Jun 18 14:40:25 2015 UTC,"It doesn't really matter :). Everyone has different naming priorities, and if flow isn't important to you then it doesn't need to be a consideration. Your kid, your choice."
namenerds,3aafp9,injest_,1 point,Thu Jun 18 14:44:15 2015 UTC,"Oh cool! I'm glad. I'm really picky about names anyway, so having to stick to a certain flow would give me a really short pick. Thanks!"
namenerds,3aafp9,injest_,3,Thu Jun 18 14:45:00 2015 UTC,"No problem; I hope your baby is happy and healthy, regardless of how many syllables your decide to put in his/her name ;)."
namenerds,3aafp9,jrl2014,3,Thu Jun 18 14:46:25 2015 UTC,"That's the important part! My SO's two boys have fantastic Russian names, so I'm hoping to have one kid who sort of reflects a bit of Russian origin. Then again, their names mean 'Innocent' and 'Victory' :)"
namenerds,3aafp9,Allegretta,2,Thu Jun 18 16:10:11 2015 UTC,"Also, I think that the more you hear a name the better you think it flows. Also, it might flow better if the middle initial were included (even if just in writing)."
namenerds,3aafp9,jacobbaby,1 point,Thu Jun 18 15:32:57 2015 UTC,"Great point! Thanks. Once you get used to a name associated with a person, maybe you stop noticing it and it just 'works'?"
namenerds,3aafp9,istara,3,Thu Jun 18 16:10:46 2015 UTC,"Flow is really not that big of a deal. This is especially true if you really love the names you are using and they have great meaning to you. Of course, sometimes it can be a bit awkward if the first name rhymes with the surname or repeats sounds too much. But unless it's something that will subject the child to ridicule on a regular basis, I still wouldn't stress about it. Sometimes names with an offbeat flow stick out in a good way."
namenerds,3aafp9,TA818,3,Thu Jun 18 16:42:48 2015 UTC,Thanks! I'm definitely going to avoid anything that might upset my kid in the future. My surname's pretty good at not being used for teasing so I just need to be careful about their first name. It'll be their choice if they want other nicknames too - I fully get it if they don't like the names I end up giving them when they're older.
namenerds,3aafp9,symfonies,1 point,Thu Jun 18 16:47:09 2015 UTC,I'm being reminded now of Julia Goolia.
namenerds,3aafp9,symfonies,3,Thu Jun 18 17:50:16 2015 UTC,"It really doesn't matter. The instances in life where people speak out both your names are actually quite rare, and even then who cares?   The only thing that should be avoided are really obscene initials, like FUK or KUNT or something."
namenerds,3aafp9,jacobbaby,2,Fri Jun 19 01:38:49 2015 UTC,Good point on initials! I'll steer clear of those.
namenerds,3aafp9,jacobbaby,3,Fri Jun 19 10:28:34 2015 UTC,"To me, flow is important. I'm sure it isn't to others. I just think everyone should say their child's name out loud like they would if they were full-name scolding them, or announce it aloud as though it's graduation and they're walking across the stage.  Some lovely people I know named their son Carter (which I love), but their last name is a strange name that also starts with the sound ""Car."" So the child's name is Carter Car-, essentially. To me, it seems like they did not test it out in this way and I can't imagine why they wouldn't. But again, it's not my kid so my opinion doesn't really matter. :)"
namenerds,3aafp9,NameIdeas,2,Tue Jun 23 23:52:41 2015 UTC,"For me, it's important that the names don't actively clash,  rhyme, create a tongue-twister, run together so that when said together it's hard to understand them as two separate words, etc. Past that, eh. I don't really get the idea that if one name is of a different origin than the last name, that's somehow an issue, and flow seems so subjective."

I feel that both Primrose and Marigold could be very respectable , even ""proper"" names. It saddens me that people feel the need to name their kids things like George, or Sally just to please their family, or to stay within societies standards for a normal name.

The hippy/nature names: Primrose (too cutesy), Amaryllis (too complicated), Blossom (will sound ugly in Dutch), Sundance, Lark, Amethyst, Song (I dont know if it is feminine enough but yeah I love music). Edit 3: and basically all of u/people1925 list, save for Destiny.  Too medieval: Ermingard, Vodalwih, Ingeluuara, Bergundis, Dagarada, Othelhildis, Amalberga, Vastrada/Wastrade, Elisonis and more. Might saddle my kid with it as a middle name though.  Irish (Sibeal, Sinead, Sorcha, Rionach) and Icelandic names (Bryndis, Hafdis, Berglind and Holmfridur). I dont even have the letters on my keyboard to spell some Icelandic names like Holmfridur right so that probably says enough for how difficult it would be to go full Icelandic here.  Some names I love would be seen where I live as nearly ""lower social-economic class"" to put it lightly or just as plain weird. Amaya or Soyala for example...Love those names, especially Amaya.  Briseis.  Yaretzi: it is an Aztec name but it will be seen as weird alphabet soup over here. Maybe as a middle name. Yashodhara (Sanskrit) same story.  Which brings me to the following name: Aluna. I posted about this name in the boys thread aswell.  It's the name a native people (Kogi) in Colombia use for Mother Earth.  That is why I love it but I am afraid it is disrespectful (because I am not from there)? I should probably start my own thread about it, but what do you all think about it, disrespectful or honor-name?  Edit: Hmm maybe I can think of as many foridden girls names as I do boys names haha. Edit 2: Apparently nearly everyone here, myself included, loves the name Isolde so I think we should use it more :D"
namenerds,3a86jj,RageKage,2,Thu Jun 18 14:09:05 2015 UTC,Maybe Melody instead of Song for a music themed name.

namenerds,3a98ia,Allegretta,4,Sat Jun 20 19:48:50 2015 UTC,"I have a good friend from China who chose Charlotte as her English name. It's not at all weird to share the name with a princess since Charlotte is already a common and established name. I also think that Lola would be perfect as a nickname for Charlotte. Some other options for Lola that you might consider are : Laura/Laurel/Lorelei or Louise/Louisa.   Carmen - I have only ever heard this name on Hispanic girls, so it would seem a bit odd to me if I met a non-Hispanic Carmen.   Amelia - This is lovely, and does not need the nickname Amy. In fact, Amy is usually seen as more of a name on its own than a nickname for Amelia. People today often use Mia.   Elliot - I don't recommend this, since I'm not a fan of boy's names on girls.   Isabelle - This is overly common on young kids these days, but still a nice name. But it doesn't have the same grounded, professional sound that Charlotte has.   Alice - This is a lovely, classic choice that isn't overused."
namenerds,3a98ia,kei8ocd,3,Fri Jun 19 07:50:01 2015 UTC,"Depends where you live, if you're in the US you could go with Amelia and no one would ever think to call you Amy. In some countries nicknames are much more prominent and it's a sign of endearment to make up a new name for someone.  Honestly, I like all of your choices. I don't think Lola reads as unprofessional. Lolita maybe would be odd, but Lola seems fine. Likewise I have no issue with Carmen, it's a common and nice name despite Bizet."
namenerds,3a98ia,milliondollarsecret,4,Thu Jun 18 19:52:20 2015 UTC,"I'm in the U.S., I just assumed people would use Amy as nickname because of doctor who, but I guess not!"

namenerds,3a908e,_kashmir_,1 point,Thu Jun 18 06:59:55 2015 UTC,"Raphaëlle is really for me - expresses my involvement in the naming process by referencing a famous renaissance artist/favorite character - it's not just about euphony or there'd be a lot more on the table.  On some level I feel it's selfish to not just go with Cynthia, and yet this is likely to be our last child...   Then again, I got to give my son his first name and I had a lot of influence on the middle one.  You're probably right and I should suck it up and do the nice thing."
namenerds,3a908e,Allegretta,2,Thu Jun 18 11:13:04 2015 UTC,"Using the name Cynthia would be such a lovely gesture. I would go with Ada Cynthia or Ada Cynthia Raphaëlle. I know you fear it would be pretentious, but really, how often is she going to introduce herself as 'first name middle name last name'? Very rarely! Nobody apart from immediate family and a couple of her close friends will even know what her middle name is, and even then it's not going to be something you think about on a daily basis throughout her life. Middle names don't serve any actual purpose like a first or last name does, so I would honour your MIL and add in Raphaëlle."
namenerds,3a908e,people1925,1 point,Thu Jun 18 10:40:14 2015 UTC,"It's not just fear of pretense to be clear, but also when the Important Documents of life have to be dealt with - my poor kids already have a gigantic, 13-letter compound surname to manage, and i don't know if I should saddle her with another 7-9 letters for a middle name she doesn't need.  ...although it does sound pretty.    You know how middle names come out when you're mad at your kids?  My MIL used to just randomly add several additional middle names that weren't even part of her kids names when she got angry at them - kept things lightly humorous.  I could just name her Ada Cynthia and throw in Raphaëlle when she's in trouble - throw her a curve-ball."
namenerds,3a908e,kei8ocd,2,Thu Jun 18 11:20:52 2015 UTC,"I can understand wanting to use Cynthia, but I just think Ada Raphaelle is the better choice. It's just gorgeous and perfect.

For a long time we had weird, cute nicknames for her, mine was Moo. It stuck for a while until she was older and we just started calling her Harper.  Like Holden, it's an easy name to say and doesn't necessitate a nickname.  Nowadays we call her Harps and she does enjoy that nickname, but for the most part we say her full name. Holden is a beautiful name and was on my list at one point (I forget which kiddo). Don't worry about nicknames too much, they sort of develop on their own, if they do at all."

namenerds,3a8pxz,not_a_muggle,2,Thu Jun 18 03:27:48 2015 UTC,"Speaking from experience, my name's Holden, and I've never had a nickname. It doesn't lend itself well to a nickname, but I find it's awesome on its own.   In regards to a bunch of previous posts: I'm also named after Holden Caulfield, and I don't think the reference spoils it for me at all. Granted, I like the character and I am a bit biased (surprise, surprise), but it's a hell of a literary reference. Good choice!"
namenerds,3a8pxz,notnickjonass,2,Fri Jun 19 03:05:58 2015 UTC,Cool! That was so awesome to hear! Thanks you made my day!
namenerds,3a8pxz,notnickjonass,4,Fri Jun 19 03:06:38 2015 UTC,Are you sure you want to do Holden? Its most famous bearer was a teenager who had a nervous breakdown. I love The Catcher in the Rye but it's not a character you'd want to be associated with. I honestly have never heard of anyone outside of the book being named Holden.   Nicknames don't have to be obvious either. It could be something entirely unrelated to his name. My name is Madeline and my nickname has been Kat for my entire life.
namenerds,3a8pxz,Yarsl,2,Thu Jun 18 03:10:05 2015 UTC,"I actually named him after Holden caufeild. Not because I think the character is amazing, but because I love the work and wanted a literary reference as the name. (Our girl choice is waverly).  It's also a type of car in Australia ( we live in canada but my husband drives one). So yes, we are sure."
namenerds,3a8pxz,paincoats,-1,Thu Jun 18 03:26:27 2015 UTC,As long as you thought it through. A lot of people misinterpret CitR and don't realize Holden is not a good person.
namenerds,3a8pxz,MsZuko,5,Thu Jun 18 03:28:42 2015 UTC,"Ok I have to chime in here. Holden is a little teenage shit, but he's NOT a bad person. He's a kid that lost his brother and never grieved properly, or had a support system to realize he was acting out as a result of his grief.   Yes, the book resonates more with angsty teens than with adults. But that's because that's what he is...an angsty, angry kid. At the end of the story we're left with hope that he is getting help processing his emotional pain and will eventually mature.  IMO, saying he's not a good person is quite harsh, and suggests you may have never gone through a really tough time as a kid that made you act out. A lot of us did, and can relate :)  Op, we like that name as well. But can't think of a nickname, sorry!"
namenerds,3a8pxz,jacobbaby,2,Thu Jun 18 03:50:40 2015 UTC,"Oh he's had terrible luck no doubt. His parents are never really around, his brother is dead, his teacher is creepy as hell...but that's it what threw me off the name. As much as I like the name I wouldn't use Ophelia for the same reason. But as long as OP thought this through and didn't just ignore the book when choosing the name that's fine."
namenerds,3a8pxz,fortmonkey,1 point,Thu Jun 18 13:29:21 2015 UTC,Yes! I agree! It's not a tribute necessarily to the character but to the work itself. I loved Salinger but my husband thought it was too last namey for a name. Also I didn't want him to get called sal. It seems like a creepy truck driver name to me ha ha.

She also gave my brother the name of her friend, also not after him, but we are still family friends with him. I'm not sure how weird that was for my mom's friends, but it has certainly never been weird for us as the kids. To us, we just happen to have the same name as our mom's friend.

It's no where near on the same scale as Jennifer or Jessica were before, she's really not likely to be one of six in her class. George really didn't spike that much when they choose it (though girl names are probably different). It could go either way frankly, people choose it because the princess is named it, or they don't choose is because she is.   Besides Charlotte has a bunch of nickname possibilities!

She won't be taken seriously when she gets beyond the age of 5 and it's opening her up to mockery as a teenager. Can you imagine what interviewers will think when they read the name Sunshine on her CV? Would the CEO of a bank be called Sunshine? I know folks on this sub like unusual names, but outside of the internet she will be laughed at. There's plenty of nature inspired names to choose from as another user has posted, but I would steer well clear of Sunshine."
namenerds,3a78ec,_kashmir_,8,Wed Jun 17 21:49:14 2015 UTC,"If you like nature or 'hippie' type names, there's more understated ones that might work  Flora  Autumn   Clementine   Columba (Dove in Latin)  Faye (like a fairy)  Gaia (Mother Earth)  Dorothy nn Doe  Ginger  Iris   Ivy   Laurel   Magnolia   Opal   Luna   Terra (Earth)  Sylvia (Forest)  Aurora  Celeste   Lavender  Phoebe (This is another name for Artemis/Diana)  Zora"
namenerds,3a78ec,BitchesMakePuppies,13,Wed Jun 17 20:30:46 2015 UTC,"I think it's a name that's hard to take seriously. And it will be hard for your kid to live up to it. What if your kid is just not that cheery and vibrant and more reserved and calm. People will make comments about that to her.  What you name your kid DOES have an effect on their life, your kid will eventually be an adult who needs to get a job. I have served on search committees and if we run across an unusual name, I make conscious or unconscious judgements about that person. RIGHT OR WRONG, that is what happens.  I think it's also a name that is cute for a child, but I can't envision on a 35 year old... Doctor or Mother or Janitor or Cashier.  I think it is sweet for a middle name, but as a first name it is risky."
namenerds,3a78ec,LittleTeenyTiny,6,Wed Jun 17 21:34:12 2015 UTC,"I went to high school with a girl named Sunshine (Sunny). I always liked it, different but not weird."
namenerds,3a78ec,BabyNewf,6,Wed Jun 17 19:54:39 2015 UTC,"I agree that Sunny is a cute nickname or a good middle name, but probably not the best first name for when your daughter grows up."
namenerds,3a78ec,sunshinejohnson,5,Wed Jun 17 21:46:10 2015 UTC,Finally my time to shine. I love it!
namenerds,3a78ec,flapjacksal,4,Wed Jun 17 21:56:43 2015 UTC,"I'm a lawyer, and I can tell you that my firm would probably toss out the resume of anyone named Sunshine, unless she had won 400 different awards, founded a non-profit, and gone to the Olympics.   It's hard enough being a female in a male dominated profession - don't make it harder.   Harsh, but true :/"
namenerds,3a78ec,fuzzybloomers,8,Thu Jun 18 15:44:51 2015 UTC,"I like it! It definitely has a 'hippie' connotation, but I don't mind that  :) I think a more traditional middle name would be a good pair in case she grows up not liking the name. I like it with a one syllable middle name for some reason: Sunshine Grace, Sunshine Claire, Sunshine Lee. I also like Sunshine Isabelle.  One thing people point out a lot in this sub is asking yourself if you can see someone with that name being a senator or a lawyer, something very serious. I find it hard to imagine a Sunshine being either of those things. That's not something I mind though since I don't think people's names have THAT big of an influence (implying they wouldn't be successful with those names), but it's something to think about!"
namenerds,3a78ec,milliondollarsecret,2,Wed Jun 17 19:59:05 2015 UTC,"Yay! Yeah, most of the names I like have a hippie/nature feel to them. I also like Juniper, River, Hazel, and Lark but my husband hates them. :)  Sunshine Claire is pretty! Thank you.  That's a good point but I think I agree with you. I'm not sure how much an influence names really have on something like that. But it's something I'll keep in mind."
namenerds,3a78ec,Chabopple,8,Wed Jun 17 20:17:48 2015 UTC,"I really like the nickname Sunny. If you named her something like Sonia or Summer, you could still call her Sunny for short. It's just people tend to imagine their future children as babies, understandably, but don't picture them as adults enough. Sunshine is a great name for a little girl, but may be difficult for a grown woman who wants to be taken seriously in her field."
namenerds,3a78ec,heliotrope5,7,Wed Jun 17 20:20:32 2015 UTC,"I think a good compromise here can be the middle name being Sunshine. It's rarely used, but still OK if you're a CEO. And she can still use the nickname Sunny. I kind of like the ring of Amelia Sunshine."
namenerds,3a78ec,saratina,1 point,Wed Jun 17 21:02:22 2015 UTC,"I just can't see the name Sunshine on a professional adult. Maybe have it as a middle name, but use it within the family if you really love it? I think it would just be good to give her options.   All of your other nature names are so pretty, and a little more understated than Sunshine - they transfer to adulthood better.   If you like nature/hippy names then how about:   Fleur  Flora  Briar  Summer  Clover  Poppy  Willow  Dahlia  Daisy  Heather  Wren  Iris  Ivy   Jasmine  Lily  Magnolia (Maggie, Nolie…)  Isla  Laurel  Zinnia"
namenerds,3a78ec,LadyIsabeauHawke,3,Thu Jun 18 09:11:25 2015 UTC,The Norwegian name Sunniva (pronounced SUN-uv-ah in English) can take the nickname Sunny. I think that's a very pretty alternative to Sunshine without the hippie unserious connotations.
namenerds,3a78ec,LadyIsabeauHawke,3,Wed Jun 17 22:38:38 2015 UTC,"In theory I agree with the other posters that it would be silly on an adult, but I'm biased because I actually worked with a woman named Sunshine, and that lady got stuff done. She was fantastic at her job and everyone took her seriously.  So listen to everyone's caution, but if you do go ahead with it, her character is what people will ultimately remember about her, not her name."
namenerds,3a78ec,LadyIsabeauHawke,2,Wed Jun 17 23:00:31 2015 UTC,"What about Sunday? That's a bit more acceptable with a hippie name. In saying that, I do know a girl called Rainbow who wears it quite well."
namenerds,3a78ec,people1925,3,Wed Jun 17 23:53:46 2015 UTC,"I always think of Nicole Kidman calling her baby Sunday Rose, and everyone in Australia, (where I am from) was calling her Sunday Roast."

namenerds,3a78ec,JustGonnaDoIt,2,Thu Jun 18 00:04:23 2015 UTC,"If you had to use a name in the sun vein could you at least make Sunny the first name? People will still think it's odd, but people won't laugh at her like the would if sunshine was her actual first name.   Would you consider a variation like.....  Asia-""Lively; The rising sun""  Lian ""Daughter of the sun""  Eliane ""Daughter of the sun""  Eleadora ""Gift of the sun""  Eleana ""Daughter of the sun""  Electra ""Sparkling. The fiery sun. Mythological daughter of Agamemnon.""  Helia ""Of the sun""  Idalia ""Behold the sun""  Cira ""Sun""  Intina ""Sun eye (Incan)""   Sola ""The sun""   Kira ""Sun""  Mehry ""Sun; also affectionate, kind""  Talayeh ""Golden rays of sun""  Sonste ""Sun""   Kalynda ""The sun""  Raveena/Ravina ""The sun""  Suria ""The sun""   Suvana ""The sun; fire""   Udaya ""Rising of the sun and moon""   Sunniva ""A gift of the sun (soo-NEE-vah)""  Solana ""Sunshine""  Nima/Nyima ""The sun""  Joie- Joy, happiness, sunshine  Solèy- (Creole ) Sun, Sunny  However! If you are completely stuck on the name Sunshine, and are 100% sure you can't live without it. Soe of the name combinations could be.  Sunshine Summer  Sunshine Autumn  Sunshine Spring  Sunshine August  Sunshine Crystal  Sunshine Dawn  Sunshine Ember  Sunshine Grace  Sunshine Jade  Sunshine Joy  Sunshine Lily  Sunshine Marely  Sunshine May  Sunshine Melody  Sunshine Rain  Sunshine River  Sunshine Shalom  Sunshine Willow  I feel all these could be good middle names to choose from if you child ever wishes to go by their middle name. They also sound good with Sunshine."
namenerds,3a78ec,Kadamba,1 point,Thu Jun 18 00:08:00 2015 UTC,"Honestly I think it's more of a dogs name, but that's probably cause I've known like four dogs named Sunshine.   Or a hippie name."
namenerds,3a4qrj,wearentcreative,10,Wed Jun 17 05:31:01 2015 UTC,"I gotta say - for a self-professed non creative person you definitely like creative names!   I personally don't like names similar to your choices, so I won't comment on them except to say Atticus Fitch would probably sound too much like To Kill a Mockingbird :) I am always impressed with the creative folks on this sub though so I'm sure you will get some good opinions chiming in!"
namenerds,3a4qrj,BabyNewf,3,Wed Jun 17 05:55:35 2015 UTC,"My second cousin (cousin's son, whatever that makes him) is named Atticus and they're as far from hipstery as possible, so I think it's even infiltrated other groups in society too."
namenerds,3a4qrj,BabyNewf,5,Wed Jun 17 07:47:01 2015 UTC,"I'm trying to figure out your pronunciation of Kyri.  You say Ki-Ree, but do you mean kye-ree or key-ree?  I like Ellorie, I guess?  I feel like Kayleigh is just a terrible name - it will be misspelled constantly (not unlike most of your girl names). I can't say I'm much of a fan of your girl names at all.  I like Aurora, but as people have problems pronouncing it, I would use it as a middle name but not a first.  I like Calvin or Atlas for boys - easily spelled and pronounced, like big bro's name.  /u/BabyNewf is right - Atticus Fitch is a little too close to TKAM.  While I LOVE the book, it's just sort of weird to copy it that closely."

namenerds,3a4qrj,The_Zatanna,3,Wed Jun 17 06:43:15 2015 UTC,"I'm a fan of Aurora, and Kayleigh. I also am in love with some Greek names like Athena and Artemis for girl names.  As for boys, I LOVE Atlas, I suggested that and was quickly shot down by my husband. I also tried for Adonis, Dante, Remy (because of Gambit from X-Men), and Darian."
namenerds,3a4qrj,dalikin,1 point,Wed Jun 17 06:47:52 2015 UTC,Our dogs are Artemis and Apollo so hubby will probably bock at related names :) We both like Atlas though.
namenerds,3a4qrj,injest_,3,Wed Jun 17 15:25:33 2015 UTC,I like Kayleigh Fitch the best for a girl. And Calvin for a boy.
namenerds,3a4qrj,Ky_kapow,3,Thu Jun 18 04:45:12 2015 UTC,"From your boy names, Calvin and Phineas are my favorites. Atlas and Atticus both sound pretty hipstery to me, Elric makes me think of an anime character, and I believe that Kelan should be spelled ""Kellan"" if you want the ""keh-lan"" pronunciation instead of ""key-lan."" Aside from Aurora, which I quite like, none of your girl name choices particularly appeal to me.   Girl name suggestions:   Aria Felicity Ivy Lorelai Juniper Phoebe Ruby   Boy name suggestions:   Conan Dashiell Declan Edgar Laurence/Lawrence Lionel Roger Sinclair Vaughn"

namenerds,3a4qrj,fuzzybloomers,1 point,Wed Jun 17 13:41:10 2015 UTC,"You mention that you are not creative at all, but I think the names that you have suggested are all extremely creative. I love most of them, because they are unique but not weird or incomprehensible. So, I think you're going to want something that isn't super trendy, but is straight forward and rolls off the tongue - similar to the way that Aidan works.   For boys, out of your list, I agree with everyone else in that Atlas is a clear front runner! Calvin is also nice. I'm not a fan of Phineas because I can't help but think of Phineas and Ferb - yikes.   For girls, I really love the pronunciation of Kyri - like Sky-ree (which is what it sounds like you intend), but Kyri is so close to Kyrie so my first association was Kyrie Eleison. So if you're not comfortable with strong Christian ties that's something to keep in mind. Kairi is a great alternative :)   Good luck!"
namenerds,3a4qrj,jgonz85,1 point,Wed Jun 17 14:33:39 2015 UTC,"Maybe you'd be better off spelling Kayleigh the traditional way- Caleigh, just to make life easier. I've never heard the name Ellorie, but it sounds close to Elodie, which you might like."
namenerds,3a4qrj,fuzzybloomers,1 point,Wed Jun 17 16:52:33 2015 UTC,"I've never seen Caleigh before and I would assume it's pronounced Callie. I've seen Cayleigh and Kaylee though. I think she's going to have issues with the spelling no matter how she spells it, haha"
namenerds,3a4qrj,Caycepanda,1 point,Wed Jun 17 18:01:11 2015 UTC,Really? As far as I know it's the original spelling.
namenerds,3a4qrj,kei8ocd,1 point,Wed Jun 17 20:04:15 2015 UTC,"Maybe it's just a US thing? Caleigh has only been in the top 1000 a couple of times and almost always around the 900 mark. Kayleigh has been hovering around 300 since 1986. Kaylee has been under 200 since 1991, and is currently 52, so super popular! Caylee and Kayley are also surprisingly quite popular. Admittedly Cayleigh has never been on the list, so the Cayleigh I knew was an oddity, haha  I never seem to get Irish names (in their original spellings) right on the first try though :("

namenerds,3a4qrj,Kadamba,1 point,Wed Jun 17 20:30:52 2015 UTC,"I think Judith is such a great name, I hope you choose it for a middle name! I like how Kayleigh sounds best, but I think you are going to have a hard time with spelling like someone else said. Someone else posted about the name Kairi just recently, so you might check that out for some advice about that in particular. I also really like Ellorie Judith!  My favorite from your boys is Atlas and Calvin. I find Elric Fitch somewhat choppy. I'm also not a fan of the double F sound in Phineas Fitch (though I love Phineas!) I really dislike the name Atticus because of how trendy and impersonal it's become."
