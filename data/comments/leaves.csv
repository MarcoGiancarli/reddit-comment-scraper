leaves,3e336r,ShitTalkerDickWalker,3,Wed Jul 22 00:02:12 2015 UTC,"You were bored before. That is the main problem with habitual weed smoking. It can make you ok with being perpetually bored. You just don't care. Now that u have a clear head the fact that you're bored is bothering you. But you've been bored the whole time. Now is the time to learn how to live a life that feels worthwhile and fulfilling by finding things to do to make you not bored rather than making yourself ok with it by getting high. You may have a particularly hard time with this where u live, but you see this conundrum has already lead u to the logical step of saving enough to move to the city. In the meantime gain as much knowledge as u can about everything that interests you. And exercise. If u don't like where u live make it your goal to be fit, knowledgeable, and financially well off by the time u can move and you'll have a much easier time of it. Weed covers up the boredom problem but never solves it. You might never escape, or maybe you will when you're 30.  Fuck all that focus on solving it now."

Just try to find more hobbies and work out. I think maybe you can learn to program/code, some of the Object Oriented programming languages like C# or Java are not hard to learn and its fun once you get pretty good. Then you can get a job that pays very well and be able to go ANYWHERE in the world , because programmers are being hired everywhere right now. Good luck brother."

Think of your best dreams and pursue them at any level possible. Give it all several months to take shape. It will. The way you feel today is not the way you feel tomorrow. Be encouraged.

Eventually you'll start coughing up heavy brown / black, fleck filled phlegm, which is both disgusting and glorious ... breathing will become noticeably easier  There's some evidence that eating raw garlic can expede the process. Deep breathing and exercise"

leaves,3e1g29,IRateBoobies,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:49:51 2015 UTC,You have to make it a point to quit when you're out of smoke.  Then give your pipe or bong to a friend.  Otherwise you will scrape the resin and smoke that.    You can do it but no one said it'd be easy.

I don't know if I want to quit completely but I know that I want to be in control of cannabis instead of my life revolving around it. I have recently lost my partner of 6-7 years and I can't blame her to be honest. My BP is relatively untreated (dx'd in December of last year) and I use cannabis to self medicate but I'm not sure if that's just me justifying my use. I'm not sure what the point of my post is but I just felt comfortable here around other BP's having problems with cannabis, and it kinda feels good getting this out."

Quitting was truly worth it, and incredibly difficult. Tips: exercise (often hard to do when on medication, but a real benefit- just take one step at a time). Green tea- although you should avoid as much caffeine as possible, it really helped avoid relapsing. I bought decaffeinated. It's good to keep your hands busy."

It was easier than I thought once I had no more weed in my house and it would take a day or two to get. Even if I had an urge I was able to not go through with calling my dealer, and after about a couple weeks I stopped thinking about it much. The reason I really decided to stop was my pdoc kept stressing how she believed my previous episodes were aggravated by my smoking, and how sometimes bad things can happen when you're on it. Haven't looked back much since. Best of luck."

leaves,3e1822,from_the_black_hole,3,Tue Jul 21 07:07:31 2015 UTC,"I have bipolar 2 disorder.  I take Lamictal.  Don't take an SSRI if you have bipolar disorder.  Having bipolar disorder makes you prone to addiction.  You have to really understand your illness and don't fall into the cliche.  You need to find the gifts inside your illness.  I don't like when people romanticize bipolar disorder and mental illness, but us bipolars are usually geniuses in one way or another.  You have to find a reason to quit.  I always get horrible cravings and it seems literally impossible to quit until 48 hours after my last smoke.  I personally think smoking affects my medication's effectiveness and after abstaining for a few days, I feel like my mood levels out and I find less reasons to want to smoke.  Bipolar is hard.  People don't understand it.  You'll lose most of your friends, you'll spend a lot of time alone.  You have to learn to love yourself and get proper treatment with medication that won't make you groggy or feel out of it.  You'll need to have a consistent sleep schedule and diet.  You'll need to exercise and stay productive.  Avoid caffeine as well.  Try to avoid any psychoactive drugs.  You want your brain chemistry to remain consistent so you can learn to identify your mood cycles.  I've been through it all and kicking pot is a real challenge for me because I use it to self medicate.  It makes me unproductive and I've lost a few years of my life just smoking to mask my illness.  I'm the same age as you; my parents don't believe I have bipolar disorder and thought I was making it up.  My parents are both hoarders and were severely emotional abusive and negligent.  I dealt with self harm and considered suicide many times over the past 5 years.  Once I turned 18 I was able to go to a psychiatrist on my own and get diagnosed and treated.  My parents never ask or care about my mental illness or the medication I was prescribed.  I remember being 18 year old and telling them I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and they gave me an awkward stare, grabbed a beer from the fridge, rolled their eyes and walked off.  Not to go on about a sob sorry of my life, but in case someone else reads this because of the title, Before I knew I was bipolar I was self harming every day and considering suicide every day from age 16-18.  Child protective services came to my house because my school guidance counselor suspected something was up and I broke down and told them everything going on in my life and at home.  She tipped off CPS and they contacted my parents.  My mom unleashed an angry tirade on me and forced me to clean the entire house before their scheduled visit.  At the time I had no friends except for a girl who talked to me on the phone and texted me for hours every day pretending to like me.  I fell in love because she was the only person I had.  Typical teenage girl bullshit went down and it turned out she was just using me for attention; she loved talking to me and hearing me tell her how much I loved her and she would pretend to be interested in me but she wasn't.  The bad living situation and emotional trauma on top of being untreated for a severe mental illness caused my grades to suffer and it took me an extra two years to graduate, I had to set myself up with an alternative education to graduate once I was 18.  Since I wasn't able to go to college I had to work minimum wage jobs with demanding hours and high stress which set my bipolar off.  For the past few years all I have been doing is smoking pot to deal with all of this past trauma.  It seems impossible to get out of it."

I smoked for a long time and have similar issues to you regarding depression. It's taken me a long time to realise the weed wasn't medicating me but making me worse. I'm on my 6th day without it and I have been feeling low, which is only natural as the high is now gone. I would definitely recommend meditation if you haven't tried it already. It's a good way to relax and focus the mind and something I have found useful in the past."

No one can do that for you. It's like everything is a chore, but once you get to do it, you feel better.  Try to find tricks to make thing easier. Things that are special to you.  For me, reading some posts here made me feel 'something'.  Remember that ""High you, is not the real you"".

I was also a closet smoker and coming out was very difficult. There are physical withdrawal symptoms that should lessen after 5-7 weeks. You and I were smoking to be normal and it takes your body a while to recover. It's been helpful for me to exercise, eat healthy food, and stay busy - join a support group (look for MA or AA groups in your area), write in a journal, take up a hobby, whatever. At first I thought about using all the time but it's getting easier and the fog is clearing. I also think it's important to focus on today and not look too far ahead. Quitting is worth it!
