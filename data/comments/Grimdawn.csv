Grimdawn,3e65cd,Koala_eiO,1 point,Wed Jul 22 12:29:33 2015 UTC,"It's mainly so your brother doesn't farm infamy in a faction where you farm for reputation.   Regarding the plan on changing it, I have no idea."
Grimdawn,3e65cd,Enaxion,1 point,Wed Jul 22 13:48:26 2015 UTC,"As far as I know, you don't need to do any bounties if you don't want to. It will not affect anything significant unless you want those ""soulbound"" items that the quartermasters sell.  If you could play like that with your brother then people would abuse this with 2 pc's and level 2 character reputations simultaneously"
Grimdawn,3e65cd,Enaxion,2,Wed Jul 22 07:02:57 2015 UTC,"than, why they made the normal quests shared? As people will abuse this to level 2 characters the same time, doubling the rewards of it (if any) and literally do the same.  I just do not see the difference yet..."
Grimdawn,3e65cd,Bow_for_the_king,2,Wed Jul 22 07:45:18 2015 UTC,"So you can progress through the actual story. The reputation is completely OPTIONAL, I can't stress this enough. You don't actually gain anything mindblowing with story/progression quests."
Grimdawn,3e4nce,Melicalol,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:42:05 2015 UTC,"Part of farming is for faction exp.  Devil's Crossing - take bounties for Cronley's Rover's - Bounties for SoT, Undercity Homestead - Bounties for Queen's Hive Kymon's Chosen - Bounties for Chothons and Vigil (Fort Haron) Order of Death's Vigil - Bounties for Aetherials and Kymon's (Fort Haron)    Those are off the top of my head, so if I mixed up Kymons and vigil then switch Chthon with Aetherials.   Great thing about farming now is most zones scale to your level. So if you love fighting Cronley's then you can do that to lvl 50 and beyond for more drops. If you love SoT keep going there. You can fight wasps to lvl 50 if you want. Just like before each area has it's own higher chance of drops, so find all the areas that scale to lvl 50 and farm each of them till you've gotten a ton of goodies.   Prepare for Shaman, start thinking of builds and saving up gear. Maybe level a new character to lvl 10 or 20, but don't put any points in anything. Wait till Shaman comes out and try stuff out.   TL;DR Almost everywhere, most places scale to max level including related drops."
Grimdawn,3e4nce,kuvter,3,Wed Jul 22 03:51:49 2015 UTC,"Maybe level a new character to lvl 10 or 20, but don't put any points in anything.   That seems like a huge waste of time. A character that doesn't use any skill take way more time to level up."
Grimdawn,3e4nce,Koala_eiO,1 point,Wed Jul 22 10:10:57 2015 UTC,"True, unless you have someone power level you and you get there in half an hour.  Another option is get your first class to lvl 10 and then you'll be ready to add Shaman."

Grimdawn,3e3e39,arpg_newb,7,Tue Jul 21 17:27:18 2015 UTC,"In my opinion GD is well worth the money, it gets to you very easily and it been a breath of fresh air from the mainstream PoE and Diablo 3. When it is going to be fully released I expect GD will be better than PoE (it already is better than Diablo 3) but right now, the diversity PoE offers you cannot be matched. However, having played all 3 games I can tell you that if you are bored and sick of PoE, GD will completely revive the Arpg feeling."
Grimdawn,3e3e39,Tridord,4,Tue Jul 21 20:36:45 2015 UTC,"Let me be clear that since Grim Dawn is still in Alpha there is no end game yet. It currently ends at act 3, but an act 4 is being worked on. Additionally we only have Normal and Veteran difficulties, but later on it's going to go Normal -> Elite -> Ultimate. I assume you'll beat the game on normal, then proceed with that character to Elite, beat again, then Ultimate - more like Diablo 2. Current max level is 50 and the game is planned to go up to lvl 70 or more.   End game hints at being a gear grind/craft, maxing out factions for bonuses, discounts, and quests/bounties, as well as maxing out hatreds for each enemy type, spawning a Nemesis - basically an ultimate boss.   Some of the end game type stuff, like Factions and Nemesis are already in the game. When the max level was 35 they had end game type stuff like a Rogue-like dungeon (no teleportation - so you beat it or die trying - needs a crafted key to enter) and also lvl 35 relics you can craft. Now that we're lvl 50 max the 35 relics are still something worth crafting, and the rogue-like dungeon scales to your level. The Rogue-like dungeon is lvl 4-5 of Steps of Torment, but they plan to have 7 levels. That will be an end game farming spot and proving grounds.   Patches in GD haven't altered the game enough to break any builds. Though they have been done to help balance the game as new items and classes are added. Still I haven't had any complaints. However, it should be noted that the core game isn't that hard, considering there is only Normal and Veteran (basically normal with buffed in increased number of enemies).   I played POE, but fairly early on and didn't like the feel of the game. Combat felt rough - not fluid. They may have fixed that.   D3 seems like an endless grind and for more of a casual player like me, who will every so often binge play games, Grim Dawn is my favorite of the three. It has a clear end, so far at least. And this end makes it fun to try out other characters and build ideas.   Additionally an expansion is planned for Grim Dawn, the devs have made it clear what will be in the core game, and it will definitely be feature rich and complete.   I kickstarted GD, have played 300+ hours, and I love the game. It's definitely worth full price, but feel free to buy it on a steam sale, that's how I get most my games.   A few GD favorite -     Monster Infrequents - Monsters drop the gear you see on them, want a gun, kill guys with guns, want a magic wand, kill mages     Ranged Attack Cancellation - you can cancel out an enemy ranged attack (spell or arrow) with a ranged attack.    World Altering Choices - you get to pick a magic focused blacksmith or a physical focused one - you get to chose a faction, between two options - you get to save people and add them to your town, bribe them or kill them.   Dual Classes - At lvl 10 you get to pick a second class. It's fun to theorycraft, soon a 6th class will be added to the core game, Shaman, which really means 6 more choices (solo, or dual with 5 other classes). Ton of potential for synergies here.  TL;DR GD has no end game currently, but there are end game type things to do in the current build and at max level. I love this game!"
Grimdawn,3e3e39,kuvter,3,Tue Jul 21 22:25:02 2015 UTC,"Its a good game if you like arpg's. I play it alot, but PoE is my mian game since I have been a hardcore arpg player for a long time.   The character building isn't really all that great in my personal opinion.  Alot of skills feel useless and there aren't a ton of synergizing skills.  When there is synergy often times its RNG based.   Its still a great game and I have multiple characters at cap. The gameplay, graphics, and camera rotation is very good.  If you have played Titan Quest I would say its almost a direct comparison."
Grimdawn,3e3e39,SweetyMcQ,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:33:23 2015 UTC,Grim Dawn is basically Titan Quest with all of its major flaws fixed with more focus done on balance. I don't think you would find it as deep as POE is but it is the funnest ARPG I have played in a long time. The game is lenient enough where you can really mess around with the two class system to make some pretty unorthodox builds. Itemization is also pretty fun with one shot chests that guarantee a unique drop from them so you will at least get a few interesting things during a playthrough.  The endgame really doesn't exist yet due to the game not being complete and the higher difficulties which function like Diablo 2 being locked. There will be roguelike dungeons in the game where if you die you cannot teleport back in. Certain areas also scale with you to a point so you can replay them and get loot that way too.
Grimdawn,3e3e39,NotTom,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:57:17 2015 UTC,"As a person who regularly plays all 3 of those,  GD is my favorite of the 3."
Grimdawn,3e3e39,Magester,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:08:25 2015 UTC,"As an active poe player I have to say that GD is a nice escape from the gear grinding, although you simply swap which game you grind in. The end game currently leaves a lot to be desired and depending on what your experience with poe is, you may find most of the content in the game to be quite easy/boring. In saying that, it is quite enjoyable and the pace of the game is great from the get go. One of my other problems is the skill trees for each class. The trees have many options but ultimately, most of them are either useless or incredibly niche. Each class is completely different to the other though which is nice.  Despite the way I wrote it up, the game is great and is easily better than diablo 3. The devs also write up great patch notes and development diaries, both of which are enjoyable to read. It is my go to rogue/arpg game when I can't be bothered playing poe or between leagues because they seem to release content during poe downtimes"
Grimdawn,3e3e39,snewcones,1 point,Wed Jul 22 04:52:32 2015 UTC,The combat feels more similar to Path of Exile than to Diablo 3. But the best comparison would obviously be Titan quest. It feels like a more polished version of that.

Grimdawn,3dyh79,Jeenz5,2,Tue Jul 21 06:44:27 2015 UTC,"Grim Misadventures returns with part 2 of our Shaman reveal (Part 1 can be read here). Work on the Shaman and B27 is progressing smoothly, and we are entering the final stages where we can put the build into closed testing to find any mischievous bugs. Once we are satisfied that the build meets our standards, it will be ready for its public debut. We are confident that B27 will go live before the end of August.  In our last update, we showed you some entry-level Shamanism, so now let’s take a look what a master of the wild can hurl at her enemies.  Shaman Mastery  Wendigo Totem “Wendigo Totems represent a darker side to Shaman rituals, embracing the vicious duality of nature: one must die so that another may feed and live. Once placed, the totem will drain the life from nearby foes, all while creating a soothing aura that heals allies. To that end, Wendigo Totems were often used as wards to deter foes from approaching desirable hunting grounds.”  The Wendigo Totem serves a dual purpose. It can hurt your enemies in a large area, but it also serves as a powerful healing tool. Stand within its area of influence as it torments your foes and it will transfer precious stolen vitality to you. Bold Shamans will place this totem in the middle of a pack of foes, and bravely wade into battle knowing that the totem’s magic will protect them. The modifier for this skill enhances the totem with surges of lightning.   Storm Pact “Unleash the ultimate wrath of nature as the air around you ripples with static energy and nearby foes are randomly struck down by the heavens themselves.”  Storm Pact represents the pinnacle of Shamanistic control over the skies. Activate this power and watch as nearby enemies are assaulted by bolts of destructive lightning. Charge confidently into battle, as the skies are your ally.  Conjure Primal Spirit “Legends speak of a great predator, the loyal pet of Mogdrogen, which relentlessly hunts down anyone that treads into the beast god's domain uninvited. As a favored follower of Mogdrogen, you call upon this Primal Spirit to aid you in battle.”  The Primal Spirit is a vicious manifestation of the wild’s vengeance. Appearing before you as a manticore, the spirit will join you in the toughest battles, easily shredding any foe with its claws and fangs. Use this power carefully, as the Primal Spirit can only manifest itself for limited periods of time.  Primal Bond “Strengthen your bond to the beasts that dwell within the wilds.”  As a Shaman, you can form a powerful bond with the denizens of Mogdrogen’s realm. Respect the beasts of the wild, and they shall repay you with savage loyalty, effectively making all of your summoned creatures more powerful in combat.  Many secrets still remain within the Shaman Mastery, but you will have to uncover them for yourself when B27 goes live.  Like knowing what is coming up next for Grim Dawn? Check back on 08/03/2015 for our regular development updates!"
Grimdawn,3dxn0m,sols4gan,0,Mon Jul 20 11:24:21 2015 UTC,"I found This and it's helped a lot for farming most mats. I've found areas around buildings and humanoid camps best for scraps, for me at least."
Grimdawn,3dwc2n,Decayedglory,3,Mon Jul 20 02:02:01 2015 UTC,"When I made a nightblade, I realized I enjoy throwing knives at my enemies but mana became an issue so I added a lot of points toward spirit. This also meant instead of piercing damage, maybe I should go with cold or chaos or something and arcanist would probably help with that. Now at lvl 50, my knives each hit for over a thousand (up to 5 knives can hit a target at once) and I think things worked out okay :)"
Grimdawn,3dwc2n,qian87,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:30:14 2015 UTC,"I'm very partial to dual-wielding, so I'll link to a level 14 Spellbreaker build.  http://grimcalc.com/build/uhqr87  Shadow Strike is your low-cooldown gap closer with nice damage and a stun attached.  Pneumatic Burst is an execellent source of healing, damage, and movement on a relatively low cooldown.  The primary focus of this build is to hold left click and hope for Shears to go off. With Heroes, I would use Shadow Strike on cooldown to maximize damage output.  I'm a newb still, so take my advice with a grain of salt."
Grimdawn,3dwc2n,InverseEntropy,1 point,Mon Jul 20 08:28:35 2015 UTC,"I've found that playing around and trying builds is fun in Grim Dawn. You can respec the number of points you put into skills, but not the points put into your class (the bottom bar) or your stats (physique, cunning, spirit).   If you want to min/max you better know everything about your build from day 1. I've found the best way to do that is to play through all the game's content, learn what skills you like/dislike, what's fun, what isn't, what gear you want to have the best build, and what stats and skills you'll need to wear them and be the most effective. And then make the character all over again. In short don't expect to min/max on the first run.   With that said the game's content is fairly forgiving, so have fun with it. There isn't really a bad decision, only one that'll make you a little less effective. A few pieces of gear, a little more farming of experience, or a point respec can change that.   Grim Calc is a great way to theorycraft a build before dedicating the points. I use it with every build I make now.   For Nightblade having Pneumatic Burst or Blade Barrier can save you because of the healing bonus, for Arcanist having Mirror of Ereoctes or Maiven's Sphere of Protection can save you in a pinch. Having at least one of those skills is recommended, but still not required.   One method that works really well is maxing out a skill early on. It'll make putting on some gear a problem, as you won't get the stat points from class progression, but it'll boost your DPS significantly, and won't trap you into any build early on, because you mostly put points into a respecable skill."
Grimdawn,3dwc2n,kuvter,1 point,Mon Jul 20 08:33:29 2015 UTC,There are several ways of playing this class.  My spellbreaker is a focused on cold damage and dual wielding procs. It's very enjoyable playing with it

Grimdawn,3dqd9q,Tridord,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:52:56 2015 UTC,"I use Tridord's method here.   Additionally I only keep the best version of each component bonus.

I keep the best of each bonus type too, so that +9% cold, best +fire, best +Physique, etc.   I keep all the lvl 1's in a tab, 7's and 11's in a tab, 15's in tab, 20's in a tab, etc. I have Incomplete Components, Components lvl 1-20 and Components 20+ making 12 tabs and 3 files.

Grimdawn,3dqd9q,Tridord,3,Sun Jul 19 15:30:13 2015 UTC,"The general rule of thumb for me has been to keep components that are rare and/or have a great completion bonus, and to keep components that you know will find some use later on.  For exemple, I try and keep a steady influx of chipped claws, polished emeralds, fire embers, chilled steel, cracked lodestone, corpse dust and ectoplasm for crafting.  Collecting and keeping roiling bloods and silk watch for useful/perfect completion bonus. Same with vicious spikes, wardstones and any components that grants an aura for weapon that can complement builds (fire aura[pet occultist, melee battlemage], cold aura[melee battlemage, cold oriented blademaster], pierce aura [phys/pierce blademaster] etc  Collecting and keeping most rare components like ancient armor plates with different completion bonus, arcane lens, dread skulls, chains of oleron, hallowed ground, mark of modrogen among others"
Grimdawn,3dqd9q,atan23,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:34:25 2015 UTC,At the very least instead of tossing them just make a new character called components and use their stash and inventory to hold one you have a bunch of. That way if you ever end up needing them or want to use a few to boost a low level character you have that option.

Grimdawn,3d5w5j,Lan_lan,7,Tue Jul 14 01:19:07 2015 UTC,"This game as been great. I just hit 300 hours last week and I'm still playing.   They update the game with new content every 2-3 months. Patches/Hotfixes come soon after the patch. They're very active.   I read every Grim Misadventure (details about updates and new content coming). They so interesting.   They're adding a new class, Shaman, in the next build and I'm already farming gear and theory crafting to get ready for this totem using, earthen pet summoning, two handed weapon wielding class. Since this game has dual class options, once you hit lvl 10, adding a new class when there are already 5 others means you're adding 6 new classes to the game. Solo Shaman, and Shaman + 5 other classes. I'm excited!  They have made it clear what they plan to add to the core game, such as Shaman, and the 4th act. There were hints about Devotion, but I didn't play enough attention to know if it'll get into the core game. There will also be 3 difficulty levels of the game, Normal, Elite, and Ultimate, which will likely have you play the content of the game again, with added levels, and harder mobs.   One thing I really like about the game is that ranged attacks cancel out other ranged attacks. So with a crossbow or gun you can shoot enemy fireballs and aether spores out of the air. Same goes the other way, your fireball and Eye of Dregg can cancel out arrows. Love that mechanic.  Additionally they have Monster Infrequent gear (MIs) that goes off a a What You See Is What You Get (WYSIWYG) system. So if you see a mob with a Ice Crossbow, it has the potential to drop that magical Ice Crossbow. Makes it easier to know where to farm. Want gun, attack people with guns, want aether armour fight aetherials, want fire gear - farm a fire boss.   There so much more I could share, but one thing is that the game has you make choices that affect the world. You can save people and bring them back to town, like saving a merchant means you have an extra merchant in town. Or you can let them die. It's not always clear in the first playthrough who is telling the truth and who is lying, so you may kill an innocent person by accident. I like it. Tons of replayability simply based on those choices. They also make you chose a faction to side with later, between two choices and you're pitted against the one you rejected. I hope this plays out even more in Act 4.  After the core game is done, which is already fairly feature rich, they have plans for an expansion. They've made it clear what will be in the core game, despite the planned expansion. The game is active and doing well!   TL;DR Love the game, keeps getting updated every 2-3 months with new content, player base gets updated with Grim Misadventures every 2 weeks telling us what's to come."
Grimdawn,3d5w5j,kuvter,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:17:14 2015 UTC,"I've decided to pick up the game after all the good news, but I do have a question I couldn't find the answer to.  Can you still animation cancel?  I watched a few videos and saw some of the advantages you can get with it, but I couldn't find out whether or not the Devs decided to remove it.  EDIT: Doesn't look like you can after trying it in-game.  Oh well."
Grimdawn,3d5w5j,kuvter,2,Wed Jul 15 01:07:55 2015 UTC,"I remember there being some pathing bugs related to that early on, so I haven't tried to do it any time recently. They've improved most major pathing issues, in regard to skills twitching due to poor pathing and being blocked by enemies, but there is still more to be done on that front.   I know animation canceling exists to cancel skill such as shadow strike that has you disappear, move 500% speed, and reappear to attack an enemy; however it can be blocked if you target an enemy behind a wall of enemies. This is where the blocked skill would be buggy and it'd still try to path to the enemy, but couldn't. So, in those cases I've realized I could animation cancel.   I haven't tried it get more DPS, but it's there. I've used animation canceling when my Pets were acting funny, so you can even animation cancel a pet attack by telling them to move while mid attack. Again there seems to be some pathing issues that can make it work a little wonky.   TL;DR It's in the game, but some related pathing issues still exist."
Grimdawn,3d5w5j,ficm1990,11,Wed Jul 15 06:23:48 2015 UTC,"I just finished this game up to ACT 3. It is pretty amazing, the environments are insanely detailed and that is something which sets this game apart from other ARPGs. I also love the grimy gritty look of it that D2 had back in the day.  The classes/dual builds are pretty cool and fun to mess around with.  I believe Crate has something like 8 devs on their team and they must be working 24/7 because it looks like a team of 40 have been working on this thing and they are always posting on their forums and they are very active."
Grimdawn,3d5w5j,imsosick03k64,3,Mon Jul 13 20:24:21 2015 UTC,Just here to follow up - found the ga e about a month ago - and ive not gamed this hsrd since i was theory crafting builds when i first played diablo 2 . Just buy it and play it i dont know why you are waiting any longer!
Grimdawn,3d5w5j,jarlvk,4,Tue Jul 14 05:35:33 2015 UTC,"You might like the game or not, you best check out some lets play. This title is one of those very few examples where early access actually works just fine: good feedback, regular updates, no game breaking bugs."
Grimdawn,3d5w5j,vSTekk,2,Tue Jul 14 07:11:44 2015 UTC,"well i am yet to have bad early acces experience. maybe i am lucky, but everything i purchased early is turning out good.  Except Godus, i completely forget about that filth. Well, maybe i shouldn't believe to Molyneux :D"
Grimdawn,3d5w5j,radar920,5,Tue Jul 14 08:44:34 2015 UTC,This game even though it is unfinished is absolutely amazing.  There is great communication between the devs and the community.  Take a look at the misadventures on the forums.  They are regularly updating us on whats coming.  The last major patch was released weeks EARLY!  I've put in a few hundred hours and haven't come close to doing everything i want to do.   If you like ARPG's this game is a must.
Grimdawn,3d5w5j,atan23,3,Mon Jul 13 20:08:28 2015 UTC,"Having started playing early this year, I have seen the number of active multiplayer servers double to quadruple depending of the time you're playing and it's on the rising. If you're a bit in multiplayer and meeting and playing with people then do not worry.  The game is also improving as its community is growing and regular and significant patches are released. So nope, it's not dead, it's gonna keep growing and I reckon it will have a pretty good longevity going forward (years).  Devs have been picking it up lately, especially being more precise in their updates and what we can expect in the near future of the development. They have also increased the size of their team recently and the content getting released is of excellent quality and coming faster than before.  Now about deadlines: I'd be very surprised if they were not going to be late. Most of the core content is there, but there is still a new mastery coming up, a system of devotion that has yet to be implemented (skill modification through deities or constellations iirc), legendary items to be introduced, the last 2 difficulty level to be introduced as well as 25 more levels of progression for our characters (and probably some balancing for all of this) and most importantly the last Act (Act IV) to be released. Now that means that the devs still have a significant amount of work ahead of them; the good thing being that there's a lot of good stuff on the horizon coming up soon and also, at an accelerated pace. This game will be completed for sure. Crate Entertainment has taken the decision to extend and improve the content of Grim Dawn given its success, much to the pleasure of their customers!  It's tough to be objective on the direction the game's going since there is still some content missing that will shape the whole story, the way items are going to be farmed, the way classes are going to play out or even be (i.e shaman based classes), etc. So far, the devs have proved that they can produce a little gem in terms or ARPG/Hack&Slash of a game. They pay attention to feedbacks and their community and also have clear ideas of what they want to create/implement. Obviously the game being in early access there are some drastic changes that are made that impact skills, itemizations and difficulty, but that's to be expected. And when these changes aren't implemented to test out things that are balanced later on, they come for balance purpose that is mostly (and I say mostly) well thought-out.  TL;DR: Stay a while and listen."

I've sunk about 40hours into it and tried most the classes, unfortunatley not having multiplayer and only being able to get to ACT 3 i have stopped playing until its released or more content.  The game itself has a great atmosphere, great loot and a skill system I enjoy. Hopefully by the time its released we have triple the content currently in the game."

Put all your gear in the shared stash to save it for your remake and then delete the character.   My only other suggestion is to send whatever information you can to Crate first, so it can help them to prevent this from happening again.  Edit: ONe more thought. Did you possibly hit ""W"" and swap out your weapon to the starter weapon or to no weapon. That'd make you do no damage, but it doesn't explain the Tonics displaying incorrectly."
Grimdawn,3d4hxe,kuvter,0,Mon Jul 13 13:43:37 2015 UTC,"White gear ain't nothing to save (it doesn't drop anything else yet) and i've put the swap hotkey on the other side of the keyboard as i don't use it. So that's not the problem.  I'm also really hesitant at rerolling again as i'm so tired of devils crossing now that i actually rarely play it anymore, it's one of the most boring places i've visited since silvermoon city. Sure, the world has survived the grim dawn but they're just a bunch of hobos in a broken down jail with a grey backdrop. Of all the places i've seen in GD, DC is the most boring, unenthusastic, unfinished of them all, even the sewers under the jail are more fun and pretty. And when the starting area sucks so much it's not fun at all to reroll. I'd much rather get dumped in the wilderness than to be forced to start out in DC."

Once I hit lvl 3 or 4 I take that boat, just outside of DC, to the island and kill the lvl 7's till I'm lvl 7+ and easily beat burial hill. Rush through the areas, basically speed running quests, and before I know it I'm lvl 20+ Warden is killed, no more DC.  Also, once you finish burial hill you get access to your shared stash and can twink your character with lvl 7 gear with decent components. Everything is easy after that, especially if you max out a lower level skill.    White gear ain't nothing to save (it doesn't drop anything else yet)    Losing a lvl 15 character ain't nothing to worry about. Remember the game is still in Alpha. Alpha, not even Beta. This is a pretty bug free game for an Alpha."
Grimdawn,3d4hxe,kuvter,-1,Mon Jul 13 15:52:40 2015 UTC,"See that's the problem, i don't want to speedrun the game. What is even the point of having great content if you're just gonna skip it entirely.  And what boat? I have never even seen a boat yet.  In the games defense though, i had a gap for a couple of updates so i might've missed some rebalancing and/or other stuff."
Grimdawn,3d4hxe,DefinitelyNotCeno,2,Mon Jul 13 16:05:51 2015 UTC,"See that's the problem, i don't want to speedrun the game.   That's not a problem, that's a preference. If you don't like DC, don't want to make a new character to get back to lvl 15, and don't want to power your way past it, then I suggest you go play something else. Gaming is supposed to be fun, enjoyable and an escape. If you're not getting joy out of it then why do it?   And what boat? I have never even seen a boat yet.   To find the row boat, take the noob zone bridge (North East) out of devil's crossing and turn an immediate left, following the water. There will be one group of trees/brush and it'll be on your left by an outhouse. It was added when faction tables were added, B25, May 11.  A quest for it unlocks after you're honored with DC, but you can go to the island any time without the quest. Also the quest won't be available until you've completed all the bonus faction quests before it.  I've played over 300 hours of Grim Dawn and still love it; I try out new builds and theorycraft to keep it fun. That's why I'm picking on you for complaining about simply leveling up to 15 again, because of a bug."

Grimdawn,3cr62r,organicpastaa,6,Fri Jul 10 02:54:06 2015 UTC,"Without looking or thinking of the other classes. If you made the game and wanted to make your character cooler, what would you add? After answering that see if the game provides it. Also note that next update there will be a new class, Shaman, added. So if you don't know see what you want now, it might get added.    Another way to look at it is what is your character lacking? You already answered this slightly with heals and movement speed. There are ways to get those through gear, not just skills. But if you want to do it with skills there is Military Conditioning for health and Mehir's Will for passive healing (Soldier) Alternative to heals is more defense Mirror and Maiven's (Arcanist). Another alternative to heals is more damage, lots of fire skills (Demolitionist). Speed you already figured out, Pneumatic Burst (Nightblade). Pets can mitigate damage, but so can Cursing your enemies, (Occultist). All are viable option to add to your build, so have fun with it, pick one and run with it. Replayablity in this game is high.  Grim Calc can help to make those decissons, just put in the points you already allocated and you'll be able to play around with your options for the remaining points, showing you what you could get at the current max of lvl 50.   If you don't want to decide now, since your skill allocation can be changed (respec), but your progression/class bar can't. Then stop putting points into that bottom bar, play around with adding points to currently accessible skills and make the decision later what to do, then respec to get the points back to do it. In short you're stuck with 41 or 42 points in Arcanist (bottom bar) - in this playthrough - but everything else is changeable.   Theorycrafting is fun. There are many ways to make a fun viable build in this game at this state in the game. I say have fun with it and use the repec options the game gives you to try stuff out. But since it's your first time, experiment. There are no wrong options."
Grimdawn,3cr62r,kuvter,4,Fri Jul 10 05:01:10 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the very in depth response :)    Indeed , at least to me, the only thing the build seems lacking now is a heal and a more mobility... I didn't realize gear could help with such things as well, thank you for pointing that out! I'll check out the Soldier tree, that is one I have not looked into very much :P I tried out Maiven's Sphere earlier in the game and I was not impressed and I was really disapointed because I enjoyed the look of the spell. Maybe now that I have more stats it would be worth trying again ;)    Anyways, thank you for the advice. I agree about the theorycrafting, I've changed my build a lot on the way here to level 30 already. Now it's getting expensive! Haha."

I'm not sure if it's worth going in Occultist though just for that healing spell...

Grimdawn,3cr62r,kuvter,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:28:50 2015 UTC,"With min points they'll die faster but still be useful as a distraction, optimized after you learn how to use them correctly. The bird can toss a heal on you and both can provide distraction but won't kill for you like a pure summoner. Can also use the hound as a bomb when its on low health - or anytime really by recasting it, so its good for mob moments or on bosses while cool downs are active etc etc"
Grimdawn,3cr62r,kuvter,2,Sat Jul 11 02:17:33 2015 UTC,"I've loved Maivens. At first level you take 1/4th less damage. At max it's around 40%. Additionally you can have it up about half the time. That elemental resist is amazing too.  I normally wait till I know I'm running into a pack of mobs or running over damaging land to use it, or when a battle isn't going well.  As for being expensive, everything seems that way, and is that way, with the first character."

My problem when I had it before is I didn't even have enough energy regen to keep my channeling Ray, and I'd use Maivens, and run out of energy so fast....So I cut it. Now, I can almost consistently channel Ray at level 12 so it might be time to check it out again huh? :)"

Grimdawn,3cr62r,FlawlessHappiness,2,Fri Jul 10 18:47:34 2015 UTC,"Coo, , yeah, I guess there is no harm in trying it out again at least. It seems like the best thing to do would be to try out Maivens again actually and see if I enjoy it, because I can always respect that, rather then trying out a different class first... Good point!    As for the points into Spirit, I have literally put 100% of my attribute points into spirit thus far :b Luckily I have had no problems with Physique yet ( for gear ) ,  probably because I've put so many points into mastery which got me to a bit over 200 physique."
Grimdawn,3cr62r,kuvter,2,Fri Jul 10 18:50:22 2015 UTC,"If all your points are in Spirit then find a piece of gear that says ""+% energy regen"" I found a helm or maybe offhand that have 76%... One piece of gear like that would almost double your regen.  Anything adding +# energy regen helps. Using rings and amulets helps a lot for that, then you can still wear the best Spirit armor without sacrificing for the regen, or get +regen armor too.. Kill things so fast that they can't get close enough to attack you, and kite bosses."
Grimdawn,3cr62r,Nuffinghon,2,Fri Jul 10 20:07:59 2015 UTC,"Side note: most all my builds in Grim Dawn are straight main stat (Physique, Cunning, or Spirit) until the last couple levels, then I see what gear I want and min/max to wear the stuff with the best stats. Sometimes they end up staying main stat, because I can put on a +30 Physique ring to wear the gear I want."

Grimdawn,3cm088,Kane_Harkonnen,3,Fri Jul 10 10:37:06 2015 UTC,Considering how much i have played this game so far i would like to get the upgrade/s too if or when they come available.
