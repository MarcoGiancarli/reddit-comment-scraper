DigitalPainting,3e3um4,artsi,2,Tue Jul 21 19:19:29 2015 UTC,"Looks great, just keep an eye on the perspective of the tank turret. The angle of the muzzle is a bit steep for it to be almost perpendicular to the viewing plane. Or, if that perspective is correct, make the main body of the turret a little smaller so it aligns properly in perspective"
DigitalPainting,3e5422,mushymomo,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:56:00 2015 UTC,"Its looks great! There are only a few things I would have done. First, add some pore texture where the light hits her cheeks bones and such. I can see you put some very faint dark pores, but when zoomed out the skin looks very smooth and faintly ""doll-like"", although your color choices are fantastic. The second thing is the small reddish-gold highlights by the roots on the left part of the hair. That is the only place they're present, and it seems odd that none of the other hairs would have that type of highlighting. Other than that, its a very nice piece."
DigitalPainting,3e5422,OminNoms,1 point,Wed Jul 22 04:06:45 2015 UTC,"Looks great! I would say clean up the hairline at the forehead, soften the lines of the nose, and lower the opacity on the red highlights in the hair and make them more linear instead of dots. Also, I'm not sure what the blue thing above the right (left) eye. Is it eyeshadow? If it is, it needs to be toned down or change it from the eye color. Otherwise it's looking good. :)"

DigitalPainting,3dykqd,wompemwompem,3,Mon Jul 20 18:48:47 2015 UTC,"It's very nice! The only thing is that the painting is a bit monochrome. I would add some different shades in the skin tone, maybe a touch of red at the edge of the ear, a bit on the cheeks, a tiny hint of blue in the shadows (very small amount, just a little bit) or instead of blue a warm brown tone to counteract the neutral-ness of the piece. However, you're doing a great job so far :)"

DigitalPainting,3dujft,Darren1337,1 point,Mon Jul 20 07:56:57 2015 UTC,Does illustrator preserve its scalability even after you've used feather/brush things?
DigitalPainting,3dujft,MyNamesE,1 point,Mon Jul 20 08:47:14 2015 UTC,From what I've found illustrator scales vectors with feather and brush effects as it would do with a normal vector. I haven't tested it immensely. Large versions of the images don't seem pixelated at all
DigitalPainting,3dx15b,Portalboat,6,Mon Jul 20 06:14:09 2015 UTC,you're painting on a white background. the reference background is blue purple. colours are relative to each other. beige on white will not look the same as beige on blue purple.
DigitalPainting,3dx15b,arifterdarkly,3,Mon Jul 20 07:39:06 2015 UTC,"As have been said a lot of time in this sub and /r/learnart   Draw what you see, not what you think what you see.  If you see the color black in the shadow, use black. If you see pink or purple, use those colors. And you do probably want to have more contrast in your painting, darker shadows, brighter highlights. Try to draw in greyscale, that will help you with values.  I recommend to watch:    https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=sycra+values https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=knkl+values"
DigitalPainting,3dx15b,Yzov,2,Mon Jul 20 10:39:35 2015 UTC,I would add more blues and grays to your palette. Often the brain overrides what the eye actually see with what the brain thinks it should see. Throw out what you think you know about skin color and just focus on the individual shades you see in that hand.
DigitalPainting,3dx15b,snugginator,2,Mon Jul 20 06:20:22 2015 UTC,"Yup. No human is perfectly a tan color. Looking at my hand, I can see a lot of pink, some almost white light highlights, dark brown/orange shadows, even the pale, greenish blueish tinge from the veins and arteries running through"

DigitalPainting,3dx15b,ironcurtin57,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:14:52 2015 UTC,"You need a purple background dawg, colors change drastically relative to the other colors in the composition"
DigitalPainting,3dx15b,arrow97,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:07:16 2015 UTC,I know a few artist in the industry and they always told be to start off with black and white! That way your values will always be at their best. After that apply the color with multiply over it and after doing so you can go ahead and add what ever you feel will bring out the painting
DigitalPainting,3dx15b,-Swade-,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:05:34 2015 UTC,"Color selection is hard because it's about relativity.  You won't know if a color is correct until you know the color next to it.  And that color will depend on the color next to it and so on.  Everything color on the canvas has dependencies on everything else.  My old painting professor would tell you that you haven't really gotten started on a painting until the entire canvas is covered.  Only then can you evaluate your decisions and start painting.  So if you intend your background to be white then yes, you have not made the correct color choices.  If you are trying to match your reference exactly the backdrop is too major an element to ignore.  As is the dark cast shadow on the backdrop.  But if you do intend to use the purple backdrop your color choices might not be as far off as you think.  But you won't know for sure until you put the color down."

I spent some time learning what all the settings were, and then I went out and took some texture photos to use as grain.  I also recommend the Daub brushes from Paolo (http://www.daub-brushes.com/), he has cheap, great brushes for almost any type of natural media. Some of them are a bit slow on my Surface Pro 2, but many are beautiful to work with.  Check his tutorial on how to make a pencil: http://www.paololimoncelli.com/pencil-in-mangastudio/"

I think the next thing you can do to improve is work on anatomy and proportions. Proportions are a huge part of making a piece believable and overall look better, and anatomy helps you draw from different views as well as adding to the realism (if that is the style you choose to go for). Once you have proportions and anatomy down, your drawings will improve more and more.  I checked out your DeviantArt and you've got a great start so far - keep going and use resources! Good luck!"

DigitalPainting,3dqo41,Portalboat,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:43:41 2015 UTC,"I believe the ear is too low on the head. Where the eye comes to a point on the outside should be a straight line to the middle of the ear. The neck is a bit long, could also just be disproportionate with the left shoulder. As others have mentioned with the eyes. They could just be a bit to large compared to the other features of the face. The bangs need more definition, a light shadow on the forehead could help with that. Seems a bit flat. Its a very nice peace though, your shading is wonderful and you captured the emotion very well.

DigitalPainting,3drbha,Blackultra,8,Sat Jul 18 18:30:15 2015 UTC,"Ahh so! Landscapes, you wanna create the illusion of depth. This means having a clear foreground, middleground, and background. Foreground: details and objects must be in SHARP detail and vivid in color (is yours? no. very dark and no detail). Middleground: less true to color, more blue, and not as sharp (your middleground area has the highest amount of blur, it shouldn't). Background: Very blue, hazy, not well defined (your background is actually the most defined part of the piece, as I can easily pick out the mountain, clouds, and lens flare. see the sharp outline of your mtn? that is the sharpest line in your piece, and it shouldn't be).  Your piece looks like it is all blurry/hazy. I don't see any discerning features except the mountains and clouds in the background. Those should be the things that are least discernable.  Here is how I would edit the piece: separate everything into 3 layers on photoshop/corel/whatever you're using. That way the edges of the black/green foreground uh..shape...won't start to blend when you are coloring in the other parts. That's why it all looks like it's on one plane. You are blending your foreground objects with the middleground, middleground with background, etc and you shouldn't do that. Gather some source images and make defined shapes. You can also add more color to your foreground (reds and orange maybe).   I'd also look at chinese and japanese scroll art, since the scrolls have a similar height & width ratio to your piece. Here is a good example of what I'm talking about."
DigitalPainting,3drbha,AddictivePotential,2,Sat Jul 18 22:23:10 2015 UTC,"Here's a good tutorial that uses this separation technique.  Edit: It's a paid tutorial, I'm not affiliated with DT, I just found it useful."

DigitalPainting,3drbha,du5t,1 point,Sun Jul 19 07:20:42 2015 UTC,"everything AD said here, i second that.   i'd also like to mention the composition. the horizon line feel dead center of the image, like i'm standing on a cliff looking down on those things by the foot of that mountainesque. but i'm also looking up at the sky. that means that i'm not down by those things, or watching from a bird's eye. i'm just in the middle. and it doesn't feel like your painting benefits from that kind of composition."
DigitalPainting,3dswa9,Whiteout-,2,Sun Jul 19 03:29:28 2015 UTC,"It's ok but keep drawing, keep practicing. If you're not using a graphics tablet, get one. Do some online tutorials, there are plenty of great free tutes out there. Look for figure drawing and digital painting.  Put your line art on a separate layer too. But main thing I would focus on for now is drawing and practice, practice, practice. The more you draw the more you really start paying attention to the form of things, how they sit in 3 dimensions. Draw from physical reference, not imagination to start and when you're doing this make sure you're really looking at the shape of the person/object in front of you instead of just drawing what you think it looks like."

Otherwise get used to the pen tool and brace yourself to be extremely patient! (Especially if you find yourself running into 'vector' line art)  du5t gave you a link for tutorials... I'll do my share and give you mine. ->  http://www.ctrlpaint.com/ I've bought EVERYTHING from this site and it will help you grasp the vast majority for what you need. The only thing it doesn't cover is human anatomy. Matt Kohr is an excellent teacher for the basics. There's plenty of 'free stuff' on the site but I encourage to explore it and buy some of the videos if you are still interested in his teaching style...

DigitalPainting,3dny8t,ToxicValkyrie,2,Fri Jul 17 20:34:01 2015 UTC,"You put a lot of detail into your work, but sometimes you need to scale back on the details. You should try to focus the detail work on the focal point of the image, which in this painting I assume is the largest figure.   Try doing the same thing with the values. When I looked at the greyscale version I noticed that like 85% of the painting was mid tones. Try to follow the rule of ""2/3, 1/3, a little bit"", meaning that you want the 2/3s of the painting to be one value, while the remaining third (usually your focal point) will be another, and then you'll have a little bit of the last. Normally it will be something like 2/3s mid tone for background, 1/3 dark for the focal point, and a little bit of light for high lights. You can mix it up in different ways, but generally you want to follow that rule. When you have too much of one value, everything sort of blends together and gets lost in the painting."
DigitalPainting,3dny8t,ghostdate,1 point,Sat Jul 18 07:46:51 2015 UTC,"I'll try to follow your value tips as that is something i still am working on. As for the detail part, currently I am trying to go for an overkill and force myself to see how much i can put into one painting. I know it's now really the ''proper'' thing to do, but it's something I am experimenting with."
DigitalPainting,3dny8t,ghostdate,2,Sat Jul 18 10:01:09 2015 UTC,"Oh, yeah, by all means, push yourself. One thing is that the shapes of the details are very repetitive, like a bunch of scales almost.  You should try doing texture type detail in addition to the distinct shapes. Little scratches and scuffs will help bring things to life."

Sketch and ink outline on left, and very quick coloring on the right (it was late, just wanted to see how it looked).  Long ways to go yet, but I was surprised I was able to pull this off in my first attempt.  Realized after I completed the ink outline that I should've made the sketch a separate layer. Doh."

I plan to do this probably 2 or 3 more steps.  I always struggle with doing too much detail when I start out, so I decided to restrain myself by only giving myself a very limited number of pixels to start with. I also haven't had the greatest success in picking color before, so this has greatly helped. The current step is at 128x418, so not quite a true 5:1 ratio."

If the light source is not natural light like sunlight or white it will not disperse the same color spectrum and bounce back in the light color more than the surface. These are more laymans rules I use:)
DigitalPainting,3danek,mihachris,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:16:21 2015 UTC,"Thank you for bringing this ancient art style of out door painting into the 21st century. I really like the idea of being able to paint without the mess of paint, and I suspect a tablet would be much easier to try to take outside than an easel, canvas, and box of twisted paint tubes and grotty paint brushes."
DigitalPainting,3danek,Paulrik,2,Wed Jul 15 02:36:34 2015 UTC,"Ah, sorry for the misleading title. It was a virtual plein air, meaning  hop on google maps and search for locations to paint. I really wish I had a laptop though or a Cintiq Companion so I could get out and paint from life."
DigitalPainting,3danek,Paulrik,1 point,Wed Jul 15 10:07:57 2015 UTC,Well then it's virtually the same as actually going outside to paint.
DigitalPainting,3danek,joemizu,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:11:53 2015 UTC,"Yeah, pretty much.   Although, from what other, more experienced artists say, painting from life is the best way to improve.

DigitalPainting,3danek,Ink-Dash,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:26:54 2015 UTC,How long did this take you? and i guess you just went out with tablet&laptop to paint? And amazing water and sky!!
DigitalPainting,3danek,Ink-Dash,1 point,Wed Jul 15 10:13:27 2015 UTC,Unfortunately no. Check my reply above.  It took 1.5-2 hours roughly. I always lose time when I paint cause I generally take breaks.  Glad you like it! :)

DigitalPainting,3dckt8,cabadajabba,2,Wed Jul 15 05:50:45 2015 UTC,"I really like the colors and feel of this one, although there are some technical errors. Judging from the comment you made on my post, you are just starting out in Photoshop.  First of all, if you aren't working from photo references, do it. It's really hard to paint from imagination. Gradually you will build a visually library that will help you a lot.  Your composition isn't working cause you have two very big masses equally spaced, each on the sides of the image. It's very symmetrical and kinda boring. You need more dynamic lines as well as variety of size in shapes.  Other than that, depth of field as you mentioned needs some work. Use atmospheric perspective to push things back. Just watch Shaddy's tutorial that I recommended you and try to really understand and apply the things he says. Start working from references and you will improve fast.  Keep it up!"
DigitalPainting,3dckt8,mihachris,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:38:10 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the critique! I actually did this in Paint Tool Sai, but I am considering moving to Photoshop for more detailed and natural brushes.   I liked your idea of exploring Google Earth for scenery to paint, and I hope you don't mind if I steal it. :) I was working very loosely on a Bob Ross tutorial for this one, to see if I could use the same technique for pine trees that he does.   Would the composition work better if I removed the large tree on the right? I had it there to try to add more depth.   And thanks again for recommending the tutorials!"

DigitalPainting,3dawuf,PM_Me_YourArt,6,Wed Jul 15 01:08:52 2015 UTC,"I think you should worry less about finishing pieces, and concentrate more on focused studies. Noah Bradley posted a cool write up of his entire career from hobbiest to skilled professional: https://medium.com/@noahbradley/how-i-became-an-artist-4390c6b6656c. He talks about how he made the transition from hobby to student, and what kind of work he was doing.   I would recommend learning the basics by doing still lifes, master studies, and taking some intro art classes at a community college. Your block is not coming from some lack of motivation or special thing, but its coming from the fact you don't have the knowledge to take your art any further then what you posted. You have to learn the basic art fundamentals first, and then creating original art will be possible."

I broke through this habit by just drawing what came out of the end of my stylus. No set plans for the finished product and no set schedule and ive found that digital is much more fun when you just let the stylus flow.

For me this is seemingly impossible as learning how to ride a bike with reverse steering. I know how it's done, I know I can 'paint', but my brain...  anyway, there other methods. start with flat colouring, divide areas and place them in separate layers,  then add shading. This is easier to work with.  [edit] also the hands look weird, I think if you add a bit more detail it will unweird it."

If it's along the lines of 10+ hours then maybe try bumping up your time limit. Honestly, anything less than that I would keep it at one hour at least for a week or two. Can't expect results overnight, y'know?  I think you're doing well getting the sketching and shading down that quickly.

DigitalPainting,3d2xw9,snugginator,2,Mon Jul 13 02:42:08 2015 UTC,Draw a small palette for yourself on a top layer like a small white box in the corner and put each color you're using on that layer. Then you will always be able to sample the true color and you can turn your palette layer on and off as you need to with the little eye icon.

AND THEN you will want to subscribe to her channel and watch her critique hours. i keep them on while i paint because even if they're not DIRECTLY related to my paintings and i'm not a beginner, they keep reminding me of the fundamental principles of light and shadow. and it makes me feel less alone in the world :(  she livestreams twice a week, too. you wanna get in on that.   if you want to get a real book, get http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8384010-color-and-light Colour and Light, by James Gurney. i slept with my copy next to me for over a year. hardcore! got it from abebooks.com though, not goodreads.   form studies like this http://istebrak.deviantart.com/gallery/51756665/studies and sexy form studies like this http://ienkub.deviantart.com/art/Burned-545675282  (aww, she's even got an upvote!) leads to sweetness like this http://jameszapata.deviantart.com/art/Moon-and-Crow-title-412975355 and http://cryptcrawler.deviantart.com/art/Dark-Queen-Guinevere-363210566"

I haven't painted or drawn in 5 years, I am 23 and i bought a digital tablet a few weeks back and started doing paintings. i wanted to actually learn technique since i never had but i also got asked for some paintings first so i'm finishing those up before istart on all these theories.  So my first week with the tablet i watched and paited some of cubebrush's head tutorials. Here is that album. The first image was the first day with the tablet, i fixed her proportions a bit more later on.  Then the next week someone wanted a penguin at a bar, it isn't finished but the latest version is at the top of this album.  Then I partied for a week out of town and...  now I'm back and doing a quick Widowmaker (A french sniper character in the upcoming video game Overwatch) and that's what i'm working on tonight. Here is what I got so far, going for a 1950's pin up girl style but thats sorta not happening... Theres gonna be her sniper and baguettes at the bottom left leaning against the table, going for a rule of thirds sorta thing.   edit1: Also beautiful painting Mr. Tran =D I love it so much.  edit2: Danm I love those paintings in your post, gorgeous."
DigitalPainting,3cvvub,Drawn23,2,Sat Jul 11 21:47:39 2015 UTC,"cubebrush, yes i remember posting a portrait based on his tutorial. the subreddit tore it apart. your portraits also looked pretty identical to the one i made, so what we learned from that tutorial was effin' useless.   okay, so the widowmaker. do you have a reference for that pose? it looks like the most uncomfortable position ever. her head and the hand looks really good, but the proportions are way off. i can't make sense of you knowing how to draw hands like that, but you can't see that the arm is too long and in the wrong position. it looks like you have learned to draw very specific things and then guessing wildly when drawing other things. so, find a reference you can work with. and do more simple studies.   yes, the paintings in my post are gorgeous. one of them is mine..."
DigitalPainting,3cvvub,Drawn23,1 point,Sun Jul 12 00:22:09 2015 UTC,"Lmao, I don't really make sense as a person so your slight bewilderment in my inconsistencies is understandable. I haven't really ""learned to draw"" anything formally or specifically, tutorials lessons practice nothing (Cubebrush head tutorial was my first), I  bullshit my way through whatever i do. I want to definitely start building a strong foundation from now on though!   Anyway a friend and I were discussing earlier how tense she looks and how the arm head and torso were fighting each other. His idea was to flip the legs and we also thought to slightly rotate the face and chest toward the viewer. Haven't finished rotating the chest and head yet but Anyway the latest update is on top of the album here. She looks a bit more relaxed like this i think. I don't have a reference for the pose either, I'm just visualizing it in my head how it would look and feel to be in a pose like that and its really really tense =(. Right after I finish this painting I'm going to exclusively gather knowledge and practice simple studies like you mentioned.  I must know which one is yours! I truly like them all so either way your a complete monster...cool =)  edit1:Been trying to move things around all night. Referencing the latest upload, if your willing, would you describe what is currently out of proportion/what body parts you would resize/reangle especially toward the goal of achieving a better posture. Do you prefer the legs flipped like this or the way it was before. Not using a reference for this posture was definitely a mistake, I'm currently trying to visualize how to change her body to make this painting work. To me the worst offense in this painting is the disproportion in the arms and how broad the shoulders look, the left shoulder has armor on it but the right one has no excuse for sticking out that far."

DigitalPainting,3cvvub,claireballoon,1 point,Sun Jul 12 09:43:43 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the advice and info, I 100% agree with you about erasing and starting over, if there is one thing that is always in the back of my mind is the thought telling me to be fearless and burn it all to the ground, don't be afraid to erase and start over, however, I don't have the freedom to do so, this painting is for a friend and I am ultra limited on time, with the speed I move at I won't have time to start coloring!  So if you are curious, I will just be choosing this one (Which I believe is more relaxed) or this one (more sexy IMO but more twisted/tense) and I'm just gonna go for it.  I'm sure your trained eyes already know this but the reason her right arm just out like that is because shes resting it on the side of the chair thats not yet there.  Also I wouldn't say Widowmaker is a tough chick, she has been experimented on a shit ton so the only emotion left to her is accomplishment when she completes her assassination/mission.  And of course it's the upvote chick =D"
DigitalPainting,3cvvub,greymanart,1 point,Sun Jul 12 17:33:05 2015 UTC,"I would suggest doing a 3/4 view on your portraits. Doing a head that is facing forward like that teaches proportions, but it doesn't really teach form--everything just seems flat.   For your widowmaker, look up some references poses and even look up some pin-up girl paintings for composition and color. Keep it up!"

I find it a lot easier when I'm focusing on a still life of an object for the first time to stage something similar or find something on Google. Even if it's something realistic I like to make a bit of a mock up in a 3D program and add a light source to see how things will react and where shadows will fall.  Keep up the good work :)

DigitalPainting,3cs1jf,HuultoFirehoof,7,Fri Jul 10 08:44:25 2015 UTC,"Art and drawing are stylizations of reality. There are an infinite number of ways we can portray something and still perceive it as what it's supposed to be. Individual styles are certain ways artists tweak reality, it can be form, linework, light, color. If you want to nail a certain style, study its reality first, and then study how an artist portrays things in their own way. I've seen people try to copy styles without knowledge beforehand, and things are always off even though it may feel different and successful. In the painting you linked, I notice that straight lines are curved, colors and shading is wobbly and painterly, and  shadows are brightly saturated, and there is not a lot of directional lighting. Little details like that contribute to style."
DigitalPainting,3cs1jf,AngieMyst,4,Fri Jul 10 11:48:45 2015 UTC,"Style is something hard to nail down. If I ask any of my co-workers, as artists, they will say they don't have a style at all. Everyone but yourself, can see your ""style"", but you'll always likely find that it looks rough, or it could be better.  If I was in a situation where I wanted to learn a style, I'd just start trying to mimic it. In the end, you're drawing and you're working out things for yourself. The end product will always have your own personal twist and your style will just come to the surface eventually."
DigitalPainting,3cs1jf,Vandalhart,2,Fri Jul 10 11:09:21 2015 UTC,"Thanks so much for the response, I get ya. Is there any good hints or tips that make it easier or simpler to breakdown someones style or is it just a matter of trial and error and just mucking around with things?"
DigitalPainting,3cs1jf,kempsridley,4,Fri Jul 10 11:15:18 2015 UTC,"Beyond just mimicking people's style, try to identify what it is about their art that you actually like and incorporate those aspects into your own work. Is it their boxy lines, smooth brushwork/blending, use of bright colors, attention to minute details, etc.? Sometimes I just write a small list about what things I like about an artwork or artist on a piece of paper in a notebook and occasionally I'll glance at it to get some inspiration for my own stuff."
DigitalPainting,3cs1jf,Vandalhart,3,Fri Jul 10 13:00:58 2015 UTC,"The only advice I get whenever I ask someone that question is ""Just draw/paint"".

DigitalPainting,3cs1jf,ghostdate,1 point,Fri Jul 10 11:50:03 2015 UTC,Try to replicate the picture. Over and over and over and over. Train your brain to do the same thing. It's the same as learning to do anything.

DigitalPainting,3crlyf,Vandalhart,1 point,Fri Jul 10 05:26:08 2015 UTC,"Having fun definitely helps. One thing I would suggest would be to look at the perspective of your drawing and find out where your vanishing point(s) are. The cubes that are in the foreground aren't jiving with the perspective of the metalwork in the background. They also don't match up in terms of detail. To blend them closer together, I'd redraw the background elements so they looked a little closer to the front ones."

At the last minute, I lifted from Barricade's first stage background and I'm not quite sure what I was thinking at the time. Definitely does not line up with the vanishing point.  The lighting is meant to be top left, how would the lighting work on the cubes? I had trouble conceptualizing that and took my best guess."
DigitalPainting,3cr0oi,artdemaxim,2,Fri Jul 10 02:07:27 2015 UTC,"i think you should make realism and accuracy your biggest concerns. you paint on a white background, shade with black, and the perspective is inaccurate, three beginner mistakes. you use your brush as a pen and hatch and cross hatch instead of increasing the size of the brush to make clean lines.    painting on a white background on a computer is different than drawing on a white piece of paper. the light coming from the paper is reflected light, the light from the screen is direct light. your eyes get tired, meaning that the chemicals in your eyes which are used to signal to the brain that you have hard, intense light in front of you, deplete. but you shouldn't paint on a white background just to make it easier on the eyes. to quote Will Kemp,   The number one mistake all beginners make is buying a pre-stretched canvas or canvas board from a discount book store and not unwrapping the cellophane from it.  The number two mistake is leaving the canvas white when they start painting.   he's talking about analogue painting, but it still applies to us. using a toned background, be it colour or gray, sets a tone for the painting. a dark background feels different from a light background and they create different moods. the background colour will also be shown in reflected light, which not only is cool but also connects the subject to the background. http://danielauhlig.deviantart.com/art/Devil-298348865 it means that your character doesn't just exist in a white vacuum. you don't have to do an elaborate background with a whole interior or exterior setting, just something that isn't pure white. http://fdasuarez.deviantart.com/art/Morrigan-doodle-302235567 http://ienkub.deviantart.com/art/Femme-Fatale-194630950 note in this painting how her hair and skin and the claws stands out against the dark background. if this was painted on a pure white background, her skin, her hair and the claws would look dark. but now they look bright! more examples would be every painting by the classic masters.  realistic skin tones https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7EpXCnN0lo (note the background of her canvas.)  brushes http://redd.it/2ulyad"

Really excited to be on this subreddit :)  I've had a tablet for a while now and always start and stop digital painting; I can never get the traction or motivation to keep doing it. I've drawn ""IRL"" for many years and am quite comfortable with the medium but digital painting has always been much more difficult for me.  I now recognize that I need other more experienced people to dissect my work in order to move forward. I don't have any friends/colleagues that digitally paint, so here I am!  My biggest questions are less about realism or accuracy etc. (though those crits are definitely welcome!) and more about digital painting techniques. For instance, I can never seem to find brushes that feel right. What brushes do you all use? I find I'm always going over the same spots over and over again until I can get them remotely where I want them to be. I just need a little guidance before the medium can click for me."

DigitalPainting,3cmgv1,rogueSleipnir,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:30:34 2015 UTC,"So I've been mulling over the sub's rules on photobashing and textures. I thought it was strictly against all forms of that.  On a recent thread, I found that it can be allowed but only if used the right way. I want to learn how to use it the acceptable way.  The initial thumbnail was blocked in with brushes: the ground, city and mountain silhouettes.  The clouds were done with a brush, city lights from multiple textures for detail and the mountains too.  Any tips would be nice. Thanks!"
DigitalPainting,3cmgv1,arifterdarkly,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:34:57 2015 UTC,"i understand the importance of being able to have textures. and we used to be a lot stricter and have zero tolerance for photobashing. in essence, i remove art that look like it began as a photo. if it looks like you added textures to a painting, i don't remove it. yes, that's an obscure and hazy line, so how to put it in another way... photo textures are fine to use to enhance a painting. but if the painting couldn't have been made possible without the use of photos, you've need to take a step back and learn how to paint.   because photobashing is a shortcut - and it's totally fine to use shortcuts in any other situation than when you're learning. (unless you're learning how to photobash.) but this subreddit is for learning. and if you're not here to learn, you're here to self-promote and that's not allowed."

DigitalPainting,3chl5z,Kandiflipz,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:38:46 2015 UTC,"http://www.ctrlpaint.com/  Check out this site, it has everything you need to know on how to start painting and drawing in general in small bite-sized videos, as well as info on brushes and stuff like that.  As for my personal advice, I'd say you shouldn't worry about brushes early on, it really doesn't matter. You need to learn to use basic brushes first to be able to paint anything.

DigitalPainting,3cfk9t,C_Morzy,2,Tue Jul 7 19:07:56 2015 UTC,"Wow, beautiful work. The expression on her face is exceptionally well done, and I love how you've done her eyes. My only criticism is that her right arm (the lower arm) seems rough compared to the rest of your painting. Her forearm looks disproportionately large to me, and doesn't have the same smooth elegance the rest of her does.  That's really my only criticism, and I had to nitpick to find it. You've done really well with the lighting too, the shadows on her face are thoughtfully done.  Great stuff, keep it up."
DigitalPainting,3cfk9t,AngryMoonBear,2,Tue Jul 7 19:24:02 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the response. The right arm is big, because well, my arm is big(reference photo, potato quality). I slimmed it down a bit so it does look a bit more proportional now.   And even though I really tried to keep the proportions tight,  I still feel like some of it looks off, even though after checking it (like the head looking a bit small, shoulders too narrow) but I think it might be just from looking at the piece for way too long."
DigitalPainting,3cfk9t,TorgeirFjereide,3,Tue Jul 7 20:14:45 2015 UTC,"Hey, this is really good stuff! I did a little paintover to point some stuff out, for fun. Mine's on the left and yours is on the right, with numbered notes.   Imgur  You've done a good job with the image as a whole, but there's a couple of things you can keep in mind next time you're painting, or to bump this up a notch.  1 : Be careful with the creases and folds in clothing - don't get too sharp and don't be afraid of having large open areas of it with just subtle transitions instead of putting in too many folds. Think in terms of soft edge or hard edge, and don't be afraid of putting a little more contrast in the lights like I've shown. Simplify! :)  2: Try not to use solid 100% black anywhere, except if doing lineart for something in a comic book style- At least here it distracts a little bit.  3: Your reference doesn't show a hard edge between the shadow on the shoulder and the front of the  chest here, just a strange little thing.  4: Keep a small handheld mirror near you when painting and use your own hands as reference, it works wonders and saves you a lot of time and frustration.  5: You are already able to describe form well, but try to do it with as big a brush as you can use for the given task at hand. Don't think of hair, for example, as a bunch of strands but more of a mass that you can paint in one brush stroke.  Other than that I'd say it's a pretty solid piece. I didn't really do much in the paintover either, as the base was good already - just a little simplification here and there, and some softening mostly.  Keep doing more of these as you seem to be learning a lot already, good luck!"
DigitalPainting,3ci8ks,Sweetviolet615,1 point,Wed Jul 8 02:51:55 2015 UTC,level adjust and clean up the scanned image so that all that is left is black lines on white background.  set layer blending mode to Multiply.  paint on layer underneath.   digital painting tutorials -  step by step guides on how to do it - are usually not very good because they're very limiting. reading this article will get you going http://redd.it/2334eb and for portraits it's of course very good to know the planes of the head.

DigitalPainting,3cisbz,SoraXes,3,Wed Jul 8 06:12:29 2015 UTC,"digital art is also collage and creative photo manipulation (which i think is more advanced than just basic photoshop). and i hope to christ a college course in art deals with colour theory and composition too, as that's way more important than specific tools. if i could give a bit of advice, i'd take the digital illustration class and get some of the Gnomon lectures/dvd's on colour theory and composition."
DigitalPainting,3chbbc,ScholarlyTrout,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:23:04 2015 UTC,"Get a sketchbook and tracing paper. Print out the finch. Trace the finch (in as much or little detail as you want). Transfer finch to sketchbook paper and shade/add smaller details using the photo for reference. Do this 7 or 8 times. Okay, maybe 2 or 3.   You have to learn the correct proportions & shape of the bird and this is the easiest way to do it. But you can't just see the correct proportions. Your hand muscles have to feel it, your brain has to make new series of connections. Then when you draw it for real, your brain and the muscles in your hand are already familiar with it.  When you want to transfer it to illustrator, just take a pic with your phone in good lighting and use that. Wait, what program are you using? If it's illustrator, look up tutorials on the mesh grid. That's the way to get colors to blend into each other. Otherwise you could go into another program like photoshop and edit it there."
DigitalPainting,3chbbc,AddictivePotential,2,Wed Jul 8 10:32:51 2015 UTC,"I'm using inkscape, the open source cheapskate equivalent of illustrator.

DigitalPainting,3ccwz4,Polypeptide,1 point,Mon Jul 6 22:55:08 2015 UTC,"I'm by no means an expert, so feel free to disregard my advice, but I think for something like this, you might want to try to start experimenting with perspective. Given the right amount of perspective, you can give the spaceship a feeling of ""hugeness"" while also giving the illusion of immensity to the space behind it.  Right now your spaceship doesn't look like it really has a volume. It just looks like a bunch of flat surfaces that are connected with it. With the right perspective it's possible to give the impression that the object has a volume, a mass, a feeling, etc. I encourage you to read about the subject and of course, practice, practice, practice!  Anyway, I hope I'm not being too much of a jerk. Obviously if this is your first ever, it can only get better :)  Good luck"

The hair seems to need some more detail (while the shape is mostly on point) but that is easily fixable. Also, generally, the proportions are slightly off (eyes not the same size or angle).  Nice work though, like what you did with the background.  edit: the shadows are bit too desaturated as well"

DigitalPainting,3c6ou5,arifterdarkly,2,Sun Jul 5 11:02:51 2015 UTC,"well, you didn't really try painting realism. your dA gallery is full of characters with manga sized eyes, long nose bridges, long philtrums and generally cartoony looks. this was just more of that.    when you paint realism you need to really study your reference and always ask yourself if you are painting a symbol of an object, or if you're painting an actual object. when you don't look at the reference and instead guess what's going on, that's when you get these cartoony looks. desaturate both reference and painting and compare the values. the hard shadows you've painted are not in the reference. compare the proportions and angles in the reference with those in the painting - and when you do, paint over and try to fix the mistakes you've made. that is how you learn. if you think eight hours is a long time for a study, think again. keep going until you get it right. if you stop before you get it right, you haven't learned anything."

DigitalPainting,3c5a0f,Demonicblackcat,2,Sat Jul 4 22:46:05 2015 UTC,"I feel like I have to comment on how elongated the neck is. It's distracting from how good the rest is. I'm on mobile so maybe I'm wrong but it looked to me like you had a palette you worked from on the skin, with a highlight color and several darker skin tones falling into purple. And the only place you really varied this was the face when you added some blush. (If you did and i didnt notice, I must have been distracted by the veil) Don't be afraid to add some colors in there that don't naturally occur. In hair, too...you have a very flat progression of values of one color. People always have light reflecting colors on them. It helps to study figures and see this. Being able to capture it adds depth to your painting and makes it appear less flat."
DigitalPainting,3c5a0f,claireballoon,1 point,Sun Jul 5 05:58:30 2015 UTC,"Your comments on colors and the neck is very spot on. thank you, I'll try to add more unnatural colors to make it more alive."

The style is similar to what you're trying to achieve. A little cartoon and exaggerated, but much more depth and rendering. If you don't have access to a figure drawing session, you could try studying some nude photoshoots. You'll see that there are little blips of all sorts of color. Sometimes you can take a photo and use the eye dropper tool to see what diluted colors exist in the skin and exaggerate them. It helps to chose a pose that isn't so flat and  frontal but I think that's part of what you were going for in conjunction with her expression so I didn't say anything originally.   If you need some inspiration and want to study how to use colors in the skin, I think you should check out my figure drawing teacher's page on facebook! Her name is Carol Clark Hammond and she paints in watercolor. She's the one who taught me about this, so maybe you can learn something from studying her work!

DigitalPainting,3c3wzo,HouseOfSoul,5,Sat Jul 4 15:07:26 2015 UTC,"The most important part of your painting should be the initial sketch and proportions. If those are inaccurate, it's still going to look inaccurate no matter how much you render and paint on top.   Most of the other suggestions here focus on process and style. Although it is useful, it doesn't compensate for lack of fundamentals. I suggest focus more on the initial drawing (is her face symmetrical, where's the center line, are her shoulders the same width on both sides?) and do some studies.  Really understand how everything you draw is a three-dimensional form that you're trying to translate onto a two-dimensional plane.  Good luck!"

DigitalPainting,3c3wzo,geft,2,Sat Jul 4 21:49:37 2015 UTC,I would say your lines aren't defined enough. Either go for hard lineart (manga-style) or no lineart at all and let colors define the shapes. It'll also be helpful if your background is not so plain.
DigitalPainting,3c3wzo,geft,2,Sat Jul 4 15:56:25 2015 UTC,"I always start with black lineart, but I always think it looks too harsh, so I make it brown after coloring. I then later merge the lineart layer with the coloring layer, and start coloring again (because I always think the lineart looks too harsh, but maybe I'm blind). At one point the lineart will be almost nonexistent, as you see in my artwork. Should I stop doing that? Thanks for tips!"

DigitalPainting,3c3wzo,mihachris,2,Sun Jul 5 15:59:39 2015 UTC,"i think it looks fine, but definitely try new brushes, or adjust the settings more. sometimes a harder brush will pull the piece together in the beginning. lower the spacing too. if you're going for a painting style, you can select colors as you go to achieve blending tones, instead of only relying on a brush to blend.   i'd suggest using the linework you have here as a basis for flats and painting over it, or using a solid hard brush to make definitive lines and color it in. you can also color hold the lines when you're done, so you keep the outline but it blends more. don't worry about how long it takes for anything; paint until its done and you're satisfied. the quickness comes after you really learn the program and have countless hours drawing."

I started doing art with physical mediums and have always loved the physicality of paint on canvas. There's just something about putting the brush to the canvas that feels good.  I've tried to implement texture into my digital work to replicate that same feeling but I think there's just an inherent difference between digital and acrylics/oils.

I believe what I unconsciously did was see the general direction of the hairs in the reference and then paint small strokes (with some being more toned than the other to set the direction, while the others just to fill in) until it looks full and real.

In the photo there's 6 (three in a cluster and three trailing to the left). I suggest that change because a single light point reflection is pretty uncommon with real people, so it takes me out of the painting a bit. I really like the different with the hair though, the way you realistically twisted it like so is pretty good.  EDIT: I'm still working toward getting good with painting people.

Roberto Ferri, who is the same age as me, funnily enough, painted a poem by Charles Baudelaire, called Sorrows of the moon. it's about - and this is my interpretation - the Moon, in the shape of a beautiful lady, falling asleep and dreaming of a lost lover. she cries a tear and a poet catches the tear and keeps it close to his heart. as for the extra hand in the painting, i have no idea. but Ferri is inspired by the baroque painters of old and they, like their renaissance predecessors very much loved symbolism. so the wings mean something, the extra arm, the white cloth, the feather held down by a stone, all that shit's important.     so lets dive into the third strata of Panofsky's iconology. ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erwin_Panofsky )  the angel with black wings appear to be preventing someone from surfacing, she's holding the person down - like what the rock is doing to the feather. maybe there's a symbolism there of being too controlling or too controlled, if you want something you have to set it free.   the black wings might symbolize imperfection, that this angelic creature isn't as perfect as the world perceives her to be.   but if the rock is chalk stone, symbolizing drawing - 'cuz you can draw with chalk - perhaps it symbolizes the painter Ferri himself and how he himself has been too controlling and not wanting to let go.   the romanesque window is showing us the night outside and possibly a fire with smoke billowing into view. is that perhaps symbolic of a love that never dies, even though it's out of view? the window being romanesque could be symbolic of the heavy and almost unpenetrable wall between us, the viewers, and that love, since romanesque architecture is very solid and serious as opposed to the happier and spiritual gothic.   fuck if i know, though."
DigitalPainting,3brqn0,mythiii,2,Wed Jul 1 16:48:33 2015 UTC,"If you're going to go with the second composition, I would suggest lowering the horizon line and maybe making the dragon a tad bigger.   You want to keep the pose, but I would change it a little. Maybe have him facing the same way as the first composition. I would reccomend looking up references for that sort of pose. Maybe him taking a knee. Or have him using the sword for balance.  Something like that might work since you want to keep the sword in the picture, but you don't want it cutting into the dragon's face since I'm assuming you want that to be a second focal point."
DigitalPainting,3brqn0,Tinyclayforest,2,Wed Jul 1 18:52:22 2015 UTC,"Thank you. I'm with you on everything you've said.   The crux of this whole thing is the sword and it's length. I want to keep it in the shot and I need to keep it relatively close to the same length it is now since this is basically fan-art, and the sword is important.  I'm going to try to do the things that you mentioned with the horizon and scale, also I'll change the way he holds the sword to something similar to the way a cellist holds their instrument.  !!!EDIT: Here is the version with the changes you suggested. Let me know what you think."
DigitalPainting,3brqn0,arifterdarkly,2,Wed Jul 1 20:12:12 2015 UTC,"i would flip him horizontally so that they're not both facing the same way - his leg is mimicking the dragon's head - and to get rid of the tangent with the sword and the dragon's neck, and i'd make the dragon horns longer to avoid the tangent with the neck."
DigitalPainting,3brqn0,arifterdarkly,1 point,Thu Jul 2 10:07:55 2015 UTC,"So by tangent you mean two lines making a triangle? Hadn't thought about that before, I'll do some experimenting.  E: If you wouldn't mind explaining why that's a bad thing, I'm interested to learn."
DigitalPainting,3brqn0,TestingforScience123,2,Thu Jul 2 15:26:35 2015 UTC,"no, a tangent is when to lines meet or run parallel which makes for bad tension in the image. so for example where the sword and dragon neck touch awkwardly instead of overlap or not get in each others' way. same with the horn and the neck.   http://www.ctrlpaint.com/videos/avoiding-visual-tangents better watch this instead, he explains better than me."

If it happens on that computer too (assuming it isn't an Apple computer) it may actually be a hardware issue. If it works fine on your home computer, then your Macbook Pro is the issue.

To an athlete dying young, by A E Housman is what popped into my head when i read the title of your painting.   he is more or less standing on the horizon line. that... that's not accurate. you want something in the foreground, in the middleground and in in the background. you want to lead the viewer's eye, not just in a straight line from left to right but through all the -grounds. i can't find a good landscape by Frazetta, but here http://lcart2.narod.ru/image/fantasy/frank_frazetta/frank_frazetta_themoonmen.jpg look at where the heads are. they form a C. you go from ogre to hero to damsel in distress. even the damsel's and hero's bodies, the wall and ogre head form a C. she's in the foreground, hero in the middle, ogre and wall in the background. it all feels very dynamic."

DigitalPainting,3bprxf,mihachris,3,Wed Jul 1 07:30:09 2015 UTC,"I really like the overall feel and the sky is awesome. I totally agree with what /u/arifterdarkly said. Since you chose though a flat composition there are same stuff you can do to make it look a bit better.  I did a quick and dirty paintover to show you some of the things I'm talking about, hope you don't mind. First, add texture perspective (I'm sure there is a more appropriate term for this) which basically means, the sand (I assumed it was a desert) that is closer has texture in a bigger scale and as it gets further away things get squished and the texture becomes less visible. You can also use distort when free transforming to convey that thing. You could also add slopes and break the perfectly straight horizon line. I also added a light area making it look like something out of camera is there and casting a shadow or something, just to make it more interesting.  The knight on the horizon line makes it look like he is standing on top of the hill and we are looking from the bottom, which I assume that's not the case. Also you should throw in some color to him cause he would never look almost black. Blurred a bit the horizon line because again, the hard edge made it look like a hill.   All in all, you can totally pull off a composition like this but consider adding slopes, diagonals, directional lines and a bit of scale by bringing in the knight closer (which I didn't do cause I suck at characters and it would take me some time to get it right). Try to make your image feel dynamic through the environment even though the actually story may have no action.  Paintover: http://i.imgur.com/B4tXd4p.jpg?2"
DigitalPainting,3bnrfp,acrobaticrabbit,2,Tue Jun 30 18:20:19 2015 UTC,"Wow, this is beautiful! I love the texture and the subtle colors, plus the adorableness. It would be cool to see a few more details, hard edges, and brighter colors on the fox (the focal point) because right now he's not standing out as much as he could be. Also the level of detail on the log doesn't match the level of detail on the fox... it just feels very fuzzy. Hope that helps a bit, keep up the cool work!"

With the driver uninstalled, the cursor is aligned with the tablet perfectly. After installing it seems like only the lower half of the tablet in the center works. I noticed if i disabled all monitors  except my main one, everything is aligned properly.   I'm wondering if I need to use an old driver."
DigitalPainting,3bparu,formicarium,1 point,Wed Jul 1 21:00:04 2015 UTC,"That's really strange, I'm using 7 x64 as well. I would have thought I could reproduce your problem. I'm using what I think is the latest driver as well.  I have sometimes had problems with losing pressure sensitivity, there are various things that have fixed that at different times you might want to try:   go to the device manager and disable all generic 'usb user interface devices' one at a time. Unless they're named in the list, one of these will be your mouse and another the keyboard, so after disabling each check your mouse and keyboard are working. Don't worry - if you do disable one you can then use the other to navigate the menus and enable it again. Remember that one and move on.   Windows 7 installs one of these generic drivers whenever you plug in the tablet, and I've had problems with them interfering before.   go to the UC logic site and try their drivers instead http://www.uc-logic.com/index.php?lang=en&action=support   The digitizer in the 610 is built by them. Before the last Huion update this fixed a problem for me.   Unplug the tablet, uninstall all drivers and reinstall BEFORE plugging the tablet in. This one has not worked for me personally but for a lot of people seems to solve their problems with this model. Contact Huion support. Sometimes they do have some insight. If you do it on their social media like tumblr they will reply very quickly.   Good luck. The good news is when you get this tablet working its really nice to work on, but the drivers are a bitch."

It's not quite right and I can see all the parts I messed up on, but this was my first time doing digital painting in a way that focused on the shapes rather than drawing lines and filling them in and as I said, really bad at drawing people at the best of times.   Also, the point of the exercise was to get it as close as possible in terms of tone, but we weren't allowed to eyedrop off the reference photo.

As far as execution, it would be a really good idea to get some reference for lighting and anatomy in your next piece before you start painting. It's a great idea to start brainstorming by making a drawing without reference to get the idea out of your brain and onto the canvas, but it's so important to then go back and inject the feeling of 'rightness' that can only come from studying real life.

Only when I had figured out everything I jumped in color. Using this pipeline, when you start color you kind of repaint everything again and that is why it took so long.  As for the idea - it came to me suddenly one morning with just a quick doodle. I liked what I imagined and went right into Photoshop, making some linework first.

They're either too red, too yellow, or too blue. i mean, just the first row of google images features all three colour variants. I think you might have picked one with too much red in it. i think this one https://artquoteoftheday.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/john-singer-sargent-lady-agnew-quote.jpg is the ""most correct"" version, but i haven't seen the original. anyway, the redness of her blushing face compared to the rest of the painting is the thing to focus on colour theory-wise. it looks like she's blushing but that's only because the colours around her are so pale. just a tiny drop of red feels like a generous dollop when the surrounding colours are so desaturated.  your version, i can see that you decided to add highlights to her forehead that aren't in the original. yes, there are highlights in the original too, but they are as subtle as a silent fart in a crowded room. i think you worked on her face a bit too long overall, the original is very subtle, soft edges, yours are a little harsh. that's nitpicky, but this is a Sargent master study after all. overall, great job."

The highlights are a bit too strong, and yes, I did work quite a bit on the face. It was actually what took most of my time. I was reading some notes about Sargent the other day, and he was painting the face in a few strokes, being very careful before putting each mark. When I began the study I told myself I would try to be economic with brushstrokes, but yeah that was not the case obviously.

DigitalPainting,3bdrrt,arifterdarkly,4,Sun Jun 28 07:30:04 2015 UTC,"alright then. i tend to draw circles to mark where the fingers attach to the hand, instead of squares. my hand sketches are very David Finch-ian but his hooks and barbs are usually gone by the time my painting is complete."
DigitalPainting,3bbtf4,mightbeajedi,2,Sat Jun 27 18:48:26 2015 UTC,"Good sense of light and colour. You're drawing more than painting. It's not good to make all of those little sketchy lines when trying to paint. Use a larger brush and colour the same area in one or two strokes instead of 30. It will increase your productivity and give your work a cleaner, yet looser look."
DigitalPainting,3bbtf4,ghostdate,1 point,Sat Jun 27 23:37:25 2015 UTC,"thank you, yeah I tried blocking stuff in with the big brush and couldn't really get a texture I liked. I installed a brush pack for photoshop and now I have too many that it's hard to tell them apart. The sketchy lines were made after at an attempt to make the skin look somewhat coarse or rough. I will keep trying tho. Thanks."
DigitalPainting,3bbtf4,ghostdate,1 point,Sun Jun 28 14:08:32 2015 UTC,"For rough skin textures you can use the chalk brush. It looks like a wide rectangle with the upper-right corner dissolving into tiny spots. It's the best for adding some easy texture to to things, and it's a good all-around sketching brush."
DigitalPainting,3bbtf4,FlashBangSilence,2,Sun Jun 28 19:06:53 2015 UTC,"Yaas, its pretty decent.   The most common mistake which people do is that they use the borders. What I mean is that the rhino has outlines, dark outlines. That doesn't help the rhino to look all natural and stuff but rather makes it look as if the picture is from a coloring book(?).  Also, you've used something close to rich black. Rich black doesn't exist in nature, neither does it exist in shadow. Just use a dark dark dark brown / violet / blue etc instead of black. Makes it more believable."
DigitalPainting,3bbtf4,ComteBilou,1 point,Sat Jun 27 23:55:19 2015 UTC,Yeah that's a problem I've been struggling with. I often use those rich blacks just to block in and forget to alter them. Same with my outlines. I always struggle and make it look like some sort of cut out or crop without the black lines. I've seen people use lightining colors like whiteish and yellow or blueish white to made those outlines but it never looks right when I attempt it. I will keep trying tho. Thanks for the advice.

DigitalPainting,3b6o7v,geft,3,Fri Jun 26 12:11:35 2015 UTC,"http://i.imgur.com/yLy1c3l.jpg  the bright light behind her in your image is 99% white. that's only 1% darker than the sun. you can't have that as a secondary light. in the photo she is standing in front of a white background and gets bounce light from it, which is stupid but fine. but you can't just add a sun behind her and expect the light to be the same as in the original.   you can see that i started by liquify-fix her ear, her chin, her left cheek and neckline. i gave her right cheek some shadow and also gave her a lower eyelid. she was still too bright so i darkened the entire image, went back and lit the areas of her face that needed highlights - chin, cheek, nose, hair.   in your image, her eyes are the same white value. but one eye is in shadow and needed to be darker. right eye also needed to be larger and i gave her a slight squint, which is very Swift-esque. she does look like she is just about to impersonate a squirrel, miss Swift.    and after looking at your entire gallery, i think this is a great example of what happens when you trace photos for a long time and then decide to give it up. it didn't teach you how to to observe your subject and now you're paying for it, by painting symbolically instead of what is actually there. don't trace again, dude. put the work in instead. yeah, it takes a longer time but it pays off."
DigitalPainting,3b6o7v,arifterdarkly,1 point,Fri Jun 26 14:43:21 2015 UTC,"Wow, many thanks for the detailed response. Will take some time to absorb your comments. I know values are still a big weakness for me.  So do you suggest to have the reference on the side instead of tracing it? Because I sure can't remember her face without one.  Also, is there any way I can fix the hair? Painting hair seems really difficult without having to draw individual strands."
DigitalPainting,3b6o7v,arifterdarkly,2,Fri Jun 26 14:53:19 2015 UTC,"yeah, keep it off to the side. it takes a bit longer since you have to spend time looking at the reference, but you'll benefit from it in the long run. after doing a bunch of those  http://ienkub.deviantart.com/art/Ray-Stevenson-progress-pic-425757614 and http://ienkub.deviantart.com/art/Monochrome-face-progress-335493312  being the only two i have progress pics for, i had learned how to look at a subject. my paintover of your taylor swift took 20 minutes, because i could see the problems right away. it might have taken me longer to find the original photo than to do the actual paintover.   i've only ever seen three kinds of people trace photos: beginner painters, preschoolers, and 15 year olds. what do they have in common? they don't care about learning, they just want it to be pretty.   anyway, when you're doing doing studies like that from reference, you should move on to learning the planes of the head - google planar head - and when you've got a good grasp of the planes of the head, do studies of noses, eyes, ears, necks, shoulders, mouths, to understand how they work. and don't bother with colour! only work from grayscale photos and only work in grayscale. you'll learn faster that way."

DigitalPainting,3azkqw,laralrl,3,Wed Jun 24 19:43:42 2015 UTC,"Hi! I'm not sure if you want any critique since you haven't stated so but I hope you are ok with it since you're posting it :p    So first thing is, technically (this is gonna sound a bit pretentious since it's about terminology so sorry but I have a point later on, trust me) a study is something you do to get better at special aspects or concepts in art. This normally means that unless you are studying details (or maybe photo realism) you'd never really do a ""finished"" piece, since normally you really shouldn't care about details when doing studies. What I'm trying to say is that your piece is more finished than what a study should be, that means it's more of a finished piece than just a study.    Studies are done this way (without much detail), so that these bigger aspects of the picture (such as composition, anatomy, values, color, etc) can be learnt thoroughly without really having to finish the piece each time you want to practice.    As a side note, looking at other pictures you've uploaded, I'd guess that you are trying to get quite a realistic touch to your pictures and that you mostly work from references. And I'm guessing the portrait you just posted is not from reference. Because of this, and what I said above (i.e. don't care about detail when doing studies), you should try to study depth and form and incorporate it into your art, when you are not drawing from reference.    Here comes what I'd work on if I where to ""improve"" your piece. 2 major things stand out:     The nostrils look flat, as if they where just two lines on the underside of an otherwise smooth surface, sort of. The volume is lacking on the cheeks too. So my tip would be, study volume (I've seen too little volume in some of your other paintings too). The other thing, which could be up to style, but then again I feel I should mention since I think everybody should get real anatomy first, before going for specific styles, is that her eyelids are a bit too rounded. It's quite subtle, but real eyelids are less ""almond shaped"" and rather more faceted. See this video on sort of what I mean. Anything too round will just look a bit unnatural, sort of.   Other than that, the skin rendering is rather good though as above the ""outer"" side of the face lacks volume, and the hair looks good even though the rendering is more stylized than realistic but that is up to style.   I sincerely hope you don't take this the wrong way. I'm only being nit-picky because I see that you could become a really good artist. Cheers! A lot of your other posts have been really good too :)    TL;DR - Quite good but what I would want to get better at, if I were you, would be volume and some finishing details on anatomy, more specifically the eyes in this picture. (And sorry for the wall of text)  Edited: for readability."

Maybe it looks closer to the camera than her nose. If the highlight wasn't so sharp I think it would sit in the picture at the correct depth.
DigitalPainting,3ayna9,C_Morzy,8,Wed Jun 24 15:39:16 2015 UTC,I feel like it lacks texture. Too slick. Were you using the default PS brush?
DigitalPainting,3ayna9,mmasonghi,2,Wed Jun 24 16:55:53 2015 UTC,"As I said, it's my first ""serious"" digital painting, and first overall when it comes to humans and face.  What I think made it lack texture was that I drew it in grayscale at first. Of course, being me, I accidentally was too precise and drew very smooth gradients.  Instead of bulky/imperfect brush strokes I go over and over with low opacity and carefully shade it. I think it is the most apparent on the helmet which is supposed to be a leathery surface but instead comes off as matte plastic.  Edit: I used the default PS chalk brush thinking that it would do just that  Edit #2: Just sketched this, does it come at least closer?"
DigitalPainting,3ayna9,mmasonghi,1 point,Wed Jun 24 18:34:45 2015 UTC,Your sketch has a little more texture but I think it still feels default brush-y. Try watching some YouTube tutorials or try replicating how you would paint in reality.

Layers of small blots for the petals was fun and came out kind of nice (stippling, sort of). I'm having difficulty getting the...texture?...right, trying to make it look a little less digital. I imagine I could easy fix that with a little Googling but mostly I'm just enjoying the process of discovering things by accident."

DigitalPainting,3aty57,purpleoctopi,2,Tue Jun 23 14:11:41 2015 UTC,i love the pciture and ive been experimenting with grey scale and then coloring  like this .  what would everyone say is the pro and cons of this way?  any tips?  short cuts? question is it easier  to split it into multiple layers in coloring in?
DigitalPainting,3aty57,superkewnst,6,Tue Jun 23 16:56:41 2015 UTC,"Thanks, glad you like it :) I didn't use to draw in grayscale at first but I have to say I prefer it now. For me, it's easier to adjust values, details and just draw the finished painting when there are no colours involved. In my experience I found it to be harder to change stuff once you've added colours because you gotta make sure all the values and colours make sense, while in grayscale it doesn't matter because you only have so few shades to work with.  Marc Brunet aka cubebrush talks about this in this video, it's essentially my process and he explains the benefits of the different steps so it makes sense. It's a long video but I highly recommend it :)  Edit: Forgot to explain how I do it, but after I've done everything in grayscale I use colour balance (shadows, midtones and highlights) to play around with. Then I add base colours on top on overlay layers and then once I'm happy with the colours I go over everything and paint details and stuff :)"

DigitalPainting,3aukjg,Noerbrau,5,Tue Jun 23 17:03:07 2015 UTC,"Nice progress right there. My main suggestion would be to work traditionally only with line. I think you are giving yourself a hard time by trying to throw in values. It seems to me like you don't focus enough on the drawing. I've been there (and still kinda are), the stage where you are just starting out with the tablet and you want to make all this cool stuff you've seen people do. Sure you can even skip the drawing stage but after you've reached a level that you are comfortable with lineart and you know you can do without it.   Right now, drawing will help you a lot to see shapes as they are. You can only paint as good as you draw. Before you make a stroke, analyze your reference, pay attention to relationships and think. Try to achieve accurate proportions by measuring visually distances and remembering them, then drawing on paper. Faces are very hard, don't bother that much with likeness at this stage. You can also through some value in a pencil or pen sketch by just blocking in the main shadow area. Use only two values to describe light side and shadow side and later on you can expand your value range.  And remember 1 month is SUCH a small period of time. Keep at it and you'll see progress. Eventually things will start to click.   Good luck!"
DigitalPainting,3aukjg,mihachris,3,Tue Jun 23 22:24:29 2015 UTC,"Thank you for taking the time to answer ! I really like your submissions. I actually started doing exactly what you are saying before seeing your answer, so I added some stuff to the album, it will be updated progressively.   It's hard to find the boundary between light and shade, as drawn here. I tend to just indicate the volumes with cross hatching so far...  The reason why I concentrated on likeness is that I didn't want to acquire bad habits and draw all eyes the same way and not be able to undo it later. In that aspect, I think it helped me to realize I needed to understand the underlying shapes and planes to render each feature faithfully. But at the moment I'll just focus on big shapes and go in detail later as you say :)"
DigitalPainting,3aukjg,mihachris,3,Wed Jun 24 00:35:23 2015 UTC,"Well, yeah, to find the shadow sides you also need to know structure of the face and the planes. However, you can try to find images with nice direct lighting and hard cast shadows, so things are more clear and you can feel the volume of the head better.  As far as likeness is concerned, you are doing a great job trying to see the shapes, that's the right way to go. My point was, try to draw a face that looks good but don't get attached to a the ref in terms of likeness so that you try to get it 100% accurate. Our brain is so familiar with faces that even slight changes can mess the likeness. You will develop that with time, but for now concetrate on getting shapes and proportions right.  Also, one thing I forgot in my previous post; try to be more fluid with your lines. Don't make scratchy, slow lines but try to build up confidence. I know it's very hard to do that, I'm struggling a lot myself. Just try to keep that in mind.  Keep ti up! :)"
DigitalPainting,3aukjg,mihachris,2,Wed Jun 24 08:06:08 2015 UTC,"Ok, not concentrating on the likeness so far. Drawing smooth lines is very difficult indeed, I've always drawn from the wrist and never shook  off the bad habit. And my tablet is really small. Maybe now is a good time to practice drawing circle and lines :)"
DigitalPainting,3aukjg,jewelsteel,2,Wed Jun 24 08:21:30 2015 UTC,"That's why it's recommended to do these things traditionally, cause you add a whole new level of diffculty. It's pretty hard to work smoothly in a small tablet. Remember though, observe more, draw less!"

DigitalPainting,3aqk03,redwood36,3,Mon Jun 22 18:22:50 2015 UTC,"ThereIsNoJustice is definitely right. Make sure Transfer is off and also make sure ""Always use pressure for opacity"" is off. THEN use the opacity percentage to control the opacity of your brush. This way, the opacity of your brush is set and so long as you don't lift your pen it stays the same (it will layer once you lift). When you use transfer and opacity by pressure it is hard to keep it consistent in a single stroke.   Here is an image to show you everything. Hope this helps!"

DigitalPainting,3aqk03,ThereIsNoJustice,3,Thu Jun 25 04:32:07 2015 UTC,Turn off transfer under brush settings. You'll only get the one tone you picked from the color picker/canvas/etc.   Edit: Or just deal with it: http://enliighten.com/blog/opacity-jitter-overlapping-brushstrokes/

DigitalPainting,3amcgw,purpleoctopi,6,Sun Jun 21 17:12:22 2015 UTC,"The lower half of the pieces light rays seem a bit too strong, and the fish could use just a little stronger highlight for reflection with darkening the undersides.

The piece looks amazing, and you don't even realize how excited I am to see it fully colored. Keep up the creativity!"

DigitalPainting,3amcgw,nickbernstein,2,Sun Jun 21 21:40:03 2015 UTC,"I would darken the hands, because they currently conflict with the face as the primary focus. Also, the fish in the bottom become a bit repetitive due to the consistency in size. I would add some more depth by having some closer to the viewer, and some closer to the subject, allowing you to vary the sizes. You could also have some of the fish swimming towards the subject. Drop the brightness of the highlights everywhere except the face and the area immediately surrounding it. Also, smaller nose and bigger lips, and softer jaw = more feminine (conventionally).

DigitalPainting,3alpox,jewelsteel,2,Sun Jun 21 20:28:09 2015 UTC,"I LOVE the grass, and the lighting, though I think you need some kind of visual element to explain the sudden shift in lighting.  Your anatomy needs work though. Most of the body landmarks are rendered, but you  are missing a few, which has lead to an oversimplification of the form. Simply put, you softened all the edges of various anatomical elements like the shoulder and clavicle, as well as the muscles masses and recesses, so that they 'blend' into each-other. This results in a figure that looks like it has a construction of... something underneath its skin- not muscle and bone. Take a look at Noah Bradleys figure paintings, and compare his renderings to yours. Yes, there is a massive skill difference between him and you, but comparing his paintings to yours will help you understand."

DigitalPainting,3alpox,deitery,1 point,Fri Jun 26 19:42:45 2015 UTC,"I can relate, I just recently painted my first full-colored picture and wanted ethereal wings there.

For once, I know that those wings I made I haven't seen anywhere else. It's important for me, because it's my original book and the wings are symbolic.

For wings, I just needed the basic anatomy/ wing structure and a hint at what black feathers would look like under certain lighting. I totally guarantee thay you won't find the same wings I painted. :)  As for the happy accident for your wings. Have you ever experimented with different brushes? I usually have a horrible time painting grass the way I want, but downloading different brush packs and messing around helped me find something that worked."

DigitalPainting,3aglje,GoogaNautGod,2,Sat Jun 20 11:45:08 2015 UTC,"Thanks a lot!  No this was all done from imagination. I had nothing particular in mind, just started throwing in some colors and trying to find shapes, then this came up. I rarely work like this but it's a very good practice to vary methods and techniques."
DigitalPainting,3aglje,geoman2k,1 point,Sat Jun 20 11:50:01 2015 UTC,"Would you have any tips or insight for working like this?   I'm a little unhappy with the style, flatness and neatness of my current work."
DigitalPainting,3aglje,geoman2k,2,Sat Jun 20 11:52:29 2015 UTC,"First of all, you have to accept and convince yourself that this won't come magically but through practice. How much, noone can tell because it varies, but it will eventually come. Meanwhile learn to enjoy the process (yes, it can be learned trust me).  This is not bad at all. I really like the sky and the cube like structure rendering. The main problem though, is the fact that the structure seems to float, like having no connection with the surroundings at all. If it was indeed intented to hover above the forest, then drop a shadow underneath to clarify that. Also, atmospheric perspective, which is essentially fog, is a really easy way to separate things or push them back, and better convey depth. You've got that far in the distance, but there should be some in the middleground too.  Composition is also flat. You lack foreground right here, and there is nothing interesting going on. Horizon at the middle cutting the image in half, cube is almost at the center. You need some leading lines to your focal point, some variation that will make the image look more dynamic.  This is a deforestation machine right? I struggled to understand that in the beginning. The ground in front should have some texture to indicate that trees have been destroyed and stuff. Also the forest is flat too, like all the tree tops are on the same plane, a solid flat mass which extends to the horizon. You need some variety in there too.  Sorry if it came out a bit harsh, I just critiqued how I would like to be critiqued, nitpicking everything so I know what to work on. I think this is solid, your rendering skills are good and with a bit of thought and better understanding you can solve most of these problems. Just try to study stuff and think hard about them when analyzing. Do the same for your paintings.  Cheers!"

DigitalPainting,3aemx0,jewelsteel,2,Sat Jun 20 05:32:47 2015 UTC,"Really nice lighting! The metals are rendered nicely as well. Your gradients are really nice too. A bit jelly at your compositional skill..   My main gripe is that some of the costume volumes are not correct. It looks like you planned the line art and composition, and then jumped into coloring, without building the form in 3D. Because of that, your forms look incorrect, even with your wonderful lighting and rendering. A good example would be her left hand as u/arifterdarkly pointed out, but its also in the costume elements. They are flush with her hand! The form was sacrificed in those places, and from there you can see other areas where the volumes weren't fully planned out.  Heres an example from a project Im working on, Heres the full figure before any Volume Construction, Heres the figure after some Volume Construction  I spent a few hours building the green and orange wire-frame around JUST THE FOOT to accurately plan out the costume. I spent the same amount of time on building just the wire-frame each part of the armor, not including the material rending, to render it as accurately as possible. I know its hours of tedious construction, but it really will push your skills to the next level."
DigitalPainting,3aemx0,arifterdarkly,2,Sat Jun 20 06:42:03 2015 UTC,"Hey thanks for the critique! That's very helpful - I am planning on revisiting this piece this week to fix the geometry, as you pointed out. A lot of the metallic pieces kept changing as I painted it, so I'm not surprised some of it ended up amorphic or inaccurate, haha.  Thanks again!"
DigitalPainting,3aemx0,frenchpisser,2,Mon Jun 22 04:41:25 2015 UTC,"my main problem is the shading of her chin and neck, there are no cast shadows on her neck, but instead it looks like she's got remnants of line art on her chin. the light doesn't know where it's coming from, is it above her or right in front of her or slightly below her.   her left arm and hand (our right) is my other problem. the palm is too long, it looks like there might be more than one reference there, one with the index finger pointing up and one where it's curled. that arm is very curvy and round, which gels badly with the other arm that is very straight.   other than that i think it looks great."

DigitalPainting,3afovs,Riptide_,1 point,Fri Jun 19 23:53:49 2015 UTC,"I love your style! The expression on her face is very telling.   The first things that popped out to me were your colours and your shadows. The lights and textures are great, but I might do some more experimenting with the shadows. There are a couple of places where you use sheer black when something less dark would suffice. There are other places where you could use darker tones and bring more contrast to the woman's surroundings - the bottles and stuff on the table would be a great place to add more shadows.   That being said, you're a much better colourer than I, and I love how you textured the walls/bottles.   Just some first observations - hope it helps!"

DigitalPainting,3abxjm,ingenious28,2,Thu Jun 18 23:34:44 2015 UTC,"Wow nice work. Did you use a special brush? It actually looks like a graphite drawing in a lot of spots.  Some areas you need to work on are her lower jaw and neck. There is definitely an issue with perspective on the jaw and the shading is odd, her face looks extra wide as a result. Her neck seems chunky but after looking at your reference photo both of those things seem to be apparent in that picture as well. The jaw still does look a bit weird though, I think the cheek bone is causing a shadow that you made a little too soft. Maybe try experimenting with adding some noise for shading.  If you did use an irregular brush would you mind sharing its name?"
DigitalPainting,3abxjm,stGrumbles,1 point,Fri Jun 19 03:07:06 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the feedback. I actually just used a chalk brush for this painting and i really enjoyed the texture and feel of it.

DigitalPainting,3adl8b,genmills,1 point,Fri Jun 19 06:37:32 2015 UTC,"Considering this is my 3rd painting, I think I'm starting to get the hang of layering lots of colors to help make an image pop more.  However, I still have a loooong ways to go.  Next up I want to learn to make the shape of clouds look much more like clouds, and I'd like to learn how to draw rock textures.  Since everything needs work, what is your opinion on what to add to the learning pipeline?  Also, any tips for how to properly use brushes?  I feel like anytime I'm working on coloring an area the overlapping of brush strokes makes it look super streaky.  Almost like it was colored with a marker.  When I watch other digital painters it appears that their brush strokes almost behave like paint in that it blends very well.  I'm using GIMP but I'm assuming many things are similar to PS."
DigitalPainting,3ab61a,Craption,3,Thu Jun 18 17:57:40 2015 UTC,"Edge control and contours need a lot of work here. In a lot of masters work they have deliberately hard and soft edges. Doing your best to replicate their edge work can really help understand how they push form. Around his shoulders this is most apparent. You can see on the left it's a very soft yet visible edge, it's not quite a lost edge. Then on the right it's a much harder edge. I would suggest that you work with a hard brush first and map out values and contours. As far as values go you did a pretty good job and spending more time would have been beneficial for cleaner shading. The beautiful thing about master studies is you don't need to spend 10+ hours creating a perfect replica to learn. Another thing you want to do with hair is have your strokes run along the form. The bottom right of the hair the stroke marks make the form a bit confusing."

DigitalPainting,3ab61a,Padawanbater,3,Thu Jun 18 17:58:59 2015 UTC,"if you want a polished render, you shouldn't have studied Sargent, the most brush stroke economical painter ever! i imagine him laughing at the Mona Lis, going ""sfumato is bollocks"" under his breath. but since we can see both his and your brush strokes, compare how he paints hair to how you paint hair. your strokes are very rigid and straight, his are fluid and curvy. when you study Sargent, you need to study his brush strokes - very often you see where they start and where they end - and imagine how he held and moved the brush. try to imitate his arm movement. if you mess up, undo and do it again until you get the right stroke."

DigitalPainting,3a8qqc,thefrdeal,12,Thu Jun 18 03:02:22 2015 UTC,"reading the full rules of the contest leaves me slightly bewildered.   ""By submitting a piece of artwork to the contest, you give me full rights to redistribute and re-purpose your art for the game's marketing, etc.""  firstly, the language here is extremely vague and whenever legal jargon is vague i get the feeling it's on purpose. i mean, not even Blizzard want exclusive rights to their fanart contest submissions. but basically, the winning submission will get $50 and in return you'll get this vaguely worded ""full rights"" to it. the artwork could end up being the official box cover or steam cover or some other central piece of marketing and man alive, that's daylight robbery.   there's also no deadline for the contest, so you could potentially use the artwork submitted for a very long time without having to pay anyone.   i'm also pretty sure you are not a nefarious overlord trying to rob artists! but there are red flags in the contest rules."
DigitalPainting,3a8qqc,arifterdarkly,0,Thu Jun 18 06:06:25 2015 UTC,The reason I'm putting money into the contest is so that I can get some art for marketing and promotion.   And as mentioned in the rules the deadline is July 15th.  Not trying to rob you guys at all! You don't need to put in the effort of a $100 commission or anything. I'm just looking to get some fun art for my game since I suck at drawing!  Let me know if you have any more questions -WD
DigitalPainting,3a8qqc,arifterdarkly,2,Thu Jun 18 15:47:37 2015 UTC,"well, the deadline for submissions is set, but not a date when the contest will end. potentially we could be voting for months afterwards. but that doesn't matter because as soon as we submit the artwork, you have full rights to it. it's not just the winning submission you have full rights to, it's all of them. so if you get four great pieces, you only have to pay for three of them.   blizzard asks for non-exclusive rights, but since you've said ""full rights"" that means exclusive rights to publish and distribute, which means i can't even use the art in my portfolio.    it's probably not what you had in mind, but since i've written contracts and i do read the full rules to contests to see if artists get stitched up, these are the things i notice. the language has to be clear as an ice diamond! there can be no confusion over what rights you want, what rights the artist keeps, all the deadlines have to be in there.   i imagine /u/FirebladePrez or /u/Uncomfortable or /u/Jaasif or me, to name but four professional artists in r/digitalpainting, could take this on as an actual $100 commission, though. spending $100 on working with the artist to get one great piece of art might be a better alternative, even if it wouldn't be exclusive rights for that kind of money."
DigitalPainting,3a8qqc,Uncomfortable,2,Thu Jun 18 16:31:05 2015 UTC,"That kind of makes me curious. How often do you do non-exclusive work? Do you feel it gives you a significant benefit to withhold those rights? Do you actually get many requests for the ability to purchase a piece of yours after the fact, or do you primarily do it as a favour for a client to bring down the cost?  I don't often find myself considering the exclusivity of the rights being a significant factor, since the work is usually tailored quite specifically for one client's needs. That leads me to look at pricing in a sort of hourly breakdown - where a hundred dollars might get anywhere between 2-4 hours of work. At most, enough for a rough colour comp, but nowhere near enough for a finished, polished piece.  Then again, I don't bother with commissions often - my last one negotiated me down from $400 for one to $600 for two, and I ended up putting faaaar more hours into it than I should have relative to what I was being paid. $400-500 would have made more sense for a single piece.  Man, freelancing makes me sad.  Edit: On a side note, /u/thefrdeal - your game looks pretty awesome! Nice work with the art style, it's simple but endearing."

DigitalPainting,3a35mz,80vain08,2,Tue Jun 16 21:26:12 2015 UTC,"It's always bugged me how when an artist creates something eccentric or surreal many people always jump to the conclusion that drugs are involved.   To be honest that always struck me as insulting to say, it implies the creator isn't creative enough so they have to use drugs to compinsate."
DigitalPainting,3a35mz,bro9000,1 point,Wed Jun 17 02:44:57 2015 UTC,"There's some patterns and designs that are commonly the result of certain kinds of drug use. For example some people use a lot of tiny geometric patterns, mostly diamonds. I usually associate this with psychedelic mushroom use. LSD users often have a lot of spiral patterns overlaid on faces and objects, often painted in bright colours. I think all drugs, even caffeine and tobacco will have small effects on your work. I know when I smoked and drank coffee, I used a lot of short lines and my work felt very agitated. I quit both and then my work got a less agitated, but it still felt stressed. Anti-anxiety drugs resulted in me working in more rounder, organic shapes and lines. Marijuana was mostly just idea based changes, rather than stylistic changes.   Idk, long story short, drugs definitely have effects on people's work and they're generally pretty identifiable. Assuming that eccentric art is necessarily drugs is pretty silly, as many artists are just naturally eccentric in their thinking."

Yes, worksheets are included and I know that just watching countless hours of videos without applying what your learning and actually drawing will not make you go from horrible stick figures to FZD graduate. I just feel for 55 dollars their should have been a little more insight into what im actually receiving with the purchase. Yes, I could have torrented the exact same pack that I got (I actually started the torrent) and came the conclusion that since I HAVE learned so much from Matt Khor over the years that ""Hey I could atleast show the man some love and spend 55 bucks with him instead of pirating it"". I just feel that the store part is a little misleading, He should atleast specify exactly what your getting (videos/exercises/demos) in the description. Either way it was 55 bucks well spent cause there is quite a bit of material thats not included in the freebies, I just felt a little mislead once I completed it all."

It might be worth playing with subduing the shirt a bit and trying to find a balance.  In addition the hand construction is not very good. Your face anatomy and construction is fairly solid in comparison so you may want to do a bunch of hand studies, especially in regards to their construction and proportion."
DigitalPainting,39xvkx,schroder999,2,Mon Jun 15 19:02:30 2015 UTC,"It looks really good, I mean that.  Especially the hair and eyes and especially for a beginner (definitely not your first piece I imagine).  One thing that could use some improvement is the lips. The way the top lip is pulled up seems a little unnatural, as I would expect more angled curvature where her finger is.    Her shirt collar on the left has a bit of an awkward curvature as well.  Specifically the top black line could be smoother.  Keep up the good work."

DigitalPainting,39xvkx,agroupoforphans,1 point,Mon Jun 15 22:42:47 2015 UTC,"Lip pull looks unrealistic, hand looks too masculine (wrinkles and thickness of fingers and shape and thickness of nails), other than that nothing else seemed off at first glance. You draw way better than I do."
DigitalPainting,39xvkx,scribbling_des,1 point,Mon Jun 15 19:29:44 2015 UTC,"I agree with what was said about the contrast of the shirt.  Not only is the eye drawn there, where you don't want it drawn, but it looks very unfinished.  Now, leaving something like that with an unfinished feel is completely fine, as long as they aren't the first thing you see.  You want it to fade, like an afterthought, not be super noticeable.   Also, watch your ""brush""  strokes.  I don't know what program you're using, so I can't give specific advice on how to remedy it, but thoughout the face and neck you can see strokes that are very uniform in size and direction.  This isn't something you want.  It distracts from the strong parts of the piece, like the shirt.  It looks unnatural."
DigitalPainting,39xvkx,middlegray,1 point,Mon Jun 15 22:18:58 2015 UTC,"Really great.  Hard to say without being able to see the reference, but the part where her pinky connects to the palm of her hand, her ear, and her upper lip look less realistic and much more awkward than the rest of her.  Her sleeve as well, but lots of people make non-face parts intentionally less realistic in drawings so it doesn't bother me.  But the ear/pinky/lip doesn't look intentional.  I really like that there are visible, subtle brushstrokes radiating out from one of her eyes.  That's really beautiful.  Most of it is extremely realistic and you can definitely recognize the actress.  Since I can't see the reference, I can't give you specific advice (like ""make this part darker/brighter/higher/lower,"" etc.) but based on the rest of the picture it seems you have the skill and eye to draw those parts out to be more three-d and realistic just by giving them a little TLC."

I'm not brilliant at digital art but I've seen on videos that you should be able to completely remove the line art unless your using a comic book or cartoon style."

I was never able to create anything original very well, though (even these 2 here are copies of stuff I found online).  Anyway, I got a hankerin' to get back into drawing so I picked up an Intuos Pen and Touch tablet today and I'm using it with GIMP.  I want to keep learning by finding good paintings to copy as I learn the techniques for digital art, it's a little tough getting used to this medium!  Anyone have suggestions for stuff to copy to learn to draw people or characters?  The main thing that made me want to start again was looking at the art for ""Darkest Dungeon.""  I would love to create/copy paintings in that style!  Also, I noticed after just these 2 drawings the nib on my stylus is slightly worn down already!  I adjusted the sensitivity now so I don't have to press as hard, but that makes it very difficult to get all of the ""in-between"" pressures.  Are these nibs replaceable?  And if so how do I swap this one out?  Thanks!  edit:  I'd also love to get some great brushes for GIMP, I notice all of the more skilled painters have great brushes that make a big difference in acquiring certain looks."
DigitalPainting,39r4pe,arifterdarkly,3,Sat Jun 13 23:11:04 2015 UTC,"if you want to learn how to draw people you need to learn anatomy and portraiture.   anatomy involves everything from the proportions of the body and the head to how muscles connect and how the body moves. you learn by doing studies of photos (poses, closeups) by finding and drawing medical diagrams of the skeleton and muscles, by doing studies of hands and feet, etc.   portraiture involves learning the planes (and the proportions) of the head, paintings lots of portraits from reference.   most importantly, though, you need to understand light and shadow. i'm looking at your examples and it doesn't look like you do. here's a good place to start https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0q-LZVFZuGE&list=PLV2X3tgajVlHkH3FHxm3rLZWqScFTRhtv"

DigitalPainting,39n9pg,colbehr,4,Fri Jun 12 23:23:29 2015 UTC,"I've had my surface pro 3 for about a year now, and I'd have to say it's one of the best tech purchases I've made. So much so that it's replaced my desktop as my main digital painting tool. It runs software like art rage, Corel painter, and manga studio fine, though you would most likely need to have a look at using an up-to-date version of the respective software to avoid scaling issues. The stylus itself feels great, and the pressure range, while small, is incredibly responsive. My qualms with it, though, are the buttons, which are flush with the stylus, and the upper button on top of the pen's 'cap'. It's used to open one note, but, being brought up on Wacom, I had to get over not having an eraser and get used to making more use of hotkeys.  Outside the art-side of things, I'd like to warn you that the digital keyboard isn't as responsive as you might expect, and without the benefit of autocorrect it can be frustrating to try to type anything lengthy. Thankfully keyboards and other peripherals are easy to come by. All the additional equipment for my surface was about fifty dollars, all told. It's lacking in USB ports, so a USB...bus?...thing is a must if you're interested in using wired accessories.  Let me know if I can answer any other questions you might have about the Surface, I'll do my best to answer them!"
DigitalPainting,39n9pg,Misappropriated,2,Sat Jun 13 03:16:56 2015 UTC,"The button on the side of the stylus closest to the tip is the eraser button. I've also read that some people have overridden the top button with custom script, but haven't tried it myself yet."
DigitalPainting,39n9pg,cajolerisms,4,Sat Jun 13 04:10:32 2015 UTC,"Personally I'm a big fan of my Surface Pro 3 (running largish files on Photoshop CC on the i5 processor without any problems). Before, I had a Wacom which was ok, but I disliked the disconnect between my hand the the drawing surface, and that I was stuck to a desk. The Surface allows for more creative freedom, I can fold up in a comfortable position anywhere and draw very easily.  The downside is the lack of customization with the stylus, and lack of tilt input like Wacom styluses (stylii?). Googling hasn't helped, or else I'm dinged in the head and someone please save me from myself.   Since there are no programmable buttons on the stylus, and I don't like being tied to the desk and keyboard, I'm currently messing around with a cheap USB numpad and Autohotkey to program my most frequently used shortcuts, which seems like a pretty common workaround. Otherwise I rearranged my Photoshop workspace a little so I'd have to move around the screen less and it's been fine when I'm not using the keyboard.   If you research online, there's a fair amount of talk about the quality of the pen nib, and that it's pretty soft and wears down quickly, but you can get free replacements by contacting Microsoft customer service. I noticed the stylus that came packaged with the Surface had a very soft, flexible tip and was wearing down the same afternoon I was using it, and kept wearing down until it was entirely flat at the tip. However, I'd also roughly manhandled the cap when checking the battery and stripped the threads so it got completely stuck halfway unscrewed. Long story short, I got a replacement from Microsoft and the new stylus has a much firmer tip that hasn't worn down after a couple of weeks of heavy use, so maybe they transitioned over to different nibs and the soft ones aren't a problem at all anymore.   In any case, despite the lack of tilt and buttons, I'm still using my Surface a lot more than I did with my Wacom. It's just great to be able to treat it like a sketchbook and work in a more natural way wherever I am."

For the Surface Pro 3, it's compatible according to the hardware check utility, but when trying to run the driver, an error pops up saying it doesn't detect a compatible tablet.  Googling around, all the talk around this driver seems to be for other brands of tablet PCs and the Surface Pro models using Wacom technology (1 and 2, but not 3).   You can adjust pressure sensitivity pretty well without an additional driver. I haven't noticed a practicable difference between sensitivity on the SP3 compared to my old setup with a Wacom tablet."

I based my brush on these by FunkeyMonkey.  Traditional painters use color palettes not because it makes painting easier, but because it's necessary for getting paint onto the brush. When working digitally there's hardly any need for it unless you're doing cartoons and need colors to match from drawing to drawing.  You could have used a much larger brush size for the forehead and cheek areas to soften the skin.  Every subject has both a darkest and lightest area, knowing where these parts are before beginning will help you create a more pleasing design.

If you wanna do digital work then a drawing tablet is necessary, and that one is about as good a tablet as you can get currently.   However, its quality does not translate to the quality of your works.

It is more likely it will do the opposite, and actually make you forget practice the fundamentals (talking from personal experience here). Just don't ever forget to nail down those basics, they gonna help sooo much.  Concerning the tablet type, I have heard of pros who jumped from an Intuos to a Cintiq and they actually didn't quite like it. But most people never get back. It's just a preference and the differences shouldn't be huge.  All in all, it all comes down to you realizing it's nothing more than just a tool and you shouldn't be concerned about stuff like this. Just make sure you are practicing the right things, and above all HAVE FUN!  Good luck! Hope to see you posting some stuff here."

It's suggested by the way the mountains are drawn that this is a large picture, showing a huge area rather than the more random, rocky appearance a mountain range would have if you were looking at it with the scale of the person.  I like that you showed atmospheric perspective in the mountains though. When looking at it in the thumbnail, I can clearly see less contrast as my eye moves along the mountain range.  My suggestion to would be to study some mountains, draw them in a sketchbook or something. Just practice their forms, don't worry about color. Once you establish a good visual library, you can create your own mountains that look pretty dang real if you're not zooming it (which you shouldn't be, the goal is to make a good composition rather than worry about details). Once you've looked at some rocks, some mountains, plants, trees and whatever else you want to feed your visual library, you can worry about studying value.  The only warm color I see in your piece is that ominous red light even though the rest of the seen is well lit. Generally, the best work is achieved when warm tones are used for highlights and cool tones for shadows (you can switch that around if you want to be fancy but I don't often try). My point is that there should be warm, natural tones in the mountain, it shouldn't be all cool.  Keep practicing! And don't be afraid to spend some time with your work once in a while. I know everyone likes those speedpaints but if they're all you do, you'll find yourself upon a plateau.  This is my da: http://solfour.deviantart.com . If you check out the gallery folder ""old work"", you'll see how utterly terrible I was. I still have a long (long, long, long) way to go, but practice works very well.  If you know Noah Bradley, you should check out his early works.. they're pretty terrible and give a lot of encouragement!"

In your painting, the huge contrast makes it look like her skin has weird massive open pores. One eyebrow is also noticeably longer than the other. But other than that, this painting is fantastic.

I slacked on the hair and clothes, but would love to hear advice there as I consider them my weakest areas. Right now, I'm mainly working on reading and interpreting colors, and on getting my values down while working in color. I'm also continuing to study the human face and body for nuances of form.

It's subtle language like this that divides us and reiterates this notion that nonwhite = atypical/subpar.    Edit:  Wow, 7 upvotes.  I've been saying shit like this on reddit for years, and despite everything going on politically on reddit, in the US, and in the world, I personally see a consistent (if slow, and meandering) pattern of people opening their minds to empathy and seeing how we, as the human race, can improve in our ability to be kind and loving toward one another.  Maybe I'm being a bit grandiose but this exact comment would have gotten nothing but downvotes even 1.5 years ago.  I see people engaging more and more in conversations about race, and that means quite a lot to me.  That's all."

DigitalPainting,39cxx9,Deckurr,2,Thu Jun 11 13:21:54 2015 UTC,"Why is making a ""divide"" bad? We are different people and making the distinction is not always racist or bad."
DigitalPainting,39cxx9,middlegray,1 point,Thu Jun 11 10:10:11 2015 UTC,Well when the divide is normal vs not ....
DigitalPainting,39cxx9,Richard70nl,5,Thu Jun 11 12:48:19 2015 UTC,"Exactly.  You'd be shocked how many times white friends have accidentally said things to me like, ""You're pretty for an Asian girl,"" ""well you have Asian eyes, I have normal eyes.""  Or hearing things like, ""He's the smartest black kid in our grade,"" etc.  Whereas if I/other kid were both white, people would simply tell us, ""You're pretty.  You have normal eyes for a human being.  You are smart.""  The subtle language really fucks us up.  So much of our language is tied to VERY SUBTLE negative connotations of race...  There's that study of black students who were given an IQ test, and a different group who were given an IQ test that asked the students to self-identify their race before answering any questions.  Students who were forced to write, ""I am black/African-American"" before answering questions scored a hugeeeee amount lower than black students of the same academic level who didn't have to bring attention to their race first.  It's a difficult conversation to have because whenever you call someone out, they feel personally affronted as if they're being accused of being racist.  No, our culture is racist, and it's up to all of us to work together to climb out of this shit.  Language is very subtle, and you're right, most people who use it the way OP did don't mean it in a racist way at all-- and commenting that way doesn't make someone a racist... but I strongly believe it needs to be called out because subtle linguistic implications build up and add to a subconscious feeling of white=normal=good, everything else = different/wrong/abnormal, and when you feel someone is different/wrong/abnormal, it becomes much, much, much easier to lose your empathy for them."
DigitalPainting,39cxx9,middlegray,-1,Thu Jun 11 13:14:04 2015 UTC,"Your arguments would stand out in the examples you have given. Still, non of it applies to this title given.

And wouldn't it sound strange to your ears to hear a painting titled ""White man with glasses"" or whatever?   In all honesty, no it wouldn't sound strange at all. If that is the title that an artist uses to identify it's painting then it make sense to me if it is a ""white man with glasses"".

I agree that the shadow of the glasses adds a three-dimensionality, and I also agree that the detailing in the chin is a bit over-exaggerated.  The painting doesn't look exactly like the person in the photo, but, I think it holds its own as an example of a really beautiful, realistic-yet-stylized example of what digital painting can do.

Try /r/ArtFundamentals, hammer out the basics, then move on to learning digital painting. Also since you're interested in character art, read some Andrew Loomis."
DigitalPainting,39dfgz,SoraXes,0,Thu Jun 11 15:36:37 2015 UTC,You seem to have a good basis of drawing. Perhaps invest in a wacom tablet

DigitalPainting,39baxq,purpleoctopi,2,Wed Jun 10 16:26:02 2015 UTC,"Cool piece! I'm really digging the textures you used.  I'm curious, how is this art piece relative to Kintsugi? I'm sure you have a cool interpretation and I'd like to hear your take on it"
DigitalPainting,39baxq,imagination_pulp,3,Wed Jun 10 18:04:46 2015 UTC,"Thanks a lot, glad you like it :)  It's kinda boring and personal, but basically I feel like I was in broken pieces about a year ago, a complete mess. A few months ago I ended  a relationship and since then I've had to rebuild myself and I feel that I am stronger than ever and that I am my best version. It made me think of Kintsugi, that I'm not throwing away what's broken, I'm rebuilding myself and making me better. Hope that makes sense.  For the artwork, I think of it as the skull is the death of my ""old"" me (pre-break up) and the gold is like the tears/pain/struggles I had to go through, and now I'm learning from it and rebuilding myself using it.  Kind of, sounds pretty weird when I put it into words lol :< I've always loved Kintsugi, for the philosophy behind it but also the actual object that's been repaired with the gold."
DigitalPainting,39baxq,imagination_pulp,2,Wed Jun 10 18:25:42 2015 UTC,"Wow thank you. No, when you put it into words it made it even better.

I'd suggest that you try to get the shapes and details right (you're apple's shape is a bit off, and you barely included any details on the skin and leaf). General rule of thumb: the more time you spend on your paintings the better they will look."

DigitalPainting,399poh,catSaysMeh,2,Wed Jun 10 19:54:37 2015 UTC,"Just pick some different colours - lighter ones on the leaf, darker ones on the apple -and go over it again. If you're using a programme where you can use layers, making a new one for things like this can be helpful, because mistakes won't ruin the rest of your drawing this way and they're easier to correct.

DigitalPainting,3947u8,Qaki,2,Tue Jun 9 03:33:59 2015 UTC,Very helpful stuff! What is the purpose of turning the line into multiply layer?
DigitalPainting,3947u8,Qaki,1 point,Tue Jun 9 18:55:11 2015 UTC,"In this case it doesn't actually provide any noticeable benefits other then making the line darker and clearer when painting underneath. In other words, the line doesn't blend in to what you are doing underneath because of the multiply effect.  Here's a super quick example of what I mean. Imgur"
DigitalPainting,3947u8,typtyphus,1 point,Thu Jun 11 04:53:01 2015 UTC,"Alright that clears things up. I went into PS to try your method and didn't see a huge difference using multiply or the default. Keep up the good work man, I always look forward to your posts on here!"

Layering lighter leaves on top of a darker mass goes a long way to capture the texture and lighting-patterns of the treetop, so you did really well to identify that approach.  From here, I'd definitely recommend looking into improving some of your drawing skills, focusing on learning how to capture the illusion of three-dimensional form. This will help give your paintings a more solid underlying framework."

DigitalPainting,38zfjo,StayPuftShrimp,2,Mon Jun 8 05:51:37 2015 UTC,"You've got the right idea with some of the lighting, but you definitely need to study landscapes if you want to nail the emotive beauty of a sunset. Things you want to look for are composition, balance, value and lighting. Making cloud forms in the sky, using value to give the appearance of depth (example) http://orig12.deviantart.net/e799/f/2014/116/f/f/out_of_the_woods_by_destinyblue-d7g26my.jpg , notice how the trees receding into the sun get lighter and are almost swallowed by the light, while the closer ones are darker and have more solid forms. Use contrast to make your sun pop since it is the brightest source of light, and keep in mind your grass is not going to be true green, it is going to be affected by the light of the sun, so think more subdued, align it with your color pallet rather than the color you know grass to be, because when certain light hits grass, it is no longer green.  Keep in mind that this all doesn't come at once but you will find yourself improving a little bit every time.   Edit: Also, I find it super helpful to use solid brushes at first,then work on value transitions. This will give you a more painterly style and help you learn and give your painting a tighter look. Relying on the airbrush will only hurt you IMO"

DigitalPainting,38ufkv,dr_rainbow,1 point,Sun Jun 7 12:33:14 2015 UTC,"Lessons 1-2 (the basics) and 3-7 (dynamic sketching) are still strictly ink-only. Lessons 8-13 (figure drawing/anatomy) have always been open to whatever medium suits the artist, and the new illustration lessons will be tailored to be a better fit with digital.  I limit the accepted medium when I believe it has a significant impact on what the students are able to gain from a lesson. I also think it's very important to have some exposure to working in ink specifically (through lessons 1 and 2) because of the effect it has on the student's general mindset."

DigitalPainting,38tm5s,t8ka8r8k,8,Sat Jun 6 18:35:42 2015 UTC,"The hair looks wonderful, that should be your pride and joy of this picture. There are a few issues regarding the right side (her right, viewers left) of her nose, chin, and neck. The nose needs the shadow blending a little more to have a nice brush gradient. The chin just needs to be cut down into a smoother, more straight line. Between the shoulder, and where the neck meet the jaw needs to be a much smoother, curved line. These things are noticeable, but super easy to fix when you notice them. When you fix those little issues this painting will shine in your portfolio. Great job, it's a wonderful piece you should be proud of."
DigitalPainting,38tm5s,Usuallymisspelled,4,Sat Jun 6 19:44:16 2015 UTC,"The shadow under the nose suggests a strong light coming from above her, but the rest her face suggests it is head on. Keep in mind the planes of the face and the directions they point; if the light is coing down from above, it would be lit more like this: http://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2013/04/facemorph-0b.jpg  You can see there are shadows under the cheeks towards the side of the face, it generally looks like a triangle of shadow, if that makes sense. Also there would be shadows under the brow and eyes.   I can see that you have attempted the bounce light on her jaw line, which is a good start, but it should be more subtle, it would not be as or more intense as the main light.  Do lots more studies, use reference a lot, this will help you build up a visual library of the way things should look; proportions, lighting, etc.  All that said, it is nicely composed and the hair does look pretty good as the other guy said! Keep practicing!  Also, I find the video for the picture I've linked above usful for lighting reference, just keep in mind the intensity of the light source and the ambient light and stuff.

DigitalPainting,38rdrs,arifterdarkly,1 point,Sat Jun 6 12:22:25 2015 UTC,"The absolute biggest cause of muddy colours is low brush opacity. You end up with subtle value changes where they should be sudden, and a broad range of ambiguous tones between your major palette values with little to no control over saturation. If you are picking from the mixed values on the cavas as well as using low opacity, that is pretty much the most muddy thing you can do.  Up your opacity - it's difficult, but don't let yourself mask that difficulty by using low opacity because you won't get the same gains from the practice.  Sorry if the crit is a bit brutal, your stuff is good and I'm just saying what I think you need to change to improve."

Do people come to you and tell you what they want, or just say they need a poster and give you the freedom to come up with something? How long does it usually take for you to create the designs/illustrations for each poster, from start to finish?"
DigitalPainting,38k4mh,Qminus,7,Thu Jun 4 19:31:57 2015 UTC,"i'm not the OP, but i can tell you that, for me, the more specific the client is, the better it usually goes. i did twenty initial concepts for my latest client, trying to gauge what they wanted. stage two was them picking four and me doing another eight concepts based on those four. and so on. the whittling down is just time consuming. it's a lot quicker if they client comes to me and say ""we're seeing the sexy ass of the protagonist in the foreground and then a dude with two swords coming at her."" that only requires three or four initial sketches. the client picks one, i go to work."
DigitalPainting,38k4mh,arifterdarkly,5,Thu Jun 4 20:11:33 2015 UTC,I can see what you are saying but I was given no direction for all of these. To be honest I like that a lot better. In cases like these I think one head works better that two for the concept/style/composition. Otherwise it feels like Its getting pulled in a few different directions. That being said having some ones input after the fact is absolutely necessary. I had some criticism on the tame impala one specifically that was hard to hear but it was completely true and the poster benefited from it a lot.   These do take a while but they are all different. The Alt-J one only took about a weekend. But The Tame Impala took about a month but there was a lot of learn with that specific poster.

But it is all geometrical shapes like spheres and cylinders and tweaks on those shapes. You have to get used to just drawing anatomy in shapes until you get used to it. It's all practice.  The torso was too long in my opinion. But I drew this over yours and made some corrections and then I drew some face shapes at the top. Left to right is me working out the structures and then toning them down you have to think of it all in a 3d aspect. Are his elbows behind  his body, is his chest out or down. The real problem I see is that it just looks a little flat. And the guy is right cubes is where you start with 3d getting the feel for perspective and shading  http://imgur.com/PKlmDnC"

The cintiq companion is pretty much the only thing that's going to work as a full quality digital art tablet. I've seen some people use the surface, and it's not much better than the iPad as far as sensitivity goes. Might have the advantage of using photoshop, while iPads are stuck with sketchbook pro and procreate (not 100% sure though, surface might be limited to AppStore stuff as well) It will work for piddling around and doodling, but if you're wanting something you can do serious work on, I think the cintiq companion is the only really quality tablet PC at the moment."

DigitalPainting,38ge4u,bpadventures,1 point,Thu Jun 4 15:42:41 2015 UTC,"I find it easier to work in black and white first. I put a multiply layer on and chose bright red and bright blue on their own seperate layers and tweaked the hue and saturation to make it more orange and less saturated. Then another multiply layer to lay down the spiderweb loosely with a dark red and a new layer for white highlights and the eyes and detail. Imo your laying out too much detail to quick. I'd take longer getting the values in black and white and save the detail for last. But that's my method and isn't how everyone does it, just what works for me. I study Arnold for bulky characters and mr Olympia physique competitors for lean. It's good references to learn anatomy. But there's thousands of resources. I studied a little of da Vinci work to find out whew muscles insert so the forearms and biceps not hitting right and delta and cheat bugged me a little. But that's nit picking. Spider-Man has to be lean or you piss people off, I've experienced this myself. You can make him super ripped and more muscles than usual but you put him on a bulk and he'll look like he took some time off. Always gotta give him huge delts and forearms, cuz thats what he uses the most. The crotch was a little high and his thigh gap being right under his dick bugged me. But overall your doing good. Keep up the good work! Keep practicing save the picture and rework it in a year or two on top of this one to see how much you can improve your own work. You'd be surprised how much easier it is to correct something than it is to make it from scratch which is why all these drawings subs have lurkers like me who wanna help someone out. I'm not saying your better than me. We've all picked up different things and can give everyone pointers. Someone could probably even do the same to my edited picture and say what I could have done instead. With art, all criticism can be constructive.   http://imgur.com/gYu9y67"

DigitalPainting,38foi0,F4cele55,3,Wed Jun 3 22:18:55 2015 UTC,"You requested crits, so I'll try to offer something helpful. You pointed out you were specifically working on the metal texture; Congrats! I think that was the best part. It had a really nice galvanized metal/steel feel that evoked the material, not just some flat color. Nice work.  If there's an area I would suggest working on, it's your anatomy. In particular, the neck/shoulder area and front hand are areas you might want to revisit. That front hand looks very small, especially for a fist covered in bulky armor. Try holding your hand up to your face in the mirror, and look at the ratios.   Right now, that front hand looks very, very small. The widest part of his fist is thinner than his elbow would be, which looks a little wonky. For example, open, a character's hand (the distance between thumb and pinky) should be about the same width as his head, straight on. Just the palm should be ""about"" a quarter the size of the head. A closed fist bulked up in armor would be a little bit bigger. Look at the ration of the head to the arm, and the arm to the hand. The forearm should be roughly as long as the head is tall, and about 3 palms from elbow to wrist.   Counting and measuring those ratios within your drawings will help a lot. Foreshortening and perspective mess with all of those, of course, but it can be really helpful to double check your work if your hand is in front of your head in space, and it's much smaller...something's probably not right. And you're working in photoshop, so don't fear the lasso tool! If you realize you messed up, chop his hand off, rotate it, scale it, and then repaint the seams. And if it doesn't work...undo is magical. Keep arting!"
DigitalPainting,38foi0,Sometimesummoner,1 point,Thu Jun 4 05:05:10 2015 UTC,I agree with what's been said here. The small size of the hand jumps out at me right away. But good job on the shading!

DigitalPainting,38ez6g,Nighzmarquls,2,Wed Jun 3 19:46:00 2015 UTC,"I have a great deal of trouble with sketching in traditional linework so I tend to do volume studies, the process for developing this character in design went like this:   Initial anatomy decisions and volume sketch Mucking around with how I wanted to do the anatomy of the shoulders Initial Color exploration and palette choosing with a pose Picking a palette and experimenting with pattern and lighting Character near final pose sans clothing (NSFW I guess)   And then the final image.  I'm working on improving my aesthetic appeal, dynamism and compositions in general but also curious if there are pointers to improve my process. I really REALLY can't get my head wrapped around line work style sketching, so if anyone has input on how to develop composition if you prefer working in volumes/chunks of color I'd love to hear it."
DigitalPainting,38ez6g,ghostdate,3,Wed Jun 3 19:52:15 2015 UTC,"I can't wrap my head around why you're using such a horrible brush and not using any of the pressure sensitivity functions for opacity or size. You may as well be doing your designs in MSpaint for Windows95. In your colour palette image, you clearly have some familiarity with using other brushes, so why are you painting in a hard square brush with no opacity or size changes? You don't need to use both, but you should be using one or the other to either blend or refine tighter shapes, respectively. You're also not cleaning up your designs at all, which is really terrible. Would you hand that off to a client? If you would, then you really need to re-evaluate your work, but I think we both know you can clean that up a lot more. Go clean it up and when you're happy with it, then bring it back.  As for sketching, do it however works for you. Volume sketches are good, line sketches are good. Mixing them is good. The point is to get a semblance of what your design is supposed to look like."

Follow the contours with your strokes, like you're painting a sculpture.

I would cut a horizontal portion of the center of the face out as it is rather long.  Usually ears start lower than on the face, if you look at the relation of them to the nose and eyes on your own face it will help with placing them. Spend more time on the eyes,  adding shadows and creases. People always notice eyes so if you can get those really detailed the rest will not need much retouching.

You could add red reflected light from the hair onto the clothing and face, as bright as it is right now, it would be reflecting an intense amount of light."
DigitalPainting,38aewn,mokitodoki,2,Tue Jun 2 22:51:31 2015 UTC,"Check out some of the work by Tyler Creates Worlds http://tylercreatesworlds.deviantart.com/art/Echoes-of-the-Void-2-405457371 Observe and attempt to replicate, even if you think its not good, try to see how he does it, mess with hard and soft edges on clouds, try some simple paintings of clouds/ skys before you start messing with vibrant sunsets/galaxies"
DigitalPainting,38aewn,StayPuftShrimp,1 point,Wed Jun 3 01:38:41 2015 UTC,"Alright, good idea."
DigitalPainting,38aewn,oceana1009,2,Wed Jun 3 16:22:35 2015 UTC,"For starters, each of these images were made in slightly different ways, and none of these are 100% digital painting. Even though they all have painted elements, they are all so seamless because they are combination digital manipulations and paintings that were made to look more or less painted.  The first one has either a 3D render or a photo as its base layer. The way the separate layers of clouds overlap, either multiple photo references were used or painted over. The perspective on the clouds doesn't quite match up in the different kinds of clouds.  The second one is a drawing on top of a painting of a photo, possibly a photo collage to get that two layers of clouds, plus the sun at an angle.  Third, the train is a 3d model, the backdrop is like a NASA photo (perhaps just tweaked and not even painted), the figures and grass added separately.  Fourth is a cel shaded or vector art cityscape that has been gradient blended into a photo sky backdrop, that might either be a painting from a starry space photo or just a tweaked color photo. Again, the figure is the only completely drawn part.  Last one is a drawing that has been colored. Background is painted over photo. Effects like sparkles and glows on another layer. Probably a separate layer for the soft moonlight airbrushing."

DigitalPainting,38aewn,oceana1009,2,Wed Jun 3 16:54:04 2015 UTC,"Anyway the point is there isn't one single way of making this sort of art. And lacking visible brushstrokes doesn't mean anything, anything that is blended and detailed and uses lighting skillfully will not look painted by a brush. Study the consistency of lighting and (more or less) skillful use of perspective. That these artworks all have a high blending of elements in a realistic way isn't what's important. The key elements of any painting is still here, which is to say, how the picture is composed (shapes, perspective, and flow), striking amount of dark vs. light, and good attention to rendering form and details in the right amount. Special effects and gradients and painting glows are all well and good, but that's just the showy frosting on the cake.  Art tutorial website (in japanese but just use translate) that shows how to use layers and digital effects for that modern anime style."

DigitalPainting,3872si,mythiii,2,Tue Jun 2 14:25:43 2015 UTC,"Thank you! i was actually trying to imitate Ruan Jia's style but it does have a similar effect of Ilya Kushinov's style.  I started my painting with little contrast in graphical value in black and white and wherever there was a clear distinction in value I would blend it a little ( eg background to hair value, hair to face value). Afterwards I would just splash color on it with a color layer and then bring the correct colors of the skin, hair etc out on top of that layer.   It was pretty fun!"
DigitalPainting,3872si,mythiii,1 point,Tue Jun 2 21:41:15 2015 UTC,"I'll be honest and say I didn't fully understand.   So you started in black and white, added random splashes on a color layer and then made another color layer on top of it, with the skin color on that top layer?  Also I noticed the color splotches are mostly in the dark areas which I'm guessing you did on purpose."

The latter seems reasonably close, except for the hair, which is a tad light. Brushwork is a little undisciplined; it may seem erratic in the original, but you'll notice they all follow the contours of the form, and only start to flatten out around the lower half (though they still serve to express the underlying planes and structures even then). The forms you have here are very flat, especially around the eyes, muzzle, neck junctures and the planes of the cheek."

DigitalPainting,386nt7,Mac_fan,2,Tue Jun 2 06:03:02 2015 UTC,"Cintiqs are wonderful if you have the budget for them. I used to work with one at a place I worked, and got to live out a fantasy for a few months insofar as painting was concerned. I've been told the Huion provides a reasonable alternative for a lower price, but don't take my word for it; I haven't used one.   If you're just starting out, but are serious about painting digitally, and feel like you want to make paintings that involve a measure of brush sensitivity, I'd advise getting an Intuos, not a manga/bamboo one. The latter are fine for graphic work and simple photo manipulation, but tend to fall short of what I've desired in the experience of painting itself. It's very much a preference however, because it depends on how you work and what you work on, and you'll likely find a myriad of varied responses on the matter. My advice would be to find a store that will let you try it, and if they have a Cintiq you can try, try it, if for nothing else but to set a baseline of what you feel you need to achieve your painting goals.   Size-wise, when I first started out, I was lucky - got a hand-me-down intuos 2 from a neighbour, but it was a massive A3-sized thing. I struggled with the size, because you're sitting down a lot of the time when you're painting digitally, unlike in traditional media where you have the option to work from a distance, and your arm makes smaller movements. If you aren't going for the tablet monitors, a small one, like a 13"" may be sufficient. You'll be surprised how easily the mind translates the process of coordination, and you'll be able to accomplish a fair amount with something about as small as a size you're comfortable with when sketching on the move.   You may also want to consider the difference between pressure sensitivity and angle tilt sensitivity. I don't know if all the new Intuoses have both now, but I find the tilt to be much harder to mimic than pressure. Between canvas tilting and brush options, it's manageable, albeit something to get used to.   Some tablets come with free software, some don't, some at times and others another. Keep an eye out for promotions.   PS: Cintiq Companions sound wonderful too, but consider your budget, and how they may integrate with new software. I don't know how well the second generation handles, but I found the first iteration of the product to be clunk, laggy, and massively overpriced compared to, say, a Surface Pro."
DigitalPainting,386nt7,athies612,2,Tue Jun 2 13:05:36 2015 UTC,"Wow thanks for such a detailed response! Unfortunately since I'm just a student there's no way that I can afford a Cintiq one, although they do look nice. I know there's an intous one that does have Art Rage which looks like it might be a good option for me. Obviously though it's not set in stone yet. What is the difference between pressure sensitivity and angle tilt sensitivity? How do they affect your work? Where can I find out what software come pre-installed on the ones that do come with free software?"
DigitalPainting,386nt7,athies612,1 point,Tue Jun 2 13:54:21 2015 UTC,"Essensitally, stock options, pressure sensitivity controls opacity, and tilt sensitivity controls the angle of the brush stroke, both will help you control edges in your paintings in a more intuitive manner.   Most of the brushes you'll find in digital painting programs like artrage, photoshop, and painter, will have an assortment of fully round brushes and some that are at an angle, like a a flat, or a filbert. these can be used with a reasonable amount of sophistication through a combination of savy and ingenuity. For example, there are many ways you can simulate angle tilts to your brush, one of which is pretty straight forward if you can make your own brushes - simply make a stock angled brush and repeat it in a variety of angles that you need, making a separate brush for each variation, then page through them which you're painting through hotkeys while you're painting. This can be said for many other functions that a good tablet will provide for. The tablet simply helps make the entire process a lot more intuitive.   The difference between pressure and tilt however, burns down to this. Almost every wacom comes with pressure sensitivity, I'm not sure if they all come with tilt, and though you can assign brushes to simulate tilt sensitivity in a brush, it isn't very intuitive, plus you lose the option to utility pressure for pressure (though that can be simulated through other means as well.)  For an extreme, consider Bob Staake. I don't know what he's using these days, but I remember reading an interview once that suggested he worked with a mouse on photoshop 3, or something, which was around the time when a lot of people were using 5 or the first creative suite, But he works primarily with paths and textures, so it works for his process."

DigitalPainting,37o6q6,silverskull39,3,Fri May 29 12:26:25 2015 UTC,"Alright, the first two frames with the lit candle are good, so ill start with the third one where hes putting out the candle. His hand is too light, the moon/stars alone shouldnt be bright enough to light his hand that much where they dont directly hit. Desaturate a bit and darken. I would leave the rim light, and then just enough brightness to see the details of the hand.  This carries over into the last panel. The window frame seems to be lit up even though its on the opposite side from the moon. Put a bit of that rim lighting around the edges, then desaturate and darken again. Same for the bushes outside, unless you want another light source on them they should be almost black. Look out your window at night and see how the darkness affects trees. Dont forget the moth. Darkness desaturates colors (pushes them towards the black and white and grey region) and pushes them towards black a little (dont overdo it). the last thing is the moon. Its the light source, but it seems flat and dim. Id take the same color of your rim lighting and apply it to the moon with maybe 50% opacity or so. Dont get rid of the details, but wash them out a bit with the light to make it match the color of the light you already have it casting."

So, areas I struggled with: The perspective on the figures really had me banging my head against the wall. Especially the helmet/visor on the right one, I'd wanted them to be looking down at something but I had to just fight with the perspective endlessly so that it didn't look all noodly.   The grass is a unique challenge that I'm not entirely familiar with. I put a lot of it in there partly to mask the fact that I'm bad at drawing legs/feet, which helped me with the lower body parts of the robots/spacemen/whatever. I tried to look at lots of references on painting grass, and didn't want to make the mistake I'd made in earlier paintings of trying to draw every individual blade of grass.   I really like how the clouds came out, actually! I worked a lot on them and did tons of revisions, but I like how simple they ended up looking with the rim lighting.   Composition wise I struggled a lot with this. I had a lot more in the painting originally, trees on both sides, more mountains, more clouds, a moon-- but it was just too busy. I ended up cutting a lot of it down, which overall I think helped, but I'm not sure if it ended up working too well.  Painting in this style was difficult! I'm used to a much more unrefined 'technique' with painting-- just sloppy blending and texturing. With this I tried to be really careful with my shading and texture, but I definitely have a ton to learn still. Just hoping anyone else can help point out areas where I really screwed up (and hopefully with a suggestion or two on what I could improve!)  Thanks a lot guys!"

DigitalPainting,37ltuy,Wuzseen,3,Fri May 29 05:53:19 2015 UTC,"I love the world you have painted. The stylised look is amazing. I think you characters need a little bit more dynamic range in their values. Some more extreme lighting, right now they are very soft and flat compared to the world."
DigitalPainting,37ltuy,bhdp_23,6,Thu May 28 21:42:41 2015 UTC,"http://i.imgur.com/GSGUL19.jpg this painting is very analogous. all the colours are warm. but warm light means cool shadows. i used the sponge tool to just desaturate the trees to make them more blue.   the glowies are in evenly spaced lines, which is very annoying. it's natural for us to space them out evenly when we paint, we like symmetry. but it's bad and makes it look static instead of organic. avoid the evenly spaced anythings from now on! also, use different sizes to show depth and scale.   you've got some very large areas of nothingness too, the space for rent-sign for example. this composition could have been much tighter, the right stump could for example be in front of the two dudes to give the painting more immediate foreground elements. right below the rent-sign there is a weird dip in the mountain and the grass, making mountain and grass line up as if they're following each other for no good reason. the grass should extend behind the tree stump.  i also darkened the figures' right sides. the side facing away from the light source will not be that bright. think of a cube. light falls on one side, the side facing away from the light will be darker. shrunk their heads too, they were comically large.    and the clouds... it looks to me like the painter really mucked up their perspective or doesn't know how clouds work. yes, we're looking at another world in a galaxy far far away, but there's no reason for the clouds to behave like they do in your image. everything else looks in this image makes me think of Earth - even the glowies could be fireflies - but the clouds are not behaving like they should. there's nothing motivating this weird behavior either, which becomes a big disconnect for me. they are just clouds in the background and in a ""normal"" painting i wouldn't look at them so much as i would sense them - i know what they are, don't need to study them in detail - but here they catch my eye because they behave weirdly.  i think some studies of warm light and cool shadows would do you a lot of good, as well as some more anatomy and aerial perspective studies."
DigitalPainting,37ltuy,Ryan907,4,Thu May 28 18:46:57 2015 UTC,"Thanks a lot for the feedback!   One area I was really cautious about was the dark side of the figures. In the past I've definitely gone overboard in making areas too dark (and received a lot of feedback calling out how diffuse light should behave,) but it seems I've moved the needle too far to the other side now.   I honestly know next to nothing about color theory, so I appreciate any sort of feedback and direction for that too. For a long time I would simply do outline sketches of things in black and white, so color remains an incredibly new frontier for me.   Definitely appreciate what you said about the clouds, too. Painting clouds in a three dimensional way is still a challenge to me, and I think I handicapped myself too much by playing into my weaknesses.   Make no mistake, there are a lot of shortcomings that I can see in this-- but after having spent so much time with it I mostly wanted to get it to a place where I could ""finish"" it and move on to something else, I definitely didn't want to abandon it.   Thanks again, I'll be definitely referencing your feedback on this as I move forward."

DigitalPainting,37ltuy,aesu,1 point,Thu May 28 19:27:31 2015 UTC,The aesthetic is gorgeous. and the color palette services the tone pretty well. I've been playing a lot of the Witcher 3 recently and it reminds me quite a bit of that game's aesthetic.  The bright sun draws the eye and that large area is probably the least interesting part of the painting. The glowing particles that wave in front of everything is a pretty nice touch and even the leaves on the saplings in the bottom left have a lot of lovoe put into them.  The characters have a neat design--I'd be curious to see what inspired that. The character on the right seems a bit more solid/proportional. The left character's right arm in particular seems just a bit off.  I think the skyline is fantastic and is a great backdrop. I'm not sure if the focal point critique is really an issue but it might be worth taking another look at it.

DigitalPainting,37htch,The_HoodooOperator,4,Wed May 27 19:08:35 2015 UTC,"You approach your paintings weirdly. Is there a reason why you start with a ton of tiny marks and then smudge everything? Generally people block I with large brushes and work progressively smaller as they tighten and refine details. It would probably save you a lot of time to just block with a big brush instead of using a tiny brush to make a bunch of tiny marks. Your end result seems to turn out rather fuzzy looking. Sometimes you need to hard brush for a hard edge instead softness all over, you know?"
DigitalPainting,37htch,ghostdate,3,Thu May 28 00:38:02 2015 UTC,"Well it looks pretty awesome to me!   I imagine he did start off with bigger blotches then refined the details, with a smaller and smaller brush.  I'm loving his style either way"
DigitalPainting,37htch,imagination_pulp,3,Thu May 28 02:06:56 2015 UTC,"No, he blocks in with a tiny brush. You can see in this and the other painting he posted, it looks like he blocks in on top of a photo using tiny brushes then smudges it with a soft brush on the smudging or blurring tool."

DigitalPainting,37htch,ghostdate,1 point,Thu May 28 07:41:46 2015 UTC,"Oh, I don't paint over a photo, the white gaps are there because I'm lazy and normally blend over the colours later to fill in the gaps.

DigitalPainting,37kioy,mythiii,1 point,Thu May 28 08:14:38 2015 UTC,You should google up some reference images you like and try to copy those. A lot of the proportions need fixing (mainly head size is too big) and using a ref would help. Also when the two feet are right next to each other there shouldn't be a noticeable size difference like there is now.  For the part about the lines you should tell us what program you are using and if you are using a drawing pad or not.   Just general things would be to use long brush strokes and a hard brush with pressure set to line width.
DigitalPainting,37i1q0,Equinya,2,Wed May 27 20:04:16 2015 UTC,"Why go for the square crop? Did you try a wide crop that includes her hands but cuts off the top and bottom of the dial? Her fingers help sell the perspective and also let our eyes explore the image. Without the fingers it feels cramped and the only place to look is her face.  The use of light and color is effective, but the intensity of the light should drop off as objects get further away from the light source. The red light on her face and chest should be weaker compared to her hands.  Edit: I just noticed you said the icon on the robe is emitting light, which makes my last statement a bit redundant. Since the light source is directly facing the camera, then it should be considerably brighter than the surrounding objects. It doesn't mean you need to make the icon brighter, it could mean darkening her robe and face."
DigitalPainting,37i1q0,postpics,1 point,Thu May 28 04:35:00 2015 UTC,"I cropped it in that way because it was at the outer edge of the dial, any further and it would show the black on the outer edge. I wasn't sure it was much better than just showing the whole circle, since the comparatively smaller black rim on the outside seemed distracting. Perhaps adding more to the dial would help?  The picture is so dark already, so I'm hesitant to make it even darker, but I think I'll try to play around a bit more- maybe I can strike a better balance than what I've got going now."

DigitalPainting,37e5h2,arifterdarkly,0,Wed May 27 06:08:11 2015 UTC,"first of all, those gifs were traced. tracing isn't hard, which is why kids in elementary school does it. skill level 7-15y/o is not what you want to aim for.  as for references, here are a few to get you started http://faestock.deviantart.com/gallery/?q=face+reference&offset=72 and http://robynrose.deviantart.com/gallery/29112759/Portraits-and-Headshots  and this is a video i did on painting from reference https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWUwAp4OCbA  and here is my first study from a photo http://ienkub.deviantart.com/art/Monochrome-face-progress-335493312  lets start with the study. as you can see, i'm blocking in the big shapes first. i've got a general head shape, crooked and bent but workable. i'm just trying to find the light and the shadow. you can see on the left of her nose it's extra dark - the TERMINATOR line, or core shadow - you see the highlights and middle values. pics two and three are me refining that general shape with a regular hard round brush and a regular soft round brush, using the lasso tool to move shit around. THE BIG THING in pic 4 is the eyes. the eyes in pic 3 didn't look right so i just filled the whole thing with gray and painted them again from scratch. THAT IS IMPORTANT! repaint shit you're not happy with! don't go ""meh"", do it again and do it better. it will 1) teach you to not settle and 2) build your confidence when you finally get it right and 3) teach you more about all the tools at your disposal. the completed time for this study was 50 hours. that's right, fifty. meticulous is the key word here. the sixth pic in this series is not the final artwork, it's just what i handed in to my teacher at the time. sit down and don't let go until you're finished. you're not on a timer. good is worth more than fast. correct is worth more than fast. you will become fast just by doing lots of paintings. speed is a by-product, not a goal.   second time around http://ienkub.deviantart.com/art/Ray-Stevenson-progress-pic-425757614 i was faster. even though it still took a few days to finish, i knew my way around photoshop a lot better and that reduced the time spent. important to note is that there are no outlines of anything anywhere. it's just blocks of colour that i mold and scratch at until they make sense. whyyyy, you wonder. because it's too easy to get married to those lines and stick to them even when they're wrong. you control the painting, not the other way around.   the video shows some of the techniques i used in the images above. it's not the same brush, but other than that it's pretty much the exact same. and the reference i used in the video is the lovely faestock i linked in the beginning.   you are not at a stage in your development where you need to think about secondary lighting. learn the tools, learn the basics, then learn the more advanced stuff. when the time comes! watch this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxbK-PBXyWM  does that answer your questions?"

I guess that like for everything else, you need practice to be able to see mistakes. I'll work on it. Thanks a lot !   EDIT : are you sure the link I sent is traced ? To me it looks like the main features may be traced but the shading is not. I think the guy wanted to focus on the volumes."

Question:  The candle is inside a bedroom, at night, with the window open. The windows is on the left side of the candle. On next frames, the candle will be put out and the light will get a blueish color.  In this frame, with the candle burning, should I put a blueish light coming from the left side? what you guys think?"
DigitalPainting,379xg6,silverskull39,1 point,Tue May 26 01:47:30 2015 UTC,"Yes you should add the light from the window: light is additive, having another light doesnt cancel out the first one.   also, either pay a bit more attention to where your light will fall, or simplify your lighting a bit more. On the dripping wax youve got light on the bottom of the drops, which is wrong. It would actually be on the middle/top of the drops and fade out over the rounded bottom as it falls into shadow. You might get some reflected light off the tray, but not that much and youd have a brighter highlight on the top of the drop.  But, since its a comic, you can get away with a lot of simplifying in the name of speed. In this case, id let my linework define the minutiae of my forms and just do the radial glow and highlight the large surfaces where the light hits (top of candle, rim of tray) and not bother with the smaller ones like the dripping wax. It doesnt look as pretty as properly rendered lighting, but its a trade off to be able to work quicker. The important thing in comics with lighting is to create atmosphere, rather than to be technically correct."

DigitalPainting,3736jh,Tinyclayforest,2,Sun May 24 17:44:22 2015 UTC,"I think it would benefit from some darker values. It's a good  start, but from the waist down, looks pretty flat.  I agree with adrifterdarkly, you did very well with the face."
DigitalPainting,372ia2,Qaki,1 point,Sun May 24 06:37:48 2015 UTC,"I really like how much you did with so little, I just have one little criticism. The fish seems to pop out over the background rather than be in the environment. Im pretty sure it just needs a bit of the water color brushed over it in low opacity to put some ""water"" between it and the viewer, with a bit more on the parts farther away."
DigitalPainting,372ia2,silverskull39,1 point,Sun May 24 14:57:23 2015 UTC,Thanks for the critique!
DigitalPainting,372ia2,Jord-UK,2,Sun May 24 16:31:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah I agree with that guy! But it's a really fun piece, it'd be cool if the giants in the sea were actually just regular display fish scaled up"
DigitalPainting,36xk8q,Rhunyc,7,Fri May 22 23:12:18 2015 UTC,"I want to start off by saying this is really good. There's some really great line work and colour use here - first glance this piece is pretty stunning. There's good depth and perspective, and the light/shadow use is strong.  My only criticism would be the brushwork in the background. It feels like there was a little less attention given here than in the central figure. I'd look at some tutorials about using different brushes and other tools to work over the background a little more. It looks like you were going for either a water or a smoke effect, but it's hard to tell which. Not saying you need to - but if you were looking for something to improve, that might be a starting point."
DigitalPainting,36xk8q,march1studios,2,Sat May 23 05:06:18 2015 UTC,Excellent crit! Thank you dearly for that. I'm gonna try to fix that soon I think to make this look even better. :)
DigitalPainting,36xk8q,rogueSleipnir,4,Sun May 24 06:30:16 2015 UTC,Ooh. This is cool. The character is solid. Try to have more defined background. I would recommend bigger broader brushes with blocks of color instead of those small numerous strokes you made.
DigitalPainting,36xk8q,Tdogg425,1 point,Sat May 23 05:39:35 2015 UTC,"Ahh thank you! Solid advice for sure, I might have to go and broaden it up a bit! I appreciate the crit!"
DigitalPainting,36xk8q,Cradle9,4,Sun May 24 06:28:18 2015 UTC,Looks great! I think the skeleton might benefit from stronger highlights. Let me know what you think.
DigitalPainting,36xk8q,mythiii,1 point,Sat May 23 05:43:57 2015 UTC,"Ahh thank you for the suggestion! I think he would, although it's hard for me to tell if that would be a good idea or not because brighter highlights would indicate more reflective surfaces.. Maybe from the water?"
DigitalPainting,36xk8q,D2HLC,3,Sun May 24 06:27:33 2015 UTC,Wow. Looks stunning! I'll leave the criticisms for others. :)
DigitalPainting,36xk8q,catfroman,1 point,Sat May 23 05:08:02 2015 UTC,Thank you for commenting either way! :)
DigitalPainting,36ycui,ihaveathingforcats,2,Sat May 23 03:48:19 2015 UTC,Stunning! What kind of Brushes/Brushsettings are you using?
DigitalPainting,36ycui,reinzn,1 point,Sat May 23 11:42:05 2015 UTC,There are lots of free brush packs on places like deviant art that you might want to check out if your tight on money
DigitalPainting,36ycui,FirstTimeDota,1 point,Sat May 23 20:37:01 2015 UTC,"I've also used those, especially the one's from Loish, Sycra and Bluefley, but I really wanted to try Kyle's because of the amount of hype they had gotten. When I begin working I'll obviously pay for them, he has many other sets I want to try."

DigitalPainting,36vjkp,NaimKabir,1 point,Fri May 22 20:17:18 2015 UTC,Beautiful.  Gave me a chill just looking at it. Well done.
DigitalPainting,36vjkp,polygraf,1 point,Fri May 22 20:56:28 2015 UTC,I like the little backlit hairs. Custom brush?
DigitalPainting,36tghf,javigimenezratti,3,Thu May 21 23:56:10 2015 UTC,I've been using some reference pictures to improve my hability to draw portraits more accurately. Each of them took me around 30 minutes or so. All of them done in photoshop.
DigitalPainting,36tghf,miraoister,3,Thu May 21 23:58:01 2015 UTC,you dont need any advice.
DigitalPainting,36tghf,TheSilentSounds,2,Fri May 22 07:19:00 2015 UTC,These look great! I would say watch the alignment of the mouths. Keep them on the same slant as the eyes.
DigitalPainting,36tghf,LunixKing,1 point,Fri May 22 07:25:53 2015 UTC,Thanks for the advice! I will look out for that ;)
DigitalPainting,36tghf,HnasPteer,2,Fri May 22 11:14:55 2015 UTC,"You should be making tutorial videos, I love these."
DigitalPainting,36tghf,Tomasuin,3,Fri May 22 12:44:01 2015 UTC,"Actually I'm thinking about making some posts with the best tutorials I can find on certain subjets like painting portraits. I can make videos as well, but I think I'd be more usefull if I sweeped the whole internet for the ones that already exist and put them all in one place! What do you think?"
