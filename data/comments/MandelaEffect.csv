Knowing where australia was in relation to Japan is a huge part of my life. Defending mainland china from the japanese or protecting the japanese borders are all very fond memories. I've also always had a world map on my wall. A few years ago I saw an article that talked about japan. The image used to depict Japan was nothing like I remembered from AnA. I did some googling and found that China, Japan and Australia had all undergone major re-toolings. None of them looked anything like i remembered playing on for hours, weeks months, years!!!  The next time I visited my parents I dug out my AnA board. Assuming that the problem was with some kids game having a shoddy board... but no.The Axis and Allies map is the same as the the new maps online and I guess it always has been. i still can't shake my memory of those three specific land masses though."

MandelaEffect,3dnclj,ThingsIveSeenandDone,11,Fri Jul 17 17:52:42 2015 UTC,"The Flat Time Conspiracy Time is not what is used to be.    What we call 'History' ended sometime between 1997-2002. Or rather it finished the process of 'winding up' through that period. Although the initial threads of this 'winding up' process can probably be traced back to 1989 and the end of the Berlin Wall.    Historical time had a fabric to it, a tangible quality, it was meaningful and contiguous. You could describe it as elemental, and qualitative.  Flat time, what we've been in since around 2002 has a universal quality, it is not contiguous, but only gives the illusion of it. Phenomena in Flat time are very interchangeable from one year to another. For example You could take a Pop song from 2015 for example and it could fit into either 2005 or 2025. Or, you could take someone's fashion, or clothing from 2004, and it would not look out of place in 2014.    This is because phenomena 'Music, Fashion, Automobiles' are elemental in nature, just like Historical time. They are part of the same qualitative fabric as historical time. When you look at automobile designs from 2015 they do not look much different to those of 2005. Fashion is strictly a 20th century phenomenon, Fashion in flat time is not 'new', rather it is recylced trends of the 20s-90s. i.e (This ""new"" 2014 line of Women's Coats has a 60s 'Mod' element to it, with a 90s flair). etc  People will claim that they still perceive 'differences' or 'something new under the sun', but these so called 'new' things are never totally new when you dig deep enough, you will always find that it has been done before in some incarnation, like the skinny jeans of the 80s new romantics etc. What's really happening is the micro-recylcing of trends to give the illusion of something new, but all that's really happening is a clever re-arranging of the same old furniture.    This is the nature of Flat time, it gives the illusion of being qualitative and contiguous, but it is in fact not. However our ability to perceive this illusion has only been recent because 16 or so years is a relatively short time period in order to look back on. Until recently we have still been under the millennial spell of progressing in linear time. Instead we've been in a sort of universal time, where one year is largely interchangeable with others."

There are tribes that actually do this within a day and culturally do not think about the past or future. They are no more wrong. Instead, let me modify your thinking; What if.... you are only recalling now, or aware of yourself now, because this is the only time anyone was ever alive. There is no history at all, or at least, not a conscience one. You are conciseness now because it's only import to be right now.

I had the acute, overwhelming certitude (and still have) that despite all the change we see, a specific permanent landscape underlies the world of change: and that this invisible underlying landscape is that of the Bible; it, specifically, is the period immediately following the death and resurrection of Christ; it is, in other words, the time period of the Book of Acts.  Parmenides would be proud of me. I have gazed at a constantly changing world and declared that underneath it lies the eternal, the unchanging, the absolutely real. but how has this come about? If the real time is circa A.D. 50, then why do we see A.D. 1978?

I have looked at maps fairly recently that didn't have those.  I also remember Australia being very isolated from Asia.  It is now closer than it used to be, but it also seems like most of the Indonesian islands were smaller or not existent. It is bizarre.  One thing I distinctly remember is looking at a map about 20 years ago and being shocked at how far away New Zealand was from Australia.  I attributed it to poor memory and looked up how far apart they were.  Almost 1000 miles.  I have mentioned that fact to a lot of people since then.  I just looked it up on Google maps and the distance is about 1400 miles now.    In 1970, I went to Europe for seven months.  I was 9 years old.  I spent a lot of time looking at maps.

MandelaEffect,3dijst,falsedichotomydave,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:55:10 2015 UTC,"Hello Bambooz_led,  I can relate to your feeling of nearly having an anxiety attack.  I went through the same thing about a year and a half ago - around December 2013.  I had a few alternate memories and found out a lot of other people shared them.  I'm honestly not sure which is worse - thinking you might actually be mentally ill or coming to believe that reality is not what you always thought it was - I chose the latter - it was a huge paradigm shift for me - one I am afraid to discuss with most of my friends and family.  My credibility with some would be completely shot.  My first alternate memory was of watching parts of Rev. Billy Graham's televised funeral.  I later heard on the radio he had not died - I was completely shocked - because I know I did not confuse him with anyone else.  I know it wasn't a dream.  He was a friend to many U.S. presidents and many attended his funeral.  It turns out many people share this memory.  I share some of your geography memories.  An even weirder thing about the Mandela Effect is that people remember things ""changing"" at different times.  I think you said you were in your earlier 20's when you saw NZ in a different place - so more than 5 years ago, given that you are 30.  Some time in 2013, I looked at my National Geographic globe because I wanted to see exactly where NZ was.  I was wondering WHY I seldom thought about NZ and how it seemed even more exotic and far away than Australia.  I looked at my globe and saw that it was west of AU, possibly NW.  I am in California, and I realized it really was ""farther away"" since I would most likely fly west to visit.  I knew I'd be able to remember where it was from then on.  But a few months later I looked at my globe again - that part of the world, and was as the British would say ""gobsmacked.""  NZ was out of place and AU was way far north.  I'm on my Kindle and it won't let me open you Imgur picture, and my desktop is down or I would check your image.  Anyway you are not at all alone in this, as crazy as it must sound to anyone from Australia or New Zealand.  I also share your feelings about Japan being too far north, and I visited a friend there in 1993.  (For reference, I am 51.)  I was extremely surprised to see Mongolia as a present day country as well.  You know, it's possible there are people in some part of the world who all share the same alternate memory of the U.S.or Canada or other countries.    If you haven't already, you should check out Fiona Broome's website, www.mandelaeffect.com.  Lots of people share many of your alternate memories, I including Jiffy peanut butter.  There's a separate article on that - I did a little research on that one.  It's all very, very odd, but you are not crazy."
MandelaEffect,3dijst,JuliaGulia1964,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:18:42 2015 UTC,"2008-2009 is when I researched New Zealand. I was in Florida. One of the contestants from the Bachelor, the girl was from New Zealand and in the final they went there to meet the parents. I remember extensively researching the area, looking on Google Earth, googling for pictures. I thought how cool it would be to live there. It was beautiful, my idea of heaven. It was what the OP is saying. Far away from any landmass, in the middle of nowhere, and Australia didn't look like it does now with the pointy top and that ridiculous name gulf. I wasn't even aware of that one and I'm a geography major!!! I was aware of the New Zealand changes maybe in 2010, it's how I came across Mandela Effect or timeline shift in ATS, but that gulf is new to me as of a couple of weeks ago. Since then people dead are now alive and I'd say at least 5 shifts happened to me since then. I would argue that it has to do with LHC. At first I was shocked, now learning to live with the shifts."

Summer of 2008 I was restless, full of anxiety out of the blue. Went on without sleep or little as 2 hours per night. Then came December and it got that bad that I was suicidal, against my nature. Something was wrong. That was when I was in the States. Then 2009 summer l left. After that New Zealand happened, or rather realised that it's not how I remember and more and more shifts piling up. Now this shooting. I do remember watching it on CNN and reported on all other major media outlets. I was definitely in America so it couldn't have been 2012. Telly was on all the time and it went on and on. I'll try to remember details and have a look at what happened in this timeline with it happening in 2012"

MandelaEffect,3dkfp2,adescuentechable,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:07:03 2015 UTC,It's too bad you got downvoted. This one is pretty intriguing since it's so recent.  You remember the shootings as happening in 2008? When exactly did you realize that your memory didn't match up with reality?  Do you remember 2012? And people talking about the shooting then (when it occurred in this timeline)?
MandelaEffect,3dkfp2,Roril,2,Fri Jul 17 03:07:05 2015 UTC,"I don't mind the downvotes, kinda goes with the territory here. I only realized it happened in 2012 when the news came out on his conviction recently, hadn't read or heard about this since the initial incident and outrage. The shooting and the following outrage I both remember being in 2008, my specific memory being that it was TDK and not TDKR.  I do remember 2012 and nothing else seems to be off. I'm willing to accept I might just be crazy, figured it was worth sharing in any event."

MandelaEffect,3dkfp2,Highguy4706,3,Sun Jul 19 20:14:16 2015 UTC,Yes it does because he was obsessed with Heath Ledger's portrayal of the Joker in The Dark Knight from 2008. How would he have been obsessed with that portrayal if the shooting took place at the premiere of the movie that portrayal was in? The shooting took place at the premiere of the Dark Knight Rises in 2012.

MandelaEffect,3d6yef,GodDammitCaesar,2,Wed Jul 15 00:20:47 2015 UTC,"Maybe you're thinking of Charla Nash, who was mauled (but survived) by her friend's pet chimpanzee?

They all look alike though that is for sure. But Zsa Zsa I definitely knew her face and the report was just a few years ago.   It may be possible that news reports put out a false statement though due to her decline in 2011. There is mention of a gold casket even. Just doesn't seem right though.

MandelaEffect,3cpuee,StarHeadedCrab,2,Thu Jul 9 20:29:27 2015 UTC,"Here's a TV lineup. Checkout Saturday morning at 7:00am (canNOT believe I used to get up that early willingly).  Then there's this little gem.  Someone suggested the dude, Stan, changed his name from Bernstein (Berenstein?) to *Berenstain"" in 2000.I haven't found any source of this yet.  Oddly enough, to get an objective opinion I texted my ex and asked her 2 questions: When is Thanksgiving each year and what was the name of those bears that lived in a tree from those children's books? To the first quest she replied, ""It's the 3rd thurs every nov. You fuckin with me?"" To the second she replied, ""Bernstein bears. Are you seriously fucking with me?""  LOL! I sent her both Wikipedia links and she wasn't as blown away as I was, but this be mind-bottlin' as fuq."
MandelaEffect,3cpuee,rehms,4,Mon Jul 13 04:36:42 2015 UTC,"Old articles having it as ""Berenstein"" actually make me think it always was Berenstain and those are simple typos. If there was a change in the universe (ie our minds were all transported to an alternate reality) then I'd imagine every ""Berenstein"" being overwritten with ""Berenstain"". A smoking gun for the Mandela Effect would be a 1980s form guide saying ""It's not Bernstein, it's Berenstain. Always remember 3 Es"".  My guess as to the real cause of the effect is that it's a word that's too complicated for its target audience to spell, and teachers and parents didn't bother correcting the children the proper spelling as it's a proper noun related to ""entertainment"". Then subconsciously since every other word ending with ""stain"" rhymes with ""stain"" and stressess the ""ain"", but ""Berenstain"" doesn't, it gets remembered as ""stein"". Also people would consciously have to remember that it's ""Beren"" not ""Bern"" from how the word is said that ""stain"" is lost from memory.  But honestly I have no idea. Everyone remembers the wrong thing, and that in itself is interesting. The theories are just fun speculation."

MandelaEffect,3cpuee,stupidrobots,-6,Sun Jul 19 04:15:35 2015 UTC,"Can we stop this?  We live in a world where jewish people often have the suffix -stein in their names, we hear that far more often, so naturally -stein took the place of the far less common -stain in the books that we read 20 years ago."
MandelaEffect,3cpuee,capaldithenewblack,4,Fri Jul 10 17:38:47 2015 UTC,"Except I always pronounced ""Berenstein"" as ""Berenstain."" When I hear stein as in a Jewish suffix, I think stine like Ben Stein. So why would I assume stain was spelled stein unless I'd actually seen it that way?"
MandelaEffect,3cpuee,Kafke,2,Fri Jul 10 19:48:28 2015 UTC,"That still doesn't explain why I called it ""steen"" all these years..."
MandelaEffect,3cpuee,stupidrobots,-1,Fri Jul 10 22:04:57 2015 UTC,Because of Jewish last names
MandelaEffect,3cpuee,Kafke,8,Fri Jul 10 22:18:44 2015 UTC,"How does that make any sense? I pronounce the jewish names completely differently. Steen vs Stein. If the name were actually Stain, I'd say it like the word (stain) rather than steen.  At the time when I was reading these books I didn't even know what jewish was.  Which means you gotta go from stain to steen with no reference to jewish last names. That's a pretty big leap.  Edit: It's like going from Microsoft to Maycrosoft."
MandelaEffect,3cpuee,capaldithenewblack,-1,Fri Jul 10 22:35:13 2015 UTC,So where are records of people saying that sort of thing in the 1980s?
MandelaEffect,3cpuee,stupidrobots,3,Fri Jul 10 17:40:24 2015 UTC,The internet didn't exist (at least not in the way it does today). I always thought it was stein and did not find out otherwise until I got online.

MandelaEffect,3ctglv,ChaseTheLights,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:40:16 2015 UTC,"The pronunciation kind of depends on where you live / what dialect of English you speak.  Most people pronounce the word with a silent ""p"" but I have heard rasp-berries a good handful of times in my lifetime, but usually that's because there's that hard stop between the s sound and the ""pb"" sound.  To my knowledge and personal experience, the 'p' has always been there for the berry.  I've seen the word as a last name spelled without the 'p' though."

MandelaEffect,3cg885,popisms,9,Tue Jul 7 17:50:03 2015 UTC,"This must have been a common misunderstanding, because until I read this I would have bet my life it was always the third Thursday. So confused...."
MandelaEffect,3cg885,Raven14,6,Tue Jul 7 19:36:41 2015 UTC,"That was my understanding, but I'm not American so I could easily have gotten it wrong.   I looked up some historical Thanksgiving dates, and I think I know what confused me. Fairly often Thanksgiving doesn't fall on the last Thursday of November. For example, Thanksgiving in 1990 was Nov 22 and in 1995 on Nov 23. Again in 2000 it was Nov 23, and 2001 was Nov 22, and again in 2006 (23) and 2007 (22), and in 2012 it was on the 22nd.  So when people said ""the 4th Thursday of the month,"" I assumed they meant the last Thursday. When Thanksgiving fell a week before the last Thursday, I assumed it must have been the 3rd Thursday of November. What actually happened is that November had 5 Thursdays, but I wasn't paying close enough attention to realize that.  eta https://www.timeanddate.com/holidays/us/thanksgiving-day  November has 30 days, so any year where Thanksgiving falls before Nov 24th will be a year where there's 5 Thursdays in November (e.g. https://www.timeanddate.com/calendar/monthly.html?year=2006&month=11&country=27)"
MandelaEffect,3cg885,michikade,4,Tue Jul 7 18:09:51 2015 UTC,"This one is fairly common, yeah.  Even for folks in the US.  It falls on the fourth Thursday, but because it's always a Thursday and never a set specific calendar day it can throw people off.  Also, a lot of people say it falls on the ""last"" Thursday, which is correct MOST of the time but on occasion November has 5 Thursdays so at that point this rule doesn't work anymore.  /u/ToolingAround went into nice detail about this phenomenon.  Me myself?  I struggle harder with figuring out when the heck Easter is supposed to be every year.  Heh.  But I don't remember Thanksgiving being anything except for the fourth Thursday, personally."
MandelaEffect,3cg885,Jamesfire,-3,Wed Jul 8 16:22:08 2015 UTC,"In the last 20 years or so they have moved Thanksgiving up a week to the 3rd Thursday in November for monetary reasons (one more week for retailers to cash in on Christmas shopping). Before America was commercialized and stripped of morals and values, Thanksgiving was on the 4th Thursday of November (Back in the early 90's and before)."

MandelaEffect,3bsb6j,AnachronistNo1,2,Wed Jul 1 19:15:01 2015 UTC,"Maybe the film was  The Railway Children (1970)?    Although I do vaguely remember seeing the Boxcar Children as something on IMDB, (not the cartoon).     It's weird how often someone will bring up a Mandela Effect of something when your memory of it is at its vaguest."
MandelaEffect,3bsb6j,PhiWeaver,1 point,Thu Jul 2 06:38:21 2015 UTC,I wish it was. Doesn't have the same ending as the book. And that was the thing that stuck out the most for me. The movie's ending was almost exactly as I pictured it while hearing the story read. I've been looking over the years. Checking back to IMDB every once in a while to see if anyone noticed its absence and made a profile. Even posted a handful of times on different boards/forums on the subject of both movies. No dice.  Almost tempted to track down my old teacher to settle the matter. It's been bugging me for all these years. The torture is having 1 or 2 people remember the same or similar. Gives me hope that I can get to the bottom of this! Hah!
MandelaEffect,3bsb6j,PhiWeaver,2,Thu Jul 2 08:32:12 2015 UTC,"Well what I remember of the IMDB poster was a Red Boxcar on a train track, going around a curve of the track with a couple of people hanging on to it. With a technicolor quality to it."

Apparently in 1996 and the twenty years before that it was flipped the other way, but I was so politically unaware at the time I don't remember it that way.  So yes, they DID flip 15 years ago."

MandelaEffect,3boagf,GeorgianDevil,-3,Thu Jul 2 09:06:48 2015 UTC,"Red is traditionally associated with socialism and communism. The oldest symbol of socialism (and, by extension, communism) is the Red Flag, which dates back to the French Revolution in the 18th century and the revolutions of 1848. The colour red was chosen to represent the blood of the workers who died in the struggle against capitalism. All major socialist and communist alliances and organisations – including the First, Second, and Third Internationals – used red as their official colour. The association between the colour red and communism is particularly strong. Communists use red much more often and more extensively than other ideologies use their respective traditional colours.   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_colour  Sounds like the Republicans to me right? Oh wait, political ideologues couldn't possibly have wanted to associate 20th century negative attributes of the nebulously overbearing state with the Republicans could they?..  Propaganda doesn't work like that at all. /s"

MandelaEffect,3bcs8y,vorteck,8,Sun Jun 28 00:11:02 2015 UTC,"I thought the same thing, but honestly I think the reason is because it's so rare to see pictures of her when she's old. It sorta leads to you thinking that she just didn't hit old age. Just a theory though, haha"

Chris's Steak House was the original name and it was only one restaurant, then Ruth bought it and had some success until it burned down. She moved to another location but her purchase contract didn't allow her to use the name Chris's Steak House in any other location so she called it Ruth's Chris Steak House. She started the franchise. She sold a majority share in the chain after being diagnosed with cancer (and has since passed away). Her family still owns part of the company.  I was actually reading up on this a few weeks ago as my bus stop was right in front of a Ruth's Chris and I have always wondered about the name."

MandelaEffect,3b9fqw,Georgiaocheef,3,Sat Jun 27 04:47:27 2015 UTC,"I wish I could.  Using google I get really only 3 results, and all appear to be just lists of names.  I'm not even sure if it was actually a definition or just an inference based on other patterns I picked up.  But I'm sure I watched the commercials and was able to read at the time - this would probably have been the mid 1980's.    Obviously the other explanation is that I mis-heard the name (would be pretty easy to do), and they never actually showed the words in print in their commercials and this is all just a false memory.  But I keep thinking it would be really weird NOT to show the name as well as saying it, wouldn't it?  How would you expect people to find it to eat there?  We lived in a small town quite far from major cities, and the commercials could very well have been on cable feed from the US instead of Canada, so I wouldn't have paid much attention to the location part anyways.  It just seems very weird because it was locked into my mind one way, and now I find there is no reason for me to have remembered it that clearly but wrong."

Like, for example, when I was little, Inspector Gadget was my FAVORITE show, but I was born in 1984 so there is no way I could have seen the original run of it and remember it (the original run ended in February, 1986), but I remember distinctly it being aired on regular television (we didn't have cable in those days, so it had to have been on one of the 9-10 channels we actually got).  Course, I also remember watching Scooby Doo as a kid and those were all syndicated but originally aired in the 70s.  Heh.  I'm pretty sure Denver the Last Dinosaur was played around that same time.  Seems like a lot of those types of cartoons were aired during that block of time back in the late 80s/early 90s.  Edited to add: thinking about it, it seems like I remember seeing Denver and Captain Planet around the same time because the themes were similar.  Captain Planet is VERY early 90s."
MandelaEffect,3b37u0,michikade,1 point,Thu Jun 25 23:09:48 2015 UTC,"It is tricky with cartoons. I grew up on classic looney tunes from the 30s and 40s on channels like TNT  and misc. local channels before that. I was born in 83 but was really acquainted with jem, transformers, smurfs,etc from reruns I assume now. Denver though in my broken hindsight really smacks of the early 90s.   There are three Simpson episodes I think when I think back on the 90s. 1) Lisa makes friends when they go on vacation and she adopts a persona. 2) homerpalooza and 3) poochie the rocking dog. To me, those three concepts epitomize the 90s or at least a the majority of it."

Since the cartoon was originally so short-lived, and the kids who originally watched it most likely would have ""outgrown"" such cartoons, they probably figured they could get away with marketing it as ""new""."

That being said, a LOT of people remember it as Mel Gibson.  I'm not really sure why because to me Tom Hanks and Mel Gibson have always been completely different people with different bodies of work, but it may be because it's starting to become apparent I'm a bit older than many around here and remember going to see Mel Gibson movies in the theatre when I was a kid (like Braveheart, The Patriot, etc) and Tom Hanks movies in the theatre as well (like Apollo 13, Forrest Gump, etc).

Your perceptions are your own. That sounds crazy but you've got to understand, your not holding the remote control.  It sounds crazy but here's the thing. If you repeat something often enough, it must be truth and obviously many are vulnerable when they're younger and more trusting. But going back to that dress thing a point that a lot of folk miss, is that was the concept of doublethink which Orwell wrote about. In that instance people saw different colours and no one was wrong in what they perceived. They still saw different things (in this instance colors). People saw differences in color and NO ONE was wrong. Period. That is basically like consciousness itself giving you the opportunity to get it. Don't miss it out of 'reaction' or a lack of understanding. It's an opportunity to develop self awareness by paying attention to their behavior. By paying attention to the thoughts they are attracting.   So you have to ask yourselves, if they know that - wouldn't they try and trick the five senses? Whoever is in 'control' is irresponsible and the nature of reality is treated the way it is, for a reason. If everyone knew the truth? There would be no 'power' or perception of. For me? I saw Tom Hanks but I can accept the persons thoughts. It doesn't change a thing in my life but people do need to look into what was said in 1984 about 'doublethink' - look into doublespeak and all these things and it will make sense if not immediately, eventually."

MandelaEffect,3a7x35,photonasty,3,Thu Jun 18 01:38:44 2015 UTC,"I do think that many ""glitch in the matrix"" experiences may very well be something weird, that we don't quite understand yet. I do believe in things that you might label ""paranormal"" or even ""supernatural."" I am not sure that these things are necessarily completely outside the scope of scientific inquiry, but I do suspect there might be things we don't have the underlying scientific knowledge and theories to understand yet. Much as Newton wasn't aware of quantum mechanics, there could conceivably be aspects of nature that we in the 21st century have yet to really discover.  Despite all of that, and my openness to the paranormal, I feel like nearly all of the ""Mandela effects"" are poor memory. Many of them are something like, ""Didn't [celebrity] die back in [year]?"" It's easy to get confused on stuff like that, since it's the kind of entertainment news that you kind of overhear on TV or skim some headline about. As for Mandela himself, there were apparently rumors that he died in prison, which were later proven incorrect. So, a lot of people probably do have some vague recollection of reading that he had died. New Zealand and Australia, I think can probably be traced to a combination of certain map projections that distort distances, and a sort of embedded idea that these areas are particularly remote or separate from other landmasses.   There's the occasional Mandela Effect that makes me wonder, but very few. One of the recurring one that's caught my eye is the one where Billy Graham died. I think that some other fundamental pundit must have passed away at that time, or perhaps Graham fell ill or something."

I come here because I'm fascinated by the brain, and what happens when things go wrong. I used to be very proud of my memory, but as I've gotten older I've come to grasp that it's not nearly as solid as I like to think it is.   To me, the fundamental difference between the posters here and most people is that when most people misremember something, they may scrunch up their face for a second, but then then they shrug their shoulders and move on. The interesting thing to me isn't that people misremember, it's how emphatically certain they are that they didn't--couldn't--make a mistake. That when confronted with the possibility that they may have remembered something wrong, they conclude that the more likely option is their being bounced into an alternate universe. That's fascinating.  It's Plato's Allegory of the Cave in action."

You can't find any maps or anything that show the spot you remember. But you're certain that were it is now is actually where canada used to be, and the US was more south than what you see.  You'd feel insane, right? Like some shit just hit the fan and that something is seriously fucking wrong.  It's not so much ""I cant' accept I'm wrong"" or a ""Oh I just misremembered"".

Now when it comes to the Mandela Effect as a whole (which isn't specifically about 'dimension hopping', it's just the name for the phenomenon where many people share the same 'false' memory), that's a 10, because I've seen concrete evidence of it, both here and in my own day-to-day life."

MandelaEffect,3a7x35,Limpidprogress,0,Thu Jun 18 06:27:29 2015 UTC,I'd say I'm a 9 because of personal experience with other supposedly impossible to do things. For instance I've been training and learning how to do psychokinesis. I've managed to catch some things on video like this one where I stop a crookes radiometer. For any of you skeptics I really don't care what you think and I'm not trying to convince anyone. These videos are for me to help me get better. It's just interesting that it can be done. So with that in mind I think that dimensional jumping is very plausible.

I did consider that my understanding of gas prices had to do with unusual data. I was simply curious if anybody recalled these prices as I did.  I think part of my confusion lies in how media reports unfavorably upon presidents they dislike. It's easy to make data lie, and so during Bush there may well have been a narrative which made it seem like the abnormally high prices were more widespread than was true. This is my best guess.  Have a wonderful day, and thank you again.  I'd still love to hear from anybody who has had this thought process regarding gas as well.

In recent history in my local area I do not recall paying more than around $3.29 or $3.39/gallon and we usually stay between $2.09 and $2.49, at least over the past few years.

MandelaEffect,3a08am,Squirrelmanity,8,Tue Jun 16 05:17:07 2015 UTC,"Yes and no. If something along those lines happens, it's simply the person misremembering something. If multiple (meaning a lot, not two or three) people misremember something, then it becomes a Mandela effect. For instance, many people remember Nelson Mandela dying in the 80s or 90s, or the Berenstain Bears being spelled Berenstein, or Tank Man being run over and killed. In reality, Mandela died only recently, it is in fact Berenstain, and Tank Man was not killed in Tiananmen Square. Because such a large number of people misremembered these things, they have been labeled as being a Mandela effect."
MandelaEffect,3a08am,ChaseTheLights,5,Tue Jun 16 05:35:26 2015 UTC,"Okay, that makes it a bit more clear. So this subreddit turns out to be mainly very specific cases of people remembering things differently, with the exception of certainly cases where a larger number of people agree with the OP? Not specifically talking about things that actually would be consider the the Mandela effect.  I'm not trying to bash the sub or anything. From exploring it though it has just seemed like posts with ""Oh this guy died in 1997 for me"" and then 15 comments saying, ""nah he was in this movie/show/commercial and actually that was 2004"" and whatever variations on that."
MandelaEffect,3a08am,ChaseTheLights,1 point,Tue Jun 16 05:52:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's really subjective and 90% of the time it's just a person misremembering something or there being false news stories about things. For instance, Oli Sykes, the singer of Bring Me The Horizon, has been reported ""dead"" multiple times, so if someone were to think he were and then suddenly see one of their music videos, it would be understandable, and because of the headline, people who don't follow the band could continue to think he was dead, and it would be understandable for there to be a Mandela effect from it."
MandelaEffect,3a08am,CelticBull,6,Tue Jun 16 06:06:20 2015 UTC,"So realistically, the Mandela effect is almost directly associated with people being misinformed or not up to date with updates on a false report or something of the same nature, if I understand it correctly. So essentially, a widely accepted (by the public), misinformation or incorrect rememberance of an event? I'm just trying to get a better perspective on the sub and whether it should be something I continue to follow. I ended up stumbling upon the subreddit through /r/glitch_in_the_matrix  edit: I guess so far my concern is that a majority of the posts seem to be... silly/unrelateable with little substance because of the specific alternate-rememberance of events."
MandelaEffect,3a08am,ChaseTheLights,5,Tue Jun 16 06:54:55 2015 UTC,"In addition the 'mandela effect' isn't recognized by science at all. Scientifically this would be attributed to false memories, or mass delusions etc.  The Mandela Effect was branded by paranormal researcher Fiona Broome.  I, too, came here thinking there would be more baffling stories like the 'lost Thunderbird photo'. Unfortunately the majority are mixed up celebrity deaths and common spelling errors."
MandelaEffect,3a08am,Averscer,3,Tue Jun 16 08:09:34 2015 UTC,"a widely accepted (by the public) misinformation or incorrect remembrance of an event   That's the basic idea right there. Yes, most of these are silly and unverifiable, such as someone forgetting there was a clock on their grandma's wall for 10 years or something like that, but every once in a while something comes up where people go ""wait, that's not that?"""
MandelaEffect,3a08am,michikade,3,Tue Jun 16 10:07:10 2015 UTC,"No... How would one discover a mass public false memory?   the advice is to look around on the internet before you post, but id you never speak up you'll never find out if its a positive hit with others.  Personally, I remember Forrest Whitaker dying of a heart attack in 2010.  Through posting, I found other people remembered it too, even though it had not been previously reported.  The unfortunate thing here is that discovering mass public false memories is like a shot in the dark, but when you find a real good one like the Bernstain/stein bears one or the location of New Zealand, your head will spin.  Also I want to note: Science attributing this to poor memory is not science.  Its dogma.  This would be a social study, but its not a repeatable process, its very hit or miss.  To bring science into something that is so baffling with no clear understanding, and discarding it because of scientific dogmas would be unfortunate.  And no, I'm not a religious nut, I'm an atheist who read Carl Sagan when I was very young, and believe science has lost its way with cult of NDT and Stephen Faking."
MandelaEffect,3a08am,Jakker27,2,Tue Jun 16 15:36:21 2015 UTC,"The idea behind this sub is to see if a memory you personally have is shared with others.  Mandela Effects are a shared experience - they're only compelling as effects when multiple people remember things exactly as you do (or very close).  For example: aside from the ones mentioned (Mandela himself, Berenstain/stein and Tank Man), a very common one is the location of New Zealand or Papua New Guinea in relation to Australia and Asia.  A lot of people remember the entire Oceania region being laid out differently.  If the issue is specific to one person and it is with absolute certainty that it is not a simple misremembering, then that's more of a straight up glitch and can be discussed there.  Also, since a Mandela Effect is usually when a number of unrelated individuals have the same memory of an event, a personal story is more likely to fit in better over at /r/Glitch_in_the_Matrix  Many people here, myself included, like to give possible alternate explanations to help the person posting see if they can identify a misremembering.  I couldn't say what anyone's memories are like so if the OP of a thread where I post a possible alternate says that there is no way what I've mentioned could be what they remember, then I accept that.  As Sir Arthur Conan Doyle said, ""Once you eliminate the impossible, whatever remains, no matter how improbable, must be the truth.""  I like to give people the ability to eliminate the impossible.  As for me?  I don't really have Effect memories.  I've not seen one come up that blew my mind yet, heh.  But that isn't to say I'm not open to the possibility that it could happen, just that it hasn't happened for me yet (perhaps I have an unusual memory, or perhaps, as some people believe, I haven't done any dimensional jumping -- which is an entirely different conversation so I won't get into that here)"

It's the tone of friend vs band. If it fits to your memory? You are correct.   I will never forget this happening to me with lord of the rings and something that was said. The tone in my mind solidified what I knew I heard and despite the new perception changing what I was about to hear....I dug in further and on the net it said there had been versions that said what I remembered. However, I saw people start to doubt themselves. Their own recollection. Very dangerous. So play it back in your memory, listen to the tone. Try it for both words and if you still believe it's boyfriend? Don't doubt it, regardless but you'll hear it now as husband. Know what you heard by empowering yourself. Maybe they want people to doubt themselves and their Godly intuition. It's a right brain process I think but we're in a left brain domineering society. Though some are right brain imbalanced.   This is perception manipulation. The process where you (when you were correct), once your perception changes, you will hear it that way all the time. Is it possible to change it? You started to decipher or decode it different. Yes decode it different. It's not a 1:1 world we're living in. In the sense that if you knock your hand off the wall, a wave travels from the wall, into your brain for it to decode. It just SEEMS to be 1:1 and that gives a perception of solidity. People need to think about these things and understand you have to have to protect yourself. If you are ever 99% confident about something, let it slide. It's the 100% things you are absolutely sure of, that you have to always empower yourself   Trust me. These are the things worth putting faith in. Not religions and the latest 'superstar' lol. We need to look after ourselves. If you understand the world lies to you? The only hope you have is to speculate. If you never speculate, it's got you."

Same with the absolute most popular Mandela, the Berenstain bears.   ""Stain""? Really? Like a stain on your shirt? That's not a normal name. Surely they mean Stein, like Frankenstein, that makes way more sense. And we were kids, so we obviously didn't even try to read it out letter by letter.

That would be much more convincing.   Because that isn't what a Mandela Effect is.  A Mandela Effect is when you have a memory that is part of a SHARED EXPERIENCE, generally speaking, and others remember things exactly as you do.  That's why things like Berenstein/Berenstain or the locations of New Zealand in relation to Australia, etc, are discussed with such fervor around here.  What you're talking about here is a complete and total glitch in the matrix or even something like acquired prosopagnosia (so they can't recognize their spouse or whoever anymore) or something.    Mandela Effects are changes that don't personally affect you.  Before the term was coined, they were called 'false memories' for a reason.  The inherent flaw in human memory probably causes most of them but they become more compelling when a large group of people remember the same thing."
MandelaEffect,39alp3,michikade,-2,Wed Jun 10 13:36:34 2015 UTC,Ok I get it.  So it's more like a social-psychological phenomenon where certain things and incidents cause the same misconceptions.  It still baffles me when people say it has something to do with dimension hopping.
MandelaEffect,39alp3,michikade,5,Wed Jun 10 13:51:03 2015 UTC,"Some people believe the dimensional shift thing more strongly than others do.  The only time any of that baffles me is when those people do not at least entertain the possibility that there could be an alternate explanation, particularly if it's a childhood memory, because a childlike mind and a lot of time passing can warp things.  Other than that, who am I to say what someone does or does not remember clearly?    I like to provide alternate explanations whenever possible.  If the OP of that thread disagrees that my explanation is plausible for whatever reason, then I accept that.  I don't think it's that big of a deal if someone does or does not believe that they've changed dimensions - mine isn't all that terrible, really, so they're welcome to hang out here for a while (I am one who doesn't really have Mandela Effects - I tend to remember things as they currently are, at least for the most common ones discussed here)."

You might argue I'm not really using Occum's razor, but who is to say we don't have memory files and access some files more frequently than others and rare to access ones are ones we are more likely to get a shocking discovery while accessing? If one or more person named Bernstein or something like that remembers Berenstein like it was only one letter off from their name and one or more person remembers Brother Bear referring to himself as Beareinstein while talking up being a scientist or something like that and it is even true that an unknown immigration officer in the 1800s changed a family name to Berenstain from a name that had stein at the end then what is really just bad memory?

It was more clear than the linked photo, more like the photos in the comments but I seem to remember it was nailed to a barn or something. I think I found out later it had been revealed as a hoax but I don't remember any details.   EDIT: My husband, who follows crypto news, just got home and he said there were a bunch of modern hoax photos like this(modern as in 70s 80s, not a civil war era hoax). Not sure how that would make the photo dissapear though, maybe it was removed out of new editions after the hoax was revealed and they somehow got their book replaced?"

MandelaEffect,38d6v6,michikade,4,Wed Jun 3 17:58:35 2015 UTC,"You remember ""they"" because  that's how people always have quoted it. I don't think it's a Mandela effect.  Similarly, Darth Vader never said ""Luke, I am your father."" Captain Kirk never said ""Beam me up, Scotty.""  No one ever said ""Play it again, Sam"" in the movie Casablanca."
MandelaEffect,38d6v6,SombreroOnAFlea,3,Fri Jun 5 03:51:34 2015 UTC,"Ah, but those quotes all have a name in them, giving the misquote a reference point.  Taking the Star Wars one for example, the actual quote is ""No, I am your father"", but without including Luke's name (and a bad James Earl Jones impression) it just becomes somebody saying that rather than a reference.  Similarly, throwing Scotty's name in the Star Trek quote points toward the original series rather than Next Generation, Voyager, Deep Space Nine, etc.  So the misquotes kind of make sense for those with names.  With this one, I think the misquote came from the rather strong accent portrayed by Radioactive Man (Rainier Wolfcastle - McBain - the Schwarzenegger ripoff) - adding an extra ""they"" in there sounds like a stereotype of what a non-native English speaker would say.  I don't remember the misquote, myself.  I've seen the meme for years and remember when it was going around places like Fark they usually used the correct quote of ""the goggles do nothing"" and I've seen the modified joke of ""the Google does nothing"" when trying to find something (kinda like Google-fu being weak); however, I have also seen the misquote of ""the goggles, they do nothing"" on memes and in quotes around the Internet for almost as long."

It was always 'Scotty (or 'Mr. Scott', or 'Enterprise'), one/two/X to beam up.'  EDIT: Fixed a memory error, he never asked Engineering to beam anybody up (why would he?), it was the Enterprise in general when it wasn't Scotty specifically."

If Evolution were true, we should find literally millions of fossils that show how one kind of life slowly and gradually changed to another kind of life. But missing links are the trade secret, in a sense, of palaeontology. The point is, the links are still missing. What we really find are gaps that sharpen up the boundaries between kinds. It's those gaps which provide us with the evidence of Creation of separate kinds. As a matter of fact, there are gaps between each of the major kinds of plants and animals.

Remember how crappy the TV's were back in the 1980's? It could be that the old TV sets just couldn't handle the colors as they were supposed to be.  Or, if you saw the movie on a frequently reused VHS tape, it could be that it messed up the colors as well.  There was always a dog in the fridge saying ""Zuul"".

I think what is happening, is that people who are not 'local' to Australia and surrounding areas have an impression of where AUS/NZ should be, based on cursory glances at maps over the years. Geographically, India broke off and drifted due North from Western Australia smashing into Eurasia eons ago (and still moving North today) creating the Himilayas, Papua New Guinea used to be joined to Australia, and as recently as the last ice age there was a land bridge between the two islands which enabled the first native Australians, Aboriginals, to make it to Australia. NZ broke away from SE Australia at some point as well. Australia is exactly where it should be given the above, and rather than explaining away your perceived location of the country as a 'dimensional jump' the more likely scenario is that you simply assumed it's location based on sporadic encounters with maps in the past."

NZ/Aus are as you describe (and I was aware from the other posts). Bahamas I realized quite a bit ago, when I found they are actually closer than I had remembered and indeed larger.  Iceland/Greenland is as I remember too.  Could you clarify on what you mean by Madagascar? I remember it roughly the size it is, perhaps a bit more south (directly south/east, rather than the more north, but still south/east position it is now).  India was definitely larger. I'm actually surprised at how small it is.  And Japan was definitely as you described (and I posted my own thread on this)."
MandelaEffect,37p5hw,Jaime89-,2,Mon Jun 8 00:27:06 2015 UTC,No problem. Madagascar from what I remember was smaller and more south. East of South Africa instead of East of Mozambique.  The first time I saw a world map with the alternate landmasses and islands was in 1995. The last time it still looked like that was in 2007 or early 2008. Sometime around mid or late 2008 the world map changed. The more recent change for me was india in 2013.

For reference, there was a leap second in december of 1995, december 2005, december 2008, and most recently in jun 2012.  There's more, but those are the leap seconds closest to the times you listed.  I can't say when I remember the landmasses changing, since I had always thought of them that way, and it's only recently come to my attention that they are indeed different. Definitely all before 2005ish though."

MandelaEffect,37p5hw,Kafke,1 point,Mon Jun 8 03:48:29 2015 UTC,"To give a full list, here's an entire list of leap seconds, starting from their inception in 1970:  1972-1979 (Dec) 1981-1983 (Jun) 1985 (Jun) 1987 (Dec) 1989-1990 (Dec) 1992-1995 (Jun, 95=Dec) 1997-1998 (Jun/Dec) 2005 (Dec) 2008 (Dec) 2012 (Jun) 2015 (Jun) (This one hasn't happened yet).  There's certainly quite a few. But amusingly most mandela effects line up relatively close to the leap seconds. With the 'noticing' happening a bit after from what it seems.  Given that there's quite a few of them, it could just be coincidence. But it's fun to think about. Most notably, the 90's, 2008, and 2012/2013 are the periods where most mandela effects fall."

MandelaEffect,37p5hw,Kafke,1 point,Tue Jun 9 05:46:45 2015 UTC,"See wiki.  Essentially our primary clocks that we use for keeping time (UTC) don't quite match the actual movement of the earth. So over time (randomly, and periodically) there's a slight shift and de-syncing.  We want our calendars/clocks to match up to the earth, so we need to add a ""leap second"" periodically. Which is literally just a second added to some hour in the year.  This has the side effect of messing up a lot of computer systems and servers. Which was a big deal back in 2012 (the latest leap second). Various companies have made work arounds of adding less than a second continuously, so there won't be a glitch.  The dates I listed above are all of the instances that a leap second was added. So far, there haven't been any leap seconds ""removed"" (though it's possible).  As for what makes a leap second required, people really aren't sure. There's lots of little factors that effect it, like weather, rotation slowing, the moon pulling on the earth, earthquakes, etc. Pretty much all things that aren't really predictable.  Edit: Leap seconds are added either Jun 30th or Dec 31st of the year. Those posts are dated for Jul 6 2008, which would be just a few days after the leap second addition."

Asbestos removal, the biggest environmental cleanup project in U.S. history, has cost an estimated $50 billion over the past 20 years. It has forced schools to lay off teachers, caused owners to abandon buildings and added considerably to the cost of remodeling many houses.   That was a pretty big deal in the 90s, so it would be fair to assume it was banned.  It actually is banned for most uses.

I don't discount what you remember, of course, but since you were looking for an alternate, here's my guess.  Let's see:    The most likely candidate is probably Fred Phelps.  He died in March 2014, so that's the ""big evangelical guy"" (whether you agree with his policies or not) that could have been crossed with Billy Graham this recently.  In 2013 Harold Camping passed (no where close to the same level but he was an evangelist with a talk show on the Christian music family of channels ""Family Radio"").  He predicted doomsday at least twice.  He may be familiar to religious households.  In 2012 Chuck Colson passed.  He was also an evangelist and founded BreakPoint.

Around 2013 or 2014 I was quite shocked to find out he was still alive after reading similar threads like this on other sites.  Edit* I forgot to mention there was a tribute with Bill Clinton giving a speech along with other presidents and other people. This was shortly after his death and was broadcast during the night. As for the funeral, his coffin was covered by a white sheet thing with a golden object like an eagle or something sitting on top. It was like watching a state funeral and was shown on many channels not just the news channels. The last time I read about his death was around 2001 or 2002.

I will check out the verse recommended but I am somewhat reserved in doing so. I think there is a certain conditioning with reading things in the English language and would like to get as close to the original as possible (can only really track to Hebrew and Arabic).   Too much seems to be lost in translation and the Bible has many codes which I think simply can not be deciphered appropriately using English. One word, I have found, can tell an ENTIRE story. Here is some of my prior research back in February regarding Cairo for instance:  I can link this to the deciphering of the word Al Qahira, arabic for Cairo which is capital in Egypt, that I made earlier this year (02/2015). The Arabic translation to English language of the word means Mars. Also, once breaking down by removing and rearranging letters the entire word Al Qahira along with its other known name Al Dunya tells a story. It is a big story line in and of itself.  I was exposed to the similarities of the Egyptian and ""Mars""  pyramids but have never heard of Cairo meaning Mars! As Dr Delbert states and I have confirmed that there is meaning to the words/ names. Here is a breakdown of what I saw after viewing this vid: Mars in Egypt (Al Qahira   القاهرة, omitting letters tells you what is in a name) The following is just a list of the different names that can be derived from the Arabic word Al Qahira : لقاهرة  to Cairo القارة  Continent ( Per dictionary.com  continent- a comparable landmass on another planet.) القاهر  Omnipotent القهر  Oppression رة  Rh  (""to know"" , RH blood type?)  قهر  Conquer (showing as additional name for Cairo ""Conqueror"") قهرة  Vanquish (also showing as an additional name ""Vanquisher"")   Additional words pulled from Al-Qahira which appears to tell an entire story...: اقاة     Befell, suffered by, met him قر      Poverty اهرة    Phenomenon, original sin, Majeure (closest translation French ""force majeure""-superior force, chance occurrence, unavoidable accident.)   Found additional info- Cairo also known as ""Mother of the World"" Umm Al-dunya أم الدنيا.  Pulled word DNA , الدنا , from Al-dunya. Also lower, depress,الدنيا. History in name?   ة God, millennium, god, father ,creator, maker, author    The double"" ا"" translates to لا (note in the world Al-Qahira the ة was removed which left the double changing the form). الارة Terrorism, terrorization   Also Japan still spells it Berenstein in katakana (I am not fluent in Japanese but have developed some proficiency there. This was something else I researched but I do not want to tie up this thread).  Another one I found recently looking at someone's post who thought it was not a big whoop...It is still Interview with A Vampire in French.  Language, computer or verbal seems to have significant relevance and frames one's perspective."

Twilight and Harry Potter are both popular young adult novel series; it could be that you just got confused as to who wrote them, and in an attempt to interpret your memories in light of the belief that it was Rowling, your unconscious mind came up with a false book review, possibly from half-remembered fragments of things you actually read about Twilight at some point.

MandelaEffect,36q2es,awesomeman9,2,Fri May 22 02:00:21 2015 UTC,"Technically it's: Whale: an often very large animal that lives in the ocean and that is a mammal rather than a fish  Wail: to utter a prolonged, inarticulate, mournful cry, usually high-pitched or clear-sounding, as in grief or suffering: to wail with pain.  Wale : a streak or ridge made on the skin especially by the stroke of a whip.   The last definition makes the most sense to me, and it's the spelling i've always used if that helps!"

MandelaEffect,36pz4w,bitterbrokeloser,14,Thu May 21 04:50:44 2015 UTC,"This one is easy.  Anyone who's shopped at a Payless only ever says, ""I'm going to Payless"" or ""I bought them at Payless"" without bothering to say the full name. So that's the only part of the brand that sticks in peoples' minds.  Then, there's the fact that it is a shoe store. Who's ever heard of a ""shoe source?"" No one says ""I'm going to the shoe source."" They say, ""I'm going to the shoe store.""  So people walk around thinking it's ""Payless Shoe Store"" because ""Payless"" is the only part of the brand that they recognize as the brand name, and they rely on the assumption that Payless is a shoe store."

Bart gets caught shop lifting, and the mall security guy tells him that he ""better not catch [Bart] around here ever again, capisce?"" ...which is kind of an old fashioned slang for ""understand?"" that Bart had apparently never heard before.   Because Bart didn't understand that word, later on when 'reliving' that moment in his memory, he remembered it as the mall security dude saying ""I better not catch you around here ever again, Cat Fish?"" pronounced 'feesh' to rhyme with capisce (ka-peesh). Basically, he translated it into a word he did understand.   Real people do similar things with stuff like that, so it's possible young you was just 'filling in' blanks created by misheard or misunderstood lyrics."

You've seen them ever since the internet became widely available. They told you things like ""the U.S government wouldn't spy on us"" and ""9/11 was the result of planes crashes by people in caves on the other side of the world"" (paraphrasing) and if you go back far enough that "" the Illuminati isn't real"". These statements are often followed (like a script) by ""you're a nut job"", ""put on your tin foil hat"" or ""get out of your parents basement"" and all other forms of ad hominems. They don't address the evidence/facts of your position because it isn't about convincing the author. It's about reinforcing readers or viewers brain washing so as to get them to immediately dismiss the statements being made and not do their own research.

MandelaEffect,36dggz,PringCan,1 point,Tue May 19 05:55:23 2015 UTC,"I found some interesting, although arguably circumstantial evidence from non-biblical sources. First is Carl Sagan who I feel meant well (unlike Einstein who was a deliberate deceiver) but couldn't see the entire picture because he did not have spiritual discernment. He speaks of being in a cube/tesseract and says ""I cannot show you a tesseract because I and you are trapped in three dimensions"".  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnURElCzGc0#t=424 Sagan also said ""An atheist has to know a lot more than I know. An atheist is someone who knows there is no god. By some definitions atheism is very stupid.""  Maybe that's why he was killed (oops speculation).  Einstein said (with apparently far less understanding than Sagan) ""When a smaller box s is situated, relativity at rest, inside the hollow space of a larger box S, then the hollow space of s is a part of the hollow space of S, and the same ""space,"" which contains both of them, belongs to each of the boxes."" Also ""space appears as an unbounded medium or container in which material objects swim around"".  http://everythingforever.com/einstein.htm Steven Hawking the great science fiction writer says ""But because we can warp space-time only in the future, we wouldn't be able to travel back to the present time, or earlier"". http://www.hawking.org.uk/space-and-time-warps.html This is an interesting article http://www.gizmag.com/3d-hologram-universe-laser-fermilab-experiment/33546/ This is just a Google search because it seems most physicist these days believe we're in a hologram and this post would take hours to read if I quoted it all. https://www.google.com/webhp?ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8#q=scientist+say+we%27re+in+a+hologram These are from the Illuminati Card Game. If you're not familiar with this game it has revealed the script the satanist are using numerous times. That being said, take it with a grain of salt. These cards use italics to emphasize certain words like many people do (I prefer bold or capitalized) and the words used seem carefully chosen. On the first card Time Warp, we see how the time warp has changed reality through a few examples. The words ""TRY"" and ""AGAIN"" stand out to me. http://www.911truth.ch/illuminati_card/time_warp.jpg The next card Flat Earthers, the words ""KNOW SOMETHING"" says a lot. It could have said think they know something or believe something.""Know something"" can also be interpreted as knowing the sum of things or knowing the sum of matter. Of course they included a silly cartoon map stereotype. https://hackdeeper.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/illuminati-card-flat-earthers.jpg Anyway I just thought this was interesting as I don't get my information from MSM but yet the cube/tesseract and Saturn are all over the place.

So 80%*10%=8% is the probability of surviving the suicide, while 20% is the probability of your SO living, so your expectation of them living is 20/28= ~71%.  If you can get your suicide rates better, you're less likely to face that situation in the first place.

Let's say that ""experiencing"" always continues no matter what, but that the content of the subsequent experiences is up for grabs.  So, you attempt suicide and it is definitely true that you-as-consciousness will continue to have an experience. Possibilities:   Do I experience ""resetting"" where I find it never happened? Do I experience ""waking up"" where I find I narrowly survived the attempt, everything else is the same? Do I experience a ""reset"" or ""wake up""  into a different version of this world, in line with my desires? Do I experience a ""reset"" or ""wake up"" into a different version of this world, the changes slightly randomised? Do I experience ""dying"" and then end up in another sort of world completely? Do I experience ""dying"" and then a void forever?  [Or any other sort of NDE experience]   If you don't know what governs what experience you're going to get, then ""quantum"" suicide is a risky endeavour.

MandelaEffect,35pv6i,rustybricks,10,Tue May 12 15:09:27 2015 UTC,"Here's my personal anecdote about this.  I remember when the movie was in theaters, looking at the title ""Interview with the Vampire"" and wondering, ""why is it the and not a? Who is the vampire? Aren't there more than one vampire? Wouldn't the imply that there is only one vampire? It would make more sense if it were Interview with a Vampire.""  I later learned that within the context of the interviewer Molloy's recounting of the tale, this particular vampire has personal importance to him. So the concept is not that this is an interview with just any vampire, this is the vampire whom the interviewer got to know so well. This was the vampire that made him want to become a vampire himself. To call him simply a vampire would be to deny the singular significance of this particular vampire.  But if someone is not thinking about the frame of mind of the interviewer, it definitely seems like a would be the more appropriate choice."
MandelaEffect,35pv6i,UniversalChairs,6,Tue May 12 16:49:45 2015 UTC,"I still wonder if, with this one, the 'with the' having the th sounds next to each other, is causing the mistake - it seems like people only realise the mistake after having heard the movie's name for a long time and then seeing it written.  When speaking, the th sounds can blend together, turning ""with the"" into something more like ""with uh"" which sounds like ""with a"".  And since, to many, the 'a' seems like the more logical choice rather than 'the' in the scheme, and bam.  It does seem like everyone who shares this Mandela Effect is referencing the movie rather than the book, which is where I've come up with this theory - you hear movie titles spoken in previews and discussion by various people on TV, but may not have necessarily heard a bunch of different people actually speaking about a book written in the 70s."

Even if it's thih most people speaking will still combine the th sounds so it's withih and ih could still be mistaken for a pronunciation of a.  Not to mention, at least in the US movie preview announcers (including the late great Don Lafontaine) all kind of have a generic 'American' dialect rather than a regional one, so if one is hearing things through media rather than personal word of mouth the regional dialects matter less.  This may be different in other countries; I'm not sure but it would seem like the most ""clear""/universally understood dialect would be the one chosen in these cases.  My theory is that 'with the' is the issue - you don't see the issue in 'of the' movie titles or titles with just the by itself.  And if you look into the reasoning posted by UniversalChairs in that 'a' seems to make more sense than 'the' unless you look at it through the perspective of one particular character, plus decades of hearing the title spoken rather than seen in text COULD BE causing the mistake."

It was a video that someone had uploaded with the audio and the album cover as the visuals. It had a fair amount of views but not anything too high for a singer who was quite popular. I'd say about 200k views? I specifically remember someone bitching in the comments about how people should give it a chance even though it's a different sound. Last time I heard it is a difficult question as I couldn't name the last time I heard my favourite song let alone a song that doesn't exist anymore. I'm pretty sure it was summer 2014 though as I remember being warm and associating it with my holiday/vacation.

Add this to the idea I discussed about human memory being flawed and being suggestible, particularly as time passes, and that is a perfectly logical explanation for why many if not most people remember the e instead of the a --- because those are children's books, a lot of people remembering it with an e haven't even seen or thought of one of those books in years, possibly decades.    I am not saying everything can be explained this way, but something so tiny from childhood, in my opinion, is easily explained this way.  We're talking about a single, solitary vowel in a relatively long last name with a couple other 'e's in it, written in cursive on the book's cover.  Edited: I'm not trying to say that every single individual fits into the mold I've described above, and there are some people who may have more personal empirical evidence toward the 'e' versus the 'a'.  But there are some people who haven't even thought about the Berenstain Bears in 20+ years, and for those people I will offer the alternate explanation."

Even your name, as bizarre as it is, I read it, learned it, and wrote it correctly. I didn't make up what I wanted your name to be - I just read and rewrote it like any other name, and back when we were really young, we were taught how to read words one syllable at a time - not to read what we wanted to read out of thin air for no reason. We weren't taught that and we weren't reading imaginary 'a's that weren't printed in that dimension.  2nd Paragraph But nobody was suggesting calling them ""Berenstein"", you know, except for what we read back then. I read 'stEin' with my own eyes. I am absolutely sure that that took place. There is no confusion. If I had read 'stAin' back then then it would still be 'stAin' today because I read what was there. I am not confused. You are because you don't understand that time CAN change in the case of Berenstein. It's not hard to get, really.  3rd Paragraph Yeah but there's no confusion here.

I'm southern and while they are saying ""BerenstAin"", it sounds more like a country twang than anything else and there are a lot of southern folk that pronounce vowels on a sliding scale between 'correct' and 'wtf' so I can imagine if one watched the show as a child one could be hearing stein.

Which makes more assumptions? You misremember something or come from an alternate reality? And eye witness testimony is someone's memory of an event given in court.

I know I saw them when my memory suggests I do, and so, I have to conclude that my near death experience had something to with it... But not ALL of my incorrect memories, as it's been shown, are mandela effects, and I think you're right that we should be looking as hard as we can to DISPROVE them rather than assume that they are all, in fact, the result of some weirdness.  As for the Mandela thing, the people with memories of his death have very clear memories of more than just his death, but of rampant and sweeping anarchy related to the news that rocked South Africa.  The kind of supporting memories that wouldn't make sense if they had confused the report..."

One does not have to suffocate the other. You don't have to 'address' anything - it's not going to end the world is it. It's not important to be wrong so much. It's far more important to be right. That is what people seek, not an education.   Lots of people do think it, I don't agree BUT there could be alternate Universes. Sure there could. We can't even explain dreams - which happen every night.  I think it might be something else but rather then dismiss people, it's better to ask WHY they think it."
MandelaEffect,35ec5n,michikade,1 point,Sun May 10 17:12:25 2015 UTC,Why have I and many others mistaken Interview with the vampire with interview with a vampire when this has not occurred with other similarly titled films?  Revenge of the sith. Return of the jedi. Return of the king etc etc.   Why was interview with a vampire commonly mistaken? Why so special?
MandelaEffect,35ec5n,Keresyk,6,Sun May 10 13:20:05 2015 UTC,"I think it's 'of' vs 'with' that causes the mistake.  'of the' is two distinct sounds, while 'with the' blends the th sounds together turning it more into 'with uh' which translates to 'with a' while spoken.  As for mistaking it in it's written form, I do not have an alternate explanation."
MandelaEffect,35ec5n,ishouldmakeanaccount,1 point,Sun May 10 17:43:51 2015 UTC,That's a good explanation. I'm trying to think of other films with 'with the' in the title.

I was very excited to see this movie.  Further, if I didn't see it with my ex wife in the theater I certainly didn't ever see it as my new wife hasn't seen it, so why do I remember everything about it, including the plot and many details?  That's obviously not it."
MandelaEffect,35c7r9,WiretapStudios,1 point,Tue May 12 23:18:51 2015 UTC,"Either way, you didn't see a movie before it was finished filming or post production, changes are made then that you couldn't even have advanced knowledge of, as they are added in or cut during the editing process."
MandelaEffect,35c7r9,WiretapStudios,2,Tue May 12 23:26:18 2015 UTC,"Well, then how is it I've seen it exactly?  How can you explain that I didn't see it post 2012, yet I have seen it, I have memory of seeing it, know the plot, remember most of the scenes?  I get that you don't understand how it might be possible, but, other than your argument from personal astonishment can you explain to me what logical basis you have for insisting I didn't see it when I did?  There are quite a few theories which could explain me seeing it, for example, my consciousness, which is capable of collapsing a waveform on the quantum level, is an energy field generated by the quantum machinery known as my brain.  When I had my near death experience, my body actually died and the energy field generated by that quantum machine sought out a viable alternative to attach itself to, and found my living body in another interacting universe.  After affixing itself to this new body, it's memories have started clashing with the memories from the energy field existent here, in this time and space ... In that other timeframe, the movie was completed much earlier, and, co-incidentally, the bears were called Berenstein.  How is it you can be so sure then, that I didn't see it when I remember seeing it?  You have some data indicating that my hypothesis is wrong?  EDIT: I don't know that any of what I said is true, I really have no idea why I remember seeing it with my ex wife in the theatre despite that being impossible, I just know I have a clear memory of it and I definitely didnt see it after 2012 with my new wife.  I just don't know for sure what might be going on, and I don't have a strong belief for or against the theory I put forward.  Could be, maybe not.  There are other theories which could explain this event as well.  I don't have a strong belief or disbelief in any of them, as I lack the data needed to form a solid conclusion.  Insisting something isn't true or real despite having no real basis for said insistence, only my personal feeling of ""common sense"", isn't something I care to engage in as it's akin to pseudo-skepticism."
MandelaEffect,35c7r9,TheOnlyOtherRedditor,3,Tue May 12 23:37:43 2015 UTC,"From my perspective, things like this and on this forum are where people either saw something, and then later saw a different thing and attributed it to an earlier time, or they are mistaken. Otherwise, I'd say that the mind has a nasty habit of tricking people into thinking at a later point that something happened earlier, and once it's become a fact in your mind, it's hard to question or dislodge it. Again, it's just from my perspective, but I find it a lot more probable that people are just having mental wire crossings vs. that people are seeing future movies, music, etc before they happened. I'm basing it on people who are worse off mentally, that have tons of memories of things that either didn't happen, or their mind is using as a defense mechanism to cover other traumas. There are times I swore I said or heard something in a conversation with someone else that I distinctly remember. However, with Facebook messenger, you can search your messages, and I've found several times I was actually completely wrong about how I remembered the conversation. So as far as hard data, that would be fairly impossible, but we do have data showing that people remember things differently even though they were at the same event, crime scene, childhood, etc. The data in this case is the hundreds of thousands of people who have seen this movie, vs. one (that we know of) that believes he saw it years beforehand. That's not to dump on your beliefs, but that is how everyone else knows the events to have occurred."
MandelaEffect,35c7r9,JUST_IN_UR_HED,0,Wed May 13 02:06:01 2015 UTC,"If there were any plausible way I could come up with having formed the memory of seeing this movie in the theatre with my significant other when it's impossible that I did, I'd perhaps go with what you've suggested.  My memory is very, very keen, and I use it every day at my work as a software developer to keep it that way.  There is 0 chance that my vivd recollection of seeing this exact movie in a theatre with my ex isn't because I saw this movie in the theatre with my significant other.  My current wife says she's never even seen it, let alone in the theatre with me, and we were married in 2012, and have been together since 2009.  Since I watch all the movies I see with her, the fact that she hasn't seen it means that I have to have seen it at some point prior to my relationship with her, or I wouldn't have a clear understanding of the plot, the intricate details of it's mechanics or any of the clear visual memories I have of it.  I don't know what to make of any of this, other than it's very clearly a personal kind of a mandela effect.  In the general case, no doubt, most people here are looking for justification of their false memories:  I'm not. I'm looking for a plausable explanation that ISN'T a mandela effect.  In this case one has yet to be presented, and I can't see how it possibly will be.  Your skepticism is well founded, as noted earlier, because in the general case most people's memories aren't like mine, nor are they as keenly interested in disproving things as I am."

MandelaEffect,35cs6d,islandwalking,12,Sat May 9 01:43:34 2015 UTC,Just going to say that it's absolutely possible that copies of a trailer get distributed down the media train early and can get shown either intentionally or unintentionally without much fanfare or notice. I.e. the trailer was sitting in your local broadcast station's server a few weeks early but got queued for play by accident or on purpose.
MandelaEffect,35cs6d,GothicFuck,3,Sat May 9 04:15:13 2015 UTC,Could be!

MandelaEffect,35cs6d,Jakker27,5,Sun May 10 00:50:16 2015 UTC,"Why don't you tell us what happened in the trailer? Try and be specific about details - not stuff mentioned in the plot summary - it might be worth - emailing imdb when films typically would upload a trailer. You could also try to message his PR people and see if they can shed any further light. Basically, chase it up..:) Would they usually do a trailer while it's still filming??"

MandelaEffect,35cs6d,michikade,2,Tue Jun 2 01:16:08 2015 UTC,"I can explain this. A few months back, they released a teaser clip online. I don't believe it was on TV at all though. It just listed the stars and had the logo, no actual footage yet. It sort of panned to the side or something, like animation. It may have even been a fan made one, but it was posted on a few Gawker sites."
MandelaEffect,35cs6d,michikade,1 point,Tue May 12 21:57:48 2015 UTC,"That is interesting.  Looks like the trailer was released about 3 weeks ago now but that's not to say this didn't happen, just that it does exist now (and of course your timeline notes a month or two which would predate the April 16th date I'm finding on the web)  I wonder if there was some kind of show teasing it on whatever channel you were watching?"
MandelaEffect,35cs6d,rabidoverlord,2,Sat May 9 01:59:51 2015 UTC,"Thats what I was thinking- maybe a special teaser for the channel?

MandelaEffect,35cs6d,eugd,2,Sat May 9 15:46:15 2015 UTC,It was definitely just a trailer not a making of and there and the trailers out now are just fan made (from what i've seen). But I think the most logical reason is that they did just leak it!
MandelaEffect,357ukb,theKittyKatKlub,10,Thu May 7 20:53:27 2015 UTC,ratemyprofessor.com redirects to ratemyprofessors.com so they own both domains.  Perhaps the marketing has changed to include the 'S' but both domains are theirs.
MandelaEffect,357ukb,michikade,3,Thu May 7 21:30:25 2015 UTC,"Yeah, owning both would make sense since there is little difference with our without the ""s"", and it is likely enough that they added the ""s"", I just can't find information stating the change. It's just odd to me since I have visited the site consistently and it was always ""professor"", and whenever talking about it, myself and others refer to it as ""professor"", so seeing it the current way (as minor as it is) just seems wrong."
MandelaEffect,357ukb,michikade,5,Thu May 7 21:40:09 2015 UTC,I can remember people referring to it as 'rate my professor' but I honestly don't remember if I remember the page having the s or not.  It's been since around 2003 that I've used it so I can't honestly say I remember it distinctly as one or the other.  The 's' does feel a little strange but since both domains have been in existence since April (for 's') and December (for no 's') 2001 according to whois.net it looks like 's' was always the intent and the no-s version was added probably because everyone and their dog refers to it without the s.

MandelaEffect,3566cp,UniversalChairs,12,Thu May 7 16:12:02 2015 UTC,"Here's a classic ""Mandela effect"" from way back in the 60s.  A teacher in 1969 told his students, ""Truman’s dead – I watched his funeral on television twenty years ago!"" Harry Truman died in 1972."

MandelaEffect,3566cp,TriumphantGeorge,7,Thu May 7 18:07:46 2015 UTC,"Out of curiosity I decided to double-check this.  Fiona Broome started her website mandelaeffect.com in 2010, although it's possible that she coined the term earlier. Still, the creation of the website helped popularize the term for referring to memories that conflict with reality.  Prior to that, the term ""Mandela Effect"" had other meanings entirely.  In 2000, crisisgroup.org published an article entitled ""The Mandela Effect: Prospects for Peace in Burundi.""   In 2002, The Economist published an article entitled ""The Mandela effect"" with the lede ""Nelson Mandela, South Africa’s former president, is trying to shift the current government’s awful AIDS policy.""  Pretty much prior to 2010, any time someone used the phrase ""Mandela Effect"" it was almost exclusively pertaining to the influence of Nelson Mandela as a leader, not conflicting memories about when he died."
MandelaEffect,3566cp,UniversalChairs,5,Thu May 7 18:18:45 2015 UTC,"Your explanation seems right to me. But it's in the nature of the effect that, if real,  different people might have different histories of the ""Mandela Effect"" also."
MandelaEffect,3566cp,TriumphantGeorge,3,Thu May 7 18:21:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah, there's no arguing that.  If someone believes that they came from a world where we lived on planet Farth, that we had always lived on planet Farth, that a meteor destroyed Farth and that we all jumped to a universe in which the planet has always been called Earth and that all evidence to the contrary has been destroyed, there's really no refuting that belief."
MandelaEffect,3566cp,UniversalChairs,5,Thu May 7 18:31:32 2015 UTC,"It applies generally: An effect/glitch where there is evidence of a before/after isn't an effect/glitch. Only the memories remain as evidence of the person's personal trajectory.  It can't be proven objectively. We can't prove a fact-flexible world, except to ourselves (maybe)."
MandelaEffect,3566cp,TriumphantGeorge,3,Thu May 7 18:35:16 2015 UTC,"That's a good one. But then how would you explain the apparently selective effects? Only some people remembers things differently.You'd suppose that everyone would have strange memories if the entire universe was annihilated.  Possibly only more ""sensitive"" or ""enlightened"" people remember the old world?"
MandelaEffect,3566cp,Scroon,3,Thu May 7 20:14:49 2015 UTC,"it's based on the multi-world interpretation of Quantum Physics-  it says there are parallel universes-  each slightly different to our own.   And there are copies of ourselves in each.  But we are apparently only conscious in one of them,  and the idea is if you die in one, then your consciousness could choose to branch into a universe where your death didn't happen (see the Quantum Suicide experiment).  So then if everybody dies in one because something apocalyptic happened, then all of them could suddenly move into a different universe/timeline with different memories.  It's all highly speculative, because we don't know if the multiworld interpretation is correct,  we don't know if you could jump timelines if you get to retain your memory of the previous timeline, or if your memory would change to match your new timeline."

I think that our senses have been fucked with for a very long time and it relates to the nature of ourselves and reality. Is it possible for people  at key moments to see the same thing but be shown different things? There is no question about it and with there being 7billion people on this planet, psychology is vital to understanding and predicting response. Predicting response is childs play. You as a person might be headstrong but you would be shocked at how easy it is to trick the masses. That is only IF you allow yourself to be told what is rather then find the truth for yourself. Unless we come together, we may never find the truth in this lifetime. But even if you are wrong or others disagree, at least you are thinking! Think what you like but have an open mind still. Nothing wrong in being wrong in the pursuit of the truth and greater understanding. If a heart beats, you have to beat with it. If a world spins, you had better spin with it.

There was a special issue of RealityShifters in July 2005 with a survey of Mandela Effect people (aka: ""Alive Again"" phenomena), and 26% of people surveyed mentioned Bob Keeshan (""Captain Kangaroo"") being alive again at that time, with 15% mentioning Jane Goodall, 15% mentioning Larry Hagman, 10% mentioning Bob Hope, and 10% recalling Jack Palance had died before 2005."

But the main character does have/use something similar.   In a very first episode a main character remembers being at a lecture that was actually cancelled and notices a living girl he saw dead before and in a second episode he remembers John Titor from 2000 and is surprised to discover he is just popping onto a world scene in 2010 and things associated with the Mandela Effect do not stop there?    Nothing to do with the Mandela effect. These are actually parts of the story, which revolve around time travel. To give a little spoiler, the Main character (labcoat crazy scientist guy) has something called the ""reading steiner"" which gives him an ability which would look like the mandela effect.   And how thought provoking is Steins if a Berenstein to Berenstain switch is arguably a most widely accepted Mandela Effect change?   Steins;Gate was a VN before an anime, and was made well before the Berenstein/stain thing took place.  AKA, it doesn't have much to do with the Mandeal effect, unless you consider the mandela effect to be equivalent to the reading steiner (the ability to remember when you switch timelines)."
MandelaEffect,3558py,Kafke,2,Thu May 7 22:41:55 2015 UTC,"You might be much more familiar with Steins;Gate than me, but what do you define as the Mandela Effect if Steins;Gate has nothing to do with it? What if there's Mandela Effect stuff in reality that's the result of time travel?"
MandelaEffect,3558py,Kafke,1 point,Fri May 8 01:29:39 2015 UTC,"but what do you define as the Mandela Effect if Steins;Gate has nothing to do with it?   Strictly speaking, the Mandela effect is many people remembering the same event, which actually happened differently.  Steins;Gate doesn't really have anything to do with that, rather, it's about a guy who Time Travels. The guy simply remembers the old timelines that he used to be in. At the beginning of the anime there's a bit of confusion, since he accidentally stumbles upon it, and didn't realized he time traveled.   What if there's Mandela Effect stuff in reality that's the result of time travel?   That's a possibility. But the Mandela Effect need not be necessarily caused by Time Travel.  It's also worth noting that in Steins;Gate, only the main character (the guy actually time traveling) can remember things.  Either way, the anime is not about the Mandela Effect, but due to the nature of the Mandela effect, one explanation can be time travel. Clear difference.  Another big difference is that Mandela effect necessarily needs many people. While in Steins;Gate most people don't remember anything.  So... not really the same thing, even though they appear similar."

You might have been critical with an initial post, but how interesting if there has been some recent theorizing regarding a connection between the Mandela Effect and CERN?"
MandelaEffect,3558py,falling_into_fate,1 point,Fri May 8 05:41:52 2015 UTC,"Did Fiona really say that it must refer to something remembered by many people?   No clue. I'm just aware ""mandela effect"" refers to a collective memory, not an individual one. Otherwise we'd just call it a false memory (like we usually do). The interesting part is that multiple people remember it. Individually. And Steins;Gate isn't really like that, nor does that really have anything to do with the story.  Though, I don't blame him for bringing it up, since I said something similar when I first found out about the mandela effect.   but how interesting if there has been some recent theorizing regarding a connection between the Mandela Effect and CERN?   Well specifically the CERN references in steins;gate was due to Steins;Gate playing off John Titor's story. John Titor himself also makes an appearance in the anime. So if you want to point out Steins;Gate as having something to do with it, you're really looking at the John Titor story (Steins;Gate introduced the ""reading steiner"", while John Titor had the original story they are basing off of, as well as the CERN thing). And John Titor happened back in 2000. Again, well before the whole Mandela Effect thing.  It's also worth noting (before conspiracy theorists grab a hold of this), that the John Titor story has been debunked."
MandelaEffect,3558py,phoenix616,1 point,Fri May 8 05:48:00 2015 UTC,"What the heck, what if John Titor's the reason for us, since I had and know plenty who have had these events well before 2010, in fact mine actually started in 2000 as well as others posting about it in other forums since 2000!!!"

MandelaEffect,353gao,BlueAnt138,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:07:58 2015 UTC,"True, but it's so hard to prove..   We have the internet now, we can swap notes on our memories and that could make it look like Mandela effects are increasing when it's just us finding more commonalities.  My original idea depends on certain things being true:  the Many-worlds Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics has to be the correct interpretation.  Also the concept of Quantum Suicide/immortality must be true.   If you die in one timeline, you continue to live in another.  Finally, the risks of the LHC must be real risks.   This is hard to evaluate as you get different answers depending on who you listen to.  And of course it's human nature to downplay the risk of something you spent billions building...  Anyway if all three of those are true, then LHC could cause Mandela effects..   But there's one more factor..  If you jump timelines, would you remember the timeline you came from, or would your memories change to match the timeline?   I don't think we could answer that either."

The answer might be within the Mandela Effect itself. A fair number of people would not remember the change, while another portion would - at least bits and pieces. This necessitates the assumption that ""mind"" is somehow separate from ""brain"" and that some people are more in touch with mind rather physical brain processes.  I'm going to start compiling a database of all the reported Mandela Effects. If this is a result of the Hadron Collider, you would expect to see a growing accumulation of effects while the collider is operational."

It’s been said that the LHC has the capacity to destroy the universe if used improperly. It’s also supposed that we live in a multiverse. What I propose is that the LHC IS destroying universes (hence the statue of Shiva destroyer or world’s outside of CERN) and that every time a universe is destroyed our souls are merged with a universe that wasn't and we carry on only from time to time noticing differences between our own personal memories and what is in recorded history."

They are saying it isn't without any analysis, and you're saying it is without much, at least on the surface that's how it appears.  If you say it was clearly not a second run theatre, I accept that.  But for us not to do our due dilligence and suggest it to you so we can all be certain that it is a legit mandela moment would be lax on all of our parts.

Even before this started happening I was very interested in how different maps showed us our world. However, when I say that things are not where I remember them I mean Google Earth.  I'm pretty sure that the satellite projections and images haven't been that historically inaccurate. I LOVE google earth. I like to search for little tiny islands in the middle of no where and zoom in and see if there is anyone living there and if there are roads. It's my way of exploring the world virtually.  I had a boyfriend whose parents lived in Indonesia and an ex-bf that I webcam dated that lived in Australia. I spent a bit of time day dreaming about potential trips. My ex bf thats parents were expats in Indonesia (father works for Nike) would show me all of the places he had been in that area. It just looks so different now. Too close to Indonesia and Papua New Guinea. Yes there is some size differences I'm noticing too, but it's mostly the placement.  Another thing with the bears. I had a mug that my mom got from Princess House Crystal as a prize. It had the words 'ice cold milk' on the side. It was a Berenstein bears mug and I used that thing for years. So my memories of the bears is not from only being a child, but also as a 20 yr old using this mug. I'm one of those people that examines things as I'm eating breakfast. I read all of the ingredients on breakfast cereals and examine the art. I would examine that mug too the same way.  Now for my grandparents. We had their 55th wedding anniversary last year. They have always lived together. My grandpa recently passed away (Oct 2014) and we were all devastated. My grandmother was especially affected.  When he died they were married.. they are still married in my eyes. This strange document though says they are not and I can't find any other document that says that they re-married.     We are a pretty close family. My family has pretty small generation gaps. I'm a little bit older 35. I know about other weird family things.. just not this one until now. Again this may just be a weird family secret that no one talks about, but no one has ever even hinted at it."

If I notice something doesn't add up I research it. When I notice something is broken I try to fix it.   I started programing when I was 7. I've been in IT for over 10 years. I have a degree. (which i guess doesn't prove anything lol).   I don't buy into many conspiracy theories. I don't think that this is some secret government plan. I like movies about them, but it's fantasy.. I love the fantasy.  If there is a theory that seems reasonable I research it from as many sources as I can find and usually I still don't buy it then.  The point is that I question things. I even question myself when my thoughts appear to be crazy or not quite right. I can accept the logical conclusion that I am just remembering things wrong. This frightens me as much as any other theory. Especially since I don't appear to be the only one with a bad memory of a lot of the same things. I've read a lot about how memory can be affected by outside things and is somewhat dynamic. It's scary that it feels SO real.  I've worked with people that have thought that the government was controlled by reptiles, that thought they could move things with their minds, and had delusions of grandeur. I thought they were batshit crazy. It scares the FUCK of me that I could potentially be nuts like those people. I don't talk to people about this anymore.

George Washington Carver was always explained as the man that was responsible for peanut butter, printer ink, etc.   Eli Whitney had created the cotton gin.  Peanut butter and the cotton gin were always big topics in black history month.  Now I can kinda see where maybe there was some confusion by me (or by my educators). It appears a man named Joe who was a slave was actually the person that came up with the idea for the gin. So it was actually invented by a black man, however Eli took credit. Now maybe somewhere along the way it merged into what I believe. I do remember a picture of Eli Whitney as a black man that looked nothing like George Washington Carver."

MandelaEffect,34zdsd,Asmodiar_,2,Wed May 6 05:22:33 2015 UTC,"I first noticed it when I was still with my ex-fiance. Little things were a bit different. She wore her hair down more than usual, but claimed she always did. Her car had a odd rattle once or twice and she commented that I needed to fix it again, when I never worked on her car before. One big thing was she was adamantly against drugs prior to the accident, but then after a few weeks past, she asked if we could smoke some weed. I was blown away because  for one, she could lose her job because they drug test (she was a O.R. tech) and second, she was previously, completely against it. Another big one is that EVERYONE is surprised I'm left handed. Mom, Dad, friends, etc. Always have been left handed.  After all that happened and we split up, there were small details I couldn't have just remembered incorrectly. I met a old friend who I knew growing up that was talking about how we played baseball together, but I remember he went into football and I stayed in baseball. He didn't play after we were 14, but he started recounting memories that I don't remember.    I have, on a regular basis, moments of deja vu where I can tell people what will happen next and I would say honestly 7/10 times I'm right, but its never a big thing, just a ""watch out for that biker."" type of thing.   I can think of at least two true ""Mandela Effects"". First being that , as was previously stated by others on this subreddit, I very clearly remember seeing Halleys comet. Im 23 and was born in 1991, I remember walking outside with my dad and him saying "" now get a good look at it, because you won't see it again in this lifetime."" Second being that Gary Coleman died in the fall of 2008. It was a talked about a lot while I was in highschool. Teachers talked about every show he was in and showed a few clips when students didn't know who he was. It stopped after a day or two, but I remember it clearly.   Its late here, like 3:30 am, so its kinda hard to go back, but I know there are way more things.   I have two strange, but honest opinions of what happened to me. I think the me from that universe ( the one typing now ) was supposed to die in the river after my foot broke, but somehow the me from this one took my place. Like the worst timing to swap universes ever. I think I came back to this one ( his ) and he died in mine. Which to me is depressing, because the family I actually know thinks I'm dead. ( but getting into the parallel universe and the im not really dead gets really deep really quick. And even though technically my family is my family... ) My second theory is maybe when we die, we just bounce to another universe where we didn't (makes less sense, but I kinda like this one.) So if we see someone die in a car wreck, they are dead here, but their consciousness moves to another one where they lived from the wreck. So everyone lives their whole life until old age, but whether or not we see it is a different story. Why else would I have lived after having a broken foot, being in freezing water, too exhausted to move, but somehow out of sheer luck, finding a branch (which quite frankly, I doubt it was there before) to pull myself to shore into my tent and patch myself up. I can't describe to you the fear I had or how bad it really was out there that I shouldn't be alive, but I am. Drowning is my biggest fear, and I lived, somehow."

Like, for example, I would buy those scratch off lottery tickets and win 9 times out of ten.

Orenthal James Simpson, et al.) was a criminal case prosecuted in 2007–2008 in the U.S. state of Nevada, primarily involving the retired American football player, O. J. Simpson, concerning a robbery.  On the night of September 13, 2007, a group of men led by Simpson entered a room in the Palace Station hotel in Las Vegas, Nevada. Bruce Fromong, a sports memorabilia dealer, testified that the group of men broke into his hotel room and stole various sports memorabilia at gunpoint.  Three days later, on September 16, 2007, Simpson was arrested for his involvement in the robbery and held without bail.  He admitted taking the items, which he said had been stolen from him, but denied breaking into the room. Simpson also denied the allegation that he or the people with him carried weapons.    October 3, 2008—exactly 13 years to the day after he was acquitted of the murders of his wife, Nicole Brown, and Ronald Goldman—Simpson was found guilty of all ten charges. On December 5, 2008, Simpson was sentenced to 33 years in prison with eligibility for parole in nine years (in October 2017). He is currently incarcerated at the Lovelock Correctional Center in Lovelock, Nevada.

Without EXTRAORDINARY evidence (anecdotal evidence is not in fact evidence at all) then we must go for the likely explanation .Shifting time lines or alternate worlds will never be the likely explanation.

We've known that Halley's Comet returns every 75-76 years for over the last 200 years, and there have been records of its appearance recorded for over 2000 years!  Hale Bopp, on the other hand, was remarkable for being one of the brightest comets ever observed, and for how long it stuck around. Hale Bopp was visible for over 18 months! It was this green smudge in the sky, visible day or night, throughout the year of 1997 and into part of 1998.

Two days before I saw this thread, which means over a week after you posted it, I googled Jeff. At the time I wasn't aware that he was dead. This MAY be a freshly constructed false memory, but I think the search turned up pictures of a guy I took to be an older version of him. He had light brown hair, cut short-ish but still sticking up a bit. I think there was a picture of him in a hat as well. I wouldn't say he had wrinkles, exactly, but he had developed a few lines on his face. It was most pronounced when he smiled. I have a feeling there was some light blue in one of the color pics, either something he was wearing, or the background. Does this sound like the guy you saw?  I'm entirely open to the possibility that these were pictures of a different person. It would seem like a logical solution, but now I can't find them."
MandelaEffect,33uwcv,ohohomestuck,1 point,Thu May 14 17:33:52 2015 UTC,"It was probably a different person. Older Jeff had longer dark hair, obvious wrinkles and I'm pretty sure he had brown eyes."

Can you remember if that song sounded different back ""where you're from"", and in what way?  And yes, he definitely had brown eyes. ;)"

Since this happened I started listening to his music but it's like I'm torturing myself by doing so. I keep thinking he's alive but then I remember he's not and it makes me sad and confused at the same time.

You seem to have this narrowed down to a few weeks where you were in a +Jeff universe, and are now in a -Jeff universe.  Maybe you are just the first to notice, and others will start noticing that particular change soon.    You could even do some interesting statistical models based on the rate at which people notice from this point forward.

Something didn't seem right about a certain scene.  Towards the end of the movie (in the theater version), when Will Smith and Jeff Goldblum are stuck in the alien mother ship, they launch a nuke.  After the chase scene and whatever else, they show a close up of the nuke.  It's counting down - 3,2,1 - and then this little LCD or something lights up.  It showed a skull and crossbones before detonation.  In the VHS/DVD version, this doesn't happen.  It just counts down - 3,2,1 - FLASH - detonation.   This has bothered me for a long time.

MandelaEffect,33hd9y,UniversalChairs,3,Wed Apr 22 15:20:06 2015 UTC,"In most American dialects, Sixth sounds almost exactly like six, but with a short, un-stressed th at the end. Like this.  Twelfth is similar. The first part of the word rhymes with elf, and again there's a short and unstressed th at the end."
MandelaEffect,33hd9y,michikade,1 point,Wed Apr 22 15:27:22 2015 UTC,"Hm. Obviously makes sense.  But as I say it's not as much about the pronunciation here, I just can't wrap my head around spelling something so common wrong my entire life.    I'd love to hear from other Brits on the matter, I can't be alone on this!"
MandelaEffect,33hd9y,Roril,3,Wed Apr 22 15:33:49 2015 UTC,"In my world it's always been twelfth and as discussed earlier it's pronounced that way as well, which I understand how weird that seems to sound.

MandelaEffect,33feo6,adescuentechable,3,Wed Apr 22 02:02:42 2015 UTC,I always remembered it as two n's.  I remember when I first learned his name after American Pie I thought the spelling was a bit odd.
MandelaEffect,33feo6,creesa,5,Wed Apr 22 03:34:45 2015 UTC,Most people spell Sean with one N. So I can see why two Ns seems odd. It's a very non-standard spelling. But it seems even stranger to me that someone would allege they have a very clear memory of the actor's name being spelled the normal way and then suddenly changing.   What's far more likely is that you simply never really looked carefully at the spelling of his name until recently.

MandelaEffect,32uno1,BeholdMyResponse,9,Thu Apr 16 22:14:57 2015 UTC,"Orphan Black is most certainly a Canadian show.  It is made by a well-known Canadian TV production company (Temple Street Productions), in association with BBC America, which airs the show in the US (the series airs on Space in Canada).  Here's a bit about the setting from the Wikipedia page:   Orphan Black is shot on location in Toronto, Ontario. This is apparent from details such as cars with Ontario licence plates, Beth's Ontario driving licence, Mrs. S having an Ontario driving licence, the colour of currency, scripted references to the suburb of Scarborough, Ontario, and a plane ticket in the pilot episode identifying Toronto Pearson International Airport. Toronto's Bridgepoint Health and Don Jail are stand-ins for the exterior of the ""Dyad Institute"". Scenes set in the Scarborough suburb where Alison lives are actually filmed in Markham, Ontario, another Toronto suburb. However, details like currency are often deliberately obscured, the train station in the pilot announces a next stop as ""New York"", and American pronunciations of words like ""lieutenant"" are used.    Graeme Manson said that the setting is deliberately ambiguous. ""It’s meant to be Generica. It’s part of the price you pay for this kind of co-production."" John Fawcett concurred, arguing that ""To be honest, we don't want to say we're American and alienate the Canadians, or say we're Canadian and alienate the Americans. The bottom line is we're one big happy family. We're just a little bit further North than you.""   As for the anime thing, I have no clue.  I'd never heard of Orphan Black before the show.

Another interesting point, though unrelated to the show's Canadian origin: Sarah's ex, Vic, is played by Michael Mando, most famous for playing the voice of (and either being the physical model for, or basing his physical appearance - in the areas he has control over - on) Vaas Montenegro from Far Cry 3."

MandelaEffect,32uno1,Roril,3,Thu Apr 16 23:22:05 2015 UTC,Why do you say that? Google admits that they customize autocomplete results to individual interests.  https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/106230?hl=en   The search queries that you see as part of Autocomplete are a reflection of the search activity of users and the content of web pages. You may also see predictions from:  Relevant searches you’ve done in the past (if you’re signed in and have Web & App Activity turned on)   And I'm not sure how else you'd explain the differences in results that people get.
MandelaEffect,32uno1,BeholdMyResponse,2,Thu Apr 16 23:54:30 2015 UTC,I get plenty of stuff I've never seen before in my autocompletes so I don't know why Google said that.

MandelaEffect,32uno1,BeholdMyResponse,3,Fri Apr 17 00:53:34 2015 UTC,"No, he's right about that. (Not about the show being American, though) You might think that when Google autocompletes several words, it still means that a number of people have searched for that string of words before.  While it still does that if it recognizes that you're typing a known string, if you start to add words that don't necessarily belong in the string, it will just autocomplete the individual word you're working on, starting with words you've searched before.    In this case it probably autocompleted ""Orphan Black"" when you were three letters in, and when you typed ""A-N"" it suggested ""anime"", probably because you've searched for that word before.    Hope this helps.  I'm not a professional autocomplete technician so this is just based on my observations of how it works."

Let me share with you my own personal little Mandela Effect, and then I will tell you why I have so much doubt in it as a whole.  So I was reading this subreddit and someone pointed out that he thought the Columbine School shooting happened in 1996 instead of 1999. Now that got me thinking. I had a vivid memory of it happening in 1995! What? How could that possibly be if it happened in 1999? Am I actually experiencing the Mandela Effect for the first time?  So I thought about what I knew. I tried to remember exactly what happened. It was April. I had stayed home from school sick because I had hay fever, which I often get in the spring. I remember hearing my mom crying from downstairs. I went down to see what was wrong. I remember a lot of police on the television. My mom sobbing. Me asking her what was wrong. She said a lot of people died. Hmmmm...  Now that couldn't have happened in 1999, because I lived with my father then, not my mother. So how did I get this false memory? Did I actually change timelines or something similar?   But then I thought about it some more. If all else was the same, what could be different. Was that actually the Columbine School shooting I saw? Or was it something else entirely and my memory was at fault? That's when I remembered. On April 19, 1995, there was the Oklahoma City bombing! I had gotten the two events mixed up because the timing was so similar. Mystery solved.  So I feel like a lot of the events or memories people have are similar to this. They just got some memories confused with each other because of similar circumstances. And the worst part is, the more people who talk about it, the more people who think to themselves that maybe it really did happen that way. The power of suggestion goes a long way. It can even make you think entirely false memories. That's why I think a lot of people go ""Oh yeah I remember it that way too!"" Merely seeing the new way they believe an event occurred or the spelling of a word or the lyrics of a song, they come to believe it was always that way. Memory is a funny and tricky thing.  Well that's my two cents on the topic. I have no problem with others believing what they want, it's pretty harmless in the end. This is just my own reason for not believing in the Mandela Effect."
MandelaEffect,32t8z0,Lady_of_the_Lakes,2,Thu Apr 16 18:01:32 2015 UTC,"The same thing happened to me.  Whenever people spoke about 9/11, I remembered myself coming home from work at the gym, turning on the TV and seeing it on the news.  Then one day I realised, ""Wait a minute, I didn't work at the gym in 2001.  I didn't start working there until years later!""  I thought about it some more and finally remembered it wasn't 9/11 I'd seen on the news after coming home from the gym, but the 7/7 London bombings."
MandelaEffect,32t8z0,PhiWeaver,1 point,Sat Apr 18 17:53:55 2015 UTC,I remember Columbine being 1997.
MandelaEffect,32t8z0,Jakker27,2,Sun Apr 19 14:05:15 2015 UTC,"I think that this world is misunderstood. We're not in the looking glass partaking in it. We are on the outside of the glass looking in to what we think is real. This effect is caused by Inter dimensional beings and humans. Now does that make me crazy or drive me crazy? No. But people want the truth? Because it's stranger then fiction and yes that was the name of a film.   We know that if you see something strange and someone else is in the vacinity, that you will ask if they saw it. More often then not, thats the safe bet. Others would just react.   We know that if you watch a film but then the same thing happens to you, people will think the film influenced you or the book influenced you or the audio or the magazine or your friends etc.   So we have a world where people intermingle. No one knows jack, but if you've lots of friends and alls well? Lifes great! Why would you care why we are here? What this place is?   People only think it's Earth, because it's called earth. People only think they're human because they told they are human or people. It's your ID card. But what if you are not human?   I could go to my friend? But I know he will think i'm nuts. Why? Cause no one else is saying it.   This mandela effect, some people put it down to bad memory? I've seen people laughing at Cats that look freaked out at something. It's like they are oblivious to the fact cats have a greater sense of hearing/perception.   This effect creates ripples of doubt in peoples psyche. When we saw the BS about the dress on the news, some people shrugged their shoulders. It's just a dress!!   But if you extrapolate from that the question: Why have the media clung to this story? This must surely happen everyday...  People trying to get the effect or understand need to start with people, behaviours and psychology. They need to look into nature and see what little we know. Nature is not out everyday lives (for most of us). There's shape shifting in nature but if you watch Star Trek, you might think it's magic.   I think it's an attack on the self. I see people and wince because there's so little originality and so many have sold out. Lots of people will never have an original thought. Some people say something because in their head it sounds cool. Some people smoke because they were led to believe smoking was cool, like dentists would give you sweets as kids to fuck your teeth and get your money back - under the guise that it's all nice and sweet   There are honest people here and there are liers. You know what you know. It's created a condition in some that says we've bad memories. We're 'humans' tied into the definition - we're imperfect.   Some people are dominated by the left brain hemisphere and some are in the right. People need to balance both to be able to think properly. If you are imbalanced, it will lead to behaviors as opposed to rational thought and that is why people are attacked left right and centre. Respect one another. Understand our perceptions are our own and that humans have been studied forever. Someone/something is playing everyone to create doubt in people. If you doubt your selves, you will always be talked out of something.  You will never see the wood through the trees.  Some people might not experience it because their awareness might not be awake yet. Some people will and people should respect that. This life revolves around everyone, not just you or I. Divide and conquer. Do people think these things have no intention? It's a complete lack of understanding.   Every situation is unique. Not everyone on reddit is who they claim to be. Bear that in mind. I saw it first hand with that quote of Lord Of The Rings. People trying to create doubt in others. You see people losing their shit. But there will always be things you are 100% sure of and I ended up being right because I trusted my instinct. I think instinct in people, is overlooked - especially in people with closed minds.  I think that lots of things are engineered. I think that a blind spot was found ages ago and they wanted to try to trick all the senses and it's a hobby to them.  Ps: One final thing. To ask the question, you have to take all else into consideration first. If we don't, we don't really really get it. Like I could question Space and someone could say ""Well, don't you think we've the technology!?"" - How do you react to it? How we react is important. So I say, do you think it stops at science? Space Exploration? If it were me and I were a bastard? I would reason that the media in them days was a joke. Video/Picture quality wasn't there.  I would make a studio and I would take peoples money filling them with a fantasy and you know what would happen? Some would believe it and some wouldn't. This is exactly the behavior we have now but we know that because we know our behavior, don't we. This is no different. So ask yourselves, why would something want each and everyone of you to go crazy or doubt yourself? :) It's an important question. Why is money so important? Why are we unable to change society? Why do people work for much of their lives and they don't want too? Why?   Know what you know and empower yourself with what you know. If you're not sure, you are not sure. Observe it and move on"

MandelaEffect,32mqt5,blindtosee,0,Wed Apr 15 03:12:20 2015 UTC,"True, true.  Though, in all fairness, maybe the phenomenon could be possible- a sort of subtle dimensional slip- in a theoretical sense. Probably not, but I don't know all that much about physics so...Who am I to say?  God it depresses me to know this is a term IRL. Then, again, it's less depressing than the fact that most people in my town probably don't even know who Nelson Mandela is."
MandelaEffect,32mqt5,StrykerWyfe,3,Wed Apr 15 03:21:03 2015 UTC,"Nelson was top news for decades in my country anyway (he diead a couple times and was released a couple times in my world), I have never heard of a ""Steve Biko"".  Skimmed the Glitch subreddit and it seems to be weather phenomena and yoda hovering and stuff? seems unrelated to Mandela Effects."
MandelaEffect,32mqt5,StrykerWyfe,6,Thu Apr 23 15:42:05 2015 UTC,"I thought the point of The Mandela Effect was exactly this....that while people can seem to perceive a particular thing in two opposing ways, for the most part they are instances of misremembering, mishearing or confusion and specifically not actual glitches. Just a phenomenon that is so widespread it demonstrates well how we can vary in our view of the world, which is in itself interesting to debate.  That is at least how I've always viewed this sub, and why I thought it was separated out from Glitch. :)"
MandelaEffect,32mqt5,kraftlos,-1,Wed Apr 15 03:16:34 2015 UTC,"But, it isn't really separate from /r/Glitch_in_the_Matrix, because Glitch is linked in the side bar. And, besides that, what you're saying is not reflected in the language of this sub. I just read a post where the last line was: ""Mandela Effect or poor memory?"", which clearly reflects the delineation between the proposed ""Mandela Effect"" and misremembering/mishearing/confusion which defines this entire sub.  Besides that, the sidebar does not at all address the possibility that the ""Mandela Effect"" is the result of misremembering, mishearing or confusion. It simply states that some people experience ""this"" and some people experience ""that"". That is not the same as saying ""for years I thought this thing, and it turned out to be another thing"" or ""I remembered something wrong"". Instead, it implies to me that two people can experience two different realities at the same time."
MandelaEffect,32mqt5,kraftlos,3,Wed Apr 15 03:29:26 2015 UTC,"Totally get that....just meant that I've never viewed it that way and given that so many submissions are so obviously not glitchy, it seems more a commentary on a social phenomenon and I thought most people probably saw it that way too. Wasn't disagreeing....just pontificating :)"
MandelaEffect,32mqt5,kraftlos,-1,Wed Apr 15 04:06:11 2015 UTC,"I understand where you are coming from, but I disagree in the thinking that most people view it the way you do. I'd tend to think most people would connect it with Glitch, as it started there. The phenomenon became too popular and was overwhelming Glitch, which is why there is a subreddit dedicated to it (not because it was deemed inappropriate for/different from Glitch).  I appreciate your point of view, Stryker, but unfortunately I don't think it is as common as you think it as, and it certainly would not appear to be the point of view of the sub."
MandelaEffect,32mqt5,idwthis,3,Wed Apr 15 04:19:56 2015 UTC,The reason the name stuck is probably because it's the original example of the phenomenon.  Keep in mind that the people who coined the term don't believe it's a case of misremembering.
MandelaEffect,32mqt5,DictatorKris,-6,Wed Apr 15 07:12:19 2015 UTC,"But, it isn't an actual case of the phenomenon...That's my whole point...The reason they don't believe it's a case of misremembering is probably because they don't know who Steve Biko is which only further proves my point."

MandelaEffect,32djy1,UniversalChairs,8,Mon Apr 13 01:37:22 2015 UTC,"When a film is still in production, it's quite common to not only produce alternate endings, but to produce lots of alternate versions of other scenes.  A few years ago I attended a production feedback screening of Ron Howard's 2011 film The Dilemma starring Vince Vaughn and Kevin James. The film was not yet finished, so what we saw was a bizarre, almost schizophrenic-feeling movie. Some scenes were shot to give it an almost slapstick feel like they were aiming for something in the vein of The Hangover while others went unsettlingly dark. After filling out my survey of what I watched I walked out of that theater wondering how they would ever manage to stitch that thing into a cohesive story. I haven't seen the finished version, and I almost don't want to because I know I'll never see the version I saw again."
MandelaEffect,32djy1,ShinyHitmonlee,4,Mon Apr 13 16:18:00 2015 UTC,"The very first time I saw Pulp Fiction, it was on broadcast television, which made for an understandably unique experience. Aside from the lack of swearing, they had to cut a bunch of scenes, so they added almost every deleted scene back into the movie. Now my favorite dialogue sequence from the film was the ""Elvis/Beatles person"" scene, and people used to look at me like I was nuts before the DVD era happened."
MandelaEffect,32djy1,UniversalChairs,1 point,Tue Apr 14 05:47:34 2015 UTC,That sounds like a really odd experience indeed.
MandelaEffect,32djy1,Roril,3,Mon Apr 13 21:10:11 2015 UTC,"Also, it was at such an early phase in the editing process that there was an entire scene that was literally a still image of a plane in the sky with a giant Getty Images watermark across it, while the actors read their voice-overs. Seeing that on a film in a theater was pretty trippy and hilarious.   I just remembered this one part where Vince Vaughn's character is smashing up this car, and it begins in a kind of ""haha this movie is crazy"" feel, but then he continues to kick and pound on this car, getting increasingly emotional until you're watching this character just releasing some kind of deeply tortured rage into this car for an amount of time that just seemed to keep going and going. I'd be curious to see which part of that whole range was used in the final edit."

Just a theory, but in that particular case that's what I would say."
MandelaEffect,32djy1,stunspot,2,Wed May 6 03:05:46 2015 UTC,There are 3 endings. In one he is a ghost. In one his wife hears the recording and in another she does not hear the recording. Love the movie even if finding the 2nd ending shocked me a bit.
MandelaEffect,32djy1,stunspot,1 point,Sun May 10 03:52:04 2015 UTC,There's also a fourth alternate ending where after Mike's death his agent receives the manuscript about 1408 that Mike had mailed to him in his escape vision.
MandelaEffect,32djy1,lxapocryphaxl,2,Sun Jul 5 05:44:06 2015 UTC,"Funnily enough, I watched 1408 last week and was very confused that the ending was now different to the ending I saw years ago (he lived in the first version, he was a cigarette smoking ghost in the second).  Reasons for alternate endings more generally:   An ending had a bad screen-test and got reshot, or  Multiple endings were shot at the time of production due to the studio being uncertain about the script - giving them a safety net in case the director's more ambitious choice didn't work out. The eventual ending of the final film is based on screen-tests and studio/talent politics and power-plays, or Sometimes changes are made to get a lower certification, hence a wider audience and more tickets sold. The uncut version becomes available later.   It doesn't just apply to endings, but to any part of a film. However, changes of endings tend to be more memorable to an audience since that's what defines what the film ""meant"".  Classic example involves all the different versions of Blade Runner. Because it went over budget, Ridley Scott lost editorial control and so after it confused test-audiences the financiers could force him and Mike Deeley to add a ""happy ending"" (involving unused scenic footage from The Shining) and add ""film noir"" narration to make it easier to follow - but unfortunately also change the whole mood and meaning of the film.  TL;DR: Always watch the Final Cut version of Blade Runner. :-)"

I seem to remember the reason was because South Park was computerized animation, whereas Simpsons was still old school, and the writers and the creator Matt Groening said it would be hard for Simpsons to stay relevant since South Park could do the fancy shmancy quick editing to fit in relevant to that week/month news/pop culture references/whatever into its newest episodes. But Simpsons couldn't do that since stuff was still hand drawn and took X amount of time to create.   Maybe this is what you are thinking of?"

But browser spellcheck dictionaries do not account for every single word and every alternate spelling.

It's highly likely that you and I are using the same spellcheck.  Are you using the default American English spellcheck dictionary built into Google Chrome? I am. Most people who download Chrome in the US are using this same spellcheck by default. And if you're using some other localization of Google Chrome, the spellcheck dictionary in that version might include this same omission.  Alternatively, you might be using another browser with a different spellcheck, but it might also have omitted this word.   Even though everytime is a valid alternate spelling of every time it's still a less commonly used variant. So it's pretty easy to see why it might get omitted from spellcheck dictionaries."

But finate has a very different meaning finite is with an end as opposed to infinite, to me the word finite with de broken down would be de-""active word-forming element in English and in many words inherited from French and Latin, from Latin de ""down, down from, from, off; concerning"" (see de), also used as a prefix in Latin usually meaning ""down, off, away, from among, down from,"" but also ""down to the bottom, totally"" hence"" with that being said definite would be down or totally with an end it doesn't make sense with those. All these years I spelled it the wrong way apparently and nobody told me even professors with papers I have written...anybody else get this one wrong for so long?"
MandelaEffect,3180k4,UniversalChairs,20,Thu Apr 2 18:59:41 2015 UTC,"I’ve always seen ‘could of’ like a typical grammar mistake, similar to ‘irregardless’ or ‘whole nother’ and such, it’s so wide-spread, I never even considered the idea it might be 'Mandela Effect'.   Funny thing I’ve noticed is that people who know English as a second language rarely make this mistake, because when you learn the tenses, you learn the spoken and written phrase at the same time. But if you’ve been speaking English before you learned to write or studied grammar, that’s an easy mistake to make."
MandelaEffect,3180k4,vseznayka,20,Thu Apr 2 21:46:43 2015 UTC,"And in a general sense, is it just me, or does anyone else remember the Mandela Effect being more about important events and widely recognized cultural phenomena, rather than ""I've been misspelling (some word) for years, and only just now noticed""?  No, nobody else spelled it ""twelth"" or ""Seann"". That's not a Mandela Effect. You just don't know how to spell."

MandelaEffect,31886u,alibi6,16,Thu Apr 2 21:58:55 2015 UTC,"The first thing, it seems really lame, but, the boyfriend had noticed it too and also found it weird, so it made me feel a little better about it.   Anyway, we live in an apt. complex, and I'm a smoker, I'm on the balcony all the time. I know all the neighbors, what they drive, etc. Not intentionally, but it's just knowledge you build up when there isn't a whole lot to look at besides the parking lot and walkway to the building you know?   So one neighbor had this red, Ford sedan. Had a sunroof, and some rust spots, with fading and peeling paint on the hood and around the sunroof. He always backed into a space across from our building.   But one day I step outside, and a green Ford pulls up, backs into a space across the way. I'm not thinking too much of it, until the driver gets out.   It's my neighbor, and at first, I did think maybe his other junker broke down, so he's got a new one. I study that car.   It's got the sunroof, 4 doors, and the rust spots, and fading and peeling paint on the hood and around the sunroof are exactly the damn same.   I waited a few days, before I asked SO if that car was red before. He'll never admit to being spooked, but he was staring at it with that look a person will get when they are very confused and aren't comfortable with the answer they're reaching in their head, ya know?   I broke down and asked the neighbor a couple days after that. Man says he has no idea what I'm talking about, his car has always been green.   The other thing is that I had this keychain, an oversized buffalo nickel. It had belonged to my dad, and when he died I took it. I'm 31, he died in '97, he'd had that keychain since before I had been born, so it was pretty beat up. I kept it on my own keyring for the longest time, almost ten years, but around when I had my daughter in '07 the little chain it was on was starting to give, and I didn't want to lose it. So I took it off, put it in my cabinet jewelry box in the drawer with other sentimental knickknacks like my medal for the junior triathlon and such.   Fast forward to the year 2012. I'm living in an apt in FL and I came home from a weekend away to find most of my stuff completely gone. Including my jewelry box, which had nothing valuable aside from sentimental crap and costume jewelry.   Since that weekend, I have moved about 7 times. Had to couch surf a little bit, not fun. Anyways, this last place, we've been here for over a year and a half now.   One day I go to sort clothes, get rid of what I don't want, make a list of things I need etc, which includes my underwear drawer.   I'm going through it, and under all of my socks, undies, and bras, is that damn keychain.   The chain itself, no longer looks as if it's going to break. The wear and tear of over 30 years of bouncing around on someone's keys is also gone.   This one really spooked me. I know damn well it was never there before. When one packs up their stuff and moves it all the time, you kind of know exactly what the hell you have and where it is.   Sorry for the novel!! I just wanted to explain and get all the pertinent details down in one go."

MandelaEffect,31886u,TriumphantGeorge,1 point,Sat Apr 4 10:05:46 2015 UTC,I do not consider these glitches.
MandelaEffect,31886u,idwthis,3,Sat Apr 4 11:02:44 2015 UTC,"What do you think of them as? (By the way - I'm using ""glitches"" as a broad term for everyday reality not being quite as we might assume, not evidence that we're literally living in a simulation. That subreddit has broadened to pretty much cover 'Everyday Mode Strangeness' - for instance.)  If it was just the keychain re-appearing, you might just say that reality was a bit more flexible and things could re-appear from nowhere.  But the car colour changing for two people and the owner claiming it was always the ""new"" colour is a different sort of thing. That we live in our own sort of overlapping dreams?"
MandelaEffect,31886u,TriumphantGeorge,3,Sat Apr 4 11:07:32 2015 UTC,"If the keychain had disappeared off, say, my kitchen counter, then reappeared a day or week later, then I'd probably put my money on the more paranormal end of things. But since it had been stolen, and gone for so many years, I consider it a ""Mandela Effect.""   Same as the car I also believe it to be that way.   The reason is I do believe in the multiple universes, each one just off by one thing from the other.  And the SO and I have both had some pretty damn close calls in the almost dying department, so if there is such a thing as quantum suicide and immortality, then it stands to reason in one of those we've kicked the bucket and ended up here. And there are these little differences we've both noticed. I know he had one he talked about a couple months ago, but I can't remember off the top of my head at the moment.   Thing about some Mandela Effects is that not all of them would they be such famous examples, like Mandela's death, and such. In fact I think, if the quantum immortality is true, we'd slip over to the universe that most closely resembles ours, but has the tiny little things off the mark, so as not to be too much of a shock, you know?   Now, about glitches, if I were to believe in the hypothesis that we are in a computer simulation, well then I would think things like suddenly seeing the sky go black, or seeing everyone freeze up at the same time, etc., to be an actual glitch.   There's just so many possibilities for everything though, and some things are hard to lump in together or to try and separate. I just have my own little classification for such things, but mostly sticking to the broad generalizations everyone else gives to the paranormal, circumstances of the Mandela Effect and glitches in the matrix."
MandelaEffect,31886u,idwthis,2,Sat Apr 4 11:32:40 2015 UTC,"Quantum suicide and immortality:       In quantum mechanics, quantum suicide is a thought experiment, originally published independently by Hans Moravec in 1987   and Bruno Marchal in 1988,   and independently developed further by Max Tegmark in 1998.  It attempts to distinguish between the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics and the Everett many-worlds interpretation by means of a variation of the Schrödinger's cat thought experiment, from the cat's point of view. Quantum immortality refers to the subjective experience of surviving quantum suicide regardless of the odds.

MandelaEffect,31886u,autowikibot,2,Sat Apr 4 11:33:38 2015 UTC,"Ah, we're basically just differing in labels then.  In my mind, I keep it broad (not categorising) and think of 'glitches' as just anything which indicates that everyday boring reality is more 'flexible' than we usually assume, and can shift. (In fact, the stories at realityshifters.com is how I discovered all this.) Mandela Effect is therefore just another effect or set of evidence for this shifting. It's a matter of scale. (I see ""the paranormal"" as another sort of thing.)  What the best theory or explanation for that is, who knows? I don't think it's literally a computer simulation, and I don't think it's literally multiple universes either. Perhaps it just can't be put into concepts anyway. Maybe putting it into concepts would affect the experience!  But it's definitely true that as individuals we seem to have different experiential histories, to a greater or lesser extent. (We each follow a slightly different trajectory across the Infinite Grid of All Possible Moments.) Mostly we wouldn't notice: the toothpaste was nearly finished and is now almost completely finished; the font used on your neighbour's door number is now a little narrower; your bicycle wheel has one less spoke; etc.   However, more prominent differences get noted as Mandela Effects; larger shifts show up as minor 'glitches'; near-death events and other dramatic circumstances look like full-on 'dimensional jumping'.  Adding: This means there is really no way to get to the bottom of these things; it's only within personal memories that the evidence resides."
MandelaEffect,31886u,TriumphantGeorge,2,Sat Apr 4 11:46:28 2015 UTC,"Memories, that's where a lot of these supposed effects people post about here in this sub fall apart.   Memory is an ever changing thing. You're not going to remember today the same way 20 years from now the way you'll remember it tomorrow.   Then there's the fact that even though two people will witness the same thing, they'll each remember it differently. Then they discuss it, see a video of it that a third person took, and each person's memory then morphs into a conglomeration of what they saw on the video, what they saw themselves, and what their friend saw.   I do have a question for you, if you don't mind. You seem to be one willing to discuss all of this, and I enjoy that so I have to ask your take on some of these Mandela effects.   Where do you stand on where New Zealand and Japan are supposed to be?"
MandelaEffect,31886u,idwthis,3,Sat Apr 4 15:37:51 2015 UTC,"Memories, that's where a lot of these supposed effects people post about here in this sub fall apart.   This is true.   One problem is, it's not even certain quite what memories are or where they are located. The struggle for an explanation is an ongoing hack job story.  Another problem is that it's not just that people differ in their memories of the same event - they actually have different experiences in the first place. Which makes the phrase ""same event"" a tricky one. ""Same"" from what, an imaginary 3rd person perspective? The camera might seem to solve it, but that presumes that there is an independent objective world that the camera represents, 'a referee for reality' of sorts; but something that multiverse-type theories (if we choose to go along with them) negates.  The third problem is, just as you say, memories are ""summoned experiences"" - they are created in-the-senses on demand, based on all the knowledge (correct or incorrect) they have accumulated about the event.  So we end up with: Memories are not records and nor are they static things that are 'looked up', there is no such thing as an objective experience, and there is no such thing as an independent event which exists somewhere in time.  And these things are pretty much impossible to test. All that you can say is that ""I have now in my mind a sensory experience which I feel/suppose represents a past event or fact, according to my conception of time"".   Memory is an ever changing thing.    And even that is an unprovable idea! If history changes without leaving a trace of its former shape, if memory changes without a memory of the memory, then what we are essentially left with is a sort of ""real-time dream"" of present and past.  Tricky.   I do have a question for you, if you don't mind...  New Zealand and Japan    Not at all. Interesting topic to explore and discuss. To me, Japan seems too far north and New Zealand too far south; the area around Australia seems too clustered and ""busy"". (I have actually been to Japan, China and Malaysia, but not Australia/NZ.)  However, it's not that vivid as memories go: and I'm aware that I might be reproducing it from information-about those places rather than actual visual map memories.  Additional Thoughts  I'm pretty open minded about all this stuff; I'm just interested in finding out more about how the world is really experienced and how we can describe it. (Open-minded meaning, I recognise that science and the study of ""observed regularities"" is great, but it is the creation of good-enough models for a subset of experience. It is not sufficient to account for subjective experience as it is lived. I'll take contributions and ideas from all-comers, but I'll ignore trumpeting and blanket optimism.)  I increasingly think that we should view ourselves as experiencing the world ""in the blind"". The links in this post emphasised to me that I'm basically experience ideas about ""a"" world and not interacting with a ""the"" world.  If what we share between us is basically a list of facts about an environment, which we experience as unfolded into senses when we place our attention at a 'location' - and not a real external spatially-extended place - then perhaps there is a way to make sense of all this stuff. Because facts-of-the-world might be flexible and drift over time; both memory and observation might be creative acts in some sense.  The short version would be: We are only ever experiencing our memories; our lives are basically ""consciousness + memory-based, sensory experiences"". (My oft-linked old diagram to try and summarise that, here.)  EDIT: Did some tweaking for clarification; expanded some points."
MandelaEffect,31886u,TriumphantGeorge,2,Sat Apr 4 16:31:41 2015 UTC,So true. Memories can be created and destroyed. You can never trust your memory completely.

If things go wrong, it's usually because our diet is wrong or we allow bad energy in etc. There are other universes, worlds but I would say the Mandela effect is as a result of peoples perceptions being manipulated.

MandelaEffect,31886u,Zombater,2,Sat Apr 4 09:48:10 2015 UTC,"Bad memory. Either that, or subconscious assosiations. Like, imagine a picture of George Washington, the most commonly used one, with his arm stretched out. What color is his shirt, and where is he standing? I got this example from another user btw, so you know who you are, thanks. Well, back on track, the chances are you assumed his shirt was blue and he is standing outside. Except he really isn't!.    Henry VIII is commonly associated with gluttony and being a hoarder of food. To quote Terry Deary:   Henry the Eighth was a big fat man! He loved to stuff his face at the frying pan. Who knows if he'd been a little bit thinner - he wouldn't ended up like Adolf Hitler! And if he laid off all of that beer 'n wine - he wouldn't have ended up like Frankenstein!   So, most people I've met recall this painting when I tell them about it, mainly the ones big into the Tudors. ""He's eating this turkey leg yeah, a big chunk taken off and he's smiling, looking at the camera from an angle"". I recall the painting myself, as does another fellow redditor. But it never existed! Either that or it's just in some common history book we all had, and it's not on the web for some random reason. But the truth is, it's very likely that since we associate Henry with gluttony and fat, we conjure up this picture - or we feel ""Deja Vu-like"" when someone else mentions it.    Finally, Bernstein/Berenstain/Berenstein bears. Shut the fuck up, there's no alternate reality shit. This is more Freud than Einstein. Well, I thought Bernstein, but that's because I really like Citizen Kane. There's a huge possibility that almost all of us just simply read it wrong. Ninety percent of redditors would barely be literate at the times that they read these books/the books were read to them. I even remember Berenstain pictureless books. Stein is very, very common German surname. Much more common than Berenstain. So, we went for that. We likely remember ""Brunstn"" and just filled in the gaps now that we're all literate, or most of us are. It's likely that we just confuse ourselves a lot, to the point where we go for the more absurd explanation. Occam's razor is flawed when it comes to conspiracies and hidden messages, but in everyday life, it is key. And in this circumstance, it just shows that people don't have enough to do.  I know that alternate universes are religious to some people - but face it, there's nothing convincing at all about your argument. People just fucking get confused and jump on the ""alternate timeline"" bandwagon.    EDIT: Fixed Washington link."
MandelaEffect,31886u,EchoedBreath,1 point,Wed Apr 8 16:49:27 2015 UTC,"So, here are my thoughts on the three primary theories that seem to be prevalent in the Mandela Effect community. 1) Poor/malleable memory 2) A mass hysteria type of memory phenomenon 3) Quantum mechanical type of the many-worlds theories (alternate universes)  This thread can be strange for newcomers trying to understand these events because, if you look into the threads, the poor memory thing doesn't fit with all the evidence. Maybe it is a factor, but is not the only cause. The memory oriented mass hysteria theory seems to fit quite a bit more, but still seems at odds with some circumstances. The quantum mechanical many-worlds theory doesn't actually have much evidence against it (or for it) yet in comparison, but most people are adverse to it due to it being the most “out there theory”.   So first, let's look a little more in depth into the poor memory theory. Normally, when we think of “oops, guess I remembered wrong,” that doesn't mean the person remembered entire events that support are consistent with that mistake, and especially so for a set of events. In many of the tales told, it's not simply that one little thing was remembered differently then as current evidence would suggest it would happen, but rather a significant and notable event is recalled which appears to go against some or most physical evidence. These events can be significant to the person(s) who experienced them due to either their emotional effect (such as when an important person dies), because of a notable level of expertise on matters relating to the event, or few possibly some other reason. But many of these occurrences can't be explained away very well by “oops, guess I was wrong.”   The malleable memory argument is a very interesting one. Memory is indeed quite malleable. That is why those false memory scandals in the medical community were able to occur. But the fact that memory is malleable is actually rather curious on it's own. The advantage difference between malleable versus static memory architectures are rather large. If one is a believer that humans were designed by some kind of intelligent being, this would seem like something that would be heavily considered. If one believes in evolution, then that survival advantage of one over the other for the correct situation is quite notable, and it would seem odd that after all this time, if a disadvantageous one would continue to hold this prevalently. Static memory would seem highly useful if history were static. But if history, or even simply the implied history, is not static, then it would be far more useful to have malleable memory. That way the mind could adjust to new evidence of the past, and act based on the current reality. In the very least, I find the idea of the malleable memory trait persisting so strongly to seem improbable within a static history framework, but admittedly still possible.   The theory of a mental mechanism that allows for a mass hysteria kind of memory alteration has a promising mix of believability and evidence. But there are some potential issues with it. Even if a memory can spread across a community when left unchecked, and then integrated as if it were actual memory – there are people who can be untrusting of others words, or may have direct experiences of the actual event in question. This should combat such a phenomenon, particularly at it's early stages of growth. The other issue is that these memories sprout independently in separate  groups, sometimes even across the world. There are a few things to note about the nature in which this seems to happen. The first is that for the overwhelming number of large-scale Mandela Effects, there are usually only 1, or sometimes two alternates to what physical evidence suggests. If these memory were generated by the mind, possibly due to misunderstanding, then even with cultural similarities possible causing similar biases, this still seems two few if this is a randomized phenomenon. Especially when separate cultures/languages/etc across the world are involved. The other thing to note is that the affected groups interact with other people all the time, and are mixed in through-out societies. And yet, there is often no notice of the altered memory until well after the event. Why does it go unnoticed for so long? Are these memories generated that long after the events they describe? Yet these are events that seem to have affected people's lives. These are some curious inconsistencies with this theory, but someone may find explanations for them at some point. Perhaps this is only an aspect of the Mandela Effect, and there are other factors involved as well.  The quantum many-worlds theory as it relates to the Mandela Effect is often based around the quantum immortality though experiment. Even when the quantum immortality is left out, either way it is based on a particular version of the “observer” from quantum mechanics. The presence of an observer collapses a waveform into a particular particle with a particular location. The version used here, and often used in sci-fi stories and the media, is that the “observer” must be something along the lines a of a sentient being, usually human. The other version of the “observer” is simply something which can record the affects of the wave-particle in question. I'm not fully aware as to how strongly the human observer version is believed in the scientific community, but I would think there would be statistical differences between the two versions, due to the difference in where and when the observation would happen, which these experiments are done pretty meticulously, and I'm only aware of ones which use the observer in the sense of an arbitrary record (including something as simple as other particles which are affected by the one in question). Currently there is no evidence for the quantum many-world theory.   Often times though, the alternate universes idea is scoffed without thought. Understandable, but somewhat naive, as many things now agreed to be scientific fact would have once been considered fantastic science fiction. Look at quantum mechanics. That's some weird stuff. Single particles that act as if they had taken multiple paths simultaneously? Or Einstiens theories of general and special relativity. Something which moves at the same speed relative to any other object – that's what light is. If you run on a train, your speed relative to the train will be different then your speed relative to the ground, but that's not true for light. Or that time flows differently in different locations? A fair number of theories well-believed by the research community are rather unbelievable, but that doesn't automatically mean they are untrue. The universe cares not about looking believable to you. It simply is as it is.   The ideas on this forum may seem incredible, but we're all just looking for answers. Some of us may have one idea that is our current favorite, which may result in using certain words when describing this phenomenon. “Alternate reality” doesn't need to only mean a physical universe next to ours, but could more generally mean an implied or perceived reality (or set of events) which is consistent among a set of evidence, often memories, but not always. There's no need to bash on each other for the exact words used when people tell there tales, simply focus on the tale itself.   TLDR:  None of these theories have much evidence for them yet. We just like to pick our current fav's because people “must” choose sides. Rather then pick none, we all pick which ever one we like the most, even if it's a bad fit."

MandelaEffect,313x4c,Cdnprogressive,3,Wed Apr 1 23:16:00 2015 UTC,"Looney Tunes:       Looney Tunes is an American animated series of comedy short films produced by Warner Bros. from 1930 to 1969 during the golden age of American animation, alongside its sister series Merrie Melodies.  Originally named after Walt Disney's then-concurrent musical series Silly Symphonies, Looney Tunes initially showcased Warner-owned musical compositions through the adventures of cartoon characters such as Bosko and Buddy.  Later, following the animation studio's addition of directors Tex Avery and Chuck Jones among others, as well as the voice actor Mel Blanc, Looney Tunes rose to greater fame for creating such popular cartoon stars as Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Elmer Fudd, Porky Pig, Marvin the Martian, Tweety Bird, Sylvester, Yosemite Sam, Foghorn Leghorn, Pepé Le Pew, Speedy Gonzales, Road Runner and Wile E. Coyote, Taz, and many others. From 1942 to 1964, Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies were the most popular animated shorts in movie theaters, exceeding the works of Disney and other popular competitors, including Fleischer Studios, Walter Lantz Productions, UPA, Terrytoons and MGM.   Since its success during the short film era of cartoons, Looney Tunes has become a worldwide media franchise; spawning several television series, feature films, comic books, music albums, video games, and amusement park rides; as well as serving as Warner Bros.' flagship franchise. Many of the characters have made and continue to make cameo appearances in various other television shows, movies and advertisements. The most popular Looney Tunes character, Bugs Bunny, is regarded as a cultural icon and has appeared in more films than any other cartoon character.  Several Looney Tunes films are regarded as some of the greatest animated cartoons of all time.

""Berenstain"" according to our family lore was an attempt by an unknown immigration officer sometime in the late 1800s to reproduce phonetically a highly accented version of the traditional Jewish name ""Bernstein"" as pronounced by my Father's grandparents when they came to America from the Ukraine.  In that linguistic region, the name tended to come out sounding something like, ""Ber'nsheytn"". Since that's how the name was originally documented, it has always been spelled that way by our family and it has always been misread and mispronounced by nearly everyone. It has always been ""The BerenstAin Bears"". Your parallel reality theory is very resourceful but, unfortunately, by applying Occam's razor, we arrive at the explanation that most people have just misread the name.   Mike Berenstain (Son of Stan and Jan)    Of course that might not be the real Mike at all. But if it is it just sounds like he knows what is up and is spewing a bunch of bullshit.

I think that it's more a case of us being lab rats. I'm not saying I don't think there are alternate universes. I think in this instance, we're being led to thinking that is the case here.  I think 'here', there is an in-balance of the collective brain and we're being played with by natural or unnatural causes. I think there is a real lack of awe and respect for nature. I think that the world is a visual representation the collective mind and we're going down a very dark path  We need to adhere to the student teacher principle. You need to become both. It is not enough to be one or the other. We'll then find the truth and change the world but I don't think for a second these things are part of nature or a flaw in people. Far from it. I think we need to develop a new understanding. The realization, we know squat and the truth is we are not told the truth. Treat it like an experiment and don't react. The end game is always the same. The end game is always the world we live in. That is why I say dark path. I think Gnostic thinking is probably correct and we know what happened to them. Still, I think more people now are thinking more and that's important.   Student teacher thing: The way it's designed now is flawed. The child relying on the adult. There has to be a different way of development where everyone independently can be both. It's the only way to protect yourself."
MandelaEffect,30pvda,idwthis,2,Thu Apr 2 13:16:36 2015 UTC,"On the childhood memories thing... why are childhood memories flexible? We can say ""the brain is still growing"" or something, but really as far as I know that's an off-the-cuff theory without a specific, worked-out mechanism. (You wouldn't get away with explaining psi research by saying ""some people's brains are more sensitive"".)  It doesn't necessarily mean universe-switching, but it might mean something more subtle: like, perceptions are settling down and aligning with a certain set of ""facts"" over time."
MandelaEffect,30pvda,Magnum_44,2,Sat Apr 4 09:43:51 2015 UTC,"It's not so much that childhood memories are flexible, but that ALL memories are. The more frequently we recall them, the more prone they are to being changed by the circumstances surrounding each recall, so that the next time we remember them, they come with both the original memory and the jumble of contexts from every other time we've recalled them, and thus the original memory gets a bit more corrupted over time. It's also why witness testimony is weak, because we are very prone to suggestion when we recall details of events, even ones we think we remember well."
MandelaEffect,30pvda,Roril,1 point,Sat May 16 19:45:42 2015 UTC,"For sure. But then... experiments have been conducted where areas of the brain are triggered by an electrode, producing full immersive sensory triggering of a past event.  It does seem as if it's all there, accessible in complete form.   So what we are calling ""memories"" in these discussions may not be correct. Perhaps it is our approach to ""remembering"" that is the problem. Maybe when we try to ""remember"" we actual try to force re-creation - whereas actually the full record is accessible by approaching it another way.  My feeling is that this is related to our misunderstanding of how thinking works. For instance, we tend to ""work hard"" to solve a problem by going over it. In fact personal experimentation tends to show that gathering information and setting up the problem with the intention to solve it - and then leaving it to ""solve itself"" - tends to work better.  Andrew Smart's book, Autopilot, was quite good on this. His general observation: that the baseline level brain activity when we are not concentration on something is higher than the level when we are focusing on something with the attention. In other words: concentrating is a distraction from ongoing problem-solving. Concentrating = ""taking in new details"". Letting be = allowing the brain to evolve problem to solution.  Regardless, there's lots more to learn and discover. We have no idea how and where memories are stored even! It may be that our ideas about how we work, our self-conscious theorising and attempt to act upon those theories, often get in the way of proper functioning..."

That said, if it was a real effect, these people wouldn't have had to die and switch consciouses in a mass event. Everyone has brushes with death on their own.

It's big enough to be noticed as part of the Sea. When the map maker puts the Yellow Sea on the map missing 1/3rd of it isn't very good. I would think most map makers wouldn't want to miss a third of a major body of water like the Yellow Sea. I'd imagine most map makers would want an accurate portrayal of something that's their job to do, so in most representations of this region they'd go for accuracy. Heck, they may do a poor job here and there but there are lots of places that are very intricate that they get right, like the lakes of Canada, Africa, and Australia that they could skim over but do a fine job with them. They really aren't supposed to skim over big stuff and they rarely do.  Also, your France example is bad. The circled portion by Jade Dodecahedron doesn't go into Spain at all."

The other part that doesn't make sense is how Doc Brown made a scene inside a shopping mall in the 1920s in California.

And while it's true that the filmmakers were aiming optimistically high in their vision of 2015 with flying cars and hoverboards, I don't think they intended to get it wrong for the sake of comedy. Also, the absence of flying cars in our reality does not make the presence of flying cars in their version into an anachronism."
MandelaEffect,30awu2,UniversalChairs,1 point,Thu Mar 26 18:17:26 2015 UTC,"Well I mean I call it a mall but I don't know what you would call it, a shopping precinct I suppose."

MandelaEffect,30awu2,AnotherSmegHead,7,Thu Mar 26 17:27:55 2015 UTC,"So here is what the producers from THIS timeline ALMOST did to make BTF IV:  The script opens in mid-October 2015, a week before the date that Marty, Doc and Jennifer are supposed to arrive from 1985. Marty is divorced from Jennifer and is estranged from his daughter. A washed-up rock star, his current claim to fame is being guest judge on a reality show. Marty returns home to Hill Valley for the first time in years when his mother informs him he’s gotten a letter from his friend Doc. Doc wrote this letter in 1905, and he tells Marty that though it isn’t fair to ask this favor of him, Doc’s happiness depends upon it.  In one week’s time, their past selves will arrive in 2015 – but not the 2015 that Marty and Doc originally emerged into in Part II. Thus it is absolutely imperative that Marty ensure that Old Biff is in a position to steal the time machine and travel to the past. If this doesn’t happen to motivate Marty and Doc to return to 1955, then Doc will never be struck by lightning, stranded in the old west and meet the love of his life.  Unfortunately, on the appointed day, Marty’s attempt to manipulate old Biff fails when the elderly man suffers a sudden heart attack. To make matters worse, as he steals the Delorean, Emmett happens on the scene, forcing Marty to bring his daughter with him. At a complete loss for what to do, Marty heads back to the Old West to seek Doc’s help, even as all of history threatens to collapse around them.  The script is noted to be more in the spirit of Part II than the other films, and apparently doesn’t attempt to offer a cover for Fox’s Parkinson’s. Overall the review notes that the script is over-plotted and suffers from too much of a spotlight on Marty’s daughter in later acts.  Source:  http://filmschoolrejects.com/features/back-to-the-future-4.php  Interestingly enough, this plot also deals with the multiple realities created by 2015 not being the same, which is along the lines of what OP posted.

That is, how well does it explain your memories or the phenomena you are experiencing? How ""sure"" are you that something is amiss?   The only thing that the Mandela Effect describes is the phenomenon of memories that do not match reality. Nowhere does the Mandela Effect EXPLAIN anything. EDIT: The fact that people report experiencing it makes the effect true, because that's all it is, a report of an experience. It's a symptom, not a mechanism.  I believe this question is attempting to ask a more direct question about alternate universes or something, but that's not explicitly what the Mandela Effect is.   9 - Do you believe the Mandela Effect is Psychological (as in faulty brains), Physical(as in quantum entanglement), Religious (as in apocalyptic/ divine reward or punishment), or spiritual(as in the migrating of consciousnesses between timelines) or a mixture? Do believe it is good, bad or neutral?If you have noticed any phenomena occurring after you have discovered the Mandela Effect, that you believe may be linked to or triggered by your discovering of the Mandela Effect, please detail it here.   Again, this is a fundamental misunderstanding of what the Mandela Effect is on the part of the survey maker. People might have their own psychological, spiritual, religious, superstitious, or paranormal explanations for why they are experiencing a Mandela Effect. But the Mandela Effect itself is NONE of the above. It's simply a label applied to widespread memories that seem to contradict reality. All that it is, is a name for the apparent contradiction. It does not explain the mechanisms behind them.  I think if you revise your survey to accurately represent what the Mandela Effect is, you might find more participants."

MandelaEffect,305u1n,UniversalChairs,5,Fri Mar 27 15:15:57 2015 UTC,"I look at every thread on this sub starting with the assumption that our memories are inherently fallible. I believe most, if not all, of these threads are due to faulty memory.  I highly doubt anyone will ever find additional evidence to support their memory of things being different, because if this was really an alternate timeline, such evidence would not exist in this timeline.  But I'm right there with you on point 1, that very small things like ""interview with a/the vampire"" are just simply uninteresting because of how minor the perceived difference is.  With that said, I still can't believe James Earl Jones is still alive. I could have sworn he died a few years ago."
MandelaEffect,305u1n,b-LE-z_it,6,Tue Mar 24 20:30:46 2015 UTC,"Maybe there should be a way of asking for the details of the memory from others before the OP's version can be seen, kind of like a blind survey. That way we can rule out our own suggestibility."
MandelaEffect,305u1n,JadeDodecahedron,9,Tue Mar 24 20:38:37 2015 UTC,"but because this has become a catch-all defense it makes it incredibly difficult to have rational debate about the veracity of any given claim.   This isn't an attack, just gonna be straight with you here. Everyone knows human memory is unreliable, this isn't news. I think you're entirely missing the point of this subreddit. Obviously we can't prove any of these claims in any way. That's why we are here, to talk about it and share our stories/memories.  Your Interview with The/A Vampire ""debunking"" is not a debunking at all. Many people remember seeing it written that way. Like you said, the verbal pronunciation is just one explanation. You're trying to promote more logic, but have yourself failed to apply it here.   I also think the Berenstain (vs. Berenstein) Bears example fails to meet this criteria.    And why is that? Your answer:   The alternate memory should be shared by a significant number of independent sources. Of course a group of people can collectively remember something incorrectly, but the credibility of a claim is vastly improved when it is shared by a larger group.   What? The Berenstain/Berenstein Bears alternate memory is shared by a significant number of people. You can find page after page of postings from people talking about this. I know several people personally who share the memory, as do others on here. How much better can you get when it comes to independent sources in abundance? Do we have to form some official institution for you to acknowledge us?   The alternate memory should be supported by additional evidence. This one is perhaps the most difficult standard to meet.   Well yeah, because that's what the Mandela Effect is, there's never evidence.   ...but there should be something to support a claim aside from just memory.   Again...this is what the Mandela Effect is. That's all it is. Nobody is claiming it's logical. We don't have a determined explanation. A very sizable group of people who share an identical memory of something where there is no proof of it happening.   For me personally, I've yet to see a reported Mandela Effect that holds up under this kind of scientific rigor.    Nor will you, because from what I am reading, you don't seem to want to accept what the Mandela Effect is. Nobody's trying to convince you of anything. We're sharing identical memories we have that we can't explain. Just because we can't explain it, or can't yet explain it, doesn't mean there absolutely isn't an explanation. This is the most backwards way of looking at science and logic I can imagine. We would never make any major new discoveries if everyone looked at things this way."
MandelaEffect,305u1n,SombreroOnAFlea,4,Wed Mar 25 22:03:39 2015 UTC,"""The two memories should be substantively different.  For example, ""Interview with A Vampire"" sounds identical to ""Interview with the Vampire"" when said aloud"" Well you can always look to other languages. There are Spanish people who report Sex IN the City being changed to Sex AND the City. the difference being EN and Y, two distinctly different sounds.  ""For me personally, I've yet to see a reported Mandela Effect that holds up under this kind of scientific rigor."" By definition, an alternate history is impossible to improve empirically - it simply doesn't exist any more.  As for me, Augusta was the Capital of Georgia, and Bangor was the capital of Maine, and Shirley MacLaine died in the early 90s, etc. etc.  there IS no way to prove any of this whatsoever, so as a survival strategy I simply accept the change an do not resist reality - which can drive you insane. However I cannot accept an empirical definition of something that cannot be proven empirically.  I think it's simply a quirky aspect of existence that does not mean doomsday, or anything grand in particular - but does go a long way to dislodge me from any ideologies I once held.  Which is VERY freeing."
MandelaEffect,305u1n,JadeDodecahedron,2,Tue Mar 24 21:37:20 2015 UTC,"As for me, Augusta was the Capital of Georgia, and Bangor was the capital of Maine, and Shirley MacLaine died in the early 90s   I'm just asking this out of curiosity, but why are you so convinced of that? Have you ever considered that you were just mistaken?"
MandelaEffect,305u1n,ntresch,4,Wed Mar 25 01:30:37 2015 UTC,"It such a weird thing. A lot of Mandela Effect stuff for me is peripheral knowledge - with Shirley MacLaine, I read a lot of attacks on her new age stuff, and capping it off that she died of brain Cancer in the 90s, it was pretty much how writers introduced her. But, I have know idea on her direct work, whatsoever, never watched a film, or a show. But she IS the psychic Shirley MacLaine they talked of  -unless there was another famous new age actress who died of brain cancer in the 90s that you can point to. With things like Augusta being the capital of Georgia the reason being is that when I learned this, I thought why not Atlanta, it didn't make any sense. As for Bangor being the capital of Maine, I have no specific memory tied to it, I have always known it to be so, but I have read plenty of Stephen King and am kind of a geography buff (or rather WAS lol.), and live within a 6 hour drive of Maine and have never HEARD of Augusta, Maine in my entire 30 year life until yesterday. It's not impossible that I am completely incorrect in this regard.  And of course I have questioned myself you couldn't call yourself sane if you didn't...  But with things like the color Chartreuse being yellow instead of red/purple.Jiffy peanut butter never having had existed, Sri Lanka, and New Zealand apparently moving and other people remembering these things like I do it's lends credence to theories that surround it and is EXTREMELY fascinating - probably moreso to me than someone who hasn't experienced it.  Although I did experience what I like to call ""cosmic nausea"" when I leaned things that were counter-factual to my trivial knowledge, and saw that others did too-like it ""broke my brain"" in terms of being speechless and unable to wrap my head around it - I'm not going to live and die by the fact that Richard Chamberlain died of Aids at the turn of the millennium, and he's still alive and kicking today. ""No, star of Shogun, of one of my favorite movies as a teenager, you should be dead - of Aids"" Or that some place names have changed. It's trivial minutia. But I'm not all people.   I enjoy the conversation and debunking though. And this is helping to shape my already individualist anarchist ideals into something much more freeing.  I very much like the idea that the past can change, and am even comfortable with it.  I think though the reason why this all seems to peripheral and not direct, is in line with the Quantum Immortality theory, that when you are about to die,your consciousness will migrate to the most plausible/and probable time line in which you live,so as not to drive you insane from the shock i.e: Someone who grew up in Augusta Maine, would not migrate to a place in which it is not the capital. So most of the changes are not direct, however there instances of the ME on people who have noticed personal items changing color, and  spouse's appearance changing slightly after Near Death Experiences, what have you. Or it could simply have to do with quantum entanglement, CERN, and the countless nuclear tests done in the Pacific. We could all be migrants to this timeline and could easily migrate out of it, you just haven't found your MEs yet.  But even through all this, I still think I'm probably wrong -but I doubt it ;)"

MandelaEffect,305u1n,brianberns,2,Tue Apr 28 20:06:49 2015 UTC,It's inherent in the Mandela Effect - and the more mysterious glitches in general - that there will be no physical evidence. If there really has been a shift in the facts-of-the-world then all physical experiences will correspond to those new facts - and memories of the old version will be all that would remain. So (3) is out.  I'd say that a combo of (1) and (2) signifies the Ultimate Mandela Effect Example where two large groups of people vividly remember something that is completely different. We should always be on the lookout for that.  But small examples count. Big things have small beginnings...

The problem with your argument is that we can apply that same reasoning to call any case of bad memory a Mandela Effect. For example, if I said I remember the McDonald's mascot being a bear instead of a clown, I could just say I'm from a different timeline when people remember differently. The only way we can differentiate a legitimate case of the Mandela Effect from bad memory is by subjecting the examples to a certain amount of scrutiny. To me, this example doesn't come close to passing the litmus test. The fact that the false memory can very easily be explained in this case makes it a poor example. Is it still possible? Yes, of course. But Occam's razor would seem to lean on the side of bad memory here. This example would hold much more gravity if the names sounded dramatically different."

MandelaEffect,2zo1lo,sleithreethra,5,Fri Mar 20 04:36:01 2015 UTC,"Ok so this has been bothering me too since I found out about it weeks ago, and I have sort of a theory about it. I too remember it being Berenstein, and I could swear to it, however, I recently went to a used book sale and found one of the old books from 1984: Berenstain! I was shocked to discover this, how the hell could my memory be so wrong!  Then I continued to dig through the stack of books and came across this one: Ali Baba Bernstein. Now this book is also from the 80's and looks vaguely familiar to me.  Also, I remember having an issue with the spelling of the Bears books when I was younger, thinking that it should be spelled with an A, only in the beginning of the word, making it BEARenstein, since they were bears! So this issue with the placement of an A, and possibly the other title of the other kid's book, could have contributed to my false memory, and maybe with other people's false memory.  Or, I could be wrong and two timelines have converged and some of us are living in an alternate universe. I don't fucking know..."
MandelaEffect,2zo1lo,sleithreethra,3,Tue Mar 24 15:54:41 2015 UTC,"I don't remember ever seeing that Ali Baba book. I would've sworn that it was Berenstein, it doesn't even look right with -stain.

MandelaEffect,2zm95l,avoliva,5,Mon Mar 23 02:34:55 2015 UTC,"If nothing else, the psychological explanation would be mental subconscious association. It's after midnight, so I'm not going to bother with sources or even trying to make it sound legit, if you want, you can look this stuff up yourself.  So, pretty much, it's like a mass-reverse Freudian slip. When I say the name ""George Washington"", you might probably immediately think of the famous painting with Old George's arm extended in an open room wearing a blue jacket:  http://cdn.history.com/sites/2/2013/12/washington_portrait-P.jpeg  Except he's not in an open room, nor wearing a blue jacket. When you read on characters from history or even fiction occasionally, little things about who they are will send your subconscious queues, and will physically, visually assosiate it with other parts of them.  Example: King George was a well known glutton, but also lived a lifestyle of self-indulgance as well as his own power, and as such, your subconscious would observe this gluttonous lifestyle (both literally and figuratively) and associate it with him holding a turkey-leg for a portrait even when there's no logical reason behind actually doing that.  Now, here's an interesting question to those who ""remember"" the turkey leg: Was there a bite taken out of it? I 'remember' it too, but I don't remember a bite taken out of it."

I'm not talking about blocked on the Internet by the way. I've no doubt in my mind as to why that might be the case but it's not for me to say. Ask yourself, is there a PURPOSE to all this? Suffice to say, be strong of mind and continue to trust your instincts. They're not part of the brain functionality and are there for a reason  One of the things that I hope people grasp is that you might very well have seen or experienced exactly what you say but others may have different experiences. It's important to respect that because it's not about being right and wrong. It's people feeling their way in the dark because someones turned off the light switch. We have to go through a process of working out the truth for ourselves. We cannot trust others for reference.   Going back to the picture, i remember it but i'm not a visual person.

I have lived in NZ for my entire life, and travelled extensivley around the south pacific and Aus, with my uncle in his light turboprop aircraft. The layout and spacing is exactly as shown on maps. I wil admit that the carribean is an area of the world that I am not familiar with, but glancing at a map of it, nothing seems truly ""off"".   But anyway, Oceania=always the same layout. You must remember that the distances in the south pacific often look much smaller on a map than they actually are in terms of actual distance. This is because of the vast expanses of ocean shown on a map. For instance, it is about 2500 miles between NZ and the Cook islands. Another 3500 miles from the Cook islands to Hawaii.

MandelaEffect,2z380v,Boeing797-300ER,2,Fri Jun 5 07:59:15 2015 UTC,"You're right; the climate is very moderate, but it is not tropical.   New Zealand is part of Polynesia. Maori, the indigenous people, are Polynesian people; they migrated and brought culture, language, technologies and mythologies. To an outsider's eye, it might be hard to distinguish the traditional forms of these different cultures.   Moreover, much of the plant-life is closely related to Polynesian plant-life. (This is particularly visible in our temperate rainforests, particularly in the north, as noted by /u/TeHokioi.) We also have a lot of volcanoes, a trait shared with the Pacific Islands.   Being an island nation, there is a strong emphasis on our connection with the sea. In images of this, it will not be apparent that our climate is very different. Parts of NZ do look pretty tropical.  I've heard British tourists commenting how tropical it can look here, what with the palms and beaches and whatnot.   In terms of all these things, this is how we market ourselves as a tourist destination. This increases the effect of these similarities for people who have not been here. It doesn't matter that NZ is very different to, say, Samoa if you have never been to either, and both are marketing themselves in the same way."
MandelaEffect,2z380v,MasterEk,2,Sun Mar 15 10:01:48 2015 UTC,"You're right that outsiders could probably perceive NZ as being somewhat tropical, given access to the right information. I think that is strong evidence that people are simply remembering wrong: you could only mistake its location as being to the NE of aus if you didn't know that much about it, and had only a vague idea about the place. Just seems a bit convenient that those who remember it differently are only those to whom NZ is a remote and mostly unknown place.  (I'm also from NZ btw, just think people are forgetting that a country can't move around the map without also changing its climate and all sorts of other fundamental things.)"

The idea appears to have originated in 1970 with Stephen Schmidt's suggestion of a 14-sign zodiac (also including Cetus as a sign). A 13-sign zodiac has been suggested by Walter Berg and by Mark Yazaki in 1995, a suggestion that achieved some popularity in Japan, where Ophiuchus is known as Hebitsukai-Za (へびつかい座?, ""The Serpent Bearer"").  In sidereal and tropical astrology (including sun sign astrology) a 12-sign zodiac is used based on dividing the ecliptic into 12 equal parts rather than the IAU constellation boundaries. That is, astrological signs do not correspond to the actual constellations which are their namesakes, particularly not in the case of the tropical system where the arbitrary divisions of the sky move over time.

MandelaEffect,2ym06t,Nuclear_Rainbow,1 point,Thu Mar 12 17:07:17 2015 UTC,"So Weird:       So Weird is an American-Canadian television series that aired on the Disney Channel as a mid-season replacement from January 18, 1999 to September 28, 2001. The series was shot in Vancouver, British Columbia. In season one and season two, the series centered on teenage girl Fiona Phillips (Cara DeLizia) who toured with her rock star mom (Mackenzie Phillips), while encountering paranormal activity along the way. The series was compared to the Fox TV series The X-Files since it took a darker tone than other Disney Channel Originals. For the third and final season, Disney replaced Cara DeLizia (due to her wanting to pursue future projects outside of Disney) with actress Alexz Johnson playing Annie Thelen. Production ceased after 65 episodes.    Image i     Interesting: That's So Weird (TV series) | List of So Weird episodes | Cara DeLizia | Alexz Johnson   Parent commenter can toggle NSFW or delete.

I also though recall telling my child about his death, and talking about how much I loved his show when I was her age, but, she would have been just one year old in 2004 so we couldn't have had that conversation at that time.

Some 10+ years later I described a story from that event as if I had been there, and remembered it as if I'd been there, which we couldn't understand, until I visited the same location for another reunion and realised nothing about the place was as I ""remembered"" it being.

MandelaEffect,2y6nsy,ikcaj,3,Fri Mar 6 22:47:50 2015 UTC,"Edited: Update and edited to remove possible identifying info  I was asked to expand upon an event from my original post:   Lastly, my family has managed to lose a member. Won't go into detail now given the length of this post, but in short, my uncle had a kid with his 2nd wife. She left him when the baby was just one & never contacted him again. For years we all knew this & now no one does but me, including my uncle, who one would think would remember if he had a kid out there somewhere, but this was before he got sober & there is quite a lot he doesn't recall.   I posted a lengthy recount of events in this comment a few hours ago, using the real name of the cousin no one remembered. After posting this, the whole thing was really bothering me so I contacted my parents and asked about this again and now, not only does my cousin exist but apparently she plays a Facebook game with one my parents daily! Because of that, I'm editing this post to be much more vague than my original post. I could simply delete it, but I can't stand it when people do that. I could have left it as is, but that I feel that would be deliberately misleading. The purpose is not to create dramatic ME events but to understand them when they occur.  Summary of events being as follows:   My uncle married a woman and they had a kid. I attended the wedding, and met the child twice. She left my uncle and took the child was a little past one year of age at the time. The family had no contact with the child, but, we all remembered her. About 15 years ago I got into genealogy and inquired about her and she was still remembered but details were oddly sketchy. About five years ago, I reconnected with my uncle's other children and inquired again as to status of the child. That is when no one remembered her. I wrote off accounts of most family members as having various valid reasons for not knowing about the child, or stating they did not know about her. I could not reconcile my parents stating they did not know about her and that we did not attend the wedding or meet the child. The last time I specifically recall discussing this was two years ago and my parents did not remember her at that time.  Today per my conversation, my parents informed me that the child, who is now a young adult in college apparently searched for her father, my uncle, on her own and once locating him, reached out to other family members including my parents. They have been in contact with her for the past year or so.   This is all well and good and I guess could be chalked up to several people misremembering things, but I swear it is making me question my sanity. When I first read about ME, the first thing that came to my mind was this issue. I wasn't nearly as concerned about bears, Mandela, etc., but, I wasn't sure how much I should share given that this is a real person.   Though I feel absolutely certain that there was a period of about six years in which every person I asked told me that my Uncle never had a third child, I would be completely willing to accept the fact that I misunderstood or misremembered this time period except for one important detail, which is that everyone in my family knows I do the family genealogy. We are part of an international association of people who have the same original surname, traced back to 16th century. We have a friggin' castle (as a group) and I created the Website 15 years ago which is now the first result of any search for that surname. All sorts of relatives contact me on a regular basis, both close and distant. They ask questions or provide updated info, such as a divorce, marriage, grandchild, etc.   So, if my immediate family knew all along that we had this lost touch with this immediate family member, and they never forgot about her existence, why didn't anyone tell me when she found us? Apparently, I'm told today, she is friends with everyone on Facebook, except for me. Obviously I will be contacting her shortly, before she disappears again. I am really excited to know she has found us and is no longer missing. I just can not explain that period of time though when everyone told me she did not exist. It is just bizarre.  TL;DR: Had a first cousin everyone forgot about including her father, posted detailed information about the event, then spoke with family again and now she does exist but no one ever told me about it."

MandelaEffect,2y6nsy,torrentialhavok,2,Sun Apr 5 06:07:43 2015 UTC,"I think sometimes people mistake mistakes. However, I think sometimes people remember correctly. What does that mean? We have a certain way of thinking. A process like being on a roller coaster. If you go against that thinking you're a conspiracy 'nut' - which is really an attack on critical thinking. Since critical thinking doesn't have to be offensive. It just has to be different. Most people therefore have never considered life and what is really going on.   Are your memories stored inside your brain? Who knows. Science may come out tomorrow and say yes they are. The problem is that unless you do the test yourself, you rely on others telling the truth. So where are memories stored? Where do they come from? Did you really miss remember those things? Maybe you did or maybe you miss remember some. Maybe you remembered them correctly.   The truth is when something amazing happens, people asking those around them if they felt, saw, heard, touched or tasted anything but you are unique. You might be the only one that saw it that way. It's not a physical reality. All is connected. It would be very difficult to answer your question. You have to recognize patterns. You have to think about where your thoughts come from and are they even your own. Are they even your own? :)   I have my thoughts, i've pretty much shared them. I think people have to be sure about what they believe in else what happens is people ask other people and eventually people question their mind. Question what they saw.

MandelaEffect,2xrfo4,theforeshadowing,2,Sun Mar 15 17:36:48 2015 UTC,I remember him dying during a trick where he was supposed to escape from a box covered in cement. I remember that vividly.
MandelaEffect,2xrfo4,izempo,4,Fri Mar 6 15:25:03 2015 UTC,"Are you sure it was Houdini? because that happened to a real life wanna be magician in the mid nineties, I think he was from either florida or the Seattle area?  from what I remember he was put in a glass box and wet cement was poured into a hole he dug in the ground somewhere, they lowered him in first, and eventually the weight of the cement caused the coffin to cave in."
MandelaEffect,2xrfo4,anonagent,3,Sun Mar 8 05:06:25 2015 UTC,I remember that too! I even remember seeing a video clip from some documentary. You could see the cement drop a bit in the centre as the box collapsed. Or maybe it was a different stuntman?
MandelaEffect,2xrfo4,EdibleVelvet,5,Sat Mar 7 22:12:05 2015 UTC,"I searched for it and apparently that was some guy called Joe Burrus and it happened on an anniversary of Houdini's death. It was taped, but it was in the 70s (at least the video looked like it was 70s). I remember a black and white video from a specific angle, bottom right corner of the hole in the ground, but my brain could just be messing with me.  edit: it was 1990, not the 70s  edit 2: the fact that i considered that my brain was messing with me is stupid. clearly i was thinking of some other video."
MandelaEffect,2xrfo4,izempo,1 point,Sat Mar 7 23:35:53 2015 UTC,I could've sworn that Houdini died during a magic trick involving being trapped in a box with a lock and chain underwater.   Yes.

MandelaEffect,2xhxhy,vaguepagan,2,Sun Mar 1 12:12:23 2015 UTC,A lot of people assume a wrestler is dead because of how common it is for wrestlers to kick it at a young age and if they're not working for the WWE they can become pretty irrelevant and forgotten in the wider scope of popular culture  He's been in a lesser wrestling company called TNA for nearly a decade now and is actually the company's current World Heavyweight Champion

What it leads to is people questioning their own mind/memories etc. I think peoples instinct is there to protect against this kind of thing but just imagine evil, what happens when people start doubting their natural instincts?  You get other people telling you how it was. That's a dangerous game. It doesn't mean they're lying to you and it doesn't mean either or both are wrong but every single one of us have our own perceptions about everything. Our own perceptions about every single thing. That is why more often then not, if one person notices something other people will have noticed it too (but not automatically friends it depends). The differences can be subtle or probably even huge. Size isn't important since lots of people would rather doubt others or even themselves then actually follow these things through. Thoughts are just patterns - which is why people are habitual and why mind control can be achieved since people are habitual. If you get people thinking a certain way, it will continue until people break out of the habit. The only way to do that is consider the possibility in your own mind that you guys are right! Where questions does that lead you to? Follow it through and don't let others make you doubt yourself."

That is why to anyone, there will always be things where you think but you're not sure and you ask others and eventually you will convince yourself you were wrong. Important to find things where you have no doubt in your mind. Always remember that peoples perceptions are individual. You have to be in control of your own mind because it stands to reason that if you can trick all the five senses? You're going to use it on the people.

I want to ask people a few questions and we will find answers. Firstly, if you heard it as run, did you FIRST see this film in the cinema?  If you did not see it in the cinema and you hear run? What does that tell you?  I've seen it on dvd too and didn't notice the fly. I saw it first in the Cinema and recall run. What if hypothetically the loudness of the cinema gave run the preference. Or what if the first version takes prescience over all other times until you change perspective? Or what if the size of the cinema screen had a bigger impact because my brain took in more information? I only heard fly on dvd once I saw the suggestion and maybe it was the suggestion that made me re-evaluate the word and correct it? Since I tested it and now it's clearly fly.   However what if other people still hear the word run? This is no different to the color nonsense of the dress. Everything is information. People need to learn from this. I think certain things cause a trigger and alter our perception. Maybe the lower volume in the home, created people to hear fly? Or maybe there was another trigger?  In addition to that, let me ask people this - if you saw it in the Cinema, did you hear him say FLY? :) People need to realize that the senses can be manipulated but had far does it reach? What is it that led to people asking the question in the first place? It's a script of over 1000 words. It's peoples instinct that tells them something is wrong. Perhaps people should respect others more more and understand that everyone can see,hear, taste, smell, touch things different and all be right.  Are peoples perceptions being played with causing the Mandela Effect?..as well as other things.."

MandelaEffect,2x3fyn,int0xik8,4,Thu Feb 26 06:37:21 2015 UTC,"One hundred years of solitude is one of my favorite books of all times, and part of it has to do with the way it begins and it ends. The book begins in the middle of a story, the first phrase in the book is ""many years later"" as if you had started hearing people tell a story in the middle of it. The end on the other hand is very definitive and dramatic ""the first in the line is tied to a tree, and the last one is being eaten by ants"". I don't think an epilogue would make the book better. Gabriel Garcia Marquez tends to finish his books abruptly and dramatically, I remember the end of No one writes to the Colonel ""(We'll eat) Shit"".  However, I mentioned no one writes to the colonel for a specific reason. The colonel was one of the colonels that fought with some buendia in some ear (forgive me but I haven't read the book in a few years). And many other books by Marquez have place in the same universe, so is possible that there is a short story macondo in the future, and someone thought it would be a good epilogue for one hundred years of solitude."

MandelaEffect,2wxzkf,trueboliever,11,Tue Feb 24 02:21:31 2015 UTC,"Sort of. It involved a plane being remote controlled and flown into the WTC by an arms manufacturer who wants the US to go to war when it blames terrorists.   One retrospectively relevant aspect of this pilot episode is that the airliner has been hijacked (via remote control of the plane's autopilot) and, by the end, both Byers and his father have boarded the plane to try to stop the hijacking. Through the aid of the other Gunmen, they are able to regain control of the plane and just miss crashing into the World Trade Center with the airliner. This, of course, was before the actual September 11 attacks against the World Trade Center later that year. Similar to theories posited about the events of 9/11, the episode's plot indicates that the hijacking was committed as an act of voracity by a greedy American arms manufacturer to ultimately increase its weapons sales by invoking U.S. retaliation against a scapegoated anti-American extremist dictator."

MandelaEffect,2wwid0,Kafke,22,Tue Feb 24 04:11:03 2015 UTC,"I'm not familiar with the first two, but I'll offer an explanation for ""stein/stain"".   Most people, once they have learned to read, do so by recognizing word shapes rather than individual letters Your visual system is a complex marvel, and one of it's abilities is to discard minor deviations from known patterns. This makes it easy to read different handwriting, fonts,Shakespearean spellings, and all manner of things. It also means we can see something slightly different from what we expect, and categorize it as a match. We often see names that end with stein (rather than stain). So often that we form a category for those names and connect them to a ""word-shape-pattern""   So, when you see Berenstain, it's just human nature to process it as (unique first part ""Beren"") and ( it's a ""-stein"" name).  A similar thing happens when you see this sign. Most people don't notice that the word ""the"" is repeated, until it's pointed out."
MandelaEffect,2wwid0,Kafke,2,Tue Feb 24 21:54:33 2015 UTC,"We often see names that end with stein (rather than stain). So often that we form a category for those names and connect them to a ""word-shape-pattern""   Berenstein was the first name that was like that for me. I also pronounced it (and still do) ""steen"", which is why I was baffled to learn it was actually an a.   Most people don't notice that the word ""the"" is repeated, until it's pointed out.   I noticed it just fine...   I'm not familiar with the first two   To elaborate. I (and several other users) distinctly being in a more south position than it is. It's not a map projection issue, since none of the projections line up to how I remember. I remember it being directly east of china.  And for the games, there's 2. The first is a game called Super Buster Bros. I only have the SNES one, which for some reason unknown to the universe, is the only version that doesn't have 2 players. I remember the mode clearly, but also remember the menu clearly. And the menu lines up only with the SNES game. While the mode doesn't exist on it apparently.  Other users also remember a 2 player mode for the SNES game F-Zero. I don't have any familiarity with this one."
MandelaEffect,2wwid0,Jakker32,-5,Tue Feb 24 22:59:58 2015 UTC,"I think that people have to remember a few things. Humanity is constantly being studied. As is the make up of the brain. Right? This isn't speculation. This is basic logic but that doesn't mean people are consciously aware of it. There are always distractions. Therefore it's subconscious.   How do people think think they do these tests? Why would you test a couple of thousand when you can test entire populations? As with the color dress psy op, what if you could trick all the senses? How would you do testing?  Most people are not awake to the real world. It's not about repeating information sounding smart. It's about using the information to effect daily life. Society entains through schooling we are more influenced by things outside of themselves then ourselves.   That's how mind control is possible. That's is why randomness is not acceptable as you cannot control something you cannot predict.   I've seen a scientific reason, the power of suggestion but I think the mandela effect is some kind of trigger that goes off in the brain under certain conditions to induce sensory changes and I think it's out gut instinct or our inate collective intelligence that spots these needles in haystacks and I think it's important for everyone to know their own mind because what you find is people look for answers from other people who have their own perspectives. It's the wrong behavior. If you know something you know it but if you continue to doubt yourself, then you have a massive problem.  If you are absolutely sure, go with it. If other people experienced the same? Then it's promising but the worst thing people can do is let other people reason them out of of thinking because perspective can effect every individual. It is not collective in the sense that, if it happens to you you cannot rely on all your mates to back you up. It don't work like that  It never did work like that. And people are entrained from a young age to talk a certain way and of course if you think any different your a nutter or if you see any different your wrong. Maybe that's not the case.   Maybe people that experience these things are experiencing something that is very real. What if somehow you can implant false memories? What if you can manipulate the senses to cause disagreement and to create a certain type of environment?   I think so because what that cloths color thing taught me is that people can all disagree and see different thngs but it don't mean anyone's wrong. Likewise the same person can be manipulated by a certain trigger to change perception. It could be anything if you have the key.  Most of these things are he said this or that? It's this color of that? I remember this country country was bigger or no it's the same size? I don't remember this country vs I remember this country..I remember this ending or I don't....  So people learn to trust yourselves, because we are being fucked with. Regardless of the deeper motives, do people not think the powers that be wouldn't use us as test rats? Of course they would. They do. I'm a psych student and it's not paranoia trust me :) Let's not forget words can offer truth but they can also conceal the truth."

You were most likely watching the film on VHS on an older TV. This messed with the colors and created some reddish tint. To the best of my knowledge no extended version of this scene exists, at least in any consumer copy.   It is very possible, however, that this was a briefly on network TV long ago (as some movies do have slightly different versions aired on TV). Considering Spielberg's recent intent on making his films more family friendly, it would be totally in character for him to attempt to erase something like that.  Also as another poster mentioned, a similar scene happened in the second with a river being turned red by running blood. It's possible you're mixing the two scenes up."
MandelaEffect,2wxoj3,RazorbladeGangbang,12,Tue Feb 24 08:14:10 2015 UTC,"Spielberg has digitally changed his films to be less violent, he altered E.T. a few years back so that the government agents were holding walkie talkies instead of guns.  I think he later changed it back.  It's possible he altered the scene before the dvd release to make it more kid friendly. Its apparent in his movies that violence has become something he's not really comfortable with.  Compare Raiders of the lost ark to the Kingdom of the crystal skull.  In the first one Indy shoots people and there's the guy getting chopped by the plane rotor.  In Skull he doesnt use his gun at all as far as I remember"

Yes, in full disclosure, I may have seen or heard some of the footage, but the CD R was unknown to me. Still, it could have been on the disc or added. :)! I have similar ghost memories for Empire strikes back, but I'm guessing it was the same deal. Just stuff I picked up, or read.   I think you sleuths figured this out!"
MandelaEffect,2wk5yk,DrCosmoMcKinley,5,Mon Feb 23 18:11:01 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the links, I haven't even seen these! Cute girl. I bet she was mad she lost her screen time in one of the biggest movies ever. As for your memory, I dunno. I had a Star Wars graphic novel back in the late 70's that had some Biggs content on Tattooine, but nothing like these scenes rings a bell. edit: is there any chance these deleted scenes were included on the late 90's re-release versions of the original films on DVD with Lucas's digital edits?"
MandelaEffect,2wk5yk,Owyn_Merrilin,3,Fri Feb 20 17:53:04 2015 UTC,"The only thing I could think of was some sort of dialogue borrowed and stuck in one of their games. A friend suggested the books, but i haven't read them. There are more deleted scenes that I seemingly remember, but I need to see if I can find a decent link. So weird! Thank you very much for your response, and yeah, wish they'd had more screen time for that lady!"
MandelaEffect,2wk5yk,VegasSaint9,4,Fri Feb 20 17:56:34 2015 UTC,"My maddening Star Wars memory was from Return of the Jedi.  When they are advancing on the Death Star, they discover that the shield is still up.  Therefore they have to quickly and sharply pull away from the Death Star.  I distinctly remembered that several ships didn't make it and actually were destroyed by crashing into the shield before they could pull away.  I was so sure of this that I got upset that it was cut from the DVD.  Turns out the scene had merged in my head with a similar moment in Independence Day."
MandelaEffect,2wk5yk,DrCosmoMcKinley,2,Mon Feb 23 18:41:55 2015 UTC,I totally remember this too
MandelaEffect,2wk5yk,OscarNotSoWilde,1 point,Mon Feb 23 18:47:11 2015 UTC,"A bit late, but did you ever read the novelization? Because this happened in that, but not the movie. The Star Wars franchise as a whole is full of Mandela Effect type stuff, most of which was in books or comics or the radio dramas but not in the actual films -- another common one, which hasn't been mentioned in this thread, is Luke missing the first throw of the grappling hook in the scene where he and Leia swing across the chasm. Happened in the novelization, never proven to have existed in any form for the movie. General consensus is that people are just getting the memories mixed up."
MandelaEffect,2wjig9,PhiWeaver,54,Fri Feb 20 12:39:24 2015 UTC,"I don't really agree with your premise at all.  I find it easy to tell the fashions and music between now and 15 years ago.  The pants, the jackets,  suits,  shoes,  shirt sizes and cuts.   Puff Daddy production sounds nothing like Kanye West. Even the bland pop music like Britney Spears sounds way different than Katy Perry,  who I would consider somewhat cultural equivalents.  Maybe you just aren't very in touch with current trends..."
MandelaEffect,2wjig9,hairsprayking,15,Mon Feb 23 17:17:28 2015 UTC,"I'd argue a lot of what we think of as stuck in the 90s in fashion, music, etc. really peaked in the early 2000s.   Exactly, the same with the 80s, there were things I originally swore was bad 80s fashion or music, then when I looked it up realized it was really 89-93 or so. Decade bleed is an awesome term, I'll have to remember that one. We tend to compartmentalize fashion, music, etc. into 10 decade spans when really they are all mutating, regurgitating, repelling, etc. on a moment by moment basis."
MandelaEffect,2wjig9,WiretapStudios,6,Mon Feb 23 21:47:12 2015 UTC,"Agreed. I also took History of Design ;-) I have retro 60s-70s pieces of furniture that were designed and produced in the 50s as office furniture before they caught on and were produced in many different colors.   Your point about the avant garde class can be seen at any local Wal-Mart. You'll see stuff that once was extremely expensive to procure like outdoors tech style jackets or wicking base layers, and eventually the style / technology was accepted by the masses and mass produced. The quality and selection isn't the same of course, but I always like to see how long it takes for clothing and decor styles to reach Target, and then how soon WalMart makes a cheaper copy."
MandelaEffect,2wjig9,WiretapStudios,27,Mon Feb 23 22:06:23 2015 UTC,"Things didn't stop being retro, dude, you just got old."
MandelaEffect,2wjig9,IamSeth,31,Mon Feb 23 22:51:27 2015 UTC,"I think 1999 and 2015 are very different in style/technology etc. I didn't see a lot of scarves  being worn as an accessory in '99  unless it was cold out and infinity scarves if they were on shelves only took off more recently, that's just one thing, but I'm no fashion mogul, but there are  clear differences in women's wear, but for men maybe it's much more static, but for  business men honestly the suit hasn't changed really much in way longer like as long as I've been alive. But for women style changes more often. Plus you see hair colors and cuts that someone wearing in '99 would get major stares for if they traveled to the past, scene hair might have been around but not as prevalent as today. Makeup also has gone to retro pin up looks where it would fit in in the 50's and today but not in 1999. Skinny jeans for men weren't really a thing in 99 unless you were in a band and that even in the eighties guys in bands used skinny jeans but not until the 2010's did tthe male population begin wearing them more frequently. I dunno if I agree with your assumption here."
MandelaEffect,2wjig9,nyteangeldwr,8,Tue Feb 24 00:03:58 2015 UTC,"If you threw that 2003 party, you could put ponchos on the girls- my girlfriend  and her friends wore these and I remember one day we saw a local news anchor with a lime green poncho.

MandelaEffect,2wjig9,DrCosmoMcKinley,4,Mon Feb 23 20:23:08 2015 UTC,"I never saw anyone wear those in the USA unless it was raining and they didn't have something better to wear, and if I didn't have anything better to wear I'd just have gotten soaked because ponchos, ew never a good look on anyone in ANY time!"

I saw hipsters and yuppies back in 99 too, they wouldn't have been shocked by anything from today. The thing with skinny jeans is that they already had an era before 99. Take a look at videos of people on The King's Road in the 80s."
MandelaEffect,2wjig9,MusicFoMe,29,Wed Feb 25 03:08:56 2015 UTC,"That's because people kind of stick with the type of clothes they wore when they were younger and cared more about fashion. It's not like your grandma was wearing the cool clothes everyone else was wearing in 95.  Watch old MTV stuff, TRL or Real World or True Life from 99 and tell me those people don't look markedly different than 18-25 year olds today."
MandelaEffect,2wjig9,idwthis,5,Wed Feb 25 03:12:00 2015 UTC,I know this is an old thread but my go-to example is: how weirded out would you be if you saw a middle-schooler wearing a No Fear shirt in today's age?
MandelaEffect,2wjig9,nyteangeldwr,3,Sun Feb 22 14:26:12 2015 UTC,"Probably a lot. Also, I'd be weirded out if I saw a middle schooler wearing a Peace Frogs t-shirt right now."

MandelaEffect,2wjig9,burf,10,Sat Mar 28 10:27:54 2015 UTC,"That's simply not true. People are nostalgic about the 00's. If I were going to a 00's retro party, I'd wear G-Star clothes and either Vans or Reeboks. Then I'd spike my hair and listen to Nik & Jay. They were Hella big back then."
MandelaEffect,2wjig9,Psydan,22,Sun Feb 22 22:44:10 2015 UTC,"You're just old and refuse to change with the fashion. Jean washes and fits have changed notably, glasses frames, hairstyles (WWI/II era hairstyles), facial hair (way more thick beards) popularity, just to name a few.   Same thing musically. I listen to top 40 all the time and there are distinct differences in the choices made by producers, even when creating the most mainstream pop you can think of. Hip-hop influence made way for house influence, which then made way for drum n bass/dubstep influence in terms of electronic pop; there was also a resurgence of ""new wave"" style music, and addition of a substantial bluegrass influence (thanks, Mumford & Sons) to alternative music."
MandelaEffect,2wjig9,DrCosmoMcKinley,6,Mon Feb 23 17:17:19 2015 UTC,"I kinda dispute this because I found pictures of my dad when he was in his 20s, in the 1980s, and he was wearing exactly what I typically wear today, down to the color of his hoodie and the wash of his jeans, though he never wore those things in pictures from when I was growing up.   Anyway, maybe the kids who grew up around 99-01 have their consciousness impacted by things like Y2K fear, 9/11, Iraq war, etc. Maybe they have nothing to be nostalgic about, and therefore nothing to do a theme party about 10 years later. Was anyone actually hip in 2000?"
MandelaEffect,2wjig9,itsgallus,3,Tue Feb 24 06:38:09 2015 UTC,As I recall the twin courses of hipness were the Internet and geek cultures on one hand and the west coast tattoos & skater style on the other. Being in a rock band with two web designers I saw a lot of both in 2000.
MandelaEffect,2wjig9,Miannina,15,Mon Feb 23 19:05:50 2015 UTC,"Well, in the 90's you didn't look back at the 80's as retro. 80's stuff was just old 90's stuff. I guess that's what we feel about the 2000's right now. Think about this again in 2025 and I guarantee you'll find the 2000's nostalgic."
MandelaEffect,2wjig9,xrimane,7,Mon Feb 23 21:24:26 2015 UTC,I was born in 1983 and everything from the early 80s looked positively archaic to me as a teenager. Definitely retro.
MandelaEffect,2wjig9,itsgallus,8,Wed Feb 25 03:19:22 2015 UTC,"Well, in the 90's you didn't look back at the 80's as retro.   Yes, we did. 80s music, hair, clothes were far, far away already in 1993. We thought the sixties and seventies were cool, and the eighties ridiculous."
MandelaEffect,2wjig9,moschles,3,Fri Feb 20 15:34:00 2015 UTC,I'm going to say this depends on where you're from. Maybe your country was ahead of mine. Or it's because I'm from a small town.
MandelaEffect,2wjig9,UniversalChairs,3,Sat Feb 21 15:28:11 2015 UTC,"Note that     1992-1977 = 15.   2015-2000 = 15.   Let's compare the changes in music from 1977 to 1992.    Joe Cocker  (1974)   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvAr9umnZ54  vs.   Nine Inch Nails  (1989) http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV2EUUF47Ms  Now, what has changed since 2000?    Think about it.   On a radio station in 1992, you could play Joe Cocker's song, and say ""we are playing oldies"".    ""We are your no.1 Oldies station in the metro area"".  Etc.      What song could you possibly play from 2000 and pretend to be playing oldies?"
MandelaEffect,2wjig9,tikhung01,3,Mon Feb 23 18:59:37 2015 UTC,"I thoroughly disagree. In the early 2000s pop music on the radio didn't have all this dubstep influence.

MandelaEffect,2wjig9,Fissr,-2,Fri Mar 27 15:31:45 2015 UTC,"It could be that, for example since the 60/70's all the trends were made upon imagined  concepts on how they imagined 'future'. You know, all the technology was improving, air travel became more popular and an every day thing, things that people thought were impossible, like space travel became a reality.. People were thinking that in a decade things would be dramatically different again and the possibilities are limitless. So now, when we look around, things that were new at older times, like TVs, cell phones, planes, cars, just have a different design, but the function is pretty much the same. Now most people have realized that the more things like space travel on a regular basis and levitating cars impractical and very expensive, (or they're made to believe so) people stopped looking forward to it, to the 'future'.  Possibly, if you believe in conspiracy theories, the super-rich elite of few people actually have their personal space ships and they have 'futuristic' technology, e.g. to change the weather, which if it was available to the masses, could change the world for the better, but it's cheaper to keep them dumb and depressed while they make them profit, increasing their wealth. Basically the elite have the means to make the 'future' happen but won't do it because they need people to make them money who think there's nothing more to life than work, falsely thinking they could get rich working which is their driving force."

Specifically, I remember seeing a trailer for Cars in the theaters years before any of the actual trailers came out. I remember my whole family thinking it looked good, and my dad particularly enjoying the car-name puns for the celebrity cameos. I also remember asking my mom when she thought that movie was going to come out several months after seeing the trailer and her not having any recollection of it. So when trailers started showing up for it again much, much later I was glad I wasn't nuts. I don't know, maybe I'm just misremembering the time frame (probably), but I could have sworn it was 2-3 years before the movie premiered and since you mentioned your Cars experience I thought I'd share mine."

The most common videos feature unintentional physical comedy (arising from incidents, accidents, and mishaps), pets or children, and some staged practical jokes.  Originally airing as a special on November 26, 1989, it debuted as a regular weekly series on January 14, 1990. Initially, it was hosted by Bob Saget for the 1989 special and the first eight seasons of the series incarnation, then by John Fugelsang and Daisy Fuentes for its ninth and tenth seasons. After two years of being shown as occasional specials, hosted by various actors and comedians such as D.L. Hughley and Richard Kind, ABC brought the series back on Friday nights in the summer of 2001 with new host Tom Bergeron, who has since become the series' longest-serving host. Season 24 began on October 13, 2013.   Before the show was renewed for a 25th season in May 2014, Bergeron announced in March 2014 that he will not be hosting the show after that season.

The eye scene is iconic.  You also probably did remember the actual experience of riding through a dark tunnel with abstract things being projected around you, which would have been the Peoplemover ride which didn't close until `95. I have decided I just combined these two memories.   Of course an alternate universe where it closed much later is possible, but then that would mean Star Tours didn't open until the early to mid 90's.

Mistaken reports of his death of article  Abe Vigoda:       In 1982, People magazine mistakenly referred to Vigoda as dead. At the time, Vigoda was performing in a stage play in Calgary.  He took the mistake with good humor, posing for a photograph published in Variety in which he was sitting up in a coffin, holding the erroneous issue of People.

MandelaEffect,2v3eoc,rantan1618,4,Sun Feb 8 06:03:55 2015 UTC,The version i saw was on HBO and i watched it nearly every single time it was on. I watched it prolly 50 times on tv THEN i downloaded the MP3s and videos of his performances. at one point i had every stand up special he'd ever done except sexie because that one sucked.  I dont remember this san fran bit at all but also feel like this may be from a difference performance than the HBO special i saw.  idk this is really weird but i sort of lean towards this fact...  Stand up comedians are always trying new material even on established tours. They test out bits and shuffle stuff around to fine tune the show. I suspect that Eddie used the same outfit and background on this tour so it's not surprising if he appears to be saying stuff you dont remember.

There definitely wasn't a little one, if I'd seen Baby Tooth I probably wouldn't have found the segment creepy because Baby Tooth is adorable. I suspect that these guys predated the ones that I saw since the clips look pretty 80's.  The reason I took this to Mandela Effect is because the style of these segments is so similar to what I remember but the characters and music is wrong.  Edit: I guess it's possible you're right, there's a lot of parts where Baby Tooth isn't in these clips and since I avoided these segments I probably don't remember it that clearly. But I'd still love if someone could dig up the clip I remember-- it was very ambient music.   Second edit: This COULD be it. Seeing this makes me think you're right, the characters are much fuzzier than in the other clips and match a lot more what I remember.

MandelaEffect,2tfjxv,TheRealEndfall,19,Fri Jan 23 19:10:07 2015 UTC,Thank you for sharing your theory. It does make a lot of sense in terms of glitches. However it arises couple of question for me and I'd really appreciate if you could explain these for me:  1- Since it is clear to me that I am aging so if all goes well I will still die of old age by probably 80 years of age. how will quantum immortality correct for that?   2- Does it mean we are in a time loop or does it mean that we get to relive the same entire life again and again? How do you chose the point of start?
MandelaEffect,2tfjxv,bakingchicken,8,Fri Jan 23 22:19:27 2015 UTC,"As regards the first question, I believe that you simply won't. Quantum immortality is perhaps best summed as ""You aren't going to die. Everything else is fair game.""  Senescence is not necessarily a cause of death. Your survival becomes less probable, but only asymptotically approaches zero. Your probability of death never reaches one. Needless to say, I really hope human antisenescence technology outpaces aging in a reasonable timeframe.  For the second, I don't see a necessary contradiction in a self observing system observing it's own creation. So, quite simply, we were born when we were born. Nothing special governed the circumstances of our origination. Until we began observing ourselves - and that doesn't necessarily imply consciousness - the universe interacted with us as it would any other dead matter. We are that which rose from the froth of the sea of possibility."
MandelaEffect,2tfjxv,General_Josh,13,Sat Jan 24 00:21:55 2015 UTC,"Can I have an ELI5 of that first bit please?   The first bit makes sense to me, I constructed a similar theory myself around the 'universe splits whenever you make a decision' part of quantum mechanics.  Say you're crossing the road and BAM, you're hit by a bus. You just split the universe in two. For everyone else, you just got hit by a bus, people miss you, there will be a funeral. But for you, you step into the road without looking but catch yourself just intime to avoid being hit. You stop for a few seconds and think about how close you just came to death. My theory is that in some of these near death experiences, you actually die, but confusing quantum stuff that nobody really understands carries your cosciense over to another universe. This also explains why so many of the posts over in /r/glitchinthematrix are about people dieing then suddenly flashing forward to a universe where nothing happened.  But this doesn't cover death from old age and I didn't really understand what you wrote."
MandelaEffect,2tfjxv,General_Josh,3,Sun Feb 8 00:21:57 2015 UTC,"So basically it goes like this. The laws of physics are quite strong in terms of how they enforce the behaviour of the universe but they're probabilisitic in nature, so if we look at the behaviour of, say, an electron, it has a giant chance of it being where we expect an electron to be (orbiting the nucleus of an atom, say) and much less of being anywhere else (floating in empty space, for example), but never a zero chance of being anywhere else. This is true of not just electrons, but everything that exists.  The most important thing about this is that the chances of unexpected behaviour get really small, really fast. We're not talking small in a way that humans usually encounter either. I don't mean one in a thousand, or one in a million. I mean numbers like 0.0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001.  Now, when you probability of dying is 100%, you will proceed down any worldline where it isn't - even worldlines far more unlikely than one with a 0.00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001% chance of happening under normal circumstances.  Age, though, never gets you to a 100% chance of death. It only gets closer and closer. Something like:  70yo - 75% of death 80yo - 90% 90yo - 99.96%  100yo - 99.999945% 110yo - 99.9999999999937%    etc  - although the real numbers probably move towards 100% more slowly than my example.  That kind of bahaviour - getting endlessly close to something, in this case, 100%, without ever actually reaching it, is what I meant by asymptotic.  Now, to an abstract game of chance. Say there's a lottery you have 1-1000 odds of winning, but you have insider info on ticket distribution that increases your chances of wining. Let's say decent info doubles your chances: you now have 2-1000 (or better phrased, 1-500) odds. There are even better qualities of information available which quadruple (1-250) or even octuple your odds of winning (1-125). At a high enough quality of information, your victory becomes certain (1000-1000, 1-1, 1, 100%). Just because you now have information that assures that you win, though, doesn't mean that you can't keep increasing the quality - no, you can get even better information, but there's essentially no point, because you can't increase your chances of winning past 100%. In the real world, there is never, ever something with greater than 100% or less than 0% probability. If it looks like there is, someone has messed up the math.  That lottery concept is similar to what's happening with worldline slips. There's one difference: Instead of a single game, it's like there are multiple games, and increasing the quality of your information increases your chances for all of them. Translating the metaphor, increasing the quality of information is equivalent to a higher chance of dying, and winning a game is equivalent to an inconsistent world of variable probability.  So. In terms of our metaphor, a 100% chance of death is equivalent to information of infinite quality: It lets you win every game, no matter the odds, it lets you access any worldline, no matter how improbable, so long as it isn't utterly impossible1 .  Age, meanwhile, is equivalent to increasing the quality of information endlessly, but no matter how much you increase it, there will always be some games/worlds that you just can't win/access . I think that this necessarily includes really inconsistent ones where things that have no real bearing on your survival change. When you drop a 100% chance of death into the system, it doesn't matter how improbable a world is, just that you're still alive in it. This allows uttely nonprobable worlds such as with the amazon supervolcano ending up in yellowstone post-slip in my original example. With any non-100% chance (which is the only type age can create), the system will still behave in ways that are as consistent as possible while preventing your death - so your survival is still enforced, but weirder things also won't happen.  Here's a comparitive example of 100% and non-100% chances of death.  An angry god creates a one cubic kilometre cube of iron right on top of your head: 100% chance of death in the next second as it splatters you. Only way to not die is in futures where, for example, the cube ceases to exist, or where the wavefunctions for its consituent particles spontaneously end up with random positions all over the observable universe (and therefore, no longer consisting of a cubic kilometre of iron right above your head.) Since there's a 100% chance involved, other crap can slip in, and often does if it helps increase the overall probability of you not dying (therefore being a wider path in parametre space).  Non-100%: The god sets an asteroid on a collision course with where your home is, ensuring it will become a crater of magma. You spontaneously decide to take a vacation that you weren't planning, and are on the other side of the planet when it happens. Your continent is a death zone, but you survived.  Incidentally, in at least a few worldlines, there will be versions of you who stay at home until it's too late to escape death by asteroid. Their scenarios resolve as ones with 100% chances of death do. But the vast majority of potential yous will just not be there in the first place.  Hope this helps.  1 Example: A world where a particle doing something specifically disallowed by physics comes into existence, like a neutron moving at the speed of light."
MandelaEffect,2tfjxv,General_Josh,11,Tue Feb 10 16:43:30 2015 UTC,"This is all entirely coming out of people's asses.  It's a fun thought experiment, nothing more.  It stems from the fact that we've never had a first-hand account from someone who's died, so we can't say for sure that anyone actually has died.  Occam's razor says that the simplest explanation is usually the correct one when there's no clear evidence for either side.  The simple answer here is that you live, then you die."
MandelaEffect,2tfjxv,NormalNONdoctorHuman,5,Wed Feb 11 01:26:24 2015 UTC,"Just a mild point of order. The simplest explanation which adheres to known evidential facts. Knowing what I know about quantum mechanics, namely, that they are real1 (and more, but that's the only important quality for this), the simplest explanation for their reality seems to be many worlds, since that is the only one that does not require that our world be in any way special. And then QI appears as an absolutely inevitable implication of it.  1 Where the standard for their reality is the experimental confirmation of quantum effects - I'm not saying that our models are 1-1 representations, just that the phenomena they model exists and does, in fact, behave in accordance."
MandelaEffect,2tfjxv,Tux_the_Penguin,6,Wed Feb 11 01:48:42 2015 UTC,"Alright, sure, I don't know enough about the theory behind it to argue with that.  The problem I have is that your argument seems to presuppose the existence of some sort of immaterial soul.  My point is that we have zero evidence showing that consciousness isn't just a result of material interactions.  It's a lot simpler to say that your consciousness simply ceases to exist at the point of death than it is to say that it travels into some parallel world, into a 'you' that technically isn't you, and assumes control of that vessel."
MandelaEffect,2tfjxv,Yivoe,7,Wed Feb 11 02:39:22 2015 UTC,"What. No it doesn't. It absolutely doesn't. I'm a materialist. I don't believe in souls.   Also, I am not arguing that our consciousness transfers into another body. Absolutely not. My argument is that, when the probability of death reaches a high enough level, you are constrained to perceive the set of possible futures where the world itself behaves in such a way as to remove the probability, because in all other worlds, you are dead and therefore not perceiving.  Because one of the fundamental tenets of QM is that the entirety of everything is probabilistic, and because wavefunctions don't have areas of zero probabilty, there is no such thing as an infinitely improbable world if either time or space is infinite, and most theories assume one of the two is.  Okay, here's an intuitive example. Flip a simplified coin. Assume that the coin is self aware, and constantly thinking ""I am alive."" Constrain it to just three possible outcomes: Heads, Tails, and Split (where it stands on its sides.  The respective probability is:  Heads - 49.95% Tails - 49.95% Split - 0.1%    Finally, if the coin lands on heads or tails, lets stipulate that we will incinerate it with a perfectly accurate 100% lethal lasergun.  Now, in which of the three possible futures is the coin thinking ""I am alive""? Only the one where it lands on split. Execute the flip.  To represent the probabilities above, 10000 worlds have to be generated (4995 heads-worlds, 4995 tails-worlds, 10 split-worlds). You have a 99.9% chance of witnessing to coin being destroyed, so that happens. The coin has a 0.1% chance of witnessing its continued existence, but of course, it can't witness itself being dead - so the only world it witnesses is the one where it lives, even though its a 1 in 1000 chance. That is the operation of many worlds. Just replace one coin with every particle, one flip with every instant in time, three outcomes with n outcomes, where n is the number of valid positions in space.  Edit: Mathfix."
MandelaEffect,2tfjxv,TriumphantGeorge,3,Wed Feb 11 03:32:48 2015 UTC,"OK, I better see where you're coming from now.  When you made your point about the super-volcano, I thought you were saying that your consciousness would switch to a universe where the volcano had always been under Yellowstone.  It was a bit confusingly worded, since it would be vastly more probable for the volcano to simply not go off than for it to teleport.  However, I still disagree with your premise.  If I remove a single brain cell from myself, am I still the same consciousness?  Your argument would implicitly answer in the affirmative, since I personally shed hundreds of thousands of brain cells every day.  Could I continue to remove brain cells until I had effectively lobotomized myself?  If I killed all but one brain cell, would that single cell continue to live forever?  I don't think an argument could be made for a single cell being conscious, but where do you draw the line?  There are many more states than ""aware"" and ""dead"".  There's a lot of fuzziness in the quantum immortality theory, which is what make's me think it's more a philosophical argument than a physical one."

I disagree with the fact that we may retain certain incorrect facts in our memory, causing the Mandela Effect, though, since that consciousness will have always lived in that improbable world.  Also, to refer to your earlier comment, how does dying of old age not count? Even though you aren't sure of your death while aging, eventually you will begin to die, at which point your probability of death becomes 1. Should that not count?"
MandelaEffect,2tfjxv,Wxlson,3,Wed Feb 11 05:08:20 2015 UTC,Well if it makes you feel better this is all complete and 100% speculation and has no evidence backing it up other than thoughts.
MandelaEffect,2tfjxv,Wxlson,1 point,Thu May 7 19:42:05 2015 UTC,"There are interpretations of QM that are incompatible with QI. Generally, I think they are wrong because they lack the sheer elegance that many-worlds has (they all fail to explain why the present state of reality was preferable to other states. Many worlds just says that there is no preferable state, and you only find yourself in the one you're in because you were born there.)  Of course, I am a human, and therefore, I could be wrong. We'll see. Don't feel bad about betting against me if it helps your psychological equanimity. The first responsibility of anyone is to live the best life that they can."
MandelaEffect,2tfjxv,Wxlson,5,Wed Feb 11 01:45:55 2015 UTC,"I can't speak for the others, but for my part, I just accept what is. Part of my life philosophy is that what other people and the world can do to you pales in comparison to what you can do to yourself, so I've decided that I'll just not torture myself with the implications of an idea like QI. Instead, I'll accept them, and move on. Life is too long to spend most of it suffering, and at a more direct level, we don't even know if that thing about being alone is true. Macroscopic objects have been put in quantum superpositions before, and from that we know that (if MW is correct) braiding worldlines is possible. It might be possible one day to track down versions of people who lived where your version of them died. I do not believe it is a necessary implication of QI that we are alone forever, only that we live forever.  As far as your question about concioussness transfers goes, I think its an error in conception. I haven't bothered questioning it because some people might be doing it intentionally because they're into new age spiritual stuff, and that is really, really, really an argument that I don't feel like having. It's not what this thread is for."
MandelaEffect,2tfjxv,TriumphantGeorge,2,Wed Feb 11 02:28:16 2015 UTC,"Question:  So if you believed in this, you could put a gun to your head, pull the trigger, and still be alive?  Every single time?  Gun will jam, you survive the wound, you're a vegetable forever, whatever it is, but you live on in another world?  Of course you couldn't prove this was happening to you, but if you believed it and knew, you could keep attempting suicide with a 100% chance of success and end up in a different world each time?  Is there ever a chance you end up in a world that would be different than yours in some way?  Maybe you're now in the world Hitler is residing in as an old man or something?  Or is every world unique to the person and so the world pretty much revolves around you?  Edit:  read another one of your replies and you mentioned that it may be possible to interconnect worlds some day and find ones where others have survived while they hadn't in your world, basically answers my question.  Still leaves the possibility of many, many suicide attempts to try to rediscover a loved one in another world... There's a movie in there somewhere...  Edit 2:  As for old age, doesn't the body start to deteriorate at a specific point?  Doesn't it get so old it can get necrotic regardless.  Your body starts to die, and shrivels into nothing at some point.  So in this case... Where do you go?  Do you always go to a world where the death didn't happen?  Where you get 10 more seconds of survival?  Or do you start over in a world that is ""slower"" than yours and you're younger.  But if that were the case, you'd think someone would remember that happening... Or maybe they did and we called them crazy, who knows..."
MandelaEffect,2tfjxv,nubianfemme,3,Wed Feb 11 02:32:12 2015 UTC,"Regarding your second edit, I answered how age is logically constrained to function with QI here: https://pay.reddit.com/r/MandelaEffect/comments/2tfjxv/we_are_all_constantly_dying_forever/coeiynq  The important thing is that Age is not like a bullet wound to the head. It is a partial degredation of every cell in the body. Each cell degrades in its own unique way. There are countless ways for even a single cell to degrade. So unlike a shotgun blast to the head, which kills you with probability 1, and is a single event, ageing is an accumulation of billions upon billions of tiny, almost-harmless events, all with fairly low probability. All that needs to happen is for you to have few enough of these events to continue living; two few to die to cascading organ failure or somesuch.  Age itself isn't ever actually letha. It's always age related disease. If someone didn't get age related disease, they could live as long as there was energy to continue living.  For example:L The naked mole rat. Most rat sized rodents live for about 2-3 years. Naked mole rats are the mammal equivalents of termites (eusocial subterranian colony formers), and are so good at living in their chosen environment that they basically don't die to predation. This has allowed them to relax their breeding cycles, and has resulted in rats that live for 30+ years. This would be equivalent to a human living for about seven centuries. The reason why most rat-sized rodents live for three years and we observe people who aren't us to only live for about seventy is that  rats and human ancestor species were predated, and so they couldn't evolve incredibly long lifespans.  But for quantum immortals, that doesn't matter. We can only be alive in worlds where our bodies do not break down, do not die, do not attain that one last critical bit of damage. Hence, we will observe being alive in only those worldlines.  Somewhere, in parametre space, Julius Caesar still rules Rome, and all the world worships their gods."

Or are we interpreting this too literally - you do eventually ""die"" but what actually happens is...    INTERMISSION  On the second question - when you go to sleep, just before, you see fragments and sparkles (hypnagogia) which later forms a dream environment, and your dream begins. This includes a ""dream you"" in the dream. In other words, a person and a world are both born at that point. The observer, the observed and the context of both all arise simultaneously.    ...at that point we realise that we are the dreamers of our body and of the world. The images and sensations fade away, not us! Upon realising this we then create a new environment to have fun in, but knowingly so.  We might then view our experiences as individual 'dream bubbles' which are loosely interconnected with other 'dream bubbles', rather than being literal bodies on a literal planet.

MandelaEffect,2t1b0g,falling_into_fate,1 point,Wed Jan 21 04:41:56 2015 UTC,I used to do deposits at the ATM in the mid 90s. It was only available at machine located inside the bank that could do deposits and only if you had an account with that bank.
MandelaEffect,2t1b0g,headstab,1 point,Tue Jan 20 12:34:41 2015 UTC,"News to me too. When I first opened my checking account as a teenager I had to be taught how to use the ATM and I'm positive I remember the bank having to stress the point that ATMs don't do deposits and never have, which was a bummer for me though it made perfect sense."

Ashton Kutcher was the early breakout star of the show.  Dude Where's My Car was released in 2000, but Punk'd didn't premiere until three years later, in 2003.  If we look at the ratings, we see that there was an uptick in viewership starting in Season 4 (2001-02).  I guess my point is that a lot of people would remember the show from this post-2000 time period, rather than the first 1.5 seasons that took place at the end of the '90s."

And I do remember also him driving away.   Many movies have alternative endings. And for some reason TV and Netflix all have the version of him staring off into the distance instead of the version where he drives away.  But you watched this on a DVD so idk....
MandelaEffect,2sh6ke,Catryna,3,Fri Jan 16 05:36:46 2015 UTC,"Actually hardly any movies have alternate endings. That's what make it so weird.  Films will have different 'Cuts' for length, you can look them up under 'technical specs' on IMDB. However 'different endings' are actually pretty rare."

I also stumbled on the ""different endings"" that people seem to remember... supposedly the Australian version, for whatever reason, had an extended version? It's so weird that I can't find anything concrete on this."

Then i think he jumps in with her and they go off.  Maybe my brain made up that ending because i didnt like the real ending too much. Or maybe i dreamt an alternative ending??"

I remember being in line at the theme park Idlewild, which until this year actually had a ride called Mr. Roger's Neighborhood of Make Believe, and some kids were trying to be cool and were making fun of him dying.

So now I googled it again and it says he DID die when I originally thought: 2003! This is extremely frightening to me, because I remember all the hoopla-- and not just social media posts, but news articles, obits, etc.-- around his death when I was in college (which could be 2007-2012), and being so weirded out then because I knew he'd already died.

The song was written and performed by Neil Cicierega under the pseudonym ""Lemon Demon"", with art and Flash animation by Shawn Vulliez.  ""The Ultimate Showdown"" is a massive, city-wide battle set in Tokyo started by Godzilla and Batman ultimately involving dozens of pop-culture icons, fictional and otherwise, ending with Mr. Rogers emerging victorious and then committing seppuku. It gained a large cult following among web enthusiasts  and became the ""User's Choice"" on December 28, 2005 on Newgrounds, where it has been viewed over 12 million times.  It appeared on several other websites including Albino Blacksheep,  YouTube, Transbuddha, and Weebl's Stuff. As of January 2013 [update], it had over 11.5 million views on YouTube.   The song topped the ""Funny Five"" on The Dr. Demento Show for several weeks and was the #1 Request for 2006.  The video has since been parodied and referenced repeatedly in other flash videos. A new version of the song was later recorded specifically for the Rock Band Network and was released for the service on July 6, 2010 under the title The Ultimate Showdown (RBN Mix). It has recently been redone live by the full band for Lemon Demon's new album, ""Live (Only Not)"".

She was the star in the popular sitcom Ellen from 1994 to 1998, and has hosted her syndicated talk show The Ellen DeGeneres Show since 2003.  Her stand up career started in the early 1980s, culminating in a 1986 appearance on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson, who likened her to Bob Newhart, and invited her for an onscreen chat after her set. She was the first comedienne invited by Johnny Carson to join him, a national, and the most influential endorsement available at the time for comics. As a film actress, she starred in Mr. Wrong (1996), appeared in EDtv (1999), and The Love Letter (1999), and provided the voice of Dory in the Pixar animated film Finding Nemo (2003), for which she was awarded the Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actress, the first time an actress won a Saturn Award for a voice performance. In 2010 she was a judge on American Idol for its ninth season.  She starred in two television sitcoms, Ellen from 1994 to 1998, and The Ellen Show from 2001 to 2002. During the fourth season of Ellen in 1997, she came out publicly as lesbian in an appearance on The Oprah Winfrey Show. Shortly afterwards, her character, Ellen Morgan, also came out to a therapist played by Winfrey, and the series went on to explore various LGBT issues including the coming-out process. In 2008, she married her long-time girlfriend Portia de Rossi.

The birthday scene stuck with me as well.   Even now though, I'm sorta-sure I saw it and then skipped through the boring bits to see them build the time machine, see the pretty people, and see the bit at the party - but I can't find any DVD or file or whatever.  EDIT: According to the old ""official database"" it may have been leaked online about 10 months ago, but no other trace. Or those might have been the usual fakes that appear around release times.  EDIT2: Meanwhile, the Wikipedia page history shows that - spoilers in link - the full plot was only added on 31 January 2015 so I can't even have cheated by looking it up last year.

It was originally published in 1979 under the title Only Love.  Here is an entire thread on it.  Synopsis from a goodreads user is below:   Sweet Frannie by Susan Sallis features a young woman who has been disabled from birth, who goes to live at a home for young people with a variety of disabilities. She gradually falls in love with a young man who has been sent there after his legs were amputated following a motorcycle accident. It doesn't match Lisa's description - in Sweet Frannie, the boy is angrier than the girl - but both protagonists soften as their romance progresses."

MandelaEffect,2qg8oz,katihathor,34,Fri Dec 26 15:38:02 2014 UTC,"So I know this entire subreddit is kinda dedicated to words changing from what people remember reading, but I think there's a genuine reason as to why this happens.  I'm dyslexic, and constantly mis-read words. My most well remembered example is to do with the game Morrowind. I had the map that came with it on my wall, and forever read the name of the location that Morrowind is in as Vlanderfall, when it's real name is Vvardenfell.  See here: http://tes.ag.ru/articles/geography/img/mw_goty_map.jpg  I never noticed, and would even talk about it to others as Vlanderfall, on the internet and in person, and nobody pulled me up on it. Then one day, the words were just different. I'd been reading it wrong, and I think I know why.  As I said, I'm dyslexic, so I underwent an exam to test just how bad I am (quite bad), and they asked me specifically if words suddenly being correct had ever happened, to which I gave a resounded ""Yes!"".  Turns out, this is due to the brain looking at the ""shape"" of words, rather than the individual letters.  Here's a wikipedia article on the subject: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_recognition#Bouma_shape  Apparently I had learned to read the shape of a word, and make a leap of judgement as to what a word actually was because reading the real word was simply too exhausting.  I believe that this is common whether you're dyslexic or not. Every example of people reporting it on this sub-reddit seems to fit with this theory too, as all the words are very similar in ""shape""/""outline"". For example, you mention ""Critical"" being replaced with ""Crucial"", and these words start and end with the same letters, and to me have the exact same shape.  That's my theory anyway. I may make a full post on it..."

MandelaEffect,2qg8oz,ftfstko,13,Wed Dec 31 18:46:42 2014 UTC,"Yeah, I'm almost the opposite of dyslexic, and I've never had a word suddenly change spelling.  Replying to OP, there's no reason whatsoever for ""definately"" being a word. It's the adverb form of ""definite"", hence the spelling. There's a common mix up between ""definitely"" and ""immediately"" (adv. ""immediate"") from which this confusion has arisen.  ""Dilemna"" is just as etymologically ludicrous.   As much as I love glitches and the Mandela effect, some are just too dumb to idly stand by and watch."

Till I saw he immediately addressed that word as well.   Growing up I was always extremely good with spelling, including words that, to me, didn't make sense in terms of how they were spelled. I've always been good at spelling someone's name perfectly as long as I've seen it written down once,even with really 'hard'  'ethnic'  names as a kid. I read so much as a kid that I'm still sometimes coming across words that I knew, and just never happened to hear someone else say, up to 10 or 15 years after reading the book.   I was so sure about it being spelled dilemna. I always thought that that was a stupid way to spell a word, but whatever, fine, that's how it is. I didn't find out till I was like 20 that I'd been spelling it wrong my whole life. This is the only word that I've been so sure about that turned out to be spelled differently. It drives me nuts every time I think about  it.   I want to post a question about why this common misperception might happen. The ""shape of the word""  thing in general makes sense, but I want to know more about this phenomenon and what makes the word dilemma so special."

Bouma shape of article  Word recognition:       Bouma shape, named after the Dutch psychologist Herman Bouma, refers to the overall outline, or shape, of a word.  Herman Bouma discussed the role of “global word shape” in his word recognition experiment conducted in 1973.  Theories of bouma shape became popular in word recognition, suggesting people recognize words from the shape the letters make in a group relative to each other.  This contrasts the idea that letters are read individually. Instead, via prior exposure, people become familiar with outlines, and thereby recognize them the next time they are presented with the same word, or bouma.

I'd consider something like that more of a hallucination than a timeline glitch.  The vast majority of the changes have happened from one day to the next, where I had a period of sleep in between.  Those ones I consider to be real, valid memories.  A lot of them I've verified at the time they've happened with other people who also remember things ""wrong"".  I have had psychotic episodes where I've been up for days on end and have hallucinated things...like seeing things differently in my left eye than my right eye, like different words on a page of text, different colors, etc.  Or staring at a clock and seeing the second hand start ticking backwards or skipping forwards several seconds at a time.  One time I had a whole week loop and had to re-live it half a dozen times.  Another time everyone just froze for a few minutes like in this video hoax: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jwMj3PJDxuo  It sounds so far out there, but reality can get really dream-like and malleable in a state of psychosis.    The problem with psychotic memories is it's hard to say how much of it is real and how much is confabulation.  Although some of the Mandela Effect stuff could be considered delusional, the fact that others are remembering these things too distinguishes it somewhat from psychosis.  Unfortunately it seems like exploring the rabbit hole too deeply on these timeline glitches can lead me on a path to psychosis where all bets are off, but I would love to make some sense of this phenomenon.  I'm just glad this subreddit exists to document this stuff, it was what I had intended to do with /r/matrixupdates back when I had my last manic episode and thought I had unraveled a lot of the mystery.  I do think sleep has something to do with it though.  It seems to be the mechanism with which these kind of ""matrix updates"" occur.  Sometimes the updates don't take for some reason and then you end up with conflicting memories.  And this stuff can get really glitchy when sleep-deprived.  Sorry for the wall of text, I just have been thinking about this a lot since I found out about this subreddit, kind of got off on a tangent ;)"

I've never heard of someone so ""commonly"" jumping through timeline glitches, which is why your story was interesting to me.  Human memories are notoriously unreliable, so it's entirely possible there's no such thing as a ""timeline glitch"" and you're simply misremembering the world you live in. It's certainly an occums razor answer for most of these little difficulties, but I suspect there's a much more subtle phenomenon going on here.  I would very much consider seeing a neurologist for the sake of certainty. The time sync issue could be anything, though it's the closest thing to ""something approaching soft evidence"" that I've heard in this sphere.  Do you have any more details about that event?

This elicits an overestimation in the temporal duration for which that target stimulus (i.e., postsaccadic stimulus) was perceived. This effect can extend apparent durations by up to 500 ms and is consistent with the idea that the visual system models events prior to perception.

MandelaEffect,2qg8oz,AnotherSmegHead,2,Fri Jan 2 12:12:59 2015 UTC,"Sounds like you are living in a Philip K Dick universe, with reality dissolving and reforming around you!  The sleeping thing is interesting - as in, perhaps we mis-perceive things during the day and ""hold onto those conclusions"" while we are still running around doing stuff. When we sleep, relax and let go, things settle and the proper connections are made - our minds work out that actual situation during the downtime.  An incorrect perception can be quite persistent until sensory evidence forces it to change. Perhaps sleep is the period where we 'intellectually' work through memory evidence and reach conclusions about how things must surely be; our perceptions are modified accordingly going forward."

Found out a couple weeks later she was alive and recovering.   This is very likely to be a memory glitch.   A major NTP server which is based on an atomic clock was exactly 5 minutes off for an hour or so a year ago. It prompted me to set up a subreddit /r/matrixupdates but I never did anything with it.   This is not a glitch in the matrix / mandelaeffect. For example, it could have been a software error or the NTP server could have been hacked. In your matrixupdates subreddit you should have linked to a news post or something, or provided more details.    I was reading a book entitled Critical Conversations...from one day to the next it changed to Crucial Conversations. Was pretty blatantly obvious to me since I had been actively reading the book.   Even when actively reading a book, we don't really consciously  always read the cover of it before we start reading. That's an easy mistake to make.   The rest is quite extreme though if true. In your case, I would start a very detailed diary."

The erroneous declaration was nor corrected for hours after she'd been shot, and for some reason, was not a massively huge thread in the scope of the reporting.

It would be really cool though, if there had been some shift in our reality though. permalinksavereportgive goldreply  formatting helpreddiquette Save   that could be true but its just odd because not one person spelled it ain and it seems like the comments were made by local people of the valleyfair mn area, not out of country. (although I can't prove it) but if they are locals somebody would have noticed, even the title says stein . Since there are references to how reconized and popular the bears are in the area Someone would have even just out of habit spelled it stain if that was the true spelling. At least that's my opinion, as far as this stein stain thing goes, I feel there are actually more people who remember stein than stain which in itself makes this one even stranger. Where as other examples fewer people remember the alternate to what the current timeline shows."

MandelaEffect,2maann,Mik0ri,9,Sat Nov 15 13:52:07 2014 UTC,"Thought this may (or may not) be of some interest, spotted on the back of another Neil Jordan DVD, 'The Company Of Wolves'. Having read the post on here just the other day about the film's title, it was very fresh in my mind.  For the record, I remember it always being 'the' vampire, rather than 'a' vampire. Although in a slightly weird bit of serendipity, a couple of days after I read the original post a friend mentioned the movie as it is the 20th (I think) anniversary of its release. He remembers it as 'a' vampire.  In a bit of further coincidence, it turned out there was a screening of the movie in my town that night, with Neil Jordan himself introducing it.  When selecting a DVD to pick out earlier, I chanced upon Company Of Wolves and - Neil Jordan fresh in my mind - thought I would take it out for a quick look. And it was a quick look, I decided pretty soon that I didn't feel like watching it, but did notice this spelling on the back. Bringing me full circle back to here.  Nothing particularly weird or creepy about any of that at all, but thought the folks here might be interested.  Or not."

MandelaEffect,2maann,Jakker32,-2,Wed Mar 4 18:37:33 2015 UTC,"Not at all, I just don't get shocked by things like that. How is it shocking? I think you have to rationalize in terms of 'importance'. I don't mean it to be rude. It's not shocking. You need to ask yourself were you right? Isn't that more important? :)  People that get stuck at the shocked stage never ask more important questions. A and THE don't sound alike. Maybe that's your perception but peoples perceptions are different. To me there sound nothing like. Also it's not just about the sound. It's sound and sight. So people that saw one or the other or both, were fooled not just by the sound but what they saw and interestingly enough it's one or the other. Don't you think that interesting?"
MandelaEffect,2maann,OoohhhBaby,2,Wed Mar 4 18:41:12 2015 UTC,"You're trying to be deep and you're just being an asshole. Everyone gets shocked at different things. Like you said, all a matter of perception. Moreover if you think that ""A"" pronounced ""Uh"" not ""Ayy"" doesn't sound like ""The"" (thuh) then maybe you should go to the doctor and have your perceivers checked.   I'm not even going to comment on your perception that I'm stuck in the ""shocked"" phase. A comment like that is so ignorant considering you know nothing about me.  But here's a little tip for you, open your mind, don't jump on what others are doing as wrong. Don't form an opinion as to wether they are right or wrong, just listen to what they've said and take it into consideration.   It is the mark of an educated mind to be able to entertain a thought without accepting it.  - Aristotle"

This is not a personal attack unlike yours. My argument was to ALL that react that way but at the same time I know it's not your fault. You still have to develop your mentality.  A is a short word. It's a stab that sounds like Hey. The is longer word because it has more letter and it sounds like DUH.... What you are doing is what everyone does when they say, 'oh you must have misheard'. Peoples perceptions are INDIVIDUAL meaning that it is how YOUR INDIVIDUAL BRAIN decoded it but people are ENTRAINED to look for answers outside of themselves and end up doubting themselves and asking each other with their own perceptions.   Oh and i'm happy to be an asshole in your eyes but how about not going down that road? Does that shock you? ;)"

There's many other instances where I feel like the song is really old even though its just been released. My only explanation is that a lot of songs these days recycle similar beats and chords, and also that a lot of artists seem to sample old songs these days so maybe its just our brains recognizing that in a weird way but I don't know. Regardless its a weird feeling and its interesting to know others experience it too!"

I never think too much of it. However, now you reminded me, when Demons by Imagine Dragons came out in 2013 I had a very emotional response to it. I felt like I definitely heard it many years before and maybe they did a cover of it or something. When I say emotion I mean, I feel a lump in my throat and almost tear up every time I hear it now. I have no idea why and I've never been able to find a song that sounds even remotely like it."
MandelaEffect,2l8bjn,aliinakay,1 point,Wed Nov 5 09:37:05 2014 UTC,"When I first heard ""Trouble is a Friend"" by Lenka, I thought it was a song from the 90s. Turns out it came out in 2008 or so (I had never heard it until this year, though!) BUT! I'm sure the melody is almost identical to a popular ""alternative"" song from the 90s. I just can't seem to put my finger on the name of the song or the artist, and I'm obsessed with finding out if it's all in my head or if it's really a song.  Also, when Rihanna's ""Umbrella"" was first released I felt like it was an exact rip-off of another song. I guess it isn't, but it's probably that it's a straight-up rendition of Pachelbel's canon that makes it seem so familiar."

It was like the narrator was lulling me into a deep sleep and I didn't want to turn it off. I've seen the trailer before, but I never felt like I did earlier. So I turned it off and suddenly felt awake again.   Watch it and see if you feel like that, too (I might just be tired, but I was not that tired)."

Once again I must iterate- it is important however maybe have one thread JUST for that rather than fresh threads for each person who believes it. This would give it it's rightful place in the effect and honour its importance and also show to others it's a big deal without the sub being filled with only that sometimes.  The last point is what I mean by it devaluing the effect, sometimes it's all you see when you come here and often all people from outside the sub hear about and to the uninitiated it's easy to point out the obvious and dismiss the whole subject.

MandelaEffect,2c7dek,AnotherSmegHead,2,Thu Jul 31 02:48:13 2014 UTC,"Oh yeah actually.  One day I believed I had a large amount of money on hand for some reason, but as the day went on I began to wonder if I had simply dreamed I had this money because I couldn't remember where I had gotten it from and when I went to count my actual savings it wasn't there.  Then I thought, ""How could I have dreamt that and continued to believe I had so much money all day when clearly this doesn't make cents?"""
MandelaEffect,2c7dek,tpm_,2,Tue Jan 20 10:38:43 2015 UTC,"I've never had dreams that extreme before, but I know I've had similar dreams where I dream that something big happens, and it really feels that it did. When I wake up I still feel very unsettled as if it really happened. I think I had one for example where my husband left me or something (we weren't having issues, either). I think it's just that, when you are dreaming, no matter what it is, you tend to think it's really happening (unless you're lucid dreaming). Your mind can dream about anything, so if for whatever reason it starts dreaming that your dad has cancer, your mind will keep going with it and you'll think it's real--hence the extreme emotions. I don't think there's anything glitchy about it, though.  After my dad passed away I kept having dreams that we were hanging out. In some of them, I would ""know"" that he was dead, but that didn't seem to bother me that we were hanging out. In others, he would ""come back"" even though I ""thought he was dead."" Sometimes, halfway through the dream, he would disappear again, and we couldn't find him. I think that's just my brain trying to rationalize and work through his death though."

We graduated the same year. When we were juniors in high school, he was on the cover of Sports Illustrated. Michael Jordan invited him around that time to play with 8 other NBA stars when he was just in high school and apparently he did better than 7 of them. He was in the news a ton then..."
MandelaEffect,2c7go6,Lashes_,-3,Thu Jul 31 04:14:06 2014 UTC,Are you sure you're not remembering when they were trying to figure out where he was going to go or if he was going to stay in Cleveland? I think that's what you might be thinking of...it was a huge deal when he announced his move to South Beach.
MandelaEffect,2c7go6,Lashes_,-8,Thu Jul 31 04:14:51 2014 UTC,"umm the point of the mandela effect is that you can experience it one way and i can experience it another so if you have memories of knowing him and going to school near him at that time thats fine, but its not really relevant to me or other people who may have been from a different timeline. maybe you should look up the many worlds interpretation of quantum physics to try to get an idea of how these things are possible if they confuse you, but your subjective experience of knowing him is not relevant in my world where i know for fact that he was born well after 84"
MandelaEffect,2c7go6,Lashes_,1 point,Thu Jul 31 04:35:27 2014 UTC,"""ummm"" well a part of the explanation of the mandela effect says that some of it could just be due to a false memory or confusion about an event. So I was just suggesting that being born the same year as you, 1985, when we were past college age, that was the same exact time Lebron was being followed like crazy because everyone was wondering where he was going to go. You could have remembered that wrong and thought it was about where he was going to go to play on his first NBA team, when it was actually if he was staying in Cleveland or moving to a different team. So I just suggested it."
MandelaEffect,2c7go6,Lashes_,-9,Thu Jul 31 04:41:10 2014 UTC,"i dont understand why you would try to tell me what i do or do not remember. nor do i understand why if you don't believe something other than false memory has happened with this stuff you'd even bother to visit this board.  sooo, I'm sorry, but it was not a false memory. i know where i was and what i knew about LeBron James and your memory of it or your name dropping means absolutely nothing because thats the entire point.  i didnt post on this sub for someone to tell me ""no"". i could hear that from anybody in the world, literally. i came here to find some other person who might have had a similar experience. if you dont contribute in that regard, i just dont understand what the point of you contributing at all would be."

Someone claimed they remembered seeing it years before it happened, it must have been the Mandela Effect! And the response was No, you did see it, because it started as a segment on a different show. I didn't say I don't believe in the mandela effect. It's why i'm here on this board. There are things I remember too...for instance the thing about the color chartreuse or whatever being red. I believe in it. But I'm not so naive either that I think every single thing every person says means they are from another reality's timeline! Some people get things confused, myself included. I didn't even say you were wrong, damn. All I said is you could be remembering something else, because the thing you described literally is exactly what happened to Lebron James, same time period, same situation, except he was transferring teams, not transferring from high school to NBA. And I wasn't name dropping. I don't know the guy. I don't care what you think. I was saying that to simply point out the time period thing - I remember exactly when he was in high school, because I was there too, and the college years thing you described fits with his trip to Miami. I was suggesting another explanation. Sorry...you must never be wrong and never remember anything in your life other than it perfectly was. My bad for trying you."

So i'm not going around to ""do that to people randomly"" and tell them they are wrong. I was offering another explanation. Maybe something that jogged your memory and made you realize it was a mistake and not actually the mandela effect. That's happened to me before, as I'm sure a lot of other people. You remember something some way, and someone points something out, and then you're like ... oh wait...you're right. So i was offering that up AS AN OPTION. It still could be The Mandela Effect, though. I never said you were wrong. I repeat, I never said you were wrong. I never said you were wrong. <---Was that enough times for you to understand? Cuz I've said the same thing in this conversation 302 times now and you're just interpreting it however you want.

My first favorite, however, is garnet red, which seems a little odd in light of this confusion. Perhaps it's the contrast of a bright, yellowish green with a dark, purplish red? This could take us down the ""how do we know that the colors we see look the same to other people"" rabbit hole. You could be seeing the colors exactly inverted when compared to my perception (which would be horrifying to me, but which you would be so used to that if you saw things as I do, you would be horrified), and we'd never know."

I remember some television show my mother used to watch when I was a kid (either Golden Girls or Designing Women) talking about something being an ugly, ""Puce"" color. It was that ugly, grayish-green. Now it is a ""dark red or purple brown color, a brownish purple  or a dark reddish brown."" No, no, no, no effing way."
MandelaEffect,2anco9,L3xi_Luthor,14,Wed Jan 7 13:13:02 2015 UTC,"probably word association with chardonnay and the frenchiness of -euse ending, and with the knowledge that it is some type of liqueur.   You think it is the color of a red wine since your mind jumps to wine. you probably dont think the yellowish color of an actual chardonnay (or the bright green of actual chartreuse) because that wouldnt really be a significant color to name (if you are a male who happens to think of colors like a male). so you fill in the blank with dark red wine color.  Chances are, you have heard chartreuse and have seen red wines before you have ever come across the actual liqueur, since it is fairly rare to see; or at least much rarer than other forms of alcohol.   Actually, I think most of these Mandela effects are just people making logical leaps of based on the limited information you had as a inexperienced child, and then never really correcting it until you are a more matured individual. Berenstain? well they say Berenstein and you probably heard it long before you were able to read at a high competency level."

MandelaEffect,2630e4,domino43,0,Wed Jul 30 21:22:37 2014 UTC,That was Fred Phelps who died.
MandelaEffect,2630e4,Eddie_Savitz_Pizza,6,Sun Jun 15 00:23:16 2014 UTC,"Except that Fred Phelps JUST died, and I have only known about him for a few years, and he's not a Televangelist and I very clearly remember a Televangelist dying."
MandelaEffect,2630e4,MerlinBrando,15,Sun Jun 15 02:26:52 2014 UTC,"Colombine had to happen in 96 because I vividly remember talking about it in grade school with my grade school friends and running ""emergency"" drills where we would lock the classroom doors and hide in the coat closets. In '99 I would have been in high school. There were no coat closets in my high school classrooms and I didn't go to high school with even a single person I went to grade school with. WTF is going on!?"
MandelaEffect,2630e4,bandy0154,9,Wed Jun 18 08:23:51 2014 UTC,"In 99 I was in kindergarten or first grade. Not old enough to understand but old enough to have it explained to me. What set off my little Columbine Mandela Effect is a memory I had during show and tell.  One kid was given a little tote bag at the end of every week. They were allowed to fill it with five things that they loved (usually toys) the following Monday. I remember an incident when a kid brought his favorite Nerf pistol and the teacher flipped out at him and the rest of the class because we were saying things like ""cool"" and ""I wish my parents let me have one.""  I remember asking my parents why my teacher got so angry and they said, ""Three years ago some bad people went into a high school and killed some people."" Three years ago, they said, which in 99 would have been 96.   Seriously, wtf is up with this?"
MandelaEffect,2630e4,accountt1234isback5,15,Wed Jun 18 16:22:26 2014 UTC,But what about everyone hating on Marilyn Manson. The absolutely happened and he released his first album October 96
MandelaEffect,2630e4,minasituation,4,Sat Jun 21 01:55:53 2014 UTC,Very good point.

MandelaEffect,2630e4,Mr_Cohen,15,Sat Jun 21 07:42:26 2014 UTC,"Or they said weeks, and memories from when we're 5 years old aren't perfectly reliable."
MandelaEffect,2630e4,Toromak,2,Mon Sep 29 12:02:47 2014 UTC,I remember it happening in 1999. I was in 7th grade and I remember talking to one of the boys in my geography class about it because he had family in Colorado.
MandelaEffect,2630e4,metalclassicrock123,1 point,Sat Jul 19 15:44:16 2014 UTC,Ditto.  Graduated hs in 1998 and it happened the year after I graduated.
MandelaEffect,2630e4,KushTheKitten,8,Sat Oct 18 02:56:36 2014 UTC,"I check this sub every couple of days because I find all of this fascinating and because I too remember Mandela dying years ago. I remember learning about him in school during my freshman year and he had died years before then.  Anyway, I checked this sub today and saw this post and the other one that mentioned the Berenstein/Berenstain Bears thing and I swear to god that they weren't there before today. I read through this post at school the day you posted it and the Berenstein Bears weren't in it at all."
MandelaEffect,2630e4,CyberiusT,8,Sat May 24 01:26:18 2014 UTC,"Could be what I call a ""Reddit slip"". Sometimes weird bugs happen with reddit... for example, on a 2 day old post, me and some other redditors saw 3 year old replies talking about Oblivion (the game)."
MandelaEffect,2630e4,blxtzy,2,Fri Jun 6 00:32:44 2014 UTC,Makes sense. Every site has its bugs.
MandelaEffect,2630e4,Overxwatch,2,Fri Jun 6 14:17:41 2014 UTC,"Wow, that is strange. I really thing there is something going on, I just wish there was a way to get to the bottom of it all."
MandelaEffect,2630e4,Sleepytime_Milkshake,8,Thu May 29 22:52:28 2014 UTC,"Yeah, that's an oddly specific one that I remember too... Thank you! I wasn't alive back then, but I thought that was the reason why that photo was famous."
MandelaEffect,2630e4,momentumspace,3,Thu May 22 01:02:10 2014 UTC,I think the game you're thinking about might be called MediEvil.
MandelaEffect,2630e4,IAMTHEBATMAN123,6,Mon Jun 9 03:08:30 2014 UTC,Nope. MediEvil is nothing like the game I watched her play. Too cartoony. I would compare the game I saw to some recent Oculus Rift horror games that are being released as far as game play and graphics go.
MandelaEffect,2630e4,OmegaX123,3,Sun Jun 15 14:16:40 2014 UTC,"Try ""The 7th Guest"" it didn't have skeletons walking around per se but it was pretty detailed for the time and had skeletons in it, it was also kind of 3D maze-y, by how you had to walk through the house."
MandelaEffect,25coqr,vivi-galaxy,12,Mon May 12 11:47:27 2014 UTC,I can't believe it! WOW that is it!  THANK YOU!

MandelaEffect,25coqr,cherrywiggles,14,Wed Jun 11 10:51:23 2014 UTC,You really should post this to r/tipofmytongue
MandelaEffect,25coqr,summerofsin,4,Mon Sep 29 18:15:12 2014 UTC,"Yes, OP, please do, and let us know what you find!"
MandelaEffect,25coqr,bandy0154,7,Mon May 12 19:41:32 2014 UTC,Senioroni found it. I'm astonished!
MandelaEffect,25coqr,horrorxgirl,2,Wed May 28 22:50:22 2014 UTC,So it did exist...
MandelaEffect,25coqr,bollykat,6,Wed Jun 11 10:52:53 2014 UTC,"I don't know what that might be, but I have a similar experience regarding a TV show. Unfortunately it happened when I was very, very young and I can't remember a lot of details. When I was little, I watched Punky Brewster, so my child brain connected this show to that, but I can't even rely on the idea that it was an episode of Punky Brewster because that doesn't make any sense. Anyway, I remember that a girl (who I must have thought was Punky) was in some cave and maybe was lost with some other children. The part that sticks out in my memory is that at one point some of the children are searching for Punky-lookalike and some other kids and they find them....with their heads mounted on the cave wall, talking, but with scary looking eyes. I also remember them riding on rafts or boats in the cave water and sometimes I wonder if there were also dinosaurs in this show, or maybe I somehow combined a dinosaur show into this show. Anyway, I wonder if I dreamed it, because I never figured out what it was. But the scary talking head-mounted kids still creeps me the hell out when I remember it."
MandelaEffect,25coqr,horrorxgirl,5,Sat Jul 12 14:32:51 2014 UTC,That was totally real.
MandelaEffect,25coqr,bollykat,4,Mon May 19 07:13:25 2014 UTC,Oh. My. God. I have spent years thinking that I must have dreamed something so bizarre. Thank you for finding this!!

MandelaEffect,24zm37,Eddie_Savitz_Pizza,2,Wed Jun 18 08:06:13 2014 UTC,"?? I thought he died too! In fact, I remember watching Saving Private Ryan after I found out about his death to honor his helmet throwing ways!"
