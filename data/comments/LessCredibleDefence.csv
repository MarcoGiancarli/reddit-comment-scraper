LessCredibleDefence,3dznb0,z3dster,12,Mon Jul 20 20:45:41 2015 UTC,"Yet another article that ignores off bore sight missiles and their implications for dogfighting. If you get within visual range of one of these missiles, you're going to get shot down. You don't need to get behind someone anymore."
LessCredibleDefence,3dznb0,darthpizza,6,Mon Jul 20 21:38:21 2015 UTC,"They should google ""multirole"" as well."
LessCredibleDefence,3dznb0,cammissar,-6,Mon Jul 20 21:56:32 2015 UTC,"I think the problem with ""multirole"" is that air superiority is the most important role and it does that poorly."
LessCredibleDefence,3dznb0,chickendance638,11,Mon Jul 20 22:59:32 2015 UTC,"air superiority is the most important role    Not really. Delivering strike packages to ground targets is important; air superiority is just a means to achieve that end. The F-35 will be used alongside the F-15 and F-22 to support it in the case that stealth is insufficient.   it does that poorly.   Not really. Its EW is able to defeat the F-22's radar, so it should do quite well against other planes as well. Modern air combat concentrates on detecting and firing before the opponent, and the F-35 will fire the very same kinds of missiles that a dedicated air superiority fighter would, supported by excellent radar capabilities, along with networking that allows a missile bus to be a separate vehicle.  Nobody cares about dogfighting in 2015 except for people who are looking for a reason to oppose the F-35 program."
LessCredibleDefence,3dznb0,UmmahSultan,8,Tue Jul 21 02:08:17 2015 UTC,"The F-35 is actually by most accounts pretty great at air superiority. It isn't a good dogfighter. But even discounting BVR engagement (which I don't think you can legitimately do anymore, it isn't Vietnam), it still has access to proven off bore sight missiles. These aren't new tech, they've been around since the late 80's when the Russians came up with one. They have a very high pK and can launch at 180 degrees off bore. Future missiles with 270 or even 360  degree bore sight have at least been theorized and some are probably in development.   Either way, dogfighting is clearly not the most important element anymore, and it's the main knock on the F-35."
LessCredibleDefence,3dznb0,darthpizza,2,Tue Jul 21 02:38:38 2015 UTC,"Minor note, but due to the F-35's onboard sensors, it is actually capable of targeting and firing missiles (that are capable of LOAL) in 360 degrees. The tech has even been used on some legacy fighters, although due to their lack of sensor coverage, missiles fired in that manner have a significantly lower pK than those fired from the F-35."
LessCredibleDefence,3dznb0,Dragon029,6,Tue Jul 21 09:56:27 2015 UTC,"That's really interesting! I believe the AIM-9X uses the same seeker as the ASRAAM, so it's quite possible it has this capability already despite it only having a stated 90 degree off bore capability. I believe the Block II AIM-9X is supposed to have 360 and longer range. WVR targeting technology is really starting to get ridiculous."
LessCredibleDefence,3dznb0,darthpizza,6,Tue Jul 21 18:12:17 2015 UTC,"Yep; any missile with Lock On After Launch (the Block II AIM-9X is the first AIM-9 to have that capability) gives the F-35 360 degree targeting capabilities. The AIM-120 likewise also has LOAL, although it's a bit less maneuverable than the 9X."
LessCredibleDefence,3dznb0,Dragon029,4,Tue Jul 21 20:13:08 2015 UTC,"air superiority is the most important role   The tens of thousands of sorties flown by US military jets over the last couple decades would disagree.   and it does that poorly.   I believe it would have missiles away before Typhoon, PAK-FA, (insert high performance modern fighter here) even saw it. As soon as dodging an incoming missile becomes your priority you're at a huge disadvantage."
LessCredibleDefence,3dznb0,xiaoyaga,0,Tue Jul 21 02:44:45 2015 UTC,"The F-35's main role isn't air to air. It's strike and SEAD, with some CAS on the side."
LessCredibleDefence,3dznb0,ckfinite,3,Tue Jul 21 00:31:36 2015 UTC,There's the F-22 for total air superiority.
LessCredibleDefence,3dznb0,Longslide9000,2,Mon Jul 20 23:13:42 2015 UTC,"Not for the Navy or Marines. Additionally, hasn't the F22's order been cut dramatically, to the point that there may not be enough to establish air superiority?"
LessCredibleDefence,3dznb0,chickendance638,3,Tue Jul 21 00:46:35 2015 UTC,"There are 187, no new aircraft are in production due to a perceived lack of Air to Air threats."
LessCredibleDefence,3dznb0,Longslide9000,5,Tue Jul 21 00:47:16 2015 UTC,"More precisely, the production line has been shut down and placed in storage. Don't expect more F-22s, ever."
LessCredibleDefence,3dznb0,wutzu,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:24:00 2015 UTC,"There's 187 F-22s, and the F-15s are not slated to be retired until the 2030s, which is when the next air superiority fighter is supposed to be starting to show up (probably in design/testing), meaning we'll still be rocking an F-15/F-22 mix, followed by an F-22/next gen air fighter mix."

LessCredibleDefence,3dzrnh,psaldorn,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:01:16 2015 UTC,You can actually track them on a website such as planefinder. Just type 'www' into the search bar; if there are any flights airborne (typically earlyish morning and around 5-8pm) then they will be visible.
LessCredibleDefence,3dx3af,Jou_ma_se_Poes,4,Mon Jul 20 06:41:16 2015 UTC,"We are fully aware of the problems with corruption and cronyism with defense procurement in the west. Add secrecy and it becomes remarkably easy to hide payoffs, blackjack, hookers and blow. This becomes a much greater problem in modern Russia. Money has flooded in but not always sensibly and the secrecy has suddenly increased.  I find this to be one of the key parts of the text:   Bureaucracy for Bureaucracy  Putin also said that he ordered the Defense Ministry to create a new system to control the implementation of the state defense order by the end of the year.  Ruslan Pukhov, director of the Moscow-based Center for the Analysis of Strategies and Technologies, said the decision to create a new bureaucratic structure to monitor defense expenditures was a typical Russian reaction to the problem.  What is needed is transparency, he said. ""It is easy to misuse public funds under the auspice of secrecy if there is no public auditing. This is a big problem in Russia.""  The first reflex of any Russian administration is to create another bureaucratic structure that they think will solve the problem by monitoring other structures, he said.   In Russia, new monitoring organisations frequently ends up meaning more bribes to be paid. Instead they should be concentrating on where they have direct needs, producing something that is perhaps a little less innovative but is cheap and with a better quality level."
