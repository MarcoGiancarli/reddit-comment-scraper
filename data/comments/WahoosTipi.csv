WahoosTipi,3e2ojg,AnonymousBrownsFan,19,Tue Jul 21 14:23:11 2015 UTC,Am I the only one expecting them to do nothing?
WahoosTipi,3e2ojg,vousaimezmike,0,Tue Jul 21 16:47:19 2015 UTC,"We really don't need to do anything, aside from maybe get another bullpen arm. We don't have a glaring need on offense that we can realistically fix, our starters are fine, and we have the whole team locked up for 3-4 years yet. Take this as a learning season, we should still be competitive for the next several years."
WahoosTipi,3e2ojg,divineravnos,2,Tue Jul 21 17:03:43 2015 UTC,Don't have a glaring need on offense? Really? Our offense is a dumpster fire.
WahoosTipi,3e2ojg,Daughedm,2,Tue Jul 21 18:01:31 2015 UTC,"Seriously, outside of Kipnis, Murphy, Brantley and Carlos Carrasco (hitting 1000) we are terrible."
WahoosTipi,3e2ojg,divineravnos,3,Tue Jul 21 19:22:44 2015 UTC,"Did you finish reading the sentence? We don't have a glaring weakness THAT WE CAN REALISTICALLY FIX. Ditching Bourn would be our best bet, but there's nobody that would take his contract. Gomez would be a year rental, and we'd have to give up quite a bit for him, while we have a solid outfield core in the minors and most of our team locked up.  Give the kids time to learn, we have a decent sized window to compete."
WahoosTipi,3e2ojg,dnthsslethehoff,0,Tue Jul 21 20:09:42 2015 UTC,"I did. I chose to not list it though ;)  But in all seriousness, this team can compete this year with the pitching staff we have. Go out and get a bat or 2 to spark this thing up."
WahoosTipi,3e2ojg,TribeFan11,-1,Tue Jul 21 20:15:55 2015 UTC,So how much out of your pocket are you willing to pile onto the Indian's remaining payroll?

WahoosTipi,3e2ojg,TribeFan11,-2,Tue Jul 21 19:20:40 2015 UTC,Why can't we though? Milwaukee and Colorado both want young prospects. We have plenty of young prospects.
WahoosTipi,3e2ojg,dnthsslethehoff,3,Tue Jul 21 19:29:36 2015 UTC,"Low budget teams don't shell out for huge contracts at the expense of prospects under cheap, long term control."
WahoosTipi,3e2ojg,RRRockets,0,Tue Jul 21 19:32:10 2015 UTC,And we wonder why we are a sub .500 team every year.

WahoosTipi,3e2ojg,vousaimezmike,-3,Tue Jul 21 19:53:35 2015 UTC,Wait... money we don't have or money we chose not to use? BIG difference.
WahoosTipi,3e2ojg,Harpermania,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:08:40 2015 UTC,Team has terrible attendance. They don't have money.
WahoosTipi,3e2ojg,RRRockets,2,Tue Jul 21 20:17:11 2015 UTC,"What would make sense, to trade away our young prospects that would only add value to our locked up young core for some player for only a month or two? This wouldn't guarantee us that we would win anything, and if we did still end up below .500 and missing the playoffs after trading our prospects, there goes our young prospects that can replace bourn and murph/raburn when their contracts are up.  But, if you have a better suggestion that is REALISTIC I'm sure everyone would be willing to hear it.  Blowing huge cash for FA's and trades does not always work out well (examples this year: Boston Red Sox & Detroit Tigers). Also, it can be potential suicide for a small market team with as strong of a core as we have."

WahoosTipi,3e2ojg,divineravnos,7,Tue Jul 21 17:41:16 2015 UTC,"I'd like to hope we're buying. I think we're a key move or two away from really contending. If we could get a bat or two and get rid of one or both of Swish (as much as I love his personality around the clubhouse) or Bourn, that would be a huge success. All it would take is a spark at this point IMO to really turn the season around.   And I'd love to have either Gomez or Gonzalez."
WahoosTipi,3e2ojg,RRRockets,11,Tue Jul 21 15:16:47 2015 UTC,I find it hard to believe Swisher has a positive clubhouse impact at this point.  He's getting paid significantly more money than many of his teammates and does not contribute at all to any success.  I feel like we're just stuck with both him and Bourn at this point.
WahoosTipi,3e2ojg,meeseareawesome,2,Tue Jul 21 15:33:56 2015 UTC,"I personally think Swish is an absolute clown, can't stand the guy.  That was before he was with the Indians though. I'm fickle though if he came out of nowhere and started producing I wouldn't be shocked if my opinion changed"
WahoosTipi,3e2ojg,LarpMaster2000,2,Tue Jul 21 15:55:46 2015 UTC,"Not to say Carlos Gonzalez and/or Carlos Gomez wouldn't be good additions, it's just that neither seems to be the kind of guy the Tribe Brass would trade for.  They seem to want young controllable players on the rise if they're going to give up anything of value.  I would love Gomez, but It'd be tough to envision the Tribe giving up much for <1.5 years of him.  Maybe if the Brewers wanted Lonnie and Ramirez but I doubt that's anywhere near enough.  And I wouldn't touch Gonzalez with a 10 foot pole.  I don't trust hitters that have made their mark at Coors Field. He is under control through 2017 but he's scheduled to make $37MM over the next two years.  Nothing good could come out of that."
WahoosTipi,3e2ojg,meeseareawesome,4,Tue Jul 21 17:28:47 2015 UTC,check out CarGonz's home/road splits - away from Coors he's basically Drew Stubbs
WahoosTipi,3e2ojg,divineravnos,2,Tue Jul 21 21:27:24 2015 UTC,"The point about Coors Field is a relevant one, for sure. Hadn't really thought about that."
WahoosTipi,3e2ojg,LarpMaster2000,5,Tue Jul 21 18:29:50 2015 UTC,"The last thing that we want is Carlos Gonzalez. The dude is hurt all the time, and has looked like garbage most of this year...plus, he's owed 37 million over the next two seasons."

WahoosTipi,3e2ojg,dnthsslethehoff,3,Tue Jul 21 17:40:34 2015 UTC,Im expecting lonnie and jose to be traded because we have no need for them now that Lindor and Urshela are up in the big leagues.  After that I am really hoping we get a big bat or first basemen so Santana is probably on the block.  Its really weird we dont need much in pitching but maybe another setup guy.
WahoosTipi,3e2ojg,thedeejus,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:01:04 2015 UTC,The problem with Lonnie and Jose is their trade value is almost nothing. Lonnie has been given numerous shots at the MLB level and failed. Ramirez looked terrible this year although he arguably has more time.
WahoosTipi,3e2ojg,cleveland4813,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:06:45 2015 UTC,Ya but they're both very good at AAA so maybe they will take a chance.  We have nothing for them here anymore so we need to get rid of them.
WahoosTipi,3e2ojg,moogsynth87,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:10:59 2015 UTC,"Lonnie is only 26, he has a decent chance to turn it around yet, might just need another team to help him. Jose could be a utility infielder on a lot of teams. Kid isn't bad, just didn't look good for the first few months here."

WahoosTipi,3dmusl,LittleMissLokii,3,Fri Jul 17 20:58:16 2015 UTC,Exactly.   They do it to have a cool all star game because why try to win advantage when you don't even know if your team is gonna be there?  The league needs something like the presidents trophy.

The lower you are, the better the odds are that a player or bellboy will just flip him one.  Just a tip… The way the stadium was redesigned allows you to walk right up to the visitor's bullpen.  If he's decked out in Royals stuff, the odds of a player flipping him something seem decent."

I'm just tired of seeing ""get a right handed bat"" all over Twitter/Reddit/mailbag stories/etc. And if we keep performing at top 10 levels vs lefties then let teams throw all their lefties at us. I'm really not sure why it's such of a surprise seeing as Brantley, Kipnis, Santana, Moss, and Gomes have all shown throughout their careers that they can hit lefties. Add in switch hitting shortstops (Ramirez/Lindor) and righties Urshela, Aviles, and Raburn and you'd except this team to hit lefties as much, if not more, than they hit righties - and that's what we're seeing."

WahoosTipi,3dgzdk,VirtuaSaturn,4,Thu Jul 16 18:49:46 2015 UTC,Just rumors due to him not being liked at all in the clubhouse.

WahoosTipi,3dgzdk,fmessiahcon,-6,Thu Jul 16 15:45:09 2015 UTC,"I loved the Puig speculation.  Trade murph swish or bourn or all three of the scumbags for some bullpen help.  Then go after Puig, for Zimmer and or Lindor.   I'll probably get crucified for suggesting Lindor but Puig is dirt cheap through the 2018 season.  And for ""win now"" value he beats out Lindor no contest.   This is purely based on ""what if they make a run"" scenario.  I wouldn't trade for him unless we got within 2 games back of the Royals or something."
WahoosTipi,3dgzdk,Deucequad,6,Thu Jul 16 14:24:31 2015 UTC,"The additions of Lindor and Urshela  on defense have helped our team dramatically. Lindor is adding a ton of value in the ""win now"" sense."
WahoosTipi,3dgzdk,thedeejus,2,Thu Jul 16 15:44:41 2015 UTC,"In all fairness I only mentioned Lindor.  And also, yes, in comparison to Jose Ramirez, Lindor has helped dramatically.  Aside from that argument, thus far Lindor has performed at replacement level according to fWAR and WELL below average at the plate..  Im not saying that's who Lindor is going to be in the future but it just solidify's my point that for ""win now"" Puig absolutely has more value."

Gm's always buy into that ""veteran"" presence stuff especially when it comes to bench players.  I don't think GM's value middle relievers at all.  It's why they play for so many teams throughout a career. Swish could return one easily."

WahoosTipi,3dgzdk,Deucequad,3,Thu Jul 16 20:20:06 2015 UTC,"Well for one, you called Murphdog a scumbag, which I don't like haha. Murphy has been one of our better hitters on the team since he's come to Cleveland.  I definitely wouldn't mind getting rid of Bourn and Swish, though. Bourn has been nothing but a waste of money and a roster spot since he's signed here.   Also I don't like the idea of getting rid of Lindor (our top prospect) and Zimmer (another top prospect) for Puig, even if he is cheap. I don't know much about his contract, or contracts in general so I don't know how much we'd have to pay him. Plus, we've already got enough guys who can contribute in the OF and if we move Lindor, who plays SS? Jose? Walters? We need to let Lindor, Urshela, and Kip play together in the infield.  I wouldn't mind letting go of Santana or Moss... but for who? Not many guys to chose from on the market with a big bat."
WahoosTipi,3dgzdk,misterstevew,4,Thu Jul 16 20:52:35 2015 UTC,"Well, if you look at last year, Murph as an everyday player was pretty bland.  This year looks refreshing on the surface but he's also not playing a full load.  Notice his PA's are really light in comparison to Games Played.  Tito is limiting his PA's against lefties.  Just 16 PA's against LH pitching.   So this year his strengths are definitely being utilized and he's performing really well I'm not gonna dispute that but as an everyday guy I think those days are over.  Maybe sell before he's labeled as a one-dimensional tool on offense??  Puig would cost roughly 7.5 million per year annually over the next 4 seasons.  To put that into perspective a little.  Brett Gardner and Puig have similar production over the course of the last 3 seasons and Gardner is currently making about 12 mil a year.  Before you say thats cherry picked I encourage you to look for other examples such as this one, I promise there are tons out there.  I think Puig has MASSIVE value,  dollar to production, wise over the next 4 years more so than Lindor because, we KNOW what we can expect from Puig, we've seen him crush.  He too, is young and is only slated to get better.  We have no clue if Lindor is truly an everyday major leaguer.   As far as SS goes,  get through this year, maybe the Dodgers include Callaspo  in the fictional deal.  Sign Ian Desmond to a long term, backloaded deal in the offseason (cause they would just trade him after a few seasons anyways), and give yourself a real shot at 2016.  It's better than sitting around and waiting for 2 prospects to pan out.   I'm sick of waiting for the ""future"" with the Tribe.  Let's stop sucking off our prospects and go after something real.  Just my thoughts.  It's cool if you don't agree and thanks for your thoughts."
WahoosTipi,3dgzdk,VirtuaSaturn,3,Thu Jul 16 21:30:16 2015 UTC,Hey no problem. You made some really good points.
WahoosTipi,3dgzdk,AKlep,2,Thu Jul 16 22:00:49 2015 UTC,"Puig is a rental for sure, though. We'd be spending our time on him just to see him in Yankees pinstripes or gag red socks in 2 years. Kind or is our prospect who came up through our system and he's probably more likely to spend 10 years or more here."

WahoosTipi,3df8jy,Jobusan524943,2,Wed Jul 15 21:16:14 2015 UTC,"One day he's going to throw the wettest breaking ball ever seen, and then we'll all be sorry for doubting his true intentions for owning such a vast quantity of personal lubricant."
WahoosTipi,3df8jy,BoosherCacow,0,Thu Jul 16 01:19:33 2015 UTC,context?  i confused.
WahoosTipi,3df8jy,DMYTRIW,3,Thu Jul 16 03:06:55 2015 UTC,Brandon Moss hit his first homer as an Indian  into our bullpen. They held  it hostage for a bunch of apple products and a 55 gallon drum of lube.

WahoosTipi,3dc9as,cleveland4813,6,Wed Jul 15 03:36:37 2015 UTC,but we're better on the road...
WahoosTipi,3dc9as,kfdbjjgdxb,4,Wed Jul 15 05:33:26 2015 UTC,"We also choke any time there's a huge crowd at home. Sad, but true."
