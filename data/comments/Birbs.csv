Birbs,3dgj4q,kerovon,2,Thu Jul 16 02:25:38 2015 UTC,"It is late, and I'm barely familiar with automod, but that didn't stop me from puling together a really crappy and full of loopholes rule you could use. This is mostly derived from a very brief reading of this thread.  ---  type: submission  title (regex, full-text): [""(\\S+\\s+){5}\\S+"", ""(\\S+\\s+){4}\\S+"", ""(\\S+\\s+){3}\\S+"", ""(\\S+\\s+){2}\\S+"", ""(\\S+\\s+){1}\\S+""]  action: remove  action_reason: birb  ---   The glaring loophole in this is it will remove titles with 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 words (I think), but won't remove titles with more than that, largely because my knowledge of regex is pretty close to nonexistant.  It could probably be manually extended, and I'm sure there is some way to do it more easily.  I just have no clue what it is.  I did a very brief test in a private sub, and it looked like it worked, but I can't actually guarantee it won't remove all 1 word titles randomly.  But it might be a decent starting point."
Birbs,3dgj4q,GoAheadMakeMySplay,3,Thu Jul 16 04:52:12 2015 UTC,"I think Kiloueka is looking to remove any title with any whitespace in it.  You could then simply match to ""\s+"" if there's an option other than full-text.  Otherwise "".*\s+.*"" should match any title that contains any whitespace anywhere inside it.  I have lots of experience with regular expressions, but don't know shit about automod, so I could be totally wrong :)"
Birbs,3dgj4q,Viral_dump_lover,2,Thu Jul 16 18:44:15 2015 UTC,Would this remove variants of birb as well?  Such as Borb?  Birbirbirbirb?  Bwarb?   Birp? ¿qɹᴉq  That's my primary concern.
Birbs,3dgj4q,kerovon,2,Thu Jul 16 12:36:27 2015 UTC,"The way this (theoretically) works (I think), is it removes instances where you have a nonspace character (/S+)followed by a space character (/s+), followed by a nonspace character (/S+).  It will check for certain repetitions of that  (i.e. Nonspace space nonspace space nonspace) based on the number in the curly brackets.  It doesn't check for the content of the words.  You can chance the action_reason to whatever reason you want automod to give in your logs.  Something like ""action_reason: too many words"" would probably work well, though if you don't have a very complex automod setup, you may not even need it.  It is most useful in large subs with complex automod setups so we can figure out why automod removed something.   I would recommend throwing it up in a private sub and testing various titles using a non-mod account to see if automod triggers on them. I only gave it a very brief test.  I'm not sure how it would handle on something like  ¿qɹᴉq, because I don't know how it would interpret those characters."

Birbs,3cblsx,23Characters,4,Mon Jul 6 23:50:18 2015 UTC,Birds often hang around mowers to grab the insects that are stirred up in the process. Seems like that might be what's happening here.
Birbs,3cblsx,Jawbone54,11,Tue Jul 7 02:18:34 2015 UTC,"Kind of. I was coming up alongside the wall. The bird was picking bugs off it, and didn't move when I got closer. I stopped in front of it until it slowly walked away.  On my next pass it actually ran up in front of me and then proceeded to slowly strut ahead.  Silly birb."
Birbs,3cblsx,half-thaietitian,5,Tue Jul 7 05:34:22 2015 UTC,I think so. Crows/jackdaws are super smart and do odd things on purpose (such as waiting for bugs near a dangerous lawnmower). I doubt this dude was too stressed. :)
Birbs,3cblsx,whtruimplying,3,Tue Jul 7 06:23:50 2015 UTC,"Here's the thing. You said a ""jackdaw is a crow.""  Is it in the same family? Yes. No one's arguing that.  As someone who is a scientist who studies crows, I am telling you, specifically, in science, no one calls jackdaws crows. If you want to be ""specific"" like you said, then you shouldn't either. They're not the same thing. If you're saying ""crow family"" you're referring to the taxonomic grouping of Corvidae, which includes things from nutcrackers to blue jays to ravens.  So your reasoning for calling a jackdaw a crow is because random people ""call the black ones crows?"" Let's get grackles and blackbirds in there, then, too.  Also, calling someone a human or an ape? It's not one or the other, that's not how taxonomy works. They're both. A jackdaw is a jackdaw and a member of the crow family. But that's not what you said. You said a jackdaw is a crow, which is not true unless you're okay with calling all members of the crow family crows, which means you'd call blue jays, ravens, and other birds crows, too. Which you said you don't.  It's okay to just admit you're wrong, you know?"

Birbs,30tboz,autowikibot,4,Mon Mar 30 18:04:52 2015 UTC,"Eurasian wryneck:       The Eurasian wryneck (Jynx torquilla) is a species of wryneck in the woodpecker family. This species mainly breeds in temperate regions of Europe and Asia. Most populations are migratory, wintering in tropical Africa and in southern Asia from Iran to the Indian Subcontinent, but some are resident in northwestern Africa. It is a bird of open countryside, woodland and orchards.  Eurasian wrynecks measure about 16.5 cm (6.5 in) in length and have bills shorter and less dagger-like than those of other woodpeckers. Their upperparts are barred and mottled in shades of pale brown with rufous and blackish bars and wider black streaks. Their underparts are cream speckled and spotted with brown. Their chief prey is ants and other insects, which they find in decaying wood or on the ground. The eggs are white as is the case with many birds that nest in holes and a clutch of seven to ten eggs is laid during May and June.  These birds get their English name from their ability to turn their heads through almost 180 degrees. When disturbed at the nest, they use this snake-like head twisting and hissing as a threat display. This odd behaviour led to their use in witchcraft, hence to put a ""jinx"" on someone.
