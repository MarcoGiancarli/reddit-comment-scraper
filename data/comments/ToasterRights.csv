ToasterRights,3atnfa,Ianuim,3,Tue Jun 23 22:19:45 2015 UTC,"This post makes me sad because I am reminded that my mother had gotten a new toaster not too long ago. Not that I don't appreciate his work and his beautiful blue LED shining brightly as he does so, but when I asked her about it she said she threw our old toaster in the garage for a garage sale. Now as far as I know he very well may be still in her garage just rusting away and that sickens me. Next time I see her I will speak of her crimes against our very good friends."

ToasterRights,38hicu,GenuineTexan,3,Thu Jun 4 06:27:17 2015 UTC,Roberts should be a standard unit of measurement.
ToasterRights,38hicu,P4li_ndr0m3,3,Thu Jun 4 06:57:14 2015 UTC,"I love non-standard units. I have friends that measure time on a cupcake scale. ""I'll see you in three cupcakes."" Or ""It took you 15 cupcakes to get across town, what happened?"" Based on average consumption time for the total number of cupcakes. That in itself scales pretty oddly. Most people can savor two or three cupcakes in a row, but ask someone to eat 10 and it'll take way longer to prevent sickness."
ToasterRights,38cbcw,Classiest_Erection,8,Wed Jun 3 08:18:47 2015 UTC,"I can only hope that what we see in this picture is a defiant act of self-emoliation by one brave little toaster in the face of his oppressive captors and that a member of the press was there to document his final protest. It's just too sick otherwise. When I get home from work tonight, I am going to hug my toaster and try to forget I ever saw this."
