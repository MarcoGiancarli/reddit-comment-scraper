ketorage,3dx10v,NAMASTE_BITCHES,1 point,Mon Jul 20 08:34:20 2015 UTC,"I had a similar experience recently. I'm relocating to a new country because of my job. Since I'm in a group of employees that are all doing this at the same time, the local office offered to pre-stock our pantry with a collection of groceries before we get there. The list of food is as follows:    4 big bottles of drinking water 2 cartons of orange juice  1 carton pure milk  Bread Butter Strawberry jam Coffee Tea   The thing is, this is a pretty standard bunch of groceries for many people. I love keto, it's done me good, but sometimes I feel like a salmon swimming upstream..."

ketorage,3539z8,nomoneyrico,15,Wed May 6 19:14:10 2015 UTC,"Almost every one of the ""cons"" are ridiculous—certainly lacking in much credible and/or not-disproved evidence. Several of them really belong as cons on a ""high carb diet"" list.  For instance, I see the ""high protein diets lead to osteoporosis"" argument frequently. Indeed, early observations showed that high protein diets led to more calcium excretion in urine. However, when studied, it was found that, in spite of the increase calcium output, high-protein diets result in stronger bones (likely, the body is utilizing calcium more efficiently)."

ketorage,3539z8,Garbanzo_Beans,7,Wed May 6 20:30:52 2015 UTC,"Holy shit does this make my blood boil. Her ""64 page PDF"" literature review is a crock of shit. She completely took all of those studies out of context. The study that reported ""impaired cognition"" noted that the impairment only occurred within the first week of beginning a ketogenic diet (duh). The participants in her ""gastrointestinal disturbances"" studies had to maintain the ketogenic diet at home... and two of the participants were unable to remain in ketosis during the study (presumably because they were sneaking the carbs in at home). The study authors also noted that the gastrointestinal problems were quick to resolve. Another study that she cited for diarrhea and drowsiness noted that it primarily occurred in the first weeks of the diet and was minor and transient.  RAAAAGE"
ketorage,3539z8,Noxylox,7,Thu May 7 13:34:00 2015 UTC,"Let's talk about this. I read most of her blog post- just until I got to the academic journals. Two of them were ""pay-to-view"" and only displayed the abstract and general info I don't believe without seeing the data. But I did read the majority of the other two articles.   These experiments were conducted to test and treat epileptic children (and some adults). Most of these patients were already on seizure reducing drugs. Nowhere in the article did I see information about the side effects of those drugs, but after a quick look at webmd (scientific, I know :/) a lot of the AEDs cause fatigue, nausea, vomiting, liver failure, etc.   Who is to say that with the weight loss that Keto brings, the drugs didn't begin working more efficiently in these kids- and that the drugs are not to blame for the illnesses some of these patients came to experience.    The negatives of Keto that this blogger touched upon were barely mentioned in the articles.  Here is a quote taken from the fifth article she mentioned discussing the deaths that occurred during the experiment.   ""During the follow-up, 10 children died, among which 3 had withdrawn from the KD for more than 6 months before death, 2 died of status epilepticus, 2 died of pneumonia, 1 fell from height, and for the remaining 2 cases, parents were unwilling to disclose the cause of death.""  As we know- Keto does not cause seizures. It was seen the the article to help (if even slightly) to reduce seizures seen in epileptic patients. Keto does not cause falling from heights, either. Leaving pneumonia as our only suspected con.   Because of the lack of information regarding the two children that died of pneumonia (Were they taking AEDs? Were they from a partial control group? Were they the children being fed ""Keto milk""? What guidelines were they using to do Keto?) I don't think anyone can state that it was Keto that killed them.  There is not enough information from which to draw accurate conclusions.   TLDR:  Articles do not give clear answers that Keto is actually the cause of the cons we see in the blog.   Nice try, carbs!"

ketorage,3539z8,AllegraJohnson,5,Thu May 7 19:56:30 2015 UTC,"o_O What? They can't both be right... This isn't a pros and cons list. This is a opposite sides of a debate list - where one side is right and the other one is just wrong. Pneumonia? I can't even remember the last time I was actually sick. Oh yeah, before keto, when I had serious respiratory problems that - drum roll, please - went away after starting keto.   ಠ_ಠ End rant. (Yeah, now I see why this was posted in ketorage. LOL)"
ketorage,3539z8,CraigsWife,6,Wed May 6 22:22:55 2015 UTC,"Funny thing, that list of ""cons."" Most of my GI and reproductive problems get better on keto, not worse. Like, for instance, my menstrual irregularities. Or my semi-regular still-don't-know-what-caused-them stomach cramps that I had for months before starting keto.  So, you know, there's that.  Edit to add: oh, and I've had kidney stones exactly once in my life. It was before I even knew what a keto diet was."
