XWingTMG,3e4eci,Pea666,4,Tue Jul 21 21:36:38 2015 UTC,"I ran a Fel/Turr/Vader list last night, all of them at PS9. Even without Autothrusters (which I didn't have), Fel and Turr survived both games I played (Vader died almost immediately in one game, and then spent the other running away and never getting a good shot). But I LOVED the PS9 bid of the Interceptors. I also had Stealth Device on both Fel and Turr, and I think I had 1 Hull damage to Fel in the two games I played.  TL:DR; Three PS9 ships isn't excessive, and it's rather downright fun!"
XWingTMG,3e4eci,Berethrof,2,Tue Jul 21 21:43:22 2015 UTC,"Fel + Whisper is a pretty common list type, and it's very strong.   Personally, I think having a crew and a fire control system on whisper is really important, so I drop the stealth device and downgrade turr to something cheaper. You can always run a 24-25 point shuttle  instead."

Another option is drop the Hull upgrade on Turr and give PTL to Carnor, but that is because I like to have an initiative bid. You could also just PTL on Carnor if you dont care about having the bid."

It gives up an attack dice, some hull & shield to its named brethren but can be used as a support ship due to it's 2 crew slots. I have also seen ORS with double tacticians be a threat  with some skillful piloting. Chewbacca PS5: Arguably the most resilient of the YT pilots, Chewbacca can take face up damage cards he is dealt and turn them face down ignoring their critical effects. Chewy is often seen in a support role alongside Han or Dash in double YT lists or fully equipped acting as an anchor in lists containing a mini swarm. If Choose to ignore him early in the game, you may find it hard to get him off the table in time. Lando Calrissian PS7: Lando really shines in a list where he can hand out actions to surrounding ships in a support role. Most often seen equipped with Nien Numb and alongside Chewbacca with Push the Limit, this allows for Chewy to take up to 3 actions a turn making him very potent. Han Solo PS9: Regardless of who shot first Han has been a staple of the tournament scene since the ships release. Early lists saw Han maximize is offensive skills with a combination of Marksmanship & Gunner. He was often paired up with a couple of Rookie X-Wings as blockers to run point for him. Now you see Han builds setup for resiliency with the C-3PO & R2-D2 crew members allowing him to dodge a lot of damage and give himself a chance to regenerate a shield if a damage happens to slip through. The ""Fat Han"" lists as they are dubbed often sees a mini swarm of Z-95's in place of the X-Wings."

XWingTMG,3e2u0w,LiquidAether,2,Tue Jul 21 15:07:20 2015 UTC,"The original large turret ship, the YT-1300 was a ship that performed well but hadn't achieved ubiquity until the release of the Tantive IV expansion and the World's Championship run of Paul Heaver.  Not able to compete with dominant efficiency of swarms, the YT-1300 became popular as ship counts went down to accommodate the meta changing TIE-Phantom. With an Engine Upgrade the Falcon is able to elude its greatest threat: swarms.  Engine is a must on almost any large ship and the Falcon is no exception."
XWingTMG,3e2u0w,ernesto__-,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:13:05 2015 UTC,"I would say that Worlds 2014 represented the peak of the YT-1300 popularity.  The run up to that championship saw an explosion of Falcons to take on the threat of the Phantom and such challenges as Soontir Fel. Heavers list was designed in a way to counter this, by being both a counter to Phantoms, but also able to beat other popular Falcon builds. Shortly after Worlds 2014 saw the release of the Decimator and YT-2400, which reduced the popularity of the Falcon.  The following spring's change to the decloak rules along with the release of the Scum and Villainy ships further affected the popularity of it. I would say that throughout this years regionals the Falcon has seen a steady decline, though it is by no means gone yet."
XWingTMG,3e2u0w,ernesto__-,0,Tue Jul 21 16:12:35 2015 UTC,"Ah, the YT-1300, good ol millennium falcon. I have seen a lot of types of this ship, from extremely defensive, to kill or be killed if they dont die. Of course when people first think of the YT-1300 Paul Heavers famous build comes to mind.   Anyway, whether you play rebels or not, you have to love the YT-1300, its the Millennium Falcon for pete sake. However that doesn't mean that anybody likes to play against it. Anytime I see a Falcon across the board, I little annoyed groan emanates from my soul, cuz you know its gon take some focus firing to kill em. Furthermore  the pilots have some darn good abilities if you ask me.   Han- Able to reroll all his attack dice. (Paired with gunner and predator Han is bound to hit something)  Chewie- Aint taking crits from any fool (except vader and even that I'm not sure?) Paired with draw their fire Chewie can be a helful hand in the game.  Lando- Handed out actions on his green maneuvers. Personally I have only actually seen Lando once in play. Even that was when he was paired with chewie. So maybe Lando with a bunch of escorts could be good. paired with squad leader hes handing out actions like they're Jehovah witness flyers.   I like the Falcon, there are plenty of ways to use it competitively. Although the Falcon has won tournaments and dominated the meta scene for awhile, I do believe the day of Falcon dominance is over. With auto-thrusters and more powerful 360 firing options (See yt-2400) the falcon just isn't what it used to be. However, thats not to say its completely obsolete. A falcon won my regionals, and he even ran the same squad paul heaver did when he won worlds (Which by the way was a pretty tool move IMO). So hey."

XWingTMG,3e2upm,jebleez,4,Tue Jul 21 15:11:30 2015 UTC,"The more time has gone on, the less I like the M3-As.  They're pure glass cannons that depend heavily on those green dice, which is just a crapshoot.  Bottom line, my perspective as a scum player has been that they're too unreliable, especially for the amount of points you're sinking into each one."
XWingTMG,3e2upm,TheDoctorHam,2,Tue Jul 21 15:30:46 2015 UTC,"To be blunt, you're going to have a bad (but potentially fun) time. M3-A's are nicely manoeuvrable, but they are extremely fragile for their cost, especially a list comprised entirely of them.  They function better as a small utility really, one or two cheaper ones with a mangler can do plenty of damage for their cost. But like DoctorHam state, they rely far too heavily on the greens."
XWingTMG,3e2upm,FearOfBadgers,2,Tue Jul 21 15:55:57 2015 UTC,"Syckterceptors! YAY! I own four and they see little use, but I always enjoy running the little guys! A few tips from my experiences:  a) Cartel Spacer's get munched by anything with Predator - you might get a defensive re-roll of Serissu, but they get two re-rolls on more favourable dice. b) Serissu is better as a support for fewer ships - although if you deploy in a diamond around her the front one should see a lot of benefit. Then, when his stealth device is down, switch him out with another.  c) You've spent 12 points on upgrades for a 14 point ship, with 3HP. Does the HLC perform as well as a separate Zed would? That's for you to decide. d) Syckterceptors are very fragile. No more so than TIE F's, but the 2 points more makes people epxect a whole lot more of them. Just be careful about Range 1, or letting one be shot by several enemies at once.  I usually run Serissu + Stealth + Swarm Tactic, Tansarii PV + Title + HLC + Bodyguard + Stealth. Slightly more pricey but they can cover each other with respective skills/EPT and stay alive. I then use two bare Scyk's with a basic Starviper (maybe a Khiraxz now). The bare group go dog fight while the TPV snipes.   It doesn't always work, but I always enjoy it."

Three heavy laser cannons sounds nice in theory but you don't have the action economy to make them really deadly (ideally you want focus and target lock every turn) especially given that you probably need to use your focus defensively to mitigate your lack of hit points.  Really it boils down to the fact that Scyks just aren't very good and you have 4 of them..."
XWingTMG,3e2upm,Th3GingerHitman,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:31:52 2015 UTC,"I will be honest, the Syck is in a weird spot. It is fragile like a tie fighter but can hit like Dash. Honestly going all Syck's is kind of a dangerous move. Even with SD and Serissu backing them up, once they you lose 1 you will feel like you are fighting an uphill battle. Sure they can possibly put out a lot of damage with HLC's, but it doesn't make up for the fact that you are missing a little sturdier to form the backbone of your list."

XWingTMG,3e2upm,Shgrizz,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:00:42 2015 UTC,"I think the Scyk is to expensive. Either it should be 2pts cheaper or the upgrade should be 0pts. Or should have 1 more hull. Once you add a cannon, its just to pricey for such a fragile ship.  That said, Laetin(who deserves an EPT) with Stealth can be damn annoying to take down, especially when she faces a swarm.  But she still dies from a single Dash HLC shot more times than not."

XWingTMG,3e3cqi,Route66_LANparty,3,Tue Jul 21 17:18:11 2015 UTC,"This is a large investment, so I'll only speak to the fun I had playing the campaign with ships I already owned. Well, it was fun! I played as the Rebels and won each mission. Only the first mission was a blow-out. The others were nail-bitingly close. I will say I owed a lot of my success to having some exposure to Epic play already and the Corvette load-out being done for me. I was set to give up on the Corvette in casual epic, but in hindsight, my poor builds and action forgettyness were probably the culprit there. I was nervous going into the campaign that the Imperials would have the upper hand, given the mission reviews on Board Game Geek, but we still had fun and almost every mission was close. Like 1 HP close sometimes. The campaign also taught me the value of Tibana gas and my Engineering Team. Some things to keep in mind: Biggs doesn't work on huge ships and huge ships don't get free actions (Lando, Squad Leader, Cracken...). Ok, maybe I will speak to some of the purchases. No one will ever argue against getting a second core set. You really should have a damage deck per faction, plus having the extra templates and rulers makes things move a bit faster. And you'll be glad of the extra dice when the Corvette is attacking. Regarding all the TIE Fighters, I personally have 7 so I can Howl-swarm if I want, but 6 is kind of cool to have if you ever wanted to do an all-star squad (all named TIE pilots). I like the swarm tactics card, so 3 of my TIEs came from expansions.  I'm not sure if the Imps are allowed to deviate from the prescribed load-out in the campaign setup, but the Corvette has zero agility, and most of the Imperial win conditions are to destroy or cripple the Corvette. One of the easiest/fastest/cheapest ways to do that is with TIEs. The other expansions you mentioned are good to have in general for casual games. The TIE Advanced is about to get really fun when the Raider drops. One of the campaign missions ""requires"" Stele, but whatever. Aside from that, you're welcome to proxy cards or even ships if you want to try before you buy."

XWingTMG,3e3bfz,rsixidor,2,Tue Jul 21 17:13:15 2015 UTC,I played this not realizing that.  It was glorious.  Would have been moreso had I been flying against Interceptors instead of heavily shielded rebels.
XWingTMG,3e3bfz,Barzhac,2,Tue Jul 21 19:22:50 2015 UTC,Unavoidable crit is good no matter what.  FCS is still pretty helpful here to get the crit in there.  And there's always Etahn.

I had Chewie on board as a passenger, and Jan Ors as crew on Leebo.  I took a focus, Jan turned it into an evade, then used Acc. Cor. for two hits, and flipped one to a crit.  Alas, it doesn't work like that."

XWingTMG,3e3bfz,PCGamerPirate,2,Tue Jul 21 18:42:14 2015 UTC,VI Ten Numb with Mangler is a dedicated Soontir Fel counter for 36 points (only one point more than a Super Fel).  He can act as huge area denial because Soontir Fel cannot survive for long if he is in Ten's arc.
XWingTMG,3e3bfz,LiquidAether,2,Tue Jul 21 17:30:21 2015 UTC,"C-3PO does work, just not quite as you're thinking.  The secret is to always guess zero.  If you roll a dodge, you get one evade. C-3PO gives you nothing because you guessed right. If you roll an eyeball, C-3PO gives you an evade because you guessed wrong, and you can spend your focus for a second evade. If you roll a blank, C-3PO gives you an evade because you guessed wrong, then you can use Lone Wolf to reroll the blank, and maybe get a second evade, or an eyeball you can focus to an evade."

XWingTMG,3e3bfz,starslinger72,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:34:53 2015 UTC,"Yes this is a way you could get a bit more survival out of him, although you are pooring points into a  B-wing that even with all of those defensive upgrades can be brought down in a single turn for most damage based lists."
XWingTMG,3e3bfz,sacimino40,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:39:03 2015 UTC,"By no means do I think its a good idea on Ten. Its just too many points. I was just pointing out that thats something you could do because it seemed like the OP was trying to do something similar. I do however think its a great combo with Han or even Chewie. If you happen to equip him with Lando and Experimental Interface you could take the evade action, Lando potentially for 2 evade tokens, netting you 3, Call 0 with 3po on the evade roll get a blank to add an evade, and then re roll the blank for an evade for 5 evades on a Falcon! This would obviously be very rare, but hilarious none the less."
XWingTMG,3e3bfz,Rambr,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:44:57 2015 UTC,Why are to u saying lone wolf and c3po don't work together?? C3po happens before dice modification. Lone wolf modifies your dice. With a focus on def you are guaranteed at least one evade on the attack you use c3po and a really good chance of two evades.
XWingTMG,3e3bfz,Lepre_Khan,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:37:46 2015 UTC,"Well since 3cpo works before modification, you can't use lone wolf or focus to modify the die. You need to roll evade for 3cpo to work."
XWingTMG,3e3bfz,mxzf,1 point,Wed Jul 22 04:53:50 2015 UTC,"VI + Mangler are all the upgrades you want. Even then, except for against autothruster squints, you're likely overpaying for the chance to force some crits through.  Lone Wolf doesn't help someone with only one green defensive die. Save it for Luke or someone that can get more use out of it. 3P0 is ok, but a B-Wing still isn't that durable--even with one auto-evade."

XWingTMG,3e2g6q,Rejusu,2,Tue Jul 21 15:22:07 2015 UTC,"It's not massively different but a YT-2400 with Corran as backup is great fun. Take Dash Rendar with engine upgrades, push the limit, and (if you have Rebel Aces) Kyle Katarn. Having a large ship that can boost and barrel roll every turn and gets a focus out of it is sweet. Take the outrider title too and either a mangler or heavy laser cannon. It's a judgement call on that one, the HLC rolls four dice but renders you impotent against targets at range one and unable to ever crit while the Mangler is one less dice (though still three) but a higher chance of landing crits.  Personally I prefer the Mangler. Being unable to attack at range one and no crits is too much of a disadvantage to trade for an extra dice. Plus Dash benefits from doing green maneuvers every turn for the PtL/Kyle combo so you don't want to be forced into a position where you have to create distance with your target. He just wants to lazily drift around debris fields arc dodging and whittling down enemies with his turret. Plus it gives you a few extra points to play with, I plan on spending them on plasma rockets for Corran when the K-wing comes out."

Not sure if these ideas are any good, but maybe will give you some ideas of your own:  Biggs (28) + R2F2(3) Y(18) + ion turret (5) + R2(1) 2x [B(22) + Fire Control System (2)]  or drop the R2 in order to upgrade the R2F2 to R2D2.

XWingTMG,3e2vpz,Sammy_Seahorse,2,Tue Jul 21 15:18:58 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't necessarily recommend using zero upgrades.  But it's fairly easy to go minimal on them.  You will always want to start a swarm with Howlrunner.  She is the thing that will make running a swarm an offensive powerhouse.  Howlrunner + 6 academy pilots is 90 points.  So you've got 10 points to work with for upgrade cards or upgrades to pilot skill.  One of my favorites is to upgrade all the academy pilots to Obsidians with 6 of those points, then give Howl 4 points of defensive upgrades.  You might decide you like to have backstabber split off, and that's perfectly fine.  If you want to use Vader or Soontir Fel as a flanker, you'll need to drop down to 6 ships."

XWingTMG,3e012l,Lion_Paw_808,3,Mon Jul 20 22:45:14 2015 UTC,"I would estimate I probably lost about $200, maybe closer to $300 if you included sleeves, dice, binder, and some random packs I bought. I mostly bought singles that were for EDH as that's what my group played every weekend. I had a handful of cards go up a pretty significant amount from when I bought them, so that helped. Examples being the Swords, Thoughtseizes, Hero of Bladeholds and then a lot of the more expensive cards held value or increased a small amount like Avacyn Angel of Hope, Serra Ascendant, Scroll Rack etc.   I actually wasn't going to sell my collection but my game store offered 75% retail value in credit, and a lot of their valuations were more than I paid so I took the credit. I also bought several boardgames with it. I kept just enough power to have a couple weaker but fun MTG decks in case I ever get that itch.   The way I look at it is...I got hours and hours of fun out of it...it paid itself off in a few months...and now it's time to recycle that value into new games. Maybe I could have made more if I sold them privately or if I held on but I don't have time for that."

So my hat is truly off to Sable for putting his money where his mouth is and flying the heck out of this list.

I didn't fly against him but I was at the top table with him at the Austin and Dallas Regional. I've seen his games and have friends who flew against him. His games are all very fluid and his turns are all well thought out. Hearing his commentary play by play at the end of each game is interesting. The arrogance comes from him analysing his opponents moves at the end. Even though it is highly constructive criticism (especially coming from a skilled player) it can be approached a little easier lol.

XWingTMG,3dzc08,jonboyjon1990,3,Mon Jul 20 21:29:13 2015 UTC,Looks like the space slug sneezed all over your fighter...I don't think FreiTek's insurance policy covers that
XWingTMG,3dzc08,teh_longinator,2,Mon Jul 20 22:05:50 2015 UTC,Ouch.
XWingTMG,3dzc08,mxzf,2,Mon Jul 20 21:16:51 2015 UTC,Paint it black and say that is has a cloaking device!
XWingTMG,3dzc08,teh_longinator,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:04:50 2015 UTC,I don't get people's obsession with stripping the pre-paint before doing a repaint. I've done quite a few repaints now and have always under coated straight over the pre-paint. There's really no issue at all. Paint is really thin. It's not worth the hassle/risk
XWingTMG,3dzc08,mxzf,6,Mon Jul 20 21:31:58 2015 UTC,"I probably should have added that I'd already repainted the model once and wasn't happy with it. One paint job over the pre-paint is fine, more than one and then it's going to look bad.  Either way if I ever have to do it again I think I know what to do so I don't screw it up this time. But hopefully it won't come to that again."
XWingTMG,3e0mzl,starforge11,2,Tue Jul 21 01:20:01 2015 UTC,"I flew Xizor once with a similar build: Autothrusters, Virago, Accuracy Corrector, Veteran Instincts, Inertial Dampers.  The rest of the list were three Z-95s and Mux in the HWK with and Ion Cannon Turret and Greedo.  The star viper was fun to fly and my opponent had to make the difficult decision(many times) of who to shoot; Xizor in range 1 with a focus or some of his bodyguards at range 2.  When I fly it again I am going to drop the accuracy corrector though, I think I'd rather have advanced sensors and be able to Focus>Segnor's Loop or Barrel-roll out of the way of a collision then make my movement."

XWingTMG,3e0z9v,Berethrof,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:51:20 2015 UTC,Unless you take out kyle and add nien then you can't have two b wings. And I wanted Kyle. His focus is too important.

XWingTMG,3e1m0k,JustPlainnDave,3,Tue Jul 21 06:51:40 2015 UTC,"You should pitch this idea to them and ask for a job. :D  You could argue scale, but regular fighters with a 4x4 plate as a base should be good, and after that it's just a matter of building models and placing them on rods on top of that. Only necessary piece not readily available is fireing arcs on the bases, but that would be easily ammended by stickers, or magic marker for homebrews.  I almost feel tempted to run with this idea as a small hobby proof-of-concept project."

I don't think that X-Wing minis' rule structure lends itself very well to a game like that.  I just can't think of what it would really bring to the table.  Especially when LEGO games are generally targeted towards kids and older, with an easy and simple layout, while X-Wing is geared for an older crowd with more nuanced rules.    If you want a fighter battle computer game, I'd suggest picking up X-Wing vs TIE-Fighter, it's available for $10 on GOG."

XWingTMG,3dyzw6,PCGamerPirate,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:40:58 2015 UTC,"I might consider doing that. The Z-95 doesn't add that much with its stats, it's mainly filler and was supposed to be Whisper-bait. However, it did manage to get a hit or two during the tournament."
XWingTMG,3dyzw6,Pascal_Rascal,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:14:35 2015 UTC,That list has been known as Blue Thunder.  It is a very effective list in a jousting meta rivaled by Bloody Daggers (Adv Sensor Daggers and Red Squadrons)

Glad to hear it worked though and will totally consider using it in the next one!"
XWingTMG,3dyzw6,zipzipzazoom,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:14:43 2015 UTC,"Like any swarm, it does take some skill to fly to avoid traffic jams, thought it is not nearly as demanding as a Tie Swarm, since this build has no buffs or dice modifiers. Typically, I place the Xs and Bs together with a range ruler spacing for effective turns (Xs on the flanks are good for manueverability, but B's on the outside allow for barrel rolls). I place the Z-95 on its own so, it can flank enemy ships. This fleet is a great jouster, though the X's can break off and fly around when things begin to fall apart."
XWingTMG,3dyzw6,antigrapist,2,Mon Jul 20 20:18:05 2015 UTC,"I've ran the same list, but without nunb (went for the initiative bid instead) while Nunb is good the one 1 point astromech that comes with the Y-wing might serve you well. It makes all 1 and 2 maneuvers green."
XWingTMG,3e1244,Shabigity,3,Tue Jul 21 03:25:43 2015 UTC,"It doesn't say ""once per round"", so you can use it on all his attacks and all his defences, no matter how many there are in a round. In general, the only pilot abilities that are limited to once per round are ones that actually say so."
XWingTMG,3e1244,EdgeOfDreams,3,Tue Jul 21 03:34:53 2015 UTC,"The only restriction, of course, is you can only reroll a die once during a single attack or defend roll. So if you reroll all your attack die with a target lock, and 1 is still blank, you cannot reroll it with Boba's ability a second time."
XWingTMG,3e1244,3rd_Charmer,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:15:11 2015 UTC,"You can only reroll once. This is completely correct. But you can still modify dice after the reroll.

XWingTMG,3dzln6,quarrel,4,Tue Jul 21 02:44:29 2015 UTC,The FAQ has errata'ed boosting and barrel rolling to add that the template cannot cross obstacles either. (It can cross other ships still.)
XWingTMG,3dzln6,Raphah,3,Tue Jul 21 05:00:53 2015 UTC,"Very first page of the FAQ, actually the very first thing in the document:   “A ship cannot perform a barrel roll if this would cause its base to overlap another ship or obstacle token, or if the maneuver template overlaps obstacle token.”   It's really a little bit sad how practically useless the core rulebook is at this point, just because anybody who's fairly new is going to be in for so many surprises if they try to go to a tournament or anything like that."
XWingTMG,3dzln6,jebleez,-1,Tue Jul 21 05:13:59 2015 UTC,The movement template is an extension of your base when moving your ship though.

XWingTMG,3e0edg,randomyOCE,2,Tue Jul 21 00:09:53 2015 UTC,"I suspect the large ship limitation is because evade dice do not scale linearly, and larger ships have lower numbers of evade dice.  Going from 1 to 2 evades is an improvement. Going from 2 to 3 is a much larger improvement, and 3 to 4 is starting to stray into ""immune to 2 red dice"" territory. I mean, try to kill a tricked out Soontir Fel with a 3 dice turret and you'll see what I mean."
XWingTMG,3e0edg,krenzalore,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:36:09 2015 UTC,I thought so.  I've never fully seen/done the math on that scaling (though I dabbled when talking about Stealth Device) but it makes sense.
XWingTMG,3e0edg,EdgeOfDreams,2,Tue Jul 21 00:41:42 2015 UTC,"I think Countermeasures can win out over Shield Upgrade under the right circumstances. For example, an Outrider that gets caught facing a swarm of TIE Fighters or Z-95s, with no other targets for enemy to switch to, would likely get good value out of that +1 agility for a round.  The real problem with Countermeasures is that it's a one-and-done upgrade that costs almost as much as the best large-ship Modification in the game - Engine Upgrade."
XWingTMG,3e0edg,KennethSnow,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:45:58 2015 UTC,It can definitely help a Shuttle complete its first pass alive.

XWingTMG,3dz4cz,7hawk77,6,Mon Jul 20 18:31:01 2015 UTC,"Maybe I've got this wrong, but isn't the basic rock-paper-scissors matchup: jouster > turret > arc dodge > jouster (etc)  Under that logic, you'd want arc dodgers like Jake, Fel, maybe even Whisper.

XWingTMG,3dz4cz,X-factor103,3,Mon Jul 20 19:07:30 2015 UTC,"I think the best playstyle against SWARM is to open real slowly. Kiting from corner-to-center, so as to zip back to outer edge (mat).

XWingTMG,3dz4cz,rottinguy,2,Mon Jul 20 18:43:49 2015 UTC,"Try it. Use cheerios with predator, rebel captive, and engine upgrade, and a patrol leader with Vader on board. you should average about 1.5 ties destroyed per round.   Also remember to ac dodge with cheerios, don't waste those engine upgrade points."

XWingTMG,3dz4cz,VanderLegion,2,Mon Jul 20 18:57:02 2015 UTC,"Here are some anti-swarm tips:  1) Use assault missiles - they do a great job of whacking down a swarm.  This can be used with Blout for the rebels to gaurentee a good hit.  For empire, you can run bombers with assault missiles.  For scum, use N'dru (albeit he usually goes with clusters, but against a swarm the assault missile may be better)  2) You want decent agility (2+), mid to high PS pilots.  Stay away from fat slow, 1 (or less) agility ships.  The lack of defense on them means they will take 1-2 dmg from each enemy.  3) Some other good options:  Phantoms, Firespray, Interceptors, Aggressors, maybe X-Wings or Starvipers (both of those I tend to stay away from, but they may prove useful against a swarm).  4) As said by others, slow play. Force them to navigate obstacles.  Force them to turn to meet you.  Anytime the swarm has to maneuver it enters a chance to get disrupted.  If you can pick pilots off one or two at a time you will win.   If they can get 6+ pilots hitting the same pilot of yours, you are going to have a bad time."
XWingTMG,3dz4cz,mattman676,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:30:12 2015 UTC,Just wait until the K-Wing comes out and get ready to mine the crap out of them. The Conner Net is going to smoke Imperial Swarms.
XWingTMG,3dz4cz,sacimino40,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:19:11 2015 UTC,Not sure how conner net is going to hurt swarms that much.  It only hits 1 ship.  Conner net is going to be better against te 2 ship builds where it hurts the effectiveness of one of your really expensive ships for a copule turns.
XWingTMG,3dxsup,CFCBigD,3,Mon Jul 20 12:27:07 2015 UTC,"I am going to steal a version of this List :D  Horton, TLT, Marksmannship, R2D6 Blue Squad, AS Blue Squad, AS Prototype, Chardaan  The idea is that Marksmannship turns all Eyes in both shots, which are essentially Target locked into hits, not only one of the shots. TLTs can't crit anyways. Having the Turret frees up you Movement (no need to keep enemies in Arc). Having no way to reposition makes PS less valuable and sending Horton to the dieting camp frees up points for some more firepower in his escort.   I got two Bs with 3 points to play around (FCS, Tactician, Ion Cannon, Advanced Sensors). I got the A Wing to block (maybe even with AT when the Bs use FCS).  If this setup doesn't work, I'll swap the 6 points from the Bs to EU on Horton and AT on the A."
XWingTMG,3dxsup,Herbstrabe,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:48:35 2015 UTC,"If you're not using BTL, marksmanship is probably the better choice for a consistent two damage. The reason I don't like it with the BTL title is because you fire your primary first. If primary was last, it would bump up quite a bit because it's less likely to hit shields.   Makes me happy to see that people are willing to tweak it and see what they can get out of it! I definitely considered dropping the z's for an extra b, but I wanted the two z's for blocking. That and a fairly a-symmetrical list seemed like a blast. Being able to fly off in all directions and still be threatening was awesome!"
XWingTMG,3dxsup,mattman676,3,Mon Jul 20 14:59:49 2015 UTC,"I really think that BTL hurts Horton here. I love everything else about your build though, because it makes him a nightmare for most at PS10 with the engine upgrade - I've built him this way many times and am excited to try him out.   A Y wing that can arc dodge? Mmmmmyeah."
XWingTMG,3dxsup,mattman676,2,Mon Jul 20 14:59:11 2015 UTC,"BTL definitely isn't an auto include but I can confirm that it hits very very consistently. It makes your opponent second guess using a focus to dodge any of the shots from the Y. Using a focus to dodge 2 attack from the primary can feel like a waste but using it on an attack that can only do 1 damage to you feels silly too. The fact that he shoots first makes that decision even harder. You can certainly get away with it just being TLT without BTL. Definitely would be safer, just how I flew it this time."
XWingTMG,3dxsup,mattman676,3,Mon Jul 20 15:04:30 2015 UTC,"I'm not as concerned about the third shot, though. I would rather sacrifice one 2 dice attack for the ability to shoot 360 with Horton.   Boost with Horton serves two purposes, to line up a shot with the primary or to get out of arc with him. I would much rather have the flexibility to consistently get out of arc and still have a shot."
XWingTMG,3dxsup,mattman676,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:19:03 2015 UTC,"Those two attack dice made a difference in all the games I played in, but only for making the game go a little faster. To preserve Horton for as long as possible and still have him dealing out consistent damage, removing BTL is definitely the way to go.   All my testing was against the same opponent throwing around different lists at me, so while his lists were at least decent, he did make some less than ideal piloting choices. I'm not saying my build is THE build, that's just all I've done with it so far. I'm probably going to try it without BTL next time. If there is a marked difference, I'll certainly let everyone know.  For the record, the lists the other guy was running was: Vessery with HLC, Turr Phennir with VI, AU, and SD, and a doom shuttle with weapons engineer (whatever one lets you get two target locks) ST321. I thought he dumped too many points into the shuttle, but that's me.  Didn't lose a single ship.  Typical Soontir, and Decimator w/ PTL, Ysanne, Darth, Rebel Captive, and EU This is the game I lost my z95. Decimator went down in the second round.  Panic Attack build. I thought this was going to be the worst one, but it really wasn't bad. This is when I decided to try out marksmanship. So many shields, kind of meh. I was down to 1 hull on Horton, but everything else was pretty healthy. Keeping at range 3 was the key for sure.  Kavil w/ VI, Autoblaster, Unhinged,  EU Palob w/ Opportunist, K4, Blaster Turret, Moldy Crow and Inertial Dampeners. M3A Cartel w/ Cannon title, and Mangler Binayre Pilot (z95)  I thought Palob was going to be horribly disruptive but I was able to bait kavil into taking himself out of the game for about two turns which gave me enough time to put Palob down first. Didn't lose a ship.   So that's my experience, in a nutshell"
XWingTMG,3dxsup,mattman676,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:48:47 2015 UTC,"I get it, I do. But I'm thinking that if you want to preserve Horton, you want to keep him at range 3 and only use the EU when you have to to arc dodge. Having the turret locked to the forward firing arc is a nightmare, IMO, because it makes Horton more predictable. The Y has a decent selections of whites to ""Get the F out of there"" and still have a shot."

Y's aren't my favorite ship in universe at all; I always thought they were kind of dumpy, but they've gotten some really fun options the last wave and from this upcoming one, I find myself including them in ALL of my rebel lists in some way. It has probably gotten the best buffs outside of autothrusters on squints since the game started.  I'm sure someone who is much smarter at the game will find a better way to optimize Horton than I, but this is just the first one that I felt like I had a ""eureka!"" moment when I put it together. Always open to suggestions. Like I said, I will be trying it without BTL next time!   Coming from the street fighter community, it's nice feeling like I can just put strats and builds out there without feeling like I'm handicapping myself down the line by letting my potential opponents know my tricks and such. The game is built in a way that superior flying will typically beat a statistically better list.   I do wish people got a little more emotionally involved in tourneys though. Friendly banter during a match is so much more fun than the : | types I seem to run into all the time. I do enjoy the following inner rage struggles from them though."

Honestly I think this is the best Soontir/Whisper killer in the game currently. There is a bunch you can pair him with like 2 Y's or 4 Z's, hell even a fully loaded Kath or IG fits. Basically you move after Soontir so you can pretty much always have him in range 1 or 2. Range 2 double stresses him and Range 1 gets auto hits. I flew it at regional Sacramento and it melted Soontir Fel in two turns. Almost had him in one if I got 3 hits with the autoblaster. This Boba murders Fel/Whisper"

XWingTMG,3dwsts,howieloader,4,Mon Jul 20 05:13:44 2015 UTC,Kind of related question here.  I am in the process of building the Xwing and Netrunner communities locally (so regionals and nationals are not even in the ball park) so this is more for my own knowledge.  Who and how are these kits provided? Does the Tournament Organiser have to provide them?  Who decides who runs the National Tournament if its not FFG?  Just getting info here guys :)
XWingTMG,3dwsts,Slothmano,3,Mon Jul 20 07:53:18 2015 UTC,"I believe tournament kits are provided through games distributers. Talk to your FLGS and see if they can obtain them through theirs. They aren't free which is why tournaments typically charge an entry fee. For more information you might want to try and get in touch with FFGs organised play team, you can likely find contact information on their website. At the very least you'll be able to contact someone who can point you in the right direction."
XWingTMG,3dwsts,Rejusu,-9,Mon Jul 20 12:28:59 2015 UTC,Answer is here.
XWingTMG,3dwsts,Cintesis,6,Mon Jul 20 10:04:26 2015 UTC,"(1) There's nothing on Google about how to get an event recognised by FFG as a National. (2) As you are linking that site, you would likely be surprised how different Google can be if you try it from a different country."
XWingTMG,3dwsts,krenzalore,2,Mon Jul 20 10:46:51 2015 UTC,Contact ffg. They will address the situation-they follow up very well with most all concerns when it comes to organized play
XWingTMG,3dwsts,skiduck,3,Mon Jul 20 14:26:05 2015 UTC,"I'd ask yourself what you're looking to achieve. I mean, possible outcomes from this might be that FFG blacklists him from tournament support? If so, does that just mean no FFG support at all for the tournament next year?   Alternatively are you looking to have him replaced as Tournament Organiser? If that's what you want, reporting him to FFG might not do much if they're not the people running it. You'd need to talk to the people in whatever organisation actually runs this tournament.  Apart from these two outcomes, I'm not really sure what you're looking to achieve here. I'd be interested to hear your thoughts on what the desired outcome is from this point forward."
XWingTMG,3dwsts,FishBroom,6,Mon Jul 20 05:30:32 2015 UTC,"Trying to replace the TO is something that I am considering. There are several other issues and what I consider to be poor practices (which I won't go into here as they are fairly specific,) however I guess I just wanted to voice my frustration to what I consider to be the best X-wing community around and see what they would suggest."
XWingTMG,3dwsts,FishBroom,2,Mon Jul 20 05:38:44 2015 UTC,"If you're willing to be TO yourself and are going to do a better job, then I say go for it. Running a decent tournament (and not making off with the prize support) is a service to the community.  So which organisation would you have to talk to? I mean, where does the tournament take place? Is it run as part of a convention? A local game store? A stand alone event?"
XWingTMG,3dwsts,FishBroom,3,Mon Jul 20 05:57:00 2015 UTC,"This is admittedly selfish of me but being the Organizer of a tournament is something I could see myself doing (and I've worked in that sort of role professionally before, so I have experience there,) however being the judge on the day and not being able to play? Not sure I'm at the point of my X-wing play where I'm willing to give up the chance to be the very best.   Sure its selfish, but it's where I'm at.   If I could do the organizing of the event (finding venue, contacting stores for sponsorship that sort of thing,) then sure, but having to judge on the day? I would prefer not.   However you are right, I shouldn't be looking at doing anything until I myself have an actual plan on how to replace him if at all possible.   I also wonder if he would willingly step down if this information came to light? Would the community take issue with it the way I have? Hmm. Thoughts to consider."
XWingTMG,3dwsts,krenzalore,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:02:51 2015 UTC,"Understand completely.  Even if you ask him to step down and he agrees. You still need a backup plan if you're not willing to run it yourself. Even a TO that steals some of the prize support is better than no tournament at all.  Sure it's likely one of the regional TOs would just step up, but It's always better to know where you plan to land before you jump in."
XWingTMG,3dwsts,Vuuud,2,Mon Jul 20 06:06:33 2015 UTC,If it's a national it's because FFG recognised it as such. So even if they are not running it they can choose to blacklist a TO.

The worst thing you can do is destroy the place you play at without knowing 100% that it was intentional theft. Id suggest looking into whether or not the 4th player forfeited the prize and would definitely have a conversation with the owner. But, if it's intentional then it's likely they can have their license to buy from Fantasy Thought Games removed (?).

You're goal with a full ion squad is not to kill by damage but to force your opponent's off the board or at least out of combat for a turn while you focus on something else.  You've also got two different sources of stress for Dace. I really dislike that part.  I think I'd build it a little differently.  https://geordanr.github.io/xwing/?f=Scum%20and%20Villainy&d=v3!s!123:0,-1,-1,118:-1:-1:;120:27,0,-1,-1,118:-1:3:;124:57,0,38,-1:3:3:  Engine upgrade on the PS2 is hard to use properly. You don't have the title so you're not as bad off as you would be with it but you still have some trouble in some situations.  I changed wingman on Kavil to VI. This gives you a high PS Engine Upgrade ships to respond to some big threats like PTL Corran, Dash, etc.  On Dace, I changed PTL to Predator and Sab to RecSpec. Rerolls are good, stocking up focus tokens is good (especially for turns where you're stressed and you really don't want to perform a green maneuver- it will happen.  Overall, though, I don't think this squad will perform well in the current meta. Big ships are such a nuisance that only three sources of ion just don't seem like enough to me.  Maybe in upcoming waves where we might see more small ships being played consistently."
XWingTMG,3dy2mn,rsixidor,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:12:21 2015 UTC,"I see what you're saying. Is there any alternative use for the 3 points you put into predator that you can think of though? Reason I ask is because I don't have the TIE Defender and don't fancy buying the pack for just the one card.  I don't think id run this in tournies at the moment as as you said, the meta is very much leaning towards large ships at the moment and this wouldn't fare too well against brobots or the like... though this could work well against some of my friend's favourite builds, which is why I'm interested :-)"
XWingTMG,3dy2mn,rsixidor,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:29:20 2015 UTC,"Lone Wolf is my other stand by for needing attack dice rerolls but would require some very difficult flying to keep it on and have your extra ion damage. Without Predator, I'd probably go for VI."
XWingTMG,3dy2mn,Durog25,2,Mon Jul 20 15:47:25 2015 UTC,"Some edits I would make.  Give the Thug BTL-A4. You have two better turrets already giving this guy some extra punch will help keep the damage up.  Swap out PTL on Dace with Lone wolf and run him at range from the Y wings. He only needs to be at range 1-3 of the enemy for his ability to trigger. I found PTL on Dace isn't as effective because he doesn't shake stress very well. Add a K4 instead of Saboteur, I've yet to see Saboteur ever work.  Edit: grammar and spelling."
XWingTMG,3dy2mn,fantasticflembo128,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:37:34 2015 UTC,I think I agree with everything you've said here actually... this build makes a lot more sense. I'll give this a try.

XWingTMG,3dy2mn,cetiken,2,Mon Jul 20 16:20:21 2015 UTC,"I don't want to be harsh, but I have a tough time liking this build.  1) As someone mentioned before, Dace needs to drop PTL as he's going to use stress every turn to apply the extra damage.  2) Saboteur doesn't seem to have a place. 3) Kavil with Wingman locks Kavil to Range 1 of Dace (I assume that's why you have him here). Kavil and Dace are the backbone of this and now I, as the enemy, know exactly where those two ships will be, as Dace only has 4 green maneuvers.  I think the better Dace squad drops Kavil completely and pairs him with 3 Y's with Ion Cannon, each with unhinged (https://geordanr.github.io/xwing/?f=Scum%20and%20Villainy&d=v3!s!123:0,-1,-1,118:-1:-1:;124:-1,0,-1,-1:-1:-1:;123:0,-1,-1,118:-1:-1:;123:0,-1,-1,118:-1:-1:). You could even BTL the Y's for the extra damage, but as u/rsixdor said, you're looking to control and not kill, so having 4 360 turrets seems more advantageous. This list is pretty hard to pin down as the Y has a monster dial with all the green.  I like Ion's too, so much so that I tried an auto-ion Ten for a while. The effect of the ion is just not good enough, though, if you don't have enough of them."

XWingTMG,3dw0sd,Tvayumat,5,Mon Jul 20 12:56:20 2015 UTC,"I was in this boat recently.  I'd been mostly playing tabletop games at my house or my friends' places depending on who wanted to play, but started branching out into a few FLGS for more matches.  It's pretty much as simple as showing up, having a list ready, and saying ""Hey guys, anybody up for a 100 pt skirmish?""  X wing players tend to be pretty friendly, and most folk like to ""fly casual"".  I've gotten to know a whole crew of local players simply by playing pickup games with them.  EDIT: Forgot to mention some basic guidelines.  -When playing with people you don't know, it's always good to state what you're doing move/action/ability wise out loud and clearly. Let them know what ship is doing what and when.  -Keeping your own tokens, templates, dials etc organized will make you a faster player overall, and people like quick, efficient gameplay for the most part.  -Don't be afraid to ask ""Oh hey, I just did X but I meant to do Y, would you mind if I swapped it?"". Players are very understanding in casual play, and I like to give as well as take. We all make mistakes.  -Be sure to make ""FWOOOOOOOM"" and ""PEW PEW PEW!"" noises as you play. This is mandatory."

Announcing your moves is common courtesy, and I like it when people do it, even if I'm just casually playing with my brother.  Keeping your things organized should be required. I take out all my stuff before the game, putting all the required tokens on each pilot  card so I can always grab things easily. Likewise, I keep my manuever templates organized by shape and speed. Even in casual play I get easily annoyed by people looking for that one matching Target Lock token or that 2-turn they can't seem to find."

XWingTMG,3dw0sd,jhorphear,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:12:13 2015 UTC,"I would maybe ask how seriously they are looking at playing if it's your first time with them. With my friends and flatmates often we're practicing for an upcoming tournament or something so if we make an awful move we'll let each other take it back and do what would have been better. Another example is barrel roll/boosts - if we're learning we let each other check what would come out best.    But that being said when I'm playing with new people off the bat I try and conduct myself to a similar standard that I would in a tournament (announcing the moves, not 'testing' boosts or barrell rolls.')

XWingTMG,3dy9gn,Chicken_Bender,14,Mon Jul 20 14:52:14 2015 UTC,"Four reasons why I don't like this idea:   We already have dial options with colors to represent how well a ship can accelerate or decelerate. The EU books talk about 'inertial dampeners' that fix the g-force issue for pilots anyway. It's a lot of extra information to track during a game. It limits choices in a way that may prevent cool maneuver choices while not adding anything new for players to decide or take advantage of. Overall, it would make the game more predictable."
XWingTMG,3dy9gn,EdgeOfDreams,11,Mon Jul 20 15:03:05 2015 UTC,"Well, fighters have inertial dampeners which prevent pilots from having any issue with pulling Gs from acceleration.  So, that's not really an issue in the Star Wars universe.  Personally, I view the fact that you keep going forwards from your current position at a minimum of 1 speed your inertia/acceleration capabilities.  You're looking for an acceleration window for the fighter, 1-5 is the acceleration window.  That said, go ahead and play a few games with your system, tell us how it goes.  For ideas like this, you're better off posting your results than posting ideas and looking for someone else to playtest them."

XWingTMG,3dy9gn,Tvayumat,2,Mon Jul 20 16:00:10 2015 UTC,"A TIE Bomber in this system that starts at 2 must travel an equivalent 9 distance to K-Turn and then cannot de-stress for two more turns. On the other hand, the IG-88 is mostly unaffected.   This exacerbates, rather than represents, the differences in movement ability between ships that is already represented by the Stress system on the dials. Without going into detail, it is worth noting modern day craft can perform pretty similar maneuvers and that craft in the far future (/past?) of a world where space travel is second nature to most will probably have received design modifications to address the majority of these concerns."
XWingTMG,3dy9gn,Nomnomnicon,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:36:58 2015 UTC,Did some quick number crunching.  Looks like an xwings top speed is ~100 m/s.  If this is the case even going from a dead stop to that speed in 1 second is only slightly over 10g's.  A trained pilot can withstand a maintained 9g's but the accelation is not sustained in this case since acceleration stops at this point or changes to deceleration.  Also consider that the X-wings can't come to a complete stop but can only slow to ~25 m/s causing the maximum gforce from a straight maneuver to be ~7.5 g's for an xwing.  Using these numbers we can see that a tie fighter would have a maximum gforce of ~12.5 g's from a dead stop to full speed (0-5) which while not sustainable can be survived and the pilot could remain conscious if well trained.  This obviously doesn't take into effect rotational acceration or k turns but it also assumes each maneuver only takes 1 second.  I would double check my numbers and give the rest of them a shot of I had a pencil/paper and some time.
XWingTMG,3dy9gn,Jaemad,3,Mon Jul 20 18:15:29 2015 UTC,Ships in star wars have Inertial Dampeners so you don't feel the G-forces.  Gs would have no effect on the pilot for whether you can do maneuvers.
XWingTMG,3dy9gn,VanderLegion,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:45:04 2015 UTC,"I'm aware of the inertial dampeners on xwings at least.  I haven't seen, however, any figures on how much it dampens (it is a dampened after all not a negative) not which ships have them (like I said I know xwings do but don't know about other ships).  In the very least I established an upper limit for if a ship: 1. doesn't have a dampener 2. The dampener takes damage 3. The dampener doesnt actually dampen that much."
XWingTMG,3dy9gn,Jaemad,2,Mon Jul 20 19:08:47 2015 UTC,"If you go by the (now no longer canon) books, it removes 100% of the effects of g-forces by default.  Some pilots dial it down to .95 so they can feel a small amount (5%, so 20G would feel like 1) to have a better feel of what they're doing.  And all ships in star wars use inertial dampeners as far as I recall.  Edit: http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Inertial_compensator"

I'd do this:  Rexler Brath + PTL + HLC + mk2 Ion engine  Colonel Vessery + VI + HLC + mk2 Ion engine  This leaves 7 points for your choice of missles. Ion and Assault seem like good fits.  With Rex and Ves, Ves NEEDS to shoot first so that both of them can make use of Rex's Target Lock. Rex has PTL so that he can be taking Focus AND Target Lock each round.  Ves has VI so he can shoot before Rex, allowing Rex to still go full balls deep mode.  Another option might be to drop the missiles and cannons entierly to squeeze another ship in, but I respect the fuck out of a man who can fly a pure Defender list well."

I'd also suggest something like a 50-60 point game, two or three basic generic ships per side (x wings and ties), and one special one of some sort (b wing, bomber, etc), with maybe one named pilot or maybe one upgrade card or some ordnance just to spice things up."

XWingTMG,3dusxl,Herbstrabe,2,Sun Jul 19 20:47:00 2015 UTC,"Its a day for 'wider learning' and everyone in the school is involved (1300 kids). So the idea is to expose kids to things they may not have done/seen before. Last year I took a group rock climbing. There are other things available like abstract photography, mountain biking, lots of craft activities, cooking on a budget, photoshop, free running, etc. The kids pick what they want to do and either do 3 x 75 minute sessions or 1 all day session. It usually goes down really well with the kids and I think it helps them find new interests."

Is the class part of the curriculum (they already have time set aside and it's been planned) or is it because multiple teachers finished early and now they need to fill the time.  If the former, that's cool and I'm mildly jealous. If the latter, how did they get the school board to approve? I'm asking because where I went to school, this sort of thing wasn't exactly common. If it were, students might be more interested.   This situation has all kinds of implications and I'm trying to get a better picture of a different educational culture."

You got to ask yourself if those As bring anything to the table Corran doesn't - Corran has more firepower, since he has 3 attack and can double tap, Corran arguably has more survivability because of R2-D2, and Corran terrifies arc dodgers and Phantoms because of his 10 PS.   Your A-Wings can arguably take some crits for Dash, but that's doubtful, because they need to be at range 1 to do it - But Dash wants to stay as far away as possible, while the As want to stay at range 1 to get 3 attack dice."

XWingTMG,3dv3go,rottinguy,7,Sun Jul 19 19:41:59 2015 UTC,"Say you wanted to do a K-turn to get at the pesky ship that is about to be on your tail, but you also wanted to have a focus token available when you did it, because it's soontir fel.   You can't K turn and focus in the same turn without advanced sensors.   Or perhaps you need to barrel roll in order to avoid an asteroid that is right in front of you. Barrel roll before you maneuver to accomplish this.   Advanced sensors is possibly one of the most useful cards out there in terms of utility."
XWingTMG,3dv3go,alc6379,4,Sun Jul 19 19:47:03 2015 UTC,"OHHHH THAT, that is helpful considering that the B-wing is sooo sluggish."

XWingTMG,3dv3go,nickmenor,6,Mon Jul 20 03:31:43 2015 UTC,"If you take a red maneuver such as the K-turn, normally you lose out on your action due to receiving a stress token immediately upon completing the move. Since the action is usually after the move, AS still lets you do both."

XWingTMG,3dv3go,Aanar,4,Sun Jul 19 22:05:57 2015 UTC,"Oh man oh man do I love advanced sensors. This is an extremely useful sensor upgrade for ships with either barrel roll actions, or horrible dials. The ability to do an action before you move can make or break any given round of shooting.   For example: Ten numb is facing IG88-b but at an angle. Ig88 decided to use inertial dampeners (which lets him sit still instead of moving). Now ol ten went 2 forward, and any other ship would either bump or be a range one shot from both parties. HOWEVER, ten decides to barrel roll I the left FIRST, then do the two forward. When the dust settles ten had a range one shot onto ig88's side while IG has no shot, and has wasted inertial dampeners. (True story btw)  Also you can focus or target lock before you do any one of the b wings red maneuver."
XWingTMG,3dv3go,Copper_Lontra,2,Sun Jul 19 19:54:38 2015 UTC,Are your required to take your action(s) before moving if you have this card equipped or is it optional?
XWingTMG,3dv3go,darth_static,6,Sun Jul 19 22:16:53 2015 UTC,Totally optional
XWingTMG,3dv3go,Jimbobjeff,2,Sun Jul 19 22:29:37 2015 UTC,"Couple of scenarios I ran into when running 2x AS Blues in a 50pt skirmish:  Someone on your tail? AS for a focus token, K-turn. You're facing them with a Focus and stress, which you can clear next round.  Know where an enemy is going to be next round, but one of your ships will lose arc on it if it moves? AS for focus, choose a maneuver that bumps. You don't move, but you've got a focus.  Got a ship directly in front of you, K-turn would give you a perfect shot if you could complete, but you'd bump? Barrel roll, then K-turn. Bingo, you've got them in arc without bumping.  Enemy ioned, but you want to block them? AS a token, then bump them.  Know you're going to bump no matter where you move? AS a token beforehand.  AS is an amazing card, and this is just the scenarios for B-wings. Put it on an E-wing or Aggressor, and it's damn-near perfect, as you can synergise PtL with AS for some really ridiculous maneuvers (E-wing with PtL, AS, EU and R2-D2: AS barrel roll, PtL boost, take a stress, perform a green maneuver, remove stress, gain shield, end up halfway across the board or with the enemy at range 1 with no shot on you)"
XWingTMG,3dv3go,Norix596,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:06:18 2015 UTC,The main uses are to take an action (E.g. focus/target lock) before a red move or to barrel roll before revealing your dial to avoid crashing into something/to get a more advantageous firing position.
XWingTMG,3dv3go,pyromaster55,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:35:25 2015 UTC,"Combined with Push the Limit, you can Target Lock, then Focus (or barrel roll if you already have one or the other), then perform a green forward maneuver to set yourself up for a spontaneous Advanced Proton Torpedo."
XWingTMG,3dv3go,Rejusu,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:51:34 2015 UTC,"I rarely take B's without AS.  My go to list is 3 blues with AS and a Roark with Ion canon turret. The speed 2 K-turn combined with the AS allowing you to take a focus, barrel roll, or target lock before or after your maneuver PLUS the ion on the HWK means you can often outmaneuver the slipperiest ships with the horrible dials that come with the B's and Hwk. Add in Roarks ability to let one ship in your squad shoot first and you can really take opponents by surprise with the adaptability of the squad. Another tactic for me is to move up using rocks to block their shots, then barrel roll out right at the last minute before my maneuver.  It takes a bit to get used to but it's a blast to play."

So if 4 of them shoot one, it's dead, and if the other 3 shoot another, it's dead. That's a win in the second round assuming there's a layout to make it work."
XWingTMG,3dwe2h,mxzf,2,Mon Jul 20 02:59:16 2015 UTC,"It's impossible under normal circumstances (without using AoE exploits and such).    Since your ships can only shoot at each other and there are no rocks and you can't die by flying off the map, it's impossible for your last ship to die.    The only way to deal damage to your last ship is via your second-to-last ship's death.  Oh, and I guess mines are technically an option too, though it's really hard to kill yourself with your own mine.  I can't think of anyone other than the new TIE Punisher pilot who can do it."

The 2 ps3-s shoot at each other, then the ps1 with dms shoots at the lower hp ps3. after that you just feedback array down the deadmans switch ones with the rest. I think because of the simultanious attack rule you will alvays be able to finish it.  If my math is right you only need 5 dmg out of the 3 attacks of the dms Z-95-s, which should be fairly likely to happen if you have focus + TL and also not that rare if you only have TL.   This takes out some of the dice from the 7 dead man's switch setup"

XWingTMG,3dup6u,jebleez,2,Sun Jul 19 18:48:05 2015 UTC,"Well, 'green stuff' is a modeling compound, not a paint stripper, so that's probably not what you're looking for.  Everything I've heard about painting x-wing minis, however, has said that you don't really need to strip the paint, it's thin enough to just paint over just fine.  So, I'd just start painting with a basecoat rather than stripping paint."

Multiple thin coats make a better finished product than one thick coat.   That being said, if you need to strip some thickly painted on layers, 91% isopropyl alcohol and cotton swabs work great.   I've heard soaking in Simple Green or brake fluid works but will melt the model if soaked too long."

The only solvent I had handy was nail polish removed, so I used a bit of that and it left the original paint intact, while only stripping the acrylic paint layer! I don't know what the effect would be if I kept at it, but there's at least one thing that won't work."

Keyan pairs well with anything that gives him stress due to his ability, common choices are either push the limit or stay on target for his EPT. Beyond that I don't think he needs any upgrades. You could use the spare points to bring another ship in the form of a bandit squadron pilot or, if you dropped the sensors from your blue, another prototype pilot."

Also, as mentioned, his upgrades don't really synergise with his ability, you need some way to generate him a stress token."
XWingTMG,3du2tq,skiduck,16,Sun Jul 19 13:58:47 2015 UTC,"you can't. It applies after that step, but before the perform actions step. It is this way, so you cant clear it with a green move."
XWingTMG,3du2tq,tothbebe,2,Sun Jul 19 14:01:06 2015 UTC,"thank god.  the judge had this guy's back when he said it, and i thought that was total bs."
XWingTMG,3du2tq,mxzf,2,Sun Jul 19 14:06:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the wording is just there so that the stress gets applied after any green maneuver attempts to clear stress (so that a green maneuver through debris still stresses you), which is before your action phase which checks for stress before you're allowed to do an action."
XWingTMG,3du2tq,wpcolorado,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:32:06 2015 UTC,Isn't the effect of that timing also so you can safely perform a red maneuver through debris?  You'll end up with 2 stress but you can still do the red.
XWingTMG,3du2tq,jebleez,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:04:33 2015 UTC,"But you can't do a red maneuver if you're already stressed though, regardless of what you're trying to do."
XWingTMG,3du2tq,wpcolorado,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:01:29 2015 UTC,"I know, my point was one of the implications of how the timing worked was you are able to do a red maneuver through a debris field, even though that will result in a second stress in a single maneuver."
XWingTMG,3du2tq,jebleez,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:55:03 2015 UTC,"Okay, cool. I get what you're saying now."
XWingTMG,3du2tq,mxzf,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:09:41 2015 UTC,"Well, if you got stressed partway or not, you could still do a red maneuver.  The ""you can't make a red move while stressed"" only checks when you reveal your dial.  If you got stressed halfway through your move, by hitting debris, you would still execute the red maneuver and end up with 2 stress, regardless of if the stress from the debris got applied mid-maneuver or after it."
XWingTMG,3du2tq,wpcolorado,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:15:29 2015 UTC,"Right, that's what I was saying.  My point was there were timing implications besides a green maneuver through debris not auto-clearing the stress."
XWingTMG,3du2tq,VanderLegion,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:56:50 2015 UTC,"Right, that's what I was saying.   Not quite.  What he's saying is that the timing doesn't matter for a red maneuver, only for green.  For a red maneuver, even if it added hte stress BEFORE the check stress step, you'd still do the maneuver like normal then end up with 2 stress.  It doesn' tmatter when you get the debris stress for that.  For a red maneuver, the steps are:    Reveal Dial  If it's a red maneuver, check if you have stress.  If so, opponent gets to pick your maneuver.  Perform maneuver.   The stress from debris comes after the maneuver regardless of where it falls in relation to the check pilot stress step, so you're already past the point of the red maneuver caring if your'e stressed or not."
XWingTMG,3du2tq,AffixBayonets,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:05:24 2015 UTC,It is! If you didn't lose your action to stress then debris wouldn't be very threatening at all.
XWingTMG,3du2tq,Stetto,2,Sun Jul 19 14:52:58 2015 UTC,"This question is a little complicated.  Debris fields don't prevent you from performing actions, but they do stress you and stress DOES prevent you from taking actions. Additionally, the stress gets applied after the ""check pilot stress step"". This way a green maneuver can't remove it in the same round.  So unless you're Tycho or have Captain Yorr on your team, you won't be doing any actions."

As others have said, the timing of debris stress is worded to prevent it from being cleared by a green maneuver through the field."

Of course, the top builds also run Gunner, which comes from the Slave I.     TL;DR - Get one of everything, starting with the Decimator"
XWingTMG,3dvf6g,playnwin,2,Mon Jul 20 01:38:46 2015 UTC,I think it all depends.   Do you play scum too?  If so slave 1 is pretty useful.   Otherwise I love the decimator. Much more useful I think and the crew cards are fantastic.

XWingTMG,3dvf6g,Vepper,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:51:13 2015 UTC,"I have to vote for the deck, it is a really fun big ship with a lot of crew upgrades. I say get a firespray if you see yourself getting scum anytime soon."
XWingTMG,3dvf6g,KTreu42,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:43:00 2015 UTC,"For imperial,  the Decimator is just awesome. Only Imperial ship with a turret, plus the most health of any ship in standard play and great upgrade cards.  If you jump into scum,  i think the Scum faction really complements and improves the Firespray. It's the best single Scum ship IMO. So it's deciding between utility with the Firespray, or pure power with the Decimator."

XWingTMG,3dt53x,Lepre_Khan,2,Sun Jul 19 09:45:16 2015 UTC,There's a small group that plays weekly on Monday evenings.
XWingTMG,3dtj90,JustPlainnDave,5,Sun Jul 19 08:48:37 2015 UTC,If it is a generic pilot (one that does not have a bulleted name) you may use multiple instances of that pilot as long as you have the model and cardboard stat token. Unique pilots (pilots with a bullet by their name) may not be used multiple times in the same list.
XWingTMG,3dtj90,vesper_k,3,Sun Jul 19 08:53:30 2015 UTC,Thank you for the clarification!   Is the multiple generic pilot tactic a good one?
XWingTMG,3dtj90,vesper_k,8,Sun Jul 19 08:56:22 2015 UTC,"Yes! A common strategy is to fill a list with many low skill generic pilots to get several attacks per turn. These lists are known as ""swarms"" and have been a significant part of the X-Wing meta since Wave 1. There's also a variation of the swarm called the ""mini-swarm"" in which the list has a primary ship (typically Soontir Fel, Whisper, Fat Han, RAC, etc.) accompanied by a swarm of 3-4 cheaper ships such as Academy Pilot TIE Fighters or Bandit/Tala Squadron Z-95s."
XWingTMG,3dtj90,vesper_k,2,Sun Jul 19 09:00:08 2015 UTC,Is it possible to swarm with A-wings or another ship for the Rebels?
XWingTMG,3dtj90,alemondemon,5,Sun Jul 19 09:06:48 2015 UTC,Some players have used Prototype Pilots with Chaardan Refit as cheap and nimble filler/blockers.
XWingTMG,3dtj90,NDRB,3,Sun Jul 19 09:10:32 2015 UTC,"What are some good tactics for ""escorting"" B-wings and how many should I play?"
XWingTMG,3dtj90,tothbebe,3,Sun Jul 19 09:14:14 2015 UTC,A popular list recently is 4 blue squadron bwing pilots and 1 Bandit squadron headhunter
XWingTMG,3dtj90,bl1y,2,Sun Jul 19 10:27:15 2015 UTC,"I love 3 Blue Squadron Bs with 2 Prototype Pilot As. Use the Awings to block any large (or small but it is a little harder) based ships  (land where you think the other ship will land. If they hit you they lose an action plus can force them somewhere better for you. Prevents them barrel rolling or boosting also). You really need to make sure they are all working together, dividing your fire,  particularly early game, can be a very bad idea. I love my b-wings and A-wings."
XWingTMG,3dtj90,Studsmurf,2,Sun Jul 19 11:10:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah with A-wings its either Prototype pilots with charadann refit's or proton rockets or green squadron pilots with push the limits. They are strong, but the 2 attack dice can be a problem against 3 agility ships like the interceptors or IG-88-s.   The other popular rebel swarm is the 4 B-wings (Blue squadrons with either advanced sensors or a Z-95) which are really good with strong attack and lots of health. they eat up any ship that they can shoot at, but their dial makes them vulnerable to ships that can outmaneuver them.  Also you can run a Z-95 swarm, but they are better as filler ships imo (with 1 big named ship like han or dash).  There are in theory X-wing and Y-wing swarms, but the B-wing outshines those."

Autoblaster: Range 1   How do you keep this guy, who has one of the worst dials in the game, and no movement upgrades, within range 1 of an enemy?  Also you have bodyguard on him, so your other unit is tied to the slow HWK by a range 1 tether.  As a general list building tip, I would recommending doing a quick summary of each of the units in your list, and how they might operate. It usually catches problems like this before publishing."
XWingTMG,3dtqgv,krenzalore,2,Sun Jul 19 12:59:47 2015 UTC,"I'm just gonna say you come across as pretty douchy here. That whole remark about taking five seconds to catch problems ""before publishing.""  Anyway, I'd say it isn't as hard as you think to keep Palob in range one of Kavil or Boba, but it isn't the end of the world if you don't have him range one of his allies every single turn. The two autoblasters make enemies think twice about moving in on you and so does Palob's and Boba's abilities. This makes it easier to recover and also easier to make conservative moves. I don't think this is an incredible list, but it isn't as bad as you make it sound."
XWingTMG,3dtqgv,wafer_thin,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:15:42 2015 UTC,"I don't understand why people would ""move in"" on this, even if it didn't have the autoblasters. That would be just co-ooperating with the enemy to get his combo off."

You won't be able to reroll with both Lone Wolf and Boba's ability.   Palob needing to get into range 1 for autoblaster is probably not the best idea as hawks can be killed surprisingly easily if you're not using Recon Specialist with the Moldy Crow title.

XWingTMG,3dsfxc,TyrantNZ,6,Mon Jul 20 00:57:43 2015 UTC,Another tip I'll offer - learn to love the word 'proxy.' While not allowed in tournament play while your practicing at home feel free to test with upgrade cards or pilots you may not have yet - it's the best way to find out if you want the cards or not.
XWingTMG,3dsfxc,EdgeOfDreams,2,Sun Jul 19 02:15:55 2015 UTC,proxy?
XWingTMG,3dsfxc,TyrantNZ,3,Sun Jul 19 02:18:52 2015 UTC,"""proxy"" means something like ""substitute"".  A proxy card is one that you've printed out or written down the text and rules for so you can use it even though you don't own it. Proxy cards are illegal in tournament play, but for just playing with friends or casually at the local game store, they can save you a lot of money because you won't have to buy every ship just to get every upgrade card."
XWingTMG,3dsfxc,TyrantNZ,2,Sun Jul 19 02:33:31 2015 UTC,Use when you don't have. Write down the card you want and just use it
XWingTMG,3dsfxc,TyrantNZ,6,Sun Jul 19 02:21:19 2015 UTC,"Oh hey that's how I started as well!   As for tips I think you should take your wallet and lock it in a vault of some kind; it is perhaps the only way to protect yourself!

XWingTMG,3dsfxc,Theepum7,3,Sun Jul 19 01:04:44 2015 UTC,"Neither of these things are allowed - however the third faction, Scum and Villainy, takes some ships from both rebels and Imperials along with a few of their own.

XWingTMG,3dsfxc,Aanar,2,Sun Jul 19 01:10:54 2015 UTC,"It is not a fast ship, I'm more of an imperial player, but I think the b-wing's strengths are slow and calculated.  Don't try to race in or do big moves, keep your guns pointed at the opponent and let them come to you.  Also, for the amount of red on that dial. Advanced sensors is a great systems upgrade for b-wings"

XWingTMG,3dsfxc,RennFoxx,2,Sun Jul 19 01:18:51 2015 UTC,Let's you take your action before you reveal your dial.  So you still can get an action when doing a red move and getting stressed
XWingTMG,3dsfxc,Thopterthallid,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:21:18 2015 UTC,"The B-wing's biggest strength is its good stats for the point cost.  The dial makes it a little slow, but having barrel roll helps maneuverability.    4x Blue Squadron B wings is a common setup for 100 point games.  The last 12 can be spent on a Z-95 (making it a ""BBBBZ build"", or upgrades for the B's."
XWingTMG,3dsfxc,ernesto__-,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:24:09 2015 UTC,"Lately I've been loving HLC (heavy laser cannon) on a B-wing. It's a whopping 7 points, but it allows you to roll 4 red dice at ranges 2-3. Combined with the fact that defenders don't get an extra green die when defending against secondary weapons at range 3, adding one of these to your B means you'll always shoot 4 reds regardless of range (HLC for range 2-3, and primary weapon with extra red for range at 1).  What people said on this thread applies: fly slowly, keep them in your arc, and let them come to you. Chew them out when they do. If you combine this with ways to modify your dice (target locks are the most common), you can really stick a lot of hits.   HLC is part of the following expansions: Lamba shuttle, yt-2400, slave 1"

Playing MORE ships with FEWER upgrades is easier for new players. You ARE going to forget to use half of your upgrades anyway. Rebels and Scum are pretty much the same thing to Imperial Players.

XWingTMG,3dsfxc,drteeth1118,2,Sun Jul 19 01:32:08 2015 UTC,"Learn from every game. Win or loose, talk to your chosen opponent and figure out why one of you lost. Help your buddy by telling them what they could have done to beat you, or talk about what you could have done in hindsight if you lost. Even if they aren't your mistakes, you can still learn from them, and THAT is how you become a better pilot.  Also, don't be afraid to try new builds. B-wings are good, but if you find yourself feeling like every ship lost is too expensive, try a swarm or mini-swarm. Find the build that fits your play style.  And fly casual. I've never met a grumpy X-wing player, so don't be afraid to make friends when you play at your local game store."

First off theres always health to be had, at the expense of agility, ESPECIALLY on the decimator. Turret ships leave you free to focus on flying. You don't really care about keeping arc when you ARE the arc. Also, crew combos are fun to mess around with. Ever heard of a decimator with 3, COUNT EM, 3, tacticians. ORRRR, if you hate having to deal with those pesky squints that never seem to die, I know a sith lord called Darth Vader who does the job pretty well. Who cares that you lose 2 hp to deal a crit when you are literally a mountain of HP. Soontir is exhibit A with vader: You lose 2 hp, boo hoo, Soontir takes a crit. now hes down to 2 hp, loses stealth device if hes got it, and has to do what the crit says.

Even the Decimator with its sixteen total hitpoints goes down in a hurry if it's constantly being shot at. Therefore, on a large turret, either Engine Upgrade is key (for boosting) or you have to fly very well so that the enemy doesn't get shots. Now, it's not as hard as flying, say, an Interceptor brilliantly by any means, as you don't have to worry about where your arc is facing to get the shot (although now with Autothrusters in the field you often do if you actually want to put damage on)."

You can then load that font into a program like photoshop and make any text you like with it pretty easily, arrange that text, draw the rectangular bars at the top and bottom, and then do some simple rotating and/or skewing to get it to look like that logo."

XWingTMG,3dqqk4,AffixBayonets,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:02:12 2015 UTC,For the large I am considering a super dash. (I don't have c3po if that makes a difference. )   Super Dash doesn't need 3P0. Do you have Kyle? Throwing him on there and taking PtL is a better option than 3P0.
XWingTMG,3dqqk4,reverendmalerik,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:08:19 2015 UTC,"In a 4 man brawl I would say defense rather than offense should be your priority. Heck, if possible make it actively disadvantageous to target you (phantom with rebel captive maybe?). This will mean most will avoid targetting you and you should be able to go most of the game without taking damage, then sweep up at the end.  Alternatively go full mental and take rhymer armed to the teeth. This would probably be your one chance to use him after all.  Rhymer with veteran instincts (so you have any chance whatsoever of getting a target lock), two advanced torps, two homing missles, a proton bomb and an experimental interface.  Target lock, focus, launch advanced torps at range 2 and kill kill kill"
XWingTMG,3dqqk4,Aanar,1 point,Sun Jul 19 07:31:07 2015 UTC,Keyan Farlander + Sensor Jammer + Heavy Laser Cannon + 2x Ion Torpedos + Push the Limit + B-Wing/E2 + C-3PO seems like it would be fun to try out.  Pilot skill of 7 isn't great considering you'll probably be facing 9+ though.  And you're not going to outrun much.  But effectively getting a target lock and focus to spend on every attack from your HLC seems nasty.    Jammer and C3-PO gives you some defense.

XWingTMG,3dp5hu,rsixidor,2,Sat Jul 18 03:26:26 2015 UTC,Chewbacca is a pretty decent crew. Like a hull upgrade and shield for the cost of one.  Lando could do well as well.  PTL+Kyle is solid though not as favored on the 1300 as the 2400.
XWingTMG,3dp5hu,Slanesh,2,Sat Jul 18 03:29:52 2015 UTC,and why is it stronger on 2400? I never understood
XWingTMG,3dp5hu,rsixidor,3,Sat Jul 18 09:54:41 2015 UTC,More actions on the bar. Barrel roll being the biggest reason.
XWingTMG,3dp5hu,RennFoxx,2,Sat Jul 18 11:47:14 2015 UTC,"Here's two different builds that I like to run. Link 1 Link 2  The first link is just a Super Dash + Chewie build, nothing too special. The second link is more along the lines of what you were asking for. It's a 'Han Shot First' build, giving Han Solo VI in order to mostly guarantee that he'll do damage first. Instead of C-3PO, Dash (Crew)  is put on due to the fact that Han Needs to be shooting every turn in order to get the most value out of him, and Dash also lets Han go where he needs to go in order to get that sweet range-1 damage dice. I put 3 Z-95's as fillers up to 100 points, but they can be replaced by whatever you find to be best with your playstyle (E-wing, HAWK, B-wing, Etc)."
XWingTMG,3dp5hu,Slanesh,0,Sat Jul 18 10:06:40 2015 UTC,"So you're assuming that you're gonna fly poorly and land on asteroids? Dash is a bad crew member because he helps you when you make mistakes and you should aim to not make them, not mitigate some parts of them."
XWingTMG,3dp5hu,Late_for_something,2,Sat Jul 18 10:27:11 2015 UTC,I run dash crew on the 2400 for the no obstruction rule. I love range 3 hlc. Dash crew is more of a cannon buff than ship

XWingTMG,3docmc,ernesto__-,5,Fri Jul 17 22:45:34 2015 UTC,"Team Covenant had an ""Aces"" league.  How it worked was that some of the players that consistently did well in real life or vassal tournaments were invited into a small league. /u/starslinger72 was part of it so he probably knows more of the nitty gritty. Basically they played round robin and there were featured matches that got youtube video commentary on the Outer Rim Smugglers channel.  My thoughts was that we could have something similar. I'd especially like to see what kind of commentators are lurking around and see what they could do with first crack at some log files of really good players."

XWingTMG,3docmc,RDT2,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:21:13 2015 UTC,How about reactive mission events..
XWingTMG,3docmc,kkentium,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:56:03 2015 UTC,"Is it actually possible to create more ""reactive"" event/missions? A more dynamic process of play would perhaps be fun. So far I think it's mainly a fly here, shoot that, rinse and repeat until you have one or two outcomes.  An example I could think of would be one faction needs to escort 2 large ships off the map. They have predetermined flight path to follow loosely so they can't bee line right off. 1 of their large ships is carrying ""cargo"". It can be scripted to sound like new empire tecology or rebel operatives. The other faction needs to get within certain range to ""scan"" the crafts for the objective. The first scan would be based on dice rolls. Maybe hit/crit means positive, blank/focus means negative and by elimination their objective would then be on the other ship.  Players can deploy within unique starting areas example within range 2 of objective large ships or within range 2 of the edge but behind asteroids. Flying too close/into enemy spawn areas sets off alarms and both large ships start moving before the ""scans"" can take place. The longer flight path gives players time to react and they can choose to engage both large craft or efficiently scan and target only the right one.  Furthermore.. The cargo dropped can only be picked up by ships with certain hull value or more (to simulate on board space. Also to make sure like an interceptor can't pick up the objective and arc dodge zip away).   So maybe a couple of dynamic missions, with one mission result somehow affecting the setup/game play of the next. What do you guys think?"

There will be a few volunteers to be the Admirals of their factions. They direct the members of their team to a planet, then skirmishes break out when factions meet up at the same planet.  Or something like that.   Thanks for the work you've done PCGP!"

XWingTMG,3dns9c,HujoeBigs,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:11:41 2015 UTC,"Modern stealth is better than X-Wing cloaking. In X-Wing you actually deploy the units on the table.   If an older plane like an F-16 went up against an F-22, the first warning the F-16 pilot would have that there was even anyone in the area was when missiles ""magically"" appeared on his/her radar."

XWingTMG,3dpa8k,PCGamerPirate,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:02:27 2015 UTC,"Pretty much this.  I always justified it by thinking that you're not going to put your aces in a big,  lumbering bomber where their abilities to out-fly their enemies can't be put to good use. Salm is a good pilot and a general,  yeah,  but that doesn't mean he's an ace the way Wedge or Soontir are.   Scum Y pilots have EPTs because their ships are stolen,  salvaged,  or otherwise all they have available. It's not an organized military where someone is deciding to give the best ships to the best pilots to best make use of their abilities. Kavil pilots a Y because that's what he has, and he'll have to make due.  But really,  yeah. It's just the Wave 1 design team was a little too conservative with the Y Wing, because they really didn't know where the game was going at that point."
XWingTMG,3dpa8k,thocan,2,Sat Jul 18 20:49:56 2015 UTC,There's an astromech that comes with the rebel transport (r2-d6) that gives you an EPT slot.

XWingTMG,3dnaam,Zhak22,2,Fri Jul 17 17:35:37 2015 UTC,"For example, I find whem flying against a tie swarm it's best to setup in a position to split up the swarm. I personally don't engage two mini swarms, but rather flank them and cause chaos in their tight formations. That way the swarm player cannot maximise shot economy each turn because he will be busy repositioning some units and not have the arcs. Priority would be to down howlrunner, then given opportunity, occasionally lead one or two ties away from the swarm."
XWingTMG,3dnaam,sacimino40,2,Fri Jul 17 17:36:19 2015 UTC,Why would a swarm player break up his swarm instead of focus fire on one target at a time?
XWingTMG,3dnaam,dielon108,2,Fri Jul 17 18:43:04 2015 UTC,I've had luck dragging their formation through astroid fields forcing them to break up.
XWingTMG,3dnaam,HujoeBigs,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:52:45 2015 UTC,"Asteroids. Or if you break up your squad to engage the swarm on two fronts. There was once I flew XBA. The X and b I let crawl towards his swarm that was coming straight for me. I sent the a around the asteroids to flank the swarm. The player broke off 2 of his 6 ties to engage the a. Amongst asteroids and flying in tight formation, it basically ruined his play.  I only had to deal with 4 ties at the very first combat phase instead of the full 6."
XWingTMG,3dnaam,HujoeBigs,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:04:12 2015 UTC,"As a swarm player, if you do this to me, I will just turn one into a blocker and maneuver the rest to focus fire on the blocked target. The roids are where I like to be, makes a great blocking field and TIEs with their 1 hard turn and BR can navigate them with ease."
XWingTMG,3dnaam,JohnLucCarry91,1 point,Sat Jul 18 10:01:50 2015 UTC,Won't that leave your swarm open to other flanks?
XWingTMG,3dnaam,AffixBayonets,1 point,Sat Jul 18 12:33:26 2015 UTC,"Yes it will, but if I can blow up some of your ships while you try to plink a TIE or two, 26 points for 21+ on your side. I would accept that exchange. Usually most people don't flank anyhow it's me who flanks them 95% of the time."
XWingTMG,3dnaam,sacimino40,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:07:04 2015 UTC,"Against swarms you want to try to create large dense asteroid fields during  setup, and then fight in or through these fields. However difficult it may be for your ships to maneuver, its 5x more difficult for a Swarm.  Arc dodgers are also huge boons here. Anybody like Jake, Soontir, even Han Solo (with EU) will be very valuable when fighting swarms."
XWingTMG,3dnaam,howieloader,2,Sat Jul 18 12:24:26 2015 UTC,"Are swarms really a ""meta"" list anymore? In my area I've played in four tournaments and a fair number of casual games and never seen a pure TIE swarm. The closest was Whisper or Soontir leading a mini swarm."

XWingTMG,3dnwel,AffixBayonets,2,Fri Jul 17 20:20:11 2015 UTC,"Depends what you want to do with them. If you're looking for top table competitive list, then right now there's probably not a lot of room for them. If you want some fun options, I like running Laetin + Title + HLC + Stealth Device for a ship that you can't ignore but which it takes a ton of dice to take down.  You can also just use them as cheap cannon carriers, and if you're doing that you're either running Mangler for hunting big ships or Ion for control. I have a heavy ion scum list I run sometimes which is this.  It's not top-tier competitive but it does some fun stuff and can be very frustrating to take down."
XWingTMG,3dnwel,gammon9,3,Fri Jul 17 20:29:47 2015 UTC,"You can also just use them as cheap cannon carriers, and if you're doing that you're either running Mangler for hunting big ships or Ion for control. I have a heavy ion scum list I run sometimes which is this.   You have to call that list ""Mr. Bonearm's Wild Ride.""  Back to the subject, I just have one and I'd like to use it in some fun games where it isn't terrible. I suppose Laetin with a cannon is probably the best option here because she can't be focused down easily, but her lack of a EPT really does hurt."
XWingTMG,3dnwel,gammon9,3,Fri Jul 17 20:33:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the lack of an EPT is a big downside. I'd really like to be able to PTL turtle on those turns where you expect incoming fire. Their dial is also just slightly worse than where it needs to be IMO."
XWingTMG,3dnwel,gammon9,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:38:37 2015 UTC,"Well it does have a fair bit of small greens, which is why I really want to make a Veteran work with PtL but haven't managed to make a build I'm happy with yet.   I think they're just too pricey. A slightly better dial or a slightly lower cost would make them work much better. Or reduce the ""Heavy"" title price as a missile Scyk has real trouble beating a standard Z-95 and a Torpedo Scyk is pretty useless."
XWingTMG,3dnwel,rsixidor,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:40:57 2015 UTC,"I think you can't really make them cheaper without really eating into the Z's niche, although they could have safely knocked a point off of the title, I think.  Dial-wise I would want either a 3 hard white or (to make them feel more scum-ish) to replace their 3k with S-loops. Without native boost, you can rely on the fact that a scyk is either moving a significant distance or changing their heading significantly but never both, and that makes them a bit too predictable to be good interceptors."
XWingTMG,3dnwel,rsixidor,2,Fri Jul 17 21:31:31 2015 UTC,One thing I've seen in a few regionals lists was Serissu with DTF.  Sort of a Biggs-type thing.

XWingTMG,3dnwel,PCGamerPirate,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:47:19 2015 UTC,"Usually 3 ship. Serissu flies with Palob and you can fill in the rest a few ways. Lone Wolf Guri, kavill, etc."
XWingTMG,3dnwel,JoebillJr,2,Fri Jul 17 20:52:53 2015 UTC,Kavil is rapidly becoming my favorite Scum ship to add to 3+ ship lists. Blaster Turret + R4 Agro makes him surprisingly powerful at 30 points.
XWingTMG,3dnwel,Nomnomnicon,2,Fri Jul 17 21:05:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I was excited about these so I picked up two, but I find myself hard ever using them. Without the title I feel they are just a headhunter that gains the evade action and barrel for a 2 point premium, but add the title and a cannon and you have at least 4 more point invested into them... I think the title should be 1 point or maybe even free since you have to invest even more points after the title to gain any use out of it. I think they would see a lot of use in my lists if that were the case."

XWingTMG,3dmnn2,towmule,2,Fri Jul 17 15:19:13 2015 UTC,"That's definitely a 1 or 2 point upgrade...  It's makes 3 defenders, 2 with ion cannons, 1 flechette cannon, pretty damn awesome."
XWingTMG,3dmnn2,Nomnomnicon,2,Fri Jul 17 19:31:36 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, it would be pretty damn awesome. However, there are some sunk costs associated with the card that I think merit the free cost.  1) You have to buy a cannon.  2) The defender is already overpriced.  I've flown triple defenders quite a few times now and, while powerful, has serious problems against the current meta. I think having control with damage would give them a chance without being too powerful."
XWingTMG,3dmnn2,Nomnomnicon,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:40:06 2015 UTC,"""Heavy Syck"" is 2 and you still have to by the cannon - although I consider this cost over priced.  Everybody says the TIE D is overpriced. I really disagree. What makes you feel it is? 30 points is a lot but 'expensive' isn't the same as 'overpriced'. I'd be interested to know why getting something nearly as tough as an IG88 for 6 points less is considered a hard sell in your opinion?"
XWingTMG,3dmnn2,rsixidor,1 point,Mon Jul 20 08:04:30 2015 UTC,"I find the Defender to be about 1 to 2 points overpriced. 3 at the most.  Those 6 points get you a lot. While the large base helps reduce the cost of IG88, access to the system slot, evade action, 9 green maneuvers (especially banks), and 5 additional PS are worth it.  A Defender has the efficiency of a turreted ship. That white k turn is supposed to be worth the same as a turret.  That isn't to say they are a bad ship. However, without access to certain tools (because of missing slots, actions, or not enough points) it is found wanting.  The big thing about the defender is that it is not suited for the current meta. Arc dodging is the name of the game and defenders aren't capable of keeping pace because of the limited dial and action bar.  If the meta moved closer to swarms of 2 attack ships, the defender would shine because its effective health pool is so much better against two attack ships.  There are ways to make the defender work already. Vessery is the most accurate gun in the game and makes up his efficiency as long as his targets are painted. Lone Wolf Rexler with a hull upgrade is surprisingly tanky and can be effective when something else can eat rebel captive stress.  I've flown triple defenders with hull upgrade in vassal tournaments 8 times and batted .500. My wins were always against builds without an arc dodger."
XWingTMG,3dmnn2,mybuddy,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:13:14 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the full reply! I get they are expensive, and if they cam in at 28 points base I would be a happy little fighter pilot! But I find I alway get my points worth out of them - although I haven't run the generics, truth be told. I currently run Rexlar and Whisper, both tooled to the teeth. I find that if I hang back with the Defender a lot of people chase the Phantom, which leaves Rexlar to do his thing. I also only own one, but would love to try triple D.  What list do/did you use re: upgrades?"

Playing the game for a while makes it a lot easier to come up with ""balanced"" cards. While some of mine are way out, I think there are a lot of good ideas from the entire subreddit.  I think the most fun comes from discussion how to tweak a proposed idea.  I would eventually like to collect some of the top scoring ones and play a couple games with them as options."

XWingTMG,3dmnn2,3rd_Charmer,2,Fri Jul 17 16:13:03 2015 UTC,"Just spit balling on non-discard ideas for the slot.  There are a lot of ships with simple missile slots (and perhaps ONLY a missile slot) that go underutilized, so it'd be great to give them an option that they can use beyond a single use that isn't quite as strong as a cannon slot, but still a nice improvement."
XWingTMG,3dmnn2,scuff,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:30:38 2015 UTC,"I think the issue is that maybe this sort of card is just flat better than taking missiles in the slots.

It's also fantastically unlikely to draw more than one direct hit in three cards. It also is really ineffective against ships with no shields. You also have to send your target lock, so you're not getting that on the attack, and the attack doesn't modify any of your rolls. I think 5 or 6 points is fair.   Also, how do you figure 9 damage and three crits?"
XWingTMG,3dmnn2,towmule,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:36:14 2015 UTC,You don't need three.  2 hits is a guaranteed kill on a 2 hull ship even though it has 4 health.  Even one hit is something like a 30% chance of a kill.

Now, there's also nothing to stop you from using opportunist on this.  Or Jan Ors.  Lets say you have both, and you're shooting with Han  You attack another falcon, they can't dodge for some reason?  5 shields and minimum of 5 hull gone.  34% chance of them being at 2 health, 23% chance of 1, and 6% chance of a one-shot.  Again, only taking direct hits into account.  Even a surviving ship there has multiple normal crits it needs to deal with there and probably won't be able to take actions or hard turns or something that will cripple it so it's easily killed next turn.

Minor hull breach and stunned pilot can do additional damage as well, though it's harder to calculate the percentage since they rely on other things.

XWingTMG,3dnaqt,diamondtron24,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:38:57 2015 UTC,"No experienced pilot is going to let those Z's anywhere close to him in a group, unless he's intentionally bumping one to keep it from shooting the procket, and likely destroying another before it fires so only 1 gets to deliver the payload.  it COULD be deadly, but I suspect it will disappoint."
XWingTMG,3do46z,ernesto__-,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:21:04 2015 UTC,"Intelligence agent only works well if they are within range 1-2 and they have a higher PS than you, right? Otherwise they already moved or they were range 3 because that's where your HLC thrives. Not sure if I am convinced, again I do not play very competitively. I see Intelligence Agent doing marvelous things with the new bombers though. Pick the cheapest K-wing so your PS is absolutely as low as possible then take a ton of mines and have fun."
XWingTMG,3do46z,Blackxp,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:58:23 2015 UTC,"It is range 1-2 but ps doesn't matter, I just pick a ship. It's better that it is close range so I know where to esape"
XWingTMG,3do46z,Blackxp,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:28:49 2015 UTC,"I suppose so, but since you cannot change your dial wouldn't you already know where all of the low PS ships will move anyways? Since they move before you and that effectively reveals that information. It's knowing how to use you boost/barrel roll actions against previously unknown high PS ships that could be useful, since you normally do not know where they will be until after you complete your movement and actions. Or am I reading intelligence agent wrong?  Dont get me wrong. I love the card, but you would almost need Navigator too (as a second crew member) to change your dial movement so that it becomes more impactful. As I said, I see this shining less on Dash and more on low PS bombers who can place mines or even know when to effectively drop bombs with better knowledge of where your opponent will be.  You can't change your dial, right? Because if that's true this is AMAZING. I gotta review my terrible understanding of the phases lol."

XWingTMG,3do1j7,M1STER_TURTLE,2,Fri Jul 17 21:00:04 2015 UTC,"I think you've overloaded on upgrades for two ships that are not going to survive long enough to get value out of them. I'd drop both of the missiles and the Stealth Device (Brath will not have a Focus to boost his defense anywhere near often enough to make SD worth it). That leaves you at 84 points, enough room to add a TIE Fighter such as Dark Curse or an Academy Pilot with a Hull or Shield upgrade (depending on how much you care about leaving a point for initiative bidding). The extra distraction and blocking capability you'll get by having one more ship on the board should go a long way toward letting Brath and Vader do their jobs.  http://geordanr.github.io/xwing/?f=Galactic%20Empire&d=v3!s!71:57,23,-1:-1:-1:;22:56,-1:23:3:U.124;16::-1:-1:  As an alternative plan, try dropping Brath for Vessery, whose pilot ability synergizes with Vader's ATC quite nicely. That opens up some points and action economy to do something like this: http://geordanr.github.io/xwing/?f=Galactic%20Empire&d=v3!s!70:27,23,-1:-1:-1:;22:56,-1:23:3:U.124;16::-1:1:"

XWingTMG,3dn5zq,sacimino40,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:31:44 2015 UTC,A bold choice. I personally have never flown that but it may work. Lack of evade action might hurt the staying power with only 5 health per ship. I feel like youd be better off with 4 B-wings and 3 points worth of upgrades on them if you were to go that route. But thats just heavy on the meta

XWingTMG,3dn535,ernesto__-,4,Fri Jul 17 16:57:34 2015 UTC,"4 A wings with Proton Rockets and PTL, or 4 A wings with PTL, Outmaneuver, Chardaan Refit and Autothrusters.  The Bs will drop to the proton rockets like no one's business.  Because my greens are PS3 and your Blues are PS2 they don't get to shoot back.  Then 4 A wings spend the rest of the game Focus + Evading and getting autothrusters against Dash.  Dash has to stay at range 2-3 and almost certainly will be out of his front arc when shooting so he is a 1 die defender against 4 ships that have 2-3 dice and a focus + evade every turn."
XWingTMG,3dn535,MaximusNerdius,2,Fri Jul 17 17:50:55 2015 UTC,"To play devil's advocate though, Dash will frequently be out of arc of 2 or more of these A-Wings. It's also very possible that focus fire from Dash and 2 B-Wings will kill an A-Wing before they reach range 1."

XWingTMG,3dn535,MaximusNerdius,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:03:44 2015 UTC,"I am starting to wonder why swarms have fallen out of favor.  With the current 2 ship meta and at least 1 of those ships generally being a large ship, swarms seem like the best list to run right now since swarms are the death of large ships."
XWingTMG,3dn535,AffixBayonets,2,Fri Jul 17 18:06:25 2015 UTC,"Swarms are bump city until you get skilled with them, and I've seen very few people willing to do so."
XWingTMG,3dn535,sacimino40,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:56:13 2015 UTC,"At the Sacramento Regionals a swarm player went 6-0 in swiss and ended up getting beaten by a double decimator. The dice were not kind to him and oicunn w/ vader ended up killing i think 4-5 of the TIE's. 2-3 of those were one hit on the attack and then a direct hit crit w/ vader. The swarm could have and probably should have won the game, and most likely the tournament since if he had won he would have played the person he beat in the last round of swiss (Han+Jake.)"
XWingTMG,3dn535,HujoeBigs,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:14:19 2015 UTC,"I think it because of the 2 ships build damage output. Corran can double tap, dash has HLC which is deadly to 3 hull ships without autos. Imperials have vader, Han has gunner, phantoms have natural 4 red dice, and you can't even hit soontir. I think the ties will find themselves being one shotted more than anything IMO."
XWingTMG,3dn535,Korlus,0,Fri Jul 17 18:18:44 2015 UTC,"Ah, yes, Vader. The reason I took out a decimator in one turn and didn't lose a single ship. vader should never, ever, not a single time, go onto a decimator, no matter the reason. Still can't believe that decimator was off the board in the second turn. Also, don't ever misjudge the damage output of TIEs, they will mess you up."
XWingTMG,3dn535,HujoeBigs,1 point,Sat Jul 18 10:17:03 2015 UTC,"Vader onboard a Decimator is almost a hard counter to Soontir Fel, and several other similar ships. It's bad in many other matchups, but a Patrol Leader with Vader aboard is only 43 points, and will often be a fantastic investment for a list."
XWingTMG,3dn535,Korlus,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:38:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah... no. if you wasted 4 of your 16 health to do at most 3 damage to my Fel, thank you. Its how I blew up a decimator in a single turn at regionals. Decimators need their health, and when you start tearing apart your own expensive ship to take down a lesser expensive ship, it isn't a good exchange."
XWingTMG,3dn535,HujoeBigs,2,Sat Jul 18 20:04:59 2015 UTC,"It's not about the damage, but the criticals. How do you fancy having one less attack die, or having your turns red? Losing two health of a 14 health ship to pote finally cripple a ship that cost 35 points would usually be considered a bargain."
XWingTMG,3dn535,Korlus,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:34:05 2015 UTC,"Oh, I don't mind, you crippled my 35 point ship, I just blew up your 65 point ship in a single round of combat, I'll take that every time. Or your 43 point ship, either way, it isn't a good exchange for the deci player. Doom shuttle are fantastic because they give you the ability to cripple on a cheaper ship then the one you are firing at. You might find it worth it, but every time I see it across the table from me, I am extremely happy.  Edit: Mind you he did get a thrust control fire and a console fire on a PtL Fel after firing at a rebel captive. If I didn't roll a blank on one of those turns I would of been dead, but it then was 5 full health obsidians vs. his Fel, which while hard is still a fight in my favor."
XWingTMG,3dn535,HujoeBigs,2,Sat Jul 18 23:16:02 2015 UTC,"1/7 of the health and no crippling effects of a 43pt ship vs. 1/3 - 2/3 the health and a crippling effect on a 35pt ship? And it works 100% of the time? How will this ever not be a good deal, unless you're flying a 55+ point monstrosity? Of course Vader shouldn't go on every/most RAC builds, but on stock ships it's an incredibly strong option against ships like Fel. Especially as they basically can't touch him without it."
XWingTMG,3dn535,Aanar,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:26:54 2015 UTC,"Please do that, and your math is wrong if you only proc it once, it's 1/8, but still enough to kill it. I don't mind you softening up your 43 point ship for crippling mine though. It will be a paper weight later anyhow. :)"
XWingTMG,3dn535,HujoeBigs,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:48:59 2015 UTC,"Doesn't MoV and a time limit factor heavily?  If the swarm doesn't take out one of the ships of a 2 ship build, they're going to lose due to losing at least a couple Ties along the way."
XWingTMG,3dn535,Korlus,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:44:47 2015 UTC,"And that's why we go for the 5-1 or 6-0 wins, where MoV means nothing to us and we still make the cut."

Han is best with 3p0 and gunner or r2d2 so I don't think I'd run him without either of those.   Based on your suggestions I'd recommend either super dash with 2 protos and a bandit or fringer with outrider, ion, 2 b wings with advanced sensors and a bandit or swap one AS for fcs and give the fringer intelligence agent."

XWingTMG,3dmgw9,ernesto__-,2,Fri Jul 17 17:23:39 2015 UTC,"Whelp, I'm not entirely sold on these lists. A low PS 2400 without PTL will be way too easy to get at range one with the HLC one. And as for the ion cannon one, I don't think it will contribute much, it's only one damage through assuming you even hit, but they're still ioned. As for Han, you gotta give him some punch for this kind of list. I'm talking gunner with lone wolf or something. If you're really bet of using both freighters your best bet is cheque and leebo."

I was at a store's monthly last week and guy brought a YT-2400 model instead of a YT-1300. No one cared.  I could see the rule being there to prevent people from changing the color of maneuvers, or sneaking a hard 1 onto an E-Wing or something, but using an obviously custom dial makes it virtually impossible to get away with that because yo're drawing so much attention to the dial.  If you were going to cheat, you'd just grab the bottom disk for a different ship. But, it's such a dumb cheat because so many people know all the maneuvers or every ship anyways. I can't really imagine someone trying to pull this off in a real tournament. You know in the last round you're going to be up against someone who knows their shit.  If you like the custom dial, get it. Use it. Pack the regular dial just in case someone does complain, but mostly people will just think it's really cool."

XWingTMG,3diigp,PCGamerPirate,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:02:25 2015 UTC,"Those are absolutely some of the things that separate the originals. You can even even tell in Jedi when it starts falling apart, because the director was a nobody and GL walked all over him. There wasn't anyone available to say ""no"" to things, like the idea to replace the Wookies with Ewoks.  Empire was directed by Irvin Kershner, who was one of GL's film school teachers. He had the prestige to make it work. And frankly the shooting script they had for Empire was a C+. They ""found"" the magic of that film on set-- something that is harder, but not impossible, to do when the sets don't exist.  Edit: hit submit by accident. I understand that thread, and I've seen it before. It's point boils down to basically: there's more practical and in the prequels than you thought, and they used a lot of blue screen in the originals. Neither of those things were new information for me, and they don't change how I feel about the jarring examples of CG that pulled me out of suspension of disbelief, and interefered with the acting in the prequels.  There's plenty of bad acting in the originals, and McGregor and Neeson are both excellent actors capable of great performances (although I think they weren't' given anything to work with, script wise, or materially.) Laying the differences between the movies on good acting, misses the point. Both sets of films had some good, and some really bad acting.  We can absolutely agree that directing, and story telling was an unqualified factor in the difference between the sets."

I've only played brobots twice, and won both times using two methods.   1st time- Arc dodging. Now I only ran Han+Ten numb and Ten had advanced sensors. There were so many turns when ten barrel rolled before he moved to escape arcs. Now  b wing are by no means arc dodgers, but in saying that's all it takes.  2nd time- Raw power. Fat dash + 2 blues will certainly do the job. As long as you have HLC."
XWingTMG,3dkrec,ernesto__-,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:37:24 2015 UTC,"Dropping in to agree with these points. I've played against various set-ups of dual IG, and the advanced sensors + PTL/predator/lonewolf+ HLC + autothrusters iteration is the scariest, imo. But they're still arc-based ships, they're still only 8 HP apiece, and they still fall apart to modified dice. Ironically, anything similar to what they're doing above is their worst nightmare. Crucially, once one of them dies, the other suffers. A single IG is still tough, but nowhere near as good as one with two pilot talents, so focus one down."
XWingTMG,3dkrec,specialmeats,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:03:23 2015 UTC,"There are two good ways to really beat them. One is superior PS and some ability to reposition. 58 point Dash is really strong against PS6 brobots and with corran as his wingman, it's an uphill battle for the brobots if you can fly well.  The other good strategy is stress. A Y with R3-A2 (stress droid) Ion cannon turret and the title can double stress an aggressor at R1-2, and almost always requires 3 shots to kill it. Back that up with some ion cannons or Blues with tactician and you can easily make brobots cry."
XWingTMG,3dkrec,antigrapist,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:09:29 2015 UTC,"Stress works well against the version with Accuracy Correctors. If they field Fire Control System, it works less good. They receive all their offensive automatically and you're ""only"" denying Boost+Evade and Evade actions."
XWingTMG,3dkrec,Stetto,3,Fri Jul 17 06:37:20 2015 UTC,"Denying all of their defensive and repositioning actions is pretty amazing, though – not to mention the ability to K-turn or Sloop. If they take B&D, stress can actually make D's ability completely irrelevant, and if you're running the standard Panic Attack list then B's ability is practically never going to trigger. The Panic Attack list can force a joust against the Brobots and then outjoust them while ignoring a lot of their bullshit. Panic might not truly 'counter' the Brobots, but it does a good job of leveraging its strengths against their weakness."
XWingTMG,3dkrec,FunkyHat112,1 point,Fri Jul 17 07:33:35 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the suggestions. My experience has been that even with 3 or 4 attack dice, getting 3 hits on an attack roll just ends up usually with 1 point of damage, maybe it's unlucky dice. I have considered stress with multiple tacticians in various combinations of ships to remove the red manouvers to make them more predictable, and found with the large base and boost, they're able to disengage and re-engage fairly quickly after removing stress. I was looking at unavoidable damage from proxy mines, and feedback arrays, etc but proxy mines are so unreliable (damage wise) and feedback arrays come with other consequences, that I've started fielding crazy stuff like Chiraneau with Expert Handling and 3 tacticians so I can reposition after their movement and get better odds at getting tactician off.. It definitely looks like high PS is the way to go though."

XWingTMG,3dkrec,scumoftherealm,1 point,Fri Jul 17 04:28:33 2015 UTC,"I like to fly brobots.  I usually do b/c with adrenaline rush, HLC, advanced sensors, autothrusters, and inertial dampeners.  It's a pretty solid list, but the most trouble I've had with this list (like a few others have said) comes from arc dodgers.  If he's running HLCs on both keep in mind he only gets one shot with his primary gun at range 1 but he can crit with that so, make it count.  In my experience flying brobots has me action dependant, if you can deny actions do so, stress and bumping.    The only other thing I can think to tell you is that whole, know thy enemy thing.  Before I started flying brobots I was finding them really difficult to beat, I've been flying them exclusively for a few weeks now and I can usually predict when an opponent is going to try some silly crap with the crazy turns and whatnot now.   Any who I hope some of that rambling helps :)"
XWingTMG,3dkrec,boredompwndu,1 point,Fri Jul 17 05:46:03 2015 UTC,"Action denial is why the mini tie swarm has been effective for me.

I'll try the arc dodgers with high PS, but I fear one bad judge of positioning and I'll lose a ship in one round. Thanks for all the recommendations."
XWingTMG,3dkrec,FunkyHat112,1 point,Fri Jul 17 06:18:07 2015 UTC,"Looking at your list, the really scary part of it is whisper. I want Whisper gone, but after I clear her, its going to be a walk in the park. The best way to screw me over as Dual IG is to tease me with whisper right in front. Cloak up and get me to sink my FCS target locks on her, and then run away. Most mortal IG's will go ham chasing your Whisper, who can outplay us laterally like there's no tomorrow.  Alternatively, we spend time beating up your Black squadrons. They don't hurt as much, but they're also much less slippery, in which case your Whisper has plenty of time to dance around causing problems. Be wary of these aggressors though. They can set up a killbox without much warning, and that's never a good sign. Int. Agent gives you a warning of what is to come, but you'll only get half the story, less if the bots have Adv. Sensors.  If your looking for general strategies, you want to set up shop in the asteroid field. Brobots like a fairly loose pack that they can bounce around without losing too many options for movement. Since you get half the rocks there isn't much you can do to stop this, but if you get things on off angles, it really closes up lanes for bots. (Off angles are the 22.5 degree weirdness. stuff you cant line up with from banks and straights)  One of the brobots biggest benefits, as many will tell you, is their action bar. We hate losing our actions. If we can't modify defense dice, we melt faster then Soontir pre-autothrusters. Easiest way to ruin actions is stress. Not much in your list, but you have a swarm, which can go a long way to blocking lanes, especially because teh swarm moves first. (Upper level brobot players will see lane blocks coming and move in a direction that isn't that way if you have ships to follow up your block. On the one hand, your lane block wasn't ""successful"" since you and him didn't collide, but he's probably running away from you, and that really isn't bad, especially if he takes stress to do it. (He can't turn back around if he's stressed)  Block lanes, get him to spend him consumables (such as inertial dampeners) early. Those singular rounds may suck a little since he outplays you, but once the consumables are gone, he becomes much less slippery"
XWingTMG,3dkrec,leewardstyle,1 point,Fri Jul 17 07:48:48 2015 UTC,"I think it's important when analyzing any list to really break down its strengths and weaknesses as much as possible.  Strengths   High firepower that's almost guaranteed to do something Decent resilience, particularly against low firepower with all the green dice/evade tokens or against turrets with Autothrusters An amazing maneuver dial and the boost action (which is particularly powerful on large ships) This only comes up in timed tournament play, but being a 2-ship list typically makes for a strong MOV showing   Together these strengths mean that a Brobots list can typically go toe-to-toe with other 2-ship builds, leveraging the first two strengths, and can do a reasonable approximation of arc-dodging vs. more efficient jousting lists. That's really what makes Brobots so effective – it has some kind of plan versus just about any opponent.  Weaknesses   Mediocre native PS Still definitely weaker in the joust than a true dedicated list, even against 2-red-dice swarms (and especially against B-wings) They only have two standard arcs – no turret or an auxiliary arc to help keep their guns trained on a target   The last point is a little more abstract, but it's actually one of their bigger weaknesses. Since Brobots are also large-based ships, they naturally move pretty quickly. In combination with their lack of a turret or auxiliary arc, they simply have to turn around, and all their options for doing so are vulnerable to stress. It also means they have mediocre arc coverage. In combination with the first weakness, that leaves them vulnerable to being arc-dodged by many ace pilots.  Now, assuming your opponents list looks something like this, there are a couple further considerations.   You've said his IG-88 B has two defensive upgrades, whereas his IG-88 D is left high and dry. That means his D should be your first target every time. It still won't die in one round, but it should die in two to three rounds of concentrated fire of a high-firepower list.  It can – and probably should – choose to zoom the fuck away once it gets low, but that's still a strategic win.   Adrenaline Rush and Inertial Dampeners give his ships some additional options. The key here is not to let those options take you by surprise. Be aware of which ships have which upgrades and fly accordingly and this shouldn't be the end of the world.  I'm not going to give specific lists to counter them. There are tons of possibilities, and what you go with is dependent on what you have access to/like to fly. Whatever you do choose, choose it with this idea in mind: while the Brobots may have a plan versus every list, they are not guaranteed to be able to follow that plan. Force them out of their comfort zone. Make them fight to keep arcs on you if you fly ace pilots or fight to stay out of arc versus jousters. Most importantly, make sure you do a similar analysis to whatever list you choose. Identify your own strengths and weaknesses and play accordingly."

XWingTMG,3die54,PCGamerPirate,8,Thu Jul 16 14:55:25 2015 UTC,"The TIE Interceptor is the gold standard for arc dodgers. Unlike A Wings, every one has boost and barrel roll standard and a base 3 attack. Unlike Starvipers or Aggressors, it has green turns.   Let's not beat around the bush, Soontir Fel is an amazing pilot and arguably the best Imperial ship period for his cost. He pairs beautifully with PtL and the Royal Guard title weds Autothrusters with either Stealth Device to dodge damage all day or a Targeting Computer for more damage.   The Baron isn't the only pilot worth taking though.    Carnor Jax shuts down many builds with his great ability  Royal Guard pilots give you the title on the cheap  Saber Squads give you the cheapest EPT  Alphas, if you simply must have autothrusters on five ships.    Overall though I can't vouch for the Alphas. The Interceptor is only truly realized with PtL and ATs. Every effective build has to take them and that's the best way to take advantage of all the green on that dial. Without those things it really isn't good enough at dodging damage to get by. Also, I'm not very impressed by the other pilots, though Kir Kanos could be fun. I'd quite like to read reports of success with other named pilots.   Soontir Fel is a key part of most competitive Imperial lists these days, with it being very common to pair him with a fully loaded Rear Admiral Chiraneau. He can be paired with just about anything though - Shuttle and Phantom, Shuttle and Jax, a Howlrunner-led mini swarm, I've seen all these work.   Jax alone is less common but he has his uses. I've tried 2 RGPs with a Decimator too but I always feel too squeezed for points to fully realize either ship type.   Overall it's a phenomenal ship and a must-have in any Imperial arsenal. Just make sure you get those Autothrusters cards somehow and Stealth Device is recommended too."
XWingTMG,3die54,AffixBayonets,5,Thu Jul 16 16:08:40 2015 UTC,Everything you all have said is completely true...however...  Can we all agree that no one has any use for Fel's Wrath?
XWingTMG,3die54,RFarmer,9,Thu Jul 16 22:12:46 2015 UTC,"He can have the most hype win ever:  Corran is the last ship left, he uses his end phase attack to kill Fel's Wrath during the End phase.  Fel's Wrath is NOT removed and the next round commences.  After movement Corran cannot attack so we go to Fel's Wrath's turn. He hits Corran and destroys him. Fel's Wrath is then removed from the board.  The Imperial player gets a win with 100 MoV."

XWingTMG,3die54,MysteriousRacer_X,3,Thu Jul 16 22:30:10 2015 UTC,"With the inclusion of autothrusters, the Tie Interceptor became arguably the best Arc-Dodger in the game. The native boost and barrel roll along with strong pilot abilities make this ship both cheap and effective.  Soontir Fel is a top tier pilot in the game. A standard ""Super Soontir"" build includes Push the Limit, Autothrusters, and a Stealth Device, though there is some debate on how to fill the second modifications slot."
XWingTMG,3die54,AffixBayonets,3,Thu Jul 16 15:22:37 2015 UTC,Stealth Device makes Soontir Fel nigh unhittable because of how well it synegizes with Autothrusters.  Targeting Computer makes him a true offensive threat because it synegizes so well with his pilot ability when you don't need your second action to reposition.  Shield upgrade protects him from enemy Darth Vader (crew).  Hull upgrade if you can't spare the point.

XWingTMG,3die54,AffixBayonets,2,Fri Jul 17 14:54:48 2015 UTC,"I've been trying to move away from the standard issue Soontir centric Interceptor list.  To that end, I've been having a lot of fun with Turr Phennir. He can dodge arcs like crazy with PtL but requires a different approach than Soontir, and can't quite turtle like he can obviously.  Turr can charge directly at the frontal arc of an enemy and focus, getting as close as possible and, so long as he has the higher PS, take his range 1 shot, then immediately barrel roll followed by a boost to carry him out of the return fire arc, taking a stress only after the third action that turn thanks to PtL.  It rustles jimmies every time I do it. Great fun.  I've also had a good amount of luck running the ol standby Royal Guards, but I admit I don't have much playtime with the other named pilots like Fel's Wrath or Lt. Lorrir.  Lorrir's ability in particular feels VERY situational, and often not worth taking a stress for."
XWingTMG,3die54,Tvayumat,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:02:41 2015 UTC,I haven't used Lorrir and his ability looks terrible on paper. He has no EPT slot which means no PtL and an Interceptor without that ability that is also more expensive than an RGP is a hard sell.
XWingTMG,3die54,ernesto__-,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:13:30 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that more or less mirrors my feeling on the matter, but on some level I feel like I need to give him a chance on the table before I shuffle him to the bottom of the pilot cards forever."
XWingTMG,3die54,Nomnomnicon,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:15:01 2015 UTC,"I have only played against interceptors, and even still only soontir. However, from what I have seen, and played, I think it's safe to say they are quite good when flown right. Their stat line is fitting,  with 3 red and 3 green. Although some complain about the 3 hull, it is understandable considering it is a TIE, and unlike other TIE variations it sacrifices health for attack and elusiveness. As we all know soontir fel is an animal, dodging arcs and taking names. I absolutely hate playing him when I have lower pilot skills. The minute I think I have him for sure he slips away like the devil he is. As for modifications on the glass cannons always auto thruster, then I see that people choose between stealth device and targeting computer. I am partial to TC because that doesn't go away when you take a fluke hit. All in all, the TIE interceptor is a great imperial ship that is extremely unforgiving to poor piloting, but can be incredibly rewarding when flown well."
XWingTMG,3die54,fl1p_problems,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:46:37 2015 UTC,"The Stat line for the Interceptor is perfectly representative of the ship - dangerous, mobile but delicate if actually hit. The cost is representative of that - you're buying a glass cannon, so while you pay for the extra damage and mobility it is still relatively cheap.   Autothrusters give them a very tangible survival improvement, especially in the situations they will often be engaged in - against turrets or long range. There are several others, but few give them any hard HP improvements - and taking a hull/shield upgrade is almost a waste of the slot, due to the versatility of the various upgrades availabile to it. Fortunately the Royal Guard Title allows you to mix and match a little if you invest in a more expensive Interceptor.   My favourite TIE-I pilot is either the Alpha, for cheap yet mobile firepower, or Turr Phenir. Turr is great for sneaking past lower PS pilots with his ability, or maintaining a pursuit on any target. There's been a lot of praise for Soontir already so I will avoid repetition.   Often used as escorts for a larger ship, they are versatile, dangerous and agile but suffer from bad luck rolls for defense - getting caught in an unfortunate place, or without actions, can be the end of a TIE-I's dazzling career."
XWingTMG,3dksl3,Snack_Happy,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:58:40 2015 UTC,If you have another firespray the imperial base pilot only costs 33 so you can fit 3 and thats a pretty good list. I am just thinking that against a swarm that 3 firesprays would be better than 2 upgraded ones.   If you sick with 2 madalorian mercs: I would think about replacing the hotshot blaster with inertial dampeners (1 point) and then add on siesmic charges (2 points) You have engine upgrade to use to get into firing position and your pilot skill of 5 means you will move after most generic pilots so the hot shot blaster might be over kill. The seismic charges should help you deal with swarms which I assume alot of people will use.  I aint no expert but just some thoughts.
XWingTMG,3dksl3,Sea_horse_,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:43:12 2015 UTC,I like that. My two games I tested this list the hotshot has been very lame. A few times though that inertial damper would have been nice.
XWingTMG,3dksl3,Sea_horse_,1 point,Fri Jul 17 04:01:53 2015 UTC,the K4 security droid would also be a great replacement for hot shot blaster I almost forgot about that. That way you can do a green then boost and still have that target lock to boost your attack.

Basically, Nera was there to stop Fel from being Fel.  Another guy runs Nera similarly with Ten Numb, Calculation, and an ion cannon. Between the two of them, ion and stress can cause lots of problems."
XWingTMG,3djgy6,ChopperStopper,3,Thu Jul 16 20:43:33 2015 UTC,"a friend ran a hilareous set up with Nera, predator, fletchette torpedo, gunner and muntions failsafe. He'd use predator to re-roll hits with the fletchette torpedo, ensuring it never hit, would still get to shoot with gunner, and thus could just hand out stress all game.   Waaay too expensive to be practical, but pretty funny."
XWingTMG,3djgy6,theblackthorne,2,Fri Jul 17 12:22:38 2015 UTC,Wouldn't it be better to just run her with a flechette cannon in this case and use the torp slot for something harder hitting.
XWingTMG,3djgy6,EdgeOfDreams,3,Thu Jul 16 20:50:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but the flechette cannon can't fire 360. The value of the flechette torps on Nera is that they can be used against an arc dodger no matter what side you he's on."
XWingTMG,3djgy6,ChopperStopper,2,Thu Jul 16 20:51:35 2015 UTC,"Plus, the cannon won't stress if they're already stressed. I've flown against it a couple of times and have had to make the choice between taking a hit and him losing out on a source of stress or staying intact for another turn."
XWingTMG,3djgy6,Cintesis,2,Thu Jul 16 20:56:51 2015 UTC,"Fair point. I actually forgot that.  So Nera  deadeye, advanced sensors plus flechette torps an extra munitions and a munitions fail safe. And aim to miss so that you keep the torps for as long as possible."
XWingTMG,3djgy6,EdgeOfDreams,2,Thu Jul 16 21:07:37 2015 UTC,"Seems like an effective combo to me, but for 37pts, it's a little too unmanoeuvrable for my liking.  Edit: She shoots 360. Totally worth it."
XWingTMG,3djgy6,KorlithZaan,2,Thu Jul 16 20:01:29 2015 UTC,"I like. Nera with Deadeye, B-Wing/E2, Recon Specialist, and Extra Munitions comes out to 33 points. Then it's a choice of torpedoes. I like Plasma for the low cost, range, 4 dice, and anti-shield effect for taking down the likes of Fat Han, or Advanced Proton Torpedoes for punching through the defense dice and tokens of someone like Soontir Fel.  Advanced Sensors could also be a good idea to help prevent her from being blocked and losing her chance to fire her torpedoes.  The real question is what to fly her with. I think Nera works best as a flanker, so the rest of your squad needs to be either Fat Han, Super Dash, or something that can joust well, so that there's a threat other than Nera on the board to draw attention away from her."

XWingTMG,3djbq5,Dyrethna,5,Thu Jul 16 20:36:32 2015 UTC,"Getting tired of explaining this over and over.  If you're using the BTL title with the BTL, that's 3 attacks.  Without, that's 2 attacks.  Horton has no need of Target Locks with the TLT thanks to his abilty, but he DOES need focus, and he can only independently generate 1 token to use for 2 attacks, so one will also go unfocussed.  Marksmanship applies to ALL attacks made that round, so one action will modify both or all 3 of his shots.  Sure the crits are wasted, but you get a sharpshooter with an almost undodgeable 2 damage per turn."

XWingTMG,3dhuoy,mxzf,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:16:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you're right.  But there are a bunch of other ships and a couple board games I also want, so the most sensible course of action is to wait 'till I can comfortably afford a $100 order on MM and then just buy it all together."
XWingTMG,3dhuoy,X-factor103,2,Thu Jul 16 14:52:56 2015 UTC,"This is how I'd buy my board games in the past as well. Get the best deal on the price, and wait till you can hit free shipping.  Just depends what you need, I suppose. I've got a list, but my wallet's a bit tight at this time."

XWingTMG,3dhuoy,Th3GingerHitman,2,Thu Jul 16 15:40:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's the problem though. TIE Advanced with 2 day shipping is only 2 more dollars on Amazon."
XWingTMG,3dl4pl,renegadejibjib,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:48:56 2015 UTC,"A two-ship build can definitely work. Most commonly, people use either two large ships or a large ship and a small ship, partly because large ships have so much more health than small ones.  FFG does not sell upgrades separately from ships at all. You can, however, buy upgrade cards on eBay or from a few game stores like teamcovenant.com. The problem is, for what you end up paying for some of the best upgrade cards, you end up spending close to what you'd spend on the ship they come with anyway. Fortunately, many of the best upgrades now come as a pair in a single expansion pack. For example, you get two Autothrusters in each Star Viper pack, and not many builds need more than just those two copies anyway (triple interceptor being a notable exception).  Instead of buying extra ships to get more copies of cards, though, you can either proxy cards for casual play or get to know some other players and borrow cards from them.  For epic play, I've definitely played it and seen other people play it, but it's far less common than standard play. The Raider should help with that, of course, since we'll finally have a Huge ship on both sides of a Rebel v Imperial Epic match. The problem is that epic play isn't really supported by tournaments, so there's not much incentive for the most competitive players to spend time building squads. The balance of the game also gets a bit screwy in epic, because of how the effect of focused fire and support abilities can multiply. For example, I recently played an epic game against a guy who used Roark Garnet to boost his Tantive IV to PS 12 and shoot me with its full battery of guns at the start of every combat phase, often killing a ship before I could return fire."
XWingTMG,3dl4pl,EdgeOfDreams,1 point,Fri Jul 17 04:02:54 2015 UTC,"epic play is pretty much casual only as the time requirement to play increases exponentially with each ship you add.  I've played a 2v2 200 points per side game that came down to the last 2 ships, and lasted 4 hours.  epic can really be fun and my group doesn't play all that often, but we all love it when we can schedule a time.  the 4 of us in our group collectively have over 150 ships plus the epics."
XWingTMG,3dl4pl,Theepum7,1 point,Fri Jul 17 04:52:42 2015 UTC,This builder has a bunch of saved lists and you can sort by various criteria including points spent. Looks to have a few large point builds in there: http://xwing-builder.co.uk/list#minPoints=101

Soontir Fel + Autothrusters + Push The Limit is pretty amazing.  I'd fly Slave 1, loaded up however you feel like, Soontir Fel, and some number of TIE Fighters to fill in the leftover points. Your strategy with this sort of list would be to group up Slave 1 and the TIE Fighters on one part of the board, preferably a corner without a lot of nearby asteroids. Then place Fel at least a foot away from them. Fly the main group as directly toward the enemy as you can (though avoid routes through tightly clustered asteroids), while Fel circles around or zooms forward to come in from the back or side of your opponents."
XWingTMG,3di3xk,mechabeast,3,Thu Jul 16 13:30:15 2015 UTC,"With the built-in Barrel roll and a decent maneuverability, TIE Advanced can nearly count als arcdodgers. Very beefy arcdodgers at that. This is even more emphazised with Juno Eclipse, who can change her dial after revealing.  I don't quite see the need to stay at range 2, to be honest. With the generics it's fair game, but if you put PTL on any of the named pilots and maybe additionally an Engine Upgrade, you're looking at the maneuverability of a TIE Interceptor, or at least nearly that, with the Shielding of a X-Wing.  In fact, Juno might not even need PTL as her ability grants her huge amounts of flexibility. One Action might already be enough, especially if you choose to go VI instead. With a PS of 10 you are all but guaranteed to move last. Vader already has 2 actions anyways as well.  AC might be cool on the generics, I don't see it on Juno / Vader / Strom / Steele."

XWingTMG,3di3xk,branniganbginagain,3,Thu Jul 16 15:32:44 2015 UTC,"before the new pilots were spoiled, the consensus was that Vader and Maarek would use the ATC (Marek's ability is pretty much useless with AC)  and the generics would use AC.    the new pilots there is some debate.   This article is written towards ""uses for AC on the advanced"" rather than ""best sensors on the advanced"".      Juno - could use either, high PS helps to lean towards ATC , but her ability allows her to stay at range 2, which is optimal for AC.    Colzet - AC is a decent choice, but I think FCS may be better.  Alozen - ATC.  free target lock at range 1.   little use with AC.    The article has a nice use for him, his free target locks would help out Col. Vessery.   Keep his target lock on, and use AC to keep his damage levels up.     Zertik Strom - I could see both.  AC allows you to use Barrel Roll to get into range 1, or take an evade.  ATC makes him scarier at Range 1."

XWingTMG,3dkc04,yodaaz,7,Thu Jul 16 23:33:21 2015 UTC,"No, I don't think so. Too many players already own a Falcon or two, and it's far cheaper for FFG to just keep printing the one that already exists. We're much more likely to get Episode 7 TIE Fighters and X-Wings with alternate paint schemes and new pilots and/or upgrades, especially since those are ships you can fly 3+ of in one list.  I think if there's a new Falcon pilot or two in the movie, then the most likely way we'll see them published is as part of an Episode 7 Core Set, which would contain an X-Wing and two TIE Fighters in their movie paint schemes, along with new pilot cards for other ships, similar to how Most Wanted came with pilot cards for Slave 1 and the HWK."

XWingTMG,3di320,Petunia2t,3,Thu Jul 16 13:22:00 2015 UTC,"As they aren't released there is no ""market rate"". Prices will be based on supply and demand like anything else. If the market is flooded with people splitting Raiders the price will drop as people start to undercut each other. Best thing you can do is list them for what you want, and see what others are doing."
XWingTMG,3di320,Zombane,2,Thu Jul 16 14:04:21 2015 UTC,"I would wager you have no chance at recovering half the cost of a Raider. If you packaged the Advanced and every Advanced-related item in the box, you might get a quarter of full retail ($25).

XWingTMG,3di320,MisterLamp,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:02:49 2015 UTC,The wild-card will be under-cutters on eBay. I will be posting my 2nd Raider's cards (I want 2 blue Advanced Models) at $10 each (Palpy $20) in hopes that some people will only need 1 or 2 of these and the only worry is a huge amount of under-cutting.
XWingTMG,3di320,leewardstyle,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:55:05 2015 UTC,By this valuation I can sell everything except the Raider stuff out of a Raider box and earn more than the raider costs at full retail.  4x X1: $40 4x ATC: $40 Palpatine: $20 and then the Advanced itself.
XWingTMG,3di320,sacimino40,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:32:59 2015 UTC,"Engine Upgrade can fetch 10-12$ on eBay. 3p0 30-40$. With the hype behind these new RAIDER cards, you'd be unwise to start the bidding at less than $10 per card. Just saying."
XWingTMG,3di320,leewardstyle,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:52:40 2015 UTC,"its because those cards are POPULAR. Engine Upgrade only comes in the falcon, which was in reprint. 3p0 is a $90 card since no one uses the corvette. This is the reason these cards are so expensive, not just because. If these cards are popular and the meta is affected by them, sure sell em for $10-$20 a pop. Otherwise that price is ludicrous as many cards sell for $2 or $3 bucks."
XWingTMG,3di320,sacimino40,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:30:15 2015 UTC,"The amount of ludicrous is solely dependent on the observer. Better to overprice them than underprice them. If you can drop cheddar on 2-3 Raiders, you aren't worried about some failed auctions. But from the amount of eBay action for XWING (repaints going for $120), I'm going to say many people wont mind dropping $10 per upgrade and might actually only need 1 or 2."
XWingTMG,3di320,leewardstyle,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:40:37 2015 UTC,"So you're saying that if the TIE Advanced and upgrade cards came out on its own, it would be worth $120. Thats $20-$30 MORE than the price of the entire Raider. The fact that there are four of each card in the pack will actually LOWER the price. There is one 3PO in the Tantive. Thats why it sells for $30-$40. Engine was in reprint, thats why it sold for ~$10. The truth is, until we know the impact of the card, $10 is severely overpriced."
XWingTMG,3di320,Aanar,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:07:04 2015 UTC,"custom repaints can fetch $120, not the packaged repaints. proof that many ppl are dropping much cheddar on the aftermarket.  All I am saying is that overpricing is the way to go. Too many people, with money/means, refusing to buy The Raider. Their loss. If they only want (1) X1 and (1) ATC, they had better drop $20... and they probably will. I will sell my extras, either overpriced -or- (later) if no1 buys and I downsample naturally."
XWingTMG,3di320,Blackxp,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:37:20 2015 UTC,"It's probably pretty hard to say.  If the meta shifts to include those cards in builds, they could end up like C3PO being $40 last I checked.  If that's the case, you'll want to wait a bit since you could probably get more for them later.  But if after trying them out the cards are largely ignored, then they probably won't be worth much.  If that's the case, you're best bet is to sell them off as fast as you can.    The other factor is if card proxies are accepted in your casual games.  If so, people will just try the cards out w/o buying them (until they want them for a tournament)."
XWingTMG,3di320,leewardstyle,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:24:08 2015 UTC,"I'd imagine if you get a raider for $68 (Saw that on MM) and sold the cards/ship that you could easily make it back. Assuming the cards are competitive and in demand, this is the only way to obtain them. C3PO ($35) + R2D2 (crew) (forget price) together sell for about the price of the tantive (assuming you got the Tantive for around $55). This is how people on eBay make money. They buy Falcons and Firesprays and resell them without upgrade cards, then sell the upgrade cards individually. If Veteran Instincts is nearly $10 then the set of these tie advance cards could easily break $50 or $60. Honestly though, I'd say just keep them. Who knows, you might regret it. It might be fun to try out the new tie advance!"
XWingTMG,3di320,loldrowning,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:39:04 2015 UTC,"The ""Blue Advanced Model"" is also valued by many diehards.

Wedge - R2 Astromech, Push the Limit, Engine Upgrade - 37 points  Luke - R2-D2, Draw Their Fire - 33 points  Biggs - R4-D6, Hull Upgrade - 29 points  Comes to 99.  With all of the HLCs on IGs out there, the thought is that Biggs can stay alive for 3 shots with Luke pulling crits and R4-D6.  Wedge gets focus+target lock on his target every turn, and drops the hammer."

XWingTMG,3djut6,Teirdome,2,Thu Jul 16 21:59:41 2015 UTC,"Tough to say.  You could upgrade the Hull on Biggs to a shield, or even move the shield over to Luke so R2-D2 has more of a buffer.  Spending it on a 1 point initiative bid isn't a bad idea either.  It helps Wedge hunt other arc dodgers a little better."
XWingTMG,3djut6,Blackxp,2,Thu Jul 16 22:32:31 2015 UTC,"I definitely think so. At the very least it would be a ton of fun to play. Have Luke be aggressive, but with his ability it should be enough to keep him alive on his own. Throw Biggs and Wedge together and do some sort of Wingman thing with the two of them. Biggs tanky and Wedge a glass canon of epic proportions.  I always play casually so there is nothing that would prevent me from playing it. Not sure if you could win tournaments with it, but as long as your casual meta is relaxed then it should be a fun game."
XWingTMG,3djut6,rsixidor,2,Thu Jul 16 21:26:31 2015 UTC,One of the regionals had a list perform well with DTF and R2-D2 on Wedge run alongside Biggs. Don't remember the rest of the list.
XWingTMG,3djut6,PCGamerPirate,2,Thu Jul 16 21:30:38 2015 UTC,"Back in the day, Wedge, Biggs, Luke was able to make it to the US Nationals Final table before getting dusted by a TIE Swarm.  Trench Run builds have to be designed to protect Wedge as long as possible and make Luke your end game ship with no one at higher PS than him.  These days, I think Lone Wolf Luke with R2-D2 or R5-P9 is probably a good staple.  I like to keep Biggs bare bones.  Wedge could use engine and predator. While lone wolf is a nice defensive card, I think it is more beneficial for Wedge to be able to save his focus for defense or be able to boost without losing offensive efficacy. PtL combined with R2-D2 and Engine is another good combo.  You can't do it all, so pick one configuration that looks appealing and try it out!"
XWingTMG,3djut6,T-Minus9,2,Thu Jul 16 22:53:30 2015 UTC,"What about this for fun:   Wedge w/ Predator & R2-D2 (36pts) Luke w/ DTF & R5-P9 (32pts) Biggs w/ R5-D8 & HU (31pts)   99 Pts  Luke keeps his focus for his droid (gets a natural soft focus on def so that's not bad), and he can take some heat off Biggs with DTf, letting Biggs use his action to dump damage once his shields are gone to keep him around a little longer.  This is nice because Luke is still able to back up Wedge once Biggs is gone, and they can both regen shields easily without compromising Wedge's offense.  -OR-  Take R2-F2 and SD with Biggs and Squad Leader with Luke to pass Biggs the focus he can't take himself.  This will keep him around a little longer as well, but puts a lot of faith in green dice, and once Biggs is gone, Luke can't support Wedge with SL.  Just 2 more options."
XWingTMG,3dix7b,sleet01,4,Thu Jul 16 17:16:38 2015 UTC,"I feel like VI is a must. I'd go  Echo(30) - VI(1) - Fire Control System (2) - ACD(4) - Rebel Captive(3)  Also, have you considered PTL instead of outmaneuver? I feel like it would up your survivability in a list with such little health."
XWingTMG,3dix7b,sacimino40,2,Thu Jul 16 17:26:37 2015 UTC,"I agree with this list. VI and ACD are basically required, which leaves us with 5 points to play with. Sensors and FCS are the only system upgrades worth considering, which leaves us with three options in my opinion:  Gunner/No system: can rule this one out fairly easily because Gunner without FCS lacks the punch we'd want.  Adv. Sensors/2 pt. crew: Probably Tactician here. This option is good but you want to evade so often with the Phantom that sensors underperforms.  FCS/3 pt. crew: Captive is the best option here, since it punishes high PS attackers of the Phantom, which synergizes well with ACD. I think this is the best version.  Also agree on PTL."
XWingTMG,3dix7b,gammon9,2,Thu Jul 16 18:22:16 2015 UTC,"I'm fond of Veteran Instincts and Fire Control System on Echo and Whisper. The biggest threat to them is other high-PS arc dodgers and high-PS turrets. VI helps with the PS issue, and FCS helps you punch through the high agility of targets like Soontir Fel. For your remaining few points, Rebel Captive or Tactician (with a 1 point initiative bid) are worth considering."
XWingTMG,3dix7b,EdgeOfDreams,2,Thu Jul 16 17:28:14 2015 UTC,"Lots of well-reasoned suggestions, so it looks like I'll be trying out:  ""Echo"" (30)40     Veteran Instincts (1)     Rebel Captive (3)     Fire Control System (2)     Advanced Cloaking Device (4)   Regarding PTL, I hadn't really considered it.  I mainly wanted an action-less accuracy/damage booster for the INTs, which Outmaneuver provides as long as I can dodge arcs, but I can certainly see the potential benefits of Push The Limit.  There have been numerous occasions where I've had Barrel Roll or Boost into Outmaneuver position, and then really missed having a Focus or Evade.  I'll keep it in mind."

I've had success with both - I want to try Sensor Jammer on day as I love it, but it's quite pricey.  Echo's lower PS means that VI still puts her behind the heavy hitters, and without an intiative bid you may still be losing out vs 8's. For this reason I experiment a bit more with her build, whereas Whisper gets PS 9 and so I use him for simple damage."

I think Soontir would be a better choice personally. Now if you were trying to stick Carnor into range 1 and fire something like an HLC at Range with Boba I can see what you are trying to do. But as is Carnor + Autoblaster doesn't synergize.
XWingTMG,3dipnx,sacimino40,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:09:27 2015 UTC,"Unless I'm very mistaken, autoblaster does not ignore tokens on its own."

XWingTMG,3dipnx,mikodz,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:27:19 2015 UTC,"Ok, I did some checking and now I realize that evade tokens 'add' an evade to the 'dice results' and as such carnor jax is not needed to boost the autoblaster's effectiveness."

XWingTMG,3dhads,Blackxp,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:23:30 2015 UTC,How are you getting to 175?  I get 157 in one that sort of makes sense.  Can push it to 160 if you use slicer tools even though it doesn't have the jam action.  My loadout: CR90 Corvette (Aft) + Single Turbolasers + Shield Projector + Raymus Antilles (58) CR90 Corvette (Fore) + Tantive IV + Single Turbolasers + Single Turbolasers + Sensor Team + Gunnery Team + Ionization Reactor + Luke Skywalker + Toryn Farr + Engineering Team (99) There's an extra team slot but the three of them are listed as unique on the squad builder.  I don't believe there are any valid modifications for the CR-90.  I was able to get the Raider up to 155 in the squad builder without a title (not sure what they are yet) so that might be able to go over.
XWingTMG,3dfj7j,fl1p_problems,2,Wed Jul 15 21:37:39 2015 UTC,Love it.  I know what I am doing soon.
XWingTMG,3dfj7j,cassarlex,2,Wed Jul 15 21:57:51 2015 UTC,"Okay, so this involves taking a drill to your miniatures. Ready?  Okay. Start with ripping of the standard stud. If you did it right, you will find a hole in the bottom of your miniature.  If you brake the stud off, the little peg will be stuck.  In both cases, take a small drill bit (2mm or so) and round out the hole, or drill the stud out.  Next, increase the diameter of the drill bit and repeat until you have reached the diameter of your ring magnet. In my case this was 4mm. I used 2mm, 3mm, 3.5mm and 4mm drills. With the big bases I used 4mm, 5mm, 6mm, 7mm, 7.5mm and 8mm.  Go slow. Have a steady hand, grip the miniature tight with one hand. Rest the drill on a surface to steady everything up.  Go slow.  After you drilled, just superglue the magnets in there.  Now for the pegs.  The big ones use 7mm steel balls, the small ones 3mm steel balls. For heavy miniatures, the small steel balls will not have enough friction. I just glued a second ring magnet to some of the pegs, to stabilize.  I roughed the steelballs up with 120 grit sandpaper, to give them more grip. Without this, the miniatures would slip around and just hang off the peg.  I like the result, as it gives a very clean look on the miniature. You can even paint over the magnet, to make it nearly invisible."

I'd use magnets between 1/6"" and 3/16"" in size on the small ships. (You'll need a drill bit of the same size though.) The balls are a little smaller than the magnets in diameter, so they fit better into the holes."
XWingTMG,3diyuc,pie904,2,Thu Jul 16 17:28:30 2015 UTC,"Swarm fighting theory has taken a backseat because you simply are not as likely to fight swarms in a competitive setting. It is not a priority.  That being said there is a TON of swarm theory out there because they dominated until wave 4 (and even a little into it).  It starts with asteroid placement. You cannot allow a swarm to exist as a perfect formation. You cannot give a swarm a clean lane to move through. You cannot joust the swarm.  In order to beat a swarm, you have to leverage all the abilities you paid for by not bringing a swarm.  One of which is pilot skill, by having higher pilot skill, you know where the swarm sets up. Never set up across from it.  The next is arc dodging prowess. The swarm has to break up to catch you. What you need to ensure is that it is Soontir Fel vs an about equal number of points worth of ships. The goal is to protect Soontir Fel long enough that he only has to fight 1 ship. Flying Soontir Fel takes an incredible patience to know when you should dive in and when you should run. A good swarm player will catch you doing the wrong one and there's nothing you can do except hope your dice hold out.  Finally, make that Darth Vader crew count. This is tricky because you need to make sure your Shuttle gets shots but also make sure you don't go too fast and have the shuttle out of the fight in one turn. Luckily, your control Kath can help prevent the entire swarm from k-turning behind you."

Give it a heavy laser cannon and a way to reroll attack dice and watch the fireworks. They are overcosted by a few points, but the white K-turn can make it up. The cognitive dissonance inspired in your opponents, vacillating between cocksure and terrified, will be hilarious: ""It's just a defender, who cares. Oh my god, it's a defender, I'm dead."""
XWingTMG,3dgo66,Nomnomnicon,4,Thu Jul 16 05:53:29 2015 UTC,"Great ship, but expensive. For a decently kitted one you can almost get two TIE-I's; for a fully kitted Rexlar, you can basically get two good TIE-I's.   Is it too expensive? No. For the generic, it's still a tough weapons platfrom that can go point-for-point quite well with other ships. The White K-Turn is a magnificent tool, makes it hard to stay on your tail. My best tip for new Defender pilots is get Rexlar with Predator, and always focus.   It's not fast, it's not cheap, but it's possibly the toughest small ship out there, kicks out damage, and can still dance quite well.   My full build Rexlar: HLC, EU, Ion Missiles, Predator. Will definitely add the TIE-2 title.  Spits damage, can take some hits. Importantly the Predator re-roll can crit with the HLC."

XWingTMG,3dgo66,renegadejibjib,3,Thu Jul 16 13:26:13 2015 UTC,"The miniature is fantastic. Love the model.  As a ship, I feel like it should be cheaper than it is. It can be very hard to kill if outfitted properly, but a 'proper' loadout is extremely expensive."
XWingTMG,3dgo66,Stetto,3,Thu Jul 16 05:43:52 2015 UTC,"I don't know, if I like Twin Ion Engines Mk. II on the Defender, yet. Push the Limit feels kind of moot, if you have neither Boost nor green 2-Turn available.  I love flying them with Engine Upgrade for long range hit and run action."
XWingTMG,3dgo66,Shgrizz,3,Thu Jul 16 08:16:38 2015 UTC,"The thing I learned the hard way in my first defender game- DON'T stress them, especially if you are near a board edge. I made the mistake of pulling a hard 1 to try and gun down an enemy ship, and paid for it over the next 3 turns of white banking, unable to squeeze in a 4k or a hard 3. Mk.2 should be an invaluable tool for them, giving them a few decent de-stressing options. At the moment, a stressed defender is very restrictive."
XWingTMG,3dgo66,Thopterthallid,2,Thu Jul 16 08:55:54 2015 UTC,Favorite ship. I own 3.  I flew three Deltas with Ions a couple nights ago and rekt.  Needs more pilots though...
XWingTMG,3dgo66,Shgrizz,2,Thu Jul 16 08:31:28 2015 UTC,"I agree, we need another pilot. Vessery is great, but Brath is extremely temperamental and doesn't work without someone to back up his ability. I have a list which essentially runs a decimator with fleet officer as a 50+ pt support ship. Gotta push those crits."
XWingTMG,3dgo66,MacAtck,2,Thu Jul 16 08:51:51 2015 UTC,"This is a list I've been messing with as well. Trickier to fly than you'd think in order to keep them in range for fleet without crashing into something.   But man, when it works, it REALLY works"
XWingTMG,3dgo66,Shgrizz,2,Thu Jul 16 14:44:36 2015 UTC,"Thought I might update you on how I found the list. I flew it twice, the first being a bit non applicable as the decimator getting ion'd off the board after only attacking once. Mostly my fault, but you live and learn.   The second game, I did a little better against a nasty XXDash list. I managed to push through a couple of great crits on dash, but didn't have the sustained fire to take him down before wedge and the other x took me apart. Not helped by the fact that it's just not practical to keep the defender at range 2 of the deci when the deci is stressing himself every turn to provide focus, and the defender's main strength is his k turns. Eventually it was just wedge and the deci, so not a disaster, but I think I'll stick to the more straightforward synergies with vessery for now. That is, until I fight a 0 agility ship and get to push 4 crits in one attack. A man can dream. Sorry for the essay, just thought you might be interested!"

XWingTMG,3dgo66,Shgrizz,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:23:37 2015 UTC,"That looks great. I might have to go for weapons engineer instead of APL and tactician, just because of the added flexibility with actions it gives you. And in my group, at least, there is no meta. I don't give a crap about what people are doing in the tournaments, and for some reason, X and E wings are dominant. People complain about the meta without even bothering to try different things themselves."
XWingTMG,3dgo66,MacAtck,1 point,Fri Jul 17 08:47:54 2015 UTC,"That's true, and man E-wing (esp Corran) really are SUPER popular. Corran w/ R2 is one thing I'm trying to counter. If it comes down to, for instance, Corran v Deci, he has a tendency to run and recharge before double tapping you, rinse and repeat. Tough tactic to beat."
XWingTMG,3dgo66,Shgrizz,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:51:09 2015 UTC,"Yea, that is a tactic I came across personally the first time I ran fat chiraneau. Man, I must have killed Corran three times over if it wasn't for his regenerating Shields. The game went on for almost two hours before we just decided to call it- the only way I was going to win was if he managed to fly within range 1 of the deci and I got all hits vs no evades. Otherwise, he'd just stay on the other side before he felt like coming around for another pop. Aggravating, but legit. You live and learn - next time, kill r2d2 first!   The good thing about casual play though, is that you don't have to run a tournament-style 'take all comers' list. You try something that looks fun, see what it does well and what it fails at, and if there's an enemy list giving you trouble, you ask them to run it again with a new counter. Hence why X wings do so well in my group... They're just not particularly bad at anything!"
XWingTMG,3dgo66,Shgrizz,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:06:22 2015 UTC,"I'm trying the list out tonight. In theory, it will help that RAC and Brath are the same PS, so you've got the choice of the defender's starting or finishing position to get the deci into range 1-2 and give the focus. It should be great, but will take some concentration. Wish me luck!"
XWingTMG,3dgo66,bl1y,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:51:47 2015 UTC,Brath needs to be paired with a Fleet Officer. Brath and RAC w/Officer can lay out some very nasty crits.

White K-turn. awesome miniature. toughest stat line on a small ship. overpriced. :-/   It's not that they are simply too expensive. The modifications you can put on it are very restrictive, which means you have a hard time kitting it out for offense and defense. No boost means no Autothrusters, engine upgrade messes up your action economy (especially for rexler) and the lack of greens means not many ways to shed stress."
XWingTMG,3dgo66,leewardstyle,1 point,Thu Jul 16 11:42:23 2015 UTC,"Tip: Set up with a 5-10 degree bias / slant in relation to your opponent. This does two things: Gives you a lead in banking/rolling away from ARC; -and- 5-10 degree attack-line-bias swings your white K-Turn ARC slightly left or right of attack-line which means your ARC, post K-Turn, will trail a bit and you might have a shot as they reset the Joust."

Still, very strong on such a big ship as long as Palob can keep up. Twin Ion cannons work nicely, especially at the bottom of the round, but I'd lose the BTL upgrade - you need the control more than you need the shots from the Y. I think.

I like the SoT/Outlaw tech combo, but without a way to consistently clear stress I think your going to have issues constantly bouncing between red and green maneuvers. Maybe switch Palob to Wingman. Another popular choice has been grabbing opportunist on Palob. He already is stealing a token, so most days of the week, he can pick on someone fairly easily. (+1 dice to ion turret or some other turret can get devastating fast)  Edit. When in doubt, Tansarii Point veterans are cheap Elite slots"

You can't guarantee you'll have Dark Curse and Vessery pointed at the same targets, and with two target locks out at any one point you have far more versatility and should be able to hit hard more frequently. Out maneuver will help with this, especially as you'll be using the 4k a lot."

XWingTMG,3ddyo6,reverendmalerik,5,Wed Jul 15 14:59:41 2015 UTC,I'm going to say yes.  But mainly for mines.  If you're really good at predicting opponent's movements you might do okay with bombs as well but it's much easier to get mines in front of ships that move after you do.
XWingTMG,3ddyo6,rsixidor,3,Wed Jul 15 15:05:16 2015 UTC,"I think you may be right. The more I look at that 22 point scimitar, the more I see a horrifying ship killer. Turning in front of a big ship and dropping six dice on them. Heck, take three points of ion pulse missiles and they'd be horrifying."
XWingTMG,3ddyo6,PCGamerPirate,3,Wed Jul 15 18:11:54 2015 UTC,"I've found more and more that my bombers are loosing their teeth before they can finish a fight rather than they get dusted with missiles on board. The 2 agility and 6 hull makes them surprisingly tanky against all but the heaviest of hitters (phantoms, HLCs, etc.)  Punishers also cost 5 more points and have a worse dial. They trade in an agility die for 3 shields. The loss of certain maneuvers and those extra points spent just to field them makes choosing between punishers and bombers a more difficult choice.  When it comes to named pilots, Rhymer is far and away the worst pilot of the bunch due to his paying so much for that skill. Advanced Homing Missiles may give him life like Mangler did for Ten Numb but ultimately, I think he will continue to sit on the bench."
XWingTMG,3ddyo6,skyshroudace,3,Wed Jul 15 15:06:51 2015 UTC,"I think the problem is the idea of having dedicated ""bombers."" I have found that taking a reasonable build and tacking on a few bombs makes them just more formidable and dangerous should you get out maneuvered. The decorator is a perfect example of this very powerful on its own, but throw a mine on top of that and it can deal out of heavy damage in 1 turn."
XWingTMG,3ddyo6,leewardstyle,2,Wed Jul 15 15:07:58 2015 UTC,"I've long accepted that Bombers/Missile-Boats might never be Tier 1 in Tourney Standings. It's a problem of power-creep... If you make Bombers/Missile-Boats Tier 1 out of the gate (and not based on syngery/combos later), you effectively push many ships out of Tier 1.   As it looks from these Wave VII spoilers, Bombers will not be Tier 1 in Tourney Top-8(s), but instead, will force all current Tier 1 ships (Interceptor, YT-1300, B-Wing, etc.) to play ""Smarter."" No longer will some of these lists fly straight and Joust/Arc-Dodge easily. It will be much easier to ""Make them turn."" Or at least, force them to overthink ""the turn."""

XWingTMG,3ddyo6,ScoutManDan,2,Wed Jul 15 15:51:55 2015 UTC,"I have high hopes for the Punisher given a peek of Deathrain, who will be able to dump mines out the front, instead of behind.   I'm envisioning using him like a ram, where I ram him in base contact with a Falcon and drop bombs out front, which will hit before the Falcon can even move, never mind shoot- having a lower pilot skill and moving first means I don't even have to predict their move, which I could even guarantee is the case with Enhanced Scopes.  With cluster mines loaded that's six attack dice against 0 defense, plus a free barrel roll to dump me somewhere useful after."
XWingTMG,3ddyo6,ScoutManDan,3,Wed Jul 15 16:41:28 2015 UTC,"If you don't quite make contact you could be a real git about it. Drop the bombs into the ship, barrel roll sideways and forwards a bit in front of the ship, on their move they maybe smack into you, can't shoot you and lose their action! Maybe."

XWingTMG,3ddyo6,ScoutManDan,2,Wed Jul 15 19:29:46 2015 UTC,"The problem with ramming into base contact is then you lose your action, so you can't drop Cluster or Proximity Mines. You need to leave a tiny amount of space between you to get your action."
XWingTMG,3ddyo6,RandomParable,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:45:32 2015 UTC,Absolutely. But the size of the 1 template plus the bomb is a good inch and a half so there's room to play.  Getting there in one piece of course...

XWingTMG,3ddyo6,specialmeats,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:48:21 2015 UTC,"Okay, but even dumping 6 dice into it with no evades possible, they only hit on ""hit"" rolls. As such, the average damage outcome is 2.25 per full cluster mine drop, and only if all 3 templates hit the ship.  Against something like Fat Han, it just doesn't seem that powerful to me?"
XWingTMG,3ddyo6,Theepum7,2,Thu Jul 16 04:03:09 2015 UTC,"I'm still suspicious of the Punisher (And the TIE/B for that matter) as a dedicated bombing machine, especially the generics. The dial is decent but the red hard 2's and lack of hard 1's on the Punisher & bomber put a maneuverability barrier between the generics and clutch bombing paths on the crucial targets you want to hit directly with bomb/mine/conner net templates, like the big turrets, arc dodgers, etc. Any decent pilot will see the bombing trajectory coming from across the board, given that a three straight is the fastest the Predator can move, and get out of the way turns before you can get close. The bomber is kind of in the same position with red hard 2's, but at least it has the white four straight and greens on 2 banks.   ""Deathrain"" is a different story of course, since it can put bombs out the front arc... But it's an elite, so of course good for bombing, and the cost reflects that. At that price, you might be better off with a more traditional dogfighter elite, however.  Extra munitions bombers with proximity mines might be good for messing up formations of swarms, as you can merrily just slow-roll across the map dropping huge templates for a couple turns, but why bother? A single Tie fighter can just as easily zip across the map and block the formation for 12 points. Yeah, a bomber crapping out mines can give a swarm a lot to worry about by making the asteroid field an even worse place to be, but by time they reach the middle of the map, the formation is likely already broken.  In that vein, I feel like the Punisher and Bomber generics are best suited as missile boats with extra munitions. Two assault missiles and FCS on a Punisher will give any swarm formation plenty of reason to back off. Two homing missiles (or four...) will more or less force interceptors, A-wings, and phantoms to arc dodge your bomber or wait it out, giving your other ships shots/time while the bomber is focused down by less fragile ships. I like the idea of a generic bomber or punisher as the third ship compliment to two elites, with a choice of missiles as fillers & control for the weak points in the list. Ions and clusters if you're worried about large ships, Assault missiles if you're worried about swarms. But of course, there's always the argument to be made that a dedicated missile ship isn't worth it when the Firespray, Defender, and Tie Advanced can take them anyway."

It is possible to fit 4x scimitar squads with extra munitions, prox mines and a 4 point torp or missile (such as clusters, into 100 points.  Each bomber has 2x clusters and 2x prox mines...

This phenomenon of other games becoming very popular and taking up ""their"" space has caused problems in a few stores.  The more responsible FLGSs try to arrange specific game nights with their customers. For instance, one of the more popular stores in my old city had a ""Star Wars"" night, for anything Star Warsey. Other stores brand themselves primarily on a few games, such as a bigger store that catered to the Warhammer/Warmachine crowd. This helps give people a place where they know they can get a table, or at the very least, interact with people who play the same game while watching it be played.  If I showed up at a store on Warhammer night and tried to get a game of Infinity going, then I'd expect to be politely informed that it's not appropriate at that time. If somebody decided to shove my minis aside because they're on ""his"" table instead of communicating like a human being, I'd be pretty pissed."

What baffles me is that there were two games of non-X-Wing going on, but they were taking up nearly a dozen tables.

Luckily, the store owner, who is a stand-up guy, stepped in to help de-escalate the situation."

XWingTMG,3deheg,Azzael,3,Wed Jul 15 17:16:13 2015 UTC,"If you have multiple ships with the same initiative, you can choose the order you want them to move each turn.    Technically revealing and moving each ship happens at the same time, but he's being pedantic to complain about turning the dials right-side up all at the same time when all your ships are at the same initiative.    tl;dr: Technically he's kind of right, since revealing and moving happen for each ship in order.  But a rational player wouldn't complain about what you did since all you did is save a few seconds flipping dials and nothing changed in-game."
XWingTMG,3deheg,mxzf,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:19:23 2015 UTC,"I guess his issue was that once I revealed my dials (which were different) I could see which ship I wanted to move first. So lets say I could see they were going to bump so I decided that I wanted my X to bump a B instead of the other way around, so that it could gets its action. I can see where he is coming from, and we just checked (well he just checked) the FFG rules and it says to activate one ship at a time."
XWingTMG,3deheg,mxzf,2,Wed Jul 15 18:12:02 2015 UTC,"Well, you can peek at your own dials at any given time, so it's still not changing the outcome of the turn.    It really boils down to a matter of proper form.  The correct way to do it is to reveal and activate one ship at a time, but if all your ships share the same PS, what you did doesn't change the outcome."

XWingTMG,3deheg,PCGamerPirate,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:02:08 2015 UTC,Technically you only reveal one dial at a time. You may reveal them in any order as long as they activate at the same pilot skill.

XWingTMG,3dbted,dxsio,3,Wed Jul 15 01:28:10 2015 UTC,"If you aren't revealing a dial, you aren't executing a maneuver from your dial."
XWingTMG,3dbted,rottinguy,2,Wed Jul 15 13:32:13 2015 UTC,"I don't buy this. I agree with some of the other posts in this thread that ""on your dial"" doesn't mean ""executed by revealing a dial""."
XWingTMG,3dbted,MythicalMothman,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:36:08 2015 UTC,"This is how I would read it. I can fully understand why someone would take it the other way though. Until FFG chimes in we don't have a definite answer. I think the whole reason they added the line ""from your dial"" was to make the card unusable when ionized though. I can think of no other reason for that line to have been included. I expect that the FAQ will address this directly soon after wave 7 actually becomes available.   Until then happy flying friend!"
XWingTMG,3dbted,rottinguy,2,Wed Jul 15 18:47:24 2015 UTC,"hmmmm, hard to say because you dont assign a dial while ionzed, but its also a 1 white forward sooo..."
XWingTMG,3dbted,ernesto__-,2,Wed Jul 15 02:40:11 2015 UTC,"After you execute a white or green maneuver on your dial   It doesn't say ""after you reveal an assigned maneuver"". It says after you execute a maneuver on your dial. Ion forces you to execute a white 1-forward. If that exists on your dial then it's not completely unreasonable to suggest you've satisfied the card text triggering the ability. It doesn't specifically say you had to assign it....  I'm not 100% sure which way I'd rule on this if I had to make a decision, but I can see OPs point."
XWingTMG,3dbted,FishBroom,4,Wed Jul 15 04:20:34 2015 UTC,"I would probably rule that it would be acceptable. Breakdown as follows:  The opportunity condition for the card is ""After executing a white or green maneuver on your dial"". With a bit of logic and reasoning, we can imply that the card can be used after executing a maneuver, but only if it is on your dial and it is either white or green.  The Ion reference card states that any ioned ship ""...<moves> as if it were assigned a white 1 forward maneuver. After executing this maneuver..."", meaning that the ship still executes the maneuver, it just doesn't have a maneuver dial to reveal.  Therefore, if your ship has 1 forward on its dial, and is ioned, and has this card equipped, you can activate it. Surprisingly, there's a fair few ships that don't have 1 forwards; the only TIEs that do are the Bomber and Punisher, the A-Wing doesn't, and neither does the M3-A."
XWingTMG,3dbted,darth_static,1 point,Wed Jul 15 05:17:56 2015 UTC,"I would argue however that for that round that you are ionized you don't actually have a dial to refer to, because one isn't assigned."
XWingTMG,3dbted,kngadwhmy,2,Wed Jul 15 15:51:59 2015 UTC,"This is an interesting find. For LR, the wording suggests that as long as you have a white or green 1-forward on your dial, you CAN use LR regardless of being ionized. It doesn't require you to have used your dial that turn.  In your second rules case, you are correct."
XWingTMG,3dbted,JohnLucCarry91,2,Wed Jul 15 04:04:41 2015 UTC,"Ion doesn't allow you to use the dial; you simply do a 1 Forward maneuver. Since Lightning Reflexes specifies executing a maneuver from your dial, and you haven't placed your dial due to being Ion'd, you cannot Lightning Reflexes off it.  A shame, as this is a really interesting idea."
XWingTMG,3dbted,Nomnomnicon,3,Wed Jul 15 11:49:14 2015 UTC,"No. ""After you execute a white or green maneuver on your dial"". But, when you get ionized, the card says you do not assign a maneuver dial.  I do not understand the second case. Where did the 2 turn come from?"
XWingTMG,3dbted,krenzalore,2,Wed Jul 15 02:07:49 2015 UTC,"I think the phrasing on the card could allow for doing it after ionization.    From the ionization reference card... Activation: The owner moves the ship as if it were assigned a white 1 straight maneuver. After executing this maneuver, remove all ion tokens from the ship. It may perform actions as normal.    I think the that since it is phrased as after executing this maneuver it counts as something viable for using this ability.   The second case is just slight complaining about the terrible dial of the HWK. Let's say you're using Jan Ors. You use her ability on someone to give her a stress. Next round, you do a 1-bank, remove a stress since its green, get the focus token, then use lightning reflexes to flip. Now you are not worried about flying away from the fray and out of range with her weapons. By the order of how things happen it should work."
XWingTMG,3dbted,Angerman5000,2,Wed Jul 15 02:29:36 2015 UTC,"The ""on your dial"" isn't referring to whether you can take the same maneuver that being ionized causes, it's referring to whether or not you literally set that maneuver on your dial.  Ionized ships don't set a dial.  I seriously doubt this will work the way you're hoping.  We'll likely see it clarified that it won't work in the FAQ we get after wave 7."
XWingTMG,3dbted,DangerFord,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:21:08 2015 UTC,"On a side note, the receive a stress token after check Pilot step confuses me. Is that so the move isn't considered illegal?"
XWingTMG,3dbted,FishBroom,2,Wed Jul 15 05:46:14 2015 UTC,"It's so that if the move you executed is green, you don't immediately lose the stress you just gained from LR.  Gaining the stress after the check pilot step means you're stuck with it for a while."

XWingTMG,3dc061,mxzf,3,Wed Jul 15 03:38:56 2015 UTC,"Agreed. I'm just guessing Kath will be focused down first, but while alive, she'll be stressing Dash so that PTL won't engage as often as he'd like to. Dash and Blues will do their damage, but unless flown poorly, Soontir will be left to clear out the last ship. Or it goes to time and Kath and Shuttle are down and maybe Dash and a Blue are down. Of course a lot of this depends on initiative as Dash and Kath are 7s and Dash would very much like her to move first."
XWingTMG,3dc061,mahthyoo,2,Wed Jul 15 04:04:34 2015 UTC,"For what it's worth, I've run a list similar to your Dash list at our local Regional Championships, and have flown against an almost identical list to the Imperial list using it, but my Dash was kitted out a little differently to yours, and I think it made the difference in the matchup.  I flew:   Dash Rendar, Lone Wolf, Experimental Interface, Lando Calrissian, Outrider, Heavy Laser Cannon (56).   Lone Wolf + EI on Lando makes it one of the most durable ships imaginable, and lets you still barrel roll when necessary. You lose out on the ability to boost+barrel roll, and not as many moves are green.  I took down the shuttle and Kath quickly, and ended up in a Dash vs. Soontir battle. Soontir couldn't touch Dash, and so it came down to time, where I won.   If it were a battle without time limit, I think I would have had to focus down Soontir first. Without Lando (or similar) for Evade tokens, and Lone Wolf's survivability, I don't think the Outrider would be durable enough to take on Fel, as I've never had much luck with a HLC turret vs. Soontir Full.  In this instance, Soontir not having a Stealth Device might make all of the difference. Push the Limit would let you focus + target lock in the first round of combat, and so with four dice you might land a crippling hit on him. If not, I think it's probably going to favour the Imperials slightly in any untimed event, but the matchup will be fairly even, and will largely come down to player skill."
XWingTMG,3dc061,Korlus,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:21:06 2015 UTC,"Would this combo work with Lone Wolf + Lando? Lando reads that you roll 2 defense dice and get things for the results. Lone Wolf seems to only allow you to reroll when actually attacking or defending.  Unless you simply mean EI + Lando allows you to basically get your action (say a target lock) while ALSO getting potentially up to 2 focus/evade in ADDITION to your defense which Lone Wolf will allow you a slight reroll on. Yeah, that's pretty beastly. All while Dash is ignoring obstacles and flying all over the place shooting behind him.  I've wanted to test out my Dash this week. Maybe I'll run your combo here. It looks like a lot of fun."
XWingTMG,3dc061,X-factor103,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:57:25 2015 UTC,"Lone Wolf doesn't trigger on the rolls to determine what Lando gives you for the turn. What I actually meant is that Lone Wolf gives you a defensive re-roll in addition to Lando's defensive actions (and also the potential for a single offensive re-roll, plus a focus token from Lando, but that's rarer).  The way I run Dash, he's tough to take out, and doesn't rely on actions as much as others do when he's not next to a B-Wing, but you need to get Lone Wolf triggering as often as possible to use him to his fullest potential. Lone Wolf is a fantastically powerful card on him, but if you're not going to make the most of it, a PtL + Engine Upgrade Dash would often do better."
XWingTMG,3d9d2p,PCGamerPirate,13,Tue Jul 14 14:57:01 2015 UTC,"The missile slot of the A-Wing should be filled with Chardaan Refit or Proton Rockets.  There is almost no other missile card worth putting there. This isn't really the fault of the A-Wing, more of a fault of ordnance in general. Advanced homing missiles may be a suitable replacement once we know their effects."
XWingTMG,3d9d2p,Athole,11,Tue Jul 14 15:02:51 2015 UTC,The problem is the net cost of Proton Rockets is five.    Edit: just to clarify - the cost on the A-Wing is 5; everything else is 3.
XWingTMG,3d9d2p,krenzalore,3,Tue Jul 14 16:27:53 2015 UTC,"An A-wing with a lot of actions (PTL etc) and proton rocket can be a useful deterrent while the rocket is loaded. However, I do not think it's enough."
XWingTMG,3d9d2p,Burius81,2,Tue Jul 14 19:53:40 2015 UTC,"I've ran Jake Farrell with PTL, VI, Proton Rockets, and Autothrusters.  I came away with the same conclusion.    My opponents were worried about him at first and mistakenly tried to get arcs on him and shoot him at range three.  After I burned the rockets, he became an annoyance more than anything else.  Then the rest of my list is prioritized and Farrell is left all by his lonesome missing some teeth.  I wish I could put Extra Munitions on an A-Wing with Proton Rockets."
XWingTMG,3d9d2p,Burius81,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:07:25 2015 UTC,Agreed.  When I have used Proton Rockets I don't really feel like they have made up their cost.  I haven't given up on them yet though.

XWingTMG,3d9d2p,dxsio,6,Tue Jul 14 15:31:29 2015 UTC,"I run A-Wings a lot. They are a boatload of fun and can serve multiple purposes.    My personal favorite combination.. Jake Farrel + PTL + Outmaneuver + Autothrusters + Title Kyle Katarn + title + whatever else (I like VI and blaster turret...) Other things that are more attractive to shoot than Kyle.  Try to fly this and see why it is awesome. Jake gets to act as a blocker and a flanker in the same turn. Move him into position, take either a TL or an Evade. Your PS8-10 opponent moves in, possibly bumps, or does his best to arc-dodge your 'piddling' two attack dice.    Once combat starts, pass Jake that extra focus from Kyle, do a barrel roll! Then use PTL to take the focus action, get your free boost (then stress, boo). All of a sudden, that Fat Han is rolling 0-Agility and doesn't get his 3PO guess. If that Soontir isn't running stealth device, you're now shooting 5 dice proton rockets against 2 dice.    Fuck yeah, A-Wings! (Note, this has some weaknesses obviously.. but it's a ton of fun)"
XWingTMG,3d9d2p,ernesto__-,3,Tue Jul 14 18:42:54 2015 UTC,"Oh man o man do I love the A-Wing. These lil buggers can ruin someones day. They dart around the board like crazy, blocking large ships with ease and just destroying their action economy. I played a 5 A wing swarm at regionals, and let me tell ya folks, I didnt expect much from em, but they blocked my falcon pretty much the entire game. Now they dont put out much damage (The game went to time) but after that game I had a new found respect for the A-Wing.   Now let me talk about my man Tycho. He is my absolute favorite pilot to run in the entire game. Usually people put on autothrusters on him to make sure he doesnt die from those darn turrets. Me, experimental interface. My usual Tycho setup includes  PTL+EI+Daredevil+Prockets  that right there folks is a lot of fun. People argue that Tycho lacks from his ability to K-turn because he is always stressed. I would like to remind everyone that a hard turn plus daredevil gets you facing the other way, and you can boost too, and evade/focus.  Of course the other pilot abilities are great too, Gemmer with stealth device makes for some very nice range one security, as well as range 3.   All in all, the cards that come in an A-Wing pack are great, the ship is great, and with a missile, not too shabby at damage output. Its hard not to love A-Wings."
XWingTMG,3d9d2p,JohnLucCarry91,3,Tue Jul 14 15:42:54 2015 UTC,The BEST build the A-Wing has is Jake Farrell + Chaardan Refit + A-Wing Test Pilot + Veteran Instincts + Push the Limit + Autothrusters = 28 Points. Nigh impossible to kill due to its supreme manoeuvrability and PS9
XWingTMG,3d9d2p,Burius81,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:12:42 2015 UTC,"I've ran it a few times and I like the way it flies but man, 28 points and only two attack dice is rough.  I've tried proton rockets on this build as well and they make Jake a bigger threat so as a side effect my opponent spend more time trying to kill him at the beginning which as you know with PS9, 3 dice, auto thrusters focus and evade is pretty tough to do.  But after you burn the PRockets he ends up buzzing around spit balling at other ships hoping something will stick.    I had a draw once with Jake in the above config and Corran Horn with R2-D2 and FCS being the last ships on the board.  He couldn't land hits or keep Jake in arc and I couldn't do damage fast enough to whittle him down because of R2-D2.  After 20 minutes of 1v1 we played chicken, no one died, we shook hands and called it."
XWingTMG,3d9d2p,JohnLucCarry91,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:08:44 2015 UTC,"Haha. The spitball analogy made me laugh.  You're right, though. With only two attack dice he leaves a little to be desired. However, I've taken down lots of Ties / Z's just by chasing them for several turns, so even without PRocks I still think he's really strong."
XWingTMG,3d9d2p,Burius81,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:36:52 2015 UTC,"It may be a matter of perception for me, I have flown A-Wings less than a dozen times and the dice have been middling to poor so it has colored my opinion a bit.  Two instances come to mind right away; first time using Gemmer in range one got blown away in the first shooting round and recently having my PRockets roll five blanks.  The lesson here I think is to not trust dice. (Nuffle is a fickle)  For the record I really like A-Wings, I just haven't figure out how I want to use them yet."
XWingTMG,3d9d2p,gnomebard,3,Wed Jul 15 17:25:01 2015 UTC,"With arguably the best dial of the game, the A-Wing's speed and maneuverability is certainly represented in the game. While not exactly an ""interceptor killer"" like in the lore, the A-Wing is an excellent blocker and harassment unit."
XWingTMG,3d9d2p,RedFive_02,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:59:48 2015 UTC,With the idea of blocking in mind: What are your thoughts on PS1 A-Wings as blockers? Would you spend to points to give it Auto's?
XWingTMG,3d9d2p,mxzf,2,Tue Jul 14 20:59:04 2015 UTC,I like to keep my A's as lean as possible. Decrease the chance that they will get shot at so they can keep their focus for offense.  Autothrusters wouldn't really help much because you want these things fighting at range 1 to get enough offense or blocking large turrets so they can't be shot anyway.
XWingTMG,3d9d2p,Suicidal_Ferret,3,Tue Jul 14 22:22:41 2015 UTC,My problem was always trying to play them like an interceptor. Big mistake. The best success I've had is flying generic refits. I just don't care what happens. They're there to put you on rocks and strip your actions so Dash can wreck you at range 3. Think of them as flying asteroids.
XWingTMG,3d9d2p,Cyborg2342,4,Tue Jul 14 15:50:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah.  I really want to love them as much as Interceptors, but that third red die makes a massive difference."

XWingTMG,3d9d2p,howieloader,2,Wed Jul 15 02:25:44 2015 UTC,Here's a build I've dabbled with as part of an escalation league.  Jake Farrell   Push The Limit Proton Rockets   Tycho Celchu   Push The Limit Proton Rockets A-Wing Test Pilot Expert Handling   Jan Ors   Calculation Blaster Turret Kyle Katarn Moldy Crow   You've got two highly maneuverable ships that can both boost and barrel roll with the threat of a 5 dice attack if you can close into range 1 for a lucky shot.  Jan helps offset the A-Wing's two die offensive by creating stress which Kyle clears to guarantee you've got a steady flow of focus tokens even if you're opponent is blocking your maneuver. Banking focus tokens is a no brainer and Calculation can give you some extra punching power if you only roll one eyeball or have a stack of tokens to burn.

Thinking to myself that they are just a more expensive tie fighter. Probably was true for the longest time but I finally realize what the rebel aces cards do for the ship.

I feel like his ability is too situational to really work.   Everyone's already named some great lists for named A's, so I'd like to point out that a green Squadron Pilot is a really cheap ship that can be loaded out with two ept's, Autothrusters, and Chardaan Refit or prockets.  Green Squadron Pilot - PTL, outmaneuver, Chardaan Refit, Autothrusters, and title (25 points)   You could run 4 of these suckers."
XWingTMG,3d9d2p,Jimmars,1 point,Wed Jul 15 05:58:20 2015 UTC,4 green squads with ptl and proton rockets has only lost me 1 game out of about 6.  There are enough of them that move far and fast enough to be able to generally land 1 rocket a turn.  Until they get their rockets off just focus+evade.  I have considered a build that drops the rockets and adds either predator or outmaneuver and autothrusters but that 5 die shot is so good especially now in the 2 ship heavy meta where it is easy to strip defensive tokens from low agi ships and nail them with prockets.

The former lowers the cost of this Prototype to 15pts, which allows you to fit 6 of them into a swarm with change to spare or just couple of cost effective blockers or flankers. The latter bolsters the A-Wings damage output and offers a great alpha strike option as seen in the Procket Man lists that saw some tournament play. Green Squadron Pilot W2 RA PS3: The addition of the Elite Pilot Talent slot opens up the option to equip Push the Limit or other great cards that looks to help either damage output (Predator) or positional advantage (Stay on Target, Daredevil). Equipping the Refit to this ships gives you a steep discount on the aforementioned Elite Pilot Talents if Proton Rockets are not in the budget. Gemmer Sojan RA PS5 Gemmer enjoys getting up close and personal and looks to live within Range 1 of enemy ships. Proton Rockets are a great fit here as well as the third A-Wing upgrade out of Rebel Aces, A-Wing Test Pilot. This grants pilots without the Elite Pilot slot access to one of give pilots a second EPT if they already have one available. Gemmer can then take Stay On Target to remain on the tail of his opposition. Arvel Crynyd W2 PS6: Most known for crashing into the bridge of a Star Destroyer, Arvel is no stranger to bumping and his ability reflects this. He can attack enemies that he is in contact with. To make this happen often The Test Pilot title can give Arvel Daredevil to help him make contact with his target. Jake Farrell RA PS7: Jake has a great positional ability to barrel roll or boost after taking a focus action or are handed a focus token. This allows him to arc-dodge and stay out of the line of fire.  Push the Limit is a solid option that allows for maximum positional options, pair that with Test Pilot, Veteran Instincts and Lone Wolf and you have a ship that can hang with Soontir Fel. Tycho CelchuW2 PS8: The A-Wing Ace can take stress and still perform actions which allows him to maneuver aggressively and protect himself with an evade or take a target lock/focus when he has the enemy ship dead to rights. Test Pilot, Push the Limit & Daredevil can put Tycho in some pretty amazing places and should be hard to pin down."

Don't forget that boost is a very sought after ability on all ships, and there are very few ships that haven't seen an Engine Upgrade in some form of competitive play. As the X-Wing can take an Engine Upgrade already, making taking the Boost similarly cost prohibitive would make sense."

Fluff wise, it was a dogfighter, but on the tabletop it is very bad at doing so compared to a number of other ships.    In fact, it, the Z95, the Y-Wing, and the upcoming scum fighter are the only small ships in the game that cannot either boost or barrel roll.  Basically, against more maneuverable ships it's unable to actually dogfight and gets eaten.  Against less maneuverable ships, it's actually not much less maneuverable and they are much tougher, so it gets eaten by them too.  The X-Wing also isn't cheap like a Z95, so it's not a ship you can afford to just lose."

But R2 can help out there for 1 point.  4x Gold + title + R2 (generic) + Twin Laser Turret (from K-wing) for 100 points seems like it would a fun jousting build to try.

Plus the larger base means it moves a long ways on any move.  Plus the MF can evade where a Y-wing can't.  Plus upgrades are more cost-effective on the large ships, so an engine upgrade fits well on the MF to give it crazy speed and maneuverability.

PtL Interceptor is more mobile and faster than an X-Wing, but can still only take 3 hits. I take the risks (hence I play Imps more) with green dice, but I don't pretend for a second Interceptors are 'tough', and just avoid being shot at rather than joust.   Maybe you fly Interceptors well. Which Interceptor pilot are you using? Generics or special? Because that's a different comparison and X-Wing specials are still good. I would never consider a generic X-wing 'easy prey' unless I was already behind it. Turns 1-3 you're probably respecting it's three red dice."
XWingTMG,3dajnu,Nomnomnicon,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:17:31 2015 UTC,"A PtL interceptor will regularly take an evade action, meaning it can actually take four hits in a single round (one less than an X-Wing). If it survives that single round of fire, and also took some damage (or at least, spent its evade token), it can now take +1 hit, for 5 hits. If it's under sustained fire for more than two turns, it's actually tougher than an X-Wing due to the evade action.  Edit: I am aware that's a slight simplification and doesn't factor in things like shields, crits, astromechs and similar, but it's a generally accurate benchmark to measure against."

Point for point a 21 point interceptor wont get PtL, so will be limited in offense vs defensive action. Alpha Squad with Auto's is a better competition, as it's more possibly with points.  Basiaclly it's going to come down to dice each time, however. And flying. We could through words around all day and not change each others opinions XD"

Sure, it has to be perfect but even the best ever round of shooting from most basic ships outside range one, if everything goes the best it can, won't remove an X-wing (The exception is the Phantom which can with 4 crits + 1 direct hit). Even at range one, it comes down to getting the Direct Hit card. 'Tough' and 'Fragile' are not on the same scale as 'Agile' and 'Evasive'.

The fact of it is, the x-wing is easier to destroy than an interceptor in an actual game (try it!) and because fragile means ""easily destroyed"" we can with confidence say X-wings are more fragile than Tie Interceptors. It's also true that X-wings have more hit points, but I know what is destroyed more easily, and it's the X."
XWingTMG,3dajnu,krenzalore,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:29:10 2015 UTC,"I have tried it, and I've seen Soontir get blocked and faced planted by a couple of lowly Zeds - sure, unlikely, but you're just not admitting that's possible! Unlikely, and good flying can stop it, but good flying can conversely also cause it (on behalf of the Zeds, rather than Soontir of course).   I'm not saying the X is hard to kill. It requires more dice, and an unlucky roll on defence doesn't doom you in the first round. I'm not saying Interceptors are survivable, or good - I run them in my tournament squad - and late game they are nearly always superior to most rebel craft simply because you've had the whole game to maneuver around them and get them where you want.   But denying that, almost every time you get shot at, disaster could occur really is a refusal to accept that Interceptors are fragile. Mobile, agile, survivable, powerful, strong, scary, predatory - but still fragile.   The tabletop's not a shooting gallery. But if you're going to move outside stats for gameplay results (which then greatly depend on dice rolls and player decisions rather than hard stats) then ignoring that it happens, and that an X pilot will be trying to make it a shooting gallery/jousting match, is ignoring your own argument.  I fly Imperial, I love TIE-I's (any TIE in fairness) and much prefer mobility and agility over hard HP stats. But I appreciate each of my ships is basically made of glass and I need to fly them well to keep them alive. The X-Wing might fly like a slightly guided rock, but it is tougher at the base line. Not as good, or fun, or perhaps even interesting, and definitely easier to outmaneuver and take down, but 'more fragile' is not a correct comparative phrase.   TL;DR: I prefer the TIE-I to the X, but I won't agree it is less 'fragile' than the X. If you don't agree that's fine. I didn't come here to change your mind - and I'm only disagreeing with your choice of word, not your argument."
XWingTMG,3dajnu,Nomnomnicon,1 point,Thu Jul 16 08:23:25 2015 UTC,How do you define fragile?  Why is the X-Wing replaced by the B-Wing?
XWingTMG,3dajnu,krenzalore,1 point,Thu Jul 16 09:16:30 2015 UTC,"Fragile: Delicate, easy to break. The X-Wing is easy to hit, easy to outfly, but has almost twice as many HP as the TIE-I. If an X gets shot at range two by a Zed, there's no chance it can die. At the same range, a single crit can ruin an Interceptor's day, or at least make it significantly worse. (Full HP supposed in both examples).  The B-Wing is undeniably tougher than X-Wing, a measurement most people base off of their respect HP.   Hell, if they had the same stat line as the X, or even 3-1-3-2 (statstically worse and also not the reality) with just the additional barrel roll action I'd still take them more. B's are both tougher and have added mobility. That's why their chosen above X's - two benefits, differently defined.  Again, I'm not saying for a second the X is 'better' than the TIE-I or the B. I simply disagree with the word 'Fragile' as a descriptor. It has many otehr faults."

Based on the Kihraxz fighter, it seems FFG feels that the X-wing is close to right (since the Kihraxz is a near clone).  I'd expect something like:   X-wing specific upgrades (2pt boost upgrade, x-wing only astromech, etc) Point reduction of sorts (-1pt title, etc)   If I was FFG and super generous to the X-wing, I'd make a title like this to take advantage of Extra Munitions:  T-65 X-Wing  X-wing only.

XWingTMG,3dajnu,BuzzedAldrin_69,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:25:43 2015 UTC,The point cost can be fiddled around with.  I'm hoping the core concept is enough of a buff to give a subtle boost to the x-wing without infringing on other ships territory.

XWingTMG,3dajnu,Aanar,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:49:18 2015 UTC,I hope you enjoy it!  It seems like a modest buff to the x-wing without leading it into overpowered territory.
XWingTMG,3dajnu,JohnLucCarry91,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:49:22 2015 UTC,"It's an idea worth trying out.  My concern though is that infringes too much on the ships that are supposed to be nimble where boost makes sense like the A-wing.    Right now, the x-wing seems to best fit the role of jouster, but is simply out-performed by the B-wing and Headhunter.  The rookie at 21 points is just too close to a blue at 22 and too far from a cheap Z at 12.  A jouster option at a base point cost near the middle of 17 could be useful for squad building.  It seems like you'd have to give up more than the torpedo and astromech slots for that to be balanced though.  Losing a shield or hull point might do it.  The other option I see which seems more interesting is to try to think of a way to make the X-wing better fit a generalist role and not really fit into any of the rock-paper-scissors roles of turret, arc dodger, or jouster.  Not sure if there's really any reasonable way to do that though."
XWingTMG,3dajnu,Herbstrabe,2,Tue Jul 14 22:31:13 2015 UTC,"My hope would be by limiting it to green maneuvers the X-wing is stuck with the 1 banks or 1-2 forward, or filling the astromech slot with the R2 for greater maneuverability limiting options for other astromechs.  In this way it becomes a limited buff, or a committed selection and hopefully won't infringe on A wing territory as I love that ship!  Korlus had the great idea of instead of a free boost action allowing the choice for a boost action after the green maneuver which I think makes this buff even more subtle yet hopefully impactful.  That would also distinguish the X-wing even further from the A-wing (I hope).  Thank you for your feedback and ideas!"
XWingTMG,3dajnu,JohnLucCarry91,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:08:34 2015 UTC,Interesting.  I hadn't realized the greens on the x-wing dial would limit this so much.  You may want to limit it to speed 1 or speed 1 and 2 maneuvers in case something like the Unhinged Astromech (You may treat all 3-speed maneuvers as green maneuvers) comes out that could be equipped on an x-wing which seems like it would be too much.
XWingTMG,3dajnu,Enervata,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:09:40 2015 UTC,"What if the X-Wing received a 1-point Title where, while performing an attack, as long as they have a focus token, they may reroll one blank result?  I feel like the fact that they have 4 fricking laser cannons attached to their fricking wings isn't being fricking respected enough.  Groovy baby.  ALTERNATE TAKE:  Same title except free, and it only works when another friendly X-Wing is within range 1."

XWingTMG,3dajnu,Korlus,1 point,Wed Jul 15 05:38:29 2015 UTC,"Instead of playtesting it with boost, have you tried testing it with SLAM?  It's been brought up a couple of times in the past that an S-foil mechanic would be cool for the X-wing, and when SLAM was revealed a few people thought SLAM might represent the S-foils being closed.  It would give the X-wing an escape mechanic to setup another jousting run, which I like as a differentiator vs typical arc dodging."
XWingTMG,3dajnu,Aanar,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:25:04 2015 UTC,"My favourite options for X-Wing would be along the same lines, but slightly less powerful to not further step on the toes of the already hard-pressed A-Wing. As such it would be something like:    T-65B X-Wing X-Wing Only. Title. 2 Points  If you performed a green manoeuvre this turn, you may perform actions as if the <boost action> symbol were on your action bar.    A1 Refit X-Wing Only. Astromech. -1 Point  This card has a negative points cost.    Edit: So, the reason why I prefer this is it doesn't give a free Push the Limit to most X-Wing pilots, and it won't pair off ridiculously with PtL on someone like Wedge. It doesn't invalidate Engine Upgrade entirely (although it probably will in 95% of cases) and so doesn't alter the action economy too much. I'm not sure if 2 point or 3 points is better for the B, but I went with 2 points, but there is a strong argument for 3 (as it's the same cost as Leebo and one point less than an Engine Upgrade).  The A1 Refit is added to make Rookies a point cheaper, and make them competitive with a regular B-Wing. It also pairs well with the T-65B when you're not running an R2 unit, making it only +1 point and makes the R2 Unit (which would otherwise be an automatic upgrade on the ship) a more ""costly"" option, factoring in opportunity cost.  The opportunity cost now attached to expensive astromechs like the stressbot and R2-D2 will make common astromech builds put onto named pilot a little less common as we drive people towards cheaper, unnamed builds, without losing any of the power in current astromech synergies.  I'm not 100% sold on the A1 Refit, as I'm not sure I like the ""nerf"" to astromechs that it provides, but I think there are so few astromechs commonly taken on the X-Wing that it's actually a decent card, and it won't change the E-Wing or the Y-Wing."

It makes the opportunity cost of equipping any astromech increase by one.    What about an X-wing only title card that lowered the astromech cost of any 1 cost astromech to 0?  That keeps R2-D2 and the stress bot the same but lets you pick something up.    Or making the cost reduction use the torpoedo slot instead?    I haven't watched the movies in a long time, but it seemed like every Y-wing and X-wing carried an astromech."
XWingTMG,3dajnu,Jimmars,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:19:13 2015 UTC,"Initially I agreed with you with regards to the opportunity cost, but let's take a look at the astromechs currently available to be taken, and how they are taken:   R2 Astromech (1) - rarely taken on X-Wings, but can be used with PtL to make 2 banks and turns green (giving them a similar dial to an A-Wing or TIE Interceptor). Not currently popular, but likely would be if the T-65B was also added. R2-D6 (1) - Adds an EPT. The named X-Wing pilots are used so frequently this is all but untaken on X-Wings. R5 Astromech (1) - Not taken on X-Wings due to the small time it's relevant in games. R3-A2 (2) - The stressbot. Used a lot and arguably the strongest astromech. Would still see play, unless there are Y-Wings in the same list, where the Y-Wing would field it (it may well have done so anyway, as their turrets pair well with losing the stress). R5-K6 (2) - Occasionally taken on offensive pilots such as Wedge. This one would legitimately be a loss, and a sad change. Still rarely taken, and often compared to a Fire-Control System. R7 Astromech (2) - Taken almost exclusively on Tarn Mison, and would continue to be following this change due to the extreme synergy. R2-F2 (3) - Already plenty expensive and only really taken in certain niches (e.g. Wedge with Garven or Kyle/Jan). Perhaps a slight decrease in the amount taken, but if a player is building a list around it, it will likely be taken regardless. R5-D8 (3) - Completely untaken on anything but Y-Wings, and rare even there. R5-P9 (3) - Almost exclusively taken on Luke as an R2-D2 alternative, and is so strong it will likely continue to be taken. R7-T1 (3) - Competitive, but almost too expensive in many situations. Good on high-PS pilots such as Wedge, so may genuinely lose out on use. At the same time, I've never seen one outside of a casual game. The T-65B would decrease the appeal of the boost action also, meaning this one would also suffer. R2-D2 (4) - More frequently taken on Corran Horn today than X-Wings, it is still such a popular card it would continue to be taken in almost all instances it made sense the first time.   As such, I see perhaps two astromechs it would change (both bolded), and one of them would be hurt more by the other change than this one.  As such, while I agree with you in principle, in practice I think the net change will be tiny - the main worry would be with regards to future astromechs released (if any).  Further, any lowering of astromech cost would basically give all X-Wings a free R2 unit, making so much of their dial green as to make the more manoeuvrable ships jealous. While it may be relatively balanced, I don't think that suits the feel the developers are after, even if the balance would work out fairly well.  Finally, the A1 Refit is styled after the T-65D-A1 that got rid of the astromech bay. I agree that most X-Wings flew with astromech units, but my assumption was that most of them were too generic to provide a real-world bonus, and so we didn't ascribe them an actual value."
XWingTMG,3dajnu,Aanar,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:39:38 2015 UTC,"I quickly looked through the list of astromechs so at my quick glance a free 1 point astro seemed reasonable, but I haven't played enough to know how they each get used so thanks a bunch for the run down!    Thanks for the link on the T-65D-A1.  Your suggestion makes more sense to me now.  Gameplay comes first of course, but I always appreciate it when there is something to tie it into the lore."
XWingTMG,3dajnu,i_shit_my_spacepants,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:37:16 2015 UTC,"So here's a perfectly insane idea:  Title: Stealth X Cost: 2 points Effect: X-Wing Only. The X-Wing's status bar gains the cloak icon.  If we're mining old school EU for ideas here's one.  It gives the X-Wing a purpose other than being an overpriced Z-95 or less maneuverable/fragile B-Wing.  It also gives the X-Wing an Arc Dodging mechanic that isn't boost.  It's nutty to the point of being broken, but you could fiddle with the point value slightly.  I based it off of a 25 point phantom with PS 3 versus a PS 3 X-Wing at 23 points.  I liked some of the S-Foil ideas, but the X-Wings were never flown that way except in Rogue Squadron.  Another idea:   Astromech: A1 Upgrade Point cost: 0 Effect: X-Wing only Ship gains system upgrade icon"
XWingTMG,3day2b,pie904,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:29:59 2015 UTC,I think it's solid and wouldn't hold you back.
XWingTMG,3day2b,antigrapist,0,Wed Jul 15 01:18:26 2015 UTC,"This is a good list to run because you have a large amount of hit points in your fleet, AND you've managed to fit in Soontir Fel (arguably the best late game pilot there is). You have Darth Vader to deal with opposing Fels / Jakes, and Kath is a very nice beatstick that will help you achieve that winning late-game position you want Fel to be in.  Some quick suggestions that might optimize your list:  -I think that your Recon Specialist + Calculation combo  is a little underwhelming. For the 4 points you've used here you could instead have taken VI + Navigator (which will greatly assist you in passing over enemies to utilize that powerful auxiliary firing arc).  -Targeting Computer is over-rated on Fel. If you drop Calculation on Kath, you can switch that Targeting Computer to a Stealth Device, which will give you (in my opinion) the ideal Soontir build. You could then swap out Recon Specialist on Kath for Push the Limit (or something else around that point level). These are just suggestions, though.  EDIT: My bad, I got my Kaths mixed up. However I still think that the Calculation / Recon Combo is meh. Also, Soontir Fel doesn't need to 'do more damage', he needs to survive. As long as he's not taking damage, he will take any ship down (excepting Vader crew ships). That's why Stealth Device is infinitely better than Targeting Computer."
XWingTMG,3day2b,JohnLucCarry91,2,Tue Jul 14 22:30:21 2015 UTC,Dear god you could not be any more wrong about targeting computer on Fel.  It hyper amps his damage output.  Also recon spec is one of the better ways of keeping a firespray of any type alive.  Navigator is a meh card if you are a good pilot.  (and as others have pointed out its imp kath which is why calc is there.)
XWingTMG,3day2b,starslinger72,2,Wed Jul 15 01:14:25 2015 UTC,Chiming in to support TL Fel. I played a number of games and in a tournament with him and he did quite well for himself. It means you can convert some opportunities when you're planning to take a green maneuver anyways to PtL and sneak in spare target locks.  Then you can use your focus for defense and still throw out extra damage!
XWingTMG,3day2b,AffixBayonets,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:31:14 2015 UTC,"Also the number of times you will only need either boost or barrel roll to set up a good shot.  Then if you dont have TC you get to PTL for focus, where as with it you get to PTL for a TL + focus shot."
XWingTMG,3day2b,starslinger72,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:34:14 2015 UTC,"Absolutely, this happens to me all the time.   Plus, he's a great partner for Vessery then too."
XWingTMG,3day2b,AffixBayonets,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:42:08 2015 UTC,Indeed it does.  That was the original reason I added the TC to Fel back in the day!
XWingTMG,3day2b,starslinger72,-1,Wed Jul 15 02:46:45 2015 UTC,"Dear god your comment could not be any more overly dramatic. All I said was that it's over-rated. Relax, pal.  Soontir doesn't need more damage, he needs to not die. Stealth Device is a much better choice, especially in conjunction with Autothrusters."
XWingTMG,3day2b,JohnLucCarry91,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:34:16 2015 UTC,"It really isn't, you shouldn't need a stealth device to be able to keep him alive.  This is a game of damage output and stacking that as high as possible is almost always the right answer.  Among the best Fel players out there, running stealth is seen as using training wheels for an interceptor player.    Hell even hull or shield would be better in case you run into someone running Vader crew."
XWingTMG,3day2b,starslinger72,0,Wed Jul 15 03:44:25 2015 UTC,"The only reason anybody even started running TC on Fel was because Howlrunner + 4 Academy Pilots was 66 points, leaving you one point shy of the 35 points required to pick up the PtL + Thrust + Stealth build. Any reputable player running TC Fel in any other list is just copying somebody else, or also ran out of points. Soontir most certainly does not need a TC to function, and although it's by no means a terrible choice, its simply inferior to taking a Stealth Device, which in conjunction with Autothrusters dramatically increases his survivability. I can show you some math to prove how good Stealth is on Soontir if you wish.  EDIT: On second thought, let's just agree to disagree."
XWingTMG,3day2b,JohnLucCarry91,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:53:26 2015 UTC,"I ran a TC Fel to 6th at american nationals, and no I wasn't ""copying"" someone.    While he doesn't need a targeting comp, it is a very good upgrade for him as he can make use of the extra action easily.  If you want a defensive upgrade, shield is much better than stealth for the Vader issue.  Stealth is great and all but can be dealt with, and has been consistently."
XWingTMG,3day2b,starslinger72,-4,Wed Jul 15 04:12:04 2015 UTC,"You can brag about your national placement after you win a game in the Reddit Raider tournament, buddy.  Let's agree to disagree here."

You are saying no one has run TC on Fel and that simply isnt true.  You are saying people should run stealth when there are better uses of the points in either amping your damage or actually improving your survival, with shield.    Hell I was also top 16 in the reddit cup 2 wtih a TC fel...  edit:  Wtf you aren't even in the tournament..."
XWingTMG,3day2b,starslinger72,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:59:50 2015 UTC,-I think that your Recon Specialist + Calculation combo is a little underwhelming. For the 4 points you've used here you could instead have taken VI + Navigator (which will greatly assist you in passing over enemies to utilize that powerful auxiliary firing arc).   This is Imperial Kath. Her rear arc is no better than her front arc but she deals the target stress if they cancel out any of her crits in an attack. That's what he's going for here.

XWingTMG,3day2b,Radical-Ed,2,Tue Jul 14 22:56:07 2015 UTC,"Mangler is pretty snazzy, but then again its nice being able to take full advantage of her rear arc and mangler won't let you do that, right? Recon + Calculation feels a little more useful in this situation. Assuming that this is a direct swap of 4 points and the newly freed elite/crew slots could not be filled with more snazzy things of course."

XWingTMG,3davkn,EdgeOfDreams,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:28:36 2015 UTC,This is interesting. Can you enact fcs if you destroy your target? I don't think there's a FAQ clarification (after you perform an attack - is the ship immediately gone? Not if you consider simultaneous firing etc).  A great combo for hunting low hp swarmy escorts.
XWingTMG,3davkn,Rory_braker,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:17:58 2015 UTC,"You wouldn't be able to. Correct me if it's been FAQ'd, but Weapons Engineer allows you to acquire a second target lock when you lock on to a target. FCS states 'after an attack', you may acquire a target lock on the defender. You'd acquire a target lock after the attack is resolved, I.E. after the check damage step. If you destroy your opponent, you can't get a target lock on your next mark."
XWingTMG,3davkn,Shgrizz,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:41:44 2015 UTC,This is correct. You cannot destroy a ship and get another target lock in this manner.
XWingTMG,3davkn,JohnLucCarry91,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:36:18 2015 UTC,"There's one almost-exception: if you put lethal damage onto a ship but it doesn't die right away due to the Simultaneous Fire rule, the combo still works."
XWingTMG,3davkn,quarrel,1 point,Wed Jul 15 06:27:34 2015 UTC,Yeah that was the context I was thinking. If the ship being destroyed had the same PS as another nearby you should theoretically be able to drop the tl onto the new target as both of those ships' deaths are reconciled after the attack (and fcs) is resolved.

XWingTMG,3d90kn,Thelewis84,2,Tue Jul 14 13:27:53 2015 UTC,"No I'm talking about an upgrade card from the kwing expansion. Google the upgrade cards.

XWingTMG,3d90kn,DangerFord,3,Tue Jul 14 13:39:18 2015 UTC,"I feel like the Recon Specialist and moldy crow title help out with Stealth Device in this list, though. 3 defense dice doesn't do very much for you without modification."
XWingTMG,3d90kn,berusplants,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:55:40 2015 UTC,"Aye, I would leave the recon spec and MC tittle on the HWK and probably ditch the concusion misiles so I could include the twin turret which makes Jan more reliable offensively.

It seems counter-intuitive with Recon Specialist is all."
XWingTMG,3d90kn,starslinger72,2,Tue Jul 14 13:54:24 2015 UTC,"Squad Leader gives Chewie's Falcon an extra action.  Recon Specialist is needed to fire the turret effectively, plus you can save up focus with this combo so you don't lose out by spending your action on Squad Leader."

XWingTMG,3d90kn,scuff,2,Tue Jul 14 14:31:35 2015 UTC,No you fly slow for hte first 2 to 3 turns building up a focus bank.  After that you use squad leader while you have a stockpile to help the falcon out.
XWingTMG,3d90kn,CircleTheFire,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:54:19 2015 UTC,"Build up tokens in the first couple rounds, then her job is mostly just to support Chewie. She gives him regular 4 or 5 dice attacks with Focus+Target Lock. It's like the Super Dash build (Kyle Katarn crew, HLC, Outrider Title, PtL), but without the donut hole.  I feel like this would still have trouble against Soontir though. 4 hits is good, but outside of arc you're dealing with 2 guaranteed evades (token and thrusters) and 4 green dice."

XWingTMG,3d9xr4,forkmonkey88,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:15:55 2015 UTC,"In this specific case, it is the priority because you want to, if at all possible, shoot first with Whisper so Advanced Cloaking Device can trigger before anyone can shoot at her.

XWingTMG,3d9xr4,moutski,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:20:57 2015 UTC,"First, that's awesome! Second, what matchups did you have trouble against? Any tips?"
XWingTMG,3d9xr4,starslinger72,2,Tue Jul 14 23:59:15 2015 UTC,"Thanks!  I played three different rebel lists: Paul Heaver's ABXY, a three B-wing list (Keyan, Ten, and a Blue), as well as a BBBBZ list.  Fel/Whisper tear these kinds of lists apart, generally.  I usually split Fel and Whisper apart and ran the shuttle right up the middle.  If they went after the shuttle, I came in with the other two in a pincer.  If they go after either Fel or Whisper, I come hard with the other one and go evasive with the one they attack, all the while the shuttle is cleaning up and causing problems right in the middle of everything.  It worked pretty well in those matchups.  I lost my shuttle in two of those games, but didn't even take damage on Fel or Whisper.    I played a 5 TIE Figher/Fel list which I beat as well.  The shuttle when down quick in that match but not before I was able to use Vader to cripple Fel with a damaged sensor array crit.  From there it was just cleanup as the TIE's can't really touch Fel or Whisper unless you completely whiff your dice.  Try not to let them block you, because they will try to.  I had trouble with fat turret lists.  I ran up against a Fel/Deci early on and lost pretty bad because I tried to chase down Fel and his Deci cleaned me up.  However, I played two more Fel/Deci lists (one of which was a top 8 rematch against the guy I lost to) and I won both by changing my tactics to put all my firepower into the Deci first before touching Fel.  Little tip, if you're up against a Deci with Rebel Captive, I recommend trying to position Fel in such a way that you don't need to use PTL so you can fire first with him to take the stress from the Captive.  The final match was against a Han with 3Z list.  He destroyed me.  He had initiative bid at 98 to my 99 so he took initiative and just manhandled Whisper, and his Zs got my shuttle pretty quick.  From there it was a matter of time.  I got his Zs, but Han was basically untouched when he killed Fel.  I'm not even sure how I would have flown that match differently.  Han with initiative just hard counters Whisper.  Hope that helps a little."

XWingTMG,3d9xr4,Skuerzo,2,Wed Jul 15 13:35:52 2015 UTC,"This build is really hurt by control and stress builds.  Bumping the OGP to Yorr to pull rebel captive stress from either Fel or Whisper, not to mention tact or other stress cards is a solid upgrade.  Id also drop stealth on Fel for FCS on whisper so you can use your TL for attack and take an evade for your action to stay alive."
XWingTMG,3d9xr4,fl1p_problems,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:24:26 2015 UTC,"I've played some with this style of list, and personally I've dropped the stealth device on Fel. That lets me afford FCS and rebel captive and I'm still at 98 points, or go with gunner and be at one hundred. It just seems like with a solid crew and fcs whisper is too vulnerable to being focused down early.  Alternatively, you could run stealth, fcs and tactician on W."
XWingTMG,3da9qc,Hayabusa201,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:44:15 2015 UTC,"I think the weak point will be your Bodyguard.  If he gets blocked Serissu is in trouble.  Serissu is also hampered by the fact that he can't use his own ability and has to stay close to the Bodyguard.  Might be a better option to have Serissu be the naked Bodyguard for 3 Cartel Spacers with HLC + Stealth Device.  The Bodyguard focus being donated to whoever loses Stealth Device or is running point.  3x Cartel Spacer (14), Heavy Laser Cannon (7), Stealth Device (3), ""Heavy Scyk"" Interceptor (Cannon) (2)  Serissu (20), Bodyguard Swarm Tactics (2)  Comes in at 100 points.  M3-A's are fragile glass cannons, but they pack one hell of a punch.  Serissu just drags his ass behind the 3 in front like Biggs would.  I don't think it'd be viable for a big tournament, but it'd be tons of fun in smaller ones."

XWingTMG,3d9lm0,masterxlos,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:58:52 2015 UTC,"You're probably better off with 2x inertial dampeners than the seismic charge.  Also, you could consider VI on Kath and running something like predator on B. It just send to me that Ps 6& 9 is better than 7 & 8 the majority of the time."
XWingTMG,3d9lm0,antigrapist,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:42:23 2015 UTC,I liked VI on IG88-b so he could peel tokens on whoever is chasing Kath then I would have Kath sweep in that order. I used recon for that defense focus cause 2 agility is not enough.  I usually end up rolling focus on defense anyways so the double focus is nice to use on both dice. I like the idea of damp but used seismic as a distraction / finishing blow on things trailing Kath that's way she can focus another target instead of wasting an attack on it. Am I wrong to think in this  manner?
XWingTMG,3d9lm0,antigrapist,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:37:33 2015 UTC,"If someone is trailing Kath, you're already ahead thanks to her ability.   Not only is the k4 stronger offensively, but it helps you against stress builds, which ptl kath is weak to."
XWingTMG,3d9lm0,krenzalore,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:53:39 2015 UTC,"I am not really scared of seismic charges. Proton bombs, however, can end anyone with 2 hull, even if they are still shielded. That means the ever common Z-95 Headhunter and E-Wing."
XWingTMG,3d9lm0,boredompwndu,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:06:00 2015 UTC,I've always enjoyed FCS on B. Gets more mileage if your opponent completely evades your first shot
XWingTMG,3d9lm0,starslinger72,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:18:54 2015 UTC,I would 100% swap from recon spec to K4.  You get TL + focus + evade or boost in a turn and will be doing greens most of the time due to PTL.  The turns you get a TL + focus rear arc attack will make it all worth while.
XWingTMG,3d9cmm,Th3GingerHitman,3,Tue Jul 14 14:53:51 2015 UTC,"Yes, that is a legal sequence of actions. PTL can trigger on a free action so long as you're not stressed when it happens."
XWingTMG,3d9cmm,EdgeOfDreams,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:57:33 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I figured it would, but just felt cheesy since you would be doing 4 total actions in a turn."
XWingTMG,3d9cmm,EdgeOfDreams,3,Tue Jul 14 15:01:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but that's one of the Rebel faction's specialties - wacky combos that use multiple ships to pull off shenanigans like that. As soon as someone chews through Cracken's 4 hit points, you're back to the usual 3 effective actions per round of Super Dash.  You want to get real crazy, you take advantage of the fact that Kyle assigns a focus token but doesn't actually make you take the focus action. Then give Cracken Cluster Missiles so he can make two attacks and grant two actions. Now Dash can gain a focus, barrel roll, be granted a target lock action, then be granted a focus action, then PTL to boost! 5 effective actions in one round."

XWingTMG,3d9cmm,Shgrizz,2,Tue Jul 14 15:26:35 2015 UTC,"Yep, this works.  A similar setup is Ysanne Isard triggers (free evade action) which means you can PTL at the start of the combat phase for another action."
XWingTMG,3d9cmm,sacimino40,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:22:05 2015 UTC,"You can also get to 4 actions by using Dauntless. Green move into a bump, action, add stress, remove stress in the 'check stress' step, perform action as normal, Ysanne evade, and PTL action. Fantastic on Oicunn, but relies on being able to bump with a green move. Shouldn't be too hard with a 3 forward on a large base, and relatively low PS."
XWingTMG,3d9cmm,Shgrizz,2,Tue Jul 14 16:35:15 2015 UTC,This isnt legal. Dauntless allows you to do 1 a free action when bumping. Yes you clear the stress with a green move but you would not be able to do your normal action as you just bumped. Everything else is right.
XWingTMG,3d9cmm,sacimino40,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:00:07 2015 UTC,You're quite right! Still learning. I forget that dauntless just mitigates the problem of losing your action from bumping. Thanks for the correction.

XWingTMG,3d8z7r,KKor13,3,Tue Jul 14 12:59:27 2015 UTC,I'd say the aces packs. They're less dependent on upgrades from other packs.
XWingTMG,3d8z7r,Mttstrks,3,Tue Jul 14 13:19:12 2015 UTC,"Either choice is solid to start out with. The Aces packs will let you get more total ships on the board, which can be nice. I'd say if you want more complexity/variety in your squad building and flying, go for the aces. If you want simpler builds for new players, go for the Falcon and Slave 1. Beyond that, just go for whichever has ships you and your friends liked from the movies or something like that."
XWingTMG,3d8z7r,EdgeOfDreams,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:34:14 2015 UTC,"What this guy said. Also, possibly, the Large Ships are more iconic so might entice more people to try it?"
XWingTMG,3d8z7r,Nomnomnicon,2,Tue Jul 14 13:40:00 2015 UTC,"I'd go for the two large ships since you seem to be the one supplying, this would be a better way to give both sides a decent amount of choice I guess. Otherwise you're favoring one faction over the other. Just my opinion though.  EDIT: Wait, I just realized you meant both the aces packs, not just one, sorry. In that case, both are good. I see your conundrum."
XWingTMG,3d8z7r,Chozo_Hybrid,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:01:41 2015 UTC,"You see my plight haha. Getting both aces gives me more ships for our planned 2v2 games but let's face it, the Millennium Falcon and Slave I are bad ass. Sigh"
XWingTMG,3d8z7r,mxzf,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:12:08 2015 UTC,"As I commented another place, buying them from online retailers is somewhat cheaper if you're willing to wait for shipping.  For $110 you can get Core+both aces+Falcon+Slave I.  Might be worth it if you really want all four of those expansions."
XWingTMG,3d8z7r,mxzf,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:29:18 2015 UTC,I'm in Canada unfortunately so for all 3 for me it would equal out to $100
XWingTMG,3d8z7r,Shgrizz,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:32:48 2015 UTC,"Ah, you're right, that does pose a problem.  Free shipping is only inside the US, so it costs like $40-50 to ship things to Canada from those sites.  Unless you have a friend in the states and you visit each other, there's not a ton you can do about that.  In that case, I'd just get the core+aces.  Large ships are nice, but for smaller games, especially 2v2, more ships is more important."
XWingTMG,3d8z7r,mxzf,2,Tue Jul 14 14:40:14 2015 UTC,"Personally, I'd say both aces packs. Gives you great variety and as has been said, you'll be less likely to have to proxy stuff. And it's my opinion that small ships are more fun to fly than big ones, and it forces you to learn how to maneuver accurately. I would recommend venturing into big bases when you've got the basics down. Have fun, fly casual!"
XWingTMG,3d8z7r,krenzalore,2,Tue Jul 14 14:00:52 2015 UTC,"I'd go with the aces personally.  They bring more ships to the table, so you have more to work with and you aren't fielding the exact same fleet of ships every single game.  Also, if you're not in a hurry to get the stuff and are willing to wait for shipping, you can buy them from an online seller like CoolStuff Inc or Miniature Market.  CSI/MM sell ships for 66% of MSRP with free shipping on orders over $100.  So for $100 with them you can get Core, both aces (or two large ship) and another 2-3 sets with the $30 remaining.    Personally I'd get Core+both aces and either Falcon+TIE Defender or Slave I+E-Wing (Defender an E-Wing are on the heavy end of small ships, so they match up ok against a larger ship)."
XWingTMG,3d8z7r,leewardstyle,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:27:34 2015 UTC,What about combining both choices and getting the Falcon and the imperial aces? Thoughts?
XWingTMG,3d8doq,oitf04,1 point,Tue Jul 14 08:38:34 2015 UTC,"45 minute matches heavily favor big fat ships.  If you end up going against Hans and Dashes, all the'll need to do is pick off one or two Ties while they sit in their heavy duty shielded ships and not lose any points.  Because you've got so many ships, each turn is going to go slower, which means you may only get 6 or 7 rounds in an entire match.  I'd reccomend more hull on fewer ships."
XWingTMG,3d8doq,Thopterthallid,1 point,Tue Jul 14 09:49:25 2015 UTC,"I have another list I was thinking of: Chewie, Biggs and Garven, where the basic idea was to minimise the damage taken by using Biggs, with R2 F2 and hidden behind the Falcon's tactical jammer, and then with Draw Their Fire Chewie would soak up any remaining crits. I haven't had much luck with the list yet: I need much more practice flying them all in formation and keeping Biggs hidden. Do you think this may be more suited for 45 minutes?"
XWingTMG,3d8doq,LazyG,1 point,Tue Jul 14 11:29:11 2015 UTC,"If it is friendly, ask if you can proxy the raider upgrades for the Tie Advanced. An accuracy corrector is free and an Advanced Targeting Comp is one point. Either is good. ATC requires you to get the lock but with vader that si not so hard, while Accuracy Corrector makes Darth a super reliable hitter.   AC is free, or you can drop a Tie for the ATC. Four ties can be interestign anyway as you can take 4x Obsidian, so youa re PS3, move after other swarms and avoid the Predator double reroll, and have 7 points left, which could say give two stealth devices and still have a 1pt init bid. Or even Howlrunner and 3 obsidians, or even Dark Curse, Backstabber, Night Beast and an academy :)."

XWingTMG,3d8doq,starslinger72,1 point,Tue Jul 14 12:58:04 2015 UTC,"This list is not seriously lacking firepower.  You get that tie swarm into range 1 and most things will die to it.  Dont sell a 5 pack of tie fighters short, they can do a silly amount of damage and things like 3P0 or having a focus doesn't mean as much when you shoot 5 times."

XWingTMG,3d6754,leewardstyle,2,Tue Jul 14 01:28:22 2015 UTC,Yep. We have a really active boardgame environment so I have plenty to occupy me but I really miss the weekly casual play we had going. Maybe when wave 7 hits it will pick up some. FFG needs to do more than two releases a year. Too long between waves in my opinion.
XWingTMG,3d8k8q,Thopterthallid,8,Tue Jul 14 10:05:40 2015 UTC,"The problem is not dice, it is dial and lack of boost/roll."
XWingTMG,3d8k8q,LazyG,4,Tue Jul 14 10:38:59 2015 UTC,"I hate everyone saying this.  This is not a problem at all, It has a 6 or 7 out of 10 for a dial.  It doesn't have hard 1 turns or a 5 straight but does have a 1 forward.  Simply put, learn to fly them better, every ship is not supposed to be a re positioning ship and if you wanted it to do that then take an engine upgrade for it.  X-wings currently suffer the defender issue, which is the masses have heard someone say they are bad and therefore they are bad, better not play them.  All the while there are good players that are showing up in top 8 performances at regionals all over the place with both ships.   TLDR:  If your X-wing isn't doing as well as you want it, learn to fly it better, don't cry for a fix."
XWingTMG,3d8k8q,starslinger72,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:57:29 2015 UTC,"I feel it's more like... X-Wings are missing some spark, something exciting that makes them not necessiarily better, but stand out.  A-Wings have double elite talents that lead to exciting combos and the refit in case you want to go cheap.  B-Wings are hard hitting and hardy, any have tons of options with cannons, multiple torp slots, tricks thanks to systems and even crew options.  Y-Wings now have bombs, an awesome BTL option, and 360 turrets. Z-95s are effective swarms with the best ordinance (missile) type for opening round salvos.  Torpedoes are questionable in usefulness with only 1 torp slot.  Astromechs are neat, but don't especially change the way X-Wings perform.  Otherwise, X-Wings are just well rounded... there's nothing that makes people excited to play them, and almost every other ship has something special that really defines their role.  I think that's what people want FFG to introduce, something to define their role and own it."
XWingTMG,3d8k8q,3rd_Charmer,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:06:59 2015 UTC,"The dial isn't the biggest issue with their movement.  A B-Wing dial isn't great.  It's actually kind of bad.  But then you add the barrel roll and system slot, and it ends up more agile on the table than the X-Wing.    Intended?  No, probably not.  But it's a fact.  It's not just people taking, X-Wings do not perform unless you are massively better than your opponent.  If you're that much better, you should play better people."
XWingTMG,3d8k8q,Angerman5000,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:35:35 2015 UTC,"Except that this isn't true at all.  X-wings show up in multiple regional winning squads, as well as many more top 8 regional squads.  I refuse to believe that those players, while they are good, are massively better than their opponents especially when I know most of them."
XWingTMG,3d8k8q,starslinger72,0,Wed Jul 15 20:41:09 2015 UTC,"I agree with this. People really fixate on it being 1-2 points ""overcosted"", when points efficiency is calculated a very specific way, but a single squad point just doesn't matter that much to me, especially since I don't want to spam all of one ship anyways. B-wings are better at some things, but X-wings are better at others, and I see them do well even if they aren't super popular or the single best ship.  I would still love to see more X-wing pilots and astromechs and stuff, just because new stuff is cool and X-wings are cool and might as well have more reasons to fly them. But arguments about them sucking don't hold much water for me."
XWingTMG,3d8k8q,MythicalMothman,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:26:05 2015 UTC,"While their movement is decidedly... staid,  4 Ddice would go a long way to relieving some of that by way of making the shots you do find count more, and making it easier to slow-roll because your shots are still effective at R3."
XWingTMG,3d8k8q,Barzhac,2,Tue Jul 14 11:30:32 2015 UTC,"Id definitely like to see something different than fixing the dial. We just got that for Ties anyways and it would be boring to see all ships slowly adhere to a specific dial type to be competitive. I am not as epic into Star Wars lore as most people here, but I keep hearing people talk about S-foils. Perhaps it could be a sweet ass mod that gives them a Slam action + boost? Make them more mobile without fixing the dial and allow for some odd hit and run tactics (Slam seems silly, but hey. Someone will figure it out lol)  Would adding 4 dice be too good in reference to kicking out generic B-wings in terms of efficiency though? Just worried about a power creep. Range 1 bonus extended into at least range 2 might make more sense? Hmm..."
XWingTMG,3d8k8q,Blackxp,2,Tue Jul 14 12:10:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah, 4 dice wouldn't work mechanically or thematically. The only ship with natural 4 attack dice at the moment is the phantom, which is an incredibly situational, glass cannon sort of ship. Not only would 4 dice on an X-wing be too powerful, it would also make many rebel ships redundant - why take arc dodging a wings or tanky b wings when you can just point your X-wings at anything and kill it? Ffg fixes tend to be a lot more nuanced."
XWingTMG,3d8k8q,Shgrizz,1 point,Tue Jul 14 12:20:41 2015 UTC,it would work thematically!! it has four guns!

XWingTMG,3d8k8q,Shgrizz,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:01:44 2015 UTC,should the defender have 3 laser cannon dice and 3 ion cannon dice?? I'd be happy with that.

XWingTMG,3d8k8q,Shgrizz,7,Tue Jul 14 22:49:29 2015 UTC,"4 dice would be too much IMO. Look at the Heavy Laser Cannon, FFG values that four dice attack at 7 points. The X Wing is a bit over costed, but not that much."
XWingTMG,3d8k8q,MysteriousRacer_X,2,Tue Jul 14 12:52:50 2015 UTC,FFG values that at 7 because of the 4 dice and the no extra green at range 3.
XWingTMG,3d8k8q,Athole,3,Tue Jul 14 14:38:57 2015 UTC,It also has a downside of not rolling crits.
XWingTMG,3d8k8q,scuff,5,Tue Jul 14 17:37:00 2015 UTC,"Imo, the biggest single problem is that the Bwings, especially the Blue squad, are too cheap. For 22 points the thing is superior to the equivalent points going to an X-Wing. The reason X-Wings are really suffering is because the B-wing  is underpriced."
XWingTMG,3d8k8q,Tervlon,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:58:17 2015 UTC,I've been saying this for a long time.  B wing and z95 are too cheap for what they bring to the table. The x wing is fine at 21 for a rookie. It's a great ship.

There's no list that's paying 21 points for a rookie X-Wing that would not be improved by paying 22 points for a blue B-Wing or 24 points for two Z-95 Headhunters.

XWingTMG,3d8k8q,Neuvost,2,Tue Jul 14 19:13:06 2015 UTC,"In a game called ""Xwing"" they are very limited in their play outside of some efficient combos(Tarn + R7, etc). The B is a better jouster for the points and can barrel roll and take systems upgrades and now crew. The Z is better for low cost Rebel swarms. The High PS Xwings are not arc dodgers and are limited in their role because of that. People just want to see the Xwing brought back into the meta with some kind of title. What that title should do is a topic of much debate as others have illustrated in posts on this thread..."
XWingTMG,3d8k8q,TychoSean,2,Tue Jul 14 18:29:56 2015 UTC,"You know what they need, people playing them.  There are people that have had constant success with them, and are currently doing well in the meta.  If more people played them we would see them show up even more.   Tie swarms are not played much anymore either, is that because they are now not as powerful as before or because people got bored of playing the same style list for 3 years?"

In the hands of a master, that list is still elite. None of the top 10 builds had an Xwing(not to say it isn't possible, just not popular at the moment with High PS, turret or arc dodger meta)..."
XWingTMG,3d8k8q,TychoSean,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:16:49 2015 UTC,"the 97 man wisc regional was won with an X-wing as well as having a dual X-wing list in the top 8.  When people that know how to play them play them, they still finish at the top!"

Biggs and Wedge both are unique and good for their own reasons, along many other xwing pilots. I dont play competitively, but the discussion is not so much these pilots but the generics, right?  Fitting a solid 5 into a build would definitely be nice. 19 also opens up the option of running a squad leader at 24 points too.   Or are named pilots hurting too? I don't play competitively unfortunately. Wedgealwaysseems to wreck face when he can."
XWingTMG,3d8k8q,Blackxp,4,Tue Jul 14 13:39:20 2015 UTC,"The problem is that some named pilots do ok, those named pilots are the ONLY ones that do well.    And we can't really make the X-Wing tankier (or Biggs and Luke would be broken) or have it do more damage (lest Wedge be broken).  What it really needs is some kind of overall agility buff.   ATM it's not efficient enough to be a good jouster, but it's also not agile enough to be a good arc-dodger.  It needs enough agility to put it into the middle of those two categories, with enough agility to dodge arcs sometimes, but point-efficient enough to go head to head at times too."

XWingTMG,3d8k8q,Blackxp,2,Tue Jul 14 13:24:07 2015 UTC,There is an upgrade that allows X-Wings to make a four dice attack: Proton Torpedoes.
XWingTMG,3d8k8q,playnwin,2,Tue Jul 14 11:51:44 2015 UTC,Yeah but ordinance is so finicky. It is a one off where as this would allow the X-Wing to throw more dice more often.
XWingTMG,3d8k8q,Th3GingerHitman,2,Tue Jul 14 11:57:06 2015 UTC,It's a shame that ordnance isn't viable. (Yet.) But I don't think that the X-Wing needs four red inherit (that's the Phantom's trick). Maybe a free barrel roll title?
XWingTMG,3d8k8q,playnwin,3,Tue Jul 14 12:03:40 2015 UTC,"If X-Wings get barrel roll, and A-Wings still can't I would be a little upset.  I agree they need something, but high-end X-Wings can take Expert Handling to gain a barrel roll and drop a TL in one move."
XWingTMG,3d8k8q,T-Minus9,1 point,Tue Jul 14 12:15:15 2015 UTC,"I don't think X-wings will get a boost or barrel roll, otherwise I think the Kihraxz fighter would have likely come out with it too.  I suspect a point reduction or X-wing only upgrade."
XWingTMG,3d8k8q,Enervata,3,Tue Jul 14 20:10:30 2015 UTC,"The problem with coming up with an X-Wing title is that there are so many named pilots with varying levels of useful abilities, it would be incredibly tough to balance whatever title you gave them against all the abilities."
XWingTMG,3d8k8q,Th3GingerHitman,2,Tue Jul 14 12:46:45 2015 UTC,"I think an X-wing fix would likely involve bringing the perceived cost of the ship down.  I would expect points deduction similar to the TIE Advanced.  I could also see them coming out with X-wing specific upgrades like they did with the TIE Advanced.  I think doing both of these things would potentially bring back the X-wing and fit with the flavor of the ship.  T-65 X-Wing  X-Wing only. Title.  If you equip an (astromech) upgrade, its squad point cost is reduced by 1 (to a minimum of 0).  EDIT: Reduced point value from 4 to 1 to communicate the point better.  R6 Astromech  X-Wing only. Astromech. 5 points  When attacking with your primary weapon, if you have a target lock on the defender, you may increase your attack by 1."
XWingTMG,3d8k8q,Enervata,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:25:37 2015 UTC,"The problem with that is, the awesome astromechs like r2-d2 become auto includes!  There would be 2, maybe 3 droids that would see play."
XWingTMG,3d8k8q,Theepum7,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:30:58 2015 UTC,"Was using the astromech as an example to illustrate a point (I'll adjust the point reduction since I did make it steep).  It looks like FFG feels that the X-wing is close to where it needs to be, since they released a near clone of it (Kihraxz).  I think the x-wing specific astromech is still valid, but the title could just as easily be something simple like this:  T-65 X-wing  X-wing only. Title. -1 point.  This card has a negative squad point cost."
XWingTMG,3d8k8q,Enervata,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:08:42 2015 UTC,"Exactly this.  Now your X-wings get R3A2, R2D2 and R5P9 for free.    There are already X-wing based lists doing really well in the current regional scene and now you are just giving them free points to be better."
XWingTMG,3d8k8q,starslinger72,2,Tue Jul 14 19:02:55 2015 UTC,"4 attack dice on an X-wing would be absurd for the cost.  Now a rookie that has more HP than a Sigma and costs 4 points less.  Hell drop a shield upgrade on them to make it even points, which would you rather have?  PS 3 Sigma or a PS 2 rookies with shield upgrade and 4 red dice."
XWingTMG,3d8k8q,starslinger72,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:59:19 2015 UTC,"One thing I wonder about is how well an unusual barrel roll might work.  Maybe a 2-distance barrel roll, or a 1-bank one.  Something to give it maneuverability and a bit of a different twist compared to other ships."
XWingTMG,3d8k8q,mxzf,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:27:46 2015 UTC,"I've been thinking on this and it almost feels like... X-Wings could use TWO astromech slots.  Here me out:  The big unique thing on the X-Wing is an astromech slot. It adds some great options, but in truth only a handful of droids are used and only on specific ships. Almost nobody uses the handy R2 droid on them because there's always a better fit for the named pilot, and then it makes it hard to fly the X-Wing with much stress as its green moves are so few and low in speed.  What if we had a title that was like 'Droid Interface'? It would cost 1 or 2 points, and allow you to equip two astromechs to the ship as long as the second was non-unique?  Think of it like the unique astromech is now able to do more thanks to improved communication with the pilot. Now R2-D2 can use more then simple 1 banks and straights to recover shields. Wedge could use the boost/target lock droid with PTL and the use the generic R2 to ditch the stress, maximising his attacks without adding more die.  We just don't have enough generic droids to mix it up much more at the moment, but just an idea to toss out there."
XWingTMG,3d8k8q,3rd_Charmer,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:07:00 2015 UTC,"I thought of this too, but there are probably too many combinations to test for broken interactions that would potentially limit what FFG could create for new astromechs in the future."
XWingTMG,3d8k8q,Enervata,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:14:46 2015 UTC,"Another astromech idea might be something to boost ordnance, actually - maybe either one that drops the point cost or helps with the action economy, or both - maybe something like ""Reduce the squad point cost of an equipped [Torpedo] card by 1, to a minimum of 0.  After you spend a blue Target Lock token, you may acquire another Target Lock on the same enemy."" or something like ""At the beginning of the combat phase, you may acquire a target lock on an enemy within your firing arc."" to help low-skilled pilots shoot torpedoes.  As a bonus, these could help the Y-wing in particular as torpedo carriers."
XWingTMG,3d8k8q,bakereasy,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:39:20 2015 UTC,To me it just doesn't fit very well with cannon.  Either a title cost that lowered the astromech cost by 1 or just make some decent astromechs with a cost 0 would have a better feel to me.  I can't think of any X-wings (or Y-wings) in the movies that didn't have an astromech.

Not leaving tournaments at 100 points so the meta becomes obsessed with a miserly race to the bottom? Not deciding that any ship fixes would be in the form of upgrade cards sold in additional expansion packs, in a naked cash grab that would make even Games Workshop ashamed?

XWingTMG,3d53pl,quinntessence23,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:46:43 2015 UTC,"I'm actually not sure this is the case. We know it has a 3-turn and a white/green 3-bank.   The 3-turn was used as the SLAM maneuver, so we know it's on the dial. However, I'm not 100% yet whether SLAM maneuvers can give/remove stress - they might effectively all be white because during the activation phase ""check stress"" is the specific step in which stress is assigned/removed due to maneuver colors, and it happens between the maneuver and the action. It's separate. Do we have something suggesting that SLAM is any different from Daredevil and Inertial Dampers, which have to assign stress independently from the maneuver?"
XWingTMG,3d53pl,rsixidor,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:50:01 2015 UTC,"Interesting speculation.  I doubt they'd allow it, honestly. That would be interesting, though. It would fit with the the idea of what SLAM is as well."
XWingTMG,3d53pl,quinntessence23,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:23:53 2015 UTC,"Like I said, Daredevil and Inertial Dampers are my foundation here - I've seen a lot of speculation that Daredevil specifically had to be errata'd because it didn't actually give stress like it was supposed to. IF that's true, then we should be able to slam a red maneuver without getting stress - at the cost of needing an upgrade to take an action, only being able to do it after taking a different maneuver of the same speed, and not getting to shoot that round. It sounds pretty balanced for me, even for K-turns. For a 3-turn? that's definitely balanced. The only reason I'd hesitate to say this would be balanced with a K-turn is running up to someone and K-turning to drop a mine on them with Adv SLAM. And even that sounds like it'd be pretty fair on a ship as pricey as a K-wing will be for its attack."

FFG put a lot of munitions options in this game, like the Decimator's torpedo or bomb options or the Slave I's torpedo, that I've never seen filled.

XWingTMG,3d53pl,AffixBayonets,3,Mon Jul 13 23:14:36 2015 UTC,"Miranda Doni should almost always use Twin Laser Turret. With it, you can regenerate a shield, and you still get two attacks, one at two dice and one at three, with which you can try to sneak some damage in. Then, if you find yourself within Range ""1,"" don’t be afraid to have Miranda Doni spend a shield to perform a four-die primary attack!   This is legal? Huh, I hadn't thought of Doni with TLT — I was thinking of using this effect with Gunner instead. It's still not all that impressive as the first attack probably won't get through, but I guess the K has a real use for the TLT instead of passing it straight from the box to Horton Salm.   Nothing in Wave VII directly counters the strength of Han Solo or Dash Rendar turrets   :T   Even an FFG official article doesn't try to hype those new mines as being very effective against big ships.

I love flying Y's, and having a range 3 turret with high accuracy (3 dice to land 1 damage) will help a whole lot.  Y's struggle against large ships that can stay in range 3 (basically anything with boost).

In our rock-paper-scissors (turret beats arc dodger beats jouster beats turret) game, in order to make turrets weaker you need to make jousters stronger.  But not against turrets, jousters need to be stronger against arc dodgers.  Arc dodgers got a huge boost with Autothrusters, which wrecks most jousters.  By making jousters stronger against arc dodgers, it'll naturally make turrets weaker in the long run by making jousters a viable choice again."

XWingTMG,3d53pl,starslinger72,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:42:38 2015 UTC,"It's not about catching him, though, which is nice. What this wave does is give low PS ships a chance to hit Soontir before he has the chance to arc dodge.   Not as hard to predict a stationary target.   At the start of the turn, the PS 2 K Wing, especially with equipped with Bombardier and Advanced Slam, has a wide range of options with which to get in front of Soontir or similar high PS arc dodgers, forcing them to go through the mine that was just laid.   Personally, I'm going to spend a lot of time with the K Wing outside of matches, working through enemy ship placements and how to position the movement and SLAM, if necessary, to drop a bomb in front of them. Should be very very tricky to predict if done right.   Also, because of the new focus on movement, there's a chance that you will see some Enhanced Scopes for the first time like ever. I would also think that inertial dampeners will be more prevalent."

Idea behind 321 was giving soontir focus + target lock on his attacks (atleast the first one) and leaving both of Vader's actions free even on the initial encounter.   I don't know, 2x tacticians and Ion is my favorite too but after 2 turns of attacking shuttle wont be able to turn in time for another pass.

XWingTMG,3d4qx2,_Pee_Pee_,5,Mon Jul 13 16:39:39 2015 UTC,"Versatility.  With the engine, the defender has all straights and banks green which allows them to still be flexible while stressed.  Before, a stressed defender was going straight or flipping which means their field of fire was remaining very predictable.  With the engine, it adds 6 green moves and gives them four general options while stressed, doubling their versatility.   It also opens up stress-based builds to the named pilots like PTL on Rexler Brath who can TL and focus and use the TL to modify dice and save the focus for turning cards faceup; it also allows him to be even more flexible with the barrel roll option."

Next cheapest is probably the space cow at 21 pts.  Instead of the HWKs with turrets, I'd probably go with Y-Wings. A base HWK with Ion is 21pts, stopping you from running more than 4. A Y with ion and R2 Astro (1 and 2 maneuvers are green) is only 24pts, with more health and maneuverability (the HWK dial sucks), and you can fit 4 in a squad."

XWingTMG,3d6yn1,Nomnomnicon,2,Tue Jul 14 00:54:58 2015 UTC,"I use Fleet Officer in my current list for much the same effect (although I don't run a Decimator). HLC+Pred on Brath is really efficient anyway, since he can make his own crits, and it's worth noting that the re-roll from Predator can crit naturally (check the FAQ, works with HLC+TL as well). The Defender will look after itself here.  Your Decimator needs work. Do you really need the evade dice? Or can you afford to go RAC (46) + EU (4) + Fleet Officer (3)/Predator(3)/Rebel Captive(3) =53 Points. The EU can be skipped if you want one of the other 3 points upgrades and then you have the 1 left for TIE MkII on Brath. RAC is better at stripping shield, demands target focus and the options available give you some choice in how you use him.   /u/EdgeofDreams is quite right about Ysanne, and as you say stress builds are quite common. With that in mind it might be worth leaving Fleet Officer at home as well and making the Decimator much more of a blunt instrument.   If you want to keep the build exactly the same but run TIE MkII on Brath, scrap the Tac Jammer. People will shoot the Deci anyway since it can't dodge."
XWingTMG,3d6yn1,Nomnomnicon,1 point,Tue Jul 14 08:27:37 2015 UTC,"Great response, thank you.   I'll look into your suggestions. Not sure I like the EU but I think you're right about using RAC (w/ predator). The improvement in attack efficiency outweighs any benefits from the agility die or Tac Jammer.  Could also bring Vader instead of predator, but I'd be worried about getting the decimator killed too quickly."
XWingTMG,3d6yn1,scuff,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:52:23 2015 UTC,"I run Vader on my competitive Decimator but don't rapid-fire him out for exactly the reason you name. I'd rather get an important crit or final blow on an opponent's ship than just get extra damage.   EU gives your the extra distance you need to chase and stay within Range 1-2 for RAC's ability or allows you to convincingly arc dodge or turn quickly to surprise your opponent. Not necessary, but I find it really helps. Up to you though, points can be spent elsewhere :)"

XWingTMG,3d4sey,rottinguy,2,Tue Jul 14 20:01:23 2015 UTC,"False. To clear up this misunderstanding refer to the rules on ""How to move your ship"" which state that you pick up your ship, and then place it in it's new position. Nothing there about sliding it along the template.   Now look at the rules for obstacles, which state that if your template touches, or if your ship ends it's maneuver in a way that leaves it overlapping an obstacle.  Still nothing there about sliding your ship along the template.  Now I understand that as a new player you may think this is how it ""should"" work, but it is not the case. If it were it would be nearly impossible to get a large base ship between to obstacles spaced at range one apart."
XWingTMG,3d4sey,Tide89,3,Mon Jul 13 15:24:13 2015 UTC,"Nope!   If the template hits the asteroid you lose your action, roll for damage, and can't shoot.  If when you put down the base at the other end of the template and your base is touching the asteroid, do the same.  If your template doesn't touch the asteroid and you can put your base down at the end of the template without touching the asteroid you're all golden."
XWingTMG,3d4sey,antigrapist,7,Mon Jul 13 15:06:10 2015 UTC,"One minor correction, if the template hits but your final position is clear of the asteroid then you can still shoot. The only time you can't is when you're parked on a rock."
XWingTMG,3d4sey,antigrapist,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:08:51 2015 UTC,"Thanks. Took me a seperate post and a bit of time to understand lost actions vs shots when parking/hitting asteroids. I'm clear on that now.  Just to make sure I'm reading the reply correctly though (as MightyPope below seems to disagree and has also been upvoted), you DO need to slide the ship along the template to make sure of clipping, correct? In which case, my opponent had it right."
XWingTMG,3d4sey,OrangeKnight87,3,Mon Jul 13 15:11:48 2015 UTC,"No, the only thing that matters is the template itself. One way to think about it is that they're flying in space and the ships can turn into their side to avoid hitting things."
XWingTMG,3d4sey,Tide89,2,Mon Jul 13 15:19:00 2015 UTC,You do NOT need to slide the ship along. The only time you do not simply place the ship at the end of the template is if doing so would cause you to overlap another ship.  In that case you would slide backwards from the end until you no longer overlap.   For all other situations you simply place your ship at the end of the maneuver template. If the template itself touches the obstacle then you are penalized as previously mentioned but no need to check for clipping.
XWingTMG,3d4sey,AffixBayonets,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:19:17 2015 UTC,"Nope, he's just said the same thing I did except he's put it in simpler way.   It only triggers if the movement template touches the asteroid, i.e. the thin track, not inclusive of the size of ship you're maneuvering, during your movement OR if you go to put down the base of your ship and the actual base of your ship is overlapping at that point.  You basically pick up your ship at the start of movement and then place it at the end of the template."

XWingTMG,3d2kzr,Rambr,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:42:46 2015 UTC,I believe the other adrenal overload would be easier to pull off with the auxiliary arc at a full 180 degrees of effective stressy doom.

XWingTMG,3d2kzr,ImTheRhino,3,Mon Jul 13 03:49:42 2015 UTC,"Ahhh that's what I was thinking but thought I would ask.  So if you deal out the 2 stress token, that means the player has to perform a single green move to remove both stress tokens, or do they need to do 2 green moves?  I'm thinking it needs to be 2 green moves as the rule book says when you perform a green move, you remove one stress token.  Thanks!"
XWingTMG,3d2kzr,boredompwndu,3,Mon Jul 13 04:05:06 2015 UTC,"2 greens. When you perform a green maneuver, you remove a stress. Only ion moves remove all their relevant tokens. (Ion moves are white, and remove all their ion tokens)"
XWingTMG,3d2kzr,Alaknar,2,Mon Jul 13 04:08:42 2015 UTC,"Wait... Was there a change in the rules? I haven't played in a while and only have the original rule book and, according to that, ion tokens get reset at the end of the turn. All of them, automatically."
XWingTMG,3d2kzr,CircleTheFire,1 point,Mon Jul 13 07:51:50 2015 UTC,"On a small base ship, all ion tokens are removed after the mandatory 1 white forward.   On a large base ship, ion tokens are not cleared until it has received at least 2 ion tokens and then done a mandatory 1 white forward the next turn.   Essentially, you don't clear ion tokens until the ship has made the mandatory 1 white forward. Small ships taken one ion to get ironed. Large ships take 2."

XWingTMG,3d45sp,DangerFord,2,Mon Jul 13 14:37:41 2015 UTC,In a perfect world I think these HWKs would go for a one-two punch.    Double stress target at range 2  Next turn their maneuvers are limited so dogpile them and use autoblaster turrets

XWingTMG,3d41ce,_Axe_,2,Mon Jul 13 10:16:54 2015 UTC,"You'll probably not want engine on Garven, as he wants to take the Focus action as often as he can. Outmaneuver is interesting on Etahn- makes him a good flanker.  However, you've got Lone Wolf on Ten, which is a more typical flanker EPT.  Having two flankers means that neither may end up being flankers as you need a main attack to keep the enemy's attention.  Also, I'm less sure about Lone Wolf on a B-wing, as rolling on defense isn't super critical, and you've already got FCS.  Still, the synergy concept is heading in a good direction.  Another way to get Ten's ability to trigger is Mangler cannon, allowing you to drop Etahn (if you want to go full Synergy, Dutch would add control and TL's to Garvin's Focuses) or free up Etahn for more of the flanker role. Just be aware that three small ship named Rebel Synergy is not a strong archetype at the tournament level."
XWingTMG,3d41ce,-Earthworm-,1 point,Tue Jul 14 04:00:42 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the valid feedback. I'll look further into it.  I'll get rid of the EU as I want Garven's focus to pass on to the Etahn as much as possible so I can use my actions on TL or maneuver into a better position.  I'm hoping the B-wing will draw the enemy in as an ""easy target"", but want to make it durable enough to last at least 2 rounds of combat while it can mess up the opponents ranks. Lone Wolf does not seem completely useless as you can only have a TL on one ship even if it is not always within arc.  The hits turning into uncancelled crits should mean that Ties could quickly fall to this damage output. That was the main idea in this build, but as you point out, it does lack against non-swarm lists."

XWingTMG,3d2x3g,boredompwndu,2,Mon Jul 13 03:52:46 2015 UTC,"Basically, yes. Here' the deal. I run around with Homing missiles, because they cost 5 pts and give me flexibility. I decide, now seeing my opponent is a swarm player, those homing missiles are now assault missiles. Or what If I'm rocking a decimator, and you pop up with now some cluster missiles. As your opponent I'd be rightfully pissed the missiles, bombs, or torperdos are now different and do different things."
XWingTMG,3d2x3g,Shgrizz,2,Mon Jul 13 04:06:40 2015 UTC,I understand what the upgrade does.  I've had this discussion.  You're just describing the function of this card.  Why are you pissed that the ordnance have changed if I have to declare what missiles I'm running at the start of the game? Is sacrificing a Torpedo slot and one point not enough?  I know that I'd be hard-pressed to feel good about running essentially 6-point Cluster missiles on more than one ship.
XWingTMG,3d2x3g,mikodz,3,Mon Jul 13 04:24:22 2015 UTC,"It just takes away a lot of the tactics involved in selecting specific ordnance for a list aiming to specialise in one task. Feels a little cheap, and there's no real counter when your opponent just picks whatever ordnance will mess you up the most."
XWingTMG,3d2x3g,ShuggaCheez,2,Mon Jul 13 07:03:49 2015 UTC,I'd say the counter is the price of ordnance. It's not exactly correctly costed.
XWingTMG,3d2x3g,mikodz,-1,Mon Jul 13 09:53:47 2015 UTC,"It makes no sense... Lets say an B-Wing magically drops his missles and Torps appear form Void and attach themselves ? Maybe lets make a card that allows to ""magically"" exchange ship Modifications ? Coz u know, i want Autothrusters for turrets but it might be good to get Shield upgrade later...  can i haz that :P ?"
XWingTMG,3d2x3g,ShuggaCheez,2,Mon Jul 13 11:31:42 2015 UTC,"While I agree with many of the comments about play-testing/point-costing, the idea is solid and it would help make ordinance more viable.  I bothers me that ordinance, for the most part, ends up being non-viable in competitive play, as I feel it is a missed opportunity and a fun part of Star Wars ship combat lore. Many CCG or miniature games allow for ""side-decking"" based on what your opponent brings to the table. In a sense, this makes the game less a random rock-paper-scissors, and increases the utility of ships that can bring ordinance.  Just curious, did you take into account the new Wave 7 ordinance upgrades when drafting this card?"
XWingTMG,3d2x3g,mikodz,1 point,Mon Jul 13 13:32:44 2015 UTC,"Not initially, but we did discover that a K-wing with this, extra munitions and even one high-points missile was pretty nuts.  We weren't 100% decided on whether we thought that was a good thing or not, because it still didn't seem like it made the list as viable as, say, morbidly obese Han."
XWingTMG,3d2x3g,ShuggaCheez,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:51:43 2015 UTC,I really don't understand why FFG didn't make ordinance able to be fired 360 degrees from the very start. This would have made it way more viable for everything and would have diluted turrets back to a more balanced level.

XWingTMG,3d2x3g,ShuggaCheez,2,Mon Jul 13 11:38:01 2015 UTC,You do realize that he came out after the core set right? They'd have never made the abilities the exact same if the rules were different.

XWingTMG,3d2x3g,ShuggaCheez,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:41:03 2015 UTC,I'll answer your response one more time with the exact same statement as last time: if FFG made rockets and torpedoes have 360 firing radius then the rules and abilities of pilots would have been written very differently from what they are. The game would've been structured in such a way as to make the ability not overpowered.
XWingTMG,3d2x3g,mikodz,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:04:23 2015 UTC,"To be fair, they could have entirely avoided 360 ordnance because it would be innately over powered. It's extremely difficult to play a what if game about ordnance from the core set onwards."
XWingTMG,3d2x3g,krenzalore,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:12:17 2015 UTC,"I don't think it is overpowered though. There would still be range restrictions on ordinance, each ship would still be able to carry very limited amounts so a player would only shoot them maybe once or twice a round, and you'd still need target locks so that's an action gone right there. Even with minor rules changes it would work."
XWingTMG,3d2x3g,ShuggaCheez,-1,Tue Jul 14 11:15:55 2015 UTC,"Yes, lets rewrite the entire game around missles :D ALso lets forget about all movies/books in which noone ever shoots ordnance in a 360 radius. But hey, lets do this :D FFG we demand u rewrite entire game :P"

But, if you want to throw out examples from the movies then plenty of the prequel dogfighting scenes have lock-on missiles and such.   My point is that sacrificing game quality to appease fans isn't always a smart option. Every new player I've tried to introduce the game to (some being huge SW fans) are always confused about why they can target lock 360 but not fire their ordinance. It immediately makes them dislike ordinance and they never use it again (which is exactly where we are with the game right now)."
XWingTMG,3d2x3g,krenzalore,1 point,Tue Jul 14 11:38:52 2015 UTC,"I agree ordnance needs fixing.  However, for gameplay reasons I am not too happy with the concept of 360 ordnance. We have enough people complaining about turrets as it is. Manuevering your ship would become much less important if ordnance was 360 and X-wing is a dog-fighting game."
XWingTMG,3d2x3g,mahthyoo,1 point,Tue Jul 14 12:16:54 2015 UTC,I get it. I just disagree that being able to take one or two 360 shots out of maybe 10-15 that a ship fires in a round is the same thing as a turret ship that takes ALL of its shots at 360. Positioning would still be important with 360 ordinance.  What if you choose to fly lazy and just rely on the missle but then it misses? Now you really aren't lined up to dogfight and probably have someone on your tail.   I mean we already have a b-wing with the 360 ordinance ability and it isn't exactly wrecking any meta. People barely use it from what I can tell.
XWingTMG,3d2x3g,FishBroom,1 point,Tue Jul 14 12:21:36 2015 UTC,"You're right about Nera Dantels. She is a B-wing with 360 ordnance. I think you've convinced me that it could work, with some caveats."
XWingTMG,3d2x3g,mahthyoo,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:22:44 2015 UTC,"While this solves one part of the reasons why no one brings ordnance (because many of them are specialized for particular targets and playstyles). However, the underlying reason being cost is still unaddressed."
XWingTMG,3d2x3g,_Axe_,1 point,Mon Jul 13 11:44:34 2015 UTC,"What this upgrade will do is create skew in lists. Skew is where a particular list has some exploitable weakness, and this will increase the number of times they encounter the specific counter.  It certainly makes under-powered munitions better (but do we want to fix them this way?)  The real question is, do we want skew in x-wing? Many games do very well with a lot of skew (Magic, Warmachine) but it fundamentally changes how you approach list construction."
XWingTMG,3d2x3g,krenzalore,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:52:06 2015 UTC,"Agreed 100%.  I think it's good, especially since Ordnance is currently pretty underused and it doesn't look like Wave VII is going to change that meaningfully, but it's a pretty serious change to existing matchups since you really can't ignore it as a possibility."

XWingTMG,3d15ua,dbl_dbl,7,Sun Jul 12 17:41:59 2015 UTC,"General buying guide: https://www.reddit.com/r/XWingTMG/wiki/faq/buying  X-Wing is definitely one of the easiest miniatures games to learn and relatively cheap to buy into as well.  If you're providing ships for yourself and also friends, and you're getting a Millennium Falcon, I highly recommend the Slave 1 as an Imperial ship for the other side. They're probably the two best large-base ships for beginners, and they're iconic and recognizable to even casual Star Wars fans.  My buying guide linked to above has most of my advice for new players, at least as far as shopping for ships goes. Setting a budget for yourself is not a bad idea, since it's easy to end up buying more ships than you can expect to get around to flying any time soon."
XWingTMG,3d15ua,EdgeOfDreams,3,Sun Jul 12 18:01:43 2015 UTC,"That was super useful, I really, really appreciate it!  Now I don't know what to do, there are so many ways to go. Definitely playing casual so I might just pick some interesting looking ships and go for it."
XWingTMG,3d15ua,EdgeOfDreams,2,Sun Jul 12 18:17:20 2015 UTC,"Glad I could help!   pick some interesting looking ships and go for it   That's pretty much what I did starting out. For casual play, it's pretty hard to buy the ""wrong"" ships."
XWingTMG,3d15ua,EdgeOfDreams,3,Sun Jul 12 18:33:36 2015 UTC,"Can I run my buy list by you?   1x Core 1x B Wing 1x Millenium Falcon 1x Headhunter 1x TIE Advanced 1x Imperial Aces 1x Slave 1   I've put a little aside in the budget to also get:   1x Rebel Aces 1x Core Set   The only reason I don't get them all now is because they only have 1 Core and no Rebel Aces in stock, and I am using store credit. What do you think? I am just looking for a fun assortment to try with my buddies. Is that somewhat balanced?"
XWingTMG,3d15ua,Lepre_Khan,2,Sun Jul 12 19:45:09 2015 UTC,"Seems like a fine list overall to me. The only ship there that may have some issues is the TIE Advanced, but don't worry about that yet. Once you've got the game rules down and some more experience, go look up the new TIE/x1 and Advanced Targeting Computer cards that are coming in the Imperial Raider expansion and print your own proxies for them."
XWingTMG,3d15ua,Eihve,2,Sun Jul 12 20:00:30 2015 UTC,"Consider a TIE interceptor on its own. That gives you Soontir Fel and Turr Fennir, two of the most fun pilots in the game."

Nimble ships that are fragile but numerous and speedy? Ships that let you do unconventional things to mess with your enemy? X-Wing has them all, it really depends on how you think you'll want to play"
XWingTMG,3d15ua,Suicidal_Ferret,2,Sun Jul 12 21:23:06 2015 UTC,"I am not sure. I am thinking speedy and nimble but it's hard to say. I've watched a few videos and I like how the TIE fighters play, with lots of dodging. However, I absolutely have to pick up a Falcon for the Rebel side."
XWingTMG,3d15ua,zap1000x,2,Mon Jul 13 01:02:41 2015 UTC,"Any advice for a new player before I buy in?   Go to game store/club, ask for demo game with an experienced player."
XWingTMG,3d15ua,EdgeOfDreams,2,Mon Jul 13 02:05:16 2015 UTC,Ask to play a Furball. That's a good way to start the game.
XWingTMG,3d15ua,ragnarok-the-mic,2,Mon Jul 13 02:19:13 2015 UTC,I'd recommend a most wanted pack. 3 ships that can be used with rebel cards and are a nice blend of the two others factions plus their own dirty tricks
XWingTMG,3d0t6v,LostNight,3,Sun Jul 12 15:51:37 2015 UTC,"General buying guide: https://www.reddit.com/r/XWingTMG/wiki/faq/buying  For casual play, as long as both sides are running the same number of points, the game is pretty balanced. Since you're working with a limited number of ships, though, you might consider playing with less than the standard 100 points when playing casually with your friends, maybe 60 or 75 per side at first.  You can definitely build a valid 100 point squad for a tournament with what you've got, but it won't be particularly competitive. Just take whichever named pilots you like and load up on upgrades and you should hit 100.  Second core set is really quite optional these days. If you want maximum variety, just grab any two small ships you don't have yet.  For tournaments, I'd recommend you pick one faction, Rebel or Imperial, and either get two more small ships you like the look of or one of the big ships. One large ship + 1 or 2 small ships, all loaded up with upgrades, is a pretty common way to build a list for tournaments these days. You can't go wrong buying a Millennium Falcon, YT-2400 (Outrider), Slave 1, or Decimator for those kinds of builds, just stay away from the Lambda Shuttle until you've got a little more experience (unless you really love how it looks)."
XWingTMG,3d0t6v,EdgeOfDreams,2,Sun Jul 12 16:08:46 2015 UTC,"You can certainly build two 100 pt squadrons with what you have.   XXBB XBA + upgrades can make 100. For Imperial, two Interceptors, two Ties can also work if you use the Tie aces, but it's slightly overloading (the utility of) the fragile Tie fighters.  Two cores was mainly for the damage deck and dice (for 2 player home games) and in the days of X/Tie domination when you wanted the plastic. You no longer really need this."
XWingTMG,3d0t6v,Harpinger,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:35:43 2015 UTC,I don't understand. He can't build an XXBB unless he buys more. With what he has he can make an AXB squad of aces and that's it...

XWingTMG,3d0o7s,Torobasa,3,Sun Jul 12 15:03:56 2015 UTC,"Sure, 5 dice with tl(since you have it either way but you dont spend it) isba big attack. Big enough to scare turtled soontir or a cloacked whisper."
XWingTMG,3d0o7s,Slanesh,3,Sun Jul 12 15:08:50 2015 UTC,"On something high PS like vader who can easily get a TL+focus shot with them, they are definitely worth it. The probability of rolling 5 hits in that case is fairly high. Even against a fully turtled soontir you will almost always push through damage unless they manage to roll all focus/evade on four dice."
XWingTMG,3d0o7s,dxsio,2,Sun Jul 12 16:41:51 2015 UTC,"I think it might be worth it, because you'll have an easy time setting up a TL+Focus situation. And 5 dice with a target lock equals an estimated damage of 3,75. (crits ignored)  That said, ATC + focus equals 2,5 damage (crits ignored). So you spend 3 points toonly gain 1,25 damage on average."
XWingTMG,3d0o7s,Stetto,4,Sun Jul 12 15:39:47 2015 UTC,"As /u/dxsio pointed out, it'd be a focus + tl 5 dice attack. Puts the mean damage at 4.5 or so with a better than 70% chance of all 5 dice showing hits of some kind.   That being said, at range 1 the Advanced is rolling 3 dice. With a focus and ATC, it does 3.25 mean damage. So prockets does end up just giving a 1.25 increase in mean damage output. However, 4.5 mean damage takes you into the realms of damage output necessary to break through Soontir's Stealth Device,  so there is more to consider than just damage output."
XWingTMG,3d0o7s,forkmonkey88,1 point,Sun Jul 12 17:39:55 2015 UTC,"Oh, thanks for the correction. I missed to big things: range 1 bonus and, that you don't have to spend the focus token to make the attack."
XWingTMG,3d0o7s,Stetto,1 point,Mon Jul 13 09:04:01 2015 UTC,just a quick FYI in terms of dice odds:   Naked: 50%  Foc/TL: 75%  Foc & TL: 93.75%  EDIT: Attack Dice.
XWingTMG,3d0o7s,Winged_Gundark,1 point,Mon Jul 13 12:30:00 2015 UTC,"Absolutely.  Juno is going to be the centerpiece of a lot of my lists. ATC, PTL, EU, and Prockets.  Imagine firing Prockets with a Focus and Target Lock against a pesky B-Wing who probobly wont dodge any of it."

XWingTMG,3cyxw2,Blackxp,2,Sun Jul 12 05:02:42 2015 UTC,"Thats totally true, a backwards arc would make so much more sense then! Actually taking the panels into account then its back to exactly what the OP said, an additional rear arc (since you obviously keep your forward arc and cannot shoot through the panels). Good call haha! If it was me I would totally allow a turret anyways, who needs panels anyways! Blasted things keep getting shot off by the enemy anyways.  I also with phantom on the excitement over the sweet sweet ass. Crew slot would be CRAZY."

RAC wants to fight at R1, while Han wants to fight at range 2-3. Isard isn't countered by gunner at all, you just don't spend the token if it would let Han trigger gunner. Han does roughly ~1.4 damage a turn while RAC only does one crit a turn, assume he's in range 1-2, because Han will likewise take one damage to avoid triggering gunner.   It really comes down to who gets the worse crit and who has the most HP left after all the escorts are gone, but I think the fight is close to even with the RAC having a slight edge."

You generally don't see Fat Shuttles because even with Engine Upgrade and Advanced Sensors the Shuttle still is very easy to get behind. The 666 does have a better dial than the shuttle and it does have a nice secondary arc, but I still wouldn't put a ton of points on it if it has such a wide turn as is listed."

XWingTMG,3cx2i3,rebelcaptive,6,Sat Jul 11 15:15:00 2015 UTC,"We're missing the maneuvering fins and ion projector(?) From the yv-666, the k-wing dial, crack shot(?) Elite talent from the kihraxz, adv homing missiles from the TIE punisher, and the raider's dial and what a few people have said looks like a droid crew from the Raider. That last and the ones I marked as (?) I'm not 100% sure that's actually what the card is called, but the first two sure look like it. I think crack shot will let you discard it when attacking to cancel one of your target's evade results. Not sure on the other cards, though someone else already got the details we do know about adv homing missiles."
XWingTMG,3cx2i3,quinntessence23,1 point,Sat Jul 11 15:53:12 2015 UTC,"ion projector   I did an analysis on that card here. Tl;dr: I'm 99% sure it's similar to Anti Pursuit Lasers, but you roll 2 dice and take an ion token instead of damage."
XWingTMG,3cx2i3,darth_static,1 point,Mon Jul 13 05:16:52 2015 UTC,"nice analysis. Looks pretty likely, and would be an interesting effect."
XWingTMG,3cx2i3,quinntessence23,2,Mon Jul 13 15:49:09 2015 UTC,"Advanced Homing Missiles hasn't been fully spoiled.  Though we know it costs 3, is Range 2 and rolls 3 attack dice.  I would guess it allows you to fire outside of arc.  Which would be a pretty good Soontir stealth device stripper."
XWingTMG,3cx2i3,Glucose98,7,Sat Jul 11 15:20:00 2015 UTC,3 dice vs 4 + autothrusters wouldn't exactly be great.
XWingTMG,3cx2i3,Angerman5000,2,Sat Jul 11 16:05:30 2015 UTC,"I'm sure there is more to the card than that. Since regular homing missiles let's you keep your target lock for the attack and denies the defender use of evade tokens, I expect we'll see something similar on adv. homing missiles too. Maybe not both because of cost reduction, but it does have a strict range limit. Was the card never translated from those Spanish spoilers a few months ago?"
XWingTMG,3cx2i3,Copper_Lontra,-1,Sat Jul 11 23:01:55 2015 UTC,Good point.  To counter that I assume that it would always counts as fired in arc.

XWingTMG,3d1rc2,Thopterthallid,2,Sun Jul 12 21:11:10 2015 UTC,Especially if you use ions...had a game last week where my B-wings went multiple turns without having anyone to shoot because my opponent made good use of his ion turrets.
XWingTMG,3d1rc2,violetmythmaker,3,Sun Jul 12 21:19:59 2015 UTC,I did that to my friend in a game too.  Used a Defender with ion to just run him off the table in his B-Wing.
XWingTMG,3d1rc2,mxzf,3,Sun Jul 12 21:29:27 2015 UTC,I thought the same when my usual sparring partner started using them almost exclusively. 3 attack and 8 HP is pretty good for the price. But their dial makes them extremely predictable and that 1 agility hurts. Split them up and focus fire them down.
XWingTMG,3d1rc2,WhiskeyReckless,3,Sun Jul 12 21:25:13 2015 UTC,"OK, I'll give it a shot.  Relative to the Xwing, the B-wing has 3 more shields (12 points if bought as upgrades), a barrel roll (~ to EU: 4 points), more and better upgrade slots (1-2 points), and a dial that while allegedly inferior, in play rarely works out that way for it (call it -1 or 2)  Drawbacks - 1 less defense die.  (would have to be -15 points to count here).  The power difference between the X and B is stunning, and bad for the game.  Now, the X is barely competitive at all - and the generics never see high-table play, but the comparison is still startling nonetheless.  And for that, you pay 1 extra point for the generics.  The generics are underpriced because in mass, they are terrifying.  The aces are not overpriced, because you cannot mass them, and their defensive weakness then actually matter.    Of course, once you study playing against them a bit and learn how to put yourself right in the k-turn range, then you can get a free round of shooting on them, and that rather strongly changes the calculations.  I think have the ability to put 4 of them with upgrades, or a 5th ship, on the field at once is kind of ridiculous.  And pretty much an autoloss for any inexperienced player facing it, and an autowin for many people flying it.  it's only at higher levels of competition that the weaknesses matter much at all.  edit:  Maybe, as a community, we should point out the k-turn weakness to noobs to limit the negativity toward B's out there.  I felt this way for months, until I settled on 5x avengers to beat them, and played it and studied it until I realized the issue was the second turn of combat.  Get into the edge of range 1/2, and they can't turn to face you the next turn.  Free shots."
XWingTMG,3d1rc2,Barzhac,3,Sun Jul 12 23:10:20 2015 UTC,"So very much this on the K-turn. On the one hand, a 2-kturn is amazingly small. On the other hand, you can't k-turn around a big ship, and that's a huge problem"
XWingTMG,3d1rc2,boredompwndu,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:23:25 2015 UTC,"the strategy I developed with my avengers was to charge right in and BR/Boost a couple ships into that 2-turn zone.  Then focus fire 15 red dice.  I'm going to kill a Blue, and put serious hurt on another.  With the 4 ships left, they kill one of my squints.  I only shoot at ones I have not blocked.  Done properly, maybe 2 of my ships block 3 of theirs.  Then, next round, maybe 1 - 2 of theirs can shoot at all, while  I am killing off another ship and getting into the 3rd.  And that's without a large ship.  Got a new squad that I'd love to fly against 4BZ sometime."
XWingTMG,3d1rc2,Barzhac,2,Sun Jul 12 23:48:47 2015 UTC,"Some of the X named pilots are still competitive, just not often used in the current meta for a number of reasons, none of which are related to their point cost.   The X and B are equally durable if you're shooting with 2 dice. If tie swarm comes back in a big way, there will be a lot more X-wings.  B-Wings also do badly against boosting large based ships. They're just too slow."
XWingTMG,3d1rc2,Barzhac,1 point,Mon Jul 13 00:59:20 2015 UTC,"The ""against two die attacks"" thing may be true.  But the idea that they are too slow doesn't hold water for me.  The board is too small for their speed to matter much.  Turn, shoot, turn, shoot.  Rinse, repeat.  I don't see how having a white 3 turn and white 4 straight is really all that helpful for the X over the B.  The fact that the B can roll, and has a 1 turn (red though it is, at least it exists as an option) far outweigh the minor speed issues in my experience."
XWingTMG,3d1rc2,Vaygr,2,Mon Jul 13 04:32:36 2015 UTC,"This works against Tie Swarms but not against boosting large base turrets, especially with debris fields. You just get picked off by Dash Rendar. There are so many boosting large base turret ships in the current meta."
XWingTMG,3d1rc2,leewardstyle,2,Mon Jul 13 08:54:11 2015 UTC,Could you elaborate on your reasoning? I routinely fly against B wings and I don't mind their point costs.
XWingTMG,3d1rc2,zebratwat,2,Sun Jul 12 20:49:10 2015 UTC,"You dont want to get caught in ANY Swarm's ""sweet spot (dmg)."" So whether it's (4) B's, (5) Squints, or (6) Z-95s, if one ship is taking all the dice on the first pass, you're doing something wrong. Some in our group call an (opening_turn) k_turn a ""Kite-turn."""

XWingTMG,3cuhq6,Torobasa,2,Sat Jul 11 04:12:05 2015 UTC,"Really prefer the original design, wish they would've gone with TIE interceptors or another advanced craft (would've been a bit much to ask for TIE Defenders) for the film."
XWingTMG,3cuhq6,Dreadnot9,3,Fri Jul 10 23:36:47 2015 UTC,"If you think this is the only ship we'll see I've got a wrecked Star Destroyer to sell ya... there is still so much under wraps. Plus, remember the progression of adding new ships in the original trilogy. Episide IV was just TIEs, Vader's Advanced, X's and Y's. They may be following the same pattern with the new trilogy."
XWingTMG,3cuhq6,poerhouse,1 point,Sat Jul 11 04:35:32 2015 UTC,"Eh, I'm sure we'll see more ships, I just don't like the re-design of the TIE."
XWingTMG,3cuhq6,Dreadnot9,1 point,Sat Jul 11 04:43:36 2015 UTC,So is the cockpit going to rotate to let it shoot backwards and do a quick flip?

XWingTMG,3cvlr5,pie904,6,Sat Jul 11 03:37:58 2015 UTC,"So, the trick with Lambda's let alone doomshuttles, is that their movement dial is literally cancer. (That is to day that it grows on you in a bad way, and is on par with Hitler) If you miss your shot to do your job, you'll probably never do it.  What this means is we need to a) put the shuttle somewhere flexible and b) be able to stall and block with your other ships.  Generally, this ends up meaning that for A, we stuff him in a back corner and that's that. If point of engagement is on the other side of the board, you can get there,. If it's next to you, your already there  Now for B. B is a little harder, and can make you look like  terrible flyer, but for as long as you have no idea where the lambda needs to be, you need to minimize its movement. This is most easily done my alternating a 0 forward, and a 1 straight. In the 1 straight step, try to get a ship to swing by and block you. Your clear stress, and you haven't been forced to commit to a situation you didn't want.   When flown well, your doomshuttle can probably get away with 3-4 Vaderings. (number 4 probably killing yourself and taking a ship with you) If he gets too close to the engagement, people might start shooting at you, and every 2 damage they do to you is a Vader you don't get, so try to keep Vader in the background. If you have someone with bombs that can do a first pass and throw down some prox mines or cluster mines, you can really discourage people trying to get cheeky with you as well. You'll need other things doing actual distraction stuff as well. Its best to think of Vader as a support, tearing Crits into whoever has lost their shields. Until there's ships without shields, I'd sit back on Vader since you have only a small handful of chances to do damage"
XWingTMG,3cvlr5,boredompwndu,1 point,Sat Jul 11 06:37:18 2015 UTC,"Pretty much this. Set up in a corner at a 45 degree angle next to another ship of yours to do an immediate, intentional bump. Then alternate between 0 and 1 straight. Don't be tempted to fully engage. Your wingmen will do that. You need to cast your net far and wide, and that means moving as slow as possible, with your arc covering as much as possible. This will take you to mid-game. You should be dead by end-game."

XWingTMG,3cvlr5,boredompwndu,1 point,Sat Jul 11 14:30:49 2015 UTC,I'll be flying the OGP with Soomtir and Kath. Any tips?
XWingTMG,3cvlr5,boredompwndu,2,Sat Jul 11 14:36:13 2015 UTC,"This is where things get fun: getting into your opponent's head. I like the idea of running a bait and switch. Since both your firespray and lambda can slow-play fairly well, and soontir is well, soontir, I would probably have both of them putter around on your side of the board, and get Soontir with his shenanigans to run up the middle of the board, get some attention, then turn around and run away.   With your opponents now trying to chase the ever elusive Soontir, you have ""map control"" meaning you control how everything moves around the board. You can't control dials, but you know what everyone is going to do, and can captialize on it fairly well. If your opponent chooses not to go for soontir, I imagine soontir can have some fun with that.The lambda may be out of the game for 1-2 turn while he turns around to where you though engagement wouldn't be. But since he was probably clear on the wrong side of the board probably anyway, its not a big deal.  Sometimes your going to have an easy game with vader, sometimes, you'll struggle. Its just the way it happens.  For the list as a whole, try and theory-wing out some particularly nasty combo's you can leverage. Look through the damage deck (because Vader crits) and see how you can leverage any of the cards against your opponent with your list. I fly dual aggressors that have obscenely low damage output. I know if I do certain things, I lose. I have battle plans for every power build. (most of them include ionizing ships off the board, because ionizing ships off the board is always rewarding) So when you enter a battle, have a rough idea of how you want to engage"
XWingTMG,3cvlr5,asmeus,1 point,Sat Jul 11 15:08:22 2015 UTC,"Not an expert here, but after ~7 matches with it, my conclusion that against decent opponent Lamda was only able to fire on the first pass.  I usually put it ~angled 45° in the corner. (So that, after the first pass, it can turn around a little bit faster)  First round I usually did red 0 maneuver.  2nd round I knew where my opponent wished to go, and accordingly did green straight/bank.  Engaged with Lamda as slow as possible, so that first shot would be as close to maximum range as possible. (But still, so that all ships would engage at the same time on target ship)  When engaging at maximum range, after that you can do red 0 maneuver and after that as slow as possible.  If you will get really lucky, you could manage 3 shots.  In tournament, in first 2 matches, I managed 0-1 shots. :D In 3rd match with Vader's ability, I managed to one-shot unlucky Soontir in range 1 in oppening salvo. :) In semis and final, with little bit more experience, I managed 2 shots, which I now consider good result.   I flew Lamda + 6 TIE-F. Putting them in opposite corners.  In some matches opponents chose to deploy and go as fast as possible to engage Lamda. Luckily Lamda is very slow, if it wishes, and TIE-F get right in time to flank everyone. Lamda in most cases will survive 1 round of shooting, maybe even block something if opponents go for it. And if they kill Lamda first, it's big win for you, since otherwise it would just continue to flow around without shooting anything. (Getting perfect MoV with Lamda is close to impossible since Doom shuttle goes against the principles of preserving the ships)"
XWingTMG,3cvlr5,84N5H33,1 point,Sat Jul 11 05:00:36 2015 UTC,Same question for you. I'm running OGP with Soontir and Kath. Advice?

XWingTMG,3cvlr5,Nomnomnicon,3,Sat Jul 11 05:22:06 2015 UTC,"This was a question for the basic doom-shuttle.  If you attach engine upgrade, you could just go all in, and create 40 point jouster Lamda with HLC that will plague the opponents for all eternity. :D  With doomshuttle your main goal should be - deal more than 24 points of damage to opponents list before losing Lamda."

XWingTMG,3ctr3q,Unrulycustomer,2,Fri Jul 10 19:02:33 2015 UTC,"No stripping required, I did prime them though. most were brush-on primed.

XWingTMG,3cux72,VanderLegion,1 point,Sat Jul 11 05:14:38 2015 UTC,"Nah, the FAQ states that both have to miss for Munitions failsafe to work which makes sense, but that each attack is treated as a separate attack, which means gunner/ Luke can trigger off either. Also in the FAQ, under gunner/ Luke it specifically states that if used on the first cluster missile shot you don't get a second shot, implying that for the second you would."

XWingTMG,3csw94,Nomnomnicon,4,Mon Jul 13 15:38:54 2015 UTC,"Inspired by Vader's exploits in the latest Rebels episode, I wanted ships in X-Wing to do something similar.  Aggressive Maneuvers lets you turn off the safeties and continue drifting backwards for a turn after performing a koiogran. (This is also a not so sneaky Defender EPT)  Not sure if it should be a one time use or if there should be more penalties incurred."
XWingTMG,3csw94,AnDanDan,1 point,Fri Jul 10 14:51:30 2015 UTC,Maybe toss a stress in there for balance?

XWingTMG,3csw94,VanderLegion,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:30:04 2015 UTC,It's also something that's impossible to do othersie in game right now (move backwards).  There should be SOME penalty or balance for that.  That or be more expensive than 2 points.
XWingTMG,3csw94,Shgrizz,2,Fri Jul 10 15:43:53 2015 UTC,"It's a tough call because you are already taking an actionless turn and staying stressed.  I think making it a 1 point burner could be good.  2 ion tokens might work also (or small ship only, 1 ion token)"
XWingTMG,3csw94,rsixidor,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:04:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's a little better.

In EvE Online there are wormholes which can have differing modifiers like increasing speed, or better damage for certain weapon types. Perhaps we could have a FMF where we come up with custom, fun rules additions like 'Interdictor near by, all maneuvers 1 speed slower' or 'Cosmic winds blow bombs around'. I dunno. Might be fun."

Also, not sure it makes sense as an EPT anyway. Sounds like it would be a systems slot or an illicit upgrade to me."

XWingTMG,3csw94,LiquidLogic,0,Fri Jul 10 16:29:36 2015 UTC,1 ship & the ship must have an astromech.  The talent is supposed to be a 'neural link' between the pilot and his astromech to allow extra focus. That's the theme I'm going for.

The Fel/2x Bounty Hunter list has raw efficiency going for it, but high PS arc Dodgers could give you some real trouble.  As usual, I recommend flying whatever list you're most comfortable flying. The meta is full of rock/paper/scissors right now, and there will be a hard counter to anything you fly or a steep skill barrier to overcome.

I know high PS can make a difference but everyone these days really seem to think that it's the biggest most important factor ever now, or ever since the phantom dropped anyway . Obviously movement is a little easier when moving last, but if you play your cards (dials) right and can anticipate your opponents then it doesn't matter. I prefer having some other ept's and blocker ships than worrying about making my dudes PS 11 or so. If anything it'd be dumb to have so many pilots for each ship at the lowest or highest ends of the spectrum  TLDR: high PS isn't SO critical that PS7 makes a ship bad"

XWingTMG,3cuys4,alemondemon,1 point,Sat Jul 11 06:40:36 2015 UTC,High PS is important for arc dodging ships. You can see where your opponent went and then boost/barrel-roll as needed to arc dodge.
XWingTMG,3csyo3,Red_Blues,1 point,Fri Jul 10 14:58:14 2015 UTC,"There's a lot of ways to use a Lambda. It's a cheap cannon carrier, so you can do things like Ion + Tactician for control, or HLC for damage. It's got the crew slots and hit points to run stuff like Vader+Gunner to do guaranteed damage. Or you can grab one of the named pilots and use them as support for the rest of your squad, or some combination of that and the above.  The best use of the TIE bomber currently is Captain Jonus to grant re-rolls to something better, like Defenders with Heavy Laser Canons. Wave 7's new ordnance and the Extra Munitions card will make bombers a lot better, though."
XWingTMG,3csyo3,EdgeOfDreams,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:09:34 2015 UTC,"I think the new wave is going to make TIE bombers much more viable.  Extra munitions will reduce the point cost for having multiple munition shots, and plasma torpedoes are going to be very good against the large ships that are dominating right now.  Personally I usually use a generic shuttle with Darth Vader on it, and try to hand out some extra damage with it... it does down quickly.  Handing off TLs is definitely a viable strategy, and will work great paired with bombers.  It's possible the punisher might end up a better choice than the bomber with the extra health, but at 16 points base, you can fly more bombers in a list.  Your call there.  Some people also use Yorr fairly well to allow their other ships to k-turn without taking stress."
XWingTMG,3csyo3,scuff,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:11:20 2015 UTC,Shuttle + title + Weapons Engineer.  Add in Vessery and he basically gets FCS.

XWingTMG,3csyo3,AffixBayonets,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:08:10 2015 UTC,"Those TLs are for Vessery. If the shuttle tags two priority targets right from the get go, Vessery gets a free lock on both of those ships whenever he attacks them."
XWingTMG,3csyo3,Thopterthallid,1 point,Sat Jul 11 11:05:11 2015 UTC,"I know, but when I've used that build ST-321 is the difference between a mangler cannon and a heavy laser cannon. I've had more success with having the third ship drop target locks too instead of taking ST-321.   When the shuttle gets stuck in battle it doesn't need the title to get those locks. It's three points for an ability I only end up using once or twice."
XWingTMG,3csyo3,AffixBayonets,1 point,Sat Jul 11 12:50:50 2015 UTC,In the meta of high health ships everywhere you don't really need the crew or title.  Vessery will shoot before the shuttle and esp if you bring Yorr then he will be able to lock generics like blues.

XWingTMG,3csyo3,SgtKashim,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:51:53 2015 UTC,"I haven't played a ton, but I do fly a shuttle. I've been playing with Fel/Whisper/OGP builds. Fel and Whisper start angled in on one side, Shuttle opposite. Aim em about where they'll hit the enemy formation.   Shuttle goes in the middle, acts as a stress engine + blocker. Crash into their formation, cause as much havok, break everything up. If they ignore him to focus on Fel, so much the better - the shuttle gums up their maneuvering and causes more stress. If it's carrying Vader, you might even crush a ship in the process.   Meanwhile Fel and Whisper dance around the edges, find stuff that has no tokens or is stuck out of position and drop 7-9 red dice per turn on em.   Of course, once the shuttle's through the formation it's pretty much useless. You can try to turn, but you'll either get killed from behind or ignored while you desperately try to turn the damned spacecow. Keep that in mind - you want the shuttle to go slowly and stick in front of the enemy as long as possible.   I think this is the build I'm going to stick with."
XWingTMG,3csyo3,starslinger72,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:25:00 2015 UTC,"Shuttles fit in lots of places.  Bombers currently see play with Jonus like has been mentioned or cheap prox mine carriers.  At PS two you can fly right in front of high pilot skill ships and drop mines either on them or in their way.  Cheap easy damage and after that they are beefy tie fighters.  Shuttle builds  Doomshuttle - OGP with just vader.  Try and get most of your list shooting before it to strip shields so you can get those crits down.  Yorr - Amazing pilot ability to just soak up all the crazy stress stuff going on in the meta.  Rebel captive, tact, or even flying through a debris field can all go to him instead.  Dogfighter - OGP with HLC, rebel captive, Advanced sensors, Engine upgrade.  38 point ship that is actually scary fast for something supposed to be slow as well as hits hard  RipSaw - OGP - FCS, Tact, Gunner.  29 points of stress pumping glory.  if the first shot misses take the second shot with the FCS target lock to add more stess.  Even better if you manage to shoot something you already have locked as you can reroll your hits to make sure you miss the first shot with the target lock!  Super solid control ship."

I just feel that Palpatine allows the shuttle to run away after the initial joust and you still get value out of it.  If you don't run away (or get trapped up close and can't get out), you are going to do some serious damage with 4 red dice at range 1 before it dies.  With two arc dodgers (Fel + Vader) on your team you can either help dodge if trapped in arc or increase damage output with palpatine."

XWingTMG,3csyo3,Thopterthallid,1 point,Sat Jul 11 11:06:30 2015 UTC,"It's three primary roles are support, blocking, and the infamous doomshuttle. It's slow, and takes ages to turn around, making it all but useless in a close range dogfight, but that's not what it's for. It has respectable firepower, and defenses for it's low cost, and can make a great ship in the right hands.  They can take a cannon, two crews, a system, and even has a title that allows you to take target locks REGARDLESS of range.  Support: The three unique pilots' abilities are there to assist your other ships. Jendon can pass target locks to allied ships, Kagi can block enemy target locks, and Yorr can ease pilot stress from your allies. Weapons Engineer will allow these guys to take two target locks, which is great for Jendon. Colonel Vessery LOVES a titled Shuttle with Weapons Engineer.  Blocker: Omicron Group Pilot, with his pilot skill of two, or one of the unique pilots with Enhanced Scopes, can really harrass pilots who need their actions. If Soontir Fel bumps this beast, he's toast. I could see a shuttle with Engine Upgrade, Intelligence Agent, and Enhanced Scopes being the BEST blocker in the game.  Doomshuttle: An Omicron Group Pilot with a Darth Vader crew costs just 24 points. Thats a ship that has 10 total health, and potentially devastating attack power. This costs 5 points LESS than Darth Vader in a Tie Advance. Vader as a crew can deal GUARANTEED damage, no red, or green dice. To put that into perspective, imagine trying to hit Soontir Fel with Autothrusters at range 3 through an asteroid. (It happens a lot). He rolls 5 defense dice and is virtually guaranteed one extra free evade dice. Even if you miss, Darth Vader can activate, and deal a likely devastating crit to Soontir.  Future Meta: I can easily see Palpatine getting his own form of the Doomshuttle. (Gloomshuttle?) An Omicron carrying Palpatine around costs 29 points, but Palpatine's ability works from anywhere on the board, meaning he can sit comfortably away from the battle and offer up his dark powers. If your opponents go after him, they're turning their back on the rest of your squishy, but very pointy squad of Interceptors and Phantoms and stuff. Palpy might feel a little safer on a Decimator, but a shuttle costs nearly half as much.  I think it's a great ship, if only because it's nice to see a large ship without a turret or auxiliary firing arc."
XWingTMG,3ctrjz,DokerinZion,2,Fri Jul 10 18:34:03 2015 UTC,"At Nexus Game Fair in Milwaukee a couple of weeks ago there was a unique Aces Tournament. You had 33 points to put into any one named pilot, then you added two base ships depending on your faction. Rebels got ps 4 Tala Z-95s, Imps got Obsidian Squad TIEs, and Scum got Cartel Spacer M3As.  MOV scoring worked that you got 3 points for shooting down an ace and 1 point for taking down a support ship. Standard tournament rules from there, with 45 minute rounds.

One other rule was small-base ships only, so no decked out shuttles or anything. We did a three-round swiss, then a cut to top 8 elimination. You could spend less than 33 points for an initiative bid. I actually won the tourney using Fel with PTL and Autothrusters. Ended up playing an almost new player in the final table who was flying Luke with VI and R2-D2. There were additional prizes for killing the most aces, and things like that. I just missed getting my ""Ace of Aces"" award for the day. Let me know if you have any other questions, but I think that's about everything there was. Highly recommend the format."

XWingTMG,3ctrjz,Lokidude,1 point,Sun Jul 12 13:55:15 2015 UTC,"The original iteration of the format had scum using the PS1 Z-95, Imps using Academy TIEs and Rebels using Bandit Z-95s, but we wanted to make each faction feel more unique, and so used the M3-A for Scum instead since it is unique to that faction. During the tourney, though, we found Academy TIEs were just a little too weak when facing the PS 2 M3-A, considering it had the PS bid, a shield token, target lock and an arguably better dial. After discussing, we thought the best balance adjustment was bumping Imps to Obsidian TIEs and Rebels to Tala Z-95s. That really seemed to do the trick and make the factions seem much more rock-paper-scissors. It did make it interesting having to think about what your support ships would be when choosing your ace as well."

XWingTMG,3ctoh9,DokerinZion,3,Fri Jul 10 18:11:44 2015 UTC,"I think it would reduce agility, but maybe if you used it you wouldn't be able to attack with that ship that turn."
XWingTMG,3ctoh9,threemileisland,2,Fri Jul 10 18:29:48 2015 UTC,"or perhaps like an ion canon if it hit it would restrict movement? Perhaps cancels all movement next turn, or pulls the ship in a 1 direction towards the ship that hit them."
XWingTMG,3ctoh9,goldstarstickergiver,5,Sat Jul 11 06:33:35 2015 UTC,"I agree with it being a system upgrade. But not limited to large ships only though since that would limit who can take them (B & E wings are the only rebels able to take systems ATM).   How about this:  Tractor Beam (action): Pick a ship within your primary weapon arc at range 1-2. That ship must reveal its maneuver, reduce its intended movement by 1 to a minimum of 1, and moves immediately. This new maneuver becomes white. The ship acts normally otherwise.  Thoughts? It makes the attacker think about where they need to be to use it, and can give the defender a chance, possibly, to counter it. If a ship does a kturn, it becomes a white kturn, which gives the defender a chance to strike back but it could also make them end up on an asteroid. I think this rule would be awesome to use since it seems pretty balanced in that you can keep some one in range, but it could also bite you in the butt.   Thoughts?"

But making the maneuver white would add a balance to the card. If you use it, you'd be possibly giving your opponent an advantage. If inadvertently causing a clown car.

When that ship reveals it's dial this turn, treat its chosen maneuver as a red maneuver.""  That way an unstressed pilot becomes stressed upon executing the maneuver (he's able to keep the ship on course, with a lot of effort), but if he was already stressed you get choose his maneuver (he can't keep it together and succumbs to the tractor beam.)  Edited for how I think FFG would word it."
XWingTMG,3ctoh9,towmule,2,Sat Jul 11 03:28:27 2015 UTC,"It's a really cool idea, but I think some edge cases (pun intended) might be too hard. with this tractor beam you could use 4/5 forward over and over again to run someone off the board."

XWingTMG,3ctoh9,CyclopticBinLid,1 point,Sun Jul 12 08:32:07 2015 UTC,"Perhaps add the clause: ""If a pilot is already stressed, instead you may pick a 1-speed maneuver from its dial. Treat this as white maneuver.""  Pilot still succumbs to tractor beam but shows they're still fighting it. Also stops you flinging ships about the board. This would probably be the death of Phantoms, as it guarantees stress."

XWingTMG,3ctoh9,sleet01,1 point,Sat Jul 11 06:20:26 2015 UTC,"Maybe system upgrade slot, large ship only.  Action: pick an enemy ship at range 1.  Until your next activation, reduce its speed by one and treat green maneuvers as white."
XWingTMG,3ctoh9,scuff,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:17:39 2015 UTC,Why a large ship only? Doesn't that mean it's mostly useful for Shuttles?
XWingTMG,3ctoh9,AffixBayonets,1 point,Sun Jul 12 04:09:55 2015 UTC,"I thought it would be weird to have a small ship tractoring a large ship, and felt it was most appropriate on a large ship thematically... Huge ships should probably have something like this too, but theirs could be handled differently.  Yes, this version is currently only usable by shuttles or the Aggressor (both of which could have TB available in lore) but it might also make sense as a cannon.  That would open up YT-2400, (you do not want to use the title with this)  Firespray, and, YT-666 as options to carry it.    I still think keeping it off of small ships is the right thing to do."
XWingTMG,3ctoh9,scuff,1 point,Sun Jul 12 04:24:55 2015 UTC,"I like /u/scuff 's ideas, but in order for it to feel like the beam weapon in the TIE Fighter game, I think it would be a system upgrade, not require an action, and it would only work in arc at R1, maybe R1-2. Then reduce speed of the revealed dial by 1 to a minimum of 1, and treat green maneuvers as white as previously stated."
XWingTMG,3ctoh9,mahthyoo,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:44:01 2015 UTC,"Target ship must be within range 2. When activated, use a 1-2 maneuver template to bring it closer to your ship (use barrel roll type movement if perpendicular).  I'd venture it should be large ships too maybe.. I'm not sure. It would require a lot of balancing to make sure its not over/underpowered"

XWingTMG,3ctovx,GameGeek1,2,Fri Jul 10 18:25:58 2015 UTC,"The thing about turrets is they give up a lot of efficiency points for that 360 degree firing radius. That's why TIE fighters, as one of the most efficient ships in the game, generally do so well against them. If you can be more efficient, that gives you a good leg-up in the game already. Two possible list ideas:  First is Soontir Fel with PTL and Autothrusters, then two naked Bounty Hunters. Fel with ATs hunts turrets and Bounty Hunters are very good all around for their 33 points.  Second list is going the complete hit point route with a shuttle with Vader, Patrol Leader with Rebel Captive and a naked Bounty Hunter. I've flown and had fun with both lists."

XWingTMG,3cs105,Rejusu,1 point,Fri Jul 10 08:36:17 2015 UTC,"I'm about to do my first ever repaint on my TIE interceptor, what were the things you learnt?"
XWingTMG,3cs105,xorandor,1 point,Fri Jul 10 10:59:18 2015 UTC,Basically on future paints I'd probably use a glaze rather than a wash for the surface weathering. The wash made it look too wet and dirty and I had to go over it again which isn't very good when you're painting over paint as you start to lose definition. Silly mistakes really. I'd probably also try masking tape to get straighter lines on the markings.  I'll probably avoid using colours too light in the future too. Hard to get the colour to come through while keeping that weathered look.
XWingTMG,3cs105,DefiantLoveLetter,1 point,Fri Jul 10 11:50:25 2015 UTC,How were you applying the wash? Were you slathering it on or were you just applying it to the recesses and corners? I don't think the results of a glaze will be much different than washing it.
XWingTMG,3cs105,DefiantLoveLetter,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:19:37 2015 UTC,Recesses and corners with a light brush over the surface. I tend to find that while washes work better at flowing into recesses they don't spread as evenly over surfaces.
XWingTMG,3cs105,podsyboy121,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:20:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah, they tend to pool, but a glaze would too, wouldn't it? I guess I know almost nothing about them.  You should try weathering with powders. They sell them at most local hobby shops, but if you want a cheaper way to do it, use crushed artist pastels. They crush into a powder very nicely. You have to seal the model after, but it gives a wonderful weathering effect that looks a lot better than washes."
XWingTMG,3cs105,KorlithZaan,1 point,Fri Jul 10 20:16:39 2015 UTC,"The main difference between a glaze and a wash is just that - a glaze will get more or less equal coverage, while a wash will naturally want to run into the cracks.  A good way to think of it is that a glaze is ""sticky"" - it'll want to stay where you put it."
XWingTMG,3cs105,pksullivan,1 point,Fri Jul 10 20:27:39 2015 UTC,"One trick I've found for washes (I'm a wash fiend for gritty weathering) Is that if you want to get a wash to stay where you want it, go over the area with a wet brush, then add the wash. I actually allow for pooling on some areas, but wash control was my first big screw-up, so it was the thing I tried to fix."
XWingTMG,3cs105,podsyboy121,1 point,Sat Jul 11 15:04:26 2015 UTC,"To be fair, I think this looks better than just about any other repaint I've seen. Too many people just do flat colors, rather than changing the accents."

If this would make it overlap an obstacle, resolve as if it had collided with that obstacle. If this would make it overlap another ship base, apply the normal rules to place the targetted ship (e.g. slide it along the move template until it fits).

XWingTMG,3cq3x2,Thopterthallid,2,Fri Jul 10 10:09:57 2015 UTC,"Size-wise, I think they're shorter than X-Wings. It'd be cool to have a non TIE small ship."

XWingTMG,3cq3x2,mxzf,2,Fri Jul 10 14:22:55 2015 UTC,"What exactly would the TIE Hunter bring to the game?  Looking at it, it looks like it'd have stats halfway between an Interceptor and an Advanced.  There isn't really a hole that needs filling there though.  It's designed to be a match for the X-Wing, but the Imperials don't really need a TIE fighter with the X-Wing's stat block, especially with how infrequently the X-Wing gets used.    That's the big problem right now, trying to find ships that have a role to fill.  There are a few smuggler/pirate epic ships that would work well, and a few smaller ships too, but much of the 'normal fighter' roles are already filled."
XWingTMG,3cq3x2,Elda-Taluta,2,Thu Jul 9 21:50:09 2015 UTC,I'd rather see the Gozanti for a Scum huge than Jabba's ship. I'd also like to see some Old Republic stuff - like the Dynamic-class freighter.
XWingTMG,3cq3x2,Torobasa,4,Thu Jul 9 22:36:15 2015 UTC,It looks like the Gozanti was used by both the Empire and the Black Sun.  Maybe it could be the first multiple-faction huge ship.  http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Gozanti-class_cruiser

For all the Rebel and Imperial ships already out, I really just want more titles, upgrades and pilots for the ships that have only 2 or 3 named pilots, like the Defender of Y-Wing.  The Scum have some great non-standard ship options, and Dengar's Punishing One is the one I've proclaimed most loudly to be an essential addition. You may have noticed it will be introduced in Armada as a Imperial fighter; this makes me very confident it may jump to X-Wing. From what I understand, it has a turret in the canon, so I expect it may be somewhere in between the Falcon and Outsider. Probably with a free slot, illicit, possibly salvaged mech (according to canon that is who operates the turret), and maybe some ordnance."

Jedi Starfighter 2 The ship made famous from the start of episode three, again an astromech could go easily into this ship.   Clone Z-95 The Republic had Z-95's? Sure did! No reason it couldn't be used across three factions.   Naboo N-1 Star Fighter The Republic wasn't just the Grand Army made up of clone soliders and Jedi - thousands of member worlds had Starfighter corps.

At 4 dice, they're mathematically equal, but Evade still might be considered better because it sets a minimum of 1 evade rolled.   Expected value of one agility die: 3/8 without focus, 5/8 with focus Expected value of 3 agility dice + 1 evade token: 3/8 * 3 + 1 = 2 and 1/8th Expected value of 3 agility dice + 1 focus token = 5/8 * 3 = 1 and 7/8ths 4 dice + evade  = 3/8 * 4 + 1 = 2 and 1/2 4 dice + focus = 5/8 * 4 = 2 and 1/2 5 dice + evade = 3/8 * 5 + 1 = 2 and 7/8ths 5 dice + focus = 5/8 * 5 = 3 and 1/8th"
XWingTMG,3cpo2o,EdgeOfDreams,6,Thu Jul 9 20:03:46 2015 UTC,"Paraphrased from the article I linked below:  This is true for a single attack, but the numbers change when you are attacked multiple times in a round. If you are attacked twice, the 42.2% chance you have zero eyeballs drops to 17.8%, or to put it another way, an 82.2% chance of rolling at least one eyeball.  If you remove the results that include zero eyeballs, you will average 1.3 eyeballs rolled on three dice. .822*1.3=1.0686  So, if you attacked at least twice, focus will mathematically results in more HP saved than an evade token.  Of course that's all moot if you get blown up on the first attack..."

XWingTMG,3cpo2o,beer_demon,9,Thu Jul 9 20:09:24 2015 UTC,"Team Covenent has a fantastic article on this very question!    Long story short, it depends on how many times your are being shot at. If you are only attacked once, a focus is worth .75 of an evade token. If you are attacked twice, the math brings it up to 1.06 of an evade token."
XWingTMG,3cpo2o,MysteriousRacer_X,2,Thu Jul 9 20:09:47 2015 UTC,"and evade token is worth a focus token on 4 agi dice.  So if you are rolling 4 dice through some method, range or stealth device, then you are even and the choice is yours.  If you are rolling more go focus.  Less go evade.  That being said I tend to always like the evade, as its a for sure thing you can count on.  Dice percentages are just that, and will let you down at some point."
XWingTMG,3cpo2o,starslinger72,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:58:39 2015 UTC,Completely agree that evade is the only sure way to mitigate at least some damage. There have been times that the math gods have let me down and I lose a ship that an evade token could have saved.
XWingTMG,3cpo2o,forkmonkey88,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:03:15 2015 UTC,"When you are rolling 3 green dice, your average evade output is approximately 1.8 with a focus and just over 2 with an evade. When you are rolling 4 green dice, both options yield an average expected evade count of just about 2.5. At 5 green dice, the focus will give you just over 3 while the evade is around 2.8.   In other words, if you are rolling 3 or fewer green dice, take an evade. If you are rolling 4 or more, focus is probably the better option."
XWingTMG,3cpo2o,forkmonkey88,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:00:50 2015 UTC,"I remember seeing a statistical analysis somewhere that evade was better for a single attack and focus was better for multiple attacks - the more attacks you face, the higher chance you'll get/need multiple eyes, or something."

For this specific situation I would take the evade every time (even if the math says otherwise). The focus may get you to the end of the game, but the evade will get you to the next turn."
XWingTMG,3cpo2o,Late_for_something,1 point,Thu Jul 9 23:36:21 2015 UTC,"I think it depends on the number of agility dice you're rolling, but an Evade token is generally better than a focus for pure defense. I'm sure people have matched it out though, and can probably tell you the numbers."
XWingTMG,3cpo2o,Hutcher_Du,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:50:08 2015 UTC,Really depends.   General rule I go with is 3 agility dice or more? Take a Focus. 2 or less? Take an Evade.   Now the Advanced only rolls 2 attack dice so unless I roll 2 Focus I tend to save a focus for defense.
XWingTMG,3cpo2o,Dakkon_B,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:57:22 2015 UTC,"Your chances of a focus on defense are 25%.  With three dice, there's no guarantee that you'll roll any focuses, and the chances of rolling multiple are fairly low.  You should take the evade every time in this situation.  Stealth device might move it to the point where it's worth taking a focus."
XWingTMG,3cohwr,PCGamerPirate,3,Thu Jul 9 14:33:22 2015 UTC,"I'm yet to use the new rules, as I'm waiting for the cards, but they look set to fill an existing gap in the Imperial roster. It looks like it'll be possible to fill a 25-35ish point gap with a very capable, robust dogfighter. Previously, I've been using a miniswarm of 2-3 TIEs in these situations (currently the most versatile point filler in my book), so I'm keen to see what the new advanced will bring to the table. Certainly, it'll be a nice alternative to the miniswarm or the PTL interceptor.  The first list I'm excited to try is a 2-advanced, 4-TIE swarm with Howlrunner, 3 Academies, Colzet, and 1 Tempest Squadron pilot, with ATC on the big boys. Normally, a TIE swarm diminishes in threat with every casualty, but it's looking like Advanced with ATC are going to be a threat no matter what, enabling a bit more utility with the TIES as blockers. 5 HP with 3 agility is nothing to sniff at, it looks like Imperials will have the option of basic staying power at a points cost more typical of rebel ships.  Other things I've noticed are the really great synergies that persistent target locks will offer, notably with Vessery, who looks like a great companion for the new Advanced.   And something I'll be trying just for fun... 4 x Tempest pilots, all with cluster missiles and X1/accuracy correctors. 100 points. On the initial joust, provided you can get them all into range 2 (alive) and acquire a target lock, you can fire all your missiles for a guaranteed 16 hits. You can swing a game reeeeeal fast with that kind of alpha strike, especially against things with 0/1 agility.   I'm yet to see how all these ideas fare on the table, but the new options have certainly gotten the creative juices flowing. It looks to me like the advanced will actually start acting as the Imperial analogue to the X-wing that it was designed to be, only a little more versatile and manoeuvrable - and dare I say, a little scarier. Exciting times , assuming the raider eventually arrives..."
XWingTMG,3cohwr,Shgrizz,3,Thu Jul 9 14:57:33 2015 UTC,"As soon as the Raider hits, the Tie Advanced will be a strong ship. How strong? Only time will tell. So far people only could proxy the upgrades, but couldn't play them in tournaments.  Most people are suggesting to play the named Tie Advanced pilots with Advanced Targeting Computer and the unnamed ones with Accuracy Corrector (optinally: Cluster Missiles) to have a better action economy.  Tempest Squadron Pilots with Accuracy Corrector cost 21 points and fill a gap that previously only a Lambda Shuttle could fit into.  A Tie Advanced with AC or ATC works well with Colonol Vessery (Tie Defender).   The Tie Advanced is an even better Proton Rockets ship now, because you can lock onto a ship in range 2 or 3 and don't need to spend the lock. That way you'll have a target lock ready, when you move into range 1 to reroll up to 5 dice.  Because you never should spend your target lock, Push the Limit has only limited offensive value. Predator or Lone Wolf work well on a named Tie Advanced, because it allows to reroll without spending a target lock. Push the Limit is still great as a defensive upgrade."
XWingTMG,3cohwr,Stetto,3,Thu Jul 9 15:26:33 2015 UTC,"When the Raider drops I think LW+EU Vader will be a strong competitor with Fel for arc dodging. Sure he doesn't have Autothrusters, but he's got two actions every time so he's not as limited to green maneuvers, has shields to protect him from enemy Vader Crew, and with ATC bites deeper than Fel when attacking.   I think it will be a very solid ship for other uses too. We may see Strom swarms for his ability, Cozlet is a great cheap plug to fill points and tack on crit effects on people, Alozen has great action economy with the ATC, Juno has the one of the best dials in the game, and Vader is excellent. Even Stele will be more useful now.   All around, it's being transformed from the worst TIE variant to one of the best."
XWingTMG,3cohwr,AffixBayonets,5,Thu Jul 9 15:58:35 2015 UTC,"Overcosted and underpowered, the original TIE-Advanced suffered the most from the conservative game design of Wave I. Relegated to the never-used bin, the Advanced was immediately brought to the forefront with the inclusion of the TIE X-1 title, which granted the use of a system upgrade at -4 cost. On top of that, the Advanced exclusive ""Advanced Targeting Computer"" makes this two attack ship a monster at causing critical damage."
XWingTMG,3cohwr,fl1p_problems,4,Thu Jul 9 14:36:37 2015 UTC,"Playtesting with the ATC has shown that is transforms the once harmless Advanced into something really fierce. It's not simply a 3 dice ship now, its a 3 dice ship that rolls a crit EVERY time.   Also the permanent TLs on an enemy will allow some synergy with other imperial pilots, first of all Col. Vessery, who will be able to pull a free TL off nearly every attack, if flown correctly."
XWingTMG,3cohwr,AffixBayonets,3,Thu Jul 9 15:00:47 2015 UTC,Col. Vessery   I have no Advanceds currently so I'll pick up the base box and the Raider. I'm planning so many twin Advanced lists with Vessery! Their only weakness is that you can't take a Doomshuttle with pilot Vader.
XWingTMG,3cohwr,starslinger72,4,Thu Jul 9 16:03:19 2015 UTC,"This is one of those things that for some reason people believe but simply isn't true.   The biggest issue with the advanced was it being a defensive ship in a game that turned to purely offense.  With green dice being worse than offensive dice it makes it hard to defend multiple attacks while landing any meaningful hits.  When the game was just X-wings and Y-wings matching up against the advanced it was fine.   They also suffered from the Vader issue, where you couldn't make the ship to good, as native 2 action Vader would become a monster.  This will be the same problem they have with fixing the X-wing as it really needs a defense buff to stay in the fight longer, but you cant really do that with a ship like biggs on the table.  He becomes way to strong at that point.  The NA national champ Dark Templar ran Vader at worlds and was 1 game out of making the cut to the final day.  He also didn't win a lottery to play the second day, which might have seen him make it.   The other pilots besides vader were never going to see play later on as you had to bank on getting kills quickly, not surviving longer."
XWingTMG,3cohwr,kordos,5,Thu Jul 9 18:35:25 2015 UTC,"I guess I should have rephrased it that way. The ship was indeed designed to be defensive in what has become an offensive game, but that doesn't cover up the fact that they were costed identically to the X-Wing to but traded an attack die for an agility die (which is not an equal trade).  Much like the X-Wing's survivability issues didn't really crop up until other big hitters showed up (being the only 3 attack ship), the Advanced's inability to close games was the big issue.  Hothie won the first worlds with Darth Vader. But the ship was definitely balanced with non-mirror matches in mind as the two attack dice are not nearly as ineffective when the targets are Y's and X's.  It's just easier to say that it is overcosted and underpowered."
XWingTMG,3cohwr,scuff,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:03:20 2015 UTC,One of the local gaming groups here runs a tourny twice a year that i purely Rebels vs Imperials with missions and dog fights instead of just 4 dog fights in a row.  While I enjoy mirror matechs and playing scum there is just something about a Reb vs Imp game that feels sooo good.  Also as you know they there are not going to be any mirror matches breaks the meta a bit and people take lists you would never see at a regular tourney
XWingTMG,3cohwr,sacimino40,6,Thu Jul 9 23:33:39 2015 UTC,"If the TIE-Advanced was ""never-used,"" Maarek Stele was the absolute  bottom of that list. While he has an impressive ability, the two attack dice severely limited the likelihood of that ability triggering.  The ATC upgrade makes him a formidable threat to anything without shields. Every ship hates crits, some more than others.  This leaves his EPT slot open for dice modification like Predator or Lone Wolf. You could even bump him up to PS 9 with VI or make the crits really flow with Calculation."
XWingTMG,3cohwr,starslinger72,3,Thu Jul 9 14:41:12 2015 UTC,"When the Raider cards were first previewed, I was shocked that the fix could actually make Maarek Stele playable, I had written his ability off as being too bad for the ship he was on.  Calculation and  predator are excellent EPTs for him, as is PTL (since you need that lock, you'll want a focus.  Lone Wolf is less so.  Since you can only reroll blanks with it, Lone wolf is much more powerful when you'll be performing a focus action every turn.  To get ATC to trigger, you'll need to target lock every time you switch targets.    I also don't think VI is a great choice.  If you're looking for arc-dodging in a TIE Advance, he'd be the third best option.  To make the most out of his pilot ability, he wants to be firing later in the round, (after shields are gone) not earlier.  Maarek, Rexler, and low PS phantoms are probably the best cases for using the Decoy EPT.  It might not be better than predator or PTL, but it could be good in the right build."

XWingTMG,3cohwr,starslinger72,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:36:00 2015 UTC,"I would say no to PTL as the advanced doesnt really deal with stress well.  In the meta of boosting large base ships you cannot leave yourself without turn options and hope to keep people in arc.  Predator or lone wolf are the clear winners here, and once again in the meta of large base ships you will lock once and focus most of the rest of the game.  Lone wolf works fine in that situation assuming you can keep range  On the decoy bit, Maarek and Rex both love decoy but there is no reason to waste their EPT on it.  Let someone else bring that and have Maarek/Rex bring something to really help land a large number of crits.  I like black squads for this, but the list has to be built around it."

Being able to make a 90 degree turn is almost always needed to track a boosting large base ship, and sometimes you will need the extra 45 from boosting on top to catch them on the second turn."
XWingTMG,3cohwr,Shgrizz,2,Fri Jul 10 20:06:15 2015 UTC,"Original TIE Advanced: A tough ship - 3 agility, 3 hull, two shields - with good action par and passable dial. Vader is a fantastic pilot, potentially scoring himself 3 actions a turn. It's use was limited greatly by being more expensive, less shooty and less mobile than the TIE Interceptor though, as people want the third attack dice and mostly think that anything with less red dice is worthless unless it has a turret slot or costs 12-14 points. At 22 Points basic, it was a tough ship that didn't shoot enough to threaten large basis, or compete with even the X-Wing as a weapons platform. For 8 more points the Defender was a better rock to base your fleet around, or a shuttle with Vader on for 24. While not as mobile, they were tougher and had more firepower. Post Raider: Imagine have four crits a turn levelled at one of your ships. This is now what Storm Squadron TIE X/1's can do for 23 points a time, potentially adding eight more hits to that. More mobile than X & B wings, tougher than Interceptors, suddenly what was a shabby workhorse is now a glamorous War Stallion.  Darth Vader, Predator, EU, X/1 + ATC is my build. Run with 3 Alpha TIE-Interceptor + Autothrusters. I can see it run with a Decimator as well though, Lone Wolf instead of Predator as you'll have more board space.  Marek Steele will likely be humping ATC a lot post-Raider, and Accuracy correcter could like be on the generics, which'd deal nicely with high agility ships. Even with just a systems slot the ship is improved immensely. The cost discount makes them terrifying."
XWingTMG,3cohwr,Thopterthallid,2,Thu Jul 9 16:40:43 2015 UTC,"One list idea is the three imperial aces: juno eclipse, soontir fell and darth vader, with EU on the tie advances and the standard super build for fell.

XWingTMG,3cobrj,Rory_braker,5,Thu Jul 9 13:43:34 2015 UTC,"Vader was considered the most cost effective TIE Advanced pilot before the fix, and at a good points bargain.  He was competitive before, but people often passed over him because of his low attack value and the general fear of running a TIE Advanced.  Math Wing has been stating that with the new changes he might now be too powerful.  His efficiency with ATC is obscene."

XWingTMG,3cobrj,Norix596,1 point,Fri Jul 10 02:46:23 2015 UTC,"I've run Vader before.  He worked well as a flanker.  People didn't play him much in tournaments because timed matches often favor high offense ships.  Vader was this weird mix of hard to be killed, but can also be difficult to kill others without practice.  He took some skill to fly well, like arc dodgers do.  With ATC his damage gets a considerable bump, which I think many people will gravitate to.  Also with higher damage output you won't need nearly as high of skill playing him to get usefulness out of him.  But for those of you who haven't played him before, he essentially has PTL built-in with no negative side effects.  (I'd just say he had two actions, but I find comparing to PTL resonates better.)"

I have taken defenders to high tables in the past and could again if I wanted to bust out Bad Joke again.  Just been playing other lists.  Hell Im pretty sure one of the chicago guys that made triple shuttle fel could run it to a top 8 finish at nationals in a few weeks if he wanted to, but you get burned out playing the same thing over and over.    Fel + Rac is easy to play and win with so that is why you see so many people flocking to it.  Same thing with last year and Fat Han builds.  the Wisc regional was just won buy Biggs/Corran/Jake and actually capped at 104 players. (97 showed up I believe)  Chicago next weekend is close to selling out with another 100 player regional that will have tons of players from the top cut of every world final playing in them."
XWingTMG,3cobrj,Dakkon_B,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:51:35 2015 UTC,I guess I shouldn't say top 8 but you get what I mean. It seems the top tournament results are consistently the same builds over and over.

I want to see some small ship builds consistently winning.
XWingTMG,3cobrj,starslinger72,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:13:21 2015 UTC,"That is sadly not going to really happen.  Small ship builds are inherently harder to fly than most of the popular large based turret ship builds.   Also the skill gap at different regionals is staggering so this nationals season should be interesting.    A note about small ship builds showing up, Richard Hsu has played in something like 9 regionals (think he travels for work and set it up ahead of time lucky bastard)  and has been in the top 8 more times than not.

XWingTMG,3cobrj,Nomnomnicon,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:15:49 2015 UTC,"I hate the idea that current meta layouts make the rookie unpopular.  If attack 2 ships start showing up more instead of bigger guns then their effective health pool matches that of the B-wing for a cheaper price.  They also have a better dial and are faster for what its worth.  Big downside is lack of barrel roll, although good planning can mitigate that, and lack of a system slot."
XWingTMG,3cobrj,NC_Chronos,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:28:46 2015 UTC,"I build Vader with Predator+ATC+EU, comes in at 37 pts.I usually run it with 2 named Interceptors, or three unnamed ones so Lone Wolf doesn't trigger as often. I mgiht try for the defensive advantage though.  I think Vader'll be paired a lot with a Decimator since it's firepower, arc and toughness mean it won't need much concern early on. I still use Vader occasionally with Predator and EU; he's not as shooty but plenty dangerous.   I do agree the Dark Side is going to see it's champion flying out a lot more though :D"
XWingTMG,3cobrj,sacimino40,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:17:10 2015 UTC,"On the ATC card when it says ""if you have a target lock on the defender"", does that mean a target lock from any of your ships on the defender, or only a lock from the ship that is firing?"
XWingTMG,3cobrj,berusplants,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:51:19 2015 UTC,Has to be your ship. So vader must have a lock if he wants to ATC
XWingTMG,3cobrj,sacimino40,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:27:46 2015 UTC,"Interesting write up, cheers, Vader is indeed one for the back door! Was gonna play a similar list last night but in the end dropped Vessery for two Bombers. Up against the top 3 named Bs, Vader was again a force. So long as he doesnt get trapped early doors he is phenomenal late game, almost as maneuverable as Fel and hits harder thanks to ATC. When it came out I thought having to take the TL would reduce the action efficiency he has, but it seems there is always one round where he is repositioning and has a spare action to setup the lock for the next attack run."
XWingTMG,3cobrj,berusplants,2,Thu Jul 9 18:59:12 2015 UTC,"I think Vader is actually more maneuverable than Fel. He can double action without stress which means he can perform anything on his dial each turn. Also, Fel HAS to take ptl to double action whereas Vader doesn't. If you wanted to you could use vi on him to ensure moving last, making him even more maneuverable. Fel can turtle slightly better due to the second focus (and autothrusters) but that is his only benefit as far as I can see. As you say, Vader has better firepower, and is great with predator or lone wolf (which actually helps his turtling).   It is scary that he might be better than Fel. But he should be, he's Vader!"

XWingTMG,3cpymp,nyrmduck,3,Thu Jul 9 20:59:36 2015 UTC,"I like it. Needs a bit of work though, it's a bit clumsy at the moment. I've also been thinking about a potential X-wing buff, and while I don't think it's half as necessary as most people on here seem to think it is, the X wings could use a little something to make them sparkle a bit more. A thematic Rogue Squadron upgrade would be nicer than a simple 'AM droids cost one less point' title card. And while they could probably be 'fixed' by releaseing a couple of new 'must have' AM droids so that slot becomes a bit more valuable, a title card would just be cooler.  I'm not sure about the two hits per shield idea though. It might be too much on the joust, and it'd just never be used if there was a chance of getting attacked from out of arc. You're on the right lines though."
XWingTMG,3cpymp,Shgrizz,3,Thu Jul 9 23:24:12 2015 UTC,"I don't like it, only because it seems like something any ship with shields should be able to do. Anything that is intended to give the X Wing a buff should be something specific to the X Wing.  Something that reflects it's four (huge) laser cannons, or gives it a discount on droids or something."
XWingTMG,3cpymp,Charlie-Green-Rug,1 point,Thu Jul 9 23:29:23 2015 UTC,"Something that reflects it's four (huge) laser cannons,   Should just be a 2-3pt x wing only mod that increases its attack value by 1."
XWingTMG,3cpymp,MaximusNerdius,2,Fri Jul 10 06:31:11 2015 UTC,"I like where you're going; I had similar ideas along the 'ship management' path, but having it be forward only is certainly a difficult trade off.  The key problem with X-Wing right now is that they do one thing: joust, with no tricks, plain and simple. They make one movement. They can either focus or target lock, basic die modifications, that's all. They can shoot once at whatever is front of them, no other options. They get one shot with a torpedo, if you're lucky.  B-Wings are much the same, but they get attack options with cannons and multiple torpedoes. The system slot lets them time their actions, play tricks, get action economy, and now they can even take a crew. Options, mixups, even within the jousting role they play. And they can barrel roll to make up for their positioning.  The astromechs introduced so far don't really do much to mix up these actions above (not as much as the salvaged astromechs are doing for Scum Y-Wings). The greatest thing they provide for X-Wings is flexibility and synergy with the unique pilots. And I feel if they just introduce a new, signature kickass astromech it would really kill that flexibility, unless it was designed to go on generic pilots."
XWingTMG,3cpymp,3rd_Charmer,0,Fri Jul 10 05:23:19 2015 UTC,"I like the idea, but I think it would work better if it acted like the reinforce action of the big ships. Make it an astromech, Xwing only, so you can't combo it with R2-D2."

XWingTMG,3cnzzi,Nomnomnicon,3,Thu Jul 9 11:43:32 2015 UTC,"Vader crew matches are always going to be tough for you, since they can cheaply burn through your meager 10 health. Keeping at R3 should do you wonders defensively for the rest of the damage though. With 2 sets of 4 red dice, you can pack quite a punch.   Against ships like Carnor who REALLY want to get in your face, you need to offload those missiles to slow him down. (Have whisper burn through his tokens first) Admittedly its reduced damaged output, since you only get 1 R3 damage, but Stressed/ioned interceptors are dead interceptors. Since they are kind enough to stress themselves, all you have to do is ion them."
XWingTMG,3co2go,bl1y,7,Thu Jul 9 12:12:16 2015 UTC,"""Stalling"" is not the same as ""Kiting."""
XWingTMG,3co2go,leewardstyle,3,Thu Jul 9 12:24:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah, this is my perspective too.  OP is attempting to stay alive as long as possible, nothing more.  He's not slow-playing, he's just playing evasively.    This is definitely not a tactic that I would endorse in a casual/untimed game, since you're just delaying the inevitable.  But in this case OP was playing for the win.  Typically playing for the win involves killing your opponent's ships, but in this case it simply involved not getting killed before the match ended.    The key point is that he was playing to win.  He wasn't stalling or slow-playing, he was actively playing with the strategy which would most likely win the game for him."
XWingTMG,3co2go,mxzf,3,Thu Jul 9 16:19:23 2015 UTC,"OP is attempting to stay alive as long as possible, nothing more.   Oh, it's definitely something more. The running away part is fine, but that's not really what I was asking about. It's the barrel roll when you're a mile away from the action.  Might there be deep strategy about positioning 3 turns down? Sure. But I'll stipulate that I was not doing it for better position, and barrel rolled for the sole purpose of eating time.  I think it's perfectly legal, but there's another question of whether it's unsportsmanlike, and that really just depends on the culture of the game. It's perfectly sporting to run out the clock in football, for instance. But, it's a penalty if you ice the kicker twice, despite having time outs to burn."
XWingTMG,3co2go,mxzf,2,Thu Jul 9 19:57:11 2015 UTC,"Eh, I still wouldn't hold it against you.  You're still not slow-playing, you're just making the most of your turn.    I could see the argument for this being a gray area, but at the same time it's a completely rational way to play in a time-limited game and there's nothing inherently wrong with playing to win like that.    In my eyes, that barrel roll was a move to secure a more successful position.  But rather than a more successful position in the XY plane, it was a more successful position in time.  You were moving towards the end of the timer rather than any given spot on the board.  The key point, in my mind, is that you were intentionally moving towards your goal, rather than trying to drag your feet and prevent the game from changing."
XWingTMG,3co2go,leewardstyle,5,Thu Jul 9 20:18:11 2015 UTC,"Concur in part, dissent in part, and concur in the conclusion, as the kids are wont to say.  I would say that I was slow playing, but doing so in a fair way. I think what really sealed it for me is the counter argument, that I'd somehow not be allowed to take an action just because I'm far away and the clock is ticking. That can't possibly be right, so by deduction, we know the movement is allowed."

XWingTMG,3co2go,AffixBayonets,5,Thu Jul 9 15:37:10 2015 UTC,"This is a natural part of strategy consideration in timed competitive play. With the current scoring system, and a victory condition set by time, you MUST have a plan regarding that limit.  The map size is the limitation here, limiting run away options.  Similarly, you must also be prepared for facing this situation on the other side of the table and establish a take-down plan when a fortess ship changes strategy and bails out for points.  It's not the most pleasant aspect of the game, but it is an aspect. So long as you are not intentionally ""playing"" slowly, it's valid. Making decisions that elongate the battle when elongating the battle puts you in an advantageous position is not unsporting. It is strategy. It's not a particularly fun or fulfilling strategy, but it is strategy. I am not going to ask you to suicide your fortress ship into me or anything. I have to hunt it down and kill it myself. After a metric ton of competitive play, I have come to accept that I simply need to consider how I am going to ""seal the deal"" in this situation."

This lets them get the feel of dials and maneuvers and shooting before introducing the bits that make the game more complicated like actions or handling entire fleets of ships.  From there, introduce a new mechanic into the game each time. Simple fleets, such as 8 academy have fewer card interactions than a firespray with K4 droid and PtL"

It's the rookie vs academy and obsidian, but I keep actions in the game and leave the maneuver dials as-are instead of making all white.  Then I'll go to a 100 point game with upgrades after they get the basic idea from that."
XWingTMG,3cp5iw,VanderLegion,2,Thu Jul 9 18:17:59 2015 UTC,"What those gents said.   Here's my algorithm for a game with several casual gamers:  First game: no actions, no upgrades, no special pilots, no rocks. Stress is still okay - it's pretty intuitive that if you do a 'crazy' maneuver you can't do it again right away. You make the squads. People get to fly around and shoot each other. They have a good time. They want more.  Second game: full rules - actions, stress, asteroids. But no upgrades, no special pilots. Or, if you want, add some hints of what is to come - maybe one special ability per side. Now they start to realize that there's a lot more to being a good player than they bargained for. But you still make up the squads, unless your friends are into that (in which case you should just let them pilfer your card collection and do what they want, cause they're the type who will come back).  Official rules say that teammates can't show dials to each other. I get that, between hardcore gamers. If you want to make casual people enthusiastic and have fun right off the bat, though, I strongly advise dial sharing. It's fun, the less committed players don't feel under pressure to perform since they get advice, and you get to laugh a lot. Enough said."

The former is a pretty common word for that in other contexts and isn't an official ffg game type, so not everyone knows it is a game type.  I think the original point was good. Like squints and b-wings, starvipers can zoom around within an asteroid cluster pretty nimbly. With durability and action economy somewhere between those two, it should feel pretty odd if you try to fly it like either. Odd ship I have yet to quite get the hang of outside the asteroids."

XWingTMG,3cprli,Johnny_the_sock,2,Thu Jul 9 20:10:02 2015 UTC,"General buying guide: https://www.reddit.com/r/XWingTMG/wiki/faq/buying  A standalone B-Wing and/or an E-Wing could be good purchases for you. A loaded up Falcon with the title, Engine Upgrade, and some crew can be a good basis for a list. Then fill in the rest of the list with either a single strong pilot like Wedge Antilles or Corran Horn, or 2-3 good generics, like 2 B-Wings.  Alternatively, if you want to start playing around with Rebel support builds, pick up a HWK-290 and see what you can do with it. I saw a really fun list recently that used Jan Ors, Keyan Farlander, and Wes Janson. Wes had Veteran Instincts to fire first and strip off a token or two, Keyan had Opportunist to get an extra attack die against targets with no tokens, and then Jan would pull up behind Keyan and use her ability to give Keyan another attack die, for a crazy big attack. Builds like this can be really fun, though they tend to fall apart once your support ship gets blown up."
XWingTMG,3cprli,EdgeOfDreams,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:18:27 2015 UTC,"There seem to be three rebel lists that you'll see at the top of the pile pretty consistently: Fat Han, BBBBZ, and Rebel Control (centered around stress and ion mechanics).  With what you currently have, it won't be possible to recreate any of the top tier builds unless you proxy upgrade cards. If you are mostly playing against friends, that shouldn'y be an issue at all. Google ""Fat Han"" and you will find plenty of results on what all goes into it. Toss on a few a wings or Keyan Farlander or whatever else, and you're all set!    But, the best thing to do is just keep flying man! Put lists together that look fun, try new combos out, don't worry too much about the meta, and just have a ball!"

To approximate the list, use proton rockets on the a-wing, buff the falcon to maximum and put movement upgrades and autothrusters everywhere. You need maximum mobility on both ships and bucket of defense and dicerolls on the Falcon. You won't have their tier 1 without certain specific cards (C-3PO) but it'll be OK for casual if you know what you're doing."

XWingTMG,3cpcwi,scuff,4,Fri Jul 10 18:12:40 2015 UTC,"Something for the X-Wing is almost certainly coming in Wave 8. The designers have said they're aware of the issues it has. They likely are waiting for Wave 8 to be a tie-in with the new Force Awakens movie that's coming later this year, and the movie features a modified version of the X-Wing we all know and love.  Besides that, Twin Laser Turret is a big deal for Rebel Y-Wings and HWKs. Horton Salm will likely finally see use thanks to the synergy with his pilot ability. Rebel HWKs also love it because it means they can support their allies from further back while still taking pot-shots  at the enemy.  Extra Munitions is also going to help every faction about equally. Again, Y-Wings will be happy to get it, both for Rebels and Scum.  We also don't know what Advanced Homing Missiles do. They might turn out to be a good counter to dodgy foes like Whisper and Fel."
XWingTMG,3cpcwi,Glucose98,3,Thu Jul 9 18:35:59 2015 UTC,"On the imperial side, the recent changes have made swarms drop significantly in tournament viability, and of course there was the phantom changes.  The previous Imperial lists were pretty much all swarms or phantoms, so of course you're going to see a lot of changes.  The HWK did just get a more dramatic buff.... just not for the rebels. Rebel Y-wings got a huge boost recently.  For wave 7, the new munitions rules help out Y-wings and B-wings as well as K, TIE-B, and TIE-P.  The K-wing has a new super-boost, and the twin laser turret gets rid of the disadvantage titled Y-wings had."

Go look at the stats for him, some people have used him HHHZ with success. he has one of the best abilities out there right now. Just because you can't make him work doesn't mean he isn't competitive.   I don't understand the hate on the HWK, while yes its dial sucks, it is pretty decent little ship, he is well worth the points to toss an ion cannon on him and watch him just ruin your opponents plans."

XWingTMG,3cmwk6,HujoeBigs,1 point,Thu Jul 9 22:38:09 2015 UTC,"Except it really isn't people think unless it is 8+ health behind 2-3 green dice the ship is fragile. Its a really weak excuse. I've had HWKs that last much longer then a B or Y because I made them come for it instead of just flying it into the maw of the enemy team. Then again, after watching so many battle reports and vassal games, most people just wanna straight line joust which explains most of their opinions. Strategy is hard."

XWingTMG,3cmwk6,Screaming_Beavers,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:49:51 2015 UTC,Shield is a great choice too. I find engine can help for arc management if you are stuck to green banks to regen shields. But again at that point a lot of it comes down to personal player preference and familiarity with the fleet.
XWingTMG,3cmwk6,MysteriousRacer_X,1 point,Fri Jul 10 01:17:20 2015 UTC,"VI Wes and Opportunist Wedge is an awesome combo. I think you're carrying some dead weight though. You'll want to be able to modify Wes and Wedge's super-attacks, so your actions will likely go to Target Locks and Focusing, not boosting. R5-D8 is tough on an X Wing since they only have 2 hp, and often will be destroyed before they can use it even once. A hull upgrade offers a lot more benefit for the same price, but again, that may not be the way to go.  If you lose the astromechs and the engine upgrades, you can fit in a Z 95 as a nice blocking option. Overall solid though, I seriously love VI Wes with Opportunist Wedge!"

You'd use him during the first pass to mitigate damage, but in most other rounds, you'd rely on engine upgrade just to boost out of arc.

XWingTMG,3cnuon,pie904,1 point,Thu Jul 9 10:34:50 2015 UTC,"Mangler Cannon would do a far better job than calculation + recon specialist. Not to mention it would ignore range agility bonus to your target. Not being able to use it from your rear arc would be the only downside, but if you play accordingly it wouldn't be such an issue. I would also add a tactician. It works on both of her arcs."
XWingTMG,3cnuon,Rudithus,1 point,Thu Jul 9 11:25:58 2015 UTC,"I actually think the recspec and calculation is better than mangler. Yes you lose the range bonus from mangler but you get the same effect from the rear arc which cant be underestimated (if youre not using the rear arc then why are you flying a firespray!). It's the same cost and it gives you the option of using those focus on defence if you get in a tight spot. Or if you only roll one eye on attack (which is likely) then you have the second for defence.   The only downfall is if you are bumping a lot, and of course you lose your ept slot which is xwing gold. But if you like the build and are out of points thats not a factor."
XWingTMG,3cnuon,Rory_braker,1 point,Thu Jul 9 13:08:42 2015 UTC,"I really like this list. I flew something similar (buzzsaw Whisper instead of Kath) in a tournament on the weekend and went 4-1. Lost to fat dash and a HLC fringer after I landed whisper on some debris. The problem with my list is that Whisper and Soontir are both ps 9 and one wants initiative while the other does not (a bet both ways in my mind).  The other problem however is that they are both quite squishy and you are likely to lose one early against a good player. Kath obviously doesn't have that problem. I have tried Vessery as that early/midgame damage dealer but he can get focussed down quickly too. I think Kath could work really well in that roll, and especially this build because you can play her aggressively or defensively depending on how your opponent engages. Which also gives you more flexibility with how you use the baron.   I will definitely be trying this out."
XWingTMG,3cnuon,Rory_braker,1 point,Thu Jul 9 13:19:30 2015 UTC,How do you recommend I fly this build?
XWingTMG,3cnuon,Rory_braker,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:17:27 2015 UTC,"I'm not that experienced with the firespray so I can't speak to that. Just make sure you look after fel early. If you keep alive until the end then he can really shine.   The shuttle is there to take the pressure off. If it's not being engaged then get it up in their grill. It is useless if you lose your other ships.   The firespray is there to deal your early and midgame damage. Make sure you keep your acrs broad because high PS move after you. Kath can be pretty aggressive with the recspec because you spend them on defence if required. You would still prefer them attacking the shuttle early though.   One thing I have never understood is why people run the firespray up the side of the board. It makes the rear arc useless because when you pass them you have to turn in and point your rear arc towards the edge, making it easy to arc dodge. Keep your asteroids sparse in the middle so you can have options, and fly that sucker around unpredictably.   The final thing is if they decide to engage fel early, get him on his bike. He can outmanouver anyone (except probably Vader) so lead the opponent across the arcs of kath and the shuttle. If you can temp the opponent into engaging fel, and then do this, you have gone a long way in winning the match.   And make sure you smash that shuttle up before your opponent gets in behind. Even if you only use Vader on it once. It's there to distract while your guns get to work. If you fly past the opponent without using Vader then you have wasted the doom shuttle."
XWingTMG,3cnuon,Nomnomnicon,1 point,Fri Jul 10 08:53:30 2015 UTC,"I've always found Firesprays a little lumbering, but that's just preference. I agree with /u/Rory_braker on Calc+RecSpec over Mangler Canon due to rear arc shenanigans. Ideally I'd run both and Tactician but you obviously don't have points for that currently.  Standard Soontir, he'll work if you don't crash.   Question: How attached are you to the Shuttle? I'd bear it in mind that with two fairly slow ships your opponent just has to kill Soontir before he can start getting board placement. The two big ships are tough, but you have to decide whether you can get them on target often enough with EU's.  I would fly the shuttle in lengths up and down the board - it takes you effectively three rounds to turn it back on target (2-turn, 1-bank, 1-bank) and during that time you're going to be fairly easy prey. Judicious use of the All-Stop will be key to catching opponents off guard, and I suggest doing it in the first round so you effectively stay on the start line for a turn."

XWingTMG,3ckvxn,NCC-2000,7,Wed Jul 8 21:17:11 2015 UTC,"I suspect it's not so much that Tarn is underrated--he's got a grade A ability, especially when paired with an R7--it's just that he's in an X-Wing. As good as he is, in high level play most people are going to want something more effective than an X-wing. When this mythical X-wing fix comes out, I think we'll be seeing a whole lot more of Tarn meeting his full competitive potential."

No one wants to divert forces to hunt him since he's much more durable than his 25 points suggests, and the other pilots are protected in the Biggs bubble. Sometimes it doesn't work because you really need to trade well on that first clash of ships, and if Wedge wiffs his dice or the enemy rolls really well you can be at a pretty steep disadvantage, but Tarn has always performed well. He's so durable that no one wants to shoot at him and when they DO shoot at him, it can take a lot of shots to bring him down."

XWingTMG,3cmdfg,ObviousForeshadow,3,Thu Jul 9 01:02:36 2015 UTC,Marksmanship and Engine Upgrade work against each other since they both require actions.  I think if you want a Triple X build you have to go for sheer damage. I think you shouldn't spend points on keeping Biggs alive and instead spend those points on making your other 2 X's do as much damage as possible for the turn he protects them.
XWingTMG,3cmdfg,PCGamerPirate,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:14:46 2015 UTC,"I would mostly agree. Dropping the Biggs upgrades you could give Garven an EU, making him a PS8 with EU so actually has a chance at arc dodging. Though, four defense dice with a focus can be hard to chew through so it's not terrible. Especially at range 3.  I would definitely change Wedge's EPT to Predator."
XWingTMG,3cmdfg,justsomeguyorgal,1 point,Thu Jul 9 03:12:20 2015 UTC,I'd say predator works better than marksmanship with EU. Alternatively push the limit but that will restrict you a bit too much.  I like the idea of Biggs with 4 agility though!
XWingTMG,3cmdfg,theblackthorne,1 point,Thu Jul 9 08:53:33 2015 UTC,"The problem is, even with Garven at PS 8, there's a lot of things that will shoot at Biggs before he gets to focus: Soontir, Chirpy + VI (or regular Chirpy if he has initiative), Han - that Stealth is going to fall of and fall of sooner rather then later.   Biggs works best when he's cheapest - he's going to die anyway, so giving your opponent more points for killing him is not a good idea :)"
XWingTMG,3cmdfg,KasztanekChaosu,1 point,Thu Jul 9 10:42:01 2015 UTC,"My friend runs R5-T1 on Wedge, so he can boost into range one of his target, get a TL and the roast them alive. Scares the hell out of most things. Predator over Marksmanship on your build for Wedge, move the EU to Garven if you use R5 on Wedge.   Personally I would R2-D2 Biggs and give him EU over stealth, so he can do a green move and still get distance/arc dodge afterwards. He doesn't really have to shoot stuff as much as get in the way.   You can probably knock a ship a turn off a swarm with 9-12 attack dice. Maybe I'm being optimistic (definitely so at Range 3) but they probably won't be able to do the same to you as most swarms have 2 red dice/ship. If you use the EU's and long moves you may even be able to flank them slightly for the initial joust, avoiding a few arcs if not all.  BBBB might be tough, since they have 8 hits and lots of dice, and you aren't exceptionally more maneouvreable than them. Potentially Deci-Fel if you let Fel get behind you, or Fel/Phantom with a mini-swarm.  Last tip would be set up centrally but at an angle to make it easier for you to get that flank, unless they set up on a flank as well - then set up on the far flank."

As for the squad, I've never been a fan of Biggs, my triple X list is either Luke/Garven/Wedge or Wes/Wedge/Luke, but I've been favoring the latter recently since it isnt dependent on Garven's ability."

I don't play rebels, to clarify, so all my comments on based on what I find difficult to deal with. One day I'll try them but...I just love Phantoms too much.  I get that Luke can Force-Turtle quite well, and that's how I'd play him if he was my only X-Wing. Late game X's are pretty good - especially any with R2-D2. R5-P9 seems good, but I don't like the reliance on having a Focus left. Although it's a toss up between that and being limited to Green moves - I'd probably get EU and R2-D2. Maybe. If I play rebels."
XWingTMG,3cmdfg,Nomnomnicon,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:03:50 2015 UTC,"well, youre going to be focusing constantly anyway, lone wolf has anti-synergy with target lock.  Focus can (on the right roll) let you get that big game winning roll in, while between his skill and lone wolf you probably dont need the focus defensively (but you have it just in case).  So odds are, you leave the focus on and regen shield.  It's really leveraging the flexibility of the focus action."

XWingTMG,3ck9zg,JChavDanath,2,Thu Jul 9 15:23:09 2015 UTC,"So question.  What are we supposed to do in the case of disagreements?  Had a situation come up in my first game with JChav where I tried to k-turn around kath and ended up just on the edge of whether it overlapped or not.  I think it looks like the nubs were JUUUUST right next to the other ship, basically touching but not actually overlapping.  He thinks they were just barely overlapping.  It was a potentially fairly important difference wehther I made the k-turn or not (game still in progress so we'll see how it ends up).  There were a couple spectators but no one was responding to ask anyone else, so we had to end up rolling for it.  But having to go on rando luck really sucks for the loser of the roll for something important in a tournament.  The downside of an online tournament is we can't just call the TO over for a ruling..."

XWingTMG,3ck9zg,antigrapist,2,Tue Jul 14 04:13:04 2015 UTC,New to reddit so sorry for the late response. I really wish my game didn't lose connection so I still had the log file. If I was smart I could have ask Muon to jump into our room and take a look as he is the 'keeper' of vassal right now.  The big thing to me is when we nudged the ship with shift arrow the nubs went passed the ships base line while un-nudged Kaths nub appeared very clearly on the Ys ship base line.   In the end I think it gave you 58 points as you were able to keep Xizor alive 1 more turn killing off Kath which I would have preferred you were able to complete the maneuver. The downside it you would have had a shot on Echo with the Y (not sure on range) and maybe could have Ion'ed her. Kind of wish I had a log file to go back and check to see what the difference would look like. Any chance you could send it to jschavez <at> live <dot> com?
XWingTMG,3ck9zg,VanderLegion,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:26:50 2015 UTC,"Any chance you could send it to jschavez <at> live <dot> com?   Hrm.  I just loaded up the logfile on my other machine and it's not actually displaying any ships for me.  I see chat stuff appearing, but no ships on the map...I'll have to go try loading it on the machine I was using when we played and see if that makes a difference.   The big thing to me is when we nudged the ship with shift arrow the nubs went passed the ships base line while un-nudged Kaths nub appeared very clearly on the Ys ship base line.   This was the source of the disagreement.  To me, it looked clearly like kath's nubs were directly next to the base line (touching, but not overlapping), while JC thought hey were overlapping. And if you nudged the y-wing 1 away from Kath, you ended up with a space between then, which if the lines were overlapping should have ended up with them directly next to each other after nudging away.   In the end I think it gave you 58 points as you were able to keep Xizor alive 1 more turn killing off Kath which I would have preferred you were able to complete the maneuver. The downside it you would have had a shot on Echo with the Y (not sure on range) and maybe could have Ion'ed her.   Yah, who knows what would have happened if I'd gotten the k-turn.  the y-wing would have had shot back at echo to potentially damage and/or ion, and who knows if you woul dhave flown echo the same way with the y-wing getting a bead on her.  I'll see if I can get the logfile to work for me to post a screenshot.  Was hoping to load it up on my windows machine to see if using a different OS and different screen resolution made a difference on what it looked like for some reason (it SHOULDN'T I wouldn't think, but would easily explain the difference if it did...)"
XWingTMG,3ck9zg,VanderLegion,2,Tue Jul 14 04:03:15 2015 UTC,"Got it working.  Wasn't working in offline, but loaded it in an online roomand it worked fine.  Here's a screenshot after the k-turn: http://i.imgur.com/YD4g3S1.png  Edit: Nudged images:  Nudged back: http://i.imgur.com/sNJDO9u.png there's clearly a pixel of space between the ships now  Nudged forward: http://i.imgur.com/uKpo359.png to me kath's nubs look like they're now overlapping the y-wings base, while they-wings nubs look like a tiny bit might go just past kaths' base.  The problem using those is that if nudge only goes 1 pixel, then they shouldn't BOTH happen.  Either they should overlap, and going forward would put you past while going backward would put you next to each other with no space.  But its basically giving both results.  A forward shows a nub going just past (thoug hon my screen it's the y-wings nubs that look to just barely overlap the line, not kath's) while a backward gives mpty space between them.  Could you post  screenshot of what you're seeing /u/JChavDanath if you're seeing something actually different from me (as opposed to different interpretations of the same thing)"
XWingTMG,3ck9zg,VanderLegion,1 point,Tue Jul 14 04:12:47 2015 UTC,"When I looked at it last night, at max zoom in vassal, I leaned towards there being no overlap. But after zooming all the way in on a photo, you can see that Kath's nubs (especially the bottom one) are on the Y's base by one or two pixels. Looks like the die result came out the correct way."
XWingTMG,3ck9zg,JChavDanath,1 point,Tue Jul 14 04:19:08 2015 UTC,"Zooming all the way in on an image editor presents it's own problems.  That's partly where the fuzziness comes in.  Where exactly do you count as being the lines for the base and the nubs?  It looks to me like the lines are supposed to be 2 pixels wide based on looking at kaths' base while zoomed way in on the image.  It also looks, again based on kath's line, like the nubs start in the outside of the 2 lines.  A couple images to support the 2 line width:  http://imgur.com/a/UfGo9  The first image is zoomed in adding a couple white pixels.  One directly next to the double brighter line on kath, one outside all the lines for kath (the darker grey) and one outside all the lines for the thug.  The one directly next to the double line looks to be next to it still while zoomed out, not overlapping, and the other two both look to be a pixel out from the lines.    More images: http://imgur.com/a/sRmqY  First one shows what it looks like to me should be the actual nub going with a 2 pixel width.  Second shows the thug's nub  Third is where the baseline would be based on the 2 pixel width and the nub starting in the center of the base line (accounting for the thug's extra blurriness).  Last image extends that line up further to where it would be directly next to Kath's nub, not overlapping."

XWingTMG,3ck9zg,antigrapist,1 point,Tue Jul 14 04:45:37 2015 UTC,Where'd the maneuver template come from?  The squad I was using was saved before the automatic templates for collisions were added so I had to place a maneuver template manually to move the thug back to the other side of kath.  Any manually placed maneuver template comes with the possibility of not being placed 100 % correct...
XWingTMG,3ck9zg,JChavDanath,1 point,Tue Jul 14 04:52:18 2015 UTC,I manually placed one. you're welcome to as well. /u/antigrapist is the backup TO and he thinks it bumped. Not sure what else you want to do about it. The zooms look different at various zoomed but the most reliable is the most zoomed. I remember seeing one that looked very obviously overly bumped. Anyways If PCPirate wants to message me to resolve this that's fine otherwise I won't know what else to do. /u/PCGamerPirate
XWingTMG,3ck9zg,VanderLegion,1 point,Tue Jul 14 05:18:42 2015 UTC,"I wasn't even necessarily looking for a ruling calling it the other way, mostly just wanting to know what to do if it happens in another game (or for anyone else).  Not sure what would happen if they called it not a bump anyway."
XWingTMG,3ck9zg,JChavDanath,3,Tue Jul 14 05:21:24 2015 UTC,"Specifically for questions about bumping, I'd lean towards needing to see black pixels on max zoom between two objects for them to not be overlapping. It's just the most consistent rule I can think of.  In general, you did the right thing. If you genuinely disagree, rolling a die to settle it is a fine way to decide, and what the TO at a regional I went to had two players do. Asking the audience, or a regular vassal player in an another room for an impartial ruling is good as long as your opponent is okay with it.  If it's a game deciding problem, you could always message both of us with the log file and agree on a new time to finish the game."
XWingTMG,3ck9zg,VanderLegion,1 point,Tue Jul 14 05:38:31 2015 UTC,https://boardgamegeek.com/image/2589846/danath?size=original  Also no shot on Kath and R3 on Echo. But my other image shows the nub goes passed the movement template.  To answer your other question my images look just like yours.
XWingTMG,3ck9zg,EdgeOfDreams,1 point,Tue Jul 14 05:07:48 2015 UTC,"Also no shot on Kath and R3 on Echo. But my other image shows the nub goes passed the movement template.   No shot on kath, but like you said, a shot on echo (that would almost certainly have missed, but that's not a guarantee), and he might have been lined up to have range 1 shots on echo the next round or else might have forced you to do something different with echo that could have left Xizor alive."
XWingTMG,3ck9zg,VanderLegion,1 point,Tue Jul 14 05:30:46 2015 UTC,Xizor took 6 damage and passed 2 off to the bumped thug. Kath would have lived the next round freeing echo to attack your other ships 2 of which were at 3 life.
XWingTMG,3ck9zg,MrSunol,1 point,Tue Jul 14 05:44:42 2015 UTC,"Kath lived to the next round anyway.  You did the damge to Xizor leaving me at 1 hp.  NExt round Echo decloaked, kath moved out, xizor followed and echo came behind Xizor.  Xizor killed kath, then echo killed xizor.  If you'd gone to attack one of the other ships that was at low health xizor would have survived the round.  If you'd gone after xizor still, I probably would have had close range shots with the thug.  Unforutnately, having already played through the way we did there's no way to know what would have actually happened.  Edit: It didn't help that the round after I cleared the stress from the failed k-turn I somehow accidentally set hte dial to another green straigt instead of the k-turn I meant to do so it took me even longer to get that thug back into the fight.  That part had nothing to do with the dispute though, was just an massive failure on my part :P"

If you keep winning with a specific build then switch it up and prove that you can win with another build.   We would like to do more swarms but they are a tad costly unfortunately.

I lost miserably to a Soontir with 5 Obsidians this past weekend. I had 3 Blues with tactician, and one with Ion cannon, so I was baiting Soontir and had him double stressed, but couldn't get him down. The turn after, I managed to Ion him, while he's still stressed. Couldn't get him down! All this time, the 5 Obsidians is plinking away my shields from behind.  Had I gone after the TIEs first, Soontir would have had an easy picking, arc dodging my remaining ships. The B-Wing goes down fast, if you can focus fire. It looks like a lot of shields and hull, but with no green dice to protect it, it don't last long."

That said, those squads probably account for only 30% of what people bring. I think with how many stores we have here, people feel free to experiment a lot. Last night I got to see how effective Tarn can be. He gets right up in your face, tempts you with a range 1 shot, and then you remember that he can choose to keep the target lock and use it back against you when he shoots. You end up killing everyone else instead. He's anti-Biggs."

Bomb tokens can be recycled very easily. You won't need four Proton Bomb tokens in order to use them.  Mines are different, but only somewhat. Typically, because it costs you an action to drop your mines, you want them to pay off immediately, either by dropping them directly on a ship, or in such a way that they will be detonated later in the round or - at the latest - the next round. If you drop a mine token and it hasn't detonated four rounds later, you likely have bigger problems than needing an extra token to drop another mine - like worrying about how you are going to rebound from losing that quarter of your list with nothing to show for it.  TL;DR -- One set of tokens per package is plenty.  Source: Avid bomb dropper."
XWingTMG,3cltzk,Suicidal_Ferret,1 point,Wed Jul 8 23:47:47 2015 UTC,Couldn't you use mines as area denial (like irl?) so having them sit on the table just to make the opponent want to stay away from that side has a value on its own?

Borrow extra tokens from someone, don't run Extra Munitions, practice until you can successfully deploy your mines to maximum effect.  If FFG included zero sets of tokens for these upgrades, you'd have a point. Since they include one set to go with the one card, it's really not a big deal.

Personally, I have magnets under my ship for attracting to a metal sheet under my playmat, so that wouldn't work so well for me.    Also, I would be hesitant to do that because the thickness of the glass would make it so that the only way to get a good view of the map would be top-down, since there would be a gap between the projected image (under the glass) and the ships themselves (on top of the glass).    The only way I could see that working well is if the fabric or maybe fogged glass to hold the image was on top of the glass, rather than under it."

Are you attacking or defending? If so, are there any other friendly ships at range 1-2? If no, then you're all set.

XWingTMG,3cjb4f,fl1p_problems,3,Wed Jul 8 10:29:08 2015 UTC,"That is a very interesting idea. some suggestions:   Rules: Shoot each other. Also shoot the space football (0 green dice). Each damage point moves it 10cm/4"" directly away from the firer.   I would alter the rules for shooting. When you have one squad determined to hit the ball and one squad determined to kill everyone on the enemy team, the squad trying to play ball won't have much fun.  I'd alter the damage rules like this:  All damage taken from attacks follows the rules for ion damage: (Range bonus is applied as usual)  if the ship is hit take 1 damage and 1 ion marker.   If a ship is destroyed, it can be re-deployed at the beginning of the next movement phase touching the friendly board edge, but not in front of the goal.  The ball is treated as an indestructible object with AG0. for each  hit the ball takes in an attack it is immediately moved straight away from the attacker with the movement template fitting to the number of hits (3 hits = 3 straight)  You have to line up your shots carefully (High PS shoots first) to get the ball going where you want it to.  The ball flies through enemy ships, so you can't block shots.  When moving ships, when a ships movement template or final position overlaps the ball, the ball is moved to the front of the moving ship, between the two movement guides. The ship may take actions as normal.  This allows dribbling during the movement phase. If you line up your movements carefully you are even able to pass on the ball to a friendly ship.   Oh, and of course: the ball can be shot at even if touching it.  No flying off the field: If a ship overlaps the edge of the board, it is immediately turned facing away from the edge (inwards). This counts as a ""bump"", so no actions, but you may shoot.  Modifications: Only Ion and Flechette Cannons are allowed, which follow their ususal rules (count every hit as hit though, when moving the ball) and only Ion Turrets.   Sounds good? ;)"
XWingTMG,3cjb4f,fl1p_problems,2,Wed Jul 8 14:11:00 2015 UTC,"Thanks for taking the time to reply.   When you have one squad determined to hit the ball and one squad determined to kill everyone on the enemy team, the squad trying to play ball won't have much fun   This is what I want to fix, but not with ions. It has to be full regular combat.  I should have mentioned we tried 60 mins/12 turns (whichever is first).  If you went for combat you would have to clear the entire table or you'd lose on goals.   We tried BBBBZ vs Corran and Dash. Corran kept punting the ball around, the Bs couldnt keep up with him and Corran won it on goals (the Z can keep up, but a double tap removes it). Need to try it again with something like XXXX or Tie Interceptors (pretty sure that will win vs either of what we tried).

However i want space football also be a regular battle, so I don't want to force people to use ions.  It should in theory be possible to balance with regular combat. There's many times in a regular game you have just 1 Z-95 or something left, and no-one can really catch it to kill it within the time allowed. So if he can still control the ball, that player could still win.  I meant what force (army list) would you recommend we test with?  edit: We are running it again tonight and will experiment with your dribbling."

Great maneuverability and lots of ships.  I'd probably try something similar with the ""battle"" version, Whisper + 4-5 Ties or something like that."
XWingTMG,3ck018,chucknorrisinator,3,Wed Jul 8 14:41:15 2015 UTC,There is a mission in the IG88 pack that is designed for a three way battle between empire rebels and scum.  Otherwise I'd just play teams and ensure the totals for each side are the same (rather than for each player) or play furball (one ship free for all)
XWingTMG,3ck018,PCGamerPirate,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:49:04 2015 UTC,"I have always preferred to play teams when it comes to 3 people. Just balance the points is all. Free for alls are fun, but I feel like someone it's always a little disappointed by the end if it. Especially with something like a decimator that might not last long if two players decide it's the scariest thing on the battlefield.  I would say the play area only needs adjustments based on the amount of points used. 100 points is fine on the standard field, but 150 and 200 should use the extended map size or a custom size in between.  I'd say if you can get a fourth it's probably better, but I play 3 player games all the time and they are a load of fun. Just be wary of letting the new players make their own decisions and mistakes if they are on your team.  Enjoy the xwing!"
XWingTMG,3ck018,Blackxp,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:56:33 2015 UTC,"I think you could do 3 way games, however since you're not playing on a triangle or hexagon shaped table, I think you'd likely need to make a rule that you all have like 3 turns of movement and activation, no combat."

One way we dealt with it was my buddy and I came close to destroying each other while our third friend watched bemusedly.  After realizing we'd fallen for it again, we stopped shooting each other and turned on the odd man out.  Our other variant was that each person's victory condition was to kill the guy on his left.  I'm shooting at you.  You're shooting at him.  He's shooting at me.  If I shoot back at him, I'm helping you win.  My job is only to kill you.  This one was really interesting, and I've been meaning to suggest we try it again!"
XWingTMG,3ck018,mike_e_mcgee,1 point,Wed Jul 8 15:22:49 2015 UTC,"We recently played an interesting Furball match with three players:  We designed 5 tiers of ship with a set point limit,  one for each faction. At the beginning of the game you would roll a dice to decide who got which ship, and doing this again when you lost your ship. The idea being that we each got to try out different ships and builds from factions you might not have played before.  Was great fun!"
XWingTMG,3ck018,FearOfBadgers,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:00:22 2015 UTC,"My friends and I are often playing in 3 to 5 person matches.  We've adopted a format that is fun and keeps things moving. Each player fields a squad of 3 small base ships:  one ship of no more than 30pts,  one 35pts,  one 40pts.  Everyone fields one ship at a time,  in any order they wish.  When that ship destroyed you deploy your next ship along any edge of the field,  not within range 3 of another ship. Last person standing wins."
XWingTMG,3ck018,DarthClank,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:04:19 2015 UTC,"In the rules, you play on a team, so it's not meant for 3 independent squads. I'd actually try that, since 1-1-1 matches can result in a lot of running away and hoping the other two will bloody each other, leaving you to clean up what's left.  What I'd do is give the squad with two players a point advantage, maybe 110 or 120 vs. 100.  The thing with having teams is that you cannot confer in private, or show your dials to your teammate. Any coordination must be open so your opponent can hear. One side has a strength advantage, but lacks coordination. The other is weaker, but has an easier time flying as a squad. You should also have initiative for each individual player (determined by how many points shy from your cap you are), which makes it harder to fly ships of equal pilot skill since your opponents don't get an option in who to move first."
XWingTMG,3ck018,bl1y,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:17:22 2015 UTC,"This sounds interesting, but I think that it will appeal most to more competitive/hardcore players.   Alternatively, for a more casual crowd, you can just let people on the same team show each other dials while planning. The advantage of doing this is that all players on a team get a good part of the experience of flying the whole squad. I've done this in 2x2, 3x3 and 3x4 formats with relatively new players and it's great fun."

They get a little something new for each tournament they go to and a bigger something new when they either win or make the top cut.   The red one is almost out of space for new stuff.  I ran him a lot with a similarly decked out Firespray. The blue/black one only has swag from when I started running brobots back in May.

I've noticed that a Howlrunner mini-swarm sets off a psychological need in many opponents to throw everything at howlrunner. Sometimes I'll give her a stealth device just to make this proposition a little sketchier.  This causes a surprising number of people to forget how mean Backstabber and Mauler can be, particularly when Mauler is running Predator or Outmaneuver.  SURPRISE! You just got TIE flanked! Excuse me while I roll my 5 dice for backstabber, 4 with re-roll for Mauler, and Dark takes his requisite 3 (all with re-rolls if you time your attack run alongside howl)"
XWingTMG,3ch22u,Tvayumat,6,Wed Jul 8 16:09:13 2015 UTC,"Backstabber with no upgrades can be a huge pain if left unchecked. If you do go after him, your opponent is only out 16 points.  Check out the strategy guide wiki on TIE Fighters here."
XWingTMG,3ch22u,PCGamerPirate,5,Tue Jul 7 22:16:41 2015 UTC,"The other named TIEs used to be much more popular in the early days of the game, but the wide variety of other ships released since then has put them out of favor. One cool build to try is actually all 6 named TIE Fighters flying together. If you can keep track of them all and maneuver them to take advantage of their different abilities, it can be quite fun."

XWingTMG,3ch22u,antigrapist,4,Tue Jul 7 23:14:38 2015 UTC,You will be seeing a lot more of Night Beast when the TIE Punisher comes out with the TIE Engine MKII mod.   As is Dark Curse and Backstabber are my favorite named TIE pilots. Great 16 pt fillers.
XWingTMG,3ch22u,WhiskeyReckless,3,Wed Jul 8 03:07:15 2015 UTC,Backstabber is easily some of the best 16 points you can spend. He's basically a super cheap Interceptor.
XWingTMG,3ch22u,GhostbearJ,2,Tue Jul 7 22:23:46 2015 UTC,"Yes. Dark Curse is indeed awesome. Mauler can wreck stuff if given the chance.  The other advantage to the named TIEs is having higher Pilot Skills. Some might argue that swarms need a mix of PS in the current meta to work. Lower PS for blocking, higher PS for shooting before deadliest enemies.  Maybe something like this  I know there are others that build swarms much better than me, so hopefully one of them comes along with advice."
XWingTMG,3ch22u,rsixidor,2,Tue Jul 7 21:24:24 2015 UTC,"I put together a list just yesterday with Dark Curse, Mauler+Outmaneuver, and Backstabber teamed up with Carnor Jax+Swarm Tactics and an Avenger interceptor. The main idea was to get Jax and Dark Curse together to deny evade and focus as much as possible while I shoot the rebel scum out of the sky, but I haven't had a chance to try it out yet."
XWingTMG,3ch22u,ryanismean,2,Tue Jul 7 21:37:30 2015 UTC,Love Nightbeast as a good middle ground between the pure defense of dark curse and the pure offense of backstabber and mauler.
XWingTMG,3ch22u,Droofus,2,Wed Jul 8 02:26:42 2015 UTC,On my table 'the beast' has reached legendary status. His tendency to be ignored in favour of other targets and the difficulty killing a ship pulling a focus and an evade with 3 agility dice mean he has a lot more chances to do damage than you would expect
XWingTMG,3ch22u,reverendmalerik,2,Wed Jul 8 07:11:35 2015 UTC,I love Mauler. It's so satisfying sneaking him in up close and throwing four red dice.

XWingTMG,3ch22u,Chozo_Hybrid,1 point,Wed Jul 8 01:07:16 2015 UTC,"Dark Curse and Backstabber are very playable. (an I often round out lists using one of them)  Dark Curse is great when you want a Tie to last as long as possible (looking to build more towards survivability) while Backstabber is the best single offensive Tie.   Some would argue Mauler is a more offensive Tie but Backstabber gets the bonus at all ranges (meaning range 1 you get just as many dice as mauler does at range 1 long as your flanking). But I love the dilemma that Backstabber creates for your opponent. If they do not turn and face Backstabber he's getting his bonus making him hit hard and a Tie is a temping target but if they do, your other ships should be getting in free shots. He forces a flank and some hard choices for your opponent that you can capitalize on."

XWingTMG,3ch22u,mikodz,1 point,Wed Jul 8 05:58:44 2015 UTC,"Ah, but Mauler gets an EPT.  Predator and close range sees him throwing four red and re-rolling one (two if you time his attack run with Howl and co.)  Toss Outmaneuver on him and he can nullify defense dice where Backstabber would be taking extra attacks.  Usually, I'll run both. Mauler with EPT and Backstabber on the board are a LOT of potential damage, particularly using Backstabber as you describe, to sort of lead the enemy around the board as they try to keep him in-arc."
XWingTMG,3ch22u,Tvayumat,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:04:48 2015 UTC,Yeah true but that's four more points. :) An sometimes those 4 points matter.  I was purely talking in a Tie Fighter vs Tie Fighter sense. (I E if you had to pick one)
XWingTMG,3ch22u,Dakkon_B,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:00:27 2015 UTC,"True enough.  Still, when there are enough nearly identical TIEs on the board, I've had opponents forget about that one lonely EPT until it bit them outside of the firing arc."
XWingTMG,3ch22u,Tvayumat,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:30:48 2015 UTC,Most of the major tie swarms still use backstabber in them.  Unless you go all out on howlrunner defense you have the points.  You will see the tie swarms come back out for nationals and worlds.  There are to many great swarm players that are just trying other stuff to have fun before the real tournaments come.
XWingTMG,3ci3bb,ernesto__-,2,Wed Jul 8 02:07:47 2015 UTC,"A really great resource for these sorts of questions is the list rank page at the List Juggler website. Use the search feature and then sort by total matches. Keep in mind that you have no idea who is playing these lists which is a big factor.   If you search for Dash and Blue, you get this VI Dash build that went 5-1 at a store championship and a guy who ran the squad in your post that went 1-5 against some lists that he should have been favored against.   Honestly, I think you'd be better off running two rookies instead of blues, as Kyle does a lot for you and I'm not sure that you'll be getting that from the upgrade to blues. Or you could run VI Corran as support, which seems to be the most popular way to go."
XWingTMG,3ci3bb,antigrapist,1 point,Wed Jul 8 03:34:04 2015 UTC,"Dash + BB has been my favourite list to run recently. Using a slimmer Dash to get FCS onto the B Wings.  Running:   Dash + Veteran Instincts + Heavy Laser Cannon + Recon Specialist + Outrider Blue + Fire Control System Blue + Fire Control System   Won 3/4 games so far, but your mileage may vary depending on what you're up against.

XWingTMG,3ch1i1,TyrantNZ,3,Tue Jul 7 21:56:24 2015 UTC,"This isn't exactly what you're looking for, but this is my favorite way to solo in X Wing:  Start with 10 tokens randomly scattered on the board.  When you land on a token, you remove it from the board.  See how few moves you can make to pick up all 10.  Don't forget your positional actions (boost/barrel/cloak).  Run it again, but this time fly two of the same ships, and try to keep them in a tight formation as you grab the tokens.  Run it again, add obstacles.  Don't hit them while picking up the tokens.  Run it again, use two different ships.  Etc.  I think of it as flight school.  I usually do some variant on this with new ships when the come out to familiarize myself with the dial.  It helps you get to know the ship and its capabilities while working your distance estimations/spacial relations as much as a real game would (in my opinion).  I prefer this kind of practice to trying to play both sides, or use some kind of ""ai"" decision maker."

XWingTMG,3ch1i1,rsixidor,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:14:10 2015 UTC,"You can play solo even with just the starter set, but it's not great. Solo play is not directly or officially supported by the rules. Some people practice by setting up two squads and choosing the moves for both sides, but that ruins the element of surprise. To get around that, there's a few different ""AI"" systems people have invented.  Here's the one I've used: http://xwing.runbam.com.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/  You can follow the instructions on that site to have it choose maneuvers for your ""opponent"" based on relative ship positions. This brings some of the element of surprise back into the game, but it's really not on the same level as playing a human opponent. The suggested rules on that side try to adjust for this a bit, but it's really not enough in my opinion. Particularly, the AI can't really distinguish between how it should fly a generic low PS pilot versus a high PS pilot with a special ability, or understand how to most effectively use upgrade cards with one-time-use abilities.  You could also try doing some training missions against static targets or targets that move in defined patterns. For example, set up a series of asteroids and see how many rounds it takes you to slalom around them, shoot a target, and get back to where you started."

You can dance around and dictate the pace of the game. It's more maneuverable than almost any other ship, so just keep it on the periphery, enough to distract your opponent and keep him scared. Use cloak and asteroids to your advantage, and if he's going just for the phantom, DON'T use the phantom to joust him, it'll just die. Keep him guessing, and use the rest of your fleet to hammer him up until the phantom can make an appearance later on when he either loses a ship or two, or realises that your other squad was the bigger threat all along. It sounds like you're expecting your phantom to take on an entire squad at once, which he won't. He can't dodge more than a few arcs, and he will take damage when the green dice don't play along. Split him up, keep him scared and keep your phantom alive."

XWingTMG,3chi3g,Shgrizz,1 point,Wed Jul 8 07:26:04 2015 UTC,"The phantom should be relatively easy to keep alive if you use a combination of veteran instincts, advanced cloaking device and decloaking to where he can't have more than one or two arcs on you at range 3. If you can't get a shot off before all his ships, just stay cloaked. Evading and staying alive is more important than taking shots in the early game. The phantom excels when there are only a couple of ships left, when you can really start arc dodging. I'd suggest some YouTube battle reports of people flying phantoms."

Dead phantoms are useless  1bb: He goes after the other ships: Have fun"
XWingTMG,3chi3g,JohnLucCarry91,1 point,Wed Jul 8 03:37:34 2015 UTC,"I've run a Phantom in all my Imperial lists at tournaments except the one where I ran S&V. I always deployed my Phantom facing 90 degrees away from my opponents board edge, about range 2-3 from my other ships, then start with a 1 turn into the board. This should put whatever else is in your squad much further ahead, and therefore in a more threatening position.   If your opponent still goes for Whisper then your supporting ships can slow down to keep the enemy in arc as Whisper de-cloaks and re-cloaks about to arc dodge - PtL and Advanced Sensors mean you can pull a lot of shenanigans that almost keep him on the start line, drawing the enemy out of position and making them easier prey for your back up craft.  I run a souped-up Doomshuttle and an Interceptor with Autothrusters - the Shuttle is a juicy target with 1 Agility, but is less points than my Phantom while being over twice as durable. It also has an HLC and Darth on it, so can kick out some pretty mean firepower. The Interceptor blocks and/or levels at the enemy it's three dice in the most intimidating way possible, so should get some attention. I find the trick with Phantoms is making your opponent think they're too far out to get in range so they ignore them for a turn, and then you remind them that you can Decloak forwards.   What's your Phantom build?"
XWingTMG,3cfgk7,PCGamerPirate,6,Tue Jul 7 14:31:22 2015 UTC,"Horton Salm could be a powerhouse with the upcoming Twin-Linked Turret, with or without BTL-A4, as it's finally a turret that correlates with his ability. With re-rolls on all blanks and multiple attacks, Marksmanship looks to be a solid upgrade, though it costs an extra point requiring you to use R2-D6."
XWingTMG,3cfgk7,rsixidor,4,Tue Jul 7 14:54:25 2015 UTC,"I agree that Horton will be good with the new turret, but I think he wants R2-D6 and Veteran Instincts to move at PS 10, plus an engine upgrade. I don't think you want the title, as you should be able to hit even ships with autothrusters with the TLT."
XWingTMG,3cfgk7,antigrapist,2,Tue Jul 7 15:35:48 2015 UTC,There's a few options to the build for sure.
XWingTMG,3cfgk7,rsixidor,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:42:45 2015 UTC,"Why the ps 10 and EU?. With a range 3 turret he is gonna be able to hit the enemy, if youre trying to make him an arc dodger thats a bit of of a stretch with a Y wing."
XWingTMG,3cfgk7,berusplants,3,Tue Jul 7 17:50:04 2015 UTC,"Because your turret is only R2-3, so if you're PS8 Fel, Whisper, RAC and VI brobots can swoop into R1 and light you up.   The engine upgrade lets you get some value out of your turret and PS10 by letting you slip out of arcs, move out of R1 to get turret shots, and it helps you reposition. You can't really K-turn in a Ywing because of the horrible dial, so being able to 2-turn and boost is really valuable."
XWingTMG,3cfgk7,antigrapist,3,Tue Jul 7 18:01:06 2015 UTC,"The only strong build the Y has right now is the stress-hog:   Gold Squadron Pilot with Ion Cannon Turret, R3-A2, BTL-A4 Title   25 points  It compensates for the Y's lack of firepower with the title to maximize firepower in the front arc and by double stressing ships that rely on actions to stay alive."
XWingTMG,3cfgk7,antigrapist,4,Tue Jul 7 15:34:08 2015 UTC,"Have you tried Gold with ion, title, and R7 also at 25pts?    It's a surprisingly solid build, forcing re-rolls and being a menace on the board.  The first pass is tough without TL, and the red 3 turns make maneuvering tough, but once you stick something with the ions turrets, the tokens keep rolling out, and forcing re-rolls means you can harass turret ships without losing as many ships."
XWingTMG,3cfgk7,T-Minus9,3,Tue Jul 7 16:01:42 2015 UTC,"Where is the Gold going to get the TL's for R7 to force rerolls?  I'll take TL on the initial merge if possible, but thereafter, it's too busy pumping out stress to be able to ever take an action again.   EDIT:  Of course you wouldn't have R3A2 and R7 on the same boat (like antigrapist below, R3-A2 is so much an autoinclude with the title that I don't think about it separately anymore....)"
XWingTMG,3cfgk7,-Earthworm-,3,Tue Jul 7 16:11:17 2015 UTC,"You missed the point there. It doesn't have R3-A2 it has R7 to force re-rolls.  It isn't producing stress, it's being a pain in the ass to kill. 4 of them in a list is a very survivable warthog list that isn't the traditional stress-bot."
XWingTMG,3cfgk7,T-Minus9,1 point,Tue Jul 7 17:04:35 2015 UTC,"If you don't have R3-A2, a warthog just isn't threatening enough to make your opponent shoot it, especially if it's carrying a defensive card like R7. Plus R3-A2 is just too good not to bring if you have an astromech slot."

XWingTMG,3cfgk7,rsixidor,3,Tue Jul 7 19:53:54 2015 UTC,"Do you think the upgrade to TLT is worth the point? Even without the ability to triple stress, I think the ability to double at range 3 is worth it."
XWingTMG,3cfgk7,antigrapist,3,Tue Jul 7 15:41:45 2015 UTC,"No, I think it's a bad idea, at least in the traditional rebel control build. You have to give up a control piece in your squad (going from Blue+ion/tactician to Blue+FCS) and you're losing the control from the ICT to gain a little bit more firepower and control at R3.   I think you're better off focusing on getting a lot of control at R2 and lots of firepower and some control at R1, then to be just decent at all three range bands. Just don't fight at R3 and then it isn't an issue. But even if you're forced to take a unfavorable fight at R3, you won't lose a ship and the one stress almost guarantees a R1 engagement the following turn."
XWingTMG,3cfgk7,rsixidor,2,Tue Jul 7 16:20:57 2015 UTC,"IF it can't triple stress, I definitely think ICT is the right call.  Stress + Ion = Easy Target."
XWingTMG,3cfgk7,AffixBayonets,2,Tue Jul 7 19:52:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's the control cocktail that helps makes the stress Y especially potent compared to a dual Tactician shuttle or other twin stress options."

XWingTMG,3cfgk7,AffixBayonets,4,Tue Jul 7 22:18:20 2015 UTC,"There is occasionally still a place for the non-title ICT Gold Sqn.  I still run one to good effect (alongside a stresshog and a control B-wing).  There are lots of roles for it to fill:   It's a great blocker as it can maneuver however you need it to and still have a shot.  Against AGI 3 targets, ATT 3 is often only going to get a single hit anyway, so you effectively get a r1-2 turret with the ion token as a bonus Arc dodging ships, especially small ones, are still really afraid of turrets, even post-AuT, so they'll pound it early, leaving other ships to do their thing (and it's durable)   Still, it's a niche case that works only in certain squads.

XWingTMG,3cfgk7,Ryddari,3,Tue Jul 7 17:12:39 2015 UTC,"Stat Line  I'm a fan of the Y-Wing's hull and shield values. They're very resilient. Overall though I feel like they paid for their toughness dearly in firepower and a poor dial. Only two damn greens!   Builds  I really like flying Horton Salm with two Proton Torpedoes and R7-T1. If you skirt towards the outside edge of a fight until a ship at 2-3 catches you within their firing arc you can boost into them and put a torpedo in their face. Because of the innate ability of Proton Torpedoes and Horton's talent you can heavily modify the shot. Good for two big hits. Conversely, if you get caught in a dumb situation, nobody suspects the PS8 boosting Y-Wing. Nobody.  Squadrons  I like this squadron:  Horton Salm (Y-Wing)   Proton Torpedoes x2 R7-T1 Munitions Failsafe   Airen Cracken (Z-95 Headhunter)   Swarm Tactics   Rookie Pilot (X-Wing) x2"
XWingTMG,3cfgk7,AffixBayonets,2,Tue Jul 7 19:00:24 2015 UTC,"nobody suspects the PS8 boosting Y-Wing   Accurate!  Do you think you'd run Horton Salm with Proton Torpedoes and Extra Munitions? It's a cheaper deal for the same build, but I've never seen a Torpedo Y deployed in a game. Turrets, bombers, Warthogs, and hybrids of those only."
XWingTMG,3cfgk7,AffixBayonets,1 point,Tue Jul 7 19:43:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah absolutely, Extra Munitions is designed for ships like him who fit into the role of bombers/ordnance carriers.

XWingTMG,3cfgk7,TychoSean,3,Tue Jul 7 20:56:13 2015 UTC,"It's a true shame that the Rebels don't have any Y Wing pilots with EPTs, which is one reason I like Kavil so much. Sure, they can spend one point to trade the Astromech for one, but that drops your astro option!   They're still fun though. The Stressbot BLT Y is second-to-none in its ability to dump stress onto targets at any range and Horten has a bright future as a TLT carrier. With ion cannons they can be pretty decent at controlling enemy ships, though not usually to the degree of the B Wing.   Really, the Y is a very solid platform. Astromech option, quite tough, affordable, and very flexible. The Rebel Y just needs a few more options to be seen widely as they lack some of the flash and dash of the Scum options. They're still useful though and though I don't have much experience with them now I'll gladly report on them more when I run them more. Right now I've found that R2 + Ion on the Gold Squad is a decent option to putter around with in small games."

Being able to pass around target locks to friendly ships up to an astonishing range 2, Dutch can fly a little looser than most support and synergy ships.  While a turret is almost a must, Dutch has a number of droid choices.   R5-K6 can really up the target lock passing. However, the inconsistency leads him to often get stuck on the bench. Coupled with the title, there will be few turns without your entire squad ready to blast something with TL+Focus. R7-T1 with the title helps Dutch get into Range 1 for awesome kill shots while still being to pass out target locks for his wingmen."

XWingTMG,3cfoke,Tvayumat,3,Tue Jul 7 16:42:09 2015 UTC,"I've seen a few pseudo guides here and there using different magnets.  What I did was to mount these magnets: (http://www.kjmagnetics.com/proddetail.asp?prod=R212)  ... on to the clear X wing pegs by lightly trimming the mounting peg down until it could fit into the magnet, then shortening it so it didn't stick out.  Small, fighter sized ships (Up to TIE Bombers and HWK-290s) with 3mm steel ball bearings instead of plastic mounting slots will sit on those magnets and even tilt as if banking/turning if you want.  If you don't want the tilt/bank feature, I'd go with another flat magnet in the model instead.  A good rule of thumb is that 3mm = 1/8"", so a 1/8"" drill bit will make a hole for a 3mm magnet or bearing no problem.  Also, if you DO magnetize an HWK to tilt, make sure you check the balance, I had to put the bearing further back on the hull than the original mounting point.  EDIT: You could also get away with using http://www.kjmagnetics.com/proddetail.asp?prod=R313 for the magnet, since it has 60% more pull strength but isn't much larger."

XWingTMG,3cgf2d,exonwarrior,6,Tue Jul 7 18:36:02 2015 UTC,"The English version says ""suffers one damage"" So I think this is a problem with the translation.  It does not ignore shields.

XWingTMG,3cgf2d,scuff,2,Tue Jul 7 18:39:45 2015 UTC,"Yup.  It's essentially the same wording as the ion cannon, except with stress tokens instead of ion tokens."

XWingTMG,3cgf2d,Rambr,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:27:10 2015 UTC,"Thanks everybody for your input.  It would appear the translation is incorrect, this is the Polish version.  karta uszkodzeń = damage card.  I see from the English version that is says ""suffers one damage""."
XWingTMG,3cfnu4,3rd_Charmer,9,Tue Jul 7 15:27:17 2015 UTC,"I think the real issue isn't that X Wings are bad, B Wings are just...better. Astromechs are a pretty iconic part of the X Wing, and it is something that would help set it apart from the B Wing. It would have to be a two part fix though, just making astromechs cheaper for the X Wing probably wouldn't be enough because there aren't a lot of great astromechs out there. They need to add some astromechs that are a little more worthwhile.  A stronger roster of astromechs could be a good boost for the generic E Wings too."
XWingTMG,3cfnu4,MysteriousRacer_X,2,Tue Jul 7 15:57:58 2015 UTC,"The problem with a good upgrade is the unintended consequences and how they react with other ships with astromech slots (excepting placing restrictions explicitly on the card, which would make much sense fluff wise). I don't envy the game designer's job. They have done a much better job so far than I could ever do. I have faith that they'll come up with something that works well."
XWingTMG,3cfnu4,soaring_bear,3,Tue Jul 7 19:21:12 2015 UTC,"Well, any astromech is only going to effect the X Wing, Y Wing, and E Wing. The only top tier builds with the E Wing or the Y Wing already involve an astromech (R2-D2 for Corran, R3-A2 for the stress-hog) so there won't be any ripple effects there. The rest of the E Wings and Y Wings don't see a lot of competitive play, so a stronger stable of astromechs can actually solve issues on several ships at once."
XWingTMG,3cfnu4,MysteriousRacer_X,2,Tue Jul 7 19:37:12 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's fair to say that new Astros won't affect top tier E & Y wings - you can't know without seeing them. I doubt it'd eclipse the builds entirely, potentially not at all, but we can't say without seeing the cards.   The issue for the X-Wing is what it's used for - a workhorse jouster - and the B-Wing does it better. Even with an R2 Astro, the mobility of the X-Wing is not much increased - it doesn't really stress that often without other effects.   Perhaps a generic Astro that allows it to barrell roll? This would give it more maneouvre options. Arguably people might ask why not just take a generic E wing then, however, so it'd have to be (3) points ish. Would also assist Y-Wings, as they could arc dodge to some degree without EU.   My background is an S&V - Imperial player, so I'm mainly looking at it from an opposition point of view. The X-Wing is somewhat lumbering but still an effective mid-ship. The 2 Agility makes it a tougher prospect than B-Wings to land hits on effectively, especially at 3. I know Rebels celebrate B's as the pinnacle of heavy fighters, and they are, but I find they're easy to pick apart due to Agility 1. Obviously, personal experience - maybe I play well vs B's, or maybe they've always been played badly against me.  EDIT: Apologies long post."
XWingTMG,3cfnu4,Nomnomnicon,1 point,Wed Jul 8 11:07:23 2015 UTC,"It's true that we couldn't say what the impact would be for sure without seeing any new cards. But those builds I mentioned specifically wouldn't be affected because the astromech slot is already used. There might be a new Corran build that takes over the Meta, but the current one we se wouldn't be affected.  The extra shields on the B are way more important than the extra agility die. To make it simple, an agility die is worth 3/8ths of a shield / hull. Those 3 extra shield are worth 8 extra dice rolls. With focus, it changes to 4.8 extra rolls.  Maneuvering could be an option, but I'd say boost over barrel roll. B wings already have barrel roll, and would still trump X wings. And I don't think barrel rolling Y wings work thematically.  I think the option needs to offer some sort of slight offensive bonus. Maybe something like ""at the begetting of the combat phase, you may perform a free target lock action on an enemy ship inside your firing arc. Gives a slight edge over FCS on the B wing, especially on generics since you won't miss out on TL due to movement order.   edit: words"
XWingTMG,3cfnu4,MysteriousRacer_X,1 point,Wed Jul 8 12:15:42 2015 UTC,"The current Corran build would still be available, for sure. But if R4-B8 (Regain a shield whenever you perform a boost action) comes out, you can then shove that on Corran and R2D2 on Biggs. Won't change the 2-ship Corran build but would make him run differently in Squadrons. If that squadron than became more effective than 2-ship Corran, it would become 'the' Corran build - in the same way you talk about 'the current' Corran build.  Arguing stats where dice rolls are concerned is always, ah-ha, dicey. You get the dice each time, you get the shield once. I fly Decimators and whenever I get to roll two dice I feel a lot safer than rolling one.  I almost put boost - but I thought it's not as useful on a weapon platform. That might just be my opinion, but either would be good. The boost is available though as a mod already, so having a Astro do it as well would mean they could add Autothrusters too - a bit good, perhaps? I don't think the X is that mobile. Boosting Y-Wings is already a thing, and I love EU on my S&V ones. Perhaps you're right, and make it boost for (3) points.  A free target lock would make them far more efficient. So much so that it would make 50% of their action bar almost redundant. I can see it working, and also competing with FCS Blues. Would need to be pricey points wise though I feel.  Edit: R4-B8 is a fictional droid. Any likeness to droids real or fictional is purely accidental."
XWingTMG,3cfnu4,Nomnomnicon,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:14:19 2015 UTC,perhaps xwing-only astromechs would keep things separate...I'd hate to see some great new mechs drop that make the existing ones next to useless.
XWingTMG,3cfnu4,hotdogSamurai,2,Tue Jul 7 21:56:15 2015 UTC,I don't think there is much chance that any new astromechs will edge out the old ones since the old ones are already sitting on the sidelines.
XWingTMG,3cfnu4,MysteriousRacer_X,0,Tue Jul 7 22:03:35 2015 UTC,"Nah, the X Wing is just plain overcosted. It still would be even if there was no B Wing."

Allow for a free reroll on any primary weapon attack or add a die at range 2-3. Or something else that makes the X-wing more dangerous at a distance. Off the top of my head I can't think of many small ships that actually benefit from distance, and theme-wise it fits with all the firepower at its disposal. I only worry what a beast that might Wedge. Better learn to dodge, I suppose."

XWingTMG,3cfnu4,MaximusNerdius,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:47:35 2015 UTC,"I kinda like having some range 3 incentive. Gives them an extra green from the enemy and boggles the maths a bit. I keep thinking of a variation on the Corellian Slip, where a friendly craft comes and shoots an enemy off your tail. X-wings might not shake you so well, but they got a friend to vape you instead. But I'm a dreamer."
XWingTMG,3cfnu4,doodeman,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:54:34 2015 UTC,"I was thinking some titles might be a nice combo there, which people have thought up before: something for the lower-PS pilots that builds off synergy - like a bonus for attacking a target that has already been attacked - and a unique title that can be equipped to at a high-PS pilot - maybe allowing them a reroll for every friendly pilot in range 1 of the same ship type.  Something like Red/Gold/Rogue Squadron, and then Red/Gold/Rogue Leader."
XWingTMG,3cfnu4,doodeman,3,Tue Jul 7 19:01:08 2015 UTC,This seems like the easiest fix.  An X wing only mod or title that costs 2-3 points and increases the base attack value of the ship by 1 so it has 4 base dice (like the phantom).  The damned model has 4 cannons on it for god sake...
XWingTMG,3cfnu4,ThatFacelessMan,5,Tue Jul 7 20:06:23 2015 UTC,I'm not convinced the X-Wing needs much help. Maybe a title that reduces the cost of astromechs by X points.
XWingTMG,3cfnu4,Nomnomnicon,5,Tue Jul 7 15:38:21 2015 UTC,"After seeing only 2 lists out of 20+ that actually sported X-Wings at our local regional, I think they need something to stand out a little.  People just aren't excited to use X-Wings anymore.  I think MysteriousRacer_X says it best:   I think the real issue isn't that X Wings are bad, B Wings are just...better.   Beyond an assortment of okay astromechs, they just don't bring anything unique to the table: they're not bad so much as lacklustre.  Why play them when such better options are available?"
XWingTMG,3cfnu4,PCGamerPirate,5,Tue Jul 7 16:36:00 2015 UTC,"The problem is not that Xs are bad, the problem is that Bs are undercosted, and serve (mostly) the same role as the cheap Xs do.   Named Xs like Wedge, Biggs, and Luke all see plenty of play, because their abilities differentiate them. But Rookies and Reds are simply outclassed by Blues.   Blues can't set the standard, because they're too good - Buffing Xs to compete with Blues would start an avalanche of power creep."
XWingTMG,3cfnu4,doodeman,8,Tue Jul 7 16:39:47 2015 UTC,"I think power creep is inevitable with FFG fixes, but I agree with you on the unique pilots vs. generics.  The problem with the named X-wing pilots like Wedge, Biggs and Luke, though, is also their age.  They've been around from the start of the game: people know how to deal with them.  The strategies with dealing them have not changed much - arc dodge/focus fire on the named pilots, arc dodge on the generics - and X-Wings have never really developed a flexible response to their greatest weaknesses.  I mean, we have the Kihraxz coming up, the Scum answer to the X-Wing.  Almost identical stats, an arguably superior dial then the X-Wing, has the very practical missile slot and amazing Illicit slot, and has a 5-PS generic with an EPT for only 23 points.  Now that is a generic pilot worth flying."
XWingTMG,3cfnu4,Mirkon,3,Tue Jul 7 17:00:11 2015 UTC,I'm holding out hope for a Rebel Aces II that has some sort of generic Rogue Squadron pilot and maybe a title card. It seems like the logical place to make an improvement to the ship the game is named after.   Maybe an astromech that does power management. Like take a stress and -1 to move distance to add a shield or an attack dice or vice versa
XWingTMG,3cfnu4,rottinguy,2,Tue Jul 7 18:35:45 2015 UTC,"I'm expecting the same, something to add fresh pilots for Y-Wings, X-Wings, E-Wings and maybe even HWKs, but who knows what it will include.  I'm sure they'll be doing one for Imperial Aces as well."
XWingTMG,3cfnu4,clawclawbite,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:51:29 2015 UTC,"'Lacklustre' is a good word. I don't think they're actually bad, but somewhat lacking in shazam."
XWingTMG,3cfnu4,clawclawbite,3,Wed Jul 8 11:12:51 2015 UTC,Better astromechs in general can help X- Y- and E-Wings plenty. Put them on par with some of the better crews and systems and you can bring a bunch of ships out of the underused tier.  I do think the X-Wing fix will be closer to the Tie Advanced title rather than the Chardaan Refit or BTL-A4 title and give discounted upgrades rather than discounted ship or new abilities.
XWingTMG,3cfnu4,starslinger72,3,Tue Jul 7 17:21:08 2015 UTC,"Well, the E-Wing is used plenty - Or rather, Corran Horn is used plenty. I don't think I've ever seen anyone field an E that isn't Corran.   As for astromechs, I agree. I'm pretty baffled that they decided to split Rebel and Scum astromechs. If Rebels had Unstable Astromech and Agromech we wouldn't even be having this discussion.   Then again, X-Wings with Unstable Astromech would be obscene."

One of the greatest things about this games is that (for a miniatures game) it isn't very complicated and moves right along as a result.

XWingTMG,3cfnu4,Telemako,1 point,Tue Jul 7 23:03:22 2015 UTC,Agreed.  Only the rookie is having issues right now as a blue is just a better buy for 1 point more most of the time.  Any buff cant help ships like biggs and wedge that still see plenty of play.
XWingTMG,3cfnu4,Dakkon_B,3,Tue Jul 7 16:25:31 2015 UTC,I think the problem is that the Blue (and Bs in general) is just underpriced. Buffing the X to compete would just start an avalanche of power creep.
XWingTMG,3cfnu4,Telemako,5,Tue Jul 7 16:36:09 2015 UTC,"It really isnt.  The big issue we are dealing with is there are still a lot of big guns out there.  4 red dice attacks dont really care about 2 agi vs 1 and so the Blues 8 HP is the better bet.  When you are dealing with more attacks at lower numbers, such as swarms of 2 red dice, the added agi of the rookie comes through.  With two ship lists being as popular as they are right now you have a low number of big attacks going around.  The blue is going to survive that for 1 turn while the rookie might not."
XWingTMG,3cfnu4,Dakkon_B,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:38:21 2015 UTC,"Well put - the meta for lower ship builds makes B-Wings a better choice. I am wary of power creep, as it means whenever we, the community, moan about something enough we will expect it to get a buff. However, not all pilots are going to see competitive play. If swarms were the total meta, the Decimator wouldn't see as much play as it does."
XWingTMG,3cfnu4,Shgrizz,2,Wed Jul 8 13:05:28 2015 UTC,"One thing x-wings could benefit from is a card with a negative point cost card  like the a-wings have, or a title card like the tie advanced is getting to give a negaitve cost to the astromech upgrades. How ever I don't think we will see any x-wing updates until the new movie is released so they can include the card with either an updated x-wing model, rebel aces 2 or possibly an episode 7 ""starter"" pack with an updated rule book to reflect all the rule changes and updates and updated tie and x-wing models/cards"
XWingTMG,3cfnu4,Nomnomnicon,2,Tue Jul 7 21:30:52 2015 UTC,"Rogue Squadron titles  You can only equip Rogue Squadron titles if your squad is only composed of x-wings. You are forced to pick the titles in ascending order.  Rogue Leader  Rogue Leader may equip two Elite Pilot Talents.  Rogue two  When this ship target locks an enemy ship, all the rogue pilots at range 1 may get a free target lock on the same ship.  Rogue three  When any rogue squadron pilot at range 1 is going to receive a stress token, this pilot may receive it instead, even if he already has an stress token.  Rogue four  While all the other rogue pilots are alive, this pilot can not lose his last hull point.  Edit: only usable by pilots with pilot skill 8 or higher before applying ""Rogue five"" title.  Rogue five  All the rogue pilots get their pilot skill changed to 6.  Explanation  My idea here is to buff the xwing when flown as a swarm. I buff some pilots and others get a swarm skill so the player is forced to fly in formation. The fifth title is only available if you fly 5 xwings, which will sacrifice upgrades. If you get Wedge, Luke and 3 academies you actually lower Wedge and Luke pilot skill, so it has downsides."
XWingTMG,3cfnu4,Dakkon_B,2,Tue Jul 7 20:51:57 2015 UTC,"Nice idea thematically, but I'm not sure about the actual rules. Most notably, rogue two would be the single most overpowered card in the game, and five is nuts also. You're essentially giving everything a free TL+ focus attack at ps6."
XWingTMG,3cfnu4,Nomnomnicon,1 point,Wed Jul 8 01:08:00 2015 UTC,I thought Rogue 4 was the most broken due to imagine that on Biggs.
XWingTMG,3cfnu4,Dakkon_B,1 point,Wed Jul 8 04:30:50 2015 UTC,"Yes, that's the strongest combo. It will force you to joust at range 3 to be able to hit anybody else (when you manage to get Biggs out of range). Anyway, we could reword it to: only usable by pilots with pilot skill 8 or higher before using ""Rogue five"" title."
XWingTMG,3cfnu4,Nomnomnicon,1 point,Wed Jul 8 09:52:00 2015 UTC,"It's to strong. There is a real possibility that you would simply be unable to get the perfect angle where your in range of your target but not Biggs. Meaning you effectively negated a complete round of shots. Not to mention even one round of ""you can't kill anything but he can shoot back for free"" would tip the game so far in the x-wing squads favor that nothing else could possibly could win. An that is a game breaking level of bad design.   Any game that has a strategy that doesn't allow the player to fight back quickly becomes hated by the player base. It would be different if it said increased green dice of the squad or even the ship for each other member in the squad (up to X value) but completely negating damage is (and I can not stress enough) a TERRIBLE idea."
XWingTMG,3cfnu4,Telemako,1 point,Wed Jul 8 11:01:38 2015 UTC,"My idea was to force the enemy to joust and to break the swarm. I didn't want a fat turret running in circles, I want to force it to crash into the swarm to break it.  Anyway, I fixed it, no longer usable on Biggs. What do you think about it now?"
XWingTMG,3cfnu4,Shgrizz,1 point,Wed Jul 8 12:11:06 2015 UTC,"O I got what you were trying to do (forcing an opponent to joust or block) and I like the idea. Its just anything that says ""All my things are immune to damage"" usually doesn't end well. Specifically when your opponent isn't going to make it easy for you. If he can guess that your trying to block him he would be smart to just have them all 4 straight to run past then take his time turning around. I mean whats it matter to him his guys can't die so there is no need to ever take risks to get a shot in or dodge.  With the fix... Hmm I would put a range limit on it. I mean if there is anyway to abuse it ""that guy"" will. I could easily see someone being lame sending in the ""Immune"" X-wing while keeping the others at safe distances while the Immune one chewed down your ships while you tried chasing the others down.  To be honest I would just get rid of 4. It just creates to many problems. If your worried about something like a Han or RAC just make it everyone gets Autothrusters effectively. (tho its still 2 green vs 3 red)   You need 4 to do something that makes them want to force a joust/block but still give them the option to be able to fight back. Think about Howlrunner. It makes you want to break up the swarm but you can just ignore it and pick them apart one at a time if you think you can deal with the # of attacks.  Honestly my option on an X-wing fix needs to be something simple. Just 1 Title card. Something like all pilots with this title share their Elite Upgrades."
XWingTMG,3cfnu4,Telemako,1 point,Wed Jul 8 12:43:58 2015 UTC,"The whole 'cannot die' thing is just not fun in my situation. Modifying dice to make it more difficult to die is ok - the ability to reroll a defense die if you're one 1 hull point, for example, would be fun and engaging. There's nothing fun about something being abstractly unkillable for some reason."
XWingTMG,3cfnu4,Shgrizz,1 point,Wed Jul 8 13:15:31 2015 UTC,"His rule reads, 'All' so I think if you'd lost a single other X-Wing it would be null and void.  Possibly make them non-named Pilot Titles only?"
XWingTMG,3cfnu4,KorlithZaan,1 point,Wed Jul 8 11:11:47 2015 UTC,Problem is Biggs would absorb all the damage so you wouldn't lose any other X-wing. Once Biggs hit 1 Hull all the rest of the damage would just be negated.  Imagine a game of X-wing where you are not allow to roll Red dice. You can maneuver but you can not shoot back unless you get your opponents ships out of range 1 of each other. An even if you do manage to block them to break them up if they regroup you are not allow to shoot again.
XWingTMG,3cfnu4,Flermy,1 point,Wed Jul 8 11:24:14 2015 UTC,"If he keeps Biggs at range 1. A good player could manage it, you're right. It wouldn't be easy. Hence the suggestion for the titles to be non-named Pilot Titles."
XWingTMG,3cfnu4,podsyboy121,1 point,Wed Jul 8 13:52:23 2015 UTC,Gotcha gotcha. But then you might as well just print them as new pilot cards for the X-wing. Since they would only go on a rookie or red pilot meaning you paying X point cost more to basically give them a unique pilot effect.
XWingTMG,3cfnu4,Flermy,1 point,Wed Jul 8 15:14:42 2015 UTC,"A fair point! I came up with a complicated system for mixing the two ideas, but for simplicity Pilot cards is far easier."

Look at the kihraxz that's coming out, it's almost identical in its stats and movement dial, and the basic model is just one point cheaper, and they look set to be a great unit to play. Give x wings a buff of the size you're looking at and they'd just steamroll anything. I like the idea of a rogue squadron buff, but it doesn't have to be anything major."
XWingTMG,3cfnu4,Jimbobjeff,1 point,Wed Jul 8 13:20:47 2015 UTC,"I partially agree, that's why I made an ""x-wing only"" squad buff. But the lack of winning lists with x-wings in a game called x-wing is kinda sad."
XWingTMG,3cfnu4,Durog25,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:39:10 2015 UTC,"What can you do. The tournament meta is narrow right now, but with more upgrades and items, more ships find viable builds. I play against a triple x list casually a fair bit, and it has no problem handing my ass to me. Don't base your opinion of which ships are viable on what people in high level tournament play are doing."
XWingTMG,3cfnu4,JohnLucCarry91,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:57:10 2015 UTC,Wedge and Biggs are all right and don't need adjustment.  Un-named are overcosted. No idea on the other aces.  Another issue is that jousting isn't very meta right now. It's dominated by arc dogers or turrets. 4B is sort of jousty but can degenerate into a dogfight.
XWingTMG,3cfnu4,jcd856,1 point,Tue Jul 7 17:23:41 2015 UTC,"We really just need a title, that may not necessarily do all the aforementioned things, but one or two of them. The named pilot abilities are generally fine on their own and for some, like Biggs, make them playable. The issue then is that these abilities are attached to a ship that feels like a jouster without the actual stat efficiency. I don't think that a power diversion system that complex can work out, but a chardaan refit type upgrade, or a title/mod that can change the stat line or pull an X1 and give a ""free"" upgrade is what would put these back on the map, either as iconic gunships or maintaining their ace status."
XWingTMG,3cfnu4,gamerfathergeek,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:11:57 2015 UTC,"The best idea i've seen floating around to fix the X wing is a title of sorts that only lets you field X wings, but reduces each of their costs by some # of points.  As it is, you can run 4 X generic wings if they are basically bare or you can run 3 that have some upgrades, but if you had room to build 3 beefier X wings I think it could be pretty competitive"
XWingTMG,3cfnu4,Rambr,3,Tue Jul 7 18:32:04 2015 UTC,"That'd be really cool!  Another though might be if there is a Rebel Aces II pack, it'd likely have two ships in it, like maybe an X and an E.  In that case, the title could be something like ""if you have at least two x-wings in your fleet, reduce the fleet cost of each ship by 2."""

Fel - PTL, TC  Vessery - HLC VI  Doomshuttle  It has changed a bit over time as stuff has been released.  Pushed VI to decoy on Vessery to let him swap PS with fel to use his target lock for a while.  After auto dropped and the Fel + Rac meta hit I switched to   Fel - PTL, Autothursters, Targeting comp.  Vessery - Mangler  Yorr - Vader.  Needed the stress ability of Yorr to deal with the new waves of control lists out there and PS 10 rebel captives.  He also lets you do some fun stuff with vessery with 1 or 2 turning or moving through debris fields and still getting actions.    Recently there was a top 4 regionals finisher with a double defender list.  Rex - Predator, HLC, Hull, Ion pulse missile  Vessery - Lone wolf, HLC, Stealth Device.    Its a solid jousting lists that murders ships each turn.  Vessery is hard to hit with 4 dice + focus and reroll.  Rex tanks well with 7 HP.  Im also a big fan of Rex with predator and 2 deltas.

XWingTMG,3cfszz,starslinger72,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:47:39 2015 UTC,"The thing about Defenders is that they are not well suited to the current meta.  If the meta ever shifts back towards swarms of two attack ships, the Defender can really shine.  That being said, you can definitely kit out Defenders to withstand the current meta.  Heavy bruiser lists like Jonus Brothers can pummel large turret ships really quickly and force the arc dodging wingman to take a more offensive role.  Vessery is the most accurate gun in the game if you can get targets painted (put him on squads with someone of higher and lower PS).  I won a store championship (before Wave VI) with a Rexlar and RAC combo.  All of my defender centric lists bat about .500 in vassal tournaments here and on team covenant. (Triple Defenders, Vessery and Prox Bombers, RAC and increasing numbers of Defenders for escalation, and just add defenders for escalation each have .500 records)"

XWingTMG,3cfszz,quarrel,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:11:31 2015 UTC,I love the Tie Defender. It literally is the reason I got into X-wing.   My first and still my go to list for the Defender in tournaments is this  I basically space out the three ships and force hard flanks. Which ever way they turn I have that ship focus on evading while the other two ships hammer home free shots.   It punches really hard with consistent damage output. It's not fancy but what it does it does rather well.   With the upcoming Advanced Raider update I was thinking of changing it to this. I did a playtest with this and I think I just didn't know how to fly it yet properly but it still hit very hard. I just wasn't sure how I wanted to place for starting positions or how much I wanted to force a range 1 exchanges. It did ok vs Scum Katt/IG and crushed a Double IG next round.

XWingTMG,3ceqfh,fl1p_problems,3,Tue Jul 7 09:49:17 2015 UTC,"In my opinion, Firesprays with Tacticians are your best bet, because it works in the rear arc as well. Additionally, they can apply double stress by using Kath Scarlet or Flechette Cannon. Alternatively, you can go for Kath Scarlett with Gunner, Exp. Interface and Marksmanship.  Rebel Captive works well too, if you put it on a high priority target like a Decimator.   I dislike Mara Jade a lot, because she triggers only at the end of the combat phase. This has really awkward antisynergy with other stress cards and might even be completely useless (e.g. if your opponent has Push the Limit).  I like these two lists:  Kath + Kenkirk; Alternatively, you can ditch the Engine Upgrade and use RAC instead of Kenkirk.  Boba + Kath Alternatively, you could strip some upgrades and use a Bounty Hunter instead of Boba to make room for a Backstabber or Dark Curse, but I like the idea of having higher PS than Soontir Fel in a stress list.

I like where that is going :)"
XWingTMG,3ceqfh,Stetto,1 point,Tue Jul 7 11:06:23 2015 UTC,"Fixed the Link.   I like Opportunist instead of Expose, because you can still take a focus or target lock action. Otherwise, Predator would be superior to Expose, because you could still combine it with a focus or boost action, unlike Expose.  Expose equals 2 expected damage, whereas Predator + Focus ends up at ~2.68 expected damagesource . Even without Focus, Predator will deal ~1,79 expected damage, which is close enough for enabling you to take a different action."
XWingTMG,3ceqfh,Stetto,2,Tue Jul 7 12:59:29 2015 UTC,"Kath+Boba: Ah, very nice. I'd maybe switch the Shield upgrades for Engine upgrades, for better Range 2 positioning.

XWingTMG,3ceqfh,Stetto,2,Tue Jul 7 17:19:29 2015 UTC,"In case, you're interested:  I played the list a lot in the past week and I settled on this one: Kath + Boba  The list was lacking damage, so I decided to field a HLC. Flechette Cannon was used mostly at range 3 and usually failed to apply a stress anyway. Additionally, a little bit more speed and maneuverability on Boba has proven to be worth the loss in action economy. I'd like to use Push the Limit, but I'm afraid of arc dodgers and don't like Firespray's green maneuvers."

XWingTMG,3cb9rj,cheevocabra,3,Mon Jul 6 16:06:31 2015 UTC,Putting one on a TIE Bomber wouldn't be the worst idea either as you gain green 1 and 3 banks.
XWingTMG,3cb9rj,AffixBayonets,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:59:00 2015 UTC,"Right, I forgot about the bomber haha. The Punisher too of course."
XWingTMG,3cb9rj,cheevocabra,2,Mon Jul 6 17:06:02 2015 UTC,Everybody forgets about the bomber.  They won't forget now!  Muhahahaha
XWingTMG,3cb9rj,ivycoopwren,3,Tue Jul 7 19:47:25 2015 UTC,"Well those two ties are very under utilized, it would be good to seem them competing again."
XWingTMG,3cb9rj,beer_demon,2,Mon Jul 6 17:06:39 2015 UTC,"Well, TIE Advanced is only underutilized because the raider isn't out yet.  Soon as that releases it'll pick up."
XWingTMG,3cb9rj,VanderLegion,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:12:06 2015 UTC,Hope so.
XWingTMG,3cb9rj,beer_demon,2,Mon Jul 6 17:13:02 2015 UTC,"Guaranteed. Advanced Targeting Computer and TIE/x1 title.  Gives it what is essentially +1 red dice for +1 point. (This isn't completely accurate, but it's close)."
XWingTMG,3cb9rj,beer_demon,1 point,Tue Jul 7 10:13:00 2015 UTC,Actually it's a guaranteed crit if you have a TL although it disables your TL otherwise. Add opportunist and vader/push the limit and you can roll 4 dice + a crit at range 1 with a focus :-)  Deadly.
XWingTMG,3cb9rj,MrGraveRisen,1 point,Tue Jul 7 10:35:42 2015 UTC,"You're right, but when modelling it, I assumed there will be a TL about half of the time, and crits are just regular hits on shields. You can of course improve this with Vader or any of the numerous ways to gain or hand out TLs."
XWingTMG,3cb9rj,VanderLegion,1 point,Tue Jul 7 10:48:25 2015 UTC,I'll be running 4

XWingTMG,3cb9rj,rottinguy,2,Tue Jul 7 08:22:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah, they're obviously trying to get the Advanced over hard, but I'm excited to see how viable the Defender ends up being with this bump because I love that ship."

XWingTMG,3cb9rj,Lyianx,1 point,Tue Jul 7 00:41:14 2015 UTC,3 bank left and 3 bank right is what I imagine /u/Rydiak means.
XWingTMG,3cb9rj,Enervata,3,Tue Jul 7 02:47:47 2015 UTC,The fact that the art depicts a Tie Defender makes me so happy.
XWingTMG,3cb9rj,mxzf,2,Mon Jul 6 20:17:24 2015 UTC,Cause Tie Defenders are badass!
XWingTMG,3cb9rj,Enervata,2,Tue Jul 7 03:47:34 2015 UTC,"Oh, I'm surprised it's only (green) banks and not the hard turns (being white instead).  EDIT: I didn't properly capture all my thoughts, sorry."
XWingTMG,3cb9rj,mxzf,8,Mon Jul 6 15:53:44 2015 UTC,"Imagine a Defender being able to turn all its red hard turns to greens.  That'd be broken, since the Defender would never take stress from maneuvers."
XWingTMG,3cb9rj,PCGamerPirate,2,Mon Jul 6 16:04:31 2015 UTC,"Sorry, Clarification: ""I'm surprised it's green banks, and not white hard turns."""
XWingTMG,3cb9rj,mxzf,5,Mon Jul 6 16:51:49 2015 UTC,"Ah, that's more sensible.    The issue is that if it was white hard turns, only the Defender, Punisher, and Bomber would get any use out of it.  They all have red hard turns at 1/2 range but no other TIEs have any red hard turns.  This way it's somewhat useful on any TIE."
XWingTMG,3cb9rj,Enervata,2,Mon Jul 6 16:56:08 2015 UTC,"I'd understand white turns if the mod were 0 points. Having the TIE only restriction would then be future proofing for some other sluggish TIE.  1 point has to give you some greens (R2 Astromech, Unhinged Astromech, Nien Numb)"
XWingTMG,3cb9rj,PCGamerPirate,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:08:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I agree, which is why I think it works out great as it is."
XWingTMG,3cb9rj,Screaming_Beavers,2,Mon Jul 6 17:10:16 2015 UTC,I agree.  I like it.  Surprised how well it'll probably work and how well they designed it.
XWingTMG,3cb9rj,sacimino40,3,Mon Jul 6 17:47:18 2015 UTC,Green hard 1's would be too much.
XWingTMG,3cb9rj,AffixBayonets,4,Mon Jul 6 15:56:21 2015 UTC,If it was hard turns it could be the second mod on Fel and make him be able to 1 Green turn. Which I think might be a little too strong.
XWingTMG,3cb9rj,starslinger72,5,Mon Jul 6 15:56:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think they really want to reserve green hard turns only for the absolutely most maneuverable ships (Interceptors, A-Wings, etc.).  Also, if it made hard turns green, then TIE Defenders would have no red maneuvers, which would make them absurdly good."
XWingTMG,3cb9rj,howieloader,4,Mon Jul 6 16:00:42 2015 UTC,Not to mention Juno with Green hard turns...every maneuver green except 5 straight...I think that would be OP
XWingTMG,3cb9rj,PCGamerPirate,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:01:09 2015 UTC,How are you planning to use your Defenders with these? I think this guy has a good idea there.
XWingTMG,3cb9rj,howieloader,-1,Mon Jul 6 17:01:44 2015 UTC,Ptl is a waste on a defender. Always has been and this doesn't change it.
XWingTMG,3cb9rj,PCGamerPirate,2,Mon Jul 6 17:38:38 2015 UTC,It always has been because it was a bitch to clear stress... That's not the case anymore...
XWingTMG,3cb9rj,howieloader,2,Mon Jul 6 20:45:53 2015 UTC,"The problem is you still don't have the actions to really benefit from PtL in addition to the stress.  If Defenders had evade and/or boost on their action bar, PtL would be a more useful EPT. Without either, you can get a lot of the same effect with Lone Wolf or Predator."
XWingTMG,3cb9rj,starslinger72,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:54:39 2015 UTC,I'm going to not dismiss it immediately until I've tried it in application a few times... Rexler is the only one that could benefit from this really... The ability to give him a TL/Focus with a HLC is > a Focus/Single-Reroll every time...
XWingTMG,3cb9rj,AffixBayonets,2,Tue Jul 7 00:00:08 2015 UTC,"A TL is usually better than a single reroll, yes.  But I think the ability to rock back to back K turns and still get a focus is worth having only one reroll (or 2 if facing low PS) rather than get an epic shot and then have to run away to keep actions up."
XWingTMG,3cb9rj,starslinger72,1 point,Tue Jul 7 00:16:03 2015 UTC,"A 2 bank to clear stress isn't exactly ""running away""... I fly Vessery regularly, I particularly enjoy the 3x K-Turn, for lulz... I just think the potential with Rexler, TIE Engine, HLC, and PTL might make him legitimately the hardest hitting pilot in the game now..."
XWingTMG,3cb9rj,AffixBayonets,-1,Tue Jul 7 04:01:37 2015 UTC,pretty much this.
XWingTMG,3cb9rj,Dignitude,1 point,Mon Jul 6 21:51:16 2015 UTC,"Usually, but I'd try it on Brath in a casual game. It could help him actually get decent hits with a TL so he can use his focus on his ability.   But I'm sure you'll suggest Predator Brath instead."
XWingTMG,3cb9rj,AffixBayonets,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:48:35 2015 UTC,Predator is decent but I prefer lone wolf.  Defenders need a good way to keep their green dice working and if you get to proc his passive its just a bonus.
XWingTMG,3cb9rj,starslinger72,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:14:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah, LW is great on them, but can you think of other ways to take advantage of giving it better stress clearing ability with TIEMK2? Or would you just use red turns more often?"
XWingTMG,3cb9rj,podsyboy121,1 point,Mon Jul 6 21:00:21 2015 UTC,"I look it more as a way to not get completely hosed by debris and stress giving effects like rebel captive, tactician, r3-a2, etc"
XWingTMG,3cb9rj,starslinger72,1 point,Mon Jul 6 21:30:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Rebel Captive is rough. It shuts my Defender and Phantom game down pretty effectively. This should change things."
XWingTMG,3cb9rj,Zombane,-1,Mon Jul 6 21:55:14 2015 UTC,the only stress you really ever need to clear is from rebel captive.  As long as you can deal with that then you should be good.
XWingTMG,3cb9rj,starslinger72,1 point,Mon Jul 6 21:50:46 2015 UTC,"What about elusiveness, now that it's easier to clear stress?  Defenders are really shooty, but die super quick.  This could help out some."
XWingTMG,3cb9rj,Zombane,-1,Mon Jul 6 21:09:36 2015 UTC,I generally don't like it as an EPT but I agree that getting a way to keep them alive is the biggest hurdle.
XWingTMG,3cb9rj,starslinger72,1 point,Mon Jul 6 21:52:07 2015 UTC,"Might not be the opinion expressed by most on here, but I like it on Soontir Fel over a stealth device. Having the 3 bank be green gives him more unpredictability and more options. I'll play test it of course."
XWingTMG,3cb9rj,rsixidor,3,Mon Jul 6 17:09:15 2015 UTC,Targeting comp is already a better upgrade than both.
XWingTMG,3cb9rj,starslinger72,2,Mon Jul 6 17:39:07 2015 UTC,"You're entitled to your opinion, but I'd rather hear your reasons than just a statement. I like the mk2 because it makes him less predictable and helps him escape being trapped."
XWingTMG,3cb9rj,Zombane,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:40:32 2015 UTC,It highly increases your damage output and if you fly well you don't need either mk2 or stealth to keep you alive.  Also gives you an extra action if you only need one to reposition.
XWingTMG,3cb9rj,Wolfgang52,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:47:05 2015 UTC,"Before Autothrusters, I think most would agree with you.  After Autothrusters, definitely not.  13 Regionals Winners disagree with you  And 2 others ran shield or hull.  None of them ran TC.  Although, some top 4 / top 8 builds did run TC."
XWingTMG,3cb9rj,Lyianx,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:05:28 2015 UTC,Shield is a solid choice if you can't play against a Vader deci but deci + stealth Fel is already falling off.  I don't see it finishing well at nationals or the later regionals that are going on.
XWingTMG,3cb9rj,Lyianx,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:11:42 2015 UTC,There's a case for all 3. I tend to go for Stealth at the moment but I think they all have a place.

XWingTMG,3cb9rj,AffixBayonets,1 point,Tue Jul 7 11:50:37 2015 UTC,"I really like this on the Tie Bomber.  Against a stress list, it doesn't have a good way to shed stress.  Without actions, it can't get Target Locks and those pretty ordinance just sit in your bays.  I played an Epic game as the Rebels, using a Transport kitted out to stress the other guys.  The bombers never got a shot off because of all the stress without having the greens to get rid of them."

XWingTMG,3cb9rj,AffixBayonets,2,Mon Jul 6 16:59:25 2015 UTC,"Triple Defenders  ""Trips"" were nicknames for Defenders (eyeballs for ties, squints for interceptors,  etc.)"
XWingTMG,3cb9rj,soaring_bear,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:03:03 2015 UTC,"Oh, got it! That's definitely an exotic build, and this seems like a good option there for red 1 turns that you follow with banks."
XWingTMG,3cb9rj,Copper_Lontra,-13,Mon Jul 6 17:04:25 2015 UTC,"not even that good, should have been a title. Defenders need engine upgrade to survive."

XWingTMG,3cb9rj,AffixBayonets,6,Mon Jul 6 16:14:17 2015 UTC,"Defenders don't need engine upgrade to survive. They aren't Interceptors, so if I try to fly them like squints, of course they're going to do poorly."

XWingTMG,3ce0ao,Petunia2t,1 point,Tue Jul 7 04:47:11 2015 UTC,"I think the ignore defense dice is more believable considering what homing missiles do, now its just advanced"

If its ignore defence dice then it might be too powerful. Maybe it will be an agility reduction? Or ignore defence dice but it's only a 2 dice attack?"
XWingTMG,3ce0ao,Terrestrialist,3,Tue Jul 7 06:52:14 2015 UTC,"What is commonly missed is Homing missiles don't use your target lock so you can reroll dice, or keep it for another attakc if you wish as well their ability to ignore evade tokens. T"
XWingTMG,3ce0ao,MartokTheAvenger,1 point,Tue Jul 7 08:04:43 2015 UTC,"wait... wut. I thought it did spend the lock, cuz (at least on squad builder) it says Attack (target Lock)."
XWingTMG,3ce0ao,Kuhva,1 point,Tue Jul 7 14:23:52 2015 UTC,"With homing missiles, you only need the Target Lock to perform that attack, because it doesn't say to spend it."

XWingTMG,3ce0ao,theblackthorne,1 point,Tue Jul 7 17:04:14 2015 UTC,"That just means you need a target lock to make the attack, pretty much every other ordnance weapon also instructs you to discard the lock as well. I think there's another missile that needs focus that doesn't tell you to discard as well."
XWingTMG,3cco6t,ghallo,3,Mon Jul 6 21:48:43 2015 UTC,"I am very confused as to why your game took so long. At the time the Z-95 died, were all 4 B-wings and both IG-88s still on the board? What kind of strategy was the IG-88 player using?"
XWingTMG,3cco6t,EdgeOfDreams,3,Mon Jul 6 21:52:45 2015 UTC,"IG-88 arcdoding and not getting shots as a result?  Dunno.  B-wings should totally be able to spread out firing arcs to make it impossible to avoid all shots, at which point you should be able to kill something in less than 2 hours..."
XWingTMG,3cco6t,VanderLegion,1 point,Mon Jul 6 22:10:19 2015 UTC,"One of the IG-88s was the ""free evade when you boost"" pilot and ghallo tended to low rolls for the entire game. Also, ghallo was doing a lot more arc-dodging of his own with the Bs and not much in the way of focus/target locks.  As for my other brother, he did some damage to the Bs, it was just spread out over the entire squad. 2 shields gone from every ship."
XWingTMG,3cco6t,internetpointsaredum,1 point,Mon Jul 6 23:24:33 2015 UTC,"When the Z-95 died everything else was still on the board.  I was down 12 shield tokens and he was down 5 shield tokens.  The problem was that he had 3 (often 4) evade dice - and with his boost he was rarely at range 1 and always had an evade token.  I made a big mistake of splitting my B's at first, but even bringing them together the RNG gods were giving me few hits - and he evaded most of the ones I did get."
XWingTMG,3cco6t,JohnLucCarry91,2,Tue Jul 7 05:04:37 2015 UTC,How
XWingTMG,3cco6t,boredompwndu,1 point,Mon Jul 6 22:00:51 2015 UTC,"Autothrusters and some CC from the brobots. Takes the ""bite"" out of them, but they can play with their food instead of killing it outright. Also, since there is no time limit, they can keep running around the board trying to sneak a fast one of the B-wings. If they don't like the chance, they can duck back out with a boost before or after."
XWingTMG,3cco6t,AffixBayonets,1 point,Mon Jul 6 23:16:41 2015 UTC,"I guess, but the Bs should be taking serious damage from the Brobots."
XWingTMG,3cco6t,boredompwndu,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:07:39 2015 UTC,"According to OP earlier, each of the B's had lost 2 shields, which is totally possible if the aggressors kept doing Ion and Flechette cannons"
XWingTMG,3cco6t,AffixBayonets,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:17:02 2015 UTC,"I suppose, but I'd tell anyone to stay away from those two! You've got to have some bite if you're taking cannons, and HLC Aggressors have done very well in games I've played against them or witnessed."
XWingTMG,3cco6t,boredompwndu,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:20:26 2015 UTC,"I like having them. They're cheap and give me options. If I want raw damage I go to the main weapon, and go to control options if the main whiffs. Nothing as rewarding (or infuriating) as your key ship being stressed, ioned, and out of the fight for a few rounds"
XWingTMG,3cco6t,AffixBayonets,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:23:29 2015 UTC,"Having one of them maybe, but I think taking two is wasting IG-88B's ability. That gunner-like ability works best with a Mangler or HLC to take advantage of your best rolls. 3 basic dice with no reroll and no turret isn't that good if it's on a ship worth 50 points."
XWingTMG,3cco6t,CaryinTacoma,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:28:56 2015 UTC,"I was flying the BroBots.  B and C mirrored  Mangler, Flechete, Ad sensors, Auto trusters and PTL  He started out with BBZ on one side and BB on the other (just outside of the asteroid line  I started out opposite the BB set. I would boost, get free evade, focus, and the take a green to clear stress.  But my dice rolls were crap for damage...I managed to do 1 damage multiple times, and NEVER got to use the B special ability.  Also both times he managed to get within range 1 of me with a B wing he rolled 4 blanks...that was just brutal for him.  I only missed getting a shot on SOMETHING 2 rounds (first and like 6th)  We gave up because we were over 1.5 hours in when I blew up the Z wing... and it was just going to be me zipping back and forth never letting him into range as I tried to get both arcs on 1 B to actually put some hurt on it"
XWingTMG,3cco6t,antigrapist,2,Wed Jul 8 20:45:43 2015 UTC,"8 tie swarm vs 8 tie swarm can be frustrating to play, not sure if timed games are worse because at least you know it will be over in an hour."

XWingTMG,3cco6t,Shgrizz,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:09:37 2015 UTC,This does not usually take this long. Would I be right in saying both of you were not playing aggressively? B-Wing squadrons have a habit of annihilating anything in their frontal arcs.
XWingTMG,3cco6t,FearOfBadgers,1 point,Mon Jul 6 23:51:00 2015 UTC,"I did make the mistake of splitting my B's at the start, but with his Boost and Adv sensors he was pretty much never where I predicted.  I usually only had arc with 2 of the B's"
XWingTMG,3cco6t,Mitb,1 point,Tue Jul 7 05:05:58 2015 UTC,"I can go one bigger on matching up bad lists. Not because it was a boring game, but the opposite - it was completely brutal.   We both had a number of pre-prepared lists, so we chose at random. I can't remember the exact lists, but they were roughly as follows:  Imperial: Soontir Fel + Carnor Jax, both with PTL and autothrusters, Whisper with VI, Advanced Cloaking device  Scum: Kavil and Syndicate Thug, both with R4 agromech and Blaster Turret, IG88-B with Mangler cannon, Binayre Pirate  One thing should leap out at you here, and we didn't realise what a game changer it would be until we started playing. Carnor Jax's ability prevents anything at range 1 spending focus or evade tokens, completely shutting down both the Y wings' secondary weapons, as long as Carnor could stay close. Of course, an interceptor with PTL will have no problem whatsoever tailing a Y wing. There was no escape.  The IG went down to one hull early, due to a triple flanking maneuver and a range 1 barrage from all three imperial ships, with no shots in return. He made one attack the entire game, which was laughed at by autothrusters. He was later finished by the phantom, while the interceptors arced between the Y wings, shutting down their turrents whenever they posed a threat, and harrying them until they were both blown up. The opponent called it there. If the IG had done some more work, it could have been a closer game, but I've never seen one list so strongly matched against another. Not only did I not lose a ship, I didn't take a single point of damage. The whole game was a total horror show. Grimly satisfying though, although I felt bad that the RNG gods had decided to take a big shit on my opponent's face."

XWingTMG,3ccmmn,VanderLegion,3,Mon Jul 6 21:36:58 2015 UTC,When they were talking about different lists vs tiers on Nova Squadron Radio in the early regionals season I think they put it at like Tier 1.5.  Though part of what they said is there simply wans't enough results yet to be able to say if it'd make it up to tier 1 or not.

You have to build your list around the fact that it may be the first thing to move, and it may be the last, or it may be somewhere in the middle.  Almost no other list group in major jugglers big book of lists seems to have that. The majority that I see will either Spam low, run 2-3 high, or do a mix of those 2"
XWingTMG,3ccmmn,VanderLegion,1 point,Mon Jul 6 23:11:00 2015 UTC,"Stress, if brobots don't get their actions, that really hurts them.  And to that end, low pilot skill blockers, 6/7+ ship swarms that can block all moves takes some good planning"

It's not the same as a TL or focus but it's better than having nothing. And if you're fighting a swarm, it may be just as good as a TL.

While 4 red dice worth of damage as rolled is nothing to sneeze at, it isn't much for the effort either. You can block a ton of asteroid lanes with 12 cluster mines, sure. But at the same time, any one of those ships is going to be getting shot at, and 8-9 health at 1 agility, it isn't going to be pretty against most metas.

XWingTMG,3cbbe4,Copper_Lontra,3,Mon Jul 6 16:23:42 2015 UTC,"No crits, but when you do the math, it does 2.25 mean damage (6 * 3/8) on a full detonation. That makes it essentially Proximity Mines with a focus in terms of mean damage output. The chances of a full detonation, though, are much higher against large based ships. Good thing those are all over the meta."
XWingTMG,3cbbe4,forkmonkey88,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:31:02 2015 UTC,A large base ship still is only going to set off one if they go through it.  I was excited about these with a 1/2 chance of damage.  3/8 makes it a little tougher.  I would assume that most times you will only get one or two to go off immediately.

XWingTMG,3cca34,thebaronvonanonymous,3,Mon Jul 6 22:11:16 2015 UTC,"Toss bombing:       Toss bombing (sometimes known as loft bombing, and by the U.S. Air Force as the Low Altitude Bombing System, LABS) is a method of bombing where the attacking aircraft pulls upward when releasing its bomb load, giving the bomb additional time of flight by starting its ballistic path with an upward vector. The purpose of toss bombing is to compensate for the gravity drop of the bomb in flight, and allow an aircraft to bomb a target without flying directly over it. This is in order to avoid overflying a heavily defended target, or in order to distance the attacking aircraft from the blast effects of a nuclear (or conventional) bomb.

XWingTMG,3cca34,mattman676,2,Mon Jul 6 20:42:52 2015 UTC,"Yeah, kinda like a kinetic bomb launch where you launch them with momentum rather than the normal bomb launch where you place it in one spot and leave.

It was a big deal waaaaay back when, when people would take two Falcons and just 1-straight them into each other in the middle repeatedly, but the list never ended up being all that good, so they just left it. If YV-666 fortressing ends up being extremely strong, I imagine they'll do something about it, but I don't think it'll be all that great."
XWingTMG,3cb9c8,Raphah,4,Mon Jul 6 16:14:15 2015 UTC,It is perfectly legal but not very effective. If someone won a major tournament by fortressing all the way through then FFG might do something about it.  It also isn't very fun to play or play against.  I don't think anything will be done.
XWingTMG,3cb9c8,PCGamerPirate,4,Mon Jul 6 16:45:22 2015 UTC,"We haven't seen viable fortressing with 360º arcs. I don't see how 180º arcs would be better.   Fortressing eliminates your actions. While an enemy coming in would have a hard time approaching, a fortressed YV-666 only gets 1 attack with 3 dice. The opponent could be coming in with 3-4 ships with target locks, focus, or evades along with heavy ordinance. Only a perfect roll and terrible luck would kill even 1 ship per turn sitting in a corner like that. While your opponent unleashes all their attack dice against it's 1 defense die(2 dice at range 3)."
XWingTMG,3cb9c8,Wootai,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:56:24 2015 UTC,Yeah I don't think we really need to worry about competitive fortressing until we get a ship with 360 or 180 arcs and 2 or 3 defense dice.

The shuttle has 90 degree arc. Compared to this boat, the Y-Wing is made of tissue paper. Hence the sitution is somewhat new - it's the first time we;ve got an extended foward arc with so many hit points for this price.

XWingTMG,3cb9c8,MisterLamp,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:17:06 2015 UTC,"I think it works by putting your TIE beside it, then doing a short maneuver (2 bank, I think. Never actually done this myself) to park it in front, perpendicular to the facing of the shuttle. You can then execute impossible white hard turns into the shuttle to keep the TIE in place, while the shuttle does impossible white forward 1's to stay in place. I'm sure this could be replicated with a Headhunter and YV-666."

XWingTMG,3cb9c8,mxzf,3,Mon Jul 6 16:45:40 2015 UTC,That would be why it doesn't execute a 1-forward. A left 1-bank would ram it into the other shuttle.

XWingTMG,3cb9c8,LiquidAether,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:54:36 2015 UTC,"I'm guessing it involves making a 3 hard turn into the large base ship as your first move with your blocking ship.

XWingTMG,3cb9c8,fl1p_problems,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:32:20 2015 UTC,Big ships can be set up at a 45 degree angle.  They're allowed to extend beyond the deployment zone provided one corner touches your table edge.  Then a Z-95 or Scyk just has to get into blocking position before the Big Ship moves.
XWingTMG,3cb9c8,MisterLamp,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:33:26 2015 UTC,"Positioning it at a 45 degree angle in a corner facing outward would eliminate any clear approach.  You could probably prop 2 Y's with BTL titles behind it in the corner, and as long as one of them had Wingman you could keep it going.  Having Bossk in a crew slot would make up for the lack of actions.  EDIT: Here's an example starting position.  Note: The arc on the YV-666 is 180 degrees, so it's wider than what's pictured."
XWingTMG,3cb9c8,AffixBayonets,4,Mon Jul 6 17:44:15 2015 UTC,"As a follow-up, here's a squad I'd try it with:  Trandoshan Slaver (29), Heavy Laser Cannon (7), Gunner (5), Outlaw Tech (2)  Syndicate Thug (18), Twin Laser Turret (6)  Palob Godalhi (20), Wingman (2), Twin Laser Turret (6), K4 Security Droid (3), Glitterstim (2)  View in Squad List  How to Play:   Starting position in corner YV-666 executes Red Stop, gets focus token from Outlaw Tech Y-wing banks into YV-666, doesn't move. HWK green banks into YV-666, gets a free target lock. Beginning of combat the YV's stress is removed from Wingman, and Palob strips a token from people diving in. During combat if the HLC misses, Gunner kicks in. Glitterstim on Palob is to protect him if they try to dive in on him to break up the combo.   Gives you 3 ships with fairly reliable shots at range 2-3 (TLT looks like solid damage).  You're parked in the corner so they likely won't fly into range 1 and risk the board edge.  You don't get actions, but Scum has decent crew to make up for it.  (You could swap in Bossk on the YV-666, but you'd need a second Wingman to remove the double stress he'd pile on.)"

It almost entirely relies on making turn maneuvers to cheat the movement. A single ionized ship will ruin that and force them forward 1 and unfortunately there is no reverse. If they fortress in the corner, that has an extremely high chance of forcing 1 ship out of formation and a 2nd ship off the board completely. Easier still, a suicide run with a bomber using a k turn. A single bomb planted in the middle of a crowded engagement is crushing.  It's a funny and clever loophole, but it's not very effective. Especially against a defender, bomber, firespray, or decimator."
XWingTMG,3cb9c8,JohnLucCarry91,1 point,Mon Jul 6 19:25:53 2015 UTC,"I agree pre-Wave 7 fortressing doesn't really have an effective squad to make it work.  I love space cows, but they don't have a squad composition that scares me if they fortress.  (The 90 degree arc also gives you avenues of approach.)  I'm curious about the YV-666, since it has a 180 degree arc and since Scum have a number of crew that can mitigate the loss of actions that fortressing causes.  I think Twin Laser Turret also helps the viability a bunch, since it gives you a fairly reliable turret damage source on a small ship base.  I'm also not too worried about the formation being broken up with an ionization.  If I tried it I would use the list above, and if it fell out of fortress mode the individual ships are still useful enough to make a go of it."

And one each of the Scimitars will also receive Flechette Torpedoes, Ion Pulse Missiles, and Homing Missiles.    All of the Scimitars will be murder within R2, and all three will have a tool useful utility weapon.  Squad will be able to generate stress, ionize anything in one shot, and bypass evade tokens, with two of the Scimitars being able to retain their TL for the next round if they fire the IPMs or HMs."
XWingTMG,3ccl0a,TurrPhennirPhan,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:53:01 2015 UTC,"They really need a ""dumb fire"" missile to break the meta. Fires like a bomb with a straight 4 or something  and then hits everything in a 1 range radius. Even if it just functioned like a seismic charge but took a missile slot and used an attack that would have a HUGE impact on swarms and arc dodgers as you could blindly fire it at long range and just hit everything. Even if that was to cost 5 points it would still see a lot of play.   That being said, I'm still a fan of the Homing missile and will probably equip that + Adv. Homing Missile + Adv Proton torps (when I have the space) heavy hitters at all ranges."

XWingTMG,3cbyaj,sacimino40,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:39:22 2015 UTC,"I think PtL is a waste on Vessery. He doesn't have the positioning or defensive actions to make that EPT sing.  EPT's that would be better:  VI - There are some significant threats in the 6-7 range that you would love to out PS. VI is never a bad buy for Vess.  Lone Wolf - Being a little tricky to use, Vess can be a little more survivable and can support his shots if the TL painters go down.  Ruthlessness - He's the most accurate gun in the game and your build has a weakness to swarms. Getting bonus damage is always helpful and it will be pretty difficult to get stuck eating friendly fire with only 3 ships."

XWingTMG,3cbuds,Glucose98,5,Mon Jul 6 18:21:24 2015 UTC,"The official rule is that Ion tokens take effect during the planning phase, when they prevent you from assigning a dial. Because the dial is already assigned in this scenario, the ship executes the maneuver it was going to anyway, and the ion tokens stick around. Then, next round, the ion effect happens, the ship does its one forward, and the tokens clear."

XWingTMG,3cbuds,Cptnhalfbeard,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:39:46 2015 UTC,"If a ship gets an ion token during the activation phase it performs its chosen maneuver as normal.

XWingTMG,3cbeqj,SgtKashim,2,Mon Jul 6 16:27:03 2015 UTC,"I run a Doomshuttle(OGP+Darth Vader) with Whisper and Fel.  I would suggest dropping a lot of the points from the OGP. They're too slow and unwieldy to use as constant offense. Whisper and Fel are going to be your primary damage dealers Fel practically begs for Autothrusters, They've saved his skin more times than I can count. For Whisper, Fire control systems is a cheap way to really boost the quality of her attacks (provided you fly well to shoot on the same target multiple times). You can also put Targeting Comptuer on Fel to boost the quality of his attacks. Arc dodge, ptl Target lock and a free focus is devastating.   My current build is:  OGP w/ Darth Vader  Whisper w/ VI, Gunner, Advacned Cloaking Device, Fire Control Systems  Soontir Fel w/ PtL, Auto Thrusters   I have also done Fel and two generic phantoms. Lots of fun, but a glass cannon. with only 11 hp, don't get shot!"
XWingTMG,3cbeqj,soaring_bear,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:28:22 2015 UTC,I'll play with it. Gracias.
XWingTMG,3cbeqj,AffixBayonets,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:30:20 2015 UTC,"These builds can be very successful but traditionally people run the Shuttle with Vader and nothing else. The Shuttle looks like it could be a neat cannon carrier, but it won't be able to point in the right direction enough without EU and maybe Advanced Sensors too.   Also, these days Soontir really needs Autothrusters to survive in a turreted world. Stealth Device helps him too, so if you slim down the shuttle that's where some of the points should go.   If you're dead set on the tactician then why not put it on the Phantom? I've had some success with them there."
XWingTMG,3cbeqj,AffixBayonets,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:29:53 2015 UTC,"Something like this?   Omicron Group + Vader, Flechette Whisper + Veteran Instinct, Adv. Cloaking, Tactician  Soontir + PTL, Autothrusters   Looks interesting. I'll try that next time I play as well..."
XWingTMG,3cao60,Nomnomnicon,3,Mon Jul 6 12:38:35 2015 UTC,"It's just so crazy that it might just work!  Would definitely go for VI on Whisper, especially with only two ships to field. Really only one that could outrank you is Corran with VI.   I would trade out Fleet Officer for Navigator. Normally I run with FCS but since you have to stay as maneuverable as possible, AS might be the better choice to have options. With both Nav and AS, you get just as maneuverable before the decloak nerf and if you can use them to arc dodge and get within R1, you are doing some damage even without modifiers like Pred or FCS."
XWingTMG,3cao60,kkentium,1 point,Mon Jul 6 13:34:46 2015 UTC,"XD Thanks! :D   VI is a yes - I thought Pred might be good for accuracy, especially against swarms, but I wasn't comfortable and it appears my fears are shared.   Fleet Officer makes Brath a lot more scary, and the AS shifts the stress comfortably. I might try a couple of games with Navigator but my gut doesn't like it....or perhaps I have a bad feeling about this?"
XWingTMG,3cao60,kkentium,2,Mon Jul 6 16:46:39 2015 UTC,"My standard Whisper tournament build is VI + Nav + FCS + ACD. Outside of any fluke shots, she is running dudes DOWN. Often times Nav is the difference between a R2 4 die shot and a R1 5 die ""pink mist"" shot. It really is helpful to close the gap and get the kill shot more often than naught.  I think with Engine Upgrade, Brath gonna be alright. It can take some hits as well as dish some out and that white 4K turn... oh la la."
XWingTMG,3cao60,fl1p_problems,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:14:07 2015 UTC,"I get what you're saying, but having an extra focus means he can get more shots on target AND spend one to flip them to crits.   Question: If I select a green 2 and change to a white 3, do I still de-stress? If so I'm much happier with this decision."
XWingTMG,3cao60,Sallyjack,3,Mon Jul 6 19:50:24 2015 UTC,"I'd switch Predator on Whisper for VI and shooting first, and the Advanced Sensors for a FCS (more accuracy) or Sensor Jammers (more survivability).  Your problem will be any list with a high damage output. A cloaked Phantom can still explode in one round of shooting and Rexler doesn't live forever either."
XWingTMG,3cao60,Sallyjack,1 point,Mon Jul 6 14:58:02 2015 UTC,"I am well aware of what kills Phantoms xD sadly....most things when they're a little lucky. FCS is too glass hammer in my two ship build, and Sensor Jammer would stop me using Fleet Officer effectively. Having seen that most people agree with my original analysis I'll go back to running VI on Whisper - I used to in my normal build on him."
XWingTMG,3cao60,Durog25,2,Mon Jul 6 16:43:46 2015 UTC,"I think Whisper does need VI more than any other upgrade.  It's too critical that Whisper fires first to get cloaked and a focus for defense  Also, I'm a fan of FCS and Gunner.  You really don't think 4 dice need a Gunner, but the token stripping power, followed by a Target Locked Gunner shot, is unmatched.  Watch out Soontir!"
XWingTMG,3cao60,X-factor103,2,Mon Jul 6 13:52:23 2015 UTC,"I used to run Whisper as much more of a knife - VI, FCS but Weapons Engineer, not Gunner so he could have an TL for his next target and influence my enemy's movement somewhat as they tried to keep two ships out of Whisper's arc. It upset a lot of people.  But I want to move away from that slightly, and the corrective movement off a Advanced Sensors barrel + Decloak move is something I enjoy surprising people with.  However, dropping down to VI leaves me space to grab Gunner instead of Fleet Officer. I'm just wary of losing some of Brath's pain potential is all. I'm likely to get VI, however. A 3 point initiative bid is pretty strong."

Unfortunately, the new rules state that decloaking is done before the activation phase.    Advanced sensors is used immediately before you reveal your dial (during the activation phase) and forgoes the perform action step."

An email from a developer said no, the ion tokens don't take effect until the planning phase and the same thing would happen here."
XWingTMG,3c9qij,antigrapist,3,Mon Jul 6 05:32:49 2015 UTC,"No, Ion Tokens dont Allow you do assign a dial to your ship. You a dial at your ship, so its the NEXT planning phase where you cant do it."
XWingTMG,3c9qij,Waramo,-4,Mon Jul 6 08:03:55 2015 UTC,"Sounds correct to me. The rules for being ioned are to follow the following steps during the appropriate phases:   Planning Phase: The owner does not assign a maneuver dial to this ship. Activation Phase: The owner moves the ship as if it were assigned a white [1] maneuver. After executing this maneuver, remove all ion tokens from the ship. It may perform actions as normal. Combat Phase: The ship may attack as normal.   If you get an ion token (or two for a large ship) after the planning phase but before you move in the activation phase, I think you would still follow the Activation Phase section of the rules above."
XWingTMG,3c9qij,i_shit_my_spacepants,3,Mon Jul 6 05:35:55 2015 UTC,"No, you need to start from the top. You only resolve your ion tokens if you have a token during the planning phase."
XWingTMG,3c9qij,RDT2,1 point,Mon Jul 6 12:20:05 2015 UTC,"This would be my preferred ruling on this, a pilot like Emon could easily move first, throw the net in front of something slippery (like a VI Aggressor) and shut it down before it could move. You could be confident of this before hand and have all your other ships move accordingly.  Even a Syndicate Thug with an Unhinged Mech could manage this bomb delivery, makes for a new style of control I think."
XWingTMG,3c9qij,Petunia2t,1 point,Mon Jul 6 08:29:57 2015 UTC,"Not correct at all.  You don't apply the effect of the ion tokens at any point other than the planning phase, which has already passed."

I play Scum, so I'm at least familiar with Ys.  I was originally going to write something about additional offensive power, but I'm not sure it's necessary.  2 damage per turn doesn't seem like a whole lot, but since it's two separate attacks the damage is more likely to stick.  I think these new turrets are going to be more powerful than they appear.  I can't wait to run Drea Renthal with an Agromech and that turret.  Spend a target lock on the first shot, take a stress to get another target lock for the second shot.  In rebels, I'd at least run Stressbot on one of them, because why not.  Dropping multiple stress tokens on a target, or stressing two separate targets, is going to be really good."

It is 6 dmg dice but also has 3 prockets in there too to really bring the hurt on something. In a game that is an hour long you dance around and kill the big points with the prockets while taking as little damage as possible.   Not a style of game I like but it's there.

Jake just doesn't pack the punch to get damage out unless you get Outmaneouver over VI, and then he's PS 7 so could be outflown by Fel. Or get Proton Rockets so you could lay down the hurt for a round - and a Stealth Device if you want to try to get a 6 dice attack.  How would I fly an A-wing? Arvel/Gemma, mid PS blockers. I'd have X or B's backing them up so you could level the firepower in. Or, if I'm completely honest, lots of little ones with Stealth and Prockets for the Alpha strike.

Fair - Jake is certainly up to par on mobility. My main problem agaisnt Jake as a central ship is that his pair of attack dice are limited in the fear-inspiring powers.

The proton rockets are great, but require a focus + TL combo to use and that means that any return shot will likely hurt / kill the A-wing. IF you manage to get behind someone on range 1 the 3 dice with TL vs Soontirs only focused 4 dice becomes much better (blanks hurt Fel badly), but at any range other than one the 2 dice come out a bit pathetic on a ship in the 30 point range.

The A-wing does appear in the elimination rounds of major events and it isn't completely useless. One just has to realise what it's there for. To block. It's not there just to soak up the last few points or shoot a missile: that's the Z-95's job.

XWingTMG,3c5v99,AnDanDan,6,Sun Jul 5 02:50:36 2015 UTC,You're correct on the first question. It stays facing forward. You still get a stress token.   For the second one it depends. If you land on a rock and the base is hanging off the end of the rock then for your next move your template will not be touching the rock and therefore you can move without rolling for a hit. If the base is sitting on the rock so that the template still touches the rock when you move then you're still moving through the rock and you roll for a hit and can not take an action.
XWingTMG,3c5v99,DangerFord,2,Sun Jul 5 02:59:03 2015 UTC,"You bump, don't execute the turn, and do take a stress.  This is covered on page 17 of the core rulebook (the ""important"" paragraph).   Page 16 of the FAQ covers this.  The answer is that you only suffer the effects of an asteroid if the maneuver template or the final position of your ship overlaps the asteroid.  Meaning that you only 'hit' an asteroid on the second turn if the front pegs of your base are actually on the asteroid when you end your first turn (causing the maneuver template to start from 'inside' the asteroid)."
XWingTMG,3c5v99,mxzf,3,Sun Jul 5 03:58:32 2015 UTC,"You don't necessarily take stress. ""..instead threat its maneuver as a (strait forward) maneuver with the same speed and color..."" Tie defenders for the win."

XWingTMG,3c65jk,vicisss,4,Sun Jul 5 04:59:28 2015 UTC,"Pick up a TIE Fighter for yourself.  If you like running swarms, a 5-TIE miniswarm will work nicely and has room for another ship as a flanker.   E-Wing and B-Wing are both great ships to load points into for the rebels.  Picking up an E might be nice for your gf since it's a solid and heavy hitter that can hold its own quite well. If your gf wants to run pairs of ships, a pair of IG-2000s might be worth considering.  It's a bit on the pricy side (~$40-50 together on Amazon), but pairs of them make for a really good 100 point fleet. Decimator with a high level Interceptor or Phantom is a common two-ship build for Imperials.  About the same investment from where you are now as the IGs though.   A-Wings are also a lot of fun to fly.  They're hard to load up with points, so probably not ideal for your gf, but might be fun to run a few of them for you.   Due to point costs that ships end up being, you're probably going to need to pick up at least one large ship, if not two, for your gf to put together a 100 point list with only 2 ships (3 is doable with small ships, but it sounds like she'd prefer 2).  It's definitely doable though.  Also, a Defender counts as a large ship for that advice (especially if you have a HLC to put on it), since Defenders cost a LOT of points but are good and fun to fly.   You have a LOT of options, it really depends on what you want to do with your purchases.  There are definitely ways to make it all work for both of you, it really depends on which ships/upgrades you would have more fun using.  Also, consider running some ~70 point battles.  it's fairly easy to load up a small ship to 35 points if you're tricking it out (especially Bs, Es, and Defenders), so your gf only has to run 2 ships, but you can also fit a nice sized swarm into 70 points for you to run (Howl+4x Academy TIEs is 66 points total)."
XWingTMG,3c65jk,mxzf,1 point,Sun Jul 5 06:37:28 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply! Exactly what I was looking for.  Taking everything you've said into account, I think I'll buy a Decimator, E-Wing and an A-Wing (or, actually, maybe another b-wing for the ion cannon/autoblaster). I just realized that I have $10 in credit at a local hobby shop, so I'll use that to grab a Tie-Fighter as well, and everyone wins!  I hadn't considered playing with 70 points, and will most certainly give that a spin.   For the IG-2000's is it possible to use them without owning the Scum and Villainy expansion? I just kind of assumed that I had to purchase that first."
XWingTMG,3c65jk,mxzf,3,Sun Jul 5 07:16:39 2015 UTC,"There's no specific Scum and Villainy expansion that you need to play.  The Most Wanted expansion is a great starter set for getting into S&V, but the only thing you need to play a S&V fleet is enough points worth of S&V ships, and IG-2000s can be loaded with enough points to have 100 points between just two of them.    Literally the only required buy to play X-Wing is the core set, since it has the movement templates, damage deck, dice, and asteroids.  Every other expansion is just extra ships to add to your fleet.  It sounds like you've got a pretty good start there, those additions should fill out your fleet and give you some good ships to work with for interesting fleets."

Vassal has an active player base, you can easily find a match every day. TTS is too young, you'll end up flying with your friends.

Both are solid large-base ships that come with some very good pilots and upgrades and can be flown well in a 2-ship list. That way you have a large base ship for each side, but each has a distinct way of flying and strategy.  Http://www.reddit.com/r/XWingTMG/wiki/faq/buying"
XWingTMG,3c65jk,EdgeOfDreams,1 point,Sun Jul 5 05:03:27 2015 UTC,"I've considered this, but the problem is, I'm not particularly interested in having a large ship for both sides (I'd rather not use one myself).

I'm really not sure about the Firespray (if someone wants to send me one to measure, I won't object).  If you're going for any ship, the epic ships are also taller.  I'm not sure how much taller though."
XWingTMG,3c5nmf,mxzf,1 point,Sun Jul 5 02:33:44 2015 UTC,unless i cut it down my starviper requires two pegs coming in at just under 100mm. Any Idea how tall a lambda is?

XWingTMG,3c5nmf,Atheric2,2,Sun Jul 5 03:38:30 2015 UTC,The Lambda is just over 100mm with both wings folded up. Because the Firespray requires a second peg it's a little under 110mm

XWingTMG,3c6dtm,Leonidas26,7,Sun Jul 5 07:02:13 2015 UTC,"What you do is move the Decimator up to the end of the template, then move it backwards along the template until it is not overlapping anything. In the example you gave, it's possible that the Decimator could end up landing in-between the Outrider and the X-Wing, but only if there is enough space there. Otherwise, it will keep moving backward and would be considered to have bumped the X-Wing.  You only process a bump if there is a collision at the END of the maneuver, then you start backtracking and consider other overlaps. If the Outrider wasn't there, the fact that there's an X-Wing in the path wouldn't matter, because the Decimator moves far enough and fast enough to get completely clear on the other side."

Don't get me wrong, I love the jammer, but since Oicunn already wants to be all up in everyone's business you might as well get some free damage (possibly) on people.  The jammer does give your squints some extra defense if they're hiding, but the dice gods are fickle.  YMMV."
XWingTMG,3c4uhh,Clepto_06,1 point,Sun Jul 5 04:31:44 2015 UTC,"My personal opinion of Tactical Jammers is that it is only effective if you are Rebels and running Biggs, because in any other situation the opponent can simply shoot at your Decimator instead. I realize that you might be able to find weird situations where base contact works in your favor, but honestly you're better off to just take the thrusters."
XWingTMG,3c4uhh,JohnLucCarry91,0,Sun Jul 5 08:41:38 2015 UTC,"Intimidation won't be great on Oicunn. Yes, he wants to hit, but his low Pilot Skill means he'll often bump, and then the ship will move away. Ditch the Tactical Jammer as well. It's awesome when your opponent can't Focus, but otherwise not that valuable.  Also, Push the Limit isn't great on the Royals. You don't want to keep them limited to green maneuvers. Predator would be better. Or, give one of them Autothrusters and Outmaneuver to shut down Han lists, and just put Predator on the other."
XWingTMG,3c4uhh,bl1y,1 point,Sun Jul 5 09:55:49 2015 UTC,"Woooooaaaaah, hold up... since when is PTL NOT absolutely-freaking-tastic-amazing on RGPs?  With an INTs dial, being limited to greens is pretty minor.  They're probably the best ship in the game for that EPT.  Sure, Predator and Outmaneuver can work, but PTL is gold in the hands of virtually any INT.  And I think you're confusing Tactical Jammer with Sensor Jammer.  Tactical Jammer is the one that makes your ships a moving obstruction."
XWingTMG,3c4uhh,TurrPhennirPhan,0,Sun Jul 5 22:11:34 2015 UTC,"Being limited to greens means you can't K-turn. That's a very significant disadvantage. Once your ship's location is predictable, it's easier to kill, especially for lower pilot skill ships that can make it very hard to arc dodge. Keeping the K-turn on the table makes these guys very slippery.  PtL also gets shut down very quickly against any list that has a reliable stress mechanic. Once your interceptor is double stressed, he's dead. In any large tournament you have to expect to go up against at least one person who has built his list to handle Soontir, and anything that counters Soontir will be even stronger against a PtL Royal Guard. Keeping stress off your RGT makes him more resilient against the anti-Soontir meta."
XWingTMG,3c4uhh,bl1y,2,Sun Jul 5 22:26:46 2015 UTC,"I want whatever you are smoking because it must be good stuff. PtL is interceptors bread and butter. I've been flying them since their release. Sure there are new counters to them, but that just means you have to play them a bit smarter. K turns aren't necessary if you are flanking correctly, and if you plan on K-turning you should've planned for it at least a few turns in advance to prep not taking a stress that turn. The ability to arc dodge and still have a mod for dice is also extremely needed. While yes there are interesting combos to go with the Tie/IN, PtL is basically your best bet, regardless of meta."

XWingTMG,3c4hyn,1_73,2,Sun Jul 5 07:42:55 2015 UTC,"TL can't be used beyond range 3. So if your opponents PS is higher than yours (quite likely at PS 4) You might not be in range after your move and have to pick focus. Then your opponent moves and destroys one of your Zs. The following turn gets you your TLs, but your opponent will shoot before your ships get to loose your ordnance and maybe kill another Z."

Phantoms, and especially Echo, can be a bit hard for beginners to fly themselves or fly against, though, so that might influence your decisions.  To get some good rebels stuff going, I'd recommend the Rebel Aces or a Y-Wing. The Millennium Falcon is also a great option. Anything with a turret is going to be very useful against a Phantom because it negates the Phantom's ability to safely shoot you from behind.  If you don't have much of a collection yet, but want to play with others who don't even own anything, I highly recommend playing smaller-than-standard games at first, such as 60 or 75 points."

You don't see it very much because it's pretty expensive to go from P2 to PS4. 2 points for 2 pilot skill that won't be super useful against most of the squad you face is hard to pay, especially when you want to field 4 rebel ships. Ships that only pay one point to get 2 PS are far more likely to be run at PS3-4."
XWingTMG,3c2gtp,antigrapist,2,Sat Jul 4 04:35:51 2015 UTC,I've definitely seen lists with royal guard squadron pilots looking very nice - with their ept they can take VI to get a pilot skill of 8. That plus autothrusters takes you to 25 points and you can take 4!

Saber squadron or Royal Guard interceptors with PtL are fun and can do a lot of work for the evil empire, imho.   Played a game yesterday that came down to Luke vs. a Royal Guard staring at each other at point blank range with 1 and 2 hull left, respectively. I was tempted to just call it a draw at that point, but we pressed on and the focus/evade combo prevailed. Chalk one up for the empire!"

Having PS 3  against a squad of PS 2 Ships has the same effect as having PS 9.  Since there are so many high PS Pilots out there, you would need to go at least one higher than that. Soontir is kind of an MVP right now, so the optimum Pilot skill would be one higher than his PS 9. Compared to Dash, Han, Chiraneau, Corran, Fel, Ig-88... any point Pilot skill above the lowest and up to 6 of a ship is only protection against Predator and helps out against the swarm lists while doing nothing against the high PS lists. Wasted points."

XWingTMG,3c2gtp,excallq,1 point,Sat Jul 4 03:49:37 2015 UTC,"Paul Heaver's 2013 World Championship list (and his games from that event) are a great example of a Creeped Pilot Skill being effective. At that time, it was meta to go all in on basic X-Wings or Tie Fighters, and so his PS4 B-Wings were generally able to react to and out-maneuver his opponent, giving himself a considerable combat advantage; often times he was able to Barrel Roll completely outside of enemy firing arcs and get free shots in!  His games have taught me that high Pilot Skill is exceptionally valuable for ships that can Barrel Roll and Boost (which allows you to react to your opponent). Consequently, I feel that Pilot Skill can (at times) be squandered if the model doesn't have the ability to reposition itself after maneuvers have been revealed.  TL;DR: It's very good for ships that can Barrel Roll or Boost"

XWingTMG,3c29ii,Gardevoir282,1 point,Sat Jul 4 02:22:47 2015 UTC,"Well that's a wide range of questions that would probably get a better response on the mini painting subreddit.  But with that said, if this is your first airbrush, I'd recommend a badger 350. It's a single action airbrush (easier to use and maintain).  The next part is propellant. You could start with canned air as its relatively inexpensive for the beginning but you'll eventually want to get a hobby air compressor.  As for paint, generally want to avoid craft paint (walmart acrylics) because their thicker pigment could clog up the brush. Plus you'd need a lot of acrylic thinner to make the paint thin enough to use. (I recall reading something about a guy having great results with rubbing alcohol as a thinner? But I wouldn't recommend it personally.) you can use regular hobby paint but you'll want to water it down first. There's also specifically made airbrush paint but that tends to be expensive.  I think that covers most of the bases. Not the best primer but hopefully I provided enough information to guide you in your endeavors."

XWingTMG,3c29ii,Falk3r,2,Sat Jul 4 13:03:15 2015 UTC,Sure.  Just prime your model the majority color and use brushes for the remainder.    Even with the air brush I'd imagine you will be using brushes for highlights and shadows anyway.  I highly recommend you search YouTube and watch some tutorials.   Lots of good stuff out there.

The only time they have fallen out is when I pulled the mini straight up off of a steel shingle. They have never come out when using a magnetic pad. My friend has also had good luck with hot glue.  I just started playing this week. I plan on adding 3mm by 1mm magnets to all the ships along with door bumpers to prevent sliding. My order doesnt show up until Wednesday thanks to the long weekend. I will try to take a picture when I get everything in.   If I can get my son to sleep I'll take a picture of a fantasy model to give you a idea.
XWingTMG,3c28kn,TheDap13,1 point,Sat Jul 4 03:07:12 2015 UTC,http://imgur.com/5WDLk0g  I used an off brand green stuff that was grey for that model.   The how to: Lay out a magnet pad with a piece of wax paper over it. Grab as many magets as you need and leave them in a stack on the pad. This will help you keep one polarity witch might not be a issue. I mixed up enough green stuff for all the models I would work on that sitting. Run your hands under the tap and shake dry them the green stuff will not stick to your hands. Pitch off a small amount of the material place it on the model. Take one of the magnets and set it by itself on the wax paper over the pad. Press the model down onto the magnet. This will ensure the magnet sits flush with what ever you set the model on. Let the model sit over night.  I would not use super glue. I have had terrible results with it to secure magnets.
XWingTMG,3c28kn,TheDap13,1 point,Sat Jul 4 03:45:14 2015 UTC,"I use krazy glue and it seems to work fine. I thought about sanding my magnets down for friction as well, but it's not necessary; my magnets seem to hold just fine. I would suggest pulling the plastic peg out and drilling straight into the ship to fit whatever magnet you have. Most ships are hollow in the middle, so be careful not to go too far. Sometimes it's also more beneficial to drill into a new spot in the center of the ship instead of where the peg used to be. Always keep some krazy glue handy just in case and I have a few spare peg stands in case I need to replace it in a rush."

XWingTMG,3bzyzp,Durog25,1 point,Sat Jul 4 04:20:38 2015 UTC,I like that. It also makes it competitive in comparison to the HLC which it would compete with. It can hit at all ranges but is limited to only one use.

XWingTMG,3c11vl,Petunia2t,3,Fri Jul 3 20:01:31 2015 UTC,I say swarm B the ties are more maneuverble and the attack die has more hits than the evade die has evades so the refill is better
XWingTMG,3c11vl,Verzhul,3,Fri Jul 3 20:13:01 2015 UTC,"I'm going to argue for the TIE Swarm.  You have a greater chance of getting hits than evades, so even with the rerolls available for both lists the hits of Howlrunner should allow the TIEs to always keep their focus for evading and overwhelm the rerolls on the evades of the Z-95s."
XWingTMG,3c11vl,3rd_Charmer,2,Fri Jul 3 20:13:30 2015 UTC,"So is Howlrunner just that good? Is Serissu overpriced? (I think so), or is it just as simple as the innate differences between the distribution on red and green dice?.."
XWingTMG,3c11vl,3rd_Charmer,3,Fri Jul 3 20:21:21 2015 UTC,"Howlrunner just is that good.  Serissu is more overpriced in that it costs another 2 points on all M3-A to equip a cannon or anything, but the free rerolls from Howl on attack is simply brutal and effective.  The only other thing that could make the different is the health on the Z-95s.  At range 2, it takes at least 2 TIEs to kill 1 Z, but 1 Z can kill 1 TIE if they manage a direct hit along with a hit.  If you're lucky."
XWingTMG,3c11vl,excallq,3,Fri Jul 3 20:58:52 2015 UTC,"The latter, plus the third evade die the TIE fighters are all going to have.   With Howl/Seri and without focus/evade/TL, the TIEs attacking will be two red + 1 reroll vs 2 green + 1 reroll. Hits vs evades for that is 1.25 vs 1.07.  On the other side, the Zs will be outputting 1 hit vs 1.04 evades.  There's other factors, like the maneuverability of the ties vs the vulnerability to critical hits did they have, but I don't think it tips the balance any."
XWingTMG,3c11vl,bl1y,1 point,Fri Jul 3 21:00:33 2015 UTC,Attack dice are just stronger than defense dice. An attack reroll is stronger than a defense reroll.
XWingTMG,3c11vl,Baron_Munchausen,3,Sat Jul 4 19:19:20 2015 UTC,"Easily the Ties - even if they were just lined up and shooting at each other, the Ties are rolling three evade dice, and that's a huge difference.  Then the Ties have far better movement options, Howlrunner is the best support ship in the game, etc. etc.  Scum aren't really built to swarm, and the Imperials are - so it's not ""unfair"" to have the Ties being better here in this comparison, it's just a different set of strengths and weaknesses. Even the 7 Feedback Z-swarm isn't great against a Tie Swarm."
XWingTMG,3c11vl,JohnLucCarry91,3,Fri Jul 3 22:25:18 2015 UTC,"Ties are designed to win this sort of matchup. The Scum list is squandering a key advantage here; Illicit Upgrades. With access to stuff like Dead Man's Switch and Feedback Array, the Scum Z's will have a significant edge.  It's also important to note that this matchup illustrates how intrinsically better it is to be the one shooting and not the one trying to avoid being shot at."
XWingTMG,3c11vl,EdgeOfDreams,1 point,Sat Jul 4 06:45:34 2015 UTC,"My gut instinct says the TIE Fighters by a small margin. Red dice are just better than green dice, therefore a re-roll on red dice is just better than on green dice.  In an actual match, the big question is who dies first, Serrisu or Howlrunner? Since Serrisu doesn't apply his defensive buff to himself, the Howlrunner Swarm will probably overwhelm him and take him down early. Howl only has to last 1 round longer than Serrisu for the game to snowball in the TIE's favor.  Also, yes, Initiative will be HUGE in this match-up."
XWingTMG,3c11vl,mxzf,2,Fri Jul 3 20:23:45 2015 UTC,"Also remember that the TIEs have an extra green die.  Not only are red dice better, TIEs also have more green dice too.  The re-roll of a green die is pretty much exactly equivalent to a third green die in this situation (where you're typically seeing two red dice each attack).    So the TIEs are effectively up a red die (due to the reroll), even on green dice, up a tiny bit on dial, and down 1 HP.  Unless the Z95s roll a lot of crits and get Direct Hits, I feel like the TIEs have a substantial margin.    Also, the TIE list has room for a Stealth Device on Howlrunner.  That helps the survivability of a key component."
XWingTMG,3c11vl,VanderLegion,1 point,Fri Jul 3 21:16:46 2015 UTC,"Also, yes, Initiative will be HUGE in this match-up.   Only as far as movement if the TIES are able to barrel roll to get out of arcs when moving second.  As far as shooting goes they're al lthe same PS so they all get to fire even if they die before it's their turn."
XWingTMG,3c11vl,EdgeOfDreams,1 point,Fri Jul 3 22:36:02 2015 UTC,"If the Z's have initiative, they can potentially kill howlrunner before the TIEs get to shoot. That could be a deciding factor in the outcome."
XWingTMG,3c11vl,AffixBayonets,1 point,Fri Jul 3 22:46:20 2015 UTC,"I feel like this would be the deciding factor, if both howlrunner and serissu die in the opening couple of turns (likely as you would rightly label them a priority target), then I think 5 or 6 headhunters would beat 5 or 6 ties, eventually..."
XWingTMG,3c11vl,VanderLegion,2,Sat Jul 4 04:08:03 2015 UTC,"then I think 5 or 6 headhunters would beat 5 or 6 ties, eventually...   Why? The TIEs still have evades, barrel rolls, and a better dial."
XWingTMG,3c11vl,VanderLegion,2,Sat Jul 4 19:20:12 2015 UTC,I agree. Straight tie vs z95 id vote for the ties. ectra agi and more maneuverable
XWingTMG,3c11vl,Thopterthallid,1 point,Sat Jul 4 19:41:51 2015 UTC,Its an interesting question. RAW youre right. The simultaneous fire rule only aplies to ships that are the same PS staying on the board if theyre destroyed until they get to fire. I feel like the spirit of the rule should apply to ships with abilities that apply to friendly ships as well. Since the TIEs are technically firing at the same time as the Zs it would make sense that serrisu and howlrunners abilities should still applyfor that round even if theyre destroyed by the opponents swarm with initiative
XWingTMG,3c11vl,DangerFord,1 point,Sat Jul 4 19:37:02 2015 UTC,Evade dice are more fickle than attack dice.  Rerolling an attack die is like flipping a coin. Rerolling an evade dice is only a 3 in 8 chance of succeeding.
XWingTMG,3c11vl,rsixidor,0,Mon Jul 6 23:30:35 2015 UTC,"EDIT: so I mistook the z-95's Pilot skill rank for its attack dice, setting it at 3 instead of 2. I feel dumb as this completely negates my argument. Instead of deleting all b wrote just think of it as a hypothetical way of making a z swarm better than a tie swarm.   Everyone is voting on the tie swarm, but I wouldn't rule out the zed swarm.   If you consider that a reroll is like having an extra die, then Serissu's ability gives his swarm 3 dice rolls with a maximum of 2 evades possible while ties get 3 natural dice, but no way to modify them. They can also use evade tokens as their action. Ties definitely win in the defense department.   On the offensive side there's the idea that the z-95 swarm can target lock and reroll up to 3 natural attack dice for a potential of 3 hits. Ties, if they're at range 1, can use Howlrunner kind of like a target lock to reroll one die with a possibility of up to 2 hits. Take into consideration that a target lock will also stay if not used and we all know how devastating the next attack with be with a focus and target lock. Z-95 definitely wins in the offense department.   I don't know the math behind this, but it sounds to me like the z-95 will take more damage than the tie but will also deal out more damage. They have shields as well, which means that crits won't be going through the first couple hits."
XWingTMG,3c11vl,DangerFord,2,Sat Jul 4 15:45:02 2015 UTC,"It's not an extra die, though, because of range 1. Both squads actually want to close to 1 if possible because of greater damage chance. A TIE can still cancel an entire zeds attack if both get the best roll. The opposite is not true for the zed cancelling the TIE at range 1.  There is the possibility of 1 shoting TIEs at range 1. Initiative will be a big factor there. Technically the zeds can be one shot as well if there are crits."
XWingTMG,3c11vl,rsixidor,1 point,Sat Jul 4 18:30:11 2015 UTC,But if they're both at range one a z-95 would be throwing 4 dice instead of 3 from a tie. Target lock will make it even more effective.
XWingTMG,3c11vl,DangerFord,1 point,Sat Jul 4 19:35:04 2015 UTC,How does a zed go from 2 dice to 4 at range 1? They aren't xwings.
XWingTMG,3c11vl,rsixidor,2,Sat Jul 4 19:57:37 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry, I'm dumb. I was looking at the list builder and thought the PS skill was attack dice. Now that I realize they're both the same attack then ties are better."
XWingTMG,3c11vl,AffixBayonets,1 point,Sat Jul 4 20:06:40 2015 UTC,"Initiative will mean a lot in the fight, though. So PS does kind of matter."
XWingTMG,3c11vl,DangerFord,1 point,Sun Jul 5 00:32:05 2015 UTC,"while ties get 3 natural dice, but no way to modify them.   What about their own actions? Howly reduces the need for the TIEs to use focus on offense, so a fair number near her might keep that action for the defensive."

If you're just using the Decimator as a roadblock, you might be able to swap it out for a shuttle with Vader and a tactical jammer.

Howlrunner is not efficient enough to pay for its cost with 3 ties and your deci will probably be hanging out away from the ties because of the astreoids.   I would go with 4/5 ties and a deci.

Only faced one squad with B's all day, a BBBY control squad, and blasted it off the board in short order. Made top 4 on the day which was TOTALLY unexpected. Fat Han did me in (as he should, with that build). What I got out of it was that pretty much anything can be competitive if you like flying it enough to really practice with it.  With tweaks, I've run Chewie/Lando probably 20 something times.  I usually play a list at least 3 times before moving on."

XWingTMG,3bxqts,Elusive2000,2,Fri Jul 3 04:16:02 2015 UTC,"Most of my X-wing right now is coming from my weekly league, and each week I generally play a different list. That's what I do most of the time - play a list for 3-5 games, then try something new and exciting! I'll come back to it later of course but I like trying new things...  ...unless there's a big tournament coming up, in which case I play that list almost exclusively in the weeks leading up to it. Before Regionals, for example, I played my RAC+3TIE list probably 30 games over two-ish months, and it certainly paid off - flying a list for that long, you know all its ins and outs and strengths and weaknesses, and it pays off in a competitive setting.   Now, all those 30 games were played against similarly-minded players playing competitively and practicing for Regionals too, and I always try to switch it up in a casual setting!"
XWingTMG,3bxqts,acegard,2,Fri Jul 3 06:28:19 2015 UTC,"I've been known at the LGS to be the ""mad scientist."" I have my competitive lists, and my casual lists, depending on who I'm flying against and how they want to fly that day. Its more about creating a fun game than consistently stomping opponents.  I've found that flying the same list a million times makes the list REALLY boring to fly again. Flying ships in differing combinations lets you see really cool options and ideas for ships. Not necessarily formations, per se, but combo's and tricks you can pull that your opponent isn't expecting because he hasn't tried/seen that scenario before."

XWingTMG,3bvlhy,quinntessence23,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:38:04 2015 UTC,"yup. And I agree, it should work. I'm balancing out the statistics for those who see him just never die, I guess, because I only ever roll blanks on his green dice. Just like whenever I choose to trade shots instead of avoiding getting shot at at the cost of not getting a shot with Soontir. I've learned not to do that, because my luck literally never swings the way I was hoping it would, even if I save tokens.  I know it's statistically got to work sometime, but I have this fluke of anecdotal data on it. Sorry, I was trying to be clear about that with my comment."

XWingTMG,3bvlhy,EdgeOfDreams,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:50:13 2015 UTC,"Stealth Device gives you an extra defense die. That die has a 3/8ths chance of preventing a point of damage the first time you roll it. That's not great. If you have a focus token, though, you've got a 5/8ths chance of getting value out of it. Because Stealth Device only sticks around if it succeeds, having focus to improve your defense rolls has a multiplicative (not just linear) effect on the total number of times Stealth Device will probably save you before you take a hit."

XWingTMG,3bvlhy,T-Minus9,5,Thu Jul 2 16:29:56 2015 UTC,"Basically in tournament games, if the game goes to time, the winner is decided by how many points he still has on the field.  This means that if you lose two TIEs and get a Decimator down to 1 HP by the time the game time is up, the TIEs will lose, despite the fact that the TIEs player all-but killed the Decimator.  This is part of why the 2-3 ship meta is common right now, because losing a ship from a swarm hurts you more than taking some damage on a big ship."
XWingTMG,3bvlhy,Nerf551987,2,Thu Jul 2 16:44:15 2015 UTC,"TIE Swarms chew Decimators up.  It's the support that is the problem.    0 Evade w/ 12 Hull and 4 Shields vs 16 Attack Dice, re-rolling up to 7?  That = Dead Deci and a lot of points up in MoV.  TIE swarms should always be able to down the large base ships (BroBots being a difficult exception).  However, the mobile, high PS, arc-dodging flanker can often spell the death of the rest of the swarm."
XWingTMG,3bvlhy,X-factor103,3,Thu Jul 2 18:04:51 2015 UTC,"Correct, margin of victory. Assuming your competent, winning with a Tie Swarm is relatively easy  but the problem is you won't always be winning by a lot - which can hurt your chances at finishing top 8/16; depending on the number of people."
XWingTMG,3bvlhy,EdgeOfDreams,3,Thu Jul 2 16:45:07 2015 UTC,"Is it not on the Wiki? If so, it'd be a good thing to revise and include."

XWingTMG,3bvlhy,EdgeOfDreams,5,Thu Jul 2 19:05:50 2015 UTC,"Dial, stats, and pilot cards reference link, may need to scroll down  TIE Fighter   Faction: Imperial Releases: Core Set, Wave 1 Role: Jouster, Swarm, Blocker Point cost: 12 to 18 Base size: Small Stat line: 2 Attack, 3 Agility, 3 Hull, 0 Shields Action bar: Focus, Barrel Roll, Evade Maneuver options: 16 total, with 4 greens and 2 reds (k-turns) Default upgrade options: None!   Pilots:  (A * indicates a unique pilot. C indicates released in Core Set, W1 = wave 1)  Academy PilotC,W1 - PS 1, the ship by which all other ships are judged, literally. Cheap enough for a swarm of 8 with points to spare. Also excellent in the form of a ""mini-swarm"" of 3-4 supporting something else or as a single blocker to fill out a list.  Obsidian Squadron PilotC,W1 - PS 3 for only a single point more than the Academy Pilot, which is actually a pretty good deal. It makes you less vulnerable to the Predator EPT and ensures you shoot before any Ps 1 or 2 generics, which can make a difference considering how fragile TIE Fighters are. Pilot Skill can make or break a swarm versus swarm matchup.  Black Squadron PilotC,W1 - PS 4 and has an Elite Pilot Talent upgrade slot. The extra PS is ok, but the EPT is what really makes these interesting. For example, give a few of them Swarm Tactics and fly them alongside a leader  with Swarm Tactics and much higher PS. Suddenly, you've got a swarm that all shoots first.  * Winged GundarkW1 - PS 5, no EPT, can turn a hit into a crit at range 1. Not a terrible ability, but it's outclassed by more recent cards like Mangler Cannon and Calculation for crit generation. Probably sees the most use when people decide to put all 6 named TIE Fighter pilots on the board at the same time, which is actually a pretty respectable squad.  * Night BeastC - PS 5, no EPT, gets a focus when performing a green maneuver. Like Gundark's, this pilot ability is outclassed by more recent cards (action economy stuff like Push The Limit, for example). If the TIE Fighter had more green maneuvers, and Night Beast had an EPT slot, you'd see this pilot used a lot more.  * Dark CurseC - PS 6, no EPT, attackers can't spend focus or reroll attacks when shooting her. Suddenly, the fragile TIE Fighter becomes quite difficult to kill when in the hands of this skilled pilot. Make sure Dark Curse saves a Focus token for defense whenever possible, and she'll last a surprisingly long time. Probably one of the best list fillers in the game for when you don't know what to do with your last 16-20 points.  * BackstabberW1 - PS 6, no EPT, gets an extra attack die when outside his target's firing arc. Here's a Fighter pilot who really wishes he was in an Interceptor. Still, against turrets or with good flanking maneuvers, a stab or two in the back can get the job done.  * Mauler MithelC - PS 7, has an EPT slot, gets an extra attack die at range 1. If Dark Curse is the most defensive pilot on this list, Mauler Mithel is her opposite, the most directly offense-oriented TIE Fighter. The EPT slot, higher PS, and an easier condition for triggering his pilot ability usually gives this guy a significant edge over Backstabber, for only a point more.  * HowlrunnerW1 - PS 8, has an EPT slot, grants an attack die reroll to all friendly ships in range 1 except herself. This is the pilot that makes TIE Fighter swarms truly something to be feared. Keep her supplied with Focus or Evade tokens to stay alive and somewhere in the center/back of your squadron for maximum benefit. The Swarm Tactics EPT upgrade is a natural fit, but there are plenty of other options depending on who else you're flying her with."

XWingTMG,3bvlhy,MrCompletely,4,Fri Jul 3 12:52:22 2015 UTC,"TIE Fighters are incredibly versatile. While the stats make them top-notch in terms of efficiency (mainly because they're so cheap), their maneuverability makes them excel. TIE Swarms (7-8 TIEs) were very popular up to wave 4 because they had brutal efficiency (paired with Howlrunner), they would engage head-on, and afterwards pick off the stragglers using their maneuverability.   I've run a swarm build at tournaments up until wave5 (including), I stopped just before wave 6 hit. I've written a guide on my last build here. It was a modified swarm, a bit unorthodox. I basically gave up using the list because of MoV. While few builds could genuinely scare me (double named Phantom was the only one, with original decloak rules), I did rather badly at swiss tournaments because of my inability to kill everything my opponent had on the board. And if I did, in many games I would lose ships. You might not think much of 2-3 Ties per game, but it adds up quickly and having no top cut at tournaments means that just 1 loss results in you getting 4th 5th etc.   MoV is still working against swarms of TIE Fighters, but now there are more ships in the current builds, so there is less risk of being out-MoV-ed. I might consider taking a swarm in wave 6, apart from one major problem.   The problem that I see now with TIE Fighters is the lack of shields and very little HP. This definitely mattered before, but now the mangler cannon is here, and it hurts TIEs very badly. Soon, Vader with ATC will be here. A lot of crits being thrown around, much more than in previous waves."
XWingTMG,3bvlhy,beer_demon,3,Thu Jul 2 20:26:50 2015 UTC,"It might be interesting to some of the newer players to see some of the history of the tie swarm, seeing as it is still a monster of a list in the right hands years after the game came out.    Things like the evolution from the 3x2 to the 2v3 stack to keep howl at range in the first engagement into the drunken shark deployment and the double pin wheel flying style popular now."
XWingTMG,3bvlhy,starslinger72,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:22:10 2015 UTC,Yes please
XWingTMG,3bvlhy,beer_demon,3,Fri Jul 3 15:00:17 2015 UTC,"As someone flying swarms again recently I find that they are hard to fly, but very effective if done well.    The main advantage is cost, so you can have many, lose several of them and you still have an effective force remaining. By flying in numbers, you can easily strip off evade and focus tokens with the first shots and then the last ones are more dangerous for the opponent. Also, no matter how well your opponent uses their HLC, phantoms, rerolls, etc. one ship cannot take out more than one TIE at a time.  Of course the exception are the advanced assault missiles (damage in a radius) and some bombs, but when you know you wil be facing those you can change your tactic. Of course, swarms are only a large threat when led by Howlrunner, so she has to be protected, and the opponent can use this to disrupt your flying.  Asteroids are also a threat. If your opponent is smart they can force you to make tough decisions several times at the beginning of the battle and this increases your chances of making a mistake, specially with a swarm.  In those cases it's best to charge them quick before they can comfortable do this, it's tempting to fly the swarm slow.    Finally, a lonely TIE F is easy to underestimate and when up close those 3 dice with a focus are as good as any xwing shot at range 2, and if the opponent forgets that they can pay expensively, specially in tournaments where it's not attractive to focus one ship in taking out 12 points.  I have used scattered TIE F to give my opponent a headache.    I am not that good with swarms, I usually fly 5 tie fighters and a sigma phantom or some other heavy hitter, to stress my opponent more, my pure swarms have not won too many matches but they are fun :-)"
XWingTMG,3bvlhy,Suicidal_Ferret,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:26:29 2015 UTC,the 8 tie swarm without howl is still very deadly under the right hands.  That is a ton of bodies to block with!

Keep in mind that I've only flown against tie swarms so all my knowledge is based on that...which might be a good perspective to have for these strategy guide posts.   The typical Howlrunner build can be very effective if you can keep her alive long enough, but it also paints a big red target on her. Once she's gone it's a pretty basic mop up with the rest of the swarm. Keep Howlrunner alive no matter what, even if you have to sacrifice another ship.   Asteroid placement should be spread out so it's not too difficult to maintain formation. Again, I'm not well versed in ties, but if the asteroid field is tight then it might be a good idea to split into two mini swarms that are somewhat close to each other, but more maneuverable through the asteroid field. Also, depending on the placement it might be a good idea to charge fast so your swarm is leaving the asteroid field and turning around while the opponent is entering it. That way there's not a big traffic jam that breaks up formation and divides your shots up.   That brings me to my last bit of knowledge. You have got to be a freaking ACE to fly swarms. If you're constantly bumping yourself and landing on rocks because you can't fit your formation through then you're in for a bad day. You'll get rid of your action economy and without tokens tie fighters drop like flies. Howlrunner helps a little, but only offensively. While it may be a bit tasking on the brain to fly a 2 ship lists with tons of upgrades on it I feel like a tie swarm is a much worse headache."

Really, my biggest issue with PtL+K4 is that the Firespray's greens are the suck, and so I'd really like engine too to get more maneuverability out of Dat ass when I have to take a green.

XWingTMG,3bxix6,mxzf,1 point,Fri Jul 3 00:11:34 2015 UTC,"I'm betting that the B and Y will get taken out fairly early on due to being easy to hit and make damage stick on.  Gemmer and Fel will probably be the last pilots standing, but I think Fel still has the edge due to having PTL and being able to boost and barrel roll as needed (and still have a focus too)."

XWingTMG,3bxix6,AffixBayonets,1 point,Fri Jul 3 14:45:27 2015 UTC,That's very true.  But you have to chose between trying to take Fel down and softening up the rest of the competition so that you can take them out once he's dead.    I'm also used to playing a deathmatch variant of this where you get points for hits and you respawn if you die.  In that situation Fel is NEVER the thing to go for because he's hard to score points on and he'll just respawn anyways.
XWingTMG,3bxix6,mxzf,1 point,Fri Jul 3 14:49:52 2015 UTC,"In that situation Fel is NEVER the thing to go for because he's hard to score points on and he'll just respawn anyways.   Yeah, and that's why that's a bad format IMO! I think you'd score the best by preying on X Wings then. Fel would be even more dominant as if anything starts looking too hairy he can fly off into the distance and few would really want to follow him or shoot.   I've tried a similar format where you have to pull a different list every time. So then you've got Fel but once he's out he's out."

Ultimately, I think its going to come down to how your group wants to run the league. I think $5-10 per month would be reasonable if people want prize support. From there, I like the idea of people picking what they want from the kits in rank order. If people 1 through 4 really only wanted the alt art PtL's but weren't interested in Tycho's or Dice bags, they could take that instead, and newer players could have access to ""upper level"" bling like dice bags, range rulers, or deck boxes.  How you decide to set up rankings is completely up to you, but that is where I would personally start. Since it is a casual-ish league, it is going to depend heavily on what your local group thinks are the right choices"

Also, the roll die for attack is not correct. Lt. Bluont will always have a hit on the defender even if he rolls no dice during the attack."
XWingTMG,3buk1w,eunoiared,2,Fri Jul 3 00:21:22 2015 UTC,"I have a weird question, what allows you to justify that the most failed roll is always the stealth device roll? If you evade a single hit while rolling with stealth device, potentially that evade is given from the device and it had still mitigated a point of damage. I need clarification if my line of thought is invalid but currently this is how I value stealth.   Edit: the grammers"
XWingTMG,3buk1w,-SeizureSalad-,1 point,Thu Jul 2 13:38:58 2015 UTC,He's not saying that the stealth device roll fails more often.   He's just taking n dice rolls and evaluating it as (n-1) + 1 rolls.  And only looking at the +1 roll when it's outcome makes a difference.   If the dice that saved you is the actual one added by the SD then you are in case 2. If it s some other dice then you are in case 1.
XWingTMG,3buk1w,Studsmurf,2,Thu Jul 2 14:35:55 2015 UTC,"I don't think you understand my statement. In this assessment he is always looking to the worst die roll in the set of dice rolled, and making that die the extra from stealth device. That is not correct. Unless your are actually rolling a separate die from the rest of your defence dice to represent the SD extra die you cannot assume that the worst die is the SD die. If you have three agility naturally and a SD , you roll your defence. If you roll at least one evade that potentially was from the SD bonus. SD doesn't only return value if it helps you mitigate a whole attack. If it stops one hit, which if you roll at least one evade in your defensive roll could potentially be that bonus die it had paid for it self just as much as a hull upgrade."
XWingTMG,3buk1w,-SeizureSalad-,2,Thu Jul 2 15:53:29 2015 UTC,"You're misinterpreting me. I don't automatically look at the worst die. I look automatically at the last die rolled. The first three dice could be all blanks or all evades or any mix, and I'd still treat the 4th die as the one from Stealth Device.  Secondly, I do account for the fact that SD provides value any time it mitigates damage, regardless of whether the whole attack was stopped or not. That's what ""Case 3"" is all about.  The difficulty is that we can't know how often Case 2 will happen versus Case 3. That's why I did all my initial math on Case 2, to provide an analysis of the best case scenario. The numbers produced (0.6 and 1.66...) are upper bounds on how good Stealth Device can be. In a real game, it will usually perform worse than those numbers indicate."
XWingTMG,3buk1w,bl1y,2,Thu Jul 2 16:53:20 2015 UTC,"I've been working on figuring this out as well, and here's the conclusion I reached:  Stealth Device is good if you can modify your defense dice. Focus, Evade, Autothrusters, and Lone Wolf all help SD earn its keep. It becomes less useful when there are more enemies on the table, and more useful when facing just 1-2 (so your tokens aren't depleted).  But, the meta will play a very big role here. Triple Action Dash or anyone else who can reliably deal 4 hits has a 13% chance to land a hit, even if you've got 4 greens, Focus, Evade, AT. Brobots are very deadly because of 88B's reroll, lack of range bonus from secondary weapons, and you're always in arc (can still get AT from range 3, but you're not also getting a bonus die). Vader absolutely wrecks you. Vader and Gunner on a Decimator can kill Soontir in a single round.  So, depending on what you think others will be fielding -- specifically, if they're fielding Soontir killers -- Shield Upgrade can be much better. Really shuts down Vader, which I think is the biggest threat."
XWingTMG,3buk1w,KTreu42,2,Thu Jul 2 17:07:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that all agrees with my analysis. My main goal was to provide a baseline for how to evaluate SD when you don't know what you'll be up against. If you have information about the meta, you can always make more informed decisions."
XWingTMG,3buk1w,KTreu42,2,Thu Jul 2 17:14:10 2015 UTC,"Lovely stuff. I've always been skeptical of stealth devices because it's as fickle as a single green die roll, and there's danger of auto-hit attacks on top of that. I've been a strong proponent for hull upgrades instead, in the majority of cases. I would take Stealth on Soontir, stacked Aggressors, or maybe Scum Boba with Rec Spec and PTL (for evades)."
XWingTMG,3buk1w,KTreu42,2,Thu Jul 2 18:13:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah, there's only a few pilots that can really make Stealth Device shine. People like to try to throw them on A-Wings or Defenders, for example, but neither has defensive tokens often enough to beat the odds and do better than a Hull Upgrade."
XWingTMG,3buk1w,1_73,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:16:41 2015 UTC,"I can see A-Wings being okay, particularly Gemmer, but they are already expensive and fragile. Personally I'd stick with EPTs and maybe a thruster. But yeah, it's hard to make SD worthwhile."

XWingTMG,3bvthw,Neuvost,3,Thu Jul 2 23:40:46 2015 UTC,Great thank you! I will definitely be checking that out.
XWingTMG,3bvthw,X-factor103,2,Sun Jul 5 21:28:26 2015 UTC,"I know The Compleat Strategist in Manhattan runs tournament events. If you're looking for something more casual, like weekly meetups, I'd suggest checking Meetup or Facebook.   Any actual NYC players are welcome to chime in and tell me how misinformed I am. I'm from a bit upstate in NY, but come down to the city now and then (though never for x-wing)."

XWingTMG,3bvthw,boredompwndu,2,Thu Jul 2 23:42:50 2015 UTC,"In the Bloomington area, your probably looking for the Game Preserve for some X-wing. Most of the game preserves I've been to (They are a bit of a chain) have an X-wing league of some sort.

XWingTMG,3bv726,leewardstyle,2,Thu Jul 2 12:31:29 2015 UTC,"My concern would be that at PS1, your pirates will struggle to get target locks to fire their missiles, it might be worth dropping the feedback arrays to bump them to black sun soldiers, that way you can at least be sure of TLing Blues, bandits etc."
XWingTMG,3bv726,Jimbobjeff,1 point,Thu Jul 2 13:54:33 2015 UTC,Excellent point. Im fearful of high PS arc-dodging (Feedback Zapper) so much that 1 -to- 3 PS isn't much traction.
XWingTMG,3bv726,Jimbobjeff,1 point,Thu Jul 2 14:24:32 2015 UTC,"1-3 is huge, it puts you ahead of pretty much all the spammable swarm ships. I wouldn't worry too much about arc dodgers, you have enough ships that you can always spread out to cover more board with your arcs. I haven't run the numbers but I'm pretty sure if you can get a couple of the missiles on soontir he'll crumble."
XWingTMG,3bv726,Jimbobjeff,1 point,Thu Jul 2 14:33:04 2015 UTC,"Can't deny 1-3 being important. And also less Predator-cheese to worry about. Certainly can't get them all to PS3, so there's another problem, unless I drop Ordnance. Yikes. As for Soontir, FeedbackArray is infinitely better than PS 3."
XWingTMG,3bv726,Jimbobjeff,1 point,Thu Jul 2 14:38:20 2015 UTC,Dropping the feedbacks allows you to get all your missile carriers to PS3 which is the important thing imho.   I absolutely agree that the feedbacks are better vs soontir and frankly any of the 2 ship lists that are popular at the moment. It's things like 4bz or 5 cartel marauder squads where the PS 3 really shines. It'll also come in handy vs the tempest squadron pilots that I suspect may become popular if the raider ever drops.
XWingTMG,3bv726,VanderLegion,1 point,Thu Jul 2 14:45:42 2015 UTC,"Good advice. Too bad we can't sideboard in XW:TMG. LOL. Something else entered my mind during our convo... People will need to decide when/where to pop Glitterstim. If we only view it as OFFENSIVE, sure, we're not going to have our locks lined up.

I need to make better bases though because gluing some sheet metal to the cardboard asteroids doesn't work very well.   What did you make the actual rocks out off?  I found some light volcanic rock but it's a little bit top heavy.

XWingTMG,3bvdc1,Chilligan,1 point,Thu Jul 2 14:42:27 2015 UTC,Its pretty standard super friends style stuff that rebels have been doing sense wave 1.  Garven + dutch to get double TL + focus shots for your other ships.  Kyle handing out focus and Cracken handing out extra actions.  God have mercy on your soul if you run into a well flown Jax + Kagi combo...
XWingTMG,3bvdc1,starslinger72,1 point,Thu Jul 2 14:45:09 2015 UTC,"Interesting.  Garven attacks and passes a focus to Esege which he can use on his own defense.  If Garven doesn't have a focus, he can use one Esege has and pass it back to him."

XWingTMG,3btsux,BorisIHateReddit,4,Thu Jul 2 03:35:06 2015 UTC,I liked the way the TIE Fighters played more than the X-Wing. I liked the white 1-turn and the barrel roll action. Love at first roll.
XWingTMG,3btsux,Ghetto_Jawa,4,Thu Jul 2 06:20:08 2015 UTC,Only collecting ONE faction? Wait... you can do that?
XWingTMG,3btsux,boredompwndu,3,Thu Jul 2 10:37:12 2015 UTC,"It really came down to playstyle for me. I've slowly come to learn that I like to be the bad guy, so I fly scum. Scum are jerks, usually to other people. Rebels tend to help eachother out, and imperials inconvenience you, but scum and villainy steals from you.  As time progresses, you'll find you'll want cards from not your own faction. Goodness knows I've bought a Tie Advanced almost exclusively for expert handling.  Some people like to be the good guys, or the bad guys, and both are perfectly good reasons. There really isn't a bad choice, and that is really what matters most.  But all joking aside, go Imperials, they have cooler big ships"
XWingTMG,3btsux,Theepum7,2,Thu Jul 2 02:48:15 2015 UTC,"I chose the dark side, because my friend decided to play the rebels.  I would have chosen to play the empire anyways... Play a few games and see how you like the feel of the ships.  This is how it starts, then like me, you will own at least one of everything"
XWingTMG,3btsux,violetmythmaker,1 point,Thu Jul 2 04:25:01 2015 UTC,"I ended up going Rebels because their small ships seemed a bit tankier at the time, it was the first faction I played (a friend put together a Biggs/Keyan/Wedge list for me when I was learning), and I just like their pilot abilities a bit more overall  There's still other stuff that I'd like to try (mostly Imperial; loving the idea of the TIE Advanced pilots and upgrades in the Raider pack), but I think I'll be mostly Rebels for a while."
XWingTMG,3btsux,VanderLegion,1 point,Thu Jul 2 02:53:36 2015 UTC,I played mainly imperial originally.  I just like the ships and the playstyle better.  I always have a hard time putting together rebel lists that I think would be fun and/or good.  Imperial I've built a bunch.  I jumped into scum with both feet as soon as it released though.  I absolutely love the starviper and the warthog Ys.  And I can't wait for wave 7.
XWingTMG,3btsux,WhiskeyReckless,1 point,Thu Jul 2 04:05:39 2015 UTC,Rebels are great at synergizing with each other and breaking the core mechanics of the game (in a fun way if you're playing them) they have the tankiest ships by far and some of the most interesting combos. They are by far the most popular in my area.  Imps are great at swarming and arc dodging. They have a little less room for customization and tend to be very fragile. But they are a very high risk high reward play style and started off as my main faction.  Scum is coming into its own as a very interesting mix of the two. Their Hawk pilots can make for some very interesting builds and if you like boba fetts firespray they are the faction for you. Dual ig-88s is also a very strong build that can combine the action economy of some rebels and the arc dodging maneuver dial of an imp ship.  With the upcoming Wave 7 release and tie advanced fix with the Raider my opinion might change but for beginners I usually suggest Rebels.
XWingTMG,3btsux,LiquidAether,1 point,Thu Jul 2 04:16:26 2015 UTC,"I play everything, migrating around depending on what sort of list I wish to play.  In the beginning I overbought a lot of stuff due to the lack of variety, but now I find that buying two of each expansion gives you nearly all the upgrades you need and and the ships for just about any list (unless you want to do something crazy like 8 TIEs) and from there you can add a third or fourth ship as needed.  Unfortunately this is hard to do for new players, both because of the cost and because not all expansions may be available at any given time.  Once you get caught up though, two ships per wave is pretty manageable."
XWingTMG,3btsux,RennFoxx,1 point,Thu Jul 2 04:51:32 2015 UTC,"Because the Imperials and the Pirates are filthy nerfherders  (Kidding, May the Force be with you)  Going off that, the Rebels have a wide array of unique ships that can make a bunch of lists that all play differently."
XWingTMG,3btsux,eunoiared,1 point,Thu Jul 2 06:31:43 2015 UTC,"From the beginning I know I have to split the cost of the game with my brother, who's the first opponent I have for this game. Its very easy for us to decide the faction: him Imperial, me Rebel. It has always been our preference in the Star Wars anyway.   I get into the lawless Scum & Villainy since lots of their ships shares with the rebel."

XWingTMG,3btsux,X-factor103,1 point,Thu Jul 2 10:23:12 2015 UTC,"For me the choice was easy. There's no local meta around me, so I bought an equal amount of stuff for both sides (rebel and imperial).

XWingTMG,3btsux,CircleTheFire,1 point,Thu Jul 2 13:39:38 2015 UTC,The problem with staying with one faction is that there are upgrades in the other faction that you will want/need.

So there really was no other choice for my main.  I really love the nimbleness of the TIE series (aside from the bomber) as opposed to the bulkiness of Wings (w/ the exception of the A-Wing since I think it and the interceptor are 1:1 dial wise).

XWingTMG,3bthhn,KennethSnow,1 point,Fri Jul 3 04:12:20 2015 UTC,"Yes, my thought exactly as a list. But when playtesting this, it is hard to not lose palpetine in a few turns. The two interceptors are cool and everything, but the shuttle is a big liability. The interceptors have to be relatively fast with killing the threats, otherwise palpatine is gone before the show started."
XWingTMG,3bthhn,1_73,1 point,Sat Jul 4 21:05:59 2015 UTC,"OGP with Palp shouldn't be much more of a liability than an OGP with Vader, which seems some play.    Shuttles are difficult to use beyond that first pass, and with Vader you still need to be able to face the target to trigger him, with Palp you can just passively add that damage no matter where it is on the map."
XWingTMG,3bthhn,KennethSnow,1 point,Sun Jul 5 16:53:14 2015 UTC,"I know, but 1) Vader is only 3 points 2) Vader can deal crits by himself and does not need another ship to throw dice at an enemy ship you want to shoot at (like palpatine needs, to deal damage).   Don't get me wrong, I love palpatine, I am just a little bit worried that 29 points on a ship with 1 evade die and a big sign ""kill me fast, or regret it"" is too much."
XWingTMG,3bthhn,1_73,2,Sun Jul 5 17:00:30 2015 UTC,"Take mango off vessery. It is 4 points to remove their r3 green, and you dont use it at r1. Either chuck the HLC on him, or ride his natural 3 attack. You would be better off using the 4 points on cluster missiles on him (you spend your TL, then you gain a TL on BOTH attacks, so you get 2 attacks of 3 dice each with a TL) or upgrade alozen to someone else (if that is your preference).  Another option is to upgrade OGP to Yorr, which works REALLY well with a defender, so the defender can pull it's hard 1-turn without taking stress. IMO, if you let Yorr take the stress twice in 1 game (from either Vess or Alozen) then the focus action you can take on either of them is better than the crits you are losing from Mango.  EDIT:: Yorr also works on things like Rebel captive, debri, crits that give stress, flachette, e.c.t. The most prominant of these being rebel captive. You can shoot with your defender and let the lamba soak up the stress."

Also he may want Engine Upgrade instead of Stealth Device.  The shuttle wants an engine upgrade, but I'm unsure what to remove in order to free up points.

So than you either have to change stealth on soontir to Targeting Computer (not a good idea), or, change outmaneuver to lone wolf.

I can see him making a big difference in the first few rounds of shooting, though. Either keeping one ship per round alive when it would have otherwise died, or pushing through a crit on one of their most vulnerable ships to bring it down. I can see that sort of advantage snowballing really fast if it helps you get a 1 or 2 ship advantage early on."

XWingTMG,3br8ws,antigrapist,2,Wed Jul 1 19:13:16 2015 UTC,I'd suggest looking at the rules post from the previous tournament.   Games are untimed. You play your opponent until someone loses all their ships or concedes. You don't have to play all at once because you can always resume from a save file.
XWingTMG,3br8ws,Wolfgang52,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:26:46 2015 UTC,"There isn't...yet.  Most Vassal TO's will post their full rules with every tournament. A couple rules that are followed both in and out of tournaments:  1) The player who does not get initiative gets to choose which side to play from (usually left or right)  2) Flip over damage cards on the main screen    Games typically last less than 2 hours but can go as long as 3 depending on squad compositions. With the latest version, that time is usually on the shorter end."

XWingTMG,3brb4m,GreenArrow76,6,Wed Jul 1 14:54:49 2015 UTC,A very extensive buying guide was just made: http://www.reddit.com/r/XWingTMG/wiki/faq/buying  Welcome!
XWingTMG,3brb4m,PCGamerPirate,1 point,Wed Jul 1 15:02:12 2015 UTC,"The buying guide is very good. When I was getting serious about expanding my collection, I tried to buy in waves.   http://xwing-miniatures.wikia.com/wiki/X-Wing_Miniatures_Wiki  For a while, it seems the waves had a matchup theme going on. Wave 2 had both the Firespray and the Falcon. An iconic matchup. Wave 3 had heavy fighters and support ships for both sides. With Scum, the matchup scheme is a little off, since Scum are being caught up to the rest of the factions, but for the first 5 waves, I think buying from each wave in order is a great way to match up Empire versus Rebels as you buy."
XWingTMG,3brb4m,Chad_Nine,3,Wed Jul 1 22:22:37 2015 UTC,"Core x2: 54  Both Aces: 40  One large ship for each side: 40  8 small ships to taste (they're all good in some way or another TBH): 80  Then throw in two packs of mini sleeves for the damage deck/upgrades or storage or whatever else to round it out.   You can also buy into the Scum faction while you're at it too, which would be trading 4-5 of the 8 small ships for a Most Wanted set and one or two other ships in the faction."
XWingTMG,3brb4m,mxzf,2,Wed Jul 1 15:01:30 2015 UTC,"I'd say get a second core. You'll have plenty of dice, a nice swarm of TIES, and 2 sets of movement and range templates.  After that, you can't go wrong with 1 of pretty much any ship. TIE fighter is a must for TIE swarms. I also think a Phantom is amazing. Get the TIE interceptor for Soontir Fel, and if you like that ship, grab the Imperial Aces.   For rebels, the Falcon and YT-2400 make good ""big"" ships to balance things out. Or you can just get one or the other. Get the X-wing expansion as well (similar to getting the TIE fighter), to boost what you get out of the core sets. Then it's all personal taste. I love B and A-wings, and Rebel Aces makes a nice addition to each of those. An E-wing also goes really nicely next to a turret ship like the Falcon, if you're into that.  TL;DR 1x of just about any rebel ship gives you a nice mix-n-match for a variety of squads. Extra A wings or B wings usually make good companions if you want extra. Imperials are good with either the same, putting a few 1x named pilots together, or doing a TIE fighter swarm with one odd named pilot on the side (usually Soontir Fel [interceptor] or Whisper [phantom])."
XWingTMG,3brb4m,X-factor103,2,Wed Jul 1 15:02:05 2015 UTC,"You definitely need a TIE-Fighter Expack for the CARDS: [Howlrunner] and [Swarm Tactics].  You definitely need a TIE Phantom for CARDS: [Fire Control System], [Recon Specialist], and [Tactician]."

I would amazon some cheaper ships after you grab the big ones your boys like.   Go for one of everything then just start doubling up where you need to if you really get into it.
XWingTMG,3brb4m,mxzf,2,Wed Jul 1 15:01:46 2015 UTC,"If he's buying with store credit on CSI, it makes no sense to buy on Amazon, since CSI is cheaper and has free shipping if you're buying >$100 in stuff.    Amazon is nice for picking up one or two ships at a time for ~$13 each, but CSI has them for $10 and is worth it if you're buying a lot at once."

XWingTMG,3brb4m,RFarmer,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:37:57 2015 UTC,"CSI do not give me a bulk discount. What are you doing to get it? All I seem to get is their 20-30% regular discount, irregardless of order size.  To be honest though you can buy mostly anything and slap it on e-bay after. X-wing is free-to-play, core rules aside, if you spend a bit of time fiddling with e-bay. I try to BUY from ebay auctions but I keep losing them when the price exceeds the new Amazon/CSI/MM price and I therefore stop bidding."
XWingTMG,3brb4m,KTreu42,2,Wed Jul 1 18:55:00 2015 UTC,"There's a discount through free shipping for >$100 (which I consider 'bulk' purchase for something like X-Wing).  It's not a bulk discount like you'd get at Sam's Club or Costco, but it's an overall discount for buying a bunch of ships at the same time.  That's why I called it ""saving money buying stuff in bulk"" rather than actually saying it was a 'bulk discount'.  You're right though, you could always re-sell anything you buy and dislike, especially if you sell singleton cards people want."

The Tie fighter lacks a built in hyper drive. While the Xwing can jump into hyper space with impunity, the Tie fighter was dependent on carriers for faster than light movement.   Lastly in regards to the death star assault, it was a one in a million shot and a desperate last stand. It only succeeded because the empire vastly underestimated small fighters. Stated in the movie ""they don't consider any small one man fighters to be any threat (to the death star)"".  You don't need to out number some one in a strong hold to take it. That's based far more on out dated medieval castle sieges. A better analogy is the Dam Busters from WW2 if you want a historical reference. It was truly the real life trench run if they had to make the trench run in the pitch black."

XWingTMG,3bs22j,pie904,7,Wed Jul 1 18:11:07 2015 UTC,I think draw is a waste in this list. Fel should not be in range 1 of the fire spray. I still think you should be bidding at 99 points not 100. Honestly I'd drop Kath to krassis and give him a mangler cannon. That's more consistent damage and gives you a reroll on attack freeing up your action to evade or focus

XWingTMG,3bqm07,fl1p_problems,5,Wed Jul 1 10:30:19 2015 UTC,This has been faq'd. You have to roll defense dice for stealth to break meaning bombs and obstacle and oiquin and vader and any other damage dealer that doesn't require a defensive roll can't break stealth.
XWingTMG,3bqm07,skiduck,2,Wed Jul 1 12:01:04 2015 UTC,"If my Stealth Shuttle were taking fire from Wedge with Outmaneuver from the rear, I'd roll no dice.  Taking damage from this attack wouldn't knock out the Stealth Device?"
XWingTMG,3bqm07,mike_e_mcgee,6,Wed Jul 1 12:57:19 2015 UTC,"I don't think it works that way (it would be cool if it did though), because in that instance you do roll evade dice but the number of dice is 0, as opposed to not rolling dice to begin with."
XWingTMG,3bqm07,T-Minus9,3,Wed Jul 1 13:42:36 2015 UTC,"No, you would roll zero dice. Within the framework of the rules, there is a technical difference between ""rolling zero dice"" and ""not rolling dice."" In your example, if Wedge rolls just one hit with you rolling zero dice, you lose your Stealth Device."
XWingTMG,3bqm07,ragnarok-the-mic,2,Wed Jul 1 13:43:43 2015 UTC,"I should have just checked the FAQ:   Stealth Device A ship equipped with Stealth Device only discards Stealth Device if it defends against an attack and is hit. Damage suffered from other game effects (such as Seismic Charge, asteroids, Feedback Array, or damage received for being at Range 1 of a ship hit by Assault Missiles) does not cause a ship to discard Stealth Device."
XWingTMG,3bqm07,mxzf,5,Wed Jul 1 13:45:21 2015 UTC,"Also note that this means that any ship that Lt Blount fires at will lose the stealth device, regardless of if you do damage or not.  If you're looking for a way to strip stealth devices, he's the most reliable option, since anyone in-arc and in-range can be hit."
XWingTMG,3bqm07,Dakkon_B,2,Wed Jul 1 14:18:24 2015 UTC,I may be wrong but I don't think so. You have to actually preform an attack and hit to remove SD. (same thing when they hit and asteroid they take damage but its not an attack so they don't lose the SD)  Most bombs just say they suffer damage.

XWingTMG,3bn699,EdgeOfDreams,16,Tue Jun 30 15:50:52 2015 UTC,"Dial, stats, and pilot cards reference link  X-Wing   Faction: Rebel Releases: Core Set, Wave 1, Rebel Transport Role: Jouster Point cost: 21 to 29 Base size: Small Stat line: 3 Attack, 2 Agility, 3 Hull, 2 Shields Action bar: Focus, Target Lock Maneuver options: 15 total, with 4 greens and 1 red (k-turn) Default upgrade options: Torpedo, Astromech   Pilots:  (A * indicates a unique pilot. C indicates released in Core Set, W1 = wave 1, RT = Rebel Transport)  Rookie PilotC,W1,RT - PS 2, not a bad ship exactly, but for a point more you can have the more efficient B-Wing. Supplanted as a list filler by the cheaper A-Wing and Z-95.  * Tarn MisonRT - PS 3, one of the only pilots in the game that actually benefits from low PS and shooting near the end of the round. Combo with R7 Astromech (can spend Target Locks to reroll your opponent's attack dice) for a weirdly powerful defense.  Red Squadron PilotC,W1,RT - PS 4, same basic problems as the Rookie  * Hobbie KlivianRT - PS 5, has an interesting anti-stress mechanism, but suffers from lacking an EPT. With R2-D6 to get the slot for Push The Limit, Hobbie could Focus+TL every round and then clear the stress, but other pilots do the same type of strategy better (Keyan Farlander, for example).  * Biggs DarklighterC - PS 5, one of the best X-Wing pilots and once upon a time one of the top pilots in the game. His ability to draw attacks away from your other ships is huge, especially if you build and fly your list around keeping him alive-but-in-range while the rest of your squad goes more offensive. He's fallen in popularity, but he can still surprise an opponent who doesn't know how to deal with having his targeting choices made for him.  * Garven DreisW1 - PS 6, lets you give your focus to an ally after using it. Typical Rebel support ability that isn't very impressive alone, but can be fun in a list built to take advantage of it. Lack of an EPT slot hurts.  * Jek PorkinsRT - PS 7, can cancel stress, with a 3-in-8 chance of damaging himself each time he does. Would be much better if it weren't for the fact that the damage bypasses his own shields. Probably one of the funniest pilots to use, though, especially if you insist that ""I can hold it"" every time you roll for his ability.  * Luke SkywalkerC - PS 8, effectively has a permanent defensive focus token for only one die. Frustratingly hard to kill when paired with the canonically appropriate R2-D2 astromech to regen shields. He's iconic AND powerful.  * Wes JansonRT - PS 8, ability lets him strip tokens off his target after the attack. Yet again, not a huge deal by himself, but pair him up with one or more lower PS allies with Opportunist and you're on your way to putting a lot of hurt on whatever they all choose to target.   * Wedge AntillesW1 - The original PS 9. His ability to reduce his opponent's agility by 1 when shooting at them is deadly, especially against any ship relying on defensive upgrades that interact with green dice (Stealth Device, C-3P0, etc.). He'll be a priority target for your opponents, though, so you might want to pair him with defensive upgrades, support, or distractions such as Biggs.  (Feedback on this format and content is welcome. The goal here is not to comprehensively cover each pilot, just to give a quick introduction and food for thought.)"

XWingTMG,3bn699,Burius81,1 point,Wed Jul 1 02:32:35 2015 UTC,"I agree, this would be extremely useful for newcomers and people that are trying to fly ships that they aren't used to flying.

I noticed that /u/EdgeOfDreams mentioned some of those in his summaries, but maybe we could call those out more distinctly to help with list building.  Just my $0.02"
XWingTMG,3bn699,AffixBayonets,8,Wed Jul 1 12:45:16 2015 UTC,"I like the idea of this thread, I'm always interested in other peoples' opinions on different ships.  I haven't used the X-Wing in many games so take my observations with a grain of salt.  Numbers wise though, a Blue squadron B-Wing is only a point more for a lot more ship and Z-95s are way cheaper.  There are a lot of good named pilots though.  I have read that FFG made the X-Wing 21 points(Rookie Pilot) so that you couldn't get five of them in a 100 point squad.  Would that matter now?  If we got a Chardaan Refit style card for the torpedo slot on X-wings that shaved off one or two points would that be so game breaking?  What if we had a card that added a special action to X-Wings.  Title card or torpedo slot that gave them barrel roll, boost, or something completely new?  It's a shame we can't rejigger the maneuver dial, it seems like making them a bit more maneuverable (I'm thinking adding red hard 1s) could make them more viable."
XWingTMG,3bn699,aeromechanicalace,7,Tue Jun 30 17:10:07 2015 UTC,"Designed in Wave I, the X-Wing is starting to look a little long in the tooth. Not as efficient as a Z-95 and not as survivable as a B-Wing, the generic X-Wing has definitely fallen out of use.  A pretty balanced stat line and a slower but largely exhaustive dial makes the X-Wing a all around fighter and gives a strong-ish platform for some of the best named pilots in the game.  A strong X-Wing build usually features a named pilot with both a complementary elite pilot talent and corresponding astromech."
XWingTMG,3bn699,podsyboy121,9,Tue Jun 30 15:57:14 2015 UTC,"The generic X Wing pilots are, in the current meta, largely obsolete. They're far worse at taking a hit or close-range maneuvering than the similarly priced B Wing and have real trouble catching the similarly priced TIE Interceptor.   Some of the named pilots have neat abilities but you generally need to give them Engine Upgrade or something else to up their limited capacity to get their guns on target.   Bigg's ability has been used to draw fire from allies in the ""Biggs walks the dogs"" list but in my local meta that list has been replaced entirely with BBBBZ which performs the same role (rather slow but survivable multi-ship list) much better.  The X Wing also has a single torpedo slot, an upgrade option that has never been particularly useful.   Overall, I've been beaten with lists that have used X Wings but never because of them. Even without considering the B Wing, they've become uncommon as on the low points cost end the Z-95 is most of their value for a much lower cost and at the high end Corran Horn is seen far more than X Aces.  It's in a tough spot, and as the A Wing got Chaardan refit and the TIE Advanced is getting the title, the X probably needs a direct buff of its own."
XWingTMG,3bn699,ernesto__-,1 point,Tue Jun 30 16:29:26 2015 UTC,"I've had very good luck with generic x-wings, the trick is you don't run them solo. X-wings are VERY solid if buffed properly, but the generics NEED to be someone's wingman.   For example, I ran a rookie pilot alongside wedge with swarm tactics in my last game. 2 Skill 9 x-wings is a nasty amount of shooting."
XWingTMG,3bn699,AffixBayonets,6,Fri Jul 3 07:15:25 2015 UTC,Here's a favorite build of mine that often gets overlooked: Tarn Mison + R7 Astromech Tarn's ability allows him to acquire a target lock on an enemy ship when that ship declares him the target of an attack.  The R7 allows him to spend a target lock once per round to make the attacker re-roll his dice.  All for the low-low price of 25 points.
XWingTMG,3bn699,yodamann,6,Tue Jun 30 17:28:40 2015 UTC,"Lone Wolf Luke is nearly invincible against 2 attack ships, especially ones of lower pilot skill that struggle to get range 1 shots. Throw on a shield regeneration droid like R5-P9 or R2-D2 and you have a serious threat to swarm ships."
XWingTMG,3bn699,AffixBayonets,4,Tue Jun 30 17:44:26 2015 UTC,"You can no longer get away with running generic x-wings in competitive play. If you even choose to run X-Wings, they need to be an ace such as luke or wedge. Theres always the three amigos to consider, perhaps they arent as effective as they used to be, but they certainly are better than generics. X wings IMO, could use a little help in terms of maneuverability. Against ships like Tie Fighters or y wings they fare well, but against the ever so popular soontir, or the elusive Han/Dash, they just cant keep up. In order to make X wings more competitive, they need just a lil nudge, nothing insane like sharing all their abilities amongst themselves. However, I still think X-Wings hit hard enough to be a threat, 3 red dice and 2 green is pretty good when it comes to rebels, although e wings have 3-3. When used correctly X-Wings can be a larger threat than most people think. Like Wedge with opportunist running with Wes plus VI."
XWingTMG,3bn699,ivycoopwren,3,Tue Jun 30 17:10:13 2015 UTC,"they need just a lil nudge, nothing insane like sharing all their abilities amongst themselves.    I'd love to see them get a ""lock S Foils"" title that gave them a movement or agility boost, perhaps sacrificing shooting to do so. The generic X Wing can't compete against the B in jousting, so why not up its movement? It's supposed to be a relatively agile craft."
XWingTMG,3bn699,ernesto__-,3,Tue Jun 30 17:23:33 2015 UTC,Give them a title that is essentially engine upgrade. Either free or with a small negative cost.

XWingTMG,3bn699,X-factor103,3,Tue Jun 30 18:36:44 2015 UTC,"I like the idea.  A 0-cost title card called ""S-foils"".  Add the SLAM action to the action bar.  It lets the X-wing a little something specific to that ship, especially with the dial it has."
XWingTMG,3bn699,EdgeOfDreams,2,Tue Jun 30 19:11:29 2015 UTC,"I dunno about SLAM, its Sub Light Acceleration Motor, and the K-wing has it cuz its got some big ballsin engines. Maybe they could be able to preform a free boost using the 2 or 3 template?"
XWingTMG,3bn699,EdgeOfDreams,3,Tue Jun 30 22:37:35 2015 UTC,"What I really like about the X-Wing is the ability to recover shields with R2-D2 and R5-P9. When you factor that in, the stat line and the costs aren't too bad. Costs make a lot more sense when you're picking X-Wings for their pilots. Wes and Wedge are two of the best pilots in the game. Wes will be even better when Wave 7 hits and he start denying everyone their ordnance shots.  What I think really hurts the X-Wing is that they can be killed easily in a single round of shooting. I played 3X list for a pretty long while, and if an X-Wing managed to limp away from an engagement it was extremely deadly. Trouble is making sure it gets to do that. They would be pretty well served with either an Evade action or 3 green dice (but not both)."
XWingTMG,3bn699,phalanfy,3,Tue Jun 30 18:01:57 2015 UTC,"To be fair, while I'm aware of the X-wing's standing in the meta, I use it as my primary ship to teach new players the game. The fact that's it's not the best at anything because it's so middle-of-the-road makes it similarly a great as a teaching ship.  Maybe we could add some kind of recommendation that it's good for beginners due to having an uncomplicated but useful dial, decent survivability and attack power, and reasonable cost/upgrades/named pilots.  My first suggestion to new players is to take Luke with R2-D2, as that becomes quite hard to kill on a demo game where I'm usually running all basic TIES and Vader (sans upgrades)."
XWingTMG,3bn699,Dr_Lord_Platypus,1 point,Tue Jun 30 19:21:51 2015 UTC,"This is a great idea to gather people's thoughts and builds one ship at a time. How often do you plan to post these?  I'm going to try giving a quick bullet point summary of the ship's key features and what each pilot is known for. If people like it for the X-Wing, I'll try to keep it up for future ships."
XWingTMG,3bn699,blairbunke,3,Tue Jun 30 16:40:06 2015 UTC,I think every tuesday and thursday is probably good. Fill out the wiki pretty quickly.
XWingTMG,3bnz7j,MisterLamp,7,Tue Jun 30 19:13:31 2015 UTC,"There are two schools of thought for Brobots, symmetrical or asymmetrical.  Symmetrical builds are more common. They ensure that each ship flies exactly the same and has the same capabilities.  Asymmetrical builds gives different roles to each ship, making it a harder build to fly but can have very effective results.  The large base makes them susceptible to blocking and the low-ish PS combined with no native turret makes them susceptible to arc dodging.  IG-88B is pretty much required. Having a low ship count build means you need to be able to take quality shots.  A is largely unused because it doesn't have a lot of opportunities to trigger in the lower ship count meta. If ship count starts hitting 5+ again, he might be a good buy.  Your system slot will typically be filled with FCS or Advanced Sensors. There are edge cases for Sensor Jammer and maybe Accuracy Corrector.  That illicit slot should be put to good use. Feedback may seem like a good fit, but the cost for using it is typically too great. Inertial Dampeners or Hot Shot are typically best."
XWingTMG,3bnz7j,PCGamerPirate,1 point,Tue Jun 30 20:24:58 2015 UTC,I think feedback is actually one of the best options as it gives a solid answer to a well flown Squint.
XWingTMG,3bnz7j,starslinger72,2,Tue Jun 30 21:05:38 2015 UTC,"A good brobot player can either get 2 brobots in arc with the interceptor at least once in the game (and probably hurting it for the first time), or, get 1 brobot to bump the interceptor so the other can shoot at it tokenless, once in the game. Yes, interceptors are a major pain in the ass, but the feedback is too costly imho for such a singular use."
XWingTMG,3bnz7j,1_73,1 point,Wed Jul 1 04:30:27 2015 UTC,"Its for sure damage, which is very hard to come by in the game.  That should not be overlooked.  For the first use its also just trade HP for HP unless there is ion threat from the other list."
XWingTMG,3bnz7j,starslinger72,1 point,Wed Jul 1 04:39:31 2015 UTC,"I agree that it's for sure damage which is king in this game, but I also think the price you have to pay (2 squad points + 1/8th of your total hull) is too high. I'd rather put on inertial dampeners for 1 point and try to ""outfly"" the interceptor."
XWingTMG,3bnz7j,1_73,1 point,Wed Jul 1 04:42:58 2015 UTC,Big issue there being you are banking on you being able to out play skill a bad match up which will not always be something you can rely on.  Plus feedback puts that range 1 bubble around your IGs that a squint will not want to go into unless its on its last leg.  That protection is worth the squad points alone.
XWingTMG,3bnz7j,starslinger72,4,Wed Jul 1 04:45:54 2015 UTC,Autothrusters are too good to pass up on IG-88. They'll prevent more damage for fewer points spent than any other defensive modification.
XWingTMG,3bnz7j,EdgeOfDreams,2,Tue Jun 30 20:28:26 2015 UTC,"I've had a ton of fun with IG-88's. Personally I like running single aggressor with other stuff. Makes for some fun games if nothing else.  Brobots is a little strange in that they are basically the biggest arcdodgers you will ever own, but they prefer dodging arcs by going beyond range 3 instead of going beyond arc lines. If you know someone has a scary gun that is going to point at you, think about where they would want you to be, and go in the other direction.  3 things you have are huge benefits to you. 1) your absurdly green maneuver dial. 2) S-loops (options, they never expect a k-turn) and 3) boost on your action bar automatically  Brobots are a bit counterintuitive. They may have 3 green dice, but they only have 8 health. They rely heavily on being unpredictable. FCS seems like the ideal choice, but your going to be mentally locked onto hitting the target you have a lock on, and that makes you predictable. I have more fun with Advanced sensors, since you get actions before you move (or after. again, it isn't a requirement). Heck I've had fun with Enchanced scopes and anti-pursuit lasers. (Get in the way and wreak havoc without shooting)  I've heard it many ways on cannons. I like heavy laser cannons because of the damage output. Some people prefer manglers because crits. You have 2 slots, so you have some flexibility, but don't overspend.  Illicits are cool. I like inertial damners if anything, but they aren't amazing on Aggressors.  Popular elites include VI, PtL, and outmaneuver. Sometimes marksmanship.  IG-88A almost never makes the table, which is a shame, becuase she excels with swarms. B seems to be the go-to, because its a gunner for cannons. C is my personal favorite, because she becomes that much harder to kill. D adds flexibility to your S-loops.  I personally like B and C, but it really is going to depend on your playstyle. I mean hell, RAC Soontir seems to win tournaments consistently, but it sure doesn't have a singular winning list these days."
XWingTMG,3bnz7j,boredompwndu,1 point,Tue Jun 30 20:25:10 2015 UTC,"I have more fun with Advanced sensors, since you get actions before you move (or after. again, it isn't a requirement).   I'm the same, and it also makes you a lot less predictable. With the opportunity to action before maneuvering, you can be more reactive when it comes to other ship's movements, and also have a lot of fun with juking, e.g. if you put down a K-turn, you can choose to either Focus and K-turn, or combine a Boost with a K-Turn, drastically altering your end position and arc."

Do you go for C to take out the higher damage output? If you do, you'll be suffering crits the whole time. Do you go for B to stop the gunner effect?

Navigator lets you change it to a different maneuver of the same bearing.

XWingTMG,3bnb1d,IronicMollusk,2,Tue Jun 30 18:38:37 2015 UTC,"I am not sure. There is text on the SLAM rules card that further specifies ""Performing a SLAM counts as executing a maneuver."" If that text is what gives it the power to allow bombs to be dropped (or potential Navigator involvement), then I'd say Daredevil is unlikely to be affected, but I am just not sure.  Another reason I'd lean toward Daredevil not synergizing the same way is that you are not actually revealing a dial since the maneuver  is specified ahead of time.   It is mostly speculation at this point, unfortunately."

On page 3 in the section on bombs, it says ""A ship may only drop one bomb per round."" At first I held out hope that this would not apply to Proximity Mines, but earlier in the same section it says ""Some bombs, such as Proximity Mines..."", which leads me to believe that they are talking about all bombs including mines when they restrict a ship to only dropping 1 per round.

XWingTMG,3bpr2x,boredompwndu,5,Wed Jul 1 04:06:31 2015 UTC,"Not sure that it actually would be that great against 2 ship lists.  Sure, you have some control with the ion and the flechette, but there's some issues.  Flechette cannon only stresses a target that doesn't already have a stress token, so you can't double stress (which is what you're really after, especially against pilots like Soontir).  Add to that the fact that generally two-ship lists have at least one large base ship, which requires you to hit it with 2 ion tokens to ionize it and they usuually have turrets to be able to keep shooting at you.  And the damage output is going to be pathetic if you're using the cannons since they both only do 1 damage.  At that rate you'll be dead long before you kill much with only 2 ships doing 1 damage each per turn.  Edit:  Maybe if you rely on shooting mainly with your primary weapon and fall back to the ion or flechette for some damage/control potential with Bs ability when you miss your primary attack."
XWingTMG,3bpr2x,VanderLegion,1 point,Wed Jul 1 04:10:20 2015 UTC,"My idea was to be able to use either the main weapon or the control options. I'm not necessarily locked into using the cannons, but they give me options for control if at that moment they are what I need"

Control lists only work when you either have so many control weapons that you are definitely getting a shot in, or when it's an addition to a list that can already hit hard. 4 BTL Ion Ys are good for this because many guns and many hulls.  Also; once you lose IG-88B, you're going to be very weak.  Sorry :("

XWingTMG,3bpr2x,MysteriousRacer_X,1 point,Wed Jul 1 15:33:48 2015 UTC,"I think it could be a fun list, actually.  If I see a stressed ship, I will always fire the Ion cannon. You deny their movement and action (if nothing like Wingman in the mix) so that you've got a better chance of keeping them without actions on the following turns.  This is definitely a list where you want to keep the aggressors together, so that if one bot fails to ionize, the other can try it. If your target is ionized by the first shot, use the flechette from the second (if they aren't stressed).  And almost always use the cannons at range 3 to reduce opponent's defense dice and more consistently land a hit. Against 0-1 agility ships, consider just using the primary.  Now, the big issue is other large ships. I think in those matchups, you almost always go with the primary. Ionizing takes two shots, so I think if you do kick in to your IG-88B attacks, you use the flechette first on those, then the ion... or you go all in and use the ion first on both attacks. Lots of options, I guess."
XWingTMG,3bmv23,MrSunol,3,Tue Jun 30 14:28:01 2015 UTC,"For Horton, maybe R2-D6 is a good option. I'm not certain what the best EPT to take with the droid would be but I'm sure there's a good option.

Then another Y-Wing with the TLT, BTL and stressbot, and one more with just TLT.  Something like that, I might have had another ship in there.  I faced a swarm of 6 A-Wings.  Horton with Marksmanship and the Turret?  A deadly shot, with the natural re-rolls and Marksmanship it was basically 3 hits every single time the TLT fired.  I just used him to skirt the edge of the boards so the A-Wings would be forced to turn away or risk going off the edge of the board, or K-turn as they were too fast to stay behind Horton.  Horton never did more than 2 damage, but I think except for a single turn he also never failed to do LESS than 2 damage.  People weren't used to Y-wings having a range-3 turret, so there was always an A-Wing that had boosted or target locked instead of focused/evaded that was easy pickings.  I didn't win the match as it was a hastily slapped together list, but Horton was the last to go down, and he was pursued by 3 A-Wings the entire game."

A deadly shot, with the natural re-rolls and Marksmanship it was basically 3 hits every single time the TLT fired.   Why Marksmanship? The Twin Laser Turret cancels crit rolls. You're better off just using your focus normally and using a different Elite talent. Predator isn't a bad choice, and VI isn't either."
XWingTMG,3bmv23,AffixBayonets,3,Tue Jun 30 15:28:52 2015 UTC,"The TLT may not take advantage of the crits, but it does like a focus which can be spent twice, which is exactly what Marksmanship does. By going with Marksmanship action instead of a simple focus action, you get a focus on both of the TLT shots.   The TLT doesn't cancel crits, it just uses them like hits.   Predator is a terrible choice for the EPT because Horton's ability is a built in target lock."
XWingTMG,3bmv23,mattman676,1 point,Tue Jun 30 15:36:10 2015 UTC,"I suggested Predator because I assumed you'd use EU for your action and Predator to re-roll focus results that Horton can't touch, but that was actually a different post that suggested EU Horton so my bad."

XWingTMG,3bmv23,AffixBayonets,1 point,Tue Jun 30 15:40:53 2015 UTC,"focus is a token that is used once, marksmanship is consistent throughout a turn. So multiple shots get affected. It's a bloody good card."
XWingTMG,3bmv23,CyclopticBinLid,1 point,Tue Jun 30 15:43:52 2015 UTC,"But, you see: Predator is a redundant choice.  It allows you to reroll 1 die when attacking, but Horton's ability allows him to reroll all your blanks when attacking at range 2-3 anyways.  The turret is only range 2-3, so he's got a built in reroll on all turret attacks, so Predator is a waste.  You need something to convert focus->hits, not get more rerolls.  However, focus can only be used on one attack, and the turret attacks twice, leaving one unmodified.  Marksmanship applies for all attacks until the end of the round, so it will apply to both attacks from the turret, and also his primary if you take the BTL title.  Sure you don't apply the crits, but it gets you extreme accuracy."

I take EU on every Decimator I take, and I feel like it wouldn't be too hard to drive it straight into your group and start getting it within Range 1. The Decimator has no agility and kitted out with RAC has plenty of attack bonuses so it doesn't lose too much if it bumps a Y. I think you might be able to drop within the minimum range of at least one or two of them.   Still, it is a bit concerning for my Decimator and after Soontir they were my greatest concern. That Advanced/Defender list is looking better all the time because it gives you three green dice on every ship to cut down those incoming turret double-taps and the maneuverability to get close.   I'm not sure how many TLT Y lists we'll see, but they do seem meta-changing."

If the Ys are getting range 1 shots, they aren't limited to three damage instead of two and unless you've Isard, everyone of those hits is doing damage.  The Decimator still can only do 4 damage (before crits) and only to one ship. It will take a minimum of two turns on its own to take down one y-wing.  I still don't think the Decimator is long for this world in that situation."
XWingTMG,3bmv23,rsixidor,1 point,Tue Jun 30 15:06:10 2015 UTC,But you're comparing one 40-60 odd point Decimator with an entire squad.   With your backup (and a mini swarm probably works best here) you could nail one in the first round of fire ideally. Once those Ys are stressed its even easier to get within their min range.
XWingTMG,3bmv23,AffixBayonets,1 point,Tue Jun 30 15:12:00 2015 UTC,"I was thinking the most common RAC I've seen, which runs with Soontir. If Soontir is also range one of the Ys, then you might have one y-wing down in the first round of shooting and up to 9 damage on RAC, or possibly a dead Soontir if the Y's spread the arcs a bit instead of sticking together like a block.  Against RAC + Mini-Swarm, the matchup is way different. I'd feel less confident about them in that case.  However, that's one of the reasons I've actually considered running the TLT build without BTL-A4 and then spreading out sort of as a net."
XWingTMG,3bmv23,Thopterthallid,2,Tue Jun 30 15:15:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I thought about that too and if QTLT (quad twin laser turret) becomes common in tournaments then Soontir + RAC just won't be viable. Soontir, even with SD and AT, is going to have some bad rolls and those TLTs are excellent at getting multiple tries at the same target.

XWingTMG,3bmv23,HombreJirafa,1 point,Tue Jun 30 16:28:16 2015 UTC,"There's some question to whether or not you declare targets twice with TLT, which makes R3-A2 somewhat questionable.

They said that Cluster Missiles does not trigger the declare target step twice, so Tarn Mison would not get to re-acquire a target lock before the second attack.

XWingTMG,3bmv23,3rd_Charmer,3,Tue Jun 30 15:58:13 2015 UTC,They can with R2-D6! 1 point to give pilots above PS 2 an EPT if they don't already have one.
XWingTMG,3bmv23,AffixBayonets,4,Tue Jun 30 16:02:59 2015 UTC,Such a lousy trade off... sacrificing their astromech slot to gain what should be available naturally to Horton.  Just the worst.
XWingTMG,3bmv23,3rd_Charmer,2,Tue Jun 30 16:07:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah, EPTs were odd in the first few ships in that they were so rare. Now for new ships it's rare that a named pilot doesn't have an EPT. So of course it's the Y Wing that is one of the ships that got hit the hardest by that.   I get why there are no EPTs on the Shuttle though. Daredevil or Expert Handing plus Advanced Sensors would make it fly totally differently."
XWingTMG,3bmv23,3rd_Charmer,1 point,Tue Jun 30 16:14:07 2015 UTC,"And yet they have it on the Decimator, which is so bulky it has 0 agility, but could barrel roll or Daredevil with it's EPT.  FFG makes... interesting choices sometimes."
XWingTMG,3bo6op,mike_e_mcgee,6,Tue Jun 30 20:06:56 2015 UTC,"Every maneuver has three components:  1) Speed - the length of the maneuver   2) Difficulty - the color of the maneuver  3) Bearing - the direction and shape of the maneuver  Navigator does not allow you to change bearing, it allows you to change speed. Stay on target allows you to pick any maneuver of the same speed but forces you to change the difficulty to red. Combining the two lets you pick any maneuver but it will be red.  If you have a 3 speed right turn dialed in, you can use navigator to do a 2 speed right turn or a 1 speed right turn if those are on your dial."
XWingTMG,3bo6op,PCGamerPirate,1 point,Tue Jun 30 20:13:18 2015 UTC,"Combining the two lets you pick any maneuver but it will be red.   Not necessarily ANY maneuver.  The TIE Bomber for instance has a 5 speed k-turn, but no other 5 speed maneuvers and no other k-turns, meaning you can't change another maneuver TO the k-turn or from the k-turn to any other maneuver using navigator and/or stay on target.  Same with the full stop maneuver on the shuttle and hound's tooth."
XWingTMG,3bo6op,VanderLegion,3,Tue Jun 30 20:33:27 2015 UTC,"""Bearing"" refers to direction; ""Navigator"" allows you to change the speed of your maneuver, but NOT the direction (i.e., if your maneuver was a left bank, you would have to make a left bank, albeit at different speeds - and maintaining the red/stress ratio)."
XWingTMG,3bo6op,Berethrof,2,Tue Jun 30 20:16:31 2015 UTC,"The manual says there are 6 bearings, then shows pictures of straight, both banks, both turns, and k-turn. (Stops and S-loops didn't exist yet.) It's clear that each individual symbol is a separate bearing."

XWingTMG,3bnlgf,EdgeOfDreams,1 point,Tue Jun 30 18:26:20 2015 UTC,"That's sort of always a problem.  I think the best bet is to pair him with some other 'good targets' so it's not obvious that N'Dru is the primary target they aim for (he'll be out Lone Wolfing).  Even then, thankfully, 25 points isn't a whole lot."

XWingTMG,3bnlgf,EdgeOfDreams,1 point,Tue Jun 30 18:57:02 2015 UTC,I would hope that the Glitterstim + Lone Wolf on defense would help you get those 2 evades to keep you alive for the one volley.  Should hopefully get 1 at least..
XWingTMG,3bnlgf,VanderLegion,1 point,Tue Jun 30 19:35:25 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that definitely helps. The problem is if there's pilots on the table with higher PS than N'Dru, he might find himself in attack range but not have a target lock yet. He needs to potentially survive two rounds of fire to really guaranteed the big shot."
XWingTMG,3bnlgf,MrSunol,3,Tue Jun 30 19:42:28 2015 UTC,You could drop Lone Wolf for Deadeye.  They can't prevent you taking a focus.

XWingTMG,3bmtrc,driscoll42,1 point,Tue Jun 30 17:04:08 2015 UTC,"assuming you wanted everything and had nothing   This is the problem with Massdrop with X-wing stuff in general.  The price is ok if you're wanting literally everything in the bundle, but anything other than that and it's a bad deal compared to standard sellers."
XWingTMG,3bmtrc,mxzf,2,Tue Jun 30 17:22:27 2015 UTC,"103.99+ 10.99 shipping at the first price point, 94.99 + 10.99 for the second.  From the site if you don't have an account or want to sign in.   Note: This bundle comes with the Core game as well as the following expansions: X-Wing, Y-Wing, Millennium Falcon, Tie Advanced, Tie Interceptor, and Lambda-class Shuttle."
XWingTMG,3bmtrc,mxzf,2,Tue Jun 30 14:20:26 2015 UTC,"Once again, it's pretty much on par with MM/CSI prices.  I mean, it's nice and all, but it really isn't a great deal unless you were already planning on buying those exact ships and don't mind waiting a week or two.    I know it's a good deal compared to MSRP, but people don't compare stuff to MSRP because CSI/MM are cheaper if you are buying any large number of ships.    Also, note the horrible setup that they have in the demo picture.  The Lambda is on a turreted rebel base (most likely a YT-1300) and one TIE is on Biggs' base."

XWingTMG,3bmtrc,cobenheister,2,Tue Jun 30 17:23:45 2015 UTC,"Being from Canada, the Massdrop price with shipping is still around 50 bucks cheaper than Amazon. Not sure what MM/CSI is but if it's still cheaper there I think I should check it out."
XWingTMG,3bmtrc,mxzf,1 point,Tue Jun 30 18:20:15 2015 UTC,"Yeah, check CSI/MM.  I'm not sure what import prices are, but CSI/MM are pretty much flat 66% of MSRP with free shipping (inside the US at least) for >$100 orders.  Amazon's usually a bit above CSI/MM, though not as high as MSRP."

XWingTMG,3bnw3e,AffixBayonets,1 point,Tue Jun 30 18:52:38 2015 UTC,"Without too much experience in the game (so take this however you want) I'm going to say almost any build has viability. The more I learn about this game, the more it seems like people can make the weirdest stuff work with enough time and tinkering (and pilot skill).  That being said, it's my experience that a good, maneuverable ship makes strong backup to turrets due to having a ship that doesn't rely on a 360 arc. A-wings and Zs are good because they're fast and turn on a dime. They can be used for blocking as well as shots. A Y-wing by comparison seems a bit slow and hard to turn, meaning it's going to be harder to block with it, and autothrusters will give them similar trouble if you're using their 360 turrets instead of the fixed turret title.  Perhaps try the build out by running these guys a bit behind the big ship. Cause pincer attacks between the turret ship and the Ys? Or fly the Ys at right angles to the big ship, aiming to cause pain to anything that's trying to be slippery. Basically, don't try to fly them too tight to the big guy.  What does everyone think? Am I crazy?"
XWingTMG,3bnw3e,X-factor103,1 point,Tue Jun 30 19:31:31 2015 UTC,"A-Wings and Z's are also both a lot cheaper. The third ship is more valuable than the Y's upgrades, generally speaking."

That was the theory. The HLC turret and 2 evade dice mean that the Outrider can definitely trade shots with some larger ships. The Ys are there to ideally hang back and reduce autothruster-equipped arc dodgers from flanking or to alternately dogpile big enemies like the Falcon.
XWingTMG,3bnw3e,EdgeOfDreams,1 point,Tue Jun 30 20:49:12 2015 UTC,"Twin Laser Turret, which is coming up in Wave 7, is going to be a pretty big improvement to the Y-Wing's competitiveness. The 2-3 range on it means you can fly slow and keep your distance, more easily catching arc dodgers. It's also going to enable one ship making 3 attacks in the same round via the BTL-A4 title, which should be pretty nasty against almost anything that doesn't have both high agility and high hit points.  Unfortunately, at 25 points for Gold Squadron + TLT + R2 Astromech, you're looking at only 50 points for your big turret if you want a pair of Y-Wings as escort. If you want to switch up to a single named Y-Wing, Horton Salm is your man, thanks to free rerolls at range 2-3.  Maybe something like this, once Wave 7 is out? http://geordanr.github.io/xwing/?f=Rebel%20Alliance&d=v3!s!95:18,23,-1,74:14:3:;8:135,116,126,2,138:21:3:"
XWingTMG,3bnw3e,EdgeOfDreams,1 point,Tue Jun 30 19:52:25 2015 UTC,"Your list could work, but I'm definitely concerned that Salm's spent some time at the buffet and become as large a points investment as Corran Horn. I'm not sure whether he's competitive versus that option, but that's partially because I've never seen Ys used alone because of their somewhat ponderous dial."
XWingTMG,3bnw3e,Nomnomnicon,1 point,Tue Jun 30 20:47:01 2015 UTC,"Fair enough. You could always slim down both Salm and Dash a bit and squeeze in a Z.

It'll be a while before we really know how the Wave 7 meta will shake out and whether TLT Y-Wings are as good as the hype."
XWingTMG,3bnw3e,boredompwndu,1 point,Tue Jun 30 20:51:52 2015 UTC,Yeah. Salm as a satellite turret or three attack machine to supplement a fat turret is a concept that still needs to be tested but is very intriguing.

I have a guide on my blog to answer it. The idea is that, while it's advisable to get the ships you like, some of the cards you will need/want for those ships may come in other packs.   I am also of the opinion that the second Core Set is no longer relevant if you want to start playing as Rebels. As Empire it's fine if you want to build up those Tie Numbers, but you may just go up to 4 with the normal expansion pack. The extra dice and templates are nice as you stated, but the whole pack doesn't scream ""value"" as it once did."

Do you have any plans to do a similar article for Imperials and Scum, or to update it when Wave 7 comes out?  Fair point about the second Core Set.

XWingTMG,3bngtc,EdgeOfDreams,3,Tue Jun 30 18:00:19 2015 UTC,"Hey, I'm the guy who wrote the buying guide. I'm glad you found it helpful! You're right, though, that you're not really the target audience.  Since you're at the point where you've got at least one of almost everything, I'm actually not too sure what to recommend. The easiest thing to say is that you should just get more of whatever your favorite ships are, or your friends' favorites. Getting at least one Slave 1 and TIE Bomber would also be great, but I don't really have a clear idea of how hard those are for you to find.  Wave 7 and the Imperial Raider are coming up in the next couple of months (August release is heavily rumored). If you can set up a pre-order to get those ships as soon as they come out, that will add quite a bit to your fleet, especially the Raider for Epic games.  Since you're interested in Epic, you might look into getting two more Aggressors as well. Four aggressors kitted out with upgrades can easily break 200 points, and they'll all share all 4 pilot abilities. I have no idea if that's actually an effective list for Epic, but it sounds really fun to try to fly."

I also enjoy flying TIE swarms, I find they challenge my piloting/decision making abilities a bunch (""do I stay in formation, crossing the rock, to try to block; or break formation to avoid the rock"" type decisions). Since I only have 5 TIEs, I think I might get a couple more.   Not sure about a third core set for those, or the TIE expansions packs?

Yes dauntless gives the double tap, but it is far easier to hit with Daredevil than the straight maneuver, and mara or RC means you stress people, which limits where they can fly.   Also Daredevil and Dauntless both give you stress, and you cannot shed two a turn, which means the turn after you can do neither, and the turn after that you have to take a green. This makes for a one shot deal and then you get hammered whiel you lumber round.   I think Oiccun takes EITHER EU/Daredevil OR Dauntless/Intimidation/AntiPursuitLasers. In both cases i want either Mara Jade or Rebel Captive, and I think intelligence agent is interesting on the dauntless  variety as lets you put yourself ina  place for them to run into you and trigger the APL/Mara Jade / Determination.   Alternatively, take one of the Oiccuns with an Omicron Group Pilot with Darth Vade, and give one of the two gunner (on the DoomBoat it can proc darth twice)."

Have not yet lost against them using a Fat Han and 3Zs list.  The important part here is that you are a swarm and have expendable ships.  If it is C and B, they HATE losing their actions. and they need to be able to complete their maneuvers to get into arc.  With a swarm and a heavy hitter that is also a good arc dodger, you have a chance to lock them down.  Bump them to keep them from boosting (to get/escape arc and to get a free evade) and if they are HLC get in their one range to keep them from using their  ""gunner"" mechanic. Also, cycle your TIE fighters and try to prevent him from being able to focus targets with both bots.  You will lose TIE fighters, but I think your chance at winning is very high if you manage to do those things."

XWingTMG,3bnwsu,boredompwndu,2,Tue Jun 30 20:08:08 2015 UTC,"Disclaimer: I fly single aggressor lists, so I'm only half he man you want. The problem against aggressors is they move fast, and sometimes unpredicatbly. It is going to boil down to how quickly you can get whipser in range before we catch you. We're both going to be suffering from the same dice/modifications issue, so we alone are fairly equally matched. The academy ties might be enough to pull through for you, unless I keep switching Whsiper's target to keep screwing with your FCS. If I can push you around and know where you'll be, you won't survive both of us shooting at you."
XWingTMG,3bnwsu,ilikexwing,1 point,Tue Jun 30 20:34:44 2015 UTC,"This is extremely accurate.  And this is why using your swarm as bumpers/nuisances can go a long way for you.  If you can have TIE fighters in all the possible final locations for the bots, you can force them to go somewhere predictable or lose their actions. Brobots LOVE the 3 bank, whether it's the white green one or a Segnor's loop.  Getting in the way of that will annoy them.  Also, Brobots get stronger when they can put your main target in a cross fire, work on preventing that. Your swarm will allow you to do it, most of the time.  Do not forget that Inertial Dampeners are a thing.  They are a hell of a thing."

XWingTMG,3bllxj,IronicMollusk,3,Tue Jun 30 15:07:28 2015 UTC,"The 'skill' factor in this game is not only the bluffing aspect to selecting maneuvers according to where the other guy will be, but being able to judge where your going to land in relation to all the ships arcs, Without measuring, just guessing. take that away, and the game is more about dice rolls than awareness of how your ships move."

XWingTMG,3bllxj,Neuvost,1 point,Tue Jun 30 15:22:26 2015 UTC,"This is one of the most bizarre and difficult to follow rules in the X-Wing tourney FAQ. Technically, any mat the tournament organizer provides is legal, but players aren't allowed to bring their own mats unless it's the official FFG plain star-field playmat. In practice, of course, for a TO to have enough mats for her players to play on, she needs to ask players to bring their own. Also, since the official FFG playmats are a recent addition to market, many X-Wing players already own third-party mats, and reasonably want to continue using them.   This rule goes completely unenforced in New York. I'd recommend just getting whichever playmat you think is the coolest, and just not play with anyone weird enough to give you a hard time about it.   Edit: As was pointed out elsewhere, both mats are officially tourney legal, but my point still holds about third-party mats."

You can manually right-click on each image to open it in a new browser tab or save it to your hard drive. You could then use something like Paint or Photoshop to put the cards together.  Unfortunately, Fab's site uses seriously low-resolution versions of the card art, so they're pretty ugly and unreadable: http://x-wing.fabpsb.net/cards/en_Pilot_WedgeAntilles.png  Another alternative resource might be VASSAL. It has much higher resolution card images, but without any rules text. You could build up your squad with pilots and upgrade cards in an offline test game, then take a screenshot to use. The lack of rules text may bother you, though.  Fantasy Flight's website has nice high-resolution card images with full text, such as https://images-cdn.fantasyflightgames.com/filer_public/58/e6/58e6b3d6-26bd-4483-a5fe-f194c7d94ff5/ion-bombs.png  However, I have no idea how to go about actually finding all the cards you'd want, since the links are scattered throughout news articles and such."

Oicunn:   Daredevil Ysanne Isard Engine Upgrade Weapons Engineer   Vessery:   HLC Calculation   This comes in at 99 points. Early in the match, you have Oicunn use Weapons Engineer to get target locks on the two most dangerous enemy ships, but never spend them. That one action means Vessery will be getting free target locks on those two targets for the rest of the match. Vessery then uses his action to Focus most turns, giving him Locked, Focused HLC shots with the option to crit via Calculation.  It's not perfect, but it could be fun"

XWingTMG,3bipuw,phantom2052,8,Mon Jun 29 16:53:15 2015 UTC,The way twin laser turret works makes it look like you cannot triple stress with R3-A2 because there is only one declare target phase.  EDIT: There is only one declare target step for the twin laser turret.  /u/antigrapist asked about Tarn Mison and cluster missiles (below).
XWingTMG,3bipuw,PCGamerPirate,7,Mon Jun 29 16:21:57 2015 UTC,"I think (and hope) you're incorrect. The first step in making an attack is to declare a target. Even if you're forced to declare the same target, I think you still have to declare it, giving you another chance to use R3-A2. I don't see how you could go from step 1-6 on the first attack and then from 2-6 on the second.   In the FAQ for cluster missiles (which has the same ""perform this attack twice"" wording) it says:  Cluster Missiles is treated as two separate attacks against the same target.   Two attacks means you can declare your target again.  I emailed FFG and Frank Brooks said ""No. Since ""Cluster Missiles” requires both attacks to be against the same target, only during the first attack does the attacker do the “Declare Target” step."" :( (The question was about Tarn and cluster missiles because FFG doesn't answer rule questions about unreleased cards and they have the same wording)"

XWingTMG,3bipuw,EdgeOfDreams,13,Mon Jun 29 16:07:32 2015 UTC,"Because it fires twice, it has a few advantages. Your opponent might spend a focus or evade token to defend against the first shot, then be left open to the second shot. Also, abilities that can trigger once per attack get two chances to trigger, such as R3-A2 which would let you double-stress an opponent at the cost of double-stressing yourself.  There's also the fact that it's range 2-3, which no other turret upgrade has. This allows it to cover a much larger area than most other turret upgrades, since they're all range 1 or 1-2. There's also a specific Y-Wing pilot, Horton Salm, who gets free rerolls when attacking at range 2-3, but never had a suitable turret to do that with."
XWingTMG,3bipuw,AffixBayonets,6,Mon Jun 29 16:22:36 2015 UTC,"There's also a specific Y-Wing pilot, Horton Salm, who gets free rerolls when attacking at range 2-3, but never had a suitable turret to do that with.   Yeah, everyone forgets Salm as he doesn't work well with turrets and at range 3 his two attack dice aren't great even with rerolls.   Now, he can hit hard even at range 3 with the BTL title plus TLT."
XWingTMG,3bipuw,rsixidor,3,Mon Jun 29 16:29:18 2015 UTC,You don't necessarily even need the title.   Kavil can also be strong with this. 4 dice outside of arc two times could mean stealth devices aren't long for this world.
XWingTMG,3bipuw,AffixBayonets,2,Mon Jun 29 16:35:55 2015 UTC,"Kavil will be a beast, yeah! Give him that TLT and a R4 Agro and even Autothrusters-carriers could be sorely pressed to evade his attacks. At the very least Phantoms are in trouble."
XWingTMG,3bipuw,rsixidor,2,Mon Jun 29 16:43:16 2015 UTC,"I'd maybe go Predator. Both options are good.  Or PTL with R4, so you can focus, TL, and have TL on both attacks."
XWingTMG,3bipuw,AffixBayonets,2,Mon Jun 29 16:45:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah, good idea! There are a lot of great options to work with the TLT."
XWingTMG,3bipuw,Enervata,2,Mon Jun 29 16:47:07 2015 UTC,I'm actually more excited for HWK's.  A range 3 turret will help them out quite a bit.  Range 2 was difficult to get consistently with their maneuver dial.  I also like that I now have a damage option that doesn't require both Moldy Crow + Recon Spec to be useful.  (But they're still super useful if I run either or both of them.)
XWingTMG,3bipuw,sacimino40,1 point,Tue Jun 30 15:13:48 2015 UTC,"You cannot double stress with the TLT, you only ""declare your target"" one time. Unless of course youre using BTL Y."

XWingTMG,3bipuw,PCGamerPirate,2,Mon Jun 29 17:31:06 2015 UTC,It's really only devastating against low ship count builds.  All the aces that really care can out PS any R3-A2 Y-wing.

XWingTMG,3bipuw,rsixidor,1 point,Mon Jun 29 17:12:57 2015 UTC,"And on the K-wing, it still has 360 degree 3-attack! woo!"
XWingTMG,3bipuw,sacimino40,3,Mon Jun 29 19:49:34 2015 UTC,its range 2-3...
XWingTMG,3bipuw,Enervata,3,Mon Jun 29 16:15:43 2015 UTC,"As a Scum Y pilot (I love em) I can tell you the Y's are drooling over Twin Laser Turret.  Even with Unhinged, Y's have a difficult time maintaining an enemy in range 1-2.  Range 3 is much easier.  Also since I run ICT's all the time, I can tell you rolling 3 dice to land 1 damage is a very solid tactic against high agility / tokened opponents.  The first attack often burns off the token, the second pushes the damage through.  I could see a combination of ICT and Twin Lasers being very effective for Y's."
XWingTMG,3bipuw,VanderLegion,1 point,Mon Jun 29 17:34:00 2015 UTC,The biggest issue with TLT is that at 6 points you can't run 4 Thugs with TLT and R4 agromech :(.  Definitely looking forward to using TLT in some of my other lists using the BTL Ys though (might be able to fit it into my xizor's thugs list)
XWingTMG,3bipuw,Enervata,1 point,Mon Jun 29 17:59:45 2015 UTC,"I think they specifically priced them that way to prevent 4 Y's with TLT and R4's.  I think running:   2x Syndicate Thug, ICT, Unhinged, BTL-Y 2x Syndicate Thug, TLT, R4 Agromech   Will be overall more balanced.  But you can always just use Unhinged on all."
XWingTMG,3bipuw,VanderLegion,1 point,Mon Jun 29 21:30:24 2015 UTC,"Yah, haven't decided how I'd run it yet."
XWingTMG,3bipuw,mxzf,3,Mon Jun 29 21:50:54 2015 UTC,"The fact that you have two attacks with 3 dice each.  More attacks means more chances to push damage through.  Not to mention the ability for Miranda to turn it into one 2-die attack and one 3-die attack and a shield.    It's not amazing, but it's good at forcing your opponent to burn through evade/focus tokens to keep from being hit.  There's less possible good (no triple-crits), but also more chance of making some damage stick against evasive targets, since you're rolling a lot of dice and only need to get one hit through on each attack."
XWingTMG,3bipuw,VanderLegion,3,Mon Jun 29 16:24:44 2015 UTC,"It's good for BTL y-wings.  Right now, most of the time they use the ion turret, which only does 1 damage (and ion of course) while limited to range 1-2.  You can choose to use the TLT instead and get range 2-3 and 2 attacks that each do one damage for more overall potential damage output as long as you don't mind losing the ion effect."
XWingTMG,3bipuw,CyclopticBinLid,0,Mon Jun 29 16:46:54 2015 UTC,"I agree completely. When people were trying to read the cards in the initial preview people were going nuts over this turret. But I don't really see the big deal. It'll be good for the pilot who regens shield, but that's it."

XWingTMG,3bipuw,sacimino40,1 point,Mon Jun 29 16:33:45 2015 UTC,R3-A2 still only does double stress...
XWingTMG,3bipuw,antigrapist,2,Mon Jun 29 16:44:52 2015 UTC,"No, you can triple stress with the title if you really want to. As with cluster missiles, you are performing two separate attacks against the same target."
XWingTMG,3bipuw,sacimino40,2,Mon Jun 29 17:11:49 2015 UTC,"No, you declare the target for the turret ONCE"
XWingTMG,3bipuw,FunkyHat112,1 point,Mon Jun 29 17:23:28 2015 UTC,"They already clarified this with Cluster Missiles, where you go technically through two whole attack phases but are forced to declare the same target. It's the exact same wording."
XWingTMG,3bipuw,sacimino40,0,Mon Jun 29 18:12:51 2015 UTC,That was so the defender could roll defense dice. You are declaring the target one time. You cannot switch targets. One stress. Im sticking to this because it would be so OP if it laid out 3 stress at range 2-3.
XWingTMG,3bipuw,FunkyHat112,1 point,Mon Jun 29 18:58:54 2015 UTC,"It's the difference between 2 and 3 stress. While undoubtedly more powerful, the results aren't all that different."
XWingTMG,3bipuw,scuff,1 point,Mon Jun 29 19:10:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm seeing now it's carefully worded for that.   (nice work ffg)  It's still worth it, of course."
XWingTMG,3bipuw,rlcode,3,Mon Jun 29 16:49:49 2015 UTC,"It's still pretty spectacular. While this isn't a perfect example, you could theoretically pop it on 4 Golds.   That gives you 32hp, and EIGHT 3 dice turret attacks: Which means range three isn't going to provide an extra defense die.  At 96pts, you could still theoretically pop R2 units on them too."
XWingTMG,3bipuw,rsixidor,3,Mon Jun 29 16:35:17 2015 UTC,The most popular version of the 4 thugs just has to drop the seismics and throw on the turrets.  The ones running R4 have to change their astro as well.  It's going to be a blast.
XWingTMG,3bipuw,rsixidor,2,Mon Jun 29 16:48:11 2015 UTC,"In a meta with 3-agility ships showing up a lot (Corran, Soontir, Brobots, Guri, Xizor) and 2-agility ships also common (Dash, Wedge, Biggs, Palob, others) it actually can result in more consistent damage.   The first attack could also draw tokens to avoid the attack or maybe remove a stealth device.  And it's range 2-3. No other turret upgrade fits into that range."

XWingTMG,3bipuw,Keltaith,3,Mon Jun 29 16:31:39 2015 UTC,"So 4 gold squads with twin lasers have 8 - 3 dice attacks and 24hp?  Capped at a ""max"" of 8 dmg per turn.  Does this seem a little game breaking to anyone else?"
XWingTMG,3bipuw,sacimino40,4,Mon Jun 29 16:52:06 2015 UTC,not really. get into range one and your good. Plus you can still evade them.
XWingTMG,3bipuw,Keltaith,2,Mon Jun 29 16:52:57 2015 UTC,"A good opponent will still be able to shoot you with at least two of the turrets if your at range one to the rest. Also, how do you evade 8 - 3 dice attacks? Even Soontir Fel will fold in one turn to that."
XWingTMG,3bipuw,sacimino40,3,Mon Jun 29 17:02:04 2015 UTC,No its great dont get me wrong. I just dont think its gamebreaking. A good soontir pilot wont be in all those arcs.
XWingTMG,3bipuw,3rd_Charmer,2,Mon Jun 29 17:20:47 2015 UTC,... but let's hope he does anyway.  I'm really looking forward to using concentrated Twin Laser shots to take down Soontir in a single turn. heeheeheeheeheeheeheehee
XWingTMG,3bipuw,sacimino40,2,Mon Jun 29 17:27:32 2015 UTC,"haha, fine. In the event that he does, it will be fun to see the Baron burn."
XWingTMG,3bipuw,Lysus,2,Mon Jun 29 17:31:23 2015 UTC,"If they're not running Warthogs, Soontir's facing all of the attacks anyways (albeit with autothrusters)."
XWingTMG,3bipuw,VanderLegion,2,Mon Jun 29 18:38:26 2015 UTC,"Depends.  If he can get into range of some of them they can't shoot him, and depending how you fly the y-wings he might not be able to get out of the main arc of all of them for autothrusters to kick in."
XWingTMG,3bipuw,AffixBayonets,1 point,Mon Jun 29 19:33:14 2015 UTC,"Well, you're setting Soontir versus the entire squad, so that's naturally a lopsided matchup. What's he flying with?   All those Ys have low PS and low agility, so I think you could dogpile one at a time and ideally deny them one turret from the get-go. Plus, they're weak versus swarms of TIEs with their damage capped like that."
XWingTMG,3bipuw,starslinger72,1 point,Mon Jun 29 17:19:42 2015 UTC,Not really.  Half of those will not have modifiers to hit as they only have one action.  so half are average 1.5 damage.  Fel with auto stealth will have 1.5 evades from green + 1 from autothrusters.  He will prolly have 2 focus and an evade as well for the modified shots.
XWingTMG,3bipuw,EdgeOfDreams,3,Mon Jun 29 17:22:22 2015 UTC,"The one big downside to Twin Laser Turret is that if you have a Focus or Target Lock, you can only spend it on one of the two attacks, so around half of those attacks are going to be unmodified, making them less likely to actually hit."
XWingTMG,3bipuw,Keltaith,1 point,Mon Jun 29 16:56:51 2015 UTC,Statistically that will still kill turtled Soonir Fel in one turn right? Or strip 8 hp of a deci?  Seems like a lot.
XWingTMG,3bipuw,starslinger72,2,Mon Jun 29 17:12:02 2015 UTC,stealth auto fel?  You have like a 15% chance to hit him with an un modified shot with him not using tokens.  Your modified shots will have a better shot but he still has two focus and an evade.  That assumes he doesn't get into range 1 of at least two of your hogs as well.
XWingTMG,3bipuw,EdgeOfDreams,1 point,Mon Jun 29 17:25:13 2015 UTC,"It's got a pretty good chance. It's not the only list that can do that, though.  A swarm of 8 Z-95 Headhunters, for example, has 32 HP and, assuming they all focus, deals an average of 12 damage to a decimator in one round."
XWingTMG,3bipuw,Keltaith,1 point,Mon Jun 29 17:26:16 2015 UTC,Not in a 360 degree arc.
XWingTMG,3bipuw,EdgeOfDreams,1 point,Mon Jun 29 17:32:12 2015 UTC,"Of course, that's true. It'll actually be nice to have another option for a list that performs well against both arc dodgers and fat turrets. It won't break the game, though, because you can counter those Y-Wings with yet another list, such as dual IG-88s, which has both high agility and decent HP to weather all those attacks and return with heavy fire of its own."
XWingTMG,3bipuw,Keltaith,1 point,Mon Jun 29 17:37:54 2015 UTC,"I'll disagree. It is going to drive most evade heavy lists out of the game. With the way tournaments work, and having to go 5-1 in almost every tournament to make the cut, I can't see choosing any sort of Imperial List at this point."
XWingTMG,3bipuw,3rd_Charmer,1 point,Mon Jun 29 18:52:55 2015 UTC,"That's why a skill like Marksmanship would really help, but right now the only way to make that work on a Rebel Y-Wing is with that damned astromech."
XWingTMG,3bipuw,starslinger72,1 point,Mon Jun 29 17:29:13 2015 UTC,Predator would be the way to go so you could still focus and have an even better chance to hit.
XWingTMG,3bipuw,3rd_Charmer,1 point,Mon Jun 29 20:12:26 2015 UTC,"Focus can only be used on one of those attacks, though.  Marksmanship will apply to both attacks.  You can't run more than 1 on a Rebel Y-Wing anyways as you need the astromech, and the only one worth putting a talent on (Horton) already gets rerolls on his blanks at range 2-3, so Predator would be wasted on the Twin Laser Turret."
XWingTMG,3bipuw,starslinger72,1 point,Mon Jun 29 20:19:33 2015 UTC,"yes, you could only have it on one of them via the droid.  I was more pointing out that marksmenship being an action makes it worse for the double attack compared to predator which would give you the reroll for both, and still leave your action open for focus.  If you are going to give horton the droid its almost always going to be VI."
XWingTMG,3bipuw,Suicidal_Ferret,3,Mon Jun 29 20:25:46 2015 UTC,It sort of bothers me that the 2 PS K-wing has a better upgrade bar than the Defender but it's cheaper. :/
XWingTMG,3bipuw,fl1p_problems,2,Mon Jun 29 18:18:24 2015 UTC,We're getting our fix with the punisher. Just believe...
XWingTMG,3bipuw,Rambr,2,Mon Jun 29 18:39:33 2015 UTC,Even with a more green maneuver fix won't the defender still be overcosted? I assume you will have to pay points for the  Upgrade....
XWingTMG,3bipuw,PCGamerPirate,1 point,Mon Jun 29 18:53:53 2015 UTC,"From a straight stat line, yes (also known as Jousting Efficiency).  But if the dial is better, you are hopefully allowing the ship to make up for that inefficiency."
XWingTMG,3bipuw,lsop,1 point,Mon Jun 29 19:05:26 2015 UTC,Are you willing to trade a hull upgrade or the other modification options for some greens? Whether it be 2 or 6.
XWingTMG,3bipuw,PCGamerPirate,2,Mon Jun 29 21:05:52 2015 UTC,Depends on the pilot.  Rex definitely.  Vess probably.  Deltas...not sure. I really like hulls and/or ion.
XWingTMG,3bipuw,lsop,1 point,Mon Jun 29 21:08:43 2015 UTC,"Makes sense, I'm itching to know what it does."
XWingTMG,3bipuw,sacimino40,1 point,Mon Jun 29 21:22:08 2015 UTC,i think its a 0-1 pt upgrade
XWingTMG,3bipuw,starslinger72,1 point,Mon Jun 29 19:05:29 2015 UTC,The defender is maybe 2 points over priced.  Even then Vessery is the most accurate cannon in the game and has a very high effective health pool.  Stress is the only real issue for a defender to deal with and getting banks to greens is a great way to deal with this.
XWingTMG,3bipuw,Rambr,1 point,Mon Jun 29 20:14:45 2015 UTC,"Out of curiosity, when you say 2 points overcosted do you mean all defenders or just vessery? Even if generics were 28pts, I still can't see many of them hitting the table much ..."
XWingTMG,3bipuw,starslinger72,1 point,Mon Jun 29 20:41:35 2015 UTC,"all.  The only defender that I would not use in a list would be the onyx.  The delta has seen successful play at worlds this last year as well as in the TC aces league a few months back.    Rex and Vessery are very good, although you do have to build a list around them for the best results."
XWingTMG,3bipuw,fl1p_problems,1 point,Mon Jun 29 20:51:50 2015 UTC,Onyx has it's use when dealing with rebel swarms. Shooting first against a bunch of B-Wings makes all the difference.
XWingTMG,3bipuw,starslinger72,1 point,Tue Jun 30 09:55:17 2015 UTC,In the same argument I like the delta to jam that swarm.
XWingTMG,3bipuw,starslinger72,1 point,Tue Jun 30 14:31:22 2015 UTC,The defender has so much more than its upgrade bar that you are paying for.  They are totally different style ships...
XWingTMG,3bipuw,Suicidal_Ferret,2,Mon Jun 29 20:15:50 2015 UTC,"a white k-turn, a barrel roll, and a dial that has all hard turns as red?  since it has a white k-turn, everyone expects it. Having SLAM looks like it potentially makes the K-wing more maneuverable than a squint. Plus that upgrade bar.  If the defender were cheaper, I'd agree with you. But a low PS defender is still upper 20's (don't have the price memorized).  I love my defender but it's priced the same as a large base ship at half the goodies. Like lay's potato chips."
XWingTMG,3bipuw,starslinger72,1 point,Mon Jun 29 21:52:00 2015 UTC,"Except that it isnt.  The defender is basically a small base firespray which makes it harder to block up.  (its 30 points base and the 3 turns are white).  The Kturn with a barrel roll replaces the 1 and 2 turns to the point you rarely will need them.     Vessery is already an amazing pilot because of the ship he is in, and Rex can be a game changer if played correctly.  The deltas are a different style of ship that is not usually flown in empire, which is why you don't see it often.  Instead of bringing Fel with a howl mini swarm, an Ion defender brings the same damage with more health and control."
XWingTMG,3bipuw,Suicidal_Ferret,1 point,Tue Jun 30 00:28:51 2015 UTC,"How does having a barrel roll help with no hard 1-2?  I'll concede the small base firespray; except the part where the firespray has more health. The defender may be a little more agile but if it gets pegged, you're dead. And the firespray has a better upgrade bar. 2 points difference  I did do some reading and I'll admit that they fulfill different roles but it still kills me the price."
XWingTMG,3bipuw,starslinger72,1 point,Tue Jun 30 02:25:18 2015 UTC,"If you 4K with a barrel roll you will generally have the same shot you were looking for with the 1 hard turn.  The crew upgrade of the firespary is great but the added agi really makes the effective life pool the same to better for the defender.  They don't really fulfill different roles, both are brawler ships, but the defender gets its canon around for every shot while the firespray has to rely on its rear arc for part of its shots.  if they dropped the cost on the defender it would be silly, it already sees success.  Its not easy mode to fly which is why you don't see lots of people running them."
XWingTMG,3bipuw,Suicidal_Ferret,1 point,Tue Jun 30 14:30:55 2015 UTC,"A hard one maybe, but if the opponent does a hard 2/3 then they're out of sight. A barrel roll and a bank might put him back in our sights but he could K turn and we're jousting. Hmm...so I guess I can see how the AGI rating could be more useful in that situation. Then again, the firespray has the evade action. Don't know the odds on evade dice to really debate it further though.  Secondary weapons can't fire outside the primary fire arc. I imagine that it makes the defender more of a sniper than a brawler.  See's success? Where? I'm legitimately curious. I'll grant they're not easy mode but I think the reason we don't see them is the price point. You practically have to build your list around the defender and even then, you lose the goodies. But I don't have a solution for a ""cheaper"" defender. The cannons are expensive, ordinance is expensive, the ship is expensive. We don't have a chardaan refit (that's the a-wing -1pt mod right?)"
XWingTMG,3bipuw,starslinger72,2,Tue Jun 30 18:17:03 2015 UTC,"I placed 6th at NA nationals last year with my Bad joke list (finished high in many online tournaments as well but that was most notable).  There were two defender lists in the top 60-70s at worlds.  There was recently a dual defender list that was top 4 at a large regional that lost to the eventual winner.    The firespray rarely uses the evade action, Scum PTL kath being the major one I can think of or maybe a glitterstim evade after wave 7 if you are going to take a lot of heat in a turn.  I would love the evade action on the defender, but its absence isn't that terrible.  You are generally trying to drop as much damage as possible while your 3 agi and 3 shields keep you safe in the early pass.  After that you can easily get into the defender Kturn battle where you get 2 shots for their one and always have actions.  You are right in your point about having to build around the defender.  They mostly don't drop into other list arc types and just work.  That was their biggest hurdle to overcome, people like when things work like stuff they already know.  But building a list around a single ship is not a bad thing either."
XWingTMG,3bipuw,Dakkon_B,1 point,Tue Jun 30 18:24:09 2015 UTC,Lowest Defender unfortunately is 30 at PS 1.
XWingTMG,3bipuw,PCGamerPirate,1 point,Tue Jun 30 02:58:46 2015 UTC,Here's what the defender pays for:  1) 2 extra agility dice.  2) 3 natural attack dice.  3) The white k-turn.  The K-Wing dial is probably going to be terrible considering its cost and its two turrets (primary and turret upgrade).
XWingTMG,3bipuw,Keltaith,1 point,Mon Jun 29 18:36:22 2015 UTC,"You can't compare ships like this. The K-Wing has more HP, and a SLAM action as well.  It's dice are also 360 so the dial is less important."
XWingTMG,3bipuw,RDT2,1 point,Mon Jun 29 22:03:45 2015 UTC,My guess is no kturn on the K-wing. Hard 2 will be red and hard three will be white.

XWingTMG,3bipuw,PCGamerPirate,1 point,Tue Jun 30 05:55:32 2015 UTC,The only way to double stress with R3-A2 is with the title and a turret.  This runs you between 7 and 8 points to run depending on where you want your double stress blind spot and knocks at your out of arc attacks.

XWingTMG,3bipuw,forkmonkey88,1 point,Mon Jun 29 22:13:29 2015 UTC,"Unless they FAQ it, no. You gain stress based on your maneuver in the ""Check Pilot Stress"" step, which is before the ""Perform Actions"" step. Therefore, unless they FAQ it, you wouldn't get a stress from a SLAM'd red maneuver."
XWingTMG,3bipuw,Petunia2t,1 point,Tue Jun 30 02:44:36 2015 UTC,"They do state that using the SLAM is a 'full maneuver' though, that would suggest to me that if you chose a red move, its going to give stress.  But is SLAM also an action? If it is in fact a special kind of maneuver and not an action (even though it's on the action bar) does that suggest you can do a red 3 turn then SLAM a white 3 straight?  Guessing available maneuvers for example purposes, obviously."
XWingTMG,3bipuw,forkmonkey88,1 point,Tue Jun 30 05:11:27 2015 UTC,"SLAM is an action. Just like all other actions, you can't take it while stressed.   My point above was that, during the activation phase, you don't get stress when you execute a red maneuver. Instead, you assign stress to the ship during the ""Check Pilot Stress"" step based on the maneuver it executed. Since that step happens before the ""Perform Actions"" step, the step in which you'd be taking the SLAM action, I don't see when you'd be getting stress for a red maneuver executed as a part of a SLAM action."
XWingTMG,3bipuw,Petunia2t,1 point,Tue Jun 30 05:22:54 2015 UTC,"I see your point, maybe they only went to the trouble of referring to SLAM as a 'full maneuver' to justify its ability to drop 'reveal dial' bombs?  By that argument you could; white forward, red K (if it has one) and be turned around miles away for another bombing run, unable to shoot this turn, but unstressed going into the next turn.  Sounds like a classy way for me to fly a k-wing 8 inches off the board... backwards..."

XWingTMG,3bipuw,sacimino40,1 point,Tue Jun 30 05:43:32 2015 UTC,"You can only choose a maneuver of the same speed. Unless you werent talking about doing the SLAM for the 5k. It would need to be a 4k in order to do that, but I suppose that doesnt make a difference for the example you were giving."
XWingTMG,3bipuw,wer2,1 point,Tue Jun 30 16:26:28 2015 UTC,"I think the maneuver part is also because it can bump and stop movement early, unlike boost and barrel roll which are not maneuvers. It would also trigger anti-persuit lasers."

Unless it gets changed to something like perform the chosen maneuver and then receive a stress token if it was red. Makes me really curious about what the dial will be like.

XWingTMG,3bipuw,Herbstrabe,2,Mon Jun 29 16:53:56 2015 UTC,"Munitions are still the worst part of X Wing. I feel like their mechanic was pretty uninteresting and unimaginative from the beginning. Whenever you see them used in the movies or read about them in any of the books, they do tremendous damage. 24 Proton Torpedos (A whole squadron firing 2 torpedos each at once)  are repeatedly described as posing a serious thread to capital ships (even star destroyers) and only 2 of those at the right place destroyed a battle station that was mistaken for a moon (even though it was only a small one). We lose out on a very iconic part of the star wars universe. The proton torpedo should be a good card, just like the Falcon is playable and soon Vader will be a good choice again.  Strike the Ys, Bs and Decimators of this List. the Discount given by this card to them is miniscule. 2 Points for EM means you get a 1 point discount on the first 4 point card you buy. You get half a point discount on the first 3 point card and no points on a 2 point ordnance card. APTs look a little bit better with a 2 point discount per card. EMs effect gets strong once you buy 2 ordnance cards in addition to it. 4 Torpedo/Missile shots should be enough to enhance your attacks for the whole game on top of that (or at least nearly the whole game). On the flip side, you're looking at a 10 point investment while some of the main issues are not really fixed with this upgrade. Low PS pilots will still struggle to get that TL in the initial joust. Most attacks still spend the TL to fire, so you are now looking at a 3-4 dice Attack with no modification instead of a 3 dice attack with a (good) form of modification.  Then there's the problem with all those useless torpedo and missile slots. While buying our X Wings and TIE Defenders, we pay for that slot without ever having any use of it.  I am usually against implementing rules changes backwards with FAQs or something like this, since it is hidden information for newer players and will lead to very bad situations while playing at an official place for the first time. The Phantom fix was very needed (Imagine Soontir in his new glory combined with Whispers old glory combined). I think a munitions fix would be equally good and could go a long way to loosen up the big ship meta a little bit.  Use a wording that makes ordnance extra punishing for big ships, or even better, low agility ships (i.e. If your ship has 1 or less agility, you may not negate any damage by torpedos/missiles. OR double your agility against torpedos and missiles. If the attack hits, cancel all evade dice). Those ships are simply not fast enough to dodge the guided projectile. Now spending the 3-4 points left for a ordnance while list building could go a long way against big ships, ensuring one undefended big hit against low agility targets (Han, B Wings, Decimators(ok, you hit those in the same way today), Ys...). To make munitions really good even on low PS Pilots, add a modification:  Improved Guidance System, 1 point  If you spend a Target Lock or Focus token to fire a torpedo or missile, immidiatly acquire a target lock on the same target. Then discard this card.  Works only once and only with a munitions card. Works with Deadeye.  In a world with these 2 changes, a 10 point investment for a ship loaded with munitions would make sense: Your K Wing is now able to deal massive damage to low agility targets. X Wings would passively benefit from this since they sport 2 agility which gives them an advantage over B Wings with their weakness against torpedos.  This is only one of the possible ideas to fix munitions, there are many good ones out there (and a few not so good ones). Hey, they could even go as far as to make Torpedos good against low agi and Missiles good against high agi ships.   To come to a conclusion, munitions should be made viable. They should become a tool to tweak our lists to work against different targets. I think a change like this won't be implemented until we get a new core set equivalent, which won't happen until Episode 7 hits cinemas and we get new TIE Fighter and X Wing models."

We lose out on a very iconic part of the star wars universe. The proton torpedo should be a good card, just like the Falcon is playable and soon Vader will be a good choice again.   Oh yeah, I agree. I was terribly disappointed when I first opened up the main box and realized that Proton Torpedoes, the munitions that brought down the Death Star, are only slightly more powerful than the X-Wing's standard laser cannons.  I was hoping for a mechanic like Battlefleet Gothic where missiles and torpedoes actually had a presence on the battlefield as discrete objects that flew off and hit targets and had varying abilities to be guided by the player.   For example, what if you declared you were firing torpedoes as your action, you made your move, and then in the Combat phase they flew off with a five straight right in front of you? They'd be hard to aim and have a relatively low hit rate but that would justify damage that would vaporize a TIE Fighter if you managed to hit one. Plus, you'd have a reason to take more torps because three Red Squads firing them off in a spread would be much harder to dodge than one Y Wing with three torps firing them once at a time. The more maneuverable ordnance carrier would have a place.  Missiles, on the other hand, could perhaps choose a few different bank maneuvers and would move slower to represent their guidance but they wouldn't hit as hard. They'd be a fresh addition to the game. As is, Extra Munitions might make them viable on some ships but it won't make them interesting."

My only concrete point would be that munitions failsafe is a waste of points - both cluster missile shots have to miss in order to trigger it which with 4 dice each is unlikely. I'd trade that and veteran instincts in for lone wolf or glitterstim to ensure good rolls on your alpha strike

XWingTMG,3bmb52,Telemako,1 point,Tue Jun 30 12:43:02 2015 UTC,Expose is not worth it unless you have a way to modify your dice. RAC's ability is pretty good but rolling more dice will necessitate more modification abilities.  I think the best user of Expose+Experimental Interface on a decimator is Oicunn. Stressing a Decimator makes it a ripe target for blocking and Oicunn punishes blocking.  You are going to get better overall survivability with PtL on Carnor. Focus+Evade is a lot to punch through and you have the further option of using multiple actions to get out of firing arcs while still preventing the enemy's use of tokens.  Howlrunner is more effective when there are more ships on the board. I typically wouldn't take her without her supporting at least 3 additional ships.
XWingTMG,3bkgv0,zap1000x,15,Mon Jun 29 23:22:47 2015 UTC,"Lots of possibilities to help you deal with stress:   Wingman - 2 points, Elite Pilot Talent, lets you remove stress from a nearby ally at the start of the combat phase R2 Astromech and Unhinged Astromech - each gives you a lot more green maneuvers on your dial, making it easier to shed stress while still having options about where to go Captain Yorr - Lambda Shuttle pilot, can choose to take stress instead of one of his allies Advanced Sensors - doesn't prevent or remove stress directly, but it lets you take an action before you perform a red maneuver, so the stress isn't as much of an issue. Or, you can Advanced Sensors -> Push The Limit, taking two actions and a stress token, then immediately execute a green maneuver so you end up unstressed. Tycho Celchu - A-Wing pilot who can take actions even while stressed Keyan Farlander - B-Wing pilot who can spend a stress token as if it were a Focus token when attacking Outlaw Tech - 2 points, Crew, Scum Only, Limited, gives you a Focus token after you do a red maneuver Soontir Fel - Interceptor pilot who gains a Focus token whenever he gains stress Jek Porkins - X-Wing pilot who can remove stress from himself, but has to roll a die to see if he takes damage because of it Leia Organa - crew that can let allies treat red maneuvers as white Adrenaline Rush - 1 point, Elite Pilot Talent, discard to treat a red maneuver as white   You may also want to look at why you're getting stressed all the time.

XWingTMG,3bl48h,Paranoia515,1 point,Tue Jun 30 14:53:51 2015 UTC,"According to the FAQ, each ship can only drop 1 bomb a turn."
XWingTMG,3bl48h,LiquidAether,1 point,Tue Jun 30 17:51:33 2015 UTC,Only bombs that are actions can be dropped after you complete your maneuver. So Proximity Mines fall into this category.
XWingTMG,3bl48h,RDT2,1 point,Tue Jun 30 02:49:40 2015 UTC,"aye, but in the preview it looked like they had the k-wing dropping it after it moved. The ion bomb that is."
XWingTMG,3bl48h,RDT2,3,Tue Jun 30 02:51:18 2015 UTC,"Also, because your SLAM counts as a full maneuver, it allows you to drop your Proton Bombs in the middle of your activation, right before you execute your SLAM."
XWingTMG,3bl48h,Scruffy_lookin,1 point,Tue Jun 30 02:59:30 2015 UTC,"The K Wing in question was executing 2 maneuvers. So he moved, and then he could drop it prior to his second maneuver"

Also, every time I try to work Jonas into a group of HLC's, he's dead so fast it'll make your head spin.  Rexler would get a modified shot off, the Cow might not.  In my experience, Jonas dies before the end of the first round of shooting.    But if you can find a way to keep him engaged and alive, the pairing with Rexler is a thing of beauty."

XWingTMG,3bk856,fl1p_problems,2,Tue Jun 30 15:39:28 2015 UTC,"I'm playing a Jonus + 2x Onyx Defender with HLC at the moment.  I have thought about swapping one defender to something else, and the other to brath for added late-game awesomeness, but at the moment I'll keep it as is.  With 2 Defenders and Jonus, the enemy has a hard time deciding who to shoot first. Shoot Jonus and you risk having two unscathed HLC Defenders behind you very soon. Shoot a Defender and you will get ugly return fire.  The problem with your list is the poor maneuverability of the space cow. Also I have never made Braths passive work ever.  I'd suggest: swap Brath for Vessery. Vessery likes Target Locks alot, because he gets freebies as soon as someone else is locked on. Making the Shuttle a TL Machine is really easy. (Weapons Engineer, Title, FCS). You can boost Vessery to PS8 to give him an edge in the endgame. Keep Jonus as is, or give him Wingman to be able to stall with the cow, have Vessery fly around and enjoy free TLs. Could be fun ;)"
XWingTMG,3bk856,soaring_bear,1 point,Tue Jun 30 08:02:30 2015 UTC,"I ran with a similar squad a few months ago, and did fairly well with it.  Jonus w/ wingman OGP w/ HLC, Advanced Sensors Brath w/ VI, HLC  I found the biggest key to success was the deployment. By getting Jonus behind OGP, you can park in one place all day long with focus and two rerolls while Brath watches the flanks. Don't be afraid to separate if need be, you still have 2 HLC's. I haven't played it in a while, though I may give it a revisit this week!"
XWingTMG,3bk856,Dakkon_B,1 point,Tue Jun 30 06:25:35 2015 UTC,Are you looking to play a HLC Defender build? Or Brath + Jonus specifically?   This is my go to Tie Defender build (and my tournament build in general). It packs A LOT of consistent fire power.   Tho with the Raider Tie Advanced drop coming soon I will most likely update it to this.   Point is Brath is very conditional. I have tried him several times and never been impressed. Vessery however with free TL is a consistent powerhouse. Scoring 4 dice rolls every attack round. (free TL with a focus).
XWingTMG,3bjz3c,Torobasa,4,Mon Jun 29 21:02:28 2015 UTC,"It's worth noting that it only strips a shield if they have any remaining AFTER the attack does it's damage, so that only helps against high shield ships that haven't already been damaged."
XWingTMG,3bjz3c,VanderLegion,3,Mon Jun 29 21:36:32 2015 UTC,Those ships are a large part of the meta right now. B-Wings & all large base ships.  Range 2-3 and its ability make this perfect for the opening round of shooting.
XWingTMG,3bjz3c,ClearChocobo,1 point,Mon Jun 29 21:39:12 2015 UTC,"Those ships are a large part of the meta right now.   That's what the ""and haven't already been damaged"" part is for.  Unless you're using them on your highest PS pilot, odds are you'll already have taken some shots with other ships before you fire off the torpedoes.  If you've done any damage before firing them, plus a 4 dice attack there's decent odds of shields being down by the time you do it.  Against a b-wing, you can easily have the shields down with only 1 attack + the damage from the torpedo.  Against a decimator you could potentially wipe out the shields with just the 4 dice attack, not even counting any previous damage.  I'm not saying they suck, and anytime you do strip an extra shield is great, just that it's not like it's always gonna be a guaranteed extra damage."

They need droids to upgrade their survivability, either R2-D2, R5-P9 or R7 to force re-rolls (very good with high PS X-wings).  Generating a stress with Wes is very nice, but you have made the priority target an even bigger priority to get him off the board ASAP.  Wedge with R7-T1 and an EU is redundant.  R7-T1 is a sweet alternative to an EU, much more situational, but much more versatile, and 1 point less expensive.  Still I feel that R2-D2 works better on Wedge to keep him in the fight longer because he's the next in line to get shot.  Lastly, you've added the incentive to save the B for last because he's got C-3PO on him to make me less likely to target him, and just accept a 3 dice attack per turn until the two X-Wings are gone.  At least switch it to Jan Ors crew to give out evades, and make me contemplate shooting him before Wes or Wedge."

Dark Curse or Jax in a tanky ship would be super annoying. Biggs might be the worst, especially some kind of autothruster stealth device ship where you can put a tact jammer in front, or decoy in the list with him in a Phantom and have him shoot first. Luke or Laetin in an autothruster + stealth device ship would also be really hard to kill.  Both Keyan and Ibtisam would be pretty cool in more maneuverable ships like an Interceptor or Starviper. Or Ibti in a PTL Aggressor would be like a free Lone Wolf. Tycho would also be really cool in a PTL Aggressor, or Interceptor. Similarly Vader in a ""better ship"".  Blount in a ship that can equip a cannon or turret (auto ion). Also, Rhymer in a ship with turrets.  Turr (lesser extent Jake) in a large turreted ship would be amazingly annoying as well.  Tetran Cowall would be really cool in a Defender.  N'dru in any big ship basically. Backstabber is strong in any ship, but particularly a phantom. Vrill in a ship that can take R3-A2 would be very strong.  Etahn on a cheaper ship would be really great as you could have a bigger swarm getting his ability.  Garven in a Moldy Crow would be pretty annoying, save up some focuses, spend them all to give to all your ordnance laden wingmen, they fire away.  Hobbie would be awesome in a ship with FCS.

There should be a tiny chance of two crits with two attack dice (SJ can't change crits) but it shows as blank.  (edit:  It's handling it right, this is because of the evade token.)  If you can get past the SD, it's 2.5% for 2D, 7.2% for 3, and 15.8% for 4.  But even so, I don't see anyone getting through 5 damage in 75 minutes."

XWingTMG,3bk3mz,Notexactlyserious,2,Tue Jun 30 19:54:46 2015 UTC,"I think a ship with natural 4 primary red dice and is evasive as balls, and can basically do a 2 barrel roll is pretty good. Also with a crew slot and system upgrade. Not wanting to use the term OP, but it is still very good."
XWingTMG,3bk3mz,ernesto__-,1 point,Tue Jun 30 02:42:33 2015 UTC,"The Phantom is still very, very good, but it can be countered. Having a ship with PS 9 (with initiative) or higher will let you shoot first and only deal with 2 green dice. Turrets can help you deal with the maneuverability the Phantom has. Han Solo with Veteran Instincts, for example, is Whisper's own personal nightmare.  If you're good at visualizing your maneuvers and predicting your opponents, Echo can be almost as good as Whisper, because Echo has more total options for where to decloak to. 1 less PS and not getting the Focus to spend on defense are significant, though."
XWingTMG,3bk3mz,EdgeOfDreams,1 point,Mon Jun 29 21:43:14 2015 UTC,"Didn't think of pilots with PS 9 + veteran instincts, I keep thinking PS 9 is the highest it goes, but only ""naturally"""
XWingTMG,3bk3mz,EdgeOfDreams,1 point,Mon Jun 29 21:59:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah, PS 10 and 11 are achievable via Veteran Instincts. There's also the pilot Roark Garnet, who can boost an ally to PS 12 during the combat phase. On the other end of the spectrum, Torkil Mux or the upgrade Enhanced Scopes can make a pilot act as PS 0 temporarily.  Don't forget about Initiative either. Back before the Phantom nerf there was a Whisper + Echo build that added up to 86 points. It had enough room to add a TIE Fighter, but instead the guy who invented it decided to leave those 14 points empty so he'd be practically guaranteed to have the choice of taking initiative or not."

XWingTMG,3bk3mz,Ryddari,1 point,Tue Jun 30 08:41:41 2015 UTC,"Although a lot of people have other opinions, I take echo over whisper any day. Some argue that gaining that focus for defense is vital enough, but if you can maneuver right you won't be in arc to need a focus. Obviously turrets are the counter here but that's what the rest of the squad is for. Also if you can maintain range 3 it's not too bad either. I love echo with outmaneuver, rec spec, adv. cloak, and fcs. Lately with the high turret meta I've used decoy instead and put VI on a higher ps dude like chirneau. Kicks major ass when you can move in crazy directions and shoot at ps10 or 11"

Bam, poor man's segnor loop. (also possible with Leia crew card.)  At first glance I would pick marksmanship for the doule-shot with twin lasor, but after consideration, I realise the Crit does nothing (since we cancel defense dice) so you might as well run Recon-Spec and save a focus for your defense dice. Or run the PS6 pilot with recon spec, since that combo's awesomly.  I plan to try the PS6 as a bomber. Move, drop bomb, SLAM, use action (with advanced SLAM) to gain 2 focuses with recon spec. You now have 2 free focus to be used by your squad."

XWingTMG,3bjqs8,LiquidAether,1 point,Mon Jun 29 20:17:13 2015 UTC,Wasn't sure if that was the better choice or to use determination so I could push out as much damage as possible before he goes down by knowing he wont lose his pilot ability and just focusing every round
XWingTMG,3bjqs8,AffixBayonets,1 point,Mon Jun 29 21:06:01 2015 UTC,Wouldn't Chewbacca with Gunner work a bit better for that role?
XWingTMG,3bjqs8,Enervata,1 point,Tue Jun 30 14:55:18 2015 UTC,"I'd probably go with Chewbacca + Gunner too, since it gives you added crit protection.  As a lower cost EPT, my friend also loves running Elusiveness with Han.  Stress isn't terrible for the ship, so it let's him selectively force a reroll on a crit or a hit and use his action for offense.  It actually works pretty well since there's a number of times the opponent won't have a combat modifier available.  I also think a lot of people go Fat Han because the base cost of the ship is so high that the upgrades are such a small cost by comparison for what they give to the overall ship."
XWingTMG,3bi1bm,Durog25,7,Mon Jun 29 11:46:09 2015 UTC,"Couple things:   Kyle is just all over the place. Kyle wants to focus like...all the time, to maximize his pilot ability. But he also has saboteur, which is used with an action, and engine upgrade, which is used on an action. He has push the limit, which lets him take 2 actions, but stresses him, and doesn't have a good way to shed the stress he gets because hwks have awful dials. Couple that with having a range 1 turret, and hes super easy to deal with. You're just doing too much with him on this list, and you're only ever using a fraction of his point value on any given turn. Try putting nien and engine upgrade with PTL on him if you want to use the autoblaster, that way you can basically use your straights to clear stress, with boost + focus every turn.  The damage is just too low. You're going to have a hard time punching through with what you have, and you only have 16 health and 3 total agility accross the squad, so you don't have the longevity to hold out while you plink away the damage.  Tactician only works in firing arc, but you are using a 360 degree turret, so the synergy is a bit off here. In addition, you're stressing a HWK again, which isn't good This sort of ties them all together: all three of your hwks have things that pile on stress, but you only have nien on one ship as a way to alleviate it. hwks have pretty bad dials, so if you're constantly trying to shed stress, you're going to have super limited mobility."
XWingTMG,3bi1bm,kattahn,1 point,Mon Jun 29 14:38:17 2015 UTC,"First off let me clarify. I know this list is hopelessly uncompetitive. It's a gimmick list for the funzies.   You'd be surprised with this Kyle build. Yes he's doing a lot, but he;s also dangerous. I've found, at least in my home meta that people are not yet accustomed to auto blaster turret and it's ability to completely negate all forms of defense. This set up can out maneuver some pretty deadly ships and, in this squad, always shoot first. Plus with Jan backing it up it can hit for a maximum of three uncancellable hits. I've used this list to one shot Soonitrs more than once.  The damage is low but it is also uncancelable in some cases and in others its supposed to ion, stress. Also it's 6 agility not 3, HWKs have 2 agility not 1.  Tactician doesn't stress the ship using it.  Two HWKs are stress spams, neither really cares. Jan has Nein so she can drop stress, Kyle doesn't worry about stress either since he spends the early turns stacking focus before attacking.  I did however remove saboteur and juggle a few things around to fit in a recon spec to Kyle."
XWingTMG,3bi1bm,acegard,2,Mon Jun 29 21:10:19 2015 UTC,"At the Denver regionals, there was a guy with a 3 Scum-HWK (Dace, Palob, Torkil)+1 Binayre Pirate list who just barely missed out on the Top-8.

Palob steals a token, ideally an evade, then smacks them with the blaster turret.   Spice runner 1 hits with greedo and hopefully crits, and crit plus ion is meeeeeean.   Spice runner 2 uses the info from intelligence agent to try and boost into r1 and hits with the autoblaster for unstoppable damage.   (updated link as old one was somehow broken)"
XWingTMG,3bi04m,GiovanniTavra,3,Mon Jun 29 11:30:21 2015 UTC,This one won at Denmark: Chewbacca + Predator + Millennium Falcon + Engine Upgrade + Luke Skywalker + C-3PO; 3x Tala Squadron Pilot  There was also a top 8 that ran Cracken as one of the Zs Chewie + Predator + Gunner + C-3PO + MF; Airen Cracken + VI; 2x Tala  I definitely think there's something to the list. You're very tough and can bring damage pretty well. Three Zs do far more damage than some realize though the three agility ships in meta will be a tougher nut to crack. Maybe best used as blockers in that matchup?  I like the Predator version. You're free to use your action for an Evade token and don't shut down your dial at all.
XWingTMG,3bi04m,rsixidor,2,Mon Jun 29 14:28:33 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the comment. Predator does seem like a viable alternative, I will have to play a few games and see what is a better fit. I tried flying the list with PTL yesterday vs. Outrider/Keyan/Z and it did surprisingly well. PTL allowed me to take evade and focus on most turns which was very nice. I do need to try playing vs. high agility lists and see how effective it can be in that matchup."

XWingTMG,3bi4pb,CircleTheFire,2,Mon Jun 29 14:34:26 2015 UTC,I believe the simple answer is that the Y wing was released before the crew upgrade was invented. Y wing was a wave 1 ship. Crew slots debuted in wave 2.

XWingTMG,3bfbnc,Blackxp,2,Sun Jun 28 18:43:23 2015 UTC,I secretly like the idea of a no-communication game. Set up a scenario where the communications systems are jammed by some nearby Lambda shuttle (not sure if possible) and you need to destroy it before you can coordinate with each other.

You can share info and tactics, but your opponents will know what you're saying. It's a really fun way of playing, and if you have a non-conscientious teammate, it can lead to much frustration and bumping. If you have a good game plan and stick to it, it's extremely satisfying."

In many cases it effectively precludes the ""team"" part of team play; you and your partner function more as allies of circumstance than an actual team, and really, blindly flailing around isn't actually teamwork, per se.  That said, I guess not all is lost. Epic play allows private talk between team members, and the normal play rules specifically say I must be audible to the opponents, not intelligible."

XWingTMG,3bfqoz,exonwarrior,4,Sun Jun 28 20:46:19 2015 UTC,"Yes, MoV favors big ships.  The game itself however has a number of things that punish big ships.  All in all it is an uncomfortable balance.  Personally, I think MoV is garbage as a scoring system exists outside of the game itself and really shouldn't favor certain ships."
XWingTMG,3bfqoz,SonicPara,1 point,Sun Jun 28 21:08:31 2015 UTC,What would you say punishes big ships?
XWingTMG,3bfqoz,SonicPara,2,Sun Jun 28 21:09:22 2015 UTC,"Autothrusters is the biggest one with most common big ships being turrets.  Mangler cannon also punishes them heavily as debilitating crits become more important on ships that last longer and carry more upgrades.  There are more but big ships aren't as strong as they used to be.  They are still very powerful, but not as absolutely."
XWingTMG,3bfqoz,Enervata,0,Sun Jun 28 21:12:13 2015 UTC,"Autothrusters actually hurt jousters quite a bit as well.  I'd argue that it hurts them more so than big turret ships, since it helps arc dodgers.  And with the rock-paper-scissors meta that exists, if you want big ships to get knocked down a peg you need to make jousters more viable."
XWingTMG,3bfqoz,PCGamerPirate,1 point,Mon Jun 29 00:51:02 2015 UTC,MoV is still way better than Strength of Schedule.  Not sure what system would be best though.
XWingTMG,3bfqoz,Jimmars,2,Mon Jun 29 02:15:51 2015 UTC,"While a bit more complicated, 100/(Hull+shields) could work, counting a set amount of points for every hull point you destroy."
XWingTMG,3bfqoz,Notexactlyserious,1 point,Mon Jun 29 07:50:19 2015 UTC,"That's what I was thinking, or at least you get half points for dealing at least half-damage.  So if you're playing againts Brobots and lose but both of the IGs are only a couple of hits away from death, I would argue that getting half from each is a good compromise."
XWingTMG,3bfqoz,Inquisitorsz,1 point,Mon Jun 29 08:41:06 2015 UTC,Yeah but good luck getting all of that correct in a 60 person tournament for both sides and each ship.
XWingTMG,3bfqoz,VanderLegion,3,Mon Jun 29 21:17:59 2015 UTC,"I think the biggest issue is round time.  The tournament rules require 75min rounds, but I played a tournament yesterday where they decided to run 60min rounds. I think this favored tanky builds.  I was running 2 large ships (Boba and IG88B) but they weren't built for defense (and the dice hated me all day anyway). But the tournament winner was a Fat Han with Luke + R2 in an X-wing.   It was a fairly wide spread so I'm probably exaggerating but the few games that I watched seemed to greatly favor the defensive builds. I think about 80% of the games (4 rounds, 11 people), went to time so clearly 60min isn't enough. Given enough time, a lot of the other lists like my offensive large ships and small ship lists could have prevailed since the defensive builds tend to not put out enough damage. Another 15 min can be 4-5 turns and can make a huge difference if all you need to do is knock off 2 more hull points or kill one more A-wing.   TL;DR I don't think it's MOV that's the problem... it's the time limit."
XWingTMG,3bfqoz,Inquisitorsz,1 point,Sun Jun 28 23:25:51 2015 UTC,"I think the biggest issue is round time. The tournament rules require 75min rounds, but I played a tournament yesterday where they decided to run 60min rounds   The TO has the option to change the time limit up or down by up to 15 minutes:   Dogfight tournaments for the X-Wing miniatures game are held in a series of 75 minute tournament rounds. Tournament organizers may adjust this number up or down by up to fifteen minutes as they see fit, to a minimum of 60 and a maximum of 90.  I don't think it's MOV that's the problem... it's the time limit.   This is the key though.  Without time limits, MoV isn't AS big a problem with large ships, since you have the opportunity to kill them.  Doesn't entirely fix it though.  you still have the issue that if they wipe you off the board while they have a falcon (or 2 big ships even) with 1 health remaining you still don't get any MoV for that ship.  Ont he toher hand, if you fly a swarm and end the game with 1 health left, your opponent got a lot more MoV for it."
XWingTMG,3bfqoz,VanderLegion,1 point,Sun Jun 28 23:29:35 2015 UTC,Yeah you're right. I just think 60min is flat out not long enough. Especially after you waste 5-10min setting up. There are ways to bring down large ships though (mine did very poorly yesterday) so sometimes all you have to do is focus fire one of them down and then run away for the rest of the game.
XWingTMG,3bfqoz,Barzhac,1 point,Sun Jun 28 23:34:53 2015 UTC,"Yah, 60 minutes would be rough.  All the 100 point tournaments I've been to so far have done the 75 minute rounds so it hasn't been as big of an issue."
XWingTMG,3bfqoz,rottinguy,1 point,Mon Jun 29 01:23:27 2015 UTC,"If they're doing 60 min, they should absolutely not start until everyone is set (unless there's a massive slow mover, then screw 'em and everyone can start up anyway).  that's the way we do it locally.  If we're going 75, we're a little less likely to wait for everyone."
XWingTMG,3bfqoz,sacimino40,2,Mon Jun 29 03:09:39 2015 UTC,Current meta in my area seems to favor small ships. All lists were built around destroying large ship builds to the point that no one is playing large ships in tournys here right now.

XWingTMG,3bgwqf,jebleez,2,Mon Jun 29 03:03:58 2015 UTC,"The issue I se is that the HWK is a waste of 25 points-  you're not getting that much utility out of Jan for 25 points.  It can't do damage with just it's primary cannon, it's just adding one extra die to Han and having to take a stress on top of that.  I like the addition of Nien Numb on there to help open up the dial, but if you turn around and look at as a 25 point upgrade to the Falcon, it's not worth it.  You may be better off adding a blaster turret and the moldy crow title to the HWK.  It's six more points, but you suddenly have a ship that actually has more utility than just Jan.  Lose the cluster missiles on the Z and you are almost there."
XWingTMG,3bgwqf,vlaka_patata,1 point,Mon Jun 29 04:00:38 2015 UTC,Drop the missiles and tactician and he has the 6 points.
XWingTMG,3bgwqf,Jimmydehand,2,Mon Jun 29 04:04:35 2015 UTC,"Don't get me wrong-  I like where you are going with this build.  Setting up Han with a six die attack every turn is fun and I would probably try it just for the lolz.  But if I see this list, I'm seeing 25 points spent on just one extra die for Han.  I would turn around and focus fire Han down fast-  with no agility and no other threats, he's going down quick.  At that point, a naked HWK and a Z are not going to give me any trouble."
XWingTMG,3bgwqf,vlaka_patata,1 point,Mon Jun 29 04:09:09 2015 UTC,"Excellent points! I'm going to do some refining here, and probably run a list close to this sometime soon. The turret weapon on the HWK makes total sense. Done!"

XWingTMG,3bgwqf,earlofhoundstooth,1 point,Mon Jun 29 04:42:32 2015 UTC,"Agree with Vlaka, but gotta say though, nobody is going to be attacking Jan to remove that extra die before Solo goes down. He would probably keep his bonus."
XWingTMG,3bgwqf,1_73,1 point,Mon Jun 29 04:11:23 2015 UTC,"Not having that focus hurts, because you want to have a focus when you use han's ability, since you have no rerolls whatsoever."
XWingTMG,3bgwqf,LiquidAether,1 point,Mon Jun 29 07:53:21 2015 UTC,"The Han shotgun is a fun idea.  A similarly themed list made top 8 in the Boise regional last week.  I would drop tactician, it only works in your front arc, so it probably won't activate that often.  And as mentioned elsewhere, Jan needs a turret.  5-6 attack dice is amazing, but if you don't have something else to add to it, the opponent will just overpower you."
XWingTMG,3bgoqj,MacAtck,2,Mon Jun 29 01:49:04 2015 UTC,"Jonus' ability does not work on his own shots.  You have 4 missiles on him.... don't do that.  Since he only helps other ships, he shouldn't have any.  If you put that many torpedoes on a bomber it will be dead by the end of the second round of combat, making the 14 points you've spent upgrading him completely wasted.  Generally you don't want to use Jonus unless you've got two other ships to boost with him.  Also... boosting Rexler can be good for movement, but for his pilot ability... you want him firing as late as possible.  That is tricky to manage.    Here is how I would run a list with the same feel: Captain Jonus (22) Rexler Brath + Decoy + “Mangler” Cannon (43) Delta Squadron Pilot + “Mangler” Cannon (34)    If you don't want to use Decoy tricks feel free to upgrade Rexler's cannon to an HLC."

It's hard to go wrong with any ship in my opinion especially when you're just discovering the game."
XWingTMG,3bft9q,Copper_Lontra,4,Sun Jun 28 23:14:40 2015 UTC,"The Imperial and Rebel Ace sets both give you two ships each, and a pretty good set of upgrade cards."
XWingTMG,3bft9q,jebleez,1 point,Sun Jun 28 23:27:54 2015 UTC,I've wondered this since I started. Why does everyone seem to recommend 2 core sets?
XWingTMG,3bft9q,teh_longinator,3,Mon Jun 29 01:12:47 2015 UTC,"Extra dice (which you pretty much need). Spare asteroids, maneuver templates, and damage cards, in case you lose some. Cost-efficient basic ships."
XWingTMG,3bft9q,quarrel,1 point,Mon Jun 29 01:35:36 2015 UTC,Ah. Good call. I might follow this and get a second core (played today and found myself needing to borrow a spare attack/defense die far too often.
XWingTMG,3bft9q,teh_longinator,3,Mon Jun 29 01:39:20 2015 UTC,"If it's a dice issue, you can get extra dice for like 4 bucks. I understand why people get the second core pack, but as a strictly casual player, I'd advise your first buy to be an expansion. X vs 2 tie is nice to learn the game, but if you are on a limited budget it might be a while till you get new ships. The core is what, 30? Rebel aces and imperial aces gets you new ships and upgrades to play with for an extra 15$ (above the core). Gives you the option of 100 point games or playing lower to keep it varied. If that's too much (15 isn't easy to come by for everyone) what about a single y wing and a tie advanced or bomber. Bottom line for me is I like fielding new ships, rather than having more of something. Clearly your call, but I got core and both aces packs and I've been having a blast for a few months now."

XWingTMG,3bgfxy,FrenchyLeFry,2,Mon Jun 29 00:27:09 2015 UTC,"A build i've considered is Han with Predator or Lone Wolf, Gunner, C-3P0, MF title and a Wild Space Fringer with HLC and Outrider. you could drop Gunner on Han to run Recon Spec on the WSF.  Might not be amazing but should be fun."
XWingTMG,3bgfxy,rsixidor,2,Mon Jun 29 02:06:35 2015 UTC,"I'm loathe to run HLC + Outrider without at least an engine upgrade, and preferably engine upgrade and push the limit so that you can boost and then barrel roll.   Without either, you're going to get someone inside your doughnut, and you're going to be absolutely helpless to do anything about it."
XWingTMG,3bgfxy,doodeman,1 point,Mon Jun 29 09:23:45 2015 UTC,Fair point. Better move may be dropping HLC to Mangler or not using Outrider.

XWingTMG,3bgfxy,doodeman,1 point,Mon Jun 29 11:42:05 2015 UTC,"Eh, I think it's debatable. You've still got your primary turret and you can do something that no other 2400 would bother with, k-turn."

XWingTMG,3bgfxy,cramillett,1 point,Mon Jun 29 06:38:40 2015 UTC,"I just ran this last night, in an odd way    Generic YT1300 / double tactician / Anti Pursuit Lasers / Falcon title Generic YT3400 / outrider title / Ion canon / Anti Pursuit Lasers 2x Bandit Squad Z95s   http://xwing-builder.co.uk/view/274630/biggles  So low PS swhips, and the idea is block, stress and ion them to death. I went 1 win 1 loss, trashed a triple elite interceptor list for losing just one z95, then lost on MoV to a Darth/Carnor/OnyxDefender list. In the second one I was very close to winning on MoV, but lost to bad asteroid placement and also to a couple of terrible moves in the last round that landed me on asteroids and denied a shot.   The list works thusly. Run the Falcon up one side, so when it turns in you have the best chance of the double tactician stressbomb. If you don't get it, don't worry. It is at least area denial and makes the enemy fly badly and often dodge out of arc but also deny their own shot to avoid it. Take evade a lot to get pseudo 2 green dice, or lock if you can get a short/medium range shot and the 2 red natural turret may work.   Run the 2400 a little in from it, and in front of the z95s. The Ion doesn't care on direction and you can take some shots. I locked a lot to make the ion kick in more.   I kept the z95s behind to cover some space with shooting arc and block. YOu also need to run the first round with careful movement forward. I think I did 2 forward with the falcon, and 1 forward with the rest. Try and get a feel for their direction.   Lastly, on steroids make SURE you put your just under rane 2 from one another so your opponent cannot sneak one in between and make for small gaps. I actually ran them largely on my side of the table, witht he view that i could line up the deployment to se the gaps then use their side of the table to turn, while they would be turning in my side more.   Also thinking about it next time I would just just debris so i do not lose the shots if I land on one.   Tactically, you smack the ion on and try and use it to make them hit you. Them crashing into you means they trigger the Anti Pursuit Lasers, which hopefully causes damage but also means no actions and they can;t shoot what they run into. THis makes it easier for the other YT to stress or ion them and gives you a decent idea where they go next turn.   Keep the YTs moderately close and try and make blocks with the YT and asteroids to strongly encourage collision. If collision happens, they probably get hurt, and if it doens;t happen they probably fly to avoid it and deny themselves the shot. In my second game the tooled up Carnor Jax only shot me in about round 5 or 6 because he angled away to avoid the threat and ended up out of it for ages.   This list is... a pain to fight. My opponent said it was like a MCG denial deck, and if i played this every week I;d assume my group would not want to play with me any more :) but it is very interesting to play.   Still, it got me using the ships, and in fact i really like the WSP with Ion cannon. Range 3 ion canon is pretty brutal on a platform that big, rough and maneuverable."

XWingTMG,3bed6q,doodeman,1 point,Sun Jun 28 13:24:18 2015 UTC,The smallest ring magnets they have is too large for small ships. I've been wondering about going the other route and use magnetized ball bearings and steel washers on the ships themselves. That approach also has the advantage of being able to transport your ships more than one of each per compartiment as they won't snap together and risk breakage. The stands snapping together shouldn't be much of a worry.
XWingTMG,3bed6q,Murm3l,1 point,Sun Jun 28 22:21:35 2015 UTC,"The guide OP posted uses 1/4"" wide and 1/16"" tall rings for the small ships. That's 6.35 mm by 1.5875 mm.

XWingTMG,3bfigg,ernesto__-,2,Sun Jun 28 19:38:37 2015 UTC,"Id change astromechs for a hlc on dash, the 4th dice really helps against brobots."
XWingTMG,3bfigg,Slanesh,1 point,Sun Jun 28 19:53:47 2015 UTC,Yes and no IMO. Problem is they can keep in range 1 relatively well so that HLC can be a liability.   I agree with you that HLC is better but it does have a weakness to consider.   Why the 2 X-Wings over Z-95s? Yes you lose 1 red dice and 1 Hull per ship but those numbers can be made up by adding another Z-95 and still have 6 points to play with.
XWingTMG,3bfigg,Dakkon_B,1 point,Sun Jun 28 20:52:54 2015 UTC,It's more of having 3 shots per ship that 2 shots per 3 ships. Harder to cancel 3 hits
XWingTMG,3bfigg,Dakkon_B,1 point,Sun Jun 28 22:14:01 2015 UTC,":) Sure thing, that I get. :D which is why you use the extra Z-95 for blocking and get the other 2 in range 1 for 3 red dice.   (But I understand the reasoning on the 3 red dice but why the R2 then?)"
XWingTMG,3bfigg,Dakkon_B,1 point,Sun Jun 28 22:26:51 2015 UTC,"Kinda keeping up after k turns, which I'm sure they will be doing since they're x wings, also any sort of stress builds."
XWingTMG,3bfigg,Inquisitorsz,1 point,Sun Jun 28 22:28:02 2015 UTC,Hmm I maybe wrong since I don't fly X-wings that much but flying vs them they seem to kinda not care about stress. I mean sure you can't K turn and that does matter at times but they are not Action based ships like say an Interceptor or Phantom. I would assume you would just either ignore the stress or do a 1 maneuver and clear it if your expecting to have to K turn.    But Corran kinda does the job of 2 X-wings via his double tap to finish a target. An has a much better stat line with a PS 8. Did you play test your list and just preferred the double X-wing over him?
XWingTMG,3bfbdo,hazykev,3,Sun Jun 28 18:39:36 2015 UTC,"I wonder if something like Rebel Aces and Imperial Aces would be a solid pickup. They come with two ships each and plenty of upgrade cards. I am newer to the game and would not be able to say much about balancing the different play-styles, but the interceptors are excellent as arc dodgers. I do wonder if the Push the Limit cards in the Rebel Aces might set the Imperial Aces over the top or not, but definitely listen to other comments. I do not want to send you in the wrong direction.  I converted to USD for my own ease. So you want to spend ~$80-$120 on xwing. Both ace packs would be $60 MSRP here which could cover a large portion (Not sure on how close to MSRP you can get over there). So you have $20 - $60 left to purchase more ships.  I would say picking up another X-wing and Tie-Fighter ($15 each) might be a solid choice, because they give you new pilots to work with and the ability to fly similar ships in formation. This is even cooler for the tie fighters since you can attempt a mini-swarm with them now that you will have 3 of them (Tons of fun and another playstyle). That also gives you wedge for the x-wing who is an absolute beast when it comes to trying higher point skilled pilots. Finally the B-wing in the rebel aces gives you some interesting secondary weapon tactics that you can try out. They cannot dodge hits well but they can definitely take a beating with all those shields and hull.  All of this is coming from a more casual player so do remember that. I am unsure how this would build into anything competitive but hopefully it gives you a solid idea on how to branch out. It comes to approximately $90 which is between your $80-$120 range. Also large ships are a ton of fun too but they tend to be $30 each and will give you less diversity. You could swap out Imperial and Rebel Aces for two large ships that you enjoy, like maybe a Decimator and Millennium Falcon or something.  Enjoy!"

XWingTMG,3bdpk5,AvarinSpectre,3,Sun Jun 28 06:22:51 2015 UTC,"Although using multiples of the same ships and pilot skill is pretty much the definition of easy, I've found that my friends seem to learn quicker when using a mix of different ship types with (mostly) the same pilot skill. For example...   XWing (PS4 red sqn, R3A2) BWing (PS4 dagger sqn, fire control, heavy cannon) YWing (PS4 grey sqn, R5, ion turret) AWing (PS1 prototype, refit)   That's 99pts and easy to use, all the while providing a few extra options to help ease someone into the game. Importantly, it also features ships which fulfill different roles within the list, which makes it both fun and interesting, and I think helps the learning curve."

Edit: I know it's got a lot of mechanics going on, which can be a lot for a new player to handle, but I think he'll learn them pretty quickly, and it's a lot easier to manage a 2 ship squad than 4-5 ships.

You can have upgrade cards from any faction's expansions, though, so long as you follow the rules for any that say things like ""Rebel Only"".  However, any faction can play against any other faction, including mirror matches (e.g. Rebel vs Rebel).  Some people do casual matches sometimes where you can mix-and-match factions, but that messes with the balance of the game."

XWingTMG,3bd3lv,WDWolf,2,Sun Jun 28 02:07:50 2015 UTC,"Saboteur is really not a great upgrade, since it only works half the time, you need to be at range 1, you need to have already done significant damage, and it eats up actions you could be using to boost, evade, or focus.  I would drop Saboteur and the B-Wing's Flechette Torpedo and Ion Cannon. That frees up 7 points to put Luke Skywalker on Lando, making Lando much more deadly."

Wes is also incredibly good when shooting early.  The only ship that's coming to mind is Colonel Vessery. He really wants to shoot before his buddy spends the Target Lock. But, with Fire Control System and the new Advanced Targetting Computer, there's a lot of perpetual target locks, so it's not quite as big of a deal."

XWingTMG,3bcc0n,xwingsoverpittsburgh,2,Sat Jun 27 21:52:46 2015 UTC,"Personally I'd also give Vader ATC over Accuracy Corrector.  AC guarnatees you always get 2 hits.  With 2 dice, you have good odds of having at least 1 hit normally, and ATC gives you a crit, so you're already ahead of where you'd be with AC.  Add in predator for a reroll and you should be well ahead on average."
XWingTMG,3bcc0n,VanderLegion,1 point,Sat Jun 27 22:25:08 2015 UTC,"3 dodger lists are extremely hard to fly. In the opening pass, one of your ships is going to get very shot up. They work much better as 2 arc dodgers and one tank (Doomshuttle is common).  Also, Wingman on Vader won't be terribly useful. Arc dodgers need to fly independently of each other. If you try to stay in formation, you're boned."
XWingTMG,3bcc0n,bl1y,1 point,Sat Jun 27 22:09:20 2015 UTC,"In the opening pass, one of your ships is going to get very shot up.   That depends entirely on how you fly it.  Ideally, you'd most likely have your ships spread out.  If you fly it right, you would want to end up just outside of range 3 on the final round before combat starts, then the next round you can move in close enough to be able to boost/barrel roll to dodge arcs and not get shot in the first place."
XWingTMG,3bcc0n,VanderLegion,1 point,Sat Jun 27 22:23:58 2015 UTC,"Yes, ideally you want someone who doesn't know how to fly against arc dodgers."
XWingTMG,3bcc0n,bl1y,1 point,Sat Jun 27 22:33:37 2015 UTC,"Didn't say it would be perfect, or even that it would necessarily work.   Just that it's the ideal.  That or if you're spread out, as soon as you know which way the opponent is going (for instance last escalation tournament I flew a doomshuttle sith interceptors) you can adjust from there.  At said tournament, I'd start the shuttle in the center, then split interceptors right and left and at different ranges.  Almost every turned to go after soontir on the right, at which point I can run him away instead of charging straight in while the others move in from behind.  On the other hand, if I can dodge arcs to where I only have 1 ship shooting at me, odds are you won't get THAT shot up.  Especially if you don't ahve to both boost and BR to do it, leaving you an action for a focus or evade (or both if you're soontir or possibly turr phennir).  Edit: That article also seems to ignore PTL.  In the first image with the 3 x-wings and the royal guard interceptor doing the bank then boost and still not being out of arc, it's possible (can't go try it myself right atm) that if you were to bank right then barrel roll left-foward it would actually get past the rear x-wings arc as well."
XWingTMG,3bcc0n,VanderLegion,1 point,Sat Jun 27 22:41:32 2015 UTC,"Just speaking from experience, I've flown 3 X-Wings in about 50 tournament games, and with a loose formation I slaughter arc dodgers easily. 2 arc dodgers with a tank eats me alive."
XWingTMG,3bcc0n,bl1y,1 point,Sat Jun 27 23:04:05 2015 UTC,"So my idea with the Wingman was that as they are swarming behind the enemy squadron, it gives me flexibility by opening options other than green maneuvers every turn with my TIE-Interceptors while still regularly PTLing them. Looking at this after stepping away, you are definitely right, the guaranteed 4 hits in one turn from missiles just isn't worth 4 points and I should use the crits instead (Although front-loading them doesn't make me the happiest, so I'm tempted to take Autothrusters on Carnor instead so that both the interceptors are safer from turrets.)   I hadn't thought of the Shuttle as an anvil for the comp, and may experiment switching Vader for that.  As far as having Wingman as a support ability to the swarm, does anyone have thoughts on the amount of flexibility that would give?  EDIT: It seems the consensus is that it's not worth, so I'll be dropping Wingman."
XWingTMG,3bcc0n,Dakkon_B,1 point,Sun Jun 28 04:30:22 2015 UTC,"I would cut the Cluster Missiles and Wingman on Vader. Cluster is ok but not the best on Vader. Wingman is really tough since Arc Dodgers tend to spread out and fly very independent as the situation changes.   Keep in mind Arc Dodger squads are really tough on new players. I also started out playing in a similar style an its rough. 1 mistake and you can easily lose a ship. Also Jax is amazing at range 1 but he also gets focused fired (plus he is at range 1) I would recommend Turr Phennir with VI, it maybe just me but I have had very good luck with him."
XWingTMG,3bbs4g,gaffergamgee,11,Sat Jun 27 18:36:27 2015 UTC,"From the FAQ:   A ship with Damaged Sensor Array assigned to it can still perform actions granted by Upgrade cards (such as Marksmanship, Expert Handling, Lando Calrissian, or Ysanne Isard) or pilot abilities (such as Jake Farrell), so long as those actions are not listed in that ship’s action bar.   The Jake part is telling. What I think this means if that Jake's ability could let him perform a free barrel roll, but not a free boost, because boost is one of the things listed on his action bar.  If this is correct, then Night Beast would not get the free Focus action, since it's one of the actions listed on his action bar. Damaged Sensor Array doesn't have any language limiting it to the Perform Action step."

XWingTMG,3bbs4g,antigrapist,2,Sat Jun 27 18:52:20 2015 UTC,skill/card given actions are not actionbar actions unless they are specifically conferred to your actionbar (Such as engine upgrades)
XWingTMG,3bbs4g,boredompwndu,-6,Sat Jun 27 23:18:49 2015 UTC,"""You cannot perform the actions listed in your action bar"" means just that.  When it is time for you to decide which action you will take, you count as having no actions in your action bar. This does not preclude you from being able to take any free action that any upgrade or ability would grant you.  That critical effect does not suppress your pilot skill.  Any ability that grants you a free action does not require that you'd be able to perform that action beforehand.  In short: yes, you can still make use of the free action given to you by your pilot ability."
XWingTMG,3bbs4g,ilikexwing,2,Sat Jun 27 18:55:51 2015 UTC,"I don't think that's correct. You can still perform actions with a damaged sensor array, you just can't perform any of the actions in  your action bar, and because Night Beast has the focus action in his action bar, he can't perform that action."
XWingTMG,3bbs4g,lilphizzle,2,Sun Jun 28 01:01:51 2015 UTC,"Right. ""Free action"" means that it's free of the requirement of the action being in your action bar and does not spend your ""action"" that turn; and it does not stipulate that you can perform the action, merely to perform it.  Anything preventing you from performing it still prevents it, such as a general block on actions that are on the action bar, regardless of the source of the action."
XWingTMG,3bbs4g,Sybmorres,2,Sun Jun 28 05:14:24 2015 UTC,"This is wrong.  ""You cannot perform the actions listed in your action bar"" means just that.   Nightbeast gets a free focus action.

There's nowhere written anything about ""count as having no actions in your action bar"" or ""not preclude from being able to take any free action."" You're interpretating, instead of taking the card texts literally.  If the action is not listed in your action bar, you can still perform the action though.    Ysanne Isard grants a free evade action to the Decimator Evade is NOT listed in the action bar.  Damaged Sensor Arrays does NOT prevent you from taking this free evade action."

EI   Farrel looks fine except that he doesn't have Autothrusters.   Overall I'm a bit concerned that with only three small ships that your list has a real glass jaw. Each of your elite pilots seems a bit squeezed for points too since Farrell doesn't have AT and Keyan lacks PtL. Two As with only two attack dice is a bit weak too.

I haven been trying several iterations of that list and so far this is the most solid I've found for this particular combination of ships, bit still I'm unsure, I just love those 3 pilots but I'm not that sure they are competitive enough together."

I might try stay on target instead of Opportunist and advanced sensors instead of fcs but then Gunner doesn't get to keep a target lock.
XWingTMG,3bbce2,FunkyHat112,1 point,Sat Jun 27 18:32:40 2015 UTC,"While there are probably things to change around with the builds of each ship, my largest concern is just the ships. A-wings are neither durable nor do they have good firepower (proton rockets being one possible way to address that). A single B-wing is easy to focus down, it's when there are multiples that its durability begins to show. 3 ship lists always have problems, and that's exacerbated by the fact that the A-wing brings so little to the table."
XWingTMG,3bbce2,Glubger,1 point,Sat Jun 27 20:19:21 2015 UTC,"It's true, but Awings are durable if you play them with having always a dodge token, and at close quarters they can deal some damage"
XWingTMG,3bca7j,Jimmars,1 point,Sat Jun 27 21:19:40 2015 UTC,"It's hard to say, due to how the campaign works.  The biggest ship-sink is Mission 8. You'll need 3 Rebel Transports, and enough ships to fill an additional 200 points, and the Imperials need 250 points of ships.  Missions 1-3 are a bit harder to quantify, due to how the Rebel player picks their squads. For the campaign, the Rebel player makes a list of 9 ships comprising of 200 points of unique pilots and upgrades, with a secondary list of upgrades, termed ""Resources"", then makes smaller squads for each mission by combining some of those ships with Resources into a list.  You would need at least 7 different types of ships for the Rebel fleet, with at least a couple of heavy hitters (B-wings and E-wings work well).  The Imp player just makes a squad up to 200 points, so there's no specific ship restrictions, so you'll just need enough ships to make a 250pt squad."
XWingTMG,3bc9kc,Dibatis,1 point,Sat Jun 27 21:13:38 2015 UTC,"If Chirpy gets close and personal with the enemy ships, the Mercenary Copilot is useless, as it only works at range 3. Also Chirpys passive wants him to be at range 1-2, not a good synergy. Mara Jade only works at range 1, Tactitian only at range 2. That's also not good. I'd scrap both Tactitian and Merc.

XWingTMG,3bc9kc,Nomnomnicon,1 point,Sun Jun 28 04:10:29 2015 UTC,"I never like Gunner mixed with other acuracy assistance tricks - the FCS will make you hit often enough that 5pts for a second attack isn't that often triggered. Taking into account Whisper's 4-5 Attack Dice you average 3 hits, one of which will probably get through. And if people see you have gunner they're likely to let on hit through rather than spend a token to avoid it only to risk more hits on the next roll. But I see gunner a lot in lists so maybe I'm the one who's wrong....  BUT if you trade him out you can get an Engine Upgrade on RAC, making him capable of dodging arcs while still having a shot back.   I agree with /u/fl1p_problems - specialise rather than generalise otherwise you'll find at all ranges that you're...mediocre. Better to hit like a truck at a particular range (probably range one with Deci's)."

I got 3' square of 26 gauge sheet metal to stick under my mat and some 0.5"" square magnets to attach to the bottoms of the bases and made my own magnetic system.  It works beautifully, strong enough that I can play vertically up and down a wall if I want.  My only issue is that I'm still trying to find a strong enough double-sided tape, since the stuff I have has released once or twice (though sticking it back on usually works fine).

XWingTMG,3bamog,fl1p_problems,9,Sat Jun 27 11:07:39 2015 UTC,"Well, an Omicron Group Pilot is 21 points and with Vader, it's 24 points. A Bounty Hunter is 33 with a Vader putting it at 36. Both have 10 life to throw at Vader. I think it's the 12 points that do it."
XWingTMG,3bamog,RoguishAlpaca,5,Sat Jun 27 11:11:34 2015 UTC,Having vader in a shuttle also attracts enemy fire to an otherwise uninteresting target.  This allows you to flank or charge distracted opponents with 75 points of ships.  If they ignore the shuttle it can place some strategic crits where they don't want them which can make the 24 points worth it.    With 36 points you reduce this effect.
XWingTMG,3bamog,beer_demon,3,Sat Jun 27 12:24:56 2015 UTC,Firesprays are too costly in points and too valuable in extended combat to suicide them with Darth Vader. The shuttle is ideal because it typically only makes one pass early on and one pass very late. Vader makes the shots that matter hit harder.
XWingTMG,3bamog,Ryddari,1 point,Sat Jun 27 14:24:07 2015 UTC,"You do also occasionally see Vader flown on a Decimator. The turret and large amount of HP make it an interesting way to use it though quite more expensive.

XWingTMG,3ba79y,BrandCAG,2,Sat Jun 27 06:52:47 2015 UTC,Getting a 2nd Core set is a better option for most players who are going to want the extra ships/templates/rocks.  Lots more bang for your buck
XWingTMG,3ba79y,A6AvantRay,1 point,Sat Jun 27 14:36:43 2015 UTC,"In the ~8 months I've been playing I've never once felt the need for a second core set.  The ONLY thing I'd really care about from it is the extra dice (which my friend has a core set as well so we just combine our dice anyway and I borrow his for tournaments).  I've never felt the need for a third (or fourth now that I have the GR75) X-wing, and personally haven't felt like flying a tie swarm and have never needed more than the 3 tie fighters I have wih 1 core and the TIE fighter expansion."
XWingTMG,3ba79y,VanderLegion,1 point,Sat Jun 27 16:39:11 2015 UTC,"The ships aren't the biggest part of the core set; the damage deck is. For proper games each person needs their own 33 card damage deck, and it can't be shared between two people.  It also helps to have another set of templates and rocks, such that a friend can borrow some of your stuff and have everything needed to fly in a tournament without preventing you from doing so."
XWingTMG,3ba79y,darth_static,1 point,Sun Jun 28 02:14:43 2015 UTC,"I disagree.  For casual play, you don't need 2 damage decks.  You aren't going to go through an entire 33 card damage deck usually (we've never used 2 damage decks in casual play and never come close to running out of damage cards), and the effect on crits isn't going to be a big enough difference to matter for casual play.  If a friend is serious enough about the game to be willing to pay to go to tournaments, eh can buy his own core set to get the damage deck and templates, etc.  I don't mind lending ships or cards if a friend wants to use them for a tournmaent, but I don't feel the need to finance their entire experience.  He can at least buy his own core set."

XWingTMG,3ba79y,Holmelunden,0,Sat Jun 27 06:58:50 2015 UTC,In the long run the best solution really is to get a second Core set :)
XWingTMG,3ba79y,VanderLegion,2,Sat Jun 27 07:04:47 2015 UTC,"IMO, it's only really worth getting 2 core sets anymore if you want to run tie swarms and need the extra tie fighters.  Almost no one runs 3-4 X-wings to need that extra ship and personally I've never even felt the need for more than the 3 tie fighters I have.  I've never once needed an extra set of maneuver templates, asteroids or damage deck, so the only other thing that you get with a second core is the dice, which can easily be aquired cheaper from the dice pack if you don't need the ships."
XWingTMG,3ba79y,Holmelunden,1 point,Sat Jun 27 16:41:21 2015 UTC,Well I play Empire so the 2 extra Tiefighters imo where a must(and i got 3 coresets to max out my Ties) and  the extra dice was also needed.

XWingTMG,3b8rma,sacimino40,6,Fri Jun 26 22:01:17 2015 UTC,"Vader's definitely pretty awesome. I'm not sure he really needs the Prockets, though, since they don't synergize with ATC in any way. I'd rather have those 3 points spare to further upgrade something else I'm flying alongside him.  Tempest Squadron (the lowest PS generic) with Accuracy Corrector is going to be pretty interesting as well. You can put up to four of those in a list and still have some room for a TIE Fighter or a few other upgrades. 4xTempest Squadron + Accuracy Corrector + Cluster Missiles can destroy a Decimator in a single round, because you can use AC on the missiles to guarantee two hits on each of two attacks. 2 hits per attack x 2 attacks per pilot x 4 Tempests = 16 damage, with a chance for even more because you get to roll the dice first, then decide whether to use AC or not."
XWingTMG,3b8rma,EdgeOfDreams,1 point,Fri Jun 26 22:10:06 2015 UTC,"I like Prockets with the ATC as a kill shot. If you get yourself into range one with a focus on your target you have a 5 die focus/TL modified attack. Could be a nice touch, although as you said, it certainly isn't necessary."
XWingTMG,3b8rma,eunoiared,3,Fri Jun 26 22:18:27 2015 UTC,"ATC only help with your primary attack, though. So no synergy with Procket."
XWingTMG,3b8rma,MrSunol,1 point,Fri Jun 26 23:27:07 2015 UTC,"I know that, but you'll have a TL on the target so you can spend it for re rolls plus a focus."
XWingTMG,3b8rma,Thopterthallid,1 point,Sat Jun 27 00:32:39 2015 UTC,"For 3 points you get a TL-Focus 5 dice attack. Your odds for getting a hit are roughly 0.9 per dice, so just over 4.5 in total  Without it you would have 3-dice attack wit extra crit + focus. Your odds of hitting are 0.75 per dice, so 3.35 (when you include the crit).  It is up to you if you think the 3 points is worth the roughly 1 extra hit each game. Personally I would try to include it to get past a stealth interceptor or cloaked phantom, but I am not sad to drop it. If the meta changes back towards lower PS builds and away from glass cannons, then I wouldn't consider it."
XWingTMG,3b8rma,AffixBayonets,1 point,Sat Jun 27 05:57:57 2015 UTC,"Sorry I don't think I am being clear. I just think it would be fun to have a 5 die attack for the likes of soontir or whisper, or a devastating killshot to destroy a ship. It is absolutely the first thing off of Vader and I would absolutely not be sad to lose it."
XWingTMG,3b8rma,Shgrizz,3,Sat Jun 27 06:22:06 2015 UTC,"Juno's movement dial is actually BETTER than tie interceptors. She can perform EVERY maneuver in the game minus S-Loops and K-Turns at Speeds 1 or 2. This make her dial BETTER than Soontir Fel could EVER wish for.  Her straights are green up to 4, and her banks are green up to 2. Throw Engine Upgrade on her and suddenly she can boost and barrel roll into any position you could dream of. Proton Rockets gives her a 5 Attack dice option, and if you're flying Push the Limit, you can focus-lock to give yourself a damn good chance that you'll land all five hits in a single blow against a priority target. After that's all said and done, Accuracy Corrector makes her dealing consistent damage. Rolling guaranteed two hits is actually better than rolling 3 unmodified dice in the long run.  Juno is going to be the single most adaptable ship in the game. Veteran Instincts also might really benefit her ability, but I think I'd rather PTL her seeing as she's basically made of green moves."
XWingTMG,3b8rma,AffixBayonets,2,Sat Jun 27 05:57:29 2015 UTC,but the no turns green is a big deal. I'll try PTL and see how it works though.

XWingTMG,3b8rma,Dakkon_B,1 point,Sat Jun 27 00:36:26 2015 UTC,"Oooh, I hadn't considered the vessery synergy. A stock vessery will just about always attack with a free target lock if he's alongside an ATC Advanced. That actually makes him rather tempting at 35 points."

Stygium Particle Accelerator is similar in that it's a Modification with no restrictions, but it only makes sense to use on a ship that can cloak. We haven't seen a new cloaking ship yet, but it's clear that FFG has that option open to them. There's also the Scum's special astromech upgrades, which currently can only be used on the Scum Y-Wings but could appear on another ship in the future."
XWingTMG,3b8vgf,EdgeOfDreams,3,Fri Jun 26 22:40:17 2015 UTC,"Quite possible.  We could in the future see a ship like the Sith Infilitrator (not necessarily that but like that) getting the cloak action.  Likewise, we could see a ship like the Missile Boat show up and have the SLAM action."
XWingTMG,3b8vgf,rsixidor,2,Fri Jun 26 22:54:39 2015 UTC,"Came here to mention the Missile Boat. Unfortunately, the Punisher makes me think we might not see it."
XWingTMG,3b8vgf,bl1y,1 point,Sat Jun 27 22:11:25 2015 UTC,I have doubts we'll see any small ships for Imperial that aren't TIE-something.  And likely we won't see any large ships that could instead be TIEs.
XWingTMG,3b8vgf,rsixidor,1 point,Sun Jun 28 22:36:54 2015 UTC,"Very likely. When they released S&V and I saw that Outlaw Tech (when you do a red, get a stress) was marked Scum Only, Limited that was a dead giveaway that the next wave would contain a Scum ship with multiple crew slots."

XWingTMG,3b6s1l,LazyG,2,Fri Jun 26 15:53:19 2015 UTC,"That's the thing with this build, getting the tacticians to go off is just a perk. Its really just there to create a huge zone that acts as a deterrent. It went off from time to time, mostly after kturning the falcon. The real goal of the build is to grind up on something while shooting other things. The bump is a better way for me to deny actions. Makes the rest of my squad focus the bumped ship and move on after."

Finally got my second 2400 2 weeks ago, and put it into play.  I am currently 6-2 with the following:  Outer Space Fringer, HLC, Intel Agent, Antipursuit laser (all x2)  Green Squadron: Title, squad leader, adrenaline rush, chaardan refit.  The HLC's get used between 2 and 6 times per match, combined.  I usually spend most of my time using the intel agents to maximize my spacing with the barrel rolls, make people hit me and trigger the APL's, and then still get an offensive action donated from the Green (9 times out of 10 one of the big boys can make better use of the action than the little dude can).  The barrel rolls are pretty effective on their own, but with the intel agents, it ramps it up an order of magnitude, allows you to block more enemy ships with fewer of your own actions, etc....  14 points for the HLC's seems like a lot, but how many points would a half dozen 4-die attacks cost me if bought as missiles or torps?  And the way they make people have to choose between 4 dice or the APL's is just lovely.   Still need to flu it against a serious arc-dodger list, but it's fared well against everything else.  It simply eats 2-ship lists for lunch."
XWingTMG,3b6s1l,starslinger72,2,Sat Jun 27 04:44:09 2015 UTC,That is close to the old rebek convoy list of 2 ors and 2 gold squad with ion turrets. Stupid health and control with two large base ships to block with.
XWingTMG,3b6s1l,KasztanekChaosu,2,Fri Jun 26 14:29:30 2015 UTC,I like YT-2400 Wild Space Fringer for an APL carrier. With Intelligence Agent and Barrel Roll you can do a lot of nasty blocking.

BTL-A4 only in Most Wanted Blaster Turret only in HWK Shield Upgrade only in Millenium Falcon or Imperial Aces R7 Astromech only in E-Wing Hull Upgrade only in Imperial Aces or Star Viper Wes Janson only in Rebel Transport Squad Leader only in TIE Advance   Unless you are proxying, this is fairly expensive first list to put together.  Speaking of your actual squad, it's actually coming out to 100 points. You are going to run into problems having both Blaster Turret and R5-P9 on Dutch since they both take a focus to activate. Yes, you're getting one from Garvin, but still leaves you nothing to modify your rolls with. You probably don't need the Shield Upgrade, which would free up points to make it an Ion Turret instead."

I did not go and splash that much cash on my first purchase no. I was planning on proxying at first, and maybe try some other less cash expensive when not just playing friends in private. I was thinking R5-P9 as kind of a safe mode choice, but I guess ekstra offensive dice is probably worth more than regenerating a shield point either way.  So what -  Dutch [BTL-A4, ?? , ion-turret] Garven[??] Insert ship with fire-power here blue squad B-wing?   I want to include dutch and Garven together at least."

That said, I like y wings and x wings are demanding to play well but they can make a great list."
XWingTMG,3b8fqk,beer_demon,1 point,Fri Jun 26 21:28:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah that is a weakness of the list, although I believe either combination of x-wing and Dutch would still do okay. If I replac Wes with some less combo focussed ships like B-wings, it might be a more consistently good list?"

Kath Scarlet works like her pilot ability, increasing the accuracy of shots not coming out the front of a ship. Would be good for HWKs, Houndstooths, and the lower PS Firesprays.

Predator guarantees one re-roll always and two far more infrequently, possibly never depending on your opponent's list.  Kath would not necessarily trigger  as often, depending on your flying, but is more likely to give the two re-rolls. It would be interesting to play test this and see if it should be 3 points instead of 2."

On a hit, receive one damage.  Jettison Cargo: After ship has completed manoeuvre, place one debris marker at distance 1 behind. Discard after."
XWingTMG,3b745k,Zaknafean,4,Fri Jun 26 16:22:14 2015 UTC,I'm all for the Jettison Cargo. Maybe a small specific debris cloud for it? This could also work as a modification not just an illicit.

XWingTMG,3b745k,3rd_Charmer,5,Fri Jun 26 20:56:03 2015 UTC,"Just brainstorming here, probably some broken ones, hmm...  Illicit Mods:  Weapons Power Converter: This ship cannot perform Red maneuvers.  Increase your primary weapon value by 1.  Engine Power Converter: When you defending, you may reroll any number of die.  You may not reroll any die when attacking.  Slave Circuits: When you reveal your maneuver dial, you may change it to the maneuver of another friendly ship at range 1-2 that is also equipped with Slave Circuits (as long as the maneuver is available on your dial).  OR  When you reveal your maneuver dial, you may instead perform the maneuver of another friendly ship at range 1-2 that is also equipped with Slave Circuits, even if it is not available on your maneuver dial.

XWingTMG,3b745k,AffixBayonets,2,Fri Jun 26 15:13:22 2015 UTC,"I like option 3 for Slave Circuits - you can follow another ship, but if its not a maneuver for your ship you should definitely be stressed."

XWingTMG,3b745k,exonwarrior,5,Fri Jun 26 18:12:48 2015 UTC,"How about an illicit upgrade that conceals some of your upgrades from the enemy? Something like   Smuggler's Hold - 1 pt (Illicit)  Start the game with one(?) of your crew cards/system cards/munitions face-down and reveal it when you use it for the first time.   Something along these lines could be a fun way to bluff out your enemy, especially in the case of munitions.   Now, the enemy could intuit the cost of the hidden upgrade so the implementation would be a bit tough. As an alternative option, you could increase the points cost to an arbitrary amount between 1-5 that the player chooses and allow them to discard the card to pick up a ""hidden"" option for crew or munitions. That would be vastly more powerful though so you'd have to put a points surcharge over the original upgrade. Maybe you could choose anything worth 2 points less than the amount you spent on the card?"
XWingTMG,3b745k,AffixBayonets,6,Fri Jun 26 16:13:13 2015 UTC,So the alternate would be something like  Smuggler's Hold - 4 points (Illicit)  Discard at any time to add one (missile/bomb/crew/torpedo/mod?) Upgrade to your ship valued at 3 points or less.
XWingTMG,3b745k,exonwarrior,4,Fri Jun 26 16:39:57 2015 UTC,"I like that, that is a much better way to have a ""wildcard"" in play. But the max point cost being one less means it still comes at a cost.  Ninja edit: However, if say you have your version of Smuggler's Hold (4pts) and are at 100 points, which is then revealed for say Proton Rockets, does this mean you are now at 99 points? Or do you have to include both Smuggler's Hold AND Proton Rockets in your initial 100 point build?"
XWingTMG,3b745k,AffixBayonets,2,Fri Jun 26 17:25:10 2015 UTC,"You'd still be at starting points of 100. You don't go to 99 points if you use Adrenaline Rush or Inertial Dampeners, right? For point purposes the points for Hold would be spent and the new card would be free."

XWingTMG,3b745k,AffixBayonets,1 point,Fri Jun 26 18:24:38 2015 UTC,The problem with this is that you could choose any card to add to your squad in the middle of a game. That's extremely strong. You should have to pay more than 1 point to do that.
XWingTMG,3b745k,iwishiwasnerdier,2,Fri Jun 26 17:36:40 2015 UTC,"I'm not the original poster, but what if it also cost an action and/or added stress?   I mean, if it's in the secret hold it's not going to be loaded already."
XWingTMG,3b745k,AffixBayonets,1 point,Fri Jun 26 19:39:36 2015 UTC,The old version would require you to buy the other card separately and the one point would merely be to conceal it.
XWingTMG,3b745k,iwishiwasnerdier,1 point,Fri Jun 26 17:41:43 2015 UTC,I think it would be better to reveal a card underneath it to make sure you can't buy any card at any time or increase the cost by a bit. Either way it's a cool card idea.
XWingTMG,3b745k,AffixBayonets,2,Fri Jun 26 18:01:54 2015 UTC,"Well I thought about tournaments, and in one of those simply hiding a card would be ineffective after round 1. Increasing the cost works though - it could always be a 5 point card that could be exchanged for a 3 point or less munition or crew option."
XWingTMG,3b745k,Neuvost,3,Fri Jun 26 18:08:02 2015 UTC,Well maybe there's a middle ground. After deployment place a mod/missile etc under this and reveal it at any point of the game. That way you can change it between games but not choose any in the middle of a game if you know what i mean.
XWingTMG,3b745k,AffixBayonets,5,Fri Jun 26 18:17:14 2015 UTC,"Yeah, good idea — this seems fair. The idea is that what your Scum is smuggling is secret and concealed from your foe, not that you can change your mind mid battle.   Plus, many of us don't see the upcoming munitions buffs benefiting single-slot carriers like the Scum Z-95 or Starviper. Smuggler's Hold could allow you to use that slot sometimes in a tournament when it's useful but not have to commit every time."

XWingTMG,3b745k,thebaronvonanonymous,1 point,Sat Jun 27 03:59:37 2015 UTC,"The cards definitely need playtesting but I don't think they are too crazy. Twitchy is very strong but he has a lot of extra points associated with him.  To get your activation phase attack, you need to bring at least 2 points. If you want that attack up to two times, you have to bring extra munitions for 2 more points.  Seismic charge and proton bomb are dropped before you move. This means that that high priority target already had to have been in attack range last turn.  While proximity mine allows you to move then attack, you still need your action to get the shot.   Finally, unmodified 3 attack dice have a 55% chance of missing completely against 3 unmodified defense dice.  2 attack dice miss the same target more than 70% of the time."

XWingTMG,3b745k,AffixBayonets,2,Sat Jun 27 13:20:21 2015 UTC,"It's the ability to change deployment after you've gathered a bit more information, and potentially set up for a stern chase early. The token thing was to give an opponent a bit more information. As it stands it can't be inside their deployment sonze because range 1 of something range 2 from the table edge (i.e. an obstacle) can be at best within range 1 of the table edge, and that defines the edge of the opponent's deployment zone.  That's quite a lot of text.  Probably better reduced to -   Do not deploy this ship as normal.

Have a game plan or strategy in mind and stick to it.  Adapt your tactics as needed, but stick to the strategy.  If you feel you're getting reactive, take a deep breath, rethink your plan, and get back on track.  Have fun"
XWingTMG,3b7xfi,T-Minus9,2,Fri Jun 26 19:53:39 2015 UTC,"Good choice on list, four Bs are fairly forgiving to fly, and AS is just icing on the cake.  I've only been in a couple of tournaments, but here's what I've learnt:   Take snacks and beverages. Sure, there may be stuff for purchase at your FLGS, but it'll be expensive, and most likely leave you with greasy fingers. Plus they don't give much time for breaks, so the chance to sit down and relax is very welcome. Plus water is good for you, and it's mandatory if the aircon isn't functional. Remember what upgrades your ships have. This isn't so much an issue for you, but when you've got Echo and Chiraneu, it's always a good idea to remember that you've got Ruthlessness on Chirpy, and the opponent's ships aren't within range 1 but your Echo is. Similarly, remember what upgrades your opponent has. Standard procedure for tournaments is to show your squad to your opponent just before flying; take this opportunity to look for any dangers. e.g. if you see Assault Missiles or Ion Torps, you'll need to avoid flying close together or suffer a massive hit. Ion Cannons/Turrets, plan one round ahead in case they get the ion off. Sensor Jammer - you'll need Focus.  Make sure you roll and modify dice in order, and declare everything. Attack rolls, defender modifies, attacker modifies. Defense rolls, attacker modifies, defender modifies. Take your time and try not to get rushed, but at the same time don't stall. You don't want to be hurried into a decision you won't regret, but at the same time you don't want to be accused of intentionally delaying to waste time. Make sure your damage deck is accurate beforehand. You don't want to get kicked out of the tournament just cause you're missing a couple of Direct Hits or something. There's 7 Direct Hits, 9 pairs of Ship crits, and 4 pairs of Pilot crits. Pick out your obstacles beforehand, and take a picture of them or mark them so you know which are yours. Each core set has 6 unique rocks, and there's 6 unique debris tokens in the VT-49 and YT-2400 sets. Not a good idea to lose one of them, or worse end up with duplicates. Adv Sensor Focus to 2 K-Turn is evil, and if you're in a tight spot you can BR instead of Focus for more evilness. If you're flying in formation, you can use bumps with AS to prevent your ships from going too far. If there's a rule dispute, call over a TO. That's what they're there for."

XWingTMG,3b7n3g,exonwarrior,3,Fri Jun 26 16:59:24 2015 UTC,I have had quite a bit of luck running opportunist on Keyan Farlander in combination with Wes Janson. Wes strips the token allowing Opp to be used while Keyan gets an extra shot and generates his own stress to use with his pilot ability. Sorry if it's not really an answer to your question. Just my two cents.

With lando you can roll 2, then push the limit for whatever you didn't roll and need. So possibly 2 evades with lando, ptl evade via title."
XWingTMG,3b8q25,ernesto__-,1 point,Fri Jun 26 23:20:17 2015 UTC,Or if you want something different from PTL you could always use experimental interface to gain the same effect for Lando. Then you can have predator for the ept upgrade. I like predator on Han because it gives him more faux target lock options.
XWingTMG,3b8q25,DangerFord,1 point,Fri Jun 26 23:47:36 2015 UTC,"But what happens if you focus and you need lando to give you evades and you end up with 2 more focus rolls? Lando before is better, that way you always have at least one of whichever you need."
XWingTMG,3b8q25,ernesto__-,1 point,Fri Jun 26 23:54:38 2015 UTC,"That's why you prioritize with the first action. Either take the evade or focus, whichever one you need, then experimental interface for whatever extra you get from Lando. If you have another crew slot open on another ship then I might consider taking Jan, effectively guaranteeing another evade if you roll a focus to Lando and really want evade instead. I feel like he's most useful when you have a way of turtling up before using Lando."

Targeting Computer on the other hand lets him get way more bite out of three reds.   Regarding the Bounty Hunter how do you feel about Recon Specialist or Tactician?"
XWingTMG,3b8m5c,branniganbginagain,1 point,Fri Jun 26 21:50:36 2015 UTC,"Recon specialist has been on my mind lately, I just haven't picked up the expansions with him in it yet. I've had a bit of luck with gunner but he's so damn expensive."
XWingTMG,3b8m5c,Ryddari,1 point,Fri Jun 26 21:55:42 2015 UTC,"Gunner is most advantageous against high agility ships. If you aren't fighting one, you're not going to proc it very often. So it's a roll of the dice (heh) as to whether or not it will be worth the five points. Recon on the other hand is always good. Being able to focus for both offense and defense rocks."
XWingTMG,3b8m5c,pksullivan,3,Fri Jun 26 22:46:20 2015 UTC,"So what about switching gunner for recon specialist, dropping the stealth on the AP, and trading an AP for Backstabber"

XWingTMG,3b8ddd,ColonelCrabcake,3,Fri Jun 26 20:09:38 2015 UTC,"To play them competitively, you will want to use autothrusters  from the Starviper expansion.  The upgrade willake a huge difference in the ability to survive against turrets.  Since they do so much better when they move after everyone else, the ace pilots see the most play.  Soontir Fel from the Interceptor expansion is the most popular, but Carnor Jax sees a lot of play as well, and others are still competitive."
XWingTMG,3b8ddd,scuff,2,Fri Jun 26 20:24:48 2015 UTC,"Plus if you like interceptors, you'll enjoy the star viper. Similar action bar but you can have such goodies line the hot shot blaster."

XWingTMG,3b8ddd,Droofus,2,Sat Jun 27 02:55:36 2015 UTC,"I'd recommend getting an interceptor expansion, mostly for the pilots, Soontir Fel and Turr Phennir. Both great fun to use. You can then run triple squint, which is challenging but tremendous fun. I wouldn't recommend going to 4 interceptors, as you'll very rarely get to use them all unless you're playing epic scale.   Lt. Lorrir is sadly hampered by his lack of elite pilot slot for push the limit, which is more or less mandatory on interceptors. I can't think of any situation in which I'd rather spend 23 points on Lorrir than 24 on a Saber Squadron pilot with PTL. But it's your game, and you can do what you like!  TL;DR Interceptors are great fun, best taken in threes"
XWingTMG,3b8ddd,Shgrizz,2,Fri Jun 26 20:30:50 2015 UTC,"Soontir Fel + Title + Push The Limit + Autothrusters + Stealth Device  35 point initiative bid  Kill his weakest ship asap, and flee for the remainder of the match."
XWingTMG,3b8ddd,Thopterthallid,1 point,Fri Jun 26 20:49:43 2015 UTC,I've seen lists at our store championship that would fold to this tactic.  ... but I still wouldn't recommend it.
XWingTMG,3b8ddd,Korlus,1 point,Fri Jun 26 21:26:18 2015 UTC,"Three interceptors should be the most you need, most of the time. With a four-interceptor list, you just don't have enough room to get very many upgrades or named pilots, unfortunately.  Since you mentioned Lt. Lorrir, I'm assuming you have the Imperial Aces pack. If so, you really should get the standalone TIE Interceptor pack for your third Interceptor, because it comes with different pilots. Specifically, Soontir Fel, who comes in that pack, is generally considered one of the best pilots in the game.  Lt. Lorrir is not commonly used in tournaments, but he's certainly playable in a casual environment. PTL Royal Guards are probably a bit better, but not enough that you should stop flying Lorrir if you're having fun with him. If you really like his strange barrel rolls, though, you should consider getting a TIE Phantom and flying Echo, who does something similar with his special decloaking pilot ability, and is considered more competitive in the tournament scene.  As far as point costs go, Interceptors are really mid-range. Yes, they're expensive compared to a TIE Fighter, but Fighters are the cheapest ship in the game. A Firespray has a minimum cost of 33, for example, and often costs over 50 points for a named pilot with a good number of upgrades.  The most common way for people to fly Interceptors is as a single flanker (almost always Soontir Fel) supporting a swarm of small ships or a single large ship. There's also some good lists for trios, such as Soontir + Turr Phenir + Carnor Jax, each kitted out with upgrades. I've also seen an oddball list of four PTL Saber Squadrons together, with Autothrusters on a couple of them, but that seemed a much tougher list to fly effectively."
XWingTMG,3b8ddd,EdgeOfDreams,1 point,Fri Jun 26 20:32:57 2015 UTC,"I have three, I don't see myself using four ever, but I really like the one pilot, I believe it's turr... He can boost or barrel roll after he attacks"

Stripping the paint seems to just be too much work for too little gain. Supposedly, if you use relatively thin coats, the detail on the models won't suffer too much from the multiple layers of paint."
XWingTMG,3b8dam,EdgeOfDreams,1 point,Fri Jun 26 20:36:11 2015 UTC,Many thanks! This is exactly the kind of answer I was hoping for.
XWingTMG,3b8dam,siddacious,2,Fri Jun 26 20:37:34 2015 UTC,"I've only painted one at this point, but I went right over the existing paint. The results look good, though I did have a minor issue of masking tape lifting the new coat. This might be able to be mitigated by washing the mini first and making sure you give the coat time to try, neither of which I did because I was impatient.  I'll note that if you're doing a light coat over dark, it can be challenging to get good coverage with thin coats without using an airbrush. You'll need to properly thin your paints and take it slowly."
XWingTMG,3b8dam,quarrel,1 point,Fri Jun 26 22:13:25 2015 UTC,"The paint FFG uses is so thin and so hard to remove that stripping is usually not only unnecessary but ineffective. That said, gentler stuff like Simple Green can dissolve away some of the factory black wash, and that will give you ever-so-slightly better detail in the cracks when you go to apply your own wash."

XWingTMG,3b3qjm,asmeus,10,Thu Jun 25 18:47:23 2015 UTC,"That is an interesting question. It doesn't appear to be answered by the FAQ.  My best guess is that the answer would be no, you can't do that. The reasoning is based on the use of the word ""another"" by comparison to other upgrades and pilot cards. If a pilot card says, ""When a friendly ship <blah blah blah>"", then that effect applies to the pilot himself, but if it says ""When another friendly ship <blah blah blah>"", then it only applies to other ships, not the pilot himself.  So, going by that, since Stay on Target says ""another"", the maneuver you rotate to has to be different from the one you revealed.  That said, you might be able to get away with it in casual play. If you want to try this in a tournament, I'd ask the TO how they'd rule."
XWingTMG,3b3qjm,EdgeOfDreams,8,Thu Jun 25 18:55:30 2015 UTC,"I agree, you must change your maneuver in order to make it red.  However, a simple fix to this is never select the maneuver you intend to use, then always change it.  It might get you in to trouble when you actually WANT to do that maneuver, but that should be the rare occurrence."
XWingTMG,3b3qjm,3rd_Charmer,11,Thu Jun 25 19:43:00 2015 UTC,You just always put in a 2K. Then rotate to any 2 manoeuvre or take the 2K.
XWingTMG,3b3qjm,Ginjasy,3,Thu Jun 25 19:27:07 2015 UTC,This is the correct answer.  That way you can react properly to your opponent's ships.
XWingTMG,3b3qjm,rsixidor,5,Thu Jun 25 21:47:14 2015 UTC,"It says another maneuver.  You don't have to use Stay on Target of course, but you don't get the stress from it unless you switch it.  If you want to be stressed, choose a 2K, and then you can change it to any other 2 (B-wing has all options at 2)"
XWingTMG,3b3qjm,scuff,2,Thu Jun 25 19:17:04 2015 UTC,"I could be wrong here, but if the text of the card says ""You may do X"", it means you have the option of doing it. If it says ""Do X"", then you have no choice.  So in this case it says you may, it doesn't mean that you have to. You can keep your original maneuver and no stress if it's not red.  Compare that to PTL. You may perform another action, but you don't have to if you don't want the stress.  Instead of focusing on the word ""another"" as /u/EdgeOfDreams is suggesting, I think the key wording here is ""You may"".  Edit: Did not read carefully. If you're trying to keep the same maneuver and stress yourself on purpose, then no. There's where the ""another"" wording comes into to play :p"
XWingTMG,3b3qjm,Maverick0,1 point,Thu Jun 25 19:27:09 2015 UTC,"Regards to your edit, this is why your choice on the dial should always be 2K."
XWingTMG,3b3qjm,rsixidor,2,Thu Jun 25 21:48:35 2015 UTC,"You always program a 2K. It's already red, so that's fine, and the 2 speeds give you the most options."

XWingTMG,3b3qjm,rsixidor,1 point,Thu Jun 25 21:47:55 2015 UTC,no.  you must choose another maneuver if you want to trigger the stress.  alternatively you could run navigator crew and pick any move you want except the one you choose- in which case i would always have a red on the dial.

Yes, Jendon can give TL to ships that can't normally take the action like interceptors and phantoms, he passes the blue TL as opposed to say giving a free TL action.   No, a 2 straight by the TIE won't clear the flacon even though the Falcon's base is 2 long, the nubs count for bumping, so the nubs on both bases would still overlap, so the TIE would bounce back to the start position."
XWingTMG,3b5j52,T-Minus9,3,Fri Jun 26 04:03:56 2015 UTC,"he passes the blue TL as opposed to say giving a free TL action.   Even if it said give a free TL action it would work as long as it didn't specify aything about the action being on the ships bar.  It's the same way Ysanne Isard works for the Decimator.  The Decimator doesn't have the evade action on its bar, but she still gives it a free evade action."

XWingTMG,3b338q,3rd_Charmer,5,Thu Jun 25 18:14:35 2015 UTC,"Perhaps try Cluster Missiles instead of Homing.  Won't get your rerolls on blank die due to having to spend the target lock, but it could be devastating to lower-agility ships like Falcons, Decimators and B/Y-Wings.  Imagine a Falcon facing 3-4 concentrated Cluster Missiles in a single round.  That's like... 24 focus-modified die, which should equate to about 18 hits/crits across 8 attacks, Falcon would defend with 8 die and have an average of around... 4 evades, maybe?  So that's approximately 14 hits that would get through.  13 health on the Falcon: that's a dead Falcon.  Decimator has 16 health, but no agility, so those 18 average hits would still kill it."

XWingTMG,3b338q,rsixidor,1 point,Thu Jun 25 18:19:07 2015 UTC,"Definitely a problem with the higher-agility ships, I agree.  But at only 8 health even they can fall surprisingly easily to a concentrated attack of cluster missiles.  They can only get so lucky with 3 unmodified agility die."

XWingTMG,3b0d5m,Latorre666,2,Thu Jun 25 05:38:04 2015 UTC,"With a bit of prising, the top comes off pretty easily. I'd recommend cutting underneath the protruding bit that comes off the side as it is the hardest bit to split.  I was prepared to magnetise the two bits together with some earth magnets, but if you're careful enough prising, the two bits clip back together pretty firmly. You'll need to clip out the previously glued struts to make it manageable to open and shut.  I drilled a hole for the EL wire at each end and simply threaded it through. EL wire glows with no heat, so simply gluing to the inside is fine. It's powered by a CR2032 battery inside a small driver, which fits in the compartment nicely. No resistors needed."

XWingTMG,3b0d5m,jonboyjon1990,2,Thu Jun 25 03:44:21 2015 UTC,Cockpit. The airlocks have a double layer where top and bottom overlap that really help hold it together when shut.

Magic from my understanding is the meat and potatoes of many stores and its rare for a LGS to not run magic in some way or another. Now not all stores that sell magic have xwing players, but I think it is a pretty exhaustive list to start with. Then call the phone numbers provided or check their website.

XWingTMG,3b38ho,scuff,1 point,Thu Jun 25 17:05:38 2015 UTC,https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/forum/292-x-wing-organized-play/ - that forum on the official Fantasy Flight Games site has listings for groups that play regularly in any given area. Most of them play at game stores that have tables in the back or something like that.
XWingTMG,3b3u7y,Palitir,2,Thu Jun 25 19:14:41 2015 UTC,I like them both- i think the first list is more balanced with two jousters and the king of arch-dodgers.  with advanced sensors you are  going to be taking a lot of greens but with echo's dial thats no real big deal.

XWingTMG,3b3u7y,skiduck,1 point,Thu Jun 25 21:32:13 2015 UTC,"it looks like fun, but with the PS6 you have to worry about the following meta lists that may attack you while you are decloaked;  Any fat dash lists, IG-88 Lists(unless you did an initiative bid), chernieu fel lists, whisper soontir lists,s any whisper lists, any han lists, any corran horn lists.  i think it is strong, but with most turreted meta ships being at >PS6 you have an uphill battle."
XWingTMG,3b3u7y,ThrobRinkor,2,Fri Jun 26 00:40:46 2015 UTC,"personally,  I would put veteran instincts on echo, save up 2 points for something else. maybe drop advanced sensors and pick up Fire control systems. then give soontir stealth device"
XWingTMG,3b3u7y,skiduck,1 point,Thu Jun 25 20:21:34 2015 UTC,Is it worth loosing the manoeuvrability on echo for the ps boost?  I'm torn as I would build stealth on both interceptors normally
XWingTMG,3b3u7y,ThrobRinkor,2,Thu Jun 25 21:34:09 2015 UTC,"you would have the same maneuverability if you used advanced sensors, you just couldn't take a second action."

XWingTMG,3aznha,Tvayumat,5,Wed Jun 24 23:54:08 2015 UTC,"Nice work, very clean.  The cloaking effect on the front of the Phantom is cool and dynamic, you can picture the effect crawling back over the hull as it flies."
XWingTMG,3aznha,Tvayumat,4,Wed Jun 24 20:19:13 2015 UTC,"Thanks! I've seen the cloak done a few times, but it's always just done over the original paint, which I'm not a fan of."
XWingTMG,3aznha,Tvayumat,1 point,Wed Jun 24 20:45:15 2015 UTC,"So, did you strip the phantom prior to repainting?  If so, can I ask what process you used, and whether the stripping and priming was worth it?  I ask because so far I've just been repainting over original paint jobs. What detail loss I've had has been my own fault and fairly minor."
XWingTMG,3aznha,Tvayumat,1 point,Fri Jun 26 00:38:47 2015 UTC,"No stripping. I airbrushed the base coat on over the original. I try and use the cheapy hobby store paint for a lot of the small details, but for the base coats, I use the more expensive Testors acrylic, as it goes on very thin, but coats well, so there's a very minor loss of detail. I have no idea what the models are made out of, so I'm not brave enough to dip them in acetone or other solvents for fear of destroying them."
XWingTMG,3aznha,MythicalMothman,1 point,Fri Jun 26 03:00:18 2015 UTC,That explains the super thin basecoat.  I'm actually glad to hear/see that. I was going to take an airbrush to my Firespray tomorrow and was pondering stripping first but it looks like I won't need to.
XWingTMG,3aznha,leewardstyle,1 point,Fri Jun 26 03:40:11 2015 UTC,"Just be careful and do a bunch of thin coats. I hit one of my xwings a little too heavy with a base coat today, and lost some cockpit detail. It doesn't take much. I'd give a good 30 seconds or minute between the coats. It's actually kind of nice, as it gives you some time to rub any buildup off your needle before you spray again."
XWingTMG,3aznha,earlofhoundstooth,1 point,Fri Jun 26 04:45:21 2015 UTC,Have you found the pre existing paint to work as a decent primer for airbrush acrylic?
XWingTMG,3aznha,exonwarrior,1 point,Fri Jun 26 06:56:48 2015 UTC,"Actually yes! I've tried airbrushing the same acrylics right onto other models before (tanks, helicopters, etc.), and they just don't stick well at all without either primer or sanding. The only thing I make sure of is that I blow some compressed air all over the models first, to make sure there's no dust, hair, or other particles that could get buried under the paint. Other than that, I just spray it on, and it sticks great."
XWingTMG,3aznha,fl1p_problems,6,Fri Jun 26 07:05:47 2015 UTC,Very nice! The Phantom's lightning in particular looks better than a lot of the paint jobs out there.

There is Etahn abaht for he rebels, but he takes the points of three+ bandits, and isn't quite as effective for that reason.

XWingTMG,3b2sf5,skiduck,1 point,Thu Jun 25 15:57:15 2015 UTC,3x HLC + FCS will make most opponents not want to joust with this list so the b's will survive quite long. My worry would be BBBBZ or another swarm list - which might make the PS 4 initiative bid worthwhile
XWingTMG,3b2lg2,Red_Blues,11,Thu Jun 25 13:39:57 2015 UTC,i personally would love to see the Wild Karrde
XWingTMG,3b2lg2,nyrmduck,5,Thu Jun 25 14:08:32 2015 UTC,"While I love the idea of the Wild Karrde from a gameplay perspective (so many unique technologies on that ship) I think the Star Jewel is a much more attractive model (and I'd love to have a Jabba crew card).  Basically I'm saying: FFG, just make both."
XWingTMG,3b2lg2,Karma_Payment_Plan,4,Thu Jun 25 14:24:57 2015 UTC,"I came here to post the Wild Karrde, maybe we would see an alternative Mara Jade card as well.  Talon Karrde was always a favorite of mine in the Extended Universe."
XWingTMG,3b2lg2,jbeano88,2,Thu Jun 25 15:25:27 2015 UTC,This is what I want to see
XWingTMG,3b2lg2,VanderLegion,2,Thu Jun 25 16:27:35 2015 UTC,"This, or something very similar, is available on Mel's minis. Something like 200 bucks, unpainted, some assembly required, no stats or cards or anything, but with enough time, money, and effort, you could manage it. Iirc there's a smaller one about the size of the Gr75 as well, plus the imperial gozanti cruiser which also fills a similar size niche.  Edit: now with 400% more links: Action VI transport, aka wild kardde, $110  A similar CR90-sized ship, $230  Gozanti, $100  And because he can, the nebulon b. $350 That's right, a full fucking capital ship. It's at 1/608 scale, compared to x-wing's standard 1/270, and it's still twice the size of a cr90."
XWingTMG,3b2lg2,AvarinSpectre,1 point,Thu Jun 25 21:10:12 2015 UTC,"Gozanti could be released twice, as well. Once for Imps, once for S&V."

XWingTMG,3b2lg2,AvarinSpectre,6,Thu Jun 25 21:48:31 2015 UTC,"Star Jewel is probably the most likely. But there is a CR-90 Renthal's Fist, and several GR-75's which could just be converted."

XWingTMG,3b2lg2,boredompwndu,3,Thu Jun 25 15:47:08 2015 UTC,We really need a reasonably priced generic star viper pilot with an EPT slot. Though I'd rather they not pull a tie-advance and bundle it with the huge ship. A scum aced maybe instead.

XWingTMG,3b2lg2,mxzf,3,Thu Jun 25 14:39:26 2015 UTC,"So a dreadnaught.    Unfortunately dreadnaughts are 600m long (4x as long as a CR-90).  Which is a lot too big for X-Wing's scale (to scale with the CR-90 a dreadnaught would be 1.3m long, 4.23')."
XWingTMG,3b2lg2,BullSquadron,2,Thu Jun 25 15:55:06 2015 UTC,I'd prefer the Mandolorian Crusader Gunship. A purely offensive Huge ship with little space for support/buff cards would be cool.
XWingTMG,3b2lg2,rsixidor,1 point,Thu Jun 25 17:23:47 2015 UTC,I assume it being a corvette that it wouldn't be much bigger than Raider / CR-90 yet Wookiepedia actually doesn't list a size. That's unusual.
XWingTMG,3b2ldo,Washout81,3,Thu Jun 25 13:39:17 2015 UTC,"So at Regionals there was an interesting build of Dash.  He ran HLC without Outrider, and used Lone Wolf.  He had to fly differently, but protected his range 1 donut hole by keeping his primary turret.  I think he ran Corran as his flanker."
XWingTMG,3b2ldo,Enervata,1 point,Thu Jun 25 15:37:09 2015 UTC,"I would love to run Corran, I always run PTL and EU on him. The only way that build will fit in 100 points is if you drop EU. I'd need more practice with him before that."
XWingTMG,3b2ldo,Enervata,1 point,Thu Jun 25 17:04:32 2015 UTC,"Here's what I'd probably go with if I ran the non-Outrider build:  Dash Rendar (36), Lone Wolf (2), Heavy Laser Cannon (7), Recon Specialist (3), Engine Upgrade (4)  Corran Horn (35), Push the Limit (3), Fire-Control System (2), R2-D2 (4), Engine Upgrade (4)  View the Squad List"
XWingTMG,3b2ldo,ernesto__-,2,Thu Jun 25 18:27:45 2015 UTC,"Fat Dash is always good, and since you have mangler you don't worry about range. In the heavy hitting large ship department of this list, I think you may want HLC. You already deal out unconcealed Crits with Ten (ten is a beautiful pilot) so you might as well slam them as much as possible, especially against other fat dash lists or decimator lists. I like what you have on ten. At regionals I ran a fat han with a stacked up ten like that, and I managed to make 14th thanks to some advanced sensors barrel rolls."
XWingTMG,3b2ldo,ernesto__-,1 point,Thu Jun 25 14:19:15 2015 UTC,I'll give the HLC some thought. I've actually play tested both on Dash and so far I prefer the Mangler because I don't turn into a turtle at range 1 and I can counter arc dodgers super well with a Mangler. Also if I go the HLC route I have to take VI off of Ten.

XWingTMG,3b1tcv,rook----,2,Thu Jun 25 07:41:47 2015 UTC,"Lonewolf + TC are kind of an odd combo.   you can't Boost+Barrel Roll w/o PTL, nor evade+focus, so your durability is limited.   Lonewolf needs to be active as much as possible, and so hopefully you'll have a built in re-roll most times on your attacks.   your action will be better spent on focus rather than TL in that case.  Not sure where it would be better to spend those points.     Honestly, Jax works better when used to help the rest of your list attack.   get him in close to the enemy and make them weaker to attacks from the rest of your list.   like /u/rsixidor said, this currently only works with Jax at R1, and the Blacks at R3.   drop lonewolf + TC and give him either PTL or Predator if you want to do something different.     I think the Blacks with predator look like lots of fun."
XWingTMG,3b1tcv,branniganbginagain,2,Thu Jun 25 12:55:45 2015 UTC,I do kind of like the idea of something other than PTL as it opens your dial up each turn... but the greens they have are so damn good... not sure it matters. Predator could be a good choice but PTL seems to be the best option.
XWingTMG,3b1tcv,rsixidor,2,Thu Jun 25 14:33:55 2015 UTC,I think predator is a decent choice.   keep your action for defense.  I just think Jax doesn't work well with lonewolf.   Turr's actually not a bad choice for lonewolf.
XWingTMG,3b1tcv,branniganbginagain,1 point,Thu Jun 25 14:52:42 2015 UTC,I always find myself throwing VI on Turr and for good reason. Shooting first and then arc-dodging is important to his survival rate.
XWingTMG,3b1tcv,rsixidor,1 point,Thu Jun 25 15:03:34 2015 UTC,"I've played almost this list before but hadn't considered Lone Wolf or Targeting Computer. Interesting choices.  Your intention is to always have the BSPs at range 3 of the target while Jax harasses them or do you intend to split targets so that the BSPs are shooting one target and Jax is shooting another?  My issue with the BSP is that once Jax went down, it's a pretty downhill game. The BSPs altogether can do a good bit of damage but there will be turns where you only get 1 hit out from each of them. 3 Agility ships will not have much issue dealing with this list. Soontir, Brobots, even Starvipers will be very capable once Jax is down. And Jax is the obvious target, one that you typically want to bring to them to get his effect. Against some lists, that's not a good idea.  However, this does look very fun to play. The version I played was extremely fun as well. My version was PTL, Autothrusters on Jax, the rest the same and I can say that it was extremely fun to play. You don't have quite as much arc-dodging with Lone Wolf but you can maybe increase his survival, so I don't think it's a bad choice.  Have you had a chance to play it against anyone yet? Is there strategy I'm missing?"
XWingTMG,3b1tcv,rsixidor,2,Thu Jun 25 12:49:32 2015 UTC,"My reason for lone wolf is indeed to increase survivability. Just try to outflank, get at range 1 and hammer away with the BSP's. I'm not sure I will be able to keep LW active. This is all theorycrafting though, I'm going to take it for a spin tonight, will report back."
XWingTMG,3b1tcv,rsixidor,1 point,Thu Jun 25 15:06:10 2015 UTC,Looking forward to it.
XWingTMG,3b1tcv,rsixidor,2,Thu Jun 25 15:08:55 2015 UTC,"Ok, so, played 3 games. LW and the swarm is not a good combo as /u/nomnomnicon, /u/scuff and u/branniganbginagain already said. I tried Jax/VI/AT/Stealth against RAC(8)/Fel and lost Jax pretty early to a unlucky roll and crit. Another build I was considering was Jax/Determination/AT/Stealth, but third game I swapped in Fel/PTL/AT and not having to move Jax at range 1 of stuff made for a much more relaxed game.   The swarm hits like a truck, they ate RAC, Leebo, Chewie and a Fringer. Taking evades because of predator is awesome and not having to fly in formation great as well."
XWingTMG,3b1tcv,Nomnomnicon,1 point,Fri Jun 26 06:51:06 2015 UTC,"I like Init bids. Somewhat amused by the idea of one of them taking Lone Wolf instead of Predator to get the 99 bid.

I've wanted to to try Pred BSP's before, but was going to run Whisper as my other craft. The added expense meant I only got three though. I'd love to know how this flew!"

XWingTMG,3b21fg,leewardstyle,3,Thu Jun 25 22:07:35 2015 UTC,(Scum) KATH is a sneaky bomber. You pop that early K-TURN to joust with your rear-arc bonus; and you're in a really good position to bomb the next turn.

XWingTMG,3b21fg,PCGamerPirate,3,Thu Jun 25 12:26:25 2015 UTC,Lower PS bombers prefer to use proximity mines (and probably the upcoming cluster bombs) because targets haven't moved yet. A seismic charge is still pretty good at deterring certain moves though. You are also forcing them to take actions to avoid one damage rather than increase their offense/defense with focus or target lock.

XWingTMG,3b21fg,OFTHEHILLPEOPLE,2,Thu Jun 25 12:20:44 2015 UTC,Or depending on what bombs you are using...   Anticipate Lower PS
XWingTMG,3b21fg,T-Minus9,1 point,Thu Jun 25 14:55:39 2015 UTC,"It's hard with bombers to actually bomb people.    The best time to drop a bomb is late game, or at the very least the second pass.  By that point, the opponent has usually forgotten about the bomb, and is actually likely to land some damage.  Of course, this leads to a concern, TIE bombers are relatively sturdy with 6hp, but still, it's hard to actually keep all of them alive to the second pass, let alone the late game to really hit home with the sugary delights.    I find Firesprays (particularly given they have a rear arc) are great for the late game bombing run."
XWingTMG,3b21fg,Enervata,2,Thu Jun 25 12:48:57 2015 UTC,When a Bomber gets focus fired your best option is usually to drop your bomb and break off that Bomber.  Your opponent usually won't chase the Bomber anymore so he gets to come back and fight some more.

Since ze bomb explodes instantly and isn't working, perhaps we get a longer lasting cake that waits for them to come to it?  Realistically speaking, bombs are hard to pull off effectively, since its going to be pretty obvious when/if you're about to drop a bomb. It gets harder as an imperial since your ships naturally move a lot faster than rebel and scum ships. If you REALLY like bombs, check out Emon Azzameen, the scum firepsray, otherwise, your going to have to figure out a way to blindside people into flying into your bombs."

XWingTMG,3b0tr5,baronsmeg,2,Thu Jun 25 01:39:16 2015 UTC,"I think you almost want EU on talonbane. The YV is already a fast ship, and I don't think it will get as much use from EU as Talonbane can. Torkil doesn't need Outlaw tech nearly as much as Latts, she can get some serious use out of it combo'd with K4. TLs when you green, focus when you full stop. Seems perfect.  Weapons engineer, outlaw and K4 make Latts a slow rolling monster."
XWingTMG,3b0tr5,PlayerNine,1 point,Thu Jun 25 15:06:10 2015 UTC,I agree with the recommendation of Engine Upgrade on Talonbane.  To fully take advantage of his high PS you'll want some way to reposition him after everyone else moves.

I Think I'm gonna try Talonbane First like you suggested. My thinking for Latts was that If I slow roll with green maneuvers, I can boost to catch up, and get free target-locks out of it.   Again for the outlaw tech, I was thinking Trokil so that I wouldn't have a round without being able to focus to fire the turret, but I can easily move the crew over to Latts, as I wasn't really thinking about the full stop.

XWingTMG,3ayorn,MysteriousRacer_X,2,Wed Jun 24 17:57:08 2015 UTC,"I'm starting to become more and more of a fan of single IG-2000 builds. I'd revisit how you have yours equiped though. IMO, IG-88B is a must have in a two ship list, you'll need to be able to do consistent damage. With B, it would probably be worth looking at Fire Control System over Enhanced Scopes. If you take FCS, then predator could be replaced. Also, I'm not sure about feedback array, I'd hate to self-inflict damage to my 51 point ship. And with Autothursters and a HLC, you'll want to keep plenty of distance from your opponents.  Emon is a blast, his ability can really catch people off guard. Plus Firesprays are just plain good.  Here's my take on the list - but ultimately, the best way to know whether or not something works is just by trying it!  IG-88 and Emon  Edit: Fixed the link"
XWingTMG,3ayorn,KTreu42,1 point,Wed Jun 24 17:38:08 2015 UTC,"You make a good point about the feedback array, but I've found that it comes in very useful for dealing with glass cannon aces like Soontir and Whisper.  Also, I don't think your IG-88B would miss very often and so his pilot ability might never be used in a match.  I boost very frequently and it is nice to get that free evade with IG-88C."
XWingTMG,3ayorn,CaryinTacoma,2,Wed Jun 24 19:30:30 2015 UTC,"Feedback array is super-useful against those highly agile, low health ships, no doubt about it. I'd think that Fel and Whisper would usually be able to stay out of range 1 though with the aggressor moving at PS 5. IG 88 B actually really helps against those pilots specifically. Shoot once to strip tokens, then again against the unguarded ship, now with a TL, and maybe even with 5 dice from opportunist. But IG 88 C is awesome too, that free evade can add a lot of health to the Aggressor."
XWingTMG,3b00vf,cassarlex,3,Wed Jun 24 21:43:07 2015 UTC,"If I were using Autoblaster on Kavil, I want PTL.  Engine Upgrade gets you in range, but then you want to ensure you're hitting stuff with a focus or TL.    Also, I would dump the clusters and MF's on the Pirates and take N'Dru as one of them.  His Clusters and Hot Shots are so much more potent with Lone Wolf and a focus token. You can still focus the same target with them, but just keep N'Dru on the opposite side and try to pincer your target.   FYI, if you throw a hull upgrade on N'Dru and keep him at range effectively, you have a PS-7 X-Wing for 1 point less than a Rookie Pilot.  Add Lone Wolf and a Hot Shot or Clusters, and you are still cheaper than a PS 7+ X-Wing with a lot more firepower and defense thanks to LW.  I think he's incredible for the value."
XWingTMG,3b00vf,KTreu42,1 point,Thu Jun 25 03:31:29 2015 UTC,"I tried a list similar to this a few weeks ago. On paper you fly in the Z's and try to alpha something off the board quickly. In reality it didn't work that well. You have 3 really squishy ships that need to position (w/TL) to fire their missiles, then they are like less maneuverable Tie fighters. The Hot Shot blasters helped me a bit, but the Y-Wing needs to be in range 1 of something to hit with the Autoblaster so you will be more times then not shooting your 2 dice primary at something.  I found that it lacked the maneuverability to work for this intended purpose. After your missiles are gone (and they may not hit hard if the dice gods hate you) your damage output is severely gimped.  Any high hit point list is going to outlast you. Whether it be B-Wings, or fat turrets, you may find that you are just lacking firepower."

Ie, Kavil with blaster turret, aggressor astromech for free target locks, and give inertial dampeners to another ship. 100 points."

XWingTMG,3aycx7,karlvon5020,2,Wed Jun 24 14:16:52 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I'd strip off most of those upgrades and just roll with a third blue. Keyan likes the Advanced Sensors and Stay on Target, which is good for anti-arc-dodgers, provided you're moving after them. If you're not doing PTL, you can then drop the E2 and Jan Ors. So it would end up being Keyan with AS and Stay on Target, and three naked blues. I'd be tempted to give that a try. I tend to only like the ion cannons if they're going to be coupled with the Tactician for the stress+ion combo, or if they're on a turret for the Y-wing or HWK, but that may be personal preference."

Bandit  With this build, I keep Leebo and Jan at range 3 with as many asteroids between them as possible. The  360 HLC means i can usually focus more on defensive positioning. With Jan's help, Leebo can usually drop a fighter in one shot. He attacks at 5 dice, ignoring cover and range modifiers.

XWingTMG,3az4au,X-factor103,8,Wed Jun 24 17:41:49 2015 UTC,"Hey, I'm the one who's maintaining the module (since the advent of wave 3). I probably have around 450 games played on VASSAL, so I'll take the initiative of answering your questions.  Is it easy? VASSAL requires a tiny bit of general computer knowledge, demands you plow through a few unintuitive bits of user interface in its awful JAVA frontend app look, but as with everything, it becomes much easier after a handful of games played. Hundreds of people have spent the required time to learn the interface and stick with its community. You can do it too.  Estimating distances: Having a perfect top down view feels different compared to the tabletop experience, but it will force a useful skill - estimating distances relative to the size of a ship's base. This skill is transferable to the tabletop and can only help your game in time.  New players: as long as you're upfront about being a new player, ie, announcing it straight up in the game room name you create (like ""new player LFG"") and ask people if they mind you finding your way around, you should have no trouble having people obliging you. A lot of players are helpful and are conscious that a new influx of player is a good thing. I've personally helped dozens of people, some who don't ever come back, but that's life. A ton more have stayed.  Moving ships when you bump: since v5.3.0 (fairly recent, released in the last 2-3 months), there's a semi-automated way to deal with it. Perform the move as normal, have your ship overlap, hit the 'C' key right away and a maneuver template will be placed automatically behind your ship, using its last movement in order to place the perfect one. Then, you can adjust your ship by drag and dropping it with the mouse. You can finely adjust it with left/right arrows for rotations (15 degrees per keystroke) or even finer with CTRL-left arrow and CTRL-right arrow (1 degree per keystroke). You can also adjust its position with Shift-arrows (up, down, left right, for translations). All those shortcuts can be found in the ""How To & Shortcuts"" menu inside the vassal module as you play, there's a pulldown menu listing the categories of help and they show you graphical aides for all aspects of play. These images can be spawned into the table or into your player hand, just like any token.  Hope this helps, feel free to ask more questions. Looking forward to seeing you there."

XWingTMG,3az4au,Mu0n,3,Tue Jun 30 14:56:24 2015 UTC,"I've played face-to-face a good bit over the last few months, but I turned to VASSAL this week for the first time to get a couple more games squeezed into my free time after work in the evenings.   How tough is it to play a game of X-wing on VASSAL?   I found it pretty easy. I haven't learned the keyboard shortcuts yet, so I'm still doing most stuff by menu, but I find the menus not too hard to navigate. You have to build up some habits (e.g. hide your dial before you start setting it to the maneuver you want, so your opponent can't watch), but with more experience those get easier and easier. I think I might go print out the reference pictures that it has included in the module to make keyboard shortcuts easier to learn.   Do you have difficulties learning to estimate distances on the game screen map?   I had a little trouble - in my first Vassal game, I flew a B-Wing right onto a debris cloud on the second turn of the game. However, I think any skill you've picked up from doing it at the table will transfer over. I like to visualize my moves in terms of base sizes. For example, when I'm planning a 2 forward, I imagine two copies of my ship lined up in front of my existing ship, knowing that I'll end up exactly on the far side of those. If you read some articles about how movement works and practice visualization, you'll get better quickly.   Do you wait long for a game?   I have yet to wait more than 5-10 minutes for a game, but then I've always been logging on in the evening, west coast U.S. time, so there were plenty of players. Other times might not be as populated. I just log in and either set myself to ""Looking for game"" or send a PM to someone else who has that flag set and we get rolling.   How forgiving is the community to new players learning the interface?   In my experience, I just let my opponent know that I'm new before the game starts and they've been very helpful and polite about it.   Is it particularly annoying to manually move ships when bumping?   Only moderately annoying. There's some tools the game has to show the movement template and help you figure out where you should end up, but it still involves turning your ship in increments of a couple degrees at a time and dragging it around until everything lines up. It's probably the worst aspect of Vassal, but since it's not terrible, that actually tells you how good Vassal is overall."

A game usually takes a couple of hours to play, at least double a normal game.  I usually end up spending half of the time browsing reddit on my phone while I wait for my opponent.

XWingTMG,3az4au,rsixidor,1 point,Wed Jun 24 18:02:49 2015 UTC,"It's not bad. I find myself being able to estimate on Vassal better than I can IRL because you don't have issues like accidentally moving your ships slightly when you touch them.  As far as waiting for a game, every time I've looked there's 2-3 players looking for games and a ton of games being played. If there isn't anyone in the lobby, see if you can watch a game if you have time to wait longer.  So far, people have been forgiving to new players but be sure to let them know before the game. I've run into a least a few situations where the opponent had to finish in an hour and didn't want to play with a new-to-vassal player because of that.  And even if you don't actually play on Vassal, it's a ncie tool for figuring out formation manuevers."

It speeds up the game a lot. I would say that the gameplay with vassal is even faster as with the physical features.

XWingTMG,3axqn4,Rudithus,1 point,Wed Jun 24 10:09:30 2015 UTC,So Fettigator may choose any bank maneuver anytime? thats awesome.  Why Echo over Whisper? for the wonky decloaks? Whisper will give you a Focus after hitting though.  A HLC on Fett sounds about right though.
XWingTMG,3axqn4,fl1p_problems,1 point,Wed Jun 24 10:21:19 2015 UTC,Well Echo is more unpredictable than Whisper and since I'm getting decoy instead of VI pilot skill doesn't matter. I've always thought Echo's only disadvantage to whisper was his pilot skill.  Do you think that extra focus token might make up for a more predictable decloak?  Also Echo's decloak might help me keep her closer to fett
XWingTMG,3axqn4,Rory_braker,1 point,Wed Jun 24 10:37:56 2015 UTC,"I love both these ships. But I would think that having to keep them close together would really hamper the unpredictability of fett (and echo). I have played fettigator with a doom shuttle and a stygium sigma with some success. The key was drawing people to fett while the others dealt damage. I think a phantom is a good match with him, but maybe whisper with vi, fcs and gunner? Space for HLC on fett."
XWingTMG,3axqn4,T-Minus9,1 point,Wed Jun 24 11:17:18 2015 UTC,"I think it's a good list, but you'll be hard pressed to keep them close enough to fire the decoy.  Either you'll hobble Fett to keep him near echo, or you'll hamper Echo's options to keep Fett's open.  I have never tried the list though, so play test it, see what it is missing, what would make it better, and how frequently you can properly arc dodge and still keep R2 for decoy."
XWingTMG,3axfni,LacklusterBrown,3,Wed Jun 24 07:29:23 2015 UTC,"Oiccun like that is tricky. It has a pretty great dial but PS4, and without any movement actions it can be hard to get into position. Yes he can use Intelligence Agent to check out a dial, but people will fly cautiously then boost/barrel to reach where they want to be. In that sense it might work by making people fly more cautiously, if you can capitalise on that in how us use Rexler Brath. Also the Dauntless title only lets you lock or focus as you have no other actions.   Instead I like the other build, Oiccun + Mara Jade, Engine Upgrade and Daredevil, for the same points as yours (52).  Unlike boost, Daredevil is a maneuver so it procs Oiccuns damage ability. In fact if you are clever you can cause damage twice as you can maneuver into one person, then daredevil into another (1 hard on a decimator covers a lot of ground). It also makes the Decimator more unpredictable in its end location. I also put Rebel Captive on mine  for extra stress :).   Either works, but depends how you like to fly. In a two ship list you can also consider Ruthlessness over intimidation in your list, especially versus swarms."
XWingTMG,3axfni,LazyG,1 point,Wed Jun 24 08:19:35 2015 UTC,I like that build too. I think I'll fly both and see which one I like better. Thanks for the input :)

XWingTMG,3awds4,pandorazboxx,1 point,Wed Jun 24 02:26:37 2015 UTC,"In the list i mentioned (now linked) above you have two turrets to help with dodgers. Your best bet is to get them in arc of Kavil plus something else in a turn. Kavil in this build out of arc is 4 dice with TL, which even if it does nto hit, strips tokens. After that anything you hit with ions. It is not perfect but it can take on dodgers."
XWingTMG,3awds4,LazyG,1 point,Wed Jun 24 08:04:04 2015 UTC,I run those two y-wings with 3 almost naked z95s. usually my opponent will take out kavil first and that btl-a4 ywing almost always gets the last shot.
XWingTMG,3awds4,Enervata,1 point,Wed Jun 24 02:36:30 2015 UTC,"You gotta point the BTLs at them so they prioritise them, and run kavil behind."

XWingTMG,3awds4,antigrapist,1 point,Wed Jun 24 14:10:02 2015 UTC,Yep then ideally once I know which way the enemies go I hard turn the other way to get the out of arc shot.
XWingTMG,3awds4,VanderLegion,3,Wed Jun 24 16:15:21 2015 UTC,"It does make Y-wings a lot better, and you should almost always put it on a PS2-4 Y. It's best combined with R3-A2 for the rebels to double stress any target at R1-2."
XWingTMG,3awds4,eunoiared,1 point,Wed Jun 24 01:36:33 2015 UTC,"This would give you two shots, but your focus/TL would be on one of them only   If you're flying scum y-wings you can use R4 agromech which gives you a Target Lock when you spend your focus.  So you can focus for the primary attack and have a TL for the secondary.  Or if you don't need the focus on the primary, you can spend it on the secondary to turn any eyeballs to hits (even if you have no eyeballs), then immediately use the TL you get to reroll any blanks."
XWingTMG,3awds4,larikia,1 point,Wed Jun 24 04:14:32 2015 UTC,"I was having fun running two of them with another big ship in the Scum faction. Two of them took down a whole list by themselves after the big ship went down. It's a list of VT-49, two academy Tie, and a Defender."
XWingTMG,3awds4,Enervata,1 point,Wed Jun 24 06:34:49 2015 UTC,BTL-A4 y-wings do great damage. Ion cannon turret is where it is at with them. Ion cannon turret's attack is more likely to deal a point of damage than the 3rd/4th die of just having 1 higher attack power. Adding the ion effect on top seals the deal.
XWingTMG,3awds4,rsixidor,1 point,Wed Jun 24 12:14:46 2015 UTC,"Scum Y's w/Unhinged + ICT + BTL is what I currently fly and I love them.  Their primary weakness is trying to stay in Range 1-2 against large ships with boost or barrel roll.  When Twin Laser Turret comes out the Y's will have a range 2-3 option available which will make them scary as all hell.  (Range 3 is really easy to maintain with Unhinged Y's.)  However I almost expect many Y's to run Twin Laser Turret without the BTL title because it'll be so strong.  (It'll be the equivalent of a 32 hit point large turret ship that attacks 8 times a round.)  When compared to B's, I'd say B's are a little friendlier to new players.  They have more shields (more crit resistant) and can be equipped with Advanced Sensors to make it easier to pilot them through obstacles.  However B's are less mobile and have fewer attacks than BTL Y's do, but they do hit harder.  In the current big ship meta here, I like being able to burn off tokens more and the occasional ion token getting through over the B.  But that's personal preference.  Both go down quickly under any dedicated focus fire."

XWingTMG,3avuh5,larikia,9,Tue Jun 23 22:40:18 2015 UTC,A game where both players walk away feeling good about how they played and impressed by their opponent...More so if you can tell stories about it.
XWingTMG,3avuh5,ithaka21,7,Tue Jun 23 22:46:34 2015 UTC,Basically any game where both players felt they had a shot at winning. Also sick maneuvers and crazy plays make for a fun game.
XWingTMG,3avuh5,NoChurch,5,Tue Jun 23 22:49:28 2015 UTC,Best games are the ones where it could go either way all the way till the last turn.
XWingTMG,3avuh5,pyromaster55,1 point,Tue Jun 23 23:55:18 2015 UTC,"This is it for me. Either this or a situation where one person is on top for the majority of the game.  Had a game recently go like this, it was a 100-pt three player casual match, I brought a Brobot list, one opponent had Soontir, Turr, Dark Curse and some other TIEs, the other had Wedge, Airen, Blount and a generic Z. The final round came down to Soontir and Turr against IG88-B, Turr managed to get the last hit through and I retaliated dropping him off the board. 300 points of ships in one match and the only one to survive was Soontir, one of the best games I've ever played."
XWingTMG,3avuh5,darth_static,3,Wed Jun 24 23:16:18 2015 UTC,"Generally, when the skills and squads of the two players are evenly matched, and the game's outcome seems to be primarily determined by skill (build choices, predicting moves, action choices, etc.) rather than luck and mistakes (extremely unusual dice rolls, landing on an asteroid, forgetting to use an upgrade, etc.). That said, I've still had games where unusual luck or mistakes were a big factor and make the game more fun, but that tends to be when the luck or mistakes favor the player who is currently the underdog, bringing the game back from one-sided to anyone-can-win.  Also, I have the most fun when both my own squad and my opponent's squad are new or unusual in some way, especially if I get to try out a strategy or card combo I haven't before, or have to adjust my strategies to account for opposition I haven't dealt with before."
XWingTMG,3avuh5,EdgeOfDreams,3,Tue Jun 23 22:46:03 2015 UTC,"My buddy and I played one last night.  3 named xwings (Luke, Wedge and Biggs) against Fel, Whisper and a royal guard tie.  Due to a couple of lucky dice rolls whisper got killed early by a volley from all 3, and the game carried on till it was down to Luke and Fel each with 1 hull left.  Fel won, but it was a great game.  Lots of strategy and very close all the way."

XWingTMG,3avuh5,Suicidal_Ferret,1 point,Wed Jun 24 05:18:15 2015 UTC,It might be a better match if a-wings had 3 attack dice.  Especially since tycho for instance is frequently a 10 PS so he'd get to move after the interceptors most of the time.
XWingTMG,3avuh5,VanderLegion,1 point,Wed Jun 24 05:31:15 2015 UTC,What would be a good match for squints? Similar dials and action bars?
XWingTMG,3avuh5,Suicidal_Ferret,1 point,Wed Jun 24 06:41:12 2015 UTC,"There really is no equivalent.  A-wings are the closest thing rebels have, with equivalent green maneuvers (have the hard turn green), but missing the barrel roll and 1 attack die less.  Scum's closest is probably the starviper, which has the same attack/defense and the boost/barrel roll.  It's missing the green hard turns though, with a couple extra health, but also lower PS named pilots.  you might be able to do a-wings vs interceptors just giving the rebels some extra a-wings."

XWingTMG,3avuh5,Burius81,1 point,Wed Jun 24 14:57:24 2015 UTC,"Best game I've played was a back a fourth tight fought game with only 1 hp remaining on the board.  Minor explosion was dealt, and the roll was evaded by ten numb to stay alive, next round of shooting ten rolls hit blank blank with a mangler (converted to crit) against a ig-88B for the killing blow."
XWingTMG,3avuh5,Theepum7,1 point,Wed Jun 24 01:59:07 2015 UTC,"I had a (mostly) fantastic game at a tournament last weekend.  It was an escalation tournament.  Second round I was flying a doomshuttle, soontir (thrusters/ptl/title/stealth) and carnor (ptl and thrusters).  Opponent was flying 3 PS4 scum y-wings with ion turret, title, R4 agromech and seismic charges.  Doomshuttle did it's job, got a crit on one of the y-wings with vader then next round was able to trigger vader to kill it.  Shuttle died after that, leaving soontir and carnor vs 2 y-wings.  I was an idiot and forgot soontir was stressed (hadn't PTLed every turn this game, happened to have done so the turn before).  Tried to k-turn and my opponent got to fly him off the board instead.  Left me with Carnor at 1 hp and double stressed (landed on a debris field) vs a full hp y-wing and another with a few hull left.  Was able to race carnor out of range for a couple turns to clear the stress then circle back around and arc-dodge for the remainder of the game to pull out the win.  I was able to deny any range 1-2 shots to them, though they got occasional range 3 shots at me.  Autothrusters and 4 defense dice were enough to protect me against those.  Finally came down to a final head to head joust at range 1 after I had him down to 1-2 hp, was able to kill him before he got to shoot back.  Game 3 was against a decimator with patrol leader with vader crew plus some friends.  I'd added Turr Phennir into the matchup.  Every single one of my interceptors was down to 1 hull when I finished off the decimator.  Both ended up being really good games.  To me a good game is generally one that comes down to being really close.  While it can be fun to occasionally just obliterate your opponent (and I'm all for doing that at tournaments for the MoV it gives you), I'd far rather in casual play have well matched games that could easily go either way depending on who flies better.  I've had several games flying Xizor that came down to xizor at 1 hp vs whatever final ship my opponent had up.  A couple of them came down to a head-to-head pass both at 1 hp, where I've had the higher PS to get the first shot."

Just a for fun list.  I rolled a hit 3 out of 3 times when rolling to remove stress with Porkins. Annoying... but acceptable.  Then I rolled blanks 5 out of 5 times when attempting to discard damage with the droid.  Freaking ridiculous.  That was not a good game."

My favorite game was in a tournament where my opponent and I were actually able to talk strategy mid-game (not in a way that led to advantage, but more a ""why'd you do that instead of this?"".  It came down to a final turn, with his Corran and wingmate against my nearly dead Soontir.   That was when we realized that if Soontir survived, and I could take out one of his ships . . . we'd tie.  We did.   It was SO exciting."

XWingTMG,3aum71,I_am_Hoban,2,Wed Jun 24 02:34:11 2015 UTC,Nice story and strategy article. Decisions such as which shot to take first are the kind of subtle differences that divide good play from great play.
XWingTMG,3aum71,EdgeOfDreams,2,Tue Jun 23 18:13:54 2015 UTC,"Thanks.  When I was running my 3 X-Wing list, I noticed one of the weaknesses was Wedge (w/Predator) being second in the shooting order. Wes was first, which is awesome for stripping tokens. Then Wedge, and finally Luke (with no offensive bonus). There were tons of situations where I really would have preferred Wedge shoot last. Sometimes it would be for landing crits, but often it was when there were 2 targets, and Luke might finish off the highest priority one on his own, but I couldn't risk it, so I had to overkill with Wedge.  I'm working on another post now along the lines of No Card Left Behind looking at Decoy and ships that actually want to shoot later. For instance, Rexlar's ability is best if he's last in line. Not only will the shields be down, but you need to strip defensive tokens to have a good chance of landing a hit without using your Focus token. I think if you pair someone like him with another pilot who would prefer to shoot much earlier (Garvin Dreis comes to mind), you could do some interesting stuff and really boost your pilot abilities."

XWingTMG,3atzib,PlayerNine,17,Tue Jun 23 14:23:00 2015 UTC,"The only way to really know what is up is playing lots of different people.  But some general things you should notice if you are getting better:  You are not hitting obstacles unintentionally.   Self explanatory.   You are not bumping your own ships unintentionally.   Bumping disrupts the orientation of your ships. It is extremely detrimental to formation flying. It also makes you lose actions and this is important because another way to track your progress is   You are getting actions   In a game about positioning and dice rolls you need to be able to modify the former, the latter, or both. While post maneuver positioning can be very effective, you have to make sure you can modify your dice rolls too because good players   Almost always have supported shots or dodges   Being able to change your initial dice roll is paramount to being a better player.   You are thinking about the next two turns   This is the ""level up"" moment for most players. It's not enough to think about where your ships will be this turn, but what options will they have next turn.   When it comes to list building, having a plan for major threats to your build is key. Build what you want, but have a plan for what is popular."
XWingTMG,3atzib,PCGamerPirate,2,Tue Jun 23 15:02:02 2015 UTC,"That is a good list. I have some additions:  You know all weaknesses and strengths of your list.   In knowing this you can adapt to enemy lists.   You know how to set up your ships in against the popular builds in the meta.   Setup is a very important part of the game. Read Paul Heavers ""Turn Zero"" series (there's 3 articles afaik) You know how to place your obstacles in a way favouring you. Again setup. Can't stress this enough."

XWingTMG,3atzib,shark2000br,1 point,Tue Jun 23 19:03:12 2015 UTC,"You are thinking about the next two turns   I got into this mindset by starting to think about what I'm going to do on turns three and four of a match.* This affected how I thought about asteroid placement, ship setup, lanes through obstacles, and the approach.  *In the general sense of ""what am I going to do when the ships start passing/bumping into each other"". It's not necessarily going to happen on turns three and four, but that's about the time frame."
XWingTMG,3atzib,Chad_Nine,2,Wed Jun 24 02:27:20 2015 UTC,"You want to ask yourself ""What could I have done differently that would have changed the outcome?""  But that's far from the end of the inquiry. Next you have to ask yourself what, at the time the decision was being made, should have clued you in to the proper choice.  The more obvious the clues, the more basic the mistakes. When it takes deep strategy to figure out why something you did was wrong, then you're progressing in skill.  Plus, not clipping rocks unintentionally."
XWingTMG,3atzib,bl1y,1 point,Tue Jun 23 17:17:41 2015 UTC,"Well that's great when you are starting to improve, but it when you have crossed a major skill threshold and your mistakes become less and less obvious, it doesn't do much in terms of self assessment.    When your win loss ratio with a given list is 50/3, but you know you need to somehow take it up a notch, that's the threshold we are looking at. How do you, as a skilled player, assess where you are and how to move forward?"
XWingTMG,3atzib,bl1y,2,Tue Jun 23 17:39:00 2015 UTC,"when you have crossed a major skill threshold and your mistakes become less and less obvious, it doesn't do much in terms of self assessment.   Yes, as you get better, your improvements will be smaller, and they'll be harder to come by. That's just the nature of getting better.  Another thing you can do is to start planning your moves 2-3 turns in advance. Obviously adjust your strategy when you see where everything actually ends up, but compare your prediction to what you really needed to do. As your predictions get closer, you're becoming better. Then plan 4 moves out. If you know to make a 2 bank now instead of a 3 bank because doing so prevents you from hitting a rock 2 turns from now, you're becoming very good at this game."

I started playing IG-88 on March 15, I managed to win a store championship without losing a ship that day. Since then I have logged at least 177 matches since then, using at least one aggressor. The night of the NJ regional, after the event, I retired Fett aggressor and played Brobots for the first time. That's when I started tracking my w/l with brobots."

XWingTMG,3av94u,skyshroudace,1 point,Wed Jun 24 13:58:00 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I think there are better options for pilots to pair with each other, and for how to equip each pilot. If you want to put more health on Corran, go shield upgrade to maximize the benefit of R2D2. I'd also revisit Advanced Sensors over Fire Control System. Normally I'd say it's a wash between the two, but FCS makes so much sense with Corran's ability. Gemmar can be tough to kill, but will have a hard time doing consistent damage. And with only 2 ships, you'll need consistent output. I'd try to take advantage of the second EPT, maybe outmaneuver or predator something like that? And the Y Wing just wont be able to keep up with the other ships, and isn't really survivable enough to hang out on its own. 8 HP is a lot, but they will go quickly with only 1 evade die."
XWingTMG,3av418,Torobasa,2,Tue Jun 23 19:18:25 2015 UTC,"SLAM is an action, so you wouldn't be able to use it along with Leebo, unless you had Experimental Interface or something like that. But then you'd be ioned and stressed...  But I digress. I think SLAM already makes the K Wing the fastest ship in the game, it can essentially perform a 9 forward when you consider the length of the base, which is just nuts.  Leebo as a crew has his place. He is only half the cost of an engine upgrade, and with a large ship you can use him twice before you suffer the effects of the ion. I think the bigger issue is that he takes up a crew slot, which has a lot of other great options."

XWingTMG,3aukhh,Suicidal_Ferret,1 point,Wed Jun 24 01:21:26 2015 UTC,Why not steal a page from Furball and just have it go 1 point for every damage dealt and 3 for every ship destroyed? Not quite sure how that'd translate to large base ships. Maybe 2 damage/6 kill?
XWingTMG,3ate0v,Nomnomnicon,1 point,Tue Jun 23 10:35:32 2015 UTC,"combining arcs on the space hippos to successfully doublestress/doubleion an enemy will be a real piloting challenge. Go ahead though.  Food for thought: If you can spare Actions on the Space Hippos now and then and go for a Target Lock on the focused enemy, you could consider switching Rexlar+Predator, to Vessery+VI, for a discount of four points.   That would allow for two FCS on the shuttles (did someone say Target Locks?), or a weapons engineer or the title on one of them. And Vessery with that free TL is just plain evil.  I love double Defenders myself, I am flying a 2xOnyx+HLC, Jonus squad at the moment, which is real fun to just punch big holes in anything that crosses their path."

XWingTMG,3atwek,sabermonk,2,Tue Jun 23 13:57:05 2015 UTC,"Side boards don't work in point based games. In magic you have a minimum deck size, not maximum. Also each card is worth in theory ""1 point"". So switching any two cards has no real impact on the total points. Finally, most magic games are played best of 3, so sideboards only impact games 2 and 3. If you only play 1 game and supposedly do not know what your opponent is flying the sideboard would have no point."
XWingTMG,3atwek,skyshroudace,1 point,Tue Jun 23 14:23:53 2015 UTC,Can you explain a bit more as to how you would see a sideboard working in X-Wing?
XWingTMG,3atwek,Berethrof,1 point,Tue Jun 23 14:06:11 2015 UTC,"I have no idea how it would work. I'm just asking if there is such a thing in Xwing at all. I've only read the rules from the Core Set, so I was curious if sideboarding was an advanced rule discussed in another set, or if the concept of sideboarding was simply not a part of Xwing."
XWingTMG,3atwek,jonboyjon1990,1 point,Tue Jun 23 14:11:43 2015 UTC,"It doesn't exist. Not 'officially' anyhow. The escalation format is similar, but not the same as a main deck+sideboard.   EDIT: I imagine, other than it just not being on the radar of the game, that the main reason for a lack of a sideboard in X-wing is that, rounds are just a single game, not best of 3 as in MTG.   So sideboarding would be more powerful in X-wing, as you'd get to change your list to your opponent immediately."
XWingTMG,3atwek,jonboyjon1990,1 point,Tue Jun 23 14:22:31 2015 UTC,"I've seen escalation mentioned elsewhere. That's the format where each match the point value for squads goes up, right?"
XWingTMG,3atwek,scuff,1 point,Tue Jun 23 14:23:51 2015 UTC,Rules  4 rounds:   60pts 90pts 120pts 150pts   All upgrades etc stay on each ship and each part of the list must continue from one round to the next.
XWingTMG,3atwek,EdgeOfDreams,2,Tue Jun 23 14:27:31 2015 UTC,Still really no sideboard.  In an escalation tournament you're supposed to have all 4 rounds submitted before the start.

Delta Squad Defender (Ion pulse missile, Mangler, Stealth Device) and Rear Admiral Chiraneau (Proton Bombs, Saboteur, Advanced Proton Torpedo, VI).  Turn 4, Deci drops the bomb, Guri gets caught in it and loses her shield.   This shouldn't have hit the shield.  If RAC had a proton bomb, it's a card dealt face-up to the ship.  It's the only attack that bypasses shields to deliver a critical.  Otherwise, great summary, thanks.  It's nice to read recaps like this."

XWingTMG,3apy69,Droofus,10,Tue Jun 23 18:37:25 2015 UTC,"Lots of positives. The dial is great, always happy to see the 1 turn. I think it's right in the sweet spot in terms of costing and both named pilots of really neat aggressive abilities. Lightning Reflexes is a great addition to the game. May not bump PtL from being the go to on Interceptors but would be a great addition to A-Wings with Test Pilot. I am liking the idea of Glitterstim on lower PS ships just to eek out another turn before their off the board."
XWingTMG,3apy69,pimplezoo,5,Mon Jun 22 16:44:06 2015 UTC,"Same, this ship comes with some great upgrades that are cheap, simple and easy to use.  I was hoping the Crack Shot card would get revealed (I mean, we already are 70% of the way there on knowing what it does), but the quality of the dial on this thing is crazy.  This feels like the dial X-Wings SHOULD have had... and the X-Wing dial what Y-Wings should have had (with the added red on the 3 turns).  And wow, 23 points for a EPT skill 5 generic?  Not bad!"
XWingTMG,3apy69,3rd_Charmer,5,Mon Jun 22 17:29:16 2015 UTC,Glitterstim seems pretty ridiculous on any ships with 3/2 or better stats. I ran a proxy game with it on Kath the other day where I popped when I knew they would focus fire her. It single-handedly prevented 4 damage and helped deal 2. For 2 points.

XWingTMG,3apy69,VanderLegion,3,Mon Jun 22 23:22:04 2015 UTC,I really think it could turn the tide on a game by keeping your blockers alive another turn or keep you Ace alive when being focused fired as per your example.
XWingTMG,3apy69,pimplezoo,3,Mon Jun 22 17:37:49 2015 UTC,"Agreed; there are some ships that have so many points sunk in to them that can perform incredibly, but ultimately fall to a single, timely, focused turn of fire.  Now the Kihraxz and Star Vipers can put those Illicit slots to perfect use to save themselves from the expected broadside they inevitably face and actually see some use!"
XWingTMG,3apy69,3rd_Charmer,5,Mon Jun 22 17:42:41 2015 UTC,"Glitterstim also is great for the occasion where you get blocked so you can't focus or evade or whatever for defense, even if it's only against 1 or 2 ships.  Pop glitterstim and you still get your focus for defense even without an action.  (Had soontir get oneshot at a tournament over the weekend when he got blocked so lost his actions meaning he couldn't evade or arc-dodge, then rolled 3 blank greens against a rear arc shot from kath)"
XWingTMG,3apy69,VanderLegion,1 point,Mon Jun 22 17:46:01 2015 UTC,Good call. Keeping your scum ace protected while bumped makes this a solid investment.
XWingTMG,3apy69,pimplezoo,3,Mon Jun 22 18:09:44 2015 UTC,Having Talonbane synergize so well with Glitterstim is also a solid design choice.
XWingTMG,3apy69,FunkyHat112,2,Mon Jun 22 17:48:04 2015 UTC,It's pretty nice for the initial joust as well.
XWingTMG,3apy69,Jimbobjeff,6,Mon Jun 22 20:49:31 2015 UTC,"Holy shit, they actually made them 20 points base. Didn't think they'd be ballsy enough for it. Looks like 5 of these might be the new BBBBZ."
XWingTMG,3apy69,FunkyHat112,6,Mon Jun 22 16:56:22 2015 UTC,All it says to me is X-Wings should have been the same way.
XWingTMG,3apy69,rsixidor,3,Mon Jun 22 16:57:25 2015 UTC,"Oh undoubtedly. The X-wing is definitely overcosted, and this is only barely less; despite my excitement, I could see these being left by the wayside (much like the StarViper has been). They have potential, though."
XWingTMG,3apy69,FunkyHat112,3,Mon Jun 22 17:02:12 2015 UTC,"5 of the PS2 will be a good list.  4 of the PS5 could be good depending on what two points of upgrades you can throw on there. If it could run Predator I'd say it's set but 1 point too many. The named pilots are good, though the PS6 is underwhelming without an EPT. Talonbane Cobra is definitely going to see play. That's just a great ability."
XWingTMG,3apy69,rsixidor,1 point,Mon Jun 22 17:29:55 2015 UTC,"I agree the X wing is slightly over costed, but not nearly as badly as people are making it out to be. The basic ps2 kihraxz is 1 point less than the X wing equivalent. Sure it means you can't take 5 basic x wings, but in all other respects they're barely different."
XWingTMG,3apy69,Shgrizz,2,Mon Jun 22 22:29:36 2015 UTC,"The Xwing sees almost no competitive play for a reason. It's pretty bad. Now you can do whatever you want in casual, and the game is mostly determined by how well you fly, buuuut yeah."
XWingTMG,3apy69,FunkyHat112,2,Mon Jun 22 22:53:17 2015 UTC,"It's interesting to see this statement when there have been 22 top 8 lists including at least one X-Wing flown in the regionals we have reports for in this FFG forum thread (Notice that the Summary post on there has not been updated in some time, you've actually got to look at the lists for numbers.)  I don't think ""almost no play"" is quite right. They've yet to find a list that anyone can pick up and fly into a top 8 spot though I think this one in particular, which won the Mesa, Arizone regionals, is incredibly good and well thought out:  Wedge + R2-D2 + Draw Their Fire + Shield Upgrade; Biggs; Gold + Ion Cannon Turret + BTL-A4 + R3-A2; Bandit"
XWingTMG,3apy69,rsixidor,1 point,Tue Jun 23 13:19:29 2015 UTC,"'Almost no competitive play' was meant relatively; every single ship sees play, no matter how overcosted. And don't get me wrong, the X-wing is certainly doing better than some other ships like the A-wing, HWK, or TIE Advanced. After all, the X-wing has a couple important role-players. Wedge does an amazing job against some of the popular ships right now, and Biggs has a unique ability which is hard to accurately cost. With all that said, being present in ~5% of the lists is not very promising, especially since it's the flagship for this game (and the IP as a whole) and thus is going to naturally be overrepresented.  I think the tell is not just the X-wing's representation, but what happens to that representation as tournaments get more competitive. Going with Lists Juggler's stats, the store champs season has ~5.2% representation. Regionals has ~3.5%. Now, that's partially just due to the changing meta with Scum and Autothrusters (after all, many big turrets also went down, and Interceptors got a noticeable bump). However, we can control for that by comparing elimination round lists versus the general lists for each individual season. During the Store Champs the general representation was 5.2%, during elimination it dropped to 3.4%. For the Regionals that are in there so far, the X-wing goes from 3.5% to 2.66%.  If a ship constantly drops in representation as the less competitive ships get weeded out, it's probably for a reason."
XWingTMG,3apy69,FunkyHat112,1 point,Tue Jun 23 14:50:31 2015 UTC,"I'm looking forward to seeing the Mesa, Arizona full report. Someone on the FFG forum was saying there was lots of Wedge+Outmaneuver as turret hate. If they were there, they didn't make top 8, though. So, hmm."
XWingTMG,3apy69,rsixidor,1 point,Tue Jun 23 16:33:12 2015 UTC,Wedge + Outmaneuver is also kinda silly when a huge portion of the turrets out there are Decimators.
XWingTMG,3apy69,FunkyHat112,1 point,Tue Jun 23 16:47:25 2015 UTC,Dash and Han/Chewie are out there plenty. And you try to be range 3 of deci if you can manage it so it still does something.
XWingTMG,3apy69,rsixidor,1 point,Tue Jun 23 17:12:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you're probably right. After playing the X wing a fair bit, I think it's barely over costed, but I guess it's not part of the tournament meta for a reason. I'm hoping the meta branches out a bit soon, as it seems to be balanced on a big base knife edge at the moment."
XWingTMG,3apy69,Shgrizz,2,Mon Jun 22 23:42:28 2015 UTC,"It is ""barely"" overcosted, as in it's only 1 or 2 points too high (probably just 1), but that 1 point makes a big difference. For example, this new ship letting you run 5 of them. In fact, the general consensus has been that the x-wing is 21 points for exactly that reason: so that you can't run 5 of them. In a game where you're often scrounging for an extra point or two to fit an upgrade, overcosting a ship by 1 point makes a big deal."
XWingTMG,3apy69,tractgildart,0,Tue Jun 23 01:01:31 2015 UTC,Title which makes Astromech 1 pts cheaper would solve the X-wings problems imo.
XWingTMG,3apy69,Holmelunden,0,Tue Jun 23 07:24:55 2015 UTC,"No it wouldn't, because part of the complaint is that you CAN'T run 5 generics.  Which doesn't make a difference if the title only affects astromechs."
XWingTMG,3apy69,VanderLegion,1 point,Tue Jun 23 16:16:49 2015 UTC,5 generic X-Wings would not be balanced. Try matching 5 X-Wings against 8 Tiefighters.

XWingTMG,3apy69,Neuvost,9,Mon Jun 22 17:55:43 2015 UTC,I find it kind of disappointing how the article keeps talking about how great the x-wing is and how scum wanted something just as good. It's like they're equating the in-universe x-wing to the in-game kihraxz.

Juno doesn' get a different dial from other tie advanced, she has the exact same maneuvers on her dial as everyone else.  She just gets to MODIFY her move after revealing the dial.  The same will be true of Inertial Dampeners, or anything else that lets you change your maneuver.  They let you do a maneuver that is not on your dial, they don't ADD the maneuver to your dial."

XWingTMG,3apy69,alemondemon,2,Mon Jun 22 18:47:58 2015 UTC,4 cartel marauders with glitterstim and a binayre pirate.  By my head maths (someone please correct me if I'm wrong) assuming you have the initiative you easily out joust 4BZ.
XWingTMG,3apy69,Jimbobjeff,2,Mon Jun 22 18:57:48 2015 UTC,Why do you think it would out joust 4bz?
XWingTMG,3apy69,stmack,2,Mon Jun 22 19:35:26 2015 UTC,"Everyone takes a target lock and the marauders pop glitterstim.  At range 2 that's 12 shots, 10 hits, 4 separate attacks so the B wings roll 4 defence dice, assuming they're all targeting the same B wing and he uses his focus defensively that's 14/8 dodges, this leaves 8 2/8 damage through = dead B wing.  This only leaves 3 B wings to shoot back. whether or not they focussed/target locked that comes to 6 hits. Regardless of what they shoot at the scum player rolls a total of 6 defence dice .  If they shoot the binayre pirate (which I think is the smart thing to do here) that comes to 18/8 dodges = 3 3/4 damage total. It's close but on average the pirate just survives (assuming no direct hit crits).  The bandit then shoots, averaging 1 1/2 damage to the pirates 6/8 dodge, most likely finishing him off.  At this point it's 4 marauders vs 3 blues and a bandit.  This is a pretty idealised scenario (assuming everyone is at range 2 and took a target lock). In reality the optimal play for the scum player is probably to try and block with the pirate as he's likely to die before he gets a shot anyway. If he can bump one of the B wings  the odds swing even further in the favour of the scum player.  As I said, I worked this out in my head on the way home so if anything looks wrong then please correct me."
XWingTMG,3apy69,Angerman5000,3,Mon Jun 22 20:47:07 2015 UTC,aren't the Bs and Ks the same PS so they all shoot regardless?
XWingTMG,3apy69,alemondemon,1 point,Tue Jun 23 00:48:09 2015 UTC,"Yes, that fourth b will still shoot unless it takes a crit that prevents it.    It's still very good, and if you can prevent the 2k from dropping behind the kir's it's more or less over."
XWingTMG,3apy69,rsixidor,1 point,Tue Jun 23 13:21:14 2015 UTC,"I understand your train of thought. The only issue is you are stressed after the glitterstim - so if the B-Wings can k-turn behind you, they will get some free shots to even things out! Also, their barrel roll and the bandit blocker can really help them out."
XWingTMG,3apy69,Thopterthallid,1 point,Mon Jun 22 21:36:34 2015 UTC,"You absolutely would not pull this maneuver when the B-Wings can do a 2-k behind you if you can manage it.  If you're stuck with that decision, I think you probably keep the stress and do a hard 1 turn. This means at least some of your arcs will still catch the b-wings and if the distance is close enough you might block their manuevers or they might block yours, giving you another turn to try to get in better position.  An interesting conundrum and one I can't wait to figure out on the table.  But preferably you do this just where they aren't sure they can k-turn past you if you would touch.  I'm going to have to map this out in Vassal soon. Really fun list to try, I think."

XWingTMG,3apy69,Shgrizz,4,Mon Jun 22 20:09:37 2015 UTC,"I don't know, though - Lightning Reflexes specifies ""on your dial"", so you'd just have to be careful to keep track of which ones can actually trigger correctly. E.g. probably can't use it after reducing a 2-turn down to speed 1 (doesn't exist), or even after increasing a green 1-bank to speed 2 (color doesn't match)...  Definitely more useful on her than some pilots, but still."
XWingTMG,3apy69,VanderLegion,2,Mon Jun 22 21:57:02 2015 UTC,I'm not sure that is how this would work.
XWingTMG,3apy69,Shgrizz,1 point,Mon Jun 22 23:17:15 2015 UTC,"I reckon they'll FAQ it so that if the maneuver is on your dial but a different colour (non-red) it will be permitted, but you won't be able to do it to a maneuver that's not on your dial (unless it completely breaks balance and makes Juno OP, in which case they won't). Therefore Juno would be able to use it when changing a green 1-bank to a 2, but not when changing a 2 turn to a 1."
XWingTMG,3apy69,sacimino40,1 point,Tue Jun 23 00:56:54 2015 UTC,"I'm not so sure. They've printed a movement table unique to juno, making it seem like those are all moves she can do as if they were on her dial. We'll see in the faq though."
XWingTMG,3apy69,VanderLegion,3,Tue Jun 23 08:59:13 2015 UTC,It doesn't affect her dial at all.  The printed movement table was just showing you a comparison of all the maneuvers she'll be capable of performing compared to a normal TIE advanced.
XWingTMG,3apy69,sacimino40,3,Tue Jun 23 16:06:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah, after checking the wording on both cards, it probably is the case that lightning reflexes only applies to moves printed on the dials. That's still ludicrously powerful though."
XWingTMG,3apy69,VanderLegion,1 point,Tue Jun 23 17:05:32 2015 UTC,"I dont see why Juno wouldnt be able to do it to any non-red maneuver. It's a maneuver that she just executed, it's not red, now pop lightning reflexes."
XWingTMG,3apy69,larikia,3,Tue Jun 23 14:57:38 2015 UTC,"Because lignthing reflexes doesn't just trigger off of executing a white or green maneuver.  It specifies that it's after executing a manevuer that is on your dial.  Technically, the TIE Advanced dial doesn't have a green 2 bank or a green 4 straight maneuver.  One could make an argument (and FFG might agree and FAQ it) that she still has a 2 bank and a 4 straight and the color doesn't matter as far as LR is concerned, we'll see.  She definitely won't be able to trigger it off of the 1 straight or 1 turn since they aren't on her dial at all.  Same as you won't b eable to trigger it off of Inertial Dampeners."
XWingTMG,3apy69,MythicalMothman,1 point,Tue Jun 23 16:04:58 2015 UTC,I would argue that those moves are on her dial. They are all moves Juno can execute. FFG released an image of Juno's dial compared to a regular advanced dial and those moves are on it. I suppose we will have to wait for the FAQ.
XWingTMG,3apy69,larikia,3,Tue Jun 23 16:20:08 2015 UTC,They wren't showing her dial.  They were showing all the possible maneuvers she could execute.  She uses the same dial as every other TIE advanced.
XWingTMG,3apy69,MythicalMothman,1 point,Tue Jun 23 16:24:41 2015 UTC,"Juno's ability states ""When you reveal your maneuver, you may increase or decrease its speed by 1 (to a minimum of 1)."" So she could take any of her greens on her dial, increase or decrease the speed of the maneuver on her dial, and still use lightning reflexes."
XWingTMG,3apy69,larikia,1 point,Tue Jun 23 11:41:32 2015 UTC,"But Lightning Reflexes triggers after executing a maneuver - if the maneuver you execute isn't already on your dial then wouldn't the card not trigger? I feel like it wouldn't count if the maneuver only exists as a different color, though I admit it isn't clear cut."
XWingTMG,3apy69,MythicalMothman,1 point,Tue Jun 23 13:42:13 2015 UTC,"The maneuver is on the dial, the speed was just increased or decreased. Without this interpretation, Juno wouldn't be able to turn the 2-forwards into a 1-forwards--it would be a maneuver not on the tie advanced dial and therefore be an illegal maneuver."
XWingTMG,3apy69,larikia,1 point,Tue Jun 23 22:32:00 2015 UTC,"Increasing or decreasing the speed makes it a new maneuver - whatever template you put down is the maneuver that you ""executed"", which is what LR's card text refers to. It might not be a legal maneuver normally but Juno's pilot ability is what overrides the default rules and makes it legal for her, the same way Tetran Cowell's ability overrides the default rules to make a 1-k legal for him despite it not being on the dial, or the way any card text overrides the default rules to allow something special.  We should also see the same interaction with Inertial Dampeners for anyone who has an illicit slot - you reveal your dial, but what you execute is a white 0 maneuver, and if you don't have a white 0 on your dial then LR can't activate.  Hopefully they just put it in the next FAQ and clear this all up."
XWingTMG,3apy69,TRK27,1 point,Wed Jun 24 02:10:54 2015 UTC,"Tetran Cowell card states ""...treat the speed of that maneuver as...""--it is a k-turn maneuver on his dial that is being treated as a different speed when he reveals it--it is still on his dial, just being treated as a different speed because of his ability. This doesn't interact with Lightning reflexes because they are red maneuvers, but would if they were white/green maneuvers.  Juno Eclipse states ""When you reveal your maneuver, you may increase or decrease its speed by 1 (to a minimum of 1)."" So Juno is still performing the maneuver on her dial, from her dial, but increasing or decreasing the printed speed on the dial by 1[for the activation]. It is still 'the same maneuver' printed on her dial, just the speed was modified. Juno could turn the 2 forwards or 2 hard turns into speed 1 and still use lightning reflexes--she executed a maneuver on her dial whose speed was modified by the card text.  Inertial Dampeners states ""...instead perform..."" so ID is letting you perform a maneuver not on your dial INSTEAD OF a maneuver on the dial. LR would not be possible with the Inertial Dampeners white 0 maneuver. If juno's ability said ""...you may instead perform a maneuver of the same color and bearing as revealed on your dial with the speed increased or decreased by 1..."" THEN lightning reflexes would not interact."
XWingTMG,3apy69,fl1p_problems,1 point,Wed Jun 24 11:48:34 2015 UTC,"My point is that increasing or decreasing the speed makes it a different maneuver - a 1-turn is fundamentally not the same maneuver as a 2-turn, so revealing a 2-turn and then putting a 1-turn template on the board means you executed a 1-turn, not a 2-turn."
XWingTMG,3apy69,VanderLegion,1 point,Wed Jun 24 13:46:47 2015 UTC,"And my point is that the card text changes what is on the dial, not replaces it."

And I'm not sure what the lore or in-game justification would be but...for the sake of the thread: it'd make for some interesting deployment/obstacle placement.   If a ship was better at turning to the left, you'd surely have to often deploy on the right - but your opponent knows that, so he tries to place obstacles in your way?"
XWingTMG,3ar9ko,jonboyjon1990,9,Mon Jun 22 21:46:03 2015 UTC,"Certain planes in world war I were notorious for being able to turn more easily to one side (the sopwith camel could make tighter right turns than left turns).  It could be as subtle as asymmetric colors (right turns are green, left turns are white) to something as dramatic as missing moves (has a right 1 turn but there is no left 1 turn)."
XWingTMG,3ar9ko,PCGamerPirate,5,Mon Jun 22 22:08:26 2015 UTC,"But that's only a problem with atmospheric flight.   Roll the ship 180 degrees, and problem solved."
XWingTMG,3ar9ko,towmule,3,Tue Jun 23 07:32:52 2015 UTC,"Most planes wouldn't ""Turn"" faster in one direction, the radius and speed would be the same (except maybe in an asymmetric design). However, rolling would be faster or slower depending on if the plane was rolling with or against the rotational motion of the engine/propeller.  How noticeable this is will depend on the particular plane of course, the relative magnitude of control surface vs the engine torque. This is a fact of life for most prop planes even into WWII. Though not as exaggerated an effect as the camel likely experienced, knowledge of which direction you can roll faster is particularly important for some maneuvers like the hammerhead, where the low speed of the plane makes control surfaces pretty weak and the engine rotation takes some authority."

XWingTMG,3apsrv,VanderLegion,2,Mon Jun 22 15:07:42 2015 UTC,Not really.  Adrenaline rush just makes a red maneuver white basically.  Lightning reflexes lets you do maneuvers you couldn't otherwise.  Any ship with an EPT can use it to do a stegnor's loop.  Any ship without a k-turn can just do a straight and burn LR to do a k-turn.  Echo is already ridiculous in all the different locations and directions she can end up after moving.  Imagine if you could then take any of those destinations and rotate her 180 degrees afterward.
XWingTMG,3apsrv,PCGamerPirate,5,Mon Jun 22 17:05:16 2015 UTC,Traded the X-wing's 3 turns for 1 turns and the 1 straight for a 5-k.  Looking at lightning reflexes versus adrenaline rush (as both are one point).  Adrenaline rush lets you perform a red maneuver without getting stressed. Let's you perform a k-turn and get an action.  Lightning reflexes allows you to turn around after nearly any maneuver but end up stressed with no action. Let's you perform a crazy sloop then stress.  Lightning reflexes also has a picture of a Vaksai fighter on it (Wave 8 confirmed?).
XWingTMG,3apsrv,CyclopticBinLid,5,Mon Jun 22 15:03:24 2015 UTC,"Vaksai fighter   According to Wookiepedia, a Vaskai is just one of the aftermarket modifications of the Kihraxz. So I doubt it."
XWingTMG,3apsrv,charbar486,2,Mon Jun 22 16:45:43 2015 UTC,Will one really be able to take an action after using Lightning Reflexes?  On the card it says to add the stress after the Check Pilot Stress step so I think the stress will be applied before the Perform Action step?

Put it on a StarViper with Advanced Sensors and you have all kinds of options for where you could end up with either boost or barrel roll before your move."

XWingTMG,3apsrv,kertofer,9,Mon Jun 22 15:10:00 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say every way, moving a shield to a hull and losing the astromech slot does hurt some.  If it had a salvaged astromech slot, I'd call it better in pretty much every way, or if it had something else to be worth the tradeoff.  As it stands though, you're losing a decent amount of potential for just one point less cost (though it is a pretty important point, since it drops it down to 20 points)."

I was thinking maybe he'd be a good wingman for 58 point Dash? Dash needs help hunting Aces, and Horton can be good at that, especially with engine to make sure H's targets aren't at R1. R2-D6+VI +Engine would be almost required on that sort of build, leaving 5 points for ordinance. Options include 1x ion torps, 2x flechette, 1x proton bomb, 2x seismic, 2x prox mines or something cheap +prockets on Dash."

So it works like turret cluster missiles but is limited in the damage output.  Range 3 turret though means it is likely to be taken to help hunt Fels and strip stealth devices and tokens through multiple shots per turn."

XWingTMG,3appi4,kami-cosby,1 point,Tue Jun 23 02:00:39 2015 UTC,"I think doing away with the title would be good for TLT esp on horton. You want to keep distance to keep using it, so point away from the enemy and let him burn into your range. Good teammates for this would probably be more turrets. Cheap y-wings with the turret or an outrider or a falcon would be nice complements to capitalize on the long range turret power.  Otherwise you could build to kill his counters. The main threats horton would have would be a massed cluster of swarmy ships who will take him out before he can deal damage and an interceptor with autothrusters.  Some other cool complements might be a corran horn, who swoops into a safe spot, doubletaps someone, then flies off to let horton get some long range poking done as the finisher.  A list idea I had was to bring horton, a gold, and two operatives, all given twin laser turrets. Interceptors with auto-thrusters will have a hard time dodging so many 3-dice attacks, and any damage through is acceptable to the rebel squad. Against big turret ships like the falcon, you are almost guaranteed a kill within 2 turns if everyone is tight enough. Still need to worry about swarmy stuff that may outlast such a squad, but some tactics could improve your odds."

XWingTMG,3appi4,bl1y,3,Mon Jun 22 16:39:36 2015 UTC,"R3A2 absolutely needs to be errated to only allow one stress per turn. It was seeing play and was in the top 8 of worlds when it could only cause 1 stress a turn.   There is nothing else in the game at 3 points that can drop 2 stress on a target.  closest is going to be gunner + tact, which is 7 points and two crew."
XWingTMG,3appi4,starslinger72,1 point,Mon Jun 22 18:24:12 2015 UTC,It definitely needs a nerf of some sort.  Especially once the twin laser turret comes out.  3 stress to any ship in a turn regardless of how your dice roll is simply unbalancing.  They need to make it so you can't use the ability once you have like 2 or 3 stress.
XWingTMG,3appi4,MaximusNerdius,1 point,Mon Jun 22 20:10:50 2015 UTC,And now it's 3 stress at range 2-3 lol
XWingTMG,3appi4,Notexactlyserious,1 point,Tue Jun 23 04:28:42 2015 UTC,It's only 2 points if my memory serves. Captive is just as much of a pain imo
XWingTMG,3appi4,-SeizureSalad-,1 point,Tue Jun 23 14:00:21 2015 UTC,"Captive allows you to play around him and at best can only put out 1 stress a round, and that is if you shoot at him.  While captive is annoying to deal with its something that has lots of counter play for all of the factions.  The counter play to R3A2 is don't get shot at."
XWingTMG,3appi4,starslinger72,1 point,Tue Jun 23 14:35:45 2015 UTC,"Perhaps, ""When you declare the target of your attack, take 1 stress. If you hit, assign one stress to your target."" This would mean you could drop multiple stress, but it's not a sure thing any more."
XWingTMG,3appi4,bl1y,0,Mon Jun 22 18:40:28 2015 UTC,"I disagree with you for a couple of reasons.  A more realistic equivalent is 2x tactician, which only costs 4 points, and doesn't have the opportunity cost of having to run a self-stressing Y-wing. The YV-66 can easily triple stress a target for 6 points and 3 crew slots thanks to its 180 degree firing arc.  The 2 stress combo actually costs 7 points, 2 for the droid and 5 for an ion cannon turret. TLT is going to be better, but that costs a total of 8 points. Autoblaster turret brings the combo down to 4 points, but no one runs it because it's awful.  I really don't think R3-A2 is broken, which is really the only reason FFG would errata it. The BTL-A4 title and Twin Laser Turret really help make it better, but it's not exactly dominating the meta. Autothrusters made Soontir Fel much stronger, but I don't think they need to be nerfed."
XWingTMG,3appi4,antigrapist,3,Mon Jun 22 18:48:55 2015 UTC,"Its basically the strongest 25 points you can spend in a rebel list right now.   There is nothing at that point cost they can field that is a better buy.  Also like I said, it was powerful for 3 points before the title showed up.  Now its simply better for no downside.    The other thing that makes it so good is it fits multiple stress into a small point cost.  the YV-666 is going to be a 35 point ship ship and only works at range 2.  If the twin linked laser turret is going to work, its going to double stress at range 3, triple at 2, and single at range 1."
XWingTMG,3appi4,starslinger72,0,Mon Jun 22 19:10:59 2015 UTC,"You really think that it is a better buy than: Cracken with VI and Cluster missiles - shooting before a phantom cloaks or moving after soontir moves and handing out two free actions with missiles?  -or-  Tarn Mision w/ r7 - forcing the defender to reroll his attack dice, this is super good against two ship builds  -or-  A Green squad with PTL, Pred, Chardan, Test Pilot and Stealth device - save that focus for defense!   -or-   Blue squad w the seat and C-3PO? a nice little mini falcon  It is still a Y-wing. It is stressing itself as well, and only has two green maneuvers. It can only stress in arc and can only do at max 4 damage a turn. And you will get three chances to cancel all that damage. It only has one evade dice and you get 5 chances to crit it out of its 8 hp.  Is it good, yes. Is it op to the point of either of us having to take the time and bitch about on the internet? No."
XWingTMG,3appi4,Navihawk11,2,Mon Jun 22 20:05:36 2015 UTC,Do I think putting 3 stress on an opposing ship is worth 26 points?  Without a doubt I would take that every time.  It is hands down better than all the things you mentioned.  Any ship you put a decent amount of points into becomes dead in the water.  The stupid thing about the gold with either turret is it doesn't even have to do any damage and its wing men will win out more times than not.  I have no idea why more people are not spamming rebel control with all the dual IGs and deci + Fel out there.
XWingTMG,3appi4,starslinger72,1 point,Mon Jun 22 20:15:51 2015 UTC,"I agree it is worth the 26 points but again it has major downsides. That Y-wing is going to die if your opponent knows how to play the game. In fact it will probably be the first thing to go down. Even a two ship imperial list should take it out in two turns of fire.  It also loses a lot against any list that is more that two ships. if you stress out one ship in a four ship list it is not the end of the world, but if you stress out a 41 point phantom for fifty point Han, that is a big deal. But stressing out another 25ish point ship really does not help that much.   Basically, you are complaining that there is a counter to someone making a two ship list."
XWingTMG,3appi4,Navihawk11,2,Mon Jun 22 20:24:03 2015 UTC,"That isnt true at all, against a standard 4BZ a rebel control list will win more times than not.  You gain FCS shots for your B-wings and they have to take out that Y-wing first while you can drop their B's.  Against a Tie swarm its not great, but its still not an auto loss.    Im pointing out that there isn't anything remotely close in either scum or imperial that can shut down 2 ships for the most important turns of the game.  That Y-wing will get off one shot, most 2/3 ship lists will have a hard time killing it before it shoots.  With proper blocking you can reasonably get off 2 shots before it goes down.  The scary thing here is you are giving 3 blues with FCS free time to just mow you down while you must deal with a mass stress generating Y-wing.   It really comes down to full swarms  being the only thing it really doesn't want to see flown against it."
XWingTMG,3appi4,starslinger72,2,Mon Jun 22 20:38:27 2015 UTC,"Against 4bz the 4bz player is not going to care about stress on one or two ships. In fact if you spread out the stress he can get rid of it faster. He also is throwing 14 red dice against your Y-wing. Sure he might lose a b-wing or the z, but none of those were lynch pins of his squad. And if two ships are stressed on the initial approach they wil either clear it before bumping or clear it and bump.   If you have a 2/3 ship squad and a run headlong into this Y-wing you just handed your opponent the game. You will be deploying after this Y-wing and can counter deploy. Run around the table until you can get behind it. It is a Y-wing and some B-wings, x-wings and Z95's should be able to out maneuver it. This isn't a tie phantom it is a y-wing."
XWingTMG,3appi4,Navihawk11,1 point,Mon Jun 22 20:55:32 2015 UTC,"If you set up rebel control in a pin wheel its trivial to get the initial joust on the bulk of the enemy fleet.  You have full access to 2 banks and turns.  That is all you need.  Against the 4BZ your blues are going to be dropping TL + focus shots into then on the second turn, all the while one of your B-wings was ion'd and stressed from the turn before.  Hell you don't even need the title in this match up."
XWingTMG,3appi4,starslinger72,1 point,Mon Jun 22 21:02:46 2015 UTC,"It instantly invalidates a Soontir, phantom, Corran, basically any action heavy list that's balanced around it's action economy. Tactician is tough, but you can avoid that easily and it's only one stress at a time. Mara can only put out one and only if you don't have any. Rebel works once per round and only on the first ship to fire.   New stressbot will be dropping 3 stress a turn from range 2-3. On multiple targets if need be."
XWingTMG,3appi4,Notexactlyserious,0,Tue Jun 23 04:31:42 2015 UTC,"Its not going to drop ""multiple stress on multiple targets"" it can spread 3 stress across 3 ships at most, if you make a list with two ships you are just making this ships job easier. One stress on a target is not a huge deal - if you face this with super Soontir don't stress yourself out if you know the enemy will.  Yes, it is a powerful mechanic, If it catches the two best arc dodgers in the game it can shut them down. But I don't see having a counter to those as being a bad thing at all. Its not a counter to Corran as he is usually doing greens w/ R2 anyway and has FCS. 58 point dash gets a focus when he removes a stress, so he is not helpless.   Stress is a strong mechanic, but you can learn to adapt. Predator works great against this ship as you usually see it on a gold squad pilot - so two re-rolls."
XWingTMG,3appi4,Navihawk11,3,Tue Jun 23 10:54:23 2015 UTC,"I do believe that Stressbot won't work with TLT, because you only declare the target of the attack once, and then roll twice with the turret, so 2 stress as usual, not 3..."
XWingTMG,3appi4,fl1p_problems,2,Tue Jun 23 09:45:36 2015 UTC,"that sounds right.   since TLT doesn't allow you to target two different targets, you'd only declare your target once.    still, having the double stress out to range three could be worth the extra point and dropping the Ion effect."
XWingTMG,3appi4,branniganbginagain,2,Tue Jun 23 12:38:34 2015 UTC,"at 26 points you can drop this into just about any squad. Throwing triple stress on a generic Y is no big deal, but Soontir or a Phantom that is triple stressed is as good as dead."

It's entirely likely that the Empire (or Scum) will run out of Damage Cards (since Rebel huge ships have their own decks).   This is a problem I hadn't foreseen. If one of the decks runs out, my plan will be to assign one critical effect token to the pilot cards for each facedown damage card they have and create a new damage deck. If an ability requires a card to be flipped up then we'll assign it a face up damage card from the newly created deck and discard one of the tokens.

XWingTMG,3apycu,howieloader,3,Mon Jun 22 16:49:35 2015 UTC,Is that possible?   Pretty sure bombers have the most hull/cost and you can only fit 6 in a list plus a hull upgrade. That means 37 hull in the list but if none have died it's only possible that 31 have been dealt out.
XWingTMG,3apycu,stmack,1 point,Mon Jun 22 16:43:23 2015 UTC,"Crap, you're right.  For some reason I had it in my head that there were 22 cards in the damage deck, rather than the 33 that there are."
XWingTMG,3apycu,mxzf,1 point,Mon Jun 22 16:51:21 2015 UTC,"Is that possible? ...you can only fit 6 [Bombers] in a list plus a hull upgrade.   You can fit as many ships as you own in a list. Not everyone plays 100pt games. I only play casually and mostly play either small 1 ship v 1 ship games or 200-300pt games. And while I've never ran out of cards, I've come close.  Currently making a 500pt list for a game this weekend. Assigning all the cards in the deck is a possibility.  I talked about what solution I'll be using in another comment."

XWingTMG,3apycu,VanderLegion,1 point,Mon Jun 22 15:59:35 2015 UTC,"That's my instinct, but there's gotta be an official ruling on it"
XWingTMG,3apycu,phasertech,2,Mon Jun 22 16:08:42 2015 UTC,"Page 16 of the rulebook has it.  It doesn't, however, address the situation where you run out of damage cards and there isn't anything in the discarded damage pile."
XWingTMG,3apycu,mxzf,2,Mon Jun 22 16:26:55 2015 UTC,"Yes it does, on p. 21:   In the unlikely event that there are no Damage cards remaining in the deck or discard pile, change all [crit] results rolled to [hit] results. Use a suitable replacement to track additional damage until the deck is replenished.   That's actually a horrible way to word that rule, by the way. There's no mention of exactly when you change the results, so it's not officially clear how this interacts with things like Autoblasters or Bossk. It would be more sensible to say that crits are still crits, they simply cause a normal point of damage instead of a face-up card."
XWingTMG,3apycu,quarrel,1 point,Mon Jun 22 21:21:32 2015 UTC,"Wow, that's a really weird place to put that rule, really random.  I do agree that it's a bad way to handle it, though to be fair Autoblasters and Bosk hadn't been thought of at that point."
XWingTMG,3apycu,mxzf,2,Tue Jun 23 02:14:17 2015 UTC,"Also, if you deal out 33 (34 for new hits) hull damage and cant finish those ships you probably don't deserve those crits."
XWingTMG,3apycu,skyshroudace,1 point,Tue Jun 23 16:04:47 2015 UTC,"True.  Unless, of course, you're playing a two-player game with one damage deck or are playing a >100 point game where you really do have that many ships on the field."
XWingTMG,3apycu,mxzf,1 point,Tue Jun 23 16:21:06 2015 UTC,"What about if you run out of damage cards without any ships dead or damage cards discarded?  A fleet with 6x Scimitar Squadron Pilots would have 35 hull, enough to empty the damage deck and still have 1-2 hull on each ship.  I agree that it's an unlikely scenario, but it's technically possible."
XWingTMG,3apycu,mxzf,0,Mon Jun 22 16:08:36 2015 UTC,"I suppose that's true. Hypothetically, one could go through a whole damage deck in a 100pt game."

XWingTMG,3aplc0,Dr_Lord_Platypus,3,Mon Jun 22 13:50:10 2015 UTC,"The game is based on a point-buy system. Different ships and different pilots in these ships cost different points. Usually you play with 100 points and you're allowed to buy ships and upgrade cards for those ships with these 100 points. In that regard: no, you do not need to buy 2 ties for every x-wing.  Two starter sets are good for the first two rounds, but you'll soon want some variety in your ships. TIE-Fighers and X-Wings aren't exactely the most exciting ships.  Complementing those well are the following ships for the following reasons:   A Millenium Falcon for the Rebels and a Decimator or a Slave I for the Imperials - all three are large ships which handle differently than your common small ones. Also: they're easy to fly for beginners with their rotating turrets. A TIE-Phantom and an E-Wing: Both very powerful small ships, ""high value targets"" if you want them. Both have a very high maneuverability and are therefor - to me - highly entertaining. Rebel and Imperial Aces Packs: You basically cannot go wrong with those, but there's not need to buy them right in the beginning. All ships and Pilots in there are decent. I'd recommend also getting a normal TIE-Interceptor to get Soontir Fel, a very good pilot.   This gets you a nice variety of things to toy around with. Once you played some rounds with those, you can go on and add bombers / Y-Wings or specified support ships you think you might also like to your list, but these should already show you around what's possible quite a bit.  Once you get the hang of everything, you'll probably know what other possibilities are out there anyways and then it's more often than not a matter of taste. Some people prefer to fly swarms of small ships, some prefer tanky ships, some prefer highly mobile ships. You'll figure it out for yourself or you'll just buy everything anyways."

XWingTMG,3apk50,TheSecretMe,3,Mon Jun 22 14:46:08 2015 UTC,Low pilot skill is an advantage when laying mines. You get to do it before your high value target moves away.
XWingTMG,3apk50,TheSecretMe,1 point,Mon Jun 22 20:40:18 2015 UTC,Agreed. But once you've dropped your mine(s) you still got a PS5 boat you paid nearly 50 points for!
XWingTMG,3apk50,AffixBayonets,1 point,Tue Jun 23 04:56:55 2015 UTC,The firespray is hardly an arc dodger. With it's forwards and backwards arcs and it's ok dial it's not as essential for it to have a super high pilot skill.  The main threats to big ships like this are swarms of cheap crap pouring fire on it. He still out flies those.  Also Ameen is PS6 not 5. Naked with just proximity mines he comes in under 40 points. For nearly 50 points you can give him 3 sets of mines plus a mangler cannon.  It's not nearly as bad as you make it sound.
XWingTMG,3apk50,leewardstyle,1 point,Tue Jun 23 08:22:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah my bad, not sure why I though he was PS5, I do like high PS firesprays though, I find the potential options for double arc madness makes my opponent nervous/cautious when they have to move first."

XWingTMG,3aqcrn,CommanderLink,2,Mon Jun 22 17:29:24 2015 UTC,"Very.  You must perform your action (if you are able) immediately after the ship moves. See page 7 of the rule book.  If you do actions after all ships have moved, you effectively negate all the benefits of high PS."
XWingTMG,3aqcrn,PCGamerPirate,1 point,Mon Jun 22 17:31:28 2015 UTC,thanks mate I would attribute that to why i've lost so many battles to others using swarms of low pilot skill ships. I thought higher pilot skill was simply an advantage because of movement so you have far less chance you're gonna smash into something
XWingTMG,3aqcrn,BorisIHateReddit,1 point,Mon Jun 22 17:46:19 2015 UTC,"Actually, the lower a pilot skill the more likely you'll be able to maneuver to a position that is empty and get to perform an action. People will run lower point ships in their list in an attempt to block other player's maneuvers for this reason."
XWingTMG,3aqcrn,X-factor103,1 point,Tue Jun 23 03:12:19 2015 UTC,"Should be stated as well that the other big advantage of having higher PS is that you can shoot first, sometimes allowing you to blow up enemies before they get a chance to fire back on your squad.  But yes, plan ahead! If your high PS ship moves last during the round and you're planning to do something like Target Lock, plan ahead to where you think you'll still be in range. I've had newbie problems myself in moving last and realizing my enemy went too quickly and was suddenly out of lock range."
XWingTMG,3amv9r,bl1y,4,Sun Jun 21 19:57:55 2015 UTC,Great write up! Something that's hard to explain to people newer to the game.
XWingTMG,3amv9r,NoamChompski,2,Sun Jun 21 22:01:59 2015 UTC,"Thanks! It's always a bit difficult to write about numbers and such without it becoming completely dull. What actually got me the most interested in it was doing the math on 3 hits with Focus. Landing 3 hits nearly half the time is huge, and it also means that when you do roll a crit there's a good chance of it not being cancelled.  The last section came out of theory crafting around Kir Kanos. He wants to be lower PS so you can wait and see if you get shot or not before adding your Evade to attack."
XWingTMG,3amv9r,EdgeOfDreams,1 point,Sun Jun 21 22:33:11 2015 UTC,"Good stuff. It's really nice to see this stuff laid out in way that explains the details well but doesn't overwhelm new players with charts and complicated math. You're providing a great baseline of understanding for more complicated theorycraft in the future, such as the Stealth Device vs Shield Upgrade debate."
XWingTMG,3amv9r,EdgeOfDreams,2,Mon Jun 22 00:33:31 2015 UTC,"Stealth vs. Shield/Hull is something I've been trying to figure out. If you've got a Focus, that's an extra 5/8 chance for an evade. Such a tough choice."
XWingTMG,3amv9r,souledgar,2,Mon Jun 22 00:54:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's complex. I'm of the opinion that Stealth Device is best on a pilot that is likely to almost always have Focus and/or Evade tokens to work with, such as Soontir Fel, especially combined with Autothrusters. Anyone else is probably better off with a Shield/Hull upgrade.  The other part of it that I've had trouble figuring out, though, is how much of a difference your opponent's squad makes. My intuition says that if you're going up against a swarm of 2-dice attacks, Stealth Device comes out ahead because it's more likely to save your bacon multiple times. On the other hand, against something rolling 4 or more attack dice at you, you're highly likely to take at least 1 hit early on and lose the Stealth Device right away, so you might have been better off with the extra shield or hull. I just don't know enough about modeling probabilities to prove it."
XWingTMG,3amv9r,Asbestos101,1 point,Mon Jun 22 01:01:41 2015 UTC,"Its one thing to read something like that, its quite another to roll 5 green dice for at max range AND obstructed twice with Howlrunner and turning up all blanks. To be fair, that was a slight mistake in estimating ranges on my part, as she was the only one in range to shoot at, still.. its maximum range and behind a rock."
XWingTMG,3aocbq,MysteriousRacer_X,2,Mon Jun 22 04:10:31 2015 UTC,"Good report!  Seemed like Keyan had a field day.   Too bad you won't get him for mission three.   On the other hand, you won't have to worry about Whisper in mission three either, so that might be a wash.  We're running this campaign at my store right now and yesterday was this exact mission.    We had two games go roughly as you described, but in the third one the Imperials managed to kill the transport on the last shot of the last turn.  Overall a very fun mission!"
XWingTMG,3aocbq,Droofus,2,Mon Jun 22 14:52:24 2015 UTC,"Thanks, we had a lot of fun! My roster was whittled down pretty thin after this one, so it was tough to build a solid list for round 3.

We actually completed mission 3 already, I'll get the write up done in the next few days!"

If you want to Focus / Target Lock most of the time, the boost action is moot anyway.  Keep in mind though: Lambdas are very easily outmaneuvered. Asteroid placement and flying the Lambda are key to getting things done with this list."
XWingTMG,3ap34t,fl1p_problems,1 point,Mon Jun 22 11:08:00 2015 UTC,"Seems like a good enough exchange. I just thought that engine upgrade would help alleviate the maneuverability problem to an extent. I can't help but think of that article on FFG's site ""In Defense of the Lambda-class shuttle"" where all the builds had it. Still, I'm very much leaning toward your suggestion, and I appreciate the help."
XWingTMG,3ap34t,fl1p_problems,1 point,Mon Jun 22 13:54:49 2015 UTC,"Engine Upgrade helps in positioning the Shuttle and in turning it around. I read the FFG article too, and found it quite good.  Except I don't quite know why one would like to make a ship, thats fast as it is (because of the large base), can't turn quickly and is best at range 3 go even faster forward. Your enemy will have that much of an easier time getting behind you. If you want to get somewhere, pull the straight 3 or 2 bank maneuvers, they're plenty quick. Otherwise: practice flying with the space cow. It's fun. ;)"
XWingTMG,3ap34t,quinntessence23,2,Mon Jun 22 14:29:52 2015 UTC,"Haha, I have no doubts in my mind about the space cow being fun. I will most certainly do that."
XWingTMG,3ap34t,playnwin,2,Mon Jun 22 14:40:03 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure the idea is use the boost only when you don't have anything in arc - suddenly you can make a 90 degree turn every turn when you need to turn around instead of being limited to alternating 90s and 45s.   Personally, I don't find it to be worth the 4 points on my shuttles compared to making the escort hit harder and use the Lambda as the easy thing to shoot at, but I do get why EU Lambdas are such a common expectation."
XWingTMG,3ap34t,Endelir,2,Mon Jun 22 19:06:00 2015 UTC,"I've been saying this for a while: Soontir Fel is the single best pilot in the game. I'd drop Weapons Engineer to Mercenary Copilot and upgrade Jax to Fel. In my experience, it'll be worth it every time.  Also felt that this had to be shared"

Obviously with these games the friendliness and sportsmanship of the opponent can make or break your day, but so far I've only had positive experiences.   Most people seem very willing to help out new players.    I think the format helped too. Most of the players, even the very experienced ones haven't played escalation before.

XWingTMG,3aor4z,LazyG,1 point,Tue Jun 23 03:29:37 2015 UTC,"If you can find the extra point, I think you really want the R4 agromech on Kavil. WHen he spends the focus to use the Blaster turret he can immediately gain a lock which he can then use to resolve the turret attack. This means you get a reroll on every blaster turret shot, and 4 dice with a reroll is brutal. I think it is worth dropping something.   I think you can drop DMS from Ndru, which gives space for the R4 and leaves you on 99. I might also swap antipursuit lasers for Autothrusters on the IG88. Especially with the VI on the IG88, he moves late so APL is less useful to block. The Aggressor is so agile that AT can work for you, and make it slippery, especially as you went for the aggressive IG88B not the more tanky C.   I'm also not sold on EU on N'dru. I might take it off for more elsewhere, maybe some ordnance for N'dru, as the extra dice still works and say cluster missiles is two 4 dice hits with a blank reroll.   WHat are you tactics? How do you intend to fly it?"

Han gets 2 evades and a focus each turn from crew + PTL and title.  Can boost if he can clear an arc and still has han reroll to hit things.  All 3 ships are hard to deal damage to."
XWingTMG,3amvjj,starslinger72,1 point,Sun Jun 21 22:08:22 2015 UTC,Any reason you wouldn't add the a wings as prototype pilots + a wing test pilot + PTL?  Just tried building this and XWingBuiler wouldn't let me add titles to the prototype pilot... something I'm missing?  EDIT: Got it - pilot skill is too low!  Double edit: Any reason not to add test pilot and a single point Elite? VI or Determination look like good options - is having the lower squad cost better?

XWingTMG,3amvjj,starslinger72,1 point,Mon Jun 22 14:44:54 2015 UTC,Thanks! Is there any rule of thumb for when an ini bid has a higher probability of being useful than taking an upgrade?
XWingTMG,3amvjj,Stoppit_TidyUp,1 point,Mon Jun 22 17:21:03 2015 UTC,Generally init bids are only taken for pilots at PS 9 that want to arc dodge other PS 9 pilots.  In this case a large ship with engine upgrade can control range really well against other ships.   In this list its more does a 1 point upgrade for 1 of my two A-wings help more than getting to re position to get someone like soontir in arc to deny auto thrusters.
XWingTMG,3amvjj,starslinger72,1 point,Mon Jun 22 17:31:10 2015 UTC,I'm racking my brain here because I can't figure something out. Where are you getting the 2nd evade from?
XWingTMG,3amvjj,jebleez,1 point,Sun Jun 28 23:25:02 2015 UTC,PTL for focus + evade from MF title.  When you pull the stress off and gain a focus from kyle use jan to convert the focus to an evade.
XWingTMG,3amvjj,starslinger72,1 point,Mon Jun 29 13:52:32 2015 UTC,"Yeah, for some reason I wasn't reading the 2nd part of that first sentence. I was only reading it as that she couldn't use the ability on herself."

XWingTMG,3aor9i,eunoiared,2,Mon Jun 22 07:10:17 2015 UTC,"I've not played Mission 8, but I have played the Corvette campaign. The last mission is similar in that you just have to survive/escape. To me, Engine Booster (3 points) and Backup Shield Generator (3 points) are good choices for each ship. Both of them give you a chance to spend energy at different times, and outside the ""Energy"" phase. The Bright Hope title (5 points) will make one of the GRs especially tanky. I like the Duty Free title (2 points) because the Jam action is my favorite, but you really should be Recovering or Reinforcing for your actions for this mission. The WED-15 Repair Droid could come in handy (2 points). Targeting Coordinator (4 points) or Rieekan (3 points) could come in handy to bolster your escort attacks.  Then there's Chewbacca who basically erases 2 hits (4 points).    So Engine Booster x3 = 9 Backup Shield Generator x3 = 9 Bright Hope = 5 I vote for Chewbacca, Targeting Coordinator, or Rieekan to fill out the rest.  btw, Shield+Engine+Bright Hope will put you at 11 points on one of the ships, eating a point from your escorts.    As for the escorts, the more the better in my opinion, plus a turret to get the more slippery ships.  Rebel player has initiative per the mission rules, so no sense leaving points unspent. I like Predatunist Green Squadron Pilots with Refit (3 at 24 points each = 72). Lando with VI and Nien Nunb (46 points). Daggers (2 at 24 points each = 48). Blue (22 points) Bandit (12 points) The A-Wings can hopefully use Opportunist most of the time since the Daggers and Lando shoot before them. However, if I were the Imperial player, I would bring as many Academy Pilots as possible to choke your lanes and kamikaze the transports. If that's a worry, maybe demote the A-Wings to Prototypes to keep the enemy at bay. Obviously they would then be unable to field any EPT. Lando at 9 with initiative shoots before Whisper, so there's that. I like B-Wings to fly with him so he can hand out actions. Edit: Relevant thread"
XWingTMG,3aor9i,mahthyoo,2,Mon Jun 22 10:50:16 2015 UTC,Thank you so much for the advise. I have a better grasp on the build process now. And thanks for pointing me out to the thread.
XWingTMG,3aor9i,mahthyoo,2,Tue Jun 23 01:11:53 2015 UTC,"Good luck. I'm sure we'd love to see pics and an update when the time comes. My biggest problem when I first started playing epic was I overloaded the ships and forgot about half of my upgrades. Still had fun. I feel sorry for the Imps, but you'll definitely have your work cut out for you!"
XWingTMG,3aor9i,RDT2,2,Tue Jun 23 04:40:24 2015 UTC,What makes this mission tough is your opponent gets to pick your exit zones. So expect that one of your transports is going to need to cross 1 or both of your others. It's going to make it a giant mess and you may want very maneuverable escorts to be able to weave around the transports.
XWingTMG,3anjy8,greenhilttrainee,3,Sun Jun 21 23:38:15 2015 UTC,Rexlar Brath + HLC + Predator makes Han very unhappy. Then add 4 Academy Pilots to block and add support.

XWingTMG,3anjy8,Kaerlis,3,Mon Jun 22 06:03:57 2015 UTC,"I'd second that list. swarm firepower is great for taking down fat ships like falcons, the tie fighters will give you great bang for buck throwing eight red dice for half your points. I haven't used him, but I imagine the tie defender making lots of crits would hurt han badly as soon as you get through shields."
XWingTMG,3anjy8,Lepre_Khan,2,Mon Jun 22 12:45:31 2015 UTC,"Just remember to snipe from far away. HLC doesn't add green to Han at R3, but doesn't get a red at R1. He still has more health than you so you need to maximize your agility and range firepower when possible. Slow roll in and blast."

Going down to Jake and the Chardaan refit allows an FCS on two of the Blues, which is not bad!   http://xwing-builder.co.uk/view/271416/jakes-adjusted-blue-buddies  Or you can try Outmanoeuvre instead of predator.

XWingTMG,3amehz,LazyG,1 point,Sun Jun 21 20:40:45 2015 UTC,"You could also swap out Predator for VI, so Jake will almost definitely get out of arc each turn, and plop a FCS on that last Blue Buddy."

Here's some possibilities:   8x Academy Pilot (4 points left over for upgrades or swapping out for higher skilled pilots) 6x Academy Pilot + Howlrunner (10 points left over for upgrades or swapping out for higher skilled pilots, your choice) 5x Black Squadron Pilot + Howlrunner, and give everyone Swarm Tactics. This is exactly 100 points and means the whole swarm shoots at PS 8 because you can chain Swarm Tactics from one ship to the next. Any 5 or 6 of the named TIE Pilots with whatever upgrades you feel like. This list is a bit harder to fly in formation, because each named pilot has different abilities that may affect where they want to be. However, if you're willing and able to fly these effectively out of formation and not just all bump into each other, it can be a good list."

XWingTMG,3am8oq,quarrel,1 point,Sun Jun 21 19:59:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's rough. If you're wanting to fly in formation, you've got to put your lowest skill pilots at the front and on the side you think you'll be turning towards, with higher skill pilots going from the back on the opposite side. It's OK when you split up, but formation flying just doesn't really happen when your pilot skill is all over the place."

XWingTMG,3alz0e,baronsmeg,7,Sun Jun 21 15:06:30 2015 UTC,"Well, the FAQ says for Gunner and Luke Skywalker:   The first sentence on both of these cards should read: “After you perform an attack that does not hit, you may immediately perform a primary weapon attack.”   And also for Gunner:   When Gunner is used to perform a primary weapon attack, any additional attacks (such as from Cluster Missiles) are forfeited.   (And Luke just says ""See Gunner above."")  So, since the FAQ changed the wording to ""you may"", it means that triggering Gunner or Luke is optional. If you miss the first attack from Twin Laser Turret and choose to activate Gunner/Luke, then you're giving up the second attack from the Turret. However, you can choose to NOT trigger Gunner/Luke on the first miss, proceed to make your second attack, and if that one misses, you can trigger Gunner/Luke.  In other words, you CAN use this combo to make three attacks in a round, but only if you trigger Gunner/Luke on the second of those attacks."

Well... we didn't get around to playing 40k. Instead we were flipping out over just how insanely fun X Wing is.  The rules make so much sense, we noted that we got through one full game without consulting the rules more than once, which is frankly incredible.  After flailing around figuring out movement, we played another game that went much more smoothly, with formations facing off against eachother around an oblong asteroid belt.  My new plastic crack addiction... TIE fighters..."
XWingTMG,3ai7v8,Tvayumat,2,Sat Jun 20 16:51:16 2015 UTC,"Coming from 40k myself, I'm still shocked at how much fun the game is. The mechanics are woven into every aspect of the game, so that simply moving and aiming are exciting to do. And above all, the amount of game you get for your money... Drop 50 quid and you're sorted for as many games as you care to play. I've played about 20 games with the same list, and I'm enjoying it more and more as I learn its intricacies. A stark contrast to 40k, where I seem to have to add a unit from each game to the next to stay engaged. 40k still holds a special place in my heart, but x wing has shown me just what's possible with exciting tabletop gaming."
XWingTMG,3ai7v8,Shgrizz,1 point,Sat Jun 20 23:11:30 2015 UTC,"My thoughts exactly.  Given how simple the game SEEMS, once you get out there and start barrel-rolling like it's your job, suddenly you realize exactly how all these simple stats interact to make a shockingly sophisticated game.  40K is an addiction of mine. Even if I'm not getting games regularly I'll no doubt occasionally pick up a model here and there that I like, or fall back to painting a squad of marines, but for the moment, X-Wing is where I go when I want to have seat-of-my-pants FUN.  I also can't help but feel like buying new ships is a better investment. Adding a single TIE bomber to my TIE swarm is a bigger game changer than swapping multiple $40 squads, and I'm only out $13 for it!"
XWingTMG,3ai7v8,Tvayumat,2,Sat Jun 20 23:19:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah, they've really hit the nail on the head with the whole easy to learn, hard to master thing. There seems to be plenty of skill, and enough random chance that it doesn't get too competitive and you can laugh when things go badly. It almost seems like the smash bros of tabletop gaming, in the best way. And I agree with you on TIE fighters. I currently have seven... Yet I feel like I need more. Many, many more."

I don't need an army book? And they come with upgrades that work with other ships?   I only need about 3 ships to make standard tournament sized squads? Not 40-100?  The bases have the unit's stats on them? Sweet!   The bases have slots to help you measure movement? Cool!   Some units can be used in multiple factions? Wha?!   The game is fast, easy to teach and doesn't require four reference books to play? Thank god!   You move concurrently so no-one gets bored? So good.

XWingTMG,3ai7v8,1_73,1 point,Sun Jun 21 13:42:34 2015 UTC,So far I've always had positive reactions. I first picked the game up 3-4 weeks ago. Played the core set with a friend and we fell in love.... with the game not each other.   Since then I've shown 5 other friends and they all enjoyed it. There's now 4 of us who have gone straight into the deep end and the other friends still enjoy games but usually with my ships when they come over.
XWingTMG,3ai7v8,zombiemann,1 point,Mon Jun 22 00:01:16 2015 UTC,"Speaking as someone who recently got into it (bought my first ships just under 2 months ago:  I really like how little you need to play it. I started off with just the Core and Rebel Aces and had a decent enough Rebel list that got me a few victories.  The mechanics are simple, which makes it really easy to show people. ""You move like this, shoot like this, these are actions, you roll these dice"". Extremely easy to learn, and then individual cards have their rules on them, which once you learn the lingo and symbols (also easy to do), you're good to go and will understand the mechanics of pretty much any card.  On the flipside though, it has surprising depth. With so many different pilot cards, the one ship can work almost completely differently - an X-Wing is still an X-Wing, but Wedge flies a lot differently than Wes (or at least, you probably should fly them differently) and they have different uses.  And how the majority of upgrade cards are universal is quite cool.  The only things I don't like are:   how expensive it is, at least where I live - expansions cost 60zł usually, which is ""only"" 15-20 dollars, but really it's more like $40 at least, due to what the wages are. how you can only get certain cards in certain expansions. It's kinda frustrating because I don't really want to get ships I will never fly/don't intend to fly just because of a card or two."
XWingTMG,3ai7v8,Tvayumat,1 point,Mon Jun 22 11:00:26 2015 UTC,"My impressions? I feel it's way too random, and games last too long.  I would have done away with attack dice all-together and narrowed the firing arcs. If my X-Wing has 3 attack, and you're in my firing arc, that would simply count as 3 hits you need to deal with. Games would be more strategy-based and quicker.  That being said, I do love the game despite those complaints."
XWingTMG,3ai7v8,bl1y,12,Sat Jun 20 12:55:29 2015 UTC,"Have you looked at Armada? There are only attack dice.  The two sets of random number generators can lead to swingy events (a tie fighter that hangs around because it only rolls evades vs a soontir fel getting one shot by a Z-95 through an asteroid), but also leads to exciting ones where the outcome is unknown. It is also another stat on a ship that can be varied to create different feels of ships (Xwings and Starvipers have  the same HP for example).  Unpredictable board states are important for a game to be popular. Fully deterministic games (Chess, Go, etc.) can run into the problem of skill gaps. Without an underdog having a chance it is much more difficult to find opponents in casual settings."
XWingTMG,3ai7v8,1_73,4,Sat Jun 20 14:09:34 2015 UTC,"""Fully deterministic games (Chess, Go, etc.) can run into the problem of skill gaps. Without an underdog having a chance it is much more difficult to find opponents in casual settings.""  Very well put! This is why it's such a great game."

XWingTMG,3ai7v8,Inquisitorsz,2,Sat Jun 20 16:55:08 2015 UTC,"What I really love about X Wing is that every rule, save for some specialty weapons, is found in ONE book.  No codexs, no updates, just a simple rulebook and a few reference cards."

XWingTMG,3ai7v8,Thopterthallid,4,Sun Jun 21 00:23:55 2015 UTC,"Still the world champion of 2013 is the same as from 2014, so there must be skill involved. Removing dice would make it a completely different game, and, actually remove some excitement. Xwing is one of the few games where losing is not so bad, since you always have some chance at coming back. And that makes players coming back."
XWingTMG,3ai7v8,bl1y,1 point,Sat Jun 20 13:46:10 2015 UTC,"I feel it's way too random    This is the same feeling some friends had while watching videos of play. I had planned to pickup X-Wing and some key expansion bits for my casual board gaming friends. But after showing them some vids, they decided to go with Armada instead. Armada still has dice rolls, but a string of good/bad dice rolls seems easier to  impact with good/bad player decisions.    That being said, I do love the game despite those complaints.    This is why I plan to buy it anyway. Not quite as large a set to start with as originally planned, but enough to get a good taste. Now just a base set + Falcon + Slave 1 will need to do. Essentially 2 pre-set sides for people to fly casually. Falcon/Xwing vs Slave1/2xTie."

XWingTMG,3aigk8,mxzf,1 point,Sat Jun 20 14:40:36 2015 UTC,"My first thought is that you could buy a singleton Interceptor and find another Autothrusters to run Soontir Fel and Carnor Jax together with PTL+AT+Shield Upgrade on both of them, which comes to 71 points total.  Without buying anything new though, I'd probably run Jax with PTL+AT+SU and then 40 points in a Firespray.  Drop the SU on Jax and/or switch to a Royal Guard if you want to put more points on the firespray or wedge in a third ship."
XWingTMG,3aigk8,boredompwndu,1 point,Sat Jun 20 14:44:14 2015 UTC,"Thanks. I actually had a build that was similar to that second one. It was a Tie Interceptor with Jax that had Royal Guard Title with Autothrusters and Shield, as well as a Firespray with Krassis as pilot and a heavy laser cannon on it. Totaled up to 75 points even. I think the Firespray goes over 40 points though."
XWingTMG,3aigk8,Late_for_something,1 point,Sat Jun 20 14:49:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it would be 43, since you dropped PTL to get it on there.  Personally, I would drop the shield upgrade before I'd drop PTL on an interceptor.  That second action is so useful, especially on Jax who often wants to boost+barrel roll to get within 1 of his target so his ability triggers.  Another combo I'd considder running would be 2x Royal Guard with PTL and 25 points worth of TIEs (or one tie and some upgrades).  Royal Guards are very good for their price, especially with PTL."
XWingTMG,3aigk8,Halinn,2,Sat Jun 20 14:56:47 2015 UTC,"OK, cool. This is the stuff I wanna know; the theory behind the game and why players choose certain combos over others. So thanks a bunch for providing that little bit extra.   I'll definitely restructure my list and get PTL on Jax and drop the shield. I'll also consider the Royal Guards as well in future play sessions."
XWingTMG,3aih84,dndnub,1 point,Sat Jun 20 14:36:49 2015 UTC,"What you really want to do with the Decimator is fly it toward the enemy ships at a bit of an angle or offset to the side of them, then make use of your engine upgrade to boost past them or to their side. That way, you're still able to fire on them with your turret, but they're not getting to shoot at you."
XWingTMG,3aih84,EdgeOfDreams,1 point,Sat Jun 20 15:11:09 2015 UTC,"I've been running this exact list for a few tournaments, done pretty well. My strategies are as follows:  If I'm super scared of something (4 B-Wings, etc.), I stick both on the other side of the board. If it's anything that can't take out my Deci in the first pass, I put the Decimator in jousting position (straight across from it). I'll either put Soontir in the middle or on the other side of the Decimator, away from the enemies. I generally go max speed for the first round or two, coming in fast. Once I think anyone'll have a shot at Soontir, I tank up (two focus and an evade). I usually boost or focus with the Deci, since RAC's ability and Predator will almost always get you three or more hits.  If they ignore Soontir, they will regret it. If they focus Soontir, you pound them with the Decimator. I've usually gone 100-0 with this list (unless I do something completely retarded)"

XWingTMG,3akiar,Tzelanit,19,Sun Jun 21 03:38:10 2015 UTC,"OP has never seen a girl player, thus girls must not exist </sarcasm>  In all seriousness, in my experience, hobby shops can be pretty toxic places for women. Lots of unwanted attention from a group of boys and men who maybe have a higher than normal likelihood of being socially awkward.  I've known a few women who enjoy various hobbies of similar ilk, but often prefer to enjoy the hobby privately. The ones I've known to frequent public gatherings often do so with their boyfriend/husband.  I don't know of any that play X-Wing, but I live in a remote northern Ontario town, and the X-Wing crowd is currently 3 guys, myself included. I'm actually kind of surprised we've got that many."
XWingTMG,3akiar,tractgildart,8,Sun Jun 21 04:00:25 2015 UTC,"No no no, see when you're going to ask a question like this you have to put it in terms of demographics and broadening appeal and fanbase. You don't ask ""are there any girl players"", you ask ""how does this game appeal to the female demographic?"" You don't ask ""are they serious players"", you ask ""what proportion of the collecting/owning player base (as opposed to those who simply play using others' pieces) are female?"" And you follow it up by asking how can that appeal be broadened for a more inclusive environment. See, you gotta be sneaky with your borderline sexist comments.  And the answer from me is that I've had several women try the game and enjoy it, but I don't know any personally that are collecting the ships. That being said, of the 15 or 20 people I've introduced the game to, only 2-3 of them have bought their own pieces. So it may be that the same proportions of player/collector exist, just that my female proportion hasn't grown to the point where that fraction becomes higher than 1."

XWingTMG,3aejz6,X-factor103,7,Fri Jun 19 14:06:13 2015 UTC,"I have had a ton of success with PTL Jake (& Autothrusters) - his ability combined with his range of actions makes him a great arc dodger with PTL.  However, the problem with most of the hyper-maneuverable rebel ships is that the base pilot skill isn't enough to dodge the guys you really need to dodge. For Jake specifically, Soontir and Whisper are huge problems, and those are very popular pilots in the meta right now.  This all combines into a ship that you spend a ton of points on that you're not always going to get a shot with, and if you do get a shot, you're likely throwing two attack (as you mentioned).  I love A's and I've had some great matches with them - Jake chasing down a full health Kath in the endgame to take her out without being hit was the epitome of their effectiveness, but too often the game is going to be lost before you even put down your first maneuver.  I think the best way to roll an A is as an high agility blocker in the Prototype. 3 green dice plus an evade token make for a ship that's going to survive a whole lot longer than a Z in a blocking role."
XWingTMG,3aejz6,mattman676,9,Fri Jun 19 15:22:07 2015 UTC,This was against me. Jake is an asshole.
XWingTMG,3aejz6,sacimino40,6,Fri Jun 19 18:35:53 2015 UTC,"Obviously it will depend on which pilot you're using, but here are my overall thoughts on A-Wings.  The dial is great, so use it.   By this I mean, fly right into those asteroids and either force the enemy to come in after you (with their likely inferior dials) or avoid the asteroids and let you get in range 1 of your enemy while remaining out of arc.  The two attack dice are not fun, but I usually send my A-Wings after things that have 2 AGI or less.    They've successfully burned down Firesprays and X-Wings before.     Beware 3+ AGI opponents.   They hate Phantoms.   This is one of the reasons why I seldom take all-A-Wing lists anymore.   It simply isn't able to take all comers.  For upgrades, consider:  Chardaan Refit:   Unless you're taking proton rockets, this is a mandatory upgrade in my opinion.     I've experimented with other missiles prior to Rebel Aces being released and was consistently underwhelmed.    A-Wing Test Pilot:   I almost always take it for unique pilots.  For greens, it really depends on the role I see for them.   If they're going to be a PTL procket caddy, there really isn't a need to make it more expensive by adding another EPT.  Push the Limit:   It will help you remain alive when you're in the enemy's sights and maximize those 2 attack dice when you have them in yours.    If you're anything like me you'll be using the 2 turn to clear stress.   A wonderful combination.  Outmaneuver:   Remember how I talked about using the asteroids to get around the enemy who is avoiding the field?    This helps with that.    It's great synergy with PTL is that it doesn't require an action and is ""always on"".  It also addresses the main problem with having two attack dice - which is enemy defense dice.  Predator:   I don't like this as much, mainly because it basically does something that I could already do with one of the A-Wings actions (via target lock) and it does nothing to address the fact that your two hits are probably going to be cancelled outright be a focused TIE anyway.    A lot of other A-Wing pilots swear by it thought, so here it is.  Wingman:   A-Wings can keep up with absolutely anyone.  Being able to be nearby and yank a stress off every turn is super useful for those ships whose dial may not contain as much green (like a YT-2400 for example).     Veteran Instincts:   A good upgrade if you're low on points and have someone like Jake or Tycho in your squadron.   Keep in mind that you are sacrificing their ability to take upgrades which will help them live longer.  I would almost always pair this with PTL.  For Tycho you can get into some fun upgrades like expert handling or Daredevil, but I could write a whole post detailing what upgrades are good on that crazy guy.  Proton Rockets:  Love these things.   They are good, well priced ordnance.    Easy to fire (well, except the range) and with PTL you can hit like a truck.  Consider these on a higher pilot skill guy like Jake or Tycho. but keep in mind that this will make whatever pilot is carrying them a huge target.  Autothrusters:   Do you want to be annoying?  Because this is how get to be annoying.  These are mostly viewed as ways to keep things like Interceptors and Aggressors alive, but with an A-Wing you're taking a ship that already has toughness and good defense dice and adding another layer.   The problem arises in that A-Wings usually want to operate at range one of an opponent in order to get that extra attack die.    However, with all the fat turrets in the game, it's a good idea for your more expensive guys to have this just in case.  Overall, play your A-Wings aggressively and they will reward you.   Dive into asteroid fields where your maneuverability will be most useful.    Get into close range firefights within the enemy where your array of turn maneuvers will be most useful and where you will get an extra attack die."
XWingTMG,3aejz6,Droofus,2,Fri Jun 19 17:19:04 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the long post! This confirms many of the suspicions I'm having about A-wings. Mainly, don't rely on your piddly little 2 red dice to do much without backup. You want to get in range 1 for the extra die, pick low agility targets (helping that along with outmaneuver), or pack big whallops with p-rockets.  I'm experimenting with this now with Tycho (of course) but also Gemmer + lone wolf. His ability to gain extra defense when mixed up in enemies, plus the ability to reroll some stuff, has me really interested to see just how far he can push his luck and his ship."

XWingTMG,3aejz6,PCGamerPirate,3,Sat Jun 20 18:48:01 2015 UTC,I find they work best as blockers. They also do well when there are bigger threats on the field so they can fly really aggressively and get some range 1 attacks without fear of getting shot or losing focus tokens to defense.
XWingTMG,3aejz6,attredies,2,Fri Jun 19 16:01:59 2015 UTC,"Personally I always either run Jake with Outmaneuver, Stealthdevice/autothrusters and PTL (getting focus, Boost, barrel roll, and evade (pick your three out of the list) to keep outside their arc, if you stay in their arc, not get hit, and then get a better chance at hitting with outmaneuver.  Tycho is my other top choice, running PTL, Autothruster/Stealth, Expert Handling.  This allows two options for boost/barrelroll/evade/focus, but also knocks away the restriction of doing a green maneuver after.  Tycho tends to survive longer but Jake does more damage.    Honestly I have never had much luck with generic A's, but those two named pilots win the day for me in my rebel lists"

XWingTMG,3aejz6,KTreu42,2,Fri Jun 19 16:35:58 2015 UTC,"Give them PTL + Outmaneuver, IMO.  Taking away a green die is almost as good as adding a red die, and they have the ability to out-flank stuff.  Especially high PS Jake or Tycho.  Gemmer is also fun, you can zip in and unload proton rockets and take 4 green dice for the counterattack.  Otherwise, you can take the Green Squadron Pilots and load them with 2 EPTs.  In general, they are too expensive to swarm, so I think it's worth stacking a few upgrades on them and then being very crafty flying them."
XWingTMG,3aejz6,DangerFord,1 point,Fri Jun 19 19:17:21 2015 UTC,"I LOVE A-wings. They are, by far, my favorite ship. I really like Jake and Tycho, but I think Gemmer is the unsung hero of the bunch. With VI, Autothrusters, Chardaan, and the title he comes in really cheap at 23 points. Stay out of arc and boost to get really close to you target. Range 1 will give him an extra attack die AND an extra evade die when defending.   I've been running a lot of lists with him and Jake (same upgrades as Gemmer plus PTL) plus something beefy (Chewie, Keyan, Dash) and I've had some pretty good success.   I think they work so well because they have good movement and action economy."
XWingTMG,3aejz6,beer_demon,1 point,Fri Jun 19 14:38:07 2015 UTC,"I like a wings but they are not easy to use and very unforgiving of mistakes, so not good for beginners, and extra work for advanced users so not that attractive for competitive play.    I usually use them to make the opponent make mistakes and then make him pay for them, as an example I have a y wing with ion turret, so if the opponent focuses on it I flank with the A and hit at close range, if however they try to avoid the flank they let my ywing ionize them and then if the A survives now they have two problems.  Also, proton rockets."

XWingTMG,3aejz6,bl1y,1 point,Fri Jun 19 17:04:08 2015 UTC,Autothrusters is probably a good idea but I think the best use for A-wings in a turret heavy is to block off boosting lanes for turret ships.  You have to corral big ships and punish them for being inefficient. Blocking is great too. A-wings are great at both.

XWingTMG,3afkgu,PoeGhost,1 point,Fri Jun 19 22:50:06 2015 UTC,Well I'll see what I can do.
XWingTMG,3af9i8,PCGamerPirate,4,Fri Jun 19 17:30:07 2015 UTC,"IG-2001, Agressor only title. 6 points.  When another ship with the IG-2001 title performs an action, you may also perform that action."
XWingTMG,3af9i8,Abre_Los_Ojos,2,Fri Jun 19 17:40:40 2015 UTC,"you may also perform that action.   I think it should be a ""you must""."
XWingTMG,3af9i8,Athole,1 point,Fri Jun 19 18:52:54 2015 UTC,"But then you get situations where the game is forcing a ship to do an action it can't legally perform (boosting into no legal position,  doing an action it has already done in the turn, etc)."
XWingTMG,3af9i8,BorisIHateReddit,1 point,Fri Jun 19 21:36:11 2015 UTC,"Could make it a requirement of the title.  Link them similar to the shared abilities of the IG-2000 title, but if all ships with the title can't perform an action, then none of them get to.  So If you're flying dual IGs, maybe the first one moves then boosts, which immediately gives the second a boost as well.  Then the second one moves and focuses, which gives the first a focus as well.  And if one of the two was IG88C, they'd each get an evade as well.  It could get really fun with PTL.  First ship moves, takes an action, triggers PTL for a second action.  Second ship gets both actions as well, but only the first takes a stress.  Second ship then moves, also gets 2 actions (and resulting stress).  That'd be 4 potential actions per turn (at which point you're running out of things to do...).  you could also alternate who uses ptl so you only ever have 1 stressed at a time and only get 3 per turn."

XWingTMG,3af9i8,bl1y,1 point,Sat Jun 20 12:31:17 2015 UTC,"The title costs way too much, especially when you have to run 2 of them. Probably worth 0 points (maybe 1), as you're giving up B's ability for a second action. I think the combo is Wingman on one and PtL on the second aggressor to give both 3 actions and then quickly remove the stress. I do think it gives the normal title some real competition."
XWingTMG,3af9i8,antigrapist,2,Fri Jun 19 18:19:37 2015 UTC,"It's a pretty powerful Title.  Now you don't need Advanced Sensors.  Move the ship that has a clear path to take action so the other gets an action before it moves and bumps.  Not to mention the action economy this gives you.  I'd say 2-3 points is fair so you have to decide on forgoing some of the equipment that may make this flat out OP.  edit: Adv Sensors are 3 points, so I'd say a minimum of 3 and maybe even 4."
XWingTMG,3af9i8,killd1,2,Fri Jun 19 18:37:15 2015 UTC,I ran wingman on both B and D. You can basically fly an inward facing circle.
XWingTMG,3af9i8,towmule,1 point,Fri Jun 19 22:07:45 2015 UTC,"No there is nothing wrong with that title. If one boosts, then the other ship can boost BEFORE it moves. That is a REALLY powerful combo."
XWingTMG,3af9i8,skyshroudace,1 point,Fri Jun 19 18:34:11 2015 UTC,"You can already do that with advanced sensors, which is commonly run and only costs 3 points per ship and your system slot.  You're not taking into account the opportunity cost of not having B's ability on a second ship. Gunner is a 5 point upgrade and is one of the most powerful abilities in the game. That's why (almost) no one runs an aggressor squad without B and any alternative to the normal title shouldn't cost very much.   Maybe this is worth 1-2 points, but it's certainly not worth 6 points per aggressor."
XWingTMG,3af9i8,antigrapist,1 point,Fri Jun 19 18:55:58 2015 UTC,"It frees up your systems slot for something else, and if you pair it with PTL, now one ship can take 3 actions without being stressed.  Potentially all of them before it moves."
XWingTMG,3af9i8,scuff,1 point,Fri Jun 19 19:41:09 2015 UTC,"Was a little unsure about the cost, I think it's really powerful in the case /u/killd1 made. Maybe 2 or 3 points?"
XWingTMG,3af9i8,Abre_Los_Ojos,1 point,Fri Jun 19 18:45:04 2015 UTC,2 points is probably a good starting point at if you were going to playtest it and then adjust accordingly.

XWingTMG,3af9i8,Abre_Los_Ojos,3,Fri Jun 19 22:49:41 2015 UTC,"2.0, Agressor only title. 1 point unique  This ship gains the SLAM action.  Yes it's SLAM for 1 point, but it is also taking the place of the IG 2000 title. Really a way to make a single IG list a little more fun.   :)"
XWingTMG,3af9i8,cassarlex,2,Fri Jun 19 22:23:22 2015 UTC,I give you alternate ability IG88's.  IG-88A is a variant on the original's health regeneration.  IG-88B also makes IG88's more accurate but does so in a different way. Might be a reason to bring ion or flechette cannons.  IG-88C loves boosting and not getting hit like its counterpart. Better at surviving swarms rather than huge hits.  IG-88D is just as slippery as its twin also. Can shorten its sloops and k to possibly get some use out of an autoblaster.  Need a lot of playtesting to tweak the strength of these abilities. IG-88A was definitely a tricky one to write and keep balanced.
XWingTMG,3af9i8,skyshroudace,2,Fri Jun 19 18:02:28 2015 UTC,"Wow, those are all REALLY over powered. Those should be 50+ point pilots. IG-88B never missing with an ion cannon?"
XWingTMG,3af9i8,antigrapist,5,Fri Jun 19 18:19:02 2015 UTC,A 40+ point ship that can only deal 1 damage per turn to a target directly in front of it will lose you far more games than it helps you win.   Ten Numb can already make undodgeable ion cannon shots and he's basically unusable competitively.
XWingTMG,3af9i8,VanderLegion,2,Fri Jun 19 18:46:30 2015 UTC,"It'd probably actually be better with a mangler cannon than it is with an ion.  Basically it works out similar to ten numb in that case.  As long as you get enough hits with the 2 bonus to hit the target, at least 1 of them will be a crit, which would not then be cancelled by the cancelling 2 hits, so it'd be close to a guaranteed crit every turn."
XWingTMG,3af9i8,Athole,1 point,Sat Jun 20 08:18:31 2015 UTC,Ten Numb can also make undodgeable mangler canon shots which is far better.
XWingTMG,3af9i8,antigrapist,2,Fri Jun 19 23:33:24 2015 UTC,"A is almost certainly underpowered in this iteration. Wavered a lot between a lot of health regeneration. I will probably change it to discard ship crits at the end of the end phase (as per /u/antigrapist suggestion)  B is close to being overpowered but a 39 point ship doing one damage a turn isn't anything to write home about. It also isn't a guaranteed ion (but almost). Ways I've thought to weaken this ability is requiring a target lock or decreasing the hit and subsequent cancellation to 1.  C may seem overpowered against swarms but we all know how unreliable green dice can be. One way to weaken this ability is to increase agility by 1 until hit OR the end of the combat phase (whichever comes first).  D is slightly more slippery than the original with an extra K-turn, but can't rotate his firing arc as well as original D (moving that arc laterally is a problem a lot of the time). Probably the one that doesn't need any tweaking but like suggestions."
XWingTMG,3af9i8,antigrapist,1 point,Fri Jun 19 19:18:29 2015 UTC,"I actually think C is underpowered in the current meta, as I'd rather have an evade token then +1 agility against almost everything. You need to be getting shot 3-4 times in a single turn before it starts to break even, but how many turns a game is that going to happen, especially when you're boosting?"
XWingTMG,3af9i8,skyshroudace,1 point,Fri Jun 19 20:31:40 2015 UTC,"If this was to be really great, I think you'd need to make them greek letters to avoid confusion but still prevent you from taking both B and beta, for example.  I think A could flip all face up crits facedown in the end phase, it'd just be a worse chewbacca and even then I'm not sure it's better than the normal A. Are you really getting any more value than regaining one shield in most games and 2-3 in others? Maybe Alpha could discard ship crits?  Beta's ability is really well designed. Maybe it should require a cannon to work, but there is some real manger / crit synergy when shooting at hard targets like fel."
XWingTMG,3af9i8,rsixidor,2,Fri Jun 19 18:29:03 2015 UTC,Cannon: Aggressor (IG-2000) only Tractor beam: 8pts Range 1-2 4 dice If this attack hits cancel all dice and the ship suffers 1 damage. Then the ship MUST make a barrel roll towards the Agressor. If the ship is unable to due to overlapping with another ship it instead suffers 1 crit damage.
XWingTMG,3af9i8,skyshroudace,2,Fri Jun 19 18:29:11 2015 UTC,Doesn't need to be Aggressor only. TIE Defenders ran tractor beams occasionally as well.
XWingTMG,3af9i8,mxzf,1 point,Fri Jun 19 18:57:58 2015 UTC,"True, but I feel there needs to be limitations on it. M3A's should not be able to use it. It would be very heavily used if universal."
XWingTMG,3af9i8,rsixidor,2,Fri Jun 19 19:02:58 2015 UTC,"I have a feeling that 8 points would limit it pretty heavily.  If you slap that on a M3-A, you've just spent at least a quarter of your points on a fairly fragile ship with only 3HP and not a lot of potential to boost its defense.  It's also only doing one or two damage per turn.  For 8 points, I feel like that's a reasonable tradeoff."
XWingTMG,3af9i8,Ryddari,1 point,Fri Jun 19 19:09:12 2015 UTC,I don't see a problem with it. Aggressor's would have to spend 10 points to mount this thing and mounting ridiculous weaponry is what that ship is all about.  HLC still seems a better choice at this cost range because 4 potentials hits.
XWingTMG,3af9i8,bl1y,2,Fri Jun 19 19:40:51 2015 UTC,IG-88E: When defending you may spend an Ion token as though it was a Focus token.  Makes you hilariously hard to ionize and has neat synergy with Feeback Array.
XWingTMG,3af9i8,ithaka21,1 point,Fri Jun 19 22:25:29 2015 UTC,"I'd just like to see IG-88A changed so that both ships get back a shield when either of them kills an enemy.  I think getting 1 shield back isn't enough to make the skill competitive with the others, especially against 2 ship lists. But if you get back 2 shields it starts to get very interesting, especially if you think you might see a swarm or two."

XWingTMG,3aesy8,masste,2,Fri Jun 19 15:22:02 2015 UTC,"Whisper with VI and adv. Cloaking is the standard go-to for phantoms. Generally you just want to keep your opponent guessing on where you'll end up, and use that to your advantage. Adv. Cloaking really works best on the named pilots due to the higher pilot skill, for sigmas and such, stigium is a tad bit more common. Some fun builds though include pilots like howl runner with swarm tactics or decoy to allow the lower ships to fire sooner and utilize adv. Cloaking.  . My favorite and go-to phantom build is Echo with outmaneuver, adv cloaking, recon spec or rebel cap, and fire controls. It can be tricky to use , but if done right it hits like a truck and barely gets touched. Leaves a good chunk of points for whatever kind of list you want to accompany it."
XWingTMG,3aesy8,codyryan17,1 point,Fri Jun 19 15:31:06 2015 UTC,I keep hearing that people are using the stygium particle accelerator on low pilot skill ships. How does this help. Are people just cloaking and missing shots every other turn?
XWingTMG,3aesy8,earlofhoundstooth,2,Fri Jun 19 16:23:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah, as best I understand it you use hit-and run tactics, similar to what you might do with Corran Horn."
XWingTMG,3aesy8,EdgeOfDreams,2,Fri Jun 19 16:42:05 2015 UTC,"Basically yeah, you run in a do damage , maybe have fcs for the swoop around . I know a guy who ran 3 sigmas with a bunch of bells and whistles that faired well in regionals"
XWingTMG,3aesy8,codyryan17,2,Fri Jun 19 16:49:26 2015 UTC,"It's really only useful on the opening engagement and when you suspect you're getting into a bad position. As you point out, flickering every other turn on purpose just to get evade tokens is silly."
XWingTMG,3aesy8,quarrel,2,Fri Jun 19 16:52:33 2015 UTC,"As someone that has made great use of the low PS phantoms, no that is not whats its for.  I generally run a 29 point sigma with FCS and SPA.  On the first turn of combat I will have decloaked so I will be sitting on focus + evade.  This will generally keep you alive with your native 2 agility.  After your first turn, you will have a target lock on what ever the sigma is hunting to help you with hitting, and you either barrel roll or evade to keep yourself alive.  4 dice with TL is going to put out some hurt each turn.  After your initial target is dead or you need to bug out, then you cloak, and still get an evade token to help keep you alive.  Makes that 4 total HP go a lot farther."
XWingTMG,3aesy8,starslinger72,2,Fri Jun 19 18:02:47 2015 UTC,While you're getting used to flying them in a casual setting you should equip your Phantom with Intelligence Agent in the crew slot. It's only one point and it takes some of the guesswork out of the decloak. You use Intel at the start of the activation phase to look at the dial of a ship near the Phantom and then decloak accordingly.  Echo is far more difficult to fly than Whisper because you are forced to use the 2-Bank for your decloaking so definitely start learning with Whisper.

XWingTMG,3aesy8,ThrobRinkor,1 point,Sun Jun 21 15:05:14 2015 UTC,"Question about Echo... when you decloak, you use the 2-Bank template... I get that. It makes sense for the barrel-roll decloak. Do you still use the 2-Bank template for the forward decloak? Or can Echo not decloak forward at all?   I'm pretty use you just use the different template and can still go in all 3 directions... which gives Echo 6 unique decloak locations compared to Whisper's 3, but I just wanted to check."
XWingTMG,3aesy8,Inquisitorsz,1 point,Mon Jun 22 01:12:03 2015 UTC,"Echo uses the 2-Bank for all decloak movements. That includes both the barrel roll to decloak to the side and the boost ahead. Here's a quick reference for all the ways Echo can decloak.  Edit: When you fly Echo it's good to know the basic math behind how templates change your facing compared to what you put into the dial. When Echo decloaks she always changes her facing 45o to the left or the right. This means when you lock in a maneuver you have to adjust between bank, turn, and straight in intervals of 45o in order to achieve the proper final position. Put down your mat and practice moving each decloak option followed by a bank, turn, and straight maneuver. Learn what they all look like."

I've had great luck mixing the base one + the 2pt accelerator upgrade in with a Decimator and another named tie.  The Decimator draws a lot of attention and the Phantom flanks up behind and just hammers people.  I feel slightly less paranoid running them at 27 points than I do into the 35+ point ranges with the named ones.  Two shields + two hull is a bit on the squishy side.  But dang do they leave a mark if you can drop in behind at range 1 and throw 5 dice at somebody.    Thy are one of the higher learning curve ships to fly.  For me it's not so much about placement, I'm not bad at that.  It's more about planning for arcs of the other player after you decloak.  That's why I like flying them with the decimator.  It tends to suck people to it to focus fire and the Phantom goes out hunting on the edges."
XWingTMG,3aesy8,pacsman,1 point,Fri Jun 19 19:25:44 2015 UTC,"There are some good regionals/nationals level matches on youtube in the last couple of years where you can see Whisper in action. I'm a beginner pilot as well, and of the Imperial ships the Phantom is easily my favorite. (go figure, I love the A-wing on the rebels)  I've seen some nice tricks with high PS Phantoms (like Whisper) using decloak to ""boost"" before turning, allowing him to effectively fly faster and corner harder. Repeating this it becomes very easy to out-corner your opponents and get behind them.   It's been said to play a lot and guess at where your templates will land before you move, to practice your distance estimating skills. I'd recommend doing the same with the phantom. Once you figure out how far you can boost/roll with your decloak, you'll begin ""planning in advance"" your moves possibly a turn or two ahead, knowing exactly how best to blink around and flank everything! And if you thought those 4 red dice were good normally, getting 5 in range 1 just feels amazing."

Since you'll need a TL and an action to drop the mine, this probably won't happen all at once.    4x Scimitar Squadron + Cluster missiles + Prox mine.  23 points each.  Once wave 7 hits?

But, the phantom has a systems slot.... now, it has no native way to get a target lock, but if Jendon passes one over (or even stranger, use the mod slot for this) now you're throwing 5D + a free crit at range 1.

Page 11:   Cluster Missiles The attacker only needs to spend one target lock to use Cluster Missiles. Cluster Missiles is treated as two separate attacks against the same target. If a ship is equipped with Cluster Missiles and Munitions Failsafe, both attacks must miss for Munitions Failsafe to activate.   Page 12:   Gunner [...] When Gunner is used to perform a primary weapon attack, any additional attacks (such as from Cluster Missiles) are forfeited.   Page 12:   Darth Vader A ship equipped with Darth Vader can use this ability if it has at least 1 hull remaining. If a ship equipped with Darth Vader can attack twice in one round (such as a ship equipped with Gunner or Cluster Missiles), it can use Darth Vader after the first attack. If Darth Vader destroys the ship to which he is equipped, it can still perform its second attack.     There is absolutely nothing in the Errata section concerning Cluster Missiles.  Also, the Gunner entry clearly states that Gunner can be triggered after Cluster Missiles first attack, you just forfeit Cluster Missiles second attack if you choose to do so.

I'd put Targeting Computer on Fel and Reb Captive on Whisper.  That'll leave you with 24 points left.  The two best options here per value are either an omicron shuttle with darth vader or two academies.  The shuttle is a heavy hitter to help you deal with other annoying ace ships, the academies are good blockers who also have some jousting strength.    As far as what obstacles to pick in my experience I don't like obstacles with Whisper because if I land on one it's big trouble and they limit my decloak options making my moves more obvious.  The shuttle probably likes debris more because although it stresses it sometimes you'd rather eat a stress to still be able to shoot as opposed to landing on a rock with it and getting no shot.  Initiative is important with these two ships singularly, because Whisper wants initiative but Fel wants to pass it, so teamed up it's not as important but again this is why I say this is a tough squad to fly because if you lose init with Whisper to another Whisper or PS 9 it means that 9 is shooting at your uncloaked phantom.  Good luck and fly casual."

XWingTMG,3abp98,EdgeOfDreams,5,Fri Jun 19 15:28:28 2015 UTC,I wonder how much they take packaging into consideration when designing the ships. It looks like the K-Wing and Punisher are going to just fit into the small ship clam shells.
XWingTMG,3abp98,pimplezoo,4,Thu Jun 18 20:55:21 2015 UTC,"It's got to be a factor. The StarViper is the only small-base ship so far that came in a larger-than-normal package, and it's no coincidence that the MSRP for it is $5 (33%) higher than other small-base ships. Non-standard packaging or components can end up costing a game company a lot of money if they don't properly plan for it or raise the price accordingly."
XWingTMG,3abp98,Lion_Paw_808,2,Thu Jun 18 21:22:34 2015 UTC,I believe the Decimator came in a larger box then any ship previously had so i guess their not afraid to go outside of the standard packaging but i can see them having limits.

XWingTMG,3acz5c,Scojo91,3,Fri Jun 19 02:39:14 2015 UTC,"The imperial list looks good. It's the typical RAC+Fel list -Gunner +Mara +Title. Seems like a solid change.    The rebel list needs some love. To make this style of list really work, you'll want to run Daggers at PS4 to stress your target before Vrill shoots them. Vrill doesn't need the title, or even the HLC because his ability only works on primary attacks.   Generally, the E2 mod and tactician is the best way to generate stress via a B-wing because you can do more than one damage in an attack and you can stress a target more than once.  You should read Sozin's Tournament report from April where he ran a similar squad that has a little bit more synergy:  Dagger + FCS + B/E2 + Tactician x2,   Vrill + Gunner + Engine Upgrade  Asteroids: 3 biggest debris fields (99 points)    Personally, my favorite squad right now is a four ship rebel control list that relies on R3-A2 and 2x tactician to really limit my opponent's options."

You take a stress if you cancel a crit result (only 1 stress per attack), so I gave her Marksmanship, Gunner, and Experimental Interface. (EI lets her take Marksmanship plus an Evade action.)  It's not good at stressing low agility ships like B-Wings or the Falcon, but can land stress pretty consistently on IG88s, Interceptors, and Phantoms. As far as dealing stress goes, it's not the best thing out there, but she can reliably hand out crits as well, so she's got a bit of flexibility.  I'm still learning to fly it properly, but so far it's been fun having attacks where there's a no win outcome on the green dice. Either you take a crit, or you take a stress. For many ships, either option is awful."

XWingTMG,3acz5c,antigrapist,2,Sat Jun 20 12:28:14 2015 UTC,"Ah, cool. Only thing I don't fully understand is why do I want to take a stress to give a stress on the Y-Wing?   Is it because with the title, I throw so many dice that I don't have to worry about not having an action?  Even still, I can't use it when A K-Turn is needed, which is often on those Y-Wings."
XWingTMG,3acz5c,antigrapist,1 point,Sat Jun 20 20:13:08 2015 UTC,"Because with the title, you can give fat Han who is 60% of your opponent's points two stress while only hurting 25% of your list. Aces like whisper, fel, horn rely on defensive actions to survive, and the combination of multiple stress and ion tokens make them predictable and easy to kill.  Losing your k turn does really hurt, but frequently your opponent will kill the y first, making it not a big loss."

XWingTMG,3abmy9,pimplezoo,3,Fri Jun 19 13:07:55 2015 UTC,"I think the consensus is that they are trying to keep turrets to a minimum within the S&V faction, thus why we didn't get a YT-2400 conversion either."
XWingTMG,3abmy9,i_shit_my_spacepants,2,Thu Jun 18 20:46:30 2015 UTC,The turrets (in-lore) are mods on both the 1300 and the 2400. I think we're likely to see S&V pilots for both ships eventually that simply don't have primary weapon turrets.

Unless they start bringing in Clone Wars stuff, there's not much need for additional factions until there are more canon sources.  Even though they've thoroughly exhausted many of the canon Imp/Rebel stuff, there's a lot more design space in S&V."
XWingTMG,3abmy9,RandomParable,2,Thu Jun 18 23:57:05 2015 UTC,I didn't say there needed to be a 4th faction... but you can't have S&V have two or three times more ships than the other two. Even it if makes sense in the lore.   It's just a possible way to expand the game/universe without making it unfair.  Personally I think they should have split it already.... Bounty Hunters / Smugglers / Pirates etc... maybe they could have slightly different mission objectives rather than just kill everyone
XWingTMG,3abmy9,haroldthebear,2,Fri Jun 19 00:25:10 2015 UTC,"I'm with you on the alternate mission objectives.  It's really hard to balance, but it would certainly give new depth to the game."

EU on Shuttles always seems like a good idea, but only pays off for maybe one round, you are better off holding them back with the red zero move and getting a couple good volleys off.  You could also go Chirpy with Predator if you drop the engine."
XWingTMG,3aayv2,kbdekker,1 point,Thu Jun 18 18:54:46 2015 UTC,"I thought of something similar but perhaps with different tactics. Kenkirk with Predator, Issard with 2OGPs both with tactical Jammer, one with Vader the other with FCS. Start the shuttle's on a flank and Kenkirk in the middle. Likely opponents will target the Decimator but he runs to hide behind the shuttles hopefully making the opposition come at them head on. From their you have a bumpy fortress which uses its non action reliant abilities (predator, FCS. Vader and Issard and TJs) to pound incoming. The sheer space they occupy makes it hard for your enemy to K-turnbehind you, and even if you do you'll likely be in Range on of Kenkirk. Never had TJs work so well but I'd give them a whirl in this build for the want of a better way to spend the last 2 pts. Maybe not the most exciting flying but could frustrate folk amusingly and compared to the Bwing corner cluster that caused some interest last year, this seem more like a fair use of the ships and their abilities."
XWingTMG,3ab85r,CommanderLink,6,Thu Jun 18 18:13:06 2015 UTC,"Firepower, durability, and the ability to tack on a cannon (HLC? Yes please) are all draws. But the best part of a B-Wing may just be the Systems Upgrade slot. Add a Fire Control System to hound your target with target locks and free up an action. Put on Advanced Sensors and use an action before you move, which can be great for when you're about to execute a red maneuver. These are as valuable on the lowly Blue Squadron pilots as they are on named Aces.  And then the pilot abilities can be downright dirty. Ten Numb with a Mangler Cannon all but ensures an unstoppable crit every time he fires. Keyan Farlander can put the maneuver dial issue to rest by burning that stress you get from red maneuvers as a quasi-focus token on offense. Options for days. Don't underestimate the B-Wing, it's a magnificent ship."
XWingTMG,3ab85r,GNOIZ1C,4,Thu Jun 18 18:27:05 2015 UTC,"Not to mention on Keyan, but if I've learned my rules correctly you are allowed to spend tokens even if there would be no effect. Which means as long as you can shoot with Keyan, you can burn the stress off (regardless of the lack of focus symbols on the dice). Just make sure you leave him with a shot if you stress out."
XWingTMG,3ab85r,X-factor103,1 point,Thu Jun 18 19:35:15 2015 UTC,"Yep.  As long as he can attempt to attack, he can unstress.  Of course, you also have to be careful with him and make sure you actually stress him if you're counting on using it.  One time I used Advanced Sensors+PTL on him and then followed up with a green maneuver.  Needless to say, I was annoyed at myself when I realized what I'd done."
XWingTMG,3ab85r,mxzf,2,Fri Jun 19 01:08:54 2015 UTC,"lol yep. to start off on my build with Keyan, this is why I'm running FCS and not AS. I'd be too tempted to lose track of things and mess myself up. Need to earn my wings first."

XWingTMG,3ab85r,GNOIZ1C,1 point,Fri Jun 19 19:06:16 2015 UTC,"Though on Keyan that'd be almost pointless, since you can already spend his stress token as a Focus on offense, and a Focus for defense won't necessarily help you out all that much."
XWingTMG,3ab85r,MaximusNerdius,1 point,Fri Jun 19 19:58:06 2015 UTC,Honestly I'd rather have the focus for defense even with 1 agi.  Yeah the odds of it being used are not great but it can stop 1 damage every turn and that can add up.  Since he's gunna be taking multiple shots a turn he might get defensive use out of it.  As well as defending at range and or behind obstacles.  There are probably better crew to put with him or even just give him an engine upgrade but I like the action economy of it all.
XWingTMG,3ab85r,Reggroyx,5,Fri Jun 19 20:05:18 2015 UTC,"4 B's with Advanced Sensors, wreck EVERYTHING."
XWingTMG,3ab85r,EdgeOfDreams,3,Thu Jun 18 18:40:13 2015 UTC,"The B-Wing is primarily a jouster. It's got a lot of health for a small ship, so at 22 points for a generic you can easily afford to throw multiple with no upgrades on the field, fly them straight at your opponent, and just blast away.  The Systems upgrade slot lets you put on something like a Fire Control system to improve its action economy and damage output further, or Advanced Sensors to give it the option to barrel roll before moving. Alternatively, the B-Wing/E2 title lets you add a crew member, with Tactician being the most popular one, turning the B-Wing into a combination of both damage and control. Either way, you can keep the B-Wing at 25 points or less for a very powerful generic.  The Cannon slot also opens up some options. Heavy Laser Canon is probably a bit too expensive on the generics, since by the time you slap one of those on two or three B-Wings, you could have had a whole extra ship in your squad. Ion Canons are interesting for a control list, though, especially combined with Tactician - Stress and Ion at the same time really shuts an enemy ship down.  While the generics are most popular for B-Wings, there's at least a couple named pilots that are solid as well. Keyan Farlander, for example, can take a combination of Push The Limit, Engine Upgrade, and Advanced Sensors, which play nicely with his ability to effectively turn stress into an offensive focus token. Suddenly you've got a Rebel equivalent of Soontir Fel, trading off some of the Interceptor's maneuverability and agility for 5 whole shield points and the ability to barrel roll and/or boost BEFORE your normal movement. Ten Numb can be combined with a card like Mangler Cannon or Calculation to guarantee one of his dice is a crit to make use of his ability."
XWingTMG,3ab85r,ernesto__-,2,Thu Jun 18 18:27:50 2015 UTC,"Powerful generic's are my favourite thing, so this is sounding good. especially with the /E2 upgrade. I've never made a list before, all of my games so far have been against first timers so i tried to do things different each time. i'm thinking i should invest some time into one i can pick up and roll with and know which abilities i have, since i've lost 4/5 games played"
XWingTMG,3ab85r,KTreu42,2,Thu Jun 18 18:37:25 2015 UTC,"B wings are heavy hitters, strap a cannon on em, Fire control system, then fly them straight at the desired targets. Things can take a beating, while giving a beating."
XWingTMG,3ab85r,DangerFord,2,Thu Jun 18 21:35:06 2015 UTC,"I failed with B's early on by trying to load one up with a bunch of points in a small squad.  They are easy pickin's if you make just one a priority target.  Best used in groups, since they can't run or dodge arcs well at all and they have terrible agility."
XWingTMG,3ab85r,Kiz74,2,Thu Jun 18 22:12:56 2015 UTC,"You may not think it's very maneuverable but that barrel roll can be really effective in getting you in just the right position. I've been enjoying a beefed out Keyan with Opportunist, HLC, FCS, and Gunner lately. You roll 5 dice with Opportunist, then shed stress to his ability. If there's no hit then Gunner and do it all over again, this time with a target lock. Since you have a target lock and a faux-cus (get it?!) then you can spend you action on a barrel roll or focus up for defense for the rest of the game."

Since Yorr has Engine Upgrade, I'd give Vader Squad Leader so he can toss Yorr a second free action, or give one of the TIEs a second action if the situation warrants.  That gives you a point for initiative."

XWingTMG,3abpey,KTreu42,2,Thu Jun 18 22:14:51 2015 UTC,"Yes, but then you have to fly green maneuvers only as if Vader ends the turn stressed, no actions at all the next turn. And the advanced has very limited greens (2/3 forward and 1 bank).   Predator or outmaneuver would increase the hitting power and make him more of a beast than a third action."

More common/popular is something like Academy Pilot x 6 + Howlrunner, with a few spare points to toss upgrades onto a couple of those ships.  There's also Black Squadron x 5 + Howlrunner with every ship having Swarm Tactics attached, so they all shoot at PS 8."

XWingTMG,3abj9q,the_shib,4,Thu Jun 18 19:33:05 2015 UTC,"Thematically, I like that torpedoes/missles only fire within the arc (a reasonable spread that the fighter can maneuver to face without the adjustment of a full move). The concept of a missle turret ship is an interesting one though and would:   either make for an interesting variant, if you and your friends want to play like that (call it the ""Advanced Homing Variant"", though I'd limit this to torpedoes/missles only and not anything with ""rocket"" in the name) or see perhaps some design space for future ship releases to explore   It's not a variant I'm particularly interested in, but I totally acknowledge that others might have fun with it. Keep in mind (if this changes ordnance for you): I recently discovered that I'd been playing Attack: Focus wrong. If the card doesn't state to spend the focus/lock to fire the weapon, you only have to have the token to initiate the attack. You're still able to keep it, allowing you to boost your actual secondary attack with it, or save it for defense."

That would let you get more value from your ordnance (1 point for a free second shot) without being too broken."
XWingTMG,3abj9q,EdgeOfDreams,1 point,Thu Jun 18 19:50:25 2015 UTC,"Nera Dantels is a B-Wing pilot that already has the ability to fire Torpedoes in a 360o arc. She doesn't get used very often, but that may be simply because the B-Wing isn't the best ship for carrying ordnance in general."

Adding 360-degree-tracking-missiles won't change this. I think the real problem with ordnance is the natural ""response time"" of XWING. You simply cannot fire both Primary and Secondary weapons (normally) due to the Pace/Speed of XWING. Leaving many people wishing they hadn't wasted an ATTACK PHASE and an UPGRADE CARD.   If all ships could take STRESS to get both attacks off, I think Ordnance would feel potent. But that's just me."
XWingTMG,3abj9q,X-factor103,1 point,Thu Jun 18 19:52:21 2015 UTC,"If people could stress to fire both primary and secondary off, I have the feeling the meta would be all alpha strike jousts. And I've just started playing this game ;D  But yeah, that's largely been my experience taking ordnance. As a new player, I can also add that you pay to put it on your ships, then half your ships never get a good chance to fire them for the match. Dead cards."
XWingTMG,3abj9q,leewardstyle,1 point,Thu Jun 18 19:59:04 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Right now, the only ""alpha striking"" ship is Corran Horn. XWING is just a much faster pace than Battletech. So Alpha Strike takes its default roots of ""Many ships firing at once (Swarm)."" Thematically tho, a computer/droid could offload the Ordnance to explain how one fires both weapons at these speeds. But the pilot might be stressed because he didn't want the Droid to fire yet."

I play a Dutch Vander/Nera Daniels/Roark Garnet squad for fun that shoots at the enemies.  Lock up some targets and begin shooting :)  The real problem is there is little benefit to most ordinance.  In the above squad, I have to spend 11 points for only 2 proton torpedo hits (not to mention having to spend points on named pilots)!  For another point I could get a Z-95, which IMHO makes more sense in a competitive setting.  If we could get some longer range weapons (say range 4-5) that are expendable, multiple use weapons (say 2-3 shots), or a weapon that ignores defense die, they might be worth it, but as it currently stands it's an expensive thing to buy for little additional value (other than the joy of shooting proton torpedoes vs enemy starfighers)."
XWingTMG,3abj9q,PCGamerPirate,1 point,Thu Jun 18 20:00:33 2015 UTC,The upcoming extra munitions is a torpedo upgrade that lets you get two shots for ever missile torpedo and bomb equipped for 2 points. Reducing the cost of bringing multiple shots.
XWingTMG,3abj9q,JediCheese,1 point,Thu Jun 18 20:20:08 2015 UTC,True.  The only problem is for the rebels the only ships that can utilize it is the B-Wing and Y-Wing and they only get the 2nd shot cheaper instead of increasing the armaments.  On the Imperial side you get benefits from the Tie Bomber and Firespray.  I'm hoping the E-Wing and Tie Punisher are dump trucks for expendable weapons and we get a new good weapon.

XWingTMG,3aaltq,EdgeofCosmos,1 point,Thu Jun 18 22:10:10 2015 UTC,"Acrylic templates typically come with the markings (turn, number, range lines) unpainted. They will throw the acrylic with it's paper protective covering into the laser cutter, and it will etch out the markings and cut the templates. Typically this doesn't colour the markings, just engraves it.  So our gentleman here is painting the engravings white prior to removing the masking so that it's clearly visible. Doing this before removing the paper means he'll have a damn near perfect finish because it's already masked off :)"

XWingTMG,3a8wep,antigrapist,2,Thu Jun 18 04:00:19 2015 UTC,"When a card says ""Then, receive 1 stress,"" you read that as something that happens as a distinct step, and you can interrupt it with other actions."

If Experimental Interface and Push the Limit are both equipped to a ship, they can be used together to perform two additional free actions. After the actions have resolved, the ship receives 2 stress tokens. Experimental Interface is unique. Only one copy can be included in your squad.   Meaning that they resolve at the same time, and you get to choose which happens first."

XWingTMG,3a8osu,Wolfgang52,3,Thu Jun 18 02:44:12 2015 UTC,"This looks like a pretty reasonable starting list. My advice is to run a heavy laser cannon on Brath and run predator instead of outmaneuver. You can have the points to do both of those things by turning both ties into obsidians. Mauler's ability isn't that great, so I don't think you're losing much.  Here's my suggested list ended up looking like."
XWingTMG,3a8osu,antigrapist,1 point,Thu Jun 18 04:24:20 2015 UTC,"Mauler can get an elite upgrade, that is why i have him and for three more points I can roll one extra atack die at range one."
XWingTMG,3a8osu,fl1p_problems,1 point,Thu Jun 18 17:53:05 2015 UTC,"Either Darth Vader OR Rebel Captive on the OGP.  You want to pull enemy aggro onto your Doomshuttle early, Rebel Captive will discourage enemies from shooting your shuttle. The longer you can keep the heat from your other pilots the better.  Rexler Brath should take his beloved HLC, and maybe predator? Or switch Brath for Vessery, have the Shuttle TL an enemy and enjoy a free TL+Focus+HLC attack on him.  Outmaneuver can be really great against turrets and enemies with low green dice. Vesserys skill allows you free rerolls (if used right) so outmaneuver is maybe a better choice on him than on Brath  (All in all I prefer Vessery over Brath) To bump up the synergy between Vessery and the shuttle, you coul switch the Rebel Captive for either a Weapons Engineer (more TLs!) or the Title (infinte Range TLs) granting the shuttle some usefulness even if it's not shooting.  How about this?"
XWingTMG,3a8372,Stigles,2,Wed Jun 17 23:34:51 2015 UTC,"So my friend has this list he used to torch our friendly group. I don't remember all the upgrades, but this is the base. Its only 88pts if you throw on the Chardaan Refits, so you have freedom to beef up the B-Wings.  2x Blue Squadron Pilots with Advanced Sensors  2x Green Squadron Pilots with Wingman   Keep the A-Wings close to the Bs. Stress from B-Wing K-Turns gets removed before combat and they get their action before movement."

XWingTMG,3a8372,EdgeofCosmos,1 point,Thu Jun 18 17:04:04 2015 UTC,"Here's a squad I've been experimenting with. These are my fav ships as well.  Tycho: PTL + A-wing Test Pilot (title) + Daredevil + Stealth Device + Chardaan Refit  Gemmer: A-wing Test Pilot (title) + Lone Wolf+ Stealth Device + Chardaan Refit  Keyan: PTL + Heavy Laser Cannon + Fire Control System  The object is to harrass with the A-wings while the B takes PTL target locks + either barrel rolls or focus. Against arc dodgers I'd be less inclined to fly formations and instead swoop in from multiple angles to cover the board as much as possible.  I haven't teseted it in play yet, so it's still a bit unproven. Also, I know you don't have Lone Wolf or some of the other upgrades, so substitute to your liking. Proton Rockets on the A-wings would give them a LOT more punch when they get a good shot. It's my aim to get some back on Tycho once I get Autothrusters (I need the points back that they save from being so cheap)."

Fire power, tankiness and hopefully your opponents focus the Deci so the Alpha can pick things off? Upgrade it all round two to Fel + chunky Deci?  Alternative: Echo + PTL + Enhanced Sensors + ACD 40 Alpha + Autos. 20  I just think running only two interceptors at 60 is a bit of a risk. But then again, I love Phantoms so I could be biased. If you run the linked list in OP then I'd drop the Rebel Captive on Whisper. I just never find the Phantom lives long enough if if gets shot at all."

XWingTMG,3a58g6,fl1p_problems,8,Wed Jun 17 09:26:05 2015 UTC,"I like flying YYYY, so I share your pain.  Arc dodgers work well because they usually have lots of green dice and can move quicker than you can.  Sadly Autothrusters actually hurt jousters quite a bit since arc dodgers can stay in range 3 quite safely.  However, here's what I usually do to minimize their advantage.  1. Control the center of the map  In most cases you'll have more ships or tankier ships than the arc dodger.  Bully him to the edges and corners of the map.  He has less maneuverability when he's against 1 or more walls.  2. Corner Him  Quite literally, force him into a corner.  It is the easiest area of the map to predict and limit where he can go.  It'll be your best opportunity to get arcs on him at close range.  3. Half your ships with arcs on him is better than no ships with arcs  Green dice will eventually let damage through.  The only way he is guaranteed to survive is by not getting shot at.  It's your job to make sure you can shoot at him.  Sometimes you'll need to split your forces or spread them out to do this.  When I split my forces up, I still keep them close together, just not all facing the exact same direction so I at least get a shot or two.  4. Figure out his move first  Arc dodgers often want to be in your blind spots, so when setting your dials make sure to figure out where he wants to go first.  Sometimes it'll be obvious.  Sometimes it'll be a 50-50 guess.  Sometimes you'll know where he's going and can do nothing about it.  At these times I figure out where he'll need to go after that, and aim for that location."
XWingTMG,3a58g6,Enervata,3,Wed Jun 17 14:41:48 2015 UTC,"Play the other side of the table in your head. When deciding your moves, think about his best offensive moves--his dial and actions might give him 100 possibilities, but plenty of them will be flying off without a shot or just waltzing into fire. Focus on his best moves--the ones you would make in his position--then make sure you can overlap arcs such that those moves will receive fire.  I have played against a few soontir fel and whisper lovers, and this strategy has helped immensely. These ships are still very slippery, but often the positions you can take doing this will force them to spend their actions getting out of the way and lose their offensive opportunities.  Other little things that give you a boost will help against arc dodgers.   If you outnumber your opponent, try taking some target locks. I play often with scum/rebel z-95s mixed into my lists and I can't tell you how many times the MVP of a match ends up being a generic headhunter that was ignored taking a target lock and ending up in range 1 next turn with a focus. If you keep your ships tight together, try to allow them to get a weave going when fighting starts. If you have multiple bearing being covered, they are harder to outright dodge. Ion is very harsh to these kinds of ships, especially if they are stressing themselves. If you have ion in the list, play to maximize its use and cover that ship with wingmates. If any offensive opportunity on that ship will be punished, your opponent will start sweating."
XWingTMG,3a58g6,larikia,1 point,Wed Jun 17 12:17:52 2015 UTC,"Thanks very much. I will try to keep that in mind, when placing dials. My problem is though:  I'm trying out a Cap.Jonus + 2x Defender+HLC list. Neither do I outnumber the enemy, nor do I have ion. So my best guess is to just maximize the angles and try to focus on overlapping arcs to get him down, I think."
XWingTMG,3a58g6,larikia,3,Wed Jun 17 12:37:15 2015 UTC,"A nifty trick you can pull out now and then is a weave http://i.imgur.com/7JPas5d.png. The tactic does not translate 100% perfectly into x-wing, but it is nice if you have heavy hitters that need a bit of help getting a target in sight.  It is easy to do if your ships have the same bearing, but are horizontally spaced a bit. Just bank the ships towards each other. You can get fancier with it like banking outwards one turn and then turning back inwards (to get a wider overlap), but the idea is the same. This will turn your 2 arcs into a near 180 degree arc, with a bit of overlap in the middle to punish poor decisions. You can maintain this arc with hard turns (though this will remove your overlap) or break out of it with different maneuvers depending on the results of the first round--lots of options.  Another thing I like to do with defenders is to bank and barrel roll back. This will displace your base as if it were forwards movement, but have you rotated 45 degrees. This is particularly handy if you have asteroids in the way of a bank maneuver or want to keep near the edge of the board."
XWingTMG,3a58g6,KTreu42,2,Wed Jun 17 22:38:21 2015 UTC,I tried this with my 2Def+Bomber squad and it seems to work out allright. From formation and back into formation without a sweat: http://i.imgur.com/823PEGy.png
XWingTMG,3a58g6,Jimmars,1 point,Thu Jun 18 09:32:49 2015 UTC,"Also, you can always use a low-PS ship to go for the block.  All you need to do is guess right one time, and make sure you simultaneously aim your big guns on the spot where he is going to be blocked."
XWingTMG,3a58g6,Jimmars,2,Thu Jun 18 04:27:39 2015 UTC,Spread out your ships so you have a larger arc or perform a pincer maneuver
XWingTMG,3a58g6,Shortround84,1 point,Wed Jun 17 09:29:51 2015 UTC,That's what I thought. Cover more ground. I think asteroid placement makes a big difference?
XWingTMG,3a58g6,TheSecretMe,2,Wed Jun 17 09:42:07 2015 UTC,"Asteroids will prevent your opponent from decloaking in certain directions, but it'll also make it hard for you to fly in a line.  It's a trade-off really. Your best bet would probably be setting yours up in a straight line towards your opponent or bringing debris fields"
XWingTMG,3a58g6,leewardstyle,2,Wed Jun 17 09:47:54 2015 UTC,"as far as asteroids, see if you can sort of make a clear path for you yo fly. chances are that you get to set up ships first, so set up in such a way that you have a lot of options. Also, see if you can push them into the corner of the playing field. That makes them much more predictable. and yeah, spread out, but try not to split up :).."
XWingTMG,3a58g6,X-factor103,2,Wed Jun 17 09:54:48 2015 UTC,"Try to arrange your arcs so there's no place for them to hide.   Ideally you want to predict where your target will end up and have overlapping arcs there for a hard hit, then arrange another ship to cover the blind spot in case you were wrong. Keeping one ship a little ways back from the others can help a lot with that.  Don't forget that most arc dodgers tend to be fragile. There's less need to focus fire from multiple ships to take down hard targets. Instead try to maximise your shorts of opportunity by ensuring there's no place he can hide completely.  Every time an arc dodger hides, it doesn't have to test it's luck. Make sure those fragile things push their luck every turn."
XWingTMG,3a58g6,PoeGhost,2,Wed Jun 17 10:46:22 2015 UTC,Also remember that a staggered pinwheel formation (4 ships) can be effectively larger than the largest of bases.
XWingTMG,3a58g6,X-factor103,1 point,Wed Jun 17 13:21:16 2015 UTC,So what exactly is a staggered pinwheel formation? :D
XWingTMG,3a58g6,T-Minus9,3,Wed Jun 17 13:30:06 2015 UTC,"It's a formation where instead of arranging your 4 ships in a perfect square, you offset each one a little up/down and to the side of the next ship, resulting in what looks like the petals on a pinwheel.  A quick google or youtube search for xwing pinwheel should give you tips on how to set one up. I've not tried it yet myself but I hear it's quite effective for it's arc coverage and ease of maneuvering your ships together without breaking formation."
XWingTMG,3a58g6,gnomebard,2,Wed Jun 17 13:49:16 2015 UTC,"This is ineffective against arc dodgers.  Flying in formation will overlap your arcs, so if the arc dodger can get out of one arc he will probably get out of them all."
XWingTMG,3a58g6,leewardstyle,1 point,Wed Jun 17 14:50:51 2015 UTC,"Sorry, yes I forgot to say this. It's a popular formation against larger ships where you want to concentrate your arcs and focus fire someone down.   You could maybe do this against an arc dodger if you're confident that you can predict where they'll be and line up your arcs. That much forward firepower's bound to hit something. But you ARE putting all your eggs in one basket, so to speak. If you miss, you're going to have a lot less shots (or none)."
XWingTMG,3a58g6,Waramo,2,Wed Jun 17 16:36:09 2015 UTC,"The pinwheel is effective, and simplifies maneuvering, but it casts a small net of arcs, only marginally larger than a single large base.

This week Matt and Jon bring you the first of two great games in the top 4 of the Gamezilla Fredericton Store Championships.  Jon himself is flying his XXB list on the right against Andrew who has managed to fly his way into the Top 4 without appearing on camera once!  Talk about the Dark Horse!
XWingTMG,3a5iqf,Holmelunden,2,Wed Jun 17 11:45:09 2015 UTC,A couple of petpeeves   Dice as shield markers should really not be allowed. The XXB player really need to hold on to his Ship/Templates. Far to much unintentional moving of his ships happens becasue of it.  Put the damn miniature back on the base. Having the YT 1300 flying around as a base is ugly to look at.

XWingTMG,3a5iqf,gungywamp,1 point,Wed Jun 17 16:48:59 2015 UTC,I'd say because it would be easy to accidentally grab those dice to roll with.

XWingTMG,3a60pg,Glubger,2,Wed Jun 17 14:35:01 2015 UTC,You would get more mileage out of a Stealth Device over a Hull Upgrade.
XWingTMG,3a60pg,Cintesis,2,Wed Jun 17 14:50:44 2015 UTC,"Not necessarily true, one bad defensive roll and you lose the upgrade. Hull upgrade guarantees that if 1 crit gets through the shields you can't be killed. I can not tell you how many times one crit gets through and it has been a direct hit."

Imperial Aces Rebel Aces B-Wing Expansion Tie-Interceptor Expansion   With these sets and what you are already purchasing you will have a large majority of the better upgrade cards covered. Also you will be able to make a wide variety of lists as well. Shouldn't see the same thing overly often."

XWingTMG,3a6nai,mxzf,2,Wed Jun 17 17:43:47 2015 UTC,"Both aces packs include a lot of good pilots and upgrades to work with.  A second core set lets you have plenty of dice, enough TIEs to make a mini swarm, and spare damage deck+templates.    If you want to run Scum too, grab the Most Wanted pack and perhaps a lone Y-Wing (usable in both Scum and Rebels at that point) and you should have enough to work with.  In general, I would suggest playing a few games and looking into what looks fun.  For casual games, almost everything is darn well balanced (as long as you don't have an ""I'm going to take this OP combo every single game"" player) and lots of fun to play with.  I would also suggest buying from CSI or Miniatures Market if you're planning on doing a bulk buy and then using those ships longer term.  They sell ships at 66% MSRP with free shipping for orders over $100, and $100 is enough to get a nice number of ships on there.  As for storage, many people use fishing tackle boxes or tool boxes to carry ships around.  The Plano 3700 series tackle boxes especially are pretty ideal for storing ships.  I personally have a Plano 732 box (which holds 3x 3750s inside it) and I have everything I use for the game, including 16 ships, in just two of the smaller containers that it comes with."

So you can take the bases apart and store them in a pile, rather than leaving them attached to the ships.    The pockets in a 3700 container are ~1.5"" wide and deep with slots for dividers every ~0.75"", perfect for fitting most X-Wing ships in.  The only ships I have which I haven't been able to put in the normal pockets are the YT-2400 and the HWK, both of which sit together in the double-wide row without any issue."

I'd hold off on those for the moment, personally.  Slave I is very easy to put into the Scum faction, though you will have to buy the Most Wanted expansion. Technically, at that point, you should be able to squeeze out a 100 point squad from the two Z-95s, the one Y-Wing, and the Slave I you already have. If you like bombs, Emon's great. Boba and Kath both have nice Scum abilities.  You can grab a crafting case from Michael's or Hobby Lobby for like 10 bucks. It's done my collection well. Others may recommend going whole hog for the Plano storage kits.  For fun pickup games, which is all I play, really, grab the ships that look cool! I love TIE Interceptors, the Phantom can be a fun nuisance, E-Wings and A-Wings are solid, and I've gotten a lot of mileage out of my B-Wing. May recommend grabbing Imperial and Rebel Aces, as they have some fun cards and pilots. They also make the base Interceptor, A-Wing, and B-Wing expansions shine.  Want a support ship with a mini-turret? Grab a HWK. Want just the Mini-turret? Pick up some Y-Wings. Want to have a massive fleet? Grab a lot of cheap ships (basic TIEs and Z-95s) and swarm 'em! There's not a whole lot of wrong ways to go, and Scum brings its own fun dynamic to the fold.  As a casual player myself, just be sure you're balancing your factions. You may want to grab a Decimator so your Imperials have a Turret like your Rebels already do. When I buy a ship, I try to buy another of a different faction, or try to balance my next purchase against it (again, different faction).  Have fun, make mistakes, it's a great game!"

A story-less dogfight, while fun for star wars fans, wouldn't be as appealing to the whole group. This is a prime example of ""we here what we want to hear""... Most are saying to avoid the transport. But off this one post I might get it anyway. So I have to ask... does this idea of fun story driven mission work with the beautiful Tantive IV / Corellian CR90 as well. I didn't realize this had already come out untill a few minutes ago. Thought this was coming at a later date. A Corellian CR90/Rebel Transport with single X-Wing and/or A-Wing escort fleeing/blockade running from a full squad of Tie Advanced and Slave 1 is an obscenely appealing scenario."
XWingTMG,3a6nai,EdgeOfDreams,2,Wed Jun 17 19:30:10 2015 UTC,"Starting off I would say the transport is the way to go.  In squad points its going to be between mid 30s to mid 40s.  That leaves you around 60 points for a couple of escorts to match up against a swarm coming after you!  The CR90 on the other hand will typically be 115 to 130 points itself, so you are looking at 200 point games before it starts being fun to have on the table.  It also comes with a full set of mission for it as well, so if you like the transport then looking at that later is a good idea.  A note on side missions, all of the large ship expansions come with at least one I think, as well as maybe the aces packs?"

Actually, all of the larger sets (large ships, Aces, core, and epic) all tend to come with their own missions and tokens to run the missions, not just the GR-75.  And you might be thinking of the Imperial Raider, that's the third epic ship which isn't out quite yet."
XWingTMG,3a6nai,starslinger72,2,Wed Jun 17 20:17:14 2015 UTC,"X-wing is an easier game to pickup than Armada.  Armada is a bit more heavy on the strategy, and the games are longer.  Definitely get a 2nd core set.  You'll want two sets of templates / damage cards and a full set dice if you're hosting the games.  It's going to be really hard for you not to purchase more ships by the way.  It's just too tempting to want to try every possible build."
XWingTMG,3a6nai,mxzf,1 point,Wed Jun 17 19:10:25 2015 UTC,"Rebel Transport is only for Epic games, so its not really suitable for casual play. Lambda Shuttle is a good ship, but hard for new players to fly because it is unusually slow and hard to maneuver compared to other ships. If you buy the Most Wanted expansion pack, you get pilot cards that let you convert Slave 1, the HWK-290, Y-Wings, and Z-95 Headhunters to the Scum and Villainy faction. If you already have some of those ships, then just the one pack lets you jump right in to the third faction. It also comes with a Y-Wing and two Z-95s of its own. A second core set would be extremely useful to have more dice, templates, etc. It's also relatively cheap for the number of additional ships it gets you. Playmats are extremely useful, especially so you don't have to measure how far 3 ft x 3 ft is every time you set up to play. If you don't want to spend money on the official mats, just go to a fabric store, pick out a color you like of thick felt, and ask for one or two 3 ft x 3ft pieces to be cut for you. That should cost less than $10 to get two mats that way."

That info on the Most wanted pack is exactly what I need to know. I'm assuming it will allow the game to be played with 3 factions at once giving more options on how to divide up the teams/players? Good to know about ""just buy a second core set"" for more dice, sticks, tiles, ships. Ok so the play mat isn't just about ambiance and preventing scratches on your table. There's a rule/size component. I didn't even think about that with non-hex gameplay."
XWingTMG,3a6nai,Kaerlis,2,Wed Jun 17 17:43:10 2015 UTC,"shuttle   All other advice aside, buy what you want to fly.   Most Wanted   Yes, it will let you play with three factions. The core rules talk a lot about Rebel versus Imperial, but the tournament rules actually allow mirror matches (Rebel v Rebel, Imperial v Imperial, Scum v Scum), and such matches are still generally considered balanced. The games rules and balance are all designed around 1v1 matches, but you can do three-way matches if you feel like it. If you search around online, you'll find some suggested rules for doing so. Also, many of the larger game boxes come with rules for a Scenario you can play that has different rules from the standard match, and I believe at least some of the Scenarios included with Scum ships are three-way matches.   play mat   Yes, the official rule is that the game takes place in a 3 foot x 3 foot square area. There are rules about starting positions relative to the edges of the play area, and if you fly off the edge during the game that ship is considered to have ""fled the engagement"", which is effectively the same as being destroyed. You can technically play on a smaller or larger area, which can be useful depending on how many players and ships you're playing with at once, but the rules and balance all assume you're using the standard 3x3 size."
XWingTMG,3a6fpd,jonny117,2,Wed Jun 17 16:25:52 2015 UTC,"For casual games, a printed out copy will be fine.  For tournaments you need the actual cards.  But at the same time, each of those pilots can only legally be fielded one at a time anyways, and it sounds like he has at least one of each unique pilot already and is just missing the duplicates.  Unless you're sharing the collection with other people and both of you want to fly the same named pilot at the same time, it won't be an issue."

XWingTMG,3a4z17,mikodz,2,Wed Jun 17 07:36:31 2015 UTC,"There actually were a few larger ships in the hands of scum.  In Hutt Gambit, Drea Renthal's flagship, Renthal's Fist, is a CR90 upgraded with capital-class torpedo launchers.  During the Battle of Nar Shaddaa she captures a Carrak-class light cruiser (350m long) that later became her next flagship.  Another well known S&V-captained large ship is the Errant Venture, an Imperial II Star Destroyer owned by Booster Terrik after capturing it during the Bacta War.  But not even Imperials in X-Wing Minis have a ship that big.    I'm pretty sure there were at least one or two dreadnaughts in private hands too, not to mention a number of other corvette-sized ships in the hands of pirates and the like."
XWingTMG,3a4z17,mxzf,3,Wed Jun 17 13:42:23 2015 UTC,"There's also Talon Karrde's ship, The Wild Karrde. About halfway between the GR75 and CR90 in size, lots of lore to draw on for upgrades. Plus it just looks like a Scum epic ship."
XWingTMG,3a4z17,darth_static,2,Wed Jun 17 13:48:33 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's true, the Action VI was pretty big.  IIRC it wasn't really a warship so much as a refitted cargo ship, similar to the GR-75.  I could see them using it, but it probably wouldn't have the combat capabilities of the CR-90 or Raider."
XWingTMG,3a4z17,mxzf,2,Wed Jun 17 13:49:54 2015 UTC,"Night Caller and Constrictor from X-Wing: Wraith Squadron were a CR90 (depending on how loosely you define the scum faction).

XWingTMG,3a4z17,TheSecretMe,2,Thu Jun 18 09:37:08 2015 UTC,"That is a similar argument I grant you XD However, Vader and Han are more iconic - I'm not implying that these other ships and characters aren't iconic, but they have less of a role in the films. I appreciate Darth dies so features less in the extended universe etc etc but as far as widest audience marketablity FFG will use Han, Darth, Luke etc as well known faces. Obviously some of the other named pilots are less well known or didn't feature in the films - I appreciate that - but their ships are identifiable to people who don't know the characters.   I do appreciate FFG invented the Raider Corvette for the game. I'm not saying it won't happen, just that it's less likely. My previous comment (the one you replied to) is poorly worded on that front. FFG could realise a S&V epic ship - it's their game after all - my point is simply it's less likely that they will considering how they're pitching the role of S&V in the game thus far.   Additionally, I feel that Epic play will be limited as a whole - that there are unlikely to be many new Epic ships released across all factions - as X-Wing is a dog-fight game rather than a fleet game (Like, for example, Armada - which I appreciate has no S&V as yet and none promised for the future, although their could be). So  the appearance of an S&V Epic ship is limited by that - in my opinion, which is not law or truth or fact, merely what I express here - as well as the fact that there is no frigate class ship that is well known across the majority of the player base - again, obviously, their are known vessels as cited above and below my posts, but they are lesser known than the pilots cited here and generally used. The lesser known pilots pilot well known ships, which goes some way to explaining their presence in the game.   Say in Episode 7, 8, 9 there's a particular firgate class ship that is owned by a pirate/smuggler/gang lord that features heavily. That would increase the likelihood of an Epic ship for S&V - expecially if it featured in an iconic moment of the new trilogy. Perhaps Raider Corvettes will feature, courtesy of Disney/FFG agreement about the ship in game.   I mean, I don't really know what'll happen in the future. The post asked for opinions. Sorry you felt mine was poorly expressed. Hopefully this unfortunate, and slightly rushed, minor essay might help explain my view point more. You don't have to agree with it, and that's fine. I am not the way, the truth and the light; but I am allowed to express an opinion, and others are allowed to disagree. Plenty of people have, I've learned some stuff about the Extend U and S&V potential characters, but FFG are making the game for profit - fanservice will serve that end rather than supercede it.   Although obviously FFG could prove me wrong, and I would still pay them money for an S&V Epic if they did ^"
XWingTMG,3a4z17,Nomnomnicon,1 point,Thu Jun 18 10:48:04 2015 UTC,"The various scum and villainy type characters have never featured that heavily in the movies since they focussed on the republic and empire. If you want to go by the movies, you'll never see a scum epic sized ship.  In the EU though there's any number of smuggling rings, mercenary charters and crime syndicates that had one or more capital sized ships available. Not to mention that more than once some rogue or another temporarily managed to lay hands on a large ship.  I don't think the likes of Jabba's Star Jewel or Karrde's Wilde Karrde are especially out of place in the current game considering what else is in there. It's not like IG88's or Bossk's ships ever had a mention in the movie."

XWingTMG,3a5z0a,kertofer,3,Wed Jun 17 14:21:18 2015 UTC,"Yep. An upgrade is an upgrade, and it doesn't matter what set it came in, as long as you have the upgrade slot type, your ship can use the upgrade.  A few exceptions to this rule exist, but will state so explicitly on their cards. For example, so far, titles upgrades are specific to a to a certain model of ship. The Moldy Crow upgrade that comes with the HWK can only be used on the HWK. However, both Scum and Villiany and Rebel HWKs can use it (the restriction applies to the ship's model, not it's faction).   Finally, I'll point this out because i've seen a few new players confused about this... some rebel ships have an astromech upgrade. Some scum ships have a salvaged astromech upgrade slot. The upgrade icons look a bit similar, but are not the same. You cannot put a salvaged mech in a rebel ship, or a regular astromech in a scum ship unless they have the associated upgrade slot (no ship like this exists yet)."

XWingTMG,3a323r,the-rat-life,3,Tue Jun 16 21:32:42 2015 UTC,"I'm primarily an Imperial Firespray player, to be honest, and to this day I remain a fan of the bounty hunter + recon specialist (with optional anti-pursuit lasers, countermeasures, and/or seismic charge).  It's tough, has decent enough firepower, and has low enough PS to block a lot of ships, all the while enjoying its double focus.  It's also cheap enough to have 60ish points left over to build the rest of your list."
XWingTMG,3a323r,BrandCAG,2,Tue Jun 16 21:41:00 2015 UTC,I like this. It's tough but cheap and has an obvious purpose in a list.  My big mistake in list building is to get tempted by all the neat pilots and upgrades and end up with a 100pt list that has 10 hit points.

XWingTMG,3a323r,Nomnomnicon,2,Wed Jun 17 08:56:11 2015 UTC,"For me, it depends on the pilot and its corresponding crew. You're right; engine definitely pairs well with the rear arc but I've often not bothered.  In the case of bounty hunters with recon specialist, to keep points low, I never equip engine. Obviously, to boost would take away from the benefits of recon specialist as well. For the named pilots or builds with different crew members, the likelihood that I add engine goes up (i.e. my Fett builds always have engine, for example whereas only some of my Kath builds do).  Still, I like the idea of running a bounty hunter as a cheap tank and 4pts is 4pts, after all."

Soontir gets the usual treatment: Push the Limit, Royal Guard TIE title, Targeting Computer, and either a two-point initiative bid or Autothrusters. I go with Autothrusters. Won last winter's season with the initiative bid.   What makes the Bounty Hunters good is that they have good health, a solid dial (having two K-turns on a large base ship is no joke), and move at 3, which is just high enough to avoid the worst of Predator shenanigans. Plus the Firespray's auxiliary arc is super useful."

I find everyone targets the F-31 first because it only has 2 agility, but thats not the case if it means somebody has to take a stress, often target priority goes elswhere.  Best option is to keep it cheap, BH + VI + Rebel Captive, maybe a cannon of your choice (I like to use flechette cannon, its only 2 points and can really screw up an opponents strategy).

And the competitive crowd are the ones that drive the article and forum side of the hobby, since they're always analysing ships and upgrades down to the finest detail to squeeze the last bit of efficiency out of them, or they're complaining about MoV or fat turrets or something. The concept of playing casual games for fun, without adhering to the tournament format of 100 point, 6 rock deathmatches, seems to baffle a lot of them.  And casual players don't really need the forums and the podcasts and the articles. They just get out there with their little plastic space ships and have a blast.

XWingTMG,3a2gok,starslinger72,3,Wed Jun 17 17:04:47 2015 UTC,"TC had an epic play tournament that kind of fizzled as the TO go busy with real life.  There is less articles and guides if you will as it sees massively lower play compared to 100 point dogfight.  Same thing for vids/bat reps.  a 300 point epic match can take over 3 hours in person, and 5+ on vassal.  Its hard to keep up casting or an overview for that kind of time.  That being said I have a number of 300 point epic games under my belt on both vassal and in person.  Ships that rarely see play in 100 points become amazing in 300 point games.  For the empire side:  Kagi, Jax, Rexlar and Jonus all become really really strong.  Kagi and Jax have so many more targets that they can affect with their pilot abilities their value just goes up.   In one game I had Jax block something like 8 Focus from being used in the same turn!  Kagi as well can force a lot more hate onto him, and with the right defensive build can actually survive for a while even in a shuttle.  Secondary weapons become much better at 300 points, and bomber wings with Jonus running support are very solid.  Getting 5 assault missiles into a cluster in the same turn is just silly.  Lastly Huge ships hate dealing with Crits.  They are way worse than crits in the standard damage deck.  As such people that deal more crits hit even harder, such as Rexlar.  (personal favorite play is to put decoy on him to decoy down in pilot skill with a delta, have the delta strip the shields and then Rexlar unload with an HLC and use focus to flip all those hits to crits.)  Some things that dont typically do as well.  Things that are hard to kill in 100 points, Fat Han or super dodgy interceptors and A wings, die super fast in 300 points.  There are way more ships on the other side putting out way more damage.  Suddenly 3P0 + MF title isnt cutting it anymore when you could be looking at 9 Daggers with HLC's on the other side of the board.    My typical empire list was something like the following  3 shuttles - generally Yorr, OGP, and Kagi forming an anchor to my lines.  These will be driving head first at the enemy front.    Tie swarm of 6 ish tie fighters - Howlrunning and academy pilots.  Keep them cheap, they are going in along side the shuttles to provide fire support.     Flankers - generally Jax with a couple of Royal guards on one side and whisper on the other."

XWingTMG,3a2gok,starslinger72,3,Wed Jun 17 17:03:03 2015 UTC,"A friend and I have been getting really psyched up for epic since we found out about the Raider. It basically looks like the Commander of X-Wing (for those of you who play Magic).  The reasons we don't see a lot of talk about strategy are that it's not nearly as popular as dogfight and that the larger army is much more forgiving on points. With that many ships flying around, there are a lot more options to shoot at, so picking out the most optimal target will be a lot less obvious than in a dogfight.  That being said, we should definitely have some more discussion! One of my favorite things to do lately is looking up custom stuff to do with epic (since it's all casual, anyway...). I've printed off star destroyers designed for Imperials and Rebels and conversions that let you use the GR-75 in a scum squad. I can't wait to try this stuff out, but we're giving a little more time for the Raider before we dive in."

XWingTMG,3a2gok,RDT2,1 point,Wed Jun 17 03:43:40 2015 UTC,"Epic is a weird duck. Part of the problem is that list building for epic is much more dependant on your collection. 9x Dagger Squadron B-wings with HLC is a great 300 point squad, but few people have that many B-wings (and HLCs, although those are becoming more common). The time factor is another problem that I have with the format.   I will say that 58 point Dash (PtL, engine and kyle) is a really strong option for a rebel finisher. He's fast enough to not get caught out of position or focused down, great at long ranges and the things that threaten him aren't as strong in 300 point games."

XWingTMG,3a1k7u,starslinger72,2,Tue Jun 16 20:15:01 2015 UTC,"It allows for more flexibility.  Now you can double stress large based ships in a single turn, and with the title for the Y-wing you still have the same amount of stress delivery as panic attack did."
XWingTMG,3a1k7u,antigrapist,1 point,Tue Jun 16 20:45:02 2015 UTC,"My thought process is that with the BTL-A4 title for the Ywing, I can now deal a ton of stress to anything in arc at R1-2. This leaves the 3rd tactician as overkill, so I wanted to find a stronger alternative. I went with an ion cannon because it's strong at R3, which is normally a weak point for this build, it synergizes with the ICT on the Y  and because it helps slow down big ships with engine enough to give them 2+ stress.  There aren't a lot of good 25 point alternatives to an ion cannon.  Paul Heaver was running Biggs instead, but I'd rather let my opponent make mistakes and shoot the Y wing in many matchups. You could run Tarn +R7, but he's not really helping you win the game faster, with the exception of his superior 4k turn.   In wave 7, I plan to swap to a Twin Linked Turret on the Y-wing (R2-3, 3 attack, make 2 attacks, if an attack hits it only does 1 damage, 6 points) and move to FCS on a blue to pay for the extra point of turret. Without the title, I can still apply 2 stress to ships in arc, but now my Y can still do something while slowly turning around.  TLDR: Yes, Ion Cannon > 3rd tactician"
XWingTMG,3a1k7u,1_73,2,Tue Jun 16 20:55:14 2015 UTC,Thanks for your elaborate thought process. Makes a lot of sense and I'm looking forward to the Twin Linked Turret :).
XWingTMG,3a1k7u,starslinger72,2,Wed Jun 17 06:10:13 2015 UTC,"I went up against a similar list a few weeks ago, that had just one tact and FCS on all the blues.  Really increases the damage output of the list while leaving most of the stress duties to the warthog."
XWingTMG,3a1k7u,1_73,1 point,Thu Jun 18 17:07:50 2015 UTC,"R2A3 doesn't work outside of your firing arc, so you would still need the ship to be in arc, even with a turret, btw... Right? Or am I missing something?"
XWingTMG,3a1k7u,blairbunke,2,Wed Jun 17 13:19:37 2015 UTC,"By having the twin linked turret but not locking it down, the Y wing can still double stress (but at range 2-3 rather than range 1-2) but ALSO has the ability to do damage while being faced the wrong way (as a multi stressed Y-wing will be)"
XWingTMG,3a1k7u,Chilligan,2,Wed Jun 17 14:43:16 2015 UTC,Looks like this is a win/win for Grapist he if wins he's the two time reigning RC champ if he loses his bracket will be the best.

XWingTMG,3a2cfd,sacimino40,5,Tue Jun 16 18:03:57 2015 UTC,"From the way it reads, the stress token only gets assigned if you do not have one.  If you do happen to have one already, I guess the Bossk ability is free.  I am not sure that is what is intended, but that is how I read it.  Thoughts?"
XWingTMG,3a2cfd,ilikexwing,4,Tue Jun 16 18:18:52 2015 UTC,"Based on the phrasing of Bossk's crew card I would disagree. It says ""if you are not stressed... then assign one focus token...""  To me, that reads like a classic if/then conditional, so if you fail to do the first part you cannot do the second."
XWingTMG,3a2cfd,xaoshaen,2,Tue Jun 16 21:21:46 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure it is this way as well. FFG, for some reason, always omits a critical ""if you do"" statement when doing these types of abilities. Take the wordings of R7-T1 and Accuracy Corrector for example. Both abilities are worded exactly the same, but you're allowed to choose not do the first half of R7-T1 (choose to not grab target lock) and still get the 2nd half (get the boost). Accuracy Corrector, obviously, doesn't allow you to choose not to cancel your hit results and then still just add 2 hits, but the wording SHOULD allow you to if it were to follow the ruling on R7-T1.   So in the case of Bossk, because they choose again to not include a simple ""if you do"" phrase, it's up to determining intent of the card rather than pure wording. The wording implies ""yes! If you start stressed you get two extra actions and no additional stress."" It's my belief that the intent is that the focus and target lock are contingent on whether or not you started unstressed."
XWingTMG,3a2cfd,BorisIHateReddit,1 point,Tue Jun 16 21:56:12 2015 UTC,"I like this explanation, for sure.  And, in truth, I kind of think that is what they should have meant.

XWingTMG,3a2cfd,ilikexwing,1 point,Tue Jun 16 22:22:08 2015 UTC,It really bugs me. Three magic words could wash away any ambiguity.
XWingTMG,3a2cfd,BorisIHateReddit,1 point,Tue Jun 16 22:24:19 2015 UTC,"There is a period.  It is not clear whether the second statement is regulated by the if.  x = 4 if(x==4)     x = 1 x += 1   The x += 1 will happen no matter what happened to the conditional.  The way the wrote it, it feels like that to me."
XWingTMG,3a2cfd,ilikexwing,1 point,Tue Jun 16 21:52:25 2015 UTC,"Heh, depends on the language...  To me the use of if/then links the two statements. Even stepping aside from the logical usage, then implies a temporal sequence. Of course, we're parsing pretty finely at that point and I may well be inferring more import to the phrasing than FFG intended."
XWingTMG,3a2cfd,xaoshaen,1 point,Tue Jun 16 21:57:06 2015 UTC,"To me, it reads differently. I am interpreting it as ""if you are not stressed, then get stressed"".  Then, regardless of whether our if was true or false and any action was needed or not, do the thing.  I was surprised by this, because they have plenty of things that add stress and none of the them in the entire game are worded like that.  But that is how I am seeing it.  The conditional seems to me to apply to the adding the stress part of the mechanic.  The other part appears to me to take place regardless."
XWingTMG,3a2cfd,ilikexwing,1 point,Tue Jun 16 22:18:20 2015 UTC,"To me, the only reason to have the you ""msut"" add a stress token if not stressed is if the second half relies on it.  Otherwise, it could have just said ""When you miss with an attack, gain a focus token and a target lock on the defender.  Then if you aren't stressed, receive 1 stress"""
XWingTMG,3a2cfd,VanderLegion,1 point,Tue Jun 16 22:24:50 2015 UTC,"""After you perform an attack that doesn't hit, if you are not stressed, you must receive 1 stress token. Then assign 1 focus token to your ship and acquire a target lock on the defender.""  If the second part was contingent on the first part resolving false and needing to add a token, why did they not write it as ""If not stressed, add a stress token and do the thing.""  So, I am assuming (bad me), that they meant to have the second part not be logically conditional on the first, but the ""then"" being a temporal descriptor. ""Check if you are stressed, if not, get a stress, do it!!!! After you checked, regardless of whether you had to get a stress or not, do the thing""."
XWingTMG,3a2cfd,ilikexwing,1 point,Tue Jun 16 22:28:06 2015 UTC,"Back to code, C this time (or java).  The way I interpret it     if(isStressed == false)         isStressed = true;     doTheThing();  The way you are interpreting it (I think)     if(isStressed == false)     {         isStressed = true;         doTheThing();     }  EDIT: Formatting is not working :("
XWingTMG,3a2cfd,ilikexwing,1 point,Tue Jun 16 22:37:09 2015 UTC,"Look at Accuracy corrector.  Same situation.  Cancel all dice results,  then a period.  THEN add 2 hit results.  The second effect relies on the first.  I would argue the same here."
XWingTMG,3a2cfd,VanderLegion,2,Tue Jun 16 22:23:13 2015 UTC,But Accuracy Corrector is already screwed up because R7-T1 has the same wording but the opposite ruling. It allows for the player to not do part A and still get part B.  To really find out what we should be doing with the card we have to wait for FFG to clarify.
XWingTMG,3a2cfd,BorisIHateReddit,2,Tue Jun 16 23:29:55 2015 UTC,Wiser words have not been spoken! :)  We are going to have to wait for an official clarification.
XWingTMG,3a2cfd,ilikexwing,1 point,Wed Jun 17 00:33:05 2015 UTC,"I think that is a bad example, because in that case they are not conditionals, they are sequential instructions.  Which can be said is what is happening in Bossk's.  ""Check something, do something on false.  Then do something else"".  Don't get me wrong.  I could totally be reading this incorrectly.  But I am not sure :P"
XWingTMG,3a2cfd,ilikexwing,1 point,Tue Jun 16 22:42:21 2015 UTC,What makes accuracy corrector sequentiel but not bossks?
XWingTMG,3a2cfd,VanderLegion,1 point,Tue Jun 16 22:58:40 2015 UTC,"They are both sequential. The question is sequential on what.  First sequence: Check to see if you have stress.  If you do not, add one.  Second sequence: Get a focus and a TL on the defender.  I see the period as making the second action be unrelated to how the first one resolved.  It simply waits until it resolves, it is not contingent on how.  That is how I am reading it.  The way others are reading it is that it DOES matter how action one resolved.  But on the accuracy corrector, action 1 is not contingent on anything, it will always resolve."

To me, the wording means that you can't have someone wingman the stress off you immediately (phase isn't right for it anyway) or Captain Yorr (wrong faction).  You can't take those two actions unless you have a stress token on your ship, same way as Soontir Fel doesn't get his focus token if someone else takes his stress for him."

In all seriousness though I see it being about as strong as it currently is, but there are more enemy ships on the field so it becomes harder to arc dodge. Also as things have kinda settled with wave six, I think only IG A would be a good add-on and only because there are more ships in play.

The 1300 has the advantage in ascetics and canonical awareness. Nothing pulls people who dont play to a table faster than ""Is that the millennium falcon?"" Both have wonderful crew and pilots. The 2400 does come with the debris field, which is another plus for it imo."
XWingTMG,3a12bf,Late_for_something,3,Tue Jun 16 12:03:09 2015 UTC,"Falcon has more hitpoints and can be upgraded more. YT-2400 is more maneuverable and can buy an upgrade to use a secondary weapon in it's turret, which has huge damage potential.   Both are really nice."
XWingTMG,3a12bf,doodeman,1 point,Tue Jun 16 12:31:08 2015 UTC,"This.  Given the current state of affairs with autothrusters, it's really, really hard for the falcon to even land a hit against the arc dodgers.  The barrel roll of the 2400 gains added significance in the current meta.  I just played double falcons to a top 8 finish at the Raleigh Regionals - and what did me in was a complete inability to land that last hit on an IG88."
XWingTMG,3a12bf,Barzhac,2,Tue Jun 16 12:38:18 2015 UTC,Why does a Falcon find it hard to land hits? Isn't it's primary 360 degrees?
XWingTMG,3a12bf,Inquisitorsz,1 point,Wed Jun 17 01:53:02 2015 UTC,"With all the 3 agility, autothruster ships out there, it has gotten pretty hard .  Anything with AT that is out of arc, or at range 3, is pretty much unhittable.  If you catch it with no action, while you DO have a focus or TL, you have a halfway decent chance of getting in a hit.  Interceptors are ridiculously hard to hit.  IG88 a little easier to hit, but much beefier.  Aren't too many a-wings or starvipers being used competitively at the moment.  Clearly y-wings, b-wings, and decimators do not fall into this category."
XWingTMG,3a12bf,Barzhac,2,Wed Jun 17 03:40:00 2015 UTC,"YT-2400...not as tanky, but it's just as maneuverable as an E-Wing so it doesn't get hit."
XWingTMG,3a12bf,Washout81,2,Tue Jun 16 12:52:39 2015 UTC,"YT-2400. It's great straight out of the box with some great options, whereas the falcon heavily needs c3po/r2d2 from the corvette to reach its potential.  I prefer the 2 agility 10 health vs the 1 agility 13 health falcon, especially when taking recon specialist whose focus tokens use that agility.  I also prefer the brute power of a 4 attack heavy laser cannon despite either needing arc or losing range 1 with the title, vs the 3 attack no downsides falcon primary.   The advantages the falcon does have are 2 crew slots rather than one, and being able to go high initative and offensive with Han. Both ships can go tanky/crit resistant (leebo/chewy).   Lastly, the Yt2400 has barrel roll built in. It's not quite as useful as engine, but its still very substantial on a big ship and consider the point cost tht engine usually brings."

Until the Hound's Tooth drops there is no other way to get them and they are useful on so many different ships. Lone Wolf on the 2400 is good but EU is a bigger deal IMO.

A kitted out Dash in a 2400 will let you move over asteroids, barrel roll, boost and go anywhere you want with an amazing dial.  The downside is that you really want an engine upgrade which comes with... the falcon."

XWingTMG,3a12bf,Inquisitorsz,1 point,Wed Jun 17 01:59:12 2015 UTC,A lightly equipped Han Solo is an option. Put Solo between Dash and his target to plug up the hole where Dash can't fire.

Pilot Leebo + Determination = decent chance to ignore crits comes with a Heavy Laser Cannon. These are great fun to toss on other ships, including small guys like the B wing. notable upgrades: HLC, Lone Wolf! (again, very fun to put on smaller ships), and to a lesser extent Experimental Interface"

XWingTMG,3a12bf,1BrotonTorpedo,1 point,Tue Jun 16 15:52:03 2015 UTC,"Personally I like the YT-2400 more, it's got more utility/maneuverability/unpredictability. With the falcon, your opponent knows what they're dealing with straight up."
XWingTMG,3a12bf,KTreu42,1 point,Tue Jun 16 18:29:12 2015 UTC,Though Navigator + EU + VI is always fun for the falcon if you want to play arc dodgers.

XWingTMG,3a12bf,Lion_Paw_808,1 point,Wed Jun 17 01:56:06 2015 UTC,"They are both great ships, but the YT-2400 in the most powerful configurations offers a little more versatility and thought to be put into your flying.  It's very easy to just autopilot a Falcon, mindlessly chuck gunner shots as you float along, and win.  So while both are extremely strong, to me the YT-2400 is a much more enjoyable ship to fly"
XWingTMG,39ypk5,Azazel_The_Fox,12,Mon Jun 15 21:38:32 2015 UTC,I for one am not looking forward to 3x Trandoshan Slavers with 2 tacticians each...

XWingTMG,39ypk5,rsixidor,3,Mon Jun 15 23:07:34 2015 UTC,I'm thinking about engine upgrade since there's no kturn. Turn 3 and boost inside and you almost have the position that was behind you in arc.
XWingTMG,39ypk5,3rd_Charmer,3,Mon Jun 15 23:33:13 2015 UTC,"Don't forget that there is still an unspoiled upgrade (modification, I think) in this expansion: Manuvering Flaps (or something like that)!  Might end up being even more favorable than an expensive Engine Upgrade."

XWingTMG,39ypk5,Cupajo72,7,Mon Jun 15 23:17:07 2015 UTC,Now all we need is a Punishing One and a Mist Hunter.
XWingTMG,39ypk5,TyrantNZ,4,Tue Jun 16 02:10:36 2015 UTC,No answer on how Natasha Pub interacts with MoV. Darn. Still a nice bit of information
XWingTMG,39ypk5,VanderLegion,7,Mon Jun 15 23:07:18 2015 UTC,It does state:   a unique Z-95 Headhunter that doesn't cost any squad points   My guess based on that would be that there's decent odds it won't count for MoV
XWingTMG,39ypk5,stmack,5,Mon Jun 15 23:21:55 2015 UTC,"yup, definitely would be this given the ""-"" point cost instead of a ""*"" like they use for PS."
XWingTMG,39ypk5,TyrantNZ,5,Mon Jun 15 23:27:06 2015 UTC,But what if they blow up the Hounds Tooth and the Pup is still alive?   Or what if during same-skill shooting both the Hounds Tooth and enemy ship blow up?   Will it be a full point win but 100 MOV each?   Honestly it likely won't come up often but darn if I'm not curious
XWingTMG,39ypk5,Sallyjack,6,Mon Jun 15 23:33:50 2015 UTC,"Here is my take:  I assume the ability resolves in initiative order.  Then, game-state check of ""Have you destroyed all your opponent ships"" is answered in the negative, ergo, you have not defeated your opponent yet and you have no more ships.  You will still have a ship on the board, it will just be worth 'null' points (technically not ""0"", but ""-"", which I'm taking to mean 'null')  You will get the win, and your opponent gets exactly the amount of points he/she destroyed, since to get exactly 100, you need to destroy all ships, including ships with a null value.  Whomever destroyed the most points gets the win.  You don't get any points for destroying the Pup with a null value (you did, of course, destroy the Tooth and you get those points)"
XWingTMG,39ypk5,mxzf,6,Tue Jun 16 00:23:02 2015 UTC,"This.  The default victory condition is last-ship-standing.  MoV is used to determine the winner if a game goes to time, it isn't the innate victory condition."
XWingTMG,39ypk5,Sallyjack,2,Tue Jun 16 00:34:08 2015 UTC,"My guess as to why it's ""-"" and not ""0"" is so that it cannot be made part of an official 100 point starting squad.  Since the Z95 will have a template for each corresponding pilot, I have no doubt that people would try to put it in a squad on it's own and use the Tooth card as it's pilot card."
XWingTMG,39ypk5,Athole,2,Tue Jun 16 00:42:09 2015 UTC,a unique Z-95 Headhunter that doesn't cost any squad points and can't deploy until the Hound's Tooth is destroyed.     They already covered that there.
XWingTMG,39ypk5,MythicalMothman,2,Tue Jun 16 15:47:22 2015 UTC,Makes sense! If your Pup is the last ship on the board then you get a full win with MOV equaling 100 + your initiative bid.
XWingTMG,39ypk5,i_shit_my_spacepants,4,Tue Jun 16 00:41:03 2015 UTC,Natasha Pub   Sounds like a fun bar.
XWingTMG,39ypk5,sacimino40,1 point,Tue Jun 16 03:06:35 2015 UTC,i would think its worth 6 points.
XWingTMG,39ypk5,rsixidor,3,Tue Jun 16 00:11:28 2015 UTC,They specifically say in article that it's a 0 cost ship.
XWingTMG,39ypk5,lsop,2,Tue Jun 16 00:37:37 2015 UTC,Except for the 6 you already paid for the title?
XWingTMG,39ypk5,rsixidor,5,Tue Jun 16 01:49:20 2015 UTC,"That's true, the title is worth 6. But those points are gone when the YV-666 blows up. The article specifically says its a 0 points ship. That's pretty definitive to me."
XWingTMG,39ypk5,CircleTheFire,1 point,Tue Jun 16 02:10:41 2015 UTC,"Which is kind of lame in that it implies that when get down to your ship and the opponent's Pup, the only thing for you to do is run away and make sure it doesn't get a chance to shoot at you because you get no points for killing it, but he can get points for killing you."
XWingTMG,39ypk5,BorisIHateReddit,1 point,Tue Jun 16 03:43:59 2015 UTC,We're trying to find out what you tell your TO when the last ship standing is your opponent's Nashtah Pup - whether you lost 100 and they lost 100 or if there is some innate point value associated with the surviving Z-95.
XWingTMG,39ypk5,PCGamerPirate,3,Tue Jun 16 02:52:18 2015 UTC,I think you can look at the Fel's Wrath scenario in the FAQ as precedence. You get a win with an MoV of 100.
XWingTMG,39ypk5,rsixidor,1 point,Tue Jun 16 03:25:53 2015 UTC,"It's a 0 cost ship. If you've lost the Hound's Tooth and all your other ships, that's a 100 points of your ships destroyed.  The Nashta Pup gives you a chance to keep destroying your enemy's ships after you've allowed the HT to be destroyed. It's pretty cool just as that.  I assume as well that if both teams have destroyed 100 points or an equal amount of points that even if the Pup is alive, the win would go to the player with Initiative in elimination."
XWingTMG,39ypk5,sacimino40,3,Tue Jun 16 11:30:45 2015 UTC,It would be an absolute waste of 6 points if you didnt get the win when destroying all of the other players points with the Natasha Pup.
XWingTMG,39ypk5,VanderLegion,2,Tue Jun 16 15:29:42 2015 UTC,"I assume as well that if both teams have destroyed 100 points or an equal amount of points that even if the Pup is alive, the win would go to the player with Initiative in elimination.   I'm pretty sure even with the Pup being 0 points if you have just the pup and your opponent has no ships left you would get the win.  MoV only matters for tie-breakers or if you go to time.  The default win is destroying all opponents ships.  You would just get 0 MoV for the victory (well, 100+0)"
XWingTMG,39ypk5,rsixidor,1 point,Tue Jun 16 16:20:54 2015 UTC,You're absolutely right.
XWingTMG,39ypk5,CyclopticBinLid,1 point,Tue Jun 16 18:30:21 2015 UTC,"I believe it will count as the ship still being on the board. So you don't get the points for the Hounds Tooth until you destroy both the 666 and the Z95.  Yeah, it means that everyone is going to be using the tooth card, but it just means everyone focus fires on the tooth, destroys it early and then hunts the pup down."
XWingTMG,39ypk5,MythicalMothman,4,Tue Jun 16 10:29:24 2015 UTC,"The art on the Nashtah Pup card is pretty cool, that would make for an awesome repaint. I can't find any other pictures of the Pup online but I suppose the YV-666 model itself will be a decent reference."

Definitely not a Z-95, but it works for the purposes of this game."
XWingTMG,39ypk5,rsixidor,2,Tue Jun 16 03:04:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the SW Gamer issue said it was a z95 that could hold a second crew member. So different between those sources.

Don't know."
XWingTMG,39ypk5,dxsio,2,Mon Jun 15 23:04:54 2015 UTC,"I expect crackshot will be 1 pt, when attacking a ship in your arc, discard this to cause the defender to discard one focus or evade token."
XWingTMG,39ypk5,Beriner,2,Mon Jun 15 23:46:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah i guess I could see that. When firing in your arc, discard 1 of the defense tokens or defense die. That's a pretty cheap 1 cost card though."

XWingTMG,39ypk5,mxzf,5,Tue Jun 16 02:14:01 2015 UTC,"Nice, another ship with a full stop on the dial.    Also, nice to see hard point costs for two more ships.  ATM it's looking like the Hound's Tooth and K-Wing are both massively undercosted compared to the costings of previous ships.  I'm wondering what the reasoning behind it is."
XWingTMG,39ypk5,NoamChompski,6,Mon Jun 15 22:06:31 2015 UTC,"Just curious, but how exactly are they massively under cost? I'm just wondering how you calculate that."
XWingTMG,39ypk5,mxzf,1 point,Mon Jun 15 22:20:03 2015 UTC,"I'm using a spreadsheet that someone made a while ago which I put on google docs and have been updating.  It's been fairly good at matching ship prices so far, but the K-Wing and Hound's Tooth are both coming out quite far from what the equation says.  I think the big thing is FFG is giving a 'bulk discount' on some of the upgrades, since both of those ships have so many upgrade slots that you'll almost never use all of them.  Once the final price for the K-wing is out, once the dial is spoiled that is, I'll try and see if I can figure out what factor they're using to give discounts like that and add that in to the calculations."
XWingTMG,39ypk5,stmack,7,Mon Jun 15 22:28:08 2015 UTC,"meh take in mind that the Hound's Tooth can't K-turn, it's basically a heftier shuttle with a wider firing arc. We also haven't seen the K-wing's dial yet and it has base 2 attack, I'm expecting it won't have a K-turn either and will have to rely on double hard turns via SLAM to turn around which will be a disadvantage."
XWingTMG,39ypk5,Beriner,5,Mon Jun 15 22:50:38 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure I'd call it a heftier shuttle.  It has a pretty nice dial for what it can do. All 1s are green, 2 and 3 straight are green, it has 2 and 3 turns, 2 being red. Has a 4 forward.  It's got pretty damn good maneuvers for what it is."
XWingTMG,39ypk5,mxzf,2,Mon Jun 15 22:58:37 2015 UTC,"I understand.  When I was saying ""they're overpriced"", I was saying that their estimated prices before I plugged dials in at all was about equal to the actual price, much less after the value of the dial is factored in.  The Hound's Tooth ends up 9 points above the estimated value after the dial is added in and I expect the K-Wing to be more like 10-12 off.    There's got to be some modifier that hasn't been factored in previously that is coming into play for those two ships."
XWingTMG,39ypk5,EdgeOfDreams,2,Tue Jun 16 00:29:35 2015 UTC,"Could the lack of access to defensive crew upgrades (Ysanne Isard and C3P0 being the major ones) be a factor for the Hound's Tooth?  I've also heard speculation that someone on the design team seems to be convinced that being on a large base is a huge disadvantage, which is why all the large base ships have way more HP for their cost than an equivalently-stated small ship would have."
XWingTMG,39ypk5,mxzf,1 point,Tue Jun 16 01:15:38 2015 UTC,"Well, all large ships have an innate 10.5 point 'discount' because of their large size.  That's already factored in to the Hound's Tooth.    My guess is that at least part of the point disparity with the Hound's Tooth is that you're pretty much expected to take the 6-point Pup if you're flying it, and if you do end up deploying the Pup, you've lost the rest of the ship.  That and the fact that crew upgrades are 'worth' a ton, 3 points each.  My guess is that it's a combination of the Pup costing 6 points and a bit of a discount on crew because there are so many that it's hard to make use of all of them at once.    As for the K-Wing, a decent chunk of the point disparity (7.5 points) is from the fact that it has a 360 turret.  Between the ordnance it's expected to be using a lot and the SLAM it'll be using preventing it from firing, I feel like the K-Wing won't be making that much use of the 360 turret.  In addition, the K-Wing has both Crew and Turret upgrades, two of the most 'valuable' upgrades from a point standpoint; it seems like the devs might not be valuing them as heavily as the person who made this spreadsheet.  Between those two factors, I think that accounts for the point disparity decently well.  Again, all of these numbers I'm using are from fan-derived formulas.  These are someone's best guess as to how FFG decides how much ships cost, rather than being actual official numbers.  This isn't a ""FFG got the points wrong"" this is ""our analysis of FFG's older ships doesn't quite line up with these two""."
XWingTMG,39ypk5,EdgeOfDreams,1 point,Tue Jun 16 02:18:30 2015 UTC,"Cool, that's really interesting information. There's also the fact that the people designing the current wave of ships aren't necessarily the same people who designed the older ships, so they may have different ideas about balance or be experimenting with the design space."
XWingTMG,39ypk5,mxzf,1 point,Tue Jun 16 03:11:49 2015 UTC,"That's a fair point too.  Both ships do have a lot for the points, but at the same time I couldn't see them being worth flying if they were too much more expensive.  Both ships are trying out some funky differences to see what works well, it's definitely some new design space."
XWingTMG,39ypk5,VanderLegion,1 point,Tue Jun 16 04:02:27 2015 UTC,"Even without the k-turn thhe hound's tooth it has a slightly better dial.  It has 1 banks green and has a white 3 turn, so it can at least turn around in 2 turns unlike the shuttle."

XWingTMG,39ypk5,mxzf,2,Mon Jun 15 22:59:15 2015 UTC,"Point-wise, it's actually a significantly better dial, due to the larger number of greens/maneuvers in general.  Point-wise the dial is on par with the X-Wing or Advanced in terms of value."

XWingTMG,39ypk5,TheDoctorHam,1 point,Tue Jun 16 04:56:54 2015 UTC,So am I understanding it right that Bossk's pilot ability triggers after defense dice are rolled?
XWingTMG,39ypk5,VanderLegion,1 point,Tue Jun 16 14:11:13 2015 UTC,"Correct.  It triggers when you actually hit with an attack, so it's only if you rolled at least 1 crit that wasn't cancelled by the opponent's defense dice that it would trigger"
XWingTMG,39ypk5,EdgeofCosmos,1 point,Tue Jun 16 16:15:19 2015 UTC,"Is it me or do they get the rules wrong when discussing Greedo as crew? Greedo turns a damage card face up, which is not the same as a crit result..."
XWingTMG,39ypk5,VanderLegion,5,Mon Jun 15 22:51:23 2015 UTC,"The point is that you can use Bossk's ability to turn a crit into 2 hits, then STILL get the first dmaage card dealt faceup if you use Greedo."

XWingTMG,39ypk5,Beriner,2,Mon Jun 15 22:56:26 2015 UTC,I thought they were just talking about how they can eat through the shields quicker by turning a crit into 2 hits to get to the point of using Greedo sooner.
XWingTMG,39ypk5,EdgeofCosmos,1 point,Mon Jun 15 22:54:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think you're probably right."
XWingTMG,39ypk5,The_Recreator,2,Mon Jun 15 22:56:54 2015 UTC,"Greedo does not flip a face-down card face-up, he deals the first damage card as a face-up card. This is an important distinction when dealing with Chewbacca and is effectively the same thing as a crit. However, because it is not a [crit] die result, Greedo can't cause an infinite damage loop with Bossk (never mind that Greedo's ability only triggers once per round)."
XWingTMG,39ypk5,Beriner,2,Mon Jun 15 22:55:12 2015 UTC,"I like Greedo a lot on Bossk. If you roll a hit, hit, crit, and there are no shields or small enough that you break through.  It's almost the same as rolling hit, hit, hit, crit (though technically a hit). Granted, that initial hit, hit, crit is gonna get some of it blocked. so who knows, maybe they have one shield left and all that gets through is a crit.  That's great cause you change it to 2 hits and then you break shield and the last hit is basically a crit with greedo."
XWingTMG,39ypk5,MythicalMothman,1 point,Mon Jun 15 23:03:50 2015 UTC,Plus Greedo feels like less of a waste of a crew slot when you have three! Greedo sounds like a fun card to me but it's hard to justify taking up a Firespray's crew slot instead of Recon Specialist or whatever.
XWingTMG,39ypk5,EdgeofCosmos,1 point,Tue Jun 16 00:45:17 2015 UTC,"My point exactly :)  But as others have posted, You can't use Bossk's ability on Greedo's faceup damage-cards, but you can use Greedo's ability on Bossk's 2-hits-from-a-crit-result ability."
XWingTMG,39ypk5,VanderLegion,1 point,Mon Jun 15 22:58:46 2015 UTC,Greedo can't cause an infinite damage loop with Bossk (never mind that Greedo's ability only triggers once per round).   Greedo's also only triggers once per attack  Edit: That was supposed to read Bossk's ability only triggers once per attack anyway
XWingTMG,39ypk5,The_Recreator,2,Mon Jun 15 23:23:09 2015 UTC,"Strictly speaking, Greedo triggers the first time you attack and the first time you defend each round. Corollary: the second time you defend, Greedo does not trigger (even if you are dealt a damage card for the first time during that second attack).  http://xwing-miniatures.wikia.com/wiki/Greedo"

I'm using:  OGP w/Adv Sensors + Fleet Officer  Howlrunner  Obsidian Squad x4  Dash/Corran is really exactly what you don't want to see... 2 dice attacks against 3 dice defense is hard to damage ever, no matter how many times you roll... if the Corran is using R2-D2 then he's going to be really hard to take out..."
XWingTMG,3a2kd4,howieloader,1 point,Tue Jun 16 23:26:41 2015 UTC,"Not what I want to hear. The part about not taking Dash out, not your build. About your build, I've noticed sensors in a lot builds lately, what do you like about them?"
XWingTMG,3a2kd4,howieloader,2,Tue Jun 16 23:53:24 2015 UTC,"A few things... In this situation I'm using them to use my Fleet Officer before I move... Fleet Officer is an action that lets me give 2 focus tokens to 2 friendly ships (can't remember if there's a range restriction), but it gives the ship with the Fleet Officer a stress token... So in this case I use my Advanced Sensors to activate my Fleet Officer giving a focus token to two friendly ships, I receive a stress token, reveal a green maneuver, and now I've cleared that stress immediately...  Some people like Advanced Sensors so they can barrel roll before moving, possibly to avoid a bump letting them keep their actions..."

XWingTMG,3a21qi,LazyG,3,Tue Jun 16 16:59:52 2015 UTC,Well until it is dead it still shoots with the same red dice and defends with the same green. I like the rules as they are. This is why you focus fire (concentrate on one ship till it is dead).
XWingTMG,3a21qi,ilikexwing,3,Tue Jun 16 17:19:41 2015 UTC,"Also, a lot of the game is designed and balanced taking this into consideration.  Changing it would screw up a lot things like a ship's cost and abilities.  If a Decimator gave you half points for losing half it's Hull, it would be a much weaker ship.  I think it is a can of worms that should not be opened.  The game is great as it stands, IMO."
XWingTMG,3a21qi,ilikexwing,-2,Tue Jun 16 18:27:55 2015 UTC,"Soooo basically u want to say its ok to field 2 very sturdy ships and do ezmode stuff, pling someone and sit in corner cheezing ? The Big ships are promoted like this... use them coz they are MORE competitive. If they were to give points after dmg maybe more people would choose other options ? Also... if something is damaged u need to fix it, hence dmg to ships gives points for them. In Wh40 there are a lot of very expensive models and noone whines that they are weaker coz they give VP when wounded.

XWingTMG,3a217s,X-factor103,1 point,Tue Jun 16 17:05:38 2015 UTC,"You occasionally see a decimator or leebo with determination, but everything else is very rare, partially because crit effects haven't been that strong and because there are more consistent cards."

XWingTMG,3a217s,FireResistant,1 point,Wed Jun 17 04:54:47 2015 UTC,inertial dampeners can performed while stressed which means you can pull two turns in a row at 0 with the yv 666

Expansions typically take ~6 months between announcement and release, with Epic ships taking an even longer time.    It's not unexpected, FFG just had absurdly unrealistic hopes that they shouldn't have opened their mouths about so early in development."
XWingTMG,3a1ppa,mxzf,3,Tue Jun 16 15:51:13 2015 UTC,"It's hard to tell with FFG. I play Netrunner, also one of their products, and releases are notoriously late. The shipping strike on the west coast of the US didn't help matters, but usually they are anywhere from half a quarter to as much as a full quarter behind on many releases.  It could just be ""the pace of business"" with FFG and nothing more. But who knows, I like to save on shipping too."
XWingTMG,3a1ppa,X-factor103,3,Tue Jun 16 15:36:31 2015 UTC,I think they are waiting for nationals season to end before they drop it. Just to save the shake up for worlds. I believe that it will be at Gencon and maybe Wave Seven as well.
XWingTMG,3a1ppa,-SeizureSalad-,2,Tue Jun 16 16:46:32 2015 UTC,I just dont get why they even announce a date. Every single thing they announce is late. Just fucking say the date its actually going to come out. How do they not learn?

XWingTMG,3a1ewq,-SeizureSalad-,2,Tue Jun 16 13:58:36 2015 UTC,"Your Rouge squadron title (It's Rogue, btw) is much more than a free free push the limit with no stress for all X-wings you have,  It would allow unique droid abilities to be shared across all of them.  4 x-wings would be able to gain an extra agility, attempt to discard a damage card, Use R7-T1's boost/TL ability, and still have a focus.  They could do this every single round without taking any stress."

XWingTMG,3a1ewq,ilikexwing,1 point,Tue Jun 16 15:26:20 2015 UTC,"Some thoughts on the Rogue Squadron title.  I think it can be very powerful, but I also think it is the right idea.  I think we could tweak it so that it is powerful but not OP.  What about something like this: Rogue Squadron Title - Cost 1(2?) - Whenever the ability of a droid on your ship activates, you can share it with one other X-Wing with the Rogue Squadron title within range 1. (Maybe only limit it to droid actions and not abilities).  One of the thematic and cool things about Xwings is the droids. They can be very good when shared.  X-Wings need some boost, this may be a good improvement."
XWingTMG,3a1ewq,Shgrizz,1 point,Tue Jun 16 18:11:20 2015 UTC,"I don't like the share am abilities because I think people would complain about having to take am just to make the Xwing better. Its a weird cycle I see with the Xwing fixes,where every one wants something for free over having to invest more points into the ship.  But yea my idea wasn't a good one and the community has most definitely let me know lol."
XWingTMG,3a1ewq,T-Minus9,2,Tue Jun 16 19:49:01 2015 UTC,"To be honest, I don't like either. The second is flat out ridiculously overpowered, and would make X wings turn into auto-evading, focussing, target locking engine-upgrade-boosting super soontirs that don't take stress. It just wouldn't work.  The first has the problem of being more beneficial as you include more X wings, and I think what the X wing really needs is more incentive to just slip one, maybe two into a list. Pure X wing lists aren't the aim, they just need to have a little more bang for their buck.  Still the best idea I've seen is a title card that drops the cost of AM droids by 1-2 points."

I get it that my original rogue idea was not well thought out, it was a secondary idea I had this morning to the red squad one. What if the action was at the cost of a stress? Would that make it more balanced? Gives a single chance for the opportunity but a little more variety to make use of the unique upgrades sprinkled throughout the Xwings."
XWingTMG,3a1ewq,T-Minus9,1 point,Tue Jun 16 19:43:40 2015 UTC,"I like the red squadron title, but I would limit it to 1 otherwise it stays getting really op with 4 red squad pilots."

This is usually easily explained by the software trying to avoid duplicate pairings. It usually can just swap 1 or 2 players for an easy fix, but sometimes (especially in events with less players) it has to make some crazy changes. You can turn off the automatic duplicate fixing to see what collisions you would have had and how it ""fixed"" them.

XWingTMG,39x2ti,fl1p_problems,2,Tue Jun 16 09:53:35 2015 UTC,"Fel is really useful because of how maneuverable he is. He's able to put pressure on enemies that the Defender and Lambda can't catch by themselves, so the list doesn't work that well without him! You could maybe run it with Carnor Jax instead, but even that would be pushing it. I definitely wouldn't have done very well against the dual Aggressors if I didn't have Fel matching their antics with his own.   On the other hand, I've seen similar lists with an OGP that replace Vessery with Whisper and they can work pretty well! I've tried the opposite, replacing Fel with Whisper, and got murdered by a list with Rebel Captive and Sensor Jammer on the same ship. Fel is certainly useful in those situations."
XWingTMG,39x2ti,starslinger72,2,Tue Jun 16 13:07:46 2015 UTC,"This is because Fel, and Whisper, are closers.  They are ships that you want to get to the end game 1v1 that can close out almost any match up.  When you drop a closer for another brawler, such as kath, then you lose what makes the list work.  Vessery and the shuttle put out a large amount of damage, which you have to deal with while fel gets to fly around.  Once you kill them you should have the field dropped to 1v1 or 1v2 which is the end game you generally want."
XWingTMG,39x2ti,starslinger72,1 point,Tue Jun 16 19:49:15 2015 UTC,"When you drop a closer for another brawler, such as kath, then you lose what makes the list work.   Yep, that's been my experience. You'll face enemy closers and you'll need one of your own, a fat turret, or perhaps a ton of ships to counter that. Without any of those you're usually in trouble.   Though I did hear about a two Defender list that made it to the top 4 in a nearby Regionals competition, somehow... Apparently the guy practiced with that list for a long time though and put Engine Upgrades and HLCs on both."
XWingTMG,39x2ti,starslinger72,3,Tue Jun 16 19:52:51 2015 UTC,"No engine upgrades, which are terrible on defenders anyway.   It was   Rex - HLC, Predator, hull, Ion pulse missile  Vessery - HLC, lonewolf, stealth  Vessery is your closer.  If people go after him before rex, his passive will eat them alive.  (this is because the two ship meta gets punished by crits, which he can bring way more of than anyone)  If you leave vessery to last you are trying to hit an agi 4 ship with rerolls from lone wolf that can just save his focus as he is always throwing 4 dice at you for damage.    Im played it a bit this week and really like the way it stands up in the current meta."

That bit in the FAQ has nothing about firing arcs.   there are two checks.  1 for range, and then a 2nd for 'in arc'.   Tactician requires both to activate.   Look at the bit about autothrusters.    ""If a ship with a turret weapon attacks a ship equipped with Autothrusters, first measure closest point to closest point to determine range, then use the printed firing arc on the attacker to determine whether the defender is in the attacker’s firing arc.""  Tactician: ""After you perform an attack against a ship inside your firing arc at Range 2, that ship receives 1 stress token.""  Tactician works great on Firespray (and looks like it will be awesome on the YV-666) because it works in both the primary and secondary arcs.  but still within arc."

XWingTMG,39wkwq,SlyMurdoc,1 point,Mon Jun 15 21:42:46 2015 UTC,"So I played the 2xOnyx+HLC, Jonus list yesterday against a buddy of mine who I consider to be a really good player. He fielded 2x Blue B, FCS, Flechette + 2x Gold Y, Title, R2, ICT.  I ended up wiping him off the field. I planned on getting him into the asteroids but ended up jousting. His ships come in a perfect jousting line. My ships in a tight formation, Defenders up front Jonus close behind.  First round at range 3, I shoot first, blast one B. return fire strips a shield off one defender Second round at range 1, I shoot first, blast one Y, return fire gets the first defender down to HP and ionizes Jonus (dont know why he went for that...) third round, Defenders 4k into position and TL the B, Jonus flies the ion 1 the remaining Y and B focus on Jonus, I take out one B and the return fire takes the first defender.  Then it's Jonus at 4H and a fresh defender against a Y-wing. After another 4k getting me behind the stressed Y-wing and another round of shooting he calls it.  I really was surprised by that result I expected to get smashed by the BYBY jousters, but shooting first and focusing fire really did it here."
XWingTMG,39wkwq,PCGamerPirate,2,Wed Jun 24 08:12:47 2015 UTC,Let's be real here. Jonus is only there for the HLC Rerolls. Why not make him even better by using Squad Leader. Then you can give a target lock to a defender. HLC w/ Target Lock and Focus is a real thing.
XWingTMG,39wkwq,EdgeofCosmos,1 point,Mon Jun 15 14:56:15 2015 UTC,"I was going to say that target lock and jonus are redundant but having a TL let's you modify your range 1 shots when they happen.  Interesting...  HLC+Focus+Jonus Rerolls = 3.7 hits  Range 1+Focus+Target Lock = 3.75 hits  With 2 defenders, nearly 15 hits on average.

Variant A: Deadeye (1) Flechette Torpedos (2) Muinitions Failsafe (1) I shoot the Torpedos with Focus, and hope to miss. The defender gets a stress and I can repeat next round.

Remember that the 5k is extremely useful (more so than the 3 is, usually).  And find a way to keep your opponent from bumping you. You lose your actions (to evade, usually) and your ships will start popping.  Also, I'd consider Predator over PTL.

XWingTMG,39xt57,ChiBlock,1 point,Mon Jun 15 18:43:01 2015 UTC,"Have you considered stripping some the upgrades and getting a whole extra ship+cannon? That makes 4 HLC instead of 3. 16 dice worth of attack value, which is as good as it gets at this time (only 8 academy pilots or Thug Lyfe can match those numbers). True, you won't have the PTL potential of lock+focus, but I still think the 4 extra dice might be worth it.  edit: the Scyk can also evade if you need it to, which greatly increases its survivability. It is very hard to one-shot something that has an evade token (unless you are using HLC)."
XWingTMG,39vy2e,Inquisitorsz,5,Mon Jun 15 06:11:12 2015 UTC,"In secondary weapon attacks such as this HLC, range 3 defender does not receive the extra green die bonus. In the game's current meta, pilots like soontir fel and Corran horn are hard to hit even with rolling 3 red dice. Being able to roll 4 red dice at range 2-3 is phenomenal, especially at range 3 if jousting 1 on 1. That means you can roll 4 dice with HLC and when defending, if your opponent is firing with their primary attack, you still get the extra green die."
XWingTMG,39vy2e,bighamsterneck,4,Mon Jun 15 06:17:33 2015 UTC,"Well here is the thing about HLC. I used to think it was over costed as well till I started playing with it heavily. I run a Tie Defender (Vessery) with a HLC.  The reason it is completely worth the point investment is simply the difference between 3 red dice and 4 red is very significant. Ships in X-wing have 3 or lower evade dice base. Meaning that if you roll max on a HLC there is literally no way they can dodge all of it. An that's assuming they are in a high agility ship that has 3 green dice.  The reason the HLC is arguably better than the mangler is you still only get 3 dice which granted only ships like the Interceptor can dodge consistently but since Soontir is one of the most commonly played ships that is a factor. Your opponent is still physically able to dodge all of the damage from a Mangler where the only ship in the game that naturally has 4 green dice defending (without a stealth device) is a cloaked Phantom.  Now that being said the HLC is expensive but in the right squad that can fully capitalize on that extra damage, it can't be beat for a cannon slot. Where as the mangler cannon, your paying 4 points to give yourself a bonus at range 3 and change 1 hit to a crit. (which mind you the crits are random so it may do nothing to help you) Most ships (that I can think of) that can equip a cannon already have a 3 red dice attack so your paying 4 points for the effects that it adds attacking. Tho keep in mind again the mangler does not get a bonus dice at range 1 an while the HLC can't fire at range 1 at all most of the time you will just fire your primary weapon for the bonus dice. (meaning you won't be using the mangler range 1 anyways most of the time)  The exceptions being an Outrider I would say you shouldn't use a HLC over Mangler simply cause if someone gets into your range 1 blind spot it can be tough. An I wouldn't run dual IG-88's with it for the same reason. (1 HLC and 1 Mangler sounds better)  It all depends on the build which is better a HLC or Mangler."
XWingTMG,39vy2e,Dakkon_B,3,Mon Jun 15 07:23:57 2015 UTC,"Meaning that if you roll max on a HLC there is literally no way they can dodge all of it.   Just to point out, that's not completely true.  The Phantom can easily have 4 green dice, and many ships can have 4 green dice with Stealth Device.  A 4-hit roll usually means some damage sticks, but it's not guaranteed."
XWingTMG,39vy2e,mxzf,2,Mon Jun 15 13:39:17 2015 UTC,More importantly is lots of ships have the evade action.  3 agi with an evade can dodge a full hit by an HLC.
XWingTMG,39vy2e,starslinger72,1 point,Mon Jun 15 15:20:31 2015 UTC,Ships in X-wing have 3 or lower evade dice base.    Base being the key word.
XWingTMG,39vy2e,Navihawk11,3,Mon Jun 15 13:54:12 2015 UTC,"Fair enough, that is technically true.  On the flip side, ""there is literally no way they can dodge all of it"" is most definitely false since there is a way to dodge it, have more than your base agility (which isn't particularly difficult)."
XWingTMG,39vy2e,mxzf,2,Mon Jun 15 14:15:59 2015 UTC,Well I did say base. An they have to take an evade just to potentially dodge it all. (meaning they didn't take a focus so they have to roll exceptionally well) An I did say unless it is a 3 agility ship which granted there are a fair number (mostly Imperial) but almost every game I have played/watched people tend to take the focus. What I was referring to is if they are a base 3>x agility  ship (and they didn't take a evade) there is simply no way they can roll well enough to beat 4 hits. The HLC can commonly be firing vs targets that physically can't evade all the attacks cause they didn't take an evade that turn.  Vs a very common exchange is 3 red vs 3 or less green which can still result in zero hits.
XWingTMG,39vy2e,Dakkon_B,0,Mon Jun 15 16:35:15 2015 UTC,We seem to be forgetting Obstacles here....Although you might want the 4pt Golden Luck Drive modification to make sure that extra dice counts for something.
XWingTMG,39vy2e,Nomnomnicon,1 point,Wed Jun 17 08:44:43 2015 UTC,"Oh, I agree, but unless you are super soontir or a phantom, a target locked, focused HLC is going to tag you for at least one."
XWingTMG,39vy2e,Navihawk11,5,Mon Jun 15 14:19:32 2015 UTC,"Basically - there is a very large difference between attacking with 3 and 4 dice that isn't inherently obvious until you sit down and do the math, especially when you factor in upgrade cards and various other pilot abilities.  Bread and Butter example, any ship with Push the Limit, target lock, and focus.  Mangler Cannon is a reasonable budget option, but HLC is almost always worth the extra 3 points if you can afford to pay it."
XWingTMG,39vy2e,Porgon,3,Mon Jun 15 10:08:24 2015 UTC,"HLC can crit. You only need to change the crits on your first roll befor you modify. Every modification you do, witch results in a crit, stays a crit. HLC ist the best option to shoot at range 3. You still got your 4 attack dice, and the defender dosnt get the extra green one. The extra green is only for your primary attack.  Edit: wrong word"

XWingTMG,39vy2e,Nomnomnicon,1 point,Mon Jun 15 13:34:26 2015 UTC,"Various ordnance allows you to roll 4 dice at that range. Still, HLC outclasses ordnance in that it has no firing requirement or cost, meaning locks and focuses can be saved to improve the dice results. If you fire twice with your HLC, you've already been more point-efficient than proton torpedoes."

XWingTMG,39vy2e,Nomnomnicon,2,Wed Jun 17 08:42:20 2015 UTC,"First HLC works best at range 3.  You get full 4 dice and the enemy does not get their range bonus.  Further, if they shoot at you with a primary, you do get the range bonus.   So HLC's tend to work best on ships that can influence the engagement range.  Also they work best when paired with abilities that grant extra rerolls.  I think you have to look at the specific ships and why you'd want an HLC:   B-wing - not a good candidate.  One of the worst ships for controlling the range of engagement.   YT-2400 - This can work well especially if outfitted with outrider and EU.  Without the EU you can too easily get trapped at range 1, and without the title, you'd have to keep arc. Defender - It tends to work well because the defender does excel at quick movement and turn arounds.   In addition, both ace pilot abilities have synergy with the HLC. Shuttle - If there was one ship worse at controlling range than the B-Wing, this is it.  Not really a good fit at all. Firespray - eh, maybe.  Krassis, absolutely.  The others, not so much - have to keep the front arc and their abilities don't play into the HLC range 3 engagement well. Syck - possibly.  It can be a fantastic upgrade, but these ships are very weak.  They have good maneuverability, but a lucky shot and your 23+ point ship is gone.  Aggressor - Yes and no.  It is a good upgrade for the aggressor, especially with the gunner like secondary reroll.  They are one of the more agile cannon bearers and thus can do a good job of picking range.  Plus the way the points break down, gaining 3 points isn't going to get you enough to pick up a 3rd ship (assuming brobots)."
XWingTMG,39vy2e,roman2440,1 point,Mon Jun 15 15:55:49 2015 UTC,"Each additional attack die is exponentially more powerful than the last. If Soontir Fel keeps scoring 3 evades per attack, then the potential to score 4 or 5 hits means that instead of whiffing, you're getting 1 or 2 hits through with every shot.  As for the ""no crits"" drawback, think of it this way: a regular damage card impacts a dead ship as much as a crit. :P"
XWingTMG,39vytm,mikodz,3,Mon Jun 15 06:20:22 2015 UTC,"Yes, if you get the Outmaneuver, you cant use your C3PO. Autoblaster only works if you got a crit. You can get to 0 with your Dice, never with below 0."

XWingTMG,39xk94,FriendlySceptic,3,Mon Jun 15 16:51:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah, someone did it a while back, though I can't find the link right now. Since you can never run more than 8 ships in a list (Academy Pilot - 12 points x 8 = 96 points), you never need more than 8 of any upgrade card (7 really, because I don't think there's any upgrade a TIE Fighter can take with less than 1 point cost), and substantially less than that in most cases, because cheap ships like TIE Fighters can't equip every upgrade type anyway.  In general, if you have 4 of every upgrade, you should be able to field about 90% of the possible 100 point lists."
XWingTMG,39xk94,EdgeOfDreams,2,Mon Jun 15 17:03:32 2015 UTC,"7 card's if the points are 1-2 4 card's if the costs are 3-4 1 card if its 5+ that helps for the most ones.

XWingTMG,39vxey,LazyG,1 point,Mon Jun 15 08:38:02 2015 UTC,"The problem you have, also with /u/Warmo 's lsit is that the A wings roll two dice. Jake gets the extra from opportunist in your list but still A wings lack  punch, and while you can try and barrel/boost into R1, if you don't you lack bite, and Tycho can't even roll.   A wings really benefit from ordnance, proton rockets are a 5 dice smash at R1 and you need focus to fire them but you don;t spend it, so you can then spend the focus to adjust the roll. If you can still sneak in a TL too then you have a serious killshot. However you lose the two point chardan refit discount so it comes out to a 5 point increase on either pilot in your build.   Keyan is great but Warmo is right, Keyan NEEDS stress, hence PTL. PTL gives you the stress that makes Keyan work, and if you add Advanced sensors and engine upgrade, ole Keyan gets pretty maneuverable too. You just Have to make sure you have someone in arc on Keyan, because they need to have someone in arc to be able to shed the stress. You can also try Stay on Target instead of PTL, you don;t get double action but with advanced sensors you get a serious ability to reposition and keep someone in arc.   I'd try something like this http://xwing-builder.co.uk/view/268408/jason-test-mk2-  Keyan stays pretty fat with Stay on Target, so you plot basically speed 2 maneuvers every turn, and one that is obviously wrong, then you can turn it to any speed 2 you like  to keep someone in arc. Plus you can advanced sensor roll beforehand if you like for even more options.   I went with tactician over merc copilot, as that stress is pretty brutal. You already get a crit off the mangler and the stress is nastier.   Then i left in Jake, who is more zippy as he gets the barrel option from a focus. PTL means two actions, and just plot green maneuvers only each turn to ditch the stress. I went for predator but you could also try outmanuever, but i left in proton rockets for a finisher, and autothrusters as it makes Jake super slippy.   THen i went with two bandit Z95s. You can use them to block for Jake and Keyan, and while lacking any of Tycho's tricks, youa re still throwing twice as many reds a turn if you keep things in arc."

XWingTMG,39u0v4,RoguishAlpaca,2,Sun Jun 14 20:27:24 2015 UTC,I think I might get more use out of the gunner / fire control system combo. So far my main problem with bombers has been the economy of actions.  I need those target locks to fire the missiles. But at the same time bombers really want the barrel rolls and focus to get into range 1-2 with their target in their arc somewhat unscathed.  But really my main concern with the list is the simply atrocious dial for the shuttle. I've never felt the need to fly interceptor level agility but that shuttle is something else entirely.

XWingTMG,39u0v4,Nomnomnicon,1 point,Mon Jun 15 05:58:42 2015 UTC,"I can't open the link for the list, but I feel your pain on flying the shuttle. I also like bombers and find the TIE one so much more mobile than the Y-Wing. Without seeing the list in full I can't say much more apart from give advice on flying the shuttle.  The Space Hippo must fly serenely, if aggressively, slightly around its target - if you fly straight at it you will find that correcting your course afterwards is somewhat difficult. I'm hoping you gave it wings/Engine Upgrade so it can float a little more gracefully. If you find you're going to be out of the fight for a turn, or simply doubt you'll be able to shoot for a turn, then it's worth driving onto obstacles to bring its firepower to bear sooner rather than play safe and miss out on another round or two of firing. I classic deploy mine off centre and use the 0 first turn. Another use/'technique' is to us it to block other big ships. I use Anti-Pursuit lasers for this reason, although I sorely miss the EU at least once a game.   If you're using secondary weapons and have Jonus, focus and you'll usually find you get hits. This makes Gunner pretty surplus for 5 pts and a crew slot. Regarding missiles, you so need the TL's and some guarnatee that you might hit is nice - MuniFailsafe is nice but you still use up the Target Lock. However, saving the points might be worth it. Are you using Weapons Engineer?"
XWingTMG,39u0v4,Stetto,1 point,Mon Jun 15 09:34:56 2015 UTC,"I think, you're overloading your shuttle. While it is very fast with Engine Upgrade, it's still not very maneuverable.  Imho, it's better to fly either Jendon with less upgrades and bombers. In this case, stick with Concussion Missiles, unless you expect low agi ships. Otherwise, stick with an OGP + HLC + EU + Adv.

Kath with VI, K4 security droid and say some proximity mines (or seismic charges) looks more fun for me. The K4 is fun as greens take you a long way on a large ship and it is a free TL. Or to fly defensive swap it out for RecSpec and have double focus to run one each for attacking and defending.   Still, that leaves a funny list. Palob is a great pilot but too expensive as you run it. RecSPec is far better with the crow title and blaster turret than  Outlaw tech as it is more reliable, and Wingman is nto good as the crow dial sucks balls. It is hard to fly formation with it, the firsepray will jump ahead due to the big base size and IMO Serissu is too expensive for a bodyguard for Palob."
XWingTMG,39t7uq,cassarlex,2,Sun Jun 14 15:22:12 2015 UTC,"I don't know how I feel about engine upgrade on a Y-Wing with such low pilot skill. Maybe drop the bombs to bump them to PS 4, so you can react to some low pilot skill ships, plus avoid Predator double rerolls."
XWingTMG,39t7uq,wer2,1 point,Sun Jun 14 18:09:17 2015 UTC,"There's some room for different builds of this list, which I like.  I ran this list to good effect for a few weeks of league night right after S&V dropped. https://geordanr.github.io/xwing/?f=Scum%20and%20Villainy&d=v3!s!123:0,116,-1,121,28:21:-1:;123:0,116,-1,121,28:21:-1:;100:18,-1:16:15:U.43,U.113  I actually prefer Unhinged Astro now. the Adv. Sensors+PTL trick can be pretty good and of course Sensors works great before an S-loop. VI seems like a perfectly reasonable choice, though. I think I might be more likely to take Predator now instead of PTL or VI but then you're fighting Dash for Initiative, which can backfire."
XWingTMG,39t7uq,rsixidor,1 point,Sun Jun 14 21:20:41 2015 UTC,"My list of the same name uses just the ion turret, title and r4 agromech on the y-wins and adds a z95 to the list (and FCS on xizor instead of sensors)"
XWingTMG,39t7uq,VanderLegion,1 point,Mon Jun 15 05:03:44 2015 UTC,Dropping the EU and Siesmic charges on the Y's leaves 12 points for a basic Z95. It can either block or be the Flak jacket for Xizor if the Y;s fall behind.

XWingTMG,39vm85,ernesto__-,11,Mon Jun 15 04:07:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's Vader's personal shuttle. It was unique, it gets a title.  I hate ""fix"" threads and ideas for ""broken"" ships because I don't think this game is nearly ""broken"" enough to throw around those negative terms, but if I had to, I would say that a generic title card would be the best way to get the X-Wing back into competition.  Similar to the A-Wing or Interceptor generic title cards.  Even if it's sort of like the TIE-Advanced one, which lets you take a free/reduced-cost modification or astromech."
XWingTMG,39vm85,KTreu42,2,Mon Jun 15 04:19:37 2015 UTC,"The problem is that the X wing has no clear role. A wing is zippy, Y wing is a turret tank, Bwing is a shooty tank, E wing is a heavy fighter/system slot carrier, Z95 is a cheap filler/blocker. X wing is just.... middling. I think it doesn;t need just a buff, it needs a purpose ."
XWingTMG,39vm85,LazyG,2,Mon Jun 15 13:41:40 2015 UTC,"It's trying to fill the jack of all trades slot, but it suffers the same curse of everyone who tries that in that it's a master of none.  The X-Wing just needs to be a little better at everything; then it would be the all-around champ that it should be.  An XXX list should be decent at facing any other list, but not dominant against anything, either."
XWingTMG,39vm85,i_shit_my_spacepants,1 point,Mon Jun 15 20:55:22 2015 UTC,"I agree, however an X heavy list of non-aces will likely get spanked, because it has some signal lacks. Three red dice is not bad, and two green is fair. Even the hull/shields are fair, but we are talking about a jouster, and it has a major issue, it has no repositioning.   I think a boost or barrel, i prefer a barrel I think, would work somehow, for some cost. With a bit more positional flexibility it could use the torpedo slots more effectively too. Systemslot is too much and makes it compete with the E wing.   As a jack of all trades, some way to more reactively position would be good."
XWingTMG,39vm85,LazyG,-4,Mon Jun 15 21:27:35 2015 UTC,I'd kind of like to see something different.  Suggestion:  Title: Rogue Squadron (2 pt). All forward or banked maneuvers at distance 2 or 3 are green maneuvers when revealed. Requires Pilot Skill 6
XWingTMG,39vm85,excallq,3,Mon Jun 15 04:42:59 2015 UTC,Not a good fix... Does nothing for Rookies and Red Squadron which are much more overpriced than the named pilots... And no one is running that on a XXX list at 6 points...
XWingTMG,39vm85,howieloader,-7,Mon Jun 15 05:52:58 2015 UTC,"Oh I'm sorry, I didn't realize by ""fix"" we meant ""something that would make X-wing swarms viable""."
XWingTMG,39vm85,excallq,6,Mon Jun 15 06:34:21 2015 UTC,"Don't be an ass.   Anyway, name X wings are still viable. Wedge and Biggs can cut it. Wes too. It doesn't need to be about X swarms, but IMO a fix should make cheap/generic X's useful, like the Chardaan refit and BTL titles do."
XWingTMG,39vm85,LazyG,0,Mon Jun 15 09:56:40 2015 UTC,"Tell it to the guy shooting down peoples' ideas because they don't make X-wings OP.  And that's not what every title does. MF doesn't make ORS that much better. Royal Guard Tie isn't usable by Alpha/Avengers.  Different titles do different things. Ironically, my suggestion would do what you asked for, give X-wings a purpose (stress-killer with 3 attack,) but apparently your stated aim < x-wing swarm."
XWingTMG,39vm85,excallq,1 point,Mon Jun 15 14:39:06 2015 UTC,"No, I said to give generic/unnamed X wing's have a purpose. Your fix is ONLY available to Garen, Jek, Luke, Wes and Wedge.   /u/howieloader didn't like your fix, but you jumped to the aggressive sarcasm.   Yes indeed, other titles do other things, but an X wing title should still, in my opinion make the Xwing attractive in something other than the elite plot it currently resides.   The MF title was not a fix anyway, ti shipped with the pack. RGP is different indeed and was a buff to elite Tie/In, I guess like autothrusters to keep arcdodgers working. Chaardan refit and BT:-A4 were more like what we are discussing, fixes for generally lower PS/generic ships. That is what I think the X wing needs, not to support swarms but to add more purpose to them. Your fix is to make them able to shed stress, so i guess joust better.   In terms of other purpose, I am not sure. I suggested in another thread to make a rogue title give an EPT discount as it added flexibility to the X and also would be thematic for the rogues. Also even with an EPT, XXXX would not be OP. Certainly not versus 4xRGP."

XWingTMG,39vm85,howieloader,-1,Mon Jun 15 12:38:34 2015 UTC,"It would be an unnecessary thing. Why do we need to swarm a ship with three attack, five shield/hull, and an upgrade class (astromech) not available to most other ships?  Moreover, how are you going to make a swarm viable without overpowering the named pilots?"
XWingTMG,39vm85,excallq,1 point,Mon Jun 15 14:42:40 2015 UTC,"Theres already B Swarms that have a system upgrade plus a barrel roll with 3 more health each...

XWingTMG,39vm85,howieloader,-2,Mon Jun 15 15:08:06 2015 UTC,So what would your fix be?
XWingTMG,39vm85,excallq,0,Mon Jun 15 15:12:02 2015 UTC,"Something like, but not necessarily: Title, 0 points, Friendly ships within range 3 share generic astromech abilities.  I would be happy with a system upgrade title too..."
XWingTMG,39vm85,howieloader,2,Mon Jun 15 16:53:05 2015 UTC,The X-Wing is mostly fine and if anything it needs just a little nudge to be better with Astromechs. Give it a title that reduce the cost of an equipped Astromech by 1 point and call it a day.
XWingTMG,39vm85,Holmelunden,4,Mon Jun 15 05:13:36 2015 UTC,"Look at what all the generic title cards give and you think reducing astromechs by 1 point is a solid fix???  A-Wing- Extra EPT, point reduction in missile slot  Y-Wing- Free bomb slot, attack with both weapons  Interceptor - Free extra mod slot  Tie 1/x- Adds system upgrade, reduces card cost by 4, gets unique that adds a crit for 1 point  How does reducing largely underwhelming astromechs by 1 point compare to any of those???  Edit: Fixed spacing"
XWingTMG,39vm85,howieloader,2,Mon Jun 15 06:01:42 2015 UTC,"Both of those ships were far more severely underpowered than the X wing is. The advanced in particular was over costed by... Well, about 4 points. Whereas the X wing is perhaps over costed by 1-2 points if anything."

Tychos ability to use daredevil care free is his most unique ability. Tons of ships can boost barrel roll, but only Tycho can pull off daredevil stress free. Who needs a k turn when you can perform a 1 hard turn, perform an evade, use experimental interface to daredevil another 90 degrees and then use ptl to boost and get your shot perfect. That's one hell of a turn radius.  I only really fly Tycho in epic games because how expensive he is for a ship that rolls two red dice. But if you just want to have fun flying one of the coolest ships in the game, you should do Tycho all the way up."

I'm also toying with B wings with HLC (possibly Keyan with PTL), as at range 3 you can roll 4 dice and negate range defense bonuses, while at range 1-2 you can just use your primary for crit power and Keyan's pilot ability.  I'm concerned about the point usage by putting both these named pilots into a squad, but it sounds so totally fun! Hit em hard at any range."

XWingTMG,39rwvq,Ohthatguyagain,2,Sun Jun 14 04:04:02 2015 UTC,"All I'll say is this;  When you're getting used to the game, and start making your own lists, the temptation is to pile on talents and special features, and you'll end up with 2 or 3 ships with 5 upgrade cards each on a named pilot and you WILL end up forgetting half those benefits in the heat of battle (predator re-rolls, for example).  This game is about flying ships first, and shooting guns second. So you'll have a lot more fun flying more ships with less upgrades to remember, and concentrate on positioning etc.  My advice? Field everything you can, use spare points available to boost a PS1 to a PS3 etc.  Fly casual."
XWingTMG,39rwvq,Petunia2t,1 point,Sun Jun 14 05:22:00 2015 UTC,"I completely agree. At most have one named pilot with maybe one upgrade as a beginner.   Also, matching all your pilot skills is great for a new player as you can choose activation order and have less chance of unintended bumping."

It'll get you a bit more used to how larger numbers of ships interact on the table. Large ships are a bit of a game changer in terms of blocking, and you'll bump an awful lot when you start using them. But it's early days, and just do what you enjoy and have fun with it. Also, the FAQ on FFG's official website is very good, and I recommend using it - if you have any problems with the rules, odds are it's explained there. Enjoy!"
XWingTMG,39rwvq,Shgrizz,1 point,Sun Jun 14 07:48:33 2015 UTC,"That's a tough one. Both the YT-1300 and the YT-2400 ships are really good, even by themselves. The Firespray is good, but not as good. The TIE Interceptor is really good with the right upgrades, but those come in Imperial Aces and the StarViper. The TIE Advanced is lackluster, but will be getting a much needed buff in the upcoming $100 Epic Imperial ship. The Y-Wing is tough, but doesn't have much of a punch without the BTL-A4 title. You could also throw an Ion Turret on it to try to stun ships, but that generally requires more than one Ion Turret to reliably do. The A-Wing is also good, but also lacks the punch of other ships.  TL;DR: Imperials are gonna get crushed.  Edit - You do have one copy of PTL from the A-Wing. Throw that on Soontir Fel with the Stealth Device from the Firespray and you'll have some form of balancing factor. Takes some practice to use, however."
XWingTMG,39rtd7,TyrantNZ,3,Sun Jun 14 03:23:19 2015 UTC,I prefer Hull Upgrade on Soontir Fel over Stealth Device. It's more reliable and it lets him take an extra hit from Vader crew.
XWingTMG,39rtd7,The_Recreator,3,Sun Jun 14 03:25:40 2015 UTC,"The way I look at it is this - if my stealth device saves damage from me once, it has already paid off as the hull upgrade. Very rarely does it ever happen on Soontir that the stealth device craps out on the first round of combat, unless he's in a bad position facing multiple shots (which would be the player's own fault anyway).  I also think hull upgrade and stealth device can have different affects on your opponent's mentality.  This can vary, but the way it works out for me is if Soontir has a hull upgrade, then he's more likely to be attacked ASAP to work on that hull. Stealth device might seem like a pain to try and hit through, especially with Soontir's allies around, so maybe taking him on later will be easier.  EDIT: It can vary in the sense that stealth device may be treated the same way as hull upgrade in this example, too. If you have more ships to focus shots on Soontir, then maybe you try to punch through early with more chances."
XWingTMG,39rtd7,wafer_thin,3,Sun Jun 14 04:31:31 2015 UTC,"In my view if you're truly worried about Vader crew Shield Upgrade is probably the way to go, but that's at the cost of another point.   In games where I have Soontir and vs a Doom shuttle it's easy enough to arc dodge I find. However against a Deci-Vader you just have to burn that thing down before it gets off too many shots."
XWingTMG,39rtd7,The_Recreator,3,Sun Jun 14 03:31:43 2015 UTC,"Agreed, Shield Upgrade is the way to go if you can squeeze in the points. I just find that at 3 points, Hull Upgrade does more for me than Stealth Device. Evade dice are fickle, and you should never trust them."
XWingTMG,39rtd7,YellowRex,2,Sun Jun 14 03:51:54 2015 UTC,"Hull Upgrade is also preferred against Feedback Array, which is a common arc dodger counter on scum Z-95s and IG-88s.  I like the guaranteed hull point over the untrustworthy green die."
XWingTMG,39rtd7,WhiskeyReckless,2,Mon Jun 15 15:24:39 2015 UTC,"Pretty much depends on how likely you are to be facing Vader. In general I believe SD to be the superior choice which has perhaps fallen a little bit out of favor in the competitive setting due to Vader.   It will be interesting to see if any of the Wave 7 ordinance will have any ""You are considered hit, even if you suffered no damage"" effects. I predict with that with the release of the Raider and Emperor crew SD's in general will get even more play since he can make SD's last a little longer with his ability. And Vader in the Tie Advanced will be seeing more play, but I digress.  Hull Upgrade - Do you play a lot of games where it comes down to a single HP point to win or lose? Do you plan on facing Vader? SD gives you more chances to evade damage, an extra hull lets you take one more.  Shield Upgrade - Same question apply as above, but do you have an extra point sitting around in your list you don't need?  Stealth Device - Are you on good terms with the Dice Gods? Adding an extra one may give you great benefit or none at all. The ultimate YMMV option and my favorite.   Targeting Computer - Is Vessery flying in your squad? Do you find that every time you pick up green dice a bright light shines from the sky? Are you able to read your opponents so well it seem like you might as well be setting their dial for them? Are you playing against someone that has never played before?"
XWingTMG,39rtd7,VanderLegion,3,Sun Jun 14 04:01:31 2015 UTC,"Do you play a lot of games where it comes down to a single HP point to win or lose?   The better question is do you usually take exactly enough damage to kill you when you die.  If you're taking 1 more damage than you have health remaining without the hull ugprade, the extra 1 health won't help you at all.  If it's vader killing you, then that's a different story of course."
XWingTMG,39rtd7,beer_demon,1 point,Sun Jun 14 06:16:53 2015 UTC,"Depends also on how you play him.  If you flank a lot and have another heavy hitter then yes the targeting computer can be what can make the difference, but if you charge in a bit more you might want something more defensive to last that one round more to take out that opponent.  Personally the stealth device has good odds and can make the opponent waste more resources on shooting at Soontir."
XWingTMG,39rtd7,Norix596,1 point,Sun Jun 14 04:32:20 2015 UTC,It's probably not optimal but I always enjoy Targeting computers on Interceptors especially Soontir
XWingTMG,39rtd7,MysteriousRacer_X,1 point,Sun Jun 14 05:55:22 2015 UTC,"I go targeting computer all day. Several times a day, I find myself with an action to spare, and getting that range 1 shot with TL and focus is amazing.  Stealth device is the oy other mod really worth mentioning in my opinion. 4 dice ia nice, but Soontir's ability to stay alive has a lot more to do with boosting and barrel rolling at PS 9 than his green dice."
XWingTMG,39rtd7,asmeus,1 point,Sun Jun 14 13:30:11 2015 UTC,"Last tournament in very non-competitive atmosphere flew Soontir with Howlrunner + TIE Swarm. Soontir had Targetting Computer.   Competitive wise Hull/SD/Shield might be better, but fly casual style, nothing beats exploding after delivering several 3-4 dice attacks with TL + Focus."
XWingTMG,39rtd7,Waramo,1 point,Sun Jun 14 20:17:22 2015 UTC,"I would take stealth device: If you evade one attack its cost efficent, two even more. Its works great with a turtle (Focus, evade + ""stress focus"")  Shield only its the +1 point worth if you get a crit in it. Hull... never allways stealth > hull. TC, if you know you can protect your sontir realy well. But for a tornement, nope, you get to many Dash/Han/RAC"

XWingTMG,39pc4j,Indoctrinator,2,Sat Jun 13 21:30:54 2015 UTC,I've got a billion questions because I want to do this with several TIE/LN and TIE/x1 and run an all 181st painted squad (I'm going to pretend that the non-TIE/IN fighters are temporary spares and replacements for ones destroyed in combat).  Did you use an airbrush or paintbrush?  What brand of paint and color did you go with? Could you post a pic with both this model and the factory painted TIE/IN if you have one (because from the pics this looks nearly spot on to the factory painted one)?  Did you use tape to get the lines straight?  Any tips or tricks you used to get the detailing right or stuff you would do next time?
XWingTMG,39pc4j,codyryan17,2,Sun Jun 14 03:22:12 2015 UTC,"I used brushes as my airbrush compressor is still on the fritz. I primarily only use Vallejo, just too convenient with their dropper bottles, and their range of colors is phenomenal. I'll try to snap some side by sides for you later today. As far as taping goes I have mixed feelings about it. On this project I opted not to use tape, the reason is the solar paneling isn't a surface I could stop bleeds from running under the tape with. My order of operations was paint the frame then the stripe then the solar paneling. This allowed me to thin the line back. This model is not finished but I wanted feedback before I kept going. When he and his wing man are finished the will be posted again."

I love a dark background, so most of the space mats are great.    There are some that provide a sticky sort of surface texture, so the minis don't get bumped and moved accidentally.  They are a little more expensive, but not by much. I kinda wish I had one since the normal material for most of them is very slippery."

XWingTMG,39r1ap,Scojo91,1 point,Sat Jun 13 23:50:16 2015 UTC,"I would suggest switching Weapons Engineer with Stealth Device on Fel.  Likely what will happen is when you spend a target lock, you will have to reapply it to the same ship and some rounds if you do kill one of the enemies, the next target locked ship may not be the best shot.  Putting stealth device on Fel would give more bang for points, me thinks.  Here's another list I can build from your stuff that I like as well :) http://geordanr.github.io/xwing/?f=Galactic%20Empire&d=v3!s!39:23,-1,-1,-1:-1:4:;13::-1:-1:;16::-1:-1:;10::-1:-1:;10::-1:-1:  Fly the TIEs to block and line up shots with Trelix :D"

Personally, I like to run gunner, but tactician, rebel captive and recon specialist are all competing for Intel agent's spot. It comes down to personal choice and play style, but I'd suggesting something better than an Intel agent.  Spending the one point to upgrade to an obsidian seems mostly pointless. Upgrading the targeting computer to a stealth device or hull upgrade would be a lot stronger buy."

XWingTMG,39qha5,IrateApe,2,Sat Jun 13 19:34:19 2015 UTC,Might want to pick up a YT-2400. Most builds I've seen with Corran has been a Dash build.
XWingTMG,39qha5,kkentium,2,Sat Jun 13 20:56:05 2015 UTC,"Corran and a turret ship is one of the primary meta builds right now.  Chewie... Waves hand will do fine.

XWingTMG,39qha5,KTreu42,2,Sat Jun 13 22:28:12 2015 UTC,"I just flew Chewie and Corran in a small local tournament today. Only 3 other people showed up but everyone else flew some variant of a b-wing mini swarm. Seriously...3 matches and I are 11 b-wings.

XWingTMG,39pxm5,EdgeOfDreams,3,Sat Jun 13 16:43:00 2015 UTC,"You don't need much more synergy WITH N'dru since he's gonna be off on his own.  Just take a threatening large ship and escort that will draw most of the enemy so N'Dru can solo whoever chases him, or freely flank around and get great positioning.  I've flown him with Boba and Kavil, both of whom are 4-dice throwers with good dice modifiers if you play them right.  I think Boba or the Bossk ship with a third decent ship will work well."
XWingTMG,39pxm5,KTreu42,2,Sat Jun 13 17:17:05 2015 UTC,Exactly.  The rest of the points need to go towards a solid fleet that can finish the job once this one-shot-wonder fires his missile.

XWingTMG,39r5c1,howieloader,2,Sat Jun 13 23:11:18 2015 UTC,I have many a super glued model w no discernible difference between those and fresh out the box models.  Just be careful and clean as w all glue jobs and it should be fine.
XWingTMG,39r5c1,PoisonRamune,2,Sat Jun 13 23:23:04 2015 UTC,"So, I'm guessing when it falls off or I break it off I want to maybe take a box cutter to any remaing flashing that might be on there, or no???"
XWingTMG,39r5c1,yodamann,2,Sat Jun 13 23:26:49 2015 UTC,"I had a similar break occur (a base fell off the Falcon and onto my X-wing) and I fixed it by first finishing the job then gluing. I used a drop, and it worked fine. I didn't do any extra cutting; that seems like a good way to get an uneven cannon"
XWingTMG,39r5c1,PoisonRamune,2,Sun Jun 14 01:54:36 2015 UTC,I've never had to but I do use less glue than I think I need and it seems to keep everything fine.  But you could give the excess glue a little cutting/flicking off
XWingTMG,39r5c1,SocrLd87,2,Sun Jun 14 18:18:56 2015 UTC,"Similar happened with my friends x wing. We messaged ff for a new one, with a picture. Busted it off and painted battle damage to make it his Biggs."
XWingTMG,39r5c1,JohnDeScone,2,Sat Jun 13 23:52:33 2015 UTC,"I accidentally slapped one of my x-wings and a gun fell off. I thought it would be a pain to fix but it wasn't. I just super glued the gun back on and now I can't even tell which one I broke. I didn't file or cut down anything, I just glued it back."
XWingTMG,39r5c1,Cintesis,2,Sun Jun 14 00:54:18 2015 UTC,"That's a tough break. (See what I did there?) I'd recommend pinning it, but I think the barrel of the laser is too thin for anything. You can superglue it back on (plastic cement won't work because it's a resin) but it's going to be a persistent problem, unfortunately."
XWingTMG,39r5c1,DangerFord,2,Sun Jun 14 01:15:34 2015 UTC,Read the directions on whichever kind of glue you get. The trick is to not use an excess amount and to wait long enough for the glue to dry just slightly. That way the piece will firmly stick to the ship and you shouldn't have to hold it at all. Some sanding or filing down might be a good idea if there is some plastic residue.
XWingTMG,39r5c1,Scojo91,2,Sun Jun 14 01:20:00 2015 UTC,"I would get a paper clip, put a dab of superglue on the tip of one end, then use that to transfer the glue to the gun and glue it back. This way, you avoid using too much glue"
XWingTMG,39r5c1,Glucose98,2,Sun Jun 14 01:51:22 2015 UTC,"Yes.  Break it off and super glue it back on.  I definitely broke off that exact same cannon in the first minute of playing my X-wing set :)  Was sad, but the glue works really well.  I recommend picking up a Loctite bottle from Home Depot.  After gluing it back on, hold it for a little bit, and then set the Xwing on the table so it points upward, so the cannon doesn't try to dip downward as the glue dries."

It just seems like the list is really awesome. 3 green dice on each one. With advanced sensor boost into a green bank, they're absolutely amazing arc dodgers. The bank can even be an S-Loop, making facing adjustments fairly easy to accomplish. Then on offense they've got the HLC goodness. It just seems like they're absolutely amazingly difficult to take down and hard hitting to boot.  So, what's the weakness of this sort of list? Stress? Other arc dodgers? Fat turrets?

The ship itself is a hardened assault craft designed for prisoner transport and high intensity engagement. It's a widely used vessel in Star Wars canon, we just only ever see one of its pilots in the series.   As for me I really enjoy loading up two Mandalorian Mercenaries (Scum PS5 Firespray) with Veteran Instincts and Tactician. Then I roll around making 'choo choo' sounds while I steamroll everything that's not Soontir Fel."
XWingTMG,39q5ew,Ryddari,1 point,Sat Jun 13 19:02:34 2015 UTC,I never thought of that. So you get to use Tactician for both arcs? Now I'm gonna have to think of a Firespray control list with the new ordnance coming out.  The Firespray is now my favorite ship.
XWingTMG,39q5ew,Ryddari,3,Sat Jun 13 20:28:58 2015 UTC,Tactician does indeed apply for both arcs. The only restriction is Range 2 (which is a little easier to achieve with a big base). For the other 24 points in the list I use two little Binayre Pirates for jamming up formations.

XWingTMG,39q5ew,KTreu42,2,Sat Jun 13 22:23:29 2015 UTC,"The Gat-12 skipray blastboat would be a good addition to x-wing. For starters, it's big, but not too big. About twice the length of a x-wing. Also, it could technically be used by any faction. Originally designed for the empire, they found their way into the open market and are used by both pirates, and apparently the rebels as well. If I'm not mistaken, Leia used one in one of the comics.  However, there's not real consistent portrayal of the ship, they usually come in three different styles, round, square and angular. Personally, I like the angular style the best, the round style looks too blimpy and the square version isn't as striking as the angular design. Here's to hoping though, they are making a k-wing, so maybe."
XWingTMG,39p9il,kertofer,2,Sat Jun 13 12:40:09 2015 UTC,"'Blocking' in the way you ask means to anticipate a clear spot on the table with one of your ships to force your opponent's ship to stop before completing it's movement. You can use this common strategy with low ability pilots to difficult movement of the higher ones.  And yes, you are able to target ships that are 'physically' one behind the other if their are within range."
XWingTMG,39p9il,ismyreddit,1 point,Sat Jun 13 12:58:56 2015 UTC,"Does a defending ship behind another ship get a defense die bonus? Or does that just apply to obstacles?   And it's always closest point to point, right? Even if that forces an obstacle to obstruct the shot?"
XWingTMG,39p9il,ClearChocobo,2,Sat Jun 13 17:47:04 2015 UTC,"No, it only applies to obstacles.  It's closest point on attackers base within weapon's arc to closest point on defender's base. If the closest point goes through an obstacle, the shot is obstructed even if you can draw a clear line past the obstacle from longer distance points on the two bases."
XWingTMG,39p9il,Scojo91,1 point,Sat Jun 13 18:01:49 2015 UTC,"As of now, attacks are obstructed by obstacles, large ships that are equipped with the Tactical Jammer modification, and huge ships. Small ships do not obstruct attacks. It's closest point to closest point (but still in arc). If the ships are perfectly parallel, the attacker chooses the line of fire.  Say there are two enemy Firesprays across from each other and parallel with an asteroid between them. The attacker chooses if the line of fire is obstructed or not."
XWingTMG,39p9il,mahthyoo,1 point,Sat Jun 13 18:15:07 2015 UTC,"Blocking is the act of using low pilot skill ships to move into where higher pilot skill ships are about to move thus ""blocking"" them and preventing them from taking actions.  You can target any ship in your firing arc within range 1-3."
XWingTMG,39p9il,Drowmonk,1 point,Sat Jun 13 12:57:33 2015 UTC,"Ok cool, thanks guys.  Just to make sure I'm understanding, if I drop a Tie a couple of base lengths ahead of an X-Wing and he reveals a forward 2 for example, then he would land on my ship and be forced to back off of it.  This is an example of blocking?  Are there any other repercussions when this happens?"
XWingTMG,39p9il,DangerFord,2,Sat Jun 13 13:39:06 2015 UTC,No repercussions for the tie except you can't shoot a ship that you're touching. The x-wing does not get to take any actions and cannot shoot the tie. This is a good strategy for a flanking ship to come in and do some serious damage to a naked x-wing.
XWingTMG,39p9il,AgustB,1 point,Sat Jun 13 13:51:08 2015 UTC,This is also referred to as a bump. In this case you'd be intentionally placing your TIE so the x-wing 'bumps'.

It's only once per game, but it averages more than 6 damage in one blast against a Decimator, and you've still got a fairly functional Z-95 flying around afterwards."

XWingTMG,39l8ze,PCGamerPirate,7,Fri Jun 12 14:51:13 2015 UTC,"This is a tricky one because we have so few upgrade options for these ships. Even putting a Heavy Scyk title on them drives the cost up so much it becomes hard to swarm them, which is really what you want to do with a ship with so low health.  One option is to consider encouraging the glass-cannon approach over the swarm:  Beissa  PS6. 17pts. No EPT.  When a friendly ship at range 1-2 is attacking with a secondary weapon, immediately after rolling attack dice, you may assign that ship a focus token.  Another would be to embrace the disposable swarm concept:  Hotwired Cross-Charge  Modification. M3-A Interceptor only. 1pt  When you perform an attack, you may suffer one damage to roll an extra attack die. If this damage would destroy this ship, destroy the ship AFTER performing the attack."
XWingTMG,39l8ze,gammon9,6,Fri Jun 12 16:03:12 2015 UTC,"Bilia Olphen is certainly capable of making her Interceptor last a long time, especially when she can either modify her ship with Kinetic Shielding (an upgrade that Lae'tin Ashera likes too) or upgrade it to a Scyk Type II."

XWingTMG,39l8ze,antigrapist,3,Fri Jun 12 15:09:55 2015 UTC,"I think the PS is going to depend on where you want to price this ability and on what sort of role you want it to fill. The cheaper you make it (and thus lower PS) the more it can function as a support ship for maybe an aggressor and/or starviper elite sort of build, where your opponent can't target Typhoid without letting a healthy ace make it to the late game. PS4 also pigeonholes you into costing T at 16-17 points.  Higher PS/higher price will lend Typhoid to more of a swarm leader role where you have to bring multiple low PS ships with mediocre dials to get some real value. If you want this sort of ship, I think letting Typhoid's ability not affect himself is a benefit because now T can take rebel captive stress and clear it easily.   I'd change the ability to make it trigger at the start of the planning phase. That way both players knows for sure which ships can take normally red maneuvers while stressed. This would make Typhoid squads easier to fly, but would prevent shenanigans with T getting killed with low PS prox mines or T getting blocked and kept from move into R1 of a high PS ship.   This is a really great ability. It works really well in Scum because no scum ships have the dial to hugely benefit from this vs b-wings, defenders or even the shuttle."

XWingTMG,39l8ze,scuff,1 point,Fri Jun 12 15:28:14 2015 UTC,The way it's worded right now it affects your opponents ships as well.  Denying opponents a green is possibly more interesting (and more powerful.

PS 7 still leaves him vulnerable to higher PS opponents who can end up forcing him to spend those tokens defensively before he gets to use them offensively. Veteran Instincts would combat that problem somewhat, but then he's only getting one token. Scum also doesn't have a lot of good options for token-passing as far as I can remember."

There is no real upgrade that gives the ability to barrel roll except the EPT expert handling, so it could be a nice unique thing like they seem to like doing for each ship.  Make it 2-3 pts and then you can get a base x wing with generic R2 for 24-25 pts which would imo put it easily in contention with the B wing for playability since the B wing is what kind of unbalanced the x wing."

XWingTMG,39lko0,Theepum7,1 point,Fri Jun 12 17:33:40 2015 UTC,Proton rockets are considered an attack. The card states that you add your ship's agility to the number of attack dice rolled (to a maximum of 3 extra dice). This does not negate extra dice from other bonuses. It just clarifies that proton rockets can only recieve +3 attack dice specifically from agility. It most certainly does work.

The bit I was getting caught up on was ""you may roll additional dice ... to a maximum of 3 additional dice"".   As its own sentence - ignoring the specification of agility - it seems to indicate that there was an absolute ceiling on the attack dice.

High PS lists are tougher than lower ones, but I my plan is to block with the shuttle and Reg (Alpha Squadron guy, he's a pretty cool cat so got his own name) and then remove people with Echo. I have an alternative with Whisper and Backstabber where the shuttle isn't so heavy.   My basic plan is to distract with the overloaded shuttle for points and not use Vader until they realise that the need to focus Echo. If someone has a Fel/high PS Phantom hunter, I play near to the board edge - making it harder for Echo to be flanked by him - and unload with as much as possible at him. The 0 move on the Shuttle can be very good for surprise blocking - I know some people prefer Advanced Sensors so you can act and do it, throwing on a Fleet Officer perhaps, but I prefer it as more of a blunt instructment."
XWingTMG,39kx08,Nomnomnicon,1 point,Fri Jun 12 15:25:58 2015 UTC,"I played this squad last night:  OGP + Vader Sigma Squad (phantom) + Stygian device     RAC + Swarm Tactics     99 pts     I went up against an Assault Missile packing N'Dru, Guri, and Kath.  I setup the shuttle in the Middle, and RAC and phantom on right edge.  Other player put N'Dru on the corner away from RAC + Phantom.  Kath and Guri were right across from them.    The shuttle crept ahead and he misjudged a movement and let Vader get in a shot on N'Dru without being able to return fire.  He went for a target lock instead of focus and blanked his defense dice.  Shuttle had three hits. Vader'd him and he was done.  Guri and Kath came in after that and unloaded a facefull of dice into the shuttle at range 1. and scored 6 hits between them.  Shuttle returned the favor with another 3 hits + Vader  on Guri.  Vader killed the shuttle but left Guri with only 1 hull remaining.  From there the Phantom and Admiral Cheerios just mopped up.  Never took a single hit on the Decimator.    I dig the list.  It's good against tanky stuff.  It's good against agile stuff.  It makes the other player take some hard choices on what to attack.  Meanwhile that 4 dice Phantom is creeping in there for some brutal shots and the Admiral is parked nearby with suppressing fire and handing out crits like they are candy."

A TIE Bomber could technically run 4 Ion Pulse Missiles using Extra Munitions. Add munitions failsafe and you get to exactly 25 points on a scimitar. That actually doesn't sound terrible but what do you do when you've fired all the IPMs from a ship? I guess you'd have four of these bombers, possibly. You could run one as Jonus and still have room for some kind of TIE (including Howlrunner, humorously enough). Alternatively, you could run three bombers with upgrades and Jonus just with an EPT (and probably Squad Leader).  If any of the new bombs make sense for control, then maybe they'd show up in some amount.  Punisher and K-Wing might see some work in some control lists. It's hard to say without the full spoiler but they don't really have a lot of room for munitions compared to a Bomber.  Y-Wing is still better off running turrets."

Personally, I'd be inclined to drop the two swarm tactics and go for predator on vader and a stronger initiative bid, but I can see both having their uses. However, I'm in love with the idea of vader next to howlrunner using predator. Essentially gets a free target lock with every attack, so you're almost always looking at at least 2 hits and a crit.

I feel like newbies ordering upgrades off a menu, so to speak, seems to work better than people flipping through a big stack of upgrades trying to decide what they want.    For people who have absolutely no idea what they want, I'll ask them to pick a ship and I'll toss out half a dozen potential upgrades and give brief info as to the differences between the different 'good' choices for them.  That requires a fairly good off-hand understanding of which ships and upgrades are good together, but it's nice to be able to let a newbie get a good setup while still feeling like it's their setup and not just some pre-made setup that they're using."

I copy-pasted the text from the wiki, to save myself re-typing it all, and edited some card texts to keep the same base meaning but fit better into the space.  That requires some work to do, but it's really not that bad to do, especially if you do a few at a time and take breaks.  ATM it's set up to fit to one double-sided page, but I expect it'll end up needing to expand as my collection grows.

XWingTMG,39i2jj,rsixidor,9,Thu Jun 11 21:31:25 2015 UTC,"In the world of the Star Wars movies and books, bombs really aren't for taking down big ships. They're either for dropping on stationary targets such as planet-side fortifications (not represented in the X-Wing game) or for creating a huge explosion to hopefully catch a small, maneuverable ship in the blast area. The real tool for taking down big, heavy ships is torpedoes, and sometimes missiles if you have enough of them.  So, I think bombs in the game match up with that lore pretty well. The TIE Bomber, TIE Punisher, and K-Wing all have Torpedo and Missile slots to cover that role of ordnance that can hit hard against a big fat ship.  Actually, what I'd love to see as a torpedo or missile is something that is specifically designed in game mechanics to deal a ton of damage to high-HP, low-agility ships. Maybe it could deal extra damage or roll a lot of attack dice (6, perhaps?), but the target gets to double its number of agility dice."

An alternative would be to perhaps start at 6 attack but lose 1 attack die per agility on th etarget (so basically the opposite of prockets).  Against a decimator it could be devastating with 6 attack dice, against an a-wing or an interceptor it's only 3v3 so not so scary."

XWingTMG,39jayy,BurnerotheBlackwater,2,Fri Jun 12 03:00:20 2015 UTC,"Dude, love it.  Break the Fel mould, keep Jax.  advice (read: opinions) to follow:  I really like the Jax Swarm, but I take it one of two different ways  The list is a bit of an Anvil (swarm) and Flanker (Jax) situation, where it is missing a great big bludgeoning Hammer.  So you need to make your Anvil harder (bigger) or sharper (hit back better).  No matter what, I would say that Jax doesn't need the targeting computer.  He is going to be focus+evading every turn and wont have time for TL - He isn't as inherently survivable as Soontir is, and you have to fly him differently to capitalize on his ability.  This tends to come at the expense of modified attack dice, if he gets a shot at all given all the big turrets around, I'll take a more defensible move over a shot 4 times out 5.  He is a passive-aggressive threat, your opponents should not worry about being shot by Jax like with Soontir; Jax is there to make the swarm hit harder, and the enemy to hit back softer (and because blaster turret warthogs do not deserve to shoot - for their arrogance).  So that leave us, with ""do you want a bigger swarm, or a swarm that shoots first and mitigates abilities like predator?""  One way is to drop targeting computer, and downgrade the swarm to Academy Pilots to allow for one additional TIE.  With Howl around, that often nets 1 additional landed hit per round, and 3 more hull points to chew through.  This effectively replaces the lost offensive from Jax, and really, the only benefit of Obs over AP is shooting before Bs, and reduced predator effect.   Note about Predator: every time your opponent shoots your AP to get 2 re-rolls via predator, that's another round he isn't shooting Howl or Jax.   But getting shot sucks, Let's knock an enemy ship out first.   The second way I take this list is to drop the targeting comp, swap determination for swarm tactics, and up two of the Obs to Black squadron with swarm tactics.  The whole list shoots at 8, ideally knocking some high value threat down before it shoots back, but it is a bit cumbersome to fly, you loose the added 3 hp, and it is meaningless against Fel, and other high PS threats (but PS 8 with a 99pt initiative bid ain't bad).  Lastly, divide and conquer, both your Anvil and your Flanker move fast, force the opponent to choose one to attack at deployment and use your speed in the first 2 turns to close up Jax and the swarm and orchestrate your attack.   Ideally they engage the swarm, in which case Jax can flank in and hang out in the back ranks of the enemy's formation, triggering his ability.  If your opponent does not have a ship over PS 7, you can keep Jax out of the enemy's lanes, but if your opponent has someone like Soontir, or another high PS threat, likely they will target your lone squint and you will need turtle up with Jax - Hard.  Then swing in with the full swarm, which hits like a truck when it T-Bones the enemy.  In this case, keep lanes open to bring your swarm over, and make them pay for going after Jax.    This last option can really hurt you more though, and keeping Jax safe here is paramount because if he`s gone, particularly against an enemy that was able to get the drop on Carnor Jax, all you're left with is a 4 TIE swarm, which in and of itself is not a scary opponent.    Sorry for the wall of text, I'm not at work today so I don't know what to do with my hands..."

XWingTMG,39g3bm,Holmelunden,3,Thu Jun 11 15:36:00 2015 UTC,X-Wings are mostly fine.  Give them a free title that reduce the cost of an equipped Astromech with 1 point.
XWingTMG,39g3bm,MrSunol,2,Thu Jun 11 14:47:17 2015 UTC,"To go along with that theme, they would most likely release another astromech which is x-wing only (like they did with the tie advanced upgrade). One that is reasonably powerful but not stupid, like ""Whenever another friendly ship at range 1 is destroyed you may gain a [INSERT NAME] token. Whenever you roll dice, you may spend that token to change all blanks to focuses""  Now that I have come up with it, I actually really like the idea. You could run a 4x x-wing list with it pretty decently. If it costed 2 points, then you could go 3x rookies with it and bigs with r2d2."
XWingTMG,39g3bm,skyshroudace,1 point,Thu Jun 11 15:37:35 2015 UTC,That is WAY too cheap for zero points. With munitions fail safe  this would make X-wings the go to. X-wing (21) + Munitions Failsafe (1) + Flechette Torps (2) + R3-A2 (2) = 26 points and Can dish out 2 attacks and 3 stress in 1 turn. You can also do this with R7-T1 and get target locks and closer to your target for Adv Proton Torps. Wedge with these would be able to just hammer someone down really fast.
XWingTMG,39g3bm,skyshroudace,2,Thu Jun 11 14:43:30 2015 UTC,"The one I've been toying with to help out the X-wing is: Red Squadron (X-wing only, -3 pts) To equip this you must have both a uniquely named Pilot and Astromech.

XWingTMG,39g3bm,leewardstyle,1 point,Thu Jun 11 20:04:58 2015 UTC,"It's an interesting idea, but perhaps it should cost 1 point. Just depends on if you want to see 4x Rookie + Title + Proton Torps. Or have a minimum PS requirement.  An alternative would be ""When you spend your Target Lock, assign yourself 1 focus token.""  What really sucks with Torps is that it spends the TL, so your attack is (typically) unmodified. I'd rather have a regular 3 die attack + TL and save 4 points.  But, if you gain a Focus, now you can fire the torps and still modify the attack (and I know, torps let you change one eyeball already, but with 4 dice, multiple eyes aren't that rare).  Also, it'd be useful without munitions. You can effectively TL+Focus on every attack (sort of like Agromech, but actually much stronger), or TL and get a free defensive Focus (great if you're running R5-P9, or R7).  I'd probably price mine at 1-2, either the same or cheaper than the Agromech (cheaper to recognize that the X-Wing is overpriced)."

XWingTMG,39g3bm,leewardstyle,3,Thu Jun 11 19:22:13 2015 UTC,Are you confusing x-wings with Z-95s? The cheapest x-wing in the game is 21 points so the most you could feasibly fit into a list with ordnance is maybe 4.
XWingTMG,39g3bm,KTreu42,1 point,Thu Jun 11 17:36:25 2015 UTC,"I'm not talking about an alpha strike across a squadron, I'm talking about a single ship.  So you're saying Cluster Missiles = alpha strike because it's two 3-dice attacks.  This would allow for a 3-dice attack / 4 dice attack at range three, which clusters cannot do.  It would also allow for a 4-dice attack / 5-dice attack at range one, which the clusters cannot do.  But yes, 6 z-95s w/ clusters has a bigger one-time alpha strike as a squadron than these x-wings."
XWingTMG,39g3bm,pangoleena,2,Thu Jun 11 16:42:54 2015 UTC,"It's possible I'm in the wrong, but I've never heard Alpha-strike used to describe the attack capabilities of (1) ship.

XWingTMG,39g3bm,dlcnate1,3,Thu Jun 11 16:58:29 2015 UTC,"""An ""alpha strike"" is when a BattleMech attacks with all of its weapons at the same time. While extremely powerful, it dramatically raises the 'Mech's heat level, and after several successive alpha strikes most 'Mechs will shut down from overheating.""  That's what folks are referring to with the term. From MechWarrior games. Connotes a multi-payload attack from a single unit."
XWingTMG,39g3bm,dlcnate1,1 point,Thu Jun 11 17:36:54 2015 UTC,"It depends on the game and context. No technical term has a generic fundamental meaning.  We used alpha-strike a lot in Star Fleet Battles to describe a single ship's maximum damage output. For example, Federation photon torpeodoes take at least two turns to load, and can't be used every turn. Therefore the damage output on 'photon turns' is higher than on turns without them. ""Federation cruiser alpha strike"" was therefore the damage output on a photon turn.  Battletech used the term the same way. When you fire a weapon, your mech overheats. Mechs generally carried more weapons than they had heatsinks to cool: either because the weapons had different ranges and would not normally be fired together, or because they were trying to build 'one shot wonders'. Hence a mech could fire a whole load more stuff than was safe, at the cost of having to spend the next few turns with thermal damage effects and operating at lower efficiency."

This is usually considered a risky tactic, as if the attacker fails to gain a decisive advantage, it can leave the attacker's units overextended and vulnerable to counter-attack.

Now piloting and tactical skills can minimize\maximize your odds, but it still boils down to how the dice fall on the table.

XWingTMG,39ggul,Thisisthesea,7,Thu Jun 11 17:17:29 2015 UTC,"As I started to improve, I saw that dice were becoming more of a ""factor"" and less of a decider of matches. In the past 30 days, my record stands at 36/3, including regionals. Bad dice happen but, they are only a ""factor"" to consider, definitely not the only factor.   It's easy to blame dice when the deciding moment comes down to a single roll, but the truth is, every result, decision, movement and element of both players lists eventually led up to that roll. That roll alone may have decided the ""final"" outcome, but you have incredible influence on how you reach that point or even allow that point in a match to exist.  When I am looking at my lists objectively, I try to assume that my opponent will always roll max hits and I will roll one evade for every three dice I throw. I take into account how long and when I can weather that damage and build my list, my battle plan and my rock selection with that in mind. Having a battle plan for each match up makes a significant difference.  When I started, I had a lot of trouble looking even one turn ahead after I set my dial and played turn by turn. Now, looking at what the enemy can do and what I can do, every move I make is looking several turns down the road and keeping my options open as I proceed.   When working out my battle plan, I use the dice roller to see how my expected shots will land on particular targets. My firing strategy for against a two dice ship is totally different than say, Fel or Whisper. Even Fel and Whisper I approach differently from each other and create different ideal firing ranges for them.   There is a lot that goes into it that has nothing to do with dice, but a good player still factors in the dice. How many blank outs can I survive? What do I need to do if my HLC only lands one shot on a B-wing? How do I prevent that ? How do I make sure gunner triggers when I want it to? When do I decide to hold my focus token or not take a predator reroll? When do I reroll a focus result even though I have a focus token?  It's a game with dice, but if that was all there was to it, we would see very different lists and HLC Scyks wouldn't be horrible."
XWingTMG,39ggul,PlayerNine,1 point,Thu Jun 11 18:54:29 2015 UTC,"I would say X-wing is close to poker in how much luck decides the outcome.

But almost every game I've played, maybe 95%+, I can point to at least one other reason a side lost."
XWingTMG,39ggul,PCGamerPirate,5,Thu Jun 11 19:03:31 2015 UTC,I can think of something like 5 games out of 300+ that I would have flown the exact same way and expected a win.  Position and list selection have so much more to do than the dice rolls.
XWingTMG,39fo6a,manninj2,8,Thu Jun 11 12:13:48 2015 UTC,Where's Tycho?   In an A-Wing unfortunately.
XWingTMG,39fo6a,gammon9,6,Thu Jun 11 15:13:15 2015 UTC,If only he didn't cost 30+ for a 2 attack ship...
XWingTMG,39fo6a,Lukor,6,Thu Jun 11 15:33:36 2015 UTC,"Autothrusters will probably give him a bit more survivability than a stealth device at 1point less. A: you don't lose auto thrusters when you do eventually get hit. And B: with Tycho's ability to take actions while stressed, he can take a focus token for one of the actions on PTL guarenteing at least 1 evade (if you roll all blanks). The A-wings manueverability makes it the perfect ship for attacking from the sides/back and autothrusters are much more difficult to punch through than a temporary extra die. Turret players can't stand autothrusters. I for one am a huge fan of A-wings and i'm happy to see there are others interested in this under-appreciated ship."
XWingTMG,39fo6a,Murdersaurus13,4,Thu Jun 11 13:50:06 2015 UTC,"Underappreciated ship?! I'm also pretty new to x-wing, but I have to say I LOVE the A-wing. It's probably my favorite of the rebel ships.   I'll still experimenting with Tycho and Jake as a flanking duo with some generic heavies to back them up (maybe a couple B-wings in formation). Alternatively, a couple generic A-wings with B-wing ace support is also a cool build (B-wings with HLC are a lot of fun, though point heavy)."

XWingTMG,39fo6a,KasztanekChaosu,3,Sat Jun 13 16:22:11 2015 UTC,"I love tycho at the moment. The unfortunate thing is that soontir is high on the meta at the moment, so if I run him I have to go with VI and PTL, so I don't get to do all the fun things like daredevil.  I find the attack of the A-wing to be a bit lack-luster for the points though. Putting a good tycho in your build is easily 30 points, so only getting 2 dice attack for that return isn't the best, however I do think he is balanced price-wise, just a shame when I fly him correctly and don't get hits because my red dice can't punch through 4 green."
XWingTMG,39fo6a,dlcnate1,1 point,Thu Jun 11 15:00:01 2015 UTC,"I like flying him as a pseudo-Soontir Fel with VI, PTL, Autothrusters and Proton Rockets (which is why I really, really hate the Chardaan Refit as a ""fix"" for the A-wing; it takes away the thing an A-wing needs the most, some offensive power). He sits at 35 points with that build, which is pricey but he can have some alpha strike capability with the 5 dice rockets before he goes to ""plink with 2 attack dice"" mode.  On a related note, I think Jake is as good as him if not sometimes better. He's ridiculously mobile, just like Soontir."
XWingTMG,39fo6a,Beevus,3,Fri Jun 12 13:04:32 2015 UTC,"Sadly, tycho is an xwing pilot who flew an a wing in one mission and is now pidgeonholed into it for a game, of course the awing shouldn't be so crappy in the first place"
XWingTMG,39fo6a,LiquidAether,3,Thu Jun 11 18:22:42 2015 UTC,"I often take him with daredevil, chaardan refit, ptl, experimental intrface, and a wing test pilot. This way he can evade boost and daredevil. I think an evade is worth more than autothrusters. It can also be a target lock if you feel safe."
XWingTMG,39fo6a,253_Hero,2,Fri Jun 12 03:45:54 2015 UTC,Yeah the 2 attack is very weak especially for his cost. That's why I target the weaker ships and play to wreak havoc /be a pest

Sometimes it's hard to survive early fire if you push head-first and Lock-On. Better to (defensive) Focus. Then Lock-On during the turn-a-bout (turrets still a problem). This is the safest time for all your paper-tigers to Lock-On.

XWingTMG,39h84q,cassarlex,2,Thu Jun 11 18:20:23 2015 UTC,"Just a couple of points.  APL are generally a bad point investment.  Especially on shuttles, as you are generally only get 1 possible bump out of them unless you are fighting against other shuttles or maybe hawks.    Next up is Expose without a way to get a second action in there to help your damage.  There are plenty of posts explaining the math behind why its just better to Target Lock and save the points and EPT slot.    That would give you 10 points to work with for other upgrades.  and you could go tons of different ways with it so what style of fight are you wanting to get with this list?"

XWingTMG,39ex8u,alemondemon,1 point,Thu Jun 11 07:38:48 2015 UTC,"X-wings are underrepresented in most metas, as they're overcosted and pretty much pointless outside of a couple of pilots. I mean, if you're flying a Rookie, why not free up a point and get a Blue Squadron B? Or a Gold Squadron Y with R5 Astro, Bomb Loadout and Seismics?  Outside of Wedge and Biggs, X-wings don't get much love, and I'm hoping a future expansion rectifies that. The Episode 7 wave will hopefully help a lot with that, since the trailer showed a new engine configuration on the X, which could lead to a new Aces pack.  To answer the OP, I've not been in tournaments for a while, but RAC+Echo was fairly prominent just after Wave 6, so I'd wager RAC+Soontir is the most popular build right now."

It was a pretty small tournament, I believe there were nine people. The winner flew an IG and a Firespray, but there was a pretty good variety. I saw:   Brobots A Decimator and Firespray Scum Y-Wing, two Z-95s, and Guri Vader, a pair of Interceptors (Alpha and Fel's wrath, I think), and two academy TIEs Three Firesprays Two B-Wings and a pair of A-Wings, one of which was Tycho A Moldy crow with an X-Wing and another couple of ships that I didn't see A pair of Alphas, Howlrunner, and three academy TIEs My build: Soontir Fel, Rexler, and an Academy TIE.   I only faced the Vader, brobots, and Scum Y-Wing lists, so I'll try to elaborate where I can remember.   Vader had cluster missiles and squad leader, Fel's Wrath, Alpha, and two Academy TIEs Brobots were IG-88B and IG-88C. Advanced sensors on both, maybe inertial dampeners, and Veteran Instincts on one? I'm not 100% sure.  The Y-Wing (Kavil, I think) with a blaster turret and an unhinged astromech; possibly other items. Guri with a tricked out Virago. Suhlak and a Black Sun soldier. Three Bounty hunter Firesprays   I'm not 100% sure about everyone's builds, but here's my build:   Fel with Push the Limit, Royal TIE, Stealth Device, and Autothrusters Rexler with Heavy Laser Cannon, Predator, Stealth Device, and Proton Rockets. Academy TIE   My basic strategy was putting Rexler in one corner and Fel and the Academy TIE in the other. Arc dodging and blocking with Fel and the Academy, and hitting them hard with the HLC. Against something big I'd try to get in close, focus, launch proton rockets and use Rexler's ability to turn any hits to crits. Of course, this was my first 100 point match with asteroids, so I didn't fly particularly well. I beat Vader and the Scum Y-wing list and I lost to Brobots and the bounty hunters. I made some serious mistakes flying against both of them, obstacles really threw me for a loop. That being said, Brobots in particular was super well run, and I doubt I would have ended up winning anyways. All in all, a good first tournament."

XWingTMG,39g2qs,Kozemp,4,Thu Jun 11 14:10:17 2015 UTC,"Definitely action economy.  Also good dice modifications, getting off a shot with TL+Focus, especially if you can modify your opponent's dice and reduce/change his results, can be devastating."
XWingTMG,39g2qs,mxzf,1 point,Thu Jun 11 14:42:26 2015 UTC,"If that's the case, why isn't Carnor Jax the best ship in the game?  (Not being sarcastic, legitimately asking.)"
XWingTMG,39g2qs,mxzf,1 point,Thu Jun 11 16:42:50 2015 UTC,"Well, he's definitely up there.  There's no single best ship in the game though, just like there's no single best card in a CCG.    Carnor is great, he denies actions, is agile, and hits hard.  But he also has drawbacks, he's somewhat fragile and he ONLY denies actions if he's right on top of the opponent.    Most people would typically consider Soontir Fel a superior Interceptor pilot in general though, because his action advantage is constant (two actions and a free focus almost every turn) instead of being conditional denial if you're at the right range and he has higher PS.   So Carnor Jax is good, but he's not the best ship because there's no single best ship and he does have significant disadvantages too."
XWingTMG,39g2qs,starslinger72,2,Thu Jun 11 16:48:50 2015 UTC,"Its 100% the higher base pilot skill.  There are to many ships that sit at PS 9 (natively or through VI) for Jax to really shine.  He really needs to take VI to push to PS 10 so he can arc dodge, but then cant also take PTL which he needs to arc dodge."
XWingTMG,39g2qs,ClearChocobo,2,Thu Jun 11 20:01:25 2015 UTC,So for the MTG fans in the audience: Carnor Jax is to Duress as Soontir Fel is to Dark Confident (or a one-sided Howling Mine).
XWingTMG,39g2qs,Enervata,3,Fri Jun 12 00:50:39 2015 UTC,"Coming from a deep MtG background there's not really a direct counterpart, but something that can be tracked as an incremental advantage over the period of the game is action denial / action economy.  Blocking a ship, or forcing a ship to take stress and lose an action is similar to discarding an opponents cards.  And using ships and pilots that can take 2-3 actions a turn is much like drawing extra cards.  The major difference with X-wing is that this ""action advantage"" tends to grant opportunities for that player.  If you can take advantage of them, you greatly increase your chances of victory.  However they don't last forever, and the opponent can swing the action advantage back over to his side if you don't plan carefully.  So unlike MtG, card advantage isn't really additive as much as it is in card games."
XWingTMG,39g2qs,rsixidor,2,Thu Jun 11 15:20:45 2015 UTC,Action Economy and Action Denial. That's what card advantage really gives you in TCGs/LCGs. The ability to take more actions.
XWingTMG,39g2qs,PoeGhost,2,Thu Jun 11 15:50:17 2015 UTC,"In 40k it's referred to as ""earning your points back.""  If a squad costs a certain amount of points and during the course of the game they kill an equal or greater amount of points, they've earned their points cost.  It becomes a little more obfuscated when you deal with force multiplier units as opposed to your traditional ded-killy units.  Whoops, I didn't understand what card advantage meant."
XWingTMG,39g2qs,KTreu42,2,Thu Jun 11 15:53:10 2015 UTC,"Based off what people are saying, I'm taking a stab at what you mean here... but yes, limiting opposing actions can be a major bonus especially against particular ships.  This includes blocking, stressing, or through pilot skills like Carnor, or Palob, who literally gets to steal evades or focus tokens (simultaneously gaining a ""free action"" in a way, and nullifying the opponent's action.  Palob's ability is probably the biggest swing in a single turn if that's what you're looking for.    Another way to look at it is Push The Limit.  Gets you 2 actions for your opponent's 1 on each ship that has it, and if you have an effective means to de-stressing each turn - good green maneuvers, Wingman, etc - it's basically a ""2-for-1"" as you say, with little downside.  It's not quite as effective if you have limited de-stress methods and your opponent can counter it by blocking or setting up by knowing where you will go."
XWingTMG,39g2qs,Stetto,1 point,Thu Jun 11 17:55:23 2015 UTC,"I think the direct equivalwnt would be a ""squad point advantage"" or ""margin of victory"".  Card advantage in CCG terms means that you traded some cards of yours against more cards of him.   In a lot of lists, it's almost inevitable to lose ships. Your opponent would have to do serious mistakes, or you'd have to fly impeccable, if he never gets a firing arc.  So from my point of view, often you want to make the opponent shoot at specific targets in your list and meanwhile simply try to destroy more expensive ships in the meantime.  E.g. Blue Squadron B-Wings and Doom Shuttles are all about destroying more squad points than you're losing."
XWingTMG,39g2qs,rlcode,1 point,Thu Jun 11 14:59:57 2015 UTC,"This. Totally this.   In fact, it's almost MORE important in X-wing than it is in CCGs--because ALL your ""cards"" are on the table at once. (Imagine a CCG where you didn't draw, but started with access to ALL your cards at once!)  So trading fewer squad points of yours for more of your opponents is vital. I love your B-wings and Doom shuttles examples, and this fits large ship builds as well: When a 50-something large ship can stick around longer while removing opponent's squad points from the board, it's a BIG deal.  Even in swarms, the idea is that your points are distributed so widely, that you're trading a first turn TIE for your opponent's more costly B-wing.   Squad Point advantage is definitely the equivalent of Card advantage, and that is validated by the fact that ""Marging of Victory"" has an impact. (Imagine if CCG's didn't just count wins and losses, but counted how many cards you and your opponent had left as part of your victory!)"

XWingTMG,39fa1b,skyshroudace,1 point,Thu Jun 11 15:33:17 2015 UTC,"This is a really nice build, I like the look of that.   My only concern is that you're going to have problems staying at range 2-3 and keeping Biggs within range 1 of his friends - The maneuverability of X-Wings and B-Wings is pretty mediocre.   You also have a lot of points invested in X-Wings, which are pretty fragile, even with the upgrades on Biggs."
XWingTMG,39fa1b,doodeman,1 point,Thu Jun 11 10:33:30 2015 UTC,"I'd probably take away Mango cannon and add something else like tactition. C3p0 gives you better defense after biggs dies or is out of r1. Jan ors can help give Biggs evades, and it gives Keyan an evade option. Since he already gets a focus fro his stress it is a good option.  It is just a preference for me, I don't like spending 4 points for a hit to crit upgrade. You do gain the lack of a r3 green dice for the opponent, but it is also useless at r1.  EDIT: If you take a 2 point crew member like tactition or Jan ors, you still have enough points for FCS, which gives you the free TL each turn, effectively gaining TL focus and evade each turn for keyan."
XWingTMG,39fa1b,MrSunol,1 point,Thu Jun 11 11:28:52 2015 UTC,"I know what you mean... My original list called for a HLC on Keyan and no squad leader on Wes. That is quite a bit more punch, but it also makes the choice of R2-F2 a bit worse on Biggs...  Im not a huge fan of Jan Ors because she provides an evade at the expense of focus, and statistically focus is better even on a 2 dice ship than an evade is. (i know variance and all that, but still, its way worse on a 3 dice ship)"
XWingTMG,39fa1b,T-Minus9,1 point,Thu Jun 11 17:54:51 2015 UTC,"I would take out Mango Cannon as well, and definitely give Wes R7 or if you can free the extra points, I would give him R2-D2.  R7 for 2 points lets him take a TL on the most pressing threat (makes VI a hugely helpful EPT), and force re-rolls, which will help after Biggs buys the farm, and R2-D2 usefulness is clear, but costs 4 points, which is harder to get.  My take on this list would be:   Wes: Squad Leader, R7 Astro (33) Biggs: R2-F2, Stealth Device (or hull upgrade) (31) Keyan Farlander: Opportunist, B-Wing/E2 Jan Ors (36)"

The issue is that you are going to proton yourself if you use genius, and in addition the lack of unhinged is reducing your movement effectiveness.  Kavil with an Autoblaster and engine is awesome (try him with opportunist for additional lulz), but I find that unhinged gives you a surprising reach across the board.  If you want to use bombs, then for 1 additional point you can get Emon - who you really want to have proton bomb(s).    I would suggest :  drop genius, take unhinged (-1) move proton to Emon. Drop Mandalorian, take Emon (-1) drop tactician (+2) .  Ideally, you'll want Intelligence Agent on Emon, but there is nowhere to get that point from.  (edit for clarity)"

If it were me, and I were trying to make an arc dodging kavil, I'd use Stay on Target with unhinged astromech + autoblaster and engine upgrade.  That way if your maneuver plus boost is going to put you where you want to be then you can do it, otherwise you can change your maneuver dial to keep yourself out of arc, then use your astromech to get rid of the stress next turn without being really predictable.  Maybe it would help us if you told us what kind of build you want to make? what is your goal?"

Can they manoeuvre in asteroids?  Is debris their thing?  Setting up the asteroids/debris to compliment your list has much more to do with the game than you would think.

XWingTMG,39bgdc,doodeman,2,Wed Jun 10 18:06:33 2015 UTC,"Consistency and redundancy is always good. Let's say you want to reliably shoot people...   Having a decent primary weapon is a good start, an attack value of 2 won't hurt much Having a turret with a decent attack value is better, now it's easier to land hits Having a turret on a ship that can target lock or focus increases your odds even more Now add on an upgrade like predator, expose or gunner and your odds got a little better again   Along the same lines, let's say you prefer speed over power...   A Tie Interceptor has a great dial for short range dog fighting with all those tight turns Another great quality of the interceptor is that it has both barrel rolls and boosts available right off the bat, giving you lots of maneuvering options. A different ship might have to buy an engine upgrade to be that nimble. Having a high pilot skill is also great for nimble ships. After all, if you move last you can best judge where to boost or barrel roll to get out of someone's arc. Moving last and shooting first are great advantages, sometimes worth buying veteran instincts for. Upgrades like push the limit can help a nimble ship maximize their strengths Another strength of nimble ships is a high evade value, compound that with cards like stealth device and you're maximizing another strength   It's usually hard to shore up a ship's weakness. The Hawk or a Tie Bomber will never be a nimble dog fighter. But maximizing your strengths provides a lot of consistency and redundancy in what you're trying to do.  Imagine running a Lambda class shuttle with a heavy laser cannon and a gunner. It's a naturally tough ship that now sinks 9 points into a big gun and a badass gunnery crew member. But with the Lambda's maneuvering dial you're unlikely to get a lot of targets in your sights. Making it a very unreliable warship.  Figure out what you want your ships to do and then maximize their potential for achieving success."

Then let the rocks shoot back after a few passes. 2 red hot dice on a rock you don't want to miss. Give it an evade value. Just fly your list and picture the movements of the enemies. Add some xwings or a falcon. Now you'd be practicing. Let the game flow through you as you dial in flanking shots  . I actually do this at least for a few minutes with every list I set on the table that I consider taking a friend on with. Feel the dice chances and learn what you want to do with the list.

Having only one list means you set up quickly (you can pre-assemble it), and you're forced to practice that list and get a feel for it over the course of the night.

Make Mistakes, but make sure you learn from them, whether it be an underused upgrade, wrong maneouver, or how other lists operate. The more you play the game, (all the ships/modes), the more you will understand how the game works. Knowing just 1 list, will pidgeon hole yourself, the more you know what everything can do, the better you will be at making DECISIONS in the game. Decisions are what the game is about, and knowing what the opponent can and cannot do, will make it easier for you to anticipate and ultimately improve."

XWingTMG,39c9so,BorisIHateReddit,1 point,Wed Jun 10 23:53:33 2015 UTC,"Yep.  Range one is tough to get for a PS1 ship. And I'm the type that loves to wait for focus+TL, so I either never get the shot I really want or, more likely, never get the shot at all. My Prototypes have their place in my lists, but they're always naked. With Chardaan Refit, I view the A-Wing's proton rockets as costing 5 points. The next time I use them, it will definitely be on Jake (Mr. F)"
XWingTMG,39c9so,mahthyoo,1 point,Thu Jun 11 04:53:10 2015 UTC,"I feel the 40 points used on the A-wings could be much better spent. Also, if Biggs is your fire draw he should have some sort of shield regen or defense benefit and shield or hull upgrade. If he is to take heat off your B-wing he should be tough enough to take it."

XWingTMG,39c9so,Siggy_23,1 point,Wed Jun 10 23:38:50 2015 UTC,"I agree that putting upgrades on Biggs can be a waste, but IMO Jan Ors on the B-wing is going to be equally a waste if Biggs dies. She cant give evade to the B-win she's on, and if your A-wings would rather have evade than focus you may be doing it wrong...  Additionally, the math is in favor of giving Biggs a stealth device rather than the Jan Ors strategy because she gives him an evade at the expense of his focus token, and 2 naked defense dice + an evade token is worse than 3 dice with a focus token."
XWingTMG,39c9so,skyshroudace,1 point,Thu Jun 11 09:13:09 2015 UTC,"I don't think putting the upgrades on Biggs is a waste depending how you play him. What I would typically do is keep him back drawing fire until he takes a few hits. Then fly him away from the B-wing for a few turns to recover some shield and your opponent will do one of two things. Chase and try to finish him off in which case it is easy to come up behind them, or now try to focus down your B-wing which can easily absorb 5 hits until Biggs rejoins the group with a few extra shield. The goal is the control who the opponent gets to fire at. Once you have that choice, not them, you can control the field better."

Pics: http://postimg.org/image/r2hxwd9x5/ |  http://postimg.org/image/ueg8po1o9/ |  http://postimg.org/image/lym2uf9fd/  It fits all pilot cards, upgrades, damage deck, plenty of action tokens, pilot tokens,  asteroids, bombs, and maneuver templates.  There's room for dice and pegs, but I left the dice in the black bag I got from the last tourney for now (seen in the third pic).  The core set box holds all the dials/range ruler/rulebook, with plenty of room left over.  Obviously the ships don't fit in the case, but there's enough room to fit a squad or two in the Core box to take to tourneys... and they look better on display than in a case anyway.  Eventually I will want some longer-term storage for the ships, and I think foam trays sound like a good solution for when the time comes.  Very happy, the case itself only costs as much as one small ship off Amazon!"

I think it holds the ships really well without even doing that, although I try not to flip the cases around too much when traveling so the ships don't get banged up."
XWingTMG,39blgb,mxzf,2,Thu Jun 11 12:09:42 2015 UTC,"I'm ordering one today. From there, I'll know if I need a second one for complete storage, they are indeed real cheap.

XWingTMG,39blgb,mxzf,1 point,Thu Jun 11 17:06:03 2015 UTC,"I got a second one to hold all the odds and ends. They're really handy for all of the tokens. I can just pull a few of the little inner trays out that have the tokens needed and place them on the edge of the table where they're accessible. It really beats my previous setup, in which I used little seal-able baggies for tokens."
XWingTMG,39blgb,ArchonOTDS,1 point,Thu Jun 11 18:58:42 2015 UTC,"Personally, I have a Plano 732 and I expect it to be able to hold everything in the long run (which I plan to be about the same as what you have ATM).  The three 3750 trays have plenty of room for ships (ATM I have core+A+E+HWK+2400+Phantom+Interceptor+Defender+both aces+StarViper+M3-A, in addition to bases, dials, upgrades, movement templates, and damage deck all in just one 3750 and all the pilot cards and tokens in one 3650).  I expect to be able to get 1-2 of every ship and fit them in the three 3750s I have (large ships will be interesting, but I think it can be done ok).    Between the five trays it has and the storage space up top, I expect to be able to fit everything I ever buy in the 732 (unless I end up with large numbers of duplicates).  I'll have to think a bit about fitting pilot cards, upgrades, templates, and epic ships in the top portion, but I expect that it's still quite doable.    That's just my personal long-term plan for storage, but hopefully it gives you at least a bit of an idea as to one option."

They have plenty of room, though it's not really the right size and shape for cards.  My upgrades fit fine on-edge inside the narrower rows, but the dividers are the wrong spacing for full size cards (they're like 0.75x or 1.5x as wide as the cards are, just not the right ratios).  For cards, I'd probably use some of these up in the top area.  I use them for a few different things and they're great.    The 1354 is supposed to be a good case overall though.  That and the 732 seem to be the main large Plano containers people use.  They each have pros and cons with their different layouts."

XWingTMG,39bdd7,Red_Blues,5,Wed Jun 10 16:42:55 2015 UTC,"As far as I can tell, it's the Scum's X-Wing. Compare what we know about Wedge Antilles to Talonbane Cobra:   Cost: 29 points Pilot skill: 9 Attack value: 3 Agility value: 2 Hull and shields: total of 5 for both (3/2 for the X, 4/1 for the Kihraxz) Action bar: focus and target lock Both have an Elite Pilot Talent Both have an Ordnance upgrade (Torpedo for the X, Missile for the Kihraxz) X-Wing has an Astromech upgrade (unique to Rebels) whereas Kihraxz has an Illicit upgrade (unique to Scum) Wedge's pilot ability is purely offensive and works at any range. Cobra's pilot ability is both offensive and defensive, but is also very range dependent.   There's really only one thing we don't know about the Kihraxz that will make a meaningful difference: What does its maneuver dial look like? One of the biggest complaints about the design of the X-Wing is that it doesn't have quite enough maneuverability (no 1-speed hard turns, not very many green options), so I'm really hoping they address that with the Kihraxz by either making its dial strictly better than an X-Wing or giving it some sort of special trick like the Segnor's Loop, an unusual speed of K-Turn, or whatever.  If the Kihraxz does indeed turn out to be maneuverable enough to see frequent use, then I expect Talonbane Cobra at least to take on the role of aggressive jouster who can potentially one-shot cheap ships like Z-95s and TIE FIghters. He's also the first Scum ship to have natural PS 9, so he's going to be an important tool in the PS war against enemies like Soontir Fel. I expect Expert Handling or Engine Upgrade to be popular options to help him play as an anti-arc dodger without a turret.  We'll have to wait and see what the point cost, pilot skill, and pilot ability are on the generics before we can decide how good those will be and how they'll get used. I'm really hoping for a PS 5 generic with an EPT upgrade slot for a reasonable cost. The lowest PS generic will probably cost the same as it did for X-Wings (21 points), but I'd be really excited if they dropped it just one more to 20 points, so you have the option to field 5, or even just more easily use one as a bulkier, harder-hitting filler than the Z-95.  Finally, the Illicit upgrade slot and other Scum-only upgrades like the new EPT cards we're getting in Wave 7 have the potential to give the Kihraxz some fun tricks up its sleeve that an X-Wing just can't match. Inertial Dampeners or Hot Shot Blaster may only be used once per game, but they can give you that critical turn of taking a maneuver your opponent wasn't expecting and getting a shot off when you otherwise wouldn't."
XWingTMG,39bdd7,EdgeOfDreams,3,Wed Jun 10 17:08:04 2015 UTC,"I think the dial will be very similar to the x-wing but different in some remarkable way. Perhaps getting a 1 turn instead of a a 3 turn. We could also se the Vaksai fighter as a title for the ship, which could make it more interesting if the actual fighter is very similar to the X-Wing (but probably not, it's not in any preview shots so far).  I feel fairly confident that the PS5 generic will have an EPT. I think the only generic PS5 pilot we've seen without an EPT is Shadow Squadron TIE Phantoms. I have to agree with you there."
XWingTMG,39bdd7,rsixidor,1 point,Wed Jun 10 17:26:41 2015 UTC,"Guessing (hoping) the dial will more closely resemble the E-Wing... at least a little more green, if nothing else.  The ship resembles the E-Wing is design a lot, so that's what I'm thinking."

The role of the Kihraxz will be a blunt object jousting ship that's deadly and durable head-on but can be outmaneuvered by interceptor class vessels.  Where the greater strengths of the Kihraxz will lie is the Illicit upgrade slot which will serve as a sort of equivalency to an Astromech. Hot Shot, Glitterstim, Inertial Dampeners, and whatever else is hiding in the unspoiled areas of the new expansions are all going to be super fun."

XWingTMG,39a63r,PCGamerPirate,1 point,Wed Jun 10 16:39:09 2015 UTC,"Very hard to go wrong with a tie swarm. If you don't fancy a pure tie swarm, which is just 7-8 tie fighters and is a lot of fun to fly (be sure to include howlrunner if you can!), you can go for a 'hammer and Anvil' approach. Choose a 'hammer', a character ship you enjoy- be it an advanced, a defender, phantom, interceptor, whatever you like the look of. Go big on this ship, you want high pilot skill and whatever upgrades will help it do some good work, and keep it alive. Then fill up the 50-65 or so points you have left with ties. If you have a few points left over, upgrade some to obsidian ties or go for a character such as gundark or dark curse. Numbers are more important with the mini tie swarm though, so I'd go with as many academy pilots as you can.   In a game, you'll want to tie up your opponent's highest value or most threatening ships with the tie swarm. Keep them scared and force them to bump lots. Losing an action on an e-wing is way worse for them than it is for your little low priority academy tie."
XWingTMG,39a63r,Shgrizz,1 point,Wed Jun 10 11:42:00 2015 UTC,"I love the TIE swarm, iconic and devastating.  If you don't want to do the full 7-8 TIE swarm, as others have mentioned, a squint and a mini swarm is a blast.  I really like a 5 TIE Howl swarm with PTL, Auto-thrusters Carnor Jax as the flanker.  Jax popping behind to disrupt the enemies focus usage is incredible.  Really adds to the mini swarm's survivability and damage output."

XWingTMG,398mcw,Dakkon_B,1 point,Wed Jun 10 05:45:59 2015 UTC,"A man after my own heart.   This is my Vessery list that is very similar.  I have flown it about 20+ times casually and 3 times at tournaments (doing very well at each). It has a extremely high/consistent damage output.   I picked the Phantom over Fel simply cause of FCS. Which allows the phantom to fire first stripping tokens an giving a target lock for Vessery to clean up.   I picked Backstabber cause the list forces flanks. I spread out my ships just enough to force my opponent to have to pick a direction/target then flank with the other two ships while the target ship bugs out/focuses on evades. Tho Backstabber may not live as long as Dark Curse he hits harder (4 dice at rank 1 with a flank but usually a consistent 3 with TL) That an a lot of people will ignore the fighter to go after the higher value targets but the fighter can hit just as hard.  My take on a Fel + Vessery + Tie list would look something like This You give up the Stealth device for Targeting computer (a common alternative choice for Fel anyways) which gives you more chances to have TL on you opponents ship (but mind you FCS is better since it gives you a TL AFTER you shoot).  Also keep in mind lone wolf and Stealth on Vessery were just to fill in points you can adjust according to you tastes.   Lastly yet another alternative to Fel (vs a Phantom named pilot) would be a Tie Advanced named pilot like Vader. With the Raider coming out soon this is another version of this list I have been thinking about, an while I lose a little firepower I gain a more consistently survivable ship. (Vader with EU is a Fel with 2 shields and TL build in)"

Jake: 1) Focus 2) Farrell Roll or Boost 3) TL, Evade, or Boost/Farrel Roll (which ever you didn't do)  Tycho: 1) Action on character card 2) 2nd action on character card 3) Action Card  The nice thing about Tycho is that you can trade in the Barrel Roll (Expert Handling) for Daredevil. I think Tycho also gives you more flexibility in your action choice.   On the flip side, they're very similar and Tycho costs more, and wastes an Elite slot on the card, where as Jake can take outmaneuver or VI."

Other than that, you're just missing the Aggressor.  If you want to play with that one, you might want 2 since they have that awesome ability-sharing title card."
XWingTMG,3996bt,KTreu42,2,Wed Jun 10 04:38:31 2015 UTC,"Firespray, y-wing, hwk and at least 1 aggressor are definitely good purchases.  I haven't felt the need for a second aggressor yet.  I actually like flying it beside the firespray instead of going dual aggressor (which I have tried on vassal).  I do love me the HWK and the y-wings.  Need another most wanted and another single y-wing expac so I can do 4x warthog..."
XWingTMG,3996bt,VanderLegion,3,Wed Jun 10 07:34:15 2015 UTC,"My favorite scum list right now is Xizor (currently using him with Veteran Instincts, Fire Control System, Title, Autothrusters) backed by 2 y-wings (iont urret, r4 agromech, title) and a naked z95 pirate.  Don't recall what expac the FCS comes with off the top of my head, VI comes in the falcon and slave 1 as vaygr said.  If you want that one I'd get the slave 1 since you can use it for scum.  The other build I use for Xizor frequently is Advanced Sensors and Predator instead of VI and FCS.  To do that with the above list you have to drop the r4 agromechs and get Unhinged instead since you need a couple more points.  I've also had a lot of fun flying Fett in the firespray alongside IG88-B in the aggressor"

XWingTMG,396u8e,MrSunol,7,Tue Jun 9 17:57:13 2015 UTC,"If chewie gets bumped, it's likely over for you against a swarm. Gunner lists are also something I'd be worried about.  Your offensive firepower is going to be terrible, as Chewie should average 1.5 hits a turn, not that great."
XWingTMG,396u8e,Abre_Los_Ojos,3,Tue Jun 9 18:27:21 2015 UTC,"Pretty much this.  You also have no FCS on Corran so his damage goes down by a bit.  What you have is a squad that lives longer, but does less damage than a typical Falcon + Corran list.  Also your idea of just kill the deci is pretty much laughable with that damage output.  Stealth Fel can close to range one with ease on chewie and strip tokens or drop damage depending on when RAC shoots."
XWingTMG,396u8e,starslinger72,1 point,Tue Jun 9 18:42:35 2015 UTC,"Corran can dish out as much damage on a deci as fel can on chewy. At best fell has 4 dice with a focus, averaging 3 hits. Chewy averages 3 evades a turn. So deci can get some hits on chewy after soontir has stripped tokens, sure. Im guessing 2-3 a turn (less if soontir rolls bad and I still have evades). Chewy against a decimator will also average 1.5 hits per turn. Reduced to 0.5 a turn with Ysane. This still leaves corrans shot(s). r1 with a focus will average 3 hits. More so if I can manage to take a TL focus each  turn (unlikely due to rebel cap). In this case I will average 3.5 hits on the deci, which takes 4 turns to kill, while they average 2.5 on chewy, which takes 4 turns to kil.  End game leaves a 49 point corran + R2 running away from 35 point soontir.  Ofcourse no game will ever go like this, but the statistics suggest that the damage output against a deci is not ""laughable""  My main concern there would be that he gets a r1 shot on corran with both RAC and soontir in the same turn. So I have to be aware of that while flying."
XWingTMG,396u8e,starslinger72,2,Tue Jun 9 19:11:46 2015 UTC,"You wont ever get that shot on the deci though, as it should be PS 10 with engine upgrade.  (The best performing RAC + Fel build right now)  Fel and Rac can chase and kill corran in 2 turns.  After that its both of them on chewie with him either missing against Fel or maybe doing damage to the deci, if he keeps the deci in range.    This is one of those match ups that if flown well you have to pray they make a huge mistake for you to have a chance."
XWingTMG,396u8e,starslinger72,1 point,Tue Jun 9 19:17:19 2015 UTC,"Local meta prefers predator RAC over VI.  If I am so unlucky to get this matchup, then  I will take it with dignity..... and fly evades all game hoping for a 0-0 draw :p  I agree that matchup is probably un-winable. But I think I will take that risk."
XWingTMG,396u8e,starslinger72,1 point,Tue Jun 9 19:21:40 2015 UTC,"VI just makes so much more sense though.  You pull rebel captive stress for fel.  You soften up targets for him to kill, and you can move after all the PS 9 aces.  Its just a better EPT for him, as well as giving you a 2 point init bid to make sure your fel moves last in case of a mirror.  (or take dauntless if thats your thing)"
XWingTMG,396u8e,Thisisthesea,1 point,Tue Jun 9 19:24:46 2015 UTC,"I'm not disagreeing with that post, but I will point why I'd choose predator (along with rebel cap, yssane, gunner and engine).  Vi is only the better choice against ships of ps9 (and 8/10 with initiative contention) which at the moment is reserved to soontir, tur (in some cases), whisper and VI Dash or Han. The rest of the meta fringes at ps6 IG, PS8 corrans (the occasion PS 10 corran), PS 9(or 11) Han, PS3 mango outriders, and swarms. In all of these cases, predator is the better pick as VI does nothing. The problem then becomes stealth interceptors (which still have to get through rebel captive). They then have to survive regular + gunner attacks with a free re-roll + RAC ability (If not r3), and most likely a focus token. Sure that might take more than 1 turn, but in the end it gives better odds of hitting soontir than VI. (you can also drop gunner for vadar if that is your thing, gain 2 point init bid and just choke soontir)  That is atleast why I would go predator over VI."
XWingTMG,396u8e,sacimino40,1 point,Tue Jun 9 19:40:13 2015 UTC,"Actually VI is better for the stealth squints for two reason.  Fel can no longer just evade and then shoot to pick up his focus while making sure he is out of arc for auto thusters.  He has to token up as you might be able to engine back into arc, and you cant chance two shots with gunner.  This means he wont shoot you or will double stress himself, both of which are wins for you.  Predator just lets you maybe get damage through.    The major threats out there right now that are popular.  VI makes you get an extra attack against Predator RAC, and gives you the option to PS kill him.  On top of that your crits are hitting first which can be huge.  Against corran, if they run PTL you just win the fight, if they run VI you will kill him before he does much so another win.  Han is a wash really, but you get to control range which is nice for your passive. You also get your gunner shooting first, so he can strip tokens and then deal damage while your Fel shot is going in raw.  That will actually increase your damage over Predator RAC when shooting tokened ships, or at least put them in bad situations where they take one damage from RAC to save the gunner shot.    I cant over state how big of a deal it is to be able to pull rebel captive stress to RAC instead of Fel.  This alone is worth the EPT difference in a tournament setting, as rebel captive is everywhere."
XWingTMG,396u8e,1_73,1 point,Tue Jun 9 19:52:14 2015 UTC,"Good analysis. I'm planning to run that list (RAC with VI, Engine, Gunner, Isard and RC) at 98 points for the init bid so my Fel moves after an opponent's Fel. I'm sure I'm overthinking it at this point, but is there any sensible way to go lower than 98 to guarantee init in an exact mirror? The only thing that comes to mind is dropping Gunner and picking up Vader, which puts me at 96, but honestly that sounds like a terrible idea. Without Predator, Gunner is kinda critical I guess.   Do you see any reason to go lower than 98 with that squad, and perhaps more to the point, any way to do it?"
XWingTMG,396u8e,sassfactor4,1 point,Wed Jun 10 01:00:39 2015 UTC,"There are so many good 3 point cards out there for all factions, that taking those cards is better than taking the 3 point init bid.  Ones that come to mind are rebel captive, c3p0, recon spec, predator, prox mines.  The only reason I could see a ship running more than 2 point bid would be if they really wanted to run a 2 ship build, and already put on max upgrade and came to 96-ish points.  A lot of the meta is running 2x 50 point ships, 65+35 or 100 point swarm. 2 point init bid would be enough to beat most lists, and at worst case tie and go to a dice roll."
XWingTMG,396u8e,rsixidor,1 point,Wed Jun 10 01:58:08 2015 UTC,VI is just flat out better. You'll be TL most of the time if not boosting with RAC's ability. Plus initiative bid for Soontir and Rebel Captive on RAC instead of Soontir like /u/starslinger72 said.
XWingTMG,396u8e,-SeizureSalad-,0,Tue Jun 9 22:10:02 2015 UTC,"I am already aware of the ""slightly"" problematic bump (yes that was sarcasm on the word slightly. I know how that it is my biggest weakness). To avoid it I have to fly it pretty well. This will involve setting up on the opposite sides of the table, spamming 3 banks (not taking PTL) and staying as far away from the swarm as possible until corran takes out enough that bumping one is not a problem. I will also try and use a bait and switch between corran and chewy. Unless I get bumped early and take 3-4 shots from b-wings in one turn, I should be alright. And even if chewy dies early, I would expect that corran could still put up a fight.  Gunner lists are not so much a problem. Corran has enough health and r2 to take a hit each turn. If I choose not to spend the evades and let 1 damage go through on the first attack, then gunner is a wasted 5 points. In this case I can loosen up the defense and take focus+evade on chewy instead of double evade and be more offensive. The main gunner lists are on RAC, Han (or other falcon) and IG. RAC will get focused early, and take 6-7 dice each turn. Modified or not that is a lot. Letting him slip a damage through on chewy each turn is abysmal compared to the amount of fire he will be taking. Han will be a similar story but harder to hit. If it is fat han then he is not accompanied by a corran, and I will ignore han until last. If it is skinny han then he wont be running gunner + defences, so he becomes easier to focus fire. Against IG will be hardest for chewy, but easiest for corran as they lack the 360 arc. If i can get good positioning with chewy then i get the benefit of my 360 arc.  And yeah..... im not liking the inability of chewy to hit anything. But corran hits hard enough for the two of them. And I will take a 12 point MoV win every match if I have to."
XWingTMG,396u8e,Th3GingerHitman,2,Tue Jun 9 18:52:53 2015 UTC,"You will be having a hard time versus stress lists. Rebel captive will hurt, and as others have pointed out, the damage output is low. Versus BBBBZ you will have a hard time since it will take forever to kill a B-Wing and since you don't have an engine on chewie at some point they might get arc on chewie and strip tokens and land damage. Especially if you use PtL on chewie, since that will limit his movement even further.  And the bump of course, wrecks the whole evade shenanigans.  Sure, I like the idea, but I think you should playtest this first, because this looks like a list which does well on paper but might crumble in practice."

XWingTMG,396u8e,Th3GingerHitman,1 point,Tue Jun 9 19:14:05 2015 UTC,Advanced Sensors opens up a ton of opportunities. It's more defensive and allows for a greater range of maneuvering on turns where you aren't regenerating.

Rebel swarm doesn't care about the the damage you mitigate as your movement will be way to predictable, Iggy's flown well will set up the block then move after to still get shots. You will be OK verse double pancakes, but prepare to be bored for 75 minutes of slow grinding turtle sex. I don't think that this is nearly as optimal as a Kyle + Jan combo as that combo also with its tankiness, give slight bump protection and better action choices."
XWingTMG,396u8e,CHaoTiCTeX,1 point,Tue Jun 9 19:34:04 2015 UTC,"You can trim a point off by removing the Falcon title, if you are set on this build since you are getting evades from focus with Jan.  I have run something like this for a long time. You are going to struggle heavily against swarms or anything else that is incredibly defensive. Soontir is going to eat up Chewie especially with RAC as a back up. Corran is good at bursting out a target, but he will struggle against Deci's and Soontir."
XWingTMG,396bqv,mattman676,2,Tue Jun 9 15:55:23 2015 UTC,"I like this idea a lot, my only concern is your... I don't know what it's called, a prefix? The ""AF"" vs the ""USS"". ""AF"" is slang for ""as fuck"", which probably isn't something you necessarily want printed on your head, especially considering the ""alliance fleet"" isn't remotely recognized. RAF (rebel alliance fleet) could be a better option, though now you have the Royal Air Force getting grumpy (especially since you're a WWII buff). There really isn't an established prefix format for the starships in Star Wars, which is too bad."
XWingTMG,396bqv,tractgildart,2,Tue Jun 9 16:37:07 2015 UTC,"I did a little research on this prior to, not because of the AF meaning ""as fuck"" (although now that you mention it that's all I see) but because I wasn't sure exactly what to use. According to most places I saw, it's almost always referenced to by the moniker Alliance Fleet, but occasionally Rebel Fleet. RAF wouldn't work canonically and there's the confusion you mentioned.  I could replace with AFS (Alliance Fleet Ship), or RA (Rebel Alliance) instead... but for some reason AF seems right, despite the connotation."
XWingTMG,396bqv,tractgildart,3,Tue Jun 9 16:44:45 2015 UTC,"I think AFS makes more sense. Most of the prefixes seem to end with ""ship"", as they describe a single vessel and not an entire fleet. United States Ship, Her Majesty's Ship, etc."

XWingTMG,397wmb,rsixidor,5,Tue Jun 9 22:07:52 2015 UTC,I despise this strategy. If I ever saw someone doing this I would fly around in a circle and never come near you. This isnt the spirit of the game. lame
XWingTMG,397wmb,sacimino40,0,Tue Jun 9 22:16:01 2015 UTC,"It wouldn't be a very effective list anyway. It's hard to maneuver into the setup, you almost never get attacks. Your opponent can just take range 3 pot shots at the shuttle until it's dead while avoiding shots from the other two.  The spirit of the game, though? How do you define that? There's plenty that say that big turrets don't fit the spirit of the game, either. The game is utilizing your ships in a way that gives you an advantage and hopefully eventual victory over your opponent. In that sense, I guess it's not matching the game well. I'd much rather see someone do this than Fat Han it up."
XWingTMG,397wmb,VanderLegion,3,Tue Jun 9 22:29:27 2015 UTC,"Fortressing (any variant where your ships aren't m oving and just sit in one spot the whole time) is pretty much universally despised and considered bad sportsmanship in this game.  Like /u/sacimino40 said, if I saw this I'd probbaly just sit doing circles on the other side of the board until you came out.  That might depend on my list though, if I have something that'll just smash you then I'll come in and do that instead, but still wouldn't be happy with the game.  Edit: And it would in no way be diffucult to maneuver into the setup.  The 2 small ships start on the back of the board right next to the shuttle.  Shuttle either starts at a 45 degree angle and does a 1 forward first turn probably.  Shuttle moves first, does it's one forward, now all the other 2 have to do is barrel roll behind the shuttle before they do their own maneuvers.  Not hard at all."
XWingTMG,397wmb,Nomnomnicon,3,Tue Jun 9 22:42:20 2015 UTC,"It's a fun idea, really, but it lacks fire power, and is a little easy to out maneuver. Also, the Shuttle's 1 Agility makes it vulnerable even at Range 3.   ""Fortressing"", as discussed here, is when you do three shuttles with the chap who takes stress tokens bumping into the 0 move one. Usually all with HLC's. Lots of shots, counts the bonus green die at Range 3 and is generally scary to fly against --------  --------If you're not expecting it. If someone's bringing a Fortress to the table and it's not round one, it's either obvious from card picks or it's been spoken about by other players on the day. I don't think it's against the spirit of the game - I imagine it as being a Shuttle or Shuttles holding position in a bid to frag attacking fighters before being flanked. Using the board edges is just them having chosen somewhere where flanking them is a no go - space dust clouds, dense asteroid fields, etc.   So go for it - and if anyone gets upset that you've countered a hyper mobile list with your wide arcs and defensive play you can just be happy knowing it's all fictional, so all strats are potentially viable and feasible in the world :D  If someone really pushes you on board edges, tell them your fleet has a philosphically limited view and can only think within the box that the board represents. That's a game limitation, rather than a player exploit. That's not within your control, and if someone else didn't think of using them rather ignoring them tactically, their loss. :D"

Also, having dealt with a Fortress, they're easy to spot and easy to flank if you've got fast ships or Engine Upgrades. You end up giving them the choice of breaking formation or staying in a Fortress but only getting one Shuttle on target. The natural low agility of shuttles is the downfall of this strat, as even Range 3 shots can pick off some hits."
XWingTMG,397wmb,PCGamerPirate,1 point,Wed Jun 10 14:57:59 2015 UTC,I don't think it was ever said using the edge of the board was bad sportsmanship in the previous thread.  I could see how it looks like that though.  I think that there's a big difference between using a board edge during your approach versus staying in a board corner and bumping in place.
XWingTMG,396fs2,raga7,2,Tue Jun 9 16:22:04 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind that the meta for escalation has changed with the new rule ""You must field at least two ships for every level."" This means the old winning strategy of a single fat ship for the 60 point match is illegal.  If you want to sandbag a round to fit a fat ship in the next one, you should do so in round 1 maybe 2 because those rounds are worth less MoV."
XWingTMG,396fs2,PCGamerPirate,1 point,Tue Jun 9 16:44:39 2015 UTC,"""You must field at least two ships for every level.""   What it actually states is that you must field 2 ships in the first round.  After that, you have to use everything from the previous round so you'll always have at least 2 ships in your list.  Round 2 you could conceivably add no new ships and just add upgrades to the starting ships."
XWingTMG,396fs2,VanderLegion,1 point,Tue Jun 9 20:00:29 2015 UTC,"Like PC said Fat Chiraneau, Han, and Dash were excellent options to start out with if your escalation is going the standard 60/90/120/150 but they finally realized those lone ships are a little overpowered in 60 point games so they errata'd it.  You could still do something like Han with lone wolf and a bandit and still have a solid list then just deck out Han next round if you really want to run him.  As for overall escalation strategy here's the way I figure it.  Most of the ships/loadouts in X-Wing are designed with the idea that they're meant for competitive 100 point games.  Arc dodging aces are thusly more valuable in smaller games cause there are less ships to get shots on them and they essentially have a bigger map to run around on.  The latter games will benefit more from ships that have AOE effects like Howlrunner, Etahn or Biggs.  So if you wanted to start out your list with something like Soontir Fel with PTL, TC and AT's with two academies that'd be a pretty decent 60 point list.  From then on you can just get Howl and keep cramming assorted ties into your list till you have a huge swarm with an ace in your back pocket at the 150 level.  That said, there are many ways to go around building an overall list.  I started out with 3 AP's and a doomshuttle in my last tournament and did quite well with it so there's nothing saying you have to have an ace but it's something I'd tell you to be prepared for your opponent to have."
XWingTMG,396fs2,blairbunke,1 point,Tue Jun 9 17:32:12 2015 UTC,"The latter games will benefit more from ships that have AOE effects like Howlrunner, Etahn or Biggs.   Conversely, as you get up to 150 points there's more ships shooting AT you leaving you less likely to have pilots like Howlrunner/Etahn/biggs even survive the first round.  If you end up with howlrunner and a bunch of low PS pilots to take advantage of him while your opponent has higher PS pilots than you, odds are good of howlrunner dying on the first turn before mots of your ships even get to take advantage of his ability."
XWingTMG,396fs2,VanderLegion,1 point,Tue Jun 9 19:59:02 2015 UTC,I have been trying to figure out a escalation list myself. Now I know the rules generally via PDF but still have a few random questions.   So the must field two ships is an errata?   I didn't see it in PDF.  Point is I don't really have a great idea what to fly but any advice is welcome to mull over.
XWingTMG,396fs2,Dakkon_B,1 point,Tue Jun 9 21:08:26 2015 UTC,"The two ships is an errata.  What ships do you own, what is the format of the tournament you're looking at is it just 60/90/120/150?"
XWingTMG,396fs2,blairbunke,1 point,Wed Jun 10 01:27:23 2015 UTC,"I was told it was 50-100-150 by the local shop monster (since we only have about 8 players on average) but the store owner said it will be using the rules I linked previously, which that PDF only mentions 60-90-120-150 games.   I own 1 of every Imperial and Rebel ship, but zero scum. (but the local players that own basically everything are nice enough to borrow out anything that may be needed for official events)"
XWingTMG,396fs2,Dakkon_B,1 point,Wed Jun 10 06:03:13 2015 UTC,Well if it's 50-100-150 then it might be ok to just start with one ship so you could consider that.  There's really no wrong way to go about building a list just consider the tips I gave above.

XWingTMG,395suy,EdgeOfDreams,2,Tue Jun 9 14:23:16 2015 UTC,"http://xwing-miniatures.wikia.com/wiki/Category:Bombs  Currently there are 3 different types of bombs.  Seismic Charge - dropped before you reveal a maneuver template, this bomb goes off at the start of combat. Anyone within range one of the token suffers one damage.  Proximity Mine - you use an action to drop this bomb. If a ship base overlaps it at anytime (including when you drop it) or its maneuver template overlaps it, the bomb goes off. The ship that triggers it rolls 3 attack dice and suffers any hits or crits rolled.  Proton Bomb - Same as the seismic charge except when it goes off at the start of combat, all ships within range one are dealt one face-up damage card (meaning it bypasses shields)."

I suppose I'd have preferred if it was printed somehow (like torpedo damage) on the upgrade card, but I can see how that would crowd an already tiny space.

Another possibility is to run 2 BSP's with Wingman and Stealth Devices at 99 points, though with 3 PS 4 ships, that probably is not a major concern.  This setup would allow you to be more aggressive with double stressing, while still being able to use Isard and your entire dial."

XWingTMG,3959cn,pwnedlikewhoa,2,Tue Jun 9 13:05:23 2015 UTC,Navigator could be interesting. Being able to adjust your movement at the last minute to ensure that you hit someone could be useful.
XWingTMG,3959cn,Waramo,2,Tue Jun 9 12:57:25 2015 UTC,"Downside to tactician for this build is that you want to be banging against other ships, which puts you in range 1 and unable to use his ability.

XWingTMG,395ez4,RDT2,2,Tue Jun 9 15:11:26 2015 UTC,He needs a weapon engineer. If I'm going against bombers with Jonus I need to take as many shots at Jonus as I can before the bombers get in range of my CR90.

XWingTMG,395ez4,gromolko,1 point,Tue Jun 9 16:40:33 2015 UTC,"What about weapons engineer? The second target lock has to go on a different ship. Also, shoot Kagi with the primary weapon or perhaps a turbolaser and he should go down pretty quick."

XWingTMG,395ez4,starslinger72,1 point,Tue Jun 9 18:01:56 2015 UTC,and yet that ship can be brought to its knees in a single turn of fire from concentrated HLC fire.  Its a give and take really.

XWingTMG,395ez4,antigrapist,2,Tue Jun 9 18:53:31 2015 UTC,300 points is 12 small ships of the same class.
XWingTMG,395ez4,Theepum7,2,Tue Jun 9 18:51:43 2015 UTC,"Currently, yes, Jonus can let a raider reroll 2 dice on secondary weapon attacks and Kagi will be able to gift TLs to the raider.   Currently, the rebels can give the CR90 a bump in PS (via roark) or free TLs (via Dutch) or focus tokens that immediately get removed (kyle etc). If FFG finds that jonus +raider is broken in testing, then it'll be changed in the FAQ, but I doubt it'll come to that."
XWingTMG,395ez4,scuff,2,Tue Jun 9 13:06:13 2015 UTC,Jan also gives the extra dice to the turret on the tantive...   Having jonus for the re-rolls is still a very expensive predator card...

I have each faction in its own tray, and the last tray is for bases, asteroids, maneuver templates, whatever else. I actually don't even use the top section except for random stuff, like rule books, and spare card sleeves. My transport fits in one of the trays along with all the other Rebel ships I have. If I had the Corvette, I would have to store that in the upper section.  Edit 2: One downside: I don't keep my cards in that case. I have them sleeved and in binders which I carry in a backpack.

XWingTMG,396o2s,EdgeOfDreams,1 point,Tue Jun 9 17:27:03 2015 UTC,"Ah, well then, all is forgiven.  As far as actual storage, I keep small ships in their original packaging with the ship, dial, base, and pegs. For large ships, I take the plastic part that holds the actual mini and use that to hold the ship, dial, base, and pegs. That plastic part has a backing part that makes it a closed container, which I then wrap rubber bands around to keep it closed. For all the tokens that come with the ships, I use one of those little craft organizer boxes that has a bunch of little subdivided compartments.  This way of storing things isn't as compact as taking all the ships out and putting them in foam or whatever, but I like that it's relative cheap and keeps each ship with the things you need to fly that ship. I transport stuff in a backpack or rolling suitcase, depending on how much I'm actually taking with me to a gathering or event. However, I also tend to plan a squad or two I want to fly before I leave home and only bring the things I need to run those squads."

I figured that'd be better than buying a lone 3750 and then later on buying the 732 in addition."
XWingTMG,3959bz,fl1p_problems,1 point,Tue Jun 9 10:18:17 2015 UTC,"First of all, I like Shuttles. They're solid and slow, but with 3 Attack dice they can lay down some hurt near the end of the round. Darth Vader is the icing on the cake for cheap damage in a wide arc.   Variant 1: Rebel Captive is somewhat wasted on a Phantom, I find, as it's not that tough and the turn it gets shot at is probably the turn it dies, as most players won't shoot it unless it's the only target or decloaked. I'd rather get FCS and leave the crew slot untouched, making Whispers attacks more reliable, therefore giving him a higher likelihood of winning a focus token to defend himself with.   Variant 2: Kath is better off with a Mangler Cannon than a Tactician I think, as it gives her an almost guaranteed crit each attack which causes stress at all ranges, not just range 2. Then again, Tactician would trigger off her rear arc whereas a mangler can't. Ideally, I'd take both. I know you're tight for points due to wanting the two big ships with a heavy fighter but it's worth considering.   What are you running on your DoomShuttle? Is it the standard(ish) build?"
XWingTMG,3959bz,Nomnomnicon,1 point,Tue Jun 9 10:55:47 2015 UTC,"Thanks! V1: Good point on Whisper. That saves me one point though which means two free points. Maybe another Tactician on Whisper?  V2: I thought about a Mangler, but I really want to use the Firesprays rear arc, as it could be the only way to get those arc dodgers, also Tactician allows me to doublestress with a little luck. I even considered running Calculation instead of VI to make crits happen, but I think PS9 might be better.   Doomshuttle is the standard OGP+Vader 24pt Build  Edit: Ugh, noob me just realized Tactician really just works in Range 2 not Range 1-2. Which changes things a little."
XWingTMG,3959bz,Nomnomnicon,1 point,Tue Jun 9 11:19:33 2015 UTC,"Again, Tactician only works at Range 2 and Whisper works best at Range 1. You can try it - always worth spending points - but having recently tried it on a Phantom, I didn't find it triggering too much. Still, If you have 2 pts floating it's worth trying for when it does trigger.  Calculation is a good shout, but I think you're dead right about PS9 if Arc dodgers are your concern. Have you considered Outmaneuver? It triggers in a Firespray's rear arc and helps deal with high agility ships.   TY for Doomshuttle deets, no points to be saved there xD"
XWingTMG,3959bz,doodeman,1 point,Tue Jun 9 11:54:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah, only just realized the range constraint on Tactician. Noob me. ;)  So, for V1 I'll likely choose something else.  Outmaneuver will help me lay damage onto the arc dodgers, but will reduce the stress efficiency. With Kath I want to let him evade my crits, as it will force stress, but then again, a crit taken is probably better than no damage at all. Still, choosing PS9 or Outmaneuver I feel inclined to go for PS9..."

XWingTMG,393p4q,polyology,8,Tue Jun 9 01:06:40 2015 UTC,"So, first, what are the benefits of flying in formation?   Overlapping firing arcs, so you can more easily concentrate fire on a single target Fewer decisions to make about maneuvers, since all the ships in the formation will usually choose the same maneuver Less likely to bump into your own ships, if you set it up right and fly it well, compared to having multiple ships coming into the hot zone from various angles Guarantee that your ships will be within range 1 of each other (or 2 for looser/larger formations) for triggering pilot abilities and upgrade cards that depend on friendly ship range (Howlrunner is the classic example).   Next up, what are the downsides of flying in formation?   A formation is easier to arc dodge completely because all the firing arcs are mostly overlapping, versus if you spread out your ships you're more likely to at least guarantee one shot on your enemy. If the front ship bumps into an enemy, there's a good chance the whole formation will end up bumping each other Seismic Charges and Proton Bombs are more likely to catch the whole formation in the blast, since the ships are tightly grouped up. There's also a few other abilities like Ruthlessness that similarly punish tightly grouped ships. Formations, especially large ones, can be hard to effectively maneuver through narrow gaps between obstacles If the formation contains more than one ship type, you're limited to choosing maneuvers that exist on both dials Small mistakes or imprecisions in placing your maneuver templates and ship after maneuvers can add up, eventually leading to unexpected ship bumps.   Based on all that, when should you fly in formation? When the benefits outweigh the downsides, which can be hard to judge. You also have to consider the option of flying in formation at the start of a battle, then splitting up at just the right time to take your opponent by surprise, especially when trying to nail down a pesky arc dodger.  In general, large groups (4+) of the same ship are the things that do best in a single formation, or pairs of identical ships (though I don't know how much I'd really call that a 'formation'). Arc dodgers don't really like being limited by having to stay in formation, and turrets don't need to be in a tight formation to overlap their firing arcs, so most formation fighting is done by groups of cheap, less maneuverable ships that only have a forward-facing firing arc.  As far as looking at your opponent's squad, that's not going to have a ton of influence, at least at the start of a battle. If you've build a squad to fly in formation and practiced flying them that way, you're going to want to stick to the plan in most cases. However, you might find yourself breaking out of formation earlier in the battle against highly maneuverable enemies (e.g. Interceptors), while staying in formation longer may serve you well against fat, slow enemies that you need to focus fire on to take down quickly (e.g. Y-Wings or large turret ships lacking Engine Upgrade). Facing a squad with seismic charges, proton bombs, or assault missiles might be a good enough reason to avoid flying in formation, but I haven't played against those munitions enough to really know if that's necessary or not."
XWingTMG,393p4q,EdgeOfDreams,2,Tue Jun 9 03:03:28 2015 UTC,"The most time i break up my formation (i'm flying in the moment only schwarms) are 3 points:  - avoid bumbs or flying over obsticals  - i lost my synergie (like Howlrunner or Serissu)  - the only target left is a ""flanker"" (Sontir and Deci(dead))"
XWingTMG,393p4q,Waramo,1 point,Tue Jun 9 08:46:42 2015 UTC,"As far as looking at your opponent's squad, that's not going to have a ton of influence, at least at the start of a battle.    I disagree. If I'm flying a swarm or mini-swarm, and notice that my opponent has Ion Torps, Assault Missiles or Ruthlessness, I'm definitely not going to fly in formation after the first or second round, as the first two can decimate a pinwheel, and the third behooves me to fly at range 2 of each other but at range 1 of his ships, as you're forced to choose a target with Ruthlessness.  Plus, you're on point about bombs as well. If he's got bombs, it's a lot riskier for me to fly in formation until he drops them, especially if he's flying 5 Gammas with Seismics."
XWingTMG,393p4q,darth_static,3,Wed Jun 10 14:22:35 2015 UTC,"If there is a ship that benefits staying close together (Howlrunner, Jonus, Etahn (Sort of), Biggs, etc) then you definitely want to fly in formation. If your opponent is running a large ship (falcon, deci, outrider), formation generally helps in the focus firing of said ships, although if they have a flanker like a Phantom, you may want to send one ship off to try to keep that away while you deal with the bigger if that's your choice.  Scum in my experience does not want formation ever really. too many abilities can either backfire back on you, or only trigger when you're alone.  A lot of times it is beneficial to at least start most lists in a formation. 4 ship lists have long used the pinwheel since its an easy formation to learn and easy to break away from if you need to. It is a very specific list that wants to be broken up and scattered, although that generally happens as a game progresses."
XWingTMG,393p4q,kintexu2,5,Tue Jun 9 02:42:50 2015 UTC,"good advice, though I will say the exception to your rule for scum formation flying are Scum Y-wings. At 100 pts you can fly 4 scum Thug y wings with the btl-a4 title, autoblasters, engine upgrades and unhinged astromechs; it is a sight to behold. There is nothing they can't destroy if they're in a pinwheel formation at range band 1."

If you're flying Xizor or Serissu formations are good.  I fly Xizor all the time and I ALWAYS fly in formation at the start.  It devolves later on and the formation breaks up, but with his ability to pass of damage I stick to formations.  Kaa'to also benefits from at least flying close to toher scum ships.  Torkhil can be useful to keep in formation or at least, again, close to other ships so they have shots at whoever he hits with his ability."
XWingTMG,393p4q,VanderLegion,3,Tue Jun 9 07:01:50 2015 UTC,"The majority of squads that people are running now are either designed to go in formation all the time, or don't care about formations/can't fly in formation without risking blocking each other.   4BZ, 3BY stress lists, and Howlrunner Swarms need to be in formation to be effective, while lists like Fel + Decimator or dual aggressors don't really care that much.

XWingTMG,393skn,Inquisitorsz,3,Tue Jun 9 01:33:41 2015 UTC,"I'd suggest reading through the FAQ, there is a link on the sidebar. The majority of the rules and rules clarifications are in there or in the rule book that you hopefully already read.  The general rule about cards is that you need to own a copy of each card if you're playing in a tournament. For casual games, pretty much everyone will let you not having a second copy of a card slide, especially if you have a placeholder for it. Especially when playing with friends, you should be able to proxy cards you don't own as long as you have the card text printed out somewhere to reference.   Card trading isn't really a thing because either the cards are common enough where no one would want to buy them, or they're uncommon and no one really wants to sell them. The market just isn't big enough for anyone to really bother."
XWingTMG,393skn,antigrapist,1 point,Tue Jun 9 01:49:01 2015 UTC,"For casual games, pretty much everyone will let you not having a second copy of a card slide   Tell that to the guys I usually play with.

XWingTMG,393skn,darth_static,3,Wed Jun 10 14:26:04 2015 UTC,"Do you have to own an expansion to use it?   Depends on the setting.   In a tournament setting, yes. You must have the actual card to use it, even multiples. However I imagine that this is far beyond your scope right now. You bought a core set with your friend an one expansion each, so you're taking it easy and playing friendly casual games. In these, like any other game, as long as the two of you are okay with it, do what you like.   A common thing is to ""proxy"" cards, or even ships, that either aren't released or you don't own yet.   Get yourself a scratch piece of paper, write Push The Limit on it with a number for the cost (3), and bam, you're rocking a PTL elite upgrade. You can easily find images online of any card in the game, even unreleased stuff. There's new pilots and upgrades coming out soon(ish) for that TIE Advanced of yours that will GREATLY improve it. It will be shipping in a two pack with the Raider, the first Imperial huge ship for the game.   There's a lot of advice, and a lot to know, so ask as it comes up, and welcome to the obsession!"

XWingTMG,393skn,leewardstyle,1 point,Wed Jun 10 14:51:55 2015 UTC,"If you're playing at sanctioned tournaments, then you must have a copy of each card/ship in your list, including multiples. If you are playing casually, just proxy the interesting cards that you want to use until you inevitably buy that ship. Nobody should really be upset about that.   The game basically requires you to buy nearly every ship if you want to have access to the best upgrades and pilots, unfortunately. You can find some upgrade cards individually at places like Teamcovenant.com and eBay, but the cost is generally high enough that it's worth it to just buy the ship so that you have another ship to pilot.   As for trading, I can't imagine most people would trade away their copies of the more important upgrades, unless they just bought several copies of the ship that they came with. I haven't seen anybody trying to trade, but I'm not going to say it definitely doesn't happen.

XWingTMG,393skn,Ohthatguyagain,7,Tue Jun 9 02:58:26 2015 UTC,"A lot of people recommend getting Slave I and Millennium Falcon for your first 2 large ships since they are iconic to Star Wars, but I disagree because they are not statistically similar.  The VT-49 Decimator much more closely resembles the Falcon in terms of power and survivability, while the YT-2400 is more on par with Slave I.  For small ships, buy these expansions together if you're looking to keep parity:  E-Wing = TIE Defender  A-Wing = TIE Interceptor Z-95 Headhunter = TIE Fighter expansion Rebel Aces = Imperial Aces  After that, it gets tricky to compare, but I would also say if you really get into it, pick up a HWK-290 and the Most Wanted starter for the Scum & Villainy faction.  Three factions really spices things up, and it's nice you can use multiple ships from the original factions (HWK-290, Y-Wing, Firespray).    But remember: Technically, any 2 squads are balanced as long as you play with the same number of points!"
XWingTMG,393skn,KTreu42,2,Tue Jun 9 03:12:27 2015 UTC,"Falcon, Slave 1, Rebel Aces, TIE Interceptor, a second Core Set, and a standalone TIE Fighter are my top recommendations for beginners to pick up, especially if you're planning to mostly play casual and provide all the ships for you and your friends. If you want to play more seriously, though, I highly recommend you find a game store group that you can play with and borrow ships from for games so you can learn more about the game and ""try before you buy"" so to speak."
XWingTMG,393skn,EdgeOfDreams,1 point,Tue Jun 9 03:15:21 2015 UTC,"I'd suggest Imperial Aces before the Interceptor pack, as you get two copies each of Push the Limit, Royal Guard title, and Targeting Computer, which are hard to find in other packs and are basically essential for flying squints."
XWingTMG,393skn,darth_static,1 point,Wed Jun 10 14:29:15 2015 UTC,"In order I recommend..  Core Set  X-Wing expansion (now you have 2 x-wings and twice as many x- wing pilots to choose from.)  TIE Fighter expansion (now you have 3 TIEs and twice as many pilots to choose from)  Interceptor Expansion (great ship with one of the best and most popular pilots, Soontir Fel)   Rebel Aces (Now you have an A wing and a B wing to try out and you'll be glad to have those pilots and upgrades if you get the individual A wing or B wing expansions. You also get Push The Limit card, one of the most popular upgrades in the game and makes Soontir Fel's interceptor almost untouchable.)  TIE Phantom expansion (Ship with a cloaking device, lots of fun if you can find it.)  Step by step would keep you pretty balanced and you can carry on from there."

XWingTMG,393skn,darth_static,1 point,Wed Jun 10 14:31:06 2015 UTC,"The rules are fairly easy to understand if you read through the gamebook from the core set and the Official FAQ from the sidebar. Basically 95% of the questions you might have regarding rules will be answered in those two tomes.     Couple of things to keep in mind when reading cards:   When a card says ""may"", you can choose to not do what the card says. Eg: the astromech R7-T1. If you activate him, you can choose to not take the target lock, or to not take the boost. Or you can choose to not do either, but that would be a waste of an action. If a card mentions ""a"" ship, the ship that the card is attached to could be a possible target for that ability. If it mentions ""another"" ship, then it cannot. Eg. if you attach Jan Ors to a Falcon, and then perform a Focus action during a round, you can change that Focus to an Evade. However, if you attached a Wingman card to that same Falcon, you would not be able to use it to remove stress from the Falcon.   Card trading is sometimes a thing, but not often as a lot of the perceived value is held within the cards, while the actual value is in the production of the miniature. There are some companies that will buy packs and split them to sell the upgrade cards on eBay or their own storefront, but you won't be able to get all the cards as it's not worth splitting up a CR-90 (an epic ship costing anything from $80-$140) because there's only 4 cards in that set usable outside of epic play, and only one in high demand (C-3P0)."

XWingTMG,393qw6,KTreu42,2,Tue Jun 9 03:20:49 2015 UTC,I think I need to do a better job driving Dash into a corner as it seems I can never get in range 2 to ion him with y's or HWKs.
XWingTMG,393qw6,Enervata,2,Tue Jun 9 03:35:42 2015 UTC,"Range 2 is very difficult to maintain with my Y's against Dash.  He needs to be near an edge or corner for you to keep him in that zone.  It'll be much easier once the K-Wing comes out.  It comes with Twin Laser Turret, which supposedly has range 2-3.  Range 3 is very easy to maintain with Unhinged Y-Wings."
XWingTMG,393qw6,Enervata,2,Tue Jun 9 14:43:49 2015 UTC,"I played 4x Scum Y's at Regionals and practiced this matchup the entire week beforehand.  It's easily one of the Y's worst.  My Y's had Unhinged and ICT.  Corran and Dash usually start on opposite sides of the map, in order to force the opponent to make a choice between them.  Dash is usually the better target to go after first, but it depends what you're running.  With my Y's I started in the middle of my side, and tried my best to keep the obstacles out of that general area.  Dash's usual MO is to move forward fast so he can potentially shoot you at Range 3 with a boost on turn 1.  After that he turns into the obstacles and kites you.  Corran usually doesn't join the fight until turn 2 or 3.  What works best for me, which may also work for other squads, is to charge in turn 1.  My goal with Dash is to beat him to that turn (into the obstacles).  I fly PS2 Scum Y's, so I get to move first.  As long as I bait him into boosting into range 3 on turn 1, I can usually do this since I move before him.  I setup my Y's 3 or 4 across, depending what the board looks like can accommodate, so I can get arcs on Dash.  With my squad I had to ionize Dash in the first pass, and then take him immediately out.  So it meant predicting where he would make his turn into the obstacle field and beating him to that point.  If Dash beat me, I usually lost.  He's nearly impossible to catch if you're chasing.  Your safest recourse is to deny him access to the middle of the board and try to engage when he gets near a corner.  It worked for me at Regionals.  It was the one matchup I beat quite solidly, but I attribute that more to practicing against it."

XWingTMG,392opc,Suicidal_Ferret,1 point,Tue Jun 9 04:10:02 2015 UTC,"The Punisher? Definitely Rebellion era, so during the movie period. It's in the Galactic Battlegrounds game and the FFG RPG sourcebook, Stay on Target.  So that's not really outside of the main timeline.  K-Wing is probably the farthest outside of canon eras that have been depicted, at 16 ABY. The CW era is pretty much canon. I'm not sure where we see a YT-1300 in-canon during that era (other than that one that might have just been an easter egg) but the old Ys and Zs in TCW series are definitely canon. Pretty awesome, too. They should totally do TCW era ships..."

XWingTMG,392opc,Th3GingerHitman,1 point,Tue Jun 9 00:42:11 2015 UTC,E-Wings also appeared in the Dark Empire Comics by Dark Horse in a couple of pages.  Dark Empire happens after Thrawn and before Jedi Academy.
XWingTMG,392opc,Raithnor,1 point,Tue Jun 9 14:30:37 2015 UTC,Dark Empire was published around the same time as the Thrawn trilogy. I believe the E-Wing was introduced in Dark Empire. I don't believe it was ever Mentioned in the Thrawn books. Doesn't mean the New Republic didn't have them then. Just means Timothy Zahn didn't know they existed.

It was great to meet you!  Hope to see you around again in the area.  I also had hull upgrade instead of stealth device on Fel, and was at 100 points even.  In hindsight, an initiative bid would have been really helpful against the field full of Decimators."
XWingTMG,390v0z,YellowRex,2,Mon Jun 8 15:09:59 2015 UTC,"It was great meeting you there. It was a very enjoyable game despite being trounced. I was making mistakes all over the place that game.

XWingTMG,390v0z,YellowRex,1 point,Mon Jun 8 18:32:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I didn't like any of my other options, and with hull upgrade on board I'm less scared of taking damage from rocks.

XWingTMG,390v0z,LazyG,1 point,Fri Jun 12 21:18:31 2015 UTC,I guess hull upgrade is better against gunner-toting turrets where you are really likely to get hit. I guess SD is better versus non-turrets.
XWingTMG,390v0z,YellowRex,1 point,Mon Jun 8 16:15:24 2015 UTC,I think it all depends. Pretty much if my SD helps me avoid 1pt of damage in a game it seems to be the same as an extra point of hull. If my SD helps me avoind 2pts of damage in a game it seems better than the hull upgrade then. Though who's to know if that SD die was the one that made it count or not.
XWingTMG,390v0z,Maho42,1 point,Mon Jun 8 18:33:47 2015 UTC,"I used hull upgrade because my toughest matches were folks with feedback array.

XWingTMG,39127x,Paranoia515,15,Mon Jun 8 13:54:20 2015 UTC,"I'd say it's absolutely guaranteed.   I don't think it'll be a new faction - They don't seem overly concerned with the timeline. For instance, the E-Wing isn't technically a Rebel Alliance ship, it's a New Republic one, since it wasn't introduced until after the foundation of the New Republic.   Likewise, ships belonging to whatever the Imperial faction in Ep.7 is might technically not be Galactic Empire ships, but I don't see why that should matter too much."
XWingTMG,39127x,doodeman,3,Mon Jun 8 14:11:32 2015 UTC,"I hadn't even considered the possibility of The First Order and the Resistance being a separate faction from Empire and Rebels. If they did make new factions that would be a huge change in the game and one I don't think we'd see so shortly after the addition of the S&V faction (an argument also against Clone-Wars-era factions existing).  I have to agree, probably no new factions right now.   The E-wing is a real odd-ball in regards to timeline. Do we have any other ships that are New Republic era?"
XWingTMG,39127x,rsixidor,3,Mon Jun 8 18:50:27 2015 UTC,"The K-wing is from roughly the same timeframe as the E-wing, post-RotJ."

I can't seem to pin down the exact ABY of either ship's introduction but the E-Wing was during Thrawn's campaign (started around 8 ABY) and the Black Fleet Crisis the K-Wing operated in started around 16 ABY.  Both of those years are in the New Republic time period, though."
XWingTMG,39127x,rsixidor,2,Mon Jun 8 19:17:46 2015 UTC,"Fair enough. I was just arguing they're far enough ahead in the timeline to where they aren't ""Rebel"" ships, technically."

XWingTMG,39127x,MythicalMothman,3,Sat Jun 13 14:52:34 2015 UTC,"I just doubt they know anymore than we do about the movie - I personally doubt Disney keeps them in the loop on ship designs and characters and everything, so I'd expect FFG to not even start working on Episode 7 ships until after the movie has been out for a while meaning it could easily be over two years before we see any."
XWingTMG,39127x,cleonm,4,Mon Jun 8 14:13:01 2015 UTC,"I hope this isn't the case. I mean, they already have the Ep7 stuff for Lego all designed. Wouldn't it behoove them to keep FFG in the loop, to really take advantage of the absolute frenzy the film will generate?"
XWingTMG,39127x,zombiemann,4,Mon Jun 8 14:30:40 2015 UTC,The only difference is Lego is HUGE and they are going to work with the largest revenue companies first. It may take a while for the Star Wars mojo to trickle down to the smaller vendors.
XWingTMG,39127x,MythicalMothman,3,Mon Jun 8 14:53:51 2015 UTC,"Lego generates a shit ton more royalties revenue than FFG could even begin to hope for.   Just based on the teasers, the Empire is still in full swing. Since the new movie takes place something like 30 years post Return Of The Jedi, the Empire has had plenty of time to recover. Palpatine/Vader weren't the only two despots in the Empire. Lot's of folks waiting in the wings for their chance to run the show.   Although, the shot of the ""storm troopers"" shows them in front of a banner that isn't the Imperial Cog that we are used to seeing.   On a side note: I know it wouldn't really fit from a narrative perspective but I would LOVE to see some Old Republic era ships."
XWingTMG,39127x,rsixidor,3,Mon Jun 8 14:55:17 2015 UTC,"It would be cool if they kept FFG in the loop and Episode 7 ships/characters were announced right after the movie comes out, but it just sounds very unlikely to me. I don't think Disney sees FFG as a key player who they should reveal secret plot details to, they probably only want to involve really core businesses at this stage.  I mean look at Star Wars Rebels - season 2 is starting soon and there are no FFG tie-ins. That's obviously way less big than a new movie, but still..."
XWingTMG,39127x,i_shit_my_spacepants,3,Mon Jun 8 16:08:05 2015 UTC,I really do need The Ghost in my life...  But people are certainly going to be confused by The Phantom.
XWingTMG,39127x,MythicalMothman,4,Mon Jun 8 18:51:35 2015 UTC,"I personally doubt Disney keeps them in the loop on ship designs and characters and everything   I don't know about that. LucasFilm already worked with FFG on the design of a completely new in-canon ship specifically for their game. It wouldn't surprise me if they were kept pretty well in the loop. Maybe not quite as much as Lego, but still.  There are literally zero people who wouldn't benefit from FFG being able to release episode VII ships close to the release of the movie. The only risk to Disney is leaked information, and that's not really a huge problem - if FFG leaked movie details, they would lose all their Star Wars licenses forever. They're not going to take that responsibility lightly."
XWingTMG,39127x,iroll20s,2,Mon Jun 8 16:44:31 2015 UTC,"There's a difference between FFG making their own ship that LucasFilm signs off on and FFG getting access to JJ Abrams' ships. I definitely agree that it would be cool and profitable for FFG to have access to those ships right away rather than later, I just doubt Disney cares enough about FFG to go through the effort - Disney probably works with lots of companies making all sorts of Star Wars merchandise and they only invest a lot of effort on the really important ones (Lego). I could be proven wrong but I'm not expecting it to happen soon."

The corvette will take some damage from the collision ( 1 die from small ships, 2 from large ships).  Small ships can fly completely over the CR90 without penalty, unless they can't clear it, in which case it's treated like hitting an asteroid."

XWingTMG,392v90,Durog25,1 point,Mon Jun 8 21:22:08 2015 UTC,Links don't work/ :/  The problem with both secondary weapons is range. You might not want this to be on all of your list because of that. What works against some ships does not work well against others.
XWingTMG,392v90,rsixidor,1 point,Mon Jun 8 21:28:12 2015 UTC,"To make working links, you need to save the squad and then hit share>web link.  Rebel Captive did well with an autoblaster on his Boba +IGB list, making the top 8 in a currently running vassal tournament.   The big downside to autoblaster weapons is the fact that they only work at R1, and how they're almost completely useless against low agility ships."
XWingTMG,392v90,antigrapist,1 point,Mon Jun 8 21:35:58 2015 UTC,"Why useless against low agility. I understand that the upside of autoblaster is that it always hits with hits so some of the charm is lost when your shooting at low agility B-wings, Y-Wings and large ships. However especially for those large ships it would shut down those wombo combos like C3P0, Falcon and Ysanne Isard on Decimators.  Is it just its price to damage is too low?"
XWingTMG,392v90,PCGamerPirate,1 point,Mon Jun 8 21:54:57 2015 UTC,They are almost completely useless against low agility ships because almost all autoblaster carriers have 4 attack dice at range 1 anyway.  Autoblaster cannons are priced a tad too high. Autoblaster turrets are priced just right because they will earn those points pretty quickly (but they can't one shot anything).
XWingTMG,392v90,PCGamerPirate,1 point,Mon Jun 8 22:26:15 2015 UTC,But in that case the ship can just use its primary instead and use the auto blaster on the more dangerous/ evasive targets.  Take my B-wings in the build I posted they can at range 1 hit any ship with 2 uncancelable hits every turn. With a B-wings durability and the builds abilty to get two B-Wings shooting at PS12 every trun as long as they are both shooting the same target the can kill a phantom or Interceptor in one round regardless what the ship does. The trick would be flying well enough to get into range on with both.
XWingTMG,392v90,KTreu42,1 point,Mon Jun 8 23:50:59 2015 UTC,"But then you are not using a 5 point upgrade.  There's no doubting the power and capability but, as you state, getting that shot is the challenge (and not a trivial one at that). I think you can spend the 10 points more effectively.   Autoblasters can really work on high PS ships with post maneuver movements that can support the shot despite using the action to get the shot. Scum Boba is a prime candidate if you want to see the cannon really work for you."
XWingTMG,391gdv,X-factor103,2,Mon Jun 8 15:40:35 2015 UTC,"Saturday I ran with Whisper + VI + FCS + ACD + Navigator, Echo + VI + FCS + Int Agt and Mauler Mithel + TC + VI at our FLGS tournament. I went 2-2, which should have really been 3-1 but I let a guy slide on a bunch of missed action. I have never flown Echo before.  In the first match, I was facing Luke, some B-Wing, a stripped down Corran and an A-Wing test pilot. I really didn't know how to fly Echo and put her on a rock and that jacked up my game. We were only playing 60 min so opponent got a modified win. I did two shot Luke with Whisper and Echo however, but he got to take down both Mauler and Echo.  Second match, I flew pretty badly again but my opponent forgot to take a bunch of actions flying Brobots. I was willing to trade both Mauler and Echo for 88B but when he remembered he forgot to take his actions, which I let him as this was a casual tournament, that saved his ass. Since B didn't die like he was supposed to, he was able to chase down Whisper.  Third match, I faced two Mandys and a Z-95 with HLC (I think). He was able to take out Mauler but I bird dogged with Whisper surprisingly, and Echo ran the other three ships down mercilessly and smoked all three one by one. I really got the hang of Echo at this point.  Four match, faced a BBB Luke line up. Echo ended up bird dogging the Bs and Whisper got a lucky one shot kill range 1 on Luke. I made the Bs separate by flying into the rocks and killed the other 2 Bs before time ran out.  I really like the one two combo of Whisper and Echo, especially with VI so you're running at 9 and 8. With Mauler + VI, you got another 9. Int Agt is nice to pick your target and see what their dial is, and then set up the pink mist shot with Whisper and Nav to move closer if you have to. I think I'll be running this line up again."

I've seen Academy and Mauler so far in this thread. I understand the idea is to have the most points to upgrade the named guys, but is having even just an academy TIE worth it?"
XWingTMG,391gdv,kkentium,1 point,Mon Jun 8 16:44:45 2015 UTC,"I'm going to say no, simply because of Predator. At the very least, take an Obsidian Tie so any opp with Pred only gets to reroll one die.  The other option I've thought about for the third ship is Dark Curse. Opponents hate it when they can't change their attack rolls so I'll just fly DC into the middle of the shit to mess things up for them."
XWingTMG,391gdv,kkentium,1 point,Mon Jun 8 16:48:59 2015 UTC,"I guess, from a newbie perspective, the idea is to use your phantoms to pop a couple enemy ships off before they drop your pain-in-the-neck 3rd dude. And really jam that third dude in their faces to make sure they're not ignoring it."

XWingTMG,391ugt,cleonm,8,Mon Jun 8 17:16:04 2015 UTC,"From page 10 of the official rules (bottom-right corner):    Range combat bonuses only occur when a ship is attacking with its primary weapon.   Page 11, about attacking:   Also, if he is targeting a ship at Range 1 with his primary weapon, he rolls 1 additional attack die.   Page 12, about defending:   Also, if he is targeted at Range 3 by the attacker’s primary weapon, he rolls 1 additional defense die.   Heavy Laser Cannon, other cannons, missiles, torpedoes, Hot Shot Blaster, and anything else that is not the ship's default, built-in primary weapon is considered a ""secondary weapon"", so the range bonuses to attack and defense don't apply."

XWingTMG,390b0d,jonboyjon1990,2,Mon Jun 8 08:57:19 2015 UTC,"Just came from my first regionals,  over 70 players turned up and Fat Han was well represented.  Faced slight variations of the list twice,  lost both matches,  but I certainly don't begrudge my opponents choosing to fly an established squad that is obviously proven effective.  Fly what you're comfortable flying and don't let it take away from your success.  Congratulations on your victory,  and the cool prizes."
XWingTMG,390b0d,DarthClank,1 point,Mon Jun 8 18:02:00 2015 UTC,"Good write up.  Did you get any 'reactions' from other players that made you feel bad? Were any people trying to spoil your victories with tutting and eye rolling?  If there was, then it might not have been the right scene for a super competitive fat-han list. If people were excited to try their brewed list against an established build, then you shouldn't feel any guilt for doing well.  There's a shop near me where the patrons would react poorly if I turned up with BBBBZ for a night of friendly games, which is fair.  I don't think anyone can tell you if you were a dick or not without knowing the other 9 people you were with :) If it was a regionals style tourny where there is a potential to go on to higher stakes tourneys, then there can't be any complaints over what you fly.   If it's a friendly tourny where people are running just what they have and making a point to try out stupid lists, then maybe don't fly Fat Han again :)   But hey, you can at least say you got to do it once! :D"
XWingTMG,390b0d,Asbestos101,1 point,Mon Jun 8 13:43:28 2015 UTC,I didn't have any sort of negative reactions at all really. Although one of my opponents did make a point to note that my list was a carbon copy of Paul Heaver's.   This was 'just' a store championship with 10 players. So I imagine that next time out I'll run less of a 'netlist'
XWingTMG,390b0d,1_73,1 point,Mon Jun 8 16:08:05 2015 UTC,"Don't feel bad for flying a netlist. There is nowhere in the rules that you can't fly a list which was proven to be good. And you can still fly a good list with sucky piloting skill and end with 0-4, so congratulations with your win."
XWingTMG,390ft0,SuperstormSandyHook,7,Mon Jun 8 10:00:14 2015 UTC,"I've flown Deca's a lot and I usually know by turn 2 or 3 if I've flown it badly enough to lose. I like driving past little ships and gunning them down backwards. Also remember running over an asteroid is a viable escape plan as you have a million hit points. Alternatively, try Darth Vader + Gunner against high agility ships to squash them early.   Expose is almost built for Decimators, and I agree with the experimental interface idea from Drag4n. I don't like Gunner & Predator together as one makes the other less worthwhile. I would use EU though, great plan, and possibly PTL so you can move, boost out of fire arc/into Range 1/both and then TL so when you roll your dice you're more likely to get the hits in. RAC's ability makes focusing not as useful.  My personal build is Oicunn, Daredevil, Dauntless with Rebel Captive and Mara Jade, EU and Ysanne. Drive all over people (twice with daredevil) and then shoot something you didn't bump.   Alternatively you can hold back a bit and try to bait with Soontir in your list. Once things are looking the other way Deca's tend to rip them apart.   TL;DR: Fly like dick, boost a lot out of arcs and unload at range 2 onto a Falcon with target locks."
XWingTMG,390ft0,Nomnomnicon,5,Mon Jun 8 10:31:14 2015 UTC,Chiraneau needs engine upgrade for survivability. Ideal would be out of half the ships arc most of the time
XWingTMG,390ft0,Luness,3,Mon Jun 8 11:35:02 2015 UTC,At the Boston Regionals (74 people) I went 4/2 and came in 22nd flying decimator / fel. The guy who came in second had a similar list and went 6/0 in swiss and NEVER LOST A SHIP all day. Crazy right?  In one of my games I played I fought a guy with Ethan and 5 Z's. I never even touched my damage deck that game. All I lost were 4 shields on the decimator and I killed his entire squad. I pretty much rarely gave him a shot on the decimator with how I flew it and Fel is just well.. Fel.  Decimators are amazing. I think in one regional a double deci list won even. It is all how you fly them I think. They are amazingly arc dodgy with engine upgrade and are a lot faster than people realize.
XWingTMG,390ft0,EtherealGyre,3,Mon Jun 8 12:18:40 2015 UTC,btw.. your list is solid. It is the same list that has won or done well in many regionals. It's really about flying it well.
XWingTMG,390ft0,EtherealGyre,1 point,Mon Jun 8 12:21:14 2015 UTC,"I'm curious, how did the guy who came in second and never lost a ship ONLY come in second? That sounds very much 1st place to me.  Or was it based on points killed and he lost in that regard? Seems like if he was in the finals and didn't lose a ship in the last game, his opponent must have done really well too."
XWingTMG,390ft0,pxdnninja,1 point,Wed Jun 10 22:22:02 2015 UTC,The only ships that he lost the entire day were in the final game. Hence he lost that game and therefore came in second.

XWingTMG,390ft0,pxdnninja,1 point,Fri Jun 12 02:47:04 2015 UTC,"Usually the Decimator will not finish a game. His job is to do damage and soak up damage. If the Decimator is killed, that's 16 damage plus the time it took all soaked into that one ship. Your copilots should be the real killers."
XWingTMG,390ft0,StoneWall99,1 point,Mon Jun 8 11:00:32 2015 UTC,But it's worth so many points that the opponent doesn't really have any option except to go after the Decimator first anyways.
XWingTMG,390ft0,MythicalMothman,2,Mon Jun 8 14:18:01 2015 UTC,It is a tough choice you give your opponents.. Fel of the Deci... lots of times people I play chase Fel.. I believe that is generally a mistake. Decimator needs to die quickly.

XWingTMG,390ft0,OSouup,1 point,Tue Jun 9 04:55:16 2015 UTC,"Most of the time, the attack dice on the Decimator and Fel are plenty for your targets.  Your main goal is to preserve the Decimator and Fel.  Fly conservatively, arc dodge as much as possible, kite at range 3.  I had a perfect game against 4 Bs and a Z with that build at Regionals.  I was either out of his arc entirely, or trading shots at range 3 with one B-Wing, all game.  It's what you need to do with it.  If you have a harder target that three attack dice don't do the trick for, e.g. Han w/ Title and C-3PO or Focus+Evade IG-88s, then you need to double up and gun hard for them.  Try to get both Fel and the Decimator at range 1 for maximum dice.  If it's an IG-88 with Autothrusters, fly the Decimator like a starfighter and put them in front of you.  You'll need to be attacking with both ships in one round to put damage on them.  I'm 4-1 against IG-88s with that tactic, and undefeated so far against Fat Han.  Gunner Predator is great.  The action economy it gives you is really good.  It can also strip tokens and allow you to reshoot when your opponent is trying to avoid taking crits on their hull and canceling all your results.  Good opponents will take the one damage, so you do need to make sure you use your re-rolls to get a good amount of damage."
XWingTMG,390ft0,YellowRex,1 point,Mon Jun 8 14:51:37 2015 UTC,"Early on, I've asked myself how anyone LOSES with the Deci. Key is to give it a few clutch upgrades, but don't smash 62+ points into it, at least IMO.  You want to have at least 2 other ships to escort it, even if 1 is an Academy Pilot.  I've never tried the Deci/Soontir build, but I hate the fact that you're counting on 2 ships (1 with 3 HP to its name) to win the day.  I think you need more targets for your opponent, and more red dice to throw against opposing targets each turn."
XWingTMG,390ft0,KTreu42,1 point,Mon Jun 8 16:55:38 2015 UTC,"Decimator doesn't really need EU, take expose. It's a much better option to spend your action on. It's really easy to get the Decimator into range 1, with expose that's 5 dice, with RACs ability you'll always be doing a lot of damage.  RAC doesn't really need gunner either, however it's not a terrible choice, I honestly just prefer a full on stress build and use Mara Jade in that spot.  Soontir is fine, I personally go shield and stealth device. He's a full on arc dodger and at PS9 he should really never be getting hit."
XWingTMG,390ft0,Washout81,-5,Tue Jun 9 13:33:42 2015 UTC,"Too much points in it, not enough survivability, you're basically screaming ""KILL IT PLEASE"". Decimators can be a pain but they melt quickly, as you saw. So dont load it with so much things and bring something else that can draw the fire out of it, like another int or a mini swarm.  Chraneau can rape small agility ships like Z95, with expose and experimental interface. TL + expose is a 4 dice + reroll at range 2 or 5 dice + reroll, pretty ugly given Chiraneau's ability."
XWingTMG,390ft0,Drag4n,3,Mon Jun 8 10:13:04 2015 UTC,I think his list is generally better than an expose list. If you end up playing someone with a stress build expose is just wasted points for that game and you generally want to be good against as many types of lists as you can.

I can think of better things to do with 5 points.   drop the FCS and put a HLC on the other b-wing?     R2-D2 on biggs.  biggs dies.  biggs dies quickly.   4 extra points on biggs will generate 1, maybe 2 more shields before he dies.  worth it? maybe? if i run a astromech i'll run r4d6.     list 3, i'd like another b-wing over the rookie with r5, but if you've only got the two, its a straight forward list.    I like the chardaan prototypes over greens, they are great blockers that are just annoying.    of the three, personally I'd fly the 2nd list, with modifications.     Biggs  Blue w/HLC  Blue w/HLC, FCS  Prototype w/Chardaan  fly a block with the 2 b-wings protected by Biggs.   Prototype as blocker/flanker."
XWingTMG,39133z,branniganbginagain,1 point,Mon Jun 8 14:35:10 2015 UTC,Awesome.  Thanks for the advice.  I'll try flying the second list with your modifications and see how it goes.  A block is just a close formation that jousts the enemy ships?  And I would use the a-wing to attack the enemy from other angles?
XWingTMG,39133z,EdgeOfDreams,2,Mon Jun 8 15:08:38 2015 UTC,"When people talk about blocking/blockers in this game, they mean positioning a ship so that enemy ships run into it and lose their actions, while also limiting where the enemy can move to. PS 1 A-Wings with Chaardan Refit are great for doing that because they move first, have good maneuverability, and have a low point cost."
XWingTMG,39133z,branniganbginagain,1 point,Mon Jun 8 17:10:26 2015 UTC,"yeah, just meant fly the B-wings with Biggs, in such a way that the enemy has to shoot at biggs, and you'll throw three big attacks back.      the a-wing could fly in front and mess up their formation, since at PS1 he'll move first and block the other guys, preventing them from taking actions.  Or the a-wing could fly fast around the outside and approach from another angle."
XWingTMG,38z3h2,Wolfgang52,4,Mon Jun 8 01:39:30 2015 UTC,"The ship itself has it's uses... but personally I would get it for that cards it comes with, Rebel Captive and Darth Vader are good cards.

XWingTMG,38z3h2,nutano,1 point,Mon Jun 8 02:15:17 2015 UTC,"I disagree, I wish I bought the shuttle first, mostly for the cards. Rebel Captive, Mara jade, and that Bumpimator."

XWingTMG,38z3h2,LazyG,3,Mon Jun 8 08:45:43 2015 UTC,"I like the Lambda, but you have to accept it has a four-five turn life span. If it doesn't get targeted for being the only thing on your list with 1 Agility you'll have probably flown it out of arc and it has no quick way of turning around - Without updagreade, it's probably 3 turns before it comes back due to it's 2 distance turns being red.   If you use a named pilot, get Daredevil. If you don't (like me) and use it as an HLC/Darth Vader bus, get Engine Upgrade. Don't forget you can brake for a Red 0 move which I like doing turn 1 so I can get an idea of where the enemy is.   Also, give a Black Squadron Wing man and fly it in circles around a shuttle to give yourself a static turret - quite good if you know where the fights going to be for a few turns!  EDIT: As point out by 2dskillz, Shuttles have no EPT so I would always recommend an Engine Upgrade."

The shuttle also comes with some great upgrade cards that other ships can use as well, such as Rebel Captive.  In any case, get it if you want it and think you'll have fun with it.

You need upgrades to do something with it. Advanced Sensor and Engine Upgrade are your best friend. Just use them often! Or just play a Doom Shuttle. Stress Shuttle -> 2 Taktiken - Marajade with Engine Upgrade. Kagi with enhanced scope it's a bit tricky but usefull.  Second Rule: you need to plan ahead, allways try to figure out where you are in the next 2-3 Turns and where your opponent is. This my sound crazy but after 30 games with shuttles you know what i mean. Its to easy to get in the back of your shipt. Dont to Always a ""parking"" maneuver, use your 2 Turn or 3 bank to move even more suprising.  You can get manny funny games with them (i will fly this week LLLL-TB -> 46 HP!)"

I think the loaded-up Serrissu is just too much of a point sink and a tasty target with only 3 hit points.  The squad I've had some luck with was 3 Z-95 plus Serissu with minimal upgrades. That leaves plenty of points to throw in an upgraded flanking ship like Xizor or Guri."

I managed to stay alive with all 4 for some time, chipping away at the enemy with focussed fire from the cannons, and irritating with the Ion cannon (which hits often due to predator).  Both people I played saw 3hp and assumed they would crumble away, but they did OK for me :)"

XWingTMG,38yd6j,Torobasa,7,Sun Jun 7 22:03:14 2015 UTC,"Oh yes, it certainly could be. I love ion weapons, but I rarely run them. I'll talk about ion weapons in two parts: first, why I rarely run them and then where I find them useful. This will lead into a short discussion about general control lists.   The problem with dealing with 2-ship builds with ion weapons is that one of those two ships is a large ship, taking two tokens to ionize, and often with damage mitigation capabilities, and the other usually has 3+ agility making it hard to hit even once. The cheapest way to add ion capabilities to your list, capable of consistently ionizing a large ship, is with the ion cannon, two of them to be exact. At a total of six points, I'd be more comfortable spending one more for a single HLC and here's why: Damage. Specifically, the lack of damage that ion weapons put out (excepting ion torpedoes but those are a whole different problem, being ordnance), and the damage that the opponent can put into you while you're doing it. Even when firing ion weapons at the Decimator, arguably the easiest ship to ionize, you're still reliant on the dice coming up good for you and the second you can't get two tokens on it that thing will be off like a shot and you'll rarely get another good opportunity  Besides, when ionized, a ship can still take an action after that maneuver and with all the engine-upgrade happiness going around, they can keep boosting such that you'll never get them off the board...  ...unless that sucker is stressed. This is where ion weaponry shines, and why lists like Panic Attack are so bloody scary. A stressed and ioned ship is completely and utterly helpless (without Nien Numb). It can't take actions, it can't do anything to defend itself. That's why I love the ""tachyon"" cannon - an ion cannon with Tactician crew. At Range 2, this can easily accomplish that goal. R3-A2 is also amazing at this. Additionally, an ion at the right time can be devastating. You can surely tag a large ship with an ion token early in the game and then wait for the opportune moment to put the second token on, say when it's close to the edge of the board ;) I'd like to add a great point /u/antigrapist mentioned below: you can and should use the known movement of a well-timed ionization to set up a killing box of shots on it and pour on fire when you know that it's going to be in a certain position.  Unfortunately, ion weapons, unlike purely damage-dealing weapons, effect different ships differently. Ion could be great against a Decimator or Fat Han, B-Wings or Shuttles, but their effectiveness is greatly diminished facing higher agility ships like Soontir, Corran, and IG-88 (who, being a large ship with 3agi, is probably the hardest ship in the game to ionize). Since in a tournament, you'll probably face any combination of these ships across multiple games, a list with ionizing weaponry can vary wildly in its effectiveness from game to game. That's why slapping an ion cannon on a B-wing just because you have 3 spare points isn't very effective - you'd be much better off with an E/2 and Tactician because the Tactician will go off consistently where as the cannon relies on the fickle minds of the dice gods (may they bless me and look with blank faces upon mine enemies). Lists that have control elements don't fare nearly as well as lists built entirely around control, like Panic Attack. That list has consistently-triggering control effects in R3-A2 and Tactician as well as consistent damage output with the BTL title and B-wings' primaries, and some ion capability as well. My personal favorite variant runs the Stressbot, 2 Tactician Bs, and one ion B-Wing. Good control lists can choose not to be controlling if they need to (I can always just fire my primaries), and can tank some damage thrown back. Simply slapping on some control elements haphazardly  because you have a few points is not useful because the list needs to be consistent across all its matchups.   Since I appear to  have gone on a bit of a rant, let's wrap it up: to summarize, control is absolutely an effective strategy. It just needs to be run intelligently: firing your ion weapons at the right moment when your target is vulnerable, and building your list so that it can win if its control elements were stripped out.  Thanks for sticking with me and I hope this spawns a good discussion about control lists and strategies! :)"

Slightly less so against Falcons and Outriders (as they are typically quite evasive and require two tokens).  In our local Regionals I flew against a list with four Ion cannons (including two turrets). They got both of my B-Wings off the board but could not pin Dash down (I run a three ship list).  In other match-ups, Super-Dash could boost/barrel roll there is a good chance that he would still be able to stay on the board long enough to kill enough ships to break the Ion-lock, much the same as a Fat Han.  It's not a terrible strategy, but it's also not an instant-win either."

XWingTMG,38yd6j,Korlus,1 point,Mon Jun 8 02:11:58 2015 UTC,"Boost or barrel roll, but not both unless it's going to prevent a shot (which with BTL Y's or against Ion Cannons regularly will). That way you either don't get stressed, or know you're going to be able to move next turn. Dash's 1 forward plus a boost and also a barrel roll is actually further than a Y-Wing can move, meaning it's often better to stress yourself for a turn to evade shots, and then turn around to make another pass."
XWingTMG,38yd6j,MysteriousRacer_X,2,Mon Jun 8 09:07:43 2015 UTC,"It's tough to say - my first thought is that it may work sometimes, but in a tournament you need to be prepared to deal with more than just one build type. You may win some matches, but it won't be a take all comers."
XWingTMG,38yd6j,antigrapist,2,Sun Jun 7 23:21:06 2015 UTC,"Yes, it certainly can, but the goal isn't really to ion ships off the board, more just lock them down so they can't run away. Then you can get a couple R1 shots and just kill them.  There are currently two ways to do this, with stress or ion cannons. The stress route uses Blues with the E2 mod and tactician, while the ion route uses Blues with ion cannon and one or more Gold Squadron Y-wings with the ion cannon turret.   The two strategies go together because ioned ships without stress still get actions and can boost or barrel roll away from the edge of the board or asteroids. The stress variant is more popular because it works even if your attack hits if you're at the right range, and you can do more than 1 damage per shot.   Personally, I've been running this list which has two ion cannons and 3 stress sources, so it's almost a hybrid list. I'd suggest you give it a try, and also read Mr Froggies article that spawned this style of list."
XWingTMG,38yd6j,SirSolaireOfSunBro,1 point,Mon Jun 8 00:26:47 2015 UTC,"So yes, i actually just ran both of my opponent's ships off the board in a game last night, due in part to one lucky dice roll, and to him trying to close the gap between my ships too soon. My opponent had a standard super fel and chiraneu, whileI ran 2 Bs with tact and ion each, a y wing with an ion turret and r3a2, and a Z with ion pulse missles- the Z didnt come into effect honestly. My opponent killed the Z on the first turn without him getting shots off, but i double stressed soontir and stressed and ioned kenkirk. When i k turned my two B wings and turned the y wing, i had position advantage, and ioned kenkirk again, (lucky die roll of the night) i ioned soontir, killing his stealth device and keeping him with more stress. This turn it was pretty much over, as one more ion hit made soontir have no choice but to maneover off the board, and kenkirk as well. To note, however, kenkirk was almost dead by the time i ran him off the board, and so was soontir. I actually gave up shooting the last turn on one of the B wings so i could say i ran both of his ships off the board. In the end, i took a total of 11 damage ( two from debris/asteroids). It would have been a different game if i had done a standard B swarm, and that may be more efficient, but damn is that list fun. TLDR- 3 ion shots with 1 on a turret, and three ways to give stress is great. Having a 15 point Z that will auto ionize a large ship can be clutch, it just didnt happen in my game. It may be better just to swarm."

XWingTMG,38ylyw,Wolfgang52,2,Sun Jun 7 23:13:33 2015 UTC,"I'm not really sure what you're going for here. Your squad is only 82 points while most people play with 100 point squads.   I'm guessing you don't have that many ships, which shouldn't discourage you. Maybe you can get people to play 50 point games with you, or just pick up another imperial ship or two. If you do have a limited collection, I'd suggest mentioning what you do own in future posts for more relevant advice.  A couple thoughts on your squad itself:   Marksmanship is a bad upgrade even if you can attack twice a round (like a ship with gunner or corran horn), but on ships with only 2 attack it's not worth the point cost.  Rexlar really would like to be running a heavy laser cannon, in my experience."
XWingTMG,38ylyw,antigrapist,0,Mon Jun 8 00:37:35 2015 UTC,"Defenders are jousters, pure and simple.   They just aren't maneuverable enough, even with the white 4k to really take advantage of outmaneuver.   Plus rexlers ability likes having something else to mod his attack do he might save his focus.   I prefer predator to outmaneuver on him for these reasons.   Ion cannon is nice, but for the cost of his ion cannon, missiles and fail safe, you can put a hlc on him, which is sweet.     Blacks are taken as a cheap ept carrier, and need a specific reason.     You've got enough points after rexler to run a 4 tie mini swarm.   Always think really hard on ties, whether down grading one or two would gain another academy tie and whether the upgraded pilots are really worth the loss of numbers(hint: usually it's better to take another academy)"

XWingTMG,38zc44,ernesto__-,1 point,Mon Jun 8 02:49:26 2015 UTC,"Are you proxy-ing Calculation and Tactician? Could you proxy Mangler Cannon as well? Lately I've been liking Veteran Instincts on Ten. Moving last most of the time allows you to barrel roll with confidence, and may make better use of Tactician as you can adjust slightly forward or backward to Range 2. If you have Mangler Cannon, it doesn't matter that you didn't choose to focus or target lock, as rolling a hit or crit with three attack is rather likely, so Ten's ability will trigger. You'll lose his ion ability and the init bid, but your damage output will be higher and PS10 is tough to beat. Ten should be focused down first, allowing the Y-Wings to harass.  I haven't flown Ys in a long time, so I can't really comment on them."
XWingTMG,38zc44,mahthyoo,1 point,Mon Jun 8 07:09:03 2015 UTC,"I'm using ion and calculation on ten because I thought it would be fun. I know full well how to use ten. My regional build had him with mangler, AS, and VI with a phat han and I ended 14th."
XWingTMG,38zwfr,Armouren,0,Mon Jun 8 05:59:11 2015 UTC,"On the Rebel side, I'd lean toward Rebel Aces, which comes with an A-Wing and a B-wing along with some great upgrades mostly specific to those ships. A pair of Z-95 Headhunters could also be worth considering since it's the Rebel ship most similar in points and abilities to the TIE Fighter.  For the Imperials, I'd recommend Slave 1. It's an interesting ship that you can dump a lot of points into upgrading. It has shields, and the rear firing arc opens up some interesting strategic options. Plus, it's a large base ship so you can start getting a feel for how those fly differently from small ships.  The problem with the TIE Defender is that the two named pilots for it are rather hard to use effectively without building your whole squad around them, while the generic pilots just cost too much for what they bring to the table.  The Phantom, on the other hand, might go the other direction and be too good. Flown intelligently, they can be incredibly hard to kill, and I think their abilities would only be magnified by the limited ship selection you have. The main counter to Phantoms is big turrets like the Falcon, which you may not have any of.  The TIE Interceptor and TIE Advanced are probably the better-balanced small Imperial ships for the kind of thing you're trying to do. Not to say the Defender and Phantom are bad choices - if you like the way they look or whatever, go for it.  In general, though, trying to go to specifically a 3v3 scenario is going to be hard because the TIE Fighters are SO cheap compared to most ships that your third Imperial ship would need to be quite hefty to balance out the squad unless the Rebel ships are also things on the extreme cheap end like the Z-95 or A-Wing. If you're willing to break the symmetry, though, you could do something like buy a second core set to play 2 X-Wings vs 4 TIE Fighters, or buy the Falcon for the Rebels and play Falcon+X-Wing against 3 to 5 Imperial ships depending on what you pick up."
XWingTMG,38zwfr,EdgeOfDreams,1 point,Mon Jun 8 06:23:35 2015 UTC,"For a starter like me this was a fantastic read! Thank you!  I think one of my problems was I was forgetting the point system.  I was trying to stick with symmetry, but might try and diversify instead.  I think I will get the Rebel Aces... still need some time to the one imperial ship."
XWingTMG,38zwfr,EdgeOfDreams,1 point,Mon Jun 8 07:18:16 2015 UTC,"You're welcome. Good luck with continuing to learn the game. Of course, eventually you may just end up buying one of everything!"
XWingTMG,38zwfr,Squash_the_Hunter,0,Mon Jun 8 07:22:49 2015 UTC,"This is a really unusual request. The fact you're asking the question makes me wonder if you understand how point systems work. All ships are not created equal they each have a different points value and your total squadron points cost cannot exceed a target number which is typically 100. A 3v3 is not inherently balanced its about both sides having the same number of points.  If you already understand that and still want an answer, you can't really get an imperial list to 100 points with 2 tie fighters and one other ship, the closest would be with a decimation. Instead I would buy imperial aces its the same price as a large ships and gives you two interceptors. 2 tie fighters and 2 interceptors could be a good 100 points.  Rebels is easier, a falcon or outrider and a B wing is what I would suggest."
XWingTMG,38zwfr,EdgeOfDreams,1 point,Mon Jun 8 06:29:00 2015 UTC,"Yep, still pretty wet behind the ears.  I was looking so closely at the at the ships stats and maneuverability that it never occurred to me that FF was also balancing them with the Point system, (Derp).  So I shouldn't worry too much as long as we both stay in a determined squad value?"
XWingTMG,38zwfr,OSouup,2,Mon Jun 8 07:09:54 2015 UTC,"Yep, if you just set a limit on the number of points total and keep it equal for both sides, you should be fine. Officially, the game is balanced around 100 points per side, but you can easily do 50, 60, 75, or whatever and still have it mostly work out. Half the fun of the game for many people is trying to figure out how to make the best combination of pilots and upgrades you can while staying under the point limit."
XWingTMG,38zmkg,codyryan17,1 point,Mon Jun 8 04:21:13 2015 UTC,"Without mouldy crow Jan must focus every turn, which means she must do green moves every turn, which means your opponent knows exactly where she's going every turn and can block."
XWingTMG,38zmkg,OSouup,1 point,Mon Jun 8 04:56:23 2015 UTC,he has plenty of points for Moldy Crow still with what's listed.  I'd drop the Grey to a Gold Squad with Ions and give Swarm Tactics Jan to give the Y-wing a PS 8 attack.  Then drop Recon Specialist for Nien Numb to help Jan keep up with the YT-24000 and then you'd have 2 points for a flechette torpedo on the Y-wing.  Make sure you take 3 debris with you as well!
XWingTMG,38zmkg,DokerinZion,1 point,Mon Jun 8 19:25:27 2015 UTC,I disagree with dropping recon spec on jan ever. It leaves you without a focus to spend on your attack roll with the turret.

XWingTMG,38wsk2,cleonm,8,Sun Jun 7 14:30:28 2015 UTC,"General new player advice:  1.) Don't spend all your points on upgrades. You're better off with more ships. This gives you more HP and attack dice. Similarly, don't always take the highest PS. Tycho isn't always better than a prototype, unless you have a specific plan to take advantage of his ability and PS.   2.) Focus your fire. Maneuverable Imperial ships can be hard to target, but if you can concentrate multiple firing arcs they will melt quickly.  3.) Don't be in a rush. Advance slowly and make them come to you. This keeps your arcs wider and helps you get better shots in.  4.) Don't play his game. You can't outmaneuver a phantom, but you can control it. Run an ICT Y-Wing to take away his speed advantage. Run Han or Dash to always guarantee a shot."
XWingTMG,38wsk2,Lepre_Khan,3,Sun Jun 7 16:05:26 2015 UTC,Thanks. This helps a lot. I need to mix it up and not play into his advantage.
XWingTMG,38wsk2,oceanborn2,2,Sun Jun 7 16:10:52 2015 UTC,"What this gent said. Especially point 1.).   Corollary:Fly lots of different squads with lots of cheap pilots. Many of your pilots will die, but you'll learn more and win more than you might expect.   If in doubt, buy an extra B-wing. Or four, as needed. :)  ... last seen wandering off, trying to dodge the obvious Pink Floyd reference"
XWingTMG,38wsk2,DarthClank,4,Sun Jun 7 21:38:24 2015 UTC,It might help people to provide feedback if you let them know what your squads consist of when you play.
XWingTMG,38wsk2,polyology,3,Sun Jun 7 14:40:33 2015 UTC,Make sure there arent any rules that you two are overlooking to his advantage. For example if he is running a phantom make sure you are using the updated decloak rule.  Beyond that give us some examples of what he tends to run and what you tend to run for better suggestions.
XWingTMG,38wsk2,eunoiared,2,Sun Jun 7 14:41:23 2015 UTC,"I ran Wedge, Tycho, and Ten Numb last night. Ten had outmaneuver. Wedge had R2 and Auto cannon. I can't remember what Tycho had equipped.   He ran a Defender, advanced, phantom, and tie. I think they were mostly bAsic units with only one ace."

XWingTMG,38wsk2,BrandCAG,1 point,Sun Jun 7 14:58:22 2015 UTC,"Do you remember any of your units being disappointing, dying too easily or not doing much damage? Same question on his.   Reiterate my suggestion to make sure he is declaring a decloak and performing the decloak boost/barrel after everyone sets their dials but before anyone else moves.  If you're running few ships with high pilot skills and upgrades and not having luck, try the opposite, try running more ships with fewer upgrades and named pilots. 4 B-wings has always been strong. 2 x-wings and 2 bwings can be strong too."
XWingTMG,38wsk2,YellowRex,1 point,Sun Jun 7 14:57:45 2015 UTC,I generally run named pilots and only 2 or three ships.
XWingTMG,38wsk2,DarthClank,2,Sun Jun 7 15:43:46 2015 UTC,"See,  some lists are just straight up better than others.   Some play styles too.  Spend some time looking around at what lists are competitive and why that is.   Typically you'll find it comes down to red dice vs hit points.   Which is why things like 4b's and tie swarms work.  It's also important to learn why so few players run particular upgrades like the autoblaster.     You can run thematic or gimmicky lists all you want,  but against a more competitively built list,  it's not likely to fair well."
XWingTMG,38wsk2,antigrapist,2,Sun Jun 7 17:03:54 2015 UTC,"One thing I do that's helped identify trends in my gameplay is maintaining a file of brief summaries of all my games played, including asteroid placement, any set plays used, and what went well during the game, as well as what went poorly."

It also lets you reliably focus your fire on a single ship at a time and deal with things like the phantom more easily."
XWingTMG,38wsk2,DokerinZion,2,Sun Jun 7 21:02:39 2015 UTC,"Check out Earn Your Wings and Not Such A Bad Pilot.  Piloting is huge.  Learning how to correctly pick maneuvers and post-maneuver adjustments (boost and barrel roll) is a huge huge part of the game.  Some squadrons are better than others, but don't get too hung up on it.  Picking maneuvers and targets correctly is way more important."

If you've played Star Wars the Card Game (also by FFG) a lot of the images are replicated.  I've seen other Star Wars art in different games in multiple places, so I think it's not all that uncommon."
XWingTMG,38yqn4,KTreu42,1 point,Mon Jun 8 00:07:40 2015 UTC,"I have noticed a lot of images are reused by their other Star Wars games, which I can understand as fair, to a degree. But illustrations they purchase from random artists are probably being used for a Star Wars product for the first time, so you get the feeling there was at least some kind of investment on their part in the aesthetics of that specific card. I wouldn't be thrilled at getting a Magic the Gathering card that had the illustration copied from the cover of a 15+ year old MTG advertisement. Wizards of the Coast take so much pride in their art that they release hundreds of new cards every few months and almost all of them are original (reprints excluded), and they print the artist's name on each card.  FFG has a new wave every half a year or so, and has around 16 new pilot cards in each wave, and a handful of new upgrades.  It doesn't seem to be asking too much to at least dig up some talented artists within half a year to come up with enough original art for that many pilots."
XWingTMG,38yqn4,NCC-2000,1 point,Mon Jun 8 05:55:00 2015 UTC,"Most of the art is commissioned for the games that FFG has. Just go to deviantart and search for ""Fantasy of Flight Star Wars"" and you'll see a ton of familiar images. But, yes, a nice chuck does come from preexisting sources. Off the top of my head, the art from Marksmanship comes from The Bacta War, Decoy comes from Solo Command (which is a nice little nod to the fans who have read that particular book), and plenty of card art comes from Ralph McQuarrie's original SW concept art."

XWingTMG,38w59y,vesper_k,6,Sun Jun 7 09:36:41 2015 UTC,"I was wondering about munitions the other day -- in terms of a fix and all.  I think the extra munitions card is okay, but it only really aids ordnance-heavy ships (B-Wings, Bombers, etc).   The proposal I considered, alternative to the Extra Munitions upgrade, was a second damage deck. Something to apply to Bombs, Missiles and Torpedoes (I think cannons/turrets see enough play to warrant their exclusion?)  Essentially a smaller damage deck of more potent flipsides. I would assume, after all, that a critical hit from a Torpedo is likely to be more damaging than a critical from a laser weapon.   The two things I think this would do, which would aid the game?  1] Munitions, for their cost, become 'more viable' for their output 2] If critical damage was key to the real change, youd likely see munis being saved for later in the game when shields are gone.   Obviously, it would be a nightmare logistically. You couldn't force people into buying a particular set, and they'd never release a card-only.  But hey, that's my two-cents."
XWingTMG,38w59y,Winged_Gundark,3,Sun Jun 7 14:44:48 2015 UTC,Probably not. The complaint about munitions is that they're a lot of points for a one and done attack.
XWingTMG,38w59y,rd95,3,Sun Jun 7 10:19:36 2015 UTC,"I don't mind them being a one-off attack. What hurts them are when you have to spend your target lock (for proton torps and concussion missiles). If you're investing in a one-off attack, you need to make sure it lands with full force. If proton torps let you keep your TL, they'd be a very useful counter to Soontir and other arc dodgers using stealth device."
XWingTMG,38w59y,bl1y,3,Sun Jun 7 16:31:28 2015 UTC,This.  Spending the lock makes it a less powerful attack than a regular 3 die attack in many instances - so what's the point in spending points on it?
XWingTMG,38w59y,Barzhac,2,Sun Jun 7 17:06:59 2015 UTC,"A point being addressed by the Extra Munitions upgrade. There's some really entertaining consequences, my favourite so far being mine-laying Y-Wings - 5 points for two sets of Proximity. Though Nera Dantels with 2 APTs for 8 points could be a beast, though Ion Torpedoes doubled up for 7 might also be entertaining in Rebel Control."
XWingTMG,38w59y,thebaronvonanonymous,1 point,Sun Jun 7 12:49:25 2015 UTC,"For me a big part of the problem is that they are also really only usable on high PS ships.  The low PS ships cannot get you in range/arc to get it off.  Having a longer range for it would also mean having a longer range for target lock in general.  While that might be a way to encourage more ordnance use, it would also be used by every ship that has TL on it at the first possible moment, and unbalance the game in favor of rebels."
XWingTMG,38w59y,Barzhac,3,Sun Jun 7 17:05:27 2015 UTC,"I've said this before about munitions and I'll say it again, I just hope that someone at FFG reads these posts an at least bring up the idea.  Munitions don't need extra ""fix"" cards printed or better versions printed.   They need a rules change similar to what they did with decloak. Make missles reduce the targets agility value by X and make Torpedoes cancel all dice results on a hit and do Y crits.   You could change the numbers around to balance them according if they are to strong or weak.   Munitions IMO should be a silver bullet. You bring them on your squad to deal with you squads weakness. I E having problems getting damage on Soontir? Bring Missles. That Decimator not going down fast enough? Bring Torpedoes."

XWingTMG,38w59y,Aanar,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:09:33 2015 UTC,"At the very least, if you have to spend a focus or target lock to fire a missle or torpedo, you should be allowed to use it to modify your attack dice first. That would make ordinance a little more reliable"
XWingTMG,38w59y,Skywatcher1138,1 point,Sun Jun 7 18:37:47 2015 UTC,"Missiles and Torpedoes should have been an extra attack instead of replacing the primary.  Obviously they'd have been balanced completely different than they are now, but it would have made it an easier choice to pick up."
XWingTMG,38w59y,Glucose98,1 point,Sun Jun 7 19:55:50 2015 UTC,"It might, but it would also probably unbalance the game in favor of the Rebels...  I think the best way to fix most munitions would be to remove the word ""spend"" from their card...  Most of them wouldnt be nearly as bad if you didnt have to lose that target lock to get them to work.   If I got a target lock with my assault missiles, so I didnt have to waste two turns of my action economy on a single attack, I might be tempted to run it."
XWingTMG,38w59y,Siggy_23,1 point,Sun Jun 7 23:40:54 2015 UTC,so then how do they make the few that dont require spending to be good enough to compete with the old ones?

XWingTMG,38w59y,Siggy_23,1 point,Mon Jun 8 05:20:35 2015 UTC,I think they should have had munitions be more powerful because they're a one time thing and one missile should be able to have a chance to one shot a ship imo.  Paying 4 points for something that does what my primary weapon does at range one is not worth it.

XWingTMG,38ukdl,wafer_thin,1 point,Sun Jun 7 03:00:23 2015 UTC,This is why it usually just comes out to a deci and Soontir. Bump the pilot up in the deci and throw on upgrades. And that's still a better strategy for survival than adding more ships IMO.  /u/podsyboy121
XWingTMG,38ukdl,wafer_thin,2,Sun Jun 7 04:49:01 2015 UTC,"I've seen more of Vader lately as a counter to the decked out Soontir. Easier just to burn him in 2-3 attacks than try and punch through stealth device. I agree with /u/justsomeguyorgal - if it's arc-dodging stealth devices you're worried about, put Vader on the Decimator since it has a turret and higher HP."
XWingTMG,38ukdl,rlcode,2,Sun Jun 7 00:45:39 2015 UTC,"I fly a variant of this:  Oicunn + Engine Upgrade @ 46 OGP + Vader @ 24 Turr Phennir + PTL + AutoThrusters @ 30    I'll also vary whether I do the engine upgrade or a stealth on Phennir. The fact is, however, that with Vader AND Oicunn, you can slam a TON of guaranteed damage. I've taken out Lukes, Whispers/Echos, and Fels first turn. The jousting power if the shuttle is HUGE, he's a decent blocker (first rounds of course), and more importantly, he sucks up the damage that would normally go to the Decimator. This is why I don't put the Vader on the Deci--it makes the Decimator too large of a target. If you don't put Vader on the OGP, then why is it there? It loses value, and doesn't provide an opponent with any tough choices. NO one with any skill will fire on it--they'll dance around it, and then mop it up later.   I LOVE Soontir, but after Vader and Oicunn get done with things, I don't need a 9 pilot skill. But Turr is fantastic at Arc Dodging, and can turtle up if need be.   I LOVE this list, as it really provides me with TONS of options--a good jouster, a solid turret, a good arc-dodger, and TWO forms of guaranteed damage."

XWingTMG,38tebi,Stetto,4,Sat Jun 6 17:34:49 2015 UTC,"I take VI on Turr.  Bumps him up to a 9 PS to compete with the rest of the high PS meta and he can still get a boost and barrel roll (albeit at the ost of focusing or evading) by doing the first as his normal actino than the second after he attacks, which can let him get a shot then dodge arc for the return shot if you're set up right."
XWingTMG,38tebi,VanderLegion,3,Sat Jun 6 17:59:38 2015 UTC,"I don't fly Imp much, but I really like trying to make Tetran work.  Outmaneuver is a good look I think, as is SoT.  It'd be really nice if he had a ship with Wingman sticking closeby, so he could constantly zip back and forth without having to clear stress every other round.  Maybe a shuttle or Deci so he can sort of play the escort role to that ship.    Either way, I like people thinking outside the box especially with established metas like PTL Interceptors."

XWingTMG,38tebi,Bricked637,2,Sun Jun 7 07:05:50 2015 UTC,"Yes, it does. But then you're stressed afterwards.  I'd prefer using a favorable range three maneuver and then switching to k-turns as needed. In this case, you end up stressed as well, but you have the option to remain unstressed.   That said, the way you suggested it, you'll end up with a lot more options overall."
XWingTMG,38tebi,Bricked637,2,Sat Jun 6 20:17:40 2015 UTC,"But if Stay on Target triggers, doesn't the mover gain a stress token anyway?"
XWingTMG,38tebi,Bricked637,2,Sun Jun 7 07:05:29 2015 UTC,Correct. My point was that you could stick with the original maneuver to remain unstressed.

XWingTMG,38sl5w,LukesandLadders06,7,Sat Jun 6 13:27:17 2015 UTC,"Depends on how you want to fly it.  You've got 2 issues, the crew, and the support.  You need to ask a few questions:   Do I need the extra point? Will I miss the free focus? Will I use the 3 and 4 green straight from Nien (while stressed, because otherwise it doesn't matter) enough to offset the missed focus from Kyle? Do I want Xs or Bs (or something different)?   The first 3 questions come down to your flying style with Dash and your tactics as the battle progresses, the last one is an opinion and a strategy question.  The Xs can keep up with Dash better (+) making formation flying and support a little easier (+), and they hit just as hard (=).  They also live 2/3 as long (-), and are not as maneuverable in tight (-), and lack a barrel roll (-).  The Bs have about 1-2 more attacks worth of survivability (+) to make them better able to stand on their own (because they will have to, they can't keep up especially with Dash running 3 and 4 straight a lot (-)).  This allows Dash to dance off on his own, potentially splitting your opponents forces (+), or at least forcing a tough decision (+).  The Xs can better keep up with Dash (particularly without Nien) to provide a closer support (+), give you some orchestrated attacks (+), and cover the doughnut if that is a problem for your list (+).  If you choose to split the Xs off from Dash, a lot of people will ignore them because they're Xs and people underestimate them too easily (+).  You can use that to your advantage, and flank with the Xs which hit just as hard as Bs (=); and if no one is shooting them, their marginally reduced survivability compared Bs is moot.

Plus i like the x wings because they tend to have a friendlier dial than the b's and still output some damage.  But, Nien will let you fly away while getting rid of that stress, which is good with Outrtider+HLC. Also the B's may not have a gr8 dial, but they can still barrel roll. That for me is huge. In the end, the extra defense dice isnt worth the extra health and the ability to barrel roll. So I guess Nien.  I'll have to try this"
XWingTMG,38sl5w,ernesto__-,1 point,Sat Jun 6 16:34:38 2015 UTC,"Are you using PTL on Dash? Because Katarn works well with PTL on the 2400 from what I've seen. If you have Engine on there too, even better. Spend actions on arc and range-dodging and still have that focus.  As for the two X's or B's - I don't like either. I think the 2400 does best as a two-ship build. If I had to pick, I'd go B's if these are generic pilots."

Part of the complaint is that a generic naked x-wing is too expensive for what you get compared to, say, a naked b-wing.  I'd prefer to see a free title that makes them better in some way without requiring you to then spend MORE points on other upgrades.  Edit: And as /u/towmule pointed out, seems a bit overpowered.  For your suggestion, maybe only sharing the effets on non-unique astromechs?"

When's the last time you saw a tournament won with a squad made just of Tie Advanced, Interceptors, Firesprays, Shuttles, HWKs, bombers, ewings, defenders, decimators, 2400s, scyks, starviper? Some of these are not what you would consider underused ships.  There was a time not too long ago that Wes+VI, Wedge+Opportunist, Luke+Opportunist placed top 4 in a large tournament (just before wave 4).  You don't want multiple R3A2s, R2D2s, etc. on a squad.   The X wing is underused because it is a glass cannon that can't arc dodge. It is a relic of the conservative wave 1 design philosophy and needs a very delicate and precise ""fix"" because some of its named pilots are still good despite being in Xwings."

XWingTMG,38olc8,PCGamerPirate,6,Fri Jun 5 15:53:19 2015 UTC,"Problems:   Black Sun Vigo and Black Sun Enforcer are too expensive to run without upgrades for what you get (too little health, mostly. Compare to a B-Wing) Black Sun Vigo/Enforcer don't have enough upgrade slots to do interesting stuff with them, but they also don't have high enough pilot skill to equip Virago. Guri and Xizor both cost a lot of points when loaded up with upgrades, but they don't quite have the pilot skill to be truly effective. Creating a pilot with PS 8 or 9 would be a bit of an insult to Xizor - he should be the most 'skilled' StarViper pilot, since it was built for him personally.   Solution: we need a PS 4 pilot who can equip Virago, be effective despite his low PS, and costs meaningfully less points than Guri.  I give you Mortensen.   28 Points Pilot Skill: 4 Upgrade slots: Elite Pilot Talent, Torpedo Pilot ability: ""When an enemy ship declares you the target of an attack, if you have no Focus tokens, you may assign 1 Focus token to your ship.""   Mortensen would be less dependent on positioning than Guri or Xizor. The guaranteed focus token when he gets attacked means his 3 defense dice will work harder for him, making it much safer to joust. Of course, if he doesn't end up needing the focus on defense, then he's got it to spend on offense, which improves his action economy for attacking. Slap Virago on him and take something like Fire Control System for offense or Sensor Jammer for even more tanking.  Also, 10 bonus internet points if you can guess where I got the idea for the name."

I would argue that this isn't necessarily true.  He's a Crime Lord, he doesn't have to be the best pilot in the galaxy, he has other people that can do stuff for him that need superb pilots.  And just because the ship was built for him personally doesn't mean someone else can't be a better actual pilot in it.

I have to give it a downside for flavor and power reasons. Flavor, a different company in the lore picked up the StarViper blueprints and started mass producing them with different specifications. Power, it adds a little attack power and role to the generic StarVipers. They now excel in taking out high shield ships while still being the same against no shield ships. I had to take away the mobility actions to symbolize the difference in the two companies making the StarViper. I also don't want Guri or Prince Xizor taking this modification since they really don't need a boost in power compared to the generics."
XWingTMG,38olc8,Team-Hero,2,Fri Jun 5 21:52:44 2015 UTC,I would never take this on a PS 1 or 3. You need the boost - barrel roll to be an effective blocker. And you are less likely to shoot do to a higher PS pilot killing you.
XWingTMG,38olc8,lsop,4,Sat Jun 6 02:46:54 2015 UTC,"wow, OP. I just ripped the wookiepedia page too. ahhaha  http://imgur.com/ThiLiqI  http://imgur.com/kIeXXTX  I ran mine as illicit, but imperials made them, so idk. Bombs makes sense and it could make the Viper more playable...maybe. I see it working LIKE bombs, but with more style BUT greater potential for failure.  You would drop droid icon, make your moves. At activation end, you roll (for sake of conversation) 5 attack dice. Buzz droids, go!   Blanks - Dud droids   Zann used old droids. No warranties!   Focus - Increase swarm range distance +1 (3 Max)   Default, their search for enemy ships at range 1 from the deploy token. Each focus extends their range by 1 up to a max range of 3. Fly, my pretties!   Hits and Crits - 1 Damage Card   For damage, each die with a hit/crit can be applied to ANY ship within the swarms range. If that ship does not have a damage card or only has crit damage, it takes one face down. If it does have a damage card, flip one face up. Circumvents shields.  Example: We make our moves and I deployed my droids. After said moves, your Decimator is range 2 from my token. I roll five and get 1 Focus, 1 Blank, 1 Crit and 2 Hits. So, I would hit you, you get a face down. hit you, flip that first card face up. finally, hit(crit) you again and you are dealt a face down."
XWingTMG,38olc8,Fruhmann,2,Fri Jun 5 16:54:21 2015 UTC,Hilarious!  But what do your buzzdroids do?

XWingTMG,38olc8,ithaka21,4,Fri Jun 5 17:14:16 2015 UTC,"Having only used it a few times, the star viper doesn't feel to provide enough of an anchor to lists. it doesn't seem to work as well as a flanker, and the Virago ends up being a big point investment into a pseudo jousting/arc dodger.  I think an upgrade should better define it's role, perhaps a   Enhanced side thrusters (star viper only), modification. Perform a free barrel roll using the banked 2 templates instead and receive a stress. 3 points.   also a unique ordinance might be cool. such as the StarViper Missile. 4 pts.

XWingTMG,38olc8,EdgeOfDreams,2,Fri Jun 5 16:24:25 2015 UTC,"pseudo jousting/arc dodger   I think you finally put into words what I couldn't explain about the StarViper. It's trying to be a hybrid between a jouster and a dodger and it ends up just barely failing at both. It needs either just a touch more HP to be a better jouster or a pilot with higher pilot skill  and a good pilot ability to be a great arc dodger (imagine Guri at PS 8, for example)."
XWingTMG,38olc8,Audionautical,3,Fri Jun 5 16:41:21 2015 UTC,It would probably also need a better dial to be a competitive arc dodger because it doesn't have enough green moves to really pull off PtL.
XWingTMG,38olc8,Burius81,5,Fri Jun 5 16:59:10 2015 UTC,"+1  I've been trying to work out how to run the ship since the best pilot is PS7 and it doesn't have any great green moves.  I'm not taking PTL on Guri at PS5 since I'm definitely not arc dodging and don't have evade to turtle.  Xizor is in a similar trap at PS7, I can take PTL but it isn't going to help against PS8+ ships which there are a lot of so I take VI to at least be able to barrel roll/boost into a slightly better position and shoot earlier.  I ran it last night in this list: http://xwing-builder.co.uk/view/262239/xizor  I have the Black Sun Z because I only have 1 Most Wanted set right now.  I flew in a block formation with a little bit of separation but had Xizor in range 1 of something at all times.  My opponent was running a casual list: Cracken with Swarm Tactics and Shield Upgrade, 1 Tala, 2 Red Sq X-Wings with EU and R7s(can spend a target lock to force your opponent to re-roll any or all attack dice)  It came down to full health Xizor vs 2H/0S Tala and I won without a problem.  I think Accuracy Corrector will be a must have on my Starviper.  I can save Focus for defense since I know I will get minimum 2 hits every time I fire, or I can boost/barrel roll out of arc or into a better position.  The Starviper's greens are predictable.  We need natural PS8, PS9 pilots possibly with movement based abilities."
XWingTMG,38olc8,VanderLegion,2,Fri Jun 5 17:40:19 2015 UTC,"I flew Xizor with the accuracy corrector the first couple games I used him and found that it wasn't worth the points for me.  Don't think I triggered it a single time.  I prefer either AS/Predator (so you can get actions before sloops or just boost or barrel roll before maneuver if desired, or action before bump) or else VI/FCS.  The second gets you to PS 9 which is more useful against the high pilot skills meta currently and still gets you TLs from FCS.    The predator version goes well with Torkhil since you get 2 rerolls against whoever you drop to 0 PS."

Accuracy corrector kicked in at least four times and for a few of them I could have spent my focus token but since I was in arcs I saved it for defense and it worked out well for me.  That being said I am going to have to try Advanced Sensors + PTL and Advanced Sensors + Predator (w/ Torkhil.)  I took a HWK in my list for the ICT+Greedo combo and Torkhil over a Spice Runner just to have an extra wrench to toss in my opponent's gears.
XWingTMG,38olc8,VanderLegion,1 point,Fri Jun 5 20:30:07 2015 UTC,"Part of the reason I haven't felt the need for Accuracy Corrector is that most of the time I've played Xizor has been with Predator.  With the reroll (s) you have pretty good odds of getting 2 hits even without the focus.  Even more so on subsequent shots with FCS to have target locks.  Personally i don't like PTL on xizor.  You don't have an evade to double token to tank up for defense, and you don't have good enough greens (no green turn especially like the interceptor/a-wing) to be able to use PTL every turn without being super predictable.  And I don't bother saving the focus for defense.  In my experience as long as you have Xizor in range of other allies, he pretty much gets ignored anyway."
XWingTMG,38olc8,EdgeOfDreams,1 point,Fri Jun 5 20:34:58 2015 UTC,"That's true. If it had a green hard turn like the Interceptor and A-Wing do, it would be much better at arc dodging."

Had enough maneuverability to approach from a vector to get Outmaneuver to work, and in range one it hits hard.  The rest of my list managed to ion Vader, whom Guri had a target lock on, and Guri slid into range one and out of his arc, got the focus from her power, and hit him hard for the kill."

XWingTMG,38olc8,VanderLegion,2,Fri Jun 5 17:43:25 2015 UTC,"Having only used it a few times, the star viper doesn't feel to provide enough of an anchor to lists.   Personally I've found that Xizor works great as an anchor.  Fly him with several other ships in formation that he can pass damage to and he pretty much gets ignored.  I'm currently running him with 2 warthogs and a naked pirate.  If they go head to head with me I have two 8 health y-wings with 2 attacks each, the pirate for some blocking (the Ys can do that too if needed) + Xizor.  It's actually worked well so far me in the games Ive used it."
XWingTMG,38olc8,gammon9,2,Fri Jun 5 20:30:14 2015 UTC,"This is an interesting one. Overcosted by a few points, but generally speaking a powerful ship that just needs to find a home. Preferably a home that feels suitably Scum.  Here are a few ideas for Virago:  Gyroscopic Adjusters  System. 1 pt  When you reveal a K-turn or S-loop maneuver, you may rotate your dial to any other K-turn or S-loop.  Scavenger Sub-system  System. 2 pts. Scum only  When a friendly ship at range 1 is destroyed, you may discard one damage card or recover 1 shield.  For generics:  Crackle Torpedo  Torpedo. 1 pt. StarViper only  Attack (focus): Attack a friendly ship with this attack. If the attack hits, cancel ALL die results and deal 1 damage to the defender, and 2 damage to all enemy ships at range 1 of the defender.  Range 2-3, 3 attack."
XWingTMG,38olc8,Thatcardassian,1 point,Fri Jun 5 16:27:36 2015 UTC,"I have used the starviper to win several store tournaments. It is an amazing and heavily underutilized ship. You have to build it as a DEFENSIVE arc dodger/jouster. How? Take a look:  Two ship build:  59 points Boba Fett   Firespray-31 Outmaneuver, Seismic Charges, Gunner, Inertial Dampeners, Andrasta, Engine Upgrade, Proton Bombs  41 points Guri    StarViper Push the Limit, Virago, Autothrusters, Sensor Jammer, Inertial Dampeners  With Sensor Jammer (another HIGHLY underrated card)+auto thrusters, Inertial dampeners , Guri's free focus and Push the limit it is a rare day in Hell when it can actually be hit, and even then it is more survivable than an interceptor with it's greater hull value and a shield. You can use it to chase down Dash Rendar/Fat Han while everyone gives up trying to shoot it down and instead focuses on Boba, who is also pretty resilient."
XWingTMG,38olc8,VanderLegion,2,Fri Jun 5 19:55:00 2015 UTC,"I've also had great luck with the StarViper in tournaments, albeit with Xizor instead of Guri (havne't actually used guri yet).  I load him up with virago, advanced sensors, predator, autothrusters, dampeners depending on the build.    Xizor doesn't need to be built as defensively since people tend to just not shoot at him in the first place due to his ability.  That means he generally stays at full health while they shoot at the rest of the squad and I work on killing their stuff.  That means that by the end game, I end up with a full hp Xizor against whatever my opponent has left, and xizor makes a great finisher.  More recently, I've been trying VI/FCS instead of predator/AS.  It's also worked out well, though VI really depends on what you're up against for whether it makes a difference."
XWingTMG,38olc8,Burius81,1 point,Fri Jun 5 20:04:47 2015 UTC,Sounds good!  I haven't tried PTL on anyone below PS7 because I'm not sure how to fly it and I haven't put it on the Starviper because of the limited green moves on the dial.  Any more insight in to how you fly her?
XWingTMG,38olc8,Thatcardassian,1 point,Fri Jun 5 20:10:46 2015 UTC,"If you're fighting a heavy laser cannon or any turret move in to range band one with boosts and/or barrel rolls (behind the enemy ship) and, if you can, target lock; you'll be getting a free focus anyways, and you want to hurt them. Otherwise stay at range band 3 and green maneuver+boost to stay at range; the autothrusters and the sensor jammer together will do the defensive work for you. You want to avoid being at range band 2, that's where things start to hurt. Bait your opponent's heavy hitters with Boba Fett or another large ship; they can't ignore Boba's Outmaneuver+4 dice and gunner or some such at range band 1, and it is usually a more tempting target anyways. People tend to underestimate the Viper since it is a 'dark horse.'  If you're up against interceptors or B-wings You can afford to joust with them at range band 3, they also won't likely hit since they are usually boosting/barrel rolling and don't have an extra focus to spend: this is where the sensor jammer shines.   The hardest ship to fight for the Guri-Viper in my experience is the Phantom. Hard to predict where it'll be, and often they come equipped with tacticians to throw a stress on you at range band 2. Use Segnor's loops if you can to keep them in your firing arc and out of theirs."

At PS 3, he's got just high enough a pilot skill to fire before most swarms, but his ability - when combined with an R7 astromech - makes him a very annoying target for the higher-PS enemies as he can force them to waste their precious shots."
XWingTMG,38pomv,3rd_Charmer,4,Fri Jun 5 20:26:54 2015 UTC,"Well I'm very excited about Lt Colzet, but for someone that is out now, Tarn has a nice ability for the same cost as the PS4 x-wing, and if you pair him with an R7 astromech you can usually mess up one attack on him per round.  He's pretty hard to kill as X-wings go."

Etahn is only PS 5 but with an outstanding ability.  One of my favorites is PS4 Roark Garnet.  Handing out an automatic 1st attack each round to a low PS with a strong attack is really great.    Oh and durr: Oicunn."
XWingTMG,38pomv,KTreu42,4,Fri Jun 5 21:05:53 2015 UTC,"Torkil Mux and Guri are 2 of my favourites if im running the Hwk or SV, in casual play ofc.  With Torkil his PA really devalues those ships that cost way more due to having high PS and running him with an ion turret isn't very overpriced, he can be just annoying enough to take aggro while my Ywings do work. Also even though he is on 3 PS he is almost always going to beat which ever ship he is competing against in terms of PS bidding which i find funny.  Guri getting a free focus makes getting up close enough of a deterant and i like to give her auto thrusters so the only place she is very vulnerable is range 2 in arc, i think an ability that gives you aggressive and defensive options at close range is very good game design wise."

XWingTMG,38qotc,G3NECIDE,4,Sat Jun 6 00:24:05 2015 UTC,"I had a lot of trouble with this early on.  My GENERAL rule of thumb is kill the small ships.  They are easier/quicker to take down if you can focus them with multiple of your ships, and they generally hit just as hard as the big ship. So, eliminate the stuff that can damage you as quick as possible, then you're taking less fire each round.  When you focus the big ships, you have to chip away over several turns usually.  Meanwhile, you're getting outmaneuvered and ripped up by the small ships.  But of course, individual squads/flow of game/situation dictates everything."

The big ship is usually worth more points, and your likely to knock the same amount of health off per turn either way. The only major set-ups that tend to disagree with this methodology are super fat han (Han solo, R2d2, C-3p0 (Most people don't fly him except in tournaments)), and also when the big ship has significantly more agility than the small ship. (Agressor and 2 Y-wings for example)"
XWingTMG,38qotc,BrandCAG,1 point,Sat Jun 6 05:10:35 2015 UTC,"In my opinion, to answer this question, ask another: which enemy ship don't you want to be fighting during the late game when you may have lost two or three of your ships? Use this as a guiding principle for target selection, all else being equal... but don't pass up any great opportunity should it present itself during the game, even if it doesn't conform to your original plan."
XWingTMG,38qotc,1_73,1 point,Sat Jun 6 08:11:31 2015 UTC,"This also depends on the time limit. In a soontir vs. decimator game for instance, I would hate to have to fight soontir in the end game.

XWingTMG,38qotc,rottinguy,1 point,Sat Jun 6 13:43:16 2015 UTC,"I usually focus on the larger ships first. I find that if you leave a large ship (like a decimator) until the later part of the game, you will have lost some of the guns you need in order to take it down. It is much harder to take a large ship down in the end game, than at the start due to attrition."

Since we now have a few more ships to Pew-Pew around the kitchen table (mistakes have been made, to follow the pop expression, although I'm pretty happy with it and so is my kid so I don't think serious mistakes were involved), both the Y and the Advanced have fallen off our respective priority lists. There are however mitigating upgrades in existence or in the pipeline for these ships.  TL,DR: If you just want to have fun now with a few ships then I second the advice above. Falcon/Slaver or Aces/Aces. No way of going wrong there.

XWingTMG,38ptaf,Zombane,1 point,Sat Jun 6 00:06:40 2015 UTC,"How did you get a double evade? You can't take the same action twice. You can focus, then get a free focus token for being stressed however."

Stress and ion are the best ways to make him predictable.  Or you could go with Ten Numb with VI and Mangler which allows you to move after Soontir and basically auto-crit him."
XWingTMG,38ptaf,VanderLegion,1 point,Fri Jun 5 20:44:53 2015 UTC,"Ya, I didn't double evade. I just wasnt thinking when I typed this out. Ten Numb would be a good choice. I will have to try it out next time because I am sure someone else will roll Fel."

Sure you can have y-wings out there (though outside kavil I'd probably end up using the title) or HWKs if someone really felt like it, but again, that's what autothrusters are for.  That and the small ship secondary turrest are range 1-2 so Soontir can theoretically keep to range 3 as much as possible so they don't get shots anyway."

XWingTMG,38lpfd,GreenHoodyMD,1 point,Fri Jun 5 15:43:16 2015 UTC,"As funny as this scenario is, it shows how broken the MoV system is.

XWingTMG,38lpfd,starslinger72,1 point,Fri Jun 5 17:18:34 2015 UTC,"well in the current system all init bid points are attached to the last ship on the board.

While MoV isnt  the greatest, its way better than the old SoS system they used, at least now you have some control over your tiebreakers."

XWingTMG,38kweq,Lyianx,4,Fri Jun 5 05:48:20 2015 UTC,"Got tired of reading posts about people and TO's not knowing how to describe the obstacles for tournaments and in recaps.  So I took a shot at naming them for ease of reference.  Asteroids   1. Domed - It looks a little like the Legion of Doom HQ, so domed it is. 2. Eyelet Jawa - Wanted a name that described the hole in it.  ""Holey"" sounded bad.  Could go with keyhole here too, but didn't like it as much. However MeisterD2 noticed that if rotated it looks like a Jawa, which is way cooler. 3. Kirby - This one looks like a round blob with arms, hence its Kirby. 4. Trollface - Oriented the asteroid so you could all see the face, like I always do. 5. The Big One - This one already was named by everyone everywhere. 6. The Turd / Deuce - It just looks like it.  Especially cats', which I own.   Debris   1. Zig Zag - Was going to call this 'Z', but it doesn't look like it as nicely.  Could also call this the Pawn, since it kind of looks like a chess piece. 2. B-wing - Broken off B-wing piece in the debris. 3. The Blotch - Nothing really distinguishing about it, but it looks like a shirt stain. 4. E-wing X-Wing - Broken X-wing in the debris. 5. The 'L' - Clear shape of the debris.  I didn't use ""Tie Fighter"" since there are 2 debris that have that ship in it. 6. The 'Y' - Clear shape of the debris.  Same reason not called Tie Fighter as up above.   So there I took a stab at it.  I'm willing to hear alternative names, but I figured we should start somewhere.  Getting tired of not having names for them.  EDIT: Updated with suggestions.  EDIT: Adding ""Deuce"" as an alternate name for the turd, so if a TO ever wishes to use something like this they have a more family friendly wink-wink name for it."

XWingTMG,38okzt,BrandCAG,5,Fri Jun 5 15:54:13 2015 UTC,You are correct as the auxiliary arc rules state that the a secondary weapon uses the standard firing arc unless stated on the upgrade card. You can find the exact wording on page 2 of the FAQ in the sidebar.

If you're sticking with the same costs, Stay on Target + B-Wing E/2 + Intelligence agent, or Stay on Target + Fire Control System, are both excellent loadouts for him.   It's a pity you can't spare an extra point: SoT+Advanced Sensors is borderline evil on Keyan. The ability to target lock before changing the direction of flight to keep a firing arc on an enemy? And being given a stress to do so? It's delicious."

XWingTMG,38mi83,Enervata,2,Fri Jun 5 15:30:10 2015 UTC,"I like Farlander + Wedge in both set ups, they are both going to hit hard.  Tycho vs Jake, I'm taking Jake with VI and PTL every time.  That puts him at PS9 and after flying both Jake is more maneuverable and almost always has a focus.  The main problem I've had is that A-Wings don't have teeth.  I'm putting Proton Rockets on Jake to give him a sting.  Last night I ran Jake (VI, PTL, Autothrusters, Proton Rockets), Ten Numb (Mangler Cannon, Pred), and a Blue Sq (HLC.)  I came up against something a little odd: Roark, Katarn, Horn.  The Hawks both had ICTs which after the first scrum shut down Ten Numb for 3 turns and Jake for 1.  I got Horn to 1 hull but he buzzed off and regened.  Ten Numb, the Blue, and Roark went down, Jake used the Rockets and an extra shot to kill Katarn and then we had a problem.   I made him shoot at range 3 or not at all and he couldn't hit me, but I would have to get two hits through his defense 3 turns straight(he had 3S/1H but he would Green to regen shield with R2-D2, so -2, +1, -2, +1, -2 dead) and that wasn't going to happen.  We eventually both went head and neither of us got a hit even with double tap on Horn so we called it a draw.  If I had sent the B's after the Hawks first and saved the Proton Rockets for Horn I might have had a better shot.  TL;DR I like Jake over Tycho but A-Wings don't have enough damage stock, see if you can squeeze some Proton Rockets on there and save them for an important target, it will also take some heat off of Farlander and Wedge."
XWingTMG,38prfc,Petunia2t,3,Fri Jun 5 20:20:26 2015 UTC,"You know the proton bomb deals a faceup card to the hull straight through shields, right?  If it comes up 2 damage an E-wing is instantly dead.  Corran isn't really someone you want to fly against one on one though.  And tactician won't be useful unless Corran has PTL."
XWingTMG,38prfc,scuff,1 point,Fri Jun 5 20:24:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah but its not easy to land such an obvious trap, also my distance judgement blows :p  Tactician was a waste of 2 points, another seismic on Andrasta would have been better tbh.  I land the crit, but it was insubstantial and due to an asteroid balls up, she speed 5'd + boosted to a far corner then chugged around on greens before I could catch up for a few shields back."
XWingTMG,38prfc,antigrapist,3,Sat Jun 6 05:45:36 2015 UTC,The problem is that you're playing 51 point builds. Corren and R2D2 aren't nearly so bad at higher or even lower point values where horn can't take every upgrade he wants.

XWingTMG,38prfc,rottinguy,4,Sat Jun 6 05:46:36 2015 UTC,Are you sure you're playing it right? An e-wing that limits itself to green maneuvers to use R2 should be so predictable that he'd never get another shot at you while you tail it until it's dead.

XWingTMG,38m5v6,goldsz,4,Fri Jun 5 02:54:15 2015 UTC,"Yes so if you can shoot at biggs you have to meaning if you have a y-wing with a turret and no btl and a range 3 shot at Biggs you can't use your turret to shoot at another ship at range 1 of Biggs, you must use your primary.  Conversely, if you did have BTL in that situation you would shoot Biggs with your primary then could take a turret shot at his friendly ship that's range 1-2 of you."

XWingTMG,38m5v6,RDT2,3,Fri Jun 5 04:00:28 2015 UTC,"I would say yes to both, assuming you mean HLC on the IG88B"
XWingTMG,38m5v6,Winged_Gundark,3,Fri Jun 5 03:28:54 2015 UTC,"I think he's describing a situation where your IG88 is range 2 of the X-Wing and range 3 of Biggs (while the two rebels are R1 of each other).   In that situation, a HLC ranging 2-3 would be forced to fire on Biggs, as the card stipulation is ""if the attacker could target [Biggs] instead""."
XWingTMG,38m5v6,RDT2,2,Fri Jun 5 03:37:45 2015 UTC,Ah yes. I was thinking of if IG88B had a range one shot on Biggs and missed then he could use HLC to attack an another ship at Range 2 since he cannot target Biggs with the HLC.
XWingTMG,38m5v6,rsixidor,1 point,Fri Jun 5 03:54:22 2015 UTC,"If you swap the position of the two ships and use HLC then that is still correct since you have to use the cannon for the second shot, assuming you missed Biggs at range 1, which is unlikely."
XWingTMG,38m5v6,VanderLegion,2,Fri Jun 5 13:46:22 2015 UTC,I was actually thinking more like the autoblaster cannon so that the cannon doesn't have range on biggs
XWingTMG,38m5v6,Winged_Gundark,3,Fri Jun 5 03:59:39 2015 UTC,"IIRC, if you have an autoblaster shot at range 1 and bigs at longer range, you would have to fire your first shot at biggs, but if you missed and had B you could use his autoblaster to shoot somethig else after."
XWingTMG,38m5v6,ImNewHere05,2,Fri Jun 5 04:06:03 2015 UTC,"Where multiple attack options exist, you are required to attack Biggs where able.

But range restrictions, as with Autoblaster, IG-88B, and the BTL-A4 title, allow an attack with that secondary weapon. Gold is on the money with this one."
XWingTMG,38m5v6,towmule,1 point,Fri Jun 5 05:26:01 2015 UTC,"This is correct.  If IG88B has a cannon that can target Biggs, he must use that cannon. So, if he has a HLC and an Ion Cannon, he cannot claim to use the HLC and therefore not target Biggs who is at range 1."
XWingTMG,38m5v6,MythicalMothman,2,Fri Jun 5 16:26:06 2015 UTC,This is also correct.
XWingTMG,38m5v6,Winged_Gundark,3,Fri Jun 5 05:26:44 2015 UTC,"My understanding is that you always always have to target Biggs, to the point of even switching your weapon to get him in range. From the FAQ:   If the attacker has more than one weapon available, it must use a weapon that can target Biggs Darklighter, if possible, instead of any other ship at range 1 of Biggs Darklighter.   So you can't purposely pick a short range weapon to ignore him, and likewise I don't see how IG-88B or Gunner would let you ignore him either. BTL-A4 Y-wings are less clear cut, but it makes sense to me that the mandated weapon for each attack of the sequence means the turret shot could ignore Biggs if he's out of range.  Edit: Didn't see your comment about autoblaster on IG-88B... but yeah, it makes sense to me that his second attack requires a cannon so that could let you ignore Biggs."
XWingTMG,38m5v6,towmule,3,Fri Jun 5 04:33:05 2015 UTC,"Only when able -- if the secondary was a R1-3 Mangler, then there's likely no excuse for being able to attack Biggs"

XWingTMG,38m7md,blairbunke,1 point,Fri Jun 5 03:51:27 2015 UTC,"Well with you being so new not sure I should show you a whole squad and hope you can grasp the full concept of it or just show you a few load outs for ships that have had success in recent, large tournaments.  http://xwing-builder.co.uk/view/263020/sjnashy1  This is kind of an interesting squad, try to get Carnor into range 1 of enemy ships but don't fly him right into the face of a large swarm or anything, he can dodge 1 or 2 ships ok but not many more than that.  His ability will allow Vader to take advantage of opportunist some.  If you could get your hands on some proton rockets that would really be uber on this list.  http://xwing-builder.co.uk/view/263020/sjnashy2  This could do alright too, lot of bait and switch opportunities but again be careful to not let one of your glass cannons end up on the bad end of a firing gallery.  The thing about running interceptors is they struggle against large, 360 ships, which are really popular right now.  Autothrusters is almost a must have when you're flying them because of the popularity of large based 360 ships but I'd say these are 2 of your better options without having them."

XWingTMG,38m7md,Burius81,1 point,Fri Jun 5 22:48:32 2015 UTC,"You'll probably do okay with that list, but not great. Interceptors really shine the most when you use the best pilots and load them up with upgrades. Unfortunately, with only those few expansions, you don't have a ton of upgrade options, and you don't have Soontir Fel (Interceptor pilot) who is generally considered one of the best pilots in the game.  I would suggest you drop one of the two TIE Fighters and instead throw some upgrades on your Interceptors. Push The Limit is great for letting them both reposition (boost/barrel roll) and take a Focus, Evade, or Target Lock in the same round. Or you can do both a boost and a barrel roll together to try to totally outmaneuver your opponents. Shield Upgrade and/or Hull Upgrade are also worth considering so they'll last longer, especially against ships like the Falcon that have turrets you can't dodge out of the firing arc of.  For flying a list like this, you're going to want the two Interceptors to avoid directly flying at the opponent. Instead, they should try to use their maneuverability and boost/barrel roll to get out of the enemy's firing arc and hit them from the side or behind. Meanwhile, your one or two TIE Fighters (depending on how you decide to run things), can try to act as blockers who get in your opponent's way. Since a blocked ship gets no actions, you can really mess with your opponent's strategy that way. Darth Vader has enough defenses that he can attack more head on if you like, but if you do so, try to make good use of the Focus and Evade actions he has to keep him alive in the face of enemy fire."

XWingTMG,38jcrr,LiquidAether,4,Thu Jun 4 17:11:10 2015 UTC,"You basically check whether you can cancel after all dice modification is complete.  So you roll the dice, get an evade and a eye.  Spend a focus token and turn the eye to an evade.  Neither evade can be used to block the hits.  However if the attacker rolled any crits with the autoblaster, you can cancel those.  In a recent FAQ update, they changed it so that spending evade tokens counts as adding a die, and therefore cannot block autoblasters.  The same is also true for C-3PO.  In summary, you pretty much can't stop hits from an autoblaster."
XWingTMG,38jcrr,KTreu42,3,Thu Jun 4 16:47:22 2015 UTC,"It's a risky move, but Scum Boba + Autoblaster + Recon Specialist + Engine Upgrade or Expert Handling/Stay on Target (any maneuvering action) can net some great Autoblaster results.  3 dice, only usable in Range 1 which triggers Boba's reroll ability, plus focus tokens to flip the focus results to hits.  So you have a built-in Predator or Target Lock, plus focus tokens for both offense and defense.  You lose the 4th attack die, but shooting against 0 evade dice might make it worthwhile."

As long as the base doesn't touch at the end of the template, the move is legal. Whereas with an obstacle even the template is not allowed to cross the space rock.  (I'm the guy who posted the thread and hope I'm understanding this correctly. It's my hope that by trying to reply here and restating it, I'm solidifying my understanding of the rules).  Stop me if I'm wrong, but it appears cloak works the same way. No base touch at all. No template through obstacles. Templates can cross ships as long as the base clears at the end."
XWingTMG,38iif4,Barzhac,2,Thu Jun 4 18:23:37 2015 UTC,Imgur  Correct.  TIE Interceptor 1 is performing a legal boost here.  Tie Interceptor 3 is not
XWingTMG,38iscl,Rory_braker,11,Thu Jun 4 14:23:41 2015 UTC,"I've heard murmurings of people expecting another round of Aces packs for both Imperials and Rebels, with one updating Defenders/Bombers/Phantoms, and the other updating X-Wings/Y-Wings/E-Wings.  I seriously hope it's true, because not only do those ships need more pilot options, but most of them need tweaking due to the changing meta.  In particular, Bombers, Defenders and E-Wings are WAY too expensive, so if they introduce a 0 cost upgrade like they did for Y-Wings or TIE Advanced, it'd make that cost more manageable.  All speculation, though."
XWingTMG,38iscl,3rd_Charmer,5,Thu Jun 4 15:03:38 2015 UTC,I'm still clinging onto hope that any future release of Y-wing pilots comes out with a Horton Salm with an EPT. Egregious that the patron saint of the Y-wing doesn't have one.
XWingTMG,38iscl,justinsane15,4,Thu Jun 4 15:53:29 2015 UTC,"My greatest hope.  Salm is my favourite pilot that I have the hardest time fielding, and his lack of an EPT due to FFG's lack of foresight when developing Wave 1 ships (which the Y-Wing was a part of) stings to this day.  I did a playest of him with the leaked K-Wing turret (range 2-3, attack 3, attacks twice but does only 1 damage if it hits on each attack) with the droid that gives him a EPT and gave him Marksmanship.  Free rerolls on all attacks; all focus results for both attacks changed to hits thanks to Marksmanship.  He couldn't miss.  But if he had a droid to help him survive longer and not just to get an EPT that he should have by default, that would have been WONDERFUL."
XWingTMG,38iscl,3rd_Charmer,2,Thu Jun 4 16:23:08 2015 UTC,"Horton Salm w/ R2-D6, Marksmanship, Title, and Twin Laser Cannon. Focused and (basically) TL'd for all three attacks."
XWingTMG,38iscl,towmule,2,Thu Jun 4 17:59:23 2015 UTC,"They gave them a droid for just htat reason.  Super horton is stupid scary.  ICT, VI, Engine, and ept droid is a very powerful closer."
XWingTMG,38iscl,starslinger72,4,Thu Jun 4 19:20:43 2015 UTC,"Bombers are getting help with the new stuff in wave 7, the E wing is hardly in a bad place right now showing up all the time in high level builds and performing.  The defender is maybe a point or two over costed, and that is a very strong maybe."
XWingTMG,38iscl,starslinger72,6,Thu Jun 4 15:45:00 2015 UTC,"Well, it's only Corran showing up in high level builds.  The E-wing is not a good ship, Corran's pilot ability is just bonkers (and he has a nice suite of synergistic upgrade options)."
XWingTMG,38iscl,FunkyHat112,5,Thu Jun 4 20:07:13 2015 UTC,"Etan is also a solid ship in the right build, and the generics are expensive because they have both an astro mech slot and a system slot.  You pay for those slots even if you don't fill them.  The E-wing is a very good ship that comes at a hefty price for the stat line it brings."
XWingTMG,38iscl,starslinger72,2,Thu Jun 4 20:24:04 2015 UTC,"Etahn sees extremely little play - roughly 1/6th of Corran - and the generics see no high level play. The E-wing does indeed pay for slots it doesn't necessarily use. It pays 3-4 points for them. That is a lot of points to pay simply to have the option to pay more. Being a 'very good ship' and being efficiently costed are two innately tied qualities. Efficiently costed doesn't solely come down to jousting value, but the E-wing's only a bit above average on maneuverability and it doesn't have a turret. Its jousting value matters, and being an inefficiently costed jouster is not a good place to be. That's why the Defender and E-wing barely see play.   Corran specifically sees play for two reasons. One, it's more efficient to throw upgrades on good pilots than generics (and as mentioned the E-wing is a joke without its upgrades). Two, his ability is amongst the most powerful in the game. He sees play despite the ship he's on, not because of it."
XWingTMG,38iscl,FunkyHat112,1 point,Thu Jun 4 23:24:49 2015 UTC,"This is simply not true at all.  You would not see corran with his ability on an A-wing for example.  Its a combo of being able to have PTL and R2D2 for survival on top of FCS for great damage output that makes corran what he is.  Even an X-wing or B-wing would not be as successful as they would just be melted, much like wedge or farlander."
XWingTMG,38iscl,starslinger72,0,Fri Jun 5 01:16:24 2015 UTC,"Exactly like a defender or a  starviper. They are ships only played for their elite, not their generics."
XWingTMG,38iscl,Drag4n,1 point,Thu Jun 4 22:32:22 2015 UTC,"Delta defenders are solid, just under utilized currently.  People would say the same thing for sigmas yet they saw solid success at worlds.  Just because a ship has yet to be explored fully does not mean its a bad ship."
XWingTMG,38iscl,starslinger72,1 point,Fri Jun 5 01:13:18 2015 UTC,"I'm talking about what i see, not what i heard. And a list with 3 defenders, even with stealth or hull cant win a 3 BH list if played well, or the overused BBBBZ."
XWingTMG,38iscl,Drag4n,1 point,Fri Jun 5 12:32:04 2015 UTC,Well 3 defenders is 2 delta and pred Rex. Its actually solid and could give triple BH a run for their money. Regardless using only one ship type to decide if a ship is good is silly at best.
XWingTMG,38iscl,starslinger72,0,Fri Jun 5 14:26:23 2015 UTC,I think the generic E-Wings really are overcosted. They're totally unseen in competitive play.
XWingTMG,38iscl,Neuvost,5,Thu Jun 4 22:34:36 2015 UTC,I think the named Bomber pilots are the real victims: Rhymer is INCREDIBLY expensive when compared to a Punisher (even a named Punisher).
XWingTMG,38iscl,3rd_Charmer,2,Thu Jun 4 16:19:57 2015 UTC,Rhymer starts to become more cost effective when you can double his Ordnance with tokens...
XWingTMG,38iscl,thebaronvonanonymous,2,Thu Jun 4 23:06:07 2015 UTC,And the Adv Homing Missiles are just made for him. Range 2 only? Hell yes.

XWingTMG,38iscl,towmule,1 point,Thu Jun 4 20:01:33 2015 UTC,"I hope it's Y-Wings and Z-95 for rebels and Defender and Bomber for Empire. Both need more pilots, and if you're aching for an Xwing boost, it'll have new astromech options through the Y."
XWingTMG,38iscl,bl1y,2,Thu Jun 4 21:23:28 2015 UTC,"Astromechs seem the most likely way to address issues with X, Y, and E, as they're the only ones that can equip them. Titles aren't totally unlikely, but I suspect there could be another unique that grants an EPT slot, maybe a modification that replicates R2's close association with Luke's X-Wing (like granting an EPT or something). I also think that a cheap torpedo might change perspective on the X- or something that goes in the torpedo slot, like Chardaan Refit."
XWingTMG,38iscl,thebaronvonanonymous,1 point,Thu Jun 4 23:04:56 2015 UTC,Droid that makes a modification cost -2. Hull for 1. Shield for 2. Engine upgrade for 2.
XWingTMG,38iscl,bl1y,4,Fri Jun 5 00:28:46 2015 UTC,The new Advance abilities being brought in will be good support for Vessery.  I'll be running two advances with him as soon as it drops.  Even if you can't afford a raider the fact that it comes with 4 copies of the cards means that some people will be willing to sell them.
XWingTMG,38iscl,scuff,1 point,Thu Jun 4 14:28:05 2015 UTC,Yeah hadn't thought of that. Only one each of the pilot cards though?
XWingTMG,38iscl,scuff,1 point,Thu Jun 4 14:29:32 2015 UTC,"Those will be harder to come by for people that don't get it I'm sure (few people will get two Raiders.)    You can try and get them from Team Covenant singles, but those will probably sell out fast."
XWingTMG,38iscl,wer2,6,Thu Jun 4 14:39:33 2015 UTC,"The new Tie Modification may help Defenders some, but I feel they really just need more pilots. Vessery demands a specific list, and Rexler can be hard pressed to get his ability off (like Steele in the Tie Advanced pre-Raider). A couple of pilots in the 33, 34, and 35 point range with good abilities (less situational) could go a long way in helping the Defender."
XWingTMG,38iscl,Angerman5000,3,Thu Jun 4 15:06:44 2015 UTC,"Defenders really really really want PtL, but can't since they have such shit green maneuvers.  If the engine fix is good, it might save them, but their cost is still so high they probably do need some additional free upgrade like the advanced."
XWingTMG,38iscl,starslinger72,1 point,Thu Jun 4 15:18:53 2015 UTC,Defenders don't have the evade action so PTL is really meh at best on them.  Rex would like it for TL and using his passive with the focus but you can get close with predator and have your full dial open all the time.  Vessery has little use for PTL as he will have TL + focus on every shot anyway.
XWingTMG,38iscl,Angerman5000,2,Thu Jun 4 15:46:47 2015 UTC,"Being able to barrel roll and take another action is huge.  If they had good greens, they could get engine to boost and roll.  TL and Focus for Rexler would be a big deal as well."
XWingTMG,38iscl,starslinger72,4,Thu Jun 4 15:54:39 2015 UTC,They aren't interceptors and shouldn't be treated as such.  Sure having boost + roll on everything would be great but that is not what you are paying for with a defender.  You are getting a great stat line that can carry a cannon with a white K-turn.    If most people would stop trying to use them like a squint and more like a small based firespray (which is what they are) they would have a lot more success with them.
XWingTMG,38iscl,sacimino40,2,Thu Jun 4 15:59:06 2015 UTC,They are nothing like a firespray.
XWingTMG,38iscl,Angerman5000,0,Thu Jun 4 19:06:52 2015 UTC,"Except they're not really anything like a Firespray, and also the Firespray is pretty mediocre right now.  The white k-turn makes them play totally different"
XWingTMG,38iscl,Thopterthallid,1 point,Thu Jun 4 16:03:31 2015 UTC,"A PS 3 Firespray and a PS 3 Defender each cost 33 points, each have 3 Attack, each carry a cannon, and move somewhat similarly."
XWingTMG,38iscl,starslinger72,1 point,Thu Jun 4 21:36:33 2015 UTC,"They are exactly like a firespray...  They have a very close effective life pool depending on the attack of your enemy.  They are the main cannon carriers for the empire.  The white K-turn and the rear fire arc are basically the same thing, although it makes the defender the better cannon carrier. Imp firesprays are still fine right now and can have good lists build around them, Mangler Kath is solid.  Scum firesprays are very good.  Honestly the defender was a straight drop in for the firesprays as soon as they were released."
XWingTMG,38iscl,Angerman5000,2,Thu Jun 4 16:56:25 2015 UTC,"Agree to disagree I guess.  The white K-turn to me screams arc dodge since you could K-turn and still boost and barrel roll, which is unique."
XWingTMG,38iscl,PCGamerPirate,2,Thu Jun 4 17:05:21 2015 UTC,"K-turning is not an arc dodging maneuver unless your target is stressed, though.  An arc dodge works best coming at an angle as you can cover the most lateral movement towards an arc edge.  If the defender had a white s-loop, I'd be more inclined to agree to the arc dodging capabilities. However, a K-turn puts you closer to the center of arcs."
XWingTMG,38iscl,Angerman5000,1 point,Thu Jun 4 18:40:09 2015 UTC,"Sure, if you are going directly has to head all the time.  Any time you're not perfectly lined up it won't however."
XWingTMG,38iscl,Burius81,1 point,Thu Jun 4 23:01:30 2015 UTC,"I agree.  I think Rebel Y-Wings, E-Wings, Tie Defenders, and Tie Bombers all could use some new pilots to expand the uses of the ships.  Using some titles or modifications on some of these ships to either reduce costs or give them a little boost would also be helpful."
XWingTMG,38iscl,Angerman5000,2,Thu Jun 4 15:47:53 2015 UTC,"The new bombers all lacking EPT infuriatingly means that ordnance is still probably going to be in the gutter, except for bombs.  Spending yet more points on ordnance that will just miss was not the solution we needed for it.    The new bombers have a ton of HP though, the new upgrades are still largely unspoiled, and the new turret might shake up scum and rebel options some.  I don't think we'll see a huge shift in the meta, but there might be more options to fit the familiar roles, which would be very nice."
XWingTMG,38iscl,Enervata,2,Thu Jun 4 15:28:14 2015 UTC,I'm hoping the new turret finally gives us a Range 1-3 option.  Y-wings can't chase large turret ships with Engine Upgrade and/or boosts well.
XWingTMG,38iscl,PCGamerPirate,3,Thu Jun 4 15:43:43 2015 UTC,"If the reading of the spanish spoiler is correct:  Twin Laser Turret.  3 Attack. Range 2-3  Attack. Perform this attack twice. If an attack hits, cancel all dice results and the target suffers 1 damage.  6 points."

XWingTMG,38iscl,Angerman5000,1 point,Thu Jun 4 16:15:02 2015 UTC,"It does.  It's pretty well confirmed as range 2-3, 3 attack, but extra hits are canceled like an ion cannon.  But it shoots twice."
XWingTMG,38iscl,Azazel_The_Fox,2,Thu Jun 4 15:55:44 2015 UTC,"Twin turret on the R3A2 bot for sure. 3 stress at range 3? Legitimately OP if the spanish leak translation is correct.   My friends and I have proxy'd it many times. It's absolutely game breaking against anything but swarm. Two ship list, done. Arc dodgers, no chance.   It's bad enough that if they don't errata R3 to be only usable while not stressed I think you'll see the meta shift to swarms that don't care about stress.   In the 4 games I've used it personally, no arc dodger has lived after the third turn.  Pancakes are ruined completely. Even three ship lists are in huge trouble as you can basically shut down a ship for 3 turns. Kavil? Nope. Palob/Torkil? No blaster turret either.  Interceptors, auto loss.  Decimator usually dead in 3 battles at most. Phantoms get to play for 1 turn then are done. Corran is unusable.  Anything that relies on actions for usability, done.   List I used is 2 Bs with FCS, Biggs and Gold Squadron with twin laser, title and R3-A2.  Yeh yeh, the sky is falling is what I sound like, but I've tested it and it isn't fun for anyone."
XWingTMG,38iscl,starslinger72,2,Thu Jun 4 18:58:46 2015 UTC,R3A2 is already stupid to play against but isn't auto loss for good squint players.  You can get them past PS 8 and even then that is a stupid amount of points for stressing if you drop him on Horton.  You can manage it with Fel its just not a great match up.  He is one of the few that can deal with it though.  I agree that they need to do something about it as right now you can just have a gold flying around stacking up stress and dealing with way more than the 25 points its worth.
XWingTMG,38iscl,Azazel_The_Fox,2,Thu Jun 4 19:25:08 2015 UTC,"True, as of now. Proxy it with the Twin Laser and let me know how you feel then.  At the VERY least, you are basically automatically giving up one squint.  If you slow roll the gold, it's extremely easy to get Fel or anyone at the edge of range 3 and, you're not likely to hit that turn, but he will be quad stressed if he took one himself and its pretty much a death sentence.  26 points for a gold squadron to do this is insane."
XWingTMG,38iscl,starslinger72,2,Thu Jun 4 19:32:37 2015 UTC,"the turret doesn't matter either way, if you get in range at all its over with fel, you cant even have 2 stress and hope to live very long.  Its not much different from having to avoid a doom shuttle fire arc.  While it can be done, its still stupid to fly against and I hope to see it changed."
XWingTMG,38iscl,PCGamerPirate,0,Thu Jun 4 19:39:37 2015 UTC,"I think R3A2 is pretty much the only reason to run a rebel Y-wing these days though.  If R3A2 is as stupid as a doom shuttle, do you think both need nerfing in some way?"
XWingTMG,38iscl,thebaronvonanonymous,2,Thu Jun 4 22:05:35 2015 UTC,"R7-T1 and an Autoblaster Turret are fun on a Rebel Y as well.  I don't think either need nerfing, but I do think there might be new counters. I'm convinced that there's going to be something other than the slicers in epic play that weaponises a target's Stress. If there's synergy within a list that's one thing, but it'd also make an excellent counter to stressbot, whichever Lambda pilot, and Tycho/Soontir. Were it a mine or a bomb it would also bypass Agility die, which would really put the napalm among the pigeons."
XWingTMG,38iscl,starslinger72,2,Thu Jun 4 23:10:36 2015 UTC,"The doom shuttle at least causes damage to the carrier and is on a ship that can barely move.  A gold with title, ion and R3A2 does his job without throwing dice, just a better job if he happens to cause damage.  That is what needs to be addressed."
XWingTMG,38iscl,PCGamerPirate,2,Fri Jun 5 01:11:09 2015 UTC,The Defender is overcosted by 2 maybe 3 points. It is paying for its balanced stat line and that white k-turn. If you aren't making use of the white k (or the threat of the white k) the defender will not earn its keep.  Cool things the defender can do now:  1) Vessery is the most accurate gun in the game with painted targets.  2) HLC Defenders and Jonus (Jonus Brothers) is capable of eliminating a B-wing a turn.
XWingTMG,38iscl,MysteriousRacer_X,1 point,Thu Jun 4 15:27:50 2015 UTC,"Not sure Dutch is a good fit for R3 - A2. He will be double-stressing himself with the BTL title, and won't be able to take target locks and make use of his ability. I'd also consider R2-F2 on Biggs. He will likely only recover one, maybe 2 shields before he is off the board. The extra evade die should negate at list that many hits, and has the potential to do even more for less points than R2-D2. If you swap Dutch to a gold squad pilot, and swap R2D2 for R2F2, you have 6 extra points to play with. Also, Biggs is always useful, but the K Wing and the Y Wing are both pretty tough ships. They don't necessarily need the same level of protection as some of the other options out there."
XWingTMG,38kyzc,reverendmalerik,2,Thu Jun 4 22:01:18 2015 UTC,So I ran Kenkirk with Palpatine instead of Captive and it is fucking amazing. Throw in Soontir Fel and he is nearly impossible to hit if they shoot at him due to Sheev. Once you get that 5 damage on you he is so Elusive AND he gets a combat phase boost. Absolutely fantastic.

XWingTMG,38kl2e,dxsio,1 point,Thu Jun 4 22:21:40 2015 UTC,Agreed. With fire control already on and no PTL I think an engine upgrade is unnecessary.
XWingTMG,38kl2e,Copper_Lontra,1 point,Fri Jun 5 02:41:41 2015 UTC,I have played him several times and had trouble getting in Range 1 or out of enemy firing arcs only with barrel role (especially after the second shot when I try to get in a better position or recharging shields).
XWingTMG,38kl2e,OSouup,1 point,Fri Jun 5 06:36:33 2015 UTC,"No, this is the entire point of the list. You play this list at 99 so that Coran can go second and boost into range one against aces.   Dash doesn't need EU here because you should be focusing every turn to optimize lone wolf.  The point of the list is that nobody focuses Coran because that's stupid since he'll 5 straight and boost away then recover shields for a few turns. When focusing dash Coran has free reign to trail whatever is chasing Dash and blow them up.   Coran should be at range 3 from Dash all game and be able to boost to 1 to protect his doughnut if he needs to."
XWingTMG,38kl2e,baronsmeg,1 point,Fri Jun 5 08:48:24 2015 UTC,"I see what you're saying, EU has to go on one of these ships to get the list to 99.  Protecting the doughnut hole is important, but I figured that Dash can do that himself with boost/ roll.  However in this list both ships lack push the limit for double actions."
XWingTMG,38kl2e,OSouup,1 point,Fri Jun 5 12:36:42 2015 UTC,"It's that it expressly goes on Coran in this version so that he can close to the doughnut hole to shoot a ship at range one when he needs to, but stay outside of range 2 so that lone wolf works at all other times.   Dash is only PS 7 so he really can't boost out of, say, a Soontir that closes to r1, but Coran with VI can boost into r1 of Soontir to double tap him if he gets in the doughnut hole.   Also by playing at 99 you ensure Coran goes second against PS10s so he can boost to r1 in the doughnut hole against them and Dash goes second to barrel roll against PS 7s."

I would say that's a great start, your next wave should include Rebel/Imperial Aces, and maybe a normal Interceptor/A-Wing/B-Wing for some awesome pilots and upgrade cards.  After that, check out the E-Wing and Defender as solid small-ship backbones for your squads, they are expensive to field but very strong.   Then look into the Decimator and YT-2400, and..... aw hell, just buy all of it."

Where you go after that depends on what you're doing. If you're just going to play casual and provide all the ships for your friends, it's nice to buy evenly from both factions. If you're going to try tournament play, though, it's most cost-effective to focus on only one faction at first.  Try finding a local game store group that plays casually on a regular basis. If you can play against a wider variety of ships or even borrow ships to fly, you'll have a better idea of what's out there and what you might want to buy next."

XWingTMG,38jwxx,JediCheese,2,Thu Jun 4 18:38:35 2015 UTC,"You could get 2 a wings or 1 imperial aces pack (same price).  You only need one starviper (it comes with 2 autothrusters).  IG88 (or the colloquial term: brobots) is kind of a difficult build to start with because you have to manage so many upgrades and abilities.  Swarms are difficult to run because you have to overcome your low PS with superior positioning and blocking.  Big turret ships actually are among the ships that have to worry the most about positioning. The inefficiency of a large turret ship is quickly revealed if flown poorly. It has a low skill floor for moderate success, though."
XWingTMG,38jwxx,PCGamerPirate,1 point,Thu Jun 4 18:53:52 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the tip on A-Wings vs Imperial Aces.  I didn't know that Imperial Aces came with two copies of Push the Limit.  Ditto for the StarViper and two Autothrusters.  From what you are said about the various fleet types, would it be better to start off with a Decimator + Ties or one of the rebel freighter builds because they have a lower skill floor?"
XWingTMG,38jwxx,PCGamerPirate,2,Thu Jun 4 19:13:55 2015 UTC,"Make sure to check out the wiki to check for how many of each card comes in a pack: http://xwing-miniatures.wikia.com/wiki/X-Wing_Miniatures_Wiki  Since you are just starting out, you should try to run as many different archetypes as you can. You may find your playstyle and demeanor is not well suited for certain types of builds."
XWingTMG,38jwxx,EdgeOfDreams,2,Thu Jun 4 19:27:59 2015 UTC,"I recommend you start off just grabbing the core set and one or two ships you think would be fun to fly. Go see if the people who play at your store are willing to play casually with you and loan you ships and cards to play with. That way, you can get more experience with the game and different ships before you drop a bunch of money on one specific tournament build."
XWingTMG,38jwxx,liongrad430,1 point,Thu Jun 4 19:26:57 2015 UTC,"I would also grab an interceptor and/or B-Wing. Interceptors, like A-Wings,  have a forgiving dial and are good for learning boost/barrel roll for positioning. Not to mention you get Soontir Fel who can be the foundation of many imperial squads. Add this to imperial aces and you have 3 glass cannons to fly around.  The B-Wing is a good compliment to any rebel list as it is a tank and you xan mess around with the uniques like Ten Numb and Ibtisam."

I had a similar experience with Netrunner, the other FFG game I play. Tournaments for that see you playing 2 games in 65 minutes (one as runner, one as corp). Prior to that, my individual games standardly went about an hour, about twice as long as they should be.  I played with friends in my meta and we all agreed to speed up our play and familiarize ourselves with the game to be more comfortable with play. It took some games, but we got faster and faster until we were playing within the tournament time limit. I don't see this game any differently.  +1 on the above comment. Set the time limit and play.

I would think that continuing to play with a hard forced 75-minute rule (keep a timer visible) will gradually get you to play more aggressively or focused (ID the easiest kill, focus fire, etc.).  If the game keeps ending in a 0-0 draw, then the first person who can figure out how to force a kill wins."

XWingTMG,38iird,LiquidAether,1 point,Thu Jun 4 20:54:26 2015 UTC,"You go based off of points destroyed.  Only fully destroyed ships count.  Any upgrades count toward victory points, even if discarded.  So a Basic Z-95 with Concussion missiles will be worth 16 points, regardless of whether the missiles were fired or not.  If the points difference between the two players is less than 12 points, it's considered to be a modified victory, though that doesn't matter unless you're doing a series of games."
XWingTMG,38iird,Athole,3,Thu Jun 4 21:14:27 2015 UTC,and often times we wont have even lost a ship if theres a lot of A-wings or tie-fighters running around     Concentrating fire on the easier to damage targets helps a lot.

XWingTMG,38iird,Dakkon_B,1 point,Thu Jun 4 17:35:51 2015 UTC,"Focus fire, you should be able to kill a ship a turn or every other turn depending on dice rolls.   A-wings are hard to catch and kill but not impossible. Ties while having a high agility are super squishy due to no shields.   Also keep in mind how much time your both spending during the planning. If you are trying to shave down time make sure your not losing to much thinking. It's important to think thru your options but in any game you can lose A LOT of time just thinking about the same things over and over while going in mental circles. Try to set a timer of like 2-5 mins and see if you both can set up the dials in that time frame."
XWingTMG,38iird,Nomnomnicon,1 point,Thu Jun 4 18:21:18 2015 UTC,"Make more dangerous commitments to get more ships on target at range one - your ships have a sad pair of attack dice and at range 3 you'll be looking at going 2vs4 which is pants. TIE player should run Howlrunner, Backstabber and/or Mithel as they all benefit you when attacking.   My biggest tip is to commit to the attack with multiple ships. Sure, 1v1 A's and TIEs match up fairly evenly but if you get two or three at range 1 of the other craft you should get shields down at the least, and quite feasibly a kill.   This is all assuming you have no other ships. Anything with 3 Attack in your collection? Interceptors? X-Wings get slated a lot online for being work-horses but three of them can lay down a lot of hurt, especially at Range 1. B-Wings are a good alternative but aren't in the starter set so you might not have them."

XWingTMG,38h58x,Rockman_X2,4,Thu Jun 4 04:23:10 2015 UTC,"If you are talking about a pancake build with han and dash, or similar, then I did exactly this with your first list. But I swapped out FCS and intelligence agent for Rebel captive. (which ended up great because I NEVER attacked with whisper all game)  Essentially I took it slow, made sure I didnt stuff up.  The key is to pick one ship, the one that will be EASIEST to kill, and try to take it down within the hour. Don't worry about getting both, just take down one and turtle up so you win on MoV. If he is running FAT han or dash + Filler, then I recommend going for the Filler. You can easily take out 40-50 points of squad with your list. (The only exception would be if the filler is corran, then it is ok to focus fire the big ship).  The cloak on whisper and the autothrusters on the interceptors will save your life time and again. If you have to, take evades every turn, you may only average 1 hit every turn (or less), but eventually you will whittle those ships away enough without taking to much damage yourself.  If you kill half his squad and he takes out one of yours, then you win (with the exception that he takes out a 45 point whisper and you take out a 40 points).  The problem with this strategy is though, fat han is EXTREMELY good late game. So if you are left with 2 interceptors and he has a mostly full han, you are not going to be in a good position and you should try and run for the rest of the match.  Note, if you manage to catch han on a rock, or have all three at r1 and on his tail, then go for it. But usually han is at r2-3 and you only get a shot with 2 ships, so it is better to try and stay away from him and clean up the rest of the points."

Thx a lot for your attention and time. I learned a lot with your thoughts!"
XWingTMG,38h58x,BlueSapphyre,2,Thu Jun 4 04:59:42 2015 UTC,"What if the enemy chooses a Han+Dash (or any double turrets) build?   Based on the build of each, take down the easier target first.

XWingTMG,38h58x,antigrapist,2,Thu Jun 4 14:03:59 2015 UTC,"There are a couple things you can do. The first is to try dropping Turr/RGP and pick up a more durable support ship, probably a lambda. If you really want to beat Dash, you can put a rebel captive on Whisper, and if you want to beat han, either a gunner (so you can stack Focus +evade +cloak and become impossible to hit) or go with Sensor Jammer, as Han never takes a focus.   There are some big differences between Han and Dash lists, so you kinda have to tech more for one than the other."

XWingTMG,38h68o,antigrapist,2,Thu Jun 4 04:43:32 2015 UTC,"This is correct. Once you start measuring you've activated that ship. If you measure from a different ship, you have decided not to attack with the first and activate the second.  In a tournament though, if you tried to argue missed opportunity, you're an asshole.

XWingTMG,38ez40,Enervata,4,Wed Jun 3 19:45:35 2015 UTC,"Don't chase him. Cut him off. You've got to plan 2-3 turns in advance, and it's easiest to do this if you've got your ships in the middle of the board, rather than chasing him around the edge."
XWingTMG,38ez40,bl1y,2,Wed Jun 3 23:18:57 2015 UTC,One option is to drop the unhinged astros and go with a rebel version of the list. R3A2 really puts the pressure on dash and other aces even though the other rebel droids all really suck. You could spend the other points on bombs or flechette torps.
XWingTMG,38ez40,antigrapist,1 point,Wed Jun 3 19:59:47 2015 UTC,"Flechette Torps sadly don't work on Dash.  R3A2 on Rebels is one option.  For Scum it looks like the best stress pilot you could have is HWK w/Tactician, which seems a little unexciting and fragile.  I can't think of other tactics to try.  Maybe some Dash players have some advice."
XWingTMG,38ez40,antigrapist,1 point,Wed Jun 3 20:13:55 2015 UTC,I was just suggesting them as a possibility to fill the points that your unhinged astromechs used to fill. I think 4x ICT and R3-A2 should be enough to give you a decent chance against Dash.

XWingTMG,38ez40,OSouup,1 point,Wed Jun 3 20:11:24 2015 UTC,"I agree, terrible matchup for the Y's.  With a single boost he can out-move Y's running at full steam.  He often runs over an obstacle first just to dispirit you."
XWingTMG,38ez40,Angerman5000,1 point,Wed Jun 3 20:30:45 2015 UTC,A guy I play against a lot has started deploying 2 and 2 on opposite sides of the board to come in from two angles and set up bumps. The key is putting asteroids at corner positions so that dash is forced in to an inside ring or an outside ring.
XWingTMG,38ez40,Angerman5000,1 point,Wed Jun 3 21:08:34 2015 UTC,"I've been trying different asteroid layouts.  I assume that Dash brings 3 debris, which means you have at most 3 asteroids to place.  I've been playing that the Dash player throws any asteroids he gets his hands onto into the corners so it has minimal impact on him."
XWingTMG,38ez40,Angerman5000,2,Wed Jun 3 21:26:03 2015 UTC,"Cornering asteroids is silly as Dash.  You ignore them already, and can just boost or roll off of them.  Better to clutter the middle and force your opponent to deal with them."
XWingTMG,38ez40,DokerinZion,1 point,Thu Jun 4 11:47:00 2015 UTC,"But with the new rules, you both bring 3 obstacles.  Dash will bring 3 debris, you bring 3 asteroids.  It's a pool like before, right?  So the Dash player will grab at least 1 if not 2 of your asteroids and corner them."
XWingTMG,38ez40,DokerinZion,1 point,Thu Jun 4 15:47:17 2015 UTC,"They can assuming they have initiative, but I'm saying that dash placing them in corners is a mistake.  I also think bringing debris with dash is a mistake."
XWingTMG,38ez40,DokerinZion,1 point,Thu Jun 4 15:53:23 2015 UTC,"Really?  I would have thought debris would be ideal for Dash.  If he lands on it he still can shoot, and stress is a killer for so many builds.  I've been scrimmaging against a Dash + Corran build for practice by myself.  I set my dials, but don't determine his until after I move.  (Seems the only way to play against an ""ideal"" opponent, by choosing the best maneuver and assuming they can predict me.)  How should I set up Dash's asteroids to be more in line with typical Dash's?  (Triangle of death, loose inner ring, etc?)"
XWingTMG,38ez40,DokerinZion,1 point,Thu Jun 4 16:20:25 2015 UTC,"That's the common thought.  Asteroids however, Dash can roll off of no issue.  More importantly, against swarms, the asteroid actually prevents shooting and does damage, which is a big help.  Breaks the enemy up, etc.  The debris just prevents actions, and most good players aren't afraid of that if the have Dash cornered.  Honestly, both have merits, but I think the asteroids actively hurt your opponent, where the debris mostly just doesn't hurt you, if that makes sense.  I tend to set the asteroids up so that there's a couple clusters that can force enemy ships into awkward moves to try and follow.  Being able to dodge behind the asteroid wall is huge for keeping people out of your donut hole."

XWingTMG,38es6c,TyrannosaurusSex1859,2,Wed Jun 3 19:07:21 2015 UTC,"From my experience, Dash tends to leave the B-wings in the dust, or has to slow way down to stay with them (kind of defeating his point).  Coran is a little quicker, so has an easier time staying close to defend the doughnut hole against those looking to exploit it and has the threat of a double tap as a further disincentive.  Coran is also a very good late game finisher, so should the opponent focus everything on Dash, they might have a hard time finishing Coran off later. All in all, I think a lot of people use Coran because his playstyle has a lot of natural synergy with Dash, but with the right tactics, I bet you could get some good use out of a 2 B escort.  Personally, were I to run a 2B escort, I'd run Dash with PTL, EU, HLC, Outrider, and Nein Nub.  Lone Wolf and RecSpec have good synergy, but you can't use LW while the B's are close by (like they should be to defend your blindspot at range 1)."
XWingTMG,38es6c,Cant_remembr_usrname,1 point,Wed Jun 3 20:41:48 2015 UTC,"Lone wolf Dash/Coran is a little different than escort Coran. Lone wolf gives him fairly reliable green dice, so Coran is instead used to trail what is chasing Dash and take free shots.  I see you're point about Coran as a finisher though. The B's wouldn't have that, although they arguably have a little stronger consistent output."
XWingTMG,38es6c,Angerman5000,1 point,Wed Jun 3 21:12:10 2015 UTC,"IMO proton rockets on anything else but A-wings is a waste. Also, with an EU on Corran, you will need PTL. With that much action economy you will wish you had PTL on him. I agree with the doughnut hole problem, LW will not work well when you are trying to defend that sweet spot. Two ships are better than one at defending that sweetspot, at the cost of no defense."
XWingTMG,38f41k,Holmelunden,3,Wed Jun 3 20:13:41 2015 UTC,"It's A, because Vader's ability specifically says, ""During your Perform Action step..."" and Advanced Sensors says, ""Skip your Perform Action step.""

XWingTMG,38f41k,EdgeofCosmos,2,Wed Jun 3 20:54:40 2015 UTC,"Well, you could go for Maarek Stele with veteran instincts instead. That way you would have Vader's PS, a pilot ability that's not negated, and still come in at one point less than Vader.  Or, if you want PS 10, you can do VI on Juno, and get a higher PS than Vader at the same price and, again, still maintain the pilot ability."
XWingTMG,38f41k,LazyG,1 point,Wed Jun 3 21:52:22 2015 UTC,"But it is a bad idea because you shouldn't be in that position more than once, and for that you waste the system slot, when ATC and AC are both there."
XWingTMG,38f41k,3rd_Charmer,1 point,Wed Jun 3 22:02:06 2015 UTC,"It's certainly doable, but the reasons for it are debatable.  Advanced Sensors kinda has 4 main uses: getting your actions in before receiving a stress token, reacting to enemy positioning when you're activating a high-PS pilot, dropping a bomb before moving, or boosting/rolling out of the way of an obstacle.  For Vader, he almost NEVER takes stress as he gets 2 natural actions, he doesn't need Push the Limit or anything like that, and with an engine upgrade that gets him enough flexibility you don't need to do many K-Turns.  No bombs for TIE Advanced, so that's out.  If you fly well, you won't need to worry about running in to obstacles, with Vader you'll always have an action to spare to barrel roll or boost when you end your activation.  So the main reason you'd take Advanced Senors with Vader is to react to enemy positioning with Vader's high PS.  That'd get you 1 action to boost or barrel roll before to adjust where you end up, or anything else if it looks like you're going to bump.  Sure, it helps with ensuring your shot opportunity, but it means you DON'T get Advanced Targeting Computer, which makes each attack that much more potent.  With Predator, Vader will be a reliable damage-dealing machine with the ATC, as he can re-target lock and Focus in a single turn."

Weaponry usually consisted of two laser cannons mounted on the fuselage, where the proton torpedo launchers were located on the X-wing, though some mounted the X-wing's lasers on the fuselage and others retained one warhead launcher at the price of carrying only a single laser. A far superior variant was the X-ceptor, which used TIE interceptor solar panels and thus had an armament comparable to that of a standard X-wing. Like many other uglies, this ship was barely spaceworthy, and used predominantly by pirates, smugglers, and other cash-poor groups. Though capable of harassing unarmed commercial vessels, these ships could be destroyed en masse by a single true starfighter.

Are you having to field the whole set yourself and sharing with whomever can play?  Getting a second core set is a good idea -- gets you another set of dice, more ships and movement / range templates.  An additional XWing/Tie expansion will get you the remaining pilots, and now you have a nice Tie Swarm.  Then you can add on a Y/B/A and an Interceptor.  The Aces packs are good for that.  Make sure you get Push the Limit from somewhere, it's a very popular upgrade.    From there, get a Falcon and a Slave 1 :)"

If you can stick to one faction just buy them in order that you want, since you will probably end up getting them all. If you're imperial though I'd pick up tie advanced last as it's not that great. Imperial aces, the decimator and the defender are my most used ships/pilots."
XWingTMG,38eold,Dakkon_B,1 point,Wed Jun 3 18:44:14 2015 UTC,Is it using hte standard escalation rules as far as requiring 2 ships in the first list?
XWingTMG,38eold,VanderLegion,1 point,Wed Jun 3 18:54:57 2015 UTC,"Um... I have no idea actually. I just was told about the rules yesterday. (had to look up the normal rules for escalation cause I had no idea) The tournament is not for another month.  I assume other than the reduced point cap per round (since our local scene is small we will only get 3 rounds most likely) everything else is ""normal"" for this format."

XWingTMG,38bzla,achapin,2,Wed Jun 3 20:07:53 2015 UTC,"Here is my story about Debris.   I only recently got into X-wing (about 2 months now) played in my first tournament about 3 weeks after buying in an only had like 9 games played at that point. I did very well tho and took second. Only lost the final round to a double IG-88 list cause I have no idea how to fly vs them. But I heard stress was good vs them so I started using debris fields since my list doesn't deal out stress very well.  Fast forward to the next tournament I got lucky and never faced that IG-88 player but instead ended up playing the 2 best players at our local area (who consistently have beaten me). But this time I was trying debris.   First player nicked a debris field causing his Whisper to lose it's cloak which lead to me getting a shot that dealt a crit which was a Damaged Cockpit (zero pilot skill) which won me the game.  Second player nicked his Scum Fett on a Debris field and rolled a crit resulting in another Damaged Cockpit. 3 rounds later it boiled down to his Firespray vs my Defender. Both at 1 hull left but I got to shoot first at range 1. Rolled 3 hits and won the Tournament.   While I have no delusions that I didn't get insanely lucky at several points for those wins, the debris fields however gave me the chance to get lucky."

XWingTMG,38bzla,Shgrizz,1 point,Wed Jun 3 13:55:44 2015 UTC,There was a set of them that didn't fold down all the way that was the second print run of them.  It is very easy to open them up and clip a tab that is preventing them from getting all the way down out and you are set if you had one of those.  This was a year and a half ago when this was an issue though.

Thats how the top lists got to be top; they were repeatedly tested through trial and error.   Just think of something you'd like to try. It only takes a few minutes to compile a list.  http://xwing-builder.co.uk/
XWingTMG,38fh8u,BorisIHateReddit,0,Wed Jun 3 21:41:36 2015 UTC,I agree. I hate the posts that say give me lists. C&C? fine. But at least put the effort in to make your own so you can learn from what you could have done better.
XWingTMG,38dqxp,Loknar64,3,Wed Jun 3 15:35:01 2015 UTC,"This is a tough one. Hopefully you will eventually buy both. I actually flew the GR75 this past weekend.  It's a great support ship, but I used the Jam action more than anything. The CR90 lacks the Jam action. Toryn Farr also comes with the transport, and she can really bring the tears. I took her to boost my Predatunist A-Wings, but they ended up not needing her.  Slicer Tools are another good upgrade. However, these all cost a lot of points, and the GR75 only takes one action per round. Its ""attacks"" are passive (Slicer tools, Ion reactor). I haven't played the Hoth campaign mission, but it looks fun. It comes with another mission that requires 3 transports that I don't think I'll ever play. I've also had a lot of fun with the CR-90. I lost my first epic game with it (badly), but I overloaded it with upgrades, and forgot to use a bunch of them. Plus the new FAQ boosted its attacks. Defenders only get one extra defense dice beyond range 2 of the primary weapon. Players should pick a lane and either be aggressive, defensive, or supportive. Aggressive is the best bet, so take Weapons Engineer and maybe Han. The escalation campaign was very fun. The Rebels won all missions, but by the skin of their teeth. If I had to buy over again, I would still buy both right away, but when this question was brought up to the sub a few months ago, most voted for the GR75. If you're not going to get both right away, I would get that one first."
XWingTMG,38dqxp,mahthyoo,2,Wed Jun 3 17:14:43 2015 UTC,I love Jamming with the Transport and then Slicing with the Corvette.

XWingTMG,38dqxp,leewardstyle,2,Wed Jun 3 18:10:18 2015 UTC,"I am still waiting to field my CR90, but I have fielded the GR75 3 times and had fun every time. If you enjoy working with more indirect creative tactics you will like it. It does not add raw power to a squad but rather lets you pull off surprises.   That said, the CR90 comes with many of your fave characters as crew which may appeal more depending on how your campaign is being run."
XWingTMG,38dqxp,2dskillz,1 point,Wed Jun 3 18:20:38 2015 UTC,"I play the corvette in epic battles whenever my friends and I play. I sometimes run the transport. I've found that running the tantive though with a combo of turbolasers/quads for both long and short range capabilties is fun vs imperials, especially since my friend loves to run decimators. The turbolasers tend to tear them up xD And the quads are good once you get close range. Then i run a bunch of smaller fights, a third for defense and the other two thirds for offensive operations.  edit: missed a few words"
XWingTMG,38dqxp,SoraNoChinchira,2,Thu Jun 4 15:32:27 2015 UTC,"I have played the transport campaign twice (once on each side) and thought it was fantastic.  I have heard it's better than the Tantive campaign.  The new x-wing pilots that come with it are very good as well.    For the most part you'll want to have at least 200 points per side to make the transport feel right, unless you're going for something objective based like the campaign."
XWingTMG,38dqxp,scuff,0,Wed Jun 3 18:29:09 2015 UTC,"Do you need another X-Wing? If yes, then buy the GR-75! If not, then buy the CR-90 so you can Fat Han.    However, ultimately, buy both."

XWingTMG,38baic,leewardstyle,2,Wed Jun 3 18:07:28 2015 UTC,Because it makes for interesting game play. Alternative answer: for the same reasons space ships would fly around like jet fighters!
XWingTMG,38baic,Nasserx,1 point,Fri Jun 5 02:18:20 2015 UTC,"I had the ""atmospheric jet fighters"" argument last night. Funny, because once a ship/craft has anti-grav or at least something close to it; it could simply program/script all the properties of lift and drag.  Babylon 5 / BsG hang their hat on ""realism,"" but truth be told, space-combat won't be as clean. Thrusters to [spin a craft] make micro-changes to its trajectory while changing its nose_bearing. A wobble is inevitable, and with full_time stabilization/counter-wobble, we're back to ""simulating drag.""  Not to mention SPACE isn't ""empty."" Far from it.   On_topic, when we play with moving asteroids, we tape string to the undersides of astroids: length shows _speed and direction shows _trajectory. When they move, put a focus_token at the end of their string and then move them atop the focus_token."

XWingTMG,38duy8,shiki88,2,Wed Jun 3 16:19:11 2015 UTC,"My impression is you don't have enough firepower coupling an A-Wing with a support ship, and the Y-Wing is going to be restricted to 1-2 hit a turn if you use Ion."

XWingTMG,38duy8,Burius81,2,Wed Jun 3 19:01:25 2015 UTC,"Insofar as this build has a strategy, it seems like you'd be trying to keep Jake tethered to Jan to try to get him 3 attack dice against a reduced agility.  The problem is there's really nothing other than an ion cannon to keep your opponent from just beating the piss out of Jan. Once Jan's gone, your opponent can kind of ignore Soontir-lite and just pound on the y-wing, knowing Jake isn't likely to do more than 1 damage per turn."
XWingTMG,38duy8,Burius81,2,Wed Jun 3 18:05:56 2015 UTC,"Insofar as this build has a strategy, it seems like you'd be trying to keep Jake tethered to Jan to try to get him 3 attack dice against a reduced agility.   This is the major weakness of your build.  The strength of the A-Wing is the movement dial and trying to keep him close to Jan essentially takes that away.  If you are dead set on running A-Wings I have two lists that I am itching to try out. http://xwing-builder.co.uk/view/260218/hammer-and-anvil My plan here is to have the B-Wings fly relatively close together right at something scary.  Depending on how my opponent sets up the A-Wings might set up together or on opposite ends but the plan is to fly them as flankers and try to touch off those Proton Rockets for a wicked alpha.  Gemmer's ability to add an Evade die at range 1 will get some use here.  When they can't, they turtle up(focus+PTL Evade.)  Turrets are going to be a problem but the hope is that the Proton Rockets can do enough damage/crits to neuter a Deci or YT.  I'm thinking of dropping Gemmer for a Green to get auto thrusters on Jake to help with turrets though I haven't flown this exact list yet so I want to see how Gemmer's ability fairs.  The other list is http://xwing-builder.co.uk/view/262164/birds-and-the-bees Similar idea but trading Proton Rockets and Gemmer for Farlander with PTL (to help proc his ability) and a Green Squadron A-Wing.  This makes the B-Wings the major threat and might pull my opponents attention away from the A-Wings so they can more easily flank.  Turrets are a bigger issue than before here without Proton Rockets to alpha them and no auto thrusters."

Link has been fixed.  100pts Jake (PTL, VI, Proton Rockets) Green Sq. (Proton Rockets, PTL) Blue Sq Blue Sq  I got to looking at the build and decided to drop Gemmer for a Green Sq with PTL.  The idea being that Gemmer's ability is only going to work in range 1 and going from PS 3 to PS 5 isn't worth it to me.  Having PTL means the Greenie can turtle up with Focus+Evade and has a much better chance to live long enough to touch off his Proton Rockets."

XWingTMG,38ctg7,MrSunol,2,Wed Jun 3 11:41:15 2015 UTC,"I find rebel captive is better on something like a Phantom, where people really want to shoot it, but then the Captive gives them a big reason not to.  With health like a firespray has, I dont care if it gets shot. I would rather use Tatician and save the Captive for something else in the list."
XWingTMG,38ctg7,kintexu2,2,Wed Jun 3 11:48:05 2015 UTC,It's also got two arcs for tactician to activate out of!  So I would certainly use tactician for a Firespray.
XWingTMG,38ctg7,goldenemperor,1 point,Wed Jun 3 11:55:03 2015 UTC,"IMO tactician is better because you can use it on Scum Boba, who is much stronger.

XWingTMG,38ctg7,antigrapist,1 point,Wed Jun 3 15:13:52 2015 UTC,"The main problem with tactician on scum boba is that he's only stronger when he's within range one of opponents, while tactician wants you to be at range 2.  Sure, you ould be at range 1 of some and shooting at someone at range two and still get rerolls, but then you're missing out on the extra dice from shooting at range 1 (assuming the range 1 ship or ships are in arc)"

Edit: also, you don't have to do all of the secondaries on one section then the other.

XWingTMG,388537,LazyG,2,Wed Jun 3 09:48:57 2015 UTC,"A note of caution: if you put neodymium magnets under your ships, they will be attracted to the metal supports under most common game store tables. If you use those bases on a table like that, your ships might actually be moved by the magnets.  This might happen even if you use the magnetic mat, depending on how strong its magnetic field is.  TL;DR: be careful with the magnets and experiment with them on your table before you try to play a real game with them, especially at a tournament. I would recommend having a spare set of bases that don't have magnets."

XWingTMG,38br90,Blint181,3,Wed Jun 3 04:50:45 2015 UTC,"VI on Boba is a game changer because it puts Soontir and Whisper moving after Boba. With the auto-blaster this strikes fear into the hearts of these ships and causes RAC+SUPERFEL players to dramatically change their approach or risk Boba jamming an autoblaster down Soontirs throat. Recon is not great with the engine/VI boba since you will likely be boosting most of the time. I have had great results with VI boba with engine, Autoblaster, and tactician. At range 1 and 2 this gives lots of ships problems, so you can interrupt your opponents decision making process even before reaching range 3 because they know Boba can boost to range 2 and stress a PTL ship like corran or soontir. Just be weary that this incarnation of Boba dies really fast so you have to be smart with how and when you send him into the heart of battle.  hope that helped"
XWingTMG,38br90,rebelcaptive,1 point,Wed Jun 3 05:33:53 2015 UTC,"I don't agree with autoblaster on a firespray.  It's a cannon that covers the front arc only, so it seems pretty useless to me.  If I'm at range 1 front arc I'll take the 4 dice."
XWingTMG,38br90,CMDR_Supagoat,1 point,Wed Jun 3 14:17:04 2015 UTC,"I like autoblaster here because, in general, the interceptors still have 3 green dice and likely an evade token at range one. Autoblasters negates all of that."
XWingTMG,38br90,rebelcaptive,1 point,Thu Jun 4 00:05:43 2015 UTC,"I have been using it non stop and i can certify that with boba's VI ps 10 engine and reroll for range it gets results. The key is that it cuts through a turtled soontir or coran or an IG88. You could have a good roll at range 1 with primary weapon and get 4 hits, and on a turtled soontir you might get a damage through, two if your lucky, maybe none. Where as auto canon will do on average two garanteed damage. And theres nothing like one shoting soontir with an auto canon. You just start slow and boost into the kill spot. The fear of the autocanon will totally interrupt how your opponent flies soontir. Give it a try and tell me what you think."

First off, ask anyone on here who's played more than 25 games and they'll tell you Marksmanship is about the crappiest EPT there is, 3 points for something you may not even use?  No thank you.  Change it to Push the Limit, your Green Squads have a lot of green moves on their dial and a lot of actions, PTL is where it's at.  Predator is fine though I would drop it and cram in one more ship for some jousting value.  As for Horton you gotta drop the Advanced Protons, he wants to shoot at range 2-3 to take advantage of his ability, not range 1.  R2F2 is likewise crap and just not worth it on him.  Here's my tweak. http://geordanr.github.io/xwing/?f=Rebel%20Alliance&d=v3!s!31:18,72:7:15:U.-1;31:18,72:7:15:U.-1;8:0,1,116,70,27,24:-1:3:;65:-1:-1:-1:  Putting Horton at 10 is huge, he'll shoot before and move after almost every other ship you face.  Combine with engine and non 360 ships will have a very hard time getting consistent shots on him.  The Proton Torpedoes are great on him cause he can re-roll any blanks when firing it and then change a focus to a crit, the seismic will give you a little insurance against Swarms, which you may struggle against with this list.  It's a little light but the Tala will give you a little more beef and the auto thruster Greens can be quite the nuisance."

Many players run Decimators that get an advantage once they hit no shields and 1 damage - YSanne and... Kenkirk, I believe? - so using Vader to burn through shields to kill Soontir or a Phantom on turn 2 is worth it.  And if they're running something else a little bulkier?  No sweat, Vader only cost 3 points and a single crew slot.  Not a huge investment to give yourself uncancellable, 360 damage options."

XWingTMG,388skc,Holmelunden,3,Tue Jun 2 19:04:31 2015 UTC,"I never noticed how insanely over costed Rhymer is no wonder nobody flies him. There's no way they make a generic PS 2 only 17 points, that'd be 2 points less than a blue squad if you tack on AccC.

XWingTMG,388skc,Winged_Gundark,1 point,Tue Jun 2 17:32:45 2015 UTC,In the current meta where jousters are kind of a fringe list it can be. 9 health is a lot when you're only shooting five or six dice at it and shooting back at things with 1 or 2 agility or none with the decimator.
XWingTMG,388skc,darth_static,2,Tue Jun 2 17:39:08 2015 UTC,"Given how many players believe Rhymer is overcosted (he's 4 points more than Jonus for only 1 more pilot skill and a worse pilot ability), I'd bet that they will NOT follow the same pattern of point values for the Punisher.  Most ships have a 6-8 point difference between the cost of the highest PS pilot and the lowest. If they follow that pattern for the Punisher, the lowest PS pilot will probably be more like 19-21. My bet is that they'll go for 21 on the lowest skill pilot, to guarantee you can only run 4 in a standard list, max. Even 19 or 20 would not be too bad, since it would mean not running any upgrades on a list of 5 Punishers."
XWingTMG,388skc,Azazel_The_Fox,1 point,Tue Jun 2 17:33:37 2015 UTC,I think to avoid the silliness being at at least 18 points would be fine. I do want to see them be more though.   I like this answer the best along with the ones that pointed out Rhymer being overcosted which is something I didn't consider when we initially became concerned.
XWingTMG,388skc,Azazel_The_Fox,1 point,Tue Jun 2 17:44:32 2015 UTC,"Worse pilot ability?  Rhymer's overcosted, I'll grant you that. But he's not supposed to be a squadron leader the way Jonus is.   Once extra munitions rolls around, he'll be a lot more viable (hopefully). APT firing range 2 is pretty significant."
XWingTMG,388skc,DokerinZion,1 point,Wed Jun 3 00:53:06 2015 UTC,"Plus there's the new Advanced Homing Missiles coming out with the Punisher and K-Wing, that are range 2 only, 3 points and 3 dmg. Given that the missile ability would have to be viable enough for other ships to use, giving them to Rhymer may make him worth taking."
XWingTMG,388skc,TheSecretMe,2,Wed Jun 3 03:27:45 2015 UTC,I would almost undoubtedly guess the lowest they'll be is 20.

XWingTMG,387586,exonwarrior,5,Tue Jun 2 10:58:16 2015 UTC,"Coming from Android: Netrunner (/r/Netrunner), I have to say that there are always similar threads there. Is such-and-such ID/card too powerful. The answer is almost inevitably the same as exonwarrior's. More people see what's winning in the meta and they play it. It's also in part due to where a particular meta is at. As metioned further down this thread, turret ships are a good solution to arc dodging, which is still very popular.  I think also that player consistency during a long tournament is a consideration. We're talking about it over on the Netrunner forums a bit now, but basically if you have the choice to run something with 2 ships that's much simpler to manage, compared to a swarm of 6-8 ships, it's much easier to manage burnout when your loadout is easier to fly. Thus, it may also be a popular choice because it's relatively easier to run over a long play time.  Does it mean they're overpowered? Probably not. My advice would be the same in these forums as it is in Netrunner. Run what you love and make it work. In the end, surprising your opponent wins matches."
XWingTMG,387586,X-factor103,2,Tue Jun 2 13:45:41 2015 UTC,"Also, the tournament structure is different between Netrunner and X-Wing. ANR uses SoS, while X-Wing uses MoV. I think you'd see a shift in how ANR is played if it went to an MoV structure, where you counted AP scored/stolen instead of going by prestige points."
XWingTMG,387586,BlueSapphyre,2,Tue Jun 2 13:57:03 2015 UTC,"Apologies for being noob, but what does SoS mean in this context?"
XWingTMG,387586,exonwarrior,3,Tue Jun 2 14:08:59 2015 UTC,Strength of Schedule. The tie breaker in ANR is the sum of your opponents' prestige points. So beating better players (who would have higher PP) increases your SoS.
XWingTMG,387586,BlueSapphyre,2,Tue Jun 2 14:10:29 2015 UTC,"X-wing noob question here, but what is MoV? I understand the concept through context, but am curious about the abbreviation."
XWingTMG,387586,X-factor103,2,Tue Jun 2 14:14:00 2015 UTC,"Margin of victory. If you field two falcons and lose one and the other has 1 hp left while the other guy fields 8 ties and lose 6 of them, the falcon player wins even though the tie player did more damage. The falcon player killed ~72 points of ship while the tie player killed ~50."
XWingTMG,387586,EthicalCrackpot,2,Tue Jun 2 14:20:36 2015 UTC,"Margin of Victory. So if I'm flying a VT-49 Decimator, and you get it down to 1 HP when the game ends, you get no points for that ship, while if you destroyed it, you would get the point value of that ship. Considering how often games go to time, especially in 60 min rounds, it's a huge benefit to fly big ships with a ton of shields/hull because of how MoV is calculated."
XWingTMG,387586,BlueSapphyre,1 point,Tue Jun 2 14:25:39 2015 UTC,"Alright, cheers for that."
XWingTMG,387586,exonwarrior,1 point,Tue Jun 2 14:35:10 2015 UTC,Would a damage dealt system fix this? Calculation based on damage inflicted rather than points killed?
XWingTMG,387586,OSouup,1 point,Tue Jun 2 18:48:36 2015 UTC,"Such a system would heavily favour high agility/turrets, like IG-88."
XWingTMG,387586,BlueSapphyre,1 point,Tue Jun 2 19:26:15 2015 UTC,I bet we can come up with a points killed by damage dealt calculation that will balance big ships out with numbers. Calling /r/theydidthemath.
XWingTMG,387586,OSouup,2,Tue Jun 2 20:09:24 2015 UTC,Even just having 50% of your score be from squad points destroyed and 50% from damage dealt would balance things pretty well.  Example: you're playing against a double Decimator list (does anyone actually do that?) with 50 points on each ship and you destroy one ship completely and take the other down to 2 hull before the game goes to time.   Your points score is 50% because you killed 50/100 points. Your damage score is 93.75% because you dealt 30/32 damage. Your overall score is 71.875% - the average of the two scores.
XWingTMG,387586,i_shit_my_spacepants,3,Tue Jun 2 20:36:08 2015 UTC,"X-wing is much like a biosphere.  Turrets prey on Arc Dodgers, which prey on Jousters, which prey on Turrets.  FFG deemed Turrets had too strong of an advantage against Arc Dodgers, so they released Autothrusters.  However, Arc Dodgers are the natural predator of Jousters.  So FFG has inadvertently created an environment that is very anti-Jouster right now (strong Arc Dodging and still solid Turret ships).  FFG will fix this in time, they always do.  I'd expect to see a new Swarm / Jouster upgrade in an upcoming wave.  TL;DR: Autothrusters made Arc Dodging stronger, which made Jousters weaker, which made Turrets a more consistent fallback to Jousters."
XWingTMG,387586,Enervata,-7,Tue Jun 2 14:10:19 2015 UTC,That argument only holds water if 8/10 of the lists at these tournaments are big ship lists - Which I find highly unlikely. It seems that big ships are just winning disproportionately many tournaments.
XWingTMG,387586,exonwarrior,2,Tue Jun 2 11:05:33 2015 UTC,"Well, where I am in Poland Han + Corran, Brobots, Dash + whatever, Decimators. I don't know the exact proportions, but they are definitely very popular."
XWingTMG,387586,BlueSapphyre,10,Tue Jun 2 12:52:13 2015 UTC,"Because of how MoV is calculated, it's beneficial to run 2 expensive, hard to kill ships, which means including at least 1 big ship. So Deci-Whisper, or Deci-Fel, or BroBots, etc. When flying small swarms, even if you win, you probably lost a good portion of your ships which hurts your MoV."
XWingTMG,387586,branniganbginagain,6,Tue Jun 2 12:37:02 2015 UTC,"this is something you really don't notice until you've really started playing in tournaments regularly.   especially ones with a 60 minutes time period, someone can have a 60+ point fat ship down to 1 -2 hp, and its the same as nothing killed."
XWingTMG,387586,exonwarrior,3,Tue Jun 2 12:54:39 2015 UTC,I'm still not sure whether I like that system or not. Especially with big ships like Han Solo being 8 Hull and 5 Shields - getting them down to 1 HP is equivalent to destroying 4 TIEs.
XWingTMG,387586,exonwarrior,1 point,Tue Jun 2 14:03:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it makes Swarms a huge gamble. Going from the squad ranker linked in OP, Build #4 had 61 points on Han in the YT-1300. That's 5 TIEs worth, and if you don't kill it, only getting it with 1 HP then you've just lost a load of points for nothing."
XWingTMG,387586,BlueSapphyre,3,Tue Jun 2 14:31:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah, MoV has it's issues, but it's like democracy - it's the worse form of government except all the others. Like the issue with SoS is getting paired down, which means getting paired with a someone lower than you and as such winning doesn't improve your SoS much, while losing is a huge blow.   For example, let's assume 6 rounds (2pp for a win, 0pp for a loss) beating someone in the first round, who then losses successive rounds (going 0-6) will net you 0pp for your SoS, while beating someone who later wins a game will net you 2pp for your SoS. And because the first round pairings are totally random, it can affect your tie breaker just on that initial pairing."
XWingTMG,387586,exonwarrior,1 point,Tue Jun 2 14:40:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah, true. I'm just wondering whether you should divide points by hull and shield - 2 hits on an Academy TIE (12pts IIRC) would give you 8 points. More if upgraded."
XWingTMG,387586,gammon9,1 point,Tue Jun 2 14:57:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think on the competitive level one of the biggest changes that's happened over the last couple waves is how much tournament lists have become tailored to the tournament rules.  The number one list on OP's link is BBBBZ, which most players will tell you significantly outperforms in tournaments because of how long it takes to chew through that many B Wings. That's also one of the reasons the YYYY lists do so well, since they present a huge number of hit points that have to be dealt with.  The MoV system really seems to favour low-value, high-health ships or a few high-value targets, without much room for cheaper ships that can go down in a two shots."
XWingTMG,387586,BlueSapphyre,2,Tue Jun 2 16:05:51 2015 UTC,"Very good point on the Bs. That's 8 ""hits"" for 22 points. While 2 Academy Pilots are combined 6 ""hits"" for 24 points. And downing a 12 point 3 ""hit"" ship can be a huge tempo swing in-game, in addition to it's affect on the MoV afterwards."
XWingTMG,387586,Nomnomnicon,4,Tue Jun 2 15:23:47 2015 UTC,"Big ships are good because they are, simply, bigger. On a more technical front this means they're tougher - more hull/shields. They nearly always have 3 attack dice as well. So, a two or three ship build with a big ship (or two) in has the advantage of attrition over two or three ship builds without big ships. Coupled with the use of turrets on a few of them (Deca, YT's) it means that TIE Interceptors and Phantoms have an up hill struggle to take them down without being killed first in the firefight.   Swarms deal well with big ships, especially in two ship builds where the big ships have limited attack dice. However most swarms have a poxy 2 attack dice per ship, so suffer against things with agility 3 - specialist fighters like interceptors - or more mobile craft that can dodge their arcs. They also have a lower pilot skill, meaning they can lose a few ships before they get to fire.   Unless your list is looking to deal with big ships (high firepower, lots of autothrusters, some serious Ion or control) then you'll struggle. I currently run a Shuttle, Phantom and an Interceptor and haven't lost a game (of the paltry 6 it's played, I'll admit) and I can see why the shuttle isn't used often. I do get 11 shots a turn out of it though (HLC on shuttle) which helps rip into big ships and the two specialist fighters are good for dogfighting. As yet I'm still working out if I've been lucky or good though."
XWingTMG,387586,ChaoticBlessings,8,Tue Jun 2 15:29:12 2015 UTC,"I think it's less about the ""big ship"" and more about the 360° Turret Primary which comes with both decimator and the falcon. Big ships work well because they can negate any kind of advantage small, maneuverable ships have with arcdodging. They can stall enemy tactics for long enough to get a good advantage.  It's less about ""they are too good"" as more about ""they negate advantages of other things"". Even with Autothrusters, which is specifically designed against this, most arcdodging is still much of a bet against the dice.  On the other hand, seeing especially Autothrusters, FFG seems to be aware of the issue and at least tries to actively work against it, so that's something."
XWingTMG,387586,Glucose98,1 point,Tue Jun 2 11:59:57 2015 UTC,I would argue Engine Upgrade is what makes big ships so viable.  They're way too fast.
XWingTMG,387586,rd95,2,Tue Jun 2 11:15:38 2015 UTC,Coupled with the fact that their extra length is like a +1 straight built into every movement.
XWingTMG,387586,rd95,2,Tue Jun 2 13:03:30 2015 UTC,"Big ships have a lot of things going for them which adds to their appeal. For me, their biggest draw is that they're damage sponges with room for tons of upgrades. Part of the issue you're seeing though with tournaments is what I feel is a bit of a positive feedback loop. People see big ship squads do well, more people field them, the more big ship squads that are fielded, the more win. So on and so forth.  If you played the weekend games at my game shop and didn't pay attention to leaderboards, you wouldn't even worry about how much big ships are fielded. Out of the dozen or so people that play, only about a third of them play with big ships with any consistent frequency. One of the best players there (which sadly isn't me), almost never fields big ships at all."
XWingTMG,387586,Tyler8245,2,Tue Jun 2 13:06:53 2015 UTC,Would you mind listing what said player runs most frequently?
XWingTMG,387586,rd95,2,Tue Jun 2 10:23:30 2015 UTC,"I myself am trying to narrow down a Scum YZ Combination list, so I've been flying variations of that for the past month. Last week there was a Rebel BBYY, a Scum YYYY, an Imperial Decimator/Interceptor combo, a Rebel YT1300/2400 Duo, and lastly some guy that ran an Imperial Phantom and two Interceptor combos.  It made for an interesting day."
XWingTMG,387586,TheSecretMe,2,Tue Jun 2 10:47:39 2015 UTC,"But the thing is, these are the lists that are winning tournaments - There are lots of lists at these tournaments which aren't big ship lists. They're just not winning. Also, people who win tournaments presumably are pretty skilled, so they don't just field big ships because that's what everyone does.   This would honestly be pretty easy to fix - Just add some anti-bigship meta items. Some kind of ordnance which works better against ships with high hull values, for instance."
XWingTMG,387586,antigrapist,2,Tue Jun 2 11:09:33 2015 UTC,"Big ship lists are more consistent. Lots of hull, shields, upgrades + a turret. They handle bad luck and misplays in a more forgiving manner than synergy lists.   That's exactly what you want in a tournament ship. Big ships aren't broken or overpowered, they're just the most consistent solution for tournament play."
XWingTMG,387586,Dakkon_B,2,Tue Jun 2 10:58:16 2015 UTC,"There is a vassal tournament hosted here that is almost finished which only has two big ships in the top eight: one dash and one RAC. Of course, all the tournament games are played to completion.  The other problem is you're going off a list that inherently gives more viability too large ship lists because they're all necessarily the same while small ship lists have more flexibility in bringing different pilots and upgrades."
XWingTMG,387586,bl1y,2,Tue Jun 2 11:50:11 2015 UTC,"This has been discussed before in a tread I started not to long ago link.   The gist of it seems to be people figure in a tournament of 4-9 rounds (each round being 60-90 mins) you just get mentally tired and large ships are extremely forgiving to a mistake here or there. While say Triple Interceptor lists which mind you can win just fine, when you make a mistake it can cost you a whole ship. Which can leave you frustrated leading you to make another mistake (either in the same game or in the next round cause your still salty).  Usually the more forgiving a list the better it does on average which translates to consistent results.  I do think Large ships are slightly to good atm. I would like ordinance to be a ""silver bullet"" that could include large ships. (specifically torpedoes)"
XWingTMG,387586,Angerman5000,3,Tue Jun 2 13:00:35 2015 UTC,"8 out of 10 feature at least 1 small ship! There were 16 small ships compared to the 10 big ships, small ships must be OP!"
XWingTMG,387586,remmick,2,Tue Jun 2 18:50:58 2015 UTC,"So despite there being only 6 different large ships to choose from, they account for roughly 40% of all ships in top lists.  I think that points to them being disproportionately represented myself.  Are they broken, too good, etc is up for debate, but let's not try and pretend that this isn't an issue worth talking about, or that the OP's question is somehow stupid."
XWingTMG,387586,Danzer0,1 point,Tue Jun 2 11:51:36 2015 UTC,But aren't big ships easier to hit? And isn't it harder for them to avoid asteroids and such?
XWingTMG,387586,quarrel,2,Tue Jun 2 15:04:56 2015 UTC,"Big ships with high pilot skill and the ability to reposition- boost & or barrel roll- can be hard to hit. While large bases can be harder to avoid obstacles, the winning lists- really the winning pilots- have worked these lists so much that they can easily avoid firing arcs and obstacles."
XWingTMG,387586,Beau_Geste,1 point,Tue Jun 2 15:54:32 2015 UTC,"One big ship has a harder time avoiding asteroids than one small ship has, but an easier time than an equal-value miniswarm does."

Sure, there are ways to get around them but big ships give their user a lot of margin for error unlike a set of smaller ships.   Probably the biggest advantage of most big ships is the 360 arc. I would like to see Turret weapons have max range of 2 to reduce the value of Turrets."
XWingTMG,3897h8,apache_alfredo,3,Tue Jun 2 18:46:21 2015 UTC,My go-to mat is a $7 yard of blue felt from a local fabric store.
XWingTMG,3897h8,EdgeOfDreams,1 point,Tue Jun 2 19:12:12 2015 UTC,I did exactly the same thing. 1 yard of felt fabric cut in half gives two 3x3 ft sections and cost me ~$6.00.  I gave the other one (half) to my buddy.  Works like a charm. I couldn't find it in me to drop 40 bucks on one.
XWingTMG,3897h8,LiquidLogic,2,Tue Jun 2 20:45:47 2015 UTC,The yoga mats are fantastic.  I ordered one and it's what I use for casual play.  Gets you 2 3x3 play mats from one yoga mat for almost half the price of an FFG mat.  And definitely grippy.

XWingTMG,3897h8,djinfish,1 point,Wed Jun 3 04:21:03 2015 UTC,"I really really Do not understand anyone's gripe about these neoprene mats being slippery.   They're far less slippery than a tabletop. They're far less slippery than vinyl. They're far less slippery than carboard. They're far less slippery than wood. They're the exact same compared to felt. It doesn't scratch like vinyl. It doesn't bunch up like felt. It doesn't ever get creases like vinyl. They look cool as fuck. They're much more compact than a yoga mat. They roll and unroll better than a yoga mat.   Compare it to literally any non rubber surface you've played on and it's less slippery than that. Then add in the fact it's a rubber bottom so it won't slide around, unlike any other non rubber material you've used to play on."
XWingTMG,3897h8,sacimino40,2,Tue Jun 2 19:48:51 2015 UTC,it is definitely not the same compared to felt. I would say they are no more slippery than any of those surfaces. But less? No way. They look great yes. I have the death star one but i put furniture bumpers on the bottom of all my bases. This is what causes them not to move. I agree with the rolling part. But yoga mats are much stickier surfaces. I have played on wood vinyl and yoga mat as well as the FFG mat. The yoga mat is by far and away the stickiest surface if you have nothing on the  bottom of the bases.
XWingTMG,3897h8,djinfish,2,Tue Jun 2 20:20:01 2015 UTC,"Basically with the slippery aspect people argue, you will get the exact same result using anything other than a yoga mat.  As well, the slip will only happen if you're prone to bumping pieces with your hands. Though if you're bumping pieces a lot, a yoga mat won't help.  If you're trying to slide ships up that their maneuver would bump, you can't with a yoga mat. In my experience, I've had to keep picking up the pieces and putting them down millimeter at a time till the ships were touching.   Picking your ships up and having the base stick to the mat is aggravating enough when the ships come off enough on its own anyway.  For portability purposes, a felt can be folded up really small. But one snag on the edge by another player will ruin the current game.  I'll try and break down each surface. (assuming opinion in some aspects)  CARDBOARD/WOOD: pros cheapest solution. *cons * Slick. * damages easily. * not as portable.    FELT: pros * cheap. * most portable. cons * gets dirty easy. * fits loosely on most tables. * can snag ships with loose fibers.    NEOPRENE(mousepad material): pros * durable. * portable. * grips table. cons * expensive.    VINYL: pros * Infinite artwork. * light. * portable. cons * damages easily. * expensive. * rolled edges/doesn't sit flat.    YOGAMAT(neoprene): pros * GRIP! * durable. cons * thick/big. * curled edges over a short time."

Felt not glued down to something I think would be just as good as a tablecloth...not good.   I think the review I saw mentioned they were a bit slick (not 'very')...but he had nothing in his bases. I have the washers which not only add weight, but surface area...which is probably just, if not more important.   Look -we're pretty casual, so the occasional bumping is ok with me. I just didn't know a mat double the price was worth it, just because it was painted, sanctioned and a bit lighter or thinner."

I used 3M spray adhesive I had on hand to attach the felt (glue or any other adhesive would work fine), and there is some of the black board at either end that can be used for player setup.  To be honest, if you've put silicon in the bases along with the washers (so that the bottom is filled solid), you don't need the felt. The grip of the silicon on the board is enough, and the black looks great. You can decorate it with stars by flicking a little watered down white paint from a paintbrush.   Cheap and easy, and my ships never move unless I want them to.  Now if only my templates were a little grippier..."
XWingTMG,3897h8,polyology,0,Tue Jun 2 20:17:14 2015 UTC,"Didn't put silicon, just the washers, so they don't auto grip. Anything with a stiff board isn't going to have the portability I need....which I was hoping to get with rolling something up."

If you're aiming to stick with Rebels, RA/Falcon/E-Wing are great options with very clutch upgrades... of course I would suggest also getting the YT-2400 to round out your Rebel collection and get some great cards there too."

XWingTMG,3886au,JediMikeO,2,Tue Jun 2 15:20:16 2015 UTC,"It's a fun list.  Prox mines require an action, and unfortunately Emon can't take Push the Limit.  You could use experimental interface on him, which would let him throw a bomb and take another action, or switch to seismic charges.  I don't think navigator is all that great- at pilot skill 5 you're still not able to adjust your move after seeing a lot of other moves, and it only adjusts the speed, not direction.  I'm running a similar list here:  http://xwing-builder.co.uk/view/261410/bomb-loadout  You could drop the bombs on the Y-wings and add Engine Upgrade to the Firespray.  I like the experimental interface as it lets him drop a prox mine and take an action.  Sadly, Emon can't take Push the Limit."
XWingTMG,3886au,vlaka_patata,1 point,Tue Jun 2 15:44:22 2015 UTC,I can't see your list since that site is blocked at my work. Would something like this work better?

XWingTMG,3886au,mangostrike,2,Wed Jun 3 05:22:58 2015 UTC,"It's a lot of fun.  Just remember that you can only drop one bomb per turn, so The Mad Bomber needs to live for at least 3 rounds of combat to be effective.  Recon Specialist would provide some added protection, but you won't be able to use the Proximity mines. Also, if you get bumped you're really out of luck on both counts.  Look into seismic charges or proton bomb instead. It's guaranteed damage instead of unmodified dice rolls."
XWingTMG,3886au,KTreu42,2,Tue Jun 2 18:53:56 2015 UTC,"If you're going for the heck of using bombs, you're right to take Emon, but definitely take some standard bombs.  Proton bombs ain't cheap, but automatic critical damage that hits through shields is really great if you can catch a couple enemies with it.  I took one of each bomb when I ran him. Gives you options and you aren't burning actions every round on proxy mines."
XWingTMG,3886au,-SeizureSalad-,2,Tue Jun 2 18:59:39 2015 UTC,If it were me I'd drop two sets of prox mines and give both y's and emon a seismic charge a peice
XWingTMG,3886au,Nomnomnicon,2,Wed Jun 3 20:06:39 2015 UTC,"As vlaka_patata put it, Navigator isn't so useful on a midling pilot skill. I would recommend experimental interface instead, or shifting the proxy mines to other ships so you can lay them all down in one turn. This would give you great board control, and potentially split up formations.  I'm not sure how I feel about the BTL upgrade for Y-Wings. The unhinged astromech makes it better but without an engine upgrade I still find them too easily dodged."

As some one who flies almost exclusively E-Wings, if you are going with a 2 ship list you want Corran for the damage. You many not be able to deck them both out but you won't regret Corran over Etahn.  EDIT: This is the standard Super Dash you will see at tournaments. This is 100 pts, I tend to leave off VI for the initiative.  Dash: HLC, Outrider, EU, PTL, Kyle.  Corran: R2-D2, FCS, VI."

XWingTMG,387dlg,ernesto__-,2,Tue Jun 2 11:24:37 2015 UTC,I think it depends on the rest of your list. Do you need someone that can survive a Fat Han/Deci's barrage? Go with Authothursters. Do you think that the enemy will rarely shoot at him (you have much better targets in your list)? Go with EI probably.
XWingTMG,387dlg,KasztanekChaosu,1 point,Tue Jun 2 11:50:30 2015 UTC,"I've used this Tycho Build with success:  Tycho, Push the Limit, Lone Wolf, A-wing Test Pilot, Proton Rockets, Autothrusters.  I usually keep my A-wings to the perimeter, so Tycho would be a good distance away from the rest of the squadron for Lone Wolf.  But given the choice between Autothrusters and Experimental Interface, I'd take the Autothrusters, or even an Stealth Device.  Just because you can pile a ton of stress tokens on Tycho doesn't mean you should.  I still think the best part of Tycho is that he can K-turn and still take 2 actions with PTL (If he starts the round without a stress token)  You could still take the Experimental Interface for that turn you want to K-turn, Focus, Boost, and Target Lock, and you can waste that TIE fighter tailing you."

I have flown Tycho with PTL and DD and he is slippery as hell.  I'd probably take auto thrusters since getting out of arcs isn't an issue with this combo so turrets are going to be more painful.  I plan to try Tycho with PTL, Expert Handling, Autothrusters, Chaardan to see what happens.  He can boost and barrel roll but also break target locks for free which might help even more vs turreted ships."

I know that it's not weak but two well flown Interceptors with autothrusters can bring it down fairly easily, or three A-Wings with autos. I find that if you take out the escorting ship (Fel, Echo, etc) it's just a case of making sure you're at range three and/or have something between you. No one else runs Vader in my play group, just me, although not on this build, so it's just dice damage.  Edit: Thanks for the response though!

If you take a Deci fully loaded(most likely RAC) with Soontir Fel/Vader(when the Raider comes out) fully loaded you have one hell of a list. PS10 Chiraneau can dodge more arc than you would think with an EU. This is my list:  RAC: VI+Ysanne+Rebel Captive+Gunner+EU   Soontir Fel: PTL+Stealth Device+Autothrusters+Royal Guard  If you fly RAC basically in a circle around the board adjusting when needed, he is truly are hard ship to keep in arc, especially at PS10. Soontir Fel is near impossible to hit when turtled up. And remember, with Fel, no shot for you and your opponent is better than shots for both of you. Also, with Palpatine (again once the Raider comes out), Kenkirk turns into a beast (I think he is better than Fat Han if you put the right upgrades on him)."
XWingTMG,3887wo,sacimino40,1 point,Wed Jun 3 15:01:25 2015 UTC,"Interesting. I like RAC because his ability almost precludes the need for focus, but his higher points cost made him a little pricey for this list since I'm using the Firespray. I could make cuts for it though."

It might be nice to see the mods actively posting or commenting here a little more often, so we at least have reassurance that you exist. At least some of what mods do, such as deleting content that breaks the rules, is semi-invisible, so it can be hard for the rest of us to know if you're actually paying attention to the sub or not.  It might also be nice to occasionally have mod posts that check in with users about meta-level stuff for the sub, whether it's user ideas for improvement or just generally gathering feedback and discussion about what kinds of content people like to see here.

XWingTMG,385wyq,MrSunol,1 point,Tue Jun 2 02:05:07 2015 UTC,"I like the first list, really because Phat Dash is pretty fun to fly, plus he poses a large competitive threat. But whoever you're facing isn't going to see this list and go ""Hey, imma get dat A-wing and leave dash alone for awhile"". Thats what you want, but that wont happen. So I would maybe pick another support ship with a little more firepower and drop the Z-95? Not Corran, jeez I dont like corran, but something. Maybe Ten, I do like Ten."
XWingTMG,385wyq,ernesto__-,1 point,Tue Jun 2 02:29:12 2015 UTC,"That's not actually the plan. The plan is to cluster debri clouds close together, and keep dash circling / on them to make it hard for ships to get r1. People ALWAYS underestimate tycho. He has a PTL with a better dial than soontir, better PS and better defense (with 2 shields).  When it comes to late game, after dash is dead and so is roughly half their fleet, Tycho can clean up interceptors, decimators, B-wings, tie swarms with ease. (He has trouble with Double IG lists thought), and Tycho is just as hard to kill as soontir.  Also, my favorite part, is tycho completely negates their rebel captive (which really screws up PTL dash).  The only regret I have is that tycho cant run proton torps. It just leaves no room for that spare 7 points for the squad, and I'm not running a 93 point list. so out go the torps and in comes the z-95."
XWingTMG,385wyq,ernesto__-,1 point,Tue Jun 2 02:47:44 2015 UTC,"sounds good, I know full well how hard it is to hit tycho with PTL with autothrusters. The only thing though, as defensive as tycho is, does he really hit hard enough to take out an interceptor, which nowadays almost always have autos?"
XWingTMG,385wyq,starslinger72,1 point,Tue Jun 2 02:52:04 2015 UTC,"After half a game of taking TL + Focus HLC shots from dash, It would be very unlucky if soontir was still full health.  But you are right, tycho doesnt hit hard enough to punch through stealth device soontir at the bets of times.  EDIT: I would most likely be taking the HLC shots on the decimator, and trying to strip it bare ASAP, but i only really need that one time where soontir bumps and is without modifiers to make a dent."
XWingTMG,385wyq,starslinger72,1 point,Tue Jun 2 03:12:37 2015 UTC,"I just dont see that list standing up to a well flown Fel + RAC.  Fel will eat dash by himself.  Tycho also doesn't pose much of a threat to Fel in the same way as VI Corran can, and even that isnt much."
XWingTMG,385wyq,VanderLegion,1 point,Tue Jun 2 02:55:58 2015 UTC,"""well flown"" is the key.  I can fly this list pretty well myself, and I have had a lot of experience flying soontir + RAC.  The only time I nearly lost (I still won in the end) was when tycho got an unlucky 4-blank evade roll early on, which left the outrider to take on Soontir + half health RAC with a rebel cap.  We should have a match Starslinger...... see hwo is right ;)"

You could go with a slightly cheaper Dash and try and fit prockets on Tycho and still keep the bandit.  Not sure what exactly to swap, but that gives Tycho serious punch to pop Soontir, Corran, big ships, etc."
XWingTMG,3863z4,Kelaos,4,Tue Jun 2 02:59:27 2015 UTC,"Really depends on what you want out of a board game.  If you are looking for a competive game between two people or wanting to fly cool battles from the movies.  Either way adding the Falcon and Slave 1 are great starts, then getting both the rebel aces and imperial aces gives you a good number of different ships to start out with.  Getting the tie advanced at some point to also have vader on the field flying against luke is something you will want!"
XWingTMG,3863z4,starslinger72,2,Tue Jun 2 03:06:08 2015 UTC,"This is good advice, I second it.   The important thing is get ships that you think are cool. You are likely to have the most fun flying those. The game is really well balanced, and pretty much any ship can work in casual play. Even the tournament scene can have a lot of diverse lists.  My advice is buy whatever ships you think are the most exciting one by one until you are broke :) ha"

XWingTMG,3863z4,EdgeOfDreams,2,Wed Jun 3 16:45:57 2015 UTC,"I am pretty much where you are right now.  I chose to add a Tie Fighter, X-wing, and Tie Interceptor and left out the second core set for now.  That gave me the same number of ships as two cores, but it added a lot of new pilots to work with.  It's a bit more money and it does lack the templates and dice of two core, but it feels like more variety.  I am not sure how fast I will build up my collection, but my current expansion plans (likely home play only):   imperial aces second core set falcon"
XWingTMG,3863z4,EdgeOfDreams,1 point,Tue Jun 2 13:41:39 2015 UTC,"For casual play, especially if you are providing the minis and tools for all players, I highly recommend:   A second core set (gets you 3 more ships, duplicates of important stuff like templates and asteroids in case you lose them, and enough dice that you don't have trouble rolling the occasional 4+ attack/defense die rolls) Millennium Falcon and Slave 1 (Great, easy-to-fly big ships for each side, can be loaded up with upgrades so they fill up most of the points for a squad) A-Wing, B-Wing, and Rebel Aces for the Rebel side (good ships and lots of useful upgrade cards) TIE Interceptor and Imperial Aces for the Imperial side (yes, it's 3 of the same ship, but you get a ton of cool pilots for them and again, useful upgrade cards)   After that, it's pretty much up to you to expand however you want, so long as you buy options for both sides. The Most Wanted pack so you can play the new Scum and Villainy faction is also an option, but I'd hold off on that until you've got at least a Slave 1 and a Y-Wing already, so you can use the Most Wanted pilot cards to convert them and get maximum value out of the pack.  For tournament play, there's a ton of different ships that are all fun and competitive to play with, although certain combinations tend to be more popular and win more tournaments than others. Your best bet is to start by finding a game store with a group that meets regularly and start playing casually with them. For actual tournament play, you are required to have a real copy of every card you want to use, which can be a pain if you want, say, three ships equipped with Autothrusters but only have purchased one StarViper expansion. For casual play, though, people will often let you borrow ships and use proxy cards if necessary. By playing casually with a group that has more ships than you, it'll give you a chance to better figure out which kinds of builds you like and which ones are competitive. Then, you can try to either buy exactly what you need or convince one of your new-found friends to loan you what you need to play in the tournament."
XWingTMG,3863z4,shark2000br,1 point,Tue Jun 2 04:23:07 2015 UTC,"I think I would look at providing all the minis since expensive games are hard to get people into.  I think the second core set I'll hold off on to see how it works with the single set for now.  Good to know those are good ships (they're also two of my favourites)  Thanks for the tip on the Scum and Villainy, they looked cool but didn't know you could use a Slave 1 and Y-Wing with them.  That makes a lot of sense, I was going to ask around my local game shops to find out if there's a group.  Thanks for the long/detailed post!"
XWingTMG,3840te,PCGamerPirate,6,Mon Jun 1 18:19:45 2015 UTC,"I'm really impressed that a wild card made the top 8, even if he beat my pick for coolest build.  Here's are some thoughts on the top 8 matches, with my estimate of how good the predicted winner's chances are. The estimates reflect just how much of the game comes down to piloting skill, squad practice and the luck of the dice.    Soaring_bear v jointjoint  Dash has his work cut out for him to get through Fel and Whisper. The Z95s are really pretty useless against both Fel and Whisper, so Dash is going to need to connect with his proton rocket.   Prediction: Soaring Bear takes this about 65% of the time.    nh_zero v blairbunke  Another Fel/Whisper list goes up against an obsidian swarm. Blair has beaten a Jake/Corren/Luke list. I suspect the game will come down to how much value Blair can get out of his doomshuttle, but it's going to be an uphill battle for the ties.  Prediction: nh_zero with a 60% chance     chilligan v rebelcaptive  While Rebel Captive is almost certainly sad that his favorite upgrade isn't in faction, he did bring the right squad for battling all the PS9 aces in the top 8. Whisper certainly has the firepower to cut through Boba and his sidekick but I'm not sure she's going to live long enough to make more than a couple dents in their hull.  Prediction: RebelCaptive with a 70% chance    antigrapist v vanderlegion  I may be a little biased here, but I think rebel control has the edge over 3 small ship lists. Torkal is going to have a hard time providing any value with just an ion cannon but both of Vander's aces have predator, which is an extremely strong actionless card that gives PS2 control headaches.   Prediction: Antigrapist 65%"

It gives him a range 1-3 turret so his positioning is very flexible, and he ignores obstacles during movement. If you accidentally land him on an asteroid, just boost or barrel roll off of it so you still get a shot in the combat phase. High pilot skill means he'll be moving after most other ships, so you can boost or barrel roll out of enemy firing arcs a lot of the time too."
XWingTMG,3848cz,EdgeOfDreams,2,Mon Jun 1 19:33:40 2015 UTC,"Also remember you can choose not to use his ability, so you can make sure you don't end up barrel rolling onto an asteroid."

XWingTMG,3848cz,exonwarrior,3,Wed Jun 3 14:56:34 2015 UTC,"I just restarted X-Wing again after a long hiatus, and I don't have ship recommendations for you, but I've been thinking of some good mnemonics for movement in general.   A 1-movement is the same length as a (regular) ship base. You can extrapolate the other straight forward movements from there. A hard turn will result in your ship pointing 90 degrees from its previous orientation. If you memorize what a hard turn of a certain magnitude does, you can extrapolate what a bank of the same magnitude would do.  And this is a stretch, but to help with memorizing what turns do, you could take pictures of a ship before/after certain movements with an asteroid reference point and develop a set of digital flash cards."

XWingTMG,3848cz,rsixidor,3,Mon Jun 1 23:52:24 2015 UTC,"Not a very experienced pilot, so can't really recommend ships to you.  However, I can suggest what I used to get better with avoiding stuff, I read it on this subreddit I believe.  Basically, take two ship bases and all your movement... things. Place the first base down on the mat, pick a maneuver and place the second one where you think it will end up. Then take the appropriate maneuver... thing and move the first base. See how well they match up.  Just do that. A LOT. I spent quite a few hours playing with my A-wings, B-wings and X-wings flying among the asteroids and whatnot. Really helps visualize your movement better."
XWingTMG,3848cz,DangerFord,2,Mon Jun 1 21:46:40 2015 UTC,"My best recommendation is going to be 4 b's with advanced sensors. B's have a better dial, than Y's,  can barrel roll, and also do that before they move, which really frees you up from making bad dial decisions"

XWingTMG,3848cz,CDC_Brad,1 point,Mon Jun 1 21:35:26 2015 UTC,"There are debates to be had about what ships are easier to fly than others.  B-wings with advanced sensors are fairly forgiving as it allows to take an action before moving so if you bump or feel like you can't avoid a rock without barrel rolling first.  I think I might recommend Oicunn, though as he's fairly idiot proof.  I'd put predator and Dauntless on him, Dauntless is a great card for him because if you do a green move before activating it you actually don't take the stress.  Then you could load him up with Ysanne, Rebel Captive and a seismic charge to help deal with swarms.  For filler I'd just run Dark Curse, Backstabber and an Academy.  You won't really have to fly these guys in formation, try flank with Backstabber if you can but just be fairly cautious with him and try to hang him back at the start if you feel they may come at him hard.  Dark Curse and the academy, on the other hand, you can be real aggressive with, fly them near Oicunn so he doesn't get whittled down quick and you can even try to use the academy for some blocking action to help Oicunn get his ram off."

So if you can close and stay out of his primary arc on the decimator when you move into attack range, he won't be able to stress you with that.  Mara Jade and the Shuttle tactician can both stress you of course, though the shuttle is another one that you can get past and probably keep out of arc after a first pass.  Also, I can't tell from the way you wrote it whether he's ramming you twice EVERY turn or just whenever he can.  If he does the Dauntless/Daredevil combo he CAN'T be doing it every turn, since if you do a green maneuver, you'll end it with stress.  The next turn you can ram again, but you'll be stressed still from the last turn so you can't trigger dauntless.  If you did a green maneuver, you'll clear the remaining stress and be able to double ram again the next turn.  If they DIDN'T do a green maneuver when they rammed you the first time, they end up with 2 stress and need a couple turns to clear it.  Lower PS ships would let you move first so he has to guess which way you'll go in order to ram you (and you CAN choose to keep the stress and do a white maneuver for a better chance of getting out of the way of ramming and possibly out of range 1 for mara).  Higher PS ships will give him the chance to ram before your move, but if you have boosts or barrel rolls you can use them to get out of range 1 if possible and/or move to where he can't ram you the NEXT turn."
XWingTMG,3868cz,VanderLegion,3,Tue Jun 2 04:54:54 2015 UTC,"Direct counters (not guaranteed to perform well, just options to consider):   Tycho Celchu is an A-Wing pilot who doesn't care about taking stress. Wingman is an upgrade card that can help you remove stress. Arvel Crynyd is an A-Wing pilot who can shoot targets he's touching. Autothrusters are great against turrets.   Other thoughts:   If he's using Dauntless and Daredevil in the same turn, he's probably ending every turn with a stress token or two, because they each give stress. Give him even more stress with a Rebel Captive, Tactician, or R3-A2 of your own, thus preventing him from clearing it all and taking actions. Ion him so he can't clear stress because he's doing a white 1-forward. Lieutenant Blount is a Z-95 who can take Ion Missiles and guarantee two ion tokens even if he misses. Don't fly directly toward him at the start of the battle. Try to keep your distance to prevent Tactician from getting you. Then, attempt to circle around behind him and follow behind, blasting his butt. That will minimize his chances to run into you. You need to focus fire on one of the two big ships to take one down early. It's hard to say which one that should be, though. Fly near asteroids so that if he bumps into you, he's more likely to land on an asteroid as well, thereby taking damage and losing his shot and/or action for the turn."
XWingTMG,3868cz,EdgeOfDreams,1 point,Tue Jun 2 04:38:31 2015 UTC,"My first thought as well: Fly a fancy A-Wing squad, maybe Gemmer + Jake + Tycho and give them all autothrusters. If you don't have 3 A's, take an E-Wing.  Anything maneuverable to stay out of Deci's main arc, and to easily outmaneuver the Shuttle.  Just run with defensive upgrades/evade tokens, those large ships can easily be picked apart even with 2-attack A-Wings due to lack of agility.  That's just my initial thought, it leaves little room for mistakes in maneuvering since A's are so squishy."

XWingTMG,3864hn,Vepper,3,Tue Jun 2 03:03:26 2015 UTC,"1) Something to note, you can trigger EI from free actions.  So you could do your focus or TL in the perform action step, then when you trigger Isard at the start of combat for the free evade action you can then trigger EI to use Expose.  Personally I like predator on Chirpy.  Expose sounds nice, but the fact that you don't get to focus/TL (or have to use your modification for EI and then use that to get the second action and constantlys tress yourself) make it less than stellar.  I'd probably do predator/engine upgrade, add isard, and probably drop dauntless.  If you use dauntless to get double actions with your EI you now have 2 stress (unless you did a green maneuver, in which case you have 1 still).  And EI makes you really vulnerable to anyone else that can deal stress, whether from tactician, mara jade, rebel captive, etc.  Dauntless is really made for Oicunn since he WANTS to be ramming people."

XWingTMG,381z0i,JackRostron,3,Mon Jun 1 11:31:06 2015 UTC,"Apple are very strict when it comes to trademarks and copyrighted property.

XWingTMG,381z0i,JackRostron,1 point,Mon Jun 1 13:34:36 2015 UTC,"This was the response I received when I contacted them about the dials when I first started putting it together:   I have recently started playing Star Wars: X-Wing and think it is an excellent game. I work as an iOS developer and enjoy programming in my spare time. One of my recent side projects is recreating the manoeuvre dials for each of the ships which can be used on an iOS device. Is it possible for me to distribute this to others using the App Store and if so what would I be bound by and what restrictions, if any, would apply? I am happy to send a demo video over of what I have developed so far.      Dear Jack,  We’re glad that you are enjoying X-Wing! We do not allow our game materials in any apps at this time. Additionally, all Star Wars materials are owned by Lucasfilm, Ltd./Disney, and we cannot grant any permission on their behalf. You may not be aware of this, but we already have a tool available for X-Wing called X-Wing Mission Control, which can be found here: https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/more/tools/  Thanks and happy gaming,  Jacinda Lohman    Apple's stance on copyrighted material is outlined in the App Store Review Guidelines and goes into specifics here. Basically without FFG's permission I wouldn't be able to distribute through the App Store.  I don't have any more videos but have been working on a full companion app for my X-Wing circle to use - the dial app works great when we are substituting ships. The plan is to have an app which has all players squads, can list who moves/attacks in which order and any upgrades on the ships for quick reference. Obviously not tournament friendly but great to pass round and to help bring new players on board."
XWingTMG,381z0i,G8kpr,2,Mon Jun 1 15:30:01 2015 UTC,"that really sucks when big corps stifle innovation because of copyright issues. I understand their stance, and if I had a company, probably would be a similar idea.  In the late 80s, there was a programmer that made a shareware program for the Amiga called ""MechForce"", it was basically a recreation of the BattleTech table top game for the Amiga, the graphics were poor but the game play was really fun. I remember it being immensely popular on the bulliten boards back then.  Then FASA got wind of it, and sent him a cease and desist. I believe they actually bought the game from him, (or so the rumour goes) with the idea that they would develop it, and instead they just buried it."

Substituting the dial images is really easy, but they clearly have only one purpose and although without assets break copyright it would be infringing on their property with the functionality.  Oh and in terms of the firing arc I have no idea, I agree that lines shouldn't be a problem but that was beyond the scope of what I had planned"

One point is the HLC only cancels the initial dice roll, so any modifiers you use or rerolls stand as they roll.  For this reason Kath likes to Target lock as much as possible when using an HLC."
XWingTMG,3842uc,howieloader,2,Mon Jun 1 19:50:27 2015 UTC,"Kath w/Mangler Cannon + Calculation + Recon Specialist is a pretty good chance at 2 crits per attack, and if the defender wants to cancel them, they get 2 stress...  It's also important to note that HLC only turns hits to crits on the initial roll... Any dice rerolls or abilities such as Mercenary Copilot stay crits..."
XWingTMG,383xna,Petunia2t,1 point,Mon Jun 1 18:00:00 2015 UTC,"So this is my list for an upcoming tournament, I have no idea what kind of lists I will be facing, so this is designed to be as ""survivable"" as possible, with stealth devices, and heavy use of evade tokens.  I only have 1 PTL card before anyone makes the obvious suggestion! And I thought the barrel roll on the firespray would come in handy for getting that range 1 bonus etc.  It's also worth mentioning that I am terrible at remembering perks and talents, for example I always forget my predator re-rolls, and to steal focus or evades with Palob, so I try to keep my list simple.  Both ships can shoot again if they miss, so I'm hoping to stay alive and just keep landing steady hits for a statistical victory.  What does everyone think?  Thanks :)"
XWingTMG,383xna,Kryptoduck,1 point,Mon Jun 1 18:04:04 2015 UTC,"Stealth device not worth it, much better engine upgrade on firespray, and  droo the torps an put another heavy laser cannon"
XWingTMG,383xna,Kryptoduck,1 point,Mon Jun 1 18:19:29 2015 UTC,"I really struggle to make the engine upgrade worth the points, if stealth device negates just one point of damage then its done the same job as hull or shield upgrade, but it might negate many points of damage through a match before it gives up. I've had stealth device last an entire match on the worlds luckiest Z-95 before, which I admit is unlikely to happen again!  And the torpedoes are a 2 point, 3 dice attack that will stress, boba hits for 3 dice normally anyway so its more about denying manouverability or actions to a key enemy at a pivotal moment of the battle. All for 2 points."
XWingTMG,383xna,VanderLegion,1 point,Mon Jun 1 18:31:24 2015 UTC,"Your list, your call but engine upgrade on big ships is a great thing anyone would tell you that, on the other hand stealth device is usaly not worth the points, green dice are allways tricky"

So far it seems to work pretty well."
XWingTMG,383qgn,CMDR_Supagoat,1 point,Mon Jun 1 17:23:18 2015 UTC,I'd try and find a couple of points for inertial dampers if possible. Otherwise looks like a solid list.

Could get rid of the seismic charge and give dampeners to both of them...  It has come in handy, though.  I sent my list in already but I bet I could change it if I get the update in by Wednesday.  I'll see if I can get some vassal games in with ID instead of the bomb and see how it goes."

I'm curious how you will do and what challenges you will have with the upcoming regionals (mine isn't for another couple of weeks, but I'm trying to nail down what I'm going with so I can practice)."
XWingTMG,383qgn,starslinger72,1 point,Mon Jun 1 18:25:42 2015 UTC,"Recon spec on Boba for sure.  Really going to miss Engine upgrade on both of them as well.  Personally I think K4, PTL, and Engine is the best combo for Kath right now, and leaves open the cannon and illicit slot as needed."

FCB is my home shop, so it was pretty awesome seeing such a great turnout for the event and it felt like everything ran pretty smooth considering the magnitude. I actually played against that focus list round 2, Definitely had cool synergy.  I ran Deci/Fel, started strong 4-0 and then lost myself 2 games to other locals basically due to exhaustion (missing Ysanne and Rebel Captive triggers mostly).  Ended up 13th and got my shield tokens, but was denied the dice.  Oh well, I had a good time and was pleased with how my list performed despite having not practiced nearly as much as I should have. I traded for a couple extra Boba cards, shoot me a PM if you're interested in trading for one"
XWingTMG,380svw,A6AvantRay,1 point,Mon Jun 1 02:31:30 2015 UTC,"At least you had fun, that's the important part :)  What do you think the weak link in the list is? Maybe the protos?   If you were to run this sort of low PS rebel list in the future, would you want to go with more ships (like 3x3z or 4BZ) or move towards a more controlling panic attack type list?"
XWingTMG,380svw,antigrapist,1 point,Mon Jun 1 02:41:54 2015 UTC,"I think the Protos are probably the weak point, no one ever shoots at them because they aren't much of an offensive threat, but if you downgrade them to Z's and try to upgrade the rest of your squad, you don't have the A's to block anymore. Z's are horrible blockers."
XWingTMG,380svw,Abre_Los_Ojos,1 point,Mon Jun 1 03:09:41 2015 UTC,"Downgrading at least one of the prototypes gets enough for FCS on both B's, an upgrade that would have been extremely useful. It also lets me keep an initiative bid (getting first asteroid placement is pretty important, getting blocking initiative is really important)  Looking to the far future, Twin Laser Turret on a stress hog might be a good buy."

XWingTMG,382lcx,SkizzM,1 point,Mon Jun 1 12:08:05 2015 UTC,"Just to clarify, can Soontir take a focus, PtL receiving a stress token, and still get a free focus? Also, can Soontir take an action (not focus), PtL and get a stress/free focus, then choose focus as the PtL'd action?"
XWingTMG,382lcx,BrandCAG,5,Mon Jun 1 16:25:55 2015 UTC,"As Soontir Fel's special ability is worded so that when he receives stress, he receives a focus token, that is different than taking a focus action. So, you'll often see Fel take a focus action, use push the limit to evade, then receive an additional focus token from his ability.  Therefore, yes, he can certainly end up with two focus doing things that way."

XWingTMG,382lcx,bulletbarrage,2,Mon Jun 1 21:07:29 2015 UTC,"Getting stress assigns Fel a focus token, but doesn't cost a focus action. So, yeah, Fel can still take the focus action to get another focus after using PTL if you didn't already do it."
XWingTMG,382lcx,Thopterthallid,2,Mon Jun 1 18:49:52 2015 UTC,"You can't take two of the same action. You CAN take a focus/evade action if you were granted a FREE TOKEN. Like, if another ship passed you a focus token, you can still take a focus action."

So this is no deeply optimized advice, but maybe it helps some.  BBXX can't go too wrong for a starting rebel, I've experienced. The ships are tough, and there's no gimmick that has to be maxed out in order for the squad to make sense. When learning to fly, too many flashing lights are no help whatsoever!   One option could be something like: - B-blue w/ FCS (24) - B-blue w/ FCS (24) - X-rookie (21) - X with your favorite pilot/toys (31)  Last week I played a variant of this where the loaded X was Wedge with R2D2 and other upgrades while the rookie was replaced by a cheap A-wing. I just wanted to fly Wedge at least once :). I got lucky during the actual match, but I'd fly this again soon.  (although my opponent reads this reddit, so let me state here for the record that I will never never never fly this again. maybe. never. or maybe I'll use the red A instead of the blue A.)   p.s. I suspect that more learned listers will suggest a loaded Falcon. They're probably right. I'm just reporting on my experience with my small flotilla, which is small-ship only. But I like flying lots of cheap ships, so there you go."
XWingTMG,381l1h,oceanborn2,2,Mon Jun 1 10:06:54 2015 UTC,"You could put together a super Corran. He is fantastic.   Corran with Push the Limit, FCS, and R2-D2. You can add engine upgrade if you want. You can also switch PTL for Veteran Instincts if you need the higher pilot skill. Corran is great. With PTL focus evade he is tough to hit. And when he does take damage, he can just regen shields with R2-D2. If he survives until the end game, he is almost impossible to take down.  You can pair him up with a Falcon, or an assortment of other low PS rebels. Either should work for you."
XWingTMG,381l1h,Frando3,1 point,Mon Jun 1 13:10:04 2015 UTC,"I see you are wanting to beat interceptors and phantoms. In that case, you will probably want VI on Corran to get PS 10. You can also put engine upgrade on him for even more positioning possibilities."

My thought was having N'Dru able to boost would be more useful than storing excess focus, which I wasn't sure I'd have much of anyway between using the blaster and using it on evades. Do you think it would be better the other way around?"
XWingTMG,381a9l,EdgeOfDreams,2,Mon Jun 1 03:13:09 2015 UTC,"It might be. N'Dru is going to need Focus or Target Lock to make the most out of his attack rolls, so he won't want to boost all the time. Also, Moldy Crow lets you set up a bank of 2, 4, or even more Focus tokens at the start of the game, which means you've got something to fall back on if you get focus-fired or bumped or stressed."
XWingTMG,381a9l,VanderLegion,2,Mon Jun 1 03:17:32 2015 UTC,"I might be tempted to just drop N'Dru and take 2 naked Binayre Pirates instead.  With 4 ships on the board it's a lot harder to keep out of range 2 of your allies to trigger her ability.  2 pirates gives you an extra 4 health, more attack dice (or same as if ndru is away from allies and firing from out of arc to get outmaneuver.  Split into 2 attacks with the pirates, but you always get it if you have shots, unlike trying to get N'Dru set up), and you can use them as blockers."

XWingTMG,380ffm,Nrucker5,2,Sun May 31 22:50:25 2015 UTC,"So the next question is, ""is it worth taking experimental interface so you can Expose AND Focus/TL?""  But I just can't justify EI over Engine because the loss of mobility is so dramatic: not being able to boost AND being stressed from using EI. Choosing Engine means you're commonly using your action to boost, so you'll want to choose an EPT that can modify dice. So the choices are, what, PtL, Predator, Opportunist, Outmaneuver ...  any others? You could probably make a case for VI. PtL and Opportunist cause stress, which, again, limits mobility; I just can't figure out a better option than Predator.   Anybody else reach a different conclusion?"
XWingTMG,380ffm,Thisisthesea,1 point,Mon Jun 1 00:04:07 2015 UTC,"Predator is absolutely the best overall EPT for RAC but cases can be made for VI and determination.  If you want to stress a Decimator, I suggest using Oicunn because he punishes blocking.  Oicunn+Vader+Gunner+Rebel Captive is designed to take out an ace as quickly as possible. Expose+EI makes him a monster."
XWingTMG,37zhmp,traverse_timeNspace,2,Sun May 31 18:43:46 2015 UTC,"I am currious what the Imp List flew against, because competitively I could see it struggle.  Boba Fett has a lot of points invested in it that kind of conflict, i.e. Expose/Stealth Device. 7 points to bump up your Attack by 1... you could very well spend it on a Heavy Laser Cannon, Also , Expose and proxy mines both require an action which means you can't use them the same round, which again will limit how effective expose can be. Also, with no other way to get actions expose is empirically worse than a focus action. So there's that as well.  Carnor is so so, the Squints shine with PTL, but I'm interested how SoT would work so I can't say much there."
XWingTMG,37zhmp,ithaka21,1 point,Sun May 31 21:59:06 2015 UTC,"I was playing against a Rebel list,  Wild Space Fringer,  Biggs, and Cracken. So definitely helped stay close to the Fringer,  he had the title and cannon, so blind spot at range one.  Expose wasn't as useful as I imagined it would be,  I might have to play around with other options.  I had tried expose and the stealth device because I had just gotten the Firespray and wanted to try out it's shiny toys."
XWingTMG,37zhmp,MrSunol,1 point,Mon Jun 1 13:18:18 2015 UTC,"When it comes down to the pilots, scum firespray are better than imperial firespray. Not to mention the illicit slot too.  However when it comes down to escorts (The ships that make up the rest of your build), the imperials have a lot more to offer, so it sort of evens out. (The most notable being the interceptor, but you can also run mini swarm, doom shuttle (with points for 1 more ship), tie advanced after their new release.... e.c.t.).  Scum don't have so much variety yet, and IMO they aren't as good when it comes to ships costing at around the 30 point mark. You can still make a competitive list (Like the one you have posted), but i probably would have gone with kath or bobby in my firespray since their abilities are really good.  You can try and utilize this information and be as points efficient as possible, skip the middle man and just run TWO scum firespray :) http://xwing-builder.co.uk/view/257662/double-scum-firespry-bobby-kath After all, the imperials have been running lists comprised completely of interceptors for ages."
XWingTMG,380sz5,captinmoses,7,Mon Jun 1 00:39:57 2015 UTC,"Once per opportunity. So you can use determination each time you are dealt a pilot crit, but the card text on push the limit restricts you to using it once per round.  A better example is Luke's pilot ability, which says "" When defending, you may change 1 of your (eye) results to a (evade) result.""  If you roll 2x focus, you can only use his ability to turn one of them into an evade because you can only use cards and abilities once per opportunity, but this also means that you can use Luke's ability every time he defends."

XWingTMG,380dxa,NoChurch,3,Sun May 31 22:38:15 2015 UTC,Definitely PtL. Having Expert Handling or Daredevil on there won't help a bunch if every turn you're taking a Focus or Evade instead. The second action is what lets Tycho really shine.
XWingTMG,380dxa,bl1y,2,Sun May 31 22:44:27 2015 UTC,"Give him experimental interface. (with daredevil and expert) 3 stress per turn to t do 2 moves and a barrel roll = winning.  (Yes I do know that running autothrusters on him is much better, but this is WAAAY more fun.)"
XWingTMG,380dxa,MrSunol,3,Mon Jun 1 02:56:04 2015 UTC,"Hard 1, Daredevil, Barrel roll, very nearly a 0 k turn."
XWingTMG,380dxa,bl1y,1 point,Mon Jun 1 03:03:03 2015 UTC,"So I ended up flying Tycho with PTL, Daredevil, refit and Autothrusters; a prototype also with refit and autothrusters and two Blues with FCS coming in at 97 points. I only got one game, but won by one point. It was crazy close, it would have been a bit less close if I'd remembered to use the autothrusters.   I flew against Wedge with Swarm Tactics, Biggs, Tarn and a Rookie.   Flying Tycho around was way too much fun!"
XWingTMG,380dxa,tyrannustyrannus,0,Mon Jun 1 11:43:15 2015 UTC,"Tycho can K-turn and still take an action, I'm not sure daredevil is your best choice.    Edit: I should clarify...if he's not stressed he can k-turn.   The dial on an A-wing has a lot of green, you should still be clearing stress sometimes"
XWingTMG,380dxa,NeRG,2,Mon Jun 1 01:08:47 2015 UTC,"I thought Tycho still can't perform red maneuvers. His card says he can take actions even while stressed, so He doesn't need to worry about clearing his stress like the others, but he still can't take a red maneuver, or use something that can't be used while stressed, like Opportunist."
XWingTMG,380dxa,DangerFord,2,Mon Jun 1 01:41:36 2015 UTC,"That's not correct. If Tycho is stressed, and he will be, then performing a red maneuver would be illegal and your opponent would be able to choose your maneuver instead.  I would use PTL and Daredevil along with Experimental Interface. Now you're running around with 3 actions every turn."
XWingTMG,380dxa,VanderLegion,2,Mon Jun 1 02:14:22 2015 UTC,I had an opponent at a tournament today forget he had Tycho stressed and try to K-turn.  I got to land him on an asteroid directly in front of my Decimator and well within range 1.
XWingTMG,380dxa,tothbebe,1 point,Mon Jun 1 04:39:42 2015 UTC,"Well its technically correct, Tycho can k-turn and take actions, if he starts the round not stressed, though that doesnt really happen that often :)"
XWingTMG,37zahc,Kozemp,3,Sun May 31 17:50:11 2015 UTC,"You should read Sable Gryphon's tournament report where he won a regional with Boba and an Aggressor.   First off, you need to run Autothrusters on your IG. It'll save you a minimum of 1 hp per game, and frequently more. Heavy Laser Cannon is generally better than mangler if you can afford it. PtL is an upgrade that looks good on an aggressor at first, but in practice you need to turn and k too frequently to get a lot of value out of it, plus stress is already really strong against aggressors. I'd suggest running predator, lone wolf or VI.   Your boba shouldn't be running deadman's switch, it just does too little and the game will be too far gone when boba dies to really get any value. You might as well just run a seismic charge and get that damage in before he dies.   K4 doesn't really synergize with boba's ability, so you'd be better off with a different crew, and autoblaster is a terrible upgrade, even on a PS 10 ship.   I'd really suggest looking at what sable gryphon ran and then tweaking it to your liking. You can easily drop the proton bomb to upgrade B's EPT or pick up a second cannon, or just fill the illicit slots."

Vader had quite the day, crushing Corran Horn, Wedge, a RG Interceptor, and another Fel."
XWingTMG,37zk6b,X-factor103,1 point,Sun May 31 19:55:29 2015 UTC,"curious, as a newbie, because of some recent regionals vids I've seen. When running a small ship alongside Deci, is Fel still so good? I've been seeing a lot of Whisper and it seems to me he's just as evasive, hits harder, and is in turn harder to hit (most people seem to run Whisper with Adv Cloak + FCS + VI + Gunner)"
XWingTMG,37zk6b,1_73,1 point,Mon Jun 1 13:05:11 2015 UTC,"Whisper has a big disadvantage over Soontir: when decloaking he does this at the start of the activation phase, at PS0, so to speak. So whisper decloaks, and then all the other ships get to move first. This means that Soontir knows which direction Whisper is decloaking and can choose his barrel roll+boost action depending on that. If the direction of Whisper is as expected, he can do his move to get a good shot on Whisper. If Whisper ends up the other direction he can move in such a way to avoid fire. It's not fool-proof of course, but Soontir does have that edge on Whisper."

XWingTMG,37yunv,goedd,2,Sun May 31 15:47:50 2015 UTC,"I would use Feedback Array rather than Deadman's Switch on the Z-95s. Deadman's is fun, but it's uncontrollable. You might get value out of it, or you might get nothing, or you might kill your own ships. Feedback Array gives you a guaranteed closer if you can get within range 1 of a ship with only 1-2 HP left, which is especially powerful against high agility enemies like Interceptors and Phantoms.  Drop the Deadman's Switch on Torkhil Mux and give him a Recon Specialist instead. That will maximize the value you get out of Moldy Crow and keep him alive much longer to keep shooting, since you'll have spare Focus tokens to use on defense as well as offense. With Recon + Moldy Crow, you may want to move your whole squad slowly and keep your distance for the first turn or two of combat so Mux can get a bank of Focus on him, then move in and start blasting."
XWingTMG,37yunv,EdgeOfDreams,2,Sun May 31 16:22:01 2015 UTC,I've definitely thought the best use for Torkhil would be with a rag tag mini swarm backing him.

Here is a build close to what you are looking for that has done well in tournaments:  http://xwing.macker.co/squad.php?s=778&d=90&f=0"
XWingTMG,37wrgb,Rydiak,2,Sun May 31 01:52:26 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I only have one predator card, but I think I can swap the bombs for seismic and fit the Autothrusters in and still have the attack power I'm after :)"
XWingTMG,37ud0w,Cap10R,17,Sat May 30 13:48:23 2015 UTC,"To figure out how to kill Fat Han, first you need to look closely at what exactly makes Fat Han so strong.  By using C3PO, Falcon Title, and R2D2, Fat Han can negate 3 damage each round. The Evade token eats one, C3PO eats the second, then you lose a shield, and R2 recovers it if you're at 0 shields. If Han has Push the Limit and does Focus+Evade, he has a 25% chance of negating 4 damage each turn.  So, to defeat Fat Han it's simple, you need to deal more than 3 damage per turn. Plenty of lists can do this. BBBBZ, TIE Swarm, 2 interceptors and a doom shuttle, anything with gunner. The lists that do worst are the ones with two ships. Once one of those ships goes down, it can become mathematically impossible to punch through Han's defenses (especially if Han has Engine Upgrade to avoid range 1 shots).  I know the escorts are a tempting target, but you need to focus on Han and bring him down while you still have the firepower. If you lose a third of your list while taking out the escorts, Han could quickly get out of reach. But, if you lose two thirds of your list taking out Han, the remaining ship could actually defeat the escorts.  Also, there's Wedge."

XWingTMG,37ud0w,bl1y,0,Sat May 30 23:17:55 2015 UTC,"Up to 3, C3P0 isn't a guaranteed evade"
XWingTMG,37ud0w,Abre_Los_Ojos,7,Sat May 30 17:33:28 2015 UTC,You guess 0.
XWingTMG,37ud0w,bl1y,1 point,Sat May 30 17:41:57 2015 UTC,"Right. Just to elaborate for his sake, 1 evade roll well either be an evade or not. If you guess 0 you're guaranteed one evade."
XWingTMG,37ud0w,OSouup,1 point,Sat May 30 18:46:17 2015 UTC,"How can C3P0 be fixed to be a little less great for its cost?  Is the solution to make it cost more, change the wording or perhaps change the effect?  It seems pretty much agreed upon that it is to good for its 3 pts cost, so hopefully FFG will do something with it."
XWingTMG,37ud0w,Holmelunden,2,Sat May 30 19:53:08 2015 UTC,The great balancing act of the C3P0 is that it can only be used once per turn.
XWingTMG,37ud0w,Bricked637,2,Sat May 30 20:01:58 2015 UTC,"The problem, imo, is that it is not balancing it."
XWingTMG,37ud0w,Holmelunden,1 point,Sat May 30 20:27:45 2015 UTC,"Ya see, I don't see it that way though."
XWingTMG,37ud0w,Bricked637,3,Sun May 31 03:35:14 2015 UTC,"Autothrusters really help against turrets. Other than that, I echo the other posts. You must land more than 3 damage each turn! There are a lot of ways to do that, but the easiest way is to get multiple shots. Block Han to take away his evade token, then light into him with your other ships.   Outmaneuver is ok, but if you are taking another shot at Han, he can just use c3po on the later shot instead of the first one."
XWingTMG,37ud0w,Frando3,2,Sat May 30 18:32:32 2015 UTC,"I used a phantom with this before, but really any ship could do it. Put out maneuver on them. Most of the time when firing at a turret ship it isn't head on, and with the falcons natural agility being 1, they come down to zero which also negates c3p0 from doing anything... Mini swarms have also been my go-to for turrets, like 4 ties or 4 z's, messing up the big ships flight path and throwing all that dice makes quite an impact"
XWingTMG,37ud0w,codyryan17,0,Sat May 30 14:12:00 2015 UTC,"Like it, maybe phantoms with auto thrusters, out manuver, and a mini swarm for blocking?    What do you all think about stressing them out with tactician or rebel captive?"
XWingTMG,37ud0w,Frando3,2,Sat May 30 18:16:37 2015 UTC,Phantoms cannot take autothrusters.
XWingTMG,37ud0w,Frando3,1 point,Sat May 30 18:27:33 2015 UTC,"My mistake, interceptors!"
XWingTMG,37ud0w,Murdersaurus13,1 point,Sat May 30 20:00:57 2015 UTC,"A single stress doesn't really bother fat Han. As long as he can do a green maneuver the following turn without getting blocked. He is a turret, he doesn't care what direction he is pointing."
XWingTMG,37ud0w,howieloader,1 point,Sat May 30 19:25:57 2015 UTC,"If I were to make a team of Han killers, it'd be something like this...  Jake Farrell: PTL, Refit, Autothrusters, Test pilot, & Outmaneuver  Prototype Pilot: Refit & Autothrusters  Horton Slam: Ion Turret & BTL-R4  Gold Squad Pilot: Ion Turret & BTL-R4  The A-wings are pests. Really hard to hit, however given Jake Farrel's ability to double boost/boost & barrel roll each turn and outmaneuver He's gonna be a big target, especially because Han may feel the need to negate one of the ion tokens with C3P0 from slam. Slam packs a big punch right out the gate at PS8. He gets to attack twice/turn and reroll any missed dice. Boom and boom. Add in the ion turrets from both Y's and Han may make an early exit from the board if he tries to knock out the A-wings. That's a possible total of 10 damage if you can get your ships in the right position (Outside Han's arc, at range 2/3). He will negate at least 2 damage/turn, but the Ionization will assist in forcing Han to stay right where you want him and refrain from taking actions. so subtract one auto dodge if he's ionized and he's only auto stopping 1 hit/turn. Sweet! 9 possible damage. If you're really lucky you can sweep Han's shields and lay into half his health. The main tactic for flying this formation is chaos. No formations. Make Han pick a target then regret it by focusing your remaining guns on him. That's just my take on defeating Han. Certainly won't be easy, and it never really is, but If you fly it right you've got a real good fight on your hands. Ion tokens really are the bread and butter of finishing Han because It stops the evade token & stops R2-D2. Again, not easy, but if you pull it off Han is a sitting duck."
XWingTMG,37ud0w,Murdersaurus13,1 point,Sun May 31 02:34:35 2015 UTC,You can not double boost because you can not perform any action twice in one turn...
XWingTMG,37ud0w,howieloader,1 point,Sun May 31 11:26:07 2015 UTC,"Right sorry, forgot free actions still count as actions. Still got that boost+focus & barrel roll though. And if he's outside Han's arc, he has to get at least 1 dodge if all his dice come up blank and any focus and evade rolls count toward that as well. Jake is tough to pin down. And with all the ship's pilot skills below Han's you can feel a bit safer using that focus for your attack roll if he didn't do so well on his attack."
XWingTMG,37ud0w,Murdersaurus13,1 point,Sun May 31 13:00:08 2015 UTC,Jake is fun to fly for sure...
