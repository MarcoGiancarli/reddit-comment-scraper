customhearthstone,3dqtsl,VreesKees,6,Sat Jul 18 15:52:05 2015 UTC,Nice concept. I like more control oriented cards for Hunter. Well balanced in my opinion and has some neat snowballing potential.
customhearthstone,3dqtsl,BonomDenej,5,Sat Jul 18 16:39:18 2015 UTC,"This card can be really good, or really bad. By turn 5 your opponent should have some form of removal be it a spell or a creature on the board. If for whatever reason they can't get rid of Have'ashi Swarmer they've kinda lost the game, I think the snowball is that strong. I agree with /u/Jaws_Elevator that spawning a clone without the copying effect would be a good change to make it more balanced.  Other than all that, I really like the concept. You've done a great job with this card!    EDIT: Grammar"
customhearthstone,3dqtsl,AquaticRuins,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:49:49 2015 UTC,"Interesting idea, but if it lives one turn, it can get out of hand. In three turns, you would have a full board that could only be removed through full AOE.   My problem with it is that one turns to two, then two turns to four, and four to eight. I would like it more if it was just one per turn."
customhearthstone,3dqtsl,Nooteboom,4,Sat Jul 18 22:30:11 2015 UTC,"I think having it spawn a clone, but without the copying effect would be more balanced. Plus the low health is a pretty big risk anyway. At 3 health it could get killed by a lot of stuff."

customhearthstone,3dqhb2,Mrmac23,11,Sat Jul 18 13:40:07 2015 UTC,I think Twisting Nether would be fine at 8 mana if it silenced. It would be a buffed Lightbomb tacked onto a silence.
customhearthstone,3dqhb2,ZGiSH,8,Sat Jul 18 15:22:37 2015 UTC,"I like all of them besides Magma Rager, which seems weird because it is a horrible card. But the buff you made for it makes it a better version of scarlet crusader."
customhearthstone,3dqhb2,RushSt182,6,Sat Jul 18 19:19:08 2015 UTC,Wouldn't it be better to just make the Magma Rager a 5/2? It would fix the issue while still being strictly worse than the Druid of the Flame.
customhearthstone,3dqhb2,VreesKees,4,Sat Jul 18 15:38:55 2015 UTC,"It's not strictly worse, because druid of the flame is a 2/2 if pulled out of the deck. :P"
customhearthstone,3dqhb2,PM_ME_YOUR_HONKEROOS,4,Sat Jul 18 16:38:02 2015 UTC,"That's not how 'strictly worse' works. Just like a minion can't be ""better against Mind Control"" because it's weaker than another card."

customhearthstone,3dqhb2,kaszu26,3,Sat Jul 18 23:31:33 2015 UTC,I think dr boom is fine if bgh isn't getting nerfed. It's a turn 7 threat. No other 7+ drop is actually powerful enough to be a straight threat. They usually need some kind of battlecry or taunt.
customhearthstone,3dqhb2,shiftup72,2,Sat Jul 18 18:17:51 2015 UTC,"Sometimes I think if they kept Dr. Boom the way it is and just made it cost one more mana it would be a great fix. It would still be an awesome card at 8 mana and used in a lot of decks, but it might just pave the way for other 7 drops like Sneed's and Troggzor to see some use in competitive play."
customhearthstone,3dqhb2,RushSt182,3,Sat Jul 18 19:21:07 2015 UTC,Sneed's is actually 8 mana. Troggzor does see some play for decks that don't have any bgh targets.

customhearthstone,3dqhb2,RushSt182,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:40:35 2015 UTC,"But Dr. boom isn't really a broken card, it's a very strong card that's very much needed to combat midrange decks, but it's not broken.  The real broken cards in the game that people forget about because they aren't usually the cards that finish games (but are cards that decide them pretty early on) are cards like Mad Scientist and Knife Juggler, those two, with scientist being the more much disgusting example, are the most broken cards in the game.  And Trogg and Sneed's don't say competitve play for a very big reason, it's not that they're overshadowed by boom, it's that they're too slow, in a very slow meta-game, I assure you boom would see very little play (compared to now, ofc, he'll still be played a lot) and minions like Sneed's will see a lot of play.  I just think that it's fine to have 7+ mana minions decide games, but I believe the 2-mana/1-mana minions have absolutely no right to do so."
customhearthstone,3dqhb2,xGrimReaperzZ,1 point,Sun Jul 19 12:43:23 2015 UTC,"Ya I never said it was broken but it is quite powerful the way it is. Maybe it's right the way it is but when a card is used in 95% of non-aggressive decks, maybe it's time to say it's a little too powerful. I saw a thread which suggested boom to switched to a 7/5 and the boom bots do 1-3 damage instead which was kind of interesting.  I do agree on the mad scientist. Knife juggler is also very good but less disagreeable. Mad scientist, esp in hunter is just disgusting."
customhearthstone,3dqhb2,RushSt182,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:38:02 2015 UTC,"TBH, I think the best fix for Dr. Boom would be to sliiightly nerf his boom bots. Maybe, ""Deal 1-3 damage to a random enemy"" or something? Could even counter the nerf by making it ""Deal 2-3 damage to a random enemy"", so rolling low won't suck as hard.   Maybe having 2-3 as the RNG range would make them boring though.."

I guess it really depends on the kind of totem you use it on. So let's look at each of them:  Searing - Pointless...  Stoneclaw - Hey! It's that pre-alpha priest spell! I think it even costs the same. (Someone's going to have to check that for me...)  Wrath of Air - Yeah... This one can be absurd... Potentially 14 damage Crackles incoming...  Flametounge - This is essentially a permanent double Savage Roar, except to the minions on the end, which is 4 mana and easier to pull off, so I think this one is fair-ish...  Healing - Depending on how much health your minions have, this could either be SUPER ANNOYING, or entirely pointless.  Mana Tide - This one is definitely strong... But also potentially very dangerous,""Yes, excuse me while I mill myself to death...""  Vitality - Very good against aggro decks I'm sure, not quite as good against some control decks, and probably worthless against combo decks... This is another one that could get ridiculous though, I admit."
customhearthstone,3dp87l,Icicle_Tricycle,4,Sat Jul 18 03:27:49 2015 UTC,"Also, with the way this is worded, if you added a buff onto these totems with another card, you could share that buff too"
customhearthstone,3dp87l,Equ1n0x99,5,Sat Jul 18 04:22:16 2015 UTC,"That is true. You could end up giving Totemic Might to all minions! ... Or being more practical, you could do a 6 mana combo with something like Ancestral Spirit or Windfury to give it to all of your minions... Which could make things even more situationally ridiculous... This is why I have no idea how to properly balance a card like this, because under most situations, it's only okay, but under certain, not super uncommon ones, it can be game winning..."
customhearthstone,3dp87l,Icicle_Tricycle,3,Sat Jul 18 05:24:28 2015 UTC,"In all honesty, don't worry too much about balancing this card is absolutely fine, even with the comboes with ancestral spirit and all, it is incredibly hard to pull it off let alone of a large board, the best(by this I mean  most consistent) combo would be buffing up one totem heavily and then you use this with let's say 3 other minions, the total mana cost, and turns you have to commit to this easily offsets the fact that this card could(emphasis on could) be op. The only change I would ever make to this is adding an overload of 1."
customhearthstone,3dp87l,Icicle_Tricycle,2,Sat Jul 18 08:59:11 2015 UTC,"I feel that the easiest way is never to let the supertotem get attacked. In a deck that's mostly efficient minions, play a zoo style game, with a totem summon earlier, then play this turn 6 with ancestral spirit to solidify the board. Or, wait until the late game like patron decks do. That makes this sorta like soul of the forest but with likely better minions to be summoned from the deathrattle"

customhearthstone,3dp87l,KenniHS,4,Sat Jul 18 13:42:54 2015 UTC,"This is a very cool idea, but you need a bunch of things. 1- Minions already on board. 2- A totem. 3- 4 mana. Now in my opinion this can be either really good, or totally useless. As you mentioned in your comment searing, stoneclaw and healing can be very pointless while wrath of air and flametongue basically give you one turn kills. This kind of one-turn kill gameplay isn't really healthy. Although it needs you to set up a few totems as well as have this card in hand, it's still prohibiting any kind of counterplay from your opponent. Now yes, grim patron and frothing berserkers aren't really that much different, but there's still something you can do against them. As for this, it can be way out of control. In mana tide's case, also bad for you. So what I suggest is changing it to something like 3 mana so that it can be used with other cards and have it only affect two random minions or something like that. But props to you for having an original idea. There aren't too many of those around here. (Looks at Death Knight class concepts and Yogg Saron)"
customhearthstone,3dp87l,augustofretes,2,Sat Jul 18 04:05:52 2015 UTC,I'm not sure how this is any different than playing the same number of minions and using bloodlust. That would probably be better in most cases for killing your opponent quickly.
customhearthstone,3dp87l,RolloRocco,2,Sat Jul 18 16:41:29 2015 UTC,"It should cost less. I think. At 4 mana, you really need to have amazing board control to make use of it. But then again, if you have amazing board control, is it really worth playing it?  It seems a bit like a win more card. I can imagine it being used as a sort of better bloodlust mixed with Flametongue totem as a finisher, which is kinda cool at 6 mana. but you need board control (unlike druid's combo).  I don't think it's op."

customhearthstone,3dnyu8,Arpet,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:05:40 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the idea, however I would not want to mill myself. I had an idea that instead of destroying all friendly Totems you destroy just 1 instead.  The card would become 1 or 2 mana and would have the text ""Destroy a friendly Totem. Draw 2 cards.""  This card would be more comparable to Mage's Arcane Intellect, which is kind of boring... and you could always just drop a totem and instantly sacrifice it, again boring. All in all, the card would be a lot safer to play as you would not need board control to get the most out of the card. If you have a totem on the board from a previous turn you do get to draw 2 cards for 1 mana being payed this turn (2 mana was payed for the totem before). This allows you to play the cards you draw on the same turn you draw them."
customhearthstone,3dnyu8,SkitsofRandom,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:21:45 2015 UTC,They all cost 0 mana I'm pretty sure so that would make the hand return redundant.
customhearthstone,3dnyu8,gigyas6,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:24:20 2015 UTC,"Not to mention, that wouldn't do much apart from healing all the totems, which at that point the card might as well read as ""heal all Friendly Totems"". It's not like totems have battlecries."
customhearthstone,3dnyu8,Arpet,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:48:47 2015 UTC,"Not true. Totems from hero power cost one mana to play if returned to hand; flametongue, mana tide and vitality totem cost two, three and two mana respectively."
customhearthstone,3dnyu8,gigyas6,1 point,Sat Jul 18 07:51:28 2015 UTC,"Okay, so then the card becomes worse - what would that accomplish at that point? If you mean to say that you still draw cards for those totems, even just 2 totems on the board can quickly flood your hand. The point seems to be destroy lots of totems to get lots of cards - and if you have a lot of totems that you're returning to your hand, you're then filling your hand and possibly even milling yourself."
customhearthstone,3dnyu8,Arpet,1 point,Sat Jul 18 08:25:57 2015 UTC,"I don't know if it's as bad as you're making it out to be. Putting it back into your hand seems to be better than just destroying totems outright. Totems have at least some sort of value, enough at least to not justify their destruction for card draw. I just don't like the idea of losing totems for cards. It doesn't seem to be very valuable or feasible for you to have either built up totems over multiple turns or played multiple totems in one turn, then to have them destroyed for card draw.  Destroying your own board for card draw doesn't seem satisfying or rewarding, or intuitive."
customhearthstone,3dnyu8,gigyas6,1 point,Sat Jul 18 08:38:25 2015 UTC,"I think maybe you missed the part where the card costs 0 mana.  Shaman is all about the mid-game (which is also why you don't see it so much right now), so having this card slides right in perfect. A lot of the time you're already going to have a couple totems on the board, if nothing else from your hero power, and being able to trade them for bigger, more game-shaping cards towards the mid to end-game where totem power diminishes actually fits Shaman rather well. It's quite similar to the effect of, say, Battle Rage - and while Battle Rage doesn't outright destroy minions, to get the best out of that card typically means having or putting minions in a relatively easily removable state."
customhearthstone,3dnyu8,Arpet,0,Sat Jul 18 08:52:25 2015 UTC,"So it's like a slower battle rage with less card synergies, less potential and a bigger downside? That's a pretty good explanation and I both don't know enough to make a counterpoint and don't see anything that seems wrong. Fair enough, you're right.  I probably just want cool totem synergies rather than give them all two health and destroy them for cards."
customhearthstone,3dnyu8,Catman789,3,Sat Jul 18 09:20:17 2015 UTC,"I think the axe should just have more damage per overload active, as opposed to a battlecry. That makes it more usable, and it sounds fun to combo overload cards with higher damage."
customhearthstone,3dnyu8,SofaKingAsian,2,Sat Jul 18 02:52:44 2015 UTC,"I like the idea of having it gain attack equal to your current Overload rather than locking it in with a Battlecry. This allows you to plan turns ahead rather than comboing at the time of playing it.  I think the biggest problem with my current version or your version of the card is you can't play it on curve effectively.  Maybe it could be:   4 mana This weapon has +1 attack for each Overloaded mana crystal you have 3 attack 2 durability   The 3 attack makes it more usable on curve if you really need to use it on turn 4 and your effect can make the weapon grow in the right deck. On turn 6+ you can get a huge weapon for 4 mana easily, though, but if you consider you have a ton of locked mana for that effect its not too broken."

Look at Knife Juggler, he does the same without sacrificing stat points doing so, he also costs 2 mana so it's easier to combo him and he doesn't require minions from a specific tribe.  Compare it to Ship's cannon, that deals 2 damage each time you summon a pirate. It's a knife juggler on steroids precisely because of the synergy requirement.   This, on the other hand, accomplishes what knife juggler would and sacrifices hp and attack doing so. Yes, it's a murloc, which is good. But it feels too weak.   I think you could've gone a bit more wild, the idea of doing something when you summon a murloc is interesting and so is the idea of it costing a random stat point :)"

customhearthstone,3dpbxo,augustofretes,2,Sat Jul 18 04:49:08 2015 UTC,"Maybe a similar concept could be:  3 mana, 3/3  Every time you play a murloc, give it 1+1 and lose a stat point.  It's sort of a hobgoblin for murlocs. Any other idea? I'm just brainstorming :)."

It doesn't stack infinitely either, if the opponent had a 3 mana card, it became 4 mana, so even if this card lives it won't increase its cost any further.  It's really just a strong anti-aggro card (and may slow down other decks, but since they will eventually play their emperor, they can counter the effect). It's susceptible to silences and most of the time it will just die to a spell + a minion or + spell + ping.  You're assuming a lot.

But it proved to be too strong in creating out big game deciding combo decks (like Grim Warrior) that don't actually use any high cost cards. I think slow decks need a a little bit more of help before they become truly viable (in a non-warrior deck), a card that slows aggro and combo decks is exactly what thy need to coexist competitively with the rest.

Puzik is still vulnerable to direct removal, but you have to kill everything else on the board to get to him. At five health, he's vulnerable to kill command and fireball for removal, but frostbolt or quick shot wouldn't be enough. So he basically has to eat premium removal to get taken off the board. If you are using him against an aggro deck, that means the opponent has to either give up reach or give up a lot of minions to get rid of him (or they can just silence him).  He is undoubtedly stronger than Spellstopper, but I think that's okay be that card never actually sees play."

customhearthstone,3do4m9,lynbeaut,2,Sat Jul 18 04:52:51 2015 UTC,"It's meant to be the reverse of patient assassin, just not in the way you are thinking of. By my thinking, Patient Assassin is removal (control oriented) while Impatient Assassin is burn (aggro oriented). The patient player plays board control, while the impatient player goes straight for the burn.  For Impatient Assassin to be the reverse of Patient Assassin in the way you're thinking, it would either have to read ""Charge. Destroy any minion damaged by this minion."" or ""Battlecry: Destroy target minion."" Either of those is essentially Assassinate with a body, and that makes for kind of a stupid card.  Moreover, I put it in rogue because I think it would fit too well in Hunter, and has niche application in Rogue (Epic cards should be relatively niche). Rogue has some potential for burn (think Backspace rogue), but has need of early plays that it can buff. By having stealth, you greatly increase the chances that Impatient Assassin can live to take a cold blood."

customhearthstone,3dml6s,KenniHS,4,Fri Jul 17 16:13:47 2015 UTC,"Love the idea, but it would probably be balanced at 5 mana. Considering you need to have a mech in play, 5/5 worth of stats plus divine shield and taunt is reasonable for that much. A similar case is Houndmaster - 6/5 stats and taunt seems OP for 4 mana, but the condition of having a beast in play for that value makes it balanced."

Not to mention mechs are a far stronger 'neutral friendly' tribal than beast.  I was thinking more of Sunwalker, a (6)cost 4/5 neutral with taunt and divine shield. Then again by that logic I should have given the minion +1 health or made the buff be +1/+2 to make up for the lost .5 mana cost?  Thanks for the constructive comment ;)"
customhearthstone,3dml6s,traf12,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:39:25 2015 UTC,"I agree. Comparison to Druid of the Fang makes this point well. It's another conditional trigger, and also a 5 mana 4/4 base with a similarly sized benefit if the trigger procs."
customhearthstone,3dml6s,GenWilhelm,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:03:07 2015 UTC,A nice idea but 5/5 of stats is way too weak at 7 mana.
customhearthstone,3dml6s,jrkirby,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:13:02 2015 UTC,"All the people saying about the stats being weak for this card are right. However, I think that's fine, OP. Plenty of real cards are weaker, and it's got interesting mechanics."
customhearthstone,3dlzwk,hoorahforsnakes,4,Fri Jul 17 10:23:22 2015 UTC,"My main problem with the immune until end of turn mechanic is its just a really weak divine shield unless you have windfury (which won't happen for hunter).  For paladin, divine shield is on a 2/2 for 2, making it cost approximately 1 stat point. This is similarly costed for hunter, making it pretty balanced. It just seems a tad weaker, but its probably playable."
customhearthstone,3dlzwk,Mirrorminx,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:26:48 2015 UTC,"(Minor) Card Pedantry:  Battlecry: Give a friendly Beast Immune this turn.  (Capital B for the tribal, period at the end.)  I wonder if the effect could be stronger. Like Give adjacent Beasts Immune this turn? Similar cards - like Imp Gang Boss (can spawn multiple 1-1s) and Flamewaker (deal 1 damage to 2 random enemies after you cast a spell), seem to be a little stronger than this - comparing its effect to to Bestial Wrath which gives Immune and +2 attack for one turn for 1 mana."
customhearthstone,3dlzwk,h2g2Ben,5,Fri Jul 17 12:00:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it possibly could be stronger, my initial idea was for it to basically be bestial wrath on a stick, but then the effect would be worth 1 mana and that would mean it would need a weaker body, and i liked giving it a solid body because hunter doesn't have many options at 3 mana at the moment. 2/4 is something you don't mind dropping on its own in a pinch.   Also it has battlecry, so it has an immediate impact on the board, which imp gang boss does not. If you shadow word: pain an imp gang boss, it was just a vanilla 2/4, for example.  I think this card is strong enough, as it provides a lot of tempo gain.  Turn 2 you drop a dire wolf alpha, the drop a knife juggler, you deop this guy and 'trade' the dire wolf into the knife juggler.   That is a massive tempo swing that something like imp gang doesn't cause"

It, at a minimum, gives you three mana worth of tempo (probably more) for 1 more mana than nourish.   Emperor Thaurissan is probably not the power level you want a card balanced at, he's practically Dr. Boom (as he's played in pretty much every midrange and up deck). And this card is similarly bonkers, if not better.  The fact that it enables better burst combos on a class that's already good at it isn't very healthy either, regardless of mana cost. In the context of decks like Freezemage, mana cost reduction is amazingly overbearing. And you can have two!"

Compared to all the other 1 Mana damage spells, this is MUCH too strong.  It's not hard to play a 4+ attack minion and this in the same round.  Feral, not Ferel  Ozumat: Five hits to destroy a creature with 11 attack is insane.  Compare with Deathwing, which costs 2 mana more and destroys your entire hand.  Empowered Lich: Deathrattles cannot be targetted.  Purge Seeker: Needs ""Battlecry"" text  Soul Reaver: Needs ""Battlecry"" text  Revive: Less randomness means it should cost more.  Greater Heal: A little too powerful because Auchenai Soulpriest exists.  Therezane, the Stone Mother:It's Therazane, and is that really Therazane?  Lightning Shield: Permanently?  No way to get rid of it besides Majordomo/Jaraxxus.  This is VERY strong.  Fire Nova Totem: One health means it's too easily removed, especially for 3 mana.  For 3 mana you get Scarlet Crusader which is more or less guaranteed to deal three damage.  This thing takes 3 turns to deal that much, with 1 HP.  Elemental Precision: Besides certain rate circumstances, this is much worse than Lighting Bolt.  At the very least make the first hit 1 damage and the second 2 so it can pop divine shields.  Passive Aggressive Berserker: This is a bit too strong, especially in a class where it's easy to enrage something.  Overwhelm: Can be comboed with Mortal Strike and Gorehowl for a lot of damage for little mana.  Even 2 damage for 2 mana with the War Axe is good.  Sure Shield Slam also does tons of damage for little mana, but it's harder to build up a large armor stack without the opponent depleting it.  Weapons are a lot harder for people to get rid of.  Massive Shield: Soaking four hits is MASSIVE value.  Fear: Should probably be worded as ""Silence, THEN Can't Attack""  Ogrimmar Guard: Flat out superior to Stormwind Guard?  IMBA BLIZZ PLZ NERF  Iron Horde Initiate: If it attacks and trades with the only other minion on the battlefield, does its ability keep it alive?  Flesh Walker: Deathrattles cannot be targetted.  Fel Rider: Deathrattles cannot be targetted.  Also, damage since when, the beginning of the game?  If you have 10 life does it let off a 20 damage nuke?  Arcane Guardian: A lot of the deathrattles are not good for you, making this card very risky to play.  Deathlord, Dancing Swords, and Zombie Chow all cost less than 3 mana.  Dread Stalker: If it gains Taunt, the stealth nullified it, and you can't attack to get rid of it until your next turn.  Yogg'Saron: Deathrattles cannot be targetted.

Or less attack?  Empowered lich pics the creature that has the deathrattle. That creature is added to your hand upon death. I meant for it to be battlecry.  Typos too, forgetting to add text, its 175 cards. there was bound to be errors but I tried not to create them.  And I thought therazane had a humanoid form. I found it more pleasing to the eye and the card art better than the rest.  Change overwhelm to minions only. Bam, shield slam part 2.  Massive shield now 2/2  Fear and haunt aren't that way so the minion can attack again, just like how fear and haunt aren't permanent effects. If it was a 1 mana can't attack itd be bullshit as hell. But if it was can't attack for one turn itd be a worse freeze. So I came up with the concept of being able to silence it as well to pseudo buff it.  Ogri and storm gaurd are failures and I'm aware of this now.  No iron horde doesn't live. It takes damage but can't drop below 1 health.

customhearthstone,3dk0y8,Velentina,2,Fri Jul 17 01:29:34 2015 UTC,"I like most of these, but I'd rewrite a lot of the text to make it consistent with the game. Certain things are pretty consistent in real card text, such as always capitalizing ""Attack"" (when referring to the Attack value of a character), ""Health,"" and all bold effect keywords like ""Taunt,"" ""Divine Shield,"" etc. Furthermore, those bold words are always bold, even when a card is only referring to them. Your Forest Walker says ""+2/0"" and ""+0/2,"" which should be ""+2 Attack"" and ""+2 Health,"" but you did switch to the correct notation in your later cards. However, if an effect is affecting both of those stats, it should be written ""+1/+1"" instead of ""+1/1.""  Official cards also have pretty consistent language. Where you say something like ""Heal Y for X,"" Blizzard's cards would say ""Restore X health to Y."" Where you say ""If you're at X life,"" Blizz would say ""If your hero has X Health.""  There some more specific wording issues, but I won't go into those unless you want me to.  In terms of actual mechanics, I did notice a few problems. First of all, like /u/sonpansatan said, Deathrattles can't be targeted. The game is designed such that each player's turn is meant for that player alone to act. Certain things on the board like Secrets and triggered effects can react to the acting player, but players cannot interrupt each other's turns to take any kind of action.  Next, your Harpeth says ""Enrage: Draw a card."" Enrage is a persistent effect; it's ON when the minion is not at full Health and OFF when it is. With that in mind, Harpeth's effect doesn't really make sense, and I'm picturing a player watching helplessly as they endlessly draw cards after their Harpeth takes damage. I'm not sure if you intended the effect to trigger only the first time Harpeth takes damage or any time it takes damage at full health (such as after being healed), but you'd have to write it without Enrage. I do, however, like your Flesh Giant's ""Enrage: Die."""

customhearthstone,3dlaae,platypoo2345,3,Fri Jul 17 08:28:26 2015 UTC,"Just saying ""Explosives do no damage"" is enough in itself. Anything that is not a battlecry or a deathrattles means it's in effect as long as the minion is alive, no need to repeat it.  Also, you should explain what you consider explosive. Mad(der) Bomber bombs? Boom bots? Demolisher? You probably designed this as a Dr Boom counter but it's way to situational as it is. Well balanced in my opinion though."
customhearthstone,3dlaae,BonomDenej,1 point,Fri Jul 17 09:19:52 2015 UTC,"I thought about that too. Would cards like arcane explosion count?  I think only cards that are directly ""bomb"" related. So, demolisher, mad bomber, boom bots, and perhaps lightbomb or darkbomb."
customhearthstone,3dlaae,BonomDenej,2,Fri Jul 17 15:40:11 2015 UTC,"Well, the effect is too special and not well defined in the game, your card couldn't really be viable because of that. Maybe you should try something like ""All damage dealt randomly are reduced to 0"", which would include all the explosives you thought off (Lightbomb and Darkbomb excluded), and add interesting stuff like the Knife Juggler, Shadow Boxer and other stuff like that. But then the card should definitely be a 3/2 as the effect is much more powerful."

customhearthstone,3dil05,JotWorksMedia,13,Sun Jul 19 17:21:02 2015 UTC,"It's a very interesting idea - I would probably make it cost 8 though, considering it can deal 20 damage all of a sudden, and Paladins can combo it with maybe a turn 7 (w/ coin) Lay on Hands to heal back up."
customhearthstone,3dil05,ME24saken,6,Thu Jul 16 16:09:49 2015 UTC,"10 damage to your own health is roughly a 3 mana penalty. At 9 mana, a spell is allowed to do 7-10 damage, as Blizz has practically decided that a single card shouldn't do more than 10. Playing this with 20 health is thus fine, but above that it becomes OP. On T6 it really isn't hard for a Paladin to have 20 or more health and for 6 mana it is easy enough to combo it with Holy Light or (with Coin or ET) with Healbot. However, once you drop too far below 20 health, this card loses efficiency fast.    I think that at 8 mana, this card is a lot fairer. Midrange decks will then have had a chance to sufficiently reduce your health and control decks will have enough health as buffer and options to heal next turn. In this case it's function comes close to Alex, alas without the body and defensive option, but with the possibility to kill your opponent.    Whether this card would be 'fun' still remains to be tested. Like the nerf to Pyroblast and Mindcontrol have shown, balanced does not always equal fun. With pre-equiped weapons or minions on the board, it's range becomes much higher, maybe surpassing the health cap. However, I don't know how realistic that situation is. You definitely don't want this card to be effective for every Paladin deck, but rather a surprise cheese option for control decks.    I'd like to add that this card is very fitting for the Paladin feel in Hearthstone. The concept is definitely very clever, but I can't tell how it'd perform ingame."
customhearthstone,3dil05,coyoteTale,3,Thu Jul 16 16:38:09 2015 UTC,"Really appreciate any comments on balance, because right now I have no idea if it's coated correctly."

customhearthstone,3dil05,TwinkleTwinkleBaby,3,Fri Jul 17 04:07:20 2015 UTC,"I was going to say that, if anything, this card is underpowered. It is a win more card: in order to help you, you have to have a significant health advantage, in which case you would probably win without this card. Further, this card is only useful during a very narrow slice of the game: after turn 6, while you have more than 15 health, and your opponent has less health. Otherwise, this card will sit in your hand as a dead card or flat out lose you the entire game.  I think it is interesting, innovative, and potentially powerful, but is far from OP."
customhearthstone,3dil05,cardinalxc,2,Thu Jul 16 22:59:23 2015 UTC,"in order to help you, you have to have a significant health advantage   I disagree. It's fairly easy to imagine an aggressive deck which can deal 10 damage to an opponent by turn 6, keeping them on the back foot so you still have most or all of your hp. Also remember Paladin has access to good healing if they want it, so the drawback isn't as severe as it would be for some other classes."

Symmetrical effects are only good if they somehow benefit you more that your opponent, or is something that your deck can take more advantage of. This card does not do this. I'd make it only summon you Boombots at the end of your turn, to make up for its terrible stats, as well as make it 6 health and no stealth."

customhearthstone,3dly65,mylifemyworld17,3,Fri Jul 17 17:20:38 2015 UTC,"Gigantic Bear is way too strong. Going by the vanilla test it should be an 8/9 but it can have another stat (maybe two) for being a class card. 8/10 or 9/9 is still super strong (especially compared to Ironbark protector).   Overcharging Elemental is also way overpowered. The other 4 mana 5/6s we have in the game have HUGE downsides. Pit Lord deals 1/6th of your max health to you, and Hungry Dragon gives the opponent a minion. This doesn't have enough of a drawback and creates massive pressure for only 4 mana.  Divine Monstrosity is fine, but it should be only at the end of your turn. It's too strong by making it the end of each turn.  Fiendish Friendeater is a better void terror in almost every way. It's straight up OP."
customhearthstone,3dly65,mylifemyworld17,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:30:15 2015 UTC,"Would you play a 8 mana 9/9? No. You'd play rag or cenarius.  Overcharging Elemental is pretty OP. Maybe ""When this minion deals damage""?  Divine Shield is a little rare, so I feel the Monstrosity won't be a big balance problem.  Fiendish Friendeater is inferior to the Void Terror in one important way: You can't pick and choose which things to target, so you can't trigger deathrattles etc. It may seem similar, but IMO it is very different."
customhearthstone,3dly65,PureQuestionHS,2,Fri Jul 17 15:54:35 2015 UTC,"I'd play an 8 mana 9/9 if I could have two of them in my deck, especially in a ramp-esque druid.   That changes nothing for Overcharging elemental since it's only method of dealing damage is attacking (outside of betrayal but lbr that's never played).  I still think Monstronsity is a bit too strong, maybe give it +1/+1 not +1/+2. Or, have it give a random minion divine shield after destroying them all. Your opponent can benefit off this but so can you, and it provides constant fodder to the effect if left untouched. Could probably be a legendary this way.  You're right, I didn't think about that. I would still set its base stats lower, though. 3/3 is probably more fair since Voidcaller then Coin+ Friendeater is ridiculous value (5 mana 7/9 plus the deathrattle) and the fact that it could pull out mal'ganis or jaraxxus makes 4/5 way too strong."

customhearthstone,3dicgo,Aleksx000,4,Thu Jul 16 14:46:52 2015 UTC,"Agreed. What if I had effects with multiple secrets? Like it could do this or further buff Avenge, whichever activates first? That would add some more secrecy."
customhearthstone,3dicgo,h2g2Ben,4,Thu Jul 16 18:32:41 2015 UTC,"The thing is, this card has massive bluff potential too.

customhearthstone,3dicgo,Aleksx000,2,Fri Jul 17 09:05:15 2015 UTC,"Well no, the point with bluffing is you don't always bluff. Sometimes you play avenge and bluff to victory, sometimes you play eye for an eye and they think you're bluffing, or they don't and just don't attack - and if they attack anyway, then great! Value! Hell you might even bait out a silence if you're really lucky.  It's like bluffing a freezing trap when all your opponent has is a big minion, even though all you played was explosive trap. They might fearlessly play into it and you get burned, or they take the bluff and lose out on damage because of it. Bluffing isn't this one-time-only thing."

Attacking or dealing 2 damage will make it lose stealth and likely die before the next turn.   So it's a 5 mana creature that draws you one card per turn until you're desperate enough for 2-5 damage. Compared to Nourish, this is great value if you draw 2 or more times. Draw 2 cards + deal 2-5 damage > Draw 3 cards.   If it's ability goes off once or not at all, it's a bad deal for the mana. Almost any area effects (or random effects) can counter this to make it risky enough to play.   Overall I think it's decently balanced and an interesting concept. Having cards like this would make it necessary to put more cards like Flamecannon in the game though."
customhearthstone,3dj24s,ladrlee,2,Thu Jul 16 17:52:09 2015 UTC,"Most of these are decently balanced with the possible exception of sentry totem, maybe make it +1 heath. I don't think a nontech two drop should shut down a zoo.   Also you should balance tremor totem by making it deal damage to your own stuff too. That healing totem synergy yo."

customhearthstone,3dj24s,Azureraider,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:38:07 2015 UTC,"On Turn 2 that means it could only be a 2/3, assuming they played a minion. I don't see whats wrong with it being good against decks like Zoo or Face Hunter. So it might be good against them but its shit against Freeze Mage. The same way Ragnaros is a really good card in Control matchups but is shit against Zoo and Face Hunter. Also keep in mind, it's still susceptible to silence.  For 2 mana minions, 5-6 stat points is around the average for class cards. This has 3 stat points. I think the 2-3 stat point trade off is more than enough to justify the 1 damage AoE. Also its only 1 damage that can't be buffed by spell damage. Also Shaman doesn't really benefit from healing its own minions like Priest does. If anything that would make the Priest matchup even better for Priest. It feels like a huge nerf to do that."
customhearthstone,3dj24s,yumyum36,2,Thu Jul 16 23:55:28 2015 UTC,"It's just OP for its stats for something that's mostly easy to trigger.  Like if it has a trigger, it should have a downside somewhere. Maybe it should start with 0 health so it sucks if the opponent has no minions and has weakness to silence?  Because a 2/2 for 2 with taunt is the base anyways."

customhearthstone,3dj5mu,Bavince,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:16:54 2015 UTC,"It might be tough to activate, but this card is still incredibly strong for just a 5 mana epic. If you manage to kill even just 2 minions, that'll gain you a huge lead and even if you can't activate this guy's effect, you're still left with a solid 5/5 body."
customhearthstone,3dj5mu,Coolboypai,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:06:55 2015 UTC,"same as... tauren crusher, or other minions on the board?  does it mean it will kill a two drop if there are multiple two drops? or a two drop if mana is chosen and 2 one minion is chosen as an example?"
customhearthstone,3dj5mu,fae_lai,0,Fri Jul 17 05:20:37 2015 UTC,"This is in any case an Assassinate with a 5/5 body. It has three options, therefore extremely versatile, and can unleash killing sprees, giving you a huge advantage.  Way too strong. It needs to cost at least 8. And even then I would play it in every deck."
customhearthstone,3dj5mu,Aleksx000,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:36:17 2015 UTC,"I thought the condition was it killed all enemies that had the same cost, attack, and health."

If it is your definition, there would be no slashes in the card text.  If it only kills 5 Attack/5 Health/5 Cost, it needs to be better worded for sure."
customhearthstone,3dj5mu,Aleksx000,2,Thu Jul 16 20:20:06 2015 UTC,I think that it is so that you can kill all minions with 5 cost or 5 attack or 5 health

customhearthstone,3dhgyn,LTKnuckles,4,Fri Jul 17 03:40:51 2015 UTC,"I like the idea and I see where you're going with it, but it's overcosted. Compare to twilight drake - same cost, one more attack, but it's going to end up with less health and you have to destroy a minion."
customhearthstone,3dhnog,lynbeaut,3,Thu Jul 16 10:20:39 2015 UTC,"By ""on curve"" do you mean a card that costs as much mana as you will have next turn?

customhearthstone,3dh6al,moocow1452,-3,Thu Jul 16 13:54:54 2015 UTC,unlocking you're overload crystals costs 1 mana at the least.

customhearthstone,3dh6al,nutshells,3,Thu Jul 16 10:54:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah this is what i tried to do with the card, cause Lava burst's mana cost is too high to make the card useful and shaman already got a lot of damage spells.

customhearthstone,3djpce,barghunos,0,Thu Jul 16 20:39:42 2015 UTC,"Battlecry? Also, it needs a drawback, probably overload (2)."
customhearthstone,3djpce,JustXYZ13,3,Fri Jul 17 04:32:45 2015 UTC,It's not a Battlecry he gains the attack while they are overloaded and loses the attack when they return to normal. So in one sense giving him overload would kind off buff him. Either way i Don't think he deserves Overload (2) at max it could be overload (1)
customhearthstone,3djpce,augustofretes,1 point,Fri Jul 17 07:07:22 2015 UTC,"Actually, this is not too strong. The idea that it should be nerfed is ridiculous. It's basically a class specific Yeti (so it's expected that is better than neutral equivalents). Mechanical Yeti sees some limited play because it's a mech and because it may provide you with a spare part (that are strong in tempo mage).   If you play this on curve, it's just a Yeti (that turn). Nothing better, nothing worse. If you add overload (1) then it becomes a 6/5 that won't let you play a 5 drop next turn.  Compare this to fireguard destroyer, that barely sees play, that minion, in its worst state is a 4/6 with overload (1), almost same number of stats distributed in a better way (imho) and his stats point won't go away if you don't overload constantly. At best, fireguard destroyer is a 7/6.  I don't think this minion would see much play. The one combo I can think off that could be good is Spirit Knight into Earth Elemental. That would leave you with a (for one turn) 10/5 and a 7/8 with taunt on turn 5 (but you'd lose your turn 6 to pull that off)."
customhearthstone,3dfy7f,Nostalgia37,5,Wed Jul 15 23:32:14 2015 UTC,"I know nothing about warcraft lore, so the name/art was pretty arbitrary. In terms of balance it might be a little too strong, since it is guaranteed to at least cycle itself. I was hoping that the draw back would be enough to leave it at 2 mana, but 3 mana is probably just as reasonable.   It's got a lot of versatility in it in the sense that you can use it to mill people (coldlight would draw 4 cards each), or for your own card draw against combo and other draw heavy decks. Playing it on turn 2 would make handlock think twice about tapping."

customhearthstone,3dddf1,TosyV1,6,Wed Jul 15 12:33:29 2015 UTC,"Absolutely.  You can't kill it with minion trades.  That means you either have to put down a taunt and hope they can't remove it, or kill the succubus with spells.  Unfortunately, it has 4 health, which puts it out of removal range of anything remotely cheap.  It's very possible for the succubus to singlehandedly win you the match on the spot because it can't be reasonably answered."
customhearthstone,3dddf1,Ellikichi,3,Wed Jul 15 15:19:14 2015 UTC,Can the fact that Succubus itself sucks (And can ruin the other card required for your combo) balance it?
customhearthstone,3dddf1,Godzilla_original,2,Thu Jul 16 03:06:49 2015 UTC,"I appreciate that point, and I think your other Empowered Demons are at a more reasonable power level.  But it's just too much.  The effect is so powerful and so frustrating to play around that it's almost impossible to balance.  As was said elsewhere, if it made ALL other minions unable to attack it might be okay, but since it's just your opponent's minions it puts the game on a very short clock and is absurdly hard to remove."
customhearthstone,3dddf1,Ellikichi,4,Thu Jul 16 03:36:34 2015 UTC,"Succubus is a bad card though.   If you didn't notice, the unplayable cards got better buffs."
customhearthstone,3dddf1,shiftup72,6,Wed Jul 15 15:06:56 2015 UTC,still too op. if your opponent doesn't have hard removal you just win
customhearthstone,3dddf1,herrabanani,0,Wed Jul 15 17:29:34 2015 UTC,"so 3 cards + 5 mana  to force your opponent to have a silence, hard removal, or 4 damage of burn or battlecries. Yeah okay its a little op, but only cause its on turn three."

customhearthstone,3dddf1,lehnugget,9,Wed Jul 15 17:01:43 2015 UTC,"One way to Balance succubus would maybe be to give ALL minions ""Can't Attack"" and lower its health to 2. That way it acts like a delay which is beneficial to things like handlock, and doesn't stop your opponent completely in his tracks if he lacks silence. It also forces your opponent to use a removal/weapon (even  small one) on it which provides a great boost to tempo.  It also works thematically as the succubus charms everyone but the summoner.   I can kind of see what you were going for with the succubus by forcing either a silence/taunt/spell, but the hp was too high to accomplish that. Most taunts don't have more than 3 attack, and when you can still play minions and attack then the succubus doesn't need to be traded at all. Requiring spells can really hurt some classes, especially since most spells played do 2-3 damage, or are late game spells that cannot be used for several turns after succubus.  And requiring a silence is always a bad design choice since it is so rare compared to the other mechanics."

customhearthstone,3dddf1,GrumpySatan,5,Wed Jul 15 16:17:00 2015 UTC,"The wording for the Empower effect is really long and unnecessary. It would be better to make empower a keyword and phrase it like ""Empower a friendly non-legendary demon.""   Other than that and the Succubus I really like everything. They are all really good cards but require a combo to be created, and only so many demons can realistically be empowered in a game.  Does Archimonde empower ALL demons (including enemies?). I would maybe change it into ""Battlecry: Empower all friendly demons"" including the ones in the deck since it is such a late game card and you can't really play many other demons the same turn."
customhearthstone,3dddf1,arbiterNaL,5,Wed Jul 15 13:59:02 2015 UTC,Good idea but the fact that empowered demons are not intuitive means that blizzard would never do anything like this.  I do wish empowered demons were a thing...
customhearthstone,3dddf1,Bluecone,3,Wed Jul 15 14:29:12 2015 UTC,"The curse cards are a very interesting mechanic that I really like. One thing to note is that blizzard gave heroes hero powers so players always feel like they can do something on their turn even if they can't play cards. I think Curse of Weakness should add 1 cost to cast a hero power rather than straight up denying it. Imagine getting 2 Curse of Weaknesses or a Curse of Weakness + Curse of Tongues on your turn 4 and not having a playable card from your deck from bad luck. You will be spending your whole turn just dumping the curse cards out of your hand and doing nothing else, not very fun in my opinion.  Let me know if you ever make Curse of Elements and Curse of Exhaustion as I'd like to see your take on them in Hearthstone."

customhearthstone,3dfat1,h2g2Ben,2,Wed Jul 15 22:43:16 2015 UTC,Its pretty mediorce because a 1/3 for 2 simply cant cut it. Only getting a benefit after 4 turns is also a huge turn off because if this minion manages to stay on the board for 4 turns you probably already won the game.  Needs to cost less and/or reduce the amount of turns it takes to buff itself. Adjust the stats gained accordingly.
customhearthstone,3dfat1,SuperomegaOP,1 point,Thu Jul 16 05:25:15 2015 UTC,Maybe after 2 turns gain +2/+2. After 4 turns gain an  Additional +2/+2 would be better.  Or after 2 turns gain +1/+1. After 4 turns gain +3/+3.
customhearthstone,3dfat1,captain_dickydoo,1 point,Thu Jul 16 06:05:16 2015 UTC,"Cool concept. It obviously strikes a resemblance to Shade of Naxxramas or Micro Machine. However, it's much weaker compared to those.  Considering the stats and costs, it'll be quite easily removed before the bonus takes effect.

customhearthstone,3df9cm,Sinfusion,8,Wed Jul 15 20:27:55 2015 UTC,This would be fine as a 5/5. It's a niche card that only fits one type of deck - compare it to goblin blast mage.

customhearthstone,3dflpc,ElFantasmo,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:57:37 2015 UTC,"Agreed, I feel like it should be ""CHOOSE ONE: give friendly minions +0/+2[maybe +0/+3 since but I'm not sure ]or heal all friendly characters by 4[maybe 5 I'm not fully sure how big the heal should be], I'm not fully sure about the values, because it'd probs need playtesting, but this is much better than the card right now, plus it sticks to the same kind of ideas, buffs and regenerating minions."

customhearthstone,3df5za,Aqua_Dragon,5,Wed Jul 15 20:04:19 2015 UTC,"It deserves to be a 2/2. 1/2 is just no threat, 2/2 lets it trade with other 2 drops while still being weak enough to let the enemy choose not to attack it."
customhearthstone,3df5za,jaypenn3,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:30:51 2015 UTC,"I may have been conservative since I was using Annoyotron as kind of my reference point. I thought about the pros and cons this had and, at least initially, felt the pros may justify the 1-2 stat allocation.  Pros compared to Annoy  -Stronger against charges  -More difficult to remove early game when minions are fewer  -Potential for more than two damage blocks  Cons compared to Annoy  -More susceptible to damaging spells  -Can only block one minion hit to face, compared to Annoy's forced two blocks  Perhaps those pros don't outweigh the cons enough to justify the 1-2 however. This is my first custom card so I can see why 2-2 would be better."
customhearthstone,3df5za,jaypenn3,2,Wed Jul 15 20:40:05 2015 UTC,"At first I actually misinterpreted the minions ability, I thought it was just attacks on this minion not all friendly characters. I was comparing it to shielded minibot so I thought it needed the attack but I may be wrong. But when comparing it to annoy-o-tron it isnt right to say it only blocks one attack. While it is easier to kill with spells and end the effect, everyone has to kill this minion right as it comes out, so it will usually block two attacks.   I agree with the original stats on this card, 2/2 might make it too strong."
customhearthstone,3df5za,h2g2Ben,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:55:55 2015 UTC,"I think I could have worded it better to indicate the first enemy minion each turn, as opposed to the next enemy minion absolutely. Probably with an ""Each Turn, "" preface."

customhearthstone,3deg9e,h2g2Ben,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:41:43 2015 UTC,"I find the concept interesting, but these cards don't really work with the mechanics of the board. I can play it my turn, but if the enemy drops or trades any minion there is no longer something opposite the buffed minion."
customhearthstone,3deg9e,mylifemyworld17,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:50:21 2015 UTC,I don't know what this means.
customhearthstone,3deg9e,OkeanPiscez,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:05:37 2015 UTC,"On the game board where enemies are placed, they are all parallel. So, on your side, a minion could be right under an enemy minion. This card makes it so when you cast it on a friendly minion, the enemy minion directly above it cannot attack."
customhearthstone,3deg9e,mylifemyworld17,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:43:36 2015 UTC,"ok what if there's no minion opposite it? it's useless then, right?"
customhearthstone,3deg9e,OkeanPiscez,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:48:16 2015 UTC,"I would assume that it gives a friendly minion a buff that lasts until it dies. So if you cast it and the minion above it dies, another minion played might take its place."
customhearthstone,3deg9e,mylifemyworld17,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:50:31 2015 UTC,"Right, but this is then more likely than not negative tempo. You're paying 3 mana for something very, very easy to play around."
customhearthstone,3deg9e,OkeanPiscez,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:52:41 2015 UTC,I agree that the mana cost should be reduced to 1 or even 0 since it IS very easy to circumvent.
customhearthstone,3da7vt,Marhiin,54,Tue Jul 14 18:31:39 2015 UTC,I love that at the end he's just a 0/1 taking up space on the board.

customhearthstone,3da7vt,rbdrachir,1 point,Wed Jul 15 05:25:22 2015 UTC,"Feel like he should maybe be a 3/2, as the rest of the time he's the 'best vanilla stats' kind of minion and then randomly a 2/3. It's probably fine, just seems like something to me"
customhearthstone,3da7vt,mandragara,2,Wed Jul 15 10:49:20 2015 UTC,the health and damage seem to scale down by one each time so 2/3 makes the most sense in the pattern it just happen 4/5 and 3/4 are really strong stats.
customhearthstone,3dcubn,gumbogogo,1 point,Wed Jul 15 07:16:51 2015 UTC,"I originally planned on making a card that permanently gives your hero +1 attack or something like that, but ended up with this which feels more like the other ancients."
customhearthstone,3dcubn,lynbeaut,1 point,Wed Jul 15 07:18:14 2015 UTC,I think the body could be bigger. The effect seems fine though.
customhearthstone,3dcubn,lynbeaut,1 point,Wed Jul 15 09:38:14 2015 UTC,"I tried to balance it around being a 5/5, since that's what the other Ancients are.  The tempo gained from either of Ancient of Lore's abilities make the 5/5 body feel pretty good for the 7 mana and I feel like these abilities can do a lot as far as swinging the game. Especially so when adding your hero power onto these effects (kill Thaurisan, or any 5 health thing for that matter, even the opponent)."
customhearthstone,3dcubn,arbiterNaL,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:59:58 2015 UTC,"I think its pretty balanced, after re-looking at it. :) It seems pretty decent to me!"
customhearthstone,3dcubn,lynbeaut,0,Wed Jul 15 17:45:25 2015 UTC,If the body's bigger its a superior guardian of kings
customhearthstone,3dcubn,Exodus100,1 point,Wed Jul 15 11:25:19 2015 UTC,"Hmm I guess so. Iduno, it just seems worse than the other Ancients. But maybe its more balanced than I think it is. It is quite a bit better than Shieldmaiden, and is only 1 more mana, so Iduno."
customhearthstone,3dcubn,arbiterNaL,1 point,Wed Jul 15 11:36:14 2015 UTC,Different classes can have better cards with the same effect for the same cost. Take Frostbolt vs Darkbomb
customhearthstone,3dcubn,darwinianfacepalm,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:01:40 2015 UTC,"guardian of kings is already high value though, this isn't akin to darkbomb v frostbolt, it's more like designing a card to be superior to frostbolt"
customhearthstone,3dcubn,arbiterNaL,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:04:13 2015 UTC,Guardian of kings isn't high value in constructed. It's rarely used.

customhearthstone,3dcw6e,arbiterNaL,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:27:58 2015 UTC,Might be a too undercosted given that paladin secrets only cost 1. You can easily drop a bunch of secrets and then gain copies back with this minion for some pretty decent value
customhearthstone,3dcw6e,Coolboypai,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:47:00 2015 UTC,But you have to play secrets and even then it isn't a mad scientist.
customhearthstone,3dcw6e,Burning_Titan,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:03:05 2015 UTC,paladin secrets only cost 1 mana though which is my main point. spending 1 mana to play a card isnt all that hard...
customhearthstone,3dcw6e,Coolboypai,2,Wed Jul 15 18:08:39 2015 UTC,It requires setup though - The setup being the 1 mana
customhearthstone,3dcw6e,Sinfusion,2,Wed Jul 15 22:15:28 2015 UTC,"A relatively easy setup as I keep saying. Even if on turn 4 you play a single secret followed by this card, you're still getting okay value"
customhearthstone,3dcw6e,Coolboypai,1 point,Thu Jul 16 11:51:48 2015 UTC,You're ignoring the part where Paladin secrets aren't worth running. Most players will not go through the trouble of running a bunch of terrible secrets and this understatted 3-drop just to play more terrible secrets again later. If Mad Scientist couldn't get Paladins to run secrets this worse card won't. All this card does is enable a fun secrets pally to play around with that will not be viable outside of that.
customhearthstone,3dcw6e,KenniHS,2,Thu Jul 16 05:19:42 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say that paladin secrets aren't worth running, they just don't fit well into their control decks. Secrets like noble sacrifice and avenge aren't bad for reducing your opponent's tempo and see use in more aggressive and midrange decks.  Chances are that more paladin secrets will be added in the future as well and it might be limiting on what kinds of secrets can made if such a card like this was around"
customhearthstone,3df0tu,barghunos,3,Wed Jul 15 19:29:49 2015 UTC,"I know it's not very practical, but I think it'd be awesome if this was a 6 mana card with adjusted stats, so you could play it and the buff on turn 10, I dunno   Looks cool"

customhearthstone,3df0tu,Lyreite,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:35:25 2015 UTC,"Impact for an high cost legendary has to either be an immediate impact on the board (Rag) or give crazy advantage in the long term (Ysera). Sadly, Gour does neither. BoK isn't enough to justify his cost."
customhearthstone,3df0tu,Jaegster,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:40:31 2015 UTC,What if he removed the cost of BoK by (2) and possibly took away 1 health point. Would that make it better?
customhearthstone,3df0tu,Lyreite,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:43:21 2015 UTC,"You don't even need to remove the health point. Honestly, he could probably be a 7/7 with that effect."

customhearthstone,3df0tu,Maxmar1337,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:47:49 2015 UTC,"How about him being a 6 mana card, with 4/4, charge and this BoK effect. So you could deal 8 dmg by turn 10 in an instant."
customhearthstone,3df0tu,Jahboygan,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:05:45 2015 UTC,Would that not be a worse king crush?
customhearthstone,3df0tu,Maxmar1337,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:09:14 2015 UTC,"Yes. That is correct. But it would give paladin some kind of finisher and it would be something ""paladin themed"".

customhearthstone,3daju8,Manlyarmpits,2,Tue Jul 14 21:17:46 2015 UTC,"Cool card and pretty balanced.  Interesting interactions with Muster for Battle, Paladin hero power, Unleash, and a bunch of other token creators."

customhearthstone,3davvv,glaird25,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:17:51 2015 UTC,IMO they're all pretty OP.  The  unbound elementalist especially.  With just 2 overloaded crystals it is a 3-6 for 2 cost.
customhearthstone,3davvv,pachoproto,4,Wed Jul 15 04:40:04 2015 UTC,"yeah, but its a card that shaman desperately needs. Turn 3 or 4 lightning storms or feral sprits is incredibly hard to follow up as with other overload cards. An okay minion that can be silenced and needs to be comboed for good use should be fair for such purposes"

customhearthstone,3davvv,IamChaoz,6,Wed Jul 15 03:35:27 2015 UTC,"Eh, debatable I suppose. I'd argue sylvanas' strengths come more from the threat of taking a minion alongside a solid 5/5 minion rather than the actual effect itself."
customhearthstone,3davvv,Azureraider,3,Wed Jul 15 03:42:16 2015 UTC,It's pretty much the only card it's good with
customhearthstone,3davvv,psycho-logical,2,Wed Jul 15 03:41:31 2015 UTC,I don't know. You could probably pull off some pretty sick Malygos combos with it.

customhearthstone,3dcahu,glaird25,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:45:02 2015 UTC,Yup. He is very strong when comboed with those effects. His downside is that the opponent needs a pretty beefy board for him to be better then just a azure-drake+whirlwind.     Plus his body isn't the greatest for his mana cost
customhearthstone,3dcahu,FrenchRocks69,1 point,Wed Jul 15 07:23:14 2015 UTC,"The effect is decent, but the body itself is terrible."
customhearthstone,3dcahu,Zingy_1914,3,Wed Jul 15 05:49:01 2015 UTC,The effect is powerful enough I feel to justify the terrible body. Combined with whirlwind is a twisting nether + (not the greatest) body

customhearthstone,3dcahu,RomanoffBlitzer,-6,Wed Jul 15 19:31:10 2015 UTC,"uh, anti-syngery?  why would you want a 7 mana card that destroys your own patrons?"
customhearthstone,3dcahu,lynbeaut,8,Wed Jul 15 05:22:22 2015 UTC,Not every Warrior card has to work in one type of deck.
customhearthstone,3dcahu,mylifemyworld17,-4,Wed Jul 15 05:48:24 2015 UTC,"Yes, but my point still stands for those warrior decks that its anti-synergy with. This is as if Prophet Velen (priest legendary) negated any healing, to counter other healing decks. Uh, what? Or something similar. It has a place, but its just kinda too unusual to really be effective."
customhearthstone,3dcahu,lynbeaut,1 point,Wed Jul 15 05:52:05 2015 UTC,What are you even talking about? This would be pretty great in control warrior.
customhearthstone,3dcahu,mylifemyworld17,-1,Wed Jul 15 14:19:00 2015 UTC,How does control warrior damage a lot of minions to kill them with this?
customhearthstone,3dcahu,lynbeaut,3,Wed Jul 15 15:14:56 2015 UTC,"Whirlwind, Death's Bite, Revenge."
customhearthstone,3dcahu,mylifemyworld17,0,Wed Jul 15 15:15:31 2015 UTC,"As a control warrior, are you really putting all this stuff (plus this legendary) in your deck, then feasibly waiting til at least turn 7, to drop a 7/2 to blow up your opponents board? Deaths bite and whirlwind are ran (and sometimes revenge) ill admit that. But is it feasible for all these to align, with a 7 drop 7/2 to wipe an opponents board? Then you can possibly catch back up from there?"
customhearthstone,3dcahu,lynbeaut,2,Wed Jul 15 15:59:10 2015 UTC,"Whirlwind and Death's Bite are already run, this could easily replace another fringe legendary in Control Warrior, for example Harrison in a less weapon heavy meta. It's a great tech choice in Warrior to come back, since you rarely have more than one or two minions on board in Control Warrior. You sound like you haven't played much or any of Control Warrior, tbh, which is fine. It would be phenomenal in the deck."
customhearthstone,3dcahu,mylifemyworld17,0,Wed Jul 15 16:04:17 2015 UTC,"Ive played plenty of control warrior. And I can rarely think of when my opponent ever has straight up damaged minions. One, after they attack into Sludge Belcher. 2, if they survive whirlwind and/or deaths bite. That is about the only time. And then its only a couple of minions, that either die right away to something else. I think you're imagining the best case scenario for this card. Which is only going to happen like, once out of quite a few games. I don't think the effect is bad. I just don't think its going to be as absolutely mind-boggling as you think it is. Heck, this minion seems just like a worse geddon. And Geddon isnt always ran."
customhearthstone,3dcahu,lynbeaut,2,Wed Jul 15 17:48:18 2015 UTC,"Not at all...? You see no value in using a whirlwind then using this to do a board clear? Then you can still armor up? This could easily happen every game, it's not a complex combo."
customhearthstone,3dcahu,mylifemyworld17,0,Wed Jul 15 17:49:20 2015 UTC,"Whirlwind plus this is 8 mana... An 8 mana 7/2 that might clear a few minions (which brawl already does? Which geddon can do on turn 7, which is a 7/5)? Uh."
customhearthstone,3dcgsk,Drevoc,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:42:48 2015 UTC,"personally I think this is a bit overcosted. Argent commander has the same attack and divine shield for just 6 mana. 4 more health isn't really worth it for 2 more mana and the additional taunts your opponent gets especially since health is slightly less relevant for divine shield minions wierd moment here, just read what I said below"
customhearthstone,3dcgsk,Coolboypai,2,Wed Jul 15 17:37:22 2015 UTC,"Argent Commander has got 4 attack though, and the card doesn't say anything about your opponent getting the 0/2 Taunts, so I'm not really sure what you're on about. This thing is absolutely overpowered in its current state."
customhearthstone,3dcgsk,TheRealLumos,2,Thu Jul 16 07:15:09 2015 UTC,"Forget what I'm saying then. Had a wierd moment there for some reason...  Still, saying it's absolutely overpowered is a bit of an exaggeration. It's got similar impact to al'akir but with less utility and burst potential."
customhearthstone,3d9avf,Cobblestone360,17,Tue Jul 14 14:40:00 2015 UTC,"If I'm not missing the effect, you should just say ""Stealth, Taunt."" In Hearthstone, when a taunt is Stealth, the taunt is disabled. So when it attacks and unstealth, the taunt effect is coming back on itself. No need to write it that way.  Also, yeah, it would probably be ok as a 3/3 for the same reasons ArgonArbiter said."
customhearthstone,3d9avf,BonomDenej,11,Tue Jul 14 17:09:28 2015 UTC,"This would probably be okay as a 3/3 or a 2/4. It wouldn't be a straight upgrade over Ironfur Grizzly because it doesn't give you a taunt the turn you play it, plus, no beast synergy."
customhearthstone,3d9avf,ArgonArbiter,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:16:26 2015 UTC,"I like the idea behind it, but the poor stats don't really compliment the ability very well. A 2/3 taunt is poor just by itself but the fact that it has to also attack out of stealth (potentially damaging itself) makes it harder to play. I could easily see this minion as a Druid-exclusive 4 mana 3/6 to make it more useful and balanced."
customhearthstone,3d9avf,Coolboypai,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:10:29 2015 UTC,"Pretty neat idea. Also I think it should say ""When this minion is revealed, gain Taunt."" Plus update the statline to a 2/4 or so."

customhearthstone,3d9eyp,Manlyarmpits,3,Tue Jul 14 15:11:30 2015 UTC,This card lies somewhere between Nourish and Solemn Vigil and provides card draw and overload synergy. Not sure if the cost should drop and possibly number of cards drawn to make it more viable with cards like lightning storm and fireguard destroyer. I didn't want it to be too powerful.
customhearthstone,3d9eyp,professorx12,3,Tue Jul 14 15:34:37 2015 UTC,I like this because you can always play the card on 5 mana regardless of overload.  Also turn 2 Forked Lightning + Forked Lightning + Coin + Molten Tide = 3 cards drawn.
customhearthstone,3d9eyp,NewLifeRising,2,Tue Jul 14 15:51:49 2015 UTC,"I think scaling down the card would make this excellent.. like making it an arcane intellect with the cost reduction mechanic (3 mana, draw 2 cards with cost reduction). Itd be much easier to cast this with overloaded mana crystals if it were 3 mana as opposed to 5.  But overall I love the idea here!  EDIT: Granted it might be strictly better than Far Sight (which for a second forgot was a card),  so maybe 4 mana would be better. I'm not sure."
customhearthstone,3d9eyp,NewLifeRising,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:36:01 2015 UTC,"Thank you! As I just posted below, the sweet spot for this card is probably 4 mana. Can you justify 3 cards drawn for 4 mana? 2 cards for 4 is too little. As you would have to lock mana for next turn to play it, it might actually not be too OP?   Far Sight might as well not be a card though..."
customhearthstone,3d9eyp,vanasbry000,2,Tue Jul 14 20:49:33 2015 UTC,"No problem! I do agree with your point tho.. 2 is too little, but 3 with a cost reduction mechanic might be too much. I think a fair idea would be to include randomness in it (because Blizzard loves making Shaman random). Make it so it draws 2 to 3 cards with the possible cost reduction. It might not be a great compromise but it may work nonetheless."
customhearthstone,3d9eyp,lynbeaut,2,Tue Jul 14 20:54:00 2015 UTC,"I really like what you've done here. I suppose that my only qualm is that I don't think that it sits on a spot of the curve that can capitalize on it, but this essentially ignores your overload, a fantastic design. It lets them, when facing a big hit on their tempo options on an overloaded turn, play for value at no loss. After all, they likely ramped (through overload) out a cost effective tempo play just the turn before.   The thing that I didn't like about Lava Shock was that if you unlocked one crystal it is a Holy Smite and with two it is a Backstab. If it got better than that then you were either playing out all of your cards or had cleared their important things already. Going Dennis for 2 face damage isn't good there, and your main reason to use it is to improve your next turn. All in all, I'd rather Blizzard hadn't made it into another low damage removal/burn spell, as it detracts from the purpose of the card.  I don't know how this would be used or how the Shaman decks using this would change their lineup. Would they benefit more from a cheap cantrip, pseudo-Intellect, your pseudo-Nourish, or a pseudo-Sprint? I don't really know, and playtesting is needed to find the right one. I will say one thing, though. I think that Shaman would definitely benefit from alternating between tempo plays and value plays."
customhearthstone,3d9l26,VreesKees,4,Tue Jul 14 15:54:52 2015 UTC,So a worse emperor cobra with one extra stat point?

customhearthstone,3d9l26,glaird25,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:32:41 2015 UTC,"True, its a pretty cool card, but the stats should probably be upped as well as cost.  Otherwise it's unplayable.  3-5 for 4 mana?"
customhearthstone,3d9l26,DonZarog,2,Wed Jul 15 04:44:26 2015 UTC,unplayable. The effect is just too slow. If i need to silence somethink i don't want to wait 2 turns and hope that my Minion is able to deal damage to the Target. And you are out of luck if your Opponent hide his silence Target behind a Taunt.
customhearthstone,3d9l26,J-Factor,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:35:23 2015 UTC,"It's nowhere near ""unplayable"". It's a great counter to turn 2 Mad Scientist, it eats Eggs for breakfast so Zoo can't just ignore it, it can hit a Belcher and survive, etc. Your opponent can't play Shredder / Void Caller while this is on the field (unless they don't mind losing 50% of their value).  You don't play this against things you need to silence ASAP. You play it to  destroy your opponent's value over a number of turns or force them to deal with it (possibly inefficiently) ASAP."
customhearthstone,3d9l26,IamChaoz,1 point,Wed Jul 15 08:24:40 2015 UTC,I think it would still be balanced if it was a 2/5. Druid of the Flame has the choice of being a 2/5 or a 5/2 while this gets an ability.

customhearthstone,3d9lta,Coolboypai,1 point,Wed Jul 15 07:07:28 2015 UTC,Well if the minion attacking has more than 4 attack I guess. Ice barrier is nice for the more consistant 8 armor
customhearthstone,3d9lta,arbiterNaL,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:39:39 2015 UTC,"If the freeze happens before the hit, it'd only have to be 2 attack since it'd be frozen until end of the opponent's next turn.

customhearthstone,3d8nzl,kingbdogz,2,Tue Jul 14 10:55:38 2015 UTC,"UPDATE: After some more consideration, I've changed the design of the card to get around the whole ""Immune"" problem. Here it is:  http://www.hearthcards.net/cards/b96ca58d.jpg  Old Post Below:  Hungry Crab has always been one of my favourite ""niche"" cards that also happens to interact with my favourite archetype. Inspired by Madder Bomber, here's my attempt to expand upon that idea and make a ""bigger, badder"" Hungry Crab.  I only recently found out that an ""Immune"" minion is untargetable from spells. Personally, I envision this minion only being immune to damage, but I couldn't think of a way to convey this behaviour in the card text (without making it too long).  Final notes: Shaman because Blizzard seems to want to push Murlocs on them, and it synergizes well with Neptulon. Also notice it doesn't specify friendly Murloc: this could be a cool tech card against other Murloc decks."
customhearthstone,3d8nzl,mylifemyworld17,1 point,Tue Jul 14 11:00:36 2015 UTC,"Should probably say ""Destroy a random murloc"" otherwise it's too good. It could still be too good, even broken. Being permanently immune by just having murlocs on the board is crazy. Plus, this could get out of hand with the buffs murlocs give each other after just one turn. I think something like this would be far better balanced:   5 mana   2/6  Shaman Beast Legendary  At the end of each turn, destroy a random Murloc. If you do, gain +2 attack and 'Can't be targeted by spells or hero poweres"" until the end of the next turn."
customhearthstone,3d8nzl,mylifemyworld17,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:26:19 2015 UTC,"Hey! I appreciate the feedback. Yeah, it's not specified in the text, but it's intended to be a random Murloc (not a specified one).  I actually agree that the idea of an ""Immune"" creature (in the way Heathstone's mechanic works) is way too overpowered. Here is an alternative that I've been brainstorming:  http://www.hearthcards.net/cards/99aa0415.jpg  It's quite hard to get the balance right for this sort of ability. Tell me what you think."
customhearthstone,3d8nzl,mylifemyworld17,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:51:58 2015 UTC,"That's better. It still allows things like Polymorph to remove it, or BGH if it gets big enough. I think its health needs to be buffed though. It's not a big deal, but if there's no murlocs a 4/3 for 5 is really, really bad. Maybe make it a 4/4 or even a 4/5? The health won't matter if the effect procs, and as long as its not standard value I think it's balanced. a 4/5 for 5 with this effect is probably good, although it might be pushing it."

customhearthstone,3d8snr,jdmgto,2,Tue Jul 14 13:32:24 2015 UTC,You would need a minion to buff it up to get the full value. The only cards that are currently used in the meta that can buff it are Houndmasters and Leokk from animal companion.  Seems pretty balanced to me. Maybe a beast deck will surface using Timber Wolves and such.

Even if the aggro meta for hunter is so predominant and strong that doesn't mean we aren't able to explore concepts that could possibly be interesting.  This card requires an enabler to work, albeit the strong 8 damage turn 1 play, which could be similar for the mech mage churning out two mechwarpers and clockwerk gnomes turn 2, even if they don't have charge.  It's a dead card in most cases unless your whole deck has enablers, and with the current arsenal of buff cards the chances of you playing them are pretty low if you are going to bank on this card being strong.  Abusive, Timber, Dark Iron, Dire Wolf Alpha.  Though I have overlooked the timber/direwolf combo but that's still a one of chance to get that exact combination of cards."

It kinda does. While I'm all for trying new things you're crafting a fantastic rush card for the predominant rush class in an overwhelmingly aggressive meta. It's not a card anyone is going to be interested in right now, well anyone except face hunters.   This card requires an enabler to work,   And they are all over the place. Timberwolf, Direwolf Alpha, Abusive Sergeant, Beastial Wrath, Shattered Sun Cleric, and on and on and on. That's not a downside. Most rush decks are already running a few enablers. Requiring an enabler isn't a huge downside. It's certainly not a downside when most Facehunters have few cards in their deck that cost four or more mana.   albeit the strong 8 damage turn 1 play, which could be similar for the mech mage churning out two mechwarpers and clockwerk gnomes turn 2, even if they don't have charge.   It's not. The Flies immediately start to hammer away. If a mage makes that play, which takes the coin, they can't start attacking to clear your flies and buffers until their turn rolls around again. The mage will be on half health when they start turn 3 and can begin to clear them out. This is if the hunter just rushes face. The hunter could also just clear out the mage's minions. He's got lots of dirt cheap minions on the board that he's already gotten huge value out of, trading them up into your 2 and 3 drops? Why not. Also, the mage can't pull combo's like that until you start to get into board clear range of things like Concecrate, Holy Nova, etc. Again, the hunter is doing it from the start of turn one. The Charge is huge, I'd almost say the card wouldn't be so bad if it didn't have it. I still don't think hunters need more cheap beasts but it wouldn't be as utterly broken."
customhearthstone,3d8snr,jdmgto,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:31:46 2015 UTC,"Yes, you need a minion to buff it up to accomplish something. That said this is a zero mana card, so it's entirely possible to play Timberwolf and one or even two of these on your first turn. That's 4 1/1's with charge on turn one. Turn two can be a Direwolf alpha giving you two 1/1's, two 2/1's ready to go and the two wolves to boot. Six minions on the board, turn two and that's without the coin. The only class with a good answer will be mage and how many mages run arcane explosion?  You think this is balanced? Minions that can be played extremely early and who can be easily buffed up quickly get exploited heavily, see Undertaker. At zero mana this allows for some ridiculous turn one plays that will make regaining board control extremely difficult and give the hunter two turns to dump on you before you can even get anything on the board with a chance of sticking. Face hunters are bad now and they can't do much to you on turn one besides set up for turn two. With charge this will solve that problem letting them start smashing face turn one."
customhearthstone,3d8snr,professorx12,2,Tue Jul 14 16:13:17 2015 UTC,"It requires enablers to work, but it also unlike the undertaker requires the enabler to function at ALL. Removing the direwolf or timberwolves will easily nullify this card, which is similar to the single target removal you have in turn 1. Plus to reiterate my reply to your other comment, you're looking at a small percentage of drawing those cards out in turn 1.  Although I agree the zero mana solution was a little iffy because of situations like this, but making it a 1 mana doesn't seem so appealing to play. I dunno, thoughts?  Aside from that, the old undertaker only worked because of the health buff and now is almost completely dead now."
customhearthstone,3d8snr,mylifemyworld17,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:28:49 2015 UTC,"Yes, it requires enablers to really get the value out of it. This is not the first card that really requires other cards to maximize it's potential. Echoing Ooze similarly requires buffs to really reach it's potential. Hobgoblin, Shattered Sun, various class buffs. It's got some utility without them, but not much. Look at the ooze, 1/2 with that battlecry, but it's a 2 cost minion.  That's a valuable effect. Most of your summon another creature cards are pricy because putting another body on the board is valuable. You've knocked 1/1 worth of stats off sure, but that doesn't warrant dropping the cost 2, certainly not when you add in charge. Hell, stonetusk Boar is 1 mana for a 1/1 Charge. You've lost 1 attack but gained a second body and still reduced the mana cost further. Look at Wisp, 1/1 for 0. Yes this is a 0/1 now but giving it both charge and the ability to summon another one is worth way more than one attack. This card is undercosted majorly, and undercosted at a point where it allows ridiculous openings because it's essentially free.  Yes, it would be less appealing at one mana but that's because it's ridiculous as is."
customhearthstone,3d8snr,Xhinope,2,Tue Jul 14 18:18:55 2015 UTC,"The flys are not being buffed by themselves. The buff is coming from a seperate source. Unlike pre-nerf undertaker, the source of the buff can be killed and lessen the effectiveness of the fly. Also what early game minions buff up the attack of other minons? Timber Wolf and Raid Leader never see play and this card would not change that as there are better cards to put in your deck than a sometimes working combo. Dire Wolf Alpha is another option but if Hearthstone rules apply, the summoned minion is summoned to the right of the played minion meaning that only one would get the buff of the Wolf unless the wolf is played first. However with the wolf, you could only get out 3 damage because of how minions are summoned from other minions.  4 1/1's with charge isn't that bad. Mech mage/shaman can pull off way crazier combos. (On turn 2 you can have 2 2/3's 2 1/2's with Taunt and Divine Shield, and 1 2/1 that gives a spare part when it dies.) Druid can get a powerful mid to late game minion out on turn one using innervate.  Also Face hunter would not run this card. It would require cutting 4  cards just to get a combo that sometimes worked.   Additionally all forms of warrior run whirlwind. One of the most popular decks right now is Grim Patron Warrior. Patron uses Cruel Taskmaster, and Inner Rage along side whirlwind.   Furthermore, there are classes that can deal damage to single minions. If they kill the enabler of the flies then the flies are just 0/1's."
customhearthstone,3d8snr,mylifemyworld17,2,Tue Jul 14 20:07:01 2015 UTC,Turn 1 Hunter play:   Timber Wolf + Timber Wolf + Pestering Fly + Pestering Fly.   8 damage from 6 minions on turn 1.

customhearthstone,3d6vky,Ganthor,13,Tue Jul 14 00:03:23 2015 UTC,"This is wayy too good. Its one stat less than vanilla and deatroys all of your oponents armor while buffing itself.

customhearthstone,3d6vky,virulentArachnid,-2,Tue Jul 14 00:13:06 2015 UTC,"And now imagine having it in your deck against a Hunter or a Warlock. It would do literally nothing.

customhearthstone,3d6vky,Coolboypai,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:20:22 2015 UTC,"Here's another way to look at it. People run tech cards like kezan, harrison, black knight, mct and even bgh even if they don't do anything against certain decks. They do this because it increases their  chances against unfavourable match ups and make it an overall better deck. A card like Karsh would destroy for classes like mage, priest and perhaps even rogue or shaman.  I'm just not a fan of how big of an impact this card has and certainly think /u/bluecone has the right idea limiting this minion's power while keeping the flavour"

customhearthstone,3d6vky,Exodus100,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:07:51 2015 UTC,The distribution is what makes it so bad. A 1 drop can trade up with it. The only thing a 6/2 threatens is face damage.
customhearthstone,3d6vky,Bluecone,2,Wed Jul 15 03:30:33 2015 UTC,"I like the idea of the mechanic of anti-armor but I think you have it a little too strong. Maybe it could remove up to 5 armor and gain health equal to the amount of armor destroyed. That way, its a 6/7 for 4 mana against most warriors and some rare freeze mages (while also doing 5 damage immediately to face) and its a 6/2 against all other classes which is removed by most 2 drops.  I personally think another mechanic might work better with destroying armor rather than gaining health. Maybe something like your hero gains the armor? Or if any armor is destroyed deal damage to all enemy characters?"
customhearthstone,3d6vky,Waladin,1 point,Tue Jul 14 06:32:54 2015 UTC,"I wanted to make it similar to Karsh Steelbender in WoW.

customhearthstone,3d6clw,kingbdogz,2,Wed Jul 15 05:55:38 2015 UTC,"I really love this idea!  If I may expand upon this, I feel like Outlay should specify amount as well, like ""Outlay (1):"", allowing for the possibility of higher Outlay costs.  Here are a few cards I made with this idea in mind:  http://imgur.com/a/1IfYi  I propose that the Outlay mechanic becomes optional, similar to ""Choose One"" for Druids, but instead there would only be one option. This wouldn't be the case for spells which only have an Outlay effect, such as Treasure Hunt.  The cool thing about Lost Isle Raider is it is extremely versatile. It can act as a standard 1-drop, but it can also sport the same stats of a 4-drop minion with extra coins. Technically, you could get a 4/5 minion with him on turn 3, but you'd need to dedicate 2 turns to playing ""Booty!""  The idea of a ""Pirate"" class screams weak, but versatile to me. I really think this could be an incredibly interesting mechanic with plenty of depth. What do you think?"
customhearthstone,3d6clw,kingbdogz,1 point,Tue Jul 14 12:53:19 2015 UTC,"I've thought about both: - Going down an ""outlay or no outlay"" route (chosen in a similar fashion to Choose One) - varying Outlay costs (1,2 or 3) I may change it in the future (if I get round to it- I'm making Tinker and Monk now) but the way I chose in the original examples was the simplest way to explain the mechanic. It all depends on ideas and whether I change my mind on it. Which I do a lot."
customhearthstone,3d6clw,Rayvvn,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:11:50 2015 UTC,"Hi there. It is true that your version is the simplest, and I really have no argument against that. However, I tried revising the idea some more and added some more cards.  http://imgur.com/a/ig57W  ""Ranged"" would be a unique mechanic to these Pirate cards, allowing them to attack a minion without receiving damage. Not exactly sure about this one, but I've always enjoyed the idea of this mechanic and it seemed like it might be cool for Pirates to have as an exclusive.  Tell me what you think. I think this has huge potential."
customhearthstone,3d6clw,Kloneros,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:21:46 2015 UTC,One problem I see is the interaction between the normal coin. Does outlay work with a normal coin? That would be strong.

Iskar is too much, in my opinion. If you have a spell and he isn't contested your be able to do 20 damage in a turn. Archmage isn't nearly that good, and the extra mana seems too cheap.   Tuulani has a great effect, but I think your instincts about costing are probably correct.   Sen'jin just doesn't impress me much. That ability hasn't proven particularly valuable in the past and I don't think it has to do with Spellstopper's stats."
customhearthstone,3d7zal,dmrawlings,1 point,Tue Jul 14 06:23:28 2015 UTC,"Good point on Mind Sear, if it could target your own minions you could some weird stuff with Sylvanas or set-up a card draw combo with Northshire Cleric and Circle of Healing. Don't think those would be particularly good but who knows.  You are right about Iskar. I somehow assumed the enemy would just kill Iskar at all costs and that he couldn't survive more than 1 turn. Now that I picture him living a turn, its ridiculous... He still might be salvageable with any of the below combinations:   if his text was ""Whenever you cast a spell, add a 'Mind Blast' or 'Shadow Madness' at random to your hand"" he costed 9 or 10 mana he had 4 health   EDIT: I updated Iskar to v2.0, he still could have 4 health and/or cost 8 mana and still be too powerful even with the randomness."

customhearthstone,3d4y6u,pHaCSGO,4,Mon Jul 13 15:43:44 2015 UTC,"Lightwisp  A smaller Lightspawn, simple yet clever. Not much to say about it.    Lightmen Worker  Holy shit this thing is broken. The concept is nice but it should only trigger on your turn, and probably at the beginning of it. To balance it out, make it a 2/3 maybe.    Valen's Defender  Probably too good but maybe not, hard to tell, nice concept but a passive health gain is funky in this game. For instance, you get a minion with the buff to go at 1 Health. When the Valen's Defender is killed, the minion at 1 Health doesn't die and stay at 1 Health.    Valen  I like it, a passive Inner Fire for all your minions. You could see fun decks around this with all the low atk minion and high health. Well balanced for me.    Meditate  A better Blessing of Wisdom. The wording should be ""Choose a minion. Give it ""At the end of each turn gain +1"" and whenever it attacks, draw a card.     Healths Justice  Hmm, should probably cost 2 Mana because right now it does the same healing a Holy Nova does for the same price but without the damage... Also, the wording should be ""Your Hero Power becomes 'Restore 2 Health to all friendly characters' this turn"".    Violence  The fact that it cost less for each minion that died doesn't make sense on something that supposed to make your minions more resilient I think. Outside of that, the concept is fine. Also, no need to write ""all your minions"", just ""your minions"" is enough, and Health needs a capital letter. Just nitpicking ""grammar"" here. Also, the name of the card is weird for the effect!    Embrace the shadows  Pretty cool, should be ""Summon three 1/1 Shadows. Draw a card."" though.

customhearthstone,3d4y6u,Terraplant,1 point,Tue Jul 14 08:39:01 2015 UTC,"I agree with the bit about Valen's Defender. At 2 mana this card is too good for the early game. It is quite similar to pre-nerf Blood Imp, and while this card does not have stealth, the effect is way to powerful for 2 mana. Making this a 4 mana card and buffing the stats could make this good in a form of aggro priest without being broken. If the priest can dump his/her hand and plays this without having his/her board cleared before this comes out, the priest is in a good spot. Not broken good, but still good. 5 mana could work as well and may be better because it allows consecration/helfire/deadly poison + bladflurry/lightning storm to be played before this card is played. +2 health would take most minions out of board removal. Exceptions being Flamestrike (maybe), Lightbomb (maybe) and Twisting Nether. Twisting Nether is not played at all and the effect may actually take you minions out of Flamestrike and Lightbomb range. You could maybe add ""Deathrattle: reduce all you minions' health by 1"" to balance this out.  Idk. It is a strong card in aggro priest as it take you minions out of most forms of board removal. It is really difficult to keep the nature of the effect an make it balanced at the same time.  (Also I suggest as well to make Lightmen Worker to only trigger at the end/start of you turn. Probably the start. Additionally, I think the name could be ""Lightman Worker."" I don't know the origin behind the name so I could be wrong (and I apologize if I am), but ""Lightmen"" just sound weird.    Edit: You could make Valen's Defender's current effect a battlecry. I think that would sort out most of the issues nicely while still keeping the stats and mana cost the same."

You worded it to work on your opponent's turn as well, so it snowballs your board SO fast. Even if it only affected itself and started a 2/2, it would still be a strong card.  Meditate is the same effect, for 2 mana, on one minion. This is probably a little weak, but do you see the balance difference there?  Embrace the shadows is pretty darn weak as well, there's no ""Muster"" synergy with priest, and giving 1 attack minions health with your other cards isn't very useful since they can't trade well regardless. Considering priests have minions like Dark Cultist, their 3 drop slot is already pretty competitive."

I feel the creeper is too expensive and i do think that the creeper's explosion is big enough to hurt both players. (what if creeper was a 3 mana 2/2 with deathrattle: deal 3 damage to all characters.) 2. I think that the Big Slime is way to expensive for what it does; especially sense it is a deathrattle and not a battlecry... deathrattle is an investment in hoping that nothing will happen to your minion ""silence""; a good example of this is loot hoarder to novice engineer. (what if Big slime was reduced to 5 mana or 4 mana with a debuff). 3. i think the mine hero power should let you draw a random ""block card"" which would be similar to a spare part in value... or maybe the rng of drawing a good block card would be small like a diamond block.

Granted, that involves two preps and both S&D, but even if you replace one S&D with something like Eviscerate you are still looking at over 20 damage purely from spells, no taunts or anything will block that.

Enrage applies an effect while you have less than full health. ""whenever this minion takes damage"", such as in acolyte of pain and gurubashi berezerker applies an effect when the damage is dealt. So if you have a mad bomber throw 3 bombs at an acolyte, you draw three cards. If a bomber throws 3 bombs at Bloodsucker, it has a 50% change to change sides 3 separate times, not once."

It's probably safe to give it one more Health. Lightmen Worker I think this might be really overpowered. It's a 2/4 for 2, which, on its own is really good. Past that, giving all your minions +1 health at the end of every turn may be excessive. I'm not exactly sure how to rebalance it. Maybe make it give health at the end of your turn? I'm not sure. Valen I kinda like this card. From what I can tell, you're going with a Health theme, which fits priest. For this card, it's an 8/8 for 7, which is fine (save for setting itself to be BGH'd), otherwise, it's a cool card. Valen's Defender 1/6 for 3 is an odd statline to say the least. It comes out early enough to secure early board control, but 1/6 is such an odd statline. It'd have to be tested to see how good it is. Meditate It's a worse PW:S that has the chance to get bigger, but is honestly too slow to be viable. Especially at the epic slot. It may be good early, but it's nearly a dead card in the late game. PW:S is good because it also draws a card, thus giving it late game use. With the theme of the cards you have, it could actually work, and spiral out of control if left unchecked. I'm not honestly sure how I feel about this one. Violence I'm not getting the flavor here, but it looks like it could be a pretty decent anti-boardwipe card. I kinda like it, and it could actually be pretty good. Embrace the Shadows So... a worse Muster? Even though it's a straight downgrade, it could still be useful with all the +Health effects in the set. It can be used to make Violence really cheap, but ultimately, We'd just have to see. Muster is an auto-include, but I highly doubt this would be.      Honestly, I really like all of these cards, and they can all fill some niche in an obscure priest zoo deck. Pretty neat stuff."

customhearthstone,3d0av1,hoorahforsnakes,0,Sun Jul 12 20:58:13 2015 UTC,Fair point.
customhearthstone,3d0av1,h2g2Ben,6,Sun Jul 12 20:11:17 2015 UTC,"That Pufferfish is definedly consept-wise my favourite from these and something I would like to see in game in some form.  Zandalari is a bit too strong with all the AoE so it could possibly be 5 mana card with 3/6 or 4/5.  I hate these ideas for weapon where you equip it and then get some bonus if you don't use it for the rest of the game. That's not how it should work! It would already be much better if the Mandokir's String would be: 2/4, Whenever you kill a minion with this weapon increase your hero power damage by 1.  I like Bloodsail idea, but it should only reduce 2-mana.  Crow Nest is propably the most balanced out of these and a good alternative in non-beast decks that can't use Buzzard."
customhearthstone,3d0av1,Tensaipengin,2,Sun Jul 12 14:45:48 2015 UTC,"With regards to the weapon it's a trade off.   You in turn are losing the ability to have a weapon equipped in return for this effect.  It's interesting and different and deviates from standard weapon play, it's a great idea in my opinion."
customhearthstone,3d0av1,Archaellon,0,Mon Jul 13 06:43:30 2015 UTC,"You would lose nothing, cause you would not add other weapons in your deck anyway.  It's not interesting design at all since it offers no choices ingame, you just equip it and blam, you get buffs till the end of times unless enemy has weapon wrecker. Considering how rare those are, it might as well be a spell."
customhearthstone,3d0av1,Tensaipengin,2,Mon Jul 13 12:11:50 2015 UTC,"Weapons are core to almost all hunter decks.   Control, Face, Hybrid (ugh) all run weapons and I've seen most iterations of modern day beast running them, so by using the strategy of not using weapons to not waste cards when running MS (the wep in question), you're losing out on lots of potential power your deck could have have, thus making the deck inherently weaker in return.  It's a trade off, and that makes it interesting."
customhearthstone,3d0av1,Archaellon,1 point,Mon Jul 13 12:52:52 2015 UTC,"Who says weapon destroyers are rare? Almost all priests have AcidSO, Druid runs harrison 90% of the time, as does CW, and mid paladin. Some handlocks have him as well, and even some midrange hunters. Only classes I can think of that really never run weapon removal are rogue, mage, and shaman, (which is seeing barely any play right now besides mech and sometimes midrange) and even then he can see play with those classes, as he is just a great card."
customhearthstone,3d0av1,Exodus100,3,Tue Jul 14 21:20:42 2015 UTC,"I think Bloodsail is too good alongside everyone's favorite 3 mana bow (I probably would just run that and not the epic bows, to guaranteed a 0 mana weapon).  It doesn't encourage the large weapons enough I think."
customhearthstone,3d0av1,Mirrorminx,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:20:21 2015 UTC,"You could use it to whip out your eaglehorn, but does that really but the pressure on enough as you're entering the late game? You could run that, but I think any deck that tried to would be better off with highmanes."
customhearthstone,3d0av1,Mirrorminx,3,Sun Jul 12 21:03:51 2015 UTC,"What's stopping you running both?  I think you forget that midrange (non-control) hunter is still very much a viable deck. And I can near guarantee this card would be used to pull eaglehorn if it were released.  Eaglehorn is such a vital part of midrange traphunter that this adds some great midgame reliability. And it is SO strong, 6 for a 4/6 with a 3/2 weapon for free is pretty crazy."
customhearthstone,3d0av1,GrumpySatan,2,Sun Jul 12 21:18:58 2015 UTC,"I really like all of these, especially pufferfish.  But I think that Mandokir's Sting should probably be a spell instead of a weapon. Maybe reduce its mana-cost to 4. I get the idea behind it, but I think that it would just be another tool for face hunter that combos too well with UTH rather than make hunter more control-like. It would probably make aggro decks too strong or fast moving."
customhearthstone,3d0av1,vanasbry000,1 point,Sun Jul 12 15:00:51 2015 UTC,It rewarded the killing of enemy minions on your turn not ALL minions. I do agree though that in order to make it feel like an actual weapon it would need to actually have non-negligible stats.
customhearthstone,3d0av1,AstroZombie29,2,Sun Jul 12 20:53:38 2015 UTC,What happens to the Pufferfish if it end the enemy turn with 2 health left ?
customhearthstone,3d0av1,Flower_Fairy,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:41:00 2015 UTC,"It would work the same way as if it was a buff from stormwind champion or similar. In hearthstone stat modifiers effectively heal the minion for the amount as well as increasing the cap, if the buff is lost the minion only loses health if it had more health than the new cap. So it would be 2/2 still, then go back up to again 5/5 at the end of the turn.  To avoid that it would have to be worded ""gains +3/+3 at the start of your opponent's turn and -3/-3 at the start of your turn"". There aren't negative stat modifiers in hearthstone yet though afaik, we only have things that work as ""set to x""."
customhearthstone,3d0av1,vanasbry000,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:54:46 2015 UTC,The red two health would become a white two health when your turn comes around and then would become a green five health at the start of the opponent's turn.

customhearthstone,3d0zv0,HSmallGunz,6,Sun Jul 12 16:52:53 2015 UTC,"I would say in general, your cards are on the edge of too strong, and many of them aren't interesting from a design standpoint.  Ooo, a 7 drop that does face damage and has good stats (Manticoro). Kinda boring.  Other cards, like Master Shapeshifter, just aren't very fun. Silence all enemy minions as a choose one effect is not fun for your opponent, and against Blizzard design philosophy, mass dispel is insanely expensive for the same effect, whereas here you're costing it at 1/2 a mana?  Then there's just stuff that's silly. 5 for a 5/5 ignores taunt? Why do we need something like this in a class that already lacks strategic diversity?  Not trying to be mean, but it seems like you went for quantity over quality. There are definitely a few interesting card concepts (orc explorer) but for the most part, the cards are just not very well thought out.  In the future, try and think carefully about each card's impact on the game, compare it to similar effects, and try to add interesting deckbuilding decisions whenever you make a card."
customhearthstone,3d0zv0,Mirrorminx,2,Sun Jul 12 18:58:07 2015 UTC,"Well i am sad that my cards haven't impressed you very much, though i feel like i must add that i have made all these cards over the last couple of months, this is not quantity work if you ask me. I've done my best to think all of these through and i would dare to say that i could argue for every single card being balanced.

customhearthstone,3d0zv0,Audiencefone,1 point,Sun Jul 12 22:12:12 2015 UTC,"As much as I appreciate the large sets, and would like to give feedback on them all, I simply don't want to spend that kind of time. In an effort to compromise, I'm going to stop at random cards that catch my eye and let you know what I think of them.  Master Shapeshifter: the silence seems...potentially...okay. The deathrattle...two 3/1s seems REALLY overpowered on a 6/9. It can't even be killed by BGH and by the time you FINALLY take out that 9 HP, you have to deal with two new deadly threats. Any AOE will do it, but by the time they come out, you may have used your whole hand/mana.  Ladon: Nope. Neat idea, but this will only encourage poor deckbuilding so that your opponent gets the bad deck and yo spend the rest of your time looking for this legendary. Doesn't seem fun at all.  Spellbending Harpy: The effect doesn't warrant more stats, since it applies to both players.   Brood Mother: Way OP. With that effect, like Scavenging Hyena, it can grow massive. Turn nine, Brood Mother, Unleash the Hounds. This needs less stats.  Kel'Thas/Phoenix/Phoenix Egg: OP. Silence destroys this but without it you're guaranteed a 7/6 at the start of every turn, and it will never die entirely.  Elite Arcanist: Neat way of applying this effect basically for free. Lots of risk/reward here.  Orc Explorer: Another OP card. It's a 3/2 when your opponent's turn starts. Unless they have an answer for it right then, it's a 3/4 the next time they have a chance to deal with it. If you didn't cast any draw spells, etc. This thing costs too little and grows too fast.  Storm, Earth, and Fire: lol, so OP.  Alexandros Mograine: I like the effects, but the stats are a bit high.  Breaker of Dawn: Perfect. Well done on this one.  Right Hand of Naaru: I don't care that the targets are random. That's a 7/8 for 8 that casts two 5-mana spells when you play it. No matter what it hits, you deal 10 damage and heal 10 AND have the body. This is insane and while I appreciate the unique ability, it's massively OP.  Condemner of Light: REALLY neat effect. It's rather over-priced, however.  Skeleton Bountyhunter: Not sure if this fits the Rogue flavor, but it's a neat card.  Skull Breaker: This CANNOT have more than 2 durability. All you have to do is wait a while and throw on some sharpsword oil/poisons, then attack/bladeflurry and you insta-kill any player without ice block.  Stormcaller: Not sure if it's balanced, but it's a neat card for sure.  Ancestral Healer: too much healing and stats for 5 mana.  Dread Knight: This needs a few less attack/health. Either -0/-2 or -1/-1 I think. The mechanic is just so good, and warlocks already have constant drawing capability.  Mostrosity: I like it. It fits warlock.  Mighty Minotaur: Imagine this with Gorehowl. Arcanite Reaper. Death's Bite. Even with Fiery War Axe it's OP. Too OP.  Armored Bronze Drake: Durability is a powerful thing. I'd make this cost 1-2 more or reduce the stats."
customhearthstone,3d0zv0,vanasbry000,1 point,Mon Jul 13 01:10:09 2015 UTC,"Just skimming, I think that you were very astute. However, at least two cards you misinterpreted (and that's okay, there were eighty of them). Brood Mother doesn't gain stats on beast summons, it buffs any beast played from hand. Right Hand of Naaru (who had terrible text, for goodness' sake, minions can never cast spells) deals two damage to two random enemies, as it states holy smite instead of holy fire."
customhearthstone,3d0zv0,Audiencefone,1 point,Mon Jul 13 05:56:54 2015 UTC,"Oops.  Thanks for pointing that out.  Well, despite this, I still feel these cards are overpowered (and the priest one in question also much less interesting...)."
customhearthstone,3d0zv0,Audiencefone,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:49:23 2015 UTC,"If you compare Master Shapeshifters deathrattle effect to forexample Savannah Highmane, he is no where near OP.. He cost 2 more and only has 4 health more in total. Spellbending Harpy has 7 stats in total which is what most 3 drops have, no more or less stats on her.  Brood Mother does not affect Unleash since you need to play, and not summon. Kel'Thas only summons a Phoenix, not the Egg. (if you didn't know) Storm, Earth and Fire can only be gained from Chen (if you didn't know) Hand of Naruu has poor text (my bad) it holy smites 2 random enemies. All the other things i will look into, thanks for the feedback! :)"
customhearthstone,3d0zv0,lynbeaut,1 point,Mon Jul 13 11:15:56 2015 UTC,"I'm still not crazy about Master Shapeshifter, but I see your point.  As for the Harpy, I guess I just forgot how to do math for a minute.  Brood Mother is still a bit crazy in my mind, but that tones it down for sure. I guess I misinterpreted it.  Kel'Thas summons the phoenix, yes, but the pheonis summons the egg. Without silence (let's say you already used it, or don't have any) how do you deal with a never-ending 7/6? You could BGH, but then it comes back a bit later. Fireball? It comes back. You need to build in a way so that this only happens once.  Storm Earth and Fire is still OP in my mind. I honestly think the cost needs to be 5, even with the barrier of playing Chen first.  Hand of the Naaru...okay...I just wish it was more interesting. It's a big minion that deals damage when it dies. Why would I want that in a priest deck? That doesn't even sound like a priest minion.  Admittedly, I messed up on reading a few of these (a side effect of quickly looking through them), but I hold to most of what I said originally."
customhearthstone,3d0zv0,h2g2Ben,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:58:19 2015 UTC,"I do like big lists of cards. Cuz I absolutely love looking at other people's ideas. But when big lists arise, there are, certain issues (and I know, since I'm still working on my own fanexpansion :P). As others have stated (or pointed out these issues). A lot of these cards are wayyyy too strong for their stats and mana costs. Half of these cards have like 2 to 3 strong effects, and yet their stats are representative of minions without effects, or even in some cases just straight up stronger. Then theres the minions with effects that won't be in the game. Like the Druid that silences all enemy minions, with a normal sized body... Meh. The 5/5 that ignores Taunt. Uh, why? Theres the gnome in mage, that is a 2/5 that gives both players spell damage. Uh. Is this a better, or worse Dalaran Mage? (A card that isnt played). Meaning this 2/5 minion wouldn't be played either. That phoenix legendary is basically broken. Ridiculously strong. Chen Stormstout... What? Hes so super broken. Yes his other stuff takes more than a turn to come out, but that single card gives you like around 10 mana worth of stuff. For 5 mana. Another example of stats on minions that are undeserved because of their ability. There definitely are some cool ones here though. Orc Explorer is actually quite brilliant. And I do like Holy Inquisitor (though by turn 7 its ability is basically pointless), cool though. Condemner of Light is especially interesting for Priest. I love that card. Dont know how strong it really is, but yeah. Not trying to be a downer here at all, but a lot of these cards need to be reworked/re-looked at. Their abilities, stats, and mana costs could use some tweaking. Some of the high-cost minions could even have their abilities slightly weakened, and their mana costs dropped to more playable levels. Most minions above 6 just are nearly impossible to play. Minions become more interesting if they're playable. Not if they have broken abilities at 8-9 mana."
customhearthstone,3d0zv0,sonpansatan,1 point,Mon Jul 13 01:39:08 2015 UTC,"I've got some insomnia, so let's see how far we can get.   Druid of the Thorn - There is already a 6 cost stealth that's a 7-5 and a 5 cost that's a 5-5. And stealth isn't really a Druid dynamic.  Druid of the Emerald - You're missing a semi-colon before, ""or."" A 6/5 for 5 isn't that exciting, nor is adding a spell to my hand in a class with tons of draw anyway. Also, I don't think the transformed cards don't typically get ability text. Not sure why did you that. Master Shapeshifter: Seems like it should cost a little more for essentially having a three cost spell attacked to the minion. Should be a semi-colon, not a colon before the ""or."" Summoning two two-mana beasts also seems OP for the mana cost. Also, it's a legendary, so it should be a named creature in the lore, not a generic name. Something like Alex the Shapeshifter. Centaur .... okay. It competes with Swipe and Keeper in the 4-slot. I have some trouble seeing this being in a deck.  Ladon - this is absurd. It falls into the class of cards that blizzard would never release. They do not like you messing with your opponent's deck or hand. Also, why would I want to play this card?  Manticoro - this may as well be a 7-cost slightly nerfed mind blast. It dies to BGH, Fireball, and doesn't really trade that favorably. Also, really? Giving hunter's more face damage? War Elephant - Elephant should be capitalized, as should ""give."" Adding health is more of a priest mechanic, and I don't get the flavor. Why is an elephant increasing the health of a friendly beast? Spellbinding Harpy: Druids have a 5/2 for 3 without a huge downside. This dies to . . . nearly any two drop.  Reptile Warrior: Ignores should be lowercase. It needs a period. Great. More Face. Brood Mother: Strike minion, it's redundant to ""beast"". Almost seems over-costed.  Wirling Dragon - Immune while attacking has gotta be worth more than half a point of attack.  Kael-Thas - This card is very OP. A 9 with the stats of a 5 or 6 that summons something that should probably be a 7 cost minion with the ability to resummon itself. Mana Repulser - It's got a good stat-line but it's more likely to hurt the mage than anything else. And the stat-line isn't good enough to counteract the downside. Forst Wyvern - Again, seems OP for a good (albeit BGH-able) stat line to give a guaranteed 2 damage AOE with simple combos. Not to mention the absurdity of Blizzard Frost Wyvern with a Thaurissan. Elite Arcanist - cool dynamic. But again, there exist 2-5s in the game without crazy downsides.  Amani Assassin - Good upside on a good stat-line. Not that it will do meaningful damage to a minion in the late-game. Orc Explorer - Each time a player draws a card, gain +1 Health. OK. So it's a 2 cost 3-2.  Murdain Bronzebeard - low stats for a legendary. Plus, no immediate effect on the board. Tauren Mauler - Seems like a very good upside for a decent, albeit squishy stat line. Though the usefulness would be incredibly situational.    ......  jiminy. 81 cards is too many to ask for feedback."
customhearthstone,3d0zv0,xtogwe,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:52:31 2015 UTC,"First of all, if you feel like 81 cards is too many to ask for feedback, then just don't and scroll on :) some people don't mind. 1. Stealth could be a Druid dynamic, i don't see why you could't add that since druids could actually go stealth in the real game. 2. Thanks, ill look into the semi-colon thing, and personally i like the diversity, plus the +1/+1 turns it into a dragon aswell (might have some synergy) 3. ill look into it :) 4. Some of the cards are meant for experimenting, not all should compete, some would also fit into Arena, u know? 5. I am sorry you didn't like this card, i was just toying with some things x) 6. The thing costs 7, so even if it goes face it is pushing the Hunter in a more late-game'ish meta which i personally like, but i could change it, thanks for the feedback. 7. This is true, i will look into changing it. 8. The harpy is not a downside, you're not looking at this the right way. This can be an upside just aswell as a downside. Maybe you play it with an empty board, and your opponent can't clear it with a spell because it costs 1 more. 9. I don't know what to say.. You obviously have some agenda with my Hunter cards, i see no clear arguement why i should change it, this is just your personal stuff. 10. Actually surprised you thought this seems overcost, all my friends thought it was wayy too strong :) 11. This is true, thanks. Maybe it should be a 6/6, what do you suggest? 12. I will look into balancing it. 13. This is meant to have a small downside because 5/6 is a higher stat than the average 5 drop, this gets rid of belchers and other stuff and at the same time has 6 health. 14. This does seem very strong indeed, maybe i should nerf it a little, maybe 1 damage to all frozen characters? 15. There are no 2-5's that cost 3 mana tho, so i thought this was a small upside, to a card without a real downside, because this benefits you just as much. 16. Thanks, i was afraid this was too strong. 17. This has the potential to grow alot stronger. 18. He is a 4/9 with taunt if he is enraged, this is quite strong actually if you compare him to other taunts. 19. Very situational indeed, just like Blood Knight forexample :)"

What about something more auchenai-like (inverted):  Can attack friendly minions. When attacking a friendly minion, damage dealt restores health instead.  This means you can heal a creature and yourself, so attacking your Ragnaros heals him by 3 and heals you by 8. In general, it means you mostly don't want to use this card on enemy minions, since you get way more value out of it by using it on your own and trying to maintain board control in that fashion.  An even better version probably needs to lose 1 attack and gain 1 durability. At 2 attack, it's basically a much better version of priest's hero power, and since you don't need to use mana in the next turns to cast it, it gives a gigantic tempo swing to priests (without removing the option of using your hero power)."

customhearthstone,3czpan,jxf,7,Sun Jul 12 06:47:18 2015 UTC,"This is basically a weaker form of a spell that reads: ""Give a friendly Totem +3/+2"", which doesn't seem very strong; especially without the charge that buff abilities inherently have. There are some plus sides, though: 1) It allows you to have multiple copies of the same Heropower Totem on the board, 2) It gives meaningful stats to otherwise unplayable Totems like Vitality and 3) It allows, if changed to jxf's wording (Health and Attack should be the other way around, though), you to maintain temporary effects like Flametongue or Rockbiter. It also has some weak, but noteworthy synergy with Ancestral Spirit.    I think this card can be a 3/3 because this card doesn't add value; it just rearranges it."

They're essentially just adding minions to your deck, for the cost of one card. You don't even have to have those minions in your deck. So you basically get free voidcallers, free mistress of pains, free voidwalkers, and free succubuses. Not to mention the ridiculous buffs to those ""Free"" minions."
customhearthstone,3d05fu,lynbeaut,3,Sun Jul 12 11:09:17 2015 UTC,"But would you consider Thoughtsteal OP? That adds two ""free"" cards to your hand for the cost of one? Is adding a 1/4 and a 1/3 to your hand on turn three really that strong? Succubus is considered a trash tier card - this would allow it to see some play..  These are six ideas for the card that I posted to be expanded upon.   What you need to understand is that instead of playing minions on turn three you do ""nothing"" - which means these cards aren't ""free"", because you pay for them twice AND have to summon them on a turn that isn't fully on curve."

customhearthstone,3cwssi,koregtoja,7,Sat Jul 11 15:14:51 2015 UTC,"I don't see it outside of gimmick-based and Antonidas-Spare Part decks from rank 17 to 6. Above rank 10, you barely see it at all.   If the good/frequent players don't play it, what's the point of nerfing it?  It would be silly to balance around ranks 18 to 20."
customhearthstone,3cwssi,Furbush,0,Sat Jul 11 15:20:34 2015 UTC,It's used by aggro decks to climb ladder quickly. The problem comes when they can just coin out mechwarper->mechwarper->clockwork->clockwork or something similar. There's a reason summoning portal doesn't reduce mana cost to 0; what I described is the reason. The 2 mana for 2/2 is because the powerful ability that it has.
customhearthstone,3cwssi,Ellikichi,7,Sat Jul 11 15:26:29 2015 UTC,"I haven't seen a mech deck for like a months now. But I've seen rank 19 players playing Frost Elemental, pls nerf it!

customhearthstone,3cwssi,whereisqueenmukla,5,Sat Jul 11 16:54:26 2015 UTC,there's no reason to nurf it much less double nurf. Mechwarper is the only reason mech is playable but it's not even competitive right now. only 2 classes that even use mech are mage and shamans and that's because of Blastmage and Powermace. there's stronger decks you can play for shaman and mage other than mech  if you balance cards for anything other than high level play then youre going to break the game. just because you dont like mechs doesnt make them OP
customhearthstone,3cwssi,julius1768,3,Sat Jul 11 16:54:44 2015 UTC,"If they coin out their entire hand in one turn, it's not always the end of the match.  As long as you've got some AOE or decent taunts in your deck and can play some decent threats on-curve you can overcome it.  I frequently win the match against Mech Mages who have an explosive start, just because if you get past that one advantage they're totally out of steam."
customhearthstone,3cwssi,ME24saken,2,Sat Jul 11 17:22:54 2015 UTC,I don't think it really matters that it's a powerful ability when the card is made crap and dies to everything.
customhearthstone,3cwssi,feartrich,2,Sun Jul 12 08:43:21 2015 UTC,"Then there's a reason it's being used a lot at low ranks. Don't get me wrong, mechwarper is a good card, but it's not a problem. Plus the argument that everyone is using it at lower ranks means nothing. Everyone uses voodoo doctor and goldshire footman at rank 20, doesn't mean it's broken"
customhearthstone,3cwssi,ME24saken,1 point,Sat Jul 11 21:33:30 2015 UTC,"That's nonsense. Sleeper OP cards can significantly reduce design space. New cards will be added to the game and you don't want to limit yourself because you have to work around obscure, but strong cards. Also, the meta changes; you could wait to nerf OP cards, but you can also prevent potential unfun situations."
customhearthstone,3cwssi,feartrich,1 point,Mon Jul 13 01:36:26 2015 UTC,"By this argument, Murloc Warleader and Ship's Cannon should also be nerfed. If there were better Murlocs, and there were more Pirates, those cards would have extremely high value. Streamers have shown that Ship's Cannon in particular is a card, that if viable, would be extremely problematic. But I don't think anyone believe it's worth nerfing now.  Blizzard has already shown (and said) that they prefer to be reactive when it comes to nerfs. And I think they are right. It would be un-fun to nerf stuff that people only play for shits and giggles."
customhearthstone,3cwssi,ME24saken,1 point,Mon Jul 13 01:38:55 2015 UTC,"Blizzard's stance on nerfs is that they first try to introduce counters and if they don't work, only then nerf, but they have nerfed pre-emptively in the past. Eaglehorn Bow got a nerf right before Naxx to allow secrets to be played more freely and Gadgetzan was nerfed right before GvG to prevent it from being OP with Spare Parts. They've also stated that an important reason to nerf Buzzard was because they felt they couldn't introduce new beasts in the future.    I don't think Warleader and Cannon are fair comparisons. They do have a high powerlevel, but by the nature of their tribal, they are much more cheese oriented. Mech makes up for a much larger chunk of the cardbase and Warper thus has a bigger impact. Maybe this is a personal opinion, but I find Mechwarper to be stronger than both of them anyhow.    A better example that supports this argument is Battlerage. It has always been an OP card, but it didn't fit in any decks. Blizzard left it as it is and now it's a huge enabler for Patron Warrior, a deck that I find to have less interaction than Miracle Rogue."
customhearthstone,3cwssi,dunk_hs,1 point,Mon Jul 13 11:19:48 2015 UTC,"Let's say there were 5 more Pirates in the game, which there will be assuming the game has a long enough lifespan, and the new cards are somewhat viable. Ship's Cannon would be extremely OP.  Should we nerf Ship's Cannon now in anticipation of that?"
customhearthstone,3cwssi,lynbeaut,1 point,Mon Jul 13 13:25:34 2015 UTC,"Well, again, Cannon is not as strong as Mechwarper, so it doesn't limit the design space for Pirates as much. I also never said that we should nerf cards now, I said you shouldn't not-nerf cards just because they aren't in the meta at the moment.    It really depends on Blizz' future plans. If they aren't adding new Pirates - or if they are, but they'd be on the level of Salty Dog -, there isn't any reason to stop someone from enjoying their cheese deck. They'd nerf them when they expect that a recent change would bring them in the spotlight. However, you do have to expect such changes, i.e: Secret Hunter used to be an obscure cheese deck, but Blizz correctly predicted that Naxx would make secrets much stronger and Eaglehorn got a nerf. However, Blizz didn't expect the strength of Battlerage and now Patron is over the top. A pre-emptive (slight) nerf to that card would have made the game much healthier."
customhearthstone,3cwssi,norgamka,3,Mon Jul 13 13:50:22 2015 UTC,"Sounds like you got pounded by a rare dream mechwarpers opener and came here to rant about it. Just get over it, mechwarper is not op."

This is what it should've been from the beginning. 2/3s Are so potent that their effect can't be so game-changing like Mechwarper's is."
customhearthstone,3cwssi,Dagan42,2,Sat Jul 11 22:21:46 2015 UTC,"The card is already balanced; you don't see mechs dominating the meta (and besides this card is a stable, its what allows mech decks to work)"

customhearthstone,3cxkm0,xhephyr,6,Sat Jul 11 17:57:17 2015 UTC,Sooo an immune 1 drop? Waaaaaay too strong. You're not going to have an early game AoE.
customhearthstone,3cxkm0,JustXYZ13,2,Sat Jul 11 18:28:10 2015 UTC,"Oooh I got an idea to fix this a bit. ""Stealth. Can't Attack. Whenever Murky dies, resummon him and deal 1 damage to this minion."""
customhearthstone,3cxkm0,Vilis16,8,Sat Jul 11 19:10:25 2015 UTC,That's still 3 2/1 minions for 1 mana.
customhearthstone,3cxkm0,Zesty_S,5,Sat Jul 11 19:23:00 2015 UTC,This + Warsong would equal a full board clear for 4 mana... That could lead to balance issues.
customhearthstone,3cxkm0,lynbeaut,2,Sat Jul 11 22:10:30 2015 UTC,"Way too strong considering how murloc decks work. If murloc decks werent the way they were, I could see this being okay. But murlocs are all about quick, zooy, rushing. A minion that respawns itself, over and over on the murloc side, that also has murloc tribe and synergy? Just a bitttt too strong. He would even be strong as a 1/1. I think there is something here, but the stats, and mana cost needs to be reworked i think."
customhearthstone,3cxkm0,hoorahforsnakes,2,Sun Jul 12 00:12:06 2015 UTC,"Personally i think the best way to do murky is to have him deathrattle summon murky's egg, with the egg being a 0/4 without stealth that reads at the end of the turn, destroy this minion and summon murky"
customhearthstone,3cxkm0,ManyCookies,3,Sun Jul 12 00:17:28 2015 UTC,"It's not horrendously broken, but it is a little strong Ok it is with Warsong. But degenerate cases aside, what I dislike is that killing Murky himself does absolutely nothing, since he'll be un-summoning sick by the time of his next attack. Even in HotS, killing Murky at least delayed him for a bit.  What you could do is ""charge gate"" Murky with the phrasing ""Whenever Murky dies, resummon him at the start of your next turn"". With that egg phrasing, a death would make Murky lose his next attack and would therefore become an actual setback (though not as much as death normally is!). The one damage hero powers would now actually do something to him, and he'd lose some of his free attacks in the early game (once every other turn instead of once every turn).  Alternatively, you can move the card as is to 3 mana (and maybe make Murky a 2/2 to compensate)."
customhearthstone,3cxkm0,OwariNeko,1 point,Sat Jul 11 19:46:22 2015 UTC,"The card text for Murky could be ""At the start of your turn, summon Murky's egg if it's dead."""
customhearthstone,3cxkm0,augustofretes,1 point,Sun Jul 12 03:05:46 2015 UTC,"Why do you think the egg needs stealth? If you go first, and play this turn 1, your opponent is very unlikely to kill both the egg and Murky.   So what is your opponent supposed to do?    Every 1 drop not named zombie chow dies to him for free. Mr. chow may trade equally with murky, since he'd take 2 damage, waste next turn killing the egg and then may kill murky. If murky was played by a class with a hero power, then Murky kills chow for free too.  If he coins out a 2 drop, if it's a 3/2, it dies to murky for free. If it's a 2/3 it dies for free to murky + ping. If he passes, then you play your own 2 drop. If he doesn't use the coin, the same situation described above happens. If he coins out a 3 drop, the best 3 drops in the game will die to murky + 2 drop, and murky will remain. You then play your own 3 drop.   What if he has removal? Wait. What removal exactly? Pings are useless against him, you need 3 pings to kill him. The only class that can kill it turn 1 is rogue with backstab, coin, hero power.   This card is strong enough without the egg having stealth. It's definitively a insane legendary minion. Warsong + Murky is an easy fix, you just the adjust the text a bit. The hard part is making sure it doesn't absolutely obliterate any early game your opponent has for 1 mana (especially in classes with a ping), with stealth it's just absurd how strong this card is."

You're relying on random chance to give you something good (preferably a 9-mana to be played next turn) instead of just... putting a legendary in your deck? Sure, you could also get a different class's legendary, but is that 11-mana King Krush worth it?

customhearthstone,3ctvk1,lynbeaut,24,Fri Jul 10 19:22:02 2015 UTC,This card far from makes Corruption pointless. It actually encourages using it since it can turn into a 1 mana Assassinate.
customhearthstone,3ctvk1,Vilis16,9,Fri Jul 10 21:09:49 2015 UTC,"Not only does it make a strong use of the corruption effect, but it makes the original corruption card pretty usable, too. There's even a double ""mass decay"" combo, and these are really card heavy but relatively cheap. Well done!"
customhearthstone,3ctvk1,Catman789,6,Sat Jul 11 00:19:11 2015 UTC,"It could cost 1 mana more given that it acts as a delayed enemy board wipe which could be really strong against many decks especially for just 3 mana.

customhearthstone,3ctvk1,Coolboypai,3,Fri Jul 10 20:09:35 2015 UTC,I think the mana cost should be changed but I'm not exactly great at balance.  Would love your guys' opinions.

customhearthstone,3cuwd1,blizzardplus,2,Sat Jul 11 00:29:31 2015 UTC,It would probably work like stealth or immunity where the minions just ignore the taunt.

customhearthstone,3cuteh,blizzardplus,2,Fri Jul 10 23:28:02 2015 UTC,"Similar line of thinking, I think it would be fine as a 3 cost minion. Maybe one less health so it's like ghoul?"

Sha'tar Vindicator  Cool too. The effect is powerfull for the cost and the stats but the fact that it's situational and only works against a few deck archetypes makes it well balanced but also quite bad. Well designed card but probably wouldn't be played over a Piloted Shredder as a good 4 drop.    Argent Dawn Templar  Nice one. Class specific Silver Hand Knight that really embrace the Paladin theme with the Divine Shield. I could see this be played instead of Piloted Shredder for the 4 mana slot."
customhearthstone,3cuw6f,BonomDenej,1 point,Sat Jul 11 11:57:37 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the nice synopsis of your opinions.  I recently noticed that Argent Dawn Templar would have more synergy with Avenge and Blessing of Might than Piloted Shredder. Avenge does not trigger on the deathrattle spawned minion from Piloted Shredder if you you have nothing else on the board when the Shredder dies. If you take this into account, it looks like a better Piloted Shredder in Aggro Pally in every way. Might even be too strong as it is with this in consideration.  Also, do you think the cards are too 'boring' mechanic wise? These are cards I could actually see the Hearthstone Dev team making but it seems like everyone on this sub likes crazy mechanics."

No one plays Silver Hand Knight in constructed for a reason. Why would I make a card that people would not want to play? This card has similar tempo gain of Dark Iron Dwarf too but does not require you to have a minion on the board.  What about Summon Charger do you think is too powerful? Think of Argent Commander, he is a 4/2 with charge and divine shield for 6 mana. If you use this on turn 5 or 6 you would most likely be playing it on a minion out of your hand with 3 Attack (thus becoming 4 attack) and you used 2 cards to do it rather than the 1 Argent Commander card. After turn 6 it gains more value for sure though. If you can give some crazy turn 7+ scenarios that are ridiculous I may agree with you though."

customhearthstone,3ctghn,Rowannn,6,Fri Jul 10 17:14:32 2015 UTC,"For Tempting Succubus the ""Your spells cost (12) this turn"" needs to be a battlecry for clarity.  Pretty cool cards otherwise :)"
customhearthstone,3ctghn,blizzardplus,2,Fri Jul 10 19:38:49 2015 UTC,"With that extra textual complexity, I think we'd really need to just go back to OP's original:   All spells cost (2) less. Battlecry: You can't play any more spells this turn.   There's no practical difference, right? I guess you could Innervate up in advance, but that feels obscure enough to not matter.  In terms of implementation, I'd set all spells to cost MAX_INT, and have the GUI display that cost as infinity. A bit more work for the GUI devs, but worth it for the card text clarity."
customhearthstone,3ctghn,matchu,2,Fri Jul 10 19:56:14 2015 UTC,"Innervate would not work as using Innervate with 10/10 Mana does nothing. So the Battlecry to set your Spells cost to (12) for this turn only is fair, and is functionally identical."
customhearthstone,3ctghn,Highfire,2,Sat Jul 11 16:50:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm not really all that concerned about the corner cases; I just feel like the card as written requires more parsing of the text and thought regarding its implications than I'd like.  I thought about this today when trying to find a way to summon Molten Giants in the current Tavern Brawl—I almost had it until someone pointed out that you can literally never have more than 10 current mana anyway :(  I'd also have questions about how the card as written interacts with Sorcerer's Apprentice or Preparation, though. If the intent is to be unable to play spells, we should just say that, rather than trying to think through all the implications of cost manipulation."
customhearthstone,3ctghn,matchu,2,Sat Jul 11 19:11:52 2015 UTC,"Creating a mechanic to serve a specific purpose without exception makes the game feel less intuitive than using an existing mechanic (Spell Mana Cost settings) that has some potential for interactivity. Though right now the only interactivity is with having two or more Sorcerer's Apprentices on the board, it isn't so much to say that the function stopped existing so much as it did change.   Loatheb doesn't stop people from casting all of their spells, it limits how much they can cast and it punishes them more for casting on that turn. If someone wants to Shadow Word: Death when he's played on Turn 10, they can. Reducing freedom in the game is better than removing it."
customhearthstone,3ctghn,Highfire,2,Sat Jul 11 20:12:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the card is definitely more interesting as written. It's just a bit tricky to parse and understand everything it's saying; I'd prefer a less interesting but more immediately understandable card. It's definitely a trade-off, though, and I wish we didn't have to make it; is there a clearer way to phrase the current mechanic?   All spells cost (2) less. Battlecry: Except that, on this turn, your spells cost (10)."
customhearthstone,3ctghn,matchu,2,Sat Jul 11 20:55:17 2015 UTC,"Ambiguity in cards is all too easy to have; when there are cards with similar rules or wording that function in a certain way, it makes for easy comparisons. That's why consistency is important in card texts for TCGs or CCGs. I think:   All Spells cost (2) less. Battlecry: Set your Spell costs to (12) this turn.   is a fair way of going about it. By setting the cost to 12 with the rule of all costs being reduced by 2, you infer that the resulting Mana cost would be 10. Because you're setting a cost, this would also override any previous Loatheb or Thaurissan functions until the effect has ended.  Immediate understanding I do not think is the issue; I think the issue is that there is not a way to gain an innate understanding of these functions within the game itself."
customhearthstone,3ctghn,Highfire,2,Sat Jul 11 22:44:25 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think I agree. The card as written relies on one of the most ambiguous mechanics in the game: the interaction between cost-setting and cost-adjusting. It's still not actually clear to me whether my spells would cost 10 or 12 after playing this card, or whether Sorcerer's Apprentice actually does anything here; these effects usually apply in the order played, kinda ish, right? But what's the play order here? If we had a rulebook, we'd know.  With a rulebook, I think the card would be fine as written. Since we don't have one, I kinda want to go the Blizzard route of being really clear about what the card would do in isolation, and just hope that other interactions would be uncommon enough that power players would feel okay about experimenting to find out. But the rulebook is the better solution :/"
customhearthstone,3ctghn,matchu,2,Sun Jul 12 04:12:43 2015 UTC,"The way I see it is that both effects must be visible in the end-result. In the order of Cost Adjustment, then Cost Setting, you negate the adjustment since it goes to whatever value was given for the Cost Setting. If you do it the other way around, you get an adjusted set value.   The TL;DR of our conversation is ""Manual pls"" though. And reasonably so, I think."

customhearthstone,3ctghn,Iceverin_HS,2,Fri Jul 10 19:55:40 2015 UTC,"Really cool ideas all around.   Burning shield is a very specific tech card, which is OK. personally, i think these hard counter kinds of cards are bad game design, but blizzard seems to like it. It really fucks face decks.   Ball of lightning MIGHT be really bad, but its hard to say. A five mana turn with 3 mana sounds really shitty, but then again its a flamestrike for 6 total mana. It also allows your enemy to make all the trades he wants, so it requires a really a super controly deck (which doesnt fit shaman imo). And on turn four, it will likely be overkill for your opponents board. Would be a lot better if it did 2 and 2 damage, similar to flood. Maybe those two cards would be a nice mix?  Overgrown palace fucks patron more than you think. looking up a random patron list, there are 12 minions that are below 3 mana, and this is NOT a deck that wins early. Patron warriors normally play a lot of minions together, flooding the board with shitty minions that draw cards. Being only able to play one a turn would be a huge drawback even before the combo.   Tempting succubus is such a weird card. hard to tell its power level. I want to say it should be a legendary, to reduce the reliability and force any high mana spell decks to be good on their own. Also 4 mana might be too early to start reducing card costs by so much. Plus its stats are too good for something that can be played so early with no downsides on turn 4. I think for a control deck, succubus is better than thaurissan. Which is kind of insane.   ultraxion is a strange card. It specifically targets deathrattle minions, which i think is unwarranted (and a little shitty as well). Think about how often lil exorcist gets procced. Plus, deathrattle isnt even the central theme in most early game decks nowadays. It's only really present in large amounts in zoo. And even zoo has imp gang boss as one of its most important sticky minions. The way i see it, this is just the belcher/shredder/highmane killer, which is too unreliable for my tastes. Plus against aggro, id prefer it to be a 4/12, but that is minor.   A cool alternative dragon could be, ""Battlecry: Deal 2 damage to all characters. If any enemy minions are summoned, take control of them."" Would be a cool way to turn the sticky minions against their owner."

customhearthstone,3ctghn,Iceverin_HS,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:51:51 2015 UTC,"Well, that's important. Rare cards are more expensive (in dust) and more rare that Commons. Just look at common cards. Most of them have got simple abilities like ""Taunt. Enrage: +3 attack"", ""Divine shield"" etc, because they are common cards, they are not very special. Rare cards have more complicated (I don't know what word to use) abilities, and I feel that Purge ability is enough to make this card rare. Epics and especially Legendaries have abilities designed to have a huge impact on the game.  Talking about Swipe. I play druid a lot and in my opinion this spell is not VERY good removal. It's a very good card, but sometimes something like Purge is way more useful than Swipe."
customhearthstone,3ctghn,KeyShell,1 point,Fri Jul 10 20:39:26 2015 UTC,"I don't know what to think about Ultraxion. Before Undertaker nerf this would be a GG card against deathrattle hunter, of course if you would survive to turn 9. It's still too overpowered. He's a dragon. Every legendary dragon have to be 9 mana 8/8 or 4/12. Maybe make him 4/12, Silence all enemy deathrattle minions (without killing them) and gain +1 attack for each silenced minion. This 12 health taunt is already a huge problem for every aggro decks."
customhearthstone,3ctghn,GuyInATopHat,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:51:04 2015 UTC,Ultraxion is easily one of the most OP cards in this deck. It has like 3 very useful effects. Where as Nozdormu just makes turns shorter... Ysera just gives a single dream card at the end of a turn. Even with your proposed changes its still OP. And I think yours is even more balanced than the TCs.
customhearthstone,3ctaqx,Ellikichi,14,Fri Jul 10 16:31:20 2015 UTC,"I will play devil's advocate and say that because of the same reasons youve mentioned, its also hard to really comment about much else; especially if the card presented doesn't introduce a particularly unique or interesting mechanic. So the only constructive feedback that can be given is on balance.  In the end though, I do agree with most of what you are saying but at the same time comments on balance should not be disregarded. It's good to discuss both the mechanics and the balance of the card, though do strive to make it more constructive (like comparing it to other similar cards) to help people improve."
customhearthstone,3ctaqx,Coolboypai,4,Fri Jul 10 18:01:09 2015 UTC,"When I make a card, I try to make it as balanced as it can be and figuring out the cost of the stats and the effect is to me really interesting because you need to imagine all kinds of scenarios with the current set of cards to get an idea of the impact of your own card on the game if it existed. To me, having a nice balanced card shows that you really understand your card's power."
customhearthstone,3ctaqx,BonomDenej,4,Fri Jul 10 16:47:11 2015 UTC,"Some programmers just needs to make a tool for testing custom cards. You know, Hearthstone simulator with ability to add custom cards."

customhearthstone,3ctaqx,zanatlol,2,Fri Jul 10 19:04:31 2015 UTC,If a card is over or under costed by more than 1 mana it's worth mentioning imo. Otherwise a strong or slightly weak card should be evaluated by the other facets of design.
customhearthstone,3ctaqx,psycho-logical,2,Fri Jul 10 19:31:24 2015 UTC,It's propably for the best to just not write anything after reading yet another dragon with 10/10 stats and battlecry: Deal 5 damage to all characters.
customhearthstone,3ctaqx,Tensaipengin,2,Fri Jul 10 21:55:02 2015 UTC,"I think balance comments have a significant place, here. We're attempting to design cards that would credibly belong in this game; that includes the cost.   No, we can't playtest them, but that shouldn't stop us from striving to get it right. If I post a card (which I haven't done yet, but soon tm), that's me giving my best guess, based on other equivalent cards currently in the game. If you think my cost is off, even by one, I want to know (but please tell me why, and counter -propose a cost). Let's have a conversation about it!   We can't be perfect with this, but that doesn't mean we should throw the baby out with the bathwater."

The only time I don't make a suggestion for how the card could be changed is when I say I love it. I always back up criticism with a new suggestion, and sometimes leave out the criticism part. Hopefully people see this post and take it to heart."
customhearthstone,3ctaqx,KeyShell,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:40:24 2015 UTC,"I think the takeaway is that, if the card has a balance problem, that doesn't mean it's shit; it means that we have an opportunity to talk about it.  If we're constructive instead of destructive, we'll all have a better time discussing balance—just like when anyone discusses literally anything. Positivity for life! :D"
customhearthstone,3crz7q,osm70,12,Fri Jul 10 08:09:47 2015 UTC,"I reckon a 3 mana version that only shares damage between each other would be slightly more viable, handlocks already have 2 amazing 4 mana cards hell fire and shadow flame this card won't be taking those spots because they're vital cards(obviously in the case of zoo they wouldn't run this at all) but if you reduce the mana and tweak the effect I'd say they might actually be played."

customhearthstone,3crz7q,Indigoh,0,Sat Jul 11 01:32:57 2015 UTC,"I like the idea, but it seems too OP. Most plays with that will be something like that: target your 2/1 and opponent's Rag, then kill opponent's 3/2 with your 2/1. In this way you spend about 5 mana to destroy something that costs your opponent 10 mana. I would make this card costs 6 mana. Maybe it's good as it is now, I don't know, I would have to play some games with that card."

Nobody is now playing it because there are much better Legendaries. Cairne is basically 8/10 and does really nothing. Good legendary must have an impact on game like Dr Boom, Rag, Tirion and all other good Legendaries. Your Legendary will be giving a 3/2 weapon which is already good, and that weapon will buff the minion to good stats for trading some low cost minions."

I've been thinking about the possibility of negative aura cards but they all seem too powerful as soon as they are aoe. But ye this design if played would make the paladin hero power and muster worthless. Maybe change it to played minions to avoid this.
customhearthstone,3cuor6,Sticowish,1 point,Sat Jul 11 00:21:15 2015 UTC,"Valid point.  I hadn't taken hero powers into consideration.  I'm not sure it would ""ruin"" the class but aggro paladin would be hit especially hard.  On the flip side, at least the Light's Justice weapon from Muster is probably more useful! XP  I considered making it a battlecry as opposed to an aura, which would maybe fix the problem, but I like the idea of negative auras.  Perhaps the best solution would be to make it a 2/4 so it dies to truesilver"
customhearthstone,3cuor6,barghunos,2,Sat Jul 11 00:37:22 2015 UTC,Maybe making it so that minions can't drop under 1 health would fix those problems. Almost like Summoning Portal can't make cards cost 0.(Just a thought I'm no expert).

customhearthstone,3cs1xp,BonomDenej,5,Fri Jul 10 09:53:00 2015 UTC,"Also, you can't have ?/? as it would break how silence works.   To respect the current game mechanics, the text should be:   0 Mana, 0/1 Whenever you draw this, cost (0-10) more, gain 0-10 Attack and 0-10 Health.  But, as far as balance is concerned, here is how I'd make it (less RNGeezus I think):  0 Mana, 0/1 Whenever you draw this, cost (0-5) more, gain 0-8 Attack and 0-4 Health."
customhearthstone,3cs1xp,BonomDenej,1 point,Fri Jul 10 12:17:41 2015 UTC,"I suppose it would Transform into the stuff, so silence does nothing to it."
customhearthstone,3cs1xp,BonomDenej,5,Fri Jul 10 12:48:49 2015 UTC,"Then the text would add ""Transform"". But a card that can be so strong needs to have counters and silence is one of them."

customhearthstone,3cs1xp,psycho-logical,1 point,Fri Jul 10 14:19:20 2015 UTC,Isn't unstable portal stronger because it makes the summoned card cheaper? It's basically the same.
customhearthstone,3cs1xp,psycho-logical,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:12:30 2015 UTC,"Yeah but a powerful card will still cost mana. OP's OC can be a 10/10 for 0. Unstable Portal can't give you this. Anyway, nice concept but definitely too RNG to my taste."

Murloc Tidecaller - I'm not 100% sure Murky's effect would interact with this one's ""Gain +1 attack every time a murloc is summoned."" If that includes resurrection-type summons, we've got some good, but manageable synergy.  Old Murk-Eye - You're probably only going to give him +1 from Murky, so not a big deal IMO.  Coldlight Seer - Murky gets even harder to kill!  Murloc Warleader - Murky is now swole.  Hungry Crab - Free stats for my crab!  Murky is annoyingly persistent, but not extremely dangerous on his own. If you let a murloc player control Murky + Warleader + Tidecaller for more than one turn, you probably deserve to lose."

customhearthstone,3csr91,Logarithmc,2,Fri Jul 10 15:06:07 2015 UTC,"power creep is a thing, and a 3/3/3 is no longer that great. Regarding your examples, MCT effect can be game winning, and he has lowish stats to compensate. Blood Knight has an interesting effect that you can build around, or use to disrupt your opponent (though divine shields aren't really a big thing). Blood Knight also has a huge pay off in stats if you pull it off.  This card's effect is polarising in that its very good and easy to get it off early, but currently it'd be too good in its current state for early game, but becomes really tough to pull off late game."

This card also means you can't play minions as well without getting them destroyed. It's also way too slow, starting off as an 8 mana 1/9. It's kind of like Troggzor in that it's amazing when you already have a board but if you're behind on board the opponent can just use the minions they already have to kill them. The card also gets completely destroyed by silence, and is extremely weak vs Priests (Cabal, SW:P), kind of like Maexxna. Actually, Maexxna is a really good comparison; she costs 6 and still isn't played. She kind of has a similar effect in that she disincentivises your opponent from playing good minions, but may be even better since she has the poison effect which is almost like having infinite attack when trading with minions. She also doesn't affect you playing your own minions, unlike this card."
customhearthstone,3csfbz,Logarithmc,1 point,Fri Jul 10 13:45:55 2015 UTC,"Man the concept is cool but it seems crazy OP. If you play this and you're opponent cannot remove it from the board it simply means he or she can't play minions as they will get destroyed and make this minion grow even stronger. Add to that this card has 9 health, only priests and warlocks need one card to remove this minion every other class needs two or three spells to remove it. This is ofcourse not counting minions on board but I am pretty sure there are no minions who can properly deal with this pre turn 9 and it is unlikely that your opponent has a crazy filled board by that turn in constructed."
customhearthstone,3csfbz,Tocor,2,Fri Jul 10 12:10:31 2015 UTC,"What way do you think would be the best to balance it? It could gain one attack for every kill, but I think that would make it useless."
customhearthstone,3csfbz,chriscrux,1 point,Fri Jul 10 12:31:31 2015 UTC,"effect is too onesided, if your opponent cant deal with it with their current board state and hand, you've basically won the game.   you could make it only apply to the first minion summoned a turn, and tweak the stats the a bit to make it better."
customhearthstone,3csfbz,Iceverin_HS,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:16:12 2015 UTC,"Wow, this card sounds crazy. It's very good when your opponent have no minions on the board, and that's I think only situation when this card is good. Otherwise your opponent will just kill this minion and won't give a fuck."
customhearthstone,3csfbz,fae_lai,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:18:31 2015 UTC,"i think it is slightly op. i think it needs a drawback of losing 1 hp every time it triggers. otherwise zoo can't beat it.  alternatively, make it only destroy minions summoned by you."
customhearthstone,3csfbz,yesyoucannon,1 point,Fri Jul 10 20:44:09 2015 UTC,"Two questions:   How do you see this working with summon effects like shredders' deathrattles, Animal Companion or Violet Teacher?

customhearthstone,3csfbz,Leg_U,1 point,Sat Jul 11 18:19:35 2015 UTC,"If a minion is summoned by any means, it will get killed. This includes stuff like shredders and violet teachers.  Battlecries go off before minions are summoned, so Jaraxxus will not get killed."

customhearthstone,3cs9xd,osm70,6,Fri Jul 10 10:46:13 2015 UTC,The biggest problem with this card is the fact that it impedes with Blizzard's anti-fun philosophy in Hearthstone by directly taking the opponent's card. A better solution would simply to make the minion add a copy of the top card rather than steal it. That way it's more fun to play against while also giving you the advantage of knowing what your opponent drew into.

customhearthstone,3cqzx6,Coolboypai,1 point,Fri Jul 10 02:02:10 2015 UTC,It's fine compared to something like wee spellstopper imo; 2 less health for more coverage. Though at the same time it suffers the same issues of not doing a whole lot and not really worth playing in most decks.
customhearthstone,3cqzx6,jaypenn3,1 point,Fri Jul 10 02:39:40 2015 UTC,"At the same time, 3 attack is a huge difference from 2. It means this card is better able to trade on its own."

customhearthstone,3cp9t8,h2g2Ben,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:25:37 2015 UTC,"That seems more reasonable, but the flavor of having two sharks, and those sharks being more powerful than sheep or chickens is too good.

customhearthstone,3cp9t8,dantes-infernal,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:45:44 2015 UTC,"Honestly, when creating the card I had Assassinate and Siphon Soul in mind.

But i think you should've went all the way. Like Lord of the arena has combined stats of 11 and this only 10.  Now 7 health is better for a taunt minion,but since it goes back to your hand,and you need to spend another 6 mana for it and it can never attack. I think you could've improved the stats to maybe 4 or 5/7"
customhearthstone,3cry05,Funsurge,1 point,Fri Jul 10 08:57:44 2015 UTC,"True, but at the same time, 7 health is very difficult to kill, and if they can't kill it in one turn, it can potentially protect you indefinately. Seeing as how when you replay it it has full health again.  It might be a little understatted, but i think that is always  better than overstatted, and the low stats compensate for the cool effect.  I also wasn't sure if i wanted it to dodge shadow words by setting it at 4 mana.   There is also the added benifit of it being a dragon, so every time it returns to your hand, it can enable your synergy cards, which i thought was a nice touch."
customhearthstone,3cry05,SorteKanin,1 point,Fri Jul 10 09:23:42 2015 UTC,"I think you're right. The ability isn't a liability, it's an advantage. It should definitely be lower than the ""standard"" 11 stats for lord of the arena."

I think the effect is more of a downside (even with the dragon in-hand synergy), so I'd price it 4 instead of 6, or keep it 6 mana but then add a ""Costs (1) less, but not less than (3)"" so that each time it comes back in your hand it becomes more and more powerful.

It gives it a bit more complexity, against aggro decks it can trade well, or you save it for a big spell combo and hold it in your hand until you need it.   It's not meant to be better than geomancer, as that is already a strong card. If is a side-grade. Both roughly as good as each other, but you trade a small benefit for a small downside."

Cards like this are very healthy for the game, because they encourage ""bad decks"". Take Hobgoblin for example. It never affected the meta, but hobgoblin makes previously bad cards much better. Wisp sucks until you can play two of them on turn 3 with hobgoblin. Imagine turn 2 coin + hobgoblin + 2 x wisp, then turn 3 Moonglade caretaker. That's two 2/3s and two 5/4s on turn 3, 12 damage of which can attack.  Math warrior sucked until patron was added. Demon warlock sucked until voidcaller, Mal'Ganis, et al. were added.

customhearthstone,3cp43n,VreesKees,4,Thu Jul 9 17:16:32 2015 UTC,"This is super weak for 10 mana. Sticking with the same general idea, here's a more balanced version:  Tentacle: 2/2 taunt with spell damage +1  Eye of C'thun: 2/10, at the end of YOUR turn summon a Tentacle. Immune while you control a Tentacle. Deathrattle summon Body of C'thun and Stomach of C'thun.  Body of C'thun: 2/10 at the end of EACH turn summon a Tentacle. Immune while you control Stomach of C'thun.  Stomach of C'thun: 0/10 at the end of EACH turn deal 2 damage to a random enemy.  To be totally honest I'm not entirely sure if that's balanced. I know it fits the raid really well though. Yours was too weak, mine MIGHT be too strong, but I honestly don't know for sure.  C'Thun is my favorite boss too, and that whole event is my favorite thing that ever happened in WoW. I honestly believe they never topped it.  Also just an after thought; even if my version is overpowered in terms of value and stats, I think there are other cards that are more overpowered in terms of stats and the meta is so fast that the power you get from playing my version wouldn't matter anyways."
customhearthstone,3cp43n,KeyShell,2,Thu Jul 9 18:08:42 2015 UTC,I don't think this is overpowered at all. Any 10-mana minion has to be insane to be playable in this game.

But as others have mentioned, a 10 mana 0/10 is just far far too weak and slow to be of any use. Like it has a Deathrattle... Is your opponent going to throw a Pyroblast at it to kill it to summon its next form? (Which also isnt spectacular). How does it die at 10 health and 0 attack? The stats/mana cost/effect could use some overall work."

As it stands, the card is significantly better than Ancient Watcher if you Silence or Taunt them, and it's able to attack by default. And it's a dragon. So I think it's maybe a little too strong."
customhearthstone,3coc0d,louwilliam,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:31:18 2015 UTC,"The first thing I thought about was how it interacts with Shrinkmeister, but it only lets you attack a 2-attack minion and live.  I would change its stats to 5/7 so you can attack a 1/1 an live if you really want to, or on turn 2 (going second) for example, use Shrinkmeister, attack your opponent's 3/2 and leave behind a body to be healed up or silenced later. I like that this makes the card more versatile.  Maybe Priests could even get a 3-mana ""Real"" Mass Dispel some time, one which silences your own minions too, and would let you use a 5/1 Drake the turn after you cleared the 3/2 wih it. Or since the Drake is strong with both Taunt and Silence, I might change it to be very vulnerable to Silence instead, like a 0/0 that gains a buff.  To save space, the buff doesn't even necessarily have to be part of the card text but could be indicated as +5/+6 on the base stats, or made a keyword as ""dies when silenced.""  An alternative could be to make it rely fully on Silence, as Priest does also have a Silence theme, and give it ""die when given Taunt."""
customhearthstone,3coc0d,Soul_burn,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:38:47 2015 UTC,"I like your ideas a lot. The Shrinkmeister interaction was actually something I hadn't considered.

customhearthstone,3coc0d,Coolboypai,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:50:16 2015 UTC,"I'm confused in the purpose of the card itself. If you attack any minion with at least 1 attack with this dragon it'll just die. Outside of taunting, silencing or just going for face with this guy, it doesn't seem to massively useful"

customhearthstone,3coc0d,fae_lai,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:49:14 2015 UTC,"It is overpowered in one of the two ways it would often be used, which is, bluntly put, a 2 mana silenced/taunted 5/6.  The other way of it being used, with no silence or taunt, is actually kind of interesting, but quite overpowered as well as it's essentially a 2 mana ""trade for an up to 5-drop"". As a measure of its power, it trades evenly with a 4 mana yeti - even if that isn't the most relevant comparison in today's 4-drop meta, this fact makes the card better and more reliable at straight up trading than any other card up to 4 mana, besides the shredder. It's the best two drop in the game, bar cards you need for combos (Knife Juggler, Sorcerer's Apprentice).  You said this in another post:   Even you said, lower its attack by 1. If I did, then it would basically be either a worse Ancient Watcher, or just be equivalent to it.   I want to point out that this can attack without you having to devote a silence or taunt to it, meaning it can just trade as a 2 mana 5 attacker. Since most 2 drops don't survive trading anyway, it's just a better 2 drop for almost every trade, and if a trade is unfavorable for you to initiate (Haunted Creeper), you can just keep it around to trade for something else as it's nigh invulnerable with its 6 health.  Kudos for the dragon, though. Always needs more dragons. It's also cool that you tried to incorporate the healing theme of priest by making its special ability related to taking damage.  How you go about balancing it really depends on what you actually want the card to do (or, going further, which potential version is the best for the game).   You could make it also deal its damage to your hero to make it a more costly investment you have to consider. It also allows you to more or less keep its mega high stats, but it still doesn't solve the silence/taunt OP-ness. You could make the card: Sunstreak Dragon, 2 mana 1/4, Battlecry: At the start of your next turn, gain 4 attack until end of turn. This iteration requires you to time its play with foresight before a critical turn instead of as a 2-drop. I strongly believe it would work better as a 1/3, or more likely a 3-drop. You could make the card: Sunstreak Dragon, 2 mana 1/5, Battlecry: At the start of your turn, take 2 damage and gain 2 attack. (the wording could be better, but Blizzard does it like this too so whatever) What this does is the opponent can use 3 damage spells or minions to trade (just as they would against a regular 2 drop). But if they don't, it becomes a 3/3 for 2 mana. This isn't really refined.   And so on.  Edit: Actually, I even missed a single (but huge) subtlety in this mechanic: this minion deals its damage to itself before the attack connects, so if it has 5 or less health when it attacks, the attack never connects. Once again ignoring the silence/taunt issue, this could be a pretty interesting mechanic, but the problem is that for the opponent to prevent the trade, they have to damage the minion (either for 3+ to put it beyond your healing, or for at least 1 to force you to heal it if you want to trade), which is easy for classes with ping but others simply can't do it without losing advantage. It does have some nice PW: Shield interaction, though."
customhearthstone,3coc0d,SorteKanin,1 point,Sun Jul 12 07:37:51 2015 UTC,"weirdly i think it is pretty well ballanced. it it attacks somethign with attack it dies. maybe increase the mana 1, or reduce both the health and attack 1.  if you want it to live you have to reduce it's attack or increase it's hp.  so it is basicly a alternate corruption. you have to wait a turn, then you can deal damage, but if you don't hit face it pretty much dies. you can heal it, but not out of self killing the seccond attack if immediate. and the turns waited with it just sitting and ableto be delt with is 3 turns. it is a threat but not a super huge one.  so the effect is basicly 5 damage to face, 5 damage to face or board. and 6 mana and 3 turns before you can use it again. it presents greater utility to your hero power, making it so you will use it more.  the big deal is that the damage is basicly from 30 to 20, or pre-alexstraza. so the face damage doesn't matter much."

customhearthstone,3corpx,TwinkleTwinkleBaby,1 point,Fri Jul 10 00:44:05 2015 UTC,"almost all combos don't deal well with armor or taunts either. The main problem imo is that this combo uses just 4 cards and deals quite a bit setting your base health to 15 and doing 18 damage. It's quite efficient and not too difficult to set up either with Priest's playstyle and if anything, you can even throw an extra silence in there to get rid of any pesky taunts for free if needed.  But its not to say the charge thing isnt weird either. Something like ""The next minion you play this turn costs (3) less, gains Charge and +3 Health"" might be better"

Second, it's also got a pirate tribal, which neither of the other listed draw cards have. (Compare with Azure Drake, 5 cost 4-4 with guaranteed draw, dragon tribal and spell damage +1).  Third, the ability to remove a card from your opponent's hand was once costed at 8 6 as a spell, via an earlier version of Mind Vision, IIRC. So having it as a combo on a three drop is crazy.

Do Paladins need another heal?    Riptide  Shamans don't lack heal that much. It doesn't make much sense to me to give them a more efficient Priest Hero Power. But in the end, I agree that Shaman could use a better Hero Power.    Rogue Duskblade  Ok, here I really don't understand how you thought this was a good idea. This is a straight better Ravenholdt Assassin for 3 less mana. The downside is avoidable with a simple step: Always play this card first. It should be the opposite, have the downside standard and make the combo cancel that downside.    High Overloard Saurfang  Since Warriors don't have heal it might be ok as the Enrage won't be triggered more than once, but the fact that it's extremely hard to remove, and easy to combo with Whirlwind makes it too good. You have, with whirlwind, a 10 mana complete board wipe that leaves you with a 6 mana body. That's way too good, it's even better than playing anything with a brawl for instance, as you're sure to have this on your side. Make it 10 mana and tweak the stats. More attack, less health.    Imperator Mar-gok  I would have embraced the Ogre theme and make the spells random instead of what you did but yours is fine as it still applies to both players and your own Imperator will be damaged through those spells. I like this one overall.    Ruby Lifebinder  Too good as it is. Make it at the beginning of your turn and the card is fixed. Right now it's a waaaay better Antique Healbot for 1 more mana.    Yogg Saron  I like this. It goes with the fact that Yogg Saron is one uncontrollable thing and this could backfire at any moment.    Coilfang Honor Guard  Like you said, make it 3 Attack and it's good. I like it.    Moonkin Form  Probably too good but hard to know. The wording is wrong tho, it should me ""Gives a friendly minion Spell Damage +2"".    Vengeful Vindicator  Pretty well balanced in my opinion but too situationnal to see plays. Against Jaraxxus though it would hit for 10 damage to the face, and that's amazing."

customhearthstone,3cjhnn,Postingwordsonreddit,5,Wed Jul 8 11:50:28 2015 UTC,"It's a really neat idea for a card, though maybe the mana cost should be adjusted but it's honestly a great card IMO, love the name."
customhearthstone,3cjhnn,OkeanPiscez,4,Wed Jul 8 13:35:44 2015 UTC,"So, ignoring which minion this is cast on, what Deathrattle would you hope to see?   Assuming ""Resummon this minion"" is off the table, I think ""Equip a 5/3 Ashbringer"" would be near the top."
customhearthstone,3cjhnn,_Gallade,3,Wed Jul 8 16:13:16 2015 UTC,"""summon a random legendary minion"" or ""take control of a random enemy minion"" would be the two best I think.  Really, any of the legendary minions' deathrattles, except The Beast would be good."
customhearthstone,3cjhnn,yesyoucannon,2,Wed Jul 8 18:38:33 2015 UTC,"""Ashbringer"", ""summon a random legendary"" or ""take control"" would all be awesome!!  There are currently 32 deathrattlecards in-game. 10 that are from legendary cards, 1 epic, 5 rare and 18 common ones. The average manacost of a deathrattlecard is 4 mana. Some deathrattles can be really strong, some can screw you over and some are just meh. http://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Deathrattle  My thought behind it was: On your turn (obviously) which means you can avoid silence effects that usualy counters deathrattles and on a small friendly minion that you want to trade with a enemy minion. Having a kinda small manacost makes it nice to use early on and hope for like Cain Bloodhoofs, Sneeds or Sky Golems deathrattle. But it can also work well to play in mid- or lategame when you have additional mana to spend that turn depending on what deathrattle you get to choose from. The downside is of course that there are some really crappy deathrattles out there and rng is rng. Say you play it early on a 2/1 minion wanting to trade it with a 3/2 minion and you get too choose from Deathlords, Malornes and Dancing Swords deathrattles. No real winners there and you basically wasted a turn.  The manacost of the card and which class it should be avalible to is not my strong side, but it would need to resonably low in mana for it to be worth it."

customhearthstone,3cklei,eshall,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:16:28 2015 UTC,"I feel like no response to this yet, is a shame, because its such a cool card! So I'll give a response. I think the stats could use a tweak. Its ability procs on it killing stuff, but as a 4 drop, its 3 attack is less relevant. So maybe if it were a 4/3 or something, it would be more appealing. That being said, I can see why you'd want it to have more health. Regardless, its a very cool card idea. I like it a lot! :)"
customhearthstone,3cklei,lynbeaut,1 point,Thu Jul 9 00:42:41 2015 UTC,"I feel like haveing a less relevant attack helps it stay balanced.   You need to be very careful with silences, because too many in the game makes it less fun for everyone. And this is a card that can give you multiples. I feel like 3 attack is ideal."
customhearthstone,3cklei,hoorahforsnakes,1 point,Fri Jul 10 11:15:19 2015 UTC,"I wasn't saying it should be 4 attack, I was saying for it to appeal to players it would probably need higher attack. I think its a cool card where its at."

customhearthstone,3cklei,lynbeaut,1 point,Thu Jul 9 04:12:14 2015 UTC,"Difference is with this you can kill a minion, heal it back up and kill another for 2 silences.   Also it gives you a body on the board for tempo, without having to keep the minion in your hand for a silence target."
customhearthstone,3chulj,Supreme-Leader-Snoke,14,Wed Jul 8 00:55:05 2015 UTC,"I like a lot of these, especially the orb idea, it's interesting. However, Psychic Horror seems very overpriced. Playing two saps you can't target with a conditional upside doesn't seem like a 10 mana card."
customhearthstone,3chulj,traf12,1 point,Wed Jul 8 02:09:31 2015 UTC,"""If in shadowform, this card costs 6 mana"" sounds fine to me."

customhearthstone,3chulj,MrWiseDoge,9,Wed Jul 8 14:07:09 2015 UTC,"Really cool design around the orb concept. I'm concerned how dependent the cards are on shadowform though, why didn't you make an additional way to gain shadowform?  You definitely tended towards the weak side with many of the cards. Blood-Queen Lana'thel is pretty weak for a 7 drop (definitely weaker than antonidas or velen), I would say she needs to summon two Shadow orbs at minimum, but preferably her stats should be better, 5/9 or 6/8 would be great.  Psychic horror is way too expensive for a random effect. Double random sap should probably cost 6 at most, even with the situational upside.  Infusion of light should cost 1, you're already sacrificing the mana sunk into shadowform.  I think the cost efficient damage spells ruin the priest's clear direct damage weakness, and probably should cost more. By design, priests do NOT have access to frostbolt and the like, in exchange for the shadow words. Their best direct damage is Holy Fire, which is very expensive.  But the only truly overpowered card is Dark Halo. That is a lot of stats to put on the board for 3 mana, even if it does happen over time. 0/10 in 5 bodies is fantastic, since they have spell power your opponent probably has to deal with them, wasting a lot of face damage. Add on buff synergy and it becomes a little overbearing.  Great concepts, would love to see more in the future."

customhearthstone,3chulj,jaypenn3,1 point,Wed Jul 8 02:44:53 2015 UTC,"That's a weak argument against the card. They're different classes, and Dark Extraction doesn't give a choice of AOE.  There are plenty of spells for one class that have objectively better comparable spells for another class. Dark bomb and Frostbolt, for example.   EDIT: See below."
customhearthstone,3chulj,h2g2Ben,2,Wed Jul 8 18:53:30 2015 UTC,"With Frostbolt, that's because mage spells are supposed to be stronger in general.  Better example would be Quick Shot versus Dark Bomb."

customhearthstone,3cgjbo,warmshadows,12,Tue Jul 7 19:05:10 2015 UTC,"Your art is good, but be careful with your card ideas.   Their are 8 spells that heal in this game, and the results vary greatly from Ancestral Healing to Tree of Life. That said their are many cards like it so that's okay. Getting 3 of these cards can be realty strong card draw for 5 mana if you get the right spells, but it is only playable against slow decks, which is not what you typically need healing for, essentially making it a tree of life that you can only reliably play against control paladin/warrior. So I wouldn't play it. Way too strong, yes it is a 6 mana weapon, but you can go to face every turn in addition to being a gorehowl if you can't. Dragonwrath is extremely weak compared to the likes of standard card draw. Probably balanced, so I think I'm okay with this. A cool minion actually. This one gets my personal ""good job"", as it is the best one of the set. in terms of that cool idea vs balance mix.   One of these days people who make great art should team up with guys with fantastic cards but can't draw."
customhearthstone,3cgjbo,Burning_Titan,3,Tue Jul 7 20:58:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the ""not for face hunters"" comment on the needs-two-cards weapon kinda cracks me up. Face hunters would absolutely run this. It's generally okay to hold onto direct damage cards for burst anyway, and, even if the two cards you want to play provide more than the weapon's 6 damage per turn, minions are way more removable; if your opponent doesn't run Ooze or Harrison (or Blingtron? anyone? :D), you can have this 6 damage per turn forever."

customhearthstone,3cgpd8,Warrh,9,Tue Jul 7 19:47:32 2015 UTC,chaos bolt is just way to crazy
customhearthstone,3cgpd8,mraider94,5,Tue Jul 7 21:47:28 2015 UTC,"Spirit Walker: This is too good. You have 6 minions with Overload:   Dust Devil (3/1 windfury) Fireguard Destroyer (3/6) Dunemaul Shaman (5/4 windfury, 50% to hit) Earth Elemental (7/8 taunt) Siltfin Spiritwalker (2/5, murloc synergy) and Neptulon. (7/7)   That's insane. Dust Devil might be fine–no charge means it has to wait a turn and it can easily be taken out (1 HP). However...the rest are rediculous. Let's take the worst stats, (2/5). This gets you a (4/4) and (2/5) for 7 mana. Looking at the 2x(mana)+1 formula, this gets us 15/15 points. a fair value. Fireguard puts us at 17 points, sligtly OP. The rest put us WAY over. That means there's a 66% chance to get over the 15 points that most 7-drops have. Granted there are exceptions, but Earth Elemental (best option) gets you a total of 24 points. That's just too much, even if it was a 1/6 chance, but it's not (Netptulon).   I honestly think this just needs a new ability.  Lightning Shield: I like the idea of a defenside option for AOE minion buffing, but I think you should take away 1 stat point. Druid's savage roar costs 3 as well but only gives 2 points to each minion. I think the same should apply here. Perhaps make it +2 health until end of turn, allowing for better trading but letting Bloodlust keep its spot as the major attack buff spell and thus balancing this card.  Mind Flay: This is a neat card. However, I think it currently costs 1 too much. A 2-cost version might see some use. Maybe even drop it to 1 cost. Silence is 0, and this card doesn't guarantee any damage...  Earthquake: Neat take on the much-desired Shaman Earthquake card. I think this too could be lowered in cost. Maybe 7 or 6. I'm comparing it to Vanish, here, which costs 6. I just don't feel like the chance to put it in the deck is worth 2 mana more. That could actually hurt the user a lot.  Eclipse: Okay. Nothing too special, but I could see some uses, and it seems balanced.  Sporebat: Neat. A new 1-drop that distinguishes itself from the others. Nothing more to say here.  Chaos Bolt: I sort of want this to be a 5-cost. You could theoretically play Dark Bomb, then two of these bolts, and deal 19 damage in one turn WITHOUT spell damage. The discard may make up for it, or I may be overvaluing the card, but I don't like the idea of such devastating burn cards.  Curious Cub: I think this should cost 6. Beasts are generally cheaper. Spiders, boars, bears...it wouldn't cost a lot to play a whole bunch. Maybe mess with the flavor/art/name though. I don't see what a little tiger cub would be a 4/4. The full-fledged tiger is a 5/5...it just doesn't make sense to me.  Neat set. Hope some of what I said helped!"
customhearthstone,3cgpd8,Audiencefone,2,Tue Jul 7 22:01:11 2015 UTC,"Thanks! I love indepth comments. Now let's see here..   Spirit Walker: This is too good.    I had a really hard time distributing stats to this one. I did some math, and it seems you get on an avarage 4,5/5,1 from the summon. That's a 8/9 worth of stats. So a 8/9 for 7 might be a bit crazy and I should have probably made it 8 mana.   Lightning Shield: I like the idea of a defenside option for AOE minion buffing, but I think you should take away 1 stat point. Druid's savage roar costs 3 as well but only gives 2 points to each minion.   Yeah, my plan was to find some sort of middle ground without trying to take someones place. As for Druid's savage, it will also give your Hero +2 attack, making it never a completly dead card. I sort of don't have a problem with Lightning Shield as of yet.   Mind Flay: This is a neat card. However, I think it currently costs 1 too much. A 2-cost version might see some use.    I'm afraid it would be to punishing, minions have often more than one ability now a days, just look at Sunwalker:  6 mana 4/5 Taunt. Divine Shield.  It goes from being the bane of Priest to a joke with Mind Flay.(Even worse if it cost 2) I kind of feel that Pain and Death should be seen as the main removal.   Earthquake: Neat take on the much-desired Shaman Earthquake card. I think this too could be lowered in cost. Maybe 7 or 6. I'm comparing it to Vanish, here, which costs 6. I just don't feel like the chance to put it in the deck is worth 2 mana more. That could actually hurt the user a lot.   Once again, I tried to avoid trying to steal spotlight. The two cards I had in mind was Vanish and Twisted Nether. I don't know, man, I am kind of drawn in diffrent ways here. At one hand, this would be Shamans big spell. Think Mind Control, Lay on Hands and Pyro Blast. But on the other hand, it might not see play with such a high cost.   Chaos Bolt: I sort of want this to be a 5-cost. You could theoretically play Dark Bomb, then two of these bolts, and deal 19 damage in one turn WITHOUT spell damage.   In short, it's the Doomguard of spells. :) I also dislike devastating burn cards, but I think it would be hard to sustain such a burst when your entire hand is discarded.Though, It could/should be a bit worse since it belongs to Warlock.   Curious Cub: I think this should cost 6. Beasts are generally cheaper. Spiders, boars, bears...it wouldn't cost a lot to play a whole bunch. Maybe mess with the flavor/art/name though. I don't see what a little tiger cub would be a 4/4. The full-fledged tiger is a 5/5...it just doesn't make sense to me.   It was my attempt to fuel some more Beast Hunters, but I can agree that it's a bit Cheap. Still, playing 5 beasts just to make it free feels like you are going to get punished hard by aoe. Could be crazy with Unleash the doggies, though. As for the art.. I'm not that creative. :)"

I still think the issue is the ability. The high-stat minions this can get are just insanely good, and you don't have any downside, and you get a 4/4. Even for 8, I think this has roughly a 50% chance to be the most OP card in the game.  Lightning Shield   Yeah, my plan was to find some sort of middle ground without trying to take someones place...   Fair enough.  Mind Flay:   just look at Sunwalker...   Good point.

I'm honestly not even sure a lot of people would use this. I wouldn't. I'd just keep running my two lightning storms. This card has a LOT of potential bad for the user. Given the right circumstance, It's amazing too, though. I'd still advocate a cost drop, but maybe just 1 mana less. At 7, I might try one in a deck for use when I don't have any/much on the field. At 8, I think it would sit in my library or get insta-dusted.  Chaos Bolt:   Though, It could/should be a bit worse since it belongs to Warlock.   Malygos is a neutral card. Just saying.

Still, playing 5 beasts just to make it free feels like you are going to get punished hard by aoe. Could be crazy with Unleash the doggies, though.    I don't think you need it to be free. Or, reduce the stats to 3/3 and keep it at 5. That way it's a bit more feasible and you keep the cost. I think the general rule (at the moment) for cost reduction like this is +2 mana cost (see volcanic drake).   As for the art..

Let's do the math here. Soulfire, the mini version of this card is (1) mana deal 4 damage with discard a card. Dealing 4 damage costs around 2-3 mana, therefore discarding a card can be assumed to be worth 1.5 mana. So discarding two cards is worth 2-3 mana. I think you can already see this in Doomguard. Due to this, Chaos Bolt should deal the damage of a 6 mana spell, which is around 8."

customhearthstone,3cfg4g,FLoppy_McLongsocks,17,Tue Jul 7 15:07:20 2015 UTC,EA is still good in some zoolock decks and really isn't that bad of a 1-drop. I don't like the fact that this card just demolishes EA when there really isn't anything wrong with it. 1-drops just aren't frequently used.
customhearthstone,3cfg4g,waupunwarrior,14,Tue Jul 7 15:42:51 2015 UTC,An almost strictly better Elven Archer.
customhearthstone,3cfg4g,VreesKees,0,Tue Jul 7 15:28:41 2015 UTC,almost? Is there any downside?
customhearthstone,3cfg4g,Aleksx000,3,Tue Jul 7 19:45:32 2015 UTC,It can't hit face.

customhearthstone,3cfg4g,End4r,6,Tue Jul 7 15:14:43 2015 UTC,Think of all the 1 off lethals you'll get because you used this card instead of Elven Archer.  Kappa
customhearthstone,3cfg4g,Scyion,4,Tue Jul 7 19:33:53 2015 UTC,Too good. It's elven archer with a heck of a bonus if you can set up the kill. You can potentially kill one minion and then trade this into a second one clearing two minions for a single mana crystal.
customhearthstone,3cfg4g,jdmgto,3,Tue Jul 7 19:06:16 2015 UTC,I would say overpowered. It's easily card advantage and a tempo swing on a 1 drop.

In your situation this card is just a 1-1 and cannot be buffed. So my change makes it worse.   Regarding the creeper, there are plenty of situations where getting three juggles and a 2 attack with charge would be hugely helpful.  Say I'm against mage and the mage just pinged my creeper and dropped mirror image.  It's turn three, my creeper is down to 1. I play the juggler for 2, attack a mirror image for one with the creeper, ping my creeper with this card, and get three juggles and a 2-attack minion with charge, and probably clear the mirror images."

E.g. if you play BGH with the enemy's board clear and you have dr. boom out, you have to kill your own dr. boom.

I think that Chillwind Yeti and Dark Iron Dwarf are two of the strongest 4 drops in the game.  Class cards are sometimes better, but that's mostly because how unfairly bad the neutral counterparts are. Just look at Frostwolf Grunt and Anodized Robo Cub or Soot Spewer and Dalaran Mage.  Of course there is exceptions to this, Druid of the Claw is stronger that Fen Creeper because Druids are supposed to have the biggest creatures. But in other cases, class cards are mostly just diffrent.   Lightspawn and Anub'ar Anbusher are both a 5/5, but their ability can sometimes be a weakness. Dunemaul Shaman gives you Overload and has the 50% Ogre ability.  In most cases, these abilites are there to synergies with their class in some way, but isn't always the best pick."

Once in a while a class card is weaker than a neutral, but those are far and few between.

I'm sorry but I simply don't agree.    Let's start with Voidcaller. First off - a 3/4 for 4 mana is not really good, this is easy. But the power in this card lies in a Deathrattle. The ability to summon a random Demon from your hand is quite good, but it isn't OP. It isn't instant, It can be ignored and it can be silenced. I would compare this more to Piloted Shredder, and that card is neutral and a Mech. Sure, it's crazy when you get malganis or Doomguard from your Voidcaller, but they must be in your hand at that time. I could go on, but I will leave it at that, for now. Goblin Blastmage is really good. It's both strong and reliable. At worse it's a 5/4 for 4 (Good) at best, it will wipe a small board and give you huge tempo.(Godlike) few cards have this power on their own, and it's really card to compare it.   The only card that beats Chillwind yeti in a real way is Water Elemental. It has the same stats and an ability. Minions that are sometimes better, but other times worse, isn't always better."

customhearthstone,3ccjan,TheOptimisticBrit,6,Mon Jul 6 21:12:03 2015 UTC,"I think the card is fine, ultimately, but I just have something against the whole ""Silence then kill stuff"" sort of approach that so many fan-card creators take. Earthshock is an exception to this because its largely useless otherwise out of specific scenarios (ala mortal coil for shaman).  I just feel like the ""Silence then do damage or kill"" is a run-into-the-ground concept by now. Yes we all know little zoo minions that flood the board with deathrattles, or small effects are annoying. Yes we all know that it would be SO lovely to have a single answer to it every time. -Forcing zoo to be more creative, and shaking up the meta.  Yes, but this is hearthstone. Zoo is here, its gunna stay, aggro is staying, making a single card to try to fix it is a dream.  (Mini-rant I apologize)"
customhearthstone,3ccjan,lynbeaut,3,Tue Jul 7 04:41:02 2015 UTC,"I totally agree with you about that for most cases, but in this particular one I don't.  For starters, this card fits into the Shaman theme because of Earth Shock.  Moreover, Shaman is the only class without a board clear common.  Shaman gets absolutely shit on by aggro decks right now, and is almost unplayable in arena because your odds of drafting a lightning storm are so terrible.  This card is actually slightly overcosted, and will really only get value out of the silence against Zoo and Patron Warrior, but it would still be an autoinclude in many Shaman decks."
customhearthstone,3ccjan,thermiter36,1 point,Tue Jul 7 07:13:44 2015 UTC,Mini-rant as much as you want. Like I say it was just a musing- trying to think of something the Earthquake spell Shaman has in WoW would do in Hearthstone. Earthquake = big Earthshock was my reasoning. And a zoo killing card is not horrifying. Making Shaman the anti-aggro class means boosting the class in constructed.

customhearthstone,3ccjan,supersecrettest,1 point,Wed Jul 8 00:06:09 2015 UTC,This is less useful than you would think. rarely does the enemy have more than one card worth silencing out at a time the cost of 5 plus overload is a bit too much.
customhearthstone,3ccjan,SorteKanin,1 point,Mon Jul 6 22:27:58 2015 UTC,"5 cost is actually pretty cheap as this is a Mass Dispel + Consecrate - 1 Card Draw and 2 damage to the face which means it should cost about 7, so I think because shaman is a bit weak the costing is fine."
customhearthstone,3ccjan,happystickman,1 point,Tue Jul 7 00:31:03 2015 UTC,I figured Mass Dispel without card draw would be roughly 2 / 2.5 cost (card draw is generally worth 1.5 cards) + Consecrate. So 2+4. Then because I wanted it to be 5 cost I added the overload.
customhearthstone,3ccjan,psycho-logical,1 point,Wed Jul 8 00:03:59 2015 UTC,"It deals too little damage to be viable. Shaman needs a heavier board clear that deals more damage - a 6 mana, 2 damage to everything is not particularly useful."

customhearthstone,3cdd05,psycho-logical,3,Tue Jul 7 02:03:33 2015 UTC,It's just a very dangerous effect for how powerful it potentially is. Even with Hunter's limited card drawing there's plenty of neutral options. Loot Hoarder alone is pretty insane with this guy.

In the best case, it survives a turn and draws you an extra card.  In the mega best case, you get to combo it in one turn with a quick shot or starving buzzard or something.  Either way, it's slow as hell, and if you get value out of it, you were likely winning anyway.  I think it's not OP at all, and would probably rarely see play if implemented."

There are currently no pirates that interact with your weapon's durability (tho there is one that removes it from your opponents) and 2 that are directly buffed by your weapon's attack.    I felt that getting buffed by durability lends itself to interesting and complex plays do you attack now, or save your charge to get the extra buff? Also currently the best pirate classes are warrior and rogue, but for the most part they have low durabiloty on their weapons, something like this lends itself more towards stuff like paladin and shaman.  Also thematically gaining health just seemed to fit, seeing as if your weapon is more durable, you can parry more hits before it breaks"

customhearthstone,3ca6w5,EpicLives7,3,Mon Jul 6 18:00:22 2015 UTC,"While I really like this idea, the card's stats make it a strictly better Spider Tank. On the other hand, there is Dark Cultist, so this might be acceptable for a class card."
customhearthstone,3ca6w5,virulentArachnid,18,Mon Jul 6 11:07:21 2015 UTC,"Well it is a class card, and you have to combo into it."
customhearthstone,3ca6w5,Fenastus,4,Mon Jul 6 11:08:17 2015 UTC,"Also the spider tank is a mech, which gives it a slight edge over a vanilla 3/4  I think it's fine"
customhearthstone,3ca6w5,SteveWoods,14,Mon Jul 6 22:08:57 2015 UTC,"Yh i was using dark cultist as a reference. And spider tank also has the mech tag going for it. Also 3 mana makes it more difficult to combo early game.   I wanted a minion that was strong enough that you wouldn't feel too bad about playing on its own without comboing it, but the combo gives it a nice bonus.   Also a solid 3 drop helps to push rogue back towards tempo decks, and give the class options that don't involve bursting you down in one turn."
customhearthstone,3ca6w5,psycho-logical,4,Mon Jul 6 11:27:20 2015 UTC,"Beyond the class card argument, Spider Tank is also a Mech.  Honestly considering the power level of cards like Dark Cultist, making it be a combo is probably not necessary."
customhearthstone,3ca6w5,jdmgto,3,Mon Jul 6 14:37:54 2015 UTC,"You're also forgetting how relevant Mech is. This card is great, but far from 'strictly better'"
customhearthstone,3ca6w5,Austen98,2,Mon Jul 6 16:17:29 2015 UTC,I think it's more the combo than the class restriction that make it acceptable. You can play a spider tank on turn 3 and get full value out of it. This you've gotta wait or use another card to get the added benefit.

customhearthstone,3cchrx,Killer4free,3,Mon Jul 6 21:00:48 2015 UTC,I'm not sure this is actually that good of a card. How often is destroying the board worth 8 health?

For example, Wild Hunt technically can act as a 0-mana removal spell (I'm guessing you probably want to change it to only targetable on friendly minions, because otherwise it's ridiculously broken :P). Or Druid of the Talon is incredibly strong with a card like Savage Roar, and I think it can be agreed that Druids don't really need more burst combo pieces. Kil'Jaeden is basically a cheaper Deathwing with an upside and without the drawback, and even cards like Happy Fisher are EXTREMELY strong.  Overall though you have some really great cards! I'd just suggest toning back their effects."

And considering gazeilla already sort of has soft taunt because people just want it dead, i don't know that it feels destinct enough.

The effect is insane! You get 8 attacks out of it, with more power than Gorehowl, at a lower cost.

customhearthstone,3cbdat,Coolboypai,0,Mon Jul 6 19:00:40 2015 UTC,I don't think the priest or druid staffs are balanced. The priest staff is almost like shadow word pain (in most cases) plus summon a 3 mana minion and a 2 mana weapon. I'd make it a 2/2 for 6. The druid staff is ridiculously undercosted. It's 1 mana more than an arcanite reaper and gives a much bigger bonus. I would suggest making it 7 or 8 mana.

customhearthstone,3c8pre,Kharaaz,2,Mon Jul 6 06:32:23 2015 UTC,I like it. But it should probably be a 2/2. Maybe even a 2/3. But probably a 2/2.
customhearthstone,3ca0b8,Burning_Titan,3,Mon Jul 6 07:07:48 2015 UTC,I like a lot of these cards but don't feel like writing detailed feedback.  The Rogue spell damage one is my favourite.
customhearthstone,3ca0b8,J-Factor,1 point,Mon Jul 6 09:39:49 2015 UTC,"Ty, but to be honest I should really learn that regardless of how happy I am with the cards this sub mostly upvotes pretty pictures. :/ That... and I should really post my ideas not at 4am."
customhearthstone,3ca0b8,J-Factor,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:09:07 2015 UTC,"And yes I am crazy in case you were wondering.  A few important notes:  Shaman cards.   Acts as card draw for shaman that interacts with totems. Overall just a good card for aggro shaman.   Priest.   A solid removal that often won't kill what you use it on, but does weaken the minion enough to allow your hero power to get full use. Yes it takes no damage from 2 attack minions.   Hunter.   It is designed for Dragonhawk + Tundra Rhino combos. Acts as control hunter removal.   Paladin.   Decent card that's good for buff decks. Hilarious 1-of in heavy secret decks.   Mage.   Giants mage card for mass taunts, and the frozen effects stays with the minions next turn as well (as is the norm). Another minion that works for secret heavy decks.   Warlock.   If the minion dies on your opponents turn then you have 1 turn to use the spectre and get a lot of value, but you don't get any deathrattle bonus on your own turn without some silence. Late game card that passivly summons 2/2's.   Rogue.   Control rogue card for removal combos. Likely slightly too strong, but it's also really good for control Rogue.   Warrior.   Face/Pirate warrior synergy. If the murloc has already attacked, attacking with your hero does make the murloc attack again regardless of attacking already. Making it good for face/murloc warrior.   Druid.   Really good with +attack bonus spells. Good for both Malygos, Hobgoblin decks, and general decks I believe.   Neutral.   Buff priest/paladin card. Really solid pirate minion to enable pirate decks. It's even good in non-pirate decks. MAGMA RAGER DECKS. Great houndmaster target for a more controlly hunter, and good for beast druid. Rarely useful, but has interesting interactions with boards that already have taunt minions and black knight. A great card for beast hunter or druid. It is usually a 3/5, except it kills 1 health minions before the fight even takes place. Murloc card draw. Might be too strong. Interesting way to have a minion that you can hold in control matchups to produce giants later in the game. Could be hilarious in Echo mage decks. Possibly too strong (maybe +3/3 is better). An excellent mid-range pirate legendary for dealing with the enemy board. If you have 8 secrets in play, you get 8 secrets. I hope this is good/fun enough to make more secret heavy decks viable (instead of just as many work with mad scientist). A legendary minion for trading into a lost board, but if you play it at the wrong time you actually just lose. Sounds crazy, but remember that this is a dead card until you have already played a 9 mana minion, and you have to many late game minions to make this card have any potential at all. However if you do pull off the dream, you can summon a board of legendary dragons.   An addition to this I will suggest some Card Changes.  Big Game Hunter - Battlecry attack theshold increased from 7 to 8  So it will no longer be in every deck and enabled people to play some of the never used 7 attack minions like Earth Elemental.  Dr. Boom - Boombots deathrattle damage changed from 1-4 to 2, Changed from a 7/7 to a 7/6  Everyone agrees its too strong, though partially due to the lack of 7 drops.  Mad Scientist - Changed from a 2/2 to a 2/1  Nerfing it's ability in aggro decks, so you can now ping it like a much more powerful Loot Hoarder.  Battle Rage - No longer draws from damaged heroes, now reads ""Draw a card for each damaged friendly minion.""  1-less card draw per use for Patron Warrior, the decks will still be very strong, and they will likely substitute in an extra card draw minion/spell.  And some Quests.  Out of the frying pan (hidden/1 time only)  - Reach rank 20 on the ladder. Grants a normal card pack.  We're getting somewhere (hidden/1 time only)  - Reach rank 15 on the ladder. Grants a normal card pack.  Half way there! (hidden/1 time only)  - Reach rank 5 on the ladder. Grants a normal card pack.  Nearly there! (hidden/1 time only)  - Reach rank 5 on the ladder. Grants a normal card pack.  Legendary! (hidden/1 time only) - Reach legendary on the ladder. Grants a normal card pack.  I added a bunch of quests to add some reward for climbing the ladder, and it provides some free packs to new players.  Finally some Ranked Changes.  The amount of stars gained at the end of the season increased by 5 for players past rank 20. The old table for reference.  Win streaks stars are now separated into the following. 1 win in a row = 1 + 0 stars, 2 wins in a row = 1 + 1 stars, 3 wins in a row = 1 + 2 stars.  Win streaks are no longer entirely cancelled by losses. Each loss now reduces your win streak bonus stars by 1 each time you lose (a reverse effect from the above).  So basically you are less likely to fall into the rank 20-25 range (you'll have slightly more stars in general), and your win/loss ratio will have more of an effect on your ability to rise in ranks, rather than having win streak bursts."
customhearthstone,3c72t9,junkerboat,5,Sun Jul 5 14:04:26 2015 UTC,"This combined with Antique Healbot would be the bane of aggro, and you can draw 1 more card with Azure Drake or maybe even Novice Engineer. I really like it!"

customhearthstone,3c72t9,dunkeater,5,Sun Jul 5 19:04:19 2015 UTC,"I love this card design. It makes Azure Drake and Antique Healbot even stronger, without being an imbalanced combo.  It would also open new deck strategies - makes another Echoing Ooze copy, can change Divine Shield into buffs with charge for Blood Knight, and Enhance-o Mechano makes Priest Zoo viable (maybe)."
customhearthstone,3c72t9,mazurecki56,6,Sun Jul 5 19:40:39 2015 UTC,"A bit overpowered. Draw usually costs 1,5-2 mana for a card, and here we have also an additional effect."

customhearthstone,3c72t9,Alejsgo,1 point,Sun Jul 5 19:38:42 2015 UTC,Whenever I see a custom card I ask the same question. How does this card compare with existing cards? Does shadowstep or brewmaster fill a similar role?
customhearthstone,3c72t9,Apology,1 point,Mon Jul 6 00:14:29 2015 UTC,"I'd say its different enough to earn its spot. Priests don't get Shadowstep for one, and this card is pretty far removed from Brewmaster. Brewmaster is 3 mana and requires you to play the card again--you get a full heal from it sure, but Priest is less likely to need or want that than any other class (its actually bad if they're looking for Northshire draw or Lightwarden buff), and it costs the mana cost of the card--it makes plays Brewmaster-Nefarian or other 8 mana battlecries imposisble in one turn, or otherwise sucks up your mana. Awakening is cheap and easy, and would find more use in Priest decks.  That said, I'm still not sure what would be taken out for it. Priest doesn't run too many battlecry minions--Cabal would be by far the most powerful, but the last thing Priest needs is yet more combos. As it stands, the only Battlecries Priest currently run are Blademaster, which would be negative synergy, Cabal Shadow Priest, and Shrinkmaster.   All in all, it really fits in with Priest in that it would be really when it worked, but the vast majority of the time it's a dead draw as you wait for the rest of the pieces or struggle for board control."
customhearthstone,3c72t9,TheMonji,1 point,Sun Jul 5 21:51:52 2015 UTC,"Awesome card.   If you allowed it to be used on your opponent's minions, it could work great on minions like Injured Blademaster.  ...and using it on your opponent's Doomguard is unbelievably OP. In fact, that alone might make it worth limiting this card to only your own minions"
customhearthstone,3c72t9,thermiter36,1 point,Mon Jul 6 21:06:52 2015 UTC,This would be ridiculous against Demons.  I love it.
customhearthstone,3c9265,lynbeaut,2,Mon Jul 6 01:08:15 2015 UTC,What if you're Jaraxxus or Ragnaros? I like the idea of a card that does something different depending on your hero but I think balancing would be a headache. Cool idea nonetheless.
customhearthstone,3c9265,WarTowel,1 point,Mon Jul 6 04:23:01 2015 UTC,"Then it just puts those cards into your deck, and leaves you with a Doppleganger of them. (ie: their portrait with 20 Health, and Stealth and the same damage ability as any other doppleganger). Ragnaros and Jaraxxus are already cards. So it would just give you them.  Thanks for the comment though! :)"
customhearthstone,3c9265,zuckerthoben,1 point,Mon Jul 6 06:09:21 2015 UTC,I explained most of the cards / my thought process behind them in the description of them in the album.

customhearthstone,3c932s,psycho-logical,0,Mon Jul 6 16:34:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I still understood it. I just think your current formatting gives them Freeze as an ability as opposed to doing what you want (Frost Nova'ing them).  Cool card, but the RNG would cause people on both sides to rage haha."
customhearthstone,3c89vb,Audiencefone,3,Sun Jul 5 20:53:58 2015 UTC,"Acolyte of sins is quite strong, even if the effect is temporary, it would be auto run in most zoolock, maybe even handlocks."
customhearthstone,3c89vb,Equ1n0x99,4,Sun Jul 5 22:10:30 2015 UTC,"I know. It's a bit of a struggle to balance.  Comparing it to Novice Engineer (1/1 for 2, draw a card), it's strictly better, aside from the 2 damage you deal to yourself, and it's not straight card-draw (so you can't get a card from the effect, then hero power). I really think Novice Engineer i underpowered, and class cards are usually a little better, so I'm okay with this.  Comparing it to Mad Scientist, a 2/2 for 2 which gets you a 3-mana card played for free when it dies, it's a little worse, since it doesn't play anything FOR you, and you take 2 damage. That said, I think Mad scientist is OP.  I could make the Acolyte a 2/1, but then I feel like the 2 damage you deal to yourself isn't quite as worthwhile. Still debating this one. If you have comments on this, let me know, as I'm still in debate about it."
customhearthstone,3c89vb,dunkeater,1 point,Sun Jul 5 22:45:39 2015 UTC,I think it's good as a 2/2.

Or is this too lengthy?"
customhearthstone,3c89vb,diocletian4316,1 point,Mon Jul 6 12:39:39 2015 UTC,"It seems both a bit lengthy and not terribly advantageous.

The shields would activate and the spell wouldn't matter. It still goes off. The player can then deal with the shields as they like. Removing it from the hero shouldn't be much trouble, as it has no inherent attack value.  However, it is very good. I may reword it so that only minions gain the shield. Leave the hero open. Definitely considering it."
customhearthstone,3c89vb,vfkaza,1 point,Mon Jul 6 01:12:27 2015 UTC,"The problem with new Paladin secrets is the fact that no existing Paladin secrets are run.  The moment you see a Paladin secret, you'd know it was Divine Spirit and be able to play around it."

customhearthstone,3c9z5j,Equ1n0x99,1 point,Mon Jul 6 13:41:48 2015 UTC,this card has good stats for its cost which makes it good already.  its effect is a bit situational I see this as a direct counter to face hunter if they ignore it but this card is very good other wise. On a scale of 1/10 I give it a 8 as his stats are good and so is the effect this could be played in a lot of decks

customhearthstone,3c7g39,platypoo2345,2,Sun Jul 5 17:44:10 2015 UTC,"I think this is quite well balanced as it takes you to 15 hp and you basically do nothing with your turn. However, I personally am not really a fan of passive hero powers. I would suggest making the card it self cost 8 mana and then the hero powers cost 2 each. I also disagree with you that the hero powers are too good. I dont think they are good enough for anyone to justify running this card. compared with jaraxxus, who makes a 6/6 every turn, many of them seem poor. I would have fire deal 2-5 damage, water deal 5 damage and freeze, earth summon a 5/5 with taunt, and air give +2 attack, windfury and being able to bypass taunt."
customhearthstone,3c7g39,Im_a_hearthstoner,2,Sun Jul 5 18:39:39 2015 UTC,"I agree with the other commenters.  This is a really cool concept, to give Shaman a late game transformation a la Jaraxxus, but the passive hero powers can't really stay.  Simply making them 2 mana like other hero powers is probably enough to balance them."

Also, I don't feel like ""bypass taunt"" is a good effect to have in the game at all, Minions like ogre combat this in a more random and interesting way."
customhearthstone,3c8ert,davidg61,1 point,Mon Jul 6 21:58:28 2015 UTC,"On turn 10, 8-mana prevents how many commonly played minions from being played? Mal'Ganis, Malygos, Jaraxxas and Alexstraza are most common late game minions played that are over 8 mana.  However, those cards see very little play outside of very specific decks that aren't common in the meta.  'Can bypass taunt' is there for a few reasons.   One, it is true to the lore of air elementals. They can bypass armor and other obstacles due to their nature and ranged attacks.   Two, having to facetank a damage source twice is not something that can be done when capped at 15 health.  (Compare to Jaraxas where he can use a 6/6 to kill a taunt and rarely has to facetank damage as a result.)  Three, the water ascendant deals 4 damage and freezes a target. That ability can bypass taunt as it is not the hero attacking. The air ascendant only deals 6 damage, however that costs 2 durability to do. The water ascendant also deals 6 damage with the weapon, but only 4 is able to bypass taunt, but it has a freeze in addition to that.  When compared to the water ascendant, the air ascendant isn't that overpowered. The only thing that makes it strong is the fact that it can be used with Rockbiter Weapon. I admit that Rockbiter was an oversight. However Rockbiter can be used with Doom Hammer before Elemental Ascendance is cast. (10 and 12 damage isn't a huge difference. Also Al'Akir can be used to deal 12 damage, so Rockbiter isn't really an issue.)  If people really think these things are way too op, the durability on the weapon can be reduced to 4 or the 'Can bypass taunt' can be changed to 'Immune while attacking.' (Just +1 Attack and Windfury is not strong enough to be a hero power for the air ascendant.) I think that the former is the most logical solution."

Also, Ahune + Frost Nova isn't 100% game winning against opponent's without spells because they can still play more minions.  Although in most cases, your opponent will have a spell that can deal with him. Actually, requiring two spells on average, but that's almost still a 2 for 2."

Conceived as slight anti-freeze tech; it's a little different from normal tech, though.  Rather than having a huge reward if it hits, it just has a 'use-case' for when it doesn't.  The two choices are 'opposites' so that it's more generally useful (this is how most choose-ones are - they have an option that's ""always"" useful, like dealing 2 damage or drawing 2 cards, and an option that's situationally useful, like healing or silencing).  At the very least, you can always freeze the enemy's face.  Typically, though, I think you run this as anti-freeze mage tech - slip one into your deck if freeze mage is dominating the meta, and hope to hit a big board frozen by frost nova/blizzard/etc.  And if all else fails, it's at least a big body.  It's fairly overstatted - probably a little too much, but it's intentionally strong for what it does because it's a class card with a pretty narrow use case; I'm just hoping to expand the use-case a little bit by making the body better.

This is... an update to an old, very broken card I made (probably close to the first card I made, actually) that worked on any character.  The obvious problem was the already-existing frostbolt+ice lance+ice lance combo turned into a 23 damage combo with that card - face damage was way too consistent.  I designed it pre-Thaurissan, so I figured giving it a mana cost of 7 or 8 would prevent that - but then it starts competing with Malygos.  In a post-Thaurissan world, I don't think the card works at all.  So this card came about.  ""After you cast a spell on a minion, cast Ice Lance on that minion.""  Straightforward enough; usually, it means your spells also freeze the target; but if your spell already freezes (or you cast multiple spells on that same target), you deal damage to it instead.  Note that it uses similar wording to Spellbender, and so has similar activation requirements; it only triggers on targeted spells (so - won't freeze Flamecannon targets, and won't murder a Blizzarded board).  In my head, it doesn't benefit from Spell Damage, nor does it proc Gadgetzan Auctioneer and other 'on-spell cast' effects with its Ice Lance.  I'd be willing to discuss this, but it feels to me that having this card play a spell is to you playing a spell, as summoning a minion is to playing it - sort of in the same way that Mad Scientist doesn't proc Gadgetzan (though Mad Scientist's card text makes it clear that it won't, I think).  It pays one stat point for the effect, so it becomes 'worthwhile' even at one proc.  Generally, though, I think these ice lances aren't quite worth '1 mana' - since the best use case for ice lance is to the enemy's face, I sort of value these minion ice lances at somewhere between 0 and 1 mana.  The card is still pretty strong, though.  Let me know what you think.  I'm pretty sure this card is... strong.  I could see it costing an extra mana and still being pretty good.  Hard to say without playtesting.  It's got a spot in Freeze Mage, control mage, and probably spare part/mech(?)/tempo mage - it's pretty versatile."

Compared to Shade, you have to pay 3 mana to begin the infinite scaling and your opponenth as a chance to deal with it before it spirals out of control. With Aimed Shot, there's no way for your opponent to play around it, and one turn they may suddenly be hit with a 4 mana 8 damage spell. I don't see anyway to balance the effect honestly. As a side note, the wording is a bit misleading, it implies that you deal 0 damage to a target, then at the end of your turn, you deal 1 damage to them. I would change the wording to be ""Deal 0 damage. At the end of your turn, increase this damage by 1""  My suggestion for aimed shot would be something different, like; ""Deal 1 damage. At the end of your turn, out this card in your hand and increase the damage by 1."" This way you have to pay the mana to get the damage out and scale the damage up. Nt sure on mana cost, but that's the general idea.   As for Pickpocket, stealing the coin would be useless in 50% of your games and isn't even that useful even if you manage to pull it off, so the combo would have to do something worthwhile. However, a coin interaction could work, something like ""put a coin in your hand for each card in your opponent's hand."" I don't have any good ideas, but manipulating your opponent's resources isn't something the card should do."
customhearthstone,3c5mui,nutshells,2,Sun Jul 5 10:27:03 2015 UTC,"Frost Nova is a mage card. Druids have very little removal, and it would be a good card to end the game with. If you have a board and you use this card, you can hit face and he will need to use cards in his hand to remove your minions. If he doesn't, you have a set-up for savage roar. It stalls the game for a turn which druids could really use. I think 8 mana is a bit too much, but putting it around 5-6 would be okay, just because of how good a card like this would be for the class."
customhearthstone,3c5mui,MFA-12151,3,Sun Jul 5 10:27:56 2015 UTC,Really great art selection in this set.
customhearthstone,3c5mui,ME24saken,2,Sun Jul 5 04:30:29 2015 UTC,"Focussed Will - I'm assuming this reduces damage per attack. If that's the case, it'll be a great card, but you do need to mention that in the text.    Nether Vision - Love it! Always a fan of deck altering cards. Seems balanced as well.    Thrall's Fury - Interesting card. The obvious comparison is Crush which currently doesn't see play because there are often better alternatives at hand. I think that might be the case for this card too as Shaman's problem has never been removal. However, you can cheat it's cost pretty far down as it takes both locked as unlocked Overloaded crystals. It definitely could see play in decks with Earth Elemental (6 mana, summon a 7/8 with Taunt and destroy a minion, Overload 3).  Heroic Leap - If I understand this correctly, it's a cost reduction card, but it is worded very awkwardly. I also don't know if being able to chose your own target is balanced compared to Ancestral Call.    Entangling Roots - Already mentioned: should be a 4 mana card to compare with Frost Nova.    Bottled Knowledge - Love the idea, but not the balancing. Your opponent will never know you drew and transformed this. That makes it very hard to play around it, especially with the cost reduction. If you want to keep the reduction, I think you should make it an on-play effect and if you want to keep it an in-hand effect, you should remove the reduction. Transforming it in a Mage only spell could also be a way to balance it.    Aimed Shot - As it's currently worded, it does 0 damage to a character and then does another 1 damage at the end of your turn to the same target. That is interesting because it double dips from Spell Damage (Malygos + this = 11 damage), but it's obviously not worth 4 mana. From the comments, it seems that you want it to be a Bolvar-like effect. In that case it should be worded: ""Deal 0 damage. At the end of your turn, while this is in your hand, gain 1 damage."" This effect can get insanely stupid as there is no counter play, but it's also very slow, which makes it fine in Hunter.    Pick Pocket - A) this is really weak. You spend 4 mana and a card and don't get any card- or tempo value. B) This is what Blizzard finds to be 'un-fun'. Outright removing resources is a big no-no.    Divine Protection - Seems fair. Might make it 2 mana as Hand of Protection is already 1 mana. You could argue that giving Divine Shield to your hero is weaker than giving it to a minion, though, but I don't think it's much weaker since the Paladin can pop it himself with weapons. Too cheap draw might make Paladin a bit OP."
customhearthstone,3c5mui,BetterThanTofu,4,Sun Jul 5 13:07:52 2015 UTC,I don't understand Aimed Shot
customhearthstone,3c5mui,hoorahforsnakes,7,Sun Jul 5 01:13:14 2015 UTC,At the end of turn it will deal 1 more damage. You will be able to see how much since the 0 will become -> * 1 * -> * 2 * ...  The spell has to be in your hand for the effect to trigger.  Hope this helps.
customhearthstone,3c5mui,Godunderscor,3,Sun Jul 5 01:28:48 2015 UTC,"As it is a spell, the way it is worded(at the end of the turn) means that it will only do 1 damage then stop."
customhearthstone,3c5mui,BonomDenej,2,Sun Jul 5 11:59:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah, this doesn't make much sense. In Hearthstone, encapsulating numbers in parentheses notes mana cost. Example  Also, there's no text here to indicate these effects start scaling while sitting in your hand. Without it, they're impossible to parse."
customhearthstone,3c5mui,Stalor5,2,Sun Jul 5 21:55:46 2015 UTC,"You should add a ""While this is in your hand"" somewhere in the text."
customhearthstone,3c5mui,hoorahforsnakes,2,Sun Jul 5 07:06:51 2015 UTC,"I don't really understand the Heroic Leap spell, does it mean to your opponent, or is there something that in not seeing."
customhearthstone,3c5mui,Godunderscor,3,Sun Jul 5 06:05:48 2015 UTC,"I believe it is meant to be like ancestor's call, where you can use it to cheat out expensive minions"
customhearthstone,3c5mui,Clauskurausu,3,Sun Jul 5 12:02:17 2015 UTC,"Yep. So if you, on turn 3, coin out Heroic leap into Sneeds, you will take 8 + 5 = 13 damage."
customhearthstone,3c5mui,12_Digit_Number,1 point,Sun Jul 5 13:50:42 2015 UTC,"These are... weird.  Going down the line,    Focused Will - I'm assuming this thing scales each turn, so on turn 10 you basically ignore 20 damage for 1 mana. It's better than a secret, it's better than having more health. It's simply ignore a bunch of stuff with no interaction for 1 mana. This would make control decks absolutely insane, and that's Priest's forte. It doesn't mean they can't annihilate your board, but it forces your opponent to stagnate a turn. Even if used earlier, like against Face Hunter, on turn 3 it's 1 mana ignore 6. That's essentially an extra turn. I understand there's a downside that you have to have drawn it, but once you have there's no pressure to use it except when it makes the most value. Nether Vision - This card not only makes 3 random demons and adds them to your deck, meaning you could have an overabundance of really quality demons, but also doesn't impose any penalty on you for drawing them. Essentially, ""Add 3 demons to your deck. They cycle when you draw them."" That's much too good for 4 mana. Gang Up costs 2, gives only limited control, and imposes a draw cost. Thrall's Fury - The Overload scaling is wonky here, also Destroy isn't Shaman's thing. Having this at 7 mana is cool, but then you get double every Overloaded mana crystal as cost-reduction. Seems very tempo-y but overall one of the more reasonable ones. Heroic Leap - I'm guessing this acts like Ancestor's Call from Shaman and plays something from your Hand. At 4 mana, that would be unreasonble, but this makes it deal both Cost and Attack. So even big drops like Grommash are smacking you for 12. A strong effect, but the drawbacks seem on point, if not the wording. Entangling Roots - Pretty overcosted, which is surprising. It's a blanket Frost Nova that also covers cards with Charge, which ain't nothing. It helps that Druid is the king of big drops and late game, so this could be significant. But it's definitely too expensive. Bottled Knowledge - There's sort of a theme with your cards and the Hand. Seems unnecessary here. If this card was 0 mana, ""Add a random spell, it costs (2) less"" that would work just fine. Given this is in your hand, it denies your opponent knowledge, but that's not bad. What is is it's a random spell, from any class. RNG is already the least fun part of this game, and without even having a 'whiff"" state like Unstable Portal(spending 2 mana and drawing something that costs less) - which is a minor drawback all things told - this just seems too good. Aimed Shot - The wording here is, again, hard to parse. As I understand it, it scales up 1 damage for each turn it sits in your hand. I like this one a lot, now that I know what it is. It's way too strong and a card you simply never feel bad playing, but it's an interesting mechanic that only works in certain decks. That said, I think it should cost a little more but start at 1 damage. Pick Pocket - The ""this turn"" text is unnecessary. At the start of your turn you'll draw, and this won't interact with that step; or I'm assuming it won't, given it has a stated mana cost. Going off the assumption that this is 4 mana ""Draw a card from your opponent's deck"", you're spending 4 mana to outright steal a card from your opponent. Not only is that sort of mechanic more in flavor with Priest, taking stuff out of your opponent's deck is stupid powerful. Draw a card is costed at about 1.5 mana - usually being attached to some other effect. This not only doesn't have the drawback of not milling yourself faster, but mills your opponent - an effect that isn't done except with Fel Reaver, which they have to knowingly put in their deck. Divine Protection - Speaking of Draw a Card. This is busted. 1 mana draw is too cheap by itself, and 1 mana Draw give your Hero Divine Shield is definitely a 3 mana card, 2 at the least. Against some classes, this is good; against others, it's really good. Dedicating 1 damage isn't always easy. And even when it is, for Mage, Druid, Paladin, Rogue and Hunter, it's still costing them 2 mana to deal with. Essentially, this is always a 2 for 1."
customhearthstone,3c5mui,12_Digit_Number,0,Sun Jul 5 22:17:51 2015 UTC,Wouldn't Light of the Naaru be better than Focused Will unless you're at 30 health?   Is Bottled Knowledge just transform into another 0-cost spell?
customhearthstone,3c5mui,hoorahforsnakes,0,Sun Jul 5 02:36:33 2015 UTC,"Gotta say, Thrall's fury is basically always gonna be a 7 mana card. (Cost of card + overload will always equal 7.) I don't think there's a way to manipulate overload into letting you play it before then unless you over-overload with like four dust devils. Seems overpriced given that assassinate is 5.

customhearthstone,3c5ckg,Deathice94,0,Sun Jul 5 10:18:44 2015 UTC,"Way too punishing? 4 mana 3/8 that you're more than likely going to get out without any drawback? Honestly, this should cost more mana, with a bigger body, so it's drawback might actually come into play."

customhearthstone,3c41t7,Killer4free,15,Sat Jul 4 15:54:32 2015 UTC,"so a 1-cost insta-removal? seems ridiculously OP doesn't it? maybe give it a random element? or impose some kind of limit (destroy an exhausted minion with less than 5 health)? maybe make it deal damage instead of hard-removal? or just increase the cost (to at least BGH levels, I would consider them both at the same level)"
customhearthstone,3c41t7,bentheiii,4,Sat Jul 4 17:03:36 2015 UTC,"Warrior has 1 cost insta removal, they have to make sure it's damaged though, this has a similar caveat, you have to have it the turn that the minion was played otherwise the minion won't be destroyed.  It's a card that is extremely situational and would be a tech card instead of the insta-include."
customhearthstone,3c41t7,Hanxse,12,Sat Jul 4 18:50:06 2015 UTC,It's not a similar caveat. Making sure they're damaged requires another card to be used. You have to have played something else in order to use execute. You can just kill any non-charge minion of your choice with this for 1-mana and one card.
customhearthstone,3c41t7,Greybear93,9,Sat Jul 4 19:41:01 2015 UTC,"Doesn't ""exhausted"" status end when a turn ends? So you'd only be able to use this on minions summoned by things like Mirror Image or Deathrattle summons.  If you mean it to be usable on any non-charge minion summoned by your enemy on last turn, that's just ridiculously good. 1 mana removal with no draw back. Most of the time you spend your removal right after the threatening minion is played anyway."
customhearthstone,3c41t7,Blarpigoomba,2,Sat Jul 4 18:32:32 2015 UTC,Yeah the status is removed at the end of your turn making this card only able to kill your own minions.

customhearthstone,3c41t7,Fenastus,12,Sat Jul 4 15:57:01 2015 UTC,"2 mana unplayable? It's an insta-removal with a very common condition, the tempo swing this thing could give would be immense   I would personally make it 3"
customhearthstone,3c41t7,Godunderscor,5,Sat Jul 4 18:49:43 2015 UTC,3 sounds pretty fair.  3 mana compares well against Hunter's Deadly Shot. Both are removal with drawbacks about when you can play them. With Deadly it's less hard and fast - if the opponent has a board you can always take a chance - but most people go for removing stuff.
customhearthstone,3c41t7,jaypenn3,2,Sat Jul 4 19:59:23 2015 UTC,"exhaust only applies the turn it's played, meaning this can only kill minions you just played."
customhearthstone,3c41t7,Fenastus,1 point,Sun Jul 5 04:48:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but when do you typically play assassinate? The turn after the big ass minion was played or 3 turns in when it's already gotten value from killing creatures or doing damage to face?"
customhearthstone,3c41t7,jaypenn3,3,Sun Jul 5 05:03:45 2015 UTC,"No I'm saying that when an enemy plays their big minion, it is only exhausted on their turn, so it is impossible to use this on a minion the enemy summoned. The only way you can use this on the opposite side of the board is against what comes out of a shredder or a voidcaller after you kill them, or something like that."
customhearthstone,3c41t7,MichaelGMorgillo,3,Sun Jul 5 05:21:29 2015 UTC,"Oh, for crying out loud, let me make something perfectly clear:  The ""Exhausted"" effect, that thing with the zzzz's, lasts from the turn a minion is summoned until the end of turn. So any minions you play that don't have charge stop being exhausted the instant you push the ""End Turn"" button. Same thing goes for your opponents minions, any minions they play, stop being exhausted the moment your turn starts.  So what does that mean for this card? Simple, this card is a 1 mana removal, yes, but it only works for minions that your opponent can summon on your turn.  There are exactly 2 ways this can currently happen: Deathrattles (Sledge Belcher, Sneed's, Deathlord etc.) or Spells (Mirror Entity, and Repentence). The limiting factor here is that it this card can only kill minions spawned from either of those two scenarios.   To that end, I think this card is fine. 90% of the time this could end up being a wasted and useless card, as it's a lot more situational than Execute, the most direct comparison. But because its more powerful than Execute in those scenarios, it's fine. Frankly this could cost 0 mana, and I would still be fine with it, because the options you have for properly using this are so small, that this effect for that low of a cost, is perfectly reasonable to me."

I made the card to make Claw and maybe Bite a little more playable, so I think that if a Rogue version of the effect were to be implemented, it might be a little strong since cards like Deadly Poison/Tinker's are already strong by themselves.

customhearthstone,3c3kbr,psycho-logical,2,Sun Jul 5 04:07:57 2015 UTC,"You can actually make this a reasonable amount more powerful rather than less powerful. Secrets normally get extra value,  especially with slightly dificult activation goals."
customhearthstone,3c3kbr,estafan7,2,Sat Jul 4 22:45:04 2015 UTC,"The card is situational, so it should be powerful.   Something like, ""If your opponent would draw extra cards this turn, you draw them instead."""
customhearthstone,3c3kbr,psycho-logical,1 point,Sat Jul 4 20:13:42 2015 UTC,"That is way too powerful for 3 mana, especially if you played it off of Mad Scientist. It is like a counterspell that draws you cards if they play a draw spell. Also any minion that has a draw card effect is essentially game losing. If an opponent plays an Ancient of Lore and tries to draw, it is a 4 card swing in card advantage for 3 mana and they had to play a 7 mana 5/5 instead of something else. Sprint is an 8 card swing and a 4 mana advantage. There is also very little counter play to this version of the secret."
customhearthstone,3c3kbr,squiddybiscuit,1 point,Sun Jul 5 01:30:16 2015 UTC,"It does nothing against a number of decks and acts more as a Kezan Mystic type effect. If it steals a single card draw it is far from OP.  If a Rogue casts Sprint into this before Shiv, Fan of Knives, Azure Drake etc... they kinda deserve to lose."
customhearthstone,3c4gwn,Bluecone,11,Sat Jul 4 18:13:45 2015 UTC,This is just a worse Blade Flurry. Should be 0 mana IMO
customhearthstone,3c4gwn,Scyion,1 point,Sat Jul 4 18:19:41 2015 UTC,"I think you are missing the more important point that this is more of another activator for many of warriors cards that require an AoE activator like Frothing Berserker, Armorsmith, Patron, and Acolyte. Using this with a Death's Bite allows more fringe case plays to be made. Also, warrior does not need a strong card like Blade Flurry so I would not compare across classes like that. Rogue was hurt bad with the nerf to Gadgetzan and Tinker's Oil helped fix that by buffing Blade Flurry."
customhearthstone,3c4gwn,jiccadilly,1 point,Sun Jul 5 04:34:21 2015 UTC,So it costs 2 mana just because of death's bite?
customhearthstone,3c4gwn,Equ1n0x99,2,Sun Jul 5 15:08:48 2015 UTC,This spell let's you essentially attack twice with weapons in one turn. It can also be used to activate a Death's Bite Deathrattle early if you need it.  Was considering adding a weakening effect to it per the actual ability but couldn't figure out how to make it work right.
customhearthstone,3c4gwn,RushSt182,2,Sat Jul 4 18:16:35 2015 UTC,"Since you're destroying your weapon this should probs be 1 mana 2 might be asking for a bit much, but idk."
customhearthstone,3c4gwn,vanasbry000,2,Sat Jul 4 20:41:31 2015 UTC,"This would actually be quite fitting for Warrior. Not only does it make sense for the warrior class but it would also be the equivalent of a worse version of a different class' card, just like Mortal Strike to Fireball. :P"
customhearthstone,3c4gwn,Killer4free,2,Sat Jul 4 18:59:43 2015 UTC,"It's really weak currently, but I could see it having a spot if it put a weapon from your deck into your hand. That way, an aggro warrior would be more comfortable running extra weapons, as this card would let them get through more durability faster. In addition, it would cycle into a weapon if you don't have one. Might not work (my logic seems flawed), but a class card seeks to either alter a currently used tool or encourage some unused aspect of the class."
