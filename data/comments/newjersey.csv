The right to freedom of religion includes the right to not believe any religion, and freedom of speech  includes the right to NOT speak.  The right to freedom of association must also by extension include the right to disassociation. Whether the reason is sane, innocuous or batshit crazy is irrelevant to that right.  The problem with this is not that ignorant people hate others for superficial reasons, it is when laws are passed that enforce that separation, as in the US during the era of Jim Crow and the Black Codes, when minorities were prevented by law from living where they wanted, working where they wanted, or opening businesses to compete against majority-owned businesses.  Where free people are allowed to react to stupidity, like refusing to serve others based on superficial reasons, those free people will largely flock to more tolerant businesses, and more tolerant businesses will open or advertise their difference from the idiots."

The lines that NJT owns were replaced in the 80s and 90s and are tensioned.     So those lines rarely have issues...    The New England section of the NEC uses Constant Tension Catenary and by 2025 the whole New Haven line and Hell Gate line will have there wires replaced with Constant Tension Catenary.    Which leaves NJ , PA , DE , MD and DC to replace.    The Gateway Project will replace the wires from NYP to North Elizabeth.

There's really no alternative except to replace all the wires with stronger metal that is still conductive, yet heat resistant ($$$).

Gah, NJT running all diesels would be an even bigger disaster than it already is.  It's pretty easy math: a Diesel is about 3500HP to the tracks and 280,000 lbs.  An electric is about 7500HP to the tracks and 210,000 lbs.  As slow as NJT is now, with an all diesel system, it'd be a LOT slower.  Ever ride the MBTA's commuter rail up near Boston?  What NJT should have done 10 years ago is replaced the Arrow III MU fleet with a new one.  Actually, they put it out to bid, but Bombardier wasn't the lowest (winning) bidder, so they didn't award the contract. The Arrow IV's performance spec was pretty impressive - IIRC they were requiring Trenton locals to be able to run from Trenton to NYC in an hour.  There was even provisions for DMUs and dual mode MUs for non electric lines.  I might still have a copy of it somewhere, it was quite interesting."

A slow train is better than one that can't even move at all.    But again, they wouldn't really help cause they wouldn't be able to go underground into NY Penn anyway.

newjersey,3e0bwp,gordonv,2,Tue Jul 21 08:58:14 2015 UTC,I can feel how hot it is in there looking at this.
newjersey,3e0bwp,Uhrzeitlich,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:30:32 2015 UTC,Nothing is as hot as the Times Square 42nd st. Subway stop.  Particularly the stairwell that leads to/ from the N//Q/R trains to the ramp that leads to the bus terminal.  I am certain that tunnel actually cuts through hell.
newjersey,3e0bwp,gordonv,2,Tue Jul 21 17:37:12 2015 UTC,"the best part is that i didn't get an all clear email until like 12am, and then by 615 this morning, there were more delays."
newjersey,3e0bwp,storm2k,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:48:32 2015 UTC,I soooo do not miss taking the train.
newjersey,3e0bwp,sisko4,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:10:00 2015 UTC,"It's been a while since I was commuting, but if things haven't changed then when things like this happen the NJ Transit busses cross honor monthly train passes."

newjersey,3e2qnk,THE_some_guy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:40:12 2015 UTC,"Do you pay anything extra for NJM's Roadside Assistance?   I know this doesn't really answer your question, but I have needed to call AAA in the past and they are always fast, quick and easy.  One thing that is good about AAA is that AAA covers the person, not the vehicle, so if you are a passenger riding along with someone who gets a flat, whose car won't start or needs a tow, you can use AAA for their car.  You have to be present with the vehicle, of course.  You can also get AAA discounts on Hotels and travel, so factor that into your yearly membership."
newjersey,3e2qnk,jeepCK,2,Tue Jul 21 15:25:03 2015 UTC,"I don't pay anything extra for NJM's roadside assistance- it's included as part of the policy.  Their coverage includes rental cars, but I don't think it includes privately-owned vehicles where I'm a passenger (never realized AAA covered that scenario, so thanks for letting me know).  I haven't had such a good experience as you with AAA.  I've had to wait 2-3 hours just about every time I've called them, and one time they sent out someone who wasn't able to fix the problem, so I had to wait an additional couple of hours for a properly-equipped tow truck to arrive.  I've used AAA travel agent services before.  Most of the time when we travel we use credit card points for the hotels, so AAA discounts don't apply."
newjersey,3e2qnk,beta_pup,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:11:17 2015 UTC,"I have NJM insurance and dropped AAA temporarily figuring I'd save money. I would keep your AAA membership if you can.   I broke down on the Garden State Pkwy. I called NJM and was told to, if possible, move the car off the GSP because the tow truck service they use couldn't operate on the GSP. WTF?   Luckily, it was ""only"" the radiator, so we were able to drive the car in short spurts until we got off the parkway and found a parking lot on route 46.   I went back to AAA immediately. It's worth it just for the peace of mind."
newjersey,3e2qnk,4chan4incher,2,Tue Jul 21 16:10:24 2015 UTC,"Only NJTA or NJDOT can provide road service on the Parkway or Turnpike I believe.  I called AAA one time and they redirected me to one of those, I believe.  Fortunately I get a credit with AAA membership."
newjersey,3e2qnk,4chan4incher,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:15:47 2015 UTC,That's interesting to know.  The NJM roadside assistance claims that it will reimburse you up to $75 even if you don't arrange towing directly through them.  That same $75 is what they cover even when you do call them first.
newjersey,3e2u2x,becausewemust,4,Tue Jul 21 15:06:36 2015 UTC,its a little bit of a trip but Waywayanda has some pretty intense MTB trails and has a nice little beach and lake

newjersey,3e1bhe,hombre_lobo,4,Tue Jul 21 04:54:23 2015 UTC,Busted my Uber cherry from EWR last month.   Good service and communication.  Great platform.
newjersey,3e1bhe,bigmphan,3,Tue Jul 21 14:28:15 2015 UTC,No just ordered an uber for a colleague flying in from Florida. Theyre going from EWR to Whippany. You should be good.
newjersey,3e1bhe,Dundee17,2,Tue Jul 21 06:57:28 2015 UTC,"Great. Will be my first time using Uber, it will autodetect my location, correct? So the driver will find me on the correct terminal.   There are a lot cars waiting out there, how will I know who my driver is?   Do i have to tip?  Thanks"
newjersey,3e1bhe,lupitabaires,3,Tue Jul 21 12:43:25 2015 UTC,"No tip necessary, but you can if you want of course. In a crowded area, have the driver tell you the make of car or first letters of the plate. At EWR you can also wait by Door 4 of the pickup level*, for example, and tell the driver that.  *Just saw another poster said there are two levels. One level is drop off, the other is pickup. The signs are pretty clear, shouldn't be a problem."
newjersey,3e1bhe,brp,2,Tue Jul 21 13:07:22 2015 UTC,"The Uber app already gives you the full license plate, make/model/color of the car, and a selfie of the driver."
newjersey,3e1bhe,brp,2,Tue Jul 21 17:28:27 2015 UTC,"For EWR, since it is is so crazy, most of the time the driver will call your phone right away after accepting the fare to work out a pickup location.  Every driver I've had for a pickup at EWR just called you right away to work it out because of the craziness.  Typically they are in the know as well and will ask to pick you up at level 2 or 3 departures, and not the crazy mess that is level 1 arrivals."
newjersey,3e1bhe,jeepCK,2,Tue Jul 21 15:54:28 2015 UTC,"Just curious, how much did that cost?"
newjersey,3e1bhe,brp,2,Tue Jul 21 15:27:37 2015 UTC,"Can't comment on Whippany, but an Uber between EWR and Metuchen is typically $35 all-in each way.  The cab company around the corner from me is well over $60 each way."
newjersey,3e1bhe,jeepCK,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:29:37 2015 UTC,Gotcha.  I'm interested because I've seen normal livery companies advertise $149 each way from Morris County to EWR.
newjersey,3e1bhe,brp,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:26:44 2015 UTC,$149 each way from Whippany to EWR?  Really?  For 24 miles?  That fare would probably be $40-45 each way on Uber.
newjersey,3e1bhe,jeepCK,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:10:28 2015 UTC,"I am a little further west than Whippany, but yes.  They regularally advertise $149 to EWR from anywhere in Morris County.  Ridiculous.  No wonder Uber is taking off like crazy.  Thanks for the info."
newjersey,3e1bhe,cougasaurus,2,Tue Jul 21 20:22:54 2015 UTC,I've used it multiple times. They will call you to find out what level you're on. Very easy. 10/10 would recommend.
newjersey,3e1bhe,EasyGibson,2,Tue Jul 21 17:37:18 2015 UTC,That's if they're not already there waiting for you the second you call.  Uber is amazing.  Instant service at less than half the price of the yellow cabs.  I can't say enough good about Uber.  Used them to/from the airport half a dozen times this year.
newjersey,3e1bhe,cougasaurus,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:17:06 2015 UTC,"I use Uber probably 5-10 times a week. It was a godsend when they finally came to New Brunswick, where the cabs are notoriously shitty."
newjersey,3e1bhe,RudeTurnip,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:15:18 2015 UTC,"I've used it twice already and one of them was even a TLC-licensed driver. The only thing that is confusing is where to get picked up, since EWR has multiple levels and GPS can't tell the difference. So far, both of my drivers have picked me up on the second level."
newjersey,3e1bhe,RudeTurnip,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:04:23 2015 UTC,How did you communicate with the driver on which level to be picked up? Through the app or via phone? It will be my first time using Uber.   Thanks
newjersey,3e0wpb,4ndr0med4,3,Tue Jul 21 02:39:51 2015 UTC,Do people not? ;_; have I been abiding by a rule that no one follows?
newjersey,3e0wpb,bitchnumber24,2,Tue Jul 21 02:59:34 2015 UTC,Most drivers are sticklers for this rule.  I would think more people are following it than not.
newjersey,3e0wpb,shanes3t,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:56:22 2015 UTC,"I actually had a driver give me shit because I paid for a zone that was further than I was going. Damned if you do, damned if you don't."
newjersey,3e0wpb,G1az3d,2,Tue Jul 21 11:49:53 2015 UTC,"if they get rid of it, how do you set the payments equitably? here's an example. i used to ride the 114 in high school when i needed to get home before i had a license and i had something to do after school. i lived in bridgewater, in the first fare zone. the 114 is an interstate line that goes to the port authority. without fare zones, either i would get stuck paying through the roof for a short ride or the guy going to the port authority gets his ride super subsidized for a long distance trip. how do you account for that?"
newjersey,3e0wpb,storm2k,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:52:20 2015 UTC,"I think it would work better for local buses instead of express buses, like the 114.  I could probably take the train to my job and it would end up being cheaper than the bus."
newjersey,3e0wpb,storm2k,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:58:41 2015 UTC,"the trick is that buses like the 114 basically run as local buses throughout a chunk of somerset county before they hop on the highway and express into the city. you still have both, even if many commuters take the 117 (which is express) or go out to mountainside to make the trip on the 114 shorter."
newjersey,3e0wpb,Rexire,2,Tue Jul 21 14:10:57 2015 UTC,"I feel like people do, at least on my bus. The drivers definitely keep track (somehow) and it's simply not worth the risk of getting called out on if mid-trip by the driver (it has happened)"
