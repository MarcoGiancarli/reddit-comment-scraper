CrohnsDisease,3e2wkl,aid689,3,Tue Jul 21 18:01:55 2015 UTC,I never flew when I had my ileostomey.  I was afraid that they would have insisted on giving me a pat down. And then the ileostomey would come loose and I would smell like poop for the entire flight because I wouldn't be able to fix it properly.

I am always shocked at peoples complete and utter lack of social skills. Who just assumes someone is pregnant? Once, when I told someone I wasn't pregnant, she asked if I had a tumor!!!!   Because of this stupid belly bloating, I have invested in maternity clothing. It helped so much when I was in my last flare because it wasn't squeezing my poor belly.

CrohnsDisease,3e5bsp,PhantomSkyz,-1,Wed Jul 22 03:55:14 2015 UTC,"That's what happened to remicade for me. But since humira is made with human proteins and not rat proteins like remicade was. The chance of building up resistances or immunity to humira is pretty slim if not almost non existent. I'd suggest doing some of your own research too. Doctors know a lot, but they don't know everything. It's always good to learn for yourself. Especially when it comes to a disease like crohns"
CrohnsDisease,3e5bsp,squishpotato,2,Wed Jul 22 04:57:58 2015 UTC,"It is still entirely possible, and common to build up antibodies to Humira. Less than Remicade, yes, but it happens in the majority of patients who stop/miss even just a few doses."
CrohnsDisease,3e5bsp,Tigerfuyung,2,Wed Jul 22 07:01:17 2015 UTC,"Depends how your life changes when taking them. Best case scenario is that it stops your Erythema Nodosum and you dont get any major side effects. I took remicade for a while and had a severe allergic reaction, but the only side effect i could notice was that it thinned my hair. But my hair is back to normal since stopping. I did Humira for a year and I had no noticeable side effects. But it did nothing to my Crohns and I have been living like an ill hermit. Also with either of them your chances of getting sick go up. I got strep throat for the first time in my life a few months ago. I think it was from the Humira.   That being said, I recommend that you try either one. You never know how much your life could improve."

I feel like I am on a constant bowel prep for a scope. Or is all this normal considering I am not even a week post op yet?   I have been taking 6-12 mg of Loperamide (Imodium) every day to help with the bulking and frequency. This was on the advice of my surgeon. Even though it's over the counter, you should probably ask if it's ok to take so much for you.  Apart from that, I did watch what I ate quite a bit the first few years after my reversal. And to be honest I ate as little as possible. You will start to notice what foods work for you though. Personally, I stayed away from dairy. Potatoes were always safe.  I was advised to use fiber supplements like metamucil for bulk, but I found it just made me go more and caused irritation."

I had one so bad and kind of deep so it didn't have the tell tale signs of the gums getting larger or inflaming over any teeth, but it was some of the worst pain I ever felt.  I went to the dentist and they said they didn't see anything on the xray and it showed no signs of anything of that sort, but because I told them I was using cold packs and ice to stop the intense cold, the tooth must be dead since the cold didn't make it worse (no cold sensitivity is a serious sign of root death I guess).  They told me I had to lose the tooth or be in that extreme pain for the rest of my life. I told them they were idiots and can go rip some other guys teeth out. I knew what was happening in my mouth and they were ready to pull out my canine on one circumstantial bit of evidence (granted my other teeth are in serious disrepair due to unrelated instantaneous gag reflex to anything mint flavored). I almost let them do it since even tapping the tooth made me basically pass out. If I had better insurance and the money for a fake tooth, I probably could have been persuaded but I wasn't going to walk around with a hole in my face on a wrong diagnosis.  It was a horrific two weeks where nothing stopped the pulsing pain, could barely eat anything, sleep only came when I was 100% exhausted and my body just shut down and still had like 4 hours sleep max.

CrohnsDisease,3dzlun,UCgirl,4,Tue Jul 21 05:29:36 2015 UTC,Twenty to thirty percent of diagnosed UC individuals will lose their large bowel.  I think 85% of individuals with a Crohn's dx will have surgery to remove a small portion of bowel.    The fact that you are responding to medications is great.  You can have very minor disease for a very long time.  I had my diagnosis and just kept getting worse and worse despite taking the strongest medications.
CrohnsDisease,3dzlun,krabbsatan,2,Tue Jul 21 00:22:56 2015 UTC,85% sounds very high. Especially considering the advancement of biologics in the last decade. Do you have any sources for that? I'm not trying to be rude just curious (and perhaps a little frightened).

CrohnsDisease,3dzlun,Azafolk,2,Tue Jul 21 01:03:17 2015 UTC,"Hi, being in remission is a reason to start watching out what you are eating, not telling you to eat rice and chicken all the time but  you should definitely try to eat healthy (not too much dairy, gross food etc...) so you can higher your chances to stay in remission for a long time.   Surgery depends on how your disease is aggressive (and how it evolves), if medications are able to keep it sleeping you'll probably never need surgery"
CrohnsDisease,3dzlun,krabbsatan,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:16:32 2015 UTC,Regarding diet and weight:  I also lost about 12kg when I got sick. I not sure how but something changed for me when I got sick and I could no longer tolerate dairy. It took me 2 years of constant diarrhea to figure this out. Once I stopped eating dairy my condition improved immensely.  I have gained that weight and muscle back now. About a year ago I started drinking 1000 calorie shakes for breakfast and lifting weights 2-4 times per week. It was rough at first (low energy) but once I started to see results it was very motivational and made me very happy. I started to feel like my old self again.  So if your meds have started working I would recommend you to look at a rough calculation of how many calories you're currently getting per day. And how much you would need to gain weight.  Also try cutting out dairy for a week and see how that feels. Then try cutting grains. It doesn't hurt to try.  If you get a really bad stomach one day try to write down what you ate the day before or in the morning. Perhaps you will notice a pattern.  Diet is very individual and perhaps you might not need to adjust at all

I've had crohn's for 3 years (diagnosed for 1) and my symptoms are no where near as severe as most that post/comment. The prescriptions work for me but I worry sometimes that I'll end up going down hill.  You will probably find some foods that'll set your gut off. For me, it's wholemeal bread (bye bye Italian herb and cheese subs for me), popcorn and leafy greens like spinach or rocket. Basically anything that isn't too easy to break down but it's different for everyone. Eat whatever you like and identify when things ... hurt. If you can't find what is hurting, you go on a bland diet and slowly add different foods to find what triggers you. I haven't had to do that yet, luckily."

I've been home for a long time now because of the Crohn's and it shows no sign of calming down with me, we're already at the last options in medication. Because of that I've got plenty of time to post and reply frequently. It doesn't mean everyone here is as bad as me, but those who are here a lot probably are.

You will not always have a trigger item don't worry about that and just just try to find what helps your symptoms for now. You should have an upper endoscopy to see what the damage is when you have the symptoms under control and you know what process you have to control you can find the triggers. Good Luck.

CrohnsDisease,3e11tp,Ladybugoleander,4,Tue Jul 21 03:23:25 2015 UTC,I've told everyone I hang out with. They know to let the fan stay on in the bathroom for a good 20 minutes before entering after me. Wish I had better advice but that's all I got...
CrohnsDisease,3e11tp,ECE113,2,Tue Jul 21 03:43:56 2015 UTC,"I don't know how long you've had Crohn's, but I've had it since I was 11 (I'm 27 now). I kept my Crohn's a secret everyone (besides family) until I was 18 and I didn't become comfortable pooping in public until about 2 years ago.  I wish I had better advice than this, but time was the only thing that made it better. You mentioned it was embarassing, which is a feeling I could identify with before, but after awhile I became much more comfortable with myself, illness included. If your friends can't understand (especially your significant other), I'd say you might need to reassess some things."
CrohnsDisease,3e11tp,bigprimmpin,3,Tue Jul 21 03:42:03 2015 UTC,I've had Crohn's for about 11 years now- I've just learned to embrace pooping. If you asked any of my friends what a requirement would be to be my friend- talking/joking about pooping would probably be in the top 5. Try and learn to laugh about it rather than be embarrassed!
CrohnsDisease,3e11tp,bean-juice,2,Tue Jul 21 14:19:22 2015 UTC,"Tell people. Be up front. It's embarrassing but your friends and family will understand and should not make you feel more embarrassed.  If you're away from home, ask if there's a ""remote"" bathroom you can use. In my experience that's the best possible thing. A bathroom far from the action to mask sounds, and hopefully one that others won't use for a while.   Febreeze is a good idea, but for me it really is a poor mask for the smell. Time and air circulation seems to be the best remedy. I've not tried lighting & blowing out a match yet but some ""stinky poopers"" swear by that.  In my experience, preparing the host in advance takes away lots of my nervousness. Be honest and upfront and you should be good. Hope that helps!"
CrohnsDisease,3e11tp,JasonDinAlt,2,Tue Jul 21 20:49:14 2015 UTC,They make a kids book about it - everybody poops.   Honestly though I have horrible BM's and I close the door and everybody's house I go to has a bottle of air freshener in their bathroom. If they don't? They will after I go in ;)
CrohnsDisease,3e11tp,shiccy,2,Tue Jul 21 22:22:28 2015 UTC,"To be honest, I've stopped caring. I have been through far too much suffering to give one single fuck. It is inevitable that I end up talking about Crohn's with the people I meet, typically when it comes to dinner plans. Anyone who doesn't understand is not worth your time. I just make sure the fan is on, I've been thinking about buying ""poopourri"" but haven't.. I've been with my boyfriend since the start of my IBD journey, and he has been nothing short of accommodating (really, a gem. I thank god/allah/helix for him daily) so that hasn't been an issue for me. He is in the medical field, so that helps with the understanding.   TL;DR fuck everyone, praise helix."
CrohnsDisease,3e11tp,squishpotato,1 point,Wed Jul 22 05:28:10 2015 UTC,"Honestly? I alter my eating/pooping schedule so that I either have access to a public bathroom, or I'm in the home of a trusted person.  I've actually made ""snack runs"" from friends' places just so I could use a store bathroom.  I'm a fan of the 'flush more than necessary to cover the sound of me pooping' trick. Blowing my nose helps too.  Also, I do take my purse with me into the bathroom. Scented spray, wipes, bandages (I have abscesses that spontaneously burst), phone in case of emergency or boredom.  PooPourri is one of the best toilet sprays ever. If you can't find a vendor in your area, it's available online."
CrohnsDisease,3e0m75,einstein1351,2,Tue Jul 21 01:13:30 2015 UTC,I get infused at my dr. office since it has an onsite infusion room and surgery center. We have a remistart coordinator who takes the cards from us and uses the money to subsidize our individual treatments. You should take it with you and give it to the hospital for payment toward your treatments. Someone there should be familiar.
CrohnsDisease,3e0m75,nissanator,2,Tue Jul 21 01:42:34 2015 UTC,I have used the Remistart program. What I had to do at least is wait for my insurance to process the claim from my infusion and supply me with an Explanation of Benefits. It has to specifically show what charge on there is for Remicade then you fax it to Remistart and they take the amount your insurance didn't pay and put it on the debit card. I then use that debit card to make a payment with the hospital. Obviously YMMV.
CrohnsDisease,3e0m75,frozen_flame77,2,Tue Jul 21 02:49:17 2015 UTC,Did you have to make a request to receive the EOB for each infusion or are you sent these normally from your insurance provider?   Sorry if these are obvious questions. I'm newly on my own and this is my first time having to deal with all this insurance business
CrohnsDisease,3e0m75,frozen_flame77,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:40:38 2015 UTC,I am automatically sent my EOB but I either have to go on my account online or call and request a report that shows the line item detail that says Remicade.
CrohnsDisease,3e0m75,kortneypayge,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:06:26 2015 UTC,"I have found remistart very easy to use. You just fax the claim for your remicade in to remistart, and they load the money for it onto your debit card which you then use to pay the bill.  If you are not getting EOBs is it because you are you on your parents insurance? If this is the case, they may be getting your claims."
CrohnsDisease,3dzp6b,Redblah,3,Mon Jul 20 20:58:26 2015 UTC,"I am so sorry :(  I've heard all kinds of timelines for remission. This is one of those things where you should talk to your doctor.  Also, the blood in stool is something to talk to your doc about. Be honest about the amount you're seeing, and the times of day you're seeing it.   As to your friends & social schedule. I suggest you be honest and up front with them. It's embarrassing to talk about for you but a good friend will never make you feel embarrassed and will help you through it. This would include taking you to the beach with frequent stops, cutting a visit short to get you to a restroom, etc.  You are NOT alone. In my experience the best thing to do is be upfront and honest with people, and they're always willing to be helpful and understanding.   Best of luck. I hope you get remission soon."
CrohnsDisease,3dzp6b,JasonDinAlt,3,Tue Jul 21 20:23:06 2015 UTC,thanks for the advice :)...My doctor already knows about the bleeding..When i totally stop bleeding I am basically in remission from previous experiences. I find it kind of weird that i bleed only late afternoon rather than in the morning. When I had my last colonoscopy my whole colon was affected and I had Cdiff. Maybe this means my whole colon is not affected anymore?   When I go to NYC i am mostly worried about subway and train trips.

CrohnsDisease,3dykw4,100percentcameron,4,Mon Jul 20 17:40:38 2015 UTC,"Depending on how quickly you do the infusion, don't be surprised if you get light headed or sleepy since you're basically thinning out your blood. Eating around the time of the infusion has never been a problem for me, either before or after. I know some people get a little itchy around the site and you might get a little bit of a rash, but I never do. Finally, remicade works FAST. Like, you should see the full effects the next day or two. If you don't see much of a difference quickly, it probably means remicade isn't effective for you. Good luck!"

I saw significant results after the first one, but by the second I felt I had 90% of the results I have now in remission. Biologics are one of the few things I KNOW work well for me."

CrohnsDisease,3dykw4,Jokers2theRight,3,Mon Jul 20 16:59:26 2015 UTC,"I did remicade for 10 years, with no problem, and it was a miracle drug for me for a long time.  The infusions take a few hours, so bring a book or a tablet or something like that to do while you're there. They always gave me Benadryl with mine, which always made me a little drowsy or tired during my infusions, so until you get a feel how you'll be during yours, I wouldn't suggest bringing something important to do, like work/studies.   Wear comfortable clothes if possible.  I was able to eat pretty close to a normal diet while I was in remission with remicade, though I still made an effort to avoid or limit my trigger foods as much as possible. When I used to get my infusions at the hospital, I'd usually have a salad for lunch during the infusion, if that tells you anything. Definitely take things slow until you have a sense of how things are going for you.  Good luck."
CrohnsDisease,3dykw4,hubretro,3,Mon Jul 20 16:37:29 2015 UTC,wow salad!? i cant remember the last time i had one of those haha. great tips thank you!
CrohnsDisease,3dykw4,delicate_flower,3,Mon Jul 20 16:59:02 2015 UTC,"Eating before can help with how hard it ""hits"" when you get the infusion. My clinic always does Benadryl drips before the Remicade, so I tend to pass out within 1-2 minutes of the infusion start. I'd recommend having someone drive you home afterwards, just in case you get severely drowsy afterwards. Bring a blanket if they don't have them available, because the IV tends to chill you.   I was pretty damn sick for a year leading up to my first Remicade infusion. None of the medications (or diets) I tried prior to that seemed to help much. After the first infusion I started feeling better, and by the third I was in almost complete remission. It took altering from 8-weeks to 6-weeks to be fully in remission.   They say not to expect fast results, so I guess I got lucky. Not everyone gets to remission with Remicade, but it's been a wonder drug for me. Good luck with the infusion!"

CrohnsDisease,3dykw4,crohnsy,3,Mon Jul 20 19:28:53 2015 UTC,Take a nap if the benadryl makes you tired. Get a zofran prescription for nausea. Seabands work great for that too. I am fortunate enough that I can come home and sleep the rest of the day (which I have to in order to feel better). Try and take it easy after. Lay off alcohol for a week after.
CrohnsDisease,3dykw4,ACBoiler58,2,Tue Jul 21 01:37:19 2015 UTC,Good point I'll dig up my zofran thank you!
CrohnsDisease,3dykw4,Zazzafrazzy,2,Tue Jul 21 02:19:40 2015 UTC,"I am at my infusion right now!  I can eat basically whatever I want, I just need to keep it in moderation.  I have found that since I can actually eat again, I tend to eat too much :).  It took me until my 4th infusion before I felt 100%.  Bring a book or a laptop (My infusion center has wifi) as it gets pretty boring sitting there.  Your first 3 infusions will be longer than the typical one.  They slow the drip to make sure you don't have any issues with it.  It should take about 3 hours for the first few and then 2 hours after that.    I was a bit worried at first, but as many other people have said, remicade has been just a miracle drug for me.  It has allowed me to get out of the house and eat the foods that I want.  Enjoy your infusion!  I look forward to them now."

CrohnsDisease,3e0o79,Megasus,2,Tue Jul 21 01:30:23 2015 UTC,"Hey! Sorry about your diagnosis, but glad to hear you're on your way to remission.   To answer your question about consistent symptoms for each flare up, I would say it's highly subjective. Different for every person. In my experience, there are a couple symptoms that are similar with each flare such as sores in my mouth, extreme weight loss, and loss of bowel movement consistency. Each flare for me has had a new symptom or two each time, but in the end whenever my body starts acting strangely I take it as a sign I may be getting into a flare.  So all in all, flare symptoms can differ greatly each time, but in my experience there will be a couple key symptoms that will be the same. Just stay aware and know that every symptom is an important symptom even if it's the first time it's appeared.   Good luck!"

Trust me stop before you find yourself in the er with your intestines .3 cm from rupturing.  I know it's hard I know it's painful, but you can't use those pain killers as a treatment, you just have to live with the pain and go on.

CrohnsDisease,3dzrbh,SighingRabbit,3,Mon Jul 20 22:39:02 2015 UTC,"Didn't they tell you that post-cholecystectomy you'd likely have to change your dietary habits? Your liver is still producing the bile needed to break down food, but you don't have a gallbladder to control the release of bile.  You should be better off avoiding fried, processed, spicy and high in fat foods (ie McDonald's). Foods high in fiber and gas-producing foods can also cause discomfort and should be added back to your diet slowly.   Looking at the color of your poop will also give you an idea of what you're up against, as bile malabsorption (orange poop) is a common issue once you don't have a gallbladder anymore. Look into 'bile acid diarrhea' and 'postcholesystectomy syndrome' as a first line of research. Crohn's is highly unlikely the cause (for which you should be grateful).  If your symptoms persist further than your average stomach bug and being kind to your guts doesn't seem to make a difference, I'd seek guidance (perhaps calling your surgeon depending on how long you had your gallbladder surgery? That's who I called when this happened to me!). But as far as GI issues go, it really could be a number of things that can't be ruled out over the internet.   Keep it simple, you might try sticking to a BRAT diet until your stomach settles a bit more. That will help bulk and bind the foods in your gut to keep it from trying to make a quick exit."
CrohnsDisease,3dzrbh,JessicaMaple,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:30:11 2015 UTC,"The thing is, what you're describing could be 50 different things.  If you've got the shits for more than a week and are having serious abdominal pain.... you need to see a fucking doctor!  And yes, it's going to be very expensive.  You're going to have to see a GP, then a specialist, who's going to do blood and stool tests, and depending on a lot of things... if he thinks it may be Crohn's, you'll have to get some radiological tests done, too.  And it all costs money.  I wouldn't go to the ER- UNLESS you start running a fever, start bleeding out of your asshole, or feel obstructed (when part of your intestine clamps off and your belly swells up).    So one way or the other, you're going to need a medical workup.  That's the first step towards getting some relief."

I have been living with this disease for 20ish years, but have only been diagnosed/treated for the last year."
CrohnsDisease,3dwsdq,Christian_Barnes,4,Mon Jul 20 04:34:41 2015 UTC,"TLDR; Screw Methotrexate, that nonsense probably ruined my entire digestive tract.   I began my pharmaceutical gauntlet being treated for Rheumatoid Arthritis. My Crohn's (IBS diagnosed at the time) had been in full remission for 4 years before I started taking methotrexate.  After a couple months on Methotrexate the drug caused me all sorts of problems. Severe fatigue and nausea that would last for 8 days (troublesome as a weekly dosage), upper GI ulcerations, severe abominable pain, and a slew of other just strange reactions.  By the end of my three year relationship with Methotrexate I couldn't look at a vial of the stuff without gagging. To this day, four years later, I still feel a flight / anxiety response if I see that damn amber liquid vial.   More importantly, while on it my IBS didn't just come out of remission but it came back worse than ever with the intent of killing me. Crohn's diagnosed, three perianal fistulas, and enough physical damage within two years of activity that I had to have a resection (surgery didn't take, almost bled out, on the bag at the moment).   Turns out one of the rare symptoms of Methotrexate may be Crohn's Disease. Yay! I would provide sources, but I don't have access to any medical journals since leaving school, but there were plenty of papers on Methotrexate's relation with IBD. Whether my CD was actually caused by the drug, or I had it before and was misdiagnosed my doctors can't say. What has been studied and documented however, is how rough Methotrexate can be on a digestive tract.   Avoid the drug. Try Imuran (Azathioprine) instead if you must combine a drug with your Remicade. However, being on my third biologic, I would suggest you try something new. Sometimes they work, and sometimes they don't. You're Doctor must have a pretty small sample size if she hasn't seen positive results with Humira, but given that she's happy to default to the Gold Standard of Methotrexate her choice isn't much of a surprise. Sure Methotrexate works on more patients, it's a violent, archaic, and brutal drug, and it's by no means the most effective medication. Your GI sounds frustrated, lazy, or both.   Edit: ""Methotrexate may cause damage to the lining of your mouth, stomach, or intestines. Tell your doctor if you have or have ever had stomach ulcers or ulcerative colitis (a condition which causes swelling and sores in the lining of the colon [large intestine] and rectum). If you experience any of the following symptoms, stop taking methotrexate and call your doctor right away: mouth sores, diarrhea, black, tarry, or bloody stools, or vomit that is bloody or looks like coffee grounds.""  http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/meds/a682019.html  A pretty sparse warning, but if you get your fingers into a medical journal you'll find a ton of stuff reporting concerned findings on Methotrexate's GI interaction."
CrohnsDisease,3dwsdq,Akosce,2,Mon Jul 20 14:57:37 2015 UTC,Well shit. Thanks for the information. I'm definitely gonna avoid it like the plague. I'll look into the Imuran! Thank you! I'm sorry for the hell methotrexate put you through

CrohnsDisease,3dwsdq,Akosce,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:34:33 2015 UTC,"Hopefully my experience was an extremely rare case. Millions take Methotrexate and have few issues with them, but the ones that do seem to have moderate to severe atypical auto-immune issues.  And like you, it was the only thing that really worked for me. Suffered through the drug for years for that reason, and by the end I was weighing the side-effects of the drug against the damage my disease was causing. Not very fun.  My GP is a very pragmatic old British fellow, and in his gruff caring way told me it's all a battle of attrition with these drugs. Sure the drugs may kill us in 30 to 50 years, but the disease would do it within half or a quarter of the time.  Not reassuring at all, but it has helped me look at these drugs in a more pragmatic light."

I would pm you a link to it, but I lost it long ago. To make it faster to fill out I had drop down menus for how I was feeling (nausea, pain, urgency etc.), and value measures for each one (1-10 scale for each). As an added bonus it improved my excel skills.   The spreadsheet was definitely handy, but it's important to remember the randomness of this fucking disease.  I've been taken to the floor by plain rice, and I've eaten a hostess cup cake and walked away unscathed.    For me, controlling my diet is something I need to improve at.  Sometimes when I'm feeling good, I'll cheat and eat something a little too dicey, then predictably I'll feel like shit for the rest of the day, week, or month.  I'm not a smart man."

So much of the trauma to your asshole is from the friction of wiping. I used the highest quality, softest, aloe infused toilet paper available, and it was still causing (or perpetuating, certainly not helping) issues that have completely disappeared since I started using a bidet last year. There's no going back. It's like a shower for your butt. I only use TP to pat myself dry afterward now.   Honestly, in retrospect the thought of wiping poop from my ass with dry paper just seems like something savage/barbaric. When you get your hands dirty you wash them with water, you don't wipe them with a dry paper towel and call it ""clean."""

CrohnsDisease,3dsx0a,TraptorKai,3,Mon Jul 20 03:31:47 2015 UTC,"Hmm, if you're asking if things will be easier, they won't. You will still have to manage your life. But you'll have the benefit of not having to deal with your symptoms. It's starts the hardest, and gets easier over time. Like much in life. It's going to be worth it. You're going to make it through. You made it this far, and the sky's the limit after this."
CrohnsDisease,3dsx0a,bravofour,2,Sun Jul 19 04:34:45 2015 UTC,"Yep I had (well still have) an ileostomy and almost immediately there was no pain, most of the other problems I had been having frequently stopped or were massively reduced. It took a couple of months to get used to having the stoma there but after that it's been great (comparatively). In the two years prior to surgery I had been to hospital maybe 10-12x for operations, but in the eight years I've had the stoma I've only been at most once per year."
CrohnsDisease,3dsx0a,Alman99,2,Sun Jul 19 05:20:15 2015 UTC,"I was diagnosed in 1974 just shy of my 12th birthday. I spent the next 4 years mostly in the hospital undergoing unimaginable pain and procedures, was on large doses of prednisone and salazopyrin, and basically just miserable. My GI at the time was an old school unsympathetic asshole. In the spring of 78, I weighed about 63 lbs, and could hardly get out of bed.  That was when I finally got a new GI. He took one look at me and said surgery was my only option. I still to this day remember waking up in recovery and feeling as if a giant weight had been lifted from my shoulders, and I never looked back. I also wish I had done it sooner, chances are that my present issues would have been diminished had I done so. Living with the ostomy is no big deal in comparison to everything before that. Go for it!"

CrohnsDisease,3dsx0a,HSProductions,2,Sun Jul 19 18:15:57 2015 UTC,I always felt kind of crappy in secondary school. It wasn't Crohn's but my gut was never quite right. Stomach pain on the way to school in the morning. I don't really know why but it was mostly attributed to my anxiety. It was only in the waning years of school and my early days of university that things took a huge nosedive. I'm in my second year after graduation now and things haven't improved yet.

The surgeon did however say he had never seen anything like it inside of my intestines. He said there were lacerations that looked like claw marks all inside of the part he removed. And this, coming from a surgeon at Univ of Chicago is saying a lot. I don't know if I really had a choice at the point of doing the surgery but regardless, I never saw even the slightest abatement of my symptoms. It got ""worse"" in the short term even in many ways. What a mess."

This will make recovery so much faster for you. Also bring lots of chewing gum with you as chewing gum will also get your bowels working faster. Good news is you won't feel much after the surgery because of the pain meds. You will be in the hospital for three to five days so bring books! Recovery is about three weeks but you won't feel quite normal for about three months. Best of luck with your surgery, ask away with any questions and I will do my best to answer them for you."

No medical proof, though), but what led to my surgery was perforating my appendix.  They took out 20-something cm of sm intestine and about 10 cm of right colon with my appendix.  The next 6 months were probably the best of my life.  I'm now dealing with some ulceration, probably from my disease, not the surgery (based on the timing)."

That will last a different amount of time for everyone obviously. Personally i hated it for about a year and a half, maybe 2 years. Got very depressed for a fair while, to the point of very regularly strongly considering ending it, but once I kind of, grew used to it, it is SO SO SO much better. I can live a far more normal life with a bag than i ever dreamed of prior. Now i see it as the best thing thats happened for me since diagnosis.  Im sure everyone has days where they hate it still, when it just gets to you, i know i do. But theyre very few and far between. Id whole heartedly recommend it, but know it is a massive change to know you will have a bag from here on out, and there isnt an undo. But after you get used to it youll love it. This may seem really bleak, but i am just trying to make sure i dont make it sound like you will get the surgery and the next day be loving it. I am just saying long term, i cannot recommend it more.  Edit: To add details to this, i had a loop ileostomy performed in 2009, and eventually a total colectomy in late 2010. Went back to work in 2011, was once i had been back at work for a while my mindset started to improve."

Had two minor flares between 2012-2014 and then june 2014 it hit me. HARD. I noticed flare symptoms right away.  My doc put me on new meds. After August i had to stop working because i had to stay at home next to a toilet. I had about 15 BMs per day. Only times i left the house was for hospital appointments.   The flare went on all the way in till june '15 until my surgery. Had my entire colon removed and they connected my small intestines to my rectum(so No j-pouch) .    The first few days was hell. If someone had come in. Put a pill on the stand next to me and said ""If you take this you wont wake up"", I would ha e taken it. I was i so much pain. I could barely move, threw everything up when i tried to eat and The patient next to me was awful too.   But NOW I could not be happier.  I have since my surgery been able to go to the movies, go out shopping, go out to bars with friends,  or just go for a walk. No more having to have a toilet right next to me. I still have about 5 BMs per day. But I can HOLD IT.   Surgery is a really big step. Why I didnt do sooner was because I wanted to try all meds first. Because if there was a medicin that worked that would be better.  But none worked and now I dont have a colon anymore. I dont regret anything. I still think I did the right choice trying and not having surgery first.    If you ever need to talk pm's / skype just let me know.

B12 is a major deficiency for many of us, as are potassium and magnesium.  All are easily obtainable in pill form.  Iron and D are also problems for me, but that may just be specific to my issues.  Everyone's disease is different.  Crohn's / UC / IBD are just descriptions for a range of symptoms, much like the common cold can be caused by a wide range of infections.

They switched me off asacol, early on because I had a huge amount of joint pain in my knees, which wasn't hugely thrilling for a active 13yo girl.   Its only now with my fourth flare that im testing out removing foods, as when flaring some foods bothered me, but I felt were not causing the symptoms. Also I was a stubborn teenager for much of it, that loved junk food and takeaways haha.  I would say talk to your doctor, for me, personally the thing the gets it under control the fastest is the colifoam and pentasa enemas. To me the medication is there to prevent it returning and worsening (that how it seems to me). So tolerate the diet you are doing for now if it is helping, I stopped being able to eat most things for awhile, and it was a matter of just removing all the foods I liked, till I had I achieved remission and then after a period I looked at reintroducing foods, and now when I'm not in a flare I can eat pretty much anything :)"

CrohnsDisease,3dqily,fudgeybhole,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:18:30 2015 UTC,I'm not quite sure but the only things I can think of is: -How did you break it to your SO if you had one when diagnosed and how they handled it. -How we deal with jokes from people who know you have the disease but aren't accepting over it. (Some bitchy people have tried to exploit it but I have a sense of humor and witty comebacks)
CrohnsDisease,3dppfd,HeyListenNavi,4,Sat Jul 18 06:23:47 2015 UTC,"I think sometimes you have to push yourself to do stuff the way you would a friend who is a homebody.   And I say that as someone who decided to sit tonight out, but usually if I just take the plunge and do something I rarely backout midway through. It's only when I don't commit that I find myself settling for my house."
CrohnsDisease,3dppfd,ganxBice,3,Sat Jul 18 06:48:51 2015 UTC,Thank you. I found that I was becoming one of those people who chronically bailed on plans and I hate that! I'm going to go camping for a night next weekend... Baby steps.

I also happen to work in healthcare and a downward spiral happens way too fast with UC/Crohn's and a sedentary/reclusive lifestyle. You need the positivity of others! At the end of a week, as yourself ""what all fun did I have?"" If the answer has anything to do with Netflix and being by yourself, you're doing it wrong.  There's too much out there in the world, and I know there's a side of depression that comes with our disease, but honestly, you need to get some exercise, some sun, and something to be confident in. Anyone can watch Netflix, but I guarantee you have some talent elsewhere you can enjoy!  Stay strong bruh!"

I still see friends, go to work, go on holidays, hell, I've even just obtained my private pilot licence. My body hasn't completely regained my trust to fart on a whim, though..."

You will get more stable eventually with the symptoms, then just get yourself out and doing stuff like you used to, remember who you were, and try and get back to it. Even if it scares you, life begins outside you're comfort zone, and you can't live it chilling watching Netflix for the rest of your life.   P.S i'm also 22!"

CrohnsDisease,3dppfd,Windiigo,2,Sat Jul 18 17:15:27 2015 UTC,Hey I'm 22 as well diagnosed back in early '02 the way I find myself most comfortable going out is being out with at least one person I know who I can network with too. I mainly go out only on weekends which does leave myself at home during the week but it's not too bad. If it is the weekend and my crohn's is bothering me I wait to go out or just do something else where I feel comfortable.
CrohnsDisease,3dppfd,Windiigo,2,Sat Jul 18 12:07:52 2015 UTC,I just force myself to leave the house and socialise or otherwise attend events or I'd literally never leave the house. I tend to sink into deep depression if I isolate myself like that too much.
CrohnsDisease,3dppfd,Wasney,2,Sat Jul 18 13:15:43 2015 UTC,"I have the lovely mix of Asperger's Syndrome and Crohn's disease, so my already not too existent social circle diminished even more after getting Crohn's. It means I am home a lot, especially because we haven't found medicine yet that helps me. I've been on prednisone for the past 8 months and am bothered a lot by the side effects of it.   Still, I'm not bitter or depressed. It's really up to you how you deal with it, you can be resentful about it but that's no way to live. I cherish the moments I do get to go out and see the friends I do have, or the small moments when I manage to take a walk and get some ice cream on a sunny day.   It's not all bad, I am luckty to live in a country with a descent welfare system that allows me to live indepently while disabled. I'd worry if I had to surive without that system, because I can't work at all because I'm too ill. But there's no use worrying about something that is not happening, so I am trying to enjoy the blessing of the way things are now.   I'm free to spend my time the way I want, I can get enough rest on a day, I've got my own apartment and on good days I can see my friends. It could all be a lot worse :)"
CrohnsDisease,3dppfd,Tandemaniac,3,Sat Jul 18 13:44:15 2015 UTC,Thank you for the advice and the inspiration.
CrohnsDisease,3dppfd,Stargirl63,2,Sat Jul 18 17:15:07 2015 UTC,"No problem, I hope you find your way.  You're going to be sad, you're going to be frustrated, there's no sugarcoating that. Accept those days and be kind to yourself when life isn't.  It isn't easy, but fighting against being ill does nothing but make you exhausted. Take it day by day and appreciate the small things."
CrohnsDisease,3dppfd,delicate_flower,2,Sat Jul 18 17:39:11 2015 UTC,"I was feeling the same a few years ago. I just forced myself to go out. I always warned my friends I may not be out long, or I may not be up for some things, but I made.myself go out.  I had a bad 2 year flair that kept me home for a long time. After that I just couldn't stay home anymore. Just make sure your doing something with bathroom and such close, or something you can stop if needed. Ease yourself into it."
CrohnsDisease,3dppfd,CountDraclicka,2,Sat Jul 18 21:44:54 2015 UTC,"In my opinion, you have to risk it. You have to risk shitting your pants, and weirdly bailing out of a social scene after an accident and just texting or calling them later (friends will understand, most strangers too).  You gotta plan to do the fun things in life, and only break the plans if you absolutely have to.  And sometimes, you have to do the fun things in life, even when you're not having any fun at all.  Most people understand and accommodate the disease.  I met an ex-girlfriend during a minor flair, and even though she turned out to be a pretty shitty person (and not in that good ol' colitis way) she accommodated me spending 20 minutes at a time in the bathroom on our first dates.   People will surprise you, and you might surprise yourself.    I try to plan for the best, and don't cancel until I'm absolutely sure I can't do it.  For example, I've spent the weekend planning a bike touring trip on the assumption I'll pull through this flare in the normal amount of time for me.  Sure, I might have to cancel at the last moment, same as I had to cancel a camping trip last week.  But I think it's better to plan for the best, because the fall back option (laying on the floor watching netflix) will always be there when the good stuff falls through.    Just always, no matter what, keep an extra pair of undies and wet wipes with ya ;)"
CrohnsDisease,3dpo34,blackwatersunset,4,Sat Jul 18 06:07:05 2015 UTC,"How much your life is going to suck is really specific to your personal case of Crohn's. This could be a minor inconvenience with the help of medication or it could just be one bitch of a life.  I was diagnosed while at university and still finished and work full time now, so it can be done but the degree to which you will be able to is very dependent upon your severity.  Prednisone advice, Just get through it. From my personal experience with it: you're going to be the hungriest you've ever been so you're going to pack on some weight. The most insignificant stuff is going to get you so worked up and mad. Sleep is going to be harder to come by, and don't be surprised if you get some high-school throwback acne either during the course of pred or within a few months of being off of it. It's most likely going to hurt your self confidence and personal image for a little while. But, it beats the hell out of crippling pain, bathroom 20 times a day, and watching your body wither away in front of your eyes. Hopefully you'll be off it soon and on to a maintaining drug!  Some advice I wish I had gotten when I was first diagnosed:  This is your new normal and no one is going to understand it. Some things are going to be sacrificed. You need to evaluate your health and the possible implications before you do stuff. Buddies want to go bar hop for 3 days straight? Want to eat food that is so damn good but may cause issues? Want to allow yourself to become overstressed from work/school? Sometimes each of those 3 cases are needed, but sometimes your health HAS to be the first priority. The peer pressure to do the stuff you used to do will still be there. People can't comprehend your world because they don't live it. Not because they don't care but because they just don't get it. You Have to be your own advocate and make decisions for yourself more now than you probably would have before. Push yourself has hard as possible, but you also need to know your limit.   Things that I think really help managing Crohns outside of medication (while in remission) are time management to avoid stress, healthy eating, exercise, and maintaining a good work/life balance. I really let Crohns impact my social life even after I was relatively healthy again from Pred and humira. I withdrew from people when I was first diagnosed and let it stay that way for far too long. Maintain your friendships and force yourself to enjoy life when you can!  I hope you have good healing, and a flare-free time during your masters! Good luck, man."
CrohnsDisease,3dpo34,aclassyfox,1 point,Sat Jul 18 08:26:20 2015 UTC,"That is good advice.    I'm sorry you are going through it at 18, it's unfair.    Talk to your teachers, even if you're in remission.  You may need accommodations (bathroom breaks during exams, sitting by the door, make up work for missed classes).  Do this before there's an issue.    If prednisone makes you half as hungry as it made me, you'll want to make sure to hit the gym a lot.  Getting fat is no fun.  Also, prednisone made me much more emotional than I normally am, understand that some mood swings might be the result of the medicine and not what's going on around you.  Be patient with others, don't respond with anger quickly.  I'm as emotional as a brick, and I've balled my eyes out on prednisone after a supervisor gave me some minor constructive criticism on a piece of work I was doing.    Make a spreadsheet that tracks everything going in, out, and how you feel.  It'll help you figure out what the safe(er) foods are.  Also, alternative medicines really helped me out, they may be legal depending on what state you're in.    Good luck, stay healthy."
CrohnsDisease,3dpo34,Tandemaniac,4,Sun Jul 19 23:07:33 2015 UTC,"Celiacs and Crohn's together are rough. Advice: You will need to figure out a diet that doesn't destroy you, as you begin college of all times.. I forsee lots of meats and cooked vegetables.   Prednisone effects vary. Play it by ear. What will your dosage be? That plays a huge role.   Comfort: Getting this during puberty would have been much much worse. The body goes through enough during that time and having Crohn's going into it was the worst period, health wise, of my life. School is important, but your health is more important, so prioritize it. See how you are able to do with the masters, and be ready to shift gears and adjust to change should you have to make some tough decisions."
CrohnsDisease,3dpo34,PTMegaman,3,Sat Jul 18 08:57:34 2015 UTC,"I can't be argued that we all have a love hate relationship with the drug. The side effects look scary, but the sheer benefit it brings from not feeling like death all day and being able to eat properly far outweighs most of the side effects over the short term.  Regarding uni, if you are finding it stressful; I'd strongly recommend utilising the disability resources available to you, and also consider a partial loading for study. (i.e. do 3 units instead of 4)"
CrohnsDisease,3dpo34,zil7,2,Sat Jul 18 09:39:11 2015 UTC,Check out Hank Green's (vlog brothers) video about his UC. It helped me think about it.
CrohnsDisease,3dpo34,poopstories,2,Sat Jul 18 10:34:38 2015 UTC,"You got alot on your plate right now. Getting hit with Crohns and Celiac is rough, and starting an intensive masters course is a big thing. But it also depends on the severity of these. So my main piece of advice is to just feel it out.  Stress management is very important. I used to be happy go lucky and claim stress does not affect me. But there are more types of stress then I accounted for and college is getting difficult to continue. Stress does just affect you mentally, which I can easily handle; is can manifest in physical symptoms and you could fall into a deep slump.  Everybody has different opinions about Prednisone. You might get goofy side effects but it still boosts my confidence because I am hardly human without it.   As for diet for Crohns you have to feel it out and find what food works and what food does not. You should be cautious though because of your Celiac."
CrohnsDisease,3dpo34,Tigerfuyung,2,Sat Jul 18 18:51:52 2015 UTC,"You can handle a lot more than you think you can.  I thought I was going to die during my first flare I felt so awful, but I still managed to finish my PhD while having pretty rough symptoms and then hold down one full-time and two part-time jobs after diagnosis.   Take care of yourself as best you can.  This means sleeping enough, getting regular physical activity and taking it easy when you need to.  These things are optional for most 18-year-olds, but not for you, because everything is so much easier when you're healthy.   Along the lines of the above, take up weightlifting.  Instant confidence boost, great way to stay fit, huge sanity saver and stress relief. Ditching gluten is not hard, you just need to learn how to cook.  This is useful because you'll have food you can eat, and you'll also have a better sense for what is definitely never safe if you DO risk eating out.  This sensor is under development and might be of interest for you.  Making things yourself pretty much always results in tastier food than buying pre-packaged gluten free things, once you know what you are doing.  I never found an adequate substitute for donuts, though.  Perhaps it can be done. Don't isolate yourself, you run the risk of some serious crippling depression.  Find support where you can.  Go to counseling if you think you might need it at all--don't wait until you're in crisis, there are likely free services at your university."
CrohnsDisease,3dpo34,intrinsicdisorder,2,Sun Jul 19 07:47:22 2015 UTC,"Crohn's can be annoying but, life is full of annoyances. You'll live and go on and while you live you need to do things you like or things that fulfill you or make you a living, so keep going for whatever you like.  although 1 thing is for sure, if your symptoms are not controlled by the drugs and you end up with severe ones from the stress of school, take a break from school.  a lot of people right now are being diagnosed with herpes/hiv/paralysis/etc. - you have crohn's disease .. ""o0o0o0o0 whatever will you do 0o0o0o0o omg omg"".  on the bright side you now have a legitimate medical excuse to smoke pot for anti-inflammatory effects, lol.  this is life dude, shit happens and you respond to it and keep living - because shit will keep happening until you die - and your choices now will keep effecting you in the future until you die - so nothing has really changed with your dx, you're just now dealing with an extra dis ease."

CrohnsDisease,3dntlw,chedbugg,2,Fri Jul 17 19:58:53 2015 UTC,"Two weeks should be good, I was in the hospital for one week after mine and then I was home. But if you have to do any lifting at all or if you move around a lot it won't be enough. I had three of these surgeries and was EXHAUSTED after them. Just going up and down stairs will wear you out. Plus you can't carry anything heavier than a gallon of milk, so if your job requires lifting then you'll have to wait the full recovery period. My job required lifting and I wasn't allowed back until my full recovery period was over since you can tear your stitches open lifting too much or moving."
CrohnsDisease,3dntlw,Berzerkerwar,2,Fri Jul 17 20:34:08 2015 UTC,"Fortunately, I have a desk job so no heavy lifting or stair climbing required. I'm am worried about driving, though. Did you have any problems with that, other than the exhaustion?"

My doctor said it helps get your intestines jump started, so the more you walk the faster you'll get home. It's pretty hard at first but it makes a difference. My first surgery I walked the minimum and was there for 8 days. My second and third I walked ad much as I could and was only there for 5 days! Best of luck to you!"

CrohnsDisease,3dntlw,delicate_flower,2,Fri Jul 17 22:57:31 2015 UTC,I'm scheduled for a resection next month. My surgeon took me off for 8 weeks. He said I may need more depending on my recovery and that he will extend my disability if needed. Have you ever had a resection before? Two weeks seems like an extremely short amount of time to recover. I wish you the best of luck. But at least you have a desk job so you may be okay if you don't have to do any heavey lifting.
CrohnsDisease,3dntlw,scottley,1 point,Sat Jul 18 10:30:34 2015 UTC,"Yeah, when I go back, it will be a Friday, then I have saturday off. I will work sunday and monday, then have the tuesday off.

CrohnsDisease,3dn0dt,DaveAnson,5,Fri Jul 17 16:24:05 2015 UTC,"I'm 17 and have UC, I was diagnosed in January. I just try to avoid caffine, wheaty breads or pastas, I avoid eating a lot of raw veggies and limit my fried foods. I'm still figuring out what sets me off. I'm taking multivitamins and a vitamin D3 supplement which when paired with exercise seems to be helping me feel a bit better."
CrohnsDisease,3dn0dt,fudgeybhole,3,Fri Jul 17 16:31:04 2015 UTC,"Diet is tricky. For some, like me, it's really hard to correlate food with symptoms. I think it's primarily bacterial, so I eat a lot of probiotics and prebiotics which seem to help.  Others will say try a super restrictive diet like the SCD. It works for many, but in the 4 months I tried it I only lost weight and my symptoms didn't improve it all.  At this point I just try to avoid things that I think will potentially give me stomach problems anyways (too many sweets, greasy food, or Wendy's)"
CrohnsDisease,3dn0dt,poisson89,2,Fri Jul 17 16:48:44 2015 UTC,"You'll eventually learn which foods work and which don't.   Most of us have to watch our fiber balance (soluble vs insoluble), gassy foods, acidic foods, and diuretics (caffeine, alcohol, etc). We also have to stay hydrated as we lose quite a bit of fluids during an episode.   Aside from fiber balance and hydration we're all a little unique in our foods, and sometimes what you can eat one week you can't the next.   If there is a most common problem food it's probably popcorn. Evil tasty popcorn."

I now have this sweet bag attached next to my naval and my stool goes into it cause they took out 95% of my colon and they gonna make me a j pouch in September. But I've been dealing with symptoms for years. Since you just started you gotta see exactly what triggers you. For me it's dairy and spicy foods. So you gotta make a physical list or mental list of stuff to probably stay away from. Oh and you might benefit for seeing a nutritionist if you or your doctor deem it necessary.  Hope you heal fast and it's not too bad. The community here is great for all types of questions.

I've only had 1 doctor give me some insight to diet and it changed my life.   Fibre is risky, I limit my fibre big time. Caffeine, haven't had it in like 8 years, aside from the very rare chocolate bar. Popcorn, gone. Lots of sweet drinks. Really limit my fruits and veggies (fibre).   You'll have to test foods for yourself, but diet is so key to your health man."
CrohnsDisease,3dn0dt,Angisio,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:52:37 2015 UTC,"As everyone else has pointed out diet is tricky.  For years I thought the tomato sauce, green peppers, onions in Italian food was causing me problems, turns out it was the wheat (pasta, pizza crust or bread) that caused me discomfort.  Carbonated drinks are another item that took me forever to figure out.    Managing your diet can also be a pain when going out with friends and family depending on the circumstances.  My mom still fixes me a bowl of ice cream every time we go to visit, despite the fact that I was diagnosed at age 13 and she has know about it for 30+ years.  My advice don't change everything at once, take it slow. If you suspect something is a problem cut out that one thing.  Use a diet tracker if you want.  For me fixing my diet over several years has reduced the amount of time I spend with abdominal discomfort, so it is worth the time and effort.  Good luck."

CrohnsDisease,3dn0dt,rocket__science,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:50:20 2015 UTC,"Like others have mentioned, it's different for each person! Honestly I've been on medication since 2010 and it's more or less managed, so I eat anything. If I'm stressed out I notice some things will bother me, such as caffeine or dairy or alcohol. But otherwise it's fine. I'm assuming it's because of the medication, so if you're not taking anything for your UC you will probably be experimenting with diet for a while.  Best of luck, if you have any questions let me know."

Get a food journal and keep logs of what you eat. Also keep track of your bms and pain levels-- I use the android app called GIMonitor for this. Then you can correlate food choices with pain levels and bad bms. This will help you determine what you can and cannot eat.  Common foods I've seen include pork, dairy, and anything high in fiber. I also can't do meats that are rich in fats like ox tail, but regular beef is ok. It really is just trial and error-- I'm sorry there isn't an easier way."

CrohnsDisease,3dn0dt,ccerulean,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:06:16 2015 UTC,"I want to second what areraswen said about GIMonitor and taking time to figure it out for yourself. The GIMoniter app has allowed me to see how effective my meds are and what things help trigger me. Also, if you have the patience/willpower, try an elimination diet for a few days. Broth for a few days and then re-introduce foods slowly/one at a time to see if they bug you. It's not easy, but can help you pinpoint trouble foods. Also, at least for me, the blander the better. Chicken, rice, steamed green beans and bananas are all pretty ""safe"". Weirdly, I also do okay with sugary cereal and almond milk, but yogurt DESTROYS me (even the ""good"" Greek kind). Also, refined sugar does tend to take a toll. Just take time and experiment."

Diet was such a trial and error process for years with very little success. Now I've finally found one that works really well for me, called the FODMAP diet. I was having a lot of trouble with bloating, gas and pain even while in remission, but sticking to this diet makes me feel GREAT! And not the kind of relative great where at least I'm not having diarrhea 6 times a day. The kind of great that makes me remember what normal feels like. The old normal I barely remember."
CrohnsDisease,3dn0dt,SmellThisMilk,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:05:59 2015 UTC,"Personally when flaring i reduce my diet to a relatively basic one. First time when i flared at 12, i subsisted on mince and potatoes and the fortisip drinks.  then from there tested foods. spicy food i couldnt deal, overly acidic foods (no oranges, manderins), cut out foods with pips (strawberries etc) (so a fair bit of fruit.)  for me personally, food doesnt have a huge impact on the severity of a flare, but Ive found it can delay the healing process.  I know wheat and gluten can be fairly aggravating for many. so just go through and test things out.  And if you are sad about possibly losing foods, just remember it isnt the end of the world, ive been in complete remission 3 times and i was able to reintroduce foods that were my enemy for awhile, so it certianly can reach a point of normalcy again :)  and to avoid triggering it again when in remission, ive found avoiding people with stomach bugs, my last two flares were caused by catching stomach bugs off friends and family :)"

I started a food journal a while ago when I was told I ""just have IBS"" and have narrowed down a few foods that irritate my stomach. So far they are: apples, corn, and ice cream. I'm sure there are more but those three cause pretty dramatic stomach distress consistently. My advice is to start a food journal and try to eat mostly things that you think are OK for you, and experiment with foods that you're not sure about."

Also, I was really nervous about being able to down all the prep that early in the morning, but for some reason it was actually easier than the night before.

Set alarm for second dose and went back to bed. The 45min drive to the hospital in the morning was the hard part. Early morning was easier b/c just went home to sleep it off after. Late afternoon appointment was miserable. I was so dehydrated by that point they couldn't get an IV line started without several nurses and almost an hour of trying. Keep the morning appointment."

It is the prodrug for 6-MP (i.e., it breaks down into 6-MP as you metabolize it), which has a good track record for efficacy and safety for decades.  Side effects are usually tolerable, and the one everyone is worried about, lymphoma, is actually quite rare.  Sadly, there are risks everywhere when you are dealing with the immune system. But fortunately we know what to be on the lookout for, and catch problems while they're manageable."
CrohnsDisease,3dns53,jxj24,3,Sat Jul 18 04:13:06 2015 UTC,"No that's not it at all. You typically progress with starting with the safest drugs (least nasty side effects) like mesalamine and progress all the way up to the biologics (Remicade, Humira, Entyvio etc) or combos of biologics and immunomodulators. The less tweaking of your immune system the better. There are cases where a doctor might jump strait into a biologic if a patient is experiencing a particularly aggressive case.   Aggressive disease = aggressive treatment."

I take imuran and the side-effects are negligible-- the worst side effects happen if you fail to do your blood work or your doctor doesn't respond correctly to the data collected in the lab.   Please don't think I'm thinking negatively of you here, but fearing your doctors and unproven government conspiracies may be a sign that something else could be wrong. Again I am no doctor, but perhaps seeking some sort of talk therapy could be helpful? Crohn's is often paired with (or causes, depending on who you ask) depression and anxiety and the like. Perhaps your struggle with crohn's disease is causing you more stress than you can be happy dealing with. Either way you shouldn't be embarrassed to seek help, crohn's is a total bitch and it makes everybody a little wiggy ;)  tl;dr: imuran's a good drug, don't worry. If you're feeling off mentally than seeking help there is a good and brave thing to do. If you're not feeling off, imuran's a good drug, don't worry."

CrohnsDisease,3dlnqy,tops1983,4,Fri Jul 17 07:25:30 2015 UTC,"Anything that would seem appropriate at McDonald's is a good idea. They're experts at fitting lots of calories into a fairly small, processed, low-residue volume. Anything you eat should have fat in it. Coconut oil can be added to lots of foods, is delicious, and is anti-inflammatory and heart healthy. White bread and white rice are easy to digest and rather calorie dense. I would also say that you could drink juice or soda instead of water but it's not so healthy for people to consume tons of sucrose all the time. Creamy peanut butter is basically a calorie supplement you can eat with a spoon."

Protein shakes that bodybuilders use makes my flare worse 2. Add grinded cookies to your Ensure (or whatever you are drinking) and make a paste out of it. That way you'll raise those 300 kcal to around 700 kcal. Also, this way Ensure doesn't make me go to the bathroom half an hour after I drink it. 3. Try McDonald's as /u/Nu5ZCa mentioned. One Big Mac a day gives you around 550 extra kcal or two cheeseburgers give you around 600 kcal. Of course, only if they don't make things worse.    Eat smaller servings every two hours. In pharmacies you can buy specially designed powders for dehydration that are mixed with water. Here in Europe we have Rehidromix, but it's used only when you're really dehydrated. In other cases sports drinks like Powerade do the trick."

Also like the other user said Mickey Ds is super good and cheap. Depending where you live you could get a filling meal for like 3$. Fried chicken is the bomb but some people are irritated by fried foods. Eating a heavy breakfast definitely helps. Try and eat alot of meats paired with a heavy carb, such as mashed potatoes and a steak. Idk how strict you are with your eating but I write out three or four square meals a day to keep my BMs on a schedule.

I am in a very similar boat-- in the aspect that Ive been flaring since April, lost a lot of weight, and been trying to gain it back. I am finally at an solid 97 pounds and FINALLY not losing anymore. I am hoping this means my flare up is almost done.. but ALL the doctors O have talked to have told me to try Ensures, Boosts, etc. to gain some weight and add some calories. But really, I know how difficult it is with Crohns giving such absorption issues. I eat a LOT of chicken.. chicken sandwiches, I add cheese (theres lactose free ones if you are lactose intolerant), rice, white bread, noodles, and eggs. Those are easy basic things that i eat that don't seem to bother me during my flare up. I also drink TONS of gatorade/powerade. Those have a good amount of sugar, and it helps with hydration and electrolytes. Even if you like hard boiled eggs, those are very helpful in adding protein/ calories to your diet. And if you're like me, you are probably sick of people saying ""You really need to gain weight, do you even eat?? Cant you just deal with the pain if it means you get some food in you??"" We all know how it is, and no, its not as easy as just ""dealing with the pain."" So I sympathize, I am in a similar boat! Also-- if you can tolerate it, Mcdonalds is a great idea. And I am going to try that as well!! Now that I can tolerate more than just chicken. I hope you find some relief! Im still waiting on remission as well... being hospitalized more than 10 times in the past 4 months is what Im going through..  P.S. Maybe i needed to rant a little, so thank you ☺"

She explained it to me this way: consider 3500 cal to equate to about 1 lb weight gain and spread over a week that's an extra 500 cal/day. In other words, an extra 500 calories a day should net you about 1 pound of gained weight over the course of a week, everything else being equal. She suggested taking in nuts, almonds, peanut butter, etc. (obviously what you eat depends on what your body can handle). She also suggested liquid meals (like Ensure and things like that) because I guess liquids get absorbed quicker.  I've been eating oatmeal every night w/ vitamin D milk, but I'm one of the lucky ones that can tolerate dairy.

CrohnsDisease,3dj33r,PTMegaman,3,Fri Jul 17 06:43:57 2015 UTC,"Let me try again: it doesn't sound silly.   Steroids can have profound effects on your personality, along the lines you describe. My advice is that you talk to your doctor about alternatives.  Unfortunately, those changes can be more or less permanent -- a problem that gets worse the more and longer you take the drug. I am reporting from deep personal experience: steroids permanently messed me up.   I really hate to see that happen to anyone else, so I strongly urge you to take the matter up with your doctor."

CrohnsDisease,3dj33r,joinmybandwagon,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:29:27 2015 UTC,"Sure. I was probably predisposed to some kind of depression, but prednisone made it a permanent part of my life -- that's the major change. My emotional volatility is also a lot higher than it used to be, pre-pred. I get angry a lot more quickly and also randomly weepy at silly stuff. My sleep patterns are permanently messed up. I have trouble focusing on a task for long periods of time -- except when I'm having a semi-manic episode. My memory is full of holes -- so I'm sure there's other stuff I'm forgetting.   It didn't even occur to me that changes from prednisone could be permanent until I read about Jane Pauley's experience: she took prednisone for hives, and it triggered bipolar disorder -- which stayed with her even after she stopped taking the prednisone. My life made a lot more sense after that."
CrohnsDisease,3dj33r,duncancross,2,Fri Jul 17 12:36:05 2015 UTC,"This happened to me, and my closest friend and lifetime number one told me something I think you need to hear too.   never underestimate how much people love you. That's the worst thing you can do for yourself. People react to you, you've been off for a bit, so maybe they feel as neglected as you do. But at the end of it, they understand.    Send them a message, tell them you've been a knob because of your meds and you're aware of it and sorry, joke around a bit. You'll be surprised how many people are pleased to hear from you, because something this vile disease does to us that doctors seem to forget to mention, is that it completely desimates your self esteem, I promise you that anything you're feeling is temporary.

I was doing a lot of explaining to my friends that I felt different because my meds, which was hard for me because I don't talk about my inner life much. It's not easy to deal with feeling so drastically different. Whatever you do, recognize this. Be compassionate with yourself. It's not easy but it will get better.

He moved a little further away and I was terrified to go visit during that time.  My stomach was constantly jacked and any travel that was longer than a trip to town shot my anxiety through the roof and made bathroom situations even worse.  So I never visited him unless he came down to visit his parents and I never really said why.  So most of our talking was done online or over the phone and we drifted further and further away and talked less.  He moved to another state and I did go to his wedding there since I was doing a bit better.  Afterwards I texted him a few weeks after to see how the married life was doing.  Never got a reply, no answers to calls and I just said fuck it.  That was two years ago and it kind of bugs me when I think about it.  Okay, so it bugs me a lot.  My wife thinks it might be that his wife doesn't seem to care for us much, but who knows.    Anyway, my point is that Crohn's takes its toll in damn near every way possible.  My only advice is to be open and up front as possible.  Especially when you're on things that affect your mood substantially.  There's only so much you can do - the rest is on them."

I just want to know that if I do end up getting infected that I'm not literally fucked. Right now I feel like there is a child out there with chicken pox who is just waiting for his chance to hug the shit out of me and ruin all the years of keeping myself alive.  There are resources for what it's like to have chicken pox, and the risks of having it as an adult, but I don't see any information on what it's like to have it while suffering from Crohn's.

Do you even know what titers are?  Having titers pulled, as you put it won't do anything for the OP.  Titers tell you if you have been infected with an organism and produced antibodies to it.  OP already stated that they never had chicken pox, so she won't have the antibodies to it."
CrohnsDisease,3diktg,Anti_Vaccination,-2,Fri Jul 17 05:00:41 2015 UTC,Why don't you laugh hysterically at OP's post? She thinks she has to run into a child with the pox in order to catch it.
CrohnsDisease,3diktg,filledesinge,-1,Fri Jul 17 12:39:12 2015 UTC,"Are you doing to answer the question: what benefit is she going to receive from having titers pulled?    They won't tell her if she has an active infection (she'd get that info from being sick) they'll only tell her if she has antibodies to the disease (meaning she has previously been exposed to it).     She thinks she has to run into a child with the pox in order to catch it.   Maybe not a child, but she would have to run into someone who has chicken pox infection.  You can't just magically get antibodies to the disease without being exposed to it.     Why don't you laugh hysterically at OP's post?   Because she asked a valid question that isn't funny.  The sheer lack of understanding in what your talking about, though, made your post a very funny read indeed.  Girl, I am still laughing!"
CrohnsDisease,3diktg,Anti_Vaccination,0,Fri Jul 17 13:52:43 2015 UTC,"I've never had TB, but I have antibodies for it. She could run into someone who is asymptomatic and still contract the disease.

CrohnsDisease,3diktg,HelperBot_,0,Sun Jul 19 18:40:31 2015 UTC,"LOL, you have no idea what you're talking about.  If she has antibodies she has, at some point, been infected with the disease.  Whether she was asymptomatic or not is irrelevant because you don't develop antibodies without having an infection or being vaccinated.  Infection and the state of illness are two different things.  You can be infected and not show signs or symptoms of illness (the state of being  asymptomatic).  If she has a suppressed immune system and came across an asymptomatic child, she will contract the infection and become ill because of her immunocompromised state.    Also, if you have antibodies to TB, you have either been vaccinated with the BCG vaccine or you have, or currently have, latent TB.  You won't produce antibodies without being infected or vaccinated.  Even if you are asymptomatic.  This holds for any disease.  Do you understand this?  It's kind of important that you do if you want to make it seem like you know what you're talking about.

Have you been eating constipating foods like cheese? Do you have any other symptoms?  Monitor your symptoms, but don't wait too long until you talk to your doctor. This disease is unpredictable and you may have done everything right, but could still have symptoms, even after being OK for a while. It's good to keep him updated, especially when there has been a change in the your symptoms. If it gets worse in a short amount of time definitely take action .   It's tough to know when you should call, but when things change they should know. I've called my doctor to let them know I'm starting to flare just so they have a record of it. That way if things get worse they will have some background. They don't always bring me in, but it's in my file.   Good luck and I hope you start feeling better soon."

My strategy:   Make the conscious decision that you are going to get through it, and nothing will break your will.  Then, recognize that you're going to be hungry, and want to be  cranky, tired and generally unpleasant.  So you make it easy on yourself, buy being mindful of your emotions, speech and actions, recognizing that you can choose to step back and think.  And since you're probably like most people and occasionally eat out of boredom, you can't have any food in the house.  At all.    You can have freeze pops and beef broth and chicken broth with teriyaki sauce and tea.  You need to stay hydrated anyway, so you might as well drink interesting and tasty things.  Constantly sipping on different flavors and temperatures will distract you from not eating food.  And your last resort, short term coping strategy is to take one of two benadryl an hour before bedtime so you're not awake and battling your urges.  It's just a few days.  Fasting has been shown to have significant health benifits.  It also let's you reboot your gut and restart of clean foods.  I think its also good for the mind- it's a challenge between your lower and higher selves.  Around the world, tens of thousands of people fast on any given day.  You can do it too."

A pulse usually does the trick without having to resort to a longer course of steroid treatment  In order to bring things under control again, I do a 3 day liquids only fast, and take high-doses of prednisone.    Water, ice tea, broth... a piece of hard candy or a few tic tacs... and an Ensure. Staying hydrated is essential.  Prednisone: 80mg, 60mg, 40mg, taken with a Previcid or some other kind of pharmaceutical grade antacid (which continues for a few days to prevent ulcers).  Then I sloooowly start eating again... one plain scrambled egg over the course of 30 minutes for breakfast as a first meal.  After a few days, I work my way back to ""normal"" meals.    BTW, this kind of fasting and is a great way to determine what foods/drinks bother you as you add things back into your diet, one at a time.  Of course, you should see your own doctor and discuss if this protocol is appropriate for you.  *Note: And yes, you can get very very hungry and a little bit crazy, but if you're expecting it, you can deal with it.

And maybe get someone to pick you up and drive you to the hospital and back if you haven't done so already.   Try to stay hydrated even if you get bored of drinking so much fluid. Warm or hot chicken broth is pretty soothing I find. Popsicles and jello are nice because texturally they at least give you something to crunch and bite down on. If you aren't big on sports drinks, maybe add a sprinkle of salt and sugar to some water to help retain the water if you're having diarrhea.  And maybe avoid watching people eating and enjoying food. I think it can become difficult psychologically if you're not used to fasting. And the aroma of foods I think can also make you start salivating and make you feel hungrier because your body's preparing to eat...but no food. Not a lot of fun.  I hope you get some answers after your scope and can get on the road to recovery. Hang in there."

CrohnsDisease,3dfw53,UselessGadget,7,Thu Jul 16 12:52:19 2015 UTC,"Go with the Remicade. If it works for you, it is pretty much the best medicine out there for IBD. While it worked for me, it was the best! I felt almost normal for once. I don't have any experience with Methatrexate, but from what I have read, it is pretty hit or miss with IBD. Remicade has a far better reputation with Crohn's."
CrohnsDisease,3dfw53,rubberduckie1313,2,Wed Jul 15 23:38:05 2015 UTC,"What side effects did you see from the Remicade? My doctor is pushing Remicade/Humera right now and, frankly, I'm scared."
CrohnsDisease,3dfw53,justanavrgguy,2,Thu Jul 16 13:25:22 2015 UTC,"I tried Humira for about 6 months and it didn't help my Crohn's at all. The only real side effect I had on it was my hair would fall out in clumps. I understand this is a pretty common side effect for these types of medications. Remicade was amazing for about 3 months, then I got shingles and had to go off it for almost three months and it never really worked well after that. I also got a kidney infection while on Remicade, which are really common in my family so, I can't say whether or not I would have gotten it if I wasn't on the Remicade.  I'm on Cimzia now and it is amazing. I have had no side effects, except being a little tired after the shots and am feeling human again. I feel like I did before my diagnosis. I think biolgics can be an amazing tool, it is all about finding the right one for you. Don't be afraid of the them. If your quality of life right now is terrible with your Crohn's they can help you get into remission. Sure you are taking a chance, but if your life is being run by the disease, then the small chance of adverse side effects is totally worth it to get your life back."
CrohnsDisease,3dfw53,rubberduckie1313,6,Thu Jul 16 17:00:30 2015 UTC,"Pharmacy student here.   Remicade is an IV medication that you will get at week 0, week 2, week 6, and every 8 weeks after. You will have to go to an infusion clinic or hospital to have the infusion done. You can expect a TB test and blood work prior to treatment. Remicade can be pretty costly; however, some insurances can cover a good portion of the expense. Remi doesn't have a lot of the common side effects like nausea, vomiting, or headache but can make you more prone to infections. It's been out on the market since 1994 so docs have good data and experience with this drug.   Methotrexate is a subcutaneous (under the skin) injection that you will receive weekly. The nice thing about this drug is can get methotrexate at home, and you or a family member/friend can give the medication. Also, methotrexate is significantly cheaper than Remicade. You may have to go through more tests such as: liver & kidney function testing.  The drug is a chemo so you may have more of the nausea/vomiting along with the potential for more infections.   Both Remicade and methotrexate have proven effectiveness for Crohn's disease (per Crohn's guidelines from ACG). There isn't a lot of solid evidence on which is more effective. In an uncontrolled trial, Remi provided more healing than Methotrexate but this was only evaluated in 15 patients, which is not a good sample size. Also, there is the option to be on both Remi and Metho at the same time, but as proven in the COMMIT trial was no more effective than Remicade alone. I don't feel 100% comfortable in making a recommendation as I am just a student and have been Remicade in the past (the whole bias thing). If you have any questions, feel free to DM me. I hope this helps and that you get to feeling better soon!"
CrohnsDisease,3dfw53,lucas322,6,Thu Jul 16 02:07:02 2015 UTC,I take methotrexate by mouth FYI
CrohnsDisease,3dfw53,-missnyankitty,2,Thu Jul 16 02:42:02 2015 UTC,Remicade is King.
CrohnsDisease,3dfw53,blahcentral,2,Wed Jul 15 23:39:52 2015 UTC,"I did methotrexate by itself for a while. I hated it. It's a chemotherapy drug, and I definitely felt like I was on chemo when I took it.  I took Remicade for years and it was amazingly effective for me.  Some doctors used to prescribe methotrexate with Remicade to increase efficacy (I don't know if they still do).  When you meet with your doctor, ask him why he would suggest methotrexate. Maybe he uses Remicade as a last resort; maybe he has some other reason."
CrohnsDisease,3dfw53,birdmommy,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:37:34 2015 UTC,"I was on methotrexate by itself, Remicade by itself, methotrexate and humira, and now methotrexate and entyvio. The idea is that the methotrexate suppresses your immune system enough to keep your body from making antibodies to the Humira, Entyvio, or even Remicade. But like you I hate it.   To OP's question, I'd say to give Remicade a shot. It's a drug much more tailored to IBD while methotrexate is a more broad sweeping drug."
CrohnsDisease,3dfw53,ganxBice,2,Thu Jul 16 01:13:17 2015 UTC,"I take methatrexate by mouth. It seems to be helping, but I know I'll need to get on Humira/remicade to fully take care of it"

CrohnsDisease,3dfw53,-missnyankitty,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:42:31 2015 UTC,"I took methotrexate orally for my arthritis about 10 years ago, but it made my stomach go nuts so I started Enbrel, but switched to Humira when I was diagnosed with the Crohns. I'm unfortunately allergic to all the THF inhibitors, including Remicade. However, I took Remicade for 4 months and my symptoms were wonderfully managed (then my allergic reaction began and I stopped it). Also, Remicade was stupid expensive for me: I had no copay with Remicades financial assistantnce program, but it ran me about $1700 for each infusion (6 weeks after the initial build up) just in.hospital bills for the out-patient treatment)  I'm now taking methotrexate as an injection, and it is helping my arthritis a lot but doesn't seem to be doing much for the Crohns. I'm waiting for a GI appointment to see what else we can do, as any oral pills I've tried don't do shit and I'm out of injected options.  If you can afford it, I recommend taking the Remicade route. It's a bit inconvenient, and costly, but if you're not allergic to it I found it to be really helpful. Good luck!"

CrohnsDisease,3dfbj5,StarvingIsVerboten,2,Thu Jul 16 03:35:52 2015 UTC,"That is a very risky move because typically the argument of ""... well I already paid for it"" does absolutely nothing in terms of convincing them to grant you coverage for a treatment."

I think it's good to try to mentally prepare for the fasting itself (if it's new to you) and also for the news as well if it comes back conclusive for IBD. When I received news it was initially heartbreaking, but then I realized that it gave me a focus and let me know what was wrong so I could finally set to work on fixing it.

I'd suggest possibly thinking about using a biologic if it turns out to be IBD, but that's really a discussion for you and your GI to make. I think prednisone works well for a lot of people to get flairs under control, but it sure sucks developing osteoporosis when you're like 20 or 30.   In general you want to be on it for as short a duration as possible but also long enough to still get the strong anti-inflammatory properties of it to heal you up inside."
CrohnsDisease,3dfs7j,CountDraclicka,1 point,Thu Jul 16 07:19:41 2015 UTC,Crohn's Disease can manifest itself anywhere from your mouth to your anus. So if it's in the middle of your 20+ foot long small intestine no scope will see it. I know because that's where my Crohn's resides and only during emergency surgeries has the damage it causes been seen. I've had many colonoscopies and they are always normal.
CrohnsDisease,3df6je,Kuwago,17,Wed Jul 15 20:07:58 2015 UTC,"It's certainly not over-exaggerated. Maybe an individual sufferer could, theoretically, 'exaggerate' their symptoms. But in general, it's an incredibly painful set of symptoms with no known cause.   The diagnosis means you're having the same kinds of symptoms. Bleeding. Cramps. Pain. Inflamation. Bleeding, Cramps and Pain can be a sign that you have ulcers throughout your system. Your colon could be swelling, which can lead to a fatal condition called toxic megacolon.   The ulcers and system damage makes you more likely to get colon cancers. You end up taking medications to control the symptoms, but sometimes those cause their own complications. You may end up on different medicines, or end up taking additional medications to control the complications.  One solution, potentially, is to undergo major surgery and just have things removed. It doesn't always work. You end up with a baggy attached to yourself that carries your feces, which you need to empty every few hours.   And the worst part? Nobody knows what causes it. Not really. Maybe food. Maybe infection in the past. Maybe bad bacteriological colony. Nobody knows. You track your food, how often you go to the bathroom, what you're drinking, what you're doing, hoping to find correlations. If you're lucky, you find correlations that are mostly reliable, so that you don't flare up. If you're lucky, you find out simple things like, ""if I drink a beer, I will flare up. If I eat bread, I will flare up. If I have a nectarine, I will flare up."" Most of the time, you make these discoveries, and you change your diet and your patterns, and it all works ...  ... right up to the point where you end up with cramps, bleeding, pain, and you have to start all over again to figure out why. With the knowledge that, really, you're guessing about it.   Your doctor, if you're lucky, is really good. They know the latest medications, how to help you manage symptoms, they're good. They can recommend treatments, help you with elimination diets, help you sort it all out, but even then, they're guessing in a lot of ways. They're guessing with more expertise than you. But, just like you, the doctors aren't sure what causes it.  You explain to people, ""Well, it's not really fatal."" You're doing this partly because you want to keep a stiff upper lip. You want to be upbeat, because you're sick of feeling down. But it can be fatal, and you know it. It can also just be something you live with, for the next 40, 50, 60 years or more. You hope you have cool people around you. You hope that, oh no, you aren't about to poop your pants. You hope that you'll have a normal week.  Because, you remember, most likely, a normal life. One where you just sort of ate stuff, went to the bathroom a few times a day, and didn't have all this weird pain and stomach cramps. But that normal life is gone. It kind of comes back, if you're lucky, when you're on the medications. But it's never quite the same. You eventually learn to deal with it.  So, no, it's not over-exaggerated, not to the people who have it. The only people who think it's over-exaggerated tend to be, in my experience, assholes."
CrohnsDisease,3df6je,effdot,3,Wed Jul 15 21:20:49 2015 UTC,that was very well put. Thank you for putting into words how most of of feel that are suffering with it.
CrohnsDisease,3df6je,BootyMcSqueak,13,Thu Jul 16 04:15:23 2015 UTC,"Misunderstood. I have twice nearly died thanks to my crohns disease, and I'm talking dead within a day without major medical intervention. That was at the ages of 27 and 29 respectively. First was toxic megacolon, where you colon swells, haemorrhages, and leaks, causing death by internal bleeding or blood poisoning within a day. That was preceded by months and months of debilitating pain and diarrhoea - I'm talking shitting every 15 minutes, can't even get to work kind of diarrhoea. And the pain was eventually so bad I couldn't get up. The second near-death experience was thanks to the medications I was taking to control the disease, which landed me in hospital with a suppressed immune system and pneumonia. On top of that, I had to have a stoma bag for a year and a half.  I still shit the bed and myself fairly regularly, I still take meds that are bad for my health, I still keep emergency painkillers and pads around and I still sometimes have to deal with pain and urgency. If that was all it was, it'd be over exaggerated. But the fact is that this is the best it ever gets for me and I'm grateful my disease is now so stable in comparison to what I've suffered. I actually see this state of health as a good thing and I always understate the effects of my disease now because it's all totally manageable and I can live normally. I'm not complaining about a my grumbly tummy right now. I'm complaining about the times this disease nearly took my life, and all the pain and suffering I experienced at those time."

CrohnsDisease,3df6je,hTxMithras,9,Wed Jul 15 20:12:19 2015 UTC,"It appears you are here for information? What others said is true, it's not just tummy aches, it can be debilitating pain caused by heavy ulceration; malnutrition because you have to avoid certain foods, etc. There are multiple complications that can lead to death if not quickly treated, occlusion, perforation,... All these physical conditions affect you psyche, you avoid going out, you develop anxiety, etc...   And with the simple fact that 50% of those affected by Crohn's get surgery in the first 5 years, and up to 80% in the first 10 years (stats from my GI), I would say it's definitely not an over-exaggeration."

Skin cancer is usually pretty easily cured while other cancers will kill you in weeks. So there is a huge gradient for all illnesses from best case to worst. Crohn's I find can be and is often misunderstood. Many times people mistake it to being similar to IBS. Which it has nothing to do with. I have yet to meet anyone who over exaggerated their Crohn's. Often times we minimize our symptoms to not bother others. We hide our pain, and since often times we also look ""normal"" on the outside. Most people are none the wiser. But, with 20 years of having this disease and 4 surgeries later. I can't recall a time I haven't had pain. I am now disabled because of it. My father-in-law died because of his Crohn's at 49. I have known others who have died because of it. When women with Crohn's had said giving birth without meds as not a fraction of the pain they have because of their Crohn's, that can give an idea of what many of us deal with daily. Misunderstood, easily."

CrohnsDisease,3deh35,blahcentral,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:13:47 2015 UTC,"The highest dose I had was 1 pen every week,  That worked for a few months, but eventually I was losing the effect before the end of the week.  At that point I switched to Cimzia, and that has been working reasonably well at the 1 pen/2 weeks dosage.  If you were on Remicade before and then stopped to go on Humira, then you can't really go back.  The break in between allowed anti-bodies to develop so Remicade will be useless to you.  But Cimzia or one of the other biologics should work well."

CrohnsDisease,3deh35,derpalamadingdong,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:56:11 2015 UTC,For sure.  Yeah this dosing schedule seems odd to me.  Somethings gotta give here.
CrohnsDisease,3deh35,TheyKilledKenni,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:20:01 2015 UTC,"I don't think there is data available for the 2x/weekly dose but I am currently doing that dose and have been doing it for a few months now. My GI also told me he's had other patients using the same dose scheduling.  I don't think Humira is working for me even at this quadruple dose.  I really, really want to switch to a new biologic (I am continuing to lose weight and I am very, very weak) but my GI wants to do a scope first to confirm that my suspicions of the Humira not working are true.  As far as safety goes, I think different people metabolize (their body gets rid of the Humira quickly) at different rates. I believe there is a blood test available in Canada to check your serum level of Humira, to see how quickly your body is clearing the Humira out. If you are one of the people that clear Humira out of your system quickly, I'm not sure it would be any more dangerous to you than it is to someone taking 1 dose of Humira every 2 weeks whom doesn't clear the Humira out near as quickly. At least this is how I interpreted what my GI said to me to calm my fears about the quadruple dosing.  All that said, I think there isn't a ton of data out there available, if any, and myself and other people using it at this dosing level may be more anecdotal than anything.  I'm hoping to restart Remicade (I only did the initial dosing of it once), or Cimzia, or Entyvio.   For what it's worth, I'm also taking Methotrexate, and unless my liver enzyme panels come back as elevated I think I'll stay on the Methotrexate even if I switch out the biologic for a different one."

CrohnsDisease,3db9s0,kenyawins,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:26:53 2015 UTC,You should absolutely consult with a lawyer. My mom had a part of her liver removed a few years back and the resident that closed left a surgical fish behind which caused her months of pain and illness until it was found through another surgery. She sued for medical malpractice and got compensation from the hospital. It was a long-ish and pretty emotional problem for her (considering how much it affected her standard of living) but in the end it was definitely worth it both financially and in helping her come to terms with it. I hope you find a solution that helps you!
CrohnsDisease,3db9s0,StarvingIsVerboten,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:29:20 2015 UTC,"Yes, leaving something like that inside a patient during surgery is a clear case of malpractice. It can even be fatal in many cases, OP is lucky to be alive.  That also would make me wary of ever going back to that hospital again. Every OR should be operated with a clear accounting of all surgical supplies to make sure everything that went in came back out again.

Hence, the sudden second-guessing of my academic pursuits.  I'll say this about grad school (disclaimer: anecdotal evidence ahead): a master's is a pretty solid investment especially if you get a fully-funded position.

Mostly because I like being a lawyer, it's a very good job for me.  Also, the job offers me the flexibility I wouldn't have in almost any other position.  Today, I spent the first two hours of my day laying down on the floor of my office because I felt too sick to sit at my desk.  I get to take days off when I don't feel up to the task, and while my income has definitely taken a hit because I can't work as much as I would like, I still make a very comfortable living.    I'm not saying you should carry on, and that trucking through it is the best option for you.  That's your decision.  But for me, I'm glad I did what I thought I couldn't do, because it has given me a much nicer life than I had before.  If the phd is a waste of your time, fuck it.  But I encourage you not to let your CD set the course of your life any more than you have to."

Mostly because I like being a lawyer   That's as good a reason as any to keep ""trucking through"" and that's awesome that worked out for you. I've totally abandoned the idea of becoming a professor (there' aren't jobs). The price of admission nowadays to a tenure-track position is 2-3 (or more) years as a postdoc, at least that's what's becoming typical in my field, and that isn't appealing at all to me anymore.  Basically the PhD, for me, is a ""labor of love"" and lately it's a hell of a lot of labor for very little love.  Wasn't necessarily brought on my CD, if anything it was more of a catalyst that accelerated massive grad school burnout (there were some other pretty significant contributing factors, but that's the gist of it).

I thought about going that route towards the end of undergrad, and after speaking with a couple of my profs I decided I didn't have it in me.    One thing to keep in mind is the unearned deference a phd will get you.  Lawyers, doctors, and phd's are all given a lot of respect, accomodation, and latitude in our society.  And even if the phd won't have practical benefits for your career, it may help you in other ways.  Being a lawyer has definitely changed how others perceive me, and changed what people invite me to do, and let me get away with (not friends, but people I've networked with professionally).  Whether or not it's deserved, having the credentials I have changed my position in society, having a phd would likely lead to similar results.    People judge books by their cover, having a phd on your cover may make people judge you more favorably."

I said that some people who have a literal semi-colon get that tatood and she got angry, basically saying that it was taking the piss out of mental illness.

It's a humorously literal representation about the fact that we are missing part of our colons.  What makes me mad about it is the attitude so many of them have towards us just wanting recognition that it was ours first.  A lot of us have mental issues because of what we go through with the IBD... we get it.  The people who are getting defensive seem to have this pity party thing where their depression is absolutely worse than any physical illness and physically sick people just ""don't understand"" the type of pain they go through.  Yeah, I replied to some of them too, unfortunately.  Blockity block block.  I shit blood.  I'm sad about that.  Just because I know WHY I'm sad doesn't make my depression less valid.

They'll ask what molecule it is at the ER and I'll explain... it usually receives a response like, ""Smart, of course you smoke pot.  Keep smoking pot.  If you go home and still feel sick, smoke some pot.  It's fine on top of the pain meds.""  I've only ever had a nurse say something shitty about it and the doctor gave me an extra dose of dilaudid just to piss her off.

Is living to 80 really that great if you were too sick to do anything most of your life?

I'd go with an abdominal binder, not a back brace. They feel very different, and I think if your abdomen is more comfortable you'll be able to deal with your back.  Don't worry too much.

She called up her old doc (who we love and explicitly trust) and he gave her a list of potential alternatives, which she then called up her insurance to cross reference, and the final list contained Asacol HD ($407/mo), Lialda ($453/mo), and Delzicol ($171/mo).  Also sulfalazine (only $14/mo) but the doc said it was a last resort and he didn't think it would be right for her."

(I also found a ludicrous $150/pill for the 4 gram pills!)  If you are uncertain about going the mail-order route, there are various ""drug coupon"" deals out there, as well. The groups behind these basically committed to buy a certain amount of a given drug, and by using their coupon at a local participating pharmacy you are taking advantage of their ability to cut large deals with the manufacturer. I will probably go this route myself to buy my methotrexate."

CrohnsDisease,3da53g,CyborgPrincess,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:12:37 2015 UTC,"My takedown surgery went infinitely better than my actual creation surgery.   My advice is to start doing kegels to strengthen your sphincter. After six years of no use the muscle deterioration might cause problems post-surgery.   Lay off the pain meds after the takedown. I actually didn't take any, and thus had my first bowel movement the second day, went home on the fourth (the third day was a Sunday so I couldn't have been discharged.)   Your first poop WILL be weird. The first six months you WILL have accidents. Not like, major ones, but a tiny bit of leakage. It's been three years and only now have I finally been able to get that poop-clenching ability back. My advice? Take a fresh pair of undies wherever you go.   The actual surgery part was fine. My stitches were taken out a week later, and the scar faded to a pale pink/white. The area of the scar is slightly numb and if I eat too much cold stuff, it turns cold too. My butt totally got back into action, though. It knows what it's supposed to do. :)"

My doctor is also not concerned about my muscles- in fact so far he's said that the sphincter muscle is too tight now and he'd have to snip a bit of it when they reconnected everything.  But that just makes me more worried about incontinence.  :\  It makes me nervous that it's taken you three years to get back to normal, but that does seem to be the case with a lot of stories I've read.  I just don't know if I want to go back to that way of living, even if it's temporary.  As you can probably tell, I'm really on the fence about this, lol.

But if you are getting a J Pouch your experience will probably be different. I hear about alot of satisfied people with J Pouches. I dont have a J Pouch, and my experience was horrible. In fact life was better with the ileostomy. With the ileostomy the worst thing I would have is some irritation around the wafer. Since getting connected to my rectum I flared up instantly and grabbed a whole new plate of symptoms. I got two fistulas, take about 30 BMs a day, got arthritis, lost a bunch of weight, and became anemic. Ive been going on like this for a little over 6 months. I have been taking Humira and I already failed Remicade, in between all these medications I will take a big cycle of prednisone once in a while to keep me alive enough to keep trying these biologics. I am in the process of switching to Entyvio. But my health is steadily diminishing. Once I hit a certain point I am going to have to have my rectum removed and have a permanent ileostomy."

Two questions you will probably want to ask: will this be reversible? Are you a candidate for a j-pouch? Some surgeons do not do j-pouches for Crohn's patients. If you are not a candidate for a j-pouch, it's definitely worth trying to find a doctor who will let you keep your poohole operational. [edit: typos]"

CrohnsDisease,3d7jrp,galindobrandon,2,Tue Jul 14 04:15:50 2015 UTC,Yes! Walk around the hospital with a friend or nurse. It helps the healing process. Since you got an Ostomy placed like I do. Make sure you keep a close eye on your output and drink loads of water. Like a stupid amount. They will tell you the same. Make sure to start a trial and error battle with your bags as well. Make sure they don't give you a rash or leak. It takes time to find that one perfect bag. Call some Ostomy suppliers as well. They give free samples of different bags. It helped when I got home cause I had 3 boxes of different supples from 3 different supplier and it comes with everything you need to make a good choice.  Take your meds on time when you get home. Try not to forget like I do. Pain meds are helpful as well. Don't be afraid to take them. I was when I started and was in pain all the time because I was given two types of strong pain meds. I didn't wanna abuse it.  And lastly. Just take your time transitioning into going home. You might be bed ridden for a while but do try to walk a bit and go outside to get sun. The sun helps and you don't wanna be inside all day. Oh and don't feel weird about showering with it on. I usually take it off. But I did try wrapping my bag and everything. I'd honestly just shower With it off when you can to clean that entire site so it doesn't get gross cause it will.   Hope you recover fast!

CrohnsDisease,3d7lf6,thesubmissivesiren,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:30:26 2015 UTC,I've got the slow healing. it does seem to take long for just scratches to heal and when I got poison ivy it took forever to clear up. but I've not dealt with much of the rest. I've only experienced the IV pain once so I couldn't really attribute it to anything specific. I don't really think it was related to a Remicade side effect.
CrohnsDisease,3d5o59,CallMeDoc24,5,Mon Jul 13 18:48:05 2015 UTC,"This is my personal experience and it might not apply to you, but since this seems to be what you're asking for I will share.  My opinion is that you should always be trying to stay in remission even if your active disease state isn't unlivable. Inflammation can cause permanent damage in the form of scar tissue which can then cause constant pain and even something like a stricture or obstruction which requires surgery to fix. I have constant pretty severe pain because it took me 3 years to get my inflammation under something resembling control even though I was able to keep working and functioning fairly normally most of that time.  Also, not to be pessimistic, but it can take a while to find a drug that works for you. Those 3 years it took to get my inflammation down weren't spent just sitting on my hands. I had to go through all the pill options, Remicade, Cimzia, and two trials before Entyvio was found to work. If you have bad luck as I did you might want to start the quest for the right medication as early as possible.  Now, that's just my opinion and I have the benefit of hindsight into my own situation. I know it's a hard decision. These biologics aren't ""healthy"" for you. Not to mention the hassle and the cost of them.  Another thing to keep in mind is that once you start a biologic I really really really recommend not stopping it as long as it continues to work. It's possible, even likely, to develop antibodies to any of the biologics once you stop it (kind of the way a vaccine works. While you're on the biologic you don't have as high a chance of developing antibodies because the biologic is suppressing your immune system, but once you stop it your immune system can ""learn"" and keep it from working in the future) and that would prevent it from ever working for you again. It's not a 100% sure thing that you'll develop the antibodies and it's possible to decrease the chance by putting you on a different immunosuppressant for a few weeks/months while you come off the biologic, but just keep it in mind. A biologic is kind of a forever thing. But IBD is a forever thing so hopefully that's a mindset you're already in.  That's my two cents. And your disease is different from my disease so take the advice for what it is: my experience. I hope it helps."
CrohnsDisease,3d5o59,PenelopePeril,2,Mon Jul 13 19:49:27 2015 UTC,"My case seems fairly similar to yours, mild to moderate crohn's (personally I'm moderate), symptoms suck but nothing dangerous, just lots of pain, diarreha, and other fun symptoms.  This being said, I tried humira for 6 or 7 months to no real effect. I didn't like it, it didn't help. I switched to budesonide and methotrexate and that is helping some.   The drugs act differently towards everyone though. Side effects of meds don't seem to be horrible for me unless I'm on prednisone. So really, if you think it's worth trying it is. It's a strong drug, safer in comparison to some others, but of course has its negatives. Just inform yourself as much as you can and make your decision.   I hope you got something from this jumble of thoughts."
CrohnsDisease,3d5o59,The_Lemon_Law,2,Mon Jul 13 19:54:58 2015 UTC,I believe it is best to keep trying all the medications before its too late. What I mean by that is you will become more and more fed up and your condition could get worse and worse. You have to keep trying to get into remission while it does not stop you from being productive. I am still trying all the different medications to try and get into remission. I pretty much view this battle with Crohn's as a fight to keep as much of my insides as possible.  When trying Humira I did not get a single negative side effect. As a matter of fact I didnt get a single positive side effect either. It just didnt work for me. But I just got to keep trying. I recommend you try Humira.

I'm not going to regrow my colon. I'm never going to stop taking cholestyramine. I'm probably never going to get over the pain and fatigue.    At the same time, while I recognize that my raw material is of much lower quality than what I started with, there's still stuff I can do with my life to make it worthwhile. I just can't pretend that there's as much stuff, or that I don't grieve the stuff I can't do.   As for bitterness -- like everything about this disease, eventually you get used to it. I don't notice it, at least not until I bump up against some listicle author's militant optimism."

I know I'm not the only person here (and this video is definitely indicative of this) who deals with this disease through humor. I always tell people, don't be too timid, don't beat around the bush. I live with this disease, I've accepted it, you can ask me whatever you want. But also be sensitive. Don't bitch and moan when I say I can't eat something or downplay my pain. There's a healthy medium between sensitivity and realism. Usually that medium is humor.

CrohnsDisease,3d59qd,badwolf1985,2,Mon Jul 13 18:58:58 2015 UTC,"Vomiting is my main visible symptom. The last 30cm of my small bowel is scarred up from inflammation and if I don't chew enough sometimes or eat too fast a piece gets partially stuck and everything backs up. (Also stress causes everything to lock up for me too).  This causes pain in the upper centre of my abdomen. Usually laying down on my front or side for a while helps get everything going again. If it's worse I either vomit naturally or I psyche myself up/ make myself vomit.  If neither of those things help then I have to go to A&E and get IV steroids to calm everything down.  If you are able to keep fluids down and keep your medication down (assuming you have oral medication) then you should be ok. If not then you need to go to hospital.  During pain and vomiting times, it's a good idea to eat foods that aren't overly solid and drink as much fluid as you can handle. (My go-to foods are monster munch and lucozade energy drink, but you'll find your own favourites.)   Vomiting seems to be uncommon here from what I've seen. Remember that you know your illness best, we're all different."

CrohnsDisease,3d59qd,ianthenerd,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:06:21 2015 UTC,"""Normal"" is relative for us. For me, vomiting is normal if I have a migraine. I also vomit as a response to a lot of stomach pain. Like my brain thinks ""Oh, you hurt? Probably should dry heave a bit, that'll fix you right up.""  If your IBD presents in the upper GI or stomach then vomiting is a ""normal"" symptom for you, too. Some people even have bloody vomit as a ""normal"" thing, the way some of us have bloody diarrhea as a ""normal"" thing.  However, if you don't know what's normal yet you should keep an eye on it. Do you have a fever? Once I had a fever with chills and was vomiting intermittently for a week before I got checked out. Turns out I had a kidney infection and it was pretty serious. Took 3 days and IV antibiotics to clear it up in the hospital.  So, it's really dependent on your symptoms and it's only something you can figure out with time. If you're ever in doubt, though, go to the doctor/hospital. Much better to be safe than sorry when it comes to your health. I know it's a chore and maybe expensive and you need to take all that into account, but if I had waited much longer during that kidney infection thing I could've died and that's terrifying to think about."

CrohnsDisease,3d5u82,Adama70,2,Mon Jul 13 19:29:50 2015 UTC,"What exactly is swollen? Typically erythema nodosum is tender and painful at the location of the rash, generally on the anterior shins. The treatment for IBD associated EN is generally to treat the IBD and it symptomatically improves. This might suggest either your IBD is not controlled or an alternate diagnosis. Did anyone examine you and consider a DVT (blood clot)?"
CrohnsDisease,3d5u82,johnnythehack,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:57:37 2015 UTC,"Yes it was initially diagnosed as a blood clot however the other symptoms, nerve pain, and both of my shins had large red spots lead my doctor to change the diagnosis.  I had two ultrasounds, that showed no clot, before they changed the diagnosis.  I have not had swelling at all until today, but to be honest I was on my feet more yesterday than I have been in a long time.  My primary symptoms are redness, or rash, It really looks and feels like a localized sunburn.  I also have this migrating nerve pain, it moves around but its mostly in my knees, ankles, hips and the bottom of my feet. If I stay at or above the 15mg / day of prednisone the redness is very much reduced, and the pain is not as severe.   I guess my biggest frustration is that it had calmed down quite a bit last week, and now has gone backwards, and I'm in a fair amount of pain again.  Not to mention going a little stir crazy."

I quit my job (it was just a table waiting job in high school so not a huge deal) and had to drop out of pretty much everything I was involved in. Something worth noting is that I was flaring pretty severely at the time and the only thing I was taking for the pain was ibuprofen.  I would take your doctor's advice and not push yourself too far or introduce a drug like Humira into your system for something that is temporary. Erythema nodosum is definitely hell, but I do think you will start seeing improvement soon and get back to your life!"

I just tried Otezla and quit after 5 weeks because it aggravated my intestines  A LOT!   I am also having a hard time finding the right medication that will both control my Crohn's and psoriasis but still allow me to have children. I don't know if this will be reassuring or not, but I did not have psoriasis at all while on Humira, but it didn't work for my Crohn's, so here I am with psoriasis and Crohn's. However, Humira works very well for many people and it is a very good alternative to Remicade, I just have a particularly picky body.  Your wife's psoriasis sounds a lot worse than mine, but I can definitely empathize with the frustrations involved with the whole situation.  I have a Dermatologist appt tomorrow morning that I have a feeling I will leave in tears. I don't really have any good options left to control either disease unless I forego having children for the next several years.  What I have found that helps a bit is taking benadryl daily, and as one of my pre-meds when I get remicade. I take 50 mg before my infusion, at bedtime the night of my infusion, and at bedtime for 4 days after that. I regularly take 25 mg of benadryl at bedtime every day. I also get a strong dose of solu-medrol with my remicade infusion.   I also get systemic (in my butt muscle) cortisone shots from the dermatologist every 8-10 weeks, which help more than topical meds do for me.

With the derm we tried every topical steroid, oral steroids and nothing would help. To be honest coconut oil and aqufor at least made them feel better but it didn't help them heal any.   They just sort of went away after about a year. My crohns didn't get any better  but the spots went away. About a year later I ended up going of cimzia because of antibody build up. I will occasionally have a small spot show up when stressed. I hope the same happens to your wife.  If your wife can't find any relief physically, some therapy to deal with all this shit is important. I got really depressed because I felt like this disease was finally taking away everything I had left. Even if the psoriasis does get better therapy is really important for people like us.

CrohnsDisease,3d14j6,jacq_willow,3,Sun Jul 12 21:35:37 2015 UTC,"Hey, I can totally relate to you. When I was younger(middle school) and my brother was in college, we would fight alot. Sometimes for fun, othertimes because he was annoying and pissed me off. He would always win. He was stronger, older, smarter, and more mature. As a young kid, this stuff really started annoying me, because, well, I could never win.  So, a few times, I resorted to insults similiar to the one you described. They really hurt. Despite the instant gratification I got from ""winning"", however, I always regretted it a few hours later. I don't think I ever said sorry.  Fast foward a few years, and I'm in Highschool. It's a particularly stressful year (Junior Year) and halfway through it I'm diagnosed with Crohn's.  Karma, bitch.  Even before my diagnosis I slowly grew to understand what he was struggling with, though it became extremely clearer in the months before and after my diagnosis.  You just have to remember that he may not mean everything he says/doesn't totally understand the hardship you are going through and he may just be attacking you personally for other reasons.   That's just my 2cents."

CrohnsDisease,3d2apc,nycuc2,1 point,Mon Jul 13 01:12:32 2015 UTC,"No prednisone at all. They put me on Humira from the start because I didn't want any cortisons in me. And the next drug that they would normally put me on would kill me. They checked my DNA and I have 2 mutations so I would suffer blood poisoning if I took those pills (maybe those are the prednisones?).  I got a kickstart of Humira (4 injections, 2 weeks later 2 injections) and that took all the symptoms away right from the start. From there on I take 1 injection every 2 weeks and I seem to not have any problems so far.  What do you mean with I thought it was supposed to help with the D? English is not my mothertongue maybe that's why :)"

CrohnsDisease,3cws7y,Ereshh,0,Sun Jul 12 18:50:38 2015 UTC,"Now there is testing available by Cyrex Labs to test the combined IgA and IgG, which is potentially a more accurate blood test for food reactivity and is reproducible.link   Also this site has more information on testing.    Assaying in duplicate. We perform each test in duplicate samples; the probability of having the same error occur in replicate samples simultaneously is close to zero. In the protocol used at Cyrex, when samples correlate within plus or minus 20%, then the results are reported. If the samples do not correlate, the assay will be repeated with replicate samples until there is correlation within the same run, and only then will those results be reported.  Utilizing pure antigens. To achieve good reproducibility, laboratories must use absolutely pure antigens in the ELISA evaluation. Consider the example of measuring antibodies against broccoli: many labs either purchase broccoli powder or prepare a sample medium themselves in the lab by emulsifying broccoli in a food processor. The problem is that there are many inhibitors in either type of testing medium, including numerous enzymes, and large and small molecules. None of these substances are relevant to the protein in broccoli. As a result, tests using impure antigens frequently produce false positives and false negatives. To achieve reproducible results, the protein in broccoli must be extracted and purified in order to measure antibody activity against that particular protein.  Testing for both IgG and IgA. In the past, testing for delayed food sensitivity was offered only in IgG. From a scientific perspective, the combined IgA and IgG evaluation is potentially a more accurate blood test for food reactivity, with greater reproducibility. Double-blind research studies have shown that labs do not always demonstrate good reproducibility in IgG food testing. At Cyrex, we decided from both a scientific and a management perspective to combine the two tests and provide both for one value.   I'm not convinced one way or the other but I wouldn't call it quackery just yet."

CrohnsDisease,3cws7y,squeakstar,2,Sat Jul 11 18:19:40 2015 UTC,"I feel you man/woman. It's been 7 years now that my life is how you described.  I don't have any issues with diarrhea, it's just as you say, the constant pain...   I eat the same things all the time. To be honest i fairly eat almost everything, except anything spicy. Because In 7 years I have found nothing in particular that triggers my flare.   Even once, I went to a party. And it was some people that didn't know I had Crohn, and they made a ""General Surprise Meal"", something with Hot pepper...I didn't know. I ate it. My mouth was on fire. I just thought ""ok, incoming pain for weeks"". And you know what... nothing at all... everything was fine.  When i suffer a lot, people just automatically ask me ""what did you eat? you should care more"". Always and always and always. And it really destroy my mood. I keep telling everyone it's not the food. And they keep telling me ""Stop eating that, or that or that"" ""it's your fault for not paying attention on your foods""  This Is When I Could Be A Murderer.  Why should i stop to eat something i like if i know that foods isnt the problems? Crohn has already fucked up my life. I wont restrain me further than necessary. What is the point to avoid some food if it dont alter my health at all.  But the general conception of our disease, is that food is the sole purpose of our bad health. I cant blame them. They dont know. They never know until they experience it.  But i'm 100% sure, that for me it's not food, or rather not the ""kind"" of food I eat. My thoughts is that anything passing throught my intestins will hurt me. Because the inflamation is already here. But it's not the food that triggered the inflamation.  Concerning my medications. Since i don't have diarrhea, but just pain, the doctor prefers to give me light medications instead of hard medications (like remicade). So in 7 years i already tried Pentasa, Entocort, Pred, Imurel. All of thoses can keep my pain at a range of low to mid level pain. Without them I have much more pain. So for him it seems to be ok. it's Better to deal with some low-mid level pain, than taking the risk of hard medications. If i can deal with it it's ok.  And that is my life. I deal with it. I deal with the pain.   But man. You know. Low-mid level pain, constantly, for 7 years, is not something i really enjoyed. Sometimes the pain rises, for several days, weeks. I consider that my ""flare"". And as i say. it's Not food. If only i could isolate what triggers those hard pain. My life would be much more easier.  My guess is that it has something to do with Emotions. Stress, Anger, Anxiety, Depression.  I had a stressfull job for 5 years. I just quit it to see how it would works. For 6 months i was jobless, and i decided to stop medications. it was more or less ok. My pain was as normal as everyday (low -mid level pain)... And suprinsingly it was without Pred. So i guess Stress has an impact after all.  But then again, after 6 months, the pain rose again, my health worsen. Flare time. I can't tell what triggered it. I really can't.   And dont ask me to think what i did wrong. Because, that is what i do all day long, every day, and that for 7 years.  At First it was : ""what did i eat?"" Then it was : ""what did i do wrong"" (sleep? work? dispute? anger? being distress? sport?) Then it was : ""maybe it's because the sky is grey, maybe it's because i watch tv while texting, maybe it's because i eat with my left hand instead of my right hand, maybe it's because my car is green"" (you know where it's going...) And at last, after 7 years it is : ""...""   Yeah. I stopped posing me questions. I'm done.  But At least i tried. I tried to clear my mind, to spend my life free of stress, and free of medications. But how to deal with everything else. How to know to which extent any emotions could impact on my disease. On my Pain. Not to forget that it's not 100% sure that it is the trigger of my flares.  So, i went back to medication. I'm currently on Pred. And i have to deal with pain everyday.   Since i had crohn, i never knew a day free of pain.  Except when i was on Imurel.   Paradise On Earth.  No more pain in my belly, for a week. I dont remember what it's like to have a day without pain, but i do remember those days were orgasmic.  But unfortunately, there was too much sides effects... (inflamation of my pancrea, and knees. I couldln't walk anymore)  Life Is Not Fair At All.  So, back to the present, I'm on Pred. It maintains my pain to a stable state. But never delete it from my life. It's a ""pseudo-remission"" state.  But since it's Low-Mid level pain, i think i can deal with it somehow. When the flare comes, i have to take a higher dose of pred, and just wait.   That Is My Treatment.  Problem is, that my flare are much longer than my ""pseudo-remission"" Time. And in the long term, I'm losing weight. Too much. Because I Can't eat at all when I have thoses flares, the pain is too high. I spend weeks eating just...just... well actually almost nothing.   And when my health is better, when the Pain is OKAY, I eat eat eat as much as i can, but i cant catch up with the weight i lost since the last flare... and then another flare comes.   This Is The Best Diet Plan. I Assure You. 100%.  So, what am i to do now. Constant Pain. Constant Fatigue. Constant Weight Loss. I'm Physically and Pyschologically Tired. My Medical treatment is working somehow. I can't Denied it. Pred allows me to Maintain Low to Mid level Pain, and to bring down back my inflamation when the flare comes. But the Real problem is that my flare are much more longer than my ""Pseudo-Remission"" Time. In a long term run, It's ruining my life.  So I don't know what to do anymore.  Should i Stay on Pred, Deal with the pain all my life And pray that my flare will be less frequent... the Head on your shoulder Path.  Or Should I Start something Harder, like remicade? And take the risk of multiple sides effects... and the risk that it doesn't work at all... the Risky Path.  I'm not a fan. It's like Cutting off an arm just because one finger hurts. I'd rather Endure the pain, and keep my hand, than losing it.  Back to the topic,  ""I am jealous of you guys who can avoid symptoms by avoiding food triggers""   You perfectly summarize my thoughts.   For some people it's food. For us it has to be state of mind.  But then again, how to deal with it?  Should We Get Rid Of Our Emotions?  Should I Get Rid Of My Humanity? -"

My concern is that with our contant pain, something must be causing that. And my imaging showed inflammation. I always though the goal was to have no inflammation-- I asked my dr about it and he said if I'm feeling ok otherwise, some inflammation is ok. I told him I was still experiencing symptoms and he was like, ""oh, well that's not good."" We're meeting to discuss biologics next week.

And truth be told, the inflamations are always ""minors"" compare to other crohn's patient.  That's the reason why (+ the fact that Pred works to some extent) my doctor prefers not to give me biologics or injection, and let me on Pred. Because the inflamation is not that bad.  Even if the pain is real. I don't imagine it.  Then again I'm the one to choose.  But, I had bad experiences with hard treatments. Sides effects hit me hard. Seems like i have a weak body overall, so it may be preferable to stay on easy pill like Pred. It take times to bring down the inflamation but it works. And bringing down the inflamation always eases up my pain too. Even if it never disappears completely. Sadly.  But dont worry. Everyone is different. I have bad luck with sides effects, and i may be stuck on Pred (and it works more or less anyway) but I hope it wont be the same for you.   I hope you find something that can erase your pain.

Now I'm on Azathioprine too and I've been able to introduce some other foods and have a semi-normal diet. Every once in a while I'll either go too far or have something that I definitely shouldn't have and it'll result in 4-24 hours of contraction like cramps! Most weeks in a month I'll have naps in the afternoon, the good weeks are those when I get 3-4 days of feeling normal. Unfortunately when I get those days I suddenly think I'm cured and my diet goes out the window. Every. Time."
CrohnsDisease,3cws7y,Loliepopp79,1 point,Sun Jul 12 17:52:56 2015 UTC,"Wow, this sounds exactly like me. Although I still haven't incorporated veggies back into my diet, the other week I tried having some asparagus and a small potato with skin and my guts did not like that. Do you ever wonder if moving up to a biologic would help you to feel like your ""normal"" days all the time? This is my hope."

I was recently bought this book for my birthday and one thing is recommends is a liquid diet as one of the most successful ways of achieving full remission. So I think my next move will probably be that, rather than ever increasingly strong meds!"
CrohnsDisease,3cws7y,Stargirl63,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:05:10 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry for you man... :( I had trouble at first since basically everything can be a trigger during a flare but I worked my way up. Starting with a sure thing : boiled eggs. I ate boiled eggs exclusively for days and tried one new thing at a time. I still discover new bad food once in a while after 7 years. And even ""good"" food can become ""bad"". That's a sign something is up.  Also, I'm sorry to say this but you indeed, never going to be your back old self again. I got over it after I mourned alcohol and cheese for a while. Also running. Not during a flare but when everything is cool for a day or two. It helps my bowel to get some regulation and small phantom pain here and here seems to disappear.  Don't stop trying and don't try to stop the meds too soon. If you think you feel good, wait another month or two.  Good luck pal!"
CrohnsDisease,3cws7y,MonkeyCatDog,1 point,Sun Jul 19 09:42:57 2015 UTC,"Have you tried an actual elimination diet and then gradually tried re-adding foods?   I was blaming all sorts of food before I was diagnosed, but was still eating all sorts so could have been consuming multiple triggers all the time. Check out Auto Immune Paleo (AIP) diet or SCD as examples of diets to help (your mileage may vary) control symptoms."
CrohnsDisease,3cws7y,Dayum-Dayum-Dayum,1 point,Sat Jul 11 14:01:43 2015 UTC,"You should definitely try scd if you haven't yet. It is difficult at first, since the best way to do it is to start with only a few foods and add stuff in as you improve, but it's what worked for me."

CrohnsDisease,3cw324,DoomGiver32,4,Sat Jul 11 06:54:33 2015 UTC,Congrats! Having someone who will be supportive is a huge help!
CrohnsDisease,3cw324,birdmommy,2,Sat Jul 11 10:57:43 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it is. The lack of that support is what triggered my first flare-up, it's real nice to have it back after some-odd years of this. :)"
CrohnsDisease,3cw324,Luckyxstarx13,3,Sat Jul 11 15:17:46 2015 UTC,So happy you have someone. My husband and I started dated two months before I got diagnosed. But I had been having symptoms for two years prior. Just not as severe as they are now. He stuck by me and supported me though everything. We now have a 7 month old baby boy who is now my soul reason why I get up and fight this every day.
CrohnsDisease,3cw324,mrslinclon,2,Sat Jul 11 11:24:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah the biggest issue for me is the getting out of bed to fight. Well. was.  Not sure how long it'll last, but I'm sure glad it's here while it is. At this point, I'm happy to live each day one at a time. :)"
CrohnsDisease,3cw324,tardisbakerstreet,2,Sat Jul 11 15:16:55 2015 UTC,"It isn't off topic at all!  This disease impacts all aspects of your life.  My symptoms, I'm sure, were hastened by attending college and becoming a nurse, while working part-time.  I was stressed.  It didn't help that I was in my late 40s and musical husband and I were living with his parents.  I am so happy you have someone to support you and celebrate when things go well.  Things going well can be stressful also."

It's really nice to have someone to be here for me, and more importantly, have someone I can be there for. And yes, things going well can be stressful. I had that today... :P"
CrohnsDisease,3cw324,Adama70,2,Sun Jul 12 05:33:02 2015 UTC,"That's awesome!! My best friend and I have been together for over a year, though we've had major downs recently that almost stressed me into a trigger.  I get anxiety like crazy sometimes, which obviously can trigger flares, and when I feel like I might flare, I stress more. He's the only one who can calm me down.   Point of the rambling is...that's totally ON topic and love can be the best medicine!!"
CrohnsDisease,3cv2gu,katrionatronica,4,Sat Jul 11 00:38:21 2015 UTC,"How long have you been living together? Moving in together is one of the most stressful periods of a relationship / marriage. And thats for normal people with normal lives. Add buying a house / moving into the equation and the stress compounds. Plus what sounds like a stressful job on his part (it might be easy, but the sun can be incredibly draining). Then on top of all that, he has to learn to deal with your physical and mental health, which it sounds like you have already dealt with, grieved for, and so forth. I'm not surprised he seems to be floundering - that would be a lot to take in.  If he's willing it might be good for him to see a counselor, even if it's just one or two sessions to get a 3rd party perspective.   And on the other side of the coin, he might just be more vocal than you're used to about his frustrations. Us Crohnies often get used to biting the bullet and suffering in silence. You might just not be aware of how he copes - it might not mean he's throwing in the towel, just that at that moment in time he is exhausted.   And finally, you are depressed. I've been there; along with being a newlywed at that and it's sucks balls. Your mind my be fucking with your perception of the situation. I took almost everything my husband said personally when I was depressed. It was awful. In reality, he loved me and supported me, but I thought I was becoming a burden. That's what depression does. It tricks you into negativity.   TL;DR: Talk to him. He might not be as stressed as he appears to you. And if he is, there are steps you can take to get a handle on coping mechanisms. You're both humans who have to learn to live with the disease. Be honest with each other and learn together. <3"
CrohnsDisease,3cv2gu,semi__colon,1 point,Sat Jul 11 04:43:00 2015 UTC,"We've been living together for a year and a half. But currently there is a fair storm of stress circling my husband. And you have a damn good point about crohnies being used to just shutting up about the shit and getting on with getting through it. I guess that when he says he can't cope he's expressing the desperation he feels, not his intention to ditch out. The resilience that one develops with crohns is stupendous; the ability to grasp a straw of hope in a crisis so you can keep going until it's over; putting yourself through agony for something you want because it's the only way; and learning to carry this grossly heavy burden as lightly as a watch. And if my husband pulls through this I guess he will learn more resilience too.   I took almost everything my husband said personally when I was depressed. It was awful.   Yeah. I can take the simplest thing the wrong way so easily now, and that's really tough for hubby. At first it led to arguments with him getting pissed off at me apparently getting angry at him for no reason, but now we both realise what's happening it's still hard but we can stop it escalating."
CrohnsDisease,3cv2gu,semi__colon,2,Sun Jul 12 04:56:52 2015 UTC,"Maybe a therapist for you would even be a good idea? When I came off of prednisone, depression hit hard but so slowly I didn't even realize it was happening. On top of that I was deficient in vitamins and still in the grieving process of my disease. My therapist worked wonders in helping me to objectively see the situation. So even though I was depressed as I waited for my body to figure itself out, I was at least prepared with a couple coping strategies which my husband helped me with.   One of the most significant things that kept me going, you mentioned:   the ability to grasp a straw of hope in a crisis so you can keep going until it's over   Hope is so important, and even just by seeing a small sliver of goodness in the bad was a big deal in my recovery process. It sounds like you're on track.   Please take care of your mental health! Depression is a black hole and the sooner it is resolved / treated, the easier it is to deal with the disease and any obstacles you might face."
CrohnsDisease,3cv2gu,Un1c0rn_B4rf,3,Sun Jul 12 07:15:09 2015 UTC,"My wife has Chrohns, endometriosis, and for a time suffered from clinical depression. I can tell you, there were a few times I almost gave up.   It worries me that you minimize his difficulties at work and compare his struggles with what you face. Are your challenges objectively worse than his? Almost certainly. Would I choose to swap with my wife and experience her suffering? Of course not. But so what? There's always someone who's worse off than you. A terminal cancer patient with no one to love them would probably not be too moved to hear about the problems of a Chrohns sufferer in a loving marriage. Does that invalidate your suffering, or make you unworthy of empathy?   It was difficult for my wife to let me talk about my feelings, partly because it made her feel worse to think her illnesses were also hurting me, but what really helped me was for her to listen to and acknowledge my feelings. I recommend you do some research on living with someone who has a chronic illness, then talk with him and do your best to understand what he's experiencing and empathize.   My wife and I got through the worst times, she's doing much better, and I'm incredibly happy I didn't give up. I hope and believe you two can achieve happiness too."

Which is why I'm so upset about it.    but what really helped me was for her to listen to and acknowledge my feelings.   We've realised we need to make much more effort to communicate when I'm depressed and he's stressed. I know minimising his problems is just untrue as well as unfair and counterproductive. I'll try and encourage him to talk."

For me hope was important.  I think it's a very good thing that you've taken the initiative to discuss things here.  I hope it helps you.  Feel free to shoot me a PM, or put your husband in touch with me.  Sounds like we have a lot in common.

We've also talked about hope and faith that we can endure this, and discovered that we both have it, and despite those moments when it may be weak neither of us is going to quit.

CrohnsDisease,3cvqt6,dmartin16,6,Sat Jul 11 04:27:50 2015 UTC,"Yes, yes it does. I still remember my 4 pen loading dose like it was yesterday. Each side of the abdomen, and each thigh. Looked like a giant snake bite. Hurt like a motherfucker.   It stings less if you allow the fluid to warm up for 30 minutes first. Some people ice the injection spot first, others slap the skin a little. Anything that creates a powerful sensation will help.  I usually take a pain pill about 45 minutes prior to injection. I switched from the pens to the syringes about two and a half years ago. More control over the speed means even less sting. A hard pinch, inject, hold a tissue, done.   Humira works, but boy does it sting!"
CrohnsDisease,3cvqt6,Loliepopp79,2,Sat Jul 11 04:41:18 2015 UTC,"Yep, but couldn't bring myself to do my thighs.. I iced and pinched my stomach and it was fine until I moved.. then it felt like someone was still poking me. Oh well, first dose over with."
CrohnsDisease,3cvqt6,BootyMcSqueak,5,Sat Jul 11 04:47:15 2015 UTC,"Did the loading dose. All 4 in the stomach. Did not have any bleeding. It is best to let them come to room temperature to decrease the burning, but it's not a big deal. It's just one time and it's over. Really, it's not as serious as some people are making it out to be."

I'e had to do it three times now and it was miserable each time. it does get better from here on out.  I did bleed on one spot once on my upper leg because i didnt pinch and i think i jabbed muscle. yeowch. try getting a bigger pinch of skin next time.   icing the spot beforehand helped it not hurt so much for me.
CrohnsDisease,3cvqt6,Ticklethis275,2,Sun Jul 12 11:14:28 2015 UTC,I got bleeding and a lot of pain from the auto-injectors but I switched to the syringe and it was amazing. You barely feel the needle and you can inject at your own pace so it doesn't hurt too bad.
CrohnsDisease,3cvqt6,pcpoobag,2,Sat Jul 11 07:52:11 2015 UTC,I do the pin just because the act of pushing the plunger puts me on edge.
CrohnsDisease,3cvqt6,jprice1542,2,Sat Jul 11 13:51:12 2015 UTC,Totally agree. Just gone back on humira and had the loading dose. 2 pens and 2 syringes. Syringes for the win.
CrohnsDisease,3cvqt6,Ticklethis275,2,Sat Jul 11 14:26:34 2015 UTC,"I'm on my second month. Just loaded up last night. The only problem I had was a rash I developed on both my knees, but I can't be sure if it was caused by the Humira or not.   When I did the first dose (4 pens) I laid 2 pens out for about 10 mins to warm a little. Then I injected the 2 cold pens, one in the leg and one in the stomach. Then I did the 2 warm pens, again one in the leg and one in the stomach. I did this just to get a feel how each felt. The cold pens hurt a little more than the warm pens, and the legs hurt like a bitch. I barely felt the warm pen in my stomach, so that's what I went with. I don't even get a red spot when I inject. This is just my 2 cents."
CrohnsDisease,3cvqt6,YesHunty,2,Sat Jul 11 15:07:52 2015 UTC,I don't remember doing a loading dose...

You can try using an ice pack on the skin you will be using first. It kind of numbs the pain and makes it sting less!  It sounds stupid, but I usually eat a really sour candy when I do my injections, because it takes my mind away from the needle. Haha"
CrohnsDisease,3cvqt6,Ticklethis275,1 point,Sat Jul 11 14:22:40 2015 UTC,I stopped taking Humira and switched to cimzia. The Humira hurt so bad that I started developing an anxiety every time I was due for my next dose. Felt like someone lit my leg on fire and beat it with a hammer.

CrohnsDisease,3cvqt6,helpisonthewayRN,1 point,Sat Jul 11 14:22:24 2015 UTC,My injections bleed a little every now and then but they always sting a little. I know it's been mentioned but letting it warm up for a half hour first helps.  I just keep in mind that a few seconds/minutes of burning is a lot better than the days I spent in the hospital before I started my Tx.  I stick solely to the abdomen now.  I injected into my thigh a few times until (I assume) I hit a nerve and it was the most painful thing I could imagine and it shot pain all the way down my leg.
CrohnsDisease,3cvqt6,Azafolk,1 point,Sat Jul 11 15:39:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm sure the next dose (2 pens) will be far easier on me.  I'll stick with the tummy area. And I think pulling the pens out, taking 2 tylenol, and then taking the shots 30 minutes later is as about as good as it'll get."
CrohnsDisease,3cvqt6,MonkeyCatDog,1 point,Sat Jul 11 18:01:57 2015 UTC,That's the best I've found.  I've been on it for about 4 or 5 years now and I just skip the tylenol now cause it burns no matter what.  Sometimes I still have to do a quick injection without giving it time to warm up.  Makes me remember why I wait for it to warm up.  I never look forward to them.  I just grab some skin hit the button and count to 20.
CrohnsDisease,3cvqt6,huihana,1 point,Sat Jul 11 18:05:15 2015 UTC,"Yeah it does sting quite a bit but it actually was less painful than what I had read on the internet.  I was just so fucking scared, some people said it was an 8/10 pain where 10/10 would be an amputation without anesthesia haha."

I'm not uncomfortable with him receiving small payments for consulting, either--it's probably good that companies are asking for his expertise.    The important thing is that what he prescribes me is driven by data rather than cash money.  The meds I'm on, he hasn't received anything for.

At first I was really pissed off about it, but my doctor is in charge of new drug trials (he was the lead doc on all the entyvio trials in my area and that's only one example). I've decided I'm okay with it. I research my options anyway and he's never tried to push a drug on me that wasn't necessary.  While I really do like knowing it so that I can be wary, I don't think it's worth dropping a doctor who has thus far been relatively successful in treating my disease. Though it does still skeeve me out a little."

CrohnsDisease,3curgn,sinbysilence,9,Fri Jul 10 23:04:12 2015 UTC,"You need an ER visit. The symptoms are going too long its time for a CT and some blood work. The ER will relieve your pain and get some fluids in you maybe antibiotics. I under stand the money is an issue but if the disease is progressing unchecked its going to cost a hell of a lot more. I would find the name of the social worker at the hospital and get in touch with him or her and see what programs are available to you. You need to set boundarys where when crossed you go to the ER. Fever over 101, bloody bowel movements, sudden increase in pain ect ect. I have suffered with Crohns for over 30 years and this is still how I handle it."

Vibraty? I don't know how to describe it. I don't feel right.  I'm very unfamiliar with this disease, cause like I said, my original doctor was an ass, so I just stopped going. But this is day number 5 and I'm starting to get concerned that it's not getting any better.   I appreciate your input. Exactly what I was looking for - don't want to go to the ER if it's something that'll blow over. I'm kind of scared too, to be honest.

When im healthy i subsist on 5-6 hours of sleep a night, when it's active i will sleep 10+ hours (with breaks for the toilet). Honestly i generally assume that my body trying to heal itself and the best thing to do is let it get the sleep. I've found that when sleeping your body heals more and even after sleeping for a significant amount of time, i will still be exhusted, but that just means it is working hard to fix me. Also when flaring you arent getting as much nutrients from your food, so reduction in energy   sorry if this is rambly, but i personally dont think it is unusual, and attribute it to being just another side effect"

I've found its best to just give and sleep as much as much my body wants. It feels like it helps me get through the flares better when I just let my bod do what it tells me it wants/needs. It does suck to lose all that time and energy sleeping that you could spend doing other things..."
CrohnsDisease,3csgol,UpboatOarKnotUpboat,2,Fri Jul 10 14:51:34 2015 UTC,I have crazy amounts of fatigue with my Crohn's especially when flaring. I'll sleep 12-14 hours a day and wake up still exhausted and have even went back to sleep multiple times and have slept through the entirety of a day. Hit up those multivitamins with a B-12 base. Works for me.
CrohnsDisease,3csgol,Windiigo,2,Fri Jul 10 15:41:38 2015 UTC,"I've been sleeping 12-to 15 hours a day as well, but I've been flaring since February and while medication is slowly starting to do it's thing it's not there yet.   I've talked to my Doc today and he said that the fatigue is A) common in active flares of Crohn and Colitis B) a side effect of the medicine I am taking (purinethol and prednisone both cause it he said) C) an effect of the too high liver activity I have at the moment and D) of the anemia I have due to flaring. So he said it's most likely caused by all these things together or one of them. He also said that sadly there's nothing he can do about it and that it likely will dissapear when we find the proper medication. Until that time I should just go with the flow.  Same will probably go for you then ;)"

While what my Doc says boils down to the same thing, that they can't do anything about it; it at least explains why it is the way it is and that there's a probability for improvement :)"
CrohnsDisease,3csgol,jxj24,2,Fri Jul 10 15:51:16 2015 UTC,See if your gastroenterologist will prescribe you some b12 shots. It's helped me out some
CrohnsDisease,3csgol,FDboredom,2,Fri Jul 10 18:10:10 2015 UTC,B-12 is useful if you have low levels.  In my experience it did nothing unless my levels were well below normal range.
CrohnsDisease,3csgol,Palewisconsinite,1 point,Sat Jul 11 14:29:52 2015 UTC,"Very true, but it's very common for people with crohns to be low in b12, which could be contributing to OPs fatigue.   Yeah it provides no increase in energy level if you aren't deficient."

I am going on vacation in a month, and I really dont want to have to worry about what hospitals are in that area. What helps me is to stop eating, and drink a LOT. I particularly like hot tea, it settles my stomach. Sadly, you are probably feeling worse because of the stress of vacation.

CrohnsDisease,3csbzr,Se7enLC,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:48:48 2015 UTC,"That was the worst couple weeks of my life right there.  The doctor wasn't wrong to suggest it. I mean, If I'm not eating anything, I won't have to shit 15 times a day, right? Wrong.  It wasn't exactly elemental, but it was not too far. I had pretty much just juice and canned broth. Symptoms were just as bad as when I was eating normally, and on top of it I had no energy and I was starving.  This came about because I was at a point where the doctor was about to put me on steroids, but I was recovering from an unrelated surgery and wasn't supposed to take steroids. So I just suffered for a few months. And then when I finally got the go-ahead to take prednisone I was symptom free within the month.  But the scientist in me was glad to find out for sure that my condition was 100% not just the result of eating the wrong food. So now when somebody tries to ""help"" by suggesting some stupid fad diet I can just say ""No. I tried eating nothing and even that didn't work. It has nothing to do with what food I eat""."
CrohnsDisease,3csbzr,Nu5ZCa,1 point,Fri Jul 10 13:46:36 2015 UTC,"I'm not talking about a ""diet"" really. This is a clinical nutritional intervention. Juice and broth has lots of stuff that's not amino acids, glucose, vitamins, or non inflammatory fat.  There are several published clinical studies supporting the use of elemental nutrition to induce remission of a flare in IBD, with effectiveness rivalling steroids."
CrohnsDisease,3csbzr,Se7enLC,1 point,Fri Jul 10 14:08:52 2015 UTC,"No, I get it. It still eliminated a lot of things as possible triggers. In hindsight, I wish my doctor had put me on something more rigorous like what you mention. He didn't even tell me to take any specific vitamin supplements to make up for the whole not eating thing. He didn't exactly inspire a lot of confidence in me, and I'm glad to have switched doctors since then.  The only reason I mentioned ""fad diet"" at all is because we've all got some friend or relative that thinks they are helping when they say ""Oh, I once had a really bad tummy ache and I felt much better when I cut down on XXXXXXX"" in that oh-so-very unscientific and inadvertently-condescending way that they do. Going through the not-eating-anything diet is a good way to prove to yourself that there isn't some simple food trigger causing the problem."
CrohnsDisease,3csbzr,Superfarmer,1 point,Fri Jul 10 14:28:39 2015 UTC,Sugar and citric acid are inflammatory - the idea alone of drinking juice gives me a flare up.   Broth. Yogurt. Kombucha. Sauerkraut. Oatmeal.   These things help me when I'm flaring.

CrohnsDisease,3csbzr,Superfarmer,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:15:41 2015 UTC,"Well Crohns is a bacterial imbalance.  So I find that eating probiotic heavy foods help during a flare up.

With that said, you will have some adrenal suppression even after just a few days of use, so if you'd like to taper, you certainly can.  But a taper in this case is considered medically unnecessary."

The remaining half is working fine on its own so I don't take any hormone replacement tablets.  Will that make a difference regarding taking the Prednisolone?"
CrohnsDisease,3csrvp,LarsPoosay,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:32:31 2015 UTC,Nope. The thyroid is not part of the HPA axis. It won't affect your adrenal glands' cortisol secretion.

Some changes in mood but no crying or yelling or anything. And I haven't noticed any weight gain or moon face yet. I have been working out, however, and maybe that helps with it.   It definitely sounds like you should taper off of it though. Maybe even just 10mg a day, but 30 to 0 sounds too fast. Talk to your doc. Good luck!"
CrohnsDisease,3csrvp,ManofSteel2014,1 point,Fri Jul 10 14:20:22 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's wise to taper it off in just seven days since it needs at least a month or more depending on the dosage but I am no doctor. As for the side effects, mental-related ones started after I have been on prednisone for almost three days. As for other side effects, it took almost a month to appear. Some started after I was tapering it off like severe acne breakout."

Pretty much the only time I can remember crying in my adult life that wasn't at a funeral has been while I was tapering prednisone. My supervisor had asked me to rvise something I wrote, it was a tiny bit unfair but no big deal really. I had to close the door to my office and let it out for a half hour. Also, my sex drive tanked. If you find yourself experiencing an extreme emotion, try and take a step back and ask if it's really a response to what happening to you, or the drugs."

I was on Prednisone 45mg a day for awhile, I went away for a weekend and forgot my meds at home, by day two of no prednisone my ankles were swollen to the size of my calves and I could barely walk.   Don't mean to scare you and I'm sure this doesn't happen to everyone. Dropping off prednisone does not sound like a good idea. I'd talk to someone about tapering off."

I've been on 40mg for over a month now, and I dont have any really bad side effects. Still no moonface (which im excited about), but sometimes moodswings, and I am always hungry. But it makes your energy level higher, I am always cleaning! I would highly not recommend going from 30mg to 0mg after 7 days though, I would definately ask about that. I also have bad headaches/ migraines every once in awhile. But otherwise, I wouldnt be too concerned about taking Prednisone!"
CrohnsDisease,3csrvp,MELLIkalikimaka,0,Fri Jul 10 16:38:41 2015 UTC,Thanks for all of the advice.  Perhaps I should try the following (I have 42 x 5mg tabs):   Days 1 to 4 - 30mg per day (24 tabs) Days 5 to 7 - 20mg per day (12 tabs) Day 8 onwards - 10mg per day until all 42 are finished (which would take 3 days)   How does that sound?

CrohnsDisease,3creuv,seaofdreamsx,3,Fri Jul 10 16:13:24 2015 UTC,"Ah, the spinal injection, had it for my resection too.    Honestly it's nothing, from what I remember I got a shot in the buttocks that made me drowsy, I was barely awake when I got in the operating room. I got rolled to the side for the spinal injection, I think the anaesthetist failed the first shot and succeeded on the second, and it honestly barely hurt at all, probably less than my regular blood tests.    However it's really great afterwards, you probably won't feel your legs for the next 12-24 hours, but with it you'll avoid the immediate pain from the surgery and it's honestly for the best as you'll recover much faster. I also had the morphine pump but for at least 5 days, although the maximum dose it can deliver was quite low, probably still helped.

CrohnsDisease,3creuv,Sully1102,2,Fri Jul 10 09:10:50 2015 UTC,"I'm in nearly the same boat - my surgery is on the Monday after next and I'm having an ileocecal resection laproscopically. I've not had any surgery at all so I'm panicking a bit and my natural reaction to fear is just to plan every tiny aspect that I actually have control over down to the most minor detail haha. I've spent all day researching hospital stay tips and tricks and then your post came up on my Reddit homepage!  My surgeon has recommended that I be admitted for anywhere from 3-7+ days. So far my packing list is:   Loose, comfy drawstring PJ pants & button-up tops A few pairs of warm socks that have the little non-slip things on the bottom so they're kind of like slippers Comfy knickers A shawl/wrap with no sleeves so I can throw it on without having to be disconnected from the IV Toiletries including lip balm, dry shampoo, moisturiser, face wash, baby wipes, concealer (I know it sounds weirdly vain but I feel like having the option to get rid of horrible undereye circles before visitors come by might lift my spirits a bit), toothbrush, paste & mouthwash, roll-on deodorant, a few cute headbands, hair brush & hairties iPad loaded with movies & games + headphones Herbal teas (since I'm pretty sure a public hospital won't have any and I like them) Laundry bag   My surgeon has told me that I don't need to do any prep except for fasting the night before. I thought this was strange. Have you been given similar advice? I'm also thinking I should take the opportunity to feast on some of my favourite foods before I go in in case I can';t eat them again for a while. Did it take long for you to go back to eating normal food again after your first resection?  I'm also terrified of needles (although I'm better now after the forced exposure therapy over the years haha) and the idea of an epidural also scares me so much more than the actual surgery too.   Best of luck to you! I hope it all goes amazingly and that you get some relief after recovery."

Let's see, with my first resection I was already admitted in the hospital and had been on iv fluids for 10 days already, so they just gave me a suppository and that's it. I was shocked that they are only having me do clear liquids the day before as well, but im not going to argue lol! I was on clear liquids the first 24 hours, then the second day I went to soft foods (pudding, ice cream, rice cereal, etc) and by the third day I was able to try crackers, toast, and light foods. The day I went home they let me order a large burrito lol! I ate the whole thing. But just make sure to take it slow and don't rush spicy or acidic foods too soon. How old are you, if you don't mind me asking? I'm 28. I'm also bringing some concealer and blush just to make myself a little more presentable for people who do come and visit haha. Great minds think alike! Definitely feel free to message me anytime if you have any questions! We'll get through it together!"

I bought 'irresistibles for the irritable' and it really helped me to adjust. You can download a fodmap apps, such as the monash uni low fodmap diet, thatll classify foods as safe, unsafe and borderline.   I did the elimination diet and, although a pain, it really helped me in the long term to avoid trigger foods and prevent flare ups. That was over 2 years ago and im glad i sought help. I couldn't see any patterns in my diet and I was feeling pretty miserable. Now my symptoms are a lot more manageable. Although its hard, relapsing and losing remission is worse.

CrohnsDisease,3crmy9,SmellThisMilk,1 point,Sat Jul 11 02:41:06 2015 UTC,"Absolutely! I used to be a pretty big skeptic when it came to diet as I had tried a number of different ones with no effect. I saw a nutritionist about a month ago and started the FODMAP diet and I feel soooo much better. No bloating, no gas, virtually no pain. I definitely recommend giving it a try.  As for recipes, yeah! I love to cook, too, but man, no onions? No garlic?! You might as well tell me to cut out my tongue, wheres the flavor? You have to learn where you get the flavor from in a very different way. I have learned to love ginger for its refreshing zest and maple syrup as a catch all sweetner. Lemme just try to list some of the basic meals I started to prepare over the last few weeks.   Chicken quesadillas- Chicken breast on corn tortillas with bell pepper and pepper jack. Just bake the chicken after covering it with cumin and chili powder and bake the sliced up bell peppers along with it. The bell peppers add a sweetness that you might be missing without any onions, so its not so bland. DO NOT put oil down on the pan when you lay the tortilla down. Mediterranean platter- Polenta, cherry tomatoes, feta, lamb, olives, cucumber. Very simple summer dish. I just get a tube of polenta and slice up a few wedges. Its way too much of a pain to make. You can use vinegar or olive oil and your basic Italian spices. OATMEAL- oatmeal is my basic breakfast every morning. Just get some steal cut oats and microwave it, its just as good stove top. I throw in some peanut butter and blueberries/strawberries/raspberries, then cinnamon and maybe some yogurt. Ginger stir fry- I just made a big thing of ginger chicken stir fry with radishes, carrots and snow peas with sesame seeds for flavor. I think for dinner recipes, stir fry is gonna be the way to go, since you can mix and match so many things and it of course just calls for rice. I usually follow it up with some pineapple for desert.   One thing I had some trouble with was just flavorful beverages. You basically can't have anything! Very little juice, very few teas, no beer- ugh, it becomes a pain. So, I recently have taken to just buying a bunch of ginger and simmering it with sugar to make syrup for home made ginger ale. I'm using a cheating recipe, so I dont carbonate it myself, but it takes about 45 minutes to make the syrup. I guess its probably more expensive in Australia, but ginger is usually dirt cheap.  http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/homemade-ginger-ale-358033  It was a real pain starting out, but once you have a few basic recipes down, it becomes a much easier diet to follow. Please, let me know how it goes and if you find any recipes that you like, as well!"

The experience was good (well the prep was bad, but I learned I react to the antibiotics they gave me).  I was out of the hospital after 4 days and was back to pretty much normal in a few weeks.  The surgery also gave me about a year of being as close to remission as I've had since I was diagnosed.  So, I got lucky and everything worked without complications.  If you have the chance to do laparoscopic, I would suggest doing that instead of cutting fully open.  That and make sure you are walking around as soon as you are able after the surgery."

It was very frustrating, up to the point where two years ago, I gave up on even trying to experiment with my diet. Well, aside from focusing on soluble fiber, like oatmeal and avocados. Those are two things that have ALWAYS helped me stay regular.  Recently, I moved to New York and started seeing one of, if not the most renowned IBD doctor in the world. His in house nutritionist recommended I follow a low FODMAP diet in order to reduce my constant bloating and cramps that had forced me to use marijuana or hydrocodone to manage the pain. The first few hours of every day were about 4 on the pain scale.  I was very skeptical at first, but after 5 days of staying on the diet I started to feel significantly better. Four weeks on the diet and I feel fucking great.  I start everyday with a bowl of oatmeal with blueberries/raspberries, peanut butter and cinnamon. Very filling and it keeps me regular.

When I was first diagnosed I could only eat white rice. That was it. My boyfriend tried to make me bland boneless/skinless chicken breast just to get some protein in me but I couldn't do it. White rice was all I could eat.  Then I (and here's where it gets weird) went on a Spaghetti-O's kick. I could eat all the Spaghetti-O's I wanted for about a week before they made me sick, too.  Then it was skinless cucumber. As long as I didn't try to eat the skins I was fine with cucumber and that was like heaven. It felt almost healthy!  Nowadays when I have a bad day I'm good with spaghetti as long as it only has butter and a little salt or parmasean cheese on it. I can't do red sauces right now.  It's super strange.

Other than that I would just make sure you've washed all the clothes. Bleach won't even necessarily kill 100% of the c diff spores. I was told to make sure you wipe everything down with disposable towels because the actual contact and throwing out part can help just as much as bleach/cleaner. That's part of why hand sanitizer isn't as good as washing your hands (since you wash away the spores rather than just putting sanitizer on them).  Now, that's all stuff I heard while I was dealing with my second and third reoccurrences of c diff. What really helped was tapering off the c diff meds. Instead of just stopping vancomyacin I went on a taper and that is what finally actually killed the infection."

CrohnsDisease,3cpzcq,birdmommy,2,Thu Jul 9 21:43:55 2015 UTC,"Throwing hand soap into your washing machine may give you problems with extra bubbles, and it will most likely leave a weird residue on your clothes.

CrohnsDisease,3cpzcq,scottley,1 point,Thu Jul 9 22:58:24 2015 UTC,"The problem is that it is hard to kill the bacteria.  The real ""solution"" is to prevent ingestion of the bacteria.

As the Guide to the Elimination of Clostridium difficile in Healthcare Settings (APIC, 2008) explains, ""The term 'hypersporulation' has been used to denote the propensity of the bacterium to move from the vegetative form to the spore form with increased rapidity. The term has also been used to note that contact with some germicides stress the bacterium, so it more readily transitions to the spore form. Therefore, the term hypersporulation may be understood as the propensity of the organism to more readily move from the vegetative form to the spore than occurs under usual conditions. Although many EPA-registered germicides kill the vegetative C. difficile, only chlorine-based disinfectants and high-concentration, vaporized hydrogen peroxide kill spores.""  C-Diff is a bacteria that can cause dormant spores that last a long time sans host (IIRC there have been reports of Clostridium from Egyptian times that are still viable). Once a fungus or C-Diff create spores, they become super hardened and extra protected (and VERY hard to get rid of). This is the reason why they're saying bleach (or apparently aerosolized peroxide) can take care of the spores. These lyse the bacteria/spores by stealing electrons and literally ""popping"" the cells.  I just did a quick google, and it appears you may also use ozone to sanitize difficult applications. Oxygen has 2 oxygen atoms, ozone has 3 (oxygen = O2, ozone = O3). Ozone has an unbalanced number of electrons so it can steal electrons similarly to bleach and aerosolized peroxide.   To generate ozone, you need a specialized machine. I bought one off Amazon for ~$200 because it does get rid of smells, mold, etc. Only downside is you have to run it for multiple hours in a relatively confined space that is not occupied. You have to air out the room / area afterwards. You also have to hold your breath when you run into the room to start the air out process because it's caustic so it burns your lungs (can be dangerous if you do it long-term, but a quick whiff is just irritating). The smell isn't the best, but it works as a deodorizer. I've not had it do anything to clothing colors or carpet colors for that matter.

If I attempt to run any sooner than that, I need a bathroom 5 minutes into my run.  Also, this is something that got better for me as I got healthier. Before I was diagnosed, running for 30 seconds to catch a bus triggered nearly instantaneous diarrhea (which defeated the purpose of running to catch the bus in the first place... I'd have to get off to use the bathroom in a random McDonald's, and would end up on the next bus anyway!). That was actually the very first symptom that I had, which should have alerted me that something was wrong.  That symptom went away once I was accurately diagnosed and being treated, but I still couldn't safely run a long distance - but in the past few years, during periods where I've been in ""deep remission,"" I've worked my way up to a 5k without incident.

I could be wrong of course, but I believe that if you are feeling the sensation of needing to take a dump, and yet can't it may be proctitis (the inflammation of the rectum). That as far as I'm aware will give you that feeling despite no material being present. For me it gets bad enough that I get painful involuntary spasms/contractions almost like dry heaving out the other end."

""What the fuck's the point of going on? This shit's going to ruin my life, and I can't do anything about it. I'm either going to end up bedridden, or with a bag, or both"". And then I realized: it's not about your situation at the moment, it's about what you can do with what you've got ahead, regardless of what you are or are not capable of. Crohn's or Colitis isn't a death sentence - infact, in my case, it has shaped the very nature of who I am today in an extremely positive way (hell I wouldn't be doing charity work otherwise).  It might seem like there's no end or cure, but as with any disease, progress is continuous and inevitable. Trials are making huge leaps and bounds and producing very good results, so even if we don't get a cure in the next 10 years, medication and techniques will get more effective, have less side effects, and most importantly, get cheaper as competition improves.  Have you talked to your doctor about how you're feeling? It sounds like you're pretty frustrated, and I can perfectly understand why considering your situation."

If you think the amount of hair on your head or the function of your bowels determines your human worth, then you will only attract people who feel the same. While it is difficult to have a partner with CD, I am willing to take it on in order to experience the kind of love I get from my husband. He is someone who is willing to look past all of my flaws and love me unconditionally which spurs me on to do the same for him. I would never wish for a life without him. Your life may not be turning out to be what you had wanted or planned for, but it is not a lost cause. Having survived growing up in an abusive household, you have already displayed an amount of strength many people don't have. You sound as if you were strong enough to recognize how damaging your surroundings were and determined to make your own life different. Most people continue on with the cycle of abuse while you have chosen to break it. That same strength can be used to overcome the difficulty of a chronic and incurable disease and live as much of an enjoyable life as you can. No, it will not be perfect but it will be much more than the nothingness of death. Keep hope that you can build a meaningful life despite UC because there are so many other people who are still able to. You are not alone."

Have a look at the Crohn's MAP vaccine, that probably the closest we are other than growing a new intestine from stem cells. I have been in some mega dark places with this illness man, spent a month at the bottom of a bottle of jack daniels when I found out I was gonna have to have a permanent colostomy, I knew exactly how much rope I needed to drop from a tree to break my neck without decapitating myself (yes there is a standard formula apparently) but there is a light at the end of the tunnel.

CrohnsDisease,3cmb3n,TheTrain,1 point,Thu Jul 9 08:00:46 2015 UTC,"Let me try this. I am extremely sleep deprived right now so it might make even less sense than usual.  Dude. I have been feeling like you. I have been feeling like you for a long time. We aren't exactly the same though. I am 23 years old, have a permanent ileostomy and man, I haven't even been to college. I didn't even finish school! It's hard.  First of all life isn't fair. Sure we don't have it as bad as many others. That doesn't really help though when we're surrounded by people who have everything that we want when we have done nothing wrong. We live in a society where we want to blame everyone for everything. So then who can we blame for our predicament? There is no one. I don't know about you but I spend like 99% of my time thinking if I had done this then maybe that wouldn't have happened. Maybe if I do X then maybe Y will happen, and then Z happens. People sue others when they slip on banana peels and cut their lip, but what do we get? For years and years of misery? We get nothing.  Secondly what's the point in anything? I mean when you think about it why do we want what others have anyway? I dunno man. In my sleepy stupor I have been thinking, which is always a dangerous thing to do. We have to learn not to care about what everyone else does. We need to care about ourselves. We need to do what we want. Not what others want us to do. We have been told we should do this, then that and then that. So many people who follow the rules and lead normal boring lives are ""withering away"". Maybe our experiences will make us take the bull by the horns.  What's the point in staying alive? What's the point in being dead? There will be enough time for being in the state we were in before we were born after we're dead. You can live a long life and be dead. What's the point in that? It's what we do in this rare and fleeting in between time that matters. We are all dying anyway. Even those so-called healthy people are. You were dying before you were diagnosed. Nothing has changed. All that's different now is that you have encountered this hurdle. It's like. Okay. That was an inconvenience. Now I need to figure out how I can still keep going on. It will highlight how good the good is when you get to know it because we have known the bad and it's bad.  I am really sleepy man. Let me try and wrap this up in succinct way. We need to reconcile the person we are with the person we want to be, or at least the person we are told we should be. Yeah alright maybe that makes no sense.  Also dude, I dunno what treatment you are on or anything. Let me just tell you though, you need to get that inflammation under control yo. It's not good for your body. It's not good for the mind. It eats you up on the inside. It literally destroys you. On the very rare occasions that I have been in ""remission"" I have felt much better. In the head as well as the body. Even if you have to end up with a stoma it's not so bad. The hardest part (like with everything) is learning not to care what others think. I have had it since a child, and it beats a lifetime of disease. If you have ulcerative colitis then it will pretty much cure you if you have your colon removed as well. So then you can do whatever you want! I have Crohn's disease so it's not so simple. Anyway it might not even get to that stage. Some of these newfangled drugs work pretty well these days. Like Remicade and Humira and whatever. Have you tried those?"
CrohnsDisease,3cmb3n,Mathieke,1 point,Thu Jul 9 10:24:18 2015 UTC,"Have you considered a J-pouch? I was in the same situation as you are 2 months ago. Extremely agressive UC which din't respond to any treatment. Because nothing helped my doctor suggested a J-pouch operation. (They take out your entire colon and connect your small intestine to your rectum). Because my UC was so agressive and I was dehydrated I needed 2 operations to make the J-pouch. The first one to remove my colon so I could get healthy again and the second to construct the J-pouch. In between these operations I have an ileostoma. I've had the first operation 1.5 months ago and the next one in 1.5 months and although I don't like living with a stoma I feel so much better after my colon was removed and have so much more time because I'm not constantly sitting on the toilet. The pain is gone and I have a pretty normal life now (except for the stoma but it'll be removed during the second operation and I'll be completely back to normal). Because my colon is removed my stool isn't like it used to be when I was still healthy, it's more like diarrhea because I have no colon to absorp the fluids (meaning I have to drink more) but without the pain. I feel cured right now. Look into it and maybe it's a solution for you (if you can afford it, I live in Belgium and we have a great healthcare system). I wish you the best, don't give up and you're not alone in this. Many have gone through what you are going through and if they made it, so can you."

Yes, he might have to shit in a bag someday. And there isn't anyone else in the world I'd rather spend my time with, because he is perfect.  You're going to find someone someday, and chances are good that even if you don't think so, there are people in your life who are so massively glad to have you around, who would be torn apart without you. For me, that's the point, and that's what's kept me from suicide all these years (I have chronic, severe depression and panic disorder).  IBD fucking sucks, no way around it. And depression is a common byproduct of chronic illness. And even though you're hopeless now, there is hope out there, even if it's a little. For me, it took a month of sick leave and intensive outpatient therapy to find hope. When I was your age, I sure didn't have any.  But I'm so glad I stuck through, and I'm glad my husband did, too. Please hang in there, OP. If nobody else, I'm rooting for you. Please feel free to PM me if things get dark.

CrohnsDisease,3cmb3n,YesHunty,1 point,Thu Jul 9 12:22:31 2015 UTC,"I was diagnosed with moderate-severe UC at 21. That was two years ago, I went through a solid year and a half of depression, weight gain, steroid use, pain, and bleeding. I missed so much work, I lost friends, I didn't want to get out of bed, I cried because I was a burden for family, and I tried 10 different drugs in under a year, all were futile.  Then I tried Simponi. Within two months I was symptom free. That was back in September. I'm in Canada and luckily I work with a company that provides 100% prescription benefits, so my drugs are covered. I can count my lucky stars for that.   But now I am back to my life. I'm getting married in two months, I am back into competing at my sport, I haven't missed work in a long time now, and I am carrying on a normal social life, symptom free. And to add to this, my fiancé proposed to me when I was on Cortisone and Prednisone. I was a balloon of a human being, constantly on the toilet, shitting the bed, etc. And he still stuck around and asked me to marry him, so there ARE people willing to be with you through thick and thin. You will find someone.  I have some swollen nodes we are keeping an eye on, which is basically my only concern right now.   The point im making is, that people deal with a lot worse shit than this. Hair grows back, there are drugs that can help you (co-pay programs are provided with a lot of Biologics), and you are young. I am 23 now, and so pleased that I found a drug that works, and that my life is basically back to normal.  You honestly just have to keep going and persevere. Giving up shouldn't be your option.

I'm not going to pretend like UC doesn't suck, but it doesn't have to be your whole life. It's true that there's no known cure, yet, but there are a lot of treatment options that can make most or all of the symptoms go away. As far as incurable diseases go, I can't think of a better choice.  So you have to poop a lot. So mornings are a little rough. Maybe there are some foods you don't get to have anymore. Maybe some days you don't feel like doing anything at all. Is it really THAT BAD that you can't keep going? UC doesn't prevent me from doing anything. I can still go backpacking for a week, I can still bike, run, ski, swim.   I mean, it's not like having hair and a regular bowel were your best qualities, were they? Surely you've got something else going for you. I feel bad for anyone that goes on a date, and afterwards when her friends ask how it went, she says ""Well, he has nice hair and he's good at pooping, and those are the qualities I look for most""."

Honestly I don't remember when I just know it was a long enough ago for me to have gone through hell and back a few times over.  That's an experience that changes you, and if you come out of it, changes you for the better. Now I'm here for my friends and girlfriend when they struggle, and they know they can dump any and all of their problems on me because I won't be bothered by it, not after what I went through. Holding someone's hand while they go through the same or lesser hell I went through is just another trip for me, and makes it all the easier on them. To me, the answer to your question is: to strengthen yourself to help others less strong.  This may also not be a popular opinion, so I won't say much on it. I come from a religious family and I've found it to help. I'd be willing to talk more about that if you want, PM me.

The raw fiber contained in lettuce, kale and such has made me run for the bathroom within 30 mins of consumption every time. And they just won't be digested at all. And it's a real shame, because I love salads. All leafy greens and green herbs give me problems, and all cabbages too. I happen to like them, so I am not all too happy to have a summer without them.

Eventually I noticed it, and tried it one last time to make sure, and got sick. I don't have as bad a reaction with some soda, sierra mist and dr pepper were the ones I found to be least toxic to my system. I dumped soda all together a while ago though and honestly I think it was the best decision. After that it was candy that always messed me up, like lots of jolly ranchers, or sour patch kids. Anything with a ton of sugar always socks me right in the gut afterwards."

People can understand pain and illness, but there's the constant worry that just doesn't sink in until every thought you have every day somehow incorporates your illness. It makes everything you do a chore.  ""Want to go out for coffee?"" I can't drink coffee, but I could come with you. But we can't go to the close coffee shop because they only have a single bathroom and you need to get a key to use it so we'll have to drive an extra 5 miles to the chain coffee shop and I don't know if I can handle 10 minutes in a car given how urgent ""things"" have been lately. Plus I'm starting to get cramps, but they might be gone in a minute. I think they're the quick kind of cramps not the lingering kind of cramps. Yeah. ""Yeah that sound like fun.""  Every decision of every day is like that and it's mentally exhausting and completely unrelatable. People may think they understand and agree that nobody should have to live like that when you explain it to them, but it doesn't mean they truly get it. 5 minutes after you tell them about that conversation they go back to their lives while you still think about IBD all the time."

Never had the moon face thing, but it does help me put on some much needed weight. The acne thing does happen, but I get ahead of it by being extra diligent with my benzoyl peroxide preventative acne regimen.   The main things I'm worried about are osteoporosis (so I take calcium and vitamin D) and the roid rage. Roid rage is very real. When I'm even on like 15-20mg of prednisone the littlest things bother me so much and I get so angry. My poor little dog shakes herself off after a nap, and her tags clank together -- it takes a lot of focus to tell myself to chill out and not yell at her.

CrohnsDisease,3cmr0a,Azafolk,5,Thu Jul 9 02:52:52 2015 UTC,"It is frustrating. It is not forever. Well, it's not constantly that bad forever. Sometimes you're down for a year or two. Hell I haven't had symptoms completely stop in the full 14 years I've been doing this. But I'm doing a fuck ton better now than I was doing a long time ago, and one of the things I'm happiest about is not having gone heavy on the prednisone and developing osteo.  One day present day you, will be past you. Never let past you fuck over future you. I don't know how much sense that makes to you, but it's the only rope I could hold onto those years I had suicidal thoughts. The thing is that it gets easier. You can adapt. You are gonna have to find your limits, and take the shit getting beaten out of you by your own gut like you are now, but all of us have at least a chance at peace.   As John Donne once realized, suffering is a treasure envied by many. It is gold, so heavy in weight that each step you take becomes a struggle, and one cannot simply unload it or use it to purchase goods. But carry that gold for long enough and you might get the chance to turn it into something useful. A currency. Something that has true value. Maybe wisdom. Maybe grace. Usually just patience. Even that is useful given enough time.  All I'm asking is that you have patience till your current trial is over, and I understand that's asking a lot. Everyone here who tells you that death isn't worth the hurtling of your body into traffic is really trying to express one thing: We understand. We've felt what you feel. Put up with the bullshit diet and people not understanding. Self harm is an incredibly potent draw for our particular brand of depression. The life long kind. We fantasize about death. A release from pain. But life is about pain and how we cope with it. You don't get to skip out because you were doled more than your fair share. You have to be patient.  Tell you what. Before you do something drastic give me one thing. Go through one cycle of shit. This is it. Get through however many more months or years it takes you to get stable. Then enjoy life one more time. Then tell me you still want it all to end. You've lost sight, and it's easy to do in a race that's this long, but victory is about survival. For all the pain my illness has given me, I would never give it the satisfaction of taking my life from me. I live a good life to spite my illness. The pain I feel now is a reminder that I can only go so fast, but fuck it I will go. If it takes me my whole damn life I will beat this fucking disease. If parts of me have to be removed, that pound of flesh is paid toward whatever is next in my life, and suicide is the only way I could lose. Anything else and I can die happy, knowing that I fought the thing that sought to bring me low every day of my life from diagnosis to last drawn breath. Few healthy people have that going for them like I do. I'm telling you, if you can get through today, and then through tomorrow enough times, then I promise you that things will get better. If you can manage your illness, then it's likely you will have already met and handled one of the greatest challenges that life can throw you.  Last of all and TL;DR do not give up hope because one days others will despair and who will be there to guide them should you take your life now? We need our victors, and most of all we need guidance. So if I don't make it, then you have to. Each one of us is tied a little by the pain we all know and share. So if you can't live for you, then try to live for me. Because I don't even fucking know you, but I care about you."

Not straining when you go to the bathroom and eating fiber (if you can tolerate it) will help.  Obviously still get checked out by your doctor- especially if it's constant bleeding that won't stop.

The back of the hand and wrist can be good IV spots, especially if the elbow veins are misbehaving.  Personally, I prefer the wrist.  If you find that one spot works best for you, request that the nurses try to use it first.  They probably care about getting the IV in easily on the first try almost as much as you do."

Also, I know it might make you seem like an ass, but if your nurse says something like, ""I'll try once and then get the good IV nurse"" don't let him/her.

CrohnsDisease,3cle0r,CCwind,2,Wed Jul 8 22:40:50 2015 UTC,"Ask (demand) the alternative contrast.  Barium makes for an effective. safe. and cheap contrast material, but everyone reacts to it differently.  I may be wrong in this, but every test has at least one other type of contrast that will work (I know the major ones, X-ray, CT, and MRI do).  Straining yourself to get the barium down and then throwing it up doesn't do you or the doctor any good, so the alternative contrasts may well be the better option.  The trick is you have to ask for it or add barium to your list of allergies on your medical file."
CrohnsDisease,3cle0r,CCwind,1 point,Thu Jul 9 07:08:31 2015 UTC,Thats really useful advice! Do you know what the alternate contrast has in it?

CrohnsDisease,3cj6t4,birdmommy,1 point,Wed Jul 8 13:17:18 2015 UTC,"im not sure where you live, but since I've been diagnosed with crohns about a week ago I've signed myself up for 3 trials through the University of Calgary"
CrohnsDisease,3cj6t4,conn_smythe,2,Wed Jul 8 14:09:59 2015 UTC,I used to do a lot of clinical trials when I lived in Toronto. What I found frustrating was that I had to find them myself at the hospital or the university. I wish the CCFC would do more to help people who aren't as comfortable doing that.
CrohnsDisease,3cj6t4,birdmommy,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:31:56 2015 UTC,"Completely agree as I'm sure the trials would have much more success at finding eligible people for them. The only reason why I've joined the trials that I'm going into is because I was approached by different doctors that I've dealt with shortly after being diagnosed. Otherwise, I never would have bothered."
CrohnsDisease,3cj6t4,conn_smythe,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:38:33 2015 UTC,Very interesting. Thank you!  Currently in remission after surgery but I can see three recruiting studies I am interested in if I ever/when I fall ill again.
CrohnsDisease,3cl1rg,TheyCallMeAnna,3,Wed Jul 8 19:07:52 2015 UTC,"You'll need to learn if you have trigger foods. Fried foods, high fiber, high sugar, spicy, etc. seem to be common with Crohn's patients. For me, it's anything with seeds.  You need to hydrate. Drink plenty of water, and take vitamin D.   Humira is a great drug, and should start working very quickly for you."
CrohnsDisease,3cl1rg,Sully1102,3,Wed Jul 8 19:20:06 2015 UTC,One thing I had to learn about Crohns is no two people suffer it the same way. For a while I wondered why no one seemed to suffer what I did and why I didn't have the same issues as them. That is just MY Crohns. After 8 years I still haven't found my Crohns twin! ;-)  So take time to learn about your particular issues.
CrohnsDisease,3cl1rg,MonkeyCatDog,2,Thu Jul 9 17:52:27 2015 UTC,Well first of all. Make sure you wash your hands and clean everything that you touch. C diff is easy to get so others can get it easily. Stay hydrated. Drink Gatorade or any electrolyte filled drink. Try to stay away from spicy foods or dairy. These things usually made me flare but I wouldn't risk it. Never hold in any pee or poo urges. Just go if you can. Try to stay a bit active and outside. The sunshine helps a lot with vitamins and your mood. Being inside due to being in pain all day makes you sad and you lose a lot of vitamins. Make sure to eat regularly. Foods full with your daily nutrients. Hope you get better.
CrohnsDisease,3cl1rg,galindobrandon,2,Wed Jul 8 19:18:49 2015 UTC,CCFA offers a great guide on the topic of managing flares: http://www.ccfa.org/assets/pdfs/flares_brochure_final.pdf
CrohnsDisease,3cl1rg,caretothepeople,1 point,Thu Jul 9 13:43:27 2015 UTC,"The inflammation still being there could very well be a sign that the c.diff is still active! Did they say anything about there being Crohns type lesions, or any bloodwork indicators? Or was it just the fact that there's still inflammation so long after coming down with c. Diff?"
CrohnsDisease,3cl1rg,birdmommy,1 point,Thu Jul 9 00:55:58 2015 UTC,"Ooh good question. I have had 2 colonoscopys, MRI's, bowl x-rays and all that. The inflammation they say look like its been there for ""months"" not years...I got C.Diff in April of 2014 (after taking antibiotics for three days for a sinus infection I didn't even have) and went through a series of antibiotics until July 2014 . That's when the C.Diff was not showing up in the stool anymore but the pain was still there. I went on the LowFodMap diet which helped for about 6 months. I started eating normally, and probably a little in healthfully since I had lost 20lbs (on my 120lb frame, it was frightening) and I had an increase in pain so I went on prednisone for a few months and that seemed to help until just a few weeks ago. I guess if I still had an infection, the steroids would have made it way worse. It's hard to believe that I have Crohns and I still just think something is royally messed up from the C.Diff, but the doctors seem sure, so I guess I don't know."
CrohnsDisease,3cl1rg,birdmommy,2,Thu Jul 9 02:30:07 2015 UTC,"The problem with prednisone is that it can actually reduce the inflammation associated with c diff without actually treating the underlying illness. I don't know anything about your doctors (obviously!), but personally I'd want a LOT of information from them about why they know this isn't a lingering c. Diff infection before starting powerful immunomodulators like Humira."
CrohnsDisease,3ckhyz,Enchanted_Bunny,2,Wed Jul 8 16:52:40 2015 UTC,I also have a colostomy bag. I am male. It does give you more freedom. I can sleep though the night and I don't have to rush to the bathroom or have any accidents. It will take time to get used to and go through trial and error with the bag but it does get better. Make sure to tell your friend to talk to the Ostomy nurse at the hospital as well. They give you info on colostomy bags and the options they got. I'm sure she might like the options of having a more discreet bag to have. If you or your friend have any more questions. You can ask me or anyone else. We are here for you and your friend.
CrohnsDisease,3ckhyz,galindobrandon,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:22:19 2015 UTC,"I just got a colostomy bag, and there's no lose of dignity. Actually, it gave me more. I went from having accidents several times a month to suddenly not having to worry anymore about suddenly running out of meeting or conversation because I NEEDED to use the bathroom NOW.  In terms of dressing, they are very discrete. I feel like women have more options than men, just because the bag always is tucked into pants at some point.  If she's worried about an active lifestyle, that won't be an issue. Again, I gained a lot more freedom once I had the bag.   Oh, and sex is fine. There are sexy lingerie belly bands if she's really concerned."
CrohnsDisease,3ckhyz,Sully1102,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:15:27 2015 UTC,"Thank you. I can't imagine what she's going through right now. All I know is how I would feel if I were faced with it, and honestly it is a frightening thing for me. It just seems like it would feel so...alien. I don't know if her bag would be permanent or not, but I can definitely empathize with her being scared of it."
CrohnsDisease,3ckhyz,Sully1102,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:21:34 2015 UTC,"There are mainly two types of ostomy surgeries: ileostomy and colostomy. The difference being if the bag is attached to the colon or near the ileum.  I hope to get reconnected, but I wouldn't be devastated if it wasn't an option. With the type of ostomy I have (sigmoid), I have the ability to start irrigating it. This means that I flush it with saline once a day, then just wear a ""cap"" instead of a bag."
CrohnsDisease,3ckhyz,TheFiksman,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:43:09 2015 UTC,"Hi. I had a temp Ileostomy (same bag, different spot) for 4 months. I can tell you it really sucks at first, but the world that it unlocks is incredible. The freedom from pain and other flare related things is a blessing that she will cherish. She will get accustomed to the bag in no time, and in less than a year, I expect she will be happier than ever before. Let her know that a bright future is ahead =)"

CrohnsDisease,3cijf0,jackhimself,4,Wed Jul 8 21:14:22 2015 UTC,I never had any problems and I would drink more than one or two. I don't see a huge issue if you're having one or two.

CrohnsDisease,3cijf0,jackhimself,2,Wed Jul 8 13:37:17 2015 UTC,"Exactly. It's not the alcohol that is the problem, it's the dehydration that is the killer with the vein finding..."

CrohnsDisease,3ciqb2,Synth-Pro,2,Wed Jul 8 05:45:01 2015 UTC,"I gained a lot of weight while using prednisone because it affected my appetite quite a bit. Over all I gained about 60 lbs over the course of my illness and taking prednisone intermittently. I'm starting to lose the weight now, but I am eating a small serving of something I know will make me feel bloated in order to trick myself into being full for most of the morning and then I have been having salad and fish for dinner, no dressing. It works for me and once I get to a more healthy range I plan to increase my calorie intake."
CrohnsDisease,3ciqb2,DilapidatedEmu,3,Wed Jul 8 14:52:36 2015 UTC,"Same boat here - Prednisone had me go from 185 to 245. It's the worst.

CrohnsDisease,3ciqb2,covercash,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:31:33 2015 UTC,"UC here. Weight gain from being depressed at having UC. That old saying ""at least you have your health"" doesn't apply anymore so I sometimes have the attitude that I might as well eat what I want since I might die early.   For a while when I was flaring, I could eat and eat and lose weight because my body wasn't absorbing nutrients. Those days are gone (along with the flare!) but I still have a mostly don't give a damn attitude."

CrohnsDisease,3ciqb2,moopsicle,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:04:19 2015 UTC,"I had the opposite problem, losing lots of weight, but maybe my solution could help you.  I'd prepare food ahead of time, things I really liked, but portioned out for the day and I made sure I ate everything I had set aside. You only have so much self-control, and when you're flaring the last thing you want to do is count calories which leads to bad decisions. You could also try intermittent fasting, I always liked that as it gave my guts sometime off."

Would that be okay?

CrohnsDisease,3cevyj,berlin-calling,2,Tue Jul 7 21:25:18 2015 UTC,"Well this study crosses an entire country which, although genetically homogenous, shows extremely different rates of Crohn's and Colitis from area to area, with distinct clustering in Aberdeen and Glasgow (and the rural line joining them) but relatively low incidences in Edinburgh and other adjoining rural and urban areas.  The other unique factor here is that all medical records are available between the five main teaching hospitals throughout Scotland through a CHI (Comunity health index) number, allowing participating sufferers to be easily tracked. Finally, it uses a combination of these patients health and drug records combined with food and lifestyle diaries. This will make the study the largest and most comprehensive of its kind ever to be undertaken."

CrohnsDisease,3cevyj,ImCreeptastic,5,Tue Jul 7 22:00:00 2015 UTC,"That's very cool. I definitely think diet and stress have a lot to do with it (at least for me). I had a relatively poor diet when I was young, and a VERY stressful childhood due to two...interesting...parents. Without going into detail I'm 100% positive that extreme stress from home life caused my Crohn's to rear its head. Went from fine and outwardly healthy to fistula, blood, and extreme pain even moving in a week's time span."
CrohnsDisease,3cevyj,KkakHole,3,Tue Jul 7 20:30:01 2015 UTC,I had a fairly stressful childhood and ate like crap for a lot of my life.  Wouldn't be surprised at all if these contributed to my development of UC.
CrohnsDisease,3cevyj,6APe9,5,Wed Jul 8 02:40:20 2015 UTC,"I've always been interested because I have two sisters: one is healthy, one has IBS, and I have IBD. My older sister and I (the sick ones) grew up in a different neighbourhood, went to a very academic school, and lived in a very stressful home before my father's temper underwent anger management. Then my sister showed up and life is totally different. But my mom had her when she was older, too! There's so many interesting factors.   We currently are participating in a University of Alberta study on the same thing. Each of us get a blood and stool test done every year, and we submit a one week food and activity diary."
