trippinthroughtime,3c8d0v,Ucatsuton,40,Mon Jul 6 02:36:31 2015 UTC,"When it came to painting Jesus (or any other saint-baby) in medieval/Renaissance era they wanted to show he was special/divine. They did this by giving the infant adult features & poses. To our modern eyes they look like weird baby-men but that was the fashion of the time. I think Da Vinci did a better job than most at this, he kept their infant proportions but gave them adult gestures, but it still looks strange."

trippinthroughtime,3c8d0v,trane_0,12,Mon Jul 6 02:45:50 2015 UTC,My understanding for the muscular women is that he used male models to pose for him.

trippinthroughtime,3bv147,osmlol,-3,Sat Jul 4 06:47:28 2015 UTC,Are you trying to imply only one person can post something to reddit and no matter how old it is it can not be reposted? Well that's just silly.
trippinthroughtime,3bv147,kilkil,7,Thu Jul 2 17:32:18 2015 UTC,"Actually, I'm saying it's a repost, not makong any statements about whether reposts are bad or not.   But, if we're on the topic, I'd feel much better if the original poster was known, and if the person who first brought this dank maymay to reddit could at least be referenced.   Copyright may be a bitch, but creative commons is nice."
trippinthroughtime,3bv147,ButIWasDifferent,-3,Thu Jul 2 18:11:56 2015 UTC,"I'd feel much better if the original poster was known   Are you serious? Is this your first day on the internet? Can you name one meme in existence that's source can actually be traced back to an OP? There literally are none. That's what makes them memes. Do you want a fucking tracking system where you can trace every meme back through all of its shares to the username of the original poster? Why? Why would it fucking matter? Are you going to personally message them expressing your gratitude to them for having blessed your life with their dankness? They don't fucking care. They're not commenting on posts bitching at people for not citing the source of their fucking memes. If they were, everybody would be bitching at everybody. Nobody cares who made them, they aren't artistic masterpieces. They're fucking memes. The internet is public domain.  I just don't understand how you can possibly have this mindset."
trippinthroughtime,3bv147,kilkil,4,Fri Jul 3 01:25:39 2015 UTC,"Actually, AFAIK Knowyourmeme has a pretty good record of who introduced which meme.   And for the record, no, that's not what makes them memes. What makes them memes is that they spread like a metastasizing tumor throughout the Internet."
trippinthroughtime,3bv147,ButIWasDifferent,0,Fri Jul 3 01:33:30 2015 UTC,"Okay well then go to knowyourmeme and find out there if you care so much. My point is that everything is a repost and needlessly pointing it out when you recognize one is just weird. I don't understand how you can expect people to cite the source for something as insignificant as a meme. And while that may not technically be what makes them memes, it's still significant to the nature of memes. You literally never see anyone specify who they're reposting from because it would be silly. Nobody cares. Even if some dusty record exists in the depths of knowyourmeme, detailing the origin and OP of every meme in existence, it's not something people are concerned with. Nobody goes around commenting on memes like ""Ah yes, an original /u/kilkil. One of his finer pieces if I do say so myself."" They're memes. They just happen. They come and go without a trace. That's what makes the internet beautiful."
trippinthroughtime,3bv147,kilkil,2,Fri Jul 3 01:49:14 2015 UTC,"Okay, yeah. Good point.   Still, pointing out reposts is fun! It's like that spark of recognition, but for dank maymays.   Especially for not-so-popular ones like Jesus Ship here."
trippinthroughtime,3bv147,ButIWasDifferent,3,Fri Jul 3 02:00:53 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's no big deal.  Sorry I was a huge dick about it. It's been a long day."

Anyways, the story behind this is that the old man is the father to the fat chick. He was a top level government guy in ancient Athens and for some reason he ends up in hot water. He goes to prison and before he can get a trial the guards purposefully starve him. They only allow his daughter to visit him and they don't let her bring food or water for him. What try don't know is that she is pregnant, or just gave birth (can't remember which). So, she gives him her breast milk so that he can survive. Eventually, the guards notice that their starving tactics aren't working and begin to think that he is protected by the gods. He gets out of prison without a trial and is cleared of all charges."

trippinthroughtime,37rc45,elyndar,7,Sat May 30 05:42:09 2015 UTC,"Berserker:       Berserkers (or berserks) were Norse warriors who are primarily reported in the Old Norse literature to have fought in a nearly uncontrollable, trance-like fury, a characteristic which later gave rise to the English word berserk. Berserkers are attested to in numerous Old Norse sources.  The Úlfhéðnar (singular Úlfheðinn), another term associated with berserkers, mentioned in the Vatnsdœla saga, Haraldskvæði and the Völsunga saga, were said to wear the pelt of a wolf when they entered battle.  Úlfhéðnar are sometimes described as Odin's special warriors: ""[Odin’s] men went without their mailcoats and were mad as hounds or wolves, bit their shields...they slew men, but neither fire nor iron had effect upon them. This is called 'going berserk.'""  In addition, the helm-plate press from Torslunda depicts (below) a scene of Odin with a berserker—""a wolf skinned warrior with the apparently one-eyed dancer in the bird-horned helm, which is generally interpreted as showing a scene indicative of a relationship between berserkgang... and the god Odin ""—with a wolf pelt and a spear as distinguishing features.
