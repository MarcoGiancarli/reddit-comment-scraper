Magicdeckbuilding,3e68n9,jerm-x,3,Wed Jul 22 07:21:11 2015 UTC,"Douse in Gloom and Bathe in Dragonfire are bad. You should replace them with burn spells that can target players or creatures so you can redirect the damage at planeswalkers or just finish off a player after you get him to low life with your dash creatures.  It might help if you tell us how you lost, what kind of decks you are trying to beat, etc. Since it is casual if could be anything. If it is really just planeswalkers causing you trouble then maybe get a few [[Hero's Downfall]]  If you just want a planeswalker and have to choose one to put in this deck then [Sarkhan, the Dragonspeaker]] is probably the one that fits the best. However, you shouldn't feel you need planeswalkers to win. You would probably be much better off trying to lower your mana curve a bit, and making the deck a bit more aggressive."

You would probably be much better off trying to lower your mana curve a bit, and making the deck a bit more aggressive.   Yep, that's what I would say too. Aggressive decks in particular can be hurt by adding planeswalkers, because they're usually slow cards that incrementally build up advantage over many turns."

Magicdeckbuilding,3e68n9,MTGCardFetcher,2,Wed Jul 22 08:32:49 2015 UTC,"Planeswalkers are great in some decks and completely unneeded in others. If you look at top level professional decks from guys that have cards just given to them to play they sometimes have no planeswalkers in them at all.  At a glance, the biggest problem I see is consistency. Since you've only been playing for a few months, I assume you only have one Kolaghan's Command and that's why you only have the one in your deck.  Think of the decks that you got beaten by. Why did they beat you? Are there cards in their deck that your deck has no answer to? Is it just that you're trying to be aggressive and your deck isn't fast enough? If there's cards in your deck that are effective answers, you might want to up the numbers. If there are cards that you can't see being good for any of the decks you're facing, take them out to make room.  Also, make sure that you're playing with planeswalkers correctly. I've seen a lot of new players think that planeswalkers are unbeatable because they use the abilities multiple times per turn, or can't be attacked directly, or other variant rules that make planeswalkers much stronger than they are really."

Magicdeckbuilding,3e4hx5,mobilepopemobile,2,Tue Jul 21 23:12:21 2015 UTC,"It's like modern on steroids, and you can only have 1 of each card. It's a format unlike anything I've played."
Magicdeckbuilding,3e4v8i,ziggle43,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:44:14 2015 UTC,"I'm on mobile and having a hard time viewing all of the cards, but a few thoughts based on what I can see:   Goblin Rabblemaster is bad here. Not enough goblins... Really, even if you had a ton, the must-attack clause probably isn't what you really want in EDH. I'd replace it with a value creature like Reclamation Sage or Woodfall Primus or something. Fall of the Hammer is bad, and cards like it are not great in EDH. Worst-case scenario, you draw it after a board wipe or something and it's worthless. Best-case... it's just doing a bit of damage. If you need damage, try Devil's Play or Banefire. You might also try Beast Within or Song of the Dryads if you're trying to clear threats. I think Chandra and Kiora can be replaced with more aggressive options. Probably Silklash Spider over Skysnare. Wouldn't kill you to have a sweeper like Blasphemous Act, Evacuation, Wash Out, or similar.   Edit: To more specifically address your question, I think this deck should hold up, especially if you're playing multiplayer (as you should be in EDH!). It's not what I would call optimized, but it's not terrible. A lot of these creatures can do some work."

Magicdeckbuilding,3e5i3h,inferno12,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:51:18 2015 UTC,This deck is currently at 66 cards so I need some help deciding what to cut to make it 60.  The land base is awful currently as well. Any suggestions are welcome.
Magicdeckbuilding,3e5i3h,ChipsAhoyMccoy14,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:52:22 2015 UTC,If you cut all your 3 ofs and make them 2 ofs then you will be down to 60 cards.

Magicdeckbuilding,3e4wc7,kamihax0r,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:52:05 2015 UTC,"Not sure Raise the Alarm is worth the splash for white, certainly don't need that many white sources for it. You also have very few to take advantage of retraction helix, will be dead in your hand frequently. I think Hangarback walker is a much better 2 drop for this deck than raise, you lose the instant speed ambush but gain potential to grow very large and spew many more tokens, it is another artifact to turn on thopter spy network. If you want the bounce effect consider disperse / voyages end or void snare as alternatives to retraction helix."
Magicdeckbuilding,3e3goc,thesleeplessowl,3,Tue Jul 21 17:44:47 2015 UTC,"I would replace joraga invocation for chord of calling, you may even want 3 or 4 chord of callings in your deck.  There is a pretty decent elf deck shell here that you can check out as well."
Magicdeckbuilding,3e3goc,AestheticDeficiency,2,Tue Jul 21 17:58:56 2015 UTC,"I wanted to but it rotates out soon, right? I will already have to replace the obelisk of urd at that time so I worry about spending the near $10 a piece on it when I will not get to keep it long. I was considering replacing it with collected company and side boarding it."
Magicdeckbuilding,3e3goc,AestheticDeficiency,3,Tue Jul 21 18:06:18 2015 UTC,"You are correct, Chord of Calling will be rotating out of standard soon. However, it's used in modern, and I don't think it will lose much value in the long run. Especially if elves keeps doing well in modern.   As for Collected company, it's certainly a good card, but it will only hit creatures with CMC 3 or less, which means it doesn't hit Sylvan Messenger, Dwynen, or Gilt-Leaf. Where chord can instant speed fetch any one of them. I'm unsure which is actually better in your deck, and if you'd prefer collected company I'd run that. Just be aware of the pros and cons of each."
Magicdeckbuilding,3e3goc,wetwilly92,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:40:30 2015 UTC,Chord of calling is not influenced by standard demand at all. If it drops so much as a dollar I would be mildly surprised.
Magicdeckbuilding,3e3goc,AestheticDeficiency,2,Tue Jul 21 22:05:05 2015 UTC,I wrote it that way because it may drop initially when standard players sell their copies but then it will go back up for sure
Magicdeckbuilding,3e3goc,wetwilly92,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:29:32 2015 UTC,"I feel mildly confident that there aren't enough people with that card in their collection currently, that will be interested in selling it once it is no longer standard legal."

Magicdeckbuilding,3e3goc,Gprinziv,1 point,Wed Jul 22 06:08:42 2015 UTC,"Company gets two creatures, though. Dwenen's Elite + Shaman of the Pack nets you three creatures and three+ damage to the enemy. You can also use it as a lever to get Nissa for a forest, Visionary for a cantrip, or   I'd take out one Dwynen and one Messenger and two Joraga Invocation for 4 Collected Company, and get 4 Elvish Mystics in for the Thornbows. Thornies are nice but I feel like getting your wad of Elves out early and Company'ing into two Shaman for 9-11 direct damage on turn 3 is like the optimal combo you wanna aim for and Gnarlroot + Mystic will help you achieve that.  Edit: I had an edit, but I forgot it. I think it was something about Chord of Calling being in there too for Dwynen and Sylvan... I think."
Magicdeckbuilding,3e3goc,acefreemok,2,Wed Jul 22 06:20:07 2015 UTC,Chord of calling is a must. It provides elves with a toolbox of responses so you can get reclamation sage or whisperwood elemental amongst other cards. It often means you can bring in shaman of the pack to do 7 damage. I would also consider reclamation sage for your main deck and sideboard. If you have thoughtseize put it in your deck too...
Magicdeckbuilding,3e3goc,iLeftOmelas,2,Wed Jul 22 01:45:31 2015 UTC,"A B/G Elves deck at the recent SCG Standard Open, it placed 41st.

Magicdeckbuilding,3e5u4f,Weedners,1 point,Wed Jul 22 06:37:08 2015 UTC,Lol I can't read. My bad. But yeah every goblin deck needs denizen.  I think Roast would be better than Searing Blood. Eidolon of the Great Revel is another good sideboard option but they're also pricey.

Magicdeckbuilding,3e42qw,SpaghettiLuigi,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:14:30 2015 UTC,"For starters let me say playsets of singles are much better, and probably will end up being around the same price as opening packs.   And many of the cards that you listed here are kind of limited only cards. Akroan sargent for example really should be Scab Clan Berserkers, the premeire two drop would be Abbot of Keral Keep but if you don't wanna buy those then you could use mardu scout.   I think you'd benefit from reading this article about the rule of 9. It doesn't seem really obvious without the read, but having a deck full of 4of's gives you the best deck."
